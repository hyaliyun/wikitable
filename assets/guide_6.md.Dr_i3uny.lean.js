In 190 career games at LSU, Bregman batted .338/.412/.520, with 66 strikeouts and 87 walks in 761 at bats. Professional career =Minor leagues= Going into the draft, Bregman was lauded for his sense of the strike zone, bat speed, and ability to make frequent contact and strike out infrequently. He was also praised for his good range to both sides, first- step quickness, and instincts at shortstop, strong arm, good speed, and smart baserunning. The Houston Astros selected Bregman with the second overall selection in the first round of the 2015 MLB Draft. He became the fifth LSU Tiger to be drafted in the first round in seven years, the highest-drafted position player in LSU's history, and the second-highest overall behind pitcher Ben McDonald (1989). He is the highest-ever-drafted player from New Mexico, ahead of 9th-picked pitchers Jim Kremmel (1971) and Duane Ward (1982), and the second-highest-ever drafted Jewish player, behind Ron Blomberg (1967). TV analyst and former major league second baseman Harold Reynolds said he believed Bregman projected as a major league second baseman, rather than a shortstop. However, Bregman believed he could play shortstop in the majors, and said that every team that contacted him leading up to the draft had said the same. LSU head coach Paul Mainieri opined: \\"If you don't think Alex Bregman can play shortstop at the Major League level, you don't know the first thing about baseball.\\" Mike Elias, the Astros' Director of Amateur Scouting, said Bregman would remain a shortstop, and that he thought Bregman would play shortstop through Houston's minor league system and into the major leagues. Similarly, Astros General Manager Jeff Luhnow said that there was \\"no question\\" that Bregman had the skills to play shortstop. Bregman signed with the Astros in June 2015 for a $5.9 million signing bonus. He made his professional debut with the Quad Cities River Bandits of the Class A Midwest League in late June. In late July, the Astros promoted Bregman to the Lancaster JetHawks of the Class A-Advanced California League.

He worked in San Francisco and the Bay Area from 1925 to 1963, including two decades as a teacher at Stanford University, and was particularly prolific as a muralist during the 1930s. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen, but returned to the Soviet Union after the death of his wife, continuing his career there before his death.  Early life in Russia and China  Arnautoff was the son of a Russian Orthodox priest. He showed a talent for art from an early age and hoped to study art after graduating from the gymnasium in Mariupol. With the outbreak of World War I, he enrolled in the Yelizavetgrad Cavalry School. He went on to hold military leadership positions in the army of Nicholas II and the White Siberian Army, and was repeatedly awarded medals for his service. With the defeat of the Whites in Siberia, he crossed into northeastern China and surrendered his weapons. He remained in China for five years. He again tried to pursue art, signing up for schooling in Harbin, but was impoverished and took a position training the cavalry of (and possibly fighting for) the warlord Zhang Zuolin. While serving the warlord in Mukden, China, he met and married Lydia Blonsky and they had two sons, Michael and Vasily.  Schooling and early work in San Francisco and Mexico  In November 1925 Arnautoff went to San Francisco on a student visa to study at the California School of Fine Arts. There he studied sculpture with Edgar Walter and painting with Gertrude Partington Albright and other instructors. He was given a scholarship as the best student in his year, and also became active in the city's leftist arts scene. As his student visa expired, Arnautoff brought his family from China and then continued to Mexico in 1929. On Ralph Stackpole's recommendation, he became an assistant to the muralist Diego Rivera (who also spoke Russian as a result of travels in Paris and Russia). Rivera and Arnautoff worked on a series of murals at the National Palace and also at the Palace of Cort√©s, Cuernavaca. After starting the murals in the National Palace, Rivera went to San Francisco to paint a mural in the new Stock Exchange building, leaving Arnautoff in charge of the Mexican projects for a period of several months. During this period, Arnautoff matured as a muralist, both through technical practice (in San Francisco he had not done frescoes larger than an oil painting) and in style (Rivera advised him to move away from traditional European styles and learn from native Mexican styles. A third son, Jacob, was born in Mexico, and named (somewhat indirectly) after Rivera. While in Mexico, Arnautoff also met Bernard Zakheim, another leftist immigrant San Francisco muralist. The two would later work together on the Coit Tower murals.  Work in the Bay Area  \\"City Life\\" mural, Coit Tower, San Francisco, painted by Arnautoff Another part of the City Life mural, featuring a self-portrait of Arnautoff, near a magazine rack containing socialist/communist magazines. In 1931 the family returned to San Francisco. Arnautoff's first significant work after returning was a mural on the wall of his studio, which he opened to the public. Shortly afterward, he completed his first mural commission, for the Palo Alto Medical Clinic in Palo Alto (where he had been a patient) in August 1932. Arnautoff's mural series was in the historical Roth building, all were medically-themed murals done in the recessed under a loggia with four panels of modern medicine and other panels showing primitive medicine, and additionally he four painted medallions of Joseph Lister, Hippocrates, Louis Pasteur, and Wilhelm R√∂ntgen are on the exterior wall of the loggia. The four murals done in color feature modern medicine and depict Luther Emmett Holt, William Osler, and Harvey Cushing. The unveiling of this mural caused a traffic jam and some controversy, in part because on of the murals showed a doctor examining a female patient whose bare breasts were at eye-level. Like his other works in the Bay Area, the murals were frescoes. In 1934 he was chosen to paint one of the murals to be done at Coit Tower in San Francisco, with funding from the Public Works of Art Project. He was also appointed technical director of the Coit Tower murals project. He is prominently represented there by a mural depicting San Francisco city life. This mural includes a self-portrait as well as a portrait of his son, Michael. The mural caused some controversy at the time, because the newsstand Arnautoff portrait is next to excluded the San Francisco Chronicle and included left-wing newspapers. It also included other references to the \\"lack of concern\\" people show each other, including a sign for Charlie Chaplin's \\"City Lights\\", which is concerned in part with the same theme. Arnautoff was, along with fellow activist Bernard Zakheim, perhaps the most prolific muralist in San Francisco in the 1930s. He completed not only the murals at the Palo Alto Clinic and Coit Tower, but also at the Presidio chapel, George Washington High School, and the California School of Fine Arts library. All of these murals were focused on humanist themes, including concerns about class, labor, and power. He also painted five post offices (College Station and Linden, Texas; Pacific Grove, Richmond, and South San Francisco, California), and held solo exhibitions throughout the 1930s.  Teaching and political activity  Arnautoff taught sculpture and fresco painting privately and at the California School of Fine Arts, first during summer sessions and as a regular instructor beginning in 1936. He taught art at Stanford University from 1938 to 1962. Beginning in 1947, he also taught art courses at the California Labor School, including printmaking. At Stanford, Richard Diebenkorn was one of his students; Diebenkorn considered Arnautoff a mentor and admired his intellectual and political stances. Beginning with his association with Rivera, Arnautoff's political views moved to the left, and he joined the Communist Party as well as the American Artists' Congress and the San Francisco Artists and Writers Union. His style was generally more subtle than Rivera's and other social realists, but his politics were nevertheless reflected in his work, which has been described as being part of a mural arts movement that \\"hoped to inspire change through criticism of the present political system\\". In 1955, an Arnautoff lithograph titled \\"DIX McSmear\\", associating Vice President Richard Nixon with McCarthyism, created controversy. As a result, there were calls for Stanford to dismiss him. The lithograph was then used as the cover for an issue of The Nation. After he was interrogated by a House Unamerican Activities Committee subcommittee, there were again calls for Stanford to dismiss him. However, the faculty committee that reviewed his case declined to make such a recommendation to the president, and Arnautoff remained a faculty member.  Later life and return to Soviet Ukraine  Following the death of his wife in 1961, Arnautoff retired from Stanford. He returned to the Soviet Union in 1963, settling in Mariupol, Ukraine, where he had attended gymnasium. While living there, he published a memoir, and created large tile mosaics on public buildings, including a school and a communications building. He also did woodcuts for books, and had several solo exhibitions. He remarried in 1970 and died in Leningrad on March 22, 1979.  George Washington High School controversy  Since at least 1968, Arnautoff's 13 fresco murals at George Washington High School, collectively titled Life of Washington, have been controversial due to their depiction of slaves and a dead Native American. Arnautoff placed slaves and working people in the center of several of the panels, rather than Washington, and in the words of Arnautoff's biographer, \\"the mural makes clear that slave labor provide[d] the plantation's economic basis\\", at a time when high school history classes \\"ignored... that the nation's founders... owned other human beings as chattel\\". Similarly, Arnautoff placed the body of a dead Native American at the feet of pioneers, \\"challenging the prevailing narrative that westward expansion had been into largely vacant territory waiting for white pioneers to develop its full potential\\". After the 1968 protests, when new, complementary murals were painted by Dewey Crumpler, Arnautoff indicated he was glad his work had \\"provided the impetus for this new progressive work\\". In 2019, a new wave of criticism caused the San Francisco school board to announce plans to take down the murals, on grounds that these depictions sent a racist message. The San Francisco Board of Education voted in June 2019 to develop a plan to cover up all 13 panels of the mural as a form of \\"reparations\\" for past crimes. However, after criticism from (among others) the local NAACP and muralist Dewey Crumpler the school board has announced it plans to revisit the original decision. On the evening of August 13, 2019, the Board decided by a vote of 4-to-3 on a compromise, namely to hide the murals rather than destroy them. Jon Golinger, executive director of the Coalition to Protect Public Art, remarked, \\"While it is a step in the right direction to take permanent destruction off the table, we will continue to strongly oppose spending $815,000 to permanently wall off the murals so nobody has the choice to see them or learn from them.\\"  Public works  = In California = * Fresco murals of medical clinic (1932), Roth Building, 300 Homer St, Palo Alto, California, United States *Peacetime Activities of the Army (1935) fresco mural, Presidio Chapel, San Francisco, California, United States * Exterior reliefs and the controversial 13 fresco murals \\"Life of Washington\\" (1936), George Washington High School, San Francisco, California, United States *Urban Life mural, Coit Tower, San Francisco, California, United States *Lovers' Point (1940), oil on canvas post office mural, Pacific Grove, California, United States *Richmond Industrial City (1941), oil on canvas post office mural, Richmond, California, United States *South San Francisco, Past and Present (1941), oil on canvas post office mural, South San Francisco, California, United States = Other locations = *The Last Crop (1938) post office mural, Linden, Texas, United States * Post Office and School No. 54, Mariupol, Ukraine See also * Life of Washington References External links *Arnautoff Papers in Archives of American Art *Arnautoff in UC Berkeley's Living New Deal catalog *Gallery representing Estate of Victor Arnautoff *William Mandel, \\"Victor Arnautoff: Passionate Paintings of the Bay Area Black Community in the Mid-20th Century\\" * \\"Life of Washington\\" by Victor Arnautoff (photographs) Category:1896 births Category:1979 deaths Category:People from Tokmak Raion Category:People from Taurida Governorate Category:Russian military personnel of World War I Category:White movement people Category:White Russian emigrants to China Category:American people of Russian descent Category:Imperial Russian emigrants to the United States Category:Artists from the San Francisco Bay Area Category:Stanford University Department of Art and Art History faculty Category:American muralists Category:20th-century American painters Category:American male painters Category:Soviet painters Category:San Francisco Art Institute alumni Category:Federal Art Project artists Category:Public Works of Art Project artists Category:Section of Painting and Sculpture artists Category:American emigrants to the Soviet Union ","title":"Victor Arnautoff"},{"id":"39821481","text":"Elmwood Township was a township in Golden Valley County, North Dakota, United States.

Bred by the British National Stud she was the outstanding two-year-old of either sex in Britain in 1932 when she won five consecutive races. In the following year she failed to stay the distance in the 1000 Guineas but had considerable success when reverting to sprint distances, winning the July Cup, King George Stakes and Challenge Stakes. On her retirement from racing she became a successful and influential broodmare. Background Myrobella was a powerfully-built grey mare bred by the Irish branch of the National Stud in Tully, County Kildare. She inherited her grey colour from her sire Tetratema, the leading British two-year-old of 1919 who went on to win the 2000 Guineas and many important sprint races. As a stallion, Tetratema sired many good sprinters and milers including the unbeaten Tiffin and was the British champion sire in 1929. Myrobella's dam, Dolabella, produced six other winners and was a daughter of the outstanding broodmare Gondolette, whose other descendants included Hyperion, Sickle, Sansovino, Entrepreneur, Might and Power and Sariska. The National Stud leased Myrobella to Hugh Lowther, 5th Earl of Lonsdale for her racing career. She was sent into training with Fred Darling at his stables at Beckhampton in Wiltshire. Racing career =1932: two-year-old season= Myrobella began her racing career at Salisbury Racecourse in the spring of 1929, finishing second on her debut and then winning a maiden race. She won her next four races, competing against colts on each occasion. In July she contested the most valuable two-year-old race of the year, the ¬£6953 National Breeders' Produce Stakes over five furlongs at Sandown Park Racecourse. Ridden by the champion jockey Gordon Richards, she displayed \\"wonderful speed\\" in the early stages and built an unassailable lead to win very easily: according to the Sporting Life, Richards only had to sit still and wait till the winning post was passed. In September she moved up in distance for the Champagne Stakes over six furlongs at Doncaster. She started the 11/8 favourite and won by six lengths from the colt Coroado. Myrobella ended her season at Newmarket Racecourse in autumn, winning the Boscawen Stakes and the Prendergast Stakes. In the latter event, run on 14 October Myrobella's victory led to a failure of the totaliser betting system: as almost all the tickets on the race had been bought for Myrobella, the Tote sustained a ¬£232 loss on the race. In the Free Handicap, a rating of the best two-year-olds to race in Britain, Myrobella was given top weight of 133 pounds. In a year dominated by fillies, she was followed in the rankings by the Molecomb Stakes winner Betty (130) and the Cheveley Park Stakes winner Brown Betty (127). The leading colt was Manitoba on 126, a pound ahead of Hyperion. Contemporary commentators rated Myrobella the equal of the \\"flying filly\\" Mumtaz Mahal and superior to the undefeated Tiffin. She was described in the Sporting Life as \\"a streak of lightning that has paralysed all her opponents\\". Her earnings for the season on ¬£11,525 placed her fourth on the list of the most financially successful horses behind Firdaussi, Udaipur and Miracle. =1930: three-year-old season= On her three-year-old debut in April, Myrobella reverted to the minimum distance of five furlongs and won the Severeals Stakes at Newmarket in April. She was then moved up in distance to contest the 117th running of the 1000 Guineas over Newmarket's Rowley Mile course on 29 April. She failed to stay the distance and finished third of the twenty-two runners, beaten half a length and three quarters of a length by Brown Betty and Fur Tor. Myrobella then reverted to sprinting, and won the Fern Hill Stakes over five furlongs at Royal Ascot in June. She then won the July Cup at Newmarket and the King George Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse, beating the five-year-old Concerto on both occasions. At York Racecourse in August, she was beaten a short head by Concerto in the Nunthorpe Stakes, with Gold Bridge a neck away in third place. Myrobella ended her racing career in October, when she won the Challenge Stakes over six furlongs at Newmarket. Assessment As noted above, Myrobella was rated the best two-year-old of either sex to race in Britain in 1932. In their book A Century of Champions, based on a modified version of the Timeform system John Randall and Tony Morris rated Myrobella the fifth best two-year-old filly of the 20th century trained in Britain or Ireland, behind Pretty Polly, Mumtaz Mahal, Sun Chariot and Cawston's Pride. Stud record Myrobella was retired from racing to become a broodmare and had considerable success. In 1936, she produced a grey filly sired by Cameronian named Belle of Ascot, whose descendants included Linamix, a colt who won the Poule d'Essai des Poulains and sired the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe winner Sagamix. Myrobella's next foal was Snowberry (also by Cameronian), who won the Queen Mary Stakes and produced the St Leger winner Chamossaire as well as Ariana, the grand-dam of the Derby winner Snow Knight. Myrobella's best offspring was Big Game a colt sired by Bahram. Foaled in 1939, Big Game was the best British colt of his generation, winning the 2000 Guineas and the Champion Stakes before becoming a successful breeding stallion.

He was murdered in exile in the Ottoman Empire.  Family background  Ivane Abashidze came from one of the leading noble Georgian families, which had once attained, in the person of Giorgi‚ÄìMalakia Abashidze, to the crown of the western Georgian kingdom of Imereti from 1702 to 1707. His father was Prince Kaikhosro Abashidze (died 1810) and his mother was Princess Darejan (1756‚Äì1827), a daughter of King Solomon I of Imereti, whom Kaikhosro wed in 1768.  Political career  Ivane Abashidze's involvement in politics was associated with the anti-Russian revolt in Imereti from 1819 to 1820. Imereti had been absorbed by Russia in 1810 and the former kingdom had been in a renewed rebellion by 1819. In 1820, Ivane‚Äîhitherto a \\"loyal\\" Russian subject‚Äîwas nominated, by virtue of being Solomon I's grandson, as a king of Imereti by one of the rebel noble parties, dominated by the Abashidze clan. Overwhelmed by the Russian troops, Abashidze fled to Kaikhosro Gurieli, an uncle of his wife, in the Principality of Guria, whose many nobles also joined the Imeretian rebellion. The Russian colonel Puzirevsky, sent in Guria to enforce the surrender of the fugitive pretender, was killed. Abashidze and the Gurians then carried operations into Imereti and finally entrenched themselves in the Khani gorge. In July 1820, the Russians under General Velyaminov occupied the gorge and then overran Guria. Ivane Abashidze's family were rounded up, but he escaped capture by the Russians and fled to the Ottoman territory. His mother, Darejan, was arrested and deported to Russia. She would outlive her son and die in Moscow in 1827. In the meantime, the loyal prince-regnant of Guria, Mamia V Gurieli, successfully negotiated the return of Ivane's Gurian wife and his children from the road to their exile in Russia. Ivane Abashidze was murdered near the Ottoman- controlled town of Akhaltsikhe, in 1822, allegedly at the instigation of Prince Vakhtang, a scion of the Imeretian royals, also an anti-Russian rebel and pretender to the throne of Imereti.  Marriage and descendants  Ivane Abashidze was married to Princess Elisabed, a daughter of Simon II Gurieli, Prince of Guria. They had two sons, Kaikhosro and Giorgi, and a daughter, Ekaterine. Ekaterine eventually married Prince Rostom Tsereteli and became the mother of the popular Georgian writer Akaki Tsereteli.

The West Himalayan sub-alpine forests are dominated by fir, while the deciduous sub- alpine scrub is dominated by Himalayan birch (Betula utilis) and juniper (Juniperus communis) with wild rose as an associate. The southeastern part has moderately open coniferous vegetation dominated by Kail pine and associated with fir and spruce. The vegetation of the more rocky and open northwestern portion is predominantly sub-alpine scrub forest dominated by juniper and the Kail pine as an associated species. Man-made sub-alpine pastures also occur in both north-western and south-eastern parts of the sanctuary.  Fauna  The Hirpora Wildlife Sanctuary is an abode to many species of animals including the Himalayan brown bear, Himalayan black bear, musk deer, leopard, Tibetan wolf, Himalayan palm civet and around 50 individuals the critically endangered Pir Panjal markhor. Besides, 130 species of birds including the spotted forktail, western tragopan, rock bunting, rufous-breasted accentor, Himalayan woodpecker, blue rock thrush, white-capped redstart, Himalayan griffon, common stonechat and grey wagtail are found in the sanctuary.  Disturbance  The Mughal Road cuts through the Hirpora Wildlife Sanctuary and is believed to inhibit the movement of animals, especially the critically endangered Pir Panjal markhor. The Sanctuary has also been disturbed due to deforestation, excessive livestock grazing and construction of permanent huts by the Gujjars, Bakerwals and local shepherds.

Chandru. The film revolves around four men, played by Jai, VTV Ganesh, Sathyan and Rajkumar. Niveda Thomas was paired opposite Jai. The film was produced by Kalpathi S Aghoram and has cinematography by Anand Jeeva; songs were composed by Prem Kumar. The film went on floors on 29 November 2013. It is not a remake of the 1966 mythological film Saraswathi Sabatham. Plot The film begins in a modern heaven where Lord Paramasivan (Subbu Panchu) gives orders to Narada (Manobala) to pick four people for his Thiruvilaiyadal. The candidates picked are Ramarajan (Jai), a Siddha doctor; Ganesh (VTV Ganesh), a helpless man who is the husband of a local female don; Gopi (Sathyan), a future politician and son of a selfish politician; and Krishna (Rajkumar), a budding actor. Paramasivan and Narada see all the four's routines and premises on an imac. Ramarajan falls in love with a singer Jayshree (Niveda Thomas), who is a singer, and wins her heart. Engaged for marriage after 26 days, the four men plan to fix a bachelor party at Bangkok. When they reach Bangkok, they enjoy it and flirt with girls at the party. However, they are too drunk, and when they wake up, they find themselves abandoned in a tropical island in Bangkok. They try many ways to escape but are unsuccessful. Six months have elapsed, and Paramasivan gives them a final chance, which is a motorboat of pirates arriving to explore the island. The four of them beg them to take them to Chennai, but they refuse to help them and flee. The quartet fights the pirates back and escapes the island in the boat, abandoning the pirates on the island. After reaching Chennai, they have a happy ending except Gopi. Ramarajan finds out about Jayshree's marriage, so he goes to the marriage and finally marries Jayshree, implying the groom as an American software engineer and tells him to marry another girl by wishing him all the best. In a post-credits scene, the film mentions behind the scenes.

Chandru shot the first scene in Villivakkam, Chennai. Though the film is set in Chennai, the director said that a minor portion will be shot abroad. In June 2013 VTV Ganesh left to Malaysia for the shoot of Saraswathi Sabatham with Jai. In July, about 80% of the film shooting had been wrapped. = Title controversy = The film was initially named Saraswathi Sabatham, reusing the title of the 1966 mythological film starring Sivaji Ganesan, and fans stated they would not allow the usage of titles of their idol for comedy films and that they would protest in front of Jai and Sathyan's houses, if the makers proceeded with the same title. A notice, demanding that the film should be renamed, was sent to film producer Kalpathi Agoram and his brothers Ganesh and Suresh, on behalf of the Nellai City Sivaji social welfare organisation by advocate Kamaraj. On 25 September 2013, it was announced that the film had been retitled as Naveena Saraswathi Sabatham. The first look poster of the film was revealed on 14 April 2013.  Soundtrack  The soundtrack album was composed by Prem Kumar. The lyrics were written by Vairamuthu, Madhan Karky and Gaana Bala. The music was released on 13 October 2013. The track 'Kaathirundhai Anbe' was released earlier as a single. Release The satellite rights of the film were sold to STAR Vijay. The film was given a \\"U\\" certificate by the Indian Censor Board. Critical reception Naveena Saraswathi Sabatham received mixed reviews from critics. Baradwaj Rangan wrote, \\"Very occasionally, a line or a sight gag makes you smile, like the one with the roadside idli seller with a signboard that announces \\"pizza\\" and \\"burger.\\" Otherwise, it's all very exhausting\\". Indiaglitz said, \\"Motive is in place perfectly; however it has taken to long to be conveyed. Revolving around four men almost all the time, the film could have avoided a few scenes that occupied time. The 1966 flick has certainly influenced 'Naveena Saraswathi Sabatham' he arriving at its climax twist, but has got nothing in connection with it otherwise.\\" and added, \\"In all, the film is a brand new concept, with a contemporary message and a revolutionary screenplay, although it ultimately ends in an old fashion. A clean entertainer by nature, 'Naveena Saraswathi Sabatham' is old wine in a not-exactly-new but quite a fancy bottle.\\" Sify called it disappointing and wrote, \\"The film has no basic logic or reason and seems to have been made with the only intention of trying to tickle the funny bone of the viewers, without any content\\" and added \\"There is a scene in the second half of the film where Naradar tells Lord Siva that the story isn't progressing fast, people will be posting on Facebook and Twitter that the first half of the film is super while the second half is Mokkai! It sort of sums up NSS\\". The Times of India gave 2.5 stars out of 5 and pointed out the same as Sify, \\"There is a scene in the second half in which Naradar tells Lord Siva that the story isn't progressing and by this time, people will be posting on Facebook and Twitter that the first half of the film is super while the second half is mokkai...Sadly, it is also the most profound statement in the entire film ‚Äî not only on the audiences of today but also on the films we get these days, including this one, which just turns dreary, minutes after we enter the second half\\". IANS gave 2 out of 5 stars and wrote, \\"The humour is stale and has been used for years now. The film meanders at a snail's pace and becomes extremely tedious in the second half. He (Chandru) throws in what are supposedly a few funny incidents that hardly evoke any laughter, forget entertainment. This is not even a film you can force yourself to watch because you have paid money. It's god's way of punishing us for all the bad we have done in our lives\\". Talking about the performances, Behindwoods said, \\"VTV Ganesh is the biggest takeaway from the movie and he moves the second half forward with his antics on the island. The portions where he speaks chaste Tamil in his hoarse voice are a riot. Jai's shrill voice has been his USP all along and he comfortably delivers what was expected.\\" and added \\"Sathyan and Rajkumar as the other two friends play their roles with ease and fit in with the group. Niveda Thomas appears in exactly two scenes and two songs!\\" =Box office= 'NSS' opened average collected 8.3 crore in first weekend at the box office. The film collected 1.30 crore in first weekend in Chennai alone, opening at first position at the Chennai box office ahead of the other new releases.

Prior to the 16th century, this end of the Piazza was represented by a jumble of house and store-fronts. In 1412, the Piazza front was roofed with a portico. Amid the houses emerged small alleys: Via Pescherie Vecchie, Via Clavature, and Via degli Orefici, each with their own concentration of businesses. Underneath the porticos adjacent to the Piazza, bankers and merchants from the adjacent shops (botteghe) set up banchi to conduct their business. In the 15th and 16th centuries, among the families owning botteghe were the aristocratic and senatorial Malvasia, Duglioli, and Amorini families.Cose notabili della citt√† di Bologna: ossia, Storia cronologica, Volumes 2-3, by Giuseppe Guidicini, Bologna (1869), page 388.

The palace is connected by a portico, known as a Pavaglione, to the Archiginnasio of Bologna, one of the main buildings of the University of Bologna. The term derives from the French pavillon, meaning \\"pavilion\\", in reference to a fair of silkworms held here in 1449. As of 2015, behind the palace on some days is an open-air market of local products. The palace itself is occupied by a combination of businesses and apartments.

Clement Vaz, \\"Profiles of Eminent Goans Past and Present\\", Concept Publishing Company, 1997, Early life and background He was born on 22 August 1895 in the village of Velim in Salcete and joined Bombay's Sir Jamsetjee Jeejebhoy School of Art in 1916. Cruzo studied under Gladstone Salomon, M. V. Dhurandhar and Agoskar, and graduated in 1920. He went on to study in Europe, applied to the Berlin University of the Arts and won a scholarship and the status of \\"Master Student\\" (Meistersch√ºler). He studied there from 1922 under Arthur Kampf, Ferdinand Spiegel and Paul Plontke. Career Cruzo caught the attention of the Portuguese Ambassador in Berlin when he, after a German newspaper described him as \\"Portuguese from India\\", asked the paper to rectify, insisting that he was \\"pure Indian\\". With the support of the Ambassador, Cruzo held his first solo exhibition in Lisbon in October 1925. He returned to India following a request by the Maharaja of Travancore. Cruzo settled in Bombay and became well known as a sculptor and portrait painter both among Indian royalty and the expatriate elite. Among the people who sat for his portraits were Philip Chetwode, Louis Mountbatton, Lallubhai Samaldas and Purshottamdas Thakurdas. His \\"Cruzo Studio\\" in Brabourne Stadium became an important meeting place, including for members of the Goa liberation movement. Despite Cruzo's entries with the rich and famous, his main work focused on poverty and social injustice as well as hard-working farmers and fishermen. He also painted colourful allegories and nudes. A meeting with Mahatma Gandhi gave Cruzo fresh inspiration and from then onwards, political themes dominated his work, first the struggle for independence, partition and later the Bangladesh Liberation War and the Vietnam War.

V. Vijayan. The novel is a spiritual odyssey into the human psyche. It differs in language, vision and characterisation from Vijayan's earlier works such as Khasakkinte Itihasam and Dharmapuranam. It won many major awards including the Kendra Sahitya Akademi Award, Kerala Sahitya Akademi Award and Vayalar Award. Plot summary Gurusagaram differs in language, vision and characterisation from Vijayan's earlier works. It is on the immanence of Guru in the life of the seeker. Guru is everywhere and is manifested in everybody. The seeker partakes of the grace of the Guru as he happens for him unawares and unconditional. The central character Kunjunni is a journalist from Kerala, working in Delhi, going on an assignment to report the Bengal partition of 1971. He undergoes an excruciating experience both spiritually and physically to learn how to annihilate all forms of ego. During his search for The teacher, he encounters teachers from all spheres of life, each of them teaching him lessons that help him on the way, and he in turn becoming teacher to many of them. The beginning chapter gives an account of how his father becomes a teacher to him and the chain of teachers that begins from there continues till the last chapter where he discovers his ultimate guru. the range of teachers include his childhood friend Colonel Balakrishnan now Swami Nirmalanandan, Olga the Czech media person haunted by the aftermath of the war she had to endure, Haimavathi the girl whom he molested, Lalitha, the shorthand writer at his office, and many more characters from so diverse backgrounds. He's troubled by the separation from his wife Shivani, and is torn between her unwillingness to get back together and his love for their daughter Kalyani. He often goes to Nirmalanandan to find solace, discussing himself with his friend. It's during such a visit that Kunjunni starts his journey along the lines of spirituality. On complaining about the restlessness in his life, Swami leaves him alone on the shores of the river where he finds the small insects living beneath grass fighting each other for their mere survival. This leads him to a new light and he leaves the place, learning to cultivate in him a respect, even for the grass that he steps on. \\"Angaye vedanippikkathe enikk nadannu kudallo\\" (I won't be able to walk without hurting you)- this sentence that he speaks to the grass on which he steps shows the intensity of the knowledge he has acquired at this point. Though enlightened by some pieces of knowledge, he's still troubled by the problems encircling him. It's in the middle of these difficulties that he's sent to Kolkata report the Bangladesh partition. Once there he revisits the places his father had taken him to as a child. Later we see him visiting these places again with his daughter, trying to transfer the knowledge he got from his father to his next generation. The specific transfer is supposed to occur at the time when they witness a flock of storks flying above, reminding Kunjunni of the enlightenment experience of Paramhamsa. He experiences something of the sort and this is transferred through him to his daughter too. The war reporting, too, teaches him many lessons, the most prominent teacher being the Muslim father who decides to bury the Hindu girl who died holding hands with his son. The war and its violence seem to be the reflections of his own inner turmoil. The confusions he goes through and the fights that take place inside himself dies down as the war too comes to an end. But just like the war created the partition, the end of his problems too comes with a wound ‚Äì the revelation by Shivani that Kalyani is not his daughter. Though the truth is painful at first, this is the factor that leads him to find his guru and attain his knowledge. He leaves his job and goes back home, giving away all his books but The Bhagavatam, maybe due to the realization that all these knowledge gave him nothing at all. In the last chapter we see Kunjunni finding his Guru in his daughter who was not his own. This makes him grow to the realisation that the whole world is a teacher, that each and everything, every person has a lesson to teach you. Thus his search for Guru ends in Kalyani yet it seems as if his search begins in her. The love that he had stored solely for her grows as big as the world, being transferred to the whole world. Inner Thoughts The novel, in its totality gives the message that we're all tied by the bondage of karma.karma refers to actions. The teacher that begins in his forefathers ending in his daughter is on example for this. also, Kalyani herself becomes an example, as her life's aim it seems had been enlightenment of Kunjunni. The way she's born from the wrong and yet she becomes the beacon for Kunjunni puzzles us to a certain degree. Another factor that shows the powerlessness of humans is the irony that, Shivani's research was on blood cancer and her daughter died of the same disease. Yet another thought presented is the futility of war. Through the many stories of war -from Kunjunni's elder brother to Olga and the Polish news reporter Yanush- Vijayan illustrates that no war has ever produced good. What's left is always the tears and pain of the victims. The war between himself and Shivani also ends in destruction as the two go separate ways. But, the underlying factor throughout is the message about the sea of teachers that lie before us. The message that if we open our eyes and look around, we can find numerous instances that teach us what we seek and numerous individuals who teach us what we need. Background According to Vijayan, this novel was greatly inspired by the teachings of Karunakaraguru of Sree Santhigiri Ashram near Thiruvananthapuram. Vijayan underwent a spiritual transformation after meeting the guru and this change also reflected in his writings, the best example being Gurusagaram.

(Gay Best Friend) is a 2013 American teen comedy film directed by Darren Stein and produced by School Pictures, Parting Shots Media, and Logolite Entertainment. The film had its first official screening at the 2013 Tribeca Film Festival in April 2013 and was released theatrically on January 17, 2014, by Vertical Entertainment. G.B.F. focuses on closeted gay high school students Tanner and Brent. When Tanner is outed, he is picked up by the cool girls and he begins to surpass still-closeted Brent in popularity. The film stars Michael J. Willett, Paul Iacono, Sasha Pieterse, Andrea Bowen, Xosha Roquemore, Molly Tarlov, Evanna Lynch, Joanna \\"JoJo\\" Levesque, and Megan Mullally. G.B.Fs soundtrack includes new compositions by \\"Hi Fashion\\" and \\"Veva\\". Plot Tanner Daniels and Brent Van Camp are two closeted teenage high school students. Their school, North Gateway High in suburban New Jersey, is dominated by three feuding cliques respectively led by the three most popular girls in school: Fawcett Brooks, Caprice Winters, and 'Shley Osgood. Brent hatches a plan to out himself at prom, which will make him the most popular boy at school since the latest trend, according to teen girl magazines, is a GBF ‚Äì a gay best friend. Meanwhile, Soledad Braunstein is told by teacher Ms. Hoegel that their Gay-Straight Alliance (GSA) cannot exist if there is not a gay student in the club. Fawcett helps Soledad track down any potential gay students in the school by downloading a hook-up app for gay men. Brent previously persuaded Tanner to download the app on his phone and Soledad and her friends track Tanner down, forcing him to come out in front of the whole school. This attracts the attention of Fawcett, 'Shley, and Caprice, who all believe having a GBF will secure their bid for prom queen. Angry, Tanner confronts Brent for not also coming out and harshly outs Brent in front of his overbearing mother Mrs. van Camp as revenge. Tanner quickly regrets it but Brent is no longer speaking to him and he reluctantly agrees to be friends with Fawcett, Caprice, and 'Shley, as the three girls protect him from homophobic bullying led by Fawcett's ex-boyfriend Hamilton. However, the girls express their disappointment that Tanner is not like the stereotypical gay men they have seen on television and make him over to their liking. Brent is annoyed at all the attention Tanner is getting, especially since Tanner has become nominated for Prom King. Likewise, 'Shley's conservative best friend McKenzie Pryce tries to persuade 'Shley that homosexuality is sinful. At a party, Caprice sets Tanner up with Christian, a gay friend of hers, who is willing to be his prom date, but McKenzie refuses to allow Tanner to buy a couple's prom ticket, insisting they are exclusive to heterosexual couples. Tanner agrees to join Soledad's GSA since she is the only one willing to help him fight the school policy and chastises Fawcett, 'Shley, and Caprice for only caring about him when it benefits them. Chagrined, Fawcett also joins the GSA, but Ms. Hoegel quickly sees that Tanner is being used by the girls as a prize. Fawcett offers to hold an alternative prom, which pleases Tanner but enrages Caprice, who is annoyed that Tanner is endorsing Fawcett. Brent, believing that he is Tanner's prom date, is disappointed to learn that Tanner is going with Christian. He teams up with Caprice, who plans on being queen of the school-endorsed prom and offers to let him be her king. Tanner and Brent's old friend group, Sophie and Glenn, confront them and reveals how they are being used as tools, and Tanner asks Fawcett if this is true. Fawcett admits that she was, but she now does consider him a real friend. She also tells Tanner she created the second prom to win since most of the school dislikes her. Tanner agrees to help her win prom queen after hearing this. Brent manages the publicity department for the school-sanctioned prom and uses explicitly anti-gay posters. The principal cancels the school prom due to the ensuing public backlash and supports the alternative prom. Tanner and Fawcett win prom king and queen and Tanner makes a speech at the dance, saying that he is tired of being seen as an object or a symbol and apologizes to his true friends for dumping them. Tanner dances with Brent and they make up, although they decide to stay friends instead of being romantically involved and risk a friendship that is already sturdy in its own right. Cast * Michael J.

Northy searched the Internet for LGBT screenwriting competitions and turned up listings for Outfest's Screenwriting Lab and NewFest's NewDraft Screenplay Contest. By the time both festivals came around last summer, Northy was a finalist for both. Guinevere Turner, with the Outfest Lab, sent the script for G.B.F. to Darren Stein. Stein told Indiewire, \\"I thought, since it came from Guinevere, that it would be a dark script. I read it and I was laughing out loud. It felt like a classic teen movie. It jumped off the page in a way that most screenplays don't. It was so snarky and smart, about something close to my heart and culturally relevant. It wasn't message-y or preachy. I was very, very excited. It's very rare to laugh out loud reading a script.\\" After reading the script, Stein decided to direct the film and passed it onto his manager who got investors involved with the project. Raven Symon√© was in talks to star in the film following the table read however eventually passed on the project. =Filming= Principal photography took place in Los Angeles over 18 days. =Rating= The film received an R rating from the MPAA for \\"sexual references\\". Director Stein responded to the rating by saying, \\"I always thought of G.B.F. as a PG-13 movie, but we were given an R 'For Sexual References' while not having a single F-bomb, hint of nudity or violence in the film. Perhaps the ratings box should more accurately read 'For Homosexual References' or 'Too Many Scenes of Gay Teens Kissing.' I look forward to a world where queer teens can express their humor and desire in a sweet, fun teen film that doesn't get tagged with a cautionary R.\\" Release G.B.F. made its official Hollywood premiere at Chinese 6 Theater in Los Angeles, California on November 19, 2013. Prior to its theatrical release, the film was screened at many film festivals. =Critical reception= The film has a score of 80% on review-aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes based on 41 reviews, with an average rating of 6.39/10. The site's consensus reads, \\"G.B.F. explores high school relationship dynamics and teen stereotypes with a refreshingly humorous touch - and surprisingly subtle smarts\\". On Metacritic, the film has a 56 out of 100 rating based on 14 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Home media The film made its DVD debut on February 11, 2014 in the US.

Egyptian army chief General Abdel Fattah al-Sisi led a coalition to remove the President of Egypt, Mohamed Morsi, from power and suspended the Egyptian constitution of 2012. The move came after the military's ultimatum for the government to \\"resolve its differences\\" with protesters during widespread national protests. The military arrested Morsi and Muslim Brotherhood leaders, and declared Chief Justice of the Supreme Constitutional Court Adly Mansour as the interim president of Egypt. The announcement was followed by demonstrations and clashes between supporters and opponents of the move throughout Egypt. There were mixed international reactions to the events.Egypt after the coup: Only the beginning of the beginning Baker Institute Blog a Chron.com blog. Blog.chron.com (17 July 2013). Retrieved on 14 August 2013. Most Arab leaders were generally supportive or neutral, with the exception of Qatar and Tunisia who strongly condemned the military's actions. The US avoided describing the action as a coup. Other states either condemned or expressed concern over the removal of Morsi. Due to the regulations of the African Union regarding the interruption of constitutional rule by a member state, Egypt was suspended from that union. There has also been debate in the media regarding the labeling of these events. It has been described by Western mainstream media as a coup or as a revolution by proponents. Ensuing protests in favour of Morsi were violently suppressed culminating with the dispersal and massacre of pro-Morsi sit-ins on 14 August 2013, amid ongoing unrest; journalists, and several hundred protestors were killed by police and military force. Muslim Brotherhood members claim 2,600 people were killed, Human Rights Watch documented 904 deaths, describing it as crimes against humanity and 'one of the world's largest killings of demonstrators in a single day in recent history', while the government puts the figure at 624. Background Then President Mohamed Morsi (right) and General al-Sisi (left) listen to visiting U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel (center), during a meeting with U.S. officials on 24 April 2013. Al-Sisi, chosen by Morsi to be the first post-Mubarak era Defense Minister, would later sanction the removal of Morsi from office. In February 2011, Hosni Mubarak resigned after 18 days of mass demonstrations that ended his 29-year rule of Egypt. In July 2011 the caretaker government approved an election law, leading to election of a Parliament in December 2011 ‚Äì January 2012, and an advisory council in January‚ÄìFebruary 2012.Egyptian Parliamentary Election 2011‚Äì2012; Wikipedia An alliance led by the Freedom and Justice Party won the most seats in each election. An additional 25% of the members of the advisory council were to be appointed by the President. In June 2012, Mohamed Morsi won the presidential election with 51.73% of total votes to become the first democratically elected president of Egypt. In June 2012, prior to Morsi being sworn in as President, the Supreme Constitutional Court ruled that the election law was unconstitutional and ordered the elected bodies dissolved. After assuming office, President Morsi appointed additional members to the advisory council from 35 political parties and invited the elected bodies to meet to discuss the ruling of the court. The elected parliament determined that the constitutional court did not have authority to dissolve an elected parliament, then referred the matter to the Court of Cassation. The elected parliament could not pass any laws, but the advisory council continued to give advice on proposed Presidential Decrees. Parliament also proceeded with creation of a new constitutional committee to draft amendments to the Egyptian Constitution, replacing the committee created in March 2012 but dissolved by the constitutional court. Proposed constitutional amendments were approved in December 2012 by a national referendum.Egyptian constitutional referendum, 2012 ‚Äì Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia New elections were scheduled for April 2013 under a law approved in draft by the constitutional court, but were postponed to October 2013 to comply with a technical order of an administrative court. In November 2012, following the protests against the Constitutional Declaration by Morsi, opposition politicians ‚Äì including Mohamed ElBaradei, Amr Moussa and Hamdeen Sabahi, according to The Wall Street Journal ‚Äì started holding confidential meetings with army leaders, in order to discuss ways of removing President Morsi. On 28 April 2013, Tamarod was started as a grassroots movement to collect signatures to remove Morsi by 30 June. They called for peaceful demonstrations across Egypt especially in front of the Presidential Palace in Cairo. The movement was supported by the National Salvation Front, April 6 Youth Movement and Strong Egypt Party. In a poll published by PEW research center in May 2013, 54% of Egyptians approved of Morsi against a 43% who saw him negatively, while about 30% were happy with the direction of the country, 73% thought positively of the army and only 35% were content about local policy authorities. In the lead up to the protests, a Gallup poll indicated that about a third of Egyptians said they were \\"suffering\\" and viewed their lives poorly. At a conference on 15 June, Morsi called for foreign intervention in Syria. According to Yasser El-Shimy, an analyst with the International Crisis Group, this statement crossed \\"a national security red line.\\" The army rebuked this statement the next day by stating that its only role was to guard Egypt's borders. Although the Egyptian constitution ostensibly declares the president as the supreme commander of the armed forces, the Egyptian military is independent of civilian control. As the first anniversary of Morsi's presidential inauguration approached in 2013, his supporters such as the National Coalition for Supporting Legitimacy started demonstrations at multiple places including El-Hossari Mosque, El-Nahda Square, outside Cairo University, outside Al-Rayan Mosque in the posh suburb of Maadi, and in Ain Shams district. They had started open-ended rallies. The largest protest was planned for 30 June. Causes The removal of Morsi from office by the coalition was a result of a coup d'√©tat following protests, that were instigated by frustration with Morsi's year-long rule in which Egypt faced economic issues, energy shortages, lack of security, and diplomatic crises. Some of the issues that might have caused the protests and lead to the later removal of Morsi include: * A year earlier (on 22 November 2012), President Morsi enacted a constitutional declaration, granting the presidential power to appoint the People's Prosecutor, and until the constitution was finalized, and a new People's Assembly was elected, all Presidential decisions were final and irrefutable. The declaration also immunized the Constituent Assembly and Shura Council from dissolution. The declaration was later abrogated before referendum due to multiple protests and public anger. * Muslim Brotherhood and their ruling political party using the majority of their members and allies in the constitutional committee to pass a hotly disputed constitution. Even approved by 64% of Egyptians who voted, it was noted only about 30% of Egyptians with voting rights participated in the referendum process. which caused secular and liberal party members and church representatives to withdraw from the committee. * Power, gas and economical crises. Plans to cut subsidies in exchange for a $4.8 billion IMF loan which would cause an increase in the price of gas, electricity, food and taxes.Nassef Sawiris * The construction of an Ethiopian dam along the Nile river, affecting Egypt's share of water. * Security of the state worsened; two of the most prominent stories related to security under Morsi were: the murder of 16 border guards in Sinai, and the abduction of 7 Egyptian security personnel who were later released.PressTV ‚Äì Abducted Egyptian security forces released * Egyptian Army economic interests. These include local civil industry, army foreign partnerships related to maritime and air transport, oil and gas and industrial-scale environmental projects such as wastewater treatment and energy generation. Modern economy have always threatened the military economic position. * On 1 March 2015, Mekameleen, an Islamist TV Channel based in Istanbul, Turkey, released audio recordings of senior Egyptian officials which suggested that when Mohamed Morsi was president, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) gave money to the Egyptian defense ministry in exchange for a campaign against Morsi. UAE money was also sent to the Tamarod protest movement, according to the recordings. Planning Leaked tapes from the summer of 2013 that were later verified by J. P. French Associates recorded figures of the Egyptian military, including former General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, suggesting that the Egyptian military was involved in the mass-protests preceding Morsi's ouster. In one of the leaked tapes, the generals are heard discussing rigging the legal case against Morsi, and in another, authorizing the withdrawal of a large sum of money for the army's use from the bank account of Tamarod, the ostensibly independent grassroots group that was organizing protests against President Morsi. The tapes also suggest high-level collusion between the coup plotters and the Government of the United Arab Emirates as the money that is to be transferred from Tamarod's account into the army's account was provided by the UAE. The tapes were first released on the Turkish Islamist channel Mekameleen, a fact that the Egyptian government says discredits the tapes as fakes. American officials later confirmed that the United Arab Emirates was indeed providing financial support for the protests against Morsi that preceded the military coup. There is also evidence on the support of the military coup plotters by the Egyptian economic elites.Korotayev, A., Issaev, L., & Shishkina, A. (2016). Egyptian coup of 2013: an ‚Äòeconometric‚Äôanalysis. The Journal of North African Studies, 21(3), 341‚Äì356 . Egypt‚Äôs Interior Ministry was seen as most influential in the lead- up to the coup d‚Äô√©tat as a revenge for powers lost during the Egyptian revolution of 2011 according to a Reuters analysis Events Anti-Morsi demonstrators marching in Cairo on 28 June On Friday 28 June, protests against Morsi started to build throughout Egypt including in such cities as Cairo, Alexandria, Dakahlia, Gharbiya and Aswan as a \\"warm up\\" for the massive protests expected on 30 June that were planned by Tamarod. Pro-Morsi and Muslim Brotherhood supporters started counter demonstrations at the Rabia Al- Adawiya Mosque in Nasr City. Prior to the protests, Christians, particularly in Upper Egypt, received threats from pro-Morsi protestors, pressuring them not to take part in the protests. Sheikh Essam Abdulamek, a member of parliament's Shura Council, said in an interview on television that Christians should not participate in the protests and warned them \\"do not sacrifice your children [since the] general Muslim opinion will not be silent about the ousting of the president.\\" According to information that came out after President Morsi was removed from office, officials claimed that Morsi stopped working at the Egyptian Presidential Palace on 26 June in anticipation to the coup and moved with his family to El-Quba Palace. On 29 June, Tamarod claimed that it collected more than 22 million signatures from a petition calling for Morsi to step down as president. On the other hand, the coup was preceded by the reconciliation of military and economic elites who organized shortages of fuel to provoke discontent of general population toward the Morsi administration.Egyptian coup of 2013: an ‚Äòeconometric‚Äô analysis.

However, independent observers have raised concerns about wild exaggeration of the number of actual anti-Morsi protestors with one crowd statistical expert study indicating that a total of a little more than 1 million people protested against Morsi across the whole country. Hundreds of thousands in support of Morsi gathered in Rabaa Square in Cairo and other cities. In Damietta, 250 fishing boat sailors demonstrated against Morsi by sailing through the Nile and chanting against him. The president moved that day from Quba Palace to the Republican Guard headquarters, while protesters thought he was at Ittihadeya Palace. =1 July: Deadlines and options= On 1 July, again more than 1 million demonstrators against Morsi gathered in Tahrir Square and outside the presidential palace, while other demonstrations were held in the cities of Alexandria, Port Said and Suez. Some police officers wearing their uniforms joined the anti-Morsi protests and chanted: \\"The police and the people are one.\\" In clashes around the Muslim Brotherhood headquarters in Mokattam, eight people died. Their headquarters was ransacked and burned while protesters threw objects at windows and looted the building, making off with office equipment and documents. Tamarod gave President Mohamed Morsi until 2 July at 17:00 to resign or face a civil disobedience campaign. That was followed by the Egyptian Armed Forces issuing a 48-hour ultimatum that gave the country's political parties until 3 July to meet the demands of the Egyptian people. The Egyptian military also threatened to intervene if the dispute was not resolved by then. Four ministers also resigned on the same day: Tourism Minister Hisham Zazou (who previously offered to resign a few months earlier after Morsi appointed an Islamist member of al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya, the group allegedly responsible of the Luxor massacre, though the group has denied this charge, as governor of Luxor), Communication and IT Minister Atef Helmi, State Minister for Legal and Parliamentary Affairs Hatem Bagato, and State Minister for Environmental Affairs Khaled Abdel Aal, leaving the government with only members of the Freedom and Justice Party. On the same day, it was reported that Barack Obama called Morsi. The call went along the United States' vision and that the only option out of the stressed situation would be to call for an early general presidential election in which Morsi is not a candidate. Morsi replied, \\"the Egyptian people decide,\\" before he closed the line. =2 July: Morsi speech= On 2 July, opponents and supporters of Morsi gathered in the capital, Cairo. The deadline set by the military for Morsi to solve the escalating political problem approached. The military said that they would intervene without eliminating either side, but they betrayed their speech and the president by engineering a coup the next day. Helicopters were also present around Cairo with armored vehicles taking up positions. On 3 July, clashes between protestors and local residents erupted around a pro-Morsi rally near Cairo University, leaving 18 people dead. Foreign Minister Mohamed Kamel Amr also resigned, in support of the anti-government protesters. The presidency rejected the Egyptian Army's 48-hour ultimatum, vowing that the president would pursue his own plans for national reconciliation to resolve the political crisis. Defense Minister General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi was also said to have told Morsi that he would impose a military solution if a political one could not be found by the next day. Incidentally, the Court of Cassation ordered the reinstatement of former general prosecutor Abdel Maguid Mahmoud who was replaced with Talaat Abdallah following the constitutional declaration on 22 November 2012. The presidential spokesman and the spokesman for the cabinet resigned as well. The newspaper Al-Ahram reported that if there were no political resolution, the military would suspend the constitution of Egypt and appoint a new council of experts to draft a new one, institute a three-person executive council, and appoint a prime minister from the military. Morsi's military advisor, Sami Hafez Anan, also resigned and said that the army would not \\"abandon the will of the people.\\" In a late-night television address Morsi declared that he would \\"defend the legitimacy of his elected office with his life.\\" He added that \\"there is no substitute for legitimacy\\" as he vowed not to resign. Morsi accused supporters of Hosni Mubarak of exploiting the wave of protests to topple the government and fight democracy. After Morsi's statement, an official Facebook page of the Egyptian Armed Forces wrote a post under the title \\"The Last Hours\\" saying in response to Morsi: \\"The Supreme Commander in Chief of the Egyptian Armed Forces had mentioned before that it's better for us to die rather than seeing the Egyptian People being threatened or horrified, and we swear that we would sacrifice our lives and our blood for Egypt against every terrorist or extremist or ignorant. Long live Egypt.\\" =3 July: Day of Action= General Abdul Fatah al-Sisi in April 2013. As the deadline of the Armed Forces's ultimatum approached on 3 July, there was renewed expectation of an increase in violence, according to the media. As in other days, there were both anti- Morsi and pro-Morsi protests, the latter particularly in Nasr City and near Cairo University. Army tanks were reported to surround two smaller pro-Morsi rallies as the demonstrators vowed to defend the government with their lives. As the 16:35 deadline set by the army approached, the coalition met with the military leaders for emergency talks, with the expectation that the army would issue a statement when the deadline passed. Mohamed El-Baradei, who was chosen to represent the National Salvation Front, was also said to have met army chief General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. On same day just before the deadline approached, Morsi offered to form a consensus government. An army statement read: \\"The General Command of the Armed Forces is currently meeting with a number of religious, national, political and youth icons...There will be a statement issued from the General Command as soon as they are done.\\" At the same time the Freedom and Justice Party's senior leader, Waleed al-Haddad, said: \\"We do not go to invitations (meetings) with anyone. We have a president and that is it.\\" At about 17:30 Mohammed Zaki, Leader of Republic Guards, joined Morsi with some of the Republic Guards officers and conducted the arrest. It was reported from Morsi's assistant Yahya Hamed the flow of conversation took place as Morsi saying \\"Mohammed (Leader of Republic Guards) you know well you are going to be trailed for that.\\" and Mohammed Zaki replying: \\"I know, however I had already told them I don't want in, because of my special good relations with the president.\\"  3 July military coup  On 3 July, General Abdel Fattah Saeed Hussein Khalil el-Sisi, Commander-in- Chief of the Egyptian Armed Forces, announced that there would be new presidential and Shura Council elections. The coalition appointed Chief Justice Adly Mansour as the interim president and charged him with forming a transitional technocratic government. Military vehicles drove throughout Cairo. Morsi was put under house arrest, and was believed to be at the Republican Guard barracks. According to other sources he was taken to a military base and his travel was restricted. Army troops and tanks were reported to have surrounded key facilities and installations. At noon, the Republican Guard, who had Morsi in their care, left his side to allow Army commandos to take him to an undisclosed Ministry of Defence building. He offered no resistance. General al-Sisi said: \\"The president's speech last night failed to meet and conform with the demands [of the people, prompting the armed forces to consult] with some of the symbols of the national forces and the youths without excluding anyone. [They agreed on a road map] that includes initial steps that realize the building of a strong and coherent Egyptian society that does not exclude any of its sons and currents and that end the state of conflict and division.\\" He added the army was standing apart from the political process but was using its vision as the Egyptian people were calling for help and discharged its responsibility. Al-Sisi named former Chief Justice Adli Mansour as the interim president and added that he would be sworn in on 4 July. The Shura Council was also dissolved. Morsi condemned his removal as a \\"full coup\\" by the general. He also urged everyone to \\"adhere to peacefulness and avoid shedding blood of fellow countrymen.\\" The Office of Assistant to President of Egypt on Foreign Relations called Morsi's removal a \\"military coup\\", and said \\"there is no democracy without the ballot box\\".Murphy, Dan. \\"Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood and Morsi have their backs to the wall,\\" The Christian Science Monitor, 3 July 2013 The announcement of the removal of Morsi was met with cheers in Tahrir Square. Anti-Morsi protesters shouted \\"Allahu akbar\\" and \\"Long live Egypt\\" and launched fireworks as green laser lights held by those in the crowd lit the sky. Mohamed el-Baradei says the coup was to rectify the issues of the revolution. The Coptic Pope Tawadros II, Grand Imam of al-Azhar Ahmed el-Tayeb, Mohamed ElBaradei and some of the youth leaders of Tamarod, Mahmoud Badr and Mohamed Abdelaziz, spoke in support of the military intervention. The al-Nour party also commented in saying that the events occurred as they were not heard in their call for dialogue. Party Secretary-General Galal Murra commented that: \\"we took this position (on agreeing to the army political road map) and we took these decisions only so we stop the bloodshed of our people.\\" Pro-Morsi protesters heard a statement from Morsi, which was published on his Facebook page. He called the move a \\"coup\\" and rejected the Armed Forces' statement. The Freedom and Justice Party's Gamal Heshmat said: \\"There is absolutely no direction towards violence. The Brotherhood are not raised on violence. Their cause is a peaceful one, defending their rights, which is stronger than a \\"military coup\\". The army has perpetrated a \\"shameful coup\\". We are still in the street, we still don't know if all of the armed forces will accept what Sisi has done.\\" A party spokesman said that what started as a military coup was \\"turning into something much more.\\" The National Salvation Front, an alliance of multiple political parties, stated on 4 July that \\"what Egypt is witnessing now is not a military coup by any standards. It was a necessary decision that the Armed Forces' leadership took to protect democracy, maintain the country's unity and integrity, restore stability and get back on track towards achieving the goals of the 25 January Revolution.\\" =Arrests= According to Morsi, he was kidnapped by the Armed Forces and held at the Republican Guard headquarters one day before the army announced his removal, and held there until 5 July 2013, after which he and his aide were forcibly moved to a naval base for the next four months. His family had stated earlier Morsi was kidnapped on 3 July 2013. The spokesperson of the Egyptian Armed Forces, Colonel Ahmed Ali later denied allegations that Morsi was badly treated, saying they had nothing to hide. The Egyptian Army later gave Catherine Ashton the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy for the European Union permission to meet Morsi. Ashton later stated that Morsi was doing well: \\"Morsi was keeping up with the latest developments in the country through television and newspapers. So we were able to talk about the situation, and we were able to talk about the need to move forward. The people around him do care for him. I looked at the facilities.\\" Morsi could later meet an African Union delegation too. Morsi supporter after mass killings in Cairo, 27 July 2013 The army arrested the former speaker of parliament and the head of Freedom and Justice Party Saad El-Katatni, along with Rashad al-Bayoumi, a Muslim Brotherhood deputy, as well as other top leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood. Al-Jazeera quoted unnamed security officials saying that \\"more than a dozen\\" members of the Muslim Brotherhood had been arrested, while Al-Ahram reported that the Egyptian police had been ordered to arrest more than 300 members of the Muslim Brotherhood. A travel ban was also put on Morsi, the head of his Muslim Brotherhood Mohammed Badie, Badie's deputy Khairat El-Shater, the Muslim Brotherhood's former leader Mahdi Akef, another Muslim Brotherhood figure Mohamed Beltagy, Salafi preacher close to the Muslim Brotherhood Safwat Hegazi and the leader of the al-Wasat Party Abou Elela Mady and his deputy Essam Sultan. Badie and Akef were arrested for \\"incitement to murder.\\" Following Morsi's ouster, pro-Morsi supporters still gathered in Cairo said that they would undo the \\"coup\\" and continued their allegiance to Morsi saying that they would \\"defend the integrity of the ballot box.\\" Amidst threats of violence, Al Jazeera English reported the death of four people from a Muslim Brotherhood stronghold near the Libyan border. In December 2013, Morsi as well as high-echelon Muslim Brotherhood leaders were charged with \\"terrorism and plotting with foreign militants against Egypt\\" while the Muslim brotherhood was officially classified as a terrorist group. By May 2014, approximately 16,000 people, mostly Brotherhood members or supporters, have been imprisoned since the coup.Hang them all? Mass death sentences may not be carried out, but horrify all the same , economist.com. =Media restrictions and violence against journalists= Police and military forces made statements against four television channels and took them off the air. Misr 25, a channel owned by the Muslim Brotherhood, was shut down and officials said that journalists working for the channel were arrested. The Al Hafez and Al Nas channels were shut down as well. A few hours later, Al Jazeera's Mubasher Misr, which had been criticised for its alleged pro-Morsi slant, was also taken off the air, its offices raided and its employees detained. Five staff were arrested, including managing director Ayman Gaballah, who was still in custody after the others were released. It was also prevented from broadcasting a pro-Morsi rally in northern Cairo. Associated Press Television News was ordered not to provide Al Jazeera with footage of protests in the country or with any filming equipment, while the Cairo News Company was warned against providing broadcasting equipment. Al Jazeera Media Network's acting Director General Mostafa Souag condemned the move, saying \\"regardless of political views, the Egyptian people expect media freedoms to be respected and upheld. Media offices should not be subject to raids and intimidation. Journalists should not be detained for doing their jobs.\\" The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) reported that two journalists and one student were killed while covering Egyptian unrest in the two weeks leading up to 8 July 2013. According to CPJ research, before those deaths only four journalists had been killed in Egypt since 1992. One of the journalists killed while documenting the 2013 clashes was 26-year-old photographer Ahmed Assem el-Senousy, also known as Ahmed Samir Assem. The photographer was shot by a sniper after he recorded security forces firing on protestors. According to media reports, el-Senousy may have captured his own death on film. A video clip posted on his Facebook page shows a sniper firing on crowds before turning toward the camera, at which point the clip abruptly ends. While reporting for the BBC, journalist Jeremy Bowen was hit in the head with birdshot fired by Egyptian security forces on 5 July.

In Qena, security forces opened fire on protesters trying to storm a security building, injuring two of them. Shots were also fired in Alexandria. This occurred as tens of thousands of Egyptians took to the street to condemn the coup and support Morsi. Despite claiming to respect all sides, the military also issued a statement warning Islamists who planned on protesting. Tamarod, which had organised anti-Morsi protests, called for protests to \\"protect the revolution.\\" During the night pro and anti-Morsi demonstrators clashed over the 6th October Bridge; at least two people were killed and more than 70 people were injured, according to state television, who quoted medical personnel at a makeshift hospital in the square.

In mid-August, the violence against Islamists by the army escalated further, with at least hundreds killed, and the government declaring a month-long nighttime curfew. Following the mid-August incidents and the imposition of a state of emergency, security forces targeted the Brotherhood and its allies with a wave of arrests of leaders and senior members. =14 August crackdown= Bodies of pro-Morsi demonstrators On 14 August 2013, Egyptian security forces raided two camps of protesters in Cairo: one at al-Nahda Square and a larger one at Rabaa al- Adawiya Mosque. The two sites had been occupied by supporters of ousted President Mohamed Morsi, who was removed from office by the military after mass street protests for and against his rule. The camps were raided after initiatives to end the six-week sit-ins failed and as a result of the raids the camps were cleared out within hours. The Interior Minister Mohamed Ibrahim announced that police used water hoses to disperse the campers. Yet, all videos and photos from the scenes of the raids never showed water or hoses. Tents and bodies were on fire, and the main mosque of Rabaa Al-Adawiya was burned with hundreds of unidentified bodies. According to Human Rights Watch at least 904 people were killed in what was described as crimes against humanity. However, the Egyptian Health Ministry claimed 638 people were killed and at least 3,994 injured. According to the National Coalition for Supporting Legitimacy (NCSL), the number of deaths from the Rabaa al-Adawiya Mosque sit- in alone were some 2,600. Violent retaliation followed in several cities across the country. The military appointed interim government declared a month-long state of emergency in response and curfews were instituted in many areas. The total casualty count made 14 August the deadliest day since the 2011 Egyptian revolution which toppled former President Hosni Mubarak. The violent dispersals carried out by the security forces were widely denounced by world leaders, with the exception of Gulf Arab states: the U.A.E., Saudi Arabia, and Bahrain. A study conducted by the Egyptian Centre for Media Studies and Public Opinion revealed that 79% of Egyptians believe the massacres on 14 August were crimes against humanity. 73% hold General Al Sisi, the Defence Minister, responsible for the massacres. Another poll by Egyptian Centre for Public Opinion Research later showed that 67 percent of Egyptians were satisfied about the method in which the Rabaa al-Adaweya and Nahda sit- ins were dispersed. On 10 December, thirteen Egyptian and international human rights organizations urged Cairo's interim authorities to probe the mass killing of protesters in the capital on 14 August. The joint call issued by organizations that included Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, said an investigation must be launched into the killing of \\"up to 1,000 people by security forces\\" almost four months ago when they dispersed sit-ins by supporters of deposed president Mohamed Morsi. \\"There can be no hope for the rule of law and political stability in Egypt, much less some modicum of justice for victims, without accountability for what may be the single biggest incident of mass killing in Egypt's recent history,\\" said Gasser Abdel-Razak, associate director at the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights. \\"As a first step toward accountability, the government should establish an effective independent fact- finding committee to investigate responsibility throughout the chain of command for the unlawful killings,\\" the rights groups said. They said that on 14 August a \\"small minority of protesters used firearms... but the police responded excessively by shooting recklessly, going far beyond what is permitted under international law.\\" \\"After the unprecedented levels of violence and casualties seen since the ousting of Mohamed Morsi, investigations must provide real answers and cannot be another whitewash of the security forces' record,\\" Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui of Amnesty International said in the statement. \\"Egypt's authorities cannot deal with the carnage through PR in world's capitals, rewriting events and locking up Morsi's supporters.\\" The groups also said the probe should determine whether there is any evidence of a policy to kill protesters or commit other serious crimes. =Violence against Coptic Christians= Since Morsi's overthrow, Egypt's Christian minority, a reported 6 to 12% of the population, have been the target of sectarian divide tactics by unidentified groups.Hendawi, Hamza.

In 2011, Egypt opened a probe on former Interior Minister Habib el-Adly's reported role in the New Year's Eve bombing of al-Qiddissin Church in Alexandria in which twenty-four people were killed. According to the UK diplomatic sources quoted in the reports, the former interior ministry had masterminded the deadly church attack with the intent to blame it on Islamists, escalate government crackdown on them, and gain increased western support for the regime. The former interior minister had built up in over six years a special security system that was managed by twenty-two officers and that employed a number of former radical Islamists, drug dealers and some security firms to carry out acts of sabotage around the country in case the regime was under threat to collapse. The proclamation also pointed, sourcing reports on UK intelligence services, that interior ministry officer Maj. Fathi Abdelwahid began on 11 December 2011, preparing Ahmed Mohamed Khaled, who had spent eleven years in Egyptian prisons, to contact an extremist group named Jundullah and coordinate with it the attack on the Alexandria church. Khaled reportedly told the group he could assist with providing weapons he had allegedly obtained from Gaza and that the act was meant to \\"discipline the Copts.\\" =Other incidents= The day after the coup, militant gunmen staged multiple attacks on security forces in the Sinai and Suez. One soldier was killed and two others were wounded at a police station near the local headquarters of military intelligence in Rafah as it was attacked by rocket fire. Attackers also fired rocket-propelled grenades at army checkpoints guarding El Arish airport. A protest by hundreds of people occurred in Al- Arish the day after the ouster with calls to form a war council to combat the army. Ten areas in north Sinai were witness to clashes, including the Central Security Force camp and a number of checkpoints along the ring road. The airport was also closed after being targeted by unidentified armed men. In late July 2013 the Egyptian military reportedly launched \\"Operation Sinai\\" in an effort to quash the militants.

Some media reports refer to the events as another \\"revolution\\" and there has been debate as to whether events are best named as being a coup or not. Others Egyptian Americans, particularly in the Arab-dominated areas of Michigan, had mixed views of the event with some wary of the Muslim Brotherhood, but also wary of usurping democratic rights following a 30-year dictatorship.

An English landscape garden with a small pond adjoins the lodge. Just beyond the pond is a grotto flanked by two portals. These early Baroque portals were installed in 1758 and were probably created between 1604 and 1606 for the B√ºckeburg Palace's first- floor great hall. In 1776, Wilhelm zu Schaumburg Lippe built a step pyramid family mausoleum in the park near the lodge. Its entrance consists of an eastern-facing portico portal. Originally, ornamental plants were placed along the pyramid's stepped sides. The mausoleum was situated initially in a hedge garden which was later converted into a wooded park with alleyways.Sascha Winter: Grabmalkultur und Gartenkunst um 1800. In: Grabkultur in Deutschland.

Today, the hunting lodge serves as the conference and recreation center for the Landeskirche Schaumburg-Lippes Protestant youth group, Evangelische Jugend, as well as an educational center offering seminars, lectures, and holiday and weekend programs.

Maxwell and Djerassi had one son, Alexander, born that same year. The couple later divorced, in 1989. Maxwell married dot-com entrepreneur David Hayden in 1990. The marriage deteriorated in 1996 and later ended in divorce. In 2007, Maxwell married Al Seckel, but this marriage was not official, as Seckel was still legally married to his previous wife. Maxwell and Seckel moved to France from Malibu, California, sometime around 2010, to care for Maxwell's ailing mother. They lived in Chateau de la Malartrie in La Roque-Gageac, and acquired thousands of stone-age tools to sell in the U.S. In December 2015, after Seckel's death, Maxwell was declared bankrupt by a British court.\\"Isabel Sylvia Margaret Maxwell--Bankruptcy Orders\\", The London Gazette, Nov. 13, 2105 References =Sources= *https://archive.today/20130701061134/http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:Wqex6Jwe6C4J:www.maxwell- communications.com/isabel.htm+&cd;=12&hl;=en&ct;=clnk‚â∑=us *http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/features/8376875/Whatever-happened-to-the- Maxwells.html External links *Isabel Maxwell's Blog Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:French people of Czech-Jewish descent Category:French people of Ukrainian-Jewish descent Category:British people of Czech-Jewish descent Category:British people of Ukrainian-Jewish descent Category:Alumni of the University of Edinburgh Category:Technology company founders Category:Women business executives Category:French women in business Category:French businesspeople Category:Women philanthropists Category:Maxwell family ","title":"Isabel Maxwell"},{"id":"39823036","text":"Herna√≠n Arz√∫ G√ºity (born 13 October 1967) is a retired Honduran football player who made his name with the national team in the 1990s.

Constructed in 1857, the site remains typical of period farmsteads, and it has been named a historic site. William Baumgardner was one of Miami County's wealthiest farmers, and his landholdings were among the county's widest. He was able to pay for the construction of the entire complex in 1857, including the house, a separate summer kitchen, one large barn for animal shelter and hay storage, a granary, a spring house, a barn for seed storage, and a carriage house. Comparatively few changes have been made to the complex, which accordingly remains among the region's best- preserved farmsteads from the middle of the nineteenth century.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 2. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 1003. Baumgardner's house is a two-story brick building placed on a stone foundation. Chimneys sit on either end of the roofline, which is created by gables on either side. Both the side and the facade comprise three bays, with the middle bay of the facade occupied by a portico-sheltered door on the first story and a secondary door opening onto the portico roof on the second story. A single-story extension sits at the rear,, Ohio Historical Society, 2007. Accessed 2014-02-23. causing the general floor plan to have the shape of the letter \\"T\\". Inside, the original features are still present. Buildings throughout the complex possess decorative features such as cupolas and miniature gables, giving the farmstead an appearance of architectural harmony. None of the buildings in the farmstead have been moved since their construction. In early 1978, the Baumgardner Farm was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying both because of its place in local history and because of its historically significant architecture. The complex comprises six contributing properties, all of which are buildings. The complex is one of three National Register-listed locations near New Carlisle, along with Olive Branch High School and Ollie's Tavern in Clark County to the east.

It advocates the use of genetics in genealogical research, provides educational resources for genealogists interested in DNA testing, and facilitates networking among genetic genealogists. See Homepage, Our Mission and About ISOGG. , it comprises over 8,000 members in 70 countries. , regional meetings are coordinated by 20 volunteer regional coordinators located in the United States, Australia, Brazil, Canada, England, Egypt, Ireland and Russia. ISOGG hosts the ISOGG Wiki, a free online encyclopedia maintained by ISOGG members which contains a wide variety of educational resources and guidance for genetic genealogy consumers and DNA project administrators. The ISOGG Wiki contains ethical guidelines for DNA project administrators and ISOGG members perform peer reviews of DNA project websites of other members on request, following which the websites may display the ISOGG Peer Reviewed graphic. Industry regulation and standards In 2008 ISOGG supported the passing of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act designed to prohibit the improper use of genetic information in health insurance and employment in the United States. At an FDA public meeting on oversight of laboratory developed tests, ISOGG opposed FDA regulations preventing consumer access to DTC testing. An article published in Genetics in Medicine in March 2012 provides an overview of the diverse array of tests and practices in the emerging DTC genetic genealogy industry. In the article, the authors highlight ISOGG's potential role in developing industry best practice guidelines and consumer guidance: The increasing affordability and popularity of DTC genetic genealogy testing has also raised ethical concerns about genealogists testing the DNA of others without consent. The ISOGG Wiki contains a selection of external resources on ethics for genetic genealogists. =Y-STR nomenclature= ISOGG promotes the adoption of voluntary industry Y-STR nomenclature standards developed by NIST and published in the Journal of Genetic Genealogy in 2008. Citizen science ISOGG members such as Leo Little, Roberta Estes, Rebekah Canada and Bonnie Schrack have been involved in important citizen science discoveries regarding human phylogeny and ethnic origins. The broader ISOGG membership participated in the Genographic Project, a genetic anthropology study that used crowdsourcing to facilitate new discoveries about human genetic history, and other genetic databases where broader and larger databases aid the identification of participants' ancestral origins. =Y chromosome phylogenetic tree= Since 2006 ISOGG has hosted the regularly updated online ISOGG Y-chromosome phylogenetic tree.

It was aired on June 3, 2013. The episode was written by Anupam Nigam & Amanda Alpert Muscat and it was directed by Andy Wolk. Plot Irisa (Stephanie Leonidas) has another vision in which Sukar (Noah Danby) dies. After the vision she and Nolan (Grant Bowler) go to find Sukar and Irisa's vision is confirmed since Sukar was killed by a falling object from the sky. Irisa and Nolan, seeing the object, realize that it was part of an approaching razor rain storm, a storm that endangers Defiance. They have to inform everyone in town that the storm is not a simple one. Nolan returns to Defiance but Irisa stays back for Sukar's sinking ritual (his body will be consumed in an acid bath). Sukar, right after they sink his body in the acid, rises fully healed and the Spirit Riders are confused because they do not know what happened. Sukar says that he is driven by God Irzu and he is on a mission but the other Irathients have doubts about it. He and Irisa return to Defiance, where Sukar starts collecting different objects for unknown reason. Irisa does not know what and why he is doing this, but she tries to help him. Alak (Jesse Rath) and Cristie (Nicole Mu√±oz) discuss a bathing ceremony that Stahma (Jaime Murray) asked Christie to do with the family. Christie does not feel comfortable doing it and she argues about it with Alak. At the end, Alak agrees to talk to his parents and tell them that Christie will not join the ceremony. Stahma goes to \\"Need/Want\\" bar to ask Kenya (Mia Kirshner) about her services for her son Alak before the wedding, so he will be prepared. She is concerned about it since humans and Castithans are very different. Kenya refuses politely and explains to Stahma that a human girl would not like her husband to be with a prostitute. While having a conversation over drinks, Stahma opens up to Kenya and the two of them end up in an intimate encounter. In the meantime, Nicky (Fionnula Flanagan), not having any news from Birch, arrives at the McCawley home to find out what happened. Quentin (Justin Rain) reluctantly admits to his father Rafe (Graham Greene) that he killed Birch when Birch broke into their home and attacked him. He does not tell him though that he kept the artifact. Nicky, suspecting that Birch is dead, tricks Rafe into revealing that Birch was killed when he broke into their home, but Rafe takes the blame to protect his son. In the meantime, Quentin has another \\"vision\\" of his brother Luke (Wesley French), who tells him that he should kill Nicky too because she knows everything, but Quentin refuses. Meanwhile, Sukar finds all the items he needs and he and Irisa take over the radio station. Nolan gets there right after them thinking that Sukar wants to direct a falling Ark to Defiance. The falling Ark, if it impacts on Defiance, will destroy the city completely and everyone will die. He attempts to stop him by shooting him and throwing him from the Gateway Arch. Irisa however, who does not believe that Sukar wanted to destroy Defiance, completes his task and activates the transmission. It is discovered that Sukar only wanted to change the direction of the falling Ark to save Defiance. Doctor Yewll (Trenna Keating), while examining Sukar, finds out why Sukar \\"rose\\" and why he was healing so fast. It was not because of the God Irzu but because of little robots called nanites that were injected into his body by the razor rain object. Now that Defiance is safe, the nanites have gone dormant, and will no longer heal Sukar's injuries. Sukar survived the fall from the Arch, but he is paralyzed and in coma.  Feature music  In the \\"Goodbye Blue Sky\\" we can hear the songs: * \\"Into the Mystic\\" by Michael McDonald * \\"Into the Mystic\\" by Jen Chapin * \\"Eclipse/Blue\\" by Nosaj Thing * \\"Happy\\" by Field Mouse Reception =Ratings= In its original American broadcast, \\"Goodbye Blue Sky\\" was watched by 1.69 million; down 0.26 from the previous episode. =Reviews= \\"Goodbye Blue Sky\\" received mediocre/positive reviews. Rowan Kaiser from The A.V. Club gave a C grade to the episode saying that despite there were some cool moments and interesting ideas on it, it was not serving a larger purpose. \\"‚ÄúGood Bye Blue Sky‚Äù isn't notably worse than several previous episodes of Defiance, but it frustrated me much more than those did. There are some cool moments, some disjointed ones, a lot of interesting ideas, and a famous song covered at the end. I normally enjoy that. But my problem with this episode is that it doesn't serve a larger purpose.\\" Lisa Macklem from Spoiler TV stated that the episode is particularly well-written. \\"I really enjoyed the peeling away of more layers on the show this week. The episode did a good job in illustrating that the tensions don‚Äôt just occur between human and Votans ‚Äì though it‚Äôs understandable that those relationships pose the most opportunity for misunderstanding.\\" Jim Garner from TV Fanatic rated the episode with 3/5. \\"Defiance this week didn't so much feature a single main story, but instead focused on three arcs.

Activities SKEPP gets most of its funding from member fees. On the initiative of board member and former editor- in-chief Tom Schoepen, SKEPP has been publishing its own three-monthly magazine since 2000, Wonder en is gheen wonder, a magazine for science and reason, which focuses on both pseudoscientific topics and topics related to the philosophy of science. The editors include Prof. Dr. Johan Braeckman (Ghent University), Dr. Griet Vandermassen (Ghent University), Geerdt Magiels and SKEPP founder Tim Trachet. In 2012, SKEPP hosted a series of lectures and discussions, featuring prominent scientists and philosophers, under the name Het Denkgelag, which has since grown out to become an independent non-profit that organises skeptical conferences. In 2015, SKEPP hosted the meant-to-be- yearly event \\"Zomerschool Kritisch Denken\\" (Summerschool Critical Thinking) aimed at educational professionals. Currently, SKEPP organises the monthly local editions of Skeptics in the Pub in Ghent, Antwerp and Leuven. Since 1996 SKEPP gives out annual awards to non-members: the Zesde vijs (the ‚ÄúSixth Screw‚Äù) and the Skeptische Put (de ‚ÄúSkeptical Pit‚Äù). The Zesde Vijs is awarded to \\"someone who has distinguished themselves in the past year in spreading objective knowledge regarding pseudoscience and the paranormal, or who has made themselves noticed in the media by presenting a nuanced critical view or a thoroughly documented argumentation\\". This prize has been awarded to, among others: * Stijn Bruers (2015) * Maggie De Block (2014) * Marleen Finoulst (2013) * Ruben Mersch (2012) * The Science Editorial Staff of the Flemish daily newspaper De Standaard (2011) * The TV program Ook getest op mensen, VRT - E√©n (2010) * Ilse van Lysebeth and Ellen Vermeulen (2009) * Bruno Cl√©ment from the RTBF current affairs program Questions √† la Une (2008) * Jan Vanlangendonck from the Flemish radio channel Radio 1 (2007) * Journalist and philosopher Jo√´l de Ceulaer from the Flemish magazine Knack (2005) * Journalist Mark Eeckhaut from De Standaard (2004) * Former dean of Ghent University Prof. Dr. Andreas De Leenheer (2003) * Communication scientists Prof. Dr. Els De Bens and Dr. Karin Raeymaeckers (2002) * The Flemish radio program Jongens en Wetenschap (2001) * Journalist Wim Daems from the Belgian science magazine Eos (1999) * Dutch psychologist Hans Crombach (1998) * Physicist Jean Bricmont (1997) * Historian and moral philosopher Prof. Dr. Gie van den Berghe (1996) The Skeptische Put is awarded to \\"someone who, according to SKEPP, has displayed exceptionally uncritical thinking and who has totally misunderstood the popularization of science and knowledge\\". The Skeptische Put has been awarded to, among others: * Jan Allein (2014) * Peter Vereecke (2013) * Patrick Geryl (2012) * Chris Vermeire (2010) * Chris Gaublomme, voorzitter vzw Preventie Vaccinatieschade (2009) * Peter Aelbrecht (2008) * Vijf TV - My mind and body (2007) * The three major Belgian health insurance organizations: , en (2003), * Journalist Willem J.

They are often called upon to present their critical perspective on paranormal or pseudoscientific topics. In 2004 the organization made headlines when thirty skeptics at Ghent University conducted a ‚Äúmass suicide‚Äù attempt by taking an overdose of homeopathically diluted snake venom, belladonna, and arsenic. The goal of this action was to demonstrate that homeopathic products contain no active ingredients. Additionally, the Belgian health insurance organization were accused of putting themselves above the law as commercial entities by reimbursing alternative treatments. According to SKEPP, by reimbursing alternative treatments, health insurance organizations will give the impression to the Belgian public that these are effective medications or treatments. In 2014, the Belgian court of appeal in Brussels proved SKEPP right against the appeal of the Dutch physician Robert G√∂rter, who was called a quack by the organization in 2004. The One Million Euro Sisyphus Prize Since 1 October 2012 the organization has pledged to award the 1-million-euro Sisyphus prize, to anyone who can demonstrate paranormal abilities under controlled conditions. This includes paranormal phenomena as well as homeopathy. The same challenge is also offered by various other European skeptical organizations and serves as the equivalent of the American One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge, which was offered by the James Randi Educational Foundation. As of 8 March 2014, its website describes the prize as \\"the 25 000 euro prize\\". Applying for the prize would cost 50 euro. It informs that \\"the text and protocol are being rewritten and will soon be available again\\".

The barony, with six knight's fiefs attached to it, was given to a lord known in the Greek and Italian versions of the Chronicle of the Morea only as William, but whose family name is given by Angevin records as Morlay.Miller (1921), pp. 71‚Äì72Bon (1969), pp. 111‚Äì112, 523 William was succeeded by his son Hugh‚Äîalthough Karl Hopf suggested the interposition of a second William after the original founder for chronological reasons‚Äîand then, around 1280, by Androuin de Villiers or de Villa, who had married Hugh's sister Sachette.Bon (1969), pp. 112, 160, 523 Nikli, known in Antiquity as Tegea, is located on the southern Arcadian plain and was conquered by the Franks after a siege sometime before 1209; at the time it was a town of some importance and the seat of a bishopric, which was taken over by a Latin bishop until 1222, when it was abolished and joined to that of Lacedaemon.Bon (1969), pp. 522‚Äì523 Nikli's location made it an excellent assembly point for armies, as well as for parliaments like the famous \\"Ladies' Parliament\\" in 1261, but after 1262, when the Byzantines recovered parts of the southeastern Peloponnese, the barony became a battleground, and by the early 1270s, Nikli was permanently garrisoned to prevent the Byzantines from breaking out of their territory in Laconia into the central Arcadian plateau.Bon (1969), pp. 131, 142, 144, 145 Nikli was still in Frankish hands in 1280, but was lost to the resurgent Byzantines sometime after. The Aragonese version of the Chronicle states that the Byzantines occupied the town in 1296, but, it being indefensible on account of its location on the plain, they preferred to destroy and abandon it. The region seems to have remained under Frankish control for a few years after that, but by 1302, it was definitely in Byzantine hands.Bon (1969), pp. 112, 146, 182, 523‚Äì524 References Sources * * Category:States and territories established in 1209 Category:States and territories disestablished in the 1290s Category:Medieval Arcadia Category:Baronies of the Principality of Achaea ","title":"Barony of Nikli"},{"id":"39823393","title":"2005 Four Nations Tournament (women's football)"},{"id":"39823396","text":"Strava is an internet service for tracking human exercise which incorporates social network features. It is mostly used for cycling and running using GPS data. Strava uses a freemium model with some features only available in the paid subscription plan (formerly called Strava Premium and then Strava Summit). Strava Metro, a program marketed towards city planners, uses cycling data from Strava users in supported cities and regions. The service was founded in 2009 by Mark Gainey and Michael Horvath and is based in San Francisco, California. During the early years of Strava, both founders held CEO positions before being succeeded by James Quarles who joined from Instagram. In November 2019 Michael Horvath returned as CEO, and with a more innovation and athlete focussed approach led the company to a 35% growth in user numbers to 68 million in just 6 months. Strava has not published numbers of its user base and paying users, although the service claimed in 2018 that it was adding one million new users every 45 days, with 8 million activities uploaded each day. Overview Strava depends on GPS, in mobile phones or other GPS-enabled devices, to record supported activities which can be shared among user's followers or shared publicly. If an activity is publicly shared, Strava automatically groups activities together, when they occur at the same time and place (for example, taking part in a marathon/sportive or group run/ride). Each activity, depending on which activity selected, shows users' activity results, including route summary in map view form, elevation (net and unidirectional), speed (average, min/max), timing (total and moving time), power (with optional accessory) and heart rate (with optional accessory). Users may also give other users' activities \\"kudos\\", which functions as a like button, as well as leave comments. Strava Slide is a fork of iD Editor for OpenStreetMap, which allows map editors to draw roads and trails more accurately using the same aggregated and anonymized GPS data. Cycling and running traffic may be monitored by everyone on the Strava Heatmap page which shows a global heatmap. In July 2015, Strava switched to Mapbox maps and imagery, based on OpenStreetMap data. Strava allows users to report issues with the maps, which are linked to the OpenStreetMap editor so that users can contribute improvements to the map. Gran Fondo challenge \\"badge\\" for November 2018. Strava has a Trophy system in the form of periodic challenges that require completing either a running or cycling activity within a certain range of distance or elevation. Each activity has its own trophy badge shown in the Strava Trophy case and limited rewards if the Challenge is held by Strava partners. Paid features In July 2018, Strava discontinued its Strava Premium subscription system and announced its replacement, Strava Summit, which divides Strava Premium benefits into three different categories, * Training  Custom Goals  Custom Leader-board  Training Plans  Race Analysis  Segment Effort * Safety  Personal Heatmaps  Beacon * Analysis  Power Analysis  Workout Analysis  Live Segments  Relative Effort Strava Summit includes a \\"Suffer Score\\" if heart rate data is available during an activity. The Suffer Score allows Strava to rank user activities, which is used for Strava's Training Plans and customized goals. Other features of the subscription include Beacon, live location tracking of the athlete for family and trusted friends, Live Performance Data and Live Segments, used to check real time information and compare athlete's best available record in Strava, and Strava Premium only Leader-board, Power Meter Analysis, Race Analysis, Workout Analysis, GPX Export, Personal Heatmap and Trophy Case. On 18 May 2020, Strava announced that the \\"Summit\\" branding had been dropped for the subscription service, and that personal Live Segments leaderboards on the service or on supported devices, use of the route builder, and matched runs would now require a subscription to access. In addition, third-party apps are no longer allowed API access to leaderboards. Integration Exercises can be recorded using the mobile app, or third-party devices such as Garmin and Wahoo bike computers or smartwatches. Controversies In November 2017, Strava published a \\"Global Heatmap\\"‚Äîa \\"visualization of two years of trailing data from Strava's global network of athletes.\\" In January 2018, an Australian National University student studying international security discovered that this map had mapped military bases, including known U.S. bases in Syria, and forward operating bases in Afghanistan, and HMNB Clyde‚Äîa Royal Navy base that contains the United Kingdom's nuclear arsenal. The findings led to continued scrutiny over privacy issues associated with fitness services and other location-aware applications; Strava's CEO James Quarles stated that the company was \\"committed to working with military and government officials\\" on the issue, and would be reviewing its features and simplifying its privacy settings. Although users can now opt out of having their data aggregated on the global heatmap, the original data that contains sensitive information has been archived on GitHub. In July 2019, Strava terminated access to its APIs to Relive‚Äîa service that allows fitness data to be combined with multimedia to generate video recaps. Strava considered this to be in violation of its terms of service, which forbids the API's use with services that \\"replicate Strava sites, services or products\\", and the combination of \\"Strava data\\" with any other customer data. Relive had recently introduced social networking features; the features were subsequently removed, but Strava did not reverse its decision. DC Rainmaker disputed the decision, presenting an opinion that \\"Strava data\\" constituted personally-identifiable information under the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), meaning that users had rights to control how it is used by Strava‚Äîincluding third-party processing that they had already agreed to by linking Relive to Strava, and noted other examples of similar services (such as Trailforks) engaging in similar if not more extensive use of \\"Strava data\\", and that Strava had previously endorsed Relive on several occasions. In October 2019, Strava announced that Bluetooth and ANT+ sensors would no longer pair directly with the Strava mobile app which caused some consternation from its users. In October 2020, Strava turned their Flyby feature off by default due to privacy concerns. The feature allowed users to see the routes of other users that they passed by on their route, which raised concerns that it could be used to track other users' daily routines. Flyby may still be enabled by the user if desired.

Most of these captives were forced into Christianity during the era of American slavery; however, there are records of individuals such as Omar ibn Said living the rest of their lives as Muslims in the United States.Samuel S. Hill, Charles H. Lippy, Charles Reagan Wilson. Encyclopedia of religion in the South. Mercer University Press (2005), p. 394. . During the twentieth century, some African Americans converted to Islam, mainly through the influence of black nationalist groups that preached with distinctive Islamic practices including the Moorish Science Temple of America, founded in 1913, and the Nation of Islam, founded in the 1930s, which attracted at least 20,000 people by 1963. Prominent members included activist Malcolm X and boxer Muhammad Ali.Jacob Neusner, World Religions in America: An Introduction, Westminster John Knox Press (2003), pp. 180‚Äì181. . The Indian-originated Ahmadiyya Muslim movement also sought converts among African Americans in the 1920s and 1930s. Malcolm X is considered the first person to start the movement among African Americans towards mainstream Islam, after he left the Nation and made the pilgrimage to Mecca.William W. Sales (1994). From Civil Rights to Black Liberation: Malcolm X and the Organization of Afro-American Unity. South End Press, p. 37. . In 1975, Warith Deen Mohammed, the son of Elijah Muhammad took control of the Nation after his father's death and guided the majority of its members to orthodox Islam.Uzra Zeya (1990-01) Islam in America: The Growing Presence of American Converts to Islam Washington Report on Middle East Reports. Retrieved November 16, 2009. However, a few members rejected these changes, in particular Louis Farrakhan, who revived the Nation of Islam in 1978 based largely on the ideals of its founder, Wallace Fard Muhammad. Demographics African-American Muslims constitute 20% of the total U.S. Muslim population. The majority are orthodox Sunni Muslims; a substantial proportion of these identify under the community of W. Deen Mohammed. The Nation of Islam led by Louis Farrakhan has a membership ranging from 20,000‚Äì50,000 members. Sects Noble Drew Ali of the Moorish Science Temple of America. During the first half of the 20th century, a small number of African Americans established groups based on Islamic and Gnostic teachings. The first of these groups was the Moorish Science Temple of America, founded by Timothy Drew (Drew Ali) in 1913. Drew taught that black people were of Moorish origin but their Muslim identity was taken away through slavery and racial segregation, advocating the return to Islam of their Moorish ancestry.Moorish Science Temple of America Britannica Online Encyclopedia. Retrieved November 13, 2009. =Sunni Islam= Sunni is a term derived from sunnah (ÿ≥ŸèŸÜŸéŸëÿ© /Ààsunna/, plural ÿ≥ŸèŸÜŸéŸÜ sunan /Ààsunan/) meaning \\"habit\\", \\"usual practice\\", \\"custom\\", \\"tradition\\". The Muslim use of this term refers to the sayings and living habits of the prophet Muhammad. Its adherents are referred to in Arabic as ahl as-sunnah wa l-jamƒÅ ªah (\\"the people of the sunnah and the community\\") or ahl as-sunnah for short. In English, its adherents are known as Sunni Muslims, Sunnis, Sunnites and Ahlus Sunnah. Sunni Islam is sometimes referred to as \\"orthodox Islam\\". The Quran, together with hadith (especially those collected in Kutub al- Sittah) and binding juristic consensus form the basis of all traditional jurisprudence within Sunni Islam. Sharia rulings are derived from these basic sources, in conjunction with analogical reasoning, consideration of public welfare and juristic discretion, using the principles of jurisprudence developed by the traditional legal schools. Although many African Americans' ancestors were Muslims prior to being kidnapped to America, the period of brutal enslavement had done much to rob the cultural and religious identity of many. The story of Abdulrahman Ibrahim Ibn Sori, a Muslim prince from West Africa who was made a slave in the United States and freed 40 years later, is a testament to the survival of Muslim belief and practice among enslaved Africans in America. The conversion of Malik el-Shabazz (better known as Malcolm X) in 1964 is widely regarded as the turning point for the spread of orthodox Sunni Islam among Black American Muslims. Encouraged to learn about Sunni Islam after his departure from the Nation of Islam, he converted; others from the Nation of Islam soon followed. Warith Deen Mohammed rose to leadership of the Nation of Islam in 1975 following the death of his father Elijah Muhammad and began the groundbreaking, though sometimes controversial, process of leading Black Muslims out of the NOI and into Sunni Islam. As a result of his personal thinking and studies of the Quran, he became part of Ahlus Sunnah during a term in federal prison from 1961-1963 for refusing induction into the United States military. Mohammed introduced many reforms and began an information campaign about Sunni Islam much as el-Shabazz had years earlier. He stated that Fard was not divine and that his father was not a prophet. All of the over 400 temples were converted into traditional Islamic mosques, and he introduced the Five Pillars of Islam to his followers. He rejected literal interpretations of his father's theology and Black-separatist views and on the basis of his intensive independent study of Islamic law, history, and theology, he accepted whites as fellow worshipers. However, he also encouraged African Americans to separate themselves from their pasts, in 1976 calling upon them to change their surnames which were often given to their ancestors by slave masters. He forged closer ties with mainstream Muslim communities, including Hispanic and Latino American Muslims. By 1978 he had succeeded in leading the majority of the original NOI to Sunni Islam which still stands as the largest mass conversion to Islam in the United States. In many urban areas of the United States today many Black Muslims in the Sunni tradition are known and recognized by the hijabs on women and kufi caps and long beards for men. These beards are grown as an adherence to the Sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad for men to let their beards grow. Commonly called Sunnah beards, and Sunni Beards, among Muslims and more recently known as Philly beards have also gained popularity among non Muslim men emulating Muslim style. =Moorish Science Temple of America= The Moorish Science Temple is an American organization founded in 1913 by Prophet Noble Drew Ali, whose name at birth was Timothy Drew. He claimed it was a sect of Islam but he also drew inspiration from Buddhism, Christianity, Gnosticism, and Taoism. Its significant divergences from mainstream Islam and strong African-American ethnic character make its classification as an Islamic denomination a matter of debate among Muslims and scholars of religion. Its primary tenet was the belief that they are the ancient Moabites who inhabited the Northwestern and Southwestern shores of Africa. The organization also believes that their descendants after being conquered in Spain are slaves who were captured and held in slavery from 1779‚Äì1865 by their slaveholders. Although often criticized as lacking scientific merit, adherents of the Moorish Science Temple of America believe that the Negroid Asiatic was the first human inhabitant of the Western Hemisphere. In their religious texts adherents refer to themselves as \\"Asiatics\\",The Holy Koran of the Moorish Science Temple of America Chapter XXV - \\"A Holy Covenant of the Asiatic Nation\\" presumably referring to the non-Mongoloid Paleoamericans (see Luzia Woman). These adherents also call themselves \\"indigenous Moors\\", \\"American Moors\\" or \\"Moorish Americans\\" in contradistinction to \\"African Moors\\" or \\"African Americans\\". =Nation of Islam= Louis Farrakhan, the leader of the Nation of Islam since 1981. The Nation of Islam (NOI) was created in 1930 by Wallace Fard Muhammad. Fard drew inspiration for NOI doctrines from those of Timothy Drew's Moorish Science Temple of America. He provided three main principles which serve as the foundation of the NOI: \\"Allah is God, the white man is the devil and the so-called Negroes are the Asiatic Black People, the cream of the planet earth\\". In 1934 Elijah Muhammad became the leader of the NOI. He deified Fard, saying that he was an incarnation of God, and taught that he was a prophet who had been taught directly by God in the form of Fard. Two of the most famous people to join the NOI were Malcolm X, who became the face of the NOI in the media, and Muhammad Ali, who, while initially rejected, was accepted into the group shortly after his first world heavyweight championship victory.Jacob Neusner (2003). pp.180-181. . Both Malcolm X and Ali later became Sunni Muslims. Malcolm X was one of the most influential leaders of the NOI and, in accordance with NOI doctrine, advocated the complete separation of blacks from whites. He left the NOI after being silenced for 90 days (due to a controversial comment on the John F. Kennedy assassination), and proceeded to form Muslim Mosque, Inc. and the Organization of Afro-American Unity before his pilgrimage to Mecca and conversion to Sunni Islam. He is viewed as the first person to start the movement among African Americans towards Sunni Islam. Muhammad died in 1975 and his son, Warith Deen Mohammed, became the leader of the Nation of Islam. He led the organization toward Sunni Islam and renamed it the World Community of Islam in the West the following year. Louis Farrakhan, who quit Warith Deen Mohammed's group, started an organization along the lines of Elijah Muhammad's teachings. Farrakhan renamed his organization the Nation of Islam in 1981, and has regained many properties associated with Elijah Muhammad, such as Mosque Maryam, its Chicago headquarters. It was estimated that the Nation of Islam had at least 20,000 members in 2006.Omar Sacirbey (May 16, 2006) Muslims Look to Blacks for Civil Rights Guidance Pew Forum. Retrieved July 29, 2009. However, today the group has a wide influence in the African American community. The first Million Man March took place in Washington, D.C. in 1995 and was followed later by another one in 2000 which was smaller in size but more inclusive, welcoming individuals other than just African American men.Farrakhan backs racial harmony BBC News (BBC). October 16, 2000. Retrieved September 8, 2009. The group sponsors cultural and academic education, economic independence, and personal and social responsibility. The Nation of Islam has received a great deal of criticism for its anti-white, anti-Christian, and anti-semitic teachings, and is listed as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. =Five-Percent Nation= The Five-Percent Nation, sometimes referred to the \\"Nation of Gods and Earths\\" (NGE/NOGE) or the \\"Five Percenters\\", is an American organization founded in 1964 in the Harlem section of the borough of Manhattan, New York City, by a former member of the Nation of Islam named Clarence 13X (born Clarence Edward Smith and later known as \\"Allah the Father\\"). Clarence 13X, a former student of Malcolm X, left the Nation of Islam after a theological dispute with the Nation's leaders over the nature and identity of God. Specifically, Clarence 13X denied that the Nation's biracial founder Wallace Fard Muhammad was Allah and instead taught that the black man was himself God personified. Members of the group call themselves Allah's Five Percenters, which reflects the concept that ten percent of the people in the world know the truth of existence, and those elites and agents opt to keep eighty-five percent of the world in ignorance and under their controlling thumb; the remaining five percent are those who know the truth and are determined to enlighten the rest. =United Nation of Islam= The United Nation of Islam (UNOI) is a group based in Kansas City, Kansas. It was founded in 1978 by Royall Jenkins, who continues to be the leader of the group and styles himself \\"Royall, Allah in Person\\". =Conversion to orthodox Sunni Islam= After the death of Elijah Muhammad, he was succeeded by his son, Warith Deen Mohammed. Mohammed rejected many teachings of his father, such as the divinity of Fard Muhammad, and saw a white person as also a worshiper. As he took control of the organization, he quickly brought in new reforms.John Esposito (September 10, 2008) W. D. Mohammed: A Witness for True Islam The Washington Post. Retrieved June 21, 2009. He renamed it the World Community of al-Islam in the West; later it became the American Society of Muslims. It was estimated that there were 200,000 followers of W. D. Mohammed at the time. W. D. Mohammed introduced teachings which were based on orthodox Sunni Islam.Richard Brent Turner (2003). Islam in the African-American experience. pp. 225-227. . He removed the chairs in the organization's temples, and replaced the entire \\"temple\\" concept with the traditional Muslim house of worship, the mosque, also teaching how to pray the salat, to observe the fasting of Ramadan, and to attend the pilgrimage to Mecca.Nation of Islam leader dies at 74 NBC News.

Retrieved April 22, 2009. =Ahmadiyya= Although at first the India-originated Ahmadiyya Community '{not following Islam}'s efforts were broadly spread out over a large number of racial and ethnic groups, subsequent realization of the deep-seated racial tensions and discrimination in the US made Ahmadi missionaries focus their attention on mainly African Americans and the Muslim immigrant community. Ahmadis often became vocal proponents of the Civil Rights Movement. In recent times, many any Ahmadi Muslims fled countries like Pakistan as refugees due to persecution; this has brought a small second wave of Ahmadis to the United States.Islam in the African-American Experience - Page 262, Richard Brent Turner - 2003 Prison conversions to Islam Conversion to Islam is a practice which is common to African-Americans in prison.

It is designed to be a low-cost launch vehicle. History SpaceDev, the world's first commercial space exploration company, was founded in 1997 by Jim Benson, as a result of a merger between Integrated Space Systems of Southern California and a defunct publicly traded corporate shell. In August 1998 SpaceDev acquired all patents, intellectual property, test results, and documents that had been produced by the bankrupt American Rocket Company (AMROC). Some of these documents would later be used to create the SpaceDev Streaker. In April 2003, SpaceDev announced the creation of the Streaker as part of a propulsion program based on the hybrid motor of the SpaceShipOne, a vehicle created by Scaled Composites. SpaceDev also received an Air Force Research Laboratory contract to develop the SpaceDev Streaker Hybrid Upper Stage rocket, one of two used in the vehicle. The Streaker was expected to undergo first launch in 2007-08. Propulsion method The Streaker is propelled using High Performance Mass Fraction hybrid common core boosters, which will use HTPB and nitrous oxide as fuel. The two motors involved in this system are the Hybrid Upper Stage motor and the SpaceDev Streaker Small Common Booster motor, which will produce 20,000 and 120,000 pounds of thrust respectively. Both motors are used in the SpaceDev Dream Chaser. Other important components include a Common Core Booster and a hybrid transfer stage. Design and testing The Streaker is designed to offer quick response launches of payloads in the 1,102-pound class to low Earth orbit but can support loads of up to 2,204 pounds.

He was born at Uppingham, Rutland and died in the RAF hospital at RAF Halton, Buckinghamshire. Sporting career Beisiegel was educated at Uppingham School, where his batting at cricket won praise from Harry Altham in the annual review of schools cricket in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack in 1926. Altham wrote that Beisiegel \\"stood head and shoulders over his colleagues\\" and his innings of 126 not out for Uppingham against Rugby School \\"was a fine wind-up to his school career\\". For a period of five years between 1927 and 1932, inter-services cricket matches between the different branches of the UK armed forces ‚Äì the Army, the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force ‚Äì were rated as first-class. Beisiegel played in five of these matches for the RAF team between 1928 and 1931 as a middle-order batsman. In his first match, against The Army cricket team in 1928, he scored 54 in his only innings of the match, and this was to be the highest score of his first-class career. A year later, in the same fixture, he top-scored for the RAF with 53. Though Beisiegel continued to play in these inter-services matches through to 1938, none of his games were first-class after 1931, and these were the only first-class scores he made of more than 50. Three years after his last first-class game for the Royal Air Force team, Beisiegel played 10 matches for Leicestershire in the 1934 season as a middle-order batsman. He was not particularly successful, scoring 185 runs at an average of just 12.33 and with a highest score of only 33. But when the Leicestershire captain Arthur Hazlerigg was injured late in the season, it fell to Beisiegel as an amateur player to take over the captaincy, and in his first game as captain he led the team to its first victory over Yorkshire since 1911. The Times report said that it was \\"the most sensational victory of the season\\": Yorkshire had declared their first innings 102 ahead with only five wickets down but, set 149 to win, were all out for 90. Two weeks later there was a second victory under Beisiegel's leadership against a team considered greatly superior to Leicestershire when Nottinghamshire were beaten by an innings and 106 runs inside two days at Trent Bridge. The end of the season, however, marked the end of Beisiegel's first-class cricket career as he resumed his RAF duties; he was, however, awarded an honorary county cap in recognition of his captaincy successes. Military career From school, Beisiegel went as a cadet to the Royal Air Force College Cranwell, where he graduated as a pilot officer in December 1927. He was promoted from flying officer to flight lieutenant in 1933. This was followed by promotion to squadron leader in 1937. From the outbreak of the Second World War he was, from September 1939 to May 1940, in charge of No. 616 Squadron RAF, a unit that was equipped with the Mark I Spitfire. During his command the squadron was based at RAF Leconfield until deployed south in May 1940. In 1942, he was temporarily promoted from wing commander to group captain under the heading of \\"General Duties\\". He remained in the RAF after the Second World War and was officially to group captain in 1947. In 1950, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the King's Birthday Honours. He retired from the RAF with a promotion to the rank of air commodore in 1956.

AG Weser built her for Norddeutscher Lloyd. She was launched as D/S Werra and completed in 1922. (\\"D/S\\" stands for Dampfschiff in German as \\"SS\\" stands for \\"steamship\\" in English.) In 1935 she was bought by Flotte Riunite Cosulich-Lloyd-Sabaudo Navigazione Generale, who renamed her Calabria. In 1937 she was sold to Lloyd Triestino. In June 1940 the UK seized her and placed in the management of the British-India Steam Navigation Company. In December 1940 she was torpedoed and sunk. When she sank, all of her 360 passengers and crew lost their lives. The Ministry of War Transport (MoWT) was going to rename her Empire Inventor, but she was sunk before this had been done. Building and career The Allied Powers seized numerous NDL ships either during the First World War as prize ships or afterwards for war reparations. In the 1920s NDL replaced them with a new fleet from Bremer Vulkan, AG Vulcan Stettin and AG Weser. The first of the new ships were delivered in 1922; Werra among them. Werra was one of a series of six sister ships that AG Weser built for NDL. Werra and were completed in 1922; , and in 1923 and in 1924. Werra had two three-cylinder triple-expansion steam engines and twin screws. Between them her two engines were rated at 604 NHP. Werra was equipped with wireless direction finding and submarine signalling. In 1935 NDL sold Werra, Coblenz and Saarbr√ºcken to Flotte Riunite Cosulich-Lloyd-Sabaudo which renamed them Calabria, Sicilia and Toscana and registered them in Genoa. In 1937 the three ships were sold to Lloyd Triestino, which registered Calabria in Trieste. On 10 June 1940 Italy declared war on France and the United Kingdom. At the time Calabria was in drydock in Calcutta in British India, so on 11 June the British authorities seized her. She was transferred to the MoWT, which appointed the British-India Steam Navigation Company to manage her. The MoWT planned to rename her Empire Inventor, but this intention was overtaken by events. Sinking In December 1940 Calabria was en route to the UK with a cargo of 4,000 tons of iron, 3,050 tons of tea and 1,870 tons of oilcake. Her Master, David Lonie, commanded 128 officers and crew plus one DEMS gunner. She was also carrying 230 mostly Indian supernumaries who were travelling to crew other ships. Calabrias crew and supernumaries included also four Hong Kong Chinese crewmen and one Danish merchant officer. Calabria left Freetown in Sierra Leone with convoy SLS-56 to the UK but fell behind. On the evening of Sunday 8 December German Type IX submarine , commanded by the U-boat ace Viktor Sch√ºtze, torpedoed her in the Western Approaches about west of Slyne Head in County Galway, Ireland. U-103 hit Calabria with one torpedo at 2058 hrs and a second at 2106 hrs. All 360 hands and passengers were lost: there were no survivors. Calabrias latitude was 52 degrees 26 minutes north, at that time of year the sun would have set just before 1600 hours local time, and the ship would have been blacked out under wartime regulations. However, the moon was waxing gibbous, had risen at 1315 hrs and did not set until 0218 hrs in the small hours of the next morning. If the sky was clear, Sch√ºtze would have been able to target Calabria by moonlight. The oldest man aboard was Calabrias chief cook, Santan Martins, who was 79 years old. Martins may have been the oldest merchant seaman killed at sea in the Second World War. Monuments and relics Those who died in Calabrias sinking are commemorated in the Second World War section of the Merchant Navy War Memorial at Tower Hill in London. Her Indian seamen and supernumaries are commemorated in the Commonwealth War Graves Commission monuments at Chittagong and Mumbai. In 1940 after the British seized Calabria a small bronze ship's bell was removed from her. It was offered at auction in September 2012 and again in April 2013.

He was the leader of the successful American Mount Everest Expedition of 1963, which placed six climbers on the summit. Family and early years Norman Dyhrenfurth was born in Germany, the son of Himalayan explorers G√ºnter Oskar Dyhrenfurth and Hettie Dyhrenfurth. His mother was of half Jewish ancestry. After the Nazis came to power, they emigrated, first to Austria in 1933, then two years later to Switzerland, where they became citizens. In 1936, Dyhrenfurth's parents were awarded a gold medal for alpinism at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. He emigrated to the United States in 1937. His service in the United States Army enabled him to gain joint U.S.-Swiss citizenship. He was the founder of the Motion Picture Division of the Department of Theater Arts at UCLA, but resigned that position in 1952. In 1954, he was a Fulbright scholar in Italy. Climbing Dyhrenfurth first came to the attention of the mountaineering community in the United States in 1939, when he completed some challenging climbs in the Grand Tetons. He was a participant in the 1952 Swiss Mount Everest Expedition. In 1960, he was cameraman for the Swiss expedition to Dhaulagiri, and after that climb, approached the government of Nepal about obtaining a permit for an American expedition to climb Mount Everest. He learned that a permit had already been granted to another American climber, William Hackett. Although Dyhrenfurth tried to combine his efforts with Hackett's, that expedition failed to gain funding and never took place. Another application resulted in India being selected for an attempt to climb Everest, but Dyhrenfurth persevered and tried again. 1963 Everest expedition Dyhrenfurth received a permit from the Nepalese authorities on May 10, 1961, for an American expedition to climb Mount Everest in the spring of 1963. He recruited a team of climbers that included Jake Breitenbach, Jim Whittaker, Willi Unsoeld, Lute Jerstad, Tom Hornbein, Dave Dingman and Barry Bishop. William Siri was the deputy team leader. Al Auten was the radio operator, and Gil Roberts was the team doctor. Sherpa Nawang Gombu was also part of the team. On March 23, 1963, Breitenbach was killed in the collapse of a serac in the Khumbu Icefall just above Everest Base Camp. The members of the expedition decided to proceed. Dyhrenfurth's style of leadership being democratic and team-oriented, he called a meeting, discussed the tragedy, let everyone speak, and when the decision was made to continue, the team remained intact. Dyhrenfurth's leadership style included a \\"commitment to consensus\\", and he was considered by those who have studied the expedition a \\"huge asset to the team\\". On May 1, Whittaker and Gombu reached the summit of Mount Everest by the South Col route used by the successful British expedition of 1953. On May 22, Unsoeld and Hornbein completed the first ascent of the West Ridge, descending by the South Col, thus completing the first traverse of Everest. That same day, Bishop and Jerstad reached the summit by the South Col route. The two pairs of climbers met up high on the mountain, and made their descent in the gathering darkness. From midnight until 4:00 am, they bivouacked high on the mountain, without sleeping bags, tents or bottled oxygen. All survived, though Unsoeld and Bishop suffered from frostbite, resulting in the amputation of toes. On July 8, 1963, President John F. Kennedy presented the National Geographic Society's Hubbard Medal to Dyhrenfurth at a ceremony in the flower garden of the White House. The surviving members of the expedition were also present. Kennedy told Dyhrenfurth that \\"we followed your actions with the greatest pride.\\" 1971 International Expedition Along with J. O. M. Roberts of the United Kingdom, Dyhrenfurth co-led the unsuccessful 1971 International Expedition, which attempted to climb Mount Everest by two routes. The climbers included Dougal Haston and Don Whillans of the United Kingdom, Wolfgang Axt of Austria, Odd Eliassen of Norway, David Isles of the United States, Michel Vaucher of Switzerland, Carlo Mauri of Italy, Harsh Vardhan Bahuguna of India and Australian journalist Murray Sayle. The expedition ended in disarray after Bahuguna was killed high on the mountain. The Eiger Sanction Dyhrenfurth was the chief technical advisor for the 1975 Clint Eastwood movie The Eiger Sanction. Experienced mountaineers including Mike Hoover, Dougal Haston and Hamish MacInnes were also part of the team. Five Days One Summer Dyhrenfurth was second unit director and technical advisor for the 1982 film Five Days One Summer, starring Sean Connery. Legacy In 1988, Dyhrenfurth was awarded the Tenzing Norgay Award, given by The Explorers Club.

When Choudhury was young he set up and run a tuck shop at school that rivalled the school canteen. He built it up and then got told off for being too good at it, since it was taking business away from the school canteen. Career In 1980s, three chefs walked out of Choudhury's parents' south Indian vegetarian restaurant in north east London as they were offered ludicrous money in the short term to build up the competitor's business. Choudhury then ran the kitchen and the business was gradually built back up. In 1984, Choudhury came to Stoke Newington. After he ran his own Indian restaurant. In 1990, Choudhury and his wife opened a Thai restaurant together called Yum Yum in Stoke Newington. In 1992, because of its popularity he had converted his existing south Indian vegetarian restaurant, Spices, into another Thai restaurant. In 1995, he opened Yum Yum in Loughborough. Choudhury has also established a Thai internet caf√©. He created the Asian Oriental School of Catering, which specialised in training and finding employment for young people and providing a high level quality chefs throughout London and the UK.

A son of Barbizon and a grandson to Polynesian, he was out of a Bold Ruler mare named Bold Majesty. Neapolitan Way is best remembered for placing second in the second jewel of the American Triple Crown, the $250,000 grade 1 Preakness Stakes, to Little Current.Neapolitan Way's pedigree and partial racing stats  Racing career  Neapolitan Way's race history is very sketchy and vague, but he won 14 races during his career. It is also known that he placed in the top three finishers in 43% of his starts, a total of 36 out 84 in-the-money races. At age two, he finished third in the Miami Beach Handicap at Calder Race Course. At age three, he won the grade three Woodlawn Stakes (now renamed the James W. Murphy Stakes) at a mile on the turf at Pimlico Race Course and placed third in the Japan Racing Association Stakes at Laurel Park Racecourse. At age four, he placed third in the grade two Dixie Stakes at Pimlico. Preakness Stakes In mid May 1971, Neapolitan Way's trainer Lawrence W. Jennings decided to take a step up in class and run him in the second jewel of the Triple Crown. The Preakness Stakes is run at a mile and three sixteenths on dirt at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland. Neapolitan Way was listed as one of the longest shots on the board at 24-1 on the morning line in a field of thirteen colts. The prohibitive favorite was the Kentucky Derby winner, Cannonade, at 2-1. Neapolitan Way broke slowly in tenth place out of thirteen and was outrun early under jockey Herb Hinojosa. Going into Pimlico's famous \\"Clubhouse Turn,\\" he fell further back into dead last. The fractions were moderate on the front end, with the first quarter in :231/5 and the half in :47 seconds. Going into the final turn, Neapolitan Way lugged in and collided with Hudson County, causing a severe cut high on his left rear leg. After the move inward, Hinojosa applied steady left handed whipping, straightening Neapolitan Way out at the top of the stretch. In the lane, he moved up quickly from 13th to 11th to 7th and then hit another gear. He started picking off horses, including Cannonade. In deep stretch, he moved into second place but was no threat to the winner, Little Current, who finished between seven and 21 lengths in front of the rest of the field. Cannonade finished one length behind Neapolitan Way in third with Jolly Johu three quarters of a length back in fourth. Neapolitan Way took home the 20% runner-up's share of the purse, equalling $30,000.

When the mount is included in the lower part of the shield, it may be considered an ordinary rather than a charge. A trimount, also described as a mount mounted, or shapournet shapourned, is a representation of a mount with three tops.\\"Mount\\" in: William Berry, Encyclopaedia Heraldica, Or Complete Dictionary of Heraldry (1828). For mounts with more than three tops, the number of tops is blazoned as coupeaux (e.g. a mount with six coupeaux). The trimount (in German, Dreiberg) can be found in all heraldic traditions (Gallo-British, German-Nordic and Latin), but it is especially common in Switzerland. A design of six hills (Sechsberg) can also be found in Swiss and Italian heraldry. In medieval German heraldry, mounts could have ten or more tops.Seals of the Salenstein coat of arms show a mount of twelve tops in 1264, and even one with twenty-eight in 1297. Ernst Herdi: Die Schenken und die Dienstmannen von Salenstein In: Thurgauische Beitr√§ge zur vaterl√§ndischen Geschichte. Vol. 79. Year: 1943. pp 47 ff.

A mount with more than six tops can also be blazoned as Schroffen in German heraldry. Terrace in base curved A terrace in base curved is blazoned mount, hill or hillock when represented in vert; sometimes as a mount vert for clarity. Sometines, a terrace in base curved may be blazoned as mount even when not tinctured vert. This is mostly found in cases where the base represents a hill for one or several of the charges in the coat of arms. Classification either as an ordinary or, in many cases, as a charge, is a matter of interpretation.

The church forms part of the chaplaincy of St Mark's Florence with St Peter's Siena, which also includes a congregation in Bologna, in the Diocese in Europe of the Church of England. The chaplain is Father William Lister. The average congregation is about 150. The church ministers to the homeless in Florence. It is also used for classical music concerts and opera, with a resident opera company.  History  St Mark's was founded by the Reverend Charles Tooth as a centre of worship for Anglo- Catholic members of the Anglican Church in Florence. He started a house church at 1 Via dei Serragli in 1877 to teach Anglo-Catholic principles and celebrate the Holy Eucharist daily during the week. In 1880, Tooth purchased a 15th- century palazzo to meet the new congregation's needs. John Roddam Spencer Stanhope designed and created the wall and ceiling decorations at his own expense. The first Holy Eucharist was celebrated there on 1 May 1881, although chaplain and church were not licensed for service by the bishop until 1884. The premises were extended by the purchase of 16 Via Maggio in 1906. The church was damaged by the 1966 Flood of the Arno River, resulting in the loss of George Frederick Bodley's 19th-century stencil work on the lower walls, although some survived behind a display cabinet. St. Mark's was the second Anglican church to be built in Florence. The British community in Florence has a long history and the chaplaincy began in the late 1820s. The first church, Holy Trinity, opened in the 1840s. Rebuilt in the 1890s, Trinity Church on the Via Lamarmara, is today a Waldensian Church.  Architecture  Interior: nave and altar = Exterior = The white marble statue in the niche over the main door is Apotheosis of Saint Mark (2007‚Äì8) by Jason Arkles. This is the first work by an American sculptor to have a permanent public location in Florence. = Interior = The building was altered by Tooth, who turned the ground floor into a church with nave, aisles, transept and chancel, about long and seating 400. The interior is decorated in the Pre-Raphaelite style and the upper reaches of the church have floral motifs with, as described by art historian Berenice Schreiner, \\"a wonderful sense of naturalism\\".

The plans, exhibited at the Royal Academy in March 1904, included a tower that would have dominated the Clock Tower and Victoria Tower of the nearby Houses of Parliament. It was never built. The design by John Pollard Seddon ‚Äì then diocesan architect for London ‚Äì and Edward Beckitt Lamb (son of Edward Buckton Lamb) was based on earlier schemes that each had proposed separately, and was one of many extensions proposed for Westminster Abbey in the late 19th and early 20th centuries by architects such as George Gilbert Scott, George John Shaw Lefevre, James Fergusson, and Henry Travis. In particular, the clergy at the abbey were concerned that it was becoming crowded with monuments, and more space was needed. Some of the proposed designs were considered by a Royal Commission in 1891. The issue was given added impetus after the coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra in August 1902, by a desire for Westminster Abbey to become a fitting Imperial monument, to compete with the baroque St Paul's Cathedral where Queen Victoria had commemorated her Diamond Jubilee in 1897. The architects aspired to create a grand and expensive monument to \\"form a worthy centre to the metropolis of the Empire 'upon which the sun never sets'\\" . The complex was planned to be joined to the Great Cloister of Westminster Abbey, leading to a reception hall beneath the tower, with the main body of the building ‚Äì the Great Monumental Hall ‚Äì stretching along Great College Street and incorporating smaller side halls. The halls would have ended with a double transept at the south end, wide and deep. The soaring Memorial Tower included a high-level open ambulatory, surmounted by a corona topped by a lantern with bells. It was intended to hold monuments and imperial trophies in galleries on the lower floors, with archives on the upper floors. It would have been the tallest building in the United Kingdom, significantly higher than the dome of St Paul's Cathedral. The complex would have had a similar floor area to Westminster Abbey, and would have overshadowed the Houses of Parliament close by. The scheme of work would have included the completion of the tower over the crossing at Westminster Abbey. The Builder magazine criticised the scheme as exhibiting a degree of megalomania .

Hovey left $50,000 to support abolitionism and other types of social reform, including \\"women's rights, non-resistance, free trade and temperance.\\"Dudden (2011), p. 23 Hovey appointed a committee of trustees to administer the fund, headed by abolitionist Wendell Phillips. Hovey specified that the funds should be spent at the rate of $8,000 per year to meet immediate needs.Dudden (2011), p. 23 The fund paid Susan B. Anthony's salary ($12 per week) while she coordinated the Women's Loyal National League's massive petition drive asking Congress to approve an amendment that would abolish slavery.Venet (1991), pp. 110-111 With 400,000 signatures, it was the largest petition drive in the nation's history up to that time, gathering signatures from approximately one out every twenty-four adults in the Northern states and significantly contributing to the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.Venet (1991), p. 148 Hovey was one of a group of Boston businessmen who had provided most of the funding for the American Anti-Slavery Society in the years prior to the American Civil War.Abbott (1991) p. 20 During and after the war the Hovey fund helped to sustain the Anti-Slavery Society as fund-raising became more difficult and the cost of publishing abolitionist newspapers increased sharply. After slavery in the U.S. was abolished by the Thirteenth Amendment, the fund's continued support assisted the Anti-Slavery Society's campaign for the political rights of the newly freed slaves, playing a crucial role in the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment and Fifteenth Amendments, which secured citizenship and voting rights for African Americans.Dudden (2011), pp. 52-53, 105DuBois (1978), p. 56 A controversy over the fund developed after the Thirteenth Amendment was ratified. Hovey's will stipulated that if slavery was abolished before the fund's money was exhausted, the remainder was to be channeled to other specified reform movements, including the women's rights movement. Despite the fact that the Thirteenth Amendment abolished slavery in 1865, Phillips declared that slavery would not truly be abolished until African Americans secured the right to vote, and he continued to channel much of the fund's money to that cause.Dudden (2011), p. 68 Leaders of the women's movement were furious at being denied money that rightfully belonged to them, especially when they desperately needed it to finance what they had hoped would be a pivotal campaign in Kansas by the American Equal Rights Association to achieve suffrage for all state citizens regardless of race or sex.Dudden (2011), pp. 105, 108 References * Abbott, Richard.

According to Countries and Their Cultures, there is a \\"very high proportion\\" of Uruguayan women participating in the labor force of the South American country. The Uruguayan legislation maintains that the women of Uruguay have equal rights to power, authority, and privileges\\". In reality, however, women are still not occupying \\"higher economic, professional, political, social, and religious positions\\". In relation to the political arena, UN Women reported that a 2012 study made by the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) ranked Uruguay as being \\"103rd out of 189 countries in terms of representation of women in Parliament\\". Uruguay low ranking is partly due to its low political participation of women: only 16% of members of Parliament are women as of 2014. Notable women One prominent Uruguayan woman is Paulina Luisi. Luisi was a leader of the feminist movement in the country of Uruguay. In 1909, she became the first woman in the country to obtain a medical degree and was highly respected. She represented Uruguay in international women's conferences and traveled throughout Europe. She voiced her opinion on women's rights, and in 1919, Paulina started the force for women's rights in Uruguay. By 1922, the Pan-American Conference of Women named Paulina Luisi an honorary vice president of the meeting and she continued to be an activist until Uruguay gave women the right to vote. Domestic violence Domestic violence is a very serious problem, especially so-called crimes of passion, which continue to be tolerated under Article 36 of the Penal Code (The passion provoked by adultery) ‚Äì Art√≠culo 36. (La pasi√≥n provocada por el adulterio). Since 2013, there have been ongoing political efforts to remove this provision from the Criminal Code. Before 2006, perpetrators of rape could avoid punishment if, after the assault, they married the victim. Uruguay's law against domestic violence is Ley N¬∫ 17.514, enacted in 2002. Abortion The abortion law of Uruguay is very liberal compared to the other Latin American countries. In 2012, Uruguay become the second country in Latin America, after Cuba, to legalize abortion on demand (during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy). Women in politics Unlike most other Latin American countries, women are not very present in politics. Uruguay has one of the lowest percentage of women in politics in Latin America.

Throughout the 1970s, during the presidency of Anwar Sadat, he was part of the anti-Sadat student movement and won in two student union elections. He also participated in the anti-austerity protests of 1977 which resulted in his arrest. He was arrested two more times, during the 1980 parliamentary elections and in 1983 for suspicions of being part of an clandestine Nasserist organization. He was severely tortured during his latter stint in prison. When the Arab Democratic Nasserist Party (ADNP) was legalized in 1992 Iskander joined the party, which was founded by Diaa al-Din Dawoud, but later left the party in 1998 along with other members of the \\"new guard\\" after disagreements with the party's leaders.

He also helped organize protests against the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the ensuing occupation. These protests, together with wide disapproval of Hosni Mubarak's policies in Egypt, eventually culminated with the founding of Kefaya, a grassroots opposition movement.

Dan Aykroyd, Lauren Bacall, Esther Rolle, John Heard, Wilford Brimley, Bradley Whitford, and Jeff Yagher are also in the cast. It is named for the traditional opening of Presidential addresses to the American people. Lemmon's perennial collaborator, Walter Matthau, was slated to costar. Health problems kept him from appearing so Garner was chosen to star opposite Lemmon for their first project together. Plot Republican Senator Russell Kramer of Ohio (Jack Lemmon) wins the Presidential election, narrowly defeating archrival Democratic Governor Matt Douglas of Indiana (James Garner). Four years later, Douglas wins a landslide victory over the now-incumbent Kramer. Another four years later, Kramer's former Vice President, William Haney (Dan Aykroyd), defeats Douglas. Haney's Vice President, Ted Matthews (John Heard), is widely seen as an idiot, and becomes a continuing embarrassment for the administration. A further three years later, Kramer is spending his time writing books and speaking at various inconsequential functions, while Douglas is finishing his own book and going through a divorce. Meanwhile, the Democratic Party learns about \\"Olympia\\", the codename for a series of bribes from defense contractor Charlie Reynolds (James Rebhorn) paid to Haney when he was Vice President. The Democratic National Committee chairman Joe Hollis (Wilford Brimley) asks Douglas to investigate. Hollis offers the support of the Democratic Party for a Presidential run in return for his help. Douglas accepts, hoping to beat Haney and get back into the Oval Office. Meanwhile, Haney and his Chief of Staff Carl Witnaur (Bradley Whitford) plot to frame Kramer for the scandal, despite Haney's private acknowledgment to Witnaur that Kramer had known nothing about it. When rumors begin to suggest that Kramer was involved in Olympia, he begins his own investigation. NSA agent Colonel Paul Tanner (Everett McGill) has Reynolds assassinated when he attempts to tell Douglas the truth about Olympia. Kramer arrives at the scene to find Douglas with Reynolds' body. Before they can flee, Douglas and Kramer are forced to board Marine One by White House officials, claiming to be taking them to Camp David at the request of Haney. During the flight Douglas realizes that they are heading in the wrong direction. Suspicious, they force the pilots to land. They disembark just before the helicopter explodes. Kramer and Douglas are left stranded, with the realization that the explosion was meant to kill them. They decide to go to Kramer's Presidential Library in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio to obtain records the overly-frugal Kramer kept of all meals served during his time in the White House, which will prove Haney was present at a key meeting with Reynolds. During a series of misadventures, they meet a variety of ordinary Americans and see the effects their terms in office have had. After several close encounters with NSA agents, they arrive at the library and discover the evidence has been tampered with to implicate Kramer. A guard gives Kramer a message from Reynolds' secretary stating that Witnaur had recently met with Reynolds. Douglas and Kramer kidnap Witnaur and with Joe Hollis's help, force him to reveal the plot to frame Kramer, though Witnaur claims to have no knowledge of the attempts on their lives, blaming Tanner and Haney. They at first decide to report Witnaur's confession to Kay Griffin (Sela Ward), a Fox News journalist, but Douglas, based upon their adventures, convinces Kramer go to the White House to confront Haney, seeing it as a chance of redemption for their poor choices as Presidents. They manage to sneak into the White House with the help of the White House Executive Chef Rita (Esther Rolle) and make it to the Executive Residence only to discover that Haney is giving a press conference outside. Tanner traps Douglas and Kramer in a guest room but they utilize a secret tunnel to escape while the NSA gives chase. Tanner catches up with them and is about to shoot them when he himself is killed by Secret Service Sniper Lieutenant Ralph Fleming (Jeff Yagher), who has recognized the presidents from a chance encounter at a gay pride parade during their adventure, and disobeys orders to shoot them. Douglas and Kramer interrupt Haney's speech and take him to the Oval Office to talk. There they play Haney a tape of Witnaur's confession, but Haney denies knowledge of Reynolds' murder or the helicopter explosion. Haney agrees to resign and proceeds to give a resignation speech, claiming to have heart problems. Douglas and Kramer muse that the idiotic Matthews will now be elevated from Vice President to President and realize that the only way it could have happened was under these circumstances. The pair confront Matthews who admits that he, not Haney, had engineered the entire plot so that he could become President, knowing Haney would take the fall. Matthews explains that his stupidity was just an act, but Douglas secretly records his confession on tape. Matthews is sent to prison. Nine months later, Douglas and Kramer are running together as independents in the Presidential election, arguing which of them will be the nominee for president. Douglas distracts Kramer by throwing a dollar on the floor, and takes to the podium to announce himself as the Presidential candidate, much to the chagrin of Kramer.

There, the Western Carolina University Marching Band portrays the \\"All Dorothy Marching Band\\" (a fictional group based upon gay icon Judy Garland's character in The Wizard of Oz), at a gay pride parade. In his memoirs, Garner wrote that he enjoyed working with Lemmon but felt the director \\"was a self appointed genius who didn't know his ass from second base and Jack and I both knew it.\\" Reception The film received mixed reviews from critics. It holds a 47% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 60 reviews and with an average rating of 5.3/10 and the critical consensus: \\"It doesn't commit any impeachable offenses, but My Fellow Americans lacks strong regulatory oversight of its toothless political satire and misuse of comedic talent.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times praised the performances of Lemmon and Garner but felt the movie was \\"a series of cheap shots and missed opportunities\\". However, he said that \\"a lot of the cheap shots are funny, and maybe the climate is wrong for sharply barbed political satire. I dunno. This is not a great comedy and will be soon forgotten, but it has nice moments.\\" James Berardinelli of ReelViews also complimented the actors, writing \\"Lemmon and Garner slip comfortably into their roles\\" and saying the movie has \\"some good one-liners\\", but he criticized the \\"failed attempts to inject embarrassingly trite melodrama and recycled action sequences into the story\\" and also felt the political satire was \\"weak and obligatory\\". Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle described My Fellow Americans as a \\"pleasing but mediocre film, with a great cast, a great story and a misguided script.\\" References External links   James Garner Interview on The Charlie Rose Show * James Garner interview at Archive of American Television Category:1990s buddy comedy films Category:1990s comedy road movies Category:1996 films Category:American buddy comedy films Category:American films Category:American political comedy films Category:American comedy road movies Category:Films about elections Category:Films about fictional presidents of the United States Category:Films directed by Peter Segal Category:Films scored by William Ross Category:Films set in the White House Category:Films set in Washington, D.C.

The film is based on the 1991 novel The Firm by author John Grisham. The Firm was one of two films released in 1993 that were adapted from a Grisham novel, the other being The Pelican Brief. Released on June 30, 1993, the film was a major commercial success, grossing $270.2 million against a budget of $42 million, making it the highest grossing film adapted from a Grisham novel and the highest-grossing R-rated film of 1993, and received positive reviews for the performances (particularly from Hunter), although the screenplay received some criticism. Holly Hunter was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance, while Dave Grusin was nominated for Best Original Score.  Plot  Mitch McDeere, about to graduate near the top of his class from Harvard Law School, accepts a generous job offer from Bendini, Lambert & Locke, a boutique firm in Memphis, Tennessee. Mitch and his wife Abby move to Memphis, and he studies to pass the Tennessee bar exam. Senior partner Avery Tolar mentors Mitch and introduces him to the firm's professional culture, which demands strict loyalty, confidentiality, and a willingness to charge exceptional fees. Mitch is seduced by the money and perks ‚Äì including a house, new car, and his student loans paid off ‚Äì but Abby is suspicious of the firm's interference with employees‚Äô families. Mitch passes the bar exam and begins working long hours, straining his marriage. Working closely with Avery, Mitch learns that most of the firm's work involves helping wealthy clients hide money in off- shore shell corporations and other dubious tax-avoidance schemes. During a working trip to the Cayman Islands, Mitch hears a client state that the firm's Chicago clients break people's legs, and finds suspicious documents in a locked closet at Avery's vacation house relating to four of the firm's associates who died under suspicious circumstances. While in the Caymans, Mitch is seduced by a local sex worker. The seduction had been prearranged by the firm's security chief, Bill DeVasher, who uses photos of the tryst to blackmail Mitch into keeping quiet about the firm's activities, threatening to send the photos to Abby. In response, Mitch hires private investigator Eddie Lomax to investigate the associates' death. Lomax is then fatally shot by two hit-men in his office, a murder witnessed by his secretary Tammy. Mitch is approached by FBI agents who reveal that BL&L;'s biggest client is the Morolto crime family of the Chicago Outfit. Most of the firm is complicit in a massive tax fraud and money laundering scheme. The dead associates had learned the truth and were killed on the firm‚Äôs orders, as was Lomax. The FBI warns Mitch that his house, car, and office are probably bugged, and pressures him to provide evidence against the firm and the Moroltos. Mitch agrees to cooperate in return for $1.5 million and the release of his brother Ray, who is serving time in an Arkansas prison. The FBI orders Ray's release, planning to return him to prison once Mitch hands over the incriminating files, and gives him half the money. Mitch confesses his one-night stand in the Caymans to Abby, who prepares to leave him. When a client complains that he was billed for several hours of extra fees, Mitch realizes that mailing clients these padded bills is mail fraud, exposing the firm to RICO charges. He secretly copies the firm's billing records with help from Tammy, but needs files from Avery‚Äôs house in the Caymans. Avery invites Abby to come with him to the Caymans and she declines, but he reveals his work schedule has changed, threatening Mitch's plans. Telling Tammy not to inform Mitch, Abby flies to the Caymans to seduce and drug Avery. The firm's phone tap picks up Abby's warning to Tammy, and DeVasher sends his hitmen to the Caymans. After Abby and Tammy steal, copy, and return the files, a drowsy Avery tells Abby that the firm arranged for Mitch's mistress to seduce him. He warns Abby to leave, and later drowns in the bathtub. Mitch's plans are jeopardized when a prison guard on the Moroltos' payroll alerts DeVasher after Ray is transferred to FBI custody without the usual formalities. Fleeing from DeVasher and his gunmen, Mitch enters a building where DeVasher inadvertently shoots a hitman dead before Mitch blindsides him and beats him to death. Mitch meets with the Moroltos, presenting himself as a loyal attorney looking out for his clients' interests. He claims that his contact with the FBI and his copying of files were an attempt to expose the firm's illegal over-billing, and asks the Moroltos for permission to turn over their billing invoices to help the FBI‚Äôs case against the firm. Revealing that he has made his own copies, he assures them that as long as he is alive, any information he knows about their legal affairs is safe under attorney-client privilege. Guaranteeing Mitch's safety, the Moroltos reluctantly let him give the FBI the evidence it needs to prosecute the firm. Since the Moroltos were not tied to the mail fraud operations and attorney-client privilege does not apply when a lawyer knows about ongoing criminal activity, Mitch is able to continue his legal career, and reconciles with Abby. The FBI is furious that Mitch bailed the Moroltos out, but Mitch reminds them that the evidence he provided falls under RICO's jurisdiction and can all but guarantee every senior member of the firm going to prison for decades. The film ends as the McDeeres return to Boston, driving the same well-used car in which they arrived in Memphis, while Ray, having been given the $750,000 Mitch obtained from the FBI by Tammy, enjoys his new life in the Caymans.  Cast  * Tom Cruise as Mitch McDeere, a promising recent Harvard Law graduate. * Jeanne Tripplehorn as Abigail \\"Abby\\" McDeere, Mitch's wife. * Gene Hackman as Avery Tolar, Mitch's mentor at the Firm. * Holly Hunter as Tamara \\"Tammy\\" Hemphill, Eddie's chain-smoking secretary and lover who aids Mitch in copying and stealing the files in Memphis and the Cayman Islands. * Ed Harris as Agent Wayne Tarrance, the agent in charge of the investigation into the Firm; Mitch's primary contact with the FBI. * Hal Holbrook as Oliver Lambert, senior partner at the Firm. * Jerry Hardin as Royce McKnight, managing partner at the Firm. * David Strathairn as Ray McDeere, Mitch's brother who was in jail for a manslaughter conviction. * Terry Kinney as Lamar Quinn, Mitch's friend who works at the Firm. * Wilford Brimley as Bill DeVasher, officially the head of security at the Firm‚Äîunofficially the Firm's main hitman. * Sullivan Walker as Thomas Abanks, the owner of a scuba diving business. * Gary Busey as Eddie Lomax, a private investigator and former cell- mate of Ray McDeere. * Steven Hill as F.

The film's soundtrack is almost exclusively solo piano by Dave Grusin. Gene Hackman's name did not appear on the film's release poster. Hackman joined the film late, when it was already well into production, because the producers had originally wanted to change the gender of the character and cast Meryl Streep, until author John Grisham objected and Hackman was eventually cast. Tom Cruise's deal with Paramount already stated that only his name could appear above the title. Hackman also wanted his name to appear above the title, but when this was refused he asked for his name to be removed completely from the poster. Hackman's name does appear in the beginning and end credits. This is also the final film for Steven Hill and John Beal.  Differences from the novel  The film accords with the book in most respects, but the ending is significantly different. Mitch does not end up in the Caribbean, as in the book; he and Abby simply get into their car and drive back to Boston. A more fundamental difference from the book is the motives and manner in which Mitch solves his predicament. In the book, Mitch acknowledges to himself that he is breaking the attorney-client privilege by copying information and giving it to the FBI. In most US states this privilege only applies to crimes that have already been committed. The privilege does not apply if a lawyer knows that his client either is committing or will commit a crime. However, Mitch must disclose information about his legitimate clients as well. Accepting that he will likely not be allowed to practice law anywhere again, he swindles $10 million from the Firm, along with receiving $1 million of a promised $2 million from the FBI for his cooperation. After an extended manhunt involving the police, the firm's lawyers, and hired thugs from the Morolto family, Mitch escapes with Abby (and his brother Ray) to the Cayman Islands. Before fleeing, he leaves behind detailed records of the firm's illegal activities, as well as a recorded deposition. Mitch's information gives federal prosecutors enough evidence to indict half of the Firm's active lawyers right away, as well as several retired partners. The documents also provide the FBI with circumstantial evidence of the Firm's involvement in money laundering and tax fraud, and thus probable cause for a search warrant for the firm's building and files. This additional evidence is enough to smash both the firm and the Morolto family with a massive RICO indictment. In the film, apparently in order to preserve the protagonist's personal integrity, Mitch exposes a systematic overbilling scheme by the firm, thus driving a wedge between the Moroltos (who in essence become complicit with Mitch) and their law firm (in the book, overbilling only received a brief mention). He receives a smaller amount of money from the FBI, which he gives to Ray, allowing him to disappear. Rather than capitalizing on his circumstances by stealing money from the Firm, as in the book, the movie's McDeere ends up battered and bruised, but with his integrity and professional ethics intact. Mitch also makes the FBI have to work in order to bring down the firm by having to argue that each instance of excessive billing is a federal offense (by virtue of the excessive bills being sent through the mail). The volume and frequency meet the criteria for RICO, thereby enabling the FBI to effectively put the Firm out of business by seizing its property and equipment and freezing its bank accounts. From here the Moroltos would then need to find another law firm willing to take them on as clients, and if they couldn't, charges for non- lodgment of tax returns could be brought. Since Mitch is exposing only illegal activity, he is able to retain his law license. Instead of a BMW, Mitch gets a Mercedes-Benz for joining the firm. Avery Tolar was originally Avery Tolleson; the latest version of the novel uses the film's surname. Tolar is portrayed as a sort of reluctant villain in the film, while in the novel he has no such moral conflicts. The surname of the second man killed on Grand Cayman is Joe Hodges, instead of Hodge as in the novel. Mitch's confession to Abby about his sexual infidelity was also unique to the film. In the novel, McDeere never tells Abby about his infidelity. In the book, Abby's not knowing about Mitch's infidelity is a major \\"suspense\\" piece. Mitch comes home one evening and finds an envelope addressed to Abby, that has \\"Photos ‚Äì Do Not Bend\\" written on it. The photos were surreptitiously given to DeVasher by Art Germain. Mitch thinks it is the pictures he was shown of his infidelity overseas. Abby is in the bedroom when he sees the open package. He enters the bedroom and learns that Abby opened the package, but it was empty. Mitch realizes DeVasher is toying with him, and this incident in the book causes Mitch to cooperate with the FBI. In the film, Mitch's confession prompts Abby to seriously consider leaving him, but she ultimately helps him bring down the firm. Also, in the book, Eddie's old secretary, Tammy, seduces and drugs Avery. In the movie, however, it is Abby who seduces Avery. This also changes the character development because in the movie Abby is portrayed as risking herself for Mitch. In the book, Abby is simply an accomplice to Tammy. In the novel, a dirty FBI agent betrays McDeere to let the firm know about the deal. In the movie, a prison guard alerts the firm to Ray McDeere's release, alerting them that Mitch McDeere cut a deal with the FBI.  Release  The film was released while Grisham was at the height of his popularity. That week, Grisham and Michael Crichton evenly divided the top six paperback spots on The New York Times Best Seller list. It opened on June 30, 1993 in 2,393 theatres, and landed at #1 at the box office, grossing $25.4 million over the 4th of July weekend. It remained in the #1 spot at the box office for 3 weeks. After 12 weeks in theatres, the film was a huge success, making over $158 million domestically and $111 million internationally ($270 million worldwide). Additionally, it was the largest grossing R-rated movie of 1993 and of any film based on a Grisham novel.The Firm at Box Office Mojo = Awards = The film earned two Academy Award nominations including Best Supporting Actress for Holly Hunter (losing to Anna Paquin for The Piano, though she did win an Oscar at that year's ceremony for Best Actress in the same film as Paquin) and Best Original Score for Dave Grusin (losing to John Williams for Schindler's List).  Reception  Critical reaction to The Firm has been mostly positive, with the film earning a 75% rating at Rotten Tomatoes based on 55 reviews. The site's consensus states: \\"The Firm is a big studio thriller that amusingly tears apart the last of 1980s boardroom culture and the false securities it represented.\\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B+\\" on an A+ to F scale. Roger Ebert gave The Firm three stars out of four, remarking: \\"The movie is virtually an anthology of good small character performances. [...] The large gallery of characters makes The Firm into a convincing canvas [... but] with a screenplay that developed the story more clearly, this might have been a superior movie, instead of just a good one with some fine performances.\\"The Firm review by Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun- Times, June 30, 1993 The film earned some negative reviews as well, notably from James Berardinelli, who said that \\"[v]ery little of what made the written version so enjoyable has been successfully translated to the screen, and what we're left with instead is an overly-long [and] pedantic thriller.\\"The Firm review by James Berardinelli, ReelViews.net, 1993 Grisham enjoyed the film, remarking: \\"I thought [Tom Cruise] did a good job. He played the innocent young associate very well.\\"\\"Grisham v.

It was written and directed by Richard Dutcher, who also plays in the main role of Sheriff Wes Clayton. It was financed by private investors. Because of the in-movie descriptions of geography and population, it depicts a fictional Utah town of Brigham City rather than the actual town of Brigham City. It was filmed in Mapleton, Utah. Plot Wes Clayton (Richard Dutcher) is the town sheriff of the small, idyllic town of Brigham City, Utah. Clayton is a devout Latter-Day Saint who is one of seventeen bishops in the town. In Clayton's entire career, there have never been any serious or heinous crimes reported in Brigham City, and generally remains optimistic about the town's friendly nature. His only staff are the witty Peg, his receptionist, Stu (Wilford Brimley), the elderly former sheriff of Brigham City, and Terry, a young and idealistic deputy. While driving with Terry one day, they stumble upon the body of a young women who has been beaten to death in an isolated shack off the road. Since Wes has no experience in murder investigations and because he wants to keep the murder's influence out of his town, he calls in the FBI from their closest office in Salt Lake City, Utah. Among the two agents sent is Meredith, who confides to Clayton that the killer is likely someone within Brigham City, a claim Clayton doesn't believe. The subsequent investigation turns up little evidence, mostly due to Clayton's lack of resources, but tries to keep up with it as best he can. During the night after a local parade and festival, the body of a local beauty pageant queen is found under a gazebo, raped and strangled. Shocked, Clayton decides to deputize Stu and expands his search to within Brigham City, starting with some migrant workers working for Ralph, a local contractor for Brigham City. Clayton and his team organize an effort to gather fingerprints to test against those found at the crime scenes, using beer bottles collected from a local bar. After collecting all of the bottles, Clayton leaves the team to their respective duties. While on his way back, Stu visits a convenience store and stumbles upon an apparent robbery, finding the store's clerk, a local girl named Jamie, tied up. Before he can act, Stu is shot to death by the killer, who takes Jamie with him. Clayton visits the scene and, at his wits end, decides that the killer is indeed someone within Brigham City and not an outsider. At the police station, Peg confides to Meredith that Clayton is dedicated to the job because he was involved in a fatal car accident that killed his wife and son, and put him into a coma for several days. Knowing what people can lose, Peg declares, keeps Clayton at work. The following morning, Clayton organizes most male church members and orders them to inquire at every house and search the property for Jamie. This causes a rift within the community, especially when one house, the home to a photographer and his mother, is particularly against them searching. Forcing himself in, Clayton discovers the man's collection of pornography, but finds nothing relating him to Jamie or the murders. Later that night and disheartened at his actions, Clayton returns to the bottles gathered from the bar and resumes collecting the fingerprints off them. Among the containers tested is a thermos brought by Peg's boyfriend, but they turn up nothing. Clayton later visits Terry's house and talks to him about the fingerprinting efforts. Clayton reveals that he tested Terry's fingerprints from the office and connects him to a criminal who was incarcerated for rape in Arizona several years ago. Clayton deduces that after \\"Terry\\" was released, he assumed the identity of a returned missionary who died in a drowning accident, and moved to Brigham City under this new persona. \\"Terry\\" admits his guilt and is revealed to be involved with multiple disappearances of other young women around the area, as well as the murders. \\"Terry\\" admits Jamie is dead, and put her body, along with the others who haven't been found, in a secluded area within a nearby forest. Preparing to arrest \\"Terry\\", Clayton is forced to kill him in front of \\"Terry's\\" wife when \\"Terry\\" draws a gun on Clayton, with his wife hysterically telling Clayton to leave. With the investigation finally over, Clayton is emotionally drained, and during Sunday's church service, refuses to partake of the sacrament, feeling he does not deserve it. Everyone else sees this and also refuse to take the sacrament, showing that Clayton is not at fault for his actions. Clayton begins to cry at this sight and finally takes the sacrament as everyone else follows with him. Reception The film has a 71% \\"Fresh\\" rating from critics on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 24 reviews. Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 62 out of 100, based on 8 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\".

In 1879, John Stuart and his son Robert joined with George Douglas to form Imperial Mill and set up their operation in Chicago, Illinois. In 1881, Henry Crowell bought the Quaker Mill Company,Quaker.co.in Quaker Oats History and the following year he launched a national advertising campaign for Quaker Oats, introducing a cereal box that made it possible to buy in quantities other than bulk. He also bought the bankrupt Quaker Oat Mill Company in Ravenna, and held the key positions of general manager, president and chairman of the company from 1888 until late 1943, becoming known as the cereal tycoon. He donated more than 70% of his wealth to the Crowell Trust. In 1888, the American Cereal Company was formed by the merger of seven major oat millers. Ferdinand Schumacher became President, Henry Crowell, General Manager and John Stuart the Secretary Treasurer. In 1889, the American Cereal Company introduced the half ounce trial size and, as a promotion, they distributed one to every home in Portland, Oregon via boys on bicycles. Later, this promotion was extended to other cities. A second promotion involved placing dinner plates within the then-regular (not round) boxes of oats. =Quaker Oats Company= In 1901, the Quaker Oats Company was founded in New Jersey with headquarters in Chicago, by the merger of four oat mills: the Quaker Mill Company in Ravenna, Ohio, which held the trademark on the Quaker name; the cereal mill in Cedar Rapids, Iowa owned by John Stuart, his son Robert Stuart, and their partner George Douglas; the German Mills American Oatmeal Company in Akron, Ohio, owned by Schumacher; The Rob Lewis & Co. American Oats and Barley Oatmeal Corporation. Formally known as \\"Good For Breakfast\\" instant oatmeal mix. In the same year, the whole merged company was acquired by Henry Parsons Crowell, who also bought the bankrupt Quaker Oat Mill Company, also in Ravenna. Crowell held the positions of general manager, president and chairman of the company until late 1943. He became known as the cereal tycoon. He donated more than 70% of his wealth to the Crowell Trust.Generous Giving: Store Quaker Oatmeal -Our History In 1908, Quaker Oats introduced the first in a series of cookie recipes on the box. In 1911, Quaker Oats purchased the Great Western Cereal Company. The iconic cylindrical package made its first appearance in 1915. Later that year, Quaker offered the first cereal box premium to buyers. By sending in one dollar and the cut out picture of the \\"Quaker Man\\" customers received a double boiler for the cooking of oatmeal. In the 1920s, Quaker introduced \\"Quaker Quick Oats\\" an early convenience food and also offered a crystal radio kit using the cylindrical package.Quaker Oats Radio Receiving Set, (radiomuseum.org) In the 1930s, Quaker was one of the many companies using the Dionne Quintuplets for promotional purposes. Quaker Oats in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, was photographed during the 1930s by Theodor Horydczak, who documented the building, operations, and factory workers at the plant. The company's contribution to the U.S. war effort During World War II, the company, through its subsidiary the Q. O. Ordnance Company, operated the Cornhusker Ordnance Plant, which manufactured millions of pieces of various artillery munitions (41 warehouses and 219 magazines of total 280,800 ft¬≤ were built).The Social and Economic Impact of World War II Munitions Manufacture on Grand Island, Nebraska, Nebraskahistory.org, 2014. In 1946, artist Jim Nash was commissioned to produce a head portrait of the Quaker Man, which became the basis for Haddon Sundblom's famous version of 1957. In 1972, John Mills designed the current logo. From 1946‚Äì1953, researchers from Quaker Oats, MIT and Harvard University carried out experiments at the Walter E. Fernald State School to determine how the minerals from cereals were metabolized. Parents of mentally challenged children were asked for permission to let their children be members of a Science Club and participate in research. Being a member of the Science Club gave the children special privileges. The parents were told that the children would be fed with a diet high in nutrients. However, they were not told (and the consent form contained no information indicating) that the food their children were fed contained radioactive calcium and iron. The information obtained from the experiments was to be used as part of an advertising campaign. The company was later sued because of the experiments. The lawsuit was settled on 31 December 1997. In 1968, a plant was built in Danville, Illinois, which now makes Aunt Jemima pancake mixes, Oat Squares, Life Cereals Quaker Oh's, Bumpers, Quisp, King Vitamin Natural Granola Cereals, and Chewy granola bars, as well as Puffed Rice for use as an ingredient for other products in other plants. In 1969, Quaker acquired Fisher-Price, a toy company. In the 1970s, the company financed the making of the film Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory, in return obtaining a license to use a number of the product names mentioned in the movie for candy bars. In 1991, Quaker Oats spun off its Fisher-Price division. In 1982, Quaker Oats purchased US Games, a company that created games for the Atari 2600. It went out of business after one year. That same year, Quaker Oats acquired Florida- based orange juice plant Ardmore Farms, which it would own until selling it to Country Pure Foods in 1998. In 1983, Quaker bought Stokely-Van Camp, Inc., makers of Van Camp's and Gatorade. Quaker bought Snapple for $1.7 billion in 1994 and sold it to Triarc in 1997 for $300 million. Triarc sold it to Cadbury Schweppes for $1.45 billion in September 2000. It was spun off in May 2008 to its current owners, Dr Pepper Snapple Group. In 1996, Quaker spun off its frozen food business, selling it to Aurora Foods (which was bought by Pinnacle Foods in 2004). In August 2001, PepsiCo acquired Quaker Oats for $14 billion, primarily for its Gatorade brand of soft drink. The merger created the fourth- largest consumer goods company in the world. Though the main prize of PepsiCo was Gatorade non-carbonated sports drink, Quaker's cereal and snack food division complemented the existing Frito-Lay salty-snacks division. Since the late 1980s, actor Wilford Brimley has appeared in television commercials extolling the virtues of oat consumption, typically to a young child, as to introduce the concept of oatmeal consumption as a long tradition. In the 1990s Nickelodeon animated children's show Rugrats, the biggest fear of one of the characters, Chuckie Finster (the \\"scaredy-cat\\" of the bunch), was \\"the man on the oatmeal box\\". In Rugrats in Paris: The Movie, Chuckie overcame this fear when he became \\"Chuckie Chan\\". The song lyrics to his transformation included the line \\"He can stare into the eye/of the oatmeal guy!\\" =Canadian operations= Quaker Oats facility in Peterborough The major Canadian production facility for Quaker Oats is located in Peterborough, Ontario. The factory was first established as the American Cereal Company in 1902 on the shores of the Otonabee River during that city's period of industrialization. At the time, the city was known as \\"The Electric City\\" due to its hydropower resources, attracting many companies to the site to take advantage of this source. The Trent‚ÄìSevern Waterway also promised to provide an alternate shipping route from inland areas around the city, although it appears this was never used in practice. On 11 December 1916, the factory all but completely burned to the ground. When the smoke had settled, 23 people had died and Quaker was left with $2,000,000 in damages. Quaker went on to rebuild the facility, incorporating the few areas of the structure that were not destroyed by fire. When PepsiCo purchased Quaker Oats in 2001, many brands were consolidated from facilities around Canada to the Peterborough location, which assumed the new QTG (Quaker Tropicana Gatorade) moniker. Local production includes Quaker Oatmeal, Quaker Chewy bars, Cap'n Crunch cereal, Aunt Jemima instant pancake mixes and pancake syrups, Quaker Oat Bran and Corn Bran cereals, Gatorade sports drinks and the Propel fitness water sub-brand, Tropicana juices, and various Frito-Lay snack products. Products are easily identified by the manufactured by address on the packaging. The Peterborough facility supplies the majority of Canada and exports limited portions to the United States. The Quaker plant sells cereal production byproducts to companies that use them to create fire logs and pellets. =Land giveaways in cereal boxes= Starting in 1902, the company's oatmeal boxes came with a coupon redeemable for the legal deed to a tiny lot in Milford, Connecticut. The lots, sometimes as small as 10 feet by 10 feet, were carved out of a 15-acre, never-built subdivision called \\"Liberty Park\\". A small number of children (or their parents), often residents living near Milford, redeemed their coupons for the free deeds and started paying the extremely small property taxes on the \\"oatmeal lots\\". The developer of the prospective subdivision hoped the landowners would hire him to build homes on the lots, although several tracts would need to be combined before building could start. The legal deeds created a large amount of paperwork for town tax collectors, who frequently couldn't find the property owners and received almost no tax revenue from them. In the mid-1970s, the town put an end to the oatmeal lots with a \\"general foreclosure\\" condemning nearly all of the property, which is now part of a BiC Corporation plant.Juliano, Frank, \\"Oatmeal lots gave officials indigestion\\", pp 1, A12, 3 October 2010, Connecticut Post In 1955, Quaker Oats again gave away land as part of a promotion, this one tied to the Sergeant Preston of the Yukon television show in the United States. The company offered in its Puffed Wheat and Puffed Rice cereal boxes genuine deeds to land in the Klondike. The Quaker man logo versus Quakers The Quaker Oats standing \\"Quaker Man\\" logo c.1900 The Quaker Oats logo starting in 1877 had a figure of a Quaker man depicted full-length, sometimes holding a scroll with the word \\"Pure\\" written across it, resembling the classic woodcuts of William Penn (founder of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania), the 17th-century philosopher and early Quaker. Quaker Oats advertising dating back to 1909 did, indeed, identify the \\"Quaker man\\" as William Penn, and referred to him as \\"standard bearer of the Quakers and of Quaker Oats.\\" Quaker Oats box, featuring the pre-2012 \\"Quaker Man\\" logo In 1946, graphic designer Jim Nash created a black-and-white head-and-shoulders portrait of the smiling Quaker Man, and Haddon Sundblom's now-familiar color head-and-shoulders portrait (using fellow Coca-Cola artist Harold W. McCauley as the model) debuted in 1957. The monochromatic 1969 Quaker Oats Company logo, modeled after the Sundblom illustration, was created by Saul Bass, a graphic designer known for his motion picture title sequences and corporate logos. In 2012, the company enlisted the firm of Hornall Anderson to give the 'Quaker man' a slimmer, somewhat younger look. The man is now sometimes referred to as \\"Larry\\" by insiders at Quaker Oats. And in 1965, a new advertising slogan was introduced: \\"Nothing is better for thee, than me\\". The company states that their current 'Quaker man' logo \\"does not represent an actual person. His image is that of a man dressed in Quaker garb, including a Quaker hat, chosen because the Quaker faith projected the values of honesty, integrity, purity and strength.\\" The company has never had any ties with the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers). When the company was being built up, Quaker businessmen were known for their honesty (truth is often considered a Quaker testimony). The Straight Dope writes \\"According to the good folks at Quaker Oats, the Quaker Man was America's first registered trademark for a breakfast cereal, his registration taking place on September 4th, 1877.\\" Members of the Religious Society of Friends have occasionally expressed frustration at being confused with the Quaker Oats representation. In recent years, Friends have twice protested the Quaker name being used for advertising campaigns seen as promoting violence. In 1990, some Quakers started a letter-writing campaign after a Quaker Oats advertisement depicted Popeye as a \\"Quakerman\\" who used violence against aliens, sharks, and Bluto. Later that decade, more letters were sparked by Power Rangers toys included in Cap'n Crunch cereal. Informed consent controversy, research on children From 1946‚Äì1953, researchers from Quaker Oats Company, MIT and Harvard University carried out experiments at the Walter E. Fernald State School to determine how the minerals from cereals were metabolized. Parents of disabled children were asked for permission to let their children be members of a Science Club and participate in research. Being a member of the Science Club gave the children special privileges. The parents were told that the children would be fed with a diet high in nutrients. They were not told that the food their children were fed contained radioactive calcium and iron, and the consent form contained no information indicating this. The information obtained from the experiments was to be used as part of an advertising campaign. The company was later sued because of the experiments. The lawsuit was settled on 31 December 1997. =Trans fat content and litigation= In 2010, two California consumers filed a class action lawsuit against the Quaker Oats Company. Plaintiffs allege that Quaker marketed its products as healthy even though they contained unhealthy trans fat. Specifically, Quaker's Chewy Granola Bars, Instant Oatmeal, and Oatmeal to Go Bars contained trans fat, yet their packaging featured claims like \\"heart healthy,\\" \\"wholesome,\\" and \\"smart choices made easy.\\" Plaintiffs' complaint cites current scientific evidence that trans fat causes coronary heart diseaseDariush Mozaffarian et al, \\"Trans Fatty Acids and Cardiovascular Disease\\", New England Journal of Medicine, 2006. and is associated with a higher risk of diabetesFrank B. Hu et al, \\"Diet, Lifestyle, and the Risk of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Women\\", New England Journal of Medicine, September 2001. and some forms of cancer.Veronique Chajes et al, \\"Association between serum trans-monounsaturated fatty acids and breast cancer risk in the E3N-EPIC Study\\", Am J Epidemiology, 2008 June. In 2014, Quaker agreed to remove trans fats from its products at a cost of $1.4 million, although they deny false or misleading labelling.

The ship was scrapped in 2018. Description The ship was long overall and between perpendiculars with a beam of . The ship has a maximum draught of and a Saint Lawrence Seaway draught of . Algorail had a gross tonnage (GT) of 16,157 and a deadweight tonnage (DWT) of 23,320. Algorail was powered by four Fairbanks- Morse 10-38D8-1/8 diesel engines driving one shaft. The engines were rated at combined. The vessel was also equipped with one bow thruster and one stern thruster. The ship had a maximum speed of . The ship had four holds, 17 hatches and is equipped with a discharge boom that can swing 105 degrees to either side of the ship and discharges 3,810 tonnes per hour. Service history The ship was constructed by Collingwood Shipyards at their yard in Collingwood, Ontario with the yard number 189. Algorail was launched on 13 December 1967, christened on 1 April 1968 and completed that month. The second freighter of the name was registered at Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario for Algoma Central. A self-unloading bulk carrier, she is one of the last lake freighters built in the traditional two-superstructure style, with the bridge at the bow. The ship sails on the North American Great Lakes and the Saint Lawrence Seaway delivering coal/coke, aggregates, slag, iron ore/oxides, salt, fertilizers, grain products, gypsum, quartzite, or sand. On 6 October 1972, Algorail collided with the pier at Holland, Michigan loaded with a cargo of salt. The pier tore a hole in her bow, which caused the vessel to sink. The ship was refloated, repaired and put back into service. On 20 April 1999, Algorail ran aground at Green Bay, Wisconsin in the Fox River. The ship was undamaged, but attempts by two tugboats to free the ship damaged the docks at Green Bay. On 25 June 2013 she ran aground with a shipment of salt in the Saginaw River. Zilwaukee Dock Manager Jim Cnudde cited Algorails running aground as an indication that greater efforts should be made to keep the river dredged. The ship was freed after unloading some of her cargo into a barge. References Category:1967 ships Category:Great Lakes freighters Category:Algoma Central Marine Category:Transport in Sault Ste.

On June 30, it overran and killed 19 members of the Granite Mountain Hotshots. Just one of the hotshots on the crew survived‚Äîhe was posted as a lookout on the fire and was not with the others when the fire overtook them. The Yarnell Hill Fire was one of the deadliest U.S. wildfires since the 1991 East Bay Hills fire, which killed 25 people, and the deadliest wildland fire for U.S. firefighters since the 1933 Griffith Park fire, which killed 29 \\"impromptu\\" civilian firefighters drafted on short notice to help battle that Los Angeles area fire. Yarnell also killed more firefighters than any incident since 9/11. The Yarnell Hill Fire is the sixth- deadliest American firefighter disaster in history, the deadliest wildfire ever in the state of Arizona, and (at least until 2014) was \\"the most- publicized event in wildland firefighting history.\\" The tragedy is primarily attributed to an extreme and sudden shift in weather patterns, causing the fire to intensify and cut off the firefighters route as they were escaping. The victims were burned to death by the intense heat and flames of the fire. Other factors that contributed to the tragedy include the terrain surrounding the escape route, which may have blocked the victims' view of the fire front and limited situational awareness, and problems with radio communications.  Overview  At around 5:36 p.m. MST (23:36 UTC) on June 28, 2013, a spell of dry lightning ignited a wildfire on Bureau of Land Management lands near Yarnell, Arizona, a town of approximately 700 residents located about northwest of Phoenix. On June 30, winds blowing at over pushed the fire from to over . A long-term drought affecting the area contributed to the fire's rapid spread and erratic behavior, as did temperatures of . By July 1, the fire had expanded to over and prompted the evacuation of the nearby community of Peeples Valley. The fire was still completely uncontrolled, with more than 400 firefighters on the line. On July 2, the fire was estimated at 8% containment and had not grown in the past 24 hours. By the end of the day on July 3, the fire was reportedly 45 percent contained and showing no signs of expanding, thus allowing Peeples Valley residents to return to their homes on July 4. Four days later, on July 8, Yarnell residents were permitted to return. The fire was declared 100% contained on July 10. The Yavapai County Sheriff's Office said that 127 buildings in Yarnell and two in Peeples Valley had been destroyed. A \\"flash point\\" of the fire was the Glen Ilah neighborhood of Yarnell, where fewer than half of the structures were burned. Officials shut down of Arizona State Route 89 shortly after the fire started, and of State Route 89 remained closed as of June 30. A total evacuation of Yarnell and partial evacuation of Peeples Valley was ordered. At least 600 people were under mandatory evacuation orders. An evacuation shelter was set up at Yavapai College in Prescott, with members of the Red Cross providing cots and blankets for overnight stays, along with meals and medical assistance. A second evacuation shelter was assembled at Wickenburg High School in nearby Wickenburg, because the closure of State Route 89 made it impossible for some people to reach the first shelter. Officials from the Red Cross said that 351 people spent at least one night at one of the shelters.  Fatalities  On June 30, firefighters with the Prescott Fire Department's interagency Granite Mountain Hotshots were overrun and killed by the fire. Initial reports indicated that one of the firefighters was not a member of the hotshot crew, but Prescott Fire Chief Dan Fraijo later confirmed that all 19 were in league with the Granite Mountain Hotshots. The firefighters had apparently deployed fire shelters during the ambush, but the heat of the wildfire soared over . \\"The flames are seventy feet long, fed by air moving so fast that they are blown almost horizontal. They burn at 2,000 degrees. Granite slabs crack in the heat. Human lungs can survive one, maybe two breaths of 300-degree air.\\" However, not all of the bodies were found inside the fire shelters. The city of Prescott released the names of the 19 firefighters on July 1. The lone survivor from the 20-man crew was 21-year-old Brendan McDonough. He had been serving as a lookout when the fire threatened to overtake his position. McDonough contacted the Granite Mountain Hotshots' team by radio to let them know of his situation. He was told by the 2nd in command, Jesse Steed, to evacuate his position. McDonough was hiking out on foot when he was located by Brian Frisby, the superintendent of the Blue Ridge Hotshots, who was monitoring the radio communications between McDonough and the Granite Mountain IHC captain. Frisby and McDonough moved the crew's vehicles to a safer location, which they were doing at the time of Granite Mountain crew's entrapment. After moving the vehicles, Frisby and other members of the Blue Ridge Hotshots attempted to rescue the entrapped Granite Mountain Hotshots, but were forced back by the intense flames and heat of the fire. Driving through the streets of Yarnell, the Blue Ridge Hotshots evacuated several residents who had failed to evacuate earlier. At approximately 4:42 p.m., the fire overtook the Granite Mountain Hotshots position. When a helicopter was able to fly into the area over two hours later, Eric Tarr, a police officer/paramedic with the Arizona Department of Public Safety went in on foot and found the 19 bodies. They had deployed together in their fire shelters.(reference: \\"The Fire Line\\" by Fernanda Santos, pub. 2016). According to the National Fire Protection Association, it was the greatest loss of life for firefighters in a wildfire since the 1933 Griffith Park fire, the greatest loss of firefighters in the United States since the September 11 attacks in 2001, and the deadliest wildfire of any kind since the 1991 East Bay Hills fire. The number of total fatalities‚Äîalthough not of firefighters‚Äîhas since been surpassed by California's 2018 Camp fire which killed 85 civilians. = Reactions = On June 30, Arizona Governor Jan Brewer issued a statement offering her condolences. \\"This is as dark a day as I can remember,\\" she said. She ordered flags flown at half-staff in Arizona through July 19. President Barack Obama issued a statement on July 1, promising federal help and praising the 19 firefighters as heroes. Funeral procession for the victims FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate and United States Fire Administrator Ernest Mitchell issued similar statements on July 1. On July 2, members of the Arizona Cardinals visited one of the Red Cross shelters, and the team president donated US$100,000 to the 100 Club of Arizona, an organization that assists firefighters, police, and their families in crises. Authorities said that US$800,000 had been raised for the families of the victims as of July 4. On July 2, more than 3,000 people attended a public memorial service at an indoor stadium in Prescott Valley. Vice President Joe Biden, Arizona Governor Jan Brewer, and the team's lone surviving firefighter, Brendan McDonough, spoke at a memorial in Prescott on Tuesday, July 9. That memorial was attended by thousands, including representatives from over 100 hotshot crews across the country, and was streamed live by several media outlets. Individual memorial services were scheduled for later in the hometowns of the 19 firefighters. A nine-member investigative team of forest managers and safety experts arrived in Arizona on July 2\\\\. Their mission was to \\"understand what happened as completely as possible\\" to prevent similar incidents. Granite Mountain Hotshots Memorial State Park was created to honor the hotshots. A path leads from a parking area on Highway 89 up to an observation deck. A trail follows the last steps of the hotshots down to the fatality site where they made their last stand. Encircling the fatality site, 19 gabions, one for each hotshot, are united by chains. A second memorial has been placed at the intersection of State Route 89 and Hays Ranch Road in Peeples Valley. On March 3, 2019, the Arizona Hotshots of the Alliance of American Football retired the No. 19 jersey in honor of the nineteen fallen Granite Mountain Hotshots.  Aftermath  After the fire, the Federal Emergency Management Agency ruled that the fire did not qualify for disaster aid to homeowners because most of the homes that burned were insured. Under federal law, federal disaster relief is not available if there is insurance, and FEMA said: \\"damage to uninsured private residences from this was not beyond the response and recovery capabilities of the state (and) local governments and voluntary agencies.\\" Brewer appealed to President Obama to overturn the decision. Following a three-month investigation, the state's Forestry Division released a report and briefing video on September 28, 2013, which found no evidence of negligence nor recklessness in the deaths of the 19 firefighters and revealed that an airtanker carrying flame retardant was directly overhead as the firefighters died. The investigation did find some problems with radio communications due to heavy radio traffic and the fact that some radios were not programmed with appropriate tone guards. On December 4, 2013, the Industrial Commission of Arizona, which oversees workplace safety, blamed the state's Forestry Division for the deaths of the 19 firefighters, based on an investigation by the state's Division of Occupational Safety and Health. The Commission said that state fire officials knowingly put protection of property ahead of safety and should have pulled crews out earlier. The commission levied a $559,000 fine. Richard Brody, in The New Yorker: \\"The Story That 'Only the Brave' Leaves Out\\" (October 23, 2017), and Fernanda Santos, in The New York Times: \\"Money Splits a City Still Mourning Its Firefighters\\" (June 26, 2014) point out numerous cases of firefighters' and their survivors' benefits having been withheld, lawsuits, and acrimony among the local politicians, some citizens, and the survivors of the firefighters who died in the Yarnell Hill Fire that became so extreme that, as Santos observes: \\"Juliann Ashcraft decided to leave Prescott altogether to spare her four children the discomfort of whispers and glares.\\" Brody further points out \\"battles that the Hotshots‚Äô widows have faced over health insurance, taxes, labor law, and budgets, involving the online harassment of women\\". = In media = Outside magazine released the documentary film, The Granite Mountain Hotshots and the Yarnell Hill Fire (August 12, 2013), in which friends, relatives, colleagues, including Brendan McDonough‚Äîthe lone survivor of the Granite Mountain Hotshots-speak out. The U.S. Forest Service released a series of videos on November 10, 2014, that were shot by wildland firefighters on the day of the Yarnell Hill tragedy. The Forest Service website notes: \\"To be transparent with the public, the videos are presented exactly as they have been received. The redactions were done before these videos came into the possession of Arizona State Forestry.\\" In its coverage of these videos, Outside magazine posted and article and video excerpts.

The company was set up in 2013 as a joint venture between Etihad Rail (51%), the developer of the UAE's national railway network and Deutsche Bahn (DB) (49%), Europe's largest railway operator and infrastructure owner. Etihad Rail DB is responsible for the operations and maintenance of Stage One of the UAE's national railway network for Etihad Rail‚Äôs primary customer, the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC). Etihad Rail DB concluded an Operations & Maintenance (O&M;) Agreement with Etihad Rail in August 2013. UAE rail network Stage One is the first phase of the UAE's vision to build a mixed freight and passenger railway across the country. Stage Two will extend the railway geographically to the other Emirates as well as connect with partner Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) railway systems in the Sultanate of Oman and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Not only will the UAE's railway provide a valuable boost to sustainable and diversified economic growth and bring communities together across the Emirates, it will also be a concrete step to the development of a safe, more efficient and integrated system movement of freight and people across the region. Current activities In Stage One of the UAE's national railway network, Etihad Rail DB operates and maintains 264 km of railway route across the Western Region of the Abu Dhabi Emirate and transports granulated sulphur from the sour gas fields of Shah (Al Hosn Gas) and Habshan (GASCO) to the port of Ruwais in the Western Region of Abu Dhabi, where the sulphur product is exported. The spine of the network is the double track line between Liwa and Ruwais in the Western Region of Abu Dhabi. This section is designed to also operate passenger trains in the future. Etihad Rail DB is now set to provide 'Shadow Operator' services for stage two of the Etihad Rail project. The choice builds on the five years of expertise and Etihad Rail DB's outstanding success in managing Stage One operations and maintenance. In its 'Shadow Operator' role, Etihad Rail DB will aim to utilise its expertise and lessons learned from Stage One to provide consultancy services to Etihad Rail in preparation for stage two. Such services will include reviewing the design of stage two assets, developing Emiratization requirements, drawing up operational procedures and safety management plans and assisting to ensure the project is delivered with the optimum operations cost. Service delivery Since officially commencing commercial operations in January 2016, Etihad Rail DB has been responsible for the transport of up to 22,000 tonnes of granulated sulphur every day in trains of up to 110 wagons. Trains are hauled by 4,300 horsepower EMD SD-70 locomotives. In February 2017, Etihad Rail DB announced that it had safely run its 1,000th train for ADNOC. As of 20 January 2017, Etihad Rail DB confirmed that it had transported more than 10 million tonnes of sulphur in over 1 million hours worked with zero lost time injury (LTI) in a relatively short time since inception, which reflects its internal culture. Safety As of the first half of 2017, Etihad Rail DB had achieved its highest performance records against all international safety standards with no lost-time injuries. As railways are new to the region, a community safety campaign was undertaken in 2014 to educate the public on safety around rail tracks. Know-how transfer One of the key purposes of the Etihad Rail DB joint-venture is to facilitate knowledge transfer, the sharing of best practices, as well as providing the UAE with a world-class, modern, integrated and efficient rail network that will drive economic growth and social development. DB Rail Academy, the international training provider of DB Engineering&Consulting; GmbH, developed training programs for knowledge transfer and vocational training. In May 2016, Etihad Rail and Etihad Rail DB co-signed an MoU with the Abu Dhabi Vocational Education & Training Institute (ADVETI) related to occupational training. Under the terms of this MoU, the stakeholders operate occupational training and share knowledge for Emirati students seeking qualifications in the UAE's rail industry, in line with the goals of the country's Emiratization policy. This means that UAE Nationals will have skills across many disciplines needed to operate and maintain the railway such as maintenance and mechanical technicians. Moreover, Etihad Rail DB has also established a human resources excellence programme which is enabling UAE nationals to gain on-the-job experience.

Patrick Perkins, J. P., (10 October 1838 ‚Äî 17 May 1901), nicknamed Paddy Perkins, was a brewer and politician in colonial Queensland. He was a Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly and, later, a Member of the Queensland Legislative Council. Early life Patrick Perkins was born in a humble cottage on a small farm in the village of Clonoulty near Cashel, County Tipperary, Ireland. He was the second son of Thomas Perkins, a farmer, and his wife Ellen (n√©e Gooley). He attended the local National School. Thomas and Ellen Perkins and their eight children (including Patrick) immigrated on the Persian, departing Southampton and arrived in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia on 9 April 1854. In 1861, he married Mary Ellen Hickey in Victoria. They had four children born in Victoria:Thomas Hector (born 1864); Mary Eveleen, (1867-1942) m. Charles Seymour-Allan; Edgar Colin Francis (born 1868) and Lilly Eleanor Perkins (born 1875) m. Randall Macdonnell, m. George Wilkie Gray. They had two children born in Queensland: Patrick Harold (born 1878) and Helene Cicilia (born 1880, Toowoomba d 1965 Adelaide), Sr Margaret Mary of the Dominican priory, Adelaide. Business Patrick Perkins was a miner and storekeeper on the diggings in Victoria in districts including Ballarat, Bendigo, Woods Point and Jamieson. With his brother Thomas, he started breweries in Victoria and Queensland. In 1866, Patrick Perkins started the Perkins Brewery in Toowoomba. In 1872, he later extended his operations to Brisbane with the purchase of the City Brewery in 1872. In 1876, Patrick Perkins moved to Queensland in order to manage the Brisbane and Toowoomba breweries. Perkins also had interests in property and mining, including the Mount Morgan Mine and coal mining in the West Moreton area. He was considered a shrewd and successful business man. Politics On 9 April 1877, Edward Wilmot Pechey, the member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly in the seat of Aubigny, resigned. On 1 May 1877, in a by-election, Perkins was elected in Aubigny, defeating Angus Mackay (the then editor of The Queenslander) by a large majority. He was elected again in Aubigny in the 1878 election and was appointed as Minister of Lands in the First McIlwraith Ministry from 21 January 1879 to 13 November 1883. Perkins was elected again in Aubigny in the 1883 election, However, allegations about electoral fraud (including intimidation, bribery, and ballot stuffing) in the Aubigny election started to surface, resulting in a petition to the Governor of Queensland detailing numerous kind of electoral fraud and asking to declare that the Aubigny election was void and that Patrick Perkins was guilty of bribery and corruption. On 21 February 1884, the Committee of Elections and Qualifications ruled the Aubigny election was null and void and called for a by-election. Perkins had denied any involvement in the alleged electoral fraud and the Committee of Elections and Qualifications did not disqualify him from re- contesting the seat, which provoked outrage in some quarters. However, Patrick Perkins announced he would not re-contest the seat as he would be taking a trip to England. James Campbell was elected unopposed at the resulting by- election on 4 March 1884. At the 1888 election, Perkins was elected in the seat of Cambooya on 10 May 1888, which he held until 6 May 1893. On 23 May 1893, Perkins was appointed to Queensland Legislative Council from 23 May 1893. Being a lifetime appointment, he served until his death on 17 May 1901. The house \\"Aubigny\\" Aubigny, at North Quay, Brisbane, 1897, when Miss Lilly Perkins married Mr Randal McDonnell In 1883 used his wealth to buy a palatial home at 273 North Quay, Brisbane, which he called \\"Aubigny\\" after the electorate that first sent him to parliament. The house was originally built in 1870 by Samuel Davis, a Jewish businessman, and included a separate building used as Brisbane's first synagogue. Patrick Perkins used the former synagogue as a billiards room. In 1899, the Perkins family rented the property to the Criminal Investigation Department which used the house as offices and the synagogue as a photography room. In 1906, the house was sold to the Rev. Mother Patrick of the Sisters of Mercy to create the 20-bed Mater Misericordiae Hospital (now a tertiary hospital located at South Brisbane); the former synagogue being the hospital chapel. Once the hospital outgrew the house and relocated to the South Brisbane area where it still operates, the house was renamed \\"Loretto\\" and used as a hostel for Catholic girls; the former synagogue being the maids' quarters. In about 1939 the house was demolished to make way for the construction of a church for the Church of Christ, Scientist. Later life He attended the opening of the first Federal Parliament at the Royal Exhibition Building on 9 May 1901 and caught a chill which developed into bronchial pneumonia, from which he died on Friday 17 May 1901 at \\"Ingleborough\\", Berkeley Street, Hawthorn. On Saturday 18 May 1901, his funeral was conducted at the Roman Catholic church at Glenferrie, after which he was buried in the Boroondara General Cemetery in Kew, Melbourne. In 1928, the Perkins brewing company was bought by their rivals Castlemaine Brewery with new company being known as Castlemaine Perkins Limited.

It is a reboot of the 1982 film of the same name and is the fourth and final installment overall in the Poltergeist franchise. The film stars Sam Rockwell, Rosemarie DeWitt, Jared Harris and Jane Adams. Produced by Sam Raimi and Robert Tapert's Ghost House Pictures, Real World Pictures and Roy Lee's Vertigo Entertainment, the film was released on May 22, 2015 by 20th Century Fox and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in the United States. The film received mixed reviews from critics and grossed over $95 million worldwide against a budget of $35 million.  Plot  Eric and Amy Bowen are a married couple looking to buy a house for themselves and their three children: 16-year-old daughter Kendra (Saxon Sharbino), 9-year-old son Griffin (Kyle Catlett), and 6-year-old daughter Madison (Kennedi Clements). Eric was recently laid off, but they are shown a house that has recently come on the market that fits their price range, so they purchase it and move in. The first night, they hear strange noises in the walls and Griffin finds a box containing clown dolls that were left at the house. In the middle of the night, lights and electronic devices start turning on and off, as an unseen force appears to move through the home. The commotion wakes Griffin, and he goes downstairs and finds Maddie talking to an unknown presence inside the television. She tells Griffin someone is coming, and he attempts to unplug the TV, causing the lights to go out of control. Maddie then tells the family \\"They're here\\" while touching their TV screen. The following evening, Eric and Amy go to dinner with their friends, leaving the three children at home. They learn that their house was built on an old cemetery, although the property developer was supposed to have relocated the human remains. Kendra wakes up to a strange sound in the laundry room. While investigating the noise, the floor cracks and a corpse's hand emerges. It begins pulling at her foot, but she manages to pull herself up. Meanwhile, Griffin notices the clown dolls seem to be moving by themselves. One clown doll attacks him, but he destroys it with his foot and runs from his bedroom. He finds Maddie in her room, scared, crouching in a corner, and tells her to stay while he goes to find Kendra. Maddie is then lured by the light from her lamp and her favorite toy into her closet, becoming lost in an unending void. As she turns to see her bedroom drifting away further, she is dragged into the darkness by ghosts. Griffin is grabbed through a window by the branches of the old tree outside their house, which pulls him outside. Amy and Eric arrive home to see Griffin being tossed around in the tree branches, which releases its grip when they come close, while Kendra hysterically tells them she cannot find Maddie. The family hears Maddie's voice emanating from the television. Amy places her hand on the television screen while Maddie's static hand is seen to be touching Amy's hand from the other side of the screen. Amy and Griffin visit the Paranormal Research department for help. The staff set up equipment in the house and install GPS devices on everyone in the house. During the setup, Boyd has a near death experience in drilling a hole in the wall, yanked in by spirits by his arm. While trying to contact Maddie, Eric is ambushed in the closet by a ghost resembling her. Angered, he breaks down the closet wall, throwing a section of a broken table into the darkness inside the closet; the table segment falls back into the living room (nearly crushing Griffin), revealing a potential portal for Maddie to escape through. The investigators deduce and confirm that the haunting is caused by a poltergeist. The lead investigator, Dr. Brooke Powell, decides to call occult specialist and television personality Carrigan Burke (revealed, much later, to be Powell's ex). Carrigan explains that Maddie is a possible psychic, able to communicate with spirits. He reveals that the ghosts are trapped and are angry because only the headstones were moved to the new cemetery, but the bodies remain; they plan on using Maddie \\"to free them from their purgatory\\". Carrigan comes up with a plan to get Maddie back. He anchors a rope in Maddie's room and tosses it into the vortex. They attempt to use Griffin's toy drone to guide Maddie out, but it is immediately destroyed by the ghosts when inside the portal. Griffin, guilt-ridden over leaving Maddie alone in the first place, goes through the portal himself. When he finds Maddie, the ghosts attempt to destroy the rope to trap them, but Griffin and Maddie grab onto the rope and fall back through the portal into the house. Both children are unconscious and covered in grey matter, to which Carrigan instructs for them to be washed and they awake. The family get in their car and begin to leave the house, but the ghosts drag them back into the house and attempt to abduct Maddie again, flipping the car in the process. Maddie is seen being abducted up the stairs. The family saves her from being sucked into the portal, and Carrigan decides that as the only other psychic, he must go into the vortex and lead the spirits into the light. Kendra stamps and destroys the television screen as ghosts' hands are seen, trying to communicate with Maddie. The Bowens flee the neighbourhood as the house is destroyed by the spirits soaring into the sky as a beacon of light. The investigative team run to their equipment, looking for a sign that Carrigan managed to get back. As the Bowens look for a new house, the realtor shows them a house with much closet space and an old tree in the backyard but the Bowens drive away laughing. During the end credits, it is revealed that Carrigan survived the incident and is back filming his ghost program, now hosting the show with Dr. Powell.

The site's consensus reads: \\"Paying competent homage without adding anything of real value to the original Poltergeist, this remake proves just as ephemeral (but half as haunting) as its titular spirit.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 47 out of 100 based on 27 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"C+\\" on an A+ to F scale. Writing for Variety, Andrew Barker called it \\"generally entertaining yet fundamentally unnecessary\\" and concluded: \\"Even when one is inclined to admire the cleverness with which the remake revisits and reincorporates Poltergeists themes, it‚Äôs hard to pinpoint a single moment where it improves on them, and the aura of inessentiality hangs thick over the proceedings\\". Neil Genzlinger gave the film a mostly positive review in The New York Times, writing: \\"The new Poltergeist might well be the scariest movie 13-or-unders have yet seen, just as the original was for their parents back in 1982. Those parents might find it an enjoyable trip down memory lane, even if they do now recognize it as largely a well-served collection of horror-movie tropes\\". Eddie Goldberger echoed that sentiment in The New York Daily News, writing \\"It doesn't approach the original--really, how could it? But the new Poltergeist is a fun, worthy horror entry.\\" Tirdad Derakhshani wrote in The Philadelphia Inquirer: \\"It's not exactly a scary film, but it does provide an enjoyable ride. It's good fun. But it left me befuddled\\", adding: \\"Why would anyone want to remake Poltergeist in the first place?\\". Writing in The Daily Telegraph, Mike McCahill called the film \\"an efficient scare-machine\\". Bilge Ebiri wrote in New York magazine: \\"This new Poltergeist isn't anything special... But it's not a travesty, and that feels like cause for brief celebration\\". Other critics took a more skeptical view of the film. Writing a review for The Village Voice, Alan Scherstuhl stated, \\"Poltergeist 2015 is to Poltergeist '82 what today's shipped-frozen-to-the-store Pizza Hut dough is to the kneaded-on- site pies the chain's stoned cooks tossed in the Reagan era. It's the same kind of thing, with the same shape and some shared ingredients, but the texture's gone limp, and there's no sense of occasion about it, and there's some unpalatable goop stuffed in the crust. In a pinch, it beats pizzalessness ‚Äî but just barely.\\" Linda Cook wrote in The Quad City Times, \\"The Poltergeist remake is OK, but won't stay with you.\\" Randy Cordova in The Arizona Republic wrote, \\"Ultimately, the whole affair is forgettable.\\"Review: 'Poltergeist' remake lacks menace, azcentral.com, 22 May 2015 = Box office = Poltergeist grossed $47.4 million in North America and $48.2 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $95.6 million against a budget of an estimated $35 million.

Jeffs is an American author, advocate, and member of the influential Jeffs family in the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS Church). Jeffs wrote the memoir Lost Boy along with author Maia Szalavitz, which was released on May 19, 2009. The book is a depiction of life within the FLDS Church and his ostracism from the organization at a young age. The title of the book comes from the term \\"the lost boys\\", which refers to the many young men expelled from the FLDS Church. Jeffs is a grandson of FLDS prophet Rulon Jeffs, nephew to imprisoned FLDS prophet Warren Jeffs and Lyle Jeffs, and his mother is the daughter of another non-FLDS prophet as well. Jeffs was born to Ward Jeffs, son of Rulon Jeffs. Ward had three wives, two of whom were sisters. Between these marriages, Brent had nineteen siblings. Ward eventually left the church, leaving Brent in the FLDS community per Brent's request. Eventually, Brent left the compound and moved into a small apartment with four of his older brothers, where they experimented with alcohol, drug use and partying. In 2004 Jeffs named Warren Jeffs as the perpetrator in a civil lawsuit seeking damages for sexual abuse he had suffered as a boy. Lost Boy depicts much of the sexual abuse that was inflicted upon him beginning at ages 5 or 6. The memoir also includes abuse from Warren's brothers and other family members. Jeffs has appeared on the NPR radio show, Fresh Air, hosted by interviewer Teri Gross, the television show Polygamy: What Love Is This?, Hannity and Dr. Phil, with each appearance having to do with the FLDS and polygamy. In each appearance Jeffs discusses the dangers of the FLDS lifestyle and abuse from Warren Jeffs and other influential FLDS Church leaders.

The novel won the Kendra Sahitya Akademi Award and the N. V. Prize. It was adapted into a film by noted director Lenin Rajendran in 1992. Plot summary The story begins in 1950s, when the French, the colonial rulers were packing off from Mah√©, a coastal town in North Malabar, after 230 years, leaving behind remnants of a cultural history. Those, who considered themselves as belonging to Francophone culture, jumped onto the first available vessel to France. And many of the older generation, orphaned by the departure of the French, struggle to eke out a living even as they remember their days of plenty under their foreign masters. Caught up in their suffering, Kumaran Vaidyar does everything he can to keep the people of his beloved Mayyazhi from starving, but entrusts his own children to the care of his wife, who is no more. Meanwhile, Father Alphonse waves his magic wand and changes pebbles into candy and waits for his good-looking son to return. Through all this, untroubled by the woes of the elders, Shivan, Shashi and Elsie spend an idyllic childhood in sunny, sleepy Mayyazhi. Until the day of reckoning catches up with them and they pay the price of growing up.

The march began March 1, 2014, in Wilmington neighborhood in South Los Angeles, California, and ended on November 1, 2014, when marchers arrived in Washington, D.C. Along the route, participants engaged with the general public and elected officials in order to inspire society to address climate change. In the end, a group of 34 people traveled the entire route from Los Angeles, California, to Washington D.C., and five people walked every step from LA to DC. In a Des Moines Register interview, Fallon said, \\"We think it's very important. We think this is a tool that will help mobilize people to understand the problem and to do more about it‚Ä¶this needs to become the defining issue of this century.\\" Fallon was inspired in part by another cross-country march, the 1986 Great Peace March for Global Nuclear Disarmament, for which he coordinated the Iowa logistics. Although this was a national campaign, it was intended to have an international audience and to include participants from multiple nations. The headquarters of the non-profit are located in Des Moines, Iowa. As of October 2013, they had six staff, had raised $120,000, and earned endorsements from 350.org, James Hansen, U.S. Senator Tom Harkin, and Congressman Bruce Braley. March route The marchers departed from Santa Monica, California on March 1, 2014, traveling through Nebraska (focus on the Keystone Pipeline) and ended in Washington, D.C. in November, 2014. The route passed through California, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Washington, D.C. and the following cities (unverified): Reasons for marching Reverend Bob Cook planned to take part in the march. \\"The Des Moines pastor‚Äôs life work has been for the poor, but he doesn‚Äôt view the Great March for Climate Action as a departure. The poor are affected most by climate change, as they are from most troubling world events, Cook said.\\" Ben Bushwick, a student at Ohio University, marched most of the way. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm marching because quite frankly I don‚Äôt see any other choice,‚Äù Bushwick said. ‚ÄúAtmospheric disruption is a real threat that people do not take seriously and will make mitigation and adaptation efforts a lot more difficult.‚Äù Faith Meckley, a student at Ithaca College, says, ‚ÄúI was interested, but only for a three-week walk from Pittsburgh to Washington. ... After thinking about it and talking to my academic advisor at Ithaca, I decided to take the spring semester off and do the walk from Taos, N.M., to Washington. I am committed to this issue. I want to do more than my environmental blog and sign petitions. I have a respect for the planet.‚Äù In line with her commitment, she left the march early to protest storage of liquefied petroleum gas and natural gas in her hometown region of Seneca Lake, New York. Logistics An average day‚Äôs walk was expected to be 14‚Äì15 miles. Campsites for tents were prearranged. Organizers had hoped to haul all of the gear and supplies via bicycles to minimize energy consumption and maximize sustainability, but after some intensive research this proved infeasible, so trucks running on biodiesel or vegetable oil fuel were used. Research into solar cookers, composting toilets, determined how far the marchers were able to use sustainable methods to handle food and energy needs, and human waste. Participants and volunteers shared daily chores including but not limited to setting up camp, food preparation and clean-up. Interactive workshops focused on climate change, the anthropogenic effect on the environment, and active solutions. Other activist marches in political and social change Throughout history, marches have been associated with political and social change. Examples include but are not limited to: the Woman Suffrage Parade of 1913, Gandhi's Salt March to defy Britain's imperial power, Martin Luther King Jr's Selma to Montgomery marches for voting rights and the Great Peace March for Global Nuclear Disarmament. Peace walks have been particularly popular in the peace movement.

Wang formally launched Tudou online on April 15, 2005, and the website soon took off. Tudou started as a website hosting user-generated content (UGC), but soon expanded to include UGC, premium licensed content and content developed in-house, commonly described as a combination of the YouTube, Hulu, and HBO business models.

The special was billed as a highwire walk across \\"the majestic Grand Canyon\\". Interpretations varied as to whether the actual location ‚Äì the Little Colorado River Gorge in Navajo territory outside Grand Canyon National Park's borders ‚Äì was truly part of the Grand Canyon. Highwire artist Nik Wallenda had been planning to walk across the canyon since 2008, but put the plan on hold first due to logistical difficulties and then to highwire walk over Niagara Falls in 2012. After his success at Niagara, he accelerated plans to cross the canyon. In March 2013, Wallenda and Discovery came to terms on television rights for the walk. To prepare, Wallenda practiced in his home town of Sarasota, Florida in heavy winds, including during Tropical Storm Andrea. On June 23, he successfully completed the walk without safety devices in approximately 23 minutes, making him the first person to tightrope walk across a Grand Canyon area gorge. At , it was the highest walk of his career. Afterwards, Wallenda said it was more difficult than he had expected. Skywire Live aired live in over 200 countries worldwide. It was a ratings success in the United States, generating Discovery's highest-ever rating for a live broadcast. The show also generated a lot of interest of social media, with Wallenda's public display of his Christian faith being a focal point. Background Nik Wallenda is American highwire artist and member of the famed Flying Wallendas circus family. He has been walking the wire since age two and now holds seven world records. In 2008, he set the record for highest and longest bicycle ride across a tightrope. In 2012, he became the first person to successfully tightrope walk directly over Niagara Falls. The feat aired live on ABC who, much to the dismay of Wallenda, decided at the last minute that he would have to wear a safety harness for the event. The Grand Canyon area has played host to a number of high-profile stunts and daredevil feats. In 1922, Royal Thomas flew a Lincoln Stanard biplane into Grand Canyon National Park, landing just from the Canyon's edge. The park did not yet have stunting regulations and the feat was approved by park superintendent Walter Crosby. In 1980, stuntman Dar Robinson drove a sportscar over the canyon's edge, parachuting out of the car as it fell. He did the stunt in Hualapai Indian Reservation after being denied a permit by the National Park. In 1999, daredevil Robbie Knievel jumped a narrow portion of canyon in Hualapai territory on a motorcycle, breaking his own world record for longest jump in the process. The event aired live on Fox News. In 2006, Bob Burnquist skateboarded off a ramp into the canyon, descending to the bottom with a parachute. In 2011, Yves \\"Jetman\\" Rossy used a custom made jet suit to glide above the Hualapai reservation for eight minutes. He covered a distance of before parachuting into the canyon. Planning Nik Wallenda originally secured permits to walk across \\"the Grand Canyon\\" in 2008, and planned to make the trip as early as 2009. However, the walk was delayed due to substantial logistical hurdles. His agent, Winston Simone, commented \\"There's no electricity [at the planned location], there's no hotels, and for the last half-hour there are no paved roads.\\" Additionally, at a then-estimated distance of , the feat would be the longest walk of Wallenda's career by a significant margin. When the opportunity to cross Niagara Falls arose, the Grand Canyon walk was put on hold. Shortly after crossing Niagara Falls, Wallenda said he would try to make the Grand Canyon crossing \\"within a year\\". In August 2012, he said that he was \\"98 percent\\" certain that the walk would take place in May or June 2013 and announced he would get \\"something in writing\\" that no safety harness would be required for the walk. Wallenda simulates windy conditions using a large fan, June 14, 2013. On March 18, 2013, Wallenda announced that he had come to terms with The Discovery Channel for television rights. ABC also bid for the walk, but was concerned about the show being repetitive with the Niagara walk and was not prepared to pay as much as Discovery. Additionally, Discovery emphasized its international footprint and promised Wallenda that he would not have to wear a safety device. After he came to terms with Discovery, both Wallenda and his network partners had to finalize permits with the Navajo. According to a tribal spokesperson, the decision to allow the walk was not taken lightly. The process included archaeological, biological, and environmental impact studies. The air temperature during the walk was expected to exceed , with the steel cable hitting . To prepare, Wallenda walked a wire twice daily along the banks of a Sarasota river with fans watching. He practiced with wind machines to simulate wind gusts up to . During Tropical Storm Andrea he practiced among wind gusts and heavy rain. Wallenda said it was \\"hard to prepare for [the updrafts] ... when it comes down to Mother Nature, we‚Äôre not in control.\\" His highwire shoes, which are custom made by his mother, had elk-skin bottoms to counteract the heat. On June 19, Discovery aired a special episode of MythBusters titled \\"Duct Tape Canyon\\" to coincide with Wallenda's walk. On the episode, Wallenda appears to the show's team as a hallucination as they attempt to survive in the desert using only duct tape. Location Little Colorado River gorge near Grand Canyon National Park. On June 23, 2013, Wallenda highwire walked across the Little Colorado River Gorge in the Navajo Tribal Park. The location was outside Grand Canyon National Park's borders, about 40 miles east of the main tourist facilities. In its official press release, Discovery previewed the feat \\"Nik Wallenda ... will traverse the majestic Grand Canyon\\". Other interpretations of whether or not the location was part of the Grand Canyon varied. The Reuters news agency described the location as simply \\"the Grand Canyon\\", while the Associated Press described it as a \\"gorge near the Grand Canyon.\\" Commentary by Forbes writer Andrew Bender said there was \\"one problem\\" with the walk ‚Äì \\"It [wasn't] at the Grand Canyon\\". He did, however, say the risks were as real and the visuals as spectacular at the location. National Geographic described the location as \\"the Grand Canyon\\" but noted that, like previous \\"Grand Canyon\\" stunts, it was taking place outside the park's borders. According to the United States Geological Survey, the Grand Canyon geological area includes the Little Colorado River Gorge. A Grand Canyon National Park spokesperson said the walk \\"would not have been approved\\" to take place in the Park due to regulations that \\"events must not unreasonably impair the park‚Äôs atmosphere of peace and tranquility or have an unacceptable impact on the experience of park visitors.\\" The walk The event, entitled Skywire Live, aired live on the Discovery Channel in 219 countries with a 10-second delay. Coverage began with an hour-and-ten-minute preshow, followed by an hour-and-ten-minute main event. It was produced by Peacock Productions and hosted by Natalie Morales and Willie Geist. During the event, viewers were able to select from five different camera angles online at SkywireLive.com, including one attached to his chest that faced straight down. Another camera attached to Wallenda faced straight ahead, and a film crew filmed from the bottom of the Canyon. Wallenda practices walking the wire in Sarasota, Florida on June 14, 2013. Before the walk started, Wallenda and his family prayed with evangelist and family friend Joel Osteen. He was then helicoptered to an island in the middle of the canyon to start his journey. To limit environmental impact, the event was not open to the public. Members of the press were required to sign a waiver saying they would not sue for post-traumatic stress disorder in the event that Wallenda fell. An armed security guard was positioned at the bottom of the canyon to protect his body from animals. As the walk began at 7:38pm MDT, Wallenda realized the wire had become slippery due to gathered dust. He spat on his hands and rubbed his shoes for better grip. Shortly thereafter, he stopped and crouched down on the wire due to wind gusts. He later stopped a second time to break the bounce of the wire that his walking had induced. Throughout the walk, Wallenda could be heard praying, repeatedly saying \\"Help me to relax, Lord\\", \\"God, you‚Äôre so good. Thank you for this opportunity, Lord\\", and \\"Thank you, Jesus.\\" Midway through he said \\"Thank you Lord. Thank you for calming that cable, God\\". Wallenda ran the last few steps then jumped off and kissed the ground. Completing the walk in 22 minutes, 54 seconds, Wallenda became the first person to highwire walk across a Grand Canyon area gorge. At , the walk was the highest of Wallenda's career, about seven times as high as the Niagara crossing. He covered a distance of approximately in 22 minutes, 54 seconds, using wire. He carried a balancing pole weighing . Wallenda said it was important for him to vary his pace throughout the walk to prevent resonance effects. Terry and Mike Troffer were his safety coordinator and chief engineer, respectively, for the event. Commenting on the walk, a Navajo spokesman said, \\"We are honored to be a part of this historic event and showcase the beauty that exists on Navajo country,\\" and said he expected the event to boost tourism. Tribal president Ben Shelly said he was grateful for the publicity. \\"It‚Äôs exposing what a beautiful land we have\\", he said. \\"Another nation exists, and it's the Navajo Nation.\\" However, a group of Navajo and other Native Americans protested the event saying the tribe should not be promoting the risking of human life to promote tourism. The Navajos did not charge for the use of the site, but Discovery did pay for the paving of a new road and parking lot to accommodate spectators. A crowd gathers to watch Wallenda practice for his Grand Canyon walk After the walk, Wallenda said it was more difficult than he had expected and that \\"it took every bit of me to stay focused\\". He said that dust had accumulated in his contact lenses and called the walk unusually stressful. Additionally, he said an \\"optical illusion\\" made it hard to concentrate. However, he called the view breathtaking, and said the opportunity \\"was a dream come true.\\" Ratings Skywire Live With Nik Wallenda drew an average of 10.7 million viewers in the United States, making it the highest rated program of the night. It beat out NBC's Crossing Lines (4.4 million viewers) and CBS's 60 Minutes (8.2 million) among other offerings. Viewership increased steadily throughout the program, with a spike as the walk itself began. During the walk, 13 million people were tuned in. Those numbers made Skywire Live the highest rated live program in Discovery's history, easily beating the 4.21 million people who watched Felix Baumgartner's skydive in October 2012, and third-highest overall. The 4.77 share during the actual walk was also the highest in company history. Pre- coverage of the walk also pulled in high numbers, attracting 6.25 million viewers. Naked and Afraid which debuted after Skywire attracted 4.16 million viewers. Overall, Discovery had its fourth highest-ranked night ever. Online coverage attracted 2.1 million viewers, and tweets hit 40,000 per minute. During the peak hour, the program had 648,000 mentions on Twitter. The premiere of a \\"Snuffy the Seal\\" advertising campaign for Shark Week during the special also attracted attention on social media during the special. Overall, the show won 71% of TV-related social media usage for the day. To capitalize on the program's success, Discovery aired a follow-up interview, Skywire: Nik Talks the Walk, on June 30. In the special, Wallenda provided commentary on his walk as the entire 23 minute feat was replayed. Reaction Wallenda sits on the wire during a June 16 practice. Commentary by Sally Jenkins published by the Washington Post called Wallenda \\"The ultimate athlete, free of all law except gravity ... Beyond criticism. Committing a pointless act ‚Äî yet praying.\\" Jenkins remarked \\"We thought daredevils were gone ‚Äî too much science had reduced them to the predictable ... But along has come this new breed.\\" Comparing Wallenda and Baumgartner's record skydive that also aired on Discovery, she speculated that the emergence of online media combined with \\"stale, stupid predictability\\" of television shows has led the re-emergence of interest in daredevil activity. She concluded \\"Wallenda‚Äôs meaningless act restored the meaning of real.\\" The Telegraph's Ben Fogle declared \\"I have never felt such fear for another person ... I have a new superhero: not a superman with a cape, but a slightly tubby dad in jeans and a T-shirt.\\" On social media, Wallenda's prominent display of his faith was the most popular topic. Conservative talk show host Dana Loesch tweeted \\"Evangelism via entertainment on a tightrope and a major cable network. Brilliant.\\" In contrast comedian and noted atheist Ricky Gervais poked fun saying \\"Well done Jesus for getting that bloke across the Grand Canyon safely. I bet he feels silly for wasting so much time practicing now.\\" Actor Dean Norris remarked \\"Regardless of religious belief or not,feel little happier bout life then had #wallenda kept saying thank you nihilists, life is meaningless.\\" Interviewing Joel Osteen after Wallenda's walk, Piers Morgan called the event \\"an advertisement for the power of prayer and Christianity in America\\". Blue jeans manufacture Buffalo David Bitton was surprised that Wallenda wore a pair of their jeans for the walk. To celebrate, they erected a billboard showing a picture of the walk and reading \\"Dear Nik, Thanks for taking us to new heights. Buffalo David Bitton.\\" The company also offered Wallenda and his immediate family free jeans for the rest of their lives.

Quick Count  LSI conducts Quick Counts during General Elections and District Head Elections (Pilkada.) The vast and geographical nature of Indonesia tend to cause delayed announcements of election results‚Äîtypically, those results can only be known around 2 weeks or even 1 month after the election. Once, people required a significant amount of time in order to finding out the victors of such elections, and this can cause a less than conducive atmosphere on the political situation on areas where those elections are held. Participants of the elections may take numerous visits to the office The General Election Commission (KPU) demanding the results‚Äîvisits that are often accompanied with violence and demonstration, which in turn will cause a domino effect on the stability of the region (either economically or socially.) These undesirable possibilities of outcomes can be mitigated by using Quick Count: a rapid counting method using scientifically collected results from voting locations (TPS) during electionsMelissa Estok,, Neil Nevitte and Glenn Cowan, The Quick Count and Election Observation, New York, National Democratic Institute (NDI), 2003, page 1-3. Done correctly, Quick Count can achieve a result with less than 1% margin of error compared to the official results announced by the General Election Commission (KPU). Through Quick Count, result calculation can be finished very rapidly‚Äîat the very least, only 4 hours after the votes are officially collected and counted the results can already be summarized and concluded. Since 2005, LSI has conducted hundreds of Quick Counts and made the results available via press conferences and national television channels TV One and Metro TV. The Indonesia Museum of Record (MURI) gifted LSI with various awards such as (1) The Quick Count Accuracy for Sumbawa Election on November 2010 with 0% margin of error when compared to official results. . Before that record, Lingkaran Survei Indonesia has also achieved a record for Quick Count results for the District Head Election on East Tanjung Jabung, Jambi, with only 0.05% difference when compared to the official results‚ÄúBisnis Menggiurkan dari Arena Politik‚Äù, Suara Merdeka Newspaper, October 21st, 2008. (2) The Fastest Announced Accurate Quick Count results (1 hour post voting period ends) on 2009 Presidential Election. This Quick Count was broadcast live by TV One. (3) The first 100 times successively accurate Quick Count results  Public opinion maker  Since 2005, LSI has conducted national surveys to gauge public opinion regarding various public issues/policies, such as democracy, Islam, tolerance and the performance of public institutions.  Quick Poll  Quick Poll Process Quick Poll is a type of survey introduced by LSI in 2011. Quick Poll results are routinely broadcast by tvOne every Monday and Thursday Quick Poll displays results on how public view recent, up-to-date cases and issues. Quick Poll is a quick survey of public opinion. The main point of difference is that the interview is not done face to face but rather by utilizing handsets connected to all selected respondents. In order to create a representative group of respondents (representing targeted populations in Indonesia), the Quick Poll is conducted in three steps. The first step is the respondent selection process. In this first step, respondents‚Äô characteristic data will be recorded as comprehensively as possible‚Äîfrom job, income, household expenditure, religion, race, education, and any other relevant information. This data includes not only the selected respondent but also his/her members of family. The second step is to give the selected respondent a handset; for a certain kind of respondent however (for example, those who are illiterate or those living in secluded area with no signal), special treatment will be given. The third step is conducting interviews through the handset‚Äîall answers from the respondent will be automatically recorded into the server that has been equipped with automatic data processing function able to computerize all data fed into it.

Ennis (1908‚Äì1990) was an American civil rights lawyer. He worked for the Department of Justice in the 1930s and 1940s, where as director of the alien enemy control unit he oversaw the Japanese American internment. He contributed to the American Civil Liberties Union's efforts to fight the internment, and after World War II resigned from the Department of Justice to join the ACLU, where he rose up through the organization and eventually served as its president from 1969 to 1976. Career Ennis graduated from Columbia University Law School in 1932, and went on to work for the Department of Justice for fourteen years. He was a member of the National Lawyers Guild in the 1930s, but withdrew from the organization, believing it to be under the influence of Communists. He held a variety of positions in the Department of Justice, including as general counsel for the Immigration and Naturalization Service, director of the alien enemy control unit, and administrator of foreign travel control. His role made him the administrator of the Japanese American internment. Ennis chose not resign from his role at that time, but he did help American Civil Liberties Union head Roger Baldwin to come up with legal strategies to oppose the internment, and testified at the trial of Gordon Hirabayashi about the Department of War's withholding of evidence relating to Japanese Americans' loyalty to the United States. In 1946, Ennis did resign from the Department of Justice, and joined the board of the ACLU himself. He became the ACLU's general counsel in 1955, and was elected chairman of the ACLU in 1969, succeeding Ernest Angell who was retiring after 19 years with the organization. He served as ACLU president until 1976, during which time he called for the resignation of President Richard Nixon and an end to the property tax exemption enjoyed by religious organizations. Notwithstanding the former, he was critical of the zealousness of opposition to Nixon shown by Charles Morgan, Jr. of the ACLU's Washington, D.C. office. He was succeeded as ACLU president by Norman Dorsen. He remained a member of the ACLU executive committee until 1985. Death Ennis died of diabetes complications on January 7, 1990 at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. He was survived by his wife Marie Joyce and his stepson Mark C. Zauderer.

The episode is written by David Wiener and is directed by Keith Gordon. In the episode, Detective Holder (Joel Kinnaman) and Sarah Linden (Mireille Enos) revisit the Seward case in hopes of finding a connection with the current one. Bullet (Bex Taylor-Klaus) takes Danette Leeds (Amy Seimetz) to Kallie's favorite hangouts. Seward (Peter Sarsgaard) asks to speak to his imprisoned father (Duncan Fraser).  Plot  At the police station, Danette demands to see Linden, telling the desk sergeant that Joe Mills (Ryan Robbins) took her daughter. She causes a commotion and gets arrested. At the hospital, Linden and Holder question Angie Gower (Laine MacNeil), the victim found at the vet's office. Angie describes her encounter, adding that she saw his eyes in the rear view mirror but could not see his face. Linden shows her a photo lineup that includes Mills. She cannot identify any of them as her attacker and Linden is frustrated. In the hallway, Holder scolds Linden for pushing the girl too hard. He questions if Mills is the right suspect, after Angie's inability to identify Mills and the lack of evidence connecting Mills with Trisha Seward's murder. Linden argues that fear may have stopped Angie from identifying Mills. Reddick (Gregg Henry) arrives to tell Holder the vet tech didn't see the person who dropped Angie at the clinic. Linden goes to the station to speak with Danette. She tells Danette that Mills has already left the hotel. Danette reminisces about Kallie's childhood and begs Linden to find her. That night at the prison, Seward hears Alton (James Lewis) tearing sheets in his cell to make a noose. At first, he tries to talk Alton out of committing suicide but can see that Alton has made up his mind. Alton asks Seward not to yell for the guards, and Seward complies, speaking a few encouraging words as Alton hangs himself from his cell window. Henderson (Aaron Douglas) arrives late to work and learns that Becker already left. The cell block has not been monitored. He finds Alton's body and immediately calls for medical assistance. At the station, Linden and Holder update Skinner (Elias Koteas) on Gower and Mills. In Skinner's office, Adrian's foster parents (Paul McGillion and Ingrid Torrence) complain about Linden's visiting Adrian at the playground. They say he's now back to sleeping in the closet, a habit he had throughout his early childhood. In her car, Linden shows Holder photos and the apartment floor plan from the Seward file, which he realizes she's had all along. Since there's no closet in Adrian's bedroom, Linden realizes he may have slept in the closet in the room where Trisha was murdered. They break into the vacant Seward apartment and Linden lies down in the closet, where she discovers glow-in-the-dark stars on the ceiling. She peers through an air vent at the bottom of the closet door and is able to see Holder when he stands in the spot where Trisha was murdered. She concludes that if Adrian were sleeping in the closet that night, then he must have seen his mother's killer. In Skinner's office, Linden tells him the new theory about Adrian and again points out similarities between Trisha Seward's murder and the other victims'. Skinner still isn't convinced there's a connection. She tells him the two of them are responsible for preventing Seward's execution, if he is innocent. He worries that she is getting \\"too close\\" to the case again and reminds her that it was hard for him when she fell apart during their initial investigation a few years ago. Still frustrated, she leaves after he instructs her to focus on finding Mills. Henderson asks Seward why he didn't help Alton by calling for the guards. Seward states that he did \\"help\\" him. In a visitation room, Seward sits across from his imprisoned father, who is surprised his son wanted to meet with him. Seward explains that something changed his mind. His father tells him that he \\"called in a favor\\" to get the razor blade to his son, hoping he would attack Becker. He also takes credit for his son's toughness, saying he taught him some things. Seward scoffs at the skewed perception of their relationship and reminds him that he abandoned their family, leaving them practically starving. As Seward leaves, his father says he's proud of him for serving his sentence like a man. Seward replies that dying in a jumpsuit doesn't make him a man. Danette approaches Bullet in an alley, asking if she knows where Kallie might be. Bullet takes her to the riverfront, a favorite spot of Kallie's. Danette reminisces about playing hide-and-seek with a younger Kallie, who would never hide. Bullet tells her Kallie will be okay. Bullet later finds Lyric (Julia Sarah Stone) alone in her hotel room, upset about Twitch. Lyric asks Bullet to keep her warm in bed, and they discuss Kallie. She tells Bullet that she notices her, and the two kiss. Linden visits Seward to ask if he knows Mills. He says no. She mentions that Adrian possibly saw Trisha's killer‚Äîadding that she knows Ray didn't kill his wife‚Äîand tries to solicit his help in getting Adrian to discuss what he remembers. Seward rages at Linden for coming to this realization 3 years too late, with only 12 days before his execution. Holder stares intently at the bulletin board of victims' photos. He believes the killer is on a crusade or mission, noting that the killer hunts girls who have lost their way. Linden adds that the killer is the \\"shepherd\\" and the victims are his \\"flock.\\" Reddick tells them that Angie snuck out of the hospital. Skinner orders everyone to find their main witness that night. Linden proposes they check Beacon Home. She and Holder wait in Pastor Mike's office. Holder looks at a bulletin board filled with photos of Beacon Home kids. \\"Shepherd of his flock,\\" he says. Pastor Mike (Ben Cotton) enters and apologizes for their wait. Linden and Holder exchange looks.  Production  In a June 2013 interview, actress Amy Seimetz (Danette Leeds) spoke about her emotional scenes in the series: \\"Those scenes were so terrifying to me! When you're dealing with a character like her who doesn't trust the police, you realize this is sort of her last resort, the one place she doesn't really want to go but she has to go there. So when they're not listening to her, it's just a snapping point. For me personally, it's the same relationship I have with going to the hospital for the first time for a family member or someone close. It's terrifying and awful, and you're in there and you want to desperately grab the doctor or nurses and be like, 'Tell me what is going on!'\\"  Reception  = Critical reception = Peter Sarsgaard was named the \\"Performer of the Week\\" by TVLine for his performance in this episode. = Ratings = \\"Eminent Domain\\" was watched by 1.37 million viewers, a considerable drop from the previous episode, and received a 0.4 rating in the 18-49 demographic.

Along with Anna Hutsol and Alexandra Shevchenko, she was one of the founders of the feminist activist group FEMEN, which publicly demonstrates in various countries against sexual exploitation, income inequality, and policies of the Roman Catholic Church, among other causes.  Biography  Oksana Chatchko was born in Khmelnytsky, a typical soviet town in the western part of Ukraine, in an Orthodox Christian family. Her parents both worked in a factory and when the Soviet Union collapsed the factories closed and they both lost their jobs, in a context of a political and economic crisis. In 1995, at the age of 8, Chatchko joined the Nikosh school, normally intended for adults and renowned for its teaching of Orthodox iconography. She graduated from this school and her early artwork was exhibited in several collective exhibitions in Ukraine and in the United States. At the age of twelve, she started painting frescoes, working in the Orthodox church full-time. She then expressed the desire to join a convent and become a nun, but her mother and her family convinced her not to do so. Later, at the age of 14, she rejected the Orthodox Church and religion and became an atheist, believing that the Orthodox priests behave more like merchants than God's representatives. She continued to paint though to earn a living. In 2000, she joined the free university of Khmelnytsky to study philosophy, which triggered a deep crisis of conscience. At this time, she started feeling upset about the lack of space devoted to women to express their ideas and their creativity. She founded with other students the \\"Center for New Perspectives\\", an organisation fighting against corruption and for student rights. At this point, she met Anna Hutsol and Aleksandra Shevchenko. She later indicated in the documentary film I am Femen that this experience forged her political and philosophical conceptions, making her become an activist fighting for women's rights and freedom of expression.  Activism  In 2008, together with Anna Hutsol and Alexandra Shevchenko, Shachko founded the feminist activist group FEMEN. The group initially protested about issues affecting women students, but rapidly moved on to demonstrating against the sexual exploitation of Ukrainian women and against sex tourism in 2008.Feminine Femen targets 'sexpats', Kyiv Post (22 May 2009)How they protest prostitution in Ukraine, France 24 (28 August 2009) Initially, FEMEN gained attention by demonstrating while dressed in underwear: however, in August 2009, Shachko bared her breasts at a protest in Kiev. Femen Les f√©ministes venues du froid , Paris Match (18 February 2012) Since then, FEMEN activists have regularly protested topless and broadened their agenda to women's rights and civil rights in Ukraine and around the world.FEMEN activist Supports the Egyptian Revolution protesting in nudity during a FEMEN protest in support of Aliaa Magda Elmahdy in March 2012 Members of FEMEN, including Shachko, were detained on numerous occasions. Probably the worst episode had happen in 2011, when a group of activists demanded release of political prisoners in the Belarusian capital Minsk. Shachko and two other women were kidnapped by the Belarusian KGB, taken to a forest, made to strip, doused with oil and threatened with being set on fire. Shachko worked together with French writer Galia Ackerman who produced a history of FEMEN which was published by Calmann-L√©vy in 2013. In 2014, the award-winning documentary film about Shachko, Je suis Femen (I am Femen) by filmmaker Alain Margot was released. France granted her political refugee status in 2013, after several attacks by security forces connected to Vladimir Putin, a target of FEMEN protests along with the French Front National. She lived in Paris working as a painter. Art At the time of her death, Shachko was concentrating on her artworks, called Iconoclast: Orthodox icons painted in the traditional method, onto which she introduced transgressives details to confront religious dogma with feminist, political or humanist messages. Shachko had her first solo exhibition in Paris in May 2016.  Death  Shachko was found dead in her apartment in Paris, France, on 23 July 2018. She was 31. Anna Hutsol told Ukrayinska Pravda that friends were awaiting an official report. It was reported that she hanged herself.Paris killed her.

New York: SUNY Press, 1989. Life Al-Khallal's exact date of birth is not known.

The Oxford International Encyclopedia of Legal History estimates al-Khallal's year of birth as 848. Aside from his legal efforts, virtually nothing is known of al-Khallal's life.

Issue 4 of Studies in Islamic Law and Society, V. 4. Leiden: Brill Publishers, 1997. According to Muslim historian Al-Dhahabi, there was no such thing as an independent Hanbalite school of law prior to al-Khallal's efforts at compiling Ibn Hanbal's views. Al-Khallal's status within the school was not universally accepted, and he and his students were often in conflict with fellow Hanbalite Al-Hasan ibn 'Ali al-Barbahari and his students.Christopher Melchert, Formation, pg. 150.

Work  Kraus has stated that he makes music for freaks, outsiders, losers and weirdos. Most of his music is released under a Creative Commons license with a non-commercial clause, consistent with his communist ideology. He is influenced by medieval music, renaissance music, traditional Japanese music, psychedelic music and electronic music. Kraus's work has been compared to Raymond Scott, Norman Mclaren, Moondog, Doctor Who, Sun Ra, Amps for Christ, Joe Meek, the Shaggs, John Frusciante, Pumice, Bruce Haack, Tangerine Dream, Flower Travellin' Band, Can, Kraftwerk, Goblin, Throbbing Gristle, Brian Eno, The Residents, Randy Holden, Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, Jean Michel Jarre, Peaking Lights, Emily Dickinson, Tod Dockstader, Marvin the Martian, Maureen Tucker, Men's Recovery Project, Captain Beefheart and Royal Trux.

Etymology The word comes from the Greek ŒΩŒµœçœÅŒøŒΩ (neuron, which refers to the nerve cell) and ŒµœçœÅŒπœÉŒ∫œâ (\\"euriskein\\" heuristic, which refers to a problem-solving procedure that is often characterized by its informal, intuitive and speculative features). Paradigm Neuroheuristics defines a scientific paradigm aimed to develop strategies that can be enabled to understand brain and mind following subsequent problems emerging from transdisciplinary studies including philosophy, psychology, neuroscience, pharmacology, physics, artificial intelligence, engineering, computer science, economics and mathematics. The neuroheuristic paradigm was presented for the first time at the conference Entrer dans le XXIe si√®cle : de l'apoptose √† la m√©tamorphose, held in 1994 at the Centro Stefano Franscini Monte Verit√†, under the auspice of the XV Videart Festival Locarno. The research framework introduced by the neuroheuristic paradigm appears as an essential step for the investigation of the information processing effected by the brain because it is the outcome of nature and nurture, at the crossing of top-down and bottom-up design. The neurobiologists apply a \\"bottom-up\\" research strategy in their studies. This strategy seems to prove necessary and sufficient to understand a brain in its entirety after the impressive achievements in studying the entire nervous system of a simple model organism, such as Caenorhabditis elegans. However it is not wholly viable to actual experimentation considering the impossibility of simultaneously examining all cellular elements of the brain and all variables that affect those elements. The \\"top-down\\" strategy with the assistance of black box theory appears easier to bring to fulfillment but insufficient and irrelevant in understanding the mechanisms coordinating the local networks of cellular elements. The neuroheuristic (or neuristic) paradigm offers as a needed and possible distinct approach to the study of brain and mind. In this framework, a \\"result\\" cannot be simply positive or negative because the process itself cannot be reduced to proficiency as such. Dynamics is an essential feature of the neuroheuristic paradigm, but it cannot be merely considered as the neurobiological facet of holism as opposed to reductionism.

Lee and Tsui created the film's script, and did so one day before shooting. The actors had no time to rehearse their lines.

In regards to Snowden's presence, the filmmakers stated that while Snowden is \\"a central character, he is not the most prominent.

According to Tse the Hong Kong hairstylist warned Cromeek to be careful about being mistaken for Snowden. Cromeek then lightened his haircolor by using gold spray paint, put on eyeglasses, trimmed his beard, and on the day of the shooting had moles placed on his neck with makeup.

Life She was born Harriet Murray, the daughter of actor Charles Murray and his second wife Ann Murray born at Norwich, Norfolk on 16April 1783. As a young child she appeared at Bath as Prince Arthur on 1July 1793. Her first London appearance was at Covent Garden Theatre as Perdita in The Winter's Tale, 12 May 1798. It was at Covent Garden in 1801 that she and Henry Siddons first appeared on stage together. They married the following year. The two remained at the theatre until the summer of 1805, when they joined the Drury Lane Theatre Company together. She left it with him in 1809. At Covent Garden she played a range of parts, such as Rosalind, Viola, Lady Townly, Lucy Ashton, Desdemona, Beatrice, Portia, Lady Teazle, and Miss Hardcastle. At Drury Lane on 24 September 1805 she was Juliet to Robert William Elliston's Romeo. After moving to Edinburgh in 1809 with Henry, to take over the Theatre Royal at the east end of Princes Streethttps://digital.nls.uk/playbills/history.html she helped her husband in his managerial work, and also appeared alongside him on stage.

Together they first lived at 3 Maitland StreetEdinburgh Post Office Directory 1810 then at 3 Forth Street.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1814 In 1814 the Drury Lane management made her a tempting offer to play leading female parts to Edmund Kean, but she declined. When Henry Siddons died in 1815 the affairs of the Edinburgh Theatre were in a bad state, but, with her brother William Henry Murray, she continued to steer clear of all difficulties, and eventually was able to retire at the end of her 21 years' lease of the theatre. The turning point in the fortunes of the house had been the production on 15 February 1819 of Rob Roy, in which Charles Mackay made a hit as the Bailie. When the same piece was played by royal command before George IV, on the occasion of his visit to Scotland, Siddons played, for that night only, the part of Diana Vernon. Due to English-Scottish tensions and post-Jacobite feelings, the promotion of Scots-based stories had to be placed in the past and labelled as fictions to disguise their anti- English stance and Sir Walter Scott wrote many pieces especially for the theatre. Scott was a close friend to Harriet.

Her final role on this night was as Mrs Towneley in the play \\"The Provoked Husband\\".

It is an external parasite of rabbits and hares and is occasionally found on cats and dogs and also certain seabirds that nest in burrows. It can act as a vector for the virus that causes the rabbit disease myxomatosis. Description Fleas may cluster round the base of a rabbit's ears The rabbit flea is about long and a dark brown colour. It is laterally compressed, has three pairs of legs and no wings. Its head is held at an angle to its body and its mouthparts are adapted for piercing the skin of its host and sucking its blood. It has a pronotal comb or row of spines just behind the head and a genal comb of spines below the head and these help to distinguish it from other species of flea. Host species The rabbit flea is found worldwide, usually as an external parasite found on rabbits and hares but occasionally also on cats and dogs. It can work its way through the animal's fur but is usually found in clusters around the bases of the host's ears. On some of the islands off the coasts of the United Kingdom it can be found on Manx shearwaters and Atlantic puffins, presumably because the birds nest in burrows and often take over holes previously occupied by rabbits. Life cycle Adult female rabbit fleas can detect the changing levels of certain hormones in a female rabbit's blood that show that she is near to parturition. This triggers sexual maturity in the fleas and they mate and start producing eggs. As soon as the young rabbits are born, the fleas move onto them and start feeding, mating and laying eggs. About twelve days later, they return to the mother rabbit. They complete this migration every time she produces a litter of young.Piper, Ross (2007), Extraordinary Animals: An Encyclopedia of Curious and Unusual Animals, Greenwood Press. The larvae are legless grubs, creamy- white with a brown head. After three larval stages they pupate. Fleas newly emerged from the pupa need to have a blood meal within a week, otherwise they will die. After that they can survive for many months without feeding. The optimum temperature for the flea's life cycle is 70 ¬∞F to 85 ¬∞F (21 ¬∞C to 30 ¬∞C). Disease transmission Myxomatosis is a virus disease of rabbits which can be fatal. The symptoms are swelling of the eyelids and lips, conjunctivitis and the formation of skin tumours on the face, ears and limbs. The rabbit flea acts as a vector for the disease and the virus has been shown to remain viable in the flea's mouthparts for at least one hundred days. The rabbit flea has also been implicated in the transmission of the Bartonella alsatica bacterium, an opportunistic pathogen that causes disease in animals and man.

Unlike other squares in Manila, the plaza is in the shape of a linear park occupying the central median of Moriones Street, starting at the intersection of Moriones and Juan Luna Streets, and ending at the intersection with Santa Maria Street, bisected by Nicolas Zamora Street in the center. It is named after Governor-General Domingo Moriones y Muralla, responsible for the construction of Manila's sewerage system during his tenure from 1877 to 1881. Originally an open green field lined with benches in colonial times, today the plaza is paved, with a size of and a capacity of 6,681 persons. Trees and benches line its entire length, and three fountains have been placed throughout the plaza. Flanked by paved roads, the central portion of the plaza resembles 19th century garden design with its plants such as bandera espa√±ola (canna) flowers and palm trees. At the end of the plaza stands the Sigaw ng Tondo, a monument sculpted in 1978 by Eduardo Castrillo in memory of local victims fleeing Japanese forces during the Battle of Manila in 1945. In 2010, another monument was erected at the plaza in memory of Honorio Lopez, a Tondo-born playwright who fought in the Philippine Revolution. Honorio Lopez monument in Plaza Moriones Owing to its location in Tondo, a working-class area of Manila, Plaza Moriones serves as a center for Philippine political discourse, second only to Plaza Miranda in Quiapo in terms of importance. On May 1, 1903, thousands of members of the Uni√≥n Obrera Democr√°tica Filipina, led by Isabelo de los Reyes, organized the Philippines' first Labor Day celebrations, with laborers such as tailors, mechanics, barbers and lithographers marching from the plaza to Malaca√±ang Palace. Several years later, the Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas (PKP) was established on November 7, 1930 at a public rally held at the plaza, attended by six thousand people. Currently, Plaza Moriones is designated as one of five freedom parks in the City of Manila, where protests and rallies may be held without requiring permission from local authorities. Beyond politics, Plaza Moriones is also significant for its location close to the Port of Manila: in 1906, the first nuns of the Order of Saint Benedict assigned to the Philippines arrived from Germany, landing at the plaza.

The so-called Aachen Compilation of 809-812, also called (by Ram√≠rez-Weaver in his 2008 dissertation) the Handbook of 809 is a Carolingian astronomical compendium, compiled by a group of astronomers who gathered at the court of Charlemagne at Aachen in the year 809. Charged with assessing the state of current knowledge about the heavens, they drew from classical sources such as the Historia naturalis by Pliny and the Greek tradition based on the Phaenomena by Aratus of Soli. But the aim of the Carolingian review of astronomy was to Christianize this \\"pagan\\" scientific tradition, using a strategy which attempted to keep as much material as possible of the ancient authors while taking care to alter some details which had given cause for concern in early medieval Christian doctrine. An influential contributor was Adalard of Corbie, Charlemagne's cousin. He brought with him the texts Excerptum de astrologia and De ordine ac positione stellarum in signis, which were incorporated into the Handbook. De ordine ac positione stellarum in signis is a catalogue of 42 constellations (out of the total of 48 listed by Ptolemy). Excerptum de astrologia is an abstract of the Aratus latinus, itself a translation of Aratus' Phaenomena. The Aratus latinus was a product of the 8th century, possibly further revised at Adalard's monastery of Corbie in the late 8th century (Revised Aratus). The earliest surviving manuscripts date to only a few years after the Aachen synod of 809-812\\\\. The oldest is kept in Paris, as Nouv. acq. lat. 1614, made in Tours in c. 825. Another early copy of the handbook survives in the Biblioteca Nacional de Espa√±a in Madrid, as Ms. 3307. This copy was made in Metz and dates to c. 840. Other Carolingian manuscripts survive in Vienna (Cod. Vindob. 387), Munich (Clm 210), Berlin (Ms Phill. 1832) and the Vatican (Vat. lat. 645, Reg. lat. 309).

Early life Benchamma was born in 1975 in France to Algerian parents. He completed his studies at the √âcole Sup√©rieure des Beaux Arts de Paris in 2003. Artistic Practice In 2011, Benchamma participated in the Future of a Promise exhibition for Arab artists which took place on Zaterre at the same time as the Venice Biennale. He was commissioned for the Told Untold Retold exhibition at the Mathaf Museum, Doha, Qatar. In July 2012 he had a solo exhibition of ultra-detailed pen drawings, Corrupted Theories, at the Gallery Isabelle van den Eynde, Dubai. Benchamma creates delicately executed drawings of states of matter, events and explosions animated by a wide range of dynamics. He is strongly influenced by theories of astrophysics and cosmology, as well as existentialist theatre and literary investigations. Benchamma explores natural and primordial forms of matter. In his series of ‚ÄòSculpture‚Äô drawings, the monolithic forms and piles develop organically on the page. Suggestions of organic and mineral forms emerge in the fluid patterns, recalling the strength of mountain landscapes or planes of greenery. For the series, Benchamma restricted himself to using only black marker pens, coloring in varying shades of black. While Benchamma‚Äôs central focus is drawing, he develops ideas into sculpture, furthering his conceptual questioning of reality. In ‚ÄòSculpture, More or Less‚Äô, a wooden parquet floor breaks with all the material properties of a sheet of glass, shattering in a way that the viewer only notices when standing up close to the work. The technical behavior of the natural materials, wood and glass, are manipulated and decontextualized to create a surreal and spectacular illusion. He has had solo exhibitions across Europe as well as in Asia, and has works in public collections, namely the FRAC Languedoc-Roussillon, the Musee de Beaux Arts- Orleans, and Artotheque de Pessac in France.

Charles Murray, 1797 engraving Life The son of Sir John Murray of Broughton, he was born at Cheshunt in Hertfordshire. He spent some time in France, studied pharmacy and surgery in London, and went surgeon's mate on some Mediterranean voyages. Stage career After playing as an amateur in Liverpool Murray went, with an introduction from Younger, the theatre manager there, to Tate Wilkinson of the York circuit. He made his first professional stage appearance at York, under the name of Raymur, and playing Carlos in Love makes a Man, or the Fop's Fortune (Colley Cibber). A quarrel in a tavern in Wakefield in September 1776 lost him his position. After further time at sea Murray acted under his own name with Griffiths at Norwich.He is believed to have produced a poor farce entitled The Experiment, 1779; but John Genest classed it among unacted plays. Murray is also credited in the Dramatic Mirror with the New Maid of the Oaks, said also to have been acted in Norwich, 1778 (in the Biographia Dramatica attributed to Ahab Salem, and said to have been acted near Saratoga). On 8 October 1785, as Sir Giles Overreach in A New Way to pay Old Debts, he made his first appearance in Bath.There he played Joseph Surface in The School for Scandal, and was the original Albert in Frederic Reynolds's Werter on 3 December 1785. Here or at Bristol he played in his first season Macbeth, Clifford in The Heiress, Evander in The Grecian Daughter by Arthur Murphy, Shylock, lago, Iachimo, Pierre, Lord Davenant, Mr. Oakly, several French characters, and other parts, appearing for his benefit as Gibbet in The Beaux Stratagem, with his wife as Cherry. Genest related that they did not sell a single ticket. Here he remained until 1796, playing a great variety of parts.They included King John, Osmyn in The Mourning Bride, Adam in As you like it, Sir Peter Teazle in The School for Scandal, Old Dornton in The Road to Ruin by Thomas Holcroft. His wife Mrs. Murray occasionally played with him, and on 1 July 1793, for the benefit of her father and of her mother, who played Queen Elinor, his young daughter Harriet Murray made her first stage appearance as Prince Arthur. She subsequently played Titania, and on Mrs. Murray's final benefit in Bath on 19 May 1796, Fine Lady in David Garrick's Lethe. On this occasion Murray spoke a farewell address. At Covent Garden Murray came to Covent Garden with a good reputation; his first appearance in London took place on 30 September as Shylock, with, it is said, Bagatelle in The Poor Soldier (John O'Keeffe and William Shield). He was found better suited for secondary parts.He played in his first season Alcanor in Mahomet (James Miller), the King in First Part of King Henry IV, King Henry in King Richard III, the King in Philaster by Beaumont and Fletcher, Heartley in The Guardian (David Garrick), Cassio, Lusignan, Strickland in The Suspicious Husband (Richard Cumberland, Dr. Caius, Manly in The Provoked Husband (John Vanbrugh and Cibber),' and many others. For his benefit, on 12 May 1798, he was Polixenes in The Winter's Tale, Harriet Murray making, as Perdita, her first appearance in London. He was on 11 October 1798 the original Baron Wildenhaim in Elizabeth Inchbald's Lovers' Vows.On 10 May 1799 he was, for his benefit, Friar Lawrence to the Juliet of his daughter, Mrs. Murray making, as the Nurse, her first appearance at Covent Garden. From this time Harriet Murray played ing√©nue parts, and on 13 September 1802 appeared as Mrs. H. Siddons. Murray's last appearance at Covent Garden appears to have been on 17 July 1817 as Brabantio to the Othello of Charles Mayne Young, the Iago of Junius Brutus Booth, and the Desdemona of Elizabeth O'Neill.During this season he had been on 3 May 1817 the original Alvarez in Richard Shiel's The Apostate, and took part in John Philip Kemble's retiring performances, ending 23 June with Coriolanus. Last years The Theatrical Inquisitor of February 1817 spoke of Murray as a veteran, and made reference to his infirmities. Threatened with paralysis, he went to Edinburgh to be near his children, Harriet Siddons (Mrs. Henry Siddons) and William Henry Murray, and died there on 8 November 1821.

His book on animals as spirit guides and symbols, Animal Speak, sold almost 500,000 copies from 1993 to 2009; the influential Llewellyn-published book is widely cited by others. Early life Andrews was born in Dayton, Ohio; he had six siblings all of whom were given names beginning with the letter 'T'. He spent most of his childhood at the east of Dayton in the city called Beavercreek. He claimed to experience clairvoyance, by seeing things that adults could not. He spent a lot of time walking through the woods with his grandfather, learning about nature. Andrews worked at Brukner Nature Center north of Dayton in Troy as a trail guide and animal keeper. Reprint. Andrews also read voraciously from the public library. A book of short stories sparked Andrews' interest in Jewish mysticism and in practical Kabbalah‚Äîthe fictional story featured a group of Jewish mystics who used the Kabbalah to create a golem of mud to fight the Nazis. In 1970, Andrews graduated from Carroll High School in Dayton, a private Catholic school. Career Andrews worked for 10 years with the Cincinnati Public Schools as a teacher and counselor, including 7 years helping children with special needs. When he and the other teachers at his junior high school were each required to form a club for the students, he started an \\"ESP Club\\". Andrews read about the occult, mysticism and metaphysics. In 1987 through Llewellyn Publications, he produced his first book, Simplified Magic: A Beginner‚Äôs Guide to the New Age Qabala, a guide to practical Kabbalah which was later reprinted as Simplified Qabala Magic. In 1991, he wrote How to See and Read the Aura, in which he says that \\"the aura is the energy field that surrounds all matter. Anything that has an atomic structure will have an aura...\\" Andrews wrote that the aura is a proven scientific phenomenon which can not only be viewed by humans but also manipulated using metaphysical practices such as the Jewish Kabbalah and the Indian pranayama. In September 1993, Andrews published what would be his most successful book: Animal Speak: The Spiritual & Magical Powers of Creatures Great and Small. This book claimed to help the reader recognize which animal was their personal totem or spirit guide. It has been cited by researchers studying human attitudes toward animals, including professor Marian Scholtmeijer of the University of Northern British Columbia, professor David Starr-Glass of Empire State College, and doctoral candidate Venetia Laura Delano Robertson. Robertson wrote that Andrews was a typical example of \\"white shamanism\\" in that he followed French sociologist √âmile Durkheim's assertion that totemism lets the practitioner \\"participate in the nature of the totem animal\\" to connect with the sacred core of human-as-animal. Andrews wrote, \\"when we learn to speak with the animals, to listen with animal ears and to see through animal eyes, we experience the phenomena, the power, and the potential of human essence.\\" Animal Speak sold almost 500,000 copies from 1992 to 2009. Death Andrews volunteered for some years at the Aullwood Audubon Center and Farm, working especially with raptors. Later, he lived with his wife, emergency room nurse Kathy Andrews, on a farm and animal rehabilitation center in Jackson, Tennessee. He died there of cancer on October 24, 2009.

Adults have fine black wavy lines on the hindwings.BugGuide The larvae have been recorded feeding on decaying seed pods of Lupinus species (L. albifrons and L. latifolius). They first feed from within a chamber of sparse silk formed in the cavity of a partially intact fruit. Later, they create purse-like cases. Pupation takes place within this case. The larvae have a salmon-orange body and a yellow-brown to red-brown head.Biology and description of the larva of Dicymolomia metalliferalis: A casebBearing Glaphyriine (Pyralidae) The species overwinters in the larval stage within the seedpod of host plant.

Supporters A number of high- profile European politicians, academics and public figures have endorsed the project and support it with their work. These are notably the former EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs Javier Solana, the Italian politician Giorgio La Malfa, the British academic Lord Anthony Giddens, the German politician and academic Gesine Schwan, as well as the Hungarian academic and politician P√©ter Bal√°zs, and Ji≈ô√≠ Pehe from the Czech Republic. Patrons, http://www.democraticunion.eu/about/patrons/ Statement of PrinciplesProject for Democratic Union, Statement of Principles, http://www.democraticunion.eu/about/statement-of-principles/  =Preamble= The dire state of the Eurozone and the growing sense of disenfranchisement across the continent threaten the peace of the continent. First, there are unmistakable signs of extremism within member states ‚Äì most recently exemplified by the rise of an openly neo-Nazi party in Greece. Secondly, because the weakness of Europe renders her unfit to deal with pressing external challenges, especially dealing with undemocratic states such as Iran, Russia, and a rising China. Thirdly, because the economic imbalance between Germany and the European periphery poisons political discourse so that what was intended to unite now increasingly divides us. The solution to these problems, Europe's 'democratic deficit', and her failure to address the current currency crisis can only be a 'federal' one and must be owned by the entire population of the Union democratically expressed. This is the only structure which will enable Europeans to mobilize in pursuit of their collective endeavors rather than against each other, and which will integrate Germany economically and militarily into the larger whole, without disenfranchising either the German people or any other population of the Union. =Principles= #The Project for Democratic Union aims at creating a new, more powerful and more democratic Europe. #It believes in the principles of liberal Democracy and the right of Europe's citizens collectively to determine their own future and that of their continent. #The Union Parliament should be the most important political institution in Europe. It should consist of two chambers: a House of Citizens elected by population, and a Senate made up of two delegates from each of the constituent states. #The government of the Union should be led by an executive President elected by direct popular vote. #Some competences ‚Äì such as foreign affairs, the armed services, and the common currency ‚Äìwhich are now vested in the European Commission, the European Council, the Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, the European Parliament, and member states will henceforth be the sole preserve of the Union government. Other powers will be returned to national and regional level, including the setting of the minimum wage. #The Union should have at its command a single European army, with the monopoly of external force projection. #The new Union would be a full member of NATO. It would take over the United Nations Security Council seat and nuclear weaponry of France. #Europe's banks, bond markets, and other financial and economic institutions and structures must be integrated and subject to singular, European law. Individual national debts are to be merged into one European national debt. #All citizens of the Union are to undertake military or some other form of community service for the Union a year after leaving school. #The PDU supports free trade with all genuine democracies. Any other trade relationship will depend on a standard of workers' rights set by the Union being met. #The new Union should promote sustainable growth and be committed to transparency in government and administration. #The Union's banks, bond markets and other financial and economic institutions and structures must be integrated and subject to unified Union law and supervision. #All existing state debt should be federalized in a once-off move through the issue of Union Bonds to be backed by the entire tax revenue of the common currency zone. This should be accompanied by the introduction of an automatic balanced budget requirement for all national and regional administrations with a subsequent ‚Äòno bail out clause‚Äô and an insolvency purge of all insolvent private sector financial institutions, in which deposits, but not loans, shares or bonds, are to be refunded by the Union. #It is essential to create a European public sphere as legitimator, commentator, and forum for discussion as well as a check on Union, national, and regional politics. #The official language of the Union will be English, which is to be exclusively used for Union business and will be the sole language of command in the Union army. The other languages of the Union should be maintained for national and regional administrative, commercial, and educational business, and for daily use in their respective habitats. #Our expectation is that all current and aspirant members of the Eurozone will wish to join the Democratic Union. In the event of Great Britain declining to join the new Union as a full member, the closest possible economic, political, and military links should be maintained with London in a new European Confederation.

It was introduced in Parliament by law minister Dr. B.R. Ambedkar. The Act was enacted by the provisional parliament under Article 327 of Indian Constitution, before the first general election. IIMUN An elected constituent assembly was set up on 9 December 1946 to frame the constitution. Most of the articles of the constitution came into force on 26 January 1950, commonly known as the Republic Day. Part XXI of the constitution contained the translational provisions. Articles 379 and 394 of Part XXI which contained provisions for provisional parliament and other articles which contained provisions like citizenship, came into force on 26 November 1949, the date on which the constitution was adopted. The provisional parliament enacted the Act vide Act No.43 of 1951 for the first general election conducted on 25 October 1951. The basic qualification to represent the people is Indian citizenship and not disqualified to vote under section 16 of the Representation of People Act, 1950 read with Part II and VII of this act. Amendments The act has been amended several times, but some of the notable amendments include * the Representation of the People (Amendment) Act, 1966 (47 of 1966), which abolished the election tribunals and transferred the election petitions to the high courts whose orders can be appealed to Supreme Court. However, election disputes regarding the election of President and Vice-President are directly heard by the Supreme Court. * the Representation of the People (Amendment and Validation) Act, 2013 (29 of 2013) The Representation of the People (Amendment) Bill, 2016 was introduced by Varun Gandhi in Lok Sabha. Latest amendment was in 2001. Application to Registration of political parties is governed by the provisions of section 29A of this Act. =President= Supreme Court shall inquire and decide regarding doubts and disputes arising out of or in connection with the election of a President per Article 71(1) of the constitution. Subject to Article 71 (3), Parliament made applicable rules/procedure to petition the Supreme Court for resolving the disputes only that arise during the election process of the president but not the doubts that arise from his unconstitutional actions/deeds or changing Indian citizenship during the tenure of president which may violate the requisite election qualifications. Subject to the provisions of Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971, Supreme Court can remove the president for ceasing to possess the eligible qualifications to be Lok Sabha member under Sections 7 & 8(k) of this Act when the acts/ deeds (i.e. for giving assent to unconstitutional bills passed by the parliament or state legislatives, permitting the gazette notification of the unconstitutional advises {including promulgation of ordinances under Article 123 or imposing president rules in a state under Article 356} rendered by the union cabinet / prime minister, etc.) of the president are proclaimed by the courts as unconstitutional, mala fide, ultra vires, void, etc. Also it is the duty of the Supreme Court to clarify any doubt in connection with the election of president such as speedy trail of the pending cases against an elected president before the elevation to president. The scope of the trail would be limited only to decide whether the incumbent president is eligible to continue in his post but not to prosecute the president under criminal charges with arrest and imprisonment or to claim relief in a civil case to comply with the provisions per Article 361 of the constitution. =Vice president= Similar to the president per article 71 upon ceasing to possess the requisite qualifications to be a member of Rajya Sabha subject to this Act. All pending criminal / corruption cases are to be disposed on priority by the Supreme court to decide whether he is qualified to continue as vice president =Prime minister= Upon ceasing to possess the requisite qualifications to be a member of Parliament subject to this Act. =Speaker= Speaker of the Lok Sabha is also removed on getting disqualified for being Lok Sabha member under sections 7 & 8 of this Act. This would arise out of speaker's wrong certification of a bill as money bill inconsistent with the definition given in Articles 110 of the constitution. When courts upheld the unconstitutional act of the speaker for wrong certification of a bill as money bill, it amounts to disrespecting the constitution deserving conviction under Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971 which is applicable for disqualification of speaker's Lok Sabha membership under sections 7 & 8k of this Act. Supreme court rulings and RPA The Constitution of India - which empowers the Parliament of India to make laws regarding disqualification of MP and MLA- also mentions that on disqualification of an MP or an MLA, the seat becomes vacant immediately. Interpreting the words of constitution the bench found the clause 8(4) of the RPA act -which gives a time period of 3 months to file an appeal and allows continuation in office till its disposal- as unconstitutional. The Cabinet of Ministers, in order to nullify the judgement, passed an ordinance for the amendment of the act, however the said Ordinance wasn't signed by the President and it was taken back. A recent verdict on 19 November 2013 ensured the stay on the election campaigning of the convicted legislators for the current session. =Office of profit= Being public servants, elected representatives, MLAs or MPs, cannot hold an office of profit under section 9 (A) of the Representation of People's Act and Articles 102 and 191(E) of the Constitution. In the year 2006, Sonia Gandhi resigned her membership of Lok Sabha for enjoying office of profit while being an MP. In 2006, Sonia Gandhi's ruling party in Parliament also amended the Parliament (Prevention of disqualification) Act, 1959 with retrospective effect from 4 April 1959 to prevent her punishable under the representation of the people Act, 1951 and Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971. Some notable cases and instances * Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had announced that the government had issued notifications for registration of overseas Indian electors under the Representation of People Act, 1950 to enable Indians resident abroad to participate in elections. * Former state cabinet minister, Jagir Kaur, was booked under Section 123 of the act for bribing voters after the police seized 183 cases of liquor from the vehicles. * The Allahabad high court invalidated found Indira Gandhi, who was the then Prime Minister, guilty on the charge of misuse of government machinery for her election campaign. The court declared her election null and void and unseated her from her seat in the Lok Sabha representing Rae Bareilly constituency. The court also banned her from contesting any election for an additional six years. This resulted in declaration of emergency and amendments were made in the constitution to validate the election. * Umlesh Yadav is the first politician to be disqualified by the Election Commission of India for a period of three years for suppression of her election expenses incurred when she was elected as an MLA to the Bisauli constituency in the 2007 Uttar Pradesh state assembly elections. * Two Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly members, Bajrang Bahadur Singh and Uma Shankar Singh, were disqualified in January 2015 due to holding government contracts. * As part of the disproportionate assets case against Jayalalithaa, she became in 2014 the first Chief Minister to be disqualified from office. *Madhya Pradesh Cabinet Minister Mr Narottam Mishra disqualified for three years by Election commission of India for providing wrong information to EC on expenses incurred during the polls under section 10A of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, to be read with Sections 77 and 78 of the Act.http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/ec-disqualifies- minister-in-mp/article19143645.ece Provisions The Act allows cash donations of any amount but it states in section 29C that any contributions above to political parties are to be reported.

The treaty was rejected by the US Senate and never went into effect. The Venezuelan crisis of 1895 was peacefully resolved through arbitration. Both nations realized that a mechanism was desirable to avoid possible future conflicts. In January 1897, US Secretary of State Richard Olney negotiated an arbitration treaty with the British diplomat Julian Pauncefote. US President William McKinley supported the treaty, as did most opinion leaders, academics, and leading newspapers. In Britain, it was promoted by pacifist Liberal MP Randal Cremer; the main opposition came from Irish-Americans, who held a very negative view of Britain because of its treatment of Ireland. The US Senate, however, passed a series of amendments that exempted important issues from any sort of arbitration. Any issue that was not exempted would need a two-thirds vote of the Senate before arbitration could begin. Virtually nothing was left of the original proposal, and in May 1897, the Senate voted 43 in favor to 26 opposed, three votes short of the two-thirds majority needed. The Senate was jealous of its control over treaties and was susceptible to a certain deep- rooted Anglophobia.

The species was first described by Johan Christian Fabricius in 1775. The larva has a most catholic taste in food plants, and readily added the needles of introduced pines to its diet, causing widespread defoliation in South African plantations in the 1930s, especially in the Lebanon and Franschhoek plantations of the Western Cape. The pines included Pinus canariensis, P. halepensis, P. radiata, P. longifolia, P. muricata and P. pinaster. Other exotic species included Acacia mollissima, Cupressus macrocarpa, Eucalyptus cladocalyx, E. diversicolor, E. globulus, E. ovata, E. paniculata, E. pilularis, Liriodendron tulipifera, apple, guava and quince. Its food plants before the introduction of exotic species had included Euclea species, Rapanea melanophloeos, Protea repens, Rhus angustifolia, Watsonia species and Myrica cordifolia - Pinus radiata and Rhus angustifolia being most sought after, with feeding migrations to other species being only incidental. Eggs and caterpillars are sought out by a variety of hymenopteran parasitoids such as Hockeria crassa, Hockeria nudaureliae, Pediobius species, Anastatus species and Mesocomys pulchriceps,\\"The Parasitoids of Southern African Wild Silkmoths\\" while the larvae are infected naturally by at least five distinct virus species, including Nudaurelia Œ≤ virus, producing fairly regular epizootics.\\"Small RNA Viruses Co-infecting the Pine Emperor Moth\\" - Hendry et al (1984) Insect viruses have long been valued as biological control agents, since they have few negative effects on ecosystems compared with chemical pesticides. Their most important quality is that they require no follow-up or management, while their host specificity is a great advantage over most chemical pesticides which are not. Other mammalian controlling factors are baboons, feral pigs and porcupines, all of which relish the larvae, pupae and moths. Pigs were introduced to Western Cape pine plantations by the Forestry Department in the 1930s, and proved to be a cheap and effective control measure, their acute sense of smell enabling them to easily detect pupae under the soil surface. Life history stages Eggs are 2 mm long and near- ellipsoidal in shape, with the shell smooth and unsculpted. Eggs are usually laid in clusters of 3-200 in the foliage of the upper crown, while a small number are laid on the trunk near the ground. After hatching the shells are consumed over a period of two to three days by the young larvae, a process that triggers their plant-feeding response and so plays an important role in their development. Incubation of the eggs laid in mid-summer takes about 18 or 19 days, and 21 to 28 days for those laid in winter. Larvae go through six moults and are highly gregarious till the end of the second moult. After the second moult the larvae acquire their gaudy colouring of bands of blue, green and yellow spots on a deep maroon ground colour. Full development takes from 6 to 8 weeks, and when mature the caterpillar is between 100 and 125 mm long. The mature larvae or caterpillars crawl to the ground and search for a patch of soft soil, burrowing to a depth of about 50 mm. After several days the skin splits along the dorsal line. Pupae are dark red at first, but after a few days becomes dull black and hard. The pupal stage lasts from 5 to 6 months. When the moth is about to emerge the pupa works its way to the soil surface, the pupal case splits and the moth emerges. The moth climbs a small distance up a tree or shrub and then allows the wings to expand and harden, a process taking some 30 minutes. Adult moths survive for only a few days, long enough to mate and for the female to lay about 200 eggs on a suitable food plant. Adult moths show considerable variation in size, but on average have a 125-150 mm wingspan, the body being about 50 mm long and densely covered in silky hair. Colouration and markings differ only slightly between the sexes. Antennae of the male are broadly comb-like (pectinate), while those of the female are almost linear and only slightly serrate.\\"The Pine Tree Emperor Moth\\" - Tooke & Hubbard (1941) (Department of Agriculture and Forestry, South Africa - Entomology Series No. 7) External links *\\"A New Group of RNA Viruses from Insects\\" - Reinganum, Robertson and Tinsley (1978) References Category:Saturniidae Category:Moths described in 1780 ","title":"Nudaurelia cytherea"},{"id":"39828938","text":"thumb William Tayler (1808‚Äì1892) was a civil servant of the East India Company who lived in India from 1829 until 1867.

His measures against the local people were regarded as excessively harsh by his superiors, and he was suspended and given an appointment of lower rank. Work An amateur artist, Tayler sketched and painted landscapes, scenes from everyday life, and the court, military, and daily dress of Indians from different walks of life. Sketches Illustrating the Manners and Customs of the Indians and Anglo Indians Drawn on Stone from the Original Drawings from Life, published in London in 1842, included six of his drawings. In 1881 and 1882, Tayler published a two-volume autobiography, Thirty-Eight Years in India, illustrated with 100 of his own drawings. In a watercolor he portrayed the rajah of Burdwan, in West Bengal. This was probably Mahtab Chand, who was born in 1820 and was rajah from 1832 until his death in 1879. He was regarded by the British as an enlightened and loyal ruler. The painting is part of the Anne S.K. Brown Military Collection at the Brown University Library.

Emmott was named one of London's most influential scientists, and one of the most influential people in London by the Evening Standard in 2012. Education Emmott studied at the University of York, where he completed a B.Sc. in Biological Sciences (experimental psychology), graduating in 1987 with First Class honours. He obtained a PhD in computational neuroscience from the Centre for Cognitive and Computational Neuroscience, University of Stirling in 1993, supervised by Professor Roger Watt. Having been deeply influenced and inspired by the work of David Marr and David Rumelhart, Emmott's doctoral research focused on modelling and understanding the computations the brain performs to produce vision. He chose the visual processing of text because it is the canonical example of a physical structure designed around how the brain works, rather than the other way round. Career After obtaining his PhD., Emmott took up a post-doctoral scientist position at AT&T; Bell Labs in Holmdel, N.J, US, between 1993 and 1996. He worked in Nobel Laureate Arno Penzias's division, undertaking research into biological-inspired computing, applied to some of the earliest medical, financial and e-commerce applications of the Internet. Emmott returned to London in January 1997 to lead the advanced research laboratory of NCR Corp (which then owned teradata). His work and the work of his Laboratory became recognised for numerous innovations at the intersection of science, technology and finance. This included the invention of Agent-based Internet auctions, the digital wallet and a biologically-inspired, probabilistic method to predict the behaviour of financial markets. Microsoft In 2003, Emmott joined Microsoft as chief scientist, and head of computational science. Emmott's vision was ‚Äòto pioneer new computational methods, tools and technologies to enable new kinds of science and accelerate radical solutions to the unprecedented challenges and opportunities of our time.‚Äô Emmott's scientific leadership created numerous scientific and technological advances. These include the new science of biological computation and ‚ÄòLiving Software‚Äô; programmable Artificial Photosynthesis as a potentially breakthrough cheap, global energy technology; the world's first predictive mechanistic model of all life on Earth (General Ecosystem Model); the first mechanistic model of the Global Carbon Cycle; and the development of a computational platform enabling hyper-parallelisation of the Scientific Method (e.g.,). Scientific In 2019, Emmott created Scientific, a new science and technology company dedicated to creating transformational science-based innovation that generates a step-change in returns for investors, and genuinely radical global impact outcomes. Public service From 2005 to 2010, Emmott was scientific advisor to the Chancellor of The Exchequer. He was a member of the UK Government's 10 Year Science & Innovation Framework Committee, 2004. He was appointed by the UK government Minister for Science as a trustee of the UK's National Endowment for Science, Technology & the Arts, 2008‚Äì2012. He was an adviser to the Finnish Prime Minister's Science & Innovation Strategy, 2008. Emmott is Professor of Biological Computation, University College London, and was Professor of Computational Science (visiting), University of Oxford, 2007‚Äì2014.  Ten Billion  Emmott is author of 10 Billion. It is about the climate, ecological, agricultural, resource, pollution, energy, migration and geo-political impact of a human population of 10 Billion. Royal Court 10 Billion began as ‚Äòa new kind of scientific lecture‚Äô, delivered by Emmott, over twenty nights at London's Royal Court Theatre, directed by Katie Mitchell. It won widespread critical acclaim. Sarah Hemming of the Financial Times described it as ‚Äòimmensely, distressingly powerful‚Äô and ‚Äòone of the most disturbing evenings I‚Äôve ever spent in a Theatre‚Äô. The Guardian's Michael Billington stated that ‚Äúwhat is impressive is that Professor Emmott argues his case with an implacable logic. He is quiet, humane and deeply concerned and when he says, at the end, \\"I think we're fucked\\" you have to believe him.‚Äù Ten Billion was named as ‚ÄòTheatrical Performance of the Year‚Äô in 2012 by The Guardian. Book 10 Billion was published as a book in 2013. It became an international best-seller. 10 Billion was described by Emmott as ‚ÄòA manifesto for our times. A manifesto against complacency.‚Äô In it, Emmott introduced the term ‚Äòunprecedented planetary emergency‚Äô ‚Äì a term that at the time of its publication was described as ‚Äòexaggeration‚Äô and ‚Äòscare-mongering‚Äô. It is a term which has now become widely used by scientists, politicians and activists, popularised by Greta Thunberg. The Guardian's John Gray concluded that, ‚ÄúThe shift in thinking that will be needed if we are to prepare ourselves for living in a different world begins with reading Emmott's indispensable book.‚Äù Clive Cookson of the Financial Times said the book was ‚Äúa stark, simple and short warning about the coming catastrophe, which [Emmott] feels is inevitable, resulting from human population [growing from 7bn to 10 Billion] and over-exploitation of the world‚Äôs resources.‚Äù In a review of 10 Billion in Nature, Hania Zlotnik noted: ‚ÄúHis slim, even terse book [presenting] his view on the ‚Äúunprecedented planetary emergency we've created‚Äù ‚Äî primarily examines the transformation of the global environment by human activity, a transformation that includes climate change, increasing water shortages and growing urbanization. Emmott's assessment of the capacity of people and technology to prevent the global crises that confront us is grim.‚Äù On the Guardian‚Äôs environment network, Chris Goodall called it \\"error-strewn, full of careless exaggeration and weak on basic science.‚Äù Despite such criticism, the scientific evidence continues to overwhelmingly support the science Emmott set out in 10 Billion. Film 10 Billion was made into a feature- length documentary film, produced by Oxford Film & Television directed by Peter Webber. It was supported financially by Ingenious Media, Prince Albert II of Monaco Foundation, Sky Atlantic, HanWay Films and the Roland Mouret Foundation. It was premiered at London's Curzon cinema in December 2015, and screened at cinemas worldwide. Subsequently, it premiered on Sky Atlantic in 2016.

Kamiakin directed that a ditch be excavated to nourish a plot near Ahtanum Creek, hoping to provide a sedentary existence for his people that would keep them out of conflict with the settlers. Crops included squash, corn and potatoes, fed by what became known to settlers as Kamiakin's Ditch. In 1851 a Catholic mission was established near the creek.

In addition to Sunni foreign fighters, Shia fighters from several countries have joined pro-government militias in Syria, leftists have joined Kurdish fighting forces, and private military contractors recruit globally. Estimates of the total number of foreign Sunnis who have fought for the Syrian rebels over the course of the conflict range from 5,000 to over 10,000, while foreign Shia fighters numbered around 10,000 or less in 2013 rising to between 15,000 and 25,000 in 2017. The presence of foreign jihadists, particularly in anti-government groups, steadily grew throughout the Syrian Civil War. In the early insurgency phase mid-2011 to mid-2012, their presence was negligible. In the mid-2012 to late 2013 escalation phase, their numbers grew, but they were still far outnumbered by Syrian resistance fighters (only around twelve hundred foreign anti-government jihadists were killed in Syria in 2013). Throughout 2014, with the rise of the Islamic State, the Al-Nusra Front, and other groups, their numbers drastically increased and they partnered with and absorbed Syrian rebel groups, both jihadist and non- jihadist. By 2015, foreign jihadists outnumbered Syrian jihadists and other rebels in casualty rolls (16,212 anti-government foreign jihadists were killed in 2015 compared to 7,798 Syrian anti-government rebels killed that same year), a trend that carried over into 2016 (13,297 foreign jihadists and 8,170 Syrian rebels), and 2017 (7,494 foreign jihadists and 6,452 Syrian rebels). However, although the numbers of casualties remained high in this phase, arrivals slowed: according to the United States military, foreign fighters coming to Syria and Iraq in 2013-2015 averaged 2,000 fighters per month, but by 2016, this figure had dropped to less than 500 fighters per month and decreasing.Stewart, Phil. U.S. military softens claims on drop in Islamic State's foreign fighters. Reuters. April 28, 2016. Quote: \\"U.S. Army Colonel Steve Warren, a Baghdad-based spokesman for the coalition, told Reuters that the official estimate is higher than the one Gersten offered, although he did not provide a precise figure. ‚ÄúWe believe the foreign fighter flow was 2,000 at one point and is now down to a quarter or less of that,‚Äù Warren said.\\" By 2018, the proportion of foreign fighters had far decreased (following heavy losses in the bloody battles of 2015-2017 and various interventions by foreign military forces), and Syrian rebels were once again the majority of anti- government casualties (2,746 foreign jihadists killed compared to 5,852 Syrian rebels).2018 under different titles‚Ä¶the death of about 23,000 persons, the displacement of hundreds of thousands others, shifts in the influence of the conflicting powers, and regional and international agreements of de-escalation and withdrawal. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, at least 65,726 anti-government foreign fighters (almost entirely jihadists) were killed in Syria up to May 2020, constituting nearly half of the 138,202 anti- government fighters killed by that point. Additionally, 10,045 foreign fighters on the side of the Syrian government were killed by then (1,700 Lebanese Hezbollah and 8,345 others, including 2,000+ militiamen of Liwa Fatemiyoun) and 264 Russian soldiers and mercenaries.https://www.syriahr.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/14-y-en.pdf Reasons =Jihadism= Many of the foreign fighters in Syria and Iraq are drawn to the jihadist ideology, although experts note that religion is not the only motivation: > From ignorant novices who view the trips as a rite of passage, die-hard > militants looking for combat and martyrdom, and individuals who go for > humanitarian reasons but get drawn into conflict, individuals become foreign > fighters for a range of reasons: boredom; intergenerational tensions; the > search for greater meaning in life; perceived adventure; attempts to impress > the local community or the opposite sex; a desire for increased credibility; > to belong or gain peer acceptance; revenge; or misguided conflict experience > expectations. Foreign fighters are drawn both to Daesh and other Islamist fighting groups, such as al-Nusra Front, Liwa al-Muhajireen wal-Ansar (which is made up of Chechen fighters), and (prior to 2013) Ahrar al-Sham. Jaysh al-Islam rebel leader Zahran Alloush called for foreign fighters to come to Syria, although experts report that the group does not include foreign fighters. \\"Somewhat distinct from other rebel organizations in Syria, Alloush‚Äôs Army of Islam is purely Syrian in composition. There are no foreign fighters in its ranks, no veterans of mujahidin campaigns in Iraq or Afghanistan.\\" On 31 May 2013, Yusuf al-Qaradawi called for a jihad against Syria. It was speculated in the Western media that this could lead to an influx of foreign fighters to the country, although no reports emerged that this transpired. =Shia activism= Thousands of foreign fighters are in Syria from Iraq, Lebanon, Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bahrain with Shia sectarian militias fighting in defence of the Assad government. =Left-wing support for Rojava= Hundreds of foreign leftists have joined the International Freedom Battalion of the People's Protection Units (YPG) in Rojava, out of a mixture of opposition to the Islamic State and willingness to defend the Rojava Revolution. Foreign volunteers are supposed to follow the YPG's values of democracy, ecology, Jineology, and some of them anti-capitalism. =Left-wing support for Syrian rebels= Although they are less numerous than leftist foreign fighters joining the YPG, there have also been left-wing foreign fighters alongside Syrian rebels, including the Trotskyist Leon Sedov Brigade founded by an Argentine leftist who fought with the Free Libyan Army. =Right-wing support for Assad= The European and North American far right is generally supportive of the Assad government in Syria, and far right foreign fighters, e.g. from Greece and Scandinavia, are found in pro-government militias. =Mercenaries and private contractors= In addition to volunteer foreign fighters, there are several private military companies operating in Iraq and Syria, such as the Wagner Group and the Slavonic Corps. Passage Most fighters travel to Turkey first before slipping across the border with somewhat lesser contingents coming from Lebanon and even fewer from Jordan and Iraq; many of the fighters also use forged passports as they try and escape secret services. Upon entering the country, many of the Islamist fighters were dispersed to the various groups such as Ahrar ash-Sham and the Nusra Front. Languages reportedly spoken in rebel camps include: Chechen, Tajik, Turkish, French, the Saudi Arabic dialect and Urdu (Pakistan or India). In regards to the Free Syrian Army, The Guardian reported the recruits to be more secretive. Jihadist internet fora have also been fertile recruiting grounds. The easy access to the country was a reason for the growing number of foreign fighters. Al-Sharq al-Awsat reported that Libyan fighting leader Abu-Yahya indicated an easy travel route for Tunisian and Libyan fighters, who are first trained in Libya to fight in Syria and then smuggled into Syria with the help of militant groups. Even in July 2013, it was reported that foreign fighters continued to come to Syria and commit atrocities against both supporters and opponents of the government, as well as clashing with moderate rebel groups. This followed President Bashar al-Assad signing into law a bill that would punish anyone entering the country illegally with jail time and a fine. The fine would be between five million and 10 million Syrian pounds. Islamic State According to figures collected by the Soufan Group in 2016, between 27,000 to 31,000 people including women and children who would not normally engage in conflict had traveled to Syria and Iraq to join the Islamic State and other extremist groups fighting in the region. One reason suggested for the influx of foreigners in the fight is that the Syrian government took no steps to curtail the inflow of foreigners moving into Iraq during the Iraqi insurgency. In the first half of 2012, 700-1,400 fighters were said to have entered Syria. Their numbers continued to increase, however, and by 2013 may have numbered more than 11,000. The Turkish border was how most jihadis entered Syria. An analysis of martyrdom videos indicated that of the 600 reported dead in the first half of 2013, less than 20 of the dead fighters were experienced fighters from Afghanistan, Libya, or elsewhere. An October 2016 World Bank study found that \\"ISIL‚Äôs foreign fighters are surprisingly well-educated.\\" Using the fighters' self-reported educational levels, the study concluded that \\"69% of recruits reported at least a secondary-level education\\" of which \\"a large fraction have gone on to study at university\\" and also that \\"only 15% of recruits left school before high school; less than 2% are illiterate.\\" The study also found that foreign fighters are often more educated than their countrymen where those \\"from Europe and in Central Asia have similar levels of education to their countrymen\\" while those \\"from the Middle East, North Africa, and South and East Asia are significantly more educated than what is typical in their home nations.\\" The report notes that its conclusions that terrorism is not driven by poverty and low levels of education does not conform with previous research. However, the report did find a strong correlation \\"between a country‚Äôs male unemployment rate and the propensity of the country to supply foreign fighters\\" leading the report to recommend that governments pursue a policy of lowering the unemployment rate among the educated as a counter-terrorism strategy. In December 2018, Kurdish authorities held 550 foreign women about 1200 in captivity. A large part of the children were born in Syrian territory controlled by ISIS. Many of the women still shared ISIS ideology and lacked passports and therefore Kurdish authorities were reluctant to release them. While initially the women and children were kept along civilian Syrian refugees, this proved untenable as hard-liners among the women caused problems when they ganged up and assaulted women who took off the Islamic burqa. They also prevented other women and children from listening to music provided by their captors. In October 2019, hundreds of inmates with suspected links to the ISIS reportedly fled a displacement camp based in north-east Syria, following the Turkish offensive in the region. This raised concerns of resurgence of the Islamic State amid conflict. Origins of foreign fighters Fighters include those from the Gulf Arab states, Tunisia (following its own Tunisian revolution), Libya (following the Libyan Civil War), China, other Arab states, Russia, including the North Caucasus region, and Western countries.Mark Youngman and Cerwyn Moore (2017) ‚ÄòRussian-Speaking‚Äô Fighters in Syria, Iraq and at Home: Consequences and Context' According to the Syrian Arab Army, by September 2014 a total of 54,000 foreign jihadists had come to fight, with the largest groups being Chechens from Russia (14,000), Saudi Arabians (12,000), Lebanese (9,000), Iraqis, and Tunisians.Mohanad Hashim. \\"Iraq and Syria: Who are the foreign fighters?\\". BBC. September 3, 2014. Foreign fighters tend to join different groups depending on nationality: for example, Tunisians and Western-born Muslims favor the Islamic State, while Algerians and Moroccans prefer the al- Nusra Front. Some jihadist groups are dominated by a single nationality, as is the case with the Caucasus Emirate (Chechens) and the Turkistan Islamic Party (Uyghurs), or the pro-government Afghan Shia Liwa Fatemiyoun. A 7 December 2015 report by the Soufan Group gave estimates for the number of foreign fighters in Syria and Iraq by their country and region of origin based on information dated between 2014 and 2015. The study, which only included foreign fighters with ISIL, al-Nusra and other Sunni jihadist factions, listed the countries with the largest number of foreign fighters were Tunisia (6000), Saudi Arabia (2500), Russia (2400), Turkey (2100), Jordan (2000+) while the number of fighters by region was reported to be: the Middle East (8240), the Maghreb (8000), Western Europe (5000), former Soviet Republics (4700), Southeast Asia (900), the Balkans (875), and North America (289). Of Western Europe's estimated 5000 total fighters, almost 3700 fighters were produced by just four Western European countries: France (1700), Germany (760), the United Kingdom (760), and Belgium (470). Between 2014 and 2015, the report estimated a nearly 300% increase in the number of fighters originating from Russia and Central Asia whereas the total number of fighters traveling to Syria and Iraq had become \\"relatively flat.\\" The report mentioned that the flow of foreign fighters \\"is neither uniform by region nor by country,\\" with some countries having distinguishable \\"Hotbeds of recruitment\\" with some hotbeds, such as the Lisleby district of Norway's Fredrikstad which is populated by only 6000 people, being small and relatively new while other cities and regions, such as Tunisia's Bizerte and Ben Gardane, Libya's Derna, Georgia's Pankisi Gorge, and Brussel's Molenbeek, \\"are well-established incubators and radiators of extremist behavior.\\" The Soufan Group reported on 15 October 2016 that there has been \\"a significant increase in the number of foreign fighters travelling to Syria\\" since 2014. The U.S. State Department reported on 2 June 2016 that their \\"intelligence community\\" estimates that possibly \\"in excess of 40,000 total foreign fighters have gone to the conflict [in Syria] and from over 100 countries\\" while six months prior, the Russian Defense Ministry estimated that there were about \\"25-30,000 foreign terrorist mercenaries are fighting for ISIL\\" alone. The phenomenon causes concerns in the home countries of the foreign fighters. The phenomenon is not new, but the size and variety of origins in this case were unusual. Arab world In 2012, it was reported that most recruits to Syria are Arabs (Lebanese, Iraqis, Jordanians, Palestinians, Kuwaitis, Tunisians, Libyans, Algerians, Egyptians, Saudis, Sudanese and Yemenis). The largest contingents of about 500-900 fighters came from Syria's neighbors: Lebanese, Iraqis, Palestinians and Jordanians, many of whom fought U.S. forces in Iraq. The second-largest contingent was from Arab countries in North Africa: around 75-300 fighters from Libya, Tunisia, and Algeria. Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri called for a jihad in Syria with the main target of message said to be Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey and Iraq. In 2013, the total number of foreign fighters in Syria with al-Qaeda was estimated to be the largest for Libyans with several hundred fighters; Saudis numbered at least 330; several hundred Egyptian Islamists; about 300 Iraqis and over 500 Jordanians. = Gulf states= In 2013, Bahraini Sunni sheikh Adel al-Hamad said that his son, Abdulrahman, was killed while fighting in Syria and that he had \\"hoped to fall as a martyr.\\" He added: \\"He visited Syria once, then he returned to Bahrain where he prepared his fighting gear and returned to Syria.\\" In response, Interior Minister Rashid bin Abdullah al- Khalifa said that support should be given from the international community and that individuals should not be indoctrinated and radicalised. It follows calls from mosques to join the \\"jihad\\" in Syria. There are also Saudi fighters. In 2013, USA Today reported that over 1,200 death row inmates were sent from Saudi Arabia to fight against the Syrian government. Bahraini Shia youth traveled to receive Iranian training in camps and battlefronts in Iran, Lebanon, Iraq, and Syria, and there have been reports that a Bahraini Shia militia, Saraya Al Mukhtar (The Chosen Brigades), was fighting in Syria on the pro-government side in 2015. =Lebanon= Mostly Lebanese fighters in Syria tend to have their own groups and militias. Thousands of Lebanese fight on the pro-government side. The most significant Lebanese force in Syria is Hezbollah, which in September 2017 said it had 10,000 fighters in Syria. In 2017, it was reported that Hezbollah had lost between 1,700 and 1,800 fighters in the Syrian war. In 2018, it was reported that at least 1,232 Lebanese Shia militia fighters had been killed. On the anti-government side, members of Fatah al-Islam and the Abdullah Azzam Brigades were also present though they were fighting under independent banners. Many Lebanese fighters for the opposition come from the Sunni stronghold of Tripoli. The city's Sunni cleric Sheik Masen al-Mohammed said: \\"The struggle for freedom in Syria is our own struggle for freedom. We Lebanese are part of the Syrian revolution, part of the rebellion. If Syria gains its freedom, then we will also win in Lebanon.\\" He also said of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad that he was an \\"infidel...It is the duty of every Muslim, every Arab to fight the infidels. There is a holy war in Syria and the young men there are conducting jihad. For blood, for honor, for freedom, for dignity. We know of Palestinian, Libyan and Yemen fighters who are active there.\\" =Libya= Libya's National Transitional Council was the first and only UN recognised entity to see the Syrian National Council as the sole legitimate representative of the Syrian people. In December 2011, it was reported in the French media that the former Libyan Islamic Fighting Group's Abdulhakim Belhadj's associate Abd al-Mehdi al-Harati was leading a Libyan group of fighters with rumours suggesting some of the Nusra Front's fighters came from this group. Arms from the recently concluded Libyan Civil War were also present in Syria. While many fighters from the civil war were reported to have gone to fight in Syria, several were said to have returned home amidst escalating violence and threats of a new civil war. Towards the end of 2014, the city of Derna reportedly swore allegiance to ISIS, the first outside Syria or Iraq. = Morocco = In 2017 it was estimated that Moroccans and 2000 Moroccan-Europeans had travelled to join the Islamic State caliphate in the Syrian Civil War, which along with other fighters from MENA countries contributed a significant force to ISIS. =Tunisia= Following the first Arab Spring uprising that led to the Tunisian revolution, many Tunisian fighters fought alongside Syrian rebels. In early 2012, Tunisia also withdrew recognition of Syria. Tunisians have been killed or captured in Syria, with at least five deaths from the town of Ben Guerdane, from where many fighters departed Tunisia for Syria. The Syrian government informed the United Nations of the arrest of 26 alleged al-Qaeda militants, 19 of whom were Tunisian. Tunisians are reportedly a large percentage of the foreign Arab fighters in the country. President Moncef Marzouki's spokesman Adnan Mancer said that the government was trying to follow up on the fate of Tunisians in Syria with the help of international organisations like the Red Cross as official ties between governments had been cut. He said: \\"Our youth have good intentions, but it is possible they fell into the hands of manipulators.\\" In March 2013, an inquiry was initiated in Tunisia into the recruitment of Tunisian Islamists to fight in Syria. In May, Foreign Minister Othmane Jarandi said that there were about 800 Tunisians fighting for the opposition in Syria. He added that \\"the repatriation of Tunisians can be facilitated by the embassy in Lebanon after the government makes contact with the Syrian authorities about imprisoned Tunisian citizens.\\" In 2017, it was estimated that Tunisia had contributed about 7000 fighters to the Islamic State, forming the largest contingent among the MENA countries. =Iraq= Islamic State of Iraq (ISI) was active in Syria until 2013. Al- Qaeda's central command authorized the Syrian ISI member Abu Mohammad al- Golani to set up a Syrian offshoot of al Qaeda. Golani and a small group of ISI operatives who crossed into Syria, and reached out to cells of militant Islamists who had been released by the Assad government from military prisons in May‚ÄìJune 2011. Golani's group formally announced itself under the name \\"Jabhat al-Nusra l'Ahl as-Sham\\" on 23 January 2012. Since then, there have been growing rifts between the various factions of al-Qaeda and ISIS. In addition, Iraqi Shia militia have had a heavy presence on the pro-government side in Syria, in militias including Harakat al-Nujaba, Kataib Seyyed al- Shuhada, and Kataib Hezbollah.Phillip Smyth, The Shiite Jihad In Syria And Its Regional Effects, The Washington Institute For Near East Policy, Policy Focus 138, 2015 Iraqi Popular Mobilisation Forces militias have been heavily deployed in Syria on the side of the government, often with the stated aim of defending Shi'ite shrines. Although at the time of the formation of the PMF, most of its component groups were primarily engaged in Iraq against ISIL, after the reduction of the immediate ISIL threat in Iraq from 2015, many returned to Syria. For instance, in January 2015 Kata‚Äôib Sayyid al-Shuhada announced the deaths of two of its fighters in defense of Sayeda Zainab in Damascus, and the militia's involvement in the 2015 Southern Syria offensive was documented by the Iraqi TV station Al-Anwar 2. In mid-2016, pro-government media reported that Harakat Al-Nujaba announced that they were sending 2,000 fighters to the southern Aleppo front. Between January 2012 and August 2018, at least 117 Iraq Shia fighters died in Syria. According to some reports, the number of Iraqi fighters killed in Syria in that period may be as high as 1,200. =Israel= There has been at least one report of Israeli-Arabs found to have traveled to Syria and fought for the rebels. One returnee who briefly fought in Syria was convicted of \\"endangering national security.\\" The case was described as \\"unprecedented\\", and Judge Avraham Yaakov said that \\"there's no legal guidance regarding the rebel groups fighting in Syria.\\" =Others= In June 2013, a recently promoted Jordanian Air Force captain was reported to have taken leave from his job and traveled to Turkey in order to fight for the Nusra Front. In November 2014, five people were jailed in Jordan for three to five years for \\"promoting... terrorist organisations\\" in reference to ISIS. Two others were also on trial as part of a crackdown on militants. Yemenis have also fought for both sides in the Syrian battle. Palestinians have also fought for both sides of the conflict with Hamas being more supportive of the opposition and the PFLP-GC supporting the government. A leading Mauritanian jihadist ideologue, Sheikh Abu al-Mundhir al-Shinqiti called in 2012 for support for the Nusra Front. Iran Thousands of Iranian operatives - as many as 10,000 by the end of 2013Iran boosts support to Syria, telegraph, 21 February 2014 \\\\- have fought in the Syrian war on the pro-government side, including regular troops and militia members. In 2018, Tehran said that 2,100 Iranian soldiers have been killed in Syria and Iraq over the past seven years. Afghanistan Afghan Shia fighters have had a major presence in Syria on the pro-government side. In 2018, it was reported that 2,000 Afghan had been killed and more than 8000 wounded in Syria in the past five years, fighting for the Liwa Fatemiyoun, composed mainly of members of the Hazarah Afghan minority. The Brigade reportedly had 10,000‚Äì20,000 fighters in 2016-2017. Azerbaijan Azerbaijan has a largely non-observant Shia population country with a Sunni minority. Some Sunni citizens of Azerbaijan have joined terrorist organizations in Syria. The estimated number of Azerbaijanis in Syria ranges from 200 to 300. Georgia According to Georgia's State Security Service, around 50 Georgian citizens, principally from the Kist (Chechen)-populated Pankisi Gorge, had joined the Islamist groups in Syria and Iraq as of June 2016. By June 2017, at least 25 citizens of Georgia have died in these conflicts. A veteran of the 2008 Russo-Georgian War and a former sergeant in the Georgian Army, Abu Omar al-Shishani, served as a commander for the Islamic State in Syria. Another one is Muslim Shishani. China =Jihadist foreign fighters= Flag of Turkistan Islamic Party in Syria The Uyghur militant group Turkistan Islamic Party in Syria (TIP) sent a large number of its fighters, operating in a unit called the \\"Turkistan Brigade\\" (Katibat Turkistani), to take part in the Syrian Civil War. They have taken part in numerous battles in Syria, including the 2015 Jisr al-Shughur offensive.https://archive.org/download/JennetAxikliri14/jennet%20axikliri14.mp4 The leader of TIP (ETIM) in Syria was Abu Rida al-Turkestani. The Turkistan Islamic Party is allied to Al-Qaeda. Jabhat Fatah al-Sham included Abu Omar al-Turkistani. The death of Abu Omar al-Turkistani happened on 19 January 2017. The death of Al-Turkistani was confirmed by JFS. Iran and Russia were attacked by the Turkistan Islamic Party. Jabal al-Zawiya, Ariha, and Jisr al- shoghur are locations in Idlib where there are many Uighur Turkistan Islamic Party members. Fahd Jasim al-Furayj, a Lietenant General, Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister of Syria had discussions with Guan Youfei, a Rear Admiral The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant released a video featuring an 80-year-old Uyghur man who came to join ISIL in Syria along with his grandchildren, wife, and daughter after he was inspired by his son who died in combat in Syria. Footage also emerged online of a Chinese rebel fighter in Syria, ne Bo Wang, a Muslim convert who calls himself Youssef. He appeared in a video in the northern Syrian countryside, in which he condemned the Syrian government for \\"butchering every Muslim here in cold blood, including children and women\\" and stating that \\"people have no freedom, no democracy, no security and no respect here, not at all.\\" He also spoke of historical Chinese ties to Syria, claiming that the Chinese government had destroyed the \\"traditional friendship between the Chinese and Arab people\\" because they \\"sell weapons and provide financial assistance to the Assad government.\\" Uyghurs were routed into Syria by way of Zeytinburnu by Turkey. Eric Draitser accused Turkish intelligence and the government of Turkey of helping transport Uighur jihadists. Uighurs have been allowed to transit to Turkey. A Uighur language version of al-Bayan was published by ISIS. After Jabal al-Arba'een was subjected to bombardment by the coalition, foreign fighters fled to Jabal al-Summaq. Homes of the Druze religious minority of Jabal al-Summaq's Kuku village were forcibly stolen and attacked by Turkistan Islamic Party Uyghurs and Uzbeks. Update (24 January 2017) Around Ariha, Russian plane bombs on 12 January 2017 killed the family of a Turkistan Islamic Party Uyghur leader and the leader himself. Doƒüu T√ºrkistan B√ºlteni Haber Ajansƒ± said that Russians bombed the family of Uyghur fighters in Idlib and the TIP retaliated by firing rockets against Iranian militias. Chechen groups, Katibat Tawhid wal Jihad (Uzbek), Imam Bukhari Jamaat (Uzbek), and Turkistan Islamic Party (Uighur) work with Nusra in Syria's northwestern area. Uyghur Turkistan Islamic Party members participated in the Battle of Aleppo. Children of militant Uighurs in the Turkistan Islamic Party have accompanied them. A Frenchman died while serving in TIP ranks. A Uighur language nasheed was released by ISIS. Uighurs appeared in the film. Uighur children appeared in an ISIS video. The ISIS Uighur members attacked the \\"moderate Syrian rebel\\" members who were allied to the Turkistan Islamic Party. The Turkistan Islamic Party, linked to Al-Qaeda, was criticized by the ISIL video. Children with weapons appeared in the video. Iraq was the location of the footage. The Islamic State's number of Uighur fighters is much smaller than that of the Turkistan Islamic Party's. Katibat al-Imam Bukhari (Uzbek), Uighur Turkistan Islamic Party, and the Uzbek Katibat al Tawhid wal Jihad are major Central Asian, Syria based factions. Uighur foreign fighters were urged to come to Syria by videos released by the Turkistan Islamic Party. Uyghur foreign fighters in Syria were addressed and advised by Muhaysini in a video speech released by the Turkistan Islamic Party. Footage of Muhaysini and Abdul Razzaq al-Mahdi giving speeches were used alongside old footage of Hasan Mahsum in \\"Blessed Are the Strangers #6‚Ä≥, a video released by the Syria based wing of the Turkistan Islamic Party. \\"Lovers of Paradise #20‚Ä≥ by the Turkistan Islamic Party showed Uyghur fighters in Syria. =People's Protection Units volunteers= In 2015 was known that at least two men from China were fighting in Syria for the YPG. One of them calls himself Ba Si Pan and the other is a Chinese-British communist named Huang Lei born in Sichuan Province. Central Asia In September 2013, a Kazakh and two Kyrgyz returned from Syria and were arrested in Osh on terrorism charges on claims that they were sent to Kyrgyzstan by the Islamic Jihad Union (IJU) to perpetrate attacks. In early February 2014, six suspects were arrested in Osh, some of whom were said to have trained in camps in Syria before returning to Kyrgyzstan. They were reportedly planning attacks in Osh and Bishkek. Some Kyrgyz fighters that were known to be in Syria joined the Al Nusrah Front. Kazakhs have joined ISIL in Syria and Iraq. ISIL released a video called \\"Race Toward Good\\" showing Kazakh children being trained as fighters. The families of Kazakh fighters have accompanied them to Syria including children and women. Families of Azeri and Kazakh members of ISIL have been reportedly massacred by the Syrian Islamist rebel group Harakat Nour al-Din al-Zenki. A Kazakh fighter has appeared in Jaish al-Muhajireen wal-Ansar. According to the testimony of a Kazakh student who returned to Kazakhstan from Syria, the Arab Jihadist rebels in Syria were racist against the Kazakhs, assigned them the most difficult duties, and called them \\"Chinese\\" and there were little feelings of solidarity among the militants. A new video of ISIL Kazakh child soldiers being given military training was reported in the media. Kazakh passports were seized by SDF. The Shadadi emir was Abu Khatab al-Kazakhi. Abu Aisha al-Kazakhi died in Syria. Kazakh and Uzbek ISIS members invited entire families form their home countries. Uzbek foreign fighters in Syria include Imam Bukhari Jamaat (ŸÉÿ™Ÿäÿ®ÿ© ÿßŸÑÿßŸÖÿßŸÖ ÿßŸÑÿ®ÿÆÿßÿ±Ÿä) (Uzbek: Imom al buxoriy katibasi) (Turkish: ƒ∞mam Buhari Cemaati), Katibat al Tawhid wal Jihad (ŸÉÿ™Ÿäÿ®ÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ™Ÿàÿ≠ŸäÿØ ŸàÿßŸÑÿ¨ŸáÿßÿØ) (Uzbek: Tavhid va Jihod katibasi) (Turkish: Tevhid ve Cihad Cemaati), https://twitter.com/joaska_/status/759296386097672192 https://twitter.com/joaska_/status/759312091396341760 https://twitter.com/Weissenberg7/status/760212899990212608 https://twitter.com/Weissenberg7/status/760219422313156608 https://twitter.com/Weissenberg7/status/760219783228891136 https://twitter.com/Weissenberg7/status/760220004893589504 https://twitter.com/Weissenberg7/status/760214596254707712 https://twitter.com/joaska_/status/760421737221726208 https://twitter.com/joaska_/status/760422193754959872 and Katibat Sayfulla (ŸÉÿ™Ÿäÿ®ÿ© ÿ≥ŸäŸÅ ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá), which is part of Jabhat al-Nusra.

It was a former part of Jabhat al-Nusra and is still an ally of the group. Katibat al Imam al Bukhari is also called Imam Bukhari Jamaat. The Uzbek group Imam Bukhari Jamaat pledged allegiance to the Taliban and is an Al-Qaeda ally. Uzbek foreign fighters have flocked to Katibat Imam al-Bukhari. Salahuddin al-Uzbeki is the leader of Imam Bukhari Jamaat and his son Umar, a 16 year old teenager, died while fighting in Aleppo against the Syrian military. A member of Imam Bukhari Jamaat defended the utilization of child soldiers. Allegiance was pledged to the Taliban and their leader Mullah Omar by Imam Bukhari Jamaat. On the VK social networking website, an illustration of a militant aiming an RPG at Santa Claus' flying sleigh was posted by Imam Bukhari Jamaat. The leader of Imam Bukhari Jamaat is Salohiddin. Child soldiers are being drilled by Imam Bukhari Jamaat. They battled in Aleppo and Latakia's Jabal al Akrad region. The Siege of al-Fu'ah and Kafriya is participated in by Imam Bukhari Jamaat. There are separate wings in both Syria and Afghanistan of the Uzbek Imam Bukhari Jamaat. Islamic Jihad Union and Imam Bukhari Jamaat are both in Afghanistan and Uzbek in addition to being allied with Al-Qaeda. Katibat Sayfulla is part of Jabhat al-Nusra. It participated in the Siege of Abu al-Duhur Airbase. Uzbek fighters in ISIL have participated in suicide bombings. Uzbeks make up ISIL's Katibat Al-Ghurabaa. ISIL has recruited hundreds of Tajiks from Tajikistan.http://www.syriahr.com/en/2015/01/18/about-200-tajik-citizens- fighting-in-syria-iraq/ Once the Central Asians died in battle, their wives were given to other fighters. 70 Uzbeks died in Idlib after a Turkistan Islamic Party site was hit by a missile. A bombing by the Russians killed \\"Malhama tactical\\" leader Abu Rofiq. He claimed to be unaffiliated. He was called Abu Rofik Abdul Mukaddim Tatarstani. He operated in Syria. The Turkistan Islamic Party has operated with Malhama Tactical. The Turkistan Islamic Party, Ajnad Kavkaz and Nusra received instruction under Malhama tactical. Former countries which were part of the Soviet Union were sending large numbers of fighters to Syria according to Putin. However, data regarding the flow of foreign fighters from Central Asian states remains patchy, with some researchers cautioning against inaccurate reporting, commentary by lobby groups, and think tank reports which are not based on triangulated data. Former Yugoslavia Muslims from the Balkans have joined the opposition in fighting against the Syrian government, and some have been killed. In 2013, it was reported that many recruits came from Serbia's Muslim-inhabited Sand≈æak region, particularly the city of Novi Pazar. Several hundred come from Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro and Macedonia. Many of the recruits were Salafists and, though denied by some Salafist leaders, Re≈°ad Plojoviƒá, the deputy leader of the Sand≈æak muftiate, said that \\"some organisations and individuals [are recruiting Balkan Muslims]. There are centers or individuals who probably have connections with certain organisations, and they are motivating people. They also may know ways to transport them to the war zone. Let's be frank. Many here do not even know where Syria is. They cannot know how to go there and get involved in all that is happening there.\\" Anel Grboviƒá, a journalist from Novi Pazar, wrote that most fighters from the Sand≈æak had been removed from the country's two official Islamic communities before traveling to Syria. \\"The fact is, there are illegal organisations recruiting people here. The fact is, there are houses where they come together. The fact is, there are facilities where they conduct their religious rituals ‚Äì which means they exclude themselves from the mosque. That means they exclude themselves from the system of the Islamic community and are more easily influenced by some individuals or organisations.\\" As for Albanian Muslims in Kosovo and Macedonia, they fought for the rebels in order to help \\"Sunni brothers\\" in their fight. At least one Macedonian fighter said he was recruited via an intermediary in Vienna. From Bosnia and Herzegovina, many Bosniaks joined the Nusra Front as Salafists (Salafism came to Bosnia during the Bosnian War with Saudi financing, though foreign fighters in that war stayed on in the country despite controversy). Some of relatives of the fighters have said that the leader of the predominantly Salafist Bosnian village of Gornja Maoƒça, Nusret Imamoviƒá, recruited the fighters; however he refused to be interviewed about the allegations. The director of the Bosnian State Investigation and Protection Agency, Goran Zubac, said that his office had questioned at least eight men linked to recruiting and sending the fighters to Syria, while he said his office was monitoring the Salafists. \\"If our priority is to fight against terrorism and these activities are a part of this sector, then you can rest assured that nobody in the State Investigation and Protection Agency is sleeping.\\" In 2013, FTV reported that a group of 52 Bosniak fighters went to Syria since the fighting commenced, though 32 fighters returned, while two were killed. An additional nine Bosniaks released a video tape saying they were going to fight in Homs, though they also mentioned the jihads in Iraq and Afghanistan. By April 2015, a total of 232 Kosovo Albanians had gone to Syria to fight with Islamist groups, most commonly the IS. Forty of these are from the town of Skenderaj (Srbica), according to Kosovo police reports. By September 2014, a total of 48 ethnic Albanians from several countries were killed fighting in Syria and Iraq. According to the Kosovar Centre for Security Studies, around 60 Kosovar fighters have been killed in combat as of March 2016. As of March 2016, the Albanian Government estimates that over 100 Albanian citizens have joined militant groups in Syria and Iraq, 18 of whom have been killed and 12 wounded. Macedonian citizens of Albanian descent are also fighting in Syria, and six were reported to have been killed by 2014. Russia The Russian security agency Federal Security Service in July 2013 estimated that about 200 Russian citizens were fighting for the Syrian opposition, while it expressed fears the fighters could carry out militant attacks upon returning. In December 2013, the Russian media estimate for Russian citizens fighting for the rebels was increased to 400. Academic research has highlighted unprecedented levels of mobilisation by Russian- speaking volunteers, while also illustrating inherent ambiguities in official estimates.Mark Youngman and Cerwyn Moore (2017)Russian-Speaking' Fighters in Syria, Iraq and at Home: Causes and Consequences' Although often cited as Chechen, due to the widespread use of the Arabic moniker al-Shishani, foreign fighters came from a wide variety of ethnic and sub-ethnic groups.Cerwyn Moore (2015) Foreign Bodies: Transnational Activism, the Insurgency in the North Caucasus and \\"Beyond\\", Terrorism and Political Violence, vol.27, no.3, 395-415. At least some also came from Diaspora communities. The Chechen-led Jaish al-Muhajireen wal-Ansar (JMA), which was said to be cooperating with the al-Qaeda-affiliated al-Nusra Front, was mid 2013, according to The Washington Free Beacon, one of the leading recruiters of foreign fighters into the jihad in Syria to fight Assad. Its online forum was said to show an easy access route, via Turkey, to the battlefield, which brought in more fighters. The Free Beacon also reported that Chechen fighters were bringing with them Russian-made SA-7 anti-aircraft missiles which are shoulder-fired and could be used to target civilian commercial airliners. JMA cut it links to ISIL in late 2013,\\"Should Georgia Fear IS Threat To Its Pankisi Gorge?\\". Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty. 14 October 2014. and continued respecting the Oath of Allegiance they had made to the Caucasus Emirate's Dokka Umarov. In September 2015, JMA joined the al-Nusra Front. Besides JMA, numerous other small factions and groups involving Russian-speaking foreign fighters, including some with links to the North Caucasus, are active in parts of Syria and Iraq. One of the more powerful Chechen-dominated militias in Syria was Junud al- Sham, but it fractured in course of 2016. Since then, Ajnad al-Kavkaz has become the most important independent rebel group led by North Caucasians in Syria. The group's leadership consists of Second Chechen War veterans. As of September 2015, according to Russian Civic Chamber's commission on public diplomacy and compatriots abroad, approximately 2,500 Russian nationals and 7,000 citizens of other post-Soviet republics were fighting alongside ISIL.\\"Security Service At Moscow Airport Detains Siberian Man Suspected To Join ISIS In Syria\\". IBTimes. 24 September 2015. As well as the large number of Russians fighting for al-Qaeda or ISIS, thousands have fought on the government side. Up until 2015, Russia provided military assistance and private contractors (at least 1,700 Russian contractors had reportedly been deployed to Syria up 2017), but from September 2015 formal Russian military intervention began, after an official request by the Syrian government for military aid against rebel and jihadist groups. Around 4,300 personnel were deployed,\\"Russian soldiers geolocated by photos in multiple Syria locations\\", MARIA TSVETKOVA, 8 November 2015, Reuters. \\"U.S. security officials and independent experts told Reuters last week that Moscow had increased its forces in Syria to 4,000 personnel from an estimated 2,000. A U.S. defense official said multiple rocket-launcher crews and long-range artillery batteries were deployed outside four bases the Russians were using\\".Russia's Defense Ministry never said how many troops it has in Syria, but turnout figures in voting from abroad in the September 2016 parliamentary elections indicated that Russian military personnel in the Arab nation at the time likely exceeded 4,300. and by September 2018 Russia had reported 112 losses. Southeast Asia Indonesia and Malaysia are the main source of foreign fighters from Southeast Asia with an estimated of 500 Indonesians and 200 Malaysians have travelling to Syria to fight for the Islamic State. It is also suspected that more than 200 Filipinos, mostly the members of Abu Sayyaf (ASG) and Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) are training and fighting in Iraq and Syria under Islamic State. Southeast Asian countries are the origin of approximately 500 child fighters in ISIL. In March 2019, the Malaysian Government has announced that it would allow Malaysian foreign fighters to return provided that they comply with checks and enforcement and complete a one-month government-run rehabilitation programme. This rehabilitation program involves returnees being examined by psychologists and clerics. Ayob Khan Mydin Pitchay, the counter-terrorism head of the Malaysian Special Branch, has confirmed that 11 Malaysians have returned including eight men, a woman, and two young children. The men were charged in court and convicted while the woman attended a rehabilitation programme. According to Ayob, 51 Malaysians remain in Syria including 17 children. Western countries Both European converts and immigrant or immigrant's children have gone to fight for the Syrian opposition. This includes citizens from France (with the leading number of fighters), followed by the United Kingdom, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Italy. A report by the International Centre for Counter- Terrorism - The Hague (ICCT) from April 2016 shows that there is a total of 3,922-4,294 foreign fighters from EU Member States of whom 30 percent have returned to their home countries. EU anti-terrorism coordinator Gilles de Kerchove said that this was a worrying trend as those who return could be more radicalized. EUROPOL Director Rob Wainright issued his 2013 report and said that the returning fighters \\"could incite other volunteers to join the armed struggle,\\" as well as use their training, combat experience, knowledge and contacts to conduct such activities within the EU. European criminals are targeted by the Islamic State for recruitment, an estimated 50-80% of Europeans in IS have a criminal record. This is higher than al-Qaeda, where 25% of Europeans have a criminal record. There were also Australians and citizens of the United States fighting for the Syrian opposition camp, despite possible prosecution by their government for terrorism amid fears they could return home and carry out attacks. Australian security agencies estimated about 200 Australians to be fighting in the country with dozens said to be part of the Nusra Front. The first European to fight for the Syrian opposition was reported by Der Spiegel to be a fighter for the Free Syrian Army who was \\"a Frenchman who had just turned 24 and comes from a wealthy family. He just turned up here with his credit card in hand.\\" A Michigan-born U.S.-convert to Islam was also the first U.S. citizen to be killed in Syria, reportedly by the government, as she was taking part in a reconnaissance mission with two Britons near Aleppo. In July 2013, a U.S.-Egyptian man named Amiir Farouk Ibrahim (from Pennsylvania) went missing in Syria, presumed by the media to be fighting with rebel forces. His passport was discovered, amongst others, in an Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant base which had been captured by Kurdish rebels. His family was aware he was in Syria, but his father did not believe that his son had gone there for humanitarian purposes. Western countries, including the U.K., have provided aid to the rebels. As of November 2013, there are believed to be approximately 600 fighters from Western countries in Syria. Norway's Thomas Hegghammer issued a report that suggested one in nine Westerners who fight in foreign jihadist insurgencies end up becoming involved in attack plots back home. The Associate Director of the Melbourne School of Government David Malet, however, suggested that while research on foreign fighters was a new field, different studies showed another view to the likelihood of blowback from returning fighters. \\"Other studies show that most foreign fighters simply resume their previous lives so long as they are provided amnesty.\\" Meanwhile, France was estimated to have up to 700 of its citizens fighting in Syria. At least one pregnant Austrian indicated she wanted to return home. =Australia= There were an estimated 50‚Äì100 Australians fighting in the country as of January 2014, with total calculations for the war reaching about 200 fighters. About six were reported to have died and the others were suggested as having returned home. In Sydney and Melbourne, in particular, opponents and supporters of the government have resorted to beatings, assaults, shootings and property, largely along sectarian lines. There were more than 15 incidents of violence involving members of the Lebanese, Turkish and Syrian communities, although in 2013 it had decreased from the previous year. The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) reported at the end of the year: \\"The situation in Syria, with the potential for violence spilling into other parts of the Middle East, increases the possibility of associated communal violence in Australia and remains a concern for ASIO.\\" Zaky Mallah, the first person to be charged and acquitted under Australia's anti-terrorism laws, suggested: \\"The majority of Australians heading to Syria are from Lebanese backgrounds. The Lebanese youth here feel disadvantaged, isolated and discriminated against. Many [are] unemployed and have turned to religion as a result.\\" After the death of a couple from western Sydney in the country, Minister for Immigration and Border Protection Scott Morrison suggested those fighting in Syria could risk losing their citizenship, while the Australian Federal Police added that those returning from the fighting would be considered a national security threat. ASIO confiscated the passports of those it suspected of travelling to engage in \\"politically motivated violence;\\" from mid-2012 to mid-2013 18 passports were confiscated. In December 2018, Australian authorities stripped a jihadist who had fought for ISIS and was held in Turkey on terror-related charges of his Australian citizenship. He had left Australia for Syria in 2013. The jihadist had both Australian and Fijian citizenship and according to Australian law, an individual holding dual citizenship can be stripped of citizenship if convicted or suspected of terror offences. In 2013, A suicide attack on a school where Syrian troops were stationed in Deir al-Zor was said to have been perpetrated by an Australian named Abu Asma al-Australi for the al-Nusra Front. Reports indicated he was from Queensland and travelled to Syria with his wife before sending her back to Australia. A spokesman for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said that the Australian government was aware of the reports that an Australian had killed himself, but could not confirm any of the speculation. He added that the government had concern about its citizens fighting in the country, including with the al-Nusra Front. =Belgium= As an ICCT report from April 2016 shows, Belgium has the highest per-capita foreign fighter contingent. The estimated number is between 420-516 individuals. This group consists of a wide age range, with people between 14‚Äì69 years old ‚Äì with an average of 25.7. Moroccan-born IS recruiter Khalid Zerkani recruited 72 young individuals with migrant backgrounds of whom most were petty criminals. He encouraged them to steal from non-Muslims in order to finance their journeys to join the caliphate. The Chief of the 'Coordination Unit for Threat Analysis', Paul Van Tigchelt, said on 28 September 2016 that there are 632 known persons designated as 'foreign terrorist fighters'. Out of these 632 people, 273 are believed to be abroad, fighting or dead. In the 2012-2016 timespan, of the about 500 individuals who left the country to fight in the civil war in Syria, the great majority were of Moroccan descent according to U.S. and Belgian authorities. In July 2020, Belgian authorities stripped eight IS fighters with dual citizenships of their Belgian citizenships, after Turkey had warned that IS supporters would be sent to their country of origin. = Denmark = According to the Danish Security and Intelligence Service (PET), up to 125 people have left the country since 2011 to travel to the Syria/Iraq war zone where the majority joined the Islamic State. Of those who went, 27 have died and some deaths were due to participating in suicide attacks. A minority of those who went to groups who opposed Islamist organizations. The great majority of those who joined the conflict were young Sunni Muslims of whom some where converts. Those who went were part of the Islamist scenes in Copenhagen, Aarhus and Odense. Of the 22 who travelled from Aarhus, all came from the Grimh√∏j mosque. In March 2018, the government of Denmark changed the citizenship law so that children of Danish citizens fighting for the Islamic State will no longer automatically receive Danish citizenship. =France= An ICCT report shows that more than 900 people have travelled from France to Syria and/or Iraq by October 2015. There is no profile that defines a French foreign fighter, except for mostly young males with a criminal record; foreign fighters come from different regions and socio-economic environments. About 200 were female and a few were entire families who intended to settle in the caliphate. In 2015 the USMA Combating Terrorism Center identified 32 French facilitators who supported individuals intending to join jihadist groups in the Middle East. By 2015, 14 of the foreign fighters from France had either died in suicide bombings or expressed their willingness to do so. After it was revealed that a teen and other youths from Nice joined ISIS in Syria, the mother of one of the youths who was later reported dead filed a civil suit against the French government. The women accused the government of negligence for letting her son travel to a danger zone. In Iraq and Syria foreign fighters from France number around 689 according to the French government. In May 2019, four French citizens were sentenced to death by an Iraqi court for joining the Islamic State. One of the convicts had served in the French army from the year 2000, and had done a tour in Afghanistan in 2009 and left the army in 2010. =Germany= For Germany, the estimation is that between 720 and 760 people have travelled to Syria and/or Iraq. 40 percent of this group holds only German citizenship, while another 20 percent holds dual citizenship of which one is German. In 2017, the federal police of Germany estimated that between 60% to two thirds of IS fighters coming from Germany had a criminal record, with the vast majority (98%) being repeat offenders with an average of 7.6 crimes per individual. In February 2019, Katrin G√∂ring-Eckardt from the Green party encouraged the government of Germany to bring German citizens who had fought for the Islamic State back to Germany. The interior minister of Bavaria, Joachim Herrmann (CSU), encouraged the government to strip IS warriors of their German citizenship. In April 2019, Germany changed the law so German citizens with dual citizenship who fight with foreign terrorist militias can be stripped of their German citizenship. The law also applies to members of the PKK, which according to the domestic intelligence agency is \\"the biggest and most powerful foreign extremist organization in Germany.\\" On August 19, 2019, Kurdish-led administration in Syria handed over four children, whose parents were \\"Islamic State\\" (IS) fighters, to Germany. Among the children are three orphans, including a boy, two girls, and a 6-month-old ailing girl. This was the first time Germany repatriated children of ISIS militants. In August 2019, US President Donald Trump threatened to release over 2,000 captured ISIS Fighters into France and Germany if US‚Äô European allies did not repatriate \\"their\\" citizens-turned-terrorists. Of 778 individuals who had travelled to the conflict zone from Germany, 504 or nearly two thirds, had criminal convictions and 32% of those had been sentenced for 5 crimes or more. On October 16, 2019, a German National going by the name Konstantin Gedig AKA \\"Andok Cotkar\\" was killed by a Turkish Airstrike while serving with the YPG International branch outside of Sere Kaniye.https://www.dw.com/en/german-man- fighting-for-kurds-killed-in-syria/a-51120623 =Ireland= As of January 2015, the Department of Justice and Equality estimates that approximately 50 Irish residents have travelled to Syria to fight for rebel forces in the civil war since 2011. At least three Irish citizens are known to have been killed in combat. According to the Department of Justice, many have \\"participated in the conflict under the flag of fundamentalist and extreme organisations\\" and \\"may pose certain threats\\" upon their return to Ireland and the European Union. The Garda S√≠och√°na (Irish national police) \\"will continue to monitor developments in this area and take action as required,\\" including officers from the Garda Middle Eastern Bureau of the Special Detective Unit (SDU) and Garda Racial, Intercultural and Diversity Office (GRIDO). According to The International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence (ICSR), \\"per capita, Ireland is probably the biggest (contributor of fighters) of all the countries we looked at because Ireland has a small population.\\" According to media reports, Garda and Military Intelligence are monitoring between 30 and 60 potential Islamist fighters both in the Irish state and Irish citizens fighting abroad in Syria and Iraq. Security sources estimated that some 20 fighters may have returned to Ireland as of November 2015. = Italy = In the 2011-July 2018 period, foreign fighters linked to Italy (among them citizens or residents) numbered 135, which was less than both France (1900) and Germany (about 1000). Most joined jihadist groups such as the Islamic State and Jabhat Al-Nusra, while others joined non-jihadist formations or the Free Syrian Army. Unlike in other Western European countries where most of the fighters were born in the country, only a few of those who went to the conflict zone were born in Italy. 14 had Italian citizenship and 10 had dual citizenship. It was noted that the number of Tunisian nationals living in Italy who went to the conflict zone (39) was far higher than the number of Italians. Slighly more than half (50.4%) of fighters linked to Italy came from countries in North Africa.12 of the fighters were from countries in the Balkans. The wife of Moroccan kickboxer Abderrahim Moutaharrik‚Äîwho was imprisoned in 2017 for allegedly having links to the terror organization, Islamic State (ISIS)‚Äîwas deported from Italy to Morocco for security concerns. =The Netherlands= As of April 2016, 220 people had left to go to Syria/Iraq. The majority of them were male and under 25. The Parliament of Netherlands voted in 2016 for legislation to strip Dutch citizens who join ISIS or al Qaeda abroad of their citizenship, also if they have not been convicted of any crime. The law can only be applied to individuals with double citizenship. Justice Minister Ard Van der Steur stated the legal changes were necessary to stop jihadists from returning to the Netherlands. In September 2017, four jihadists were stripped of their citizenship. In 2017 the Dutch security service AIVD approximated the number of female jihadists in the Netherlands to about 100 and at least 80 women had left the Netherlands to join the conflict, the majority of whom joined ISIS. When the military pressure increased on jihadist groups in Syra and Iraq, Netherlands- originating women tried to flee the area. In the 2012-November 2018 period, above 310 individuals had travelled from the Netherlands to the conflict in Syria and Iraq. Of those 85 had been killed and 55 returned to the Netherlands. Of the surviving Dutch foreign fighters in the region, 135 are fighters in the conflict zone and three quarters are members of ISIS. The remaining quarter have joined Al-Qaeda affiliated groups such as Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham or Tanzim Hurras al-Deen. =New Zealand= In mid-October 2014, the- then Prime Minister John Key confirmed that several New Zealand foreign fighters had joined various Middle Eastern factions including ISIS. That same month, the New Zealand Government approved \\"terms of references\\" allowing the Department of Internal Affairs to suspend the passports of prospective foreign fighters and the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service to conduct video surveillance of those individuals. The Prime Minister also confirmed that the Government maintained a watchlist of 30 to 40 \\"people of concern in the foreign fighter context\\" including individuals who had traveled to Syria to engage with ISIS. In December 2014, the Fifth National Government passed a Countering Terrorist Fighters Legislation Act with the support of the Labour, ACT, and United Future parties which amended three existing laws to give the NZSIS greater powers of surveillance and the Minister of Internal Affairs greater powers to cancel and suspend passports. In October 2016, Key also confirmed that several New Zealand foreign \\"jihadis\\" and \\"jihadi brides\\" had travel to Syria and Iraq to join ISIS. He confirmed that some had traveled via Australia and that some had dual citizenship. By December 2018, the New Zealand Herald reported that eight individuals had their passports cancelled, withdrawn, or applications denied under the Counter Terrorist Fighters Legislation Act. According to a TVNZ \\"Sunday\\" programme that aired on 11 March 2018, several New Zealanders including \\"Ashley\\" and \\"Sores\\" had also traveled to Syria to fight in support of the Kurdish Democratic Union Party's militias People's Protection Units (YPG) and the Women's Protection Units (YPJ), which were fighting against ISIS. One notable New Zealand citizen who had become an ISIS foreign fighter is Mark John Taylor (also known as Mohammad Daniel and Abu Abdul Rahman), who was designated as a \\"Specially Designated Global Terrorist\\" by the United States Department of State in 2017. In April 2015, Taylor published a YouTube video calling on Australian and New Zealand Jihadists to attack police and military personnel on Anzac Day. In early March 2019, it was reported by the Australian Broadcasting Company that Taylor had been captured by Kurdish forces in Syria and is seeking to return home. In response, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern confirmed that New Zealand would not be stripping Taylor of his citizenship but that he would have to make his own travel arrangements. She also warned that he could face prosecution for joining a terrorist organisation should he return to New Zealand. =Norway= On 27 May 2014, a Somali and two Kosovars, all Norwegian citizens from Oslo, were arrested after being suspected of supporting the ISIS. The death of Kosovar, Egzon Avdyli, who grew up in Norway, was covered in the media. He had also been a spokesman for the Norway-based Prophet's Ummah and was said to have left for Syria earlier in the year. He \\"supported the establishment of an Islamic state in Norway or other Western countries.\\" At least 50 were thought to have traveled from Norway to Syria to fight for the Islamists, with Norwegian intelligence groups said to be concerned of the danger of them returning. In May 2015 two men, 30-year-old Djibril Abdi Bashir and 28-year- old Valon Avdyli, were sentenced in Norway to four years in prison for joining Islamic State militants in Syria. Valon's 25-year-old brother, Visar Avdyli, was convicted of providing logistical support, and sentenced to a seven-month prison term. A month later, another man was arrested for suspected ties to the Islamic State and traveling to Syria to join jihadi militants. The 18-year-old was apprehended by the Swedish government at G√∂teborg Landvetter Airport at Norway's request. If convicted, the unidentified man faces up to six years in prison. About 70 people have left Norway to become foreign fighters in Syria or Iraq, while around 20 have returned. It is estimated that at least 124 people have travelled from Denmark to Syria and/or Iraq since January 2011. In February 2019, Prime Minister Erna Solberg said that fighters who return to Norway will be investigated by police and face criminal charges. In May 2019 it was announced that both men and women who had joined the Islamic State who only had residence permits in Norway would have their permits annulled to prevent them from returning to Norway. In September 2019, 15 foreigners in Norway had their residence permits revoked. = Poland = In 2015, about 20-40 Polish citizens were believed to have travelled to the conflict zone, most of them at the time did not live in Poland but in other European countries. One of those carried out a suicide attack on an oil refinery in June 2015. = Spain = An ICCT report shows that more than 139 people have travelled from Spain to Syria and/or Iraq by November 2015 with about 10% of those being female. A detailed analysis of 20 fighters who had joined before 2014 showed that eleven of those were Spanish citizens and the remaining were Moroccans living in Spain. Most of those who joined lived in the Ceuta enclave in North Africa, but also Girona and Malaga. At the time of departure, most were married with children and were either students or low-skilled workers. Several were known to police for drug trafficking. Of those 20, three Muslim Spanish from Ceuta became suicide bombers. In a joint operation in mid-March, Spanish and Moroccan security services targeted an al Qaeda recruiting network and arrested four suspected members in Spain and three others in Morocco. The network, whose activities extend to Morocco, Belgium, France, Tunisia, Turkey, Libya, Mali, Indonesia, and Syria, is headed by Melilla resident Mustafa Maya Amaya, who funneled recruits to the ISIS, the Al Nusrah Front and AQIM. Some of those arrested had returned home from conflict zones such as Syria; and in January, a suspected jihadist returning from Syria was arrested in M√°laga as a potential \\"threat to national security.\\" On 30 April, Spanish security forces, working with French police, arrested Abdelmalek Tanem, a dual Algerian-French citizen, in Almeria, who had recently returned from Syria where he worked towards facilitating integration of Europeans into the Al Nusrah Front and ISIS. On 30 May 2014, Spanish security forces arrested six people in Melilla who were involved in a network that sends fighters to al Qaeda camps in Syria, Mali, and Libya. The cell leader, Benaissa Laghmouchi Baghdadi, had spent eight months in Syria and also had ties to al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and the Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa (MUJAO) in Mali. Some of those arrested also had linked to Sharia4Spain. = Sweden = Up to 2018, an estimated 300 individuals had travelled from Sweden to join the civil war in Syria. In March 2018 Kurdish authorities reported they had captured 41 IS supporters with either Swedish citizenship or residence permit in Sweden, of which 5 had key positions in the organisation and one was the head of the ISIL propaganda efforts. In February 2019, the prime minister of Sweden Stefan L√∂fven announced that Swedish authorities had discouraged travel to the conflict zone in Syria since 2011. The prime minister also said that Swedish authorities would offer no help or assistance to people who had joined or fought the Islamic State. In March 2019, Swedish Television conducted a survey of 41 Islamic State fighters who had returned of whom 12 were women. A third of those who returned to Sweden have since been convicted of serious crimes such as attempted murder, money laundering, extortion, drug offences, fraud, aggravated assault and tax evasion. Michael Skr√•mo, a Norwegian-Swedish fighter for ISIL who resided in Sweden, was killed in March 2019. On 3 August 2013, two Lebanese-Swedish brothers, Hassan and Moatasem Deeb, were killed in a rebel assault on the Abu Zeid army checkpoint near Qalaat al-Hosn, according to their cousin and a Tripoli cleric. Moatasem died as he detonated his explosive vest in a car at the checkpoint and his brother died in the ensuing fighting. This followed their other brother, Rabih's, death in Tripoli the previous year. The Syrian-born chairman of the Stockholm mosque, Haytham Rahmeh, reportedly smuggled weapons to the rebels for 18 months. Rahmeh, a member of the Syrian National Council, a former member of the Muslim Brotherhood and member of Islamic relief in Sweden was said to have bought the weapons mainly in Libya and with support from the Commission for Civilian Protection and then transported them through Turkey to Syria. In June 2019, it was reported that four foreign fighters who had returned from the conflict in Middle East had become employees of the Islamic charter school Vetenskapsskolan which is funded by tax payers. Two of them were women who followed their children to live among groups affiliated to the Islamic State. =United Kingdom= Robin Simcox of the Henry Jackson Society claimed that the number of British citizens who went to fight in Syria is higher than during the Iraq War and Afghanistan War combined. The International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation assessed that up to 366 British citizens had been involved in the war in Syria as of December 2013. However, a report from the International Centre for Counter-Terrorism ‚Äì The Hague from April 2016, showed that there are between 700-760 foreign fighters from the United Kingdom. Over 350 people have returned to the UK. The Rayat al-Tawheed group is composed of British combatants linked to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Similarly, the suffix \\"al-Britani\\" was adopted by British Islamist fighters. In May 2014, a British citizen was killed in fighting. The Free Syrian Army's Abdullah al-Bashir asserted that British fighters were the largest foreign contingent of Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. During Ramadan 2014, over 140 Imams signed an open letter asking British Muslims not to travel to Syria (as well as ISIS conflict that had spread to Iraq at the time). Additionally, they were urged to make donations to people in the country from the U.K. itself with one such imam, Shahid Raza of Leicester Central Mosque, making the call. In October 2014, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe said: \\"We still have an average of five people joining them (ISIS) a week. Five a week doesn't sound much but when you realise there are 50 weeks in a year, 250 more would be 50% more than we think have gone already. Those are the ones that we believe have gone. There may be many more who set out to travel to another country and meandered over to Syria and Iraq in a way that is not always possible to spot when you have failed states and leaky borders.\\" He added that this estimate was a \\"minimum\\" and \\"the drumbeat of terrorism in Britain\\" is now \\"faster and more intense.\\" An ISIS video released by British- based Abu Muthanna al Yemeni claimed \\"We have brothers from Bangladesh, from Iraq, from Cambodia, Australia, U.K.\\" ISIS also threatened fighters with execution for returning to Britain. In November, Regnum reported that \\"White Widow\\" Samantha Lewthwaite, who had fought in Syria the previous month, was shot dead by a Russian voluntary sniper while she was fighting for the Ukrainian volunteer battalion Aidar during the War in Donbass. Though it was not formally verified, and her father has not confirmed the reports, it was reported in the Western press. Around Mosul a suicide bombing was carried out by a past inmate of Guantanamo called Jamal al Harith. Ronald Fiddler was the original name of Jamal Al-Harith, the past inmate terrorist of Guantanamo who killed himself for ISIS. Britain had given him one million pounds over his time in Guantanamo. The Conservatives gave him the money. He also called himself Abu Zakariya. Fiddler's parents were Jamaican. He went to Tell Abyad. The United Kingdom stripped some of the fighters of their UK citizenship to prevent them from returning, as this would constitute an influx of militants. The Crown Prosecution Service warned in 2014 that \\"any British resident travelling to take part in fighting will face criminal charges\\", although Charles Farr, head of the Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism, said that the government did not want to target those with humanitarian aims, and would exercise judgement in such cases. The U.K. arrested former Guantanamo Bay detention camp detainee Moazzam Begg for \\"attending [a] terrorist training camp\\" in Syria and \\"facilitating terrorism overseas.\\" In October 2019, British officials initiated the repatriation of stranded children in Syria by getting in touch with local authorities to identify unattended children and create a safe passage from them to the UK. =United States= The numbers of fighters for ISIS from the United States is not clear. They are apparently not of single ethnicity, and include naturalized citizens, as well as some young women. On October 1, 2020, the United States Department of Justice said that they have successfully repatriated 27 Americans from Syria and Iraq.{{https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/united-states-has- repatriated-27-americans-syria-and-iraq-including-ten-charged-terrorism Mohammad Hamzeh Khan arrested by the United States while leaving to join ISIS, declared that ISIS had established the perfect Islamic state and that he felt obligated to \\"migrate\\" there. Ahmad Khan, an American teenager, was to meet a member of ISIS in Turkey. Another young American, of 17 years-old, acknowledged distributing nearly 7 thousand tweets in support of ISIS, as well as aiding the immigration of another youth to Syria. Pakistan In 2013, the Pakistani Taliban said that its fighters, from a variety of countries, were fighting against the Syrian government. They were reportedly working with the Nusra Front and al-Qaeda in Iraq. The group's commanders said that they sought to fight in Syria in order to foster closer links with al-Qaeda's central leadership. An unnamed Taliban commander was quoted by Reuters in 2013 as saying that the group was fighting alongside their Mujahedeen friends: \\"When our brothers needed our help, we sent hundreds of fighters along with our Arab friends.\\" He added that videos would be released showing the group's \\"victories\\" in Syria. Another commander said: \\"Since our Arab brothers have come here for our support, we are bound to help them in their respective countries and that is what we did in Syria. We have established our own camps in Syria. Some of our people go and then return after spending some time fighting there. The group's spokesman, Abdul Rashid Abbasi, said on 16 July 2013 that its first batch of fighters had arrived in Syria and set up a command and control centre and that another batch of at least 120 fighters were expected to join the others within a week. While a militant said that 100 fighters had reached Syria and another 20 were on the way with an untold number of volunteers waiting, the Foreign Office spokesman Aizaz Chaudhry said: \\"We have seen these reports in the media and the concerned authorities are verifying these claims by the militants.\\" However, the Istanbul-based Syrian National Council released a statement that read: \\"We ask for clarification regarding coverage that reflects poorly on the Syrian revolution, particularly news about Taliban's office in Syria and other news items about Islamist fighters.\\" It also cited the Taliban's Shura Council as denying the news and calling it a \\"rumor.\\" Specifically, Ahmed Kamel said the reports of the Taliban's presence were a \\"systematic\\" and \\"rapid\\" campaign by pro-government outlets to \\"smear\\" the rebels. He said that these were \\"sick attempts to make the Syrian people look like a bunch of radical Islamists. Syria is bigger than all of these lies and we know, based on our contacts inside Syria, that no Pakistani Taliban are fighting alongside the Syrian rebels. The Taliban want to kill Americans and Israelis, so why they should go to Syria when we are fighting for freedom, democracy and justice against a tyrant?\\" In addition, large numbers of Pakistani Shia fighters have fought on the pro-government side, mainly in the Zeinabiyoun Brigade, which has up to 1,000 fighters in Syria. 158 Shia Pakistani fighters were killed in Syria between January 2012 and August 2018. The Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have shared a list of the names of 29 Pakistanis among who are in their custody for fighting for the Islamic State, also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Others Other Non-Arab fighters came from Turkey, Tajikistan and Pakistan. Though they were reported to be callous, under- trained and poor, particularly in comparison to the Chechens. Other Muslim contingents included: South and Central Asians (Afghans, Bangladeshis and Pakistanis), Westerners (Belgian, British, French, U.S., Australia, Denmark, Germany, Netherlands, Sweden, Canada and Austria), as well as Azerbaijan (members of the country's Sunni minority), Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan. The core foreign support lies with the Al Qaeda-linked ISIS, which is in opposition to the Islamic Front and other non-Islamist groups. Reports indicated the inclusion of Buddhist-majority Khmers fighting with ISIS, including those who studied in madrassas in the Middle East. A Turkish member of the Turkistan Islamic Party Hudhayfah al-Turki blew himself up in Aleppo. A French national named Ubeydullah was killed while fighting for the Turkistan Islamic Party in 2017. The Turkistan Islamic Party had another member from France, Reda Layachi, who was of Moroccan descent and went by the name Abu Talha. Reactions =Government= ;Syria On 3 July 2013, it was reported that Syrian aircraft had dropped leaflets over areas in Idlib province calling on both rebels to turn themselves over to the authorities and for foreign fighters to return to their countries. ;International ;;Official In June 2014, the European Union's Director of Justice and Home Affairs Gilles de Kerchove estimated that there were about 500 fighters from the E.U. with the U.K., Ireland and France estimated to have the most citizens fighting there. He added that while \\"not all of them are radical when they leave, but most likely many of them will be radicalised there, will be trained. And as we've seen this might lead to a serious threat when they get back.\\" European intelligence agencies were said to have stepped up investigations with Britain and Belgium increasing efforts to track how people are recruited. The Netherlands' officials raised the terror threat level to \\"substantial\\" partly over concerns about radicalised citizens returning from Syria. The director of the U.S. government's National Counterterrorism Center Matthew Olsen told the Aspen Security Forum that an increasing number of foreign fighters from the West were fighting for the Nusra Front and that they were \\"the most capable fighting force within the opposition. Syria has become really the predominant jihadist battlefield in the world. We see foreign fighters going from Western Europe and, in a small number of cases, from the United States to Syria to fight for the opposition.\\" He, along with other speakers, speculated that there was an increased threat of attacks should the fighters return home. The European Union's counter-terrorism coordinator, Gilles de Kerchove, said that about 600 fighters had traveled from Europe to Syria and that should the Balkans and North Africa be counted there would be thousands of fighters. Olsen added that \\"the concern going forward from a threat perspective is there are individuals traveling to Syria, becoming further radicalised, becoming trained and then returning as part of really a global jihadist movement to Western Europe and, potentially, to the United States.\\" Despite former Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi's call for a jihad in Syria, the interim leadership in the country said that it had no intention of calling for such a jihad and that it would re-evaluate Morsi's cutting of diplomatic relations with Syria. On 8 July, following the 2013 Egyptian coup d'√©tat, amid fears that many fighters were going to Egypt in support of the Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt put travel restrictions on Syrian entering that country and required a visa before they entered Egypt. The Kremlin was said to be concerned about links between northern Caucasus militants and the Islamist oppositions fighters. The Australian government was also concerned about returning fighters. Saudi Grand Mufti Abdul-Aziz ibn Abdullah Al ash-Sheikh called for Syrians to be \\"enable[d]\\" to protect themselves. He also said of fighters going to the country that \\"this is all wrong, it's not obligatory. I do not advise one to go there...you will be a burden to them, what they want from you is your prayer. These are feuding factions and one should not go there. I do not advise one to go there...Going to a land that you do not know and without experience, you will be a burden to them, what they want from you is your prayer. Muslim should be fearful of God and not deceive young Muslims and exploit their weakness and lack of insight and push them to an abyss. I advise them to advise as they would advise their sons.\\" This was seen as a Saudi fear of its citizens returning home with skills they learnt against the Saudi state. Turkish intelligence supported Islamist radicals like the al-Nusra Front and aided their passage into Syria and supported arming the rebels. Then President Abdullah Gul said Syria risks becoming \\"Afghanistan on the shores of the Mediterranean\\" and that Turkey could become a Mediterranean Pakistan. French Interior Minister Manuel Valls said that French national fighting for extremist groups could become enemies of France when they return to home. The Norwegian Police Security Service estimated that up to 40 Norwegians had gone to Syria to fight, but that the number might be higher. As of November 2013 at least five are presumed dead and some have returned to Norway. Many are recruited through Islamist groups in Norway and fight for organisations such as Jaish al-Muhajireen wal-Ansar, ISIS and al-Nusra. Both the Security Service and academics have expressed worry that returning fighters might pose a future threat to Norway. The U.K. also confirmed over 200 Syrian trained fighters had returned home with the intent to carry out attacks. In April 2014, it was announced that nine unnamed European countries were to take measures to prevent its citizens from fighting in Syria. They would be joined by the United States, Turkey, Morocco, Jordan and Tunisia. Belgian Interior Minister Joelle Milquet said that his country had taken steps in 2014 to address the problem and sought to increase international cooperation in the matter because \\"coping with the return [of fighters], that is our main concern.\\" It followed European Union warnings that its citizens were going to fight in Syria and countries like Somalia and Sudan and that they could return more radicalised and trained in guerrilla tactics that could prove a security risk. Milquet added that an informal ministerial group with France in 2013 year, brought together officials from the U.K., Netherlands and Spain, which, in turn, then met officials from the U.S., Canada and Australia. France and England had also announced plans to prevent their citizens from fighting in Syria. France announced a set of 20 measures to deal with the issue with President Francois Hollande saying \\"France will take all measures to dissuade, prevent and punish those who are tempted to fight where they have no reason to be,\\" while Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius estimated that about 500 French citizens were involved in the conflict. The U.K. police announced that they would appeal to Muslim women to help persuade youths not to fight in the war. In April 2014, the U.K. enacted Operation Mum that seeks Muslim women informing against family members who consider going to Syria to fight. It comes as up to 700 citizens were said to have traveled there, with 20 known deaths and more in detention. Australia expressed concern that veterans of the conflict posed a graver threat that those during the September 11 attacks, while another unnamed official compared the threat to the 2008 Mumbai attacks. Prime Minister Tony Abbott said: > This is a big issue; it's concerning people right around the world. We have > an ongoing Islamist terror threat and the situation in Syria has the > potential to escalate that threat as militarised radicals come back. I don‚Äôt > say that there is any simple solution to this problem, but the vigilance > that's been maintained since 2001 needs to be increased in these > circumstances and its certainly no time to be reducing the emphasis on good > intelligence which has been a very important part of Australia's response to > the terror threat ever since then. Abbott signed an agreement with French President Fran√ßois Hollande to share intelligence on each other's citizens who had fought in Syria. He made a similar deal with Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono when the met on Batam Island in early June 2014. The ISIS flag was seen being waved thrice in Jammu and Kashmir. However, Chief Minister Omar Abdullah alleged that: \\"You have to understand that no ISIS group has been identified so far in the valley. The flag of the ISIS was waved by some idiots, which does not mean that ISIS has any presence in Kashmir.\\" He further noted that legal action was taken against the tailor who made it and those who flew it. In another instance it was waved after Friday prayers. Also, the entire leadership of self proclaimed ISIS affiliate was killed by Indian security forces in June 2018, this erasing any presence of group in the area. The governments of Malaysia and Indonesia as well the Philippines and Thailand were also concerned about returning fighters. On at least one occasion Malaysian reports indicated that Islamic State supporter terrorist groups have emerged to stake a claim over parts of mainland Southeast Asia. While some arrests were made, some of them had fled to the Philippines to forged an alliance with Abu Sayyaf, which is one of the Filipino terrorist group notourious for kidnapping, beheading and extortion. Many of the terrorists fled from Malaysia are believed to be not a Malaysian citizens, but instead were either Filipino and Indonesian nationalities who have disguised as a Malaysians by using fake identities. Malaysia's first suicide bomber attack occurred under the auspices of ISIS (though in Iraq). In 2014, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz introduced the Expatriate Terrorist Act which would allow the federal government go to court to revoke the citizenship of those who joins or aids a foreign terrorist group. He cited his view that it was \\"necessary\\" to prevent citizens to fight for ISIS from returning to carry out \\"unspeakable acts of terror here at home.\\" In November 2014, the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 2178 which focused on how states should deal with the foreign fighter phenomenon. The Resolution presents a holistic approach to the problem and therefore stresses to not only focus on military and intelligence solutions, but incorporate preventative and rehabilitative measures as well. Furthermore, governments are encouraged to developed counter narratives together with communities and NGO's. Governments have adopted a wide range of policies and measures in order to deal with the issue of foreign fighters. Measures change per country, and focus for example on prevention, law enforcement or rehabilitation and reintegration. For example, informative hotlines have been set up as well as implementation of the deprivation of citizenship. With a focus on more preventative measures, countries have developed programs that focus on inter-cultural and inter-religious dialogue as well the use of counter-narratives. =Other= ;Personal In at least Suluk in Raqqa, ISIS was teaching their version of Sharia to Europeans and other foreigners at a house. Further, at least three fathers, two Belgians and a Russian, traveled to northern Syria to try and bring home their sons fighting for the opposition. Another former Belgian soldier successfully brought back his son from Syria. ;Analysis Western reactions have generally been of concern about returning Islamist foreign fighters. Former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton said: \\"The balance of power within the Syrian opposition between responsible forces and terrorists is already murky at best. If even more al Qaeda supporters are moving in, it raises the risks of supplying weapons even to 'friendly' opposition forces even higher.\\" Former CIA official and former staff member of the White House National Security Council Bruce Riedel added: \\"Syria is the new epicenter for the global jihad with would be 'martyrs' arriving from across the Islamic world to fight Assad. They are getting experience in the terror arts they will bring home.\\" Aaron Zelin of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy wrote that \\"not everyone who has joined the Syrian rebels is al Qaeda, and only a small number may ever become involved in terrorism after returning to Europe. That said, it would be wrong to conclude that individuals who have trained and fought in Syria pose no potential threat. Numerous studies show that individuals with foreign training and/or fighting experience have featured prominently in European based terrorist plots. [Other studies have shown that foreign-trained fighters] are far more lethal, dangerous and sophisticated than purely domestic cells.\\" because the returning fighters are more experienced and battle hardened than those in domestic cells. Having fought and survived the war, domestic cells would most likely look up to and follow the instructions of returning fighters when carrying out violent attacks. It might be more difficult to prevent a terrorist attack from a cell headed by a Foreign fighter that have knowledge in weapons handling, constructing explosives out of improvised goods and operational planning than a cell headed by a leader without this practical training. He suggested a recurrence of roving attackers that followed the Iraq war in the 2000s, the Bosnia war in the 1990s and the Afghanistan war in the 1980s. The Free Beacon suggested the growing number of foreign fighters was indicated by the release of videos such as one showing the execution of three Christians, including a Roman Catholic priest. Other such videos are the increasing number of \\"martyrdom announcements.\\" The New York Times suggested the influx of foreign Islamist fighters could make Syria a new haven for such fighters akin to Afghanistan, Pakistan and Yemen. The Norwegian Defence Research Establishment's Thomas Hegghammer estimated in November 2013 that between 1,132 and 1,707 Europeans from 12 such countries had gone to Syria to fight, with a majority from France (200‚Äì400), the United Kingdom (200‚Äì300) and Belgium (100‚Äì300). However, an ISIL deserter alleged that foreign recruits were treated with less respect than Arabic-speaking Muslims by ISIL commanders and were placed in suicide units if they lacked otherwise useful skills. In order to gain respect, foreign fighters may engage in far more violent actions than local fighters. Most local fighters are unwilling to terrorize their own relatives or neighbors and thus foreign fighters are deployed to violently control the locals. Turkey was said to be concerned about the presence of radical jihadists on their border with Syria. The Carnegie Middle East Center noted the \\"unprecedented\\" speed at which the numbers of fighters have mobilised in comparison to earlier modern conflicts in the Islamic world. Shahriman Lockman of the Malaysia-based Institute of Strategic & International Studies said of the return of fighters: \\"It is worrisome, yes. If they wanted a safe haven for their training and operations, they could easily go to the numerous failed states in Africa. But they chose to operate from Malaysia, where the risk of being under surveillance is much higher.\\" In his 28 May 2017 Face the Nation interview, US Secretary of Defense James Mattis announced a shift from \\"attrition\\" to \\"annihilation\\" tactics in the fight against ISIS; according to Mattis, the intention is \\"that the foreign fighters do not survive the fight to return home to North Africa, to Europe, to America, to Asia, to Africa.\\" Blowback Amidst concern of blowback, the first reported case of a former fighter in the conflict to attack those outside Syria occurred in May 2014 at the Jewish Museum of Belgium shooting. Though unconfirmed, ISIS reportedly claimed responsibility for the 2014 shootings at Parliament Hill, Ottawa.

Burry then went to London until 1976, working at Guy's Hospital and lecturing at London University. He could not get his views on the dangers of scrums and of potentially life-threatening injuries from poor scrum techniques accepted until he published them in the British Medical Journal. Later he was a member of the IRB's medical advisory committee, and oversaw medical services for the first Rugby World Cup in 1987. Burry was an associate professor of rheumatology at the Wellington Clinical School until 1987, then was professor of rehabilitation medicine at Melbourne University until he retired in 1991. He retired to Hanmer Springs in North Canterbury, where he conducted research for the ACC, and was a consultant on rheumatology and rehabilitative medicine until 2000. Burry died on 18 June 2013, in Hanmer Springs. Burry's son Mark is an architect, best known for his role as executive architect and researcher for the Sagrada Fam√≠lia.

Fergus, Michael and Jandosova, Janar, \\"Kazakhstan: Coming of Age,\\" Stacey International, 2003, page 216. It is commonly decorated with elaborate ornaments made from bird beaks, animal horns, hooves and feet. Although contemporary Kazakhs usually wear Western dress, the Turkic people wear more traditional clothing for holidays and special occasions. Waters, Bella \\"Kazakhstan in Pictures,\\" Twenty First Century Books; 2nd edition, 2007, page 37. Materials and production methods Traditional materials used in Kazakh clothing include cloth, skin, felt, and fur. Embroidery, fur, jewelry, and ornamentation may also be used for decoration. Imported materials such as silk, brocade, and velvet can also be used for clothing, but are more expensive than traditional materials. A Bactrian camel has its hair sheared for clothing. Traditional materials, such as horsehair, fox fur, sheep's wool and rabbit hides, are used in the production of clothing. Preparation of the materials includes skinning, drying, and greasing the hides with a mixture of sour milk and flour. After four days, the skins are washed and soaked in a concentrated brine. After more drying, the underside of the hide is scraped with a skinning knife before being heated; this gives the skin its whitish color. The fur is then ready for dyeing in a variety of colors. Yellow dye is made from the crushed root of the Taranovy plant. Red dye is made from the root of Uiran Boyau, and orange dye is often made from dried pomegranate crusts. Kazakhs often use white wool, and consider wool from the neck of a sheep valuable. The hair of the Bactrian camel is also used for more luxurious clothing. An undercoat, collected after the camel has molted, it is considered particularly valuable. Imported cotton, silk, and woolen fabrics were used by Kazakh nomads. The feudal nobility used imported fabrics to make their clothing; less-affluent Kazakhs wore more easily accessible materials, such as furs, leather, and homemade wool. Fabrics were home-spun on a primitive, horizontal loom. Women's clothing Women wear a shirt-like garment known as a koylek. Different fabrics are used, with more-expensive fabrics for festive wear and common fabrics for everyday use. The koylek is made by folding a piece of fabric in half and sewing the sides from the armpits to the bottom hem. A koylek usually worn by unmarried Kazakh girls is typically made from a light, soft fabric which accentuates the waist. Kunikey means \\"sun-like\\" in Kazakh, and the word is used to describe this type of clothing. Kazakh girls wear trousers made of sheepskin, homespun cloth, and heavy cotton fabrics. They may be short (shalbar) or long (dalbar). A kupe is a coat worn by women and men which is typically made of fox fur or, occasionally, goatskin. It is usually lined with camel or sheep wool and hemmed with otter fur on the sleeves for warmth during early spring and fall. A woman's kupe is distinguishable from a man's by its embroidered collar. Kazakh bride in traditional wedding dress A staple article of Kazakh clothing is the chapan or shapan, a long, loose robe. Hanks, Reuel R., \\"Central Asia: a global studies handbook,\\" ABC-CLIO, 2005, page 232. Unlike other clothing, it is not gender-specific and is worn by men and women. Chapans are made from various fabrics and are available in a range of colors (most often monochrome or dark). They are lined with a layer of wool or cotton. Festive velvet chapans are decorated with appliqu√©, brushing, and gold embroidery. This type of robe was worn by wealthy Kazakhs. A syrmaly is a hapan which is quilted and strengthened with denser fabric. A kaptal is a lined chapan, and a shabu is a chapan trimmed with fur. =Headgear= Headgear indicate a woman's relationship status. Unmarried girls wear a skullcap scarf and a warm, fur- edged cap. Wealthier girls' hats are made of bright velvet fabric and embroidered with golden thread. Bridal headgear of a bride is a saukele. These headdresses, often over a foot tall, are embedded with valuable ornaments such as pearls, coral, and pressed silver. Long suspension brackets, zhaktau, are fastened to the sides of the saukele and frame the bride's face. They sometimes reach the bride's waist. Less prosperous women make the saukele from cloth or satin and decorate it with glass beads; the zhaktau are added later. After the birth of her first child, a woman wears a hat made of white fabric (often for the rest of her life). The details of the hat vary by region to region. It has two parts; the bottom (kimeshka) is placed on the head and the top is twisted to form a turban. Men's clothing Traditional Kazakh men's clothing Men wear two types of skin shirts (without an undershirt), inner and outer trousers and loose-fitting robes made from various materials and belted with leather or cloth. During the 18th century, the top trousers (shalbar) were sewn from homespun camel hair fabric and skin. They had embroidered silk patterns in vegetable shapes, the ends often sheathed by an ornate band and lace and edged with fur. Jackets were sewn from monochrome dark (occasionally multicolored) fabrics. They had a cloth lining, often insulated with a thin layer of wool. Popular among young Kazakh men, the zhargak shapa is decorated with traditional patterns and worn on important occasions. A coat (ton) is often made of sheepskin, but may be made from the skin of raccoons (janat ishik) or silver foxes (kara tulki). Nobles often wear kok ton, fur coats made from blue cloth covered (and trimmed) with beaver skin. Tons are often made by sewing together tanned sheepskins with wool on the inside; more prosperous Kazakhs wear tons made from the wool of four- to five-month-old lambs. = Headgear = Kazakh hunters with eagles An aiyr kalpak is a pointed, upturned cap, usually worn by the upper class. The fabric cap is decorated with unique, ornamental patterns to indicate wealth, power and social status. A borik is a warm, round cap trimmed with otter, marten or raccoon fur, and a tymak is a fur hat which covers the ears. A kulapara is a hood worn by hunters, shepherds, and herdsmen which attaches to the coat collar. For camouflage, hunters wear differently colored kulapara in different seasons: white in winter, green in summer, and yellow in autumn. A takiya is a light, round hat decorated with patterns which include zoomorphic embroidery, flowers, and anima horns.

During a long career he undertook many urban renewal projects as well as major industrial and commercial works. A skilled artist, he published a series of sketch books of architecture in France and other Mediterranean countries. Biography =Birth and education= Albert Laprade was born in Buzan√ßais, Indre on 29 November 1883. He was the only son of a wholesale grocer and a seamstress from Ch√¢teauroux. He attended the Lyc√©e Jean-Giraudoux in Ch√¢teauroux, graduating in 1900. He then moved to Paris where his maternal uncle Ernest Cl√©ret, an architect and professor at the Gobelins Manufactory, encouraged him to study for admission to the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts. In 1905 he was admitted to the studio of Gaston Redon, and then studied under Albert Tournaire. He was a brilliant pupil and won many prizes. He obtained his diploma as an architect in 1907. =Early career= El Hank lighthouse, Casablanca, which Laprade and Prost designed in 1916. Villa Magdalena, B√©nodet, Brittany (1926-1928) Between 1910 and 1914 Laprade worked in the studio of Ren√© Sergent, an uncle by marriage, who designed townhouses and chateaux lavishly decorated in the Louis XV style. He also worked with Henri Prost. He was called up in 1914 with the outbreak of World War I (1914-1918). In 1915 he was wounded at Ypres and sent to Rouen to recover, but was unable to return to the field. Prost arranged for him to become his assistant in Morocco. Laprade worked under Prost in the town planning division, and was given the tasks of redesigning the great central park in Casablanca, and then planning a new indigenous town. Laprade first made many drawings of local architectural motifs in an effort to understand the interaction of stylistic elements with social functions. His goal was to develop an elegant urban architecture based on modern technology that would be appropriate to the stylistic tastes and way of life of the Moroccan people. His new Madina in Casablanca was separate from the French quarters and very different in design. Laprade followed Moroccan traditions in the division between interior courtyards and the street. His new quarter, in neo-Moorish style using modern materials, technology and sanitary principles, included pedestrian walkways, courtyard houses, markets, communal ovens, mosques, schools and public baths. In 1917 Laprade went to Rabat where he assisted with the General Residence and its gardens, the military and diplomatic cabinet, a park and sports ground, and the Marshal's residence. In this last he incorporated concepts from local architecture, ensuring harmony with the surrounding buildings. Auguste Cadet and Edmond Brion undertook the madina construction project in Casablanca, which started in 1919 and continued for many years. Laprade met many of his future private clients while in Morocco. His sketches of local gardens and houses were later used to illustrate Jean Galotti's Les Jardins et les maisons arabes au Maroc (1926). Laprade returned to France in 1920. That year he rebuilt the Ch√¢teau de Gerb√©viller, which had been damaged by bombing, for Charles de Lambertye-Gerb√©viller. Laprade created the Jardins des Nympheas and Jardins des Oiseaux for the 1925 International Exposition of Modern Industrial and Decorative Arts in Paris. In an interview he said that he had a love of flowers embedded in architecture, whether it was brick, stone or even concrete. His Art Deco parterres were laid out in geometrical patterns, with monochromatic masses of plants and alternating beds of flowers in pastel colors. In 1925 he formed a partnership with L√©on Bazin that lasted until 1936. Laprade was a founding member of the Society of Modern Artists (1925) and of the International Union of Architects. =1930s= Fa√ßade of the Voix du Nord building in Lille (1936), following the local tradition of crow-stepped gables. For the 1931 Paris Colonial Exposition Laprade collaborated with L√©on Jaussely in building the permanent Palace of the Colonies, the Palais de la Porte Dor√©e. The sculptor Alfred Janniot decorated the facade. Laprade saw his challenge as being \\"to evoke far off countries while remaining in harmony with the atmosphere of Paris.\\" His solution was a \\"simple, noble, very calm, very neutral\\" building, covered with \\"a great tapestry of stone in warm tonalities ... a tapestry sheltered by a sort of light canopy, evoking the countries of the sun in a neutral and modern note.\\" Jacques-√âmile Ruhlmann furnished the Salon d'Afrique at one end of the main facade, and Eug√®ne Printz furnished the Salon de l'Asie at the other end. Louis Bouquet painted the frescoes in one of the rooms. Bouquet created a painting named Souvenir du Mus√©e des Colonies that depicts the men who worked on the pavilion: Laprade and Bazin, Janniot, Bouquet and Ruhlmann. The painting also includes an anonymous black woman wearing only a skirt, resembling Josephine Baker, who represents the indigenous colonial people. Laprade and Robert Fournez were the architects for the exhibition's Morocco pavilion, which evoked the palaces of Fez and Marrakesh. The interior held a labyrinth of small rooms with different exhibits, leading to a long narrow garden with souqs on each side where visitors could buy Moroccan handicrafts at the stalls. The novelist Pierre Mille wrote of the pavilion, \\"Morocco: here the building is more than a copy: a hybridization of styles recently created by our architects and of the Moroccan style.\\" Laprade was chief architect of Civilian Buildings and National Palaces (BCPN) from 1932 to 1960. In 1932 he was appointed General Inspector of Art Education. He defined reforms to education in the 1930s and 1940s in which he emphasized the critical importance of teaching drawing skills in secondary schools, since this was an essential tool for both artists and craftsmen. Industrial progress depended on new designs, and designers needed drawing skills. Laprade was part of the editorial board, and one of the contributors of the avant garde urban planning magazines Plans (1930-1932), then Prelude (1932-1936), with Hubert Lagardelle, Pierre Winter, Charles Trochu, Philippe Lamour, Fran√ßois de Pierrefeu, Le Corbusier and Marcel Martiny. L√©on Bazin left Leprade in 1936 to form his own agency. Laprade was then associated with B. Philippe and J. Vernon until 1947, and then with Claude Barr√© until his death in 1978. Laprade and Bazin designed the Peace Monument in the Place du Trocadero for the 1937 Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne. They also collaborated on the pavilion for diffusion of the French language and the pavilion and garden of Iraq Edmond Labb√©, who was responsible for the exhibition, deliberately emphasized regionalism. Laprade, as a socialist, had mixed views about the result. He said it was, =Later career= Paris, 4th arrondissement, quai Henri IV, seen from the quai Saint-Bernard, in 1981. The 14-story building to the rear in the right of the picture is the Prefecture. After the 1930s Laprade began to undertake fewer private commissions and became more interested in urban planning and restoration. He spent the years of World War II (1939-1945) organizing his notes and drawings from his travels, from which his famous albums would be drawn. Laprade was inspector General of Beaux-Arts from 1943 to 1952. After the war Laprade was appointed Chief Architect of the Ministry of Reconstruction and Development (North). From 1944 to 1949 Laprade was in charge of protecting and improving area of the 4th arrondissement of Paris around the √âglise Saint-Gervais. Laprade's grave at the P√®re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris. Laprade was architect for the reconstruction of the old towns of Le Mans and Alen√ßon. In 1959 he attended the first international congress on restoration of historic towns and was surprised to find that exemplary work was being done by socialist states. It was not until 1962 that the concept of protected areas found its way into French legislature. From 1950 to 1962 he was consulting architect to the Schneider Electric facilities at Le Creusot. From 1945 to 1965 he was a member of the Committee on Parisian sites. From 1955 to 1970 he was responsible for supervision of the banks of the Seine with Claude Charpentier. Albert Laprade was made a Commander of the Legion of Honour. In 1963 he was elected a member of the Royal Academy of Belgium. Albert Laprade died in Paris on 9 May 1978. Works Villa Magdalena, today the H√¥tel le Minare, B√©nodet, Brittany (1926-1928) G√©nissiat dam on the Rh√¥ne (1939-1950) Renault factories on Seguin island at Boulogne-Billancourt (1944-1951) Laprade's work reflected many of the changes in 20th-century architecture during his long career, but he always remained true to the principles of aesthetics, balance and proportion. He and other architects of his time struggled with the challenge of building modern structures in Paris without destroying the harmony of the city's architecture. In 1931 he created a series of photomontages that illustrated the problem, showing skyscrapers emerging from among 19th-century buildings. Laprade also had to deal with the issue of how much the French should adapt to indigenous styles in the colonies. In 1928 Laprade described the new architectural style that was emerging in Morocco as a \\"synthesis of our Latin spirit and love for autochthonous art\\". Laprade saw the architect's goal as integrating \\"values of ambience\\" with a \\"whole way of life\\". He thought that architecture was alive, and \\"should express a sentiment.\\" Laprade believed in variety and complexity of the urban environment rather than uniformity, and was opposed to vandalism in the name of development of old quarters. He followed both traditional and modern styles. In some of his urban development work such as in Gournay-en- Bray (1942) and the old center of Le Mans he used a picturesque style. He used modern designs for commercial and industrial projects, which included the Citr√∂en garage, rue Marbeuf (1928), G√©nissiat dam on the Rh√¥ne (1939-1950), Roselend dam at La B√¢thie (1954-1961) and the development of the Renault factories on Seguin island at Boulogne-Billancourt (1944-1951).

Oxford English Dictionary, Oxford University Press, 2013 Bankrupts were defined as insolvent persons engaged in trade or business and kept distinct from other insolvents until 1861. The proceedings of that administration were the distribution of the property of an insolvent person to that person's creditors in proportion to the debts.

Rajesh, and produced by Ved Kataria and Renu Kataria. The film stars Deepak Dobriyal, Anshul Kataria and Priya Bathija. It was released on 2 August 2013. Storyline Small time theft and robbery is the central theme of this drama set in Delhi. Shukla (Avtar Sahni) runs a photo studio, which in reality is an undercover agency employing a collection of young petty thieves who work the streets committing petty crime. The story revolves around Satbir (Deepak Dobriyal), one of the young thieves who wants to get out of the life of crime and become a good citizen. In his attempts to find normal employment, he stumbles across a young attractive woman Neena (Priya Bathija), whom he then attempts to court. When his friends from the agency notice his new love interest, they steal Neena's purse in the mall where Satbir is now working. Satbir gets the purse back and returns it to Neena the next time they meet. When Neena discovers that Satbir knows some petty thieves personally, she is very curious to meet some. She promises Satbir to spend the day with him on the streets of Delhi, if he can show her some of the action. Satbir thinks about the offer, but has misgivings about the idea of letting an outsider onto the inner workings of the petty crime scene. However, the temptation of Neena's company is too strong to resist, and he agrees. But Satbir does not know that Neena works at the local TV station as an investigative reporter. Neena then disappears and Satbir next sees her on the local TV channel in an ad announcing next week's investigative report on street crime in Delhi. Much to his horror, the ad also features Satbir himself, who has been secretly recorded all day as he goes about town showing Neena various incidents of petty crime taking place. Satbir now realizes that he has been set-up by Neena and as a result of his folly, all of his friends are going to be exposed to the public on TV. As a result, Satbir has to go into hiding, but he is soon caught by Shukla and brought to the studio, where he explains his innocence. While he is forgiven for his folly, that does not really help the cause of the gang, who now face public humiliation and likely arrest. Satbir vows to Shukla that 'no matter what, the TV episode will not air next week.' Things, however, look grim for the small street gang trying to take down a nationally advertised ready-to-run episode off the air with only a week to go. But Satbir has an inspiration, that leads to a plan which revolves around creating doubt in the TV station manager's mind about the authenticity of Neena's recordings. To make the plan work, the gang first break into the TV station and steal a copy of the recording that is going to be aired. They then cut each of the several incidents of street theft in the recording and repackage them as part of a false reality TV show called \\"Chor, Chor, Super Chor\\". After each incident, the gang (masquerading as a TV crew) is now shown going to the home of the victim and returning the stolen items along with a \\"surprise you are on TV\\" ending. So what was originally footage of several incidents of petty street theft, now resembles a series of episodes of a reality TV show where the \\"supposed\\" petty theft is followed by a visit to the victim and a happy ending. To make this work more effectively, the gang tracks down the manager of the TV station and robs him off his car on the street in an elaborately planned scam. Recording the event on camera all this time, they then show up outside the TV station later in the day, pretending to be a TV crew. They then proceed to return the car to the TV manager as he finally arrives to work after his long frustrating day on the streets of Delhi. Initially, the manager is upset and confused, more so since he has never heard of the reality show \\"Chor, Chor, Super Chor\\". The crew explain that they are new on the scene and are in fact looking for a station that would want to air the show. The manager, unaware that the crew are actual petty criminals in real life, is impressed with their performance. He invites Satbir and the crew inside. Once in his office, the crew is able to convince him that Neena is a fraud and her entire episode on street crime was supposedly their own film work which she must have stolen from them. She is accused of having cut-up their work and then passed it off to the station manager as real investigative reporting. The manager is initially skeptical of their claim, but is convinced in the end since he himself has just been the victim of the supposed show's prank. He now decides to abort the airing of the report. The manager now fires Neena and hires the crew and their reality show instead. The show becomes a big hit across Delhi. In a bizarre and ironic twist, petty crime, instead of going down as Neena hoped, goes up across the city as people on the street become openly receptive to being robbed of their possessions, hoping the person robbing them is perhaps part of the TV show and will show up at their door later on with a prize and a chance to be on national TV.

Guiteau, the assassin of U.S. President James A. Garfield. He wrote it on June 30, 1882, the morning of his execution. He read it at the gallows. \\"I am Going to the Lordy\\" was used as a base for the song \\"The Ballad of Guiteau\\" in the Stephen Sondheim musical Assassins, where Guiteau sings a version of the song while cakewalking up and down the scaffold.  Reading  On 30 June 1882, the day of the execution of Guiteau for the assassination of President James Garfield, Guiteau announced, after famously dancing his way to the gallows, that he would read a poem that he had written. Guiteau said that he had written the poem, which was entitled \\"I am Going to the Lordy\\", at about 10:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time that day. After \\"stubbing his toe on the way to the gallows\\", as he put it to the executioner, Guiteau read and announced that he would now read a prayer of his own composition. After paraphrasing , Guiteau proceeded to read the poem from a piece of paper in a style described as both \\"sad and doleful\\" as well as \\"high pitched\\" and \\"childlike\\". Guiteau had requested an orchestra to play behind him as he recited his poem, but his request was denied. After completing the first verse in song, Guiteau stopped singing and chanted the rest. Multiple times during the reading, Guiteau's voice would fail and he would begin sobbing, even stopping to lay his head on the shoulder of a man standing by him. Right before the completion of the poem, Guiteau raised his voice even higher into falsetto to deliver the final two lines. As the executioner fitted the hood over Guiteau's head and put the rope around his neck, he held onto the piece of paper on which he had written his poem. As per request with the executioner, Guiteau signaled that he was ready to die by dropping the paper. It was a long-held belief that Guiteau himself wrote the folk song \\"Charles Guiteau\\". It is theorized that the song resulted from the truth that Guiteau wrote \\"I am Going to the Lordy\\" and was believed because of the way it was written. Text Before reciting his poem, Guiteau stated, \\"I am now going to read some verses which are intended to indicate my feelings at the moment of leaving this world. If set to music they may be rendered very effective. The idea is that of a child babbling to his mamma and his papa. I wrote it this morning about ten o'clock.\\" The poem is repetitive, containing numerous Hallelujahs and other glories to God. In it, Guiteau describes himself as the savior of both his \\"party\\" and his \\"land,\\" but laments that his country has murdered him for it.  Reception and commentary  Many of Guiteau's contemporaries believed that he was seriously deranged, and \\"I am Going to the Lordy\\" helped exemplify their point. Combined with his behavior at the trial, which included frequent profanity and insults towards nearly everyone in the court, writing epic poems as his testimony, and soliciting legal advice from spectators via passed notes, the poem convinced many spectators that Guiteau was insane. \\"I am Going to the Lordy\\" was marked as \\"pathetic\\", and the entire event was labeled as \\"obvious imbecility.\\" The people who came out to watch the execution \\"shout[ed], hoot[ed], curs[ed], and boo[ed]\\" as Guiteau came up on stage and recited his poem.  In the musical Assassins  \\"I am Going to the Lordy\\" is a featured part of the Stephen Sondheim musical Assassins. In the song \\"The Ballad of Guiteau\\", Guiteau sings an exaggerated version of the poem more and more fervently while the Balladeer sings about Guiteau's life, trial, and execution. Sondheim has said that the use of the poem in the song was one of two times he had ever borrowed from another writer in his work, the other being the time he used lines from William Shakespeare in the song \\"Fear No More\\" from The Frogs. Sondheim first learned of the poem from the short story by Charles Gilbert on which Assassins is based. He was going to include pieces of letters and diaries written by Guiteau as well, but felt that those would \\"weigh the piece down.\\" The contrast of the \\"fervent yet hymn-like poem\\" and the styles of music in the song continue to suggest the insanity of Guiteau, a trait exemplified frequently in the musical. After Guiteau sings his poem unaccompanied and quietly, the Balladeer sings a verse, which is followed by Guiteau cakewalking up and down the scaffold and singing about looking on the bright side. He stops a step or two higher and begins singing the hymn again. After the third verse, Guiteau begins cakewalking when he reaches the noose and stops suddenly. He then begins singing his poem again, although this time much more forcefully and resolutely before the Balladeer interrupts and leads Guiteau to his death. Jim Lovensheimer implies that the use of the cakewalk interjected in the ballad show Guiteau looking for a prize, as the best cakewalker on a plantation would be awarded a prize. The lyrics of \\"The Ballad of Guiteau\\", including the parts taken from \\"I am Going to the Lordy\\", help to show Guiteau as a devoted but misguided Christian who \\"lost a grip on reality.\\" Howard Kissel said that \\"The Ballad of Guiteau\\" was one of the oddest songs of Assassins due to the use of the poem.

After 1323/1324, when it was recorded for the first time, it belonged to the Kingdom of Serbia, Serbian Empire, Moravian Serbia, Serbian Despotate and Ottoman Empire. In 1451 the Ottomans razed it to the ground.  Location  Ostrvica was the main castle in the Rudnik area. It is assumed that its location protected the mines of Rudnik from the north, while another castle (of Pavle Orloviƒá) provided protection from the south. The two castles maintained visual communication by signals.  History  During the 14th and 15th centuries the people of the region and merchants from Dubrovnik used Ostrovica castle as a haven during wars, first in 1323‚Äì1324 during the war between Stefan Deƒçanski and Stephen Vladislav. In 1398 Nikola Zojiƒá , a governor of Ostrovica, retreated to Ostrvica after the failure of his attempt to overthrow Stefan Lazareviƒá and to establish direct vassalage to the Ottoman Empire. Zojiƒá took monastic vows to avoid the death penalty. In 1414 voivode Mazarek is mentioned as a governor of Ostrvica and Rudnik. Ostrvica was captured by the Ottomans several times, first in 1431 and again in 1438. The Serbian despot recaptured it in 1443 during the Crusade of Varna, but the Ottomans captured it again in 1444, only to be restored to Serbia later in the year. Brankoviƒá and Eirene used Ostrovica as their summer retreat, and had a mint in the castle. When the Ottomans captured Ostrvica in 1451 they razed it to the ground. This was against the order of Murad II. Evliya √áelebi described Ostrovica as the \\"town of Rudnik\\". He explained that it was founded by the Serbian King Milo≈°, captured by Ottomans, recaptured by Christians to be captured again by the Ottomans on 19 May 1521.

Academic work Neal Roese has published scholarly articles on topics including memory biases, emotion, and legal decision making. He is the author of the 2005 book, If Only, which focused on the experience of regret in daily life. According to WorldCat, the book is held in 289 librariesWorldCat item record He edited, with James M. Olson, the 1995 book What might have been: The social psychology of counterfactual thinking. ( Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum). According to WorldCat, the book is held in 423 librariesWorldCat item record His work has been profiled in such outlets as Business Insider, CBS News, NPR, New York Times, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune, and the Harvard Business Review. His research on Counterfactual thinking has shown that counterfactual thoughts and regret can be beneficial in that they feed into learning from experience. Certain kinds of counterfactuals and regrets connect specifically to distinct motivational states, such as orientations toward either promotion or prevention. His research on regret has covered several topics, ranging from decision consequences of regret to the mental health implications of major life regrets. In the latter case, his research on life regrets show that when adults look back on their lives, they are most likely to regret facets of love and work, i.e., personal relationships and career accomplishment. He also was contributed to the theoretical understanding of \\"hindsight bias,\\" defined as the tendency to see the past as more predictable than it was in foresight. As such, hindsight bias is a potent and widely studied cognitive trap for many decision makers. In 2012, he published a comprehensive review and theoretical reformulation of the scholarly literature on hindsight bias, spanning the disciplines of psychology, law, medicine, economics, political science, and history. In earlier research, he showed that cognitive processes that serve to explain, clarify, and elaborate on events contribute to hindsight bias. In fact, visualization tools that help to manage big data sets may paradoxically increase hindsight bias by contributing to an illusion of clarity.

Life Born at Vesington, Co. Meath in Ireland, he was educated at Trinity College, Dublin. He associate of people of rank on a continental tour. With Lord Westmeath he leased the Music Hall in Fishamble Street, Dublin, and opened it, 6 March 1793, with productions of Beggar's Opera and The Irish Girl, with amateur casts. He himself played Sir Lucius O'Trigger in The Rivals‚Äîthere is no evidence that he himself was a professional actor. In 1794 Jones obtained permission to open a theatre for seven years in Dublin, and to hire female but not male performers. He was, however, prohibited from taking money at the doors. His aristocratic patrons asked him to apply in 1796 to the Earl of Camden for a patent for a theatre. In the end he leased quite expensively Crow Street Theatre from the manager Richard Daly. Supported by Lord Westmeath, Jones spent heavily on the house, with the interior decorated by Gaetano MarinariDictionary of Irish Architects 1740‚Äì1920, Marinari, Gaetano. and Zaffarini. The new house was opened, but after a few weeks was closed in after the proclamation of martial law and the Irish Rebellion of 1798. Two years later a new patent was granted to Jones, who brought in Thomas Ludford Bellamy as stage manager. He spent further sums, but had again, for political reasons, to close in 1803. In 1807 Richard Brinsley Sheridan invited Jones to purchase a share in the Drury Lane Theatre, and to manage the house on a salary and percentage of profits: the scheme was defeated by the fire that burned down Drury Lane, 24 February 1809. Jones sold in 1808 shares in the Crow Street Theatre to John Crampton and Edward Tuite Dalton. Crampton undertook the management, but fared badly, and Jones had to resume the reins within six months. He once more withdrew from the management in 1814: a series of disturbances had culminated in a riot, in which the theatre was wrecked, and Jones laid the blame on the Tory government. After Jones resumed management, further riots occurred in 1819. Intrigue against him proved successful, he was unable to renew the patent were refused, and it was granted to Thomas Harris of Covent Garden Theatre. Jones lost a large sum of money, and was imprisoned for debt. He died in retirement in 1834. A patent for a second theatre in Dublin was granted in 1829 to his sons, Richard Talbot Jones and Charles Horatio Jones. Jones was known as \\"Buck Jones\\". A member of Daly's, the most aristocratic club in Ireland, he lived in style in a house in Fortick's Grove, rechristened by its old name Clonliffe House. Familiar Epistles to Frederick Jones, Esq., on the present State of the Irish Stage, Dublin, 1804, which was attributed to John Wilson Croker, criticised some of Jones's actors, but had less to say about him.

A failed actor, he works in Los Angeles as a limo driver. Though he has quit gambling, he retains a $6000 debt to Ignacio, who demands the debt be paid by midnight. At the same time, Stretch begins hallucinating the bitter ghost of another failed actor and limo driver named Karl, who committed suicide in front of a customer. His boss, Naseem, calls him to his office and tells him that their chief competitor, a mysterious man known only as The Jovi, has been stealing their clients. Unless they can steal clients away from The Jovi, Naseem will be forced to fold his business. Although unsure how he will keep his job or pay back his debts, Stretch takes time to set up a blind date with a woman from an online dating site. At the same time, he begs Charlie, a sympathetic employee, to direct any high-paying customers his way. When The Jovi steals his first client, actor David Hasselhoff, Charlie sends Stretch to intercept one of The Jovi's clients, Ray Liotta. Liotta tasks Stretch with returning a pistol and prop badge. Before he can do so, Charlie sends him another client, Roger Karos, an eccentric millionaire with a reputation for extremist hedonism. Karos parachutes down naked to the arranged location and offers to pay Stretch's gambling debt if he serves without question. As Stretch drives Karos to exclusive nightclubs and hotspots of dubious legality, Karl berates him for putting himself at increasing risk, both personally and legally, for such a small sum of money. Karos' final destination is a secretive sex club. Karos gives Stretch 100 minutes to return to the sex club with an important briefcase and a supply of cocaine. When Stretch attempts to retrieve the briefcase, he learns from Laurent, a French blackmailer, that Karos has promised to trade a ledger for the contents of the briefcase. Using Liotta's props, Stretch cons Laurent and his men into believing that he is a police officer, and they surrender the briefcase. As he leaves the nightclub, he sees Candace and nonchalantly insinuates that he is both successful and important now. When Candace expresses interest in him, he turns her down. Unimpressed, Karl continues to harangue him for his inadequacies. Stretch procures the cocaine from a reality television star, who then steals the limo. Meanwhile, Liotta complains to Naseem, who fires Stretch. Undeterred, Stretch reacquires the limo, which has been trashed, only to lose it to The Jovi's brother, Boris, who operates a tow truck. Stretch once again retrieves the limo, though it has been reported as stolen. Stretch fast talks the security system operator into believing that he is a cop whose life is on the line during a gunfight. Upon returning, Karos complains that Stretch is a minute late. When Ignacio also complains that he is late in his payment, Stretch instructs Ignacio to meet him at Karos' destination. There, Karos abandons Stretch to The Jovi and Boris, though Ignacio intercedes. Laurent, revealed to be an FBI agent, also appears and arrests Karos, who is wanted for embezzlement. As Karos prepares to kill Laurent in a sneak attack, Stretch creates a diversion, saves Laurent's life, and escapes. Later, at a diner, Stretch gives the ledger to Laurent, who declines to arrest him and compliments his acting skills. As Stretch looks around the diner, he realizes that he has ended up at the meeting point he set up with his blind date. He is surprised to find that the woman is there; when she is revealed to be Charlie, the two laugh and kiss.

Release  The film was originally set to be theatrically released in the United States on March 21, 2014. On January 21, 2014, the film's March release was scrapped by Universal Pictures, in what The Hollywood Reporter called \\"an apparently unprecedented move.\\" The film's producer, Jason Blum, was unable to interest other distributors in the film, so it reverted to Universal Pictures, who were unwilling to spend the $20‚Äì40 million it would take to promote and release the film theatrically. On September 25, the first official trailer was released. The film was released on iTunes and Amazon.com on October 7, 2014, before being released via VOD on October 14, 2014. To coincide with the film's on- demand release, the filmmakers released a behind-the-scenes video showing the two leads Wilson and Decker going through the mechanics of filming a sex scene in the movie. This release received media attention. Reception Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 88% of 16 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 6.55/10. Jordan Hoffman of The Guardian wrote, \\"While the movie does eventually ramp up to a terrific purr, it hits plenty of speed bumps in its opening. There's a significant settling-in period (and some may just be unable to get on board at all), but it does settle in once the 'one night' begins.\\" Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of The A.V. Club rated it B‚àí and called it \\"puerile, demented, and often funny\\". Drew Taylor of Indiewire rated it B+ and called it a potential cult film if it can reach an adventurous audience. Cliff Wheatley of IGN rated it 8.9/10 and called it \\"a snowball of carnage and comedy\\". Scott Tobias of The Dissolve called it \\"an obnoxious cartoon version of Hollywood noir\\" that \\"confuses confidence and bravado for wit and fun\\".

Starring Ratna Asmara and Ali Joego, it follows a woman who moves to Jakarta to find work after her husband is blinded in an accident. SPFC's first production, Djaoeh Dimata took two to three months to film and cost almost 130,000 gulden. The first domestically produced feature film to be released in five years, Djaoeh Dimata received favourable reviews, although financially it was outperformed by Roestam Sutan Palindih's Air Mata Mengalir di Tjitarum (released soon after). The film's cast remained active in the Indonesian film industry, some for another 30 years, and SPFC produced six more works before closing in 1949. A copy of the film is stored at Sinematek Indonesia. Plot Ratna Asmara, Ali Joego, and Iscandar Sukarno in a scene from the film A poor villager, Asrad (Ali Joego), is blinded following a traffic accident and thus unable to work. As a result, his wife Soelastri (Ratna Asmara) travels to the capital, Jakarta, to find a job. As Asrad does not trust his wife and fears she may be unfaithful, he writes her a letter telling her not to return. Soelastri becomes a singer, and ‚Äì unknown to Asrad ‚Äì soon achieves wide acclaim. Her most popular song, \\"Djaoeh Dimata\\", receives heavy airplay on the radio and soon becomes one of Asrad's favourites. Ultimately Soelastri is brought home by Soekarto (Iskandar Sucarno), who attempts to pass her off as a maid for Asrad. When Asrad recognises his wife's voice, they are reconciled.; Background The first two years of the 1940s saw a growth in the cinema of the Dutch East Indies, with over forty domestic productions released. Following the Japanese occupation in February 1942, production slowed greatly and nearly all film studios were closed. The last studio, the ethnic Chinese- owned Multi Film, was confiscated by the Japanese to establish the film production company Nippon Eigasha in Jakarta, the colony's capital. This included Multi Film's equipment, with which Nippon Eigasha produced one feature film ‚Äì Rd Ariffien's Berdjoang (Struggle; 1943) ‚Äì six short films, and several newsreels. All were pro-Japanese propaganda. After the Japanese surrender in August 1945, a number of native Indonesian employees of Nippon Eigasha formed Berita Film Indonesia, which first made use of the studios. This company was allied with the newly proclaimed Indonesian government. During the ensuing revolution, allied Dutch and British forces occupied Jakarta in November 1945. The Dutch took over the studio, and production of newsreels at Multi Film's studios began in 1947 under the banner Regerings Film Bedrijf. The following year the Dutch established a subsidiary company to produce fictional films. This new company, the South Pacific Film Corporation (SPFC), was subsidised in part by the Netherlands Indies Civil Administration, a continuation of the former Dutch colonial government of the Indies. Production SPFC hired Andjar Asmara, a former journalist and stagewriter who had been active with The Teng Chun's Java Industrial Film before the Japanese occupation, to direct Djaoeh Dimata; he based the screenplay on his stageplay of the same name. However, as with his pre-war ventures, the native Indonesian Andjar was more of an acting and dialogue coach; the Dutch cinematographer, A.A. Denninghoff-Stelling, held more creative power over the final product. Max Tera served as assistant cinematographer on this black-and- white film. The film starred Ratna Asmara (wife of Andjar), Ali Yugo, Iskandar Sucarno, and Djauhari Effendi, all of whom had previous theatrical experience. Ratna and Ali, together with Andjar, had been members of the travelling troupe Dardanella in the early 1930s and entered the film industry together in 1940 with Kartinah.; Iskandar and Djauhari, meanwhile, had been active in the theatre during the occupation; both made their feature film debuts with Djaoeh Dimata.; ; Principal photography was conducted on sets constructed by artistic director Hajopan Bajo Angin in SFPC's studio in Jakarta. The company's equipment was of good quality, but conditions were detrimental to filming; a contemporary report notes that one take, done inside the studio, was ruined by the sound of a passing car. Filming, which took two to three months, was completed on 10 November 1948. Production costs were almost 130,000 gulden, which was partially obtained from ethnic Chinese backers.; The film included multiple songs, including Gesang Martohartono's 1940 hit \\"Bengawan Solo\\". A documentary detailing one day of the production, called Er wordt een film gemaakt (\\"A film is being made\\") exists in the Netherlands. Release and reception Djaoeh Dimata was released in late 1948, the first domestic feature film since Berdjoang. Despite this five-year gap, film critic Usmar Ismail writes that it did not stray from the formula which had been proven before the war, one which Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran notes focused on songs, beautiful scenery and romance. Roestam Sutan Palindih's Air Mata Mengalir di Tjitarum (Tears Flow in Citarum), which had similar themes, was released shortly after Djaoeh Dimata by the rival Tan & Wong Bros.; it proved the greater financial success. Only three domestic productions were released in 1948; the last was another SPFC production, entitled Anggrek Bulan (Moon Orchid), which was also directed by Andjar. Reviews of the film, which was rated for all ages, were mixed. One in the Jakarta-based Het Dagblad found the film to have many (unspecified) weak moments as well as strong ones. It particularly praised Ali's acting as a blind man, as well as Denninghoff-Stelling's camerawork. Another reviewer, in the magazine Mestika, described Ratna as an \\"unprecedented tragedienne\\" capable of making viewers cry \\"unrestrained tears of emotion\\".Quoted in After Djaoeh Dimata was released in Singapore in June 1949, a reviewer for The Straits Times praised the film's \\"fine photography and almost perfect sound\\". Andjar directed two further films for South Pacific, Anggrek Bulan and Gadis Desa (Maiden from the Village; 1949). Ratna had no further acting roles, although in 1950 she became Indonesia's first female director with Sedap Malam (Sweetness of the Night), for Djamaluddin Malik's company Persari. Ali, Iskandar, and Djauhari remained active as actors, Ali and Iskandar through the 1960s and Djauhari until the 1970s.; ; SPFC made another six films before shutting down at the end of the Indonesian National Revolution in 1949. A 35 mm copy of Djaoeh Dimata is stored at Sinematek Indonesia in Jakarta.

Procedural history =House= The Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2014 () was introduced on May 28, 2013 by the United States House Committee on Appropriations Chairman Rep. John Carter (R-TX). It was reported alongside House Report 113-90. This 94-page report includes an explanatory summary, minority views from several members, and a variety of charts comparing budget requests with the proposed FY 2014 funding. On May 28, 2013, the bill was placed on the Union Calendar, calendar 63. On June 4, 2013, the House resolved itself in the Committee of the Whole to debate the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2014 with Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL) as the designated chairman. The Committee of the Whole debated the bill and various amendments until 8:06pm on June 4 when the bill passed in Roll Call 193 with a vote of 421-4. =Senate= The Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2014 was received in the United States Senate on June 6, 2013 and then referred to the United States Senate Committee on Appropriations. =Presidential response= On June 3, 2013, President of the United States Barack Obama and his Administration released a statement on H.R. 2216. The President's statement expressed the hope that some changes could be made to the bill. One change the President would like to see made to the bill is the addition of a 1% pay increase for all Federal civilian employees. Another criticism was that the Administration \\"strongly opposes section 413\\", a section which would prohibit the executive branch from using any of the appropriated funds to \\"construct, renovate, or expand any facility in the United States to house individuals held in the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay.\\" The Administration argues that this is too strong of a constrain on their power. The statement included the announcement that \\"the President‚Äôs senior advisors would recommend that he veto H.R. 2216\\" unless various changes were made. The same veto threat was issued about the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2014 in a push by the President to force action about the 2014 United States federal budget. Despite this veto threat, the House passed the bill 421-4 the next day. Debate and discussion According to the watchdog website, Washingtonwatch.com, if passed this bill would cost $1,481.10 per average family. According to the National Coalition for Homeless Veterans, the bill would fund programs in the Department of Veterans Affairs designed to combat homelessness among veterans at the highest level in history.

The series consists of The Trees (1940), The Fields (1946), and The Town (1950); the third novel won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1951. These works established Richter as a major novelist of historical fiction. The Awakening Land trilogy was first issued in a single hardcover volume in September 1966, by Alfred A. Knopf. The trilogy was adapted as a United States TV miniseries by the same name, produced in 1978. The three novels were reissued in paperback in 1991 by Ohio University Press, and also in 2017 by Chicago Review Press.  Plot summaries  The Trees (1940) introduces the Luckett family, who emigrate from Pennsylvania to the Ohio Valley wilderness about 1795, after the American Revolutionary War and the founding of the United States of America. Told mostly from the point of view of the eldest daughter, Sayward, the novel explores how the family carves a homestead from the forest, suffering losses and hardships along the way. The Fields (1946) follows Sayward in her marriage to Portius Wheeler, a pioneer from the East. They raise a family of nine children together, although Portius also fathers a daughter, Rosa Tench, by another woman. The family and community continue to clear more trees in order to expand their area for farming and to make way for new dwellings. The Wheeler homestead becomes the nucleus of a settlement called Moonshine Church. The Town (1950) continues the story of Sayward‚Äôs family. She witnesses the transformation of the settlement into a modern industrialized town called Americus. Her family moves into a refined, large house in town. Many of the chapters in The Town are told from the point of view of Sayward‚Äôs youngest son, Chancey, who becomes a journalist and represents the rising post-frontier town and city generation of the 19th century.  Writing style  Richter extensively researched the mode of speech of the early-19th-century pioneers of the Ohio Valley, many of whom originally emigrated from Pennsylvania and the Upper South. (For example, they referred to ‚Äútrees‚Äù as ‚Äúbutts.‚Äù) In order to convey in writing an historic sense of the dialect, Richter studied rare collections of old manuscripts, letters, and records which demonstrated or documented the speech of late-18th- and early-19th-century residents. His sources included Henry Howe's Historical Collections of Ohio and Pioneer Pennsylvania, a compilation of archaic Pennsylvanian slang by Henry W. Shoemaker. Richter also interviewed scholars and former neighbors of pioneer heritage whom he had known in his home state of Pennsylvania and in the Ohio Valley.Esperson, Emma, \\"Biography of Conrad Richter\\", Pennsylvania Center for the Book, Pennsylvania State University, Fall 2011Richter, Conrad, The Awakening Land (1966), p. VII (Foreword) Richter wrote that this early form of spoken language no longer survived in the Ohio Valley. He learned that it was found in some areas of the South and Southwestern areas of the country. He noted that, although it is often mistaken for a \\"native\\" form of speech there, it should be considered ‚Äúa living reminder of the great mother tongue of early America.‚Äù Richter, Conrad, The Awakening Land (1966), p. VII (Foreword)  Major themes  =Family= Sayward values family above all else. She expresses a strong loyalty to the ties of kinship, even if this loyalty is not always returned. Several members of her birth family, including her father, Worth, her brother Wyitt, and her sister Ascha eventually abandon or otherwise leave the family home, with no attempt to maintain communication. Her younger sister, Sulie, is lost to the forest, and eventually is assimilated into the Lenape Indian tribe. But Sayward always remembers these absent family members and holds them in her thoughts. When she has problems in her marriage or with her own children, whether because of her husband's infidelity or because of generational differences, Sayward tries to defuse tensions and ultimately forgives any wrongs committed. =Man against Nature= The characters in The Awakening Land deal with the human condition in a setting of great natural challenges as they carve out lives on the frontier. Disease, warfare, natural disasters, severe weather, and accidents, as well as dangerous animals, all contributed to a high mortality rate amongst the pioneers. They worked to cut down trees and clear the land, to cultivate crops, to care for livestock, and to raise and process all their food. They also had to deal with hostilities from native Indians resisting white American encroachment. At times the pioneers and settlers faced famine and such natural disasters as floods. =Change and nostalgia= The central character, Sayward Luckett Wheeler, witnesses the transformation of the frontier settlement founded by her father into a town with a church, a school, frame and brick houses, businesses, and such other improvements as roads, bridges, canals, a railroad, and a county courthouse ‚Äì all within her lifespan of some eighty-odd years. Although Sayward at first welcomes these developments as a promise of prosperity and improved lives, by the end of the trilogy, she questions whether the rapid changes have instead fostered greed and laziness in the townspeople. Sayward‚Äôs changing feelings are symbolized by her attitude toward the trees of the forest. The original settlers cut these down in a wide area to develop their farmsteads and later the town of Americus. In the beginning, Sayward has an almost personal animosity toward the trees, because of the backbreaking labor they required as settlers struggled to clear the land for farms and homes. By the last novel of the trilogy, Sayward mourns the loss of the great trees: > \\"She had thought it then a wonderful sight to see, a place free of the > lonesome gloom of the deep woods, and nary a big butt (tree) to have to cut > down and burn up. But she didn't know how much she liked it now. . . . Now > why did she think all her life that trees were savage and cruel? . . . . > Maybe she was just homesick for when she was young.\\"Richter, Conrad, The > Awakening Land (1966), Chapter 23 of The Town, p. 521 Coming to understand what they mean to her, Sayward finds several young trees on the edges of her former land. She transplants them to the front and side yards of her house. On her deathbed, before she loses the power of speech, she asks for her bed to be moved so that she can see the trees to her last breath. =Pioneer vs. modern generation= Sayward believes that the original settlers were forced to build character by their hard work and persistence in the face of adversity. By contrast, the new generation of town settlers seems untested. To Sayward's mind, the new generation are taking advantage of the work done by people before them, and have not made equal contributions or sacrifices. Contemporary life seems easy by contrast. > ‚ÄúWhat gave folks ‚Äònarve strings‚Äô today and made them soft so they couldn‚Äôt > stand what folks could when she was young? . . . . It had taken a wild and > rough land to breed the big butts (trees) she saw when first she came here, > and she reckoned it took a rough and hard life to breed the kind of folks > she knew as a young woman. If you made it easy for folks, it seemed like > their hardihood had to pay for it.‚Äù Richter, Conrad, The Awakening Land > (1966), Chapter 33 of The Town, p. 613 By comparison, her youngest son, Chancey, follows the Socialist beliefs of social reformer Robert Owen. He believes that the goal of the community should be sharing labor for the benefit of all, that progress means that work could be rewarding in itself, and there should not be wide separation of classes. > ‚ÄúRobert Owen said . . . if you make a man happy, you make him virtuous. [He] > said that one of the main occupations of working people should be play. . . > . Everybody can choose his own work and do as little of it as he wants to. . > . . Of course there‚Äôll have to be a little repulsive labor at first. But > progress will do away with all toil and labor in time. . . . Everybody will > share alike. There‚Äôll be no rich people and no poor people, just brothers > and sisters. And everybody will have security and happiness.‚Äù Richter, > Conrad, The Awakening Land (1966), Chapter 26 of The Town, p. 544 Critical reception When reviewing Richter‚Äôs 1950 book The Town, fellow Pulitzer Prize-winner and Ohioan author Louis Bromfield surveyed the trilogy, writing: > ‚ÄúAs the names imply, the three books are not only concerned with Sayward and > her family but the growth and the astonishingly rapid development of a whole > area which has played a key role in the nation‚Äôs history . . . . When you > read the three books in the trilogy, you live them, and I can think of no > greater tribute for a novel.‚Äù ‚ÄúOhioan Authors: Conrad Richter‚Äù, WOSU Public > Media, The Ohioan Library Association Writer Isaac Bashevis Singer, a Nobel Prize winner in 1978, referred to The Awakening Land trilogy in his Foreword of Richter‚Äôs 1968 novel The Aristocrat: > ‚ÄúThere are in the literature of the world few works of historical fiction > that make this reader feel that the writer must have been a witness to what > he describes . . . . 'The Awakening Land' is such a work . . . it would be a > great novel in any literature.‚Äô‚Äô ‚ÄúEarly Americana: A Conrad Richter Tribute‚Äù Film and TV adaptations In 1978, The Awakening Land trilogy was adapted as a three-part television miniseries of the same name. Starring Elizabeth Montgomery and Hal Holbrook, the miniseries aired from Feb. 19 to Feb. 21 on NBC. It was nominated for several Emmy Awards. Differences between books and TV adaptation * Several characters in the books were dropped from the TV miniseries because of the constraints of time and budget. The Luckett family is reduced to four daughters; Wyitt, Sayward‚Äôs brother, is omitted. * In the miniseries, the father, Worth Luckett, returns after the search for the youngest daughter, Sulie, and does not leave until both Genny and Sayward are married (in the book, Worth abandons the family right after Sulie disappears). In both versions, Worth eventually returns to visit years later. * In the book, Worth tells his surviving daughters before his death that he found their sister, Sulie, living with a Lenape (Delaware Indian) man; she was fully assimilated to the tribe. Sayward and Genny then take a trip to visit Sulie where she lives in Indiana, with disappointing results. In the miniseries, Sulie disappears altogether, and Worth survives to see Sayward and her family move into their new town mansion. * In the miniseries, Sayward‚Äôs husband, Portius, says that he left Massachusetts and cut ties with his family because he was ashamed that his father had gained his wealth through secretly dealing in slaves. In the book trilogy, Portius never reveals his past, and Sayward does not ask him about it. * In the miniseries, Sayward cuts off conjugal relations with Portius because she is having obstetrical problems; she refuses his offer to go to a doctor. In the book, Sayward simply tells Portius she does not want any more children - ceasing sex is the only reliable form of birth control available to them. * In the miniseries, Portius offers to send his mistress, Miss Bartram, to another town when their affair results in her pregnancy; she refuses and asks him to leave Sayward and marry her. None of this occurs in the book. * In the miniseries, Sayward discovers her husband‚Äôs affair when she accidentally sees the couple kissing. In the book, she learns about it through town gossip. * In the miniseries, Sayward sends Portius away on a long business trip after her discovery of his affair. She sleeps apart from him even after his return and returns to his bed only after he almost dies from fever. In the book, the couple never separate, and Sayward returns to Portius‚Äô bed sooner; she feels partially responsible for his affair as she had denied him sex. * In the book, the subplot involving Chancey and his half- sister, Rosa Tench, ends when they are young adults; Rosa kills herself when she realizes Chancey will never run away with her. In the miniseries, Chancey and Rosa are still children when she dies by drowning in the river. Chancey had told her they were forbidden to play together anymore; it is not clear whether her death was deliberate or accidental. Chancey and Rosa probably remained children in the miniseries screenplay in order to conform to the time constraints in the television version, which ends the story of the Wheelers at a much earlier point than in the novels. * In the miniseries, Portius tries to make amends for his treatment of Rosa by writing an apology to her family and having her buried in his family burial ground instead of a pauper‚Äôs grave. None of this occurs in the book. * The book trilogy follows Sayward‚Äôs life until her death. The miniseries ends her story earlier, concluding with her family‚Äôs move into their town mansion.

He is often described as the most important Ottoman artist of his period. Abdullah Buhari was known for making portraits of women, specializing in female figures and floral still-life. He also had an innovative approach to creating three-dimensional paintings which attracted an abundance of attention throughout the Ottoman time period, which ultimately created a strong connection to artistic Western contemporaries. Along with others, Buhari's style of art was unique. One could dissect from afar that his style of painting was very personal compared to other eighteenth century painters of Istanbul. Buhari was also responsible for painting distinct landscapes on lacquer book covers. All of Buhari's works were duly signed and dated with the name: raqama Abd Allah Bukhari. Ottoman period art transformation Although most of his work was made for patrons and Sultans, majority of his work are now pursued for collection purposes. Buhari also had a large collection of other forms of work that were not as well known; a set of erotic paintings. Many have suggested that Buhari used real life models for his single-figured miniatures indicating that his work was greatly influenced by European erotica. Due to the noble status that was powerfully stressed during mid-eighteenth century, Abdullah Buhari presented women as iconography that needed to be identified and interpreted in a novel and more in-depth way. Buhari's elite women were rather ‚Äúdoll-like, stout and grim faced.‚Äù His painting of an elegant lady in 1745 bearing her breasts stresses Buharis style. Famous works =Lady at the Bath= One of his best known miniatures depicts a nude woman at the bath. Seated on a wooden bench next to a marble basin, her pear-shaped body with broad hips and small breasts is typical of the exaggerated voluptuousness of early-modern female figures, both Eastern and Western. A towel is shown in the portrait covering her knees, but at the same time, exposes her loins and pubic area. She wears jeweled ear- rings, an armband, a bracelet, and a ring. Her finger and toe nails, as well as her heels, are decorated with bright red henna which provides a striking contrast with her white skin. This piece was widely known, though it did not appear in famous novelty albums, but rather a cardboard-like painting. This particular painting was focused to a different class in audience, which was populated by individuals who were unable to afford entire albums. Influence on art Buhari had huge impacts in the style of art being generated. Due to his appealing distinct style, it brought forward more ‚Äúvolume, definition, and weight‚Äù to the Ottoman paintings. His work also managed on letting the figures evade traditional representative prototypes by displaying his model figures in space unlike other artists, before, and during his art-history time period. =Fashion= Buhari's influence in fashion was also very significant as academics noted that his paintings portrayed women's fashion during the Ottoman time period. His interpretation of the large heads, strong necks, with huge bellies and with hips that contrast the shoulders and arms introduced a taste that was quite different from the previous generations.

Biography Mikhail Vasilyevich Avdeev was born on October 10 (September 21, old style), 1821, in the old Yaik Cossacks family in Orenburg. One of his private teaches was the Polish author and social activist Tomasz Zan, and it was to the latter's credit that the boy developed his passion for literature. In the late 1820s the family moved to Ufa where Mikhail studied in a gymnasium. In the mid-1830s he enrolled into the Saint Petersburg Institute of Railroad Engineers and, having graduated in 1842, went to work in Nizhny Novgorod. =Literary career= In 1849‚Äì1852 Sovremennik published three novels by Avdeev - Varenka, The Notes of Tamarin and Ivanov‚Äîlater to become known as the Tamarin trilogy. The hero, Tamarin, was seen by the author as a development of the Pechorin character; another 'superfluous man', eager to put his worthy qualities and moral strength to a socially useful action and failing to find any. The trilogy was very popular and for the rest of the decade Russian critics used the \\"Tamarin\\" token name as a symbol of a certain social type. Encouraged by the trilogy's success, Avdeev retired from the service and settled in his Orenburg Governorate family estate to become a professional writer. His Letters of a Vacant Man from Petersburg to the Province appeared in Sovremennik in 1853. In 1861 Avdeev returned to the state service, to work as a councilor in a local court specializing in land disputes, following the 1861 Land reform. In 1862 in poet Mikhail Mikhaylov's archives Avdeev's letters were found. He was arrested and deported to Penza. \\"Cautious as he might be, his enunciations are often quite liberal and are of a Hertzen-like nature,\\" the Russian secret police report maintained.Literaturnoye nasledstvo // The Literary Heritage. - Vols. 51‚Äì52, p. 88 In 1856 Avdeed was granted the permission to leave the country. Three years later he returned to Russia from France (where he became close to Ivan Turgenev) and in 1860 published his Underwater Rock novel, the idea of a 'free love' being its leitmotif. The novel was criticized for being schematic and 'cold'. \\"Lifelessness in the major feature of all Avdeev's works,\\" critic Nikolai Strakhov opined. Even less successful with critics was his Between the Two Fires (1868) novel, featuring landlord Kamyshlintsev as a main character, whose occupation seemed to be \\"dreaming of big love and of some great cause to pursuit\\" and whom Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin defined as \\"the type of a Wanton Russian man\\". Novelets Magdalene, The Motley Life and The Dried-Out Love (all 1870), dealing with married women's spiritual tribes and tribulations, established Avdeev as a \\"divorce suit specialist\\", according to Saltykov- Shchedrin. By this time the writer's popularity waned, yet critics from the liberal camp were eager to give him credit for \\"helping to slacken these crashing fetters of a formalist morality and introduce the humane approach to the stale atmosphere of the society's notions about canons of family life,\\" as Alexander Skabichevsky has put it. Avdeev's 1874 collection of essays Our Society as Shown in Heroes and Heroines of the 1820‚Äì1879 Russian Literature followed the Dobrolyubov's style of analytical social criticism, yet failed to produce the similar response. Avdeev wrote two plays, The Philistine Family and The Sixth Sense; the latter has been produced by the Alexandrinsky Theatre but failed to cause any stir. Mikhail Avdeev died on February 13 (February 1, o.s.), 1876, in Saint Petersburg. His last books, My Times in 1830s and In the Forties were published posthumously. Legacy Avdeev's best-known work, the Tamarin trilogy, highlighting the tragedy of a gifted but socially inert man, was obviously lacking in originality, borrowing heavily from Mikhail Lermontov's A Hero of Our Time, but also from Alexander Pushkin's Evgeny Onegin and Alexander Druzhinin's Polinka Zachs. \\"Finely written, his novels lack in freshness and are sewn-up with well-worn fragments, while novelets are not suited at all for our age which sometimes forgives roughness of form, but never - the lack of ideas,\\" wrote Nikolai Chernyshevsky, who saw the Tamarin character as a parody on that of Pechorin, by no means the development of it.The Works by Nikolai Tchernyshevsky, Vol. 1, p. 25 And yet, according to the Russian Literary Dictionary, \\"both readers and critics of the time admired Avdeev for his gift of storytelling, coupled with willingness to respond eagerly to any trendy theme or social issue.\\" \\"What made him popular was his liberal, humane attitude and the agility with which he was throwing himself headfast into every new social current,\\" Alexander Skabichevsky wrote.

The intended purpose of a CPZ is to reduce the clutter that can arise from erecting several signs that would otherwise convey the same information, such as a common time restriction sign adjacent to all the single yellow lines in the zone. A sign indicating the start of a CPZ typically states that there are parking, loading, weight or other restrictions between certain hours of operation. The CPZ applies to all parking within the zone unless individual parking bays are signed with different restrictions. Uses This sign indicates that only local residents can park here during the specified times. A common use for a CPZ is to allow only residents, or other valid permit holders, of an area to park in on-street spaces at certain times of the day, which will be shown on street signs. CPZ permits are not free, and local councils set the fees for permits. A permit does not guarantee a resident the right to park on a specific road or in a specific place, but allows that a permit holder may occupy any available space within the CPZ according to the terms of the permit. Legal status Controlled Parking Zones are defined in statute by Schedule 4 of the Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions 2016. In 2010 Neil Herron lost a challenge to the legality of a CPZ operated by Sunderland City Council, having claimed that the presence of other road markings within the zone rendered it invalid. He was issued with 55 fixed penalty notices for parking offences in the zone and made representations to the parking adjudicator, claiming that the offences did not occur due as the CPZ was not valid. The case was heard by the Court of Appeal in 2011 whereby the judge upheld the legality of the CPZ operated by Sunderland.

It was inactive, with only five known tropical cyclones. Operationally, another tropical storm was believed to have existed offshore Atlantic Canada in late August and early September, but HURDAT ‚Äì the official Atlantic hurricane database ‚Äì now excludes this system. The first system, Hurricane One, was initially observed on August 6. The final storm, Hurricane Five, was last observed on September 17. These dates fall within the period with the most tropical cyclone activity in the Atlantic. At one point during the season, two tropical cyclones existed simultaneously. Two of the cyclones only have a single known point in their tracks due to a sparsity of data, so storm summaries for those systems are unavailable. Of the season's five tropical cyclones, four reached hurricane status. Furthermore, one of those four strengthened into a major hurricane, which are Category 3 or higher on the modern-day Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale. The strongest cyclone of the season, Hurricane Five, peaked at Category 3 strength with 125 mph (205 km/h) winds. It brought only minor impact to Louisiana and Mississippi. The first storm of the season brought locally severe impact to Tampico, Tamaulipas, Mexico in early August. Tropical Storm Four caused severe damage in the Lesser Antilles.

Maximum sustained winds were at 105 mph (165 km/h), indicating a Category 2 hurricane. No further information is available on the meteorological history of this storm. However, it is possible that the storm developed in the Caribbean Sea in late July, due to data obtained from the barque Bercaldine. Torrential rainfall in the Tampico area caused disastrous flooding, with heavy damage to goods and property. Eleven vessels were docked at Tampico, some of which lost their cargo. At the mouth of the P√°nuco River, a pilot station and a fort were swept away. The event was considered \\"the worst inundation of Tampico over the last 30 years\\". =Hurricane Two= The ship James Foster Jr. encountered a hurricane on August 10, while located about east-southeast of Cape Race, Newfoundland. Sustained winds of 105 mph (165 km/h) were observed, equivalent to a Category 2 hurricane. Data from the James Foster Jr. and Rebecca indicate that the storm moved rapidly northeastward. This system was last noted about west of Ireland on August 11. =Hurricane Three= HMS Walverine reported a hurricane at 12.5¬∞N, 83.0¬∞W, which is located about north of Corn Islands, Nicaragua. A sustained wind speed of was observed. Shortly thereafter, HMS Walverine was wrecked and no further information is known about this storm. =Tropical Storm Four= Based on reports of a strong gale, a tropical storm was first tracked about east-southeast of Barbados early on August 24. It initially headed westward, before re-curving west-northwestward early on the following day. Shortly thereafter, the storm passed through the Windward Islands between Grenada and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. The storm peaked with winds of 70 mph (110 km/h) while moving northwestward across the Caribbean Sea. It weakened slightly before making landfall near San Pedro de Macor√≠s, Dominican Republic with winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) early on August 27. The storm slowly weakened over Hispaniola and was last noted near Bombardopolis, Haiti later that day. There was considerable damage in the Lesser Antilles. On Saint Vincent, rains destroyed roads and a number of houses. Many sugar cane fields were also ruined. Several vessels were lost there and on other islands, including Barbados, Dominica, and Martinique. On Saint Croix in the present-day U.S. Virgin Islands, at least one vessel was destroyed by the heavy gales. There were also strong gales reported in Puerto Rico and Dominican Republic. =Hurricane Five= The Middle Gulf Shore Hurricane of 1855 The ship Orphan encountered a hurricane with winds of 80 mph (130 km/h) in the central Gulf of Mexico on September 15. It strengthened quickly while moving northward, becoming a Category 2 hurricane later that day. By 0000 UTC on September 16, the storm peaked as a Category 3 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 125 mph (205 km/h), making it the strongest tropical cyclone of the season. Shortly thereafter, the hurricane made landfall near Buras-Triumph, Louisiana at the same intensity. It weakened after moving inland, decreasing to Category 1 intensity later on September 16. Early on the following day, the system weakened to a tropical storm, several hours before dissipating over central Alabama. This was regarded as the worst hurricane in the region since 1819. In Louisiana, winds and storm surge impacted the eastern portions of the state. The wharf and bathhouse in Proctorville were swept away. About of water was reported at Proctor's Landing. A combination of strong winds and storm surge destroyed a number of houses along the shores of Lake Borgne. Along the coast of Mississippi, most structures were swept to sea. The foundation of the Biloxi Lighthouse was endangered due to erosion from this storm. The Cat Island Lighthouse was also left in \\"severe peril\\". Several ships were damaged or capsized in the Mississippi River, including Atchafalaya, J.S. Chenoweth, Ship Shoal, and Venice.Early American hurricanes 1492‚Äì1870, David Ludlum, pp. 163‚Äì165 =Other systems= In addition to the five tropical systems, another storm was operationally believed to have existed in late August and early September. The ship Atlantic encountered a very heavy gale while located west of Sable Island, Nova Scotia on August 31\\\\. The storm moved rapidly east-northeastward offshore Atlantic Canada. It was last noted on September 2 and was thought to have transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. However, HURDAT no longer includes this system in its database.

She was bred at Triple E Farm in Ocala, Florida by owner Stanley M. Ersoff. She was a chestnut filly, a daughter of Mo Exception out of the mare Double Wiggle. Charon's pedigree and partial racing stats She is best remembered for her seven and a half length romp in the Grade II $250,000 Black-Eyed Susan Stakes and her win in the Coaching Club American Oaks two months later.  Early racing career  In 1990, Stanley M. Ersoff's homebred Charon proved to be the second best three- year-old in the country behind Champion Go For Wand during her three-year-old season. The year began with a big win in January in the Forward Gal Stakes at seven furlongs at Gulfstream Park. In March, she won the grade two Bonnie Miss Stakes (now called the Gulfstream Oaks) at a mile and one sixteenth in 1:44.60. In a short turnaround of two weeks, Charon was entered in the Ashland Stakes at Keeneland Race Course in Lexington, Kentucky. In that mile and one sixteenth race, she placed second to Go for Wand. Black-Eyed Susan Stakes On the third Friday of May, the connections of Charon ran her in the de facto second jewel of the national \\"Filly Triple Crown,\\" the Grade II $250,000 Black-Eyed Susan Stakes at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland. In that 66th running of the Black-Eyed Susan, Charon went off as the second favorite in a field of nine fillies. She took an awkward step at the break and started slowly under jockey Craig Perret. The Florida bred picked it up a bit down the backstretch but was still running in mid-pack. Around the final turn, Charon made a sweeping move wide around the field and within a sixteenth of a mile passed every one of her competitors. Down the lane, she continued to widen her stride and won going away by seven and a half lengths over Valay Maid and Bright Candles, who was trained by D. Wayne Lukas. She won the race in 1:48.40 and the winner's share of 60% of the purse, equaling $150,000. That win pushed her streak up to five wins in the last six races.  Later racing career  In June 1990, Charon was entered in the Mother Goose Stakes at a mile and one sixteenth at Belmont Park. She lost to her arch-rival and soon to be named American Champion Three-Year-Old Filly, Go For Wand. Near the end of her three year-old season in late July, Charon won the grade one Coaching Club American Oaks at Belmont Park. She finished the mile and one quarter in 2:02-3/5 under jockey Craig Perret. In January 1991, the Eclipse Awards were held, and Charon came in second in the voting to Go For Wand. In the middle of March of her four-year-old season, Charon won the Johnny Walker Black Classic which is now the Rampart Handicap at a mile and one eighth at Gulfstream Park in Hallandale Beach, Florida. Broodmare record Charon produced no major winners, but her Japanese-bred daughter Sibyl was the dam of Just A Way. Charon died on April 12, 2009 after delivering a stillborn foal by Heart's Cry.

While working as a sign-painter or artist, he saw a performance of a provincial company. He appeared onstage at Newcastle, Staffordshire, as Hob in Hob in the Well (Colley Cibber), but suffered stage-fright and ran off the stage. A year later at Raither in North Wales he got through the same part. Playing Frank Oatland in A Cure for the Heartache (Thomas Morton) he was seen and engaged by Nunns, the manager of the Stafford Theatre; and he worked in Stafford for some years. Tate Wilkinson, to whom he introduced himself, engaged him for the York circuit around 1803. His reception was favourable.

Batuecas was a professor of chemistry and vice-chancellor of the University of Santiago de Compostela. Life He graduated with honors from the Faculty of Sciences at the University of Salamanca in 1913 and in the same year began doctoral studies in Madrid under Blas Cabrera Felipe. In 1916, Batuecas studied in the University of Geneva with Philippe A. Guye where he was interested in density and compressibility of real gases. In Geneva he also met Enrique Moles Ormella, who became his long-standing research colleague. In 1917, he presented his doctoral thesis at the University of Madrid and then returned for a brief period to the University of Geneva to teach chemistry. On his return to the Complutense University of Madrid, he continued his work on properties of gases with Cabrera and Moles. In 1932, Batuecas joined the University of Santiago, where he remained until his retirement in 1963. In 1936, he was appointed Vice- Chancellor. During his career, Batuecas published more than 130 scientific papers. His research mainly involved determinations of atomic weights, either using density measurements of gases or X-ray crystallography. The work on atomic weights started in Geneva in 1916 with Guye, and was focused to evaluate Daniel Berthelot‚Äôs method of limiting densities for real gases. In Madrid (1924) Batuecas also became interested in X-ray crystallography to determine the atomic weights of elements. The most notable contribution of Batuecas in this field is perhaps his role in the adoption of the international scale of atomic weights based on the carbon-12 nuclide. Batuecas was the chairman of the International Atomic Weights Commission from 1960‚Äì1963 and, in 1961, at the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) General Assembly held in Montreal, he played a decisive role in establishing the new atomic mass scale. Honors The city of Santiago, where Batuecas lived for 40 years, awarded him the silver medal of the city on the eve of his death. A street is named after him in Santiago. and in his hometown.

The pottery was initially supported by a loan from the Council for Small Industries in Rural Areas. Shaw trained under Beresford Peeling of Harnham Mill Pottery at Southampton College of Art (now Southampton Solent University) on the professional potters' course. Anne Shaw at the wheel, Haworth Pottery, 1988 The pottery was housed in a Grade II listed building, a stone, three-storey former handloom-weaver's residence at 25 & 27 Main Street. The pottery had a glaze-room, a workshop with a large kiln and wheel and upper and lower showrooms. Shaw produced hand-thrown domestic stoneware of a type pioneered by Bernard Leach in an Arts & Crafts tradition. The pottery differed, in its hand-made techniques and the type of clay used, from industrial pottery produced locally in the 19th century. The pots produced were high-fired‚Äîthe second (glaze) firing taken to 1300 ¬∞C. Shaw also created ceramic sculptures and received a Yorkshire Arts Association award. Most studio-potteries were located in the South-West, Cornwall and The Cotswolds, close to affluent middle class patronage. Haworth Pottery, therefore, represented a pioneering expansion of the Arts and Crafts Movement northwards, nearer to major industrial settlements. It introduced people familiar only with highly decorated industrial, commercial pottery to an alternative, hand-thrown pre-industrial mode of production with an emphasis on form, texture and glazes, where each pot had individuality. Most of the pottery's output was sold directly to the public from the Haworth showroom or its gallery on The Square, at Grassington, North Yorkshire, with the remainder wholesale to other outlets, including Heal's and galleries. Shaw received commissions from Leeds and Bradford churches, she exhibited at the Crafts Council's Crafts Advisory Committee Gallery in Leeds, the Mid-Pennine Arts Association Gallery in Blackburn, the National Media Museum gallery, Bradford Library Art Gallery, Southampton College of Art, York Arts Centre and, as an honorary member of the Yorkshire Guild of Craftsmen at St Martin's in Micklegate, York. Her work was included in an exhibition of Yorkshire Contemporary Arts & Crafts sponsored by the Hammonds Sauce Company and the British Tourist Board which toured the USA. The pottery closed in 1988.

In its attempt to get the nectar, the moth would have pollen rubbed onto its head, and the next orchid visited would then be pollinated. In 1903, such a moth was discovered: Xanthopan morganii. This was an example of an evolutionary prediction. However, because species coevolve within large networks of multispecies ecological interactions, this example of pairwise coevolution is more the exception than the rule. Evolving digital ecological networks are webs of interacting, self-replicating, and evolving computer programs (i.e., digital organisms) that experience the same major ecological interactions as biological organisms (e.g., competition, predation, parasitism, and mutualism). Despite being computational, these programs evolve quickly in an open-ended way, and starting from only one or two ancestral organisms, the formation of ecological networks can be observed in real-time by tracking interactions between the constantly evolving organism phenotypes. These phenotypes may be defined by combinations of logical computations (hereafter tasks) that digital organisms perform and by expressed behaviors that have evolved. The types and outcomes of interactions between phenotypes are determined by task overlap for logic-defined phenotypes and by responses to encounters in the case of behavioral phenotypes. Biologists use these evolving networks to study active and fundamental topics within evolutionary ecology (e.g., the extent to which the architecture of multispecies networks shape coevolutionary outcomes, and the processes involved). Overview In nature, species do not evolve in isolation but in large networks of interacting species. One of the main goals in evolutionary ecology is to disentangle the evolutionary mechanisms that shape and are shaped by patterns of interaction between species. A particularly important question concerns how coevolution, the reciprocal evolutionary change in local populations of interacting species driven by natural selection, is shaped by the architecture of food webs, plant-animal mutualistic networks, and host-parasite communities. The concept of diffuse coevolution, where adaptation is in response to a suite of biotic interactions, was the first step towards a framework unifying relevant theories in community ecology and coevolution. Understanding how individual interactions within networks influence coevolution, and conversely how coevolution influences the overall structure of networks, requires an appreciation for how pair-wise interactions change due to their broader community contexts as well as how this community context shapes selective pressures. Accordingly, research is now focusing on how reciprocal selection influences and is embedded within the structure of multispecies interactive webs, not only on particular species in isolation. Coevolution in a community context can be addressed theoretically via mathematical modeling and simulation, by looking at ancient footprints of evolutionary history via ecological patterns that persist and are observable today, and by performing laboratory experiments with microorganisms. In spite of the long time scales involved and the substantial effort that is necessary to isolate and quantify samples, the latter approach of testing biological evolution in the lab has been successful over the last two decades. However, studying the evolution of interspecific interactions, which involves dealing with more complex webs of multiple interacting species, has proven to be a much more difficult challenge. A meta-analysis of host-phage interaction networks, carried out by Weitz and his team, found a striking statistical structure to the patterns of infection and resistance across a wide variety of environments and methods from which the hosts and phage were obtained. However, the ecological mechanisms and evolutionary processes responsible have yet to be unraveled. Digital ecological networks enable the direct, comprehensive, and real time observation of evolving ecological interactions between antagonistic and/or mutualistic digital organisms that are difficult to study in nature. Research using self-replicating computer programs can help us understand how coevolution shapes the emergence and diversification of coevolving species interaction networks and, in turn, how changes in the overall structure of the web (e.g., through extinction of taxa or the introduction of invasive species) affect the evolution of a given species. Studying the evolution of species interaction networks in these artificial evolving systems also contributes to the development of the field, while overcoming limitations evolutionary biologists may face. For example, laboratory studies have shown that historical contingency can enable or impede the outcome of the interactions between bacteria and phage, depending on the order in which mutations occur: the phage often, but not always, evolve the ability to infect a novel host. Therefore, in order to obtain statistical power for predicting such outcomes of the coevolutionary process, experiments require a high level of replication. This stochastic nature of the evolutionary process was exemplified by Stephen Jay Gould's inquiry (\\"What would happen if the tape of the history of life were rewound and replayed?\\"Gould SJ (1990) Wonderful life: the Burgess Shale and the nature of history. W. W. Norton.) Because of their ease in scalability and replication, evolving digital ecological networks open the door to experiments that incorporate this approach of replaying the tape of life. Such experiments allow researchers to quantify the role of historical contingency and repeatability in network evolution, enabling predictions about the architecture and dynamics of large networks of interacting species. The inclusion of ecological interactions in digital systems enables new research avenues: investigations using self-replicating computer programs complement laboratory efforts by broadening the breadth of viable experiments focused on the emergence and diversification of coevolving interactions in complex communities. This cross-disciplinary research program provides fertile grounds for new collaborations between computer scientists and evolutionary biologists. History =Coreworld= The field of digital life was inspired by the rampant computer viruses of the 1980s. These viruses were self- replicating computer programs that spread from one computer to another, but they did not evolve. Steen Rasmussen was the first to include the possibility of mutation in self-replicating computer programs by extending the once- popular Core War game, where programs competed in a digital battle ground for the computer's resources. Although Rasmussen observed some interesting evolution, mutations in this early genetic programming language produced many unstable organisms, thus prohibiting scientific experiments. Just one year later, Thomas S. Ray developed an alternative system, Tierra, and performed the first successful experiments with evolving populations of self-replicating computer programs. =Tierra= Thomas S. Ray created a genetic language similar to earlier digital systems, but added several key features that made it more suitable for evolution in his artificial life system, Tierra. Primarily, he prevented instructions from writing beyond the privately allocated memory space, thus limiting the potential for organisms writing over others. The only selective pressure in Tierra was for rapid self-replication. Over the course of evolution, this pressure led to shorter and shorter genomes, reducing the time spent copying instructions during replication. Some individuals even started executing the replication code in other organisms, allowing those \\"cheaters\\", which were originally referred to as parasites in Ray's work, to further shrink their genetic programs. This form of cheating was the first evolved ecological interaction between organisms in artificial life software. Ray's cheaters pre-dated the formal study of evolving ecological interactions using Tierra-like digital evolution platforms by 20 years. =Avida= In 1993, Christoph Adami, Charles Ofria, and C. Titus Brown created the artificial life platform AvidaAvida download page (WebCite archive) at the California Institute of Technology. They added the ability for digital organisms to obtain bonus CPU cycles for performing computational tasks, like adding two numbers together. In Avida, researchers can define the available tasks and set the consequences for organisms upon successful calculation. When organisms are rewarded with additional CPU cycles, their replication rate increases. Since Avida was designed specifically as a scientific tool, it allows users to collect a comprehensive suite of data about evolving populations. Due to its flexibility and data tracking abilities, Avida has become the most widely used digital system for studying evolution. The DevolabDevolab at the BEACON Center currently continues development of Avida. thumb 500pxSelf-replication of a digital organism. The circular genome of a digital organism, on the left, consists of a set of instructions (represented here as letters). Some of these instructions are involved in the copy process and others in completing computational tasks. The experimenter determines the probability of mutations. Copy mutations occur when an instruction is copied incorrectly, and is instead replaced by a random instruction in the forming offspring's genome (as can be seen in the offspring, on the right). Other types of mutations, such as insertions and deletions are also implemented. Initially, all three of the parent's hardware pointers are in the same location, at the instruction represented here by r. As execution begins, the instruction pointer (indicated by an i) advances. The first few instructions allocate space for the offspring, and then move the write-head pointer (indicated by a w) into that space. The flow pointer (indicated by an f) is used to move the other pointers to genetically specified locations. The remainder of the process of self replication is carried out by a set of instructions at the end of the genome, commonly referred to as the copy-loop. When execution reaches the copy-loop, the flow pointer is used to keep the flow of execution inside of a loop that advances the read and write heads and copies instructions from the parent genome (read- head) to the offspring genome (write-head). Arcs inside the circular genome represent the execution flow, showing most of the CPU cycles being used during the copying process. After genome replication is complete, the parent organism divides off its offspring, which must now fend for itself within the Avida world. This animation was generated using Avida-ED, which is available under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License. Implementation =Digital organisms= Digital organisms in Avida are self-replicating computer programs with a genome composed of assembly-like instructions. The genetic programming language in Avida contains instructions for manipulating values in registers and stacks as well as for control flow and mathematical operations. Each digital organism contains virtual hardware on which its genome is executed. To reproduce, digital organisms must copy their genome instruction by instruction into a new region of memory through a potentially noisy channel that may lead to errors (i.e., mutations). While most mutations are detrimental, mutants will occasionally have higher fitness than their parents, thereby providing the basis for natural selection with all of the necessary components for Darwinian evolution. Digital organisms can acquire random binary numbers from the environment and are able to manipulate them using their genetic instructions, including the logic instruction NAND. With only this instruction, digital organisms can compute any other task by stringing together various operations because NAND is a universal logic function. If the output of processing random numbers from the environment corresponds to the result of a particular logic task, then that task is incorporated into the set of tasks the organism performs, which in turn, defines part of its phenotype. =Digital interactions= Interactions between digital organisms occur through phenotypic matching, which, in the case of task-based phenotypes, results from the performance of overlapping logic functions. Different mechanisms for mapping phenotypic matching to interactions can be implemented, depending on the antagonistic or mutualistic nature of the interaction. 500pxthumbLogical computations, i.e. tasks, partially define phenotypes, and phenotypic matching leads to ecological interactions Digital organisms process binary numbers taken from the environment using the instructions that constitute their genomes. When the output of processing those numbers equals the result of applying a logic function, the digital organism is said to have performed that task. The combination of tasks performed by a digital organism partially defines its phenotype. The center of the figure depicts the output of applying eight logical operators (tasks) on the two input numbers above. On the left and right, five hypothetical host (green) and parasite (red) phenotypes are represented as columns (on the top) and as circles (below). On the top, each column depicts a phenotype and each row represents a task. Tasks performed by each phenotype are filled. In the lower part, the interaction networks between hosts and parasites are illustrated, which result from phenotypic matching: a parasite infects a host (indicated by a line) if it performs at least one task that is also performed by the host. Inset numbers indicate the identity of phenotypes represented on the top. Arrows represent the temporal direction of the coevolutionary process: from the earliest phenotype to the most recent one. The order of tasks (from top to bottom) indicates the time needed for a digital organism to perform that task over the course of the evolutionary trajectory. Depending on the pattern of tasks performed by the digital organisms, a modular (left) or nested (right) interaction network can emerge. Host-parasite interactions In host-parasite interactions, the parasite organisms benefits at the expense of the host organisms. Parasites in Avida are implemented just like other self-replicating digital organisms, but they live inside hosts and execute parasitic threads using CPU cycles stolen from their hosts.Zaman, L., Devangam, S, Ofria, C. (2011). Rapid host-parasite coevolution drives the production and maintenance of diversity in digital organisms. Proceedings of the 13th Annual Conference on Genetic and Evolutionary Computation (GECCO), 219-226. Because parasites impose a cost (lost CPU cycles) on hosts, there is selection for resistance, and when resistance starts to spread in a population, there is selective pressure for parasites to infect those new resistant hosts. Infection occurs when both the parasite and host perform at least one overlapping task. Thus a host is resistant to a particular parasite if they do not share any tasks. This mechanism of infection mimics the inverse-gene-for-gene model, in which infection only occurs if a host susceptibility gene (the presence of a logic task) is matched by a parasite virulence gene (a parasite performing the same task). Additional infection mechanisms, such as the matching allele and gene- for-gene models, can also be implemented. In traditional infection genetic models, host resistance and pathogen infectivity have associated costs. These costs are an important part of theory about why defense genes do not always fix rapidly within populations. Costs are also present in digital host- parasite interactions: performing more or more complex tasks implies larger genomes and hence slower reproduction. Tasks may also allow organisms access to resources present in the abiotic environment, and the environment can be carefully manipulated to control the relative costs or benefits of resistance. By keeping track of task-based phenotypes as well as tracking information about successful infections in the community, researchers are able to perfectly reconstruct the interaction networks of digital coevolving hosts and parasites. The structure of these networks is a result of the interplay between ecological processes, mainly host abundance, and coevolutionary dynamics, which lead to changes in host specificity. File:Avida host- parasite coevolution web.ogvthumb 500pxEvolving host-parasite webs. Starting from a host phenotype (green node) and a parasite phenotype (red node), a complex network of interactions (arrows) between hosts and parasites emerges from the coevolutionary process. Nodes representing new host and parasite phenotypes appear and disappear over evolutionary time. The abundance of individuals expressing each phenotype changes continuously (indicated by node size) altering interaction patterns, and thus influencing subsequent coevolutionary dynamics. Interactions between a host phenotype and a parasite phenotype are depicted as arrows pointing in opposite directions: the thickness of red arrows indicates the fraction of infections that a particular parasite is responsible for inflicting on the indicated host phenotype, while the thickness of the green arrows indicates the fraction of all of the hosts a particular parasite phenotype infects that is accounted for by the indicated host phenotype. Often asymmetry between the thicknesses of arrow-pairs leads to red arrows dominating the picture. At these times, most parasite phenotypes are infecting only a small fraction of hosts expressing a given phenotype. Instead, the majority of those hosts are being infected by parasites with other phenotypes. This animation was generated using Pajek, which is available under the GNU General Public License.Pajek Wiki Homepage (WebCite copy). Mutualistic interactions Interactions in which both species obtain mutual benefit, such as those between flowering plants and pollinators, and birds and fleshy fruits, can be implemented in evolving digital experiments by following the same task matching approach used for host-parasite interactions, but using free-living organisms instead of parasitic threads. For example, one way to set up a plant-pollinator type of interaction is to use an environment containing two mutually exclusive resources: one designated for \\"plant\\" organisms and one for \\"pollinator\\" organisms. Similar to parasites attempting infection, if tasks overlap between a pollinator and a plant it visits, pollination is successful and both organisms obtain extra CPU cycles. Thus, these digital organisms obtain mutual benefit when they perform at least one common task, and more common tasks lead to larger mutual benefits. While this is one specific way to enable mutualistic interactions, many others are possible in Avida. Interactions that begin as parasitic may even evolve to be mutualistic under the right conditions. In most cases, coevolution will result in concurrent interactions between multiple phenotypes. Thus, observed networks of mutualistic interactions can inform our understanding about the outcomes and processes of coevolution in complex communities. Predator- prey interactions While host-parasite and mutualistic interactions are determined by task-based phenotypes, predator-prey interactions are determined by behavior. Predators are digital organisms that have evolved from ancestral prey phenotypes to locate, attack, and consume organisms. When a predator executes an attack instruction (acquired through mutation), it kills a neighboring organism. When predators kill prey, they gain resources required for reproduction (e.g., CPU cycles) proportional to the level accumulated by the consumed prey. Selection favors behavioral strategies in prey that enable them to avoid being eaten. At the same time, selection favors predators with behavioral strategies that improve their food finding and prey attacking abilities. The resulting diversity in the continuously evolving behavioral phenotypes creates dynamic predator-prey interaction networks in which selective forces are constantly changing as a consequence of the emergence of new, and loss of old, behaviors. Because predators and prey move around in and use information about their environment, these experiments are typically carried out using spatially structured populations. On the other hand, host- parasite and mutualistic coevolution are often done in well-mixed environments, though the choice of the environment is at the discretion of the experimenter. Applications Studies of digital organisms allows a depth of research of evolutionary processes that is not possible with natural ecosystems. They therefore provide a complementary approach to traditional studies of natural or experimental evolution. A key caveat in translating predictions of evolving digital networks to biological ones is that mechanistic details may differ substantially between interacting digital organisms and interacting biological organisms. Nevertheless, the general operational processes (Darwinian evolution, mutualism, parasitism, etc.) are equivalent, and so studies utilizing digital networks can uncover rules shaping the web of interactions among species and their coevolutionary processes. The evolution of digital communities and their ecological networks also allows for a perfect 'fossil record' of how the number and patterns of links among interacting phenotypes evolved. The selection pressures and parameters can also be controlled to an extent that is impossible in experimental evolution of living organisms. For example, the stability- diversity debate is a long-standing debate about whether more diverse ecological networks are also more stable. Mathematical models were able to show that a mixture of antagonistic and mutualistic interactions can stabilize population dynamics and that the loss of one interaction type may critically destabilize ecosystems. These techniques also enable detailed analysis of coevolutionary dynamics in multispecies networks, their historical contingency, and their genetic constraints.

The 19th century debates over public funding for religious schools, and reading the King James Protestant Bible in the public schools was most heated in 1863 and 1876.Steven K. Green, The Bible, the School, and the Constitution (2012), pp. 40, 88, excerpt Partisan activists on the public- school issue believed that exposing the Catholic school children to the King James Bible would loosen their affiliation to the Catholic Church. In response the Catholics repeatedly objected to the distinct Protestant observations performed in the local schools. For instance, in the Edgerton Bible Case (Weiss v. District Board (1890)), the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled in favor of Catholics who objected to the use of the Protestant Bible in public schools. This ruling was based on the state constitution and only applied in Wisconsin. Eventually the Catholics took a large voice and even control in the politics of the major cities.

In twelve of these states, Bible reading was legally required by state laws; 11 states passed these laws after 1913. In 1960, 42 per cent of school districts nationwide tolerated or required Bible reading, and 50 per cent reported some form of homeroom daily devotional exercise.Adam Laats, \\"Our schools, our country: American evangelicals, public schools, and the Supreme Court decisions of 1962 and 1963.\\" Journal of religious history 36.3 (2012): 319-334 at p 321-22. = A Turning Point: The \\"Regents' Prayer\\" and Engel v. Vitale = The media and popular culture often erroneously credit atheist Madalyn Murray O'Hair with removing school prayer from US public schools, when the case against recitation of the Lord's Prayer in Baltimore schools was decided by the Supreme Court in 1962. A more significant case had reached the Supreme Court one year prior, suddenly changing the legal climate for school prayer. In 1955, the New York Board of Regents developed a prayer recommended (but not required) for the school districts under its purview. The prayer was relatively short: \\"Almighty God, we acknowledge our dependence on Thee, and we beg Thy blessings upon us, our parents, our teachers, and our country.\\"Boston, Rob. \\"How Five New York Families Ended Coercive Prayer In America's Public Schools.\\" Church & State 65.6 (2012): 12. MasterFILE Complete. Web. 28 Oct. 2013. The board stated that the prayer would \\"combat juvenile delinquency and counter the spread of Communism.\\" Seven years later, Steven I. Engel, a Jew, was upset to see his son‚Äôs hands clasped and his head bent in prayer. He told his son that this was ‚Äúnot the way we say prayers.‚Äù Engel, a founding member of the New York Civil Liberties Union, brought action along with Daniel Lichtenstein, Monroe Lerner, Lenore Lyons, and Lawrence Roth, all parents of children in the Long Island, New York public school system, against Union Free School District No. 9 for its adoption and subsequent prescription of the so- called \\"Regent's prayer\\", arguing that it constituted the state-sponsored establishment of religion in violation of citizens‚Äô First Amendment rights via the Fourteenth Amendment.Engel v. Vitale. (1999). Supreme Court Cases: The Dynamic Court (1930‚Äì1999), N.PAG. Retrieved from EBSCOhost. Use of the Regent's prayer was initially upheld in both New York State Court and in the New York Court of Appeals, prompting Engels to petition the US Supreme Court in the Engel v. Vitale case in 1962. With its 6‚Äì1 vote to make public recitation of the Regents' Prayer in public schools unlawful, the U.S. Supreme Court made its first-ever decision on prayer in public schools. It made its second in 1963‚Äîthe Abington School District v.

Vitale (1962) and Abington School District v. Schempp (1963), the Supreme Court established what is now the current prohibition on state- sponsored prayer in US schools.

Schempp. (1999). Supreme Court Cases: The Dynamic Court (1930‚Äì1999), N.PAG. Retrieved from EBSCOhost. Madalyn Murray's lawsuit, Murray v. Curlett, contributed to the removal of compulsory Bible reading from the public schools of the United States, and has had lasting and significant effects. Until the lawsuit, it was commonplace for students to participate in many types of religious activities while at school, including religious instruction itself. Nonreligious students were compelled to participate in such activities and were not usually given any opportunity to opt out. The Murray suit was combined with an earlier case. With the success of the lawsuit, the intent of the Constitution with regard to the relationship between church and state again came under critical scrutiny and has remained there to this day. While students do continue to pray in public schools, even in organized groups such as \\"See You at the Pole\\", the lawsuit disallowed schools from including prayer as a compulsory activity required of every student. The success of O'Hair's lawsuit led to subsequent lawsuits by Mormon and Catholic families in Texas in 2000 to limit compulsory prayer at school- sponsored football games. Following these two cases came the Court's decision in Lemon v. Kurtzman (1971), a ruling that established the Lemon test for religious activities within schools. The Lemon test states that, in order to be constitutional under the Establishment Clause, any practice sponsored within state-run schools (or other public state-sponsored activities) must adhere to the following three criteria:Lemon v.

Jaffree. Great American Court Cases: Vol. 1: Individual Liberties.. Ed. Mark Mikula and L. Mpho Mabunda. (Detroit: Gale, 1999) Since the 1990s, controversy in the courts has tended to revolve around prayer at school-sponsored extracurricular activities. Examples can be seen in the cases of Lee v. Weisman (1992) and Santa Fe Independent School Dist. v. Doe (2000), where public prayers at graduation ceremonies and those conducted via public address system prior to high school games (at state school facilities before a school-gathered audience) were, respectively, ruled unconstitutional. Despite their attempts to present a clear stance on school- sponsored religious activity, Engel, Abington, and the cases for which these serve as precedent are cited by some proponents of school prayer as evidence of a contradiction between the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses.Lee v. Weisman. Great American Court Cases. Ed. Mark Mikula and L. Mpho Mabunda. Vol. 1: Individual Liberties. Detroit: Gale, 1999. Gale Opposing Viewpoints In Context. Web. 7 Sep. 2011. While the Establishment Clause proscribes the state sponsorship of religion, the Free Exercise Clause forbids state interference in individual religious exercise. Where a state entity moves to accommodate the right to individual religious expression under the latter clause, opponents of that \\"expression\\" may cite such accommodation as state \\"promotion\\" of one religious activity over another.Establishment Clause. (2006). In L. J. Fundukian & J. Wilson (Eds.), American Law Yearbook 2005 (pp. 60-64). Detroit: Gale. Regarding the Free Exercise Clause, the courts have consistently stated that students' setting forth of religious views through prayer cannot be forbidden unless such activity can be shown to cause disruption in the school, yet it remains beyond the scope of the state to require such practice.Preface to \\"Does Separation of Church and State Threaten Religious Liberty?\\" (2003). In J. D. Torr (Ed.), Current Controversies. Civil Liberties. San Diego: Greenhaven Press. Thus, anyone is allowed to pray in schools in the United States, as long as it is not officially sponsored by the school and it does not disrupt others from doing their work. The United States Supreme Court: A Political and Legal Analysis discussed the results of a 1991 survey, stating that: \\"The Court's school prayer decisions were, and still are, deeply unpopular with the public, many politicians and most religions organizations. 95 percent of the population believe in God and some 60 percent belong to a religious organization. In a 1991 opinion poll, 78 percent of Americans support the reintroduction of school prayer.\\"McKeever, Robert J. The United States Supreme Court: A Political and Legal Analysis. Manchester University Press. 1997. p 34. As a result of public support for school prayer in the United States, The Oxford Companion to the Supreme Court of the United States reports, \\"the public's support for school prayer was translated by various state legislatures into statutes aiding religious schools and practices.\\"Hall, Kermit. Ely, James W. Grossman, Joel B. The Oxford Companion to the Supreme Court of the United States. Oxford University Press. 2005. p 1061. Analysis of multiple polls since the 1970s by sociologist Philip Schwadel showed support for school prayer dipped slightly but remains popular with the majority of Americans, with a recent 2011 poll showing 65 percent support. Results show that those who attend church on a regular basis are 33% more likely to support prayer in schools than those who rarely attend church (82% and 49%, respectively). In addition, political ideology also plays a role in determining attitudes towards prayer in schools. Those who identify as Republican are more inclined to support daily prayer than Democrats and Independents, as 80% of Republicans, 64% of Independents, and 45% of Democrats are in favor. Studies show that these numbers have been steadily dropping since 2001, but the majority of Americans continue to support having religion in the education system. In 2015, high school football coach Joseph Kennedy was fired for kneeling at 50-yard line after football games to pray. Religious conservative groups argue that this is a violation of the 1st Amendment right of freedom of speech he has a private citizen. The case was taken to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit in 2017. They ruled in favor with the Washington State school district, saying that Kennedy was acting as public official and not as a private citizen when he was praying in front of students and parents. Then, in January of 2019, the Supreme Court refused to take the case. https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/01/22/supreme-court- wont-hear-praying-football-coach-case/1943694002/ = Public opinion = Questions regarding whether prayer should be present or absent in the United States public school system have been causing controversy for decades due to the need to allow religious freedom and guarantee the rights of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. Although the topic has many opponents as well as those who are indifferent to the issue, a 2014 Gallup poll indicates that the majority of Americans, 61%, are in favor of allowing daily prayer in the classroom and 37% oppose daily worship Evangelical Protestants are more likely to approve of school prayer than other religious groups. In a nationally representative study of 1,800 teens in the United States, 68 percent of the Evangelical Protestant teens that were surveyed thought it was appropriate for a teacher to lead a class in prayer while only 25 percent of unaffiliated teens agreed. https://www.pewforum.org/2019/10/03/for-a-lot-of-american-teens-religion-is-a- regular-part-of-the-public-school-day/ = \\"Moment of silence\\" = Despite ongoing debate, there are some instances where religious freedom and secular stability have been temporarily balanced. In the United States, some administrations have introduced a \\"moment of silence\\" or \\"moment of reflection\\" in which a student may, if they wish to, offer a silent prayer. The US Supreme Court decision in Wallace v. Jaffree (1984) held that a moment of silence in schools for the purpose of individual prayer or meditation constituted a valid application of the Free Exercise Clause, while a moment of silence for the clear intended purpose of a state-approved devotional activity constituted a violation of the Establishment Clause. In this same case, the issue of school prayer was further complicated by a distinction made between a public assembly attended by participants of their own free will, and a public event where attendance is legally required. A voluntarily attended Congress may open sessions with a prayer, but schools full of public pupils may not. Here the US Supreme Court has interpreted the issue as revolving around the degree of a government‚Äôs ability to indoctrinate its citizens. If it appears that participants at a state-sponsored event are more likely to influence the State itself, courts may treat prayer as \\"legislative prayer\\". If, on the other hand, the State is more likely to influence participants at its events, courts may treat prayer as \\"state-sponsored\\" prayer and thereby rule it unconstitutional.School Board Meeting Prayer Ruled Unconstitutional.

Yoga In recent years yoga exercise has been introduced into some public schools in the U.S., despite modern yoga's historical roots as a Hindu religious practice.

The concept was originally proposed by Claude L√©vi-Strauss who called them \\"soci√©t√©s √† maison\\".L√©vi-Strauss, Claude. 1987. Anthropology and Myth: Lectures, 1951-1982. R. Willis, trans. Oxford: Basil Blackwell. The concept has been applied to understand the organization of societies from Mesoamerica and the Moluccas to North Africa and medieval Europe.Joyce, Rosemary A. & Susan D. Gillespie (eds.). 2000. Beyond Kinship: Social and Material Reproduction in House Societies. University of Pennsylvania Press.Carsten, Janet & Stephen Hugh-Jones (eds.) About the House: L√©vi-Strauss and Beyond. Cambridge University Press, May 4, 1995 The House society is a hybrid, transitional form between kin-based and class-based social orders, and is not one of L√©vi-Strauss' 'elementary structures' of kinship. L√©vi-Strauss introduced the concept as an alternative to 'corporate kinship group' among the cognatic kinship groups of the Pacific region. The socially significant groupings within these societies have variable membership because kinship is reckoned bilaterally (through both father's and mother's kin) and come together for only short periods. Property, genealogy and residence are not the basis for the group's existence.  House societies and kinship  L√©vi- Strauss' most succinct definition of a House was that it is \\"a corporate body holding an estate made up of both material and immaterial wealth, which perpetuates itself through the transmission of its name, its goods and its titles down a real or imaginary line considered legitimate as long as this continuity can express itself in the language of kinship or of affinity and, most often, of both.\\" There are three elements to this definition: # The House is a corporate body (\\"moral person\\") holding an estate made up of both material and immaterial goods. # As a \\"moral person\\", it is an alternate metaphor replacing \\"blood\\" in defining the social identity of the group. As a symbol of the group, the House persists over generations and links the group to its sacred origins. # The House persists over time by transmitting its titles through conditional kinship principles: \\"patrilineal descent and matrilineal descent, filiation and residence, hypergamy and hypogamy, close marriage and distant marriage, heredity and election: all these notions which usually allow anthropologists to distinguish the various known types of society, are united in the house, as if, in the last analysis the spirit (in the eighteenth-century sense) of this institution expressed an effort to transcend, in all spheres of collective life, theoretically incompatible principles.\\" Only the core group (the highest-ranking members) will inhabit the House as a residence. The other House members (which Errington refers to as the \\"server group\\") will only come together on special ritual occasions, making this an \\"occasional kinship group.\\" Other House members have multiple overlapping ties to other Houses as well, through both mother's and father's kin. Their ability to assert a claim to membership in a House will depend on a number of criteria, such as their parents' participation, their ability to contribute to the House's upkeep, and their participation in its rituals. Successful claims of membership may bring special benefits, such as the right to utilize House resources with the consent of the core members.  House societies and social ranking  Most of the examples of ‚Äòsoci√©t√©s √† maison‚Äô cited by L√©vi-Strauss, with the exception of the Kwakiutl Indians of the North-west coast of Canada, were feudal. This has led some to ask if feudalism was an essential feature of House societies, and answering in the negative. Schrauwers, in contrast, has argued that House societies are characteristically organized around a system of social ranks, not feudalism. That is, the House is not an economic class but a socially ranked group (e.g. a nobility) in a society organized around a system of social ranks; while a House may own property, it is thus not tied to a feudal mode of production. Schrauwers gives, as an alternate example, societies organized around slavery where a noble group's property are its slaves (such as the Kwakiutl case).  Houses and politics  Houses are political in three ways; there is an intra- House politics by which leadership is determined and resources are allocated within the House, as well as an inter-House politics between rival Houses. These two forms of political engagement may be connected through agonistic exchange institutions such as the Potlatch. There is, lastly, also a politics of struggle and incorporation between highly ranked noble Houses and those groups like slaves and commoners who lack the resources to maintain their organization as a House. =Intra-House political struggle= Houses are tied together through oftentimes contradictory forms of kinship, whether descent or alliance. Given that Houses are not lineages, leadership is rarely ascribed by genealogical seniority alone (i.e. primogeniture). Leadership of a House is gained through status competition. =Inter-House political struggle= A number of traditional Southeast Asian kingdoms, such as those in Bali, or the kingdom of Luwu in Sulawesi, were dominated by noble Houses that competed with each other for control of the state. These states have alternately been described as mandala states. =Political struggles between classes within a House society= Although they may be referred to as House Societies, not all societies with Houses have those Houses uniformly distributed among all ranks and classes. The House in Bali, as well as in the kingdom of Luwu in Sulawesi, is an \\"optional\\" kinship group. Schrauwers has argued that class and House formation are linked. He points out, for example, that the inherited estate of some Sulawesi House societies in the kingdom of Luwu is composed of slaves; that is, the House's property is composed of another social rank of individuals. In this case, class and rank are synonymous. Because they are property, slaves are prevented from forming their own Houses. Commoners in those societies are of a different rank, but lack property, and therefore cannot form their own houses either. The way in which these lower classes were prevented from forming Houses was two-fold. On the one hand, they might be engaged in the agonistic exchange systems with Noble Houses that results in their using up and losing all of their House property. On the other hand, noble Houses at the centre of the state might engage in policies of divide and rule, urging different groups at the periphery to attack each other, take slaves, and these would form Houses which then intermarry with the Houses at the centre.

Open source projects In 2009, JetBrains open-sourced the core functionality of IntelliJ IDEA by offering the free Community Edition. It is built on the IntelliJ Platform and includes its sources. JetBrains released both under Apache License 2.0. In 2010, Android support became a part of the Community Edition, and two years later Google announced its Android Studio, the IDE for mobile development on Android platform built on the Community Edition of IntelliJ IDEA and an official alternative to Eclipse Android Developer Tool. In June 2015, it was announced that the support of Eclipse ADT would be discontinued making Android Studio the official tool for Android App development. MPS, short for meta programming system, and Kotlin, a statically typed programming language for JVM, are both open source and non-commercial. In January 2020, JetBrains released a geometric monospaced font called JetBrains Mono as the default font for their IDEs under the Apache License 2.0. It has a larger x-height than Consolas, Fira Mono, or Source Code Pro. Past projects Fabrique was to be a rapid application development (RAD) software framework for building custom web and enterprise applications. A preview version was shown in 2004, but it was never released. It was instead decided to \\"leverage all our gains in experience and new technologies to create a best-of-breed integration of IntelliJ IDEA with standard frameworks and technologies, thus pushing web application development to a whole new level\\". Omea is a desktop-based reader and organizer for RSS (and later of every bit of information that comes across one's desktop), the first and so far the only consumer-oriented product from JetBrains.

History The first Johnstown team played in 1883 in the Western Interstate League and 1884 in the Iron & Oil Association. A few years later, the Johnstown Pirates/Terrors played in the Pennsylvania State League. The Johnstown Buckskins in 1895 and the Johnstown Mormans in 1898 both played in the New York State League. The first version of the team named the Johnnies played in 1904 in the independent Pennsylvania League, which merged to become the Tri- State League the following year. This team moved to Chester, Pennsylvania during the 1912 season. The Johnnies resurfaced in the Middle Atlantic League in 1925 and played continuously through 1942, when they had to temporarily suspend playing due to World War II. After the war, the team started up again in 1946 before dissolving in 1950. The Wilkes-Barre Barons moved to Johnstown during the 1955 season and became the latest version of the Johnnies but only lasted two seasons. In 1961, the Boston Red Sox had an affiliate in Johnstown named the Johnstown Red Sox. Eddie Popowski managed the team. Multiple notable players spent time with the Johnstown Red Sox, including Guido Grilli, Bob Heffner, Jerry Mallett, Al Moran, Dave Morehead, Ted Schreiber, Pete Smith, Bill Spanswick and Wilbur Wood. A new version of the team, known first as the Steal and then the Johnnies played in the Frontier League from 1995‚Äì2002 before moving to Florence, Kentucky and becoming the Florence Freedom.

It was aired on June 10, 2013. The episode was written by Clark Perry and it was directed by Allan Kroeker. Plot Nolan (Grant Bowler) and Tommy (Dewshane Williams) investigate the Arkfall object that fell to Earth in the previous episode. There, they discover a human in hypersleep and when they awake him he is identified as Gordon McClintock (Brian J. Smith), an American astronaut whose space station was supposedly destroyed back in 2013 and the crew presumed dead. They return with him to Defiance and take him to Doc Yewll's (Trenna Keating) office to be examined. Yewll says that everything is normal but while she is examining him, Gordon has a vision that includes Indogenes, and he pushes her away. Nolan and Amanda (Julie Benz) take Gordon to Rafe's (Graham Greene) home to stay there for the night and Nolan and Amanda stay there too. During the night, Gordon suffers from another vision and he attacks Amanda trying to kill her, but he is stopped by Nolan, who locks him up. Upon awakening in the Lawkeeper jail cell, Gordon experiences a third vision and injures himself. When Nolan discovers that Gordon bleeds silver blood, he goes to Yewll to confront her and asks why she failed to report anything odd during Gordon's initial medical examination. Yewll then reveals that the Votans, before their arrival on Earth, had begun a spy and assassin program by kidnapping humans who had access to persons in positions of authority, were extracting their memories and then implanting them into surgically altered Indogene sleeper agents who would replace the real humans. Yewll speculates that Gordon is a prototype. Gordon, overcome with emotion after hearing this, seizes Nolan's gun and escapes. He enters the McCawley mines, where Rafe finds him. After they have a talk, it is implied that Gordon has committed suicide but later it is revealed that he has left Defiance to reunite with his widow. In the meantime, Conor Lang (Gale Harold) has returned once again to Defiance to invite Amanda to New York by offering her a job in the Earth Republic government. When Amanda declines his offer, he informs her that she is in danger if she stays in Defiance; the Earth Republic wants control of Defiance and they believe that she is a potential problem, and they will do anything that is necessary to remove her. During their conversation, it is also revealed that they had a relationship in the past. Meanwhile, Stahma (Jaime Murray) and Kenya (Mia Kirshner) continue their affair. Later, when Datak (Tony Curran) visits Kenya for his usual appointment, Kenya refuses him without providing a satisfactory explanation. Furious, Datak returns home and expresses suspicion to Stahma and Stahma advises Kenya not to refuse him again. The episode concludes with Nolan confronting Yewll and asking her to tell him everything about the Indogene spy program. Before she can do so, they are interrupted by the arrival of many humans suffering from a hemorrhagic fever.

But I don't think that's the purpose it serves. It's an effective expansion of Defiance's world, connecting the overt story of the show to the background material that only some viewers have. And that material fits well with the show and adds to the storytelling potential of what we might watch, in addition to being interesting on its own.\\" Lisa Macklem from Spoiler TV stated that overall, she found the episode doing a good job and she is looking forward for the next one. \\"Overall, I found the episode did a good job of filling out some of the backstory and history that has only been obliquely alluded to up until now.\\" Jim Garner from TV Fanatic rated the episode with 4/5. \\"After last week‚Äôs less than stellar offering, \\"I Just Wasn't Made For These Times\\" drifted back towards the story telling we've gotten to know.

Scientists at the Jawaharlal Nehru Tropical Botanic Garden and Research Institute (JNTBGRI),Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala here have confirmed the multiple therapeutic properties of Neurocalyx calycinus used by the Cholanaickan tribe, one of the particularly vulnerable groups in Kerala, to treat inflammations and wounds. The researchers have filed for a patent on a novel herbal drug formulation possessing wound-healing, burn-healing, anti-cancer, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, immuno- enhancing, platelet-augmentation and anti-oxidant effects. The scientists came to know of the miracle plant in 1988 during a biological survey deep inside the Nilambur forests. The team led by S. Rajasekharan, former Head, Ethnomedicine and Ethnopharmacology division, JNTBRI, came across Kuppamala Kaniyan, a tribal elder, with hideous scars right across his chest. On inquiry, it was revealed that he had been terribly mauled by a bear a few years ago. ‚ÄúWe were told that the animal had pinned him down and was trying to rip open his chest. The bleeding tribesman somehow fought back and managed to hack the bear to death,‚Äù says Dr. Rajasekharan. ‚ÄúIt took three days of persuasion before Kuppamala Kaniyan revealed how he had made a paste from the fresh leaves of N.calycinus, known in local parlance as ‚Äòpacha chedi,‚Äô to arrest the bleeding and heal the fresh wounds on his chest.‚Äù Systematic documentation of traditional knowledge helped scientists take up the research work later. Animal trials have proved that the leaves of N.calycinus possess wound-healing properties comparable to the standard drug Povidone/ Iodine in the early phase of inflammation. The anti-inflammatory activity of the leaves was found comparable to the drug diclofenac sodium. The pre-clinical trials confirmed the therapeutic effects of N.calycinus against burn wounds and pain, besides its immuno-enhancing, platelet augmentation, and anti-oxidant potential. The presence of high Vitamin E content and potent cytoprotective activity in cell lines in the plant species have also enhanced the prospects of developing an anti-cancer drug. In a presentation that won the best paper award at the Kerala Science Congress last month, Aneeshkumar A.L., a member of the research group, said the work had thrown up promising leads for the development of novel herbal formulations and modern medicines. ‚ÄúIt will now need multi-institutional studies to take the work forward,‚Äù says Dr. Rajasekharan. The paper said the JNTBGRI would share the commercial benefits of its work with the dwindling Cholanaickan tribe.

The schools are named after Nursultan Nazarbayev, former president of Kazakhstan, who has promoted the idea as a means of developing the intellectual life of the country. Previously, each school focused primarily on a specific set of subjects: either physical sciences and mathematics, or chemical and biological sciences, as well as foreign languages. Although this division is still represented in the names of schools, most schools share the same curriculum based on Cambridge O Level and A Level, except for NIS IB in Nur-Sultan. Instruction is trilingual, in Kazakh, Russian and English, shifting to exclusively English by the junior year. Partnerships The program was initially set up with the assistance of faculty members from the University of Pennsylvania Graduate School of Education. Subsequently, Nazarbayev Intellectual Schools partnered with the University of Cambridge Faculty of Education on curriculum development; Cambridge Assessment on design of the assessment system; CiTO, Netherlands on the testing and measurement; and Johns Hopkins University on working with talented youth.

Half of the Mapuche people live around the capital of Chile, which is Santiago. The other half tend to live in the south from river B√≠o B√≠o right until the Chilo√© Island. There is another fair-sized group of Mapuche people within the Argentina area. An interesting fact is that the Mapuche people will name themselves according to where they live. An example of this is the group of Mapuche people called the Huilliche, or the people from the south. Looking at the Mapuche people in the present day, they are in a vulnerable situation. Chile focuses strongly on class society. Unfortunately for the Mapuche people, they rank the lowest in class. There have been efforts from the state and the church to take the Mapuche people into the Chilean society. During an era, the Pinochet era to be exact, all the Mapuche land was privatized and later sold to foreigners and other wealthy owners/ landlords. During this time, new laws were also introduced, including the law that there would not be indigenous peoples within Chile. Instead, there would only be Chileans. Consequences of the Pinochet era were serious and the Mapuche's had to migrate to the bigger cities because of the loss of their land. Acclimating to a new environment proved difficult for those who had to move to cities, as they were forced to forget their culture in order to better fit in. Being a Mapuche also means it is difficult to make a decent living, as they are often paid less than other Chileans. They also struggle to receive their education. The class system in Chile is so rigid that it is not uncommon for Mapuche people to rid their names and adopt Chilean ones instead, in hopes of having a better life for their offspring. Though life proved difficult for the Mapuche people, there have been acts introduced to help protect their rights. For example, in 1993 the Indigenous Act, or Ley Indigena (no. 19.253) was introduced to protect all of the Indigenous groups within Chile. This law protected the indigenous peoples from being moved off of their land. Per the ‚Äúpermuta‚Äù, if a company/ organization/ the government wishes to move indigenous peoples from a piece of land, it is required that an equal piece of land is given to them in return. No transfer will be allowed to take place if the owner does not agree to the permuta. Every last person must agree to the trade, and if not, it will not be allowed. In addition to the Indigenous Act, the Corporaci√≥n Nacional de Desarollo Ind√≠gena, or CONADI, was formed. CONADI is a state authority and its purpose is to protect, as well as preserve, the cultural development of the Indigenous peoples of Chile. They are also meant to help conserve the land of the Mapuche people. Despite these advancements towards the protection and respect of the Mapuche people, there is still harm being done to their land. Chile is fast developing per outside pressures. This means that there are a large number of developmental projects happening on Mapuche land, roads being built and forests being destroyed.  Jos√© and the Cronicas De La Araucania  Jos√© Bengoa published his piece History of the Mapuche People roughly 30 years ago. He has recently published his newest volume, Cronicas de la Araucania. In an interview with Javier Garcia in December 2019, the Chilean anthropologist gave insight into his newest project. Bengoa is a known advocate for making sure that there is appropriate and accurate representation of Indigenous Peoples within the Constitutional Convention. With his newest volume, Jos√© reflects on the Mapuche people, their presence, and the symbols of them that have been present in different social protests. In his piece, he speaks about ‚Äúthe traveling man‚Äù or the ‚Äúhomo viator‚Äù. Bengoa uses this as a means to address the origins of these people, the evolving of their culture, their tribes, as well as their travel and journeys around the world. He also touches on how there has been a mass use of the Mapuche flag, which he says has been ‚Äúraised as a symbol of freedom and protest.‚Äù Bengoa was then asked questions in regards to the Mapuche people and their impact. One question asks how Bengoa interprets the mass use of Mapuche flags by many in Latin America. Bengoa goes on to explain the different ways in which it can be interpreted. He says that it is not uncommon to see a Mapuche flag more than a Chilean flag during marches. Some Latin Americans say that the Mapuche flag serves as a representation of mestizos/ Latin Americans. He says it also serves as support for the Mapuche nation and represents freedom. Bengoa is later asked about Camilo Catrillanca. Camilo was a Mapuche farmer of Ercilla in Chile, as well as the grandson of a very prominent Mapuche leader. On November 14, 2018, he was shot and killed by four Chilean police officers. His death was a catalyst that sparked numerous protests against police violence, as well as the struggle for the Mapuche peoples‚Äô civil rights. Bengoa speaks of how Catrillanca appears in demonstrations as well. The image being used has Mapuche features, which he says makes the image that much more iconic. This makes many believe that he was killed for simply being a Mapuche, and that within itself is why Bengoa has dedicated his life to teaching the story of the Mapuche people. The lack of respect for Mapuche‚Äôs comes as no surprise to Bengoa, as he has said that the Chilean society was and still is a racist place. Jos√© is then asked for his opinion on other Mapuche historians and anthropologists, such as Pablo Marim√°n and Fernando Pairican. Bengoa praises their presence in saying that ‚Äúit is a huge and highly positive transformation‚Äù. The Mapuche People are no longer being spoken for on behalf of other sociologists, historians, or anthropologists, but rather oneself has spoken for them. Bengoa praises the fact that there are different voices that are discussing the Mapuche People.  Research Initiatives: Mapuche Economy: Poverty and Subsistence in Contemporary Mapuche Society  Jos√© Bengoa, alongside Eduardo Valenzuela, are the responsible researchers for the Productivity and Income in Mapuche communities research initiative per the Centro de Estudios Interculturales e Ind√≠genas. In 1980, the bishop of Temuco, Sergio Contreras Navia had asked Bengoa and Valenzuela to conduct a study that would focus on the situation in the communes of Caut√≠n. The two researchers agreed and published their findings three years later under ‚ÄúMapuche Economy: Poverty and Subsistence in Contemporary Mapuche Society.‚Äù The goal of the project was to ‚Äúsocioeconomically characterize the Mapuche communities located in the province of Caut√≠n, La Araucan√≠a Region.\\" Due to the 300 cases that were collected and observed, the work done was innovative for the time. The comprehensive description of the precapitalistic system that had been based on the subsistence economy was also a helpful component to the progression of the research. Bengoa gives a statement, saying ‚ÄúAt that moment we observe the end of a long reduction period; If the Mapuche history is analyzed, there is a prereductional period until 1888, and between this year and 1927 the reductions were established where the indigenous people settled and they were forcibly peasantized, impoverishing a society that was rich.‚Äù It has been over thirty years since the original study had been done, and Valenzuela and Bengoa decided to replicate it. They wanted to study the current socioeconomic situation of the many Mapuche families that are living in rural areas. These areas will correspond to the provinces within Caut√≠n, however, this time they are incorporating the areas of Malleco. The goal of this replication of the original study was to see the differences between now and 35 years ago. The study states that their sample size consisted of: 300 Mapuche families in rural areas, 200 families in Caut√≠n, and 100 families in Malleco. To make the comparison as accurate as possible, the researchers selected the same communities of Caut√≠n that were used in 1987. Given that they did not conduct a study of Malleco in ‚Äò87, they simply chose random communities. They remained consistent with the number of surveys they had originally taken for each community in the original study. However, given the fact that this replication was 35 years after the original, the researchers found themselves running into difficulties. They had a lack of contact information for the previous families, making their identification nearly impossible. Instead, the children of the families within these communities were randomly chosen. The two requested plans from ‚Äúthe General Archive of Indigenous Affairs, AGAI, of the Conadi, located in Temuco.‚Äù By doing this, they were able to maintain the same procedure that they used in the original 1981 study. Bengoa makes an observation saying ‚ÄúWe observe that the change between 1980 and 2016 has been decisive. The new theme is that of water, especially in Mapuche agriculture. We realized that a huge number of communities have trucked water, with six to eight months without water. This has consequences on crops, everything. 40 years ago, there were no subsidies. Today, on the other hand, the number of subsidies is very large.‚Äù The two researchers said that if the subsidy level were to exceed a certain range, it is definite that production levels would decrease. Another observation made was that there is an older population, with most of the younger people emigrating for work or education. A final observation was the severity of poverty between now and the original study. Bengoa says ‚ÄúCurrently, we do not observe situations of hunger, it may be that there are certain months, at the beginning of summer; in 1980 there was poverty.\\" From the information that had been collected, they will calculate different indicators, including but not limited to: income coming from self-consumption, total gross income of Mapuche population, salary and income; net income, the total gross income without expenses on inputs and investments, as well as the net income per capita.  Awards/ Honors  Being a member of the National Commission for the Bicentenary of the Republic of Chile from 2000-2006, he received this honorable nomination from the President of the Republic of Chile, who at the time was Ricardo Lagos. He later received another nomination from Michelle Bachelet in 2006 until 2010. In 2002, Bengoa won the national award for tolerance and the fight against racism in Chile. In 2003, he won the Guggenheim Award from the John Guggenheim Foundation. Four years later, he received the Literature Award of the Santiago Municipality for his second volume publication of The Claimed Community; Identities, Utopias, and Memories in the Chilean society. In 2009 he was nominated by President of the Republic of Chile, Michelle Bachelet for member of the Board of the National Foundation for the Image of Chile.

After playing for West of Scotland Cricket Club in 1921, during which time he turned out against a touring Australian cricket team, Speed joined Warwickshire in 1927. He made eight first-class appearances, taking 29 wickets, before his career came abruptly to an end despite several career-best performances in his final matches. In his short first-class career, he maintained a healthy bowling average of 18.55. He finished the remainder of his cricketing days playing for Moseley and Warwickshire Imps cricket clubs. Career Speed was born on 19 January 1899 in Glasgow. A right-arm fast-medium bowler and tail-end right- handed batsman, in his early twenties Speed played for West of Scotland Cricket Club. On 9 July 1921 he faced the Australian team who were touring England and Scotland that summer. Speed took 3/111 ‚Äì dismissing Jack Ryder, Warwick Armstrong and Edgar Mayne ‚Äì and scored one and ten runs batting eleventh and then as nightwatchman in the second innings, as West of Scotland were forced to follow on. They managed to salvage a draw. Speed moved to England, joining Warwickshire in 1927. He made his first-class debut at the New Road Cricket Ground in Worcester on 6 August 1927. After being run out for three, he took 4/75 in a rain-affected two-day game. He then travelled with the team to Portsmouth to face Hampshire on 27 August, making eight and a duck yet taking 4/63 and 1/12 though Hampshire took a commanding nine-wicket victory. Speed did not play for the remainder of the 1927 season, however he rejoined Warwickshire in May 1928. On 5 May he faced Glamorgan at Edgbaston, taking 1/23 in the first innings though he went wicketless in the second. He also made his career best with the bat: 11 while batting last. Warwickshire controlled the match and won by ten wickets. Then on 19 May Speed travelled north to face Lancashire, but injury prevented him from taking the field at any point during the game. On 4 July, Speed returning to the field against Northamptonshire at Kettering, taking 2/50. This was followed on 14 July by his maiden five-wicket haul: 5/39 against a West Indies cricket team who were in England for their summer tour. Speed's five-for included the wickets of Clifford Roach, Maurice Fernandes, Joe Small, Teddy Hoad and Herman Griffith. Speed then went on to take four more wickets in the second innings, including Fernandes and Small for the second time and adding Learie Constantine and George Challenor. His final match figures were 9/109. Despite this success ‚Äì though the West Indians toured a weak team that summer, suffering heavy defeats across the country ‚Äì Speed would only play two more matches for his county. On 28 July he faced Glamorgan once more, taking his career-best 6/81 in the first innings. His final appearance came at Edgbaston once more, against Derbyshire, where he took a wicket-apiece in each innings. Speed did not play County Cricket again, however he enjoyed a four-year career for both the Warwickshire Imps and Moseley cricket clubs, two clubs which still exist today. Speed played for both clubs between June 1930 and June 1934, during which time Moseley competed in the Birmingham and District League for club cricket. He died in 1990 in Bromsgrove, aged 91 years.

A sequel to the 1982 film Blade Runner, the film stars Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford, with Ana de Armas, Sylvia Hoeks, Robin Wright, Mackenzie Davis, Carla Juri, Lennie James, Dave Bautista, and Jared Leto in supporting roles. Ford and Edward James Olmos reprise their roles from the original. Gosling plays K, a Nexus-9 replicant \\"blade runner\\" who uncovers a secret that threatens to destabilize society and the course of civilization. Ideas for a Blade Runner sequel were first proposed in the 1990s, but licensing issues stalled their development. Andrew Kosove and Broderick Johnson obtained the film rights from Bud Yorkin. Ridley Scott stepped down as the film's initial director and worked as an executive producer, while Villeneuve was later appointed to direct. Blade Runner 2049 was financed through an Alcon Entertainment‚ÄìSony Pictures partnership and a Hungarian government-funded tax rebate. Warner Bros., on behalf of Alcon, distributed the film in North America, while Sony handled distribution in international markets. Principal photography took place mostly at two soundstages in Budapest over a four-month period from July to November 2016. Blade Runner 2049 premiered in Los Angeles on October 3, 2017, and was released in the United States in 2D, 3D, and IMAX on October 6, 2017. The film was praised by critics for its performances, direction, cinematography, editing, musical score, production design, visual effects, and faithfulness to the original film, and was considered by many critics to be among the best films of 2017. However, it was a box office disappointment, grossing $260.5million worldwide against a production budget between $150‚Äì185million. Blade Runner 2049 was nominated for and won several accolades, receiving five nominations at the 90th Academy Awards, winning Best Cinematography and Best Visual Effects. It also received eight nominations at the 71st British Academy Film Awards, including Best Director, and won Best Cinematography and Best Special Visual Effects.  Plot  In 2049, bioengineered humans known as replicants are slaves. K, a Nexus-9 replicant, works for the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) as a \\"blade runner,\\" an officer who hunts and \\"retires\\" (kills) rogue replicants. At a protein farm, he retires Sapper Morton and finds a box buried under a tree. The box contains the remains of a female replicant who died during a caesarean section, demonstrating that replicants can reproduce biologically, previously thought impossible. K's superior, Lt. Joshi, fears that this could lead to a war between humans and replicants. She orders K to find and retire the replicant child to hide the truth. K visits the headquarters of the Wallace Corporation, the successor to the defunct Tyrell Corporation in the manufacture of replicants. Wallace staff members identify the deceased female from DNA archives as Rachael, an experimental replicant designed by Dr. Eldon Tyrell. K learns of Rachael's romantic ties with former blade runner Rick Deckard. Wallace Corporation CEO Niander Wallace wants to discover the secret to replicant reproduction to expand interstellar colonization. He sends his replicant enforcer Luv to steal Rachael's remains and follow K to Rachael's child. At Morton's farm, K sees the date 6-10-21 carved into the tree trunk and recognizes it from a childhood memory of a wooden toy horse. Because replicants' memories are artificial, K's holographic AI girlfriend Joi believes this is evidence that K was born, not created. He searches LAPD records and discovers twins born on that date with identical DNA aside from the sex chromosome, but only the boy is listed as alive. K tracks the child to an orphanage in ruined San Diego but discovers the records from that year to be missing. K recognizes the orphanage from his memories and finds the toy horse where he remembers hiding it. Dr. Ana Stelline, a replicant memory designer, confirms that the memory of the orphanage is real, leading K to conclude that he is Rachael's son. At LAPD headquarters, K fails a post-traumatic baseline test, marking him as a rogue replicant; he lies to Joshi by implying he killed the replicant child. Joshi gives K 48 hours to disappear. At Joi's request, K reluctantly transfers her to a mobile emitter so he cannot be tracked through her console memory-files. He has the toy horse analyzed, revealing traces of radiation that lead him to the ruins of Las Vegas. He finds Deckard, who reveals that he is the father of Rachael's child and that he scrambled the birth records to protect the child's identity; Deckard left the child in the custody of the replicant freedom movement. Luv kills Joshi and tracks K to Las Vegas. She kidnaps Deckard, destroys Joi, and leaves K to die. The replicant freedom movement rescues K. When their leader, Freysa, tells him that she helped deliver Rachael's child and that her child was actually a girl, K understands that he is not Rachael's child, deduces that Stelline is her daughter and that the memory of the toy horse is hers, one she implanted amongst those of other replicants whose memories she designed. To prevent Deckard from leading Wallace to Stelline or the freedom movement, Freysa asks K to kill Deckard for the greater good of all replicants. Luv takes Deckard to Wallace Corporation headquarters to meet Wallace. Wallace offers Deckard a clone of Rachael in exchange for revealing what he knows. Deckard refuses, and the clone is killed. As Luv transports Deckard to be tortured and interrogated off-world, K intercepts Luv's shuttle and tries to rescue Deckard. He fights Luv and manages to drown her, but he is mortally wounded. He stages Deckard's death to protect him from Wallace and the replicant freedom movement before taking Deckard to Stelline's office and handing him her toy horse. As K lies motionless on the steps, looking up at the snowing sky, Deckard enters the building and meets his daughter for the first time. Cast Archival footage, audio and stills of Sean Young from the original film are used to represent both her original character of Rachael and a clone of the character created by Niander Wallace. Young's likeness was digitally superimposed onto Loren Peta, who was coached by Young on how to recreate her performance from the first film. The voice of the replicant was created with the use of a sound-alike actress to Young. Young was credited for her work. Production = Development = Director Denis Villeneuve credits Blade Runner for igniting his passion for filmmaking. From the 1990s, licensing disputes over Philip K. Dick's 1968 novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? had stood in the way of producing sequels to the science fiction drama Blade Runner (1982). Nearly three decades after the film's release, Alcon Entertainment co-founders Andrew Kosove and Broderick Johnson purchased the intellectual property from producer Bud Yorkin. The terms of Alcon's acquisition gave the studio complete ownership of the broadcast and franchise rights to Blade Runner, but excluded the license to reboot the original film. No longer satisfied with the profits of their smaller-budget features, and with investor funding scarce, Kosove and Johnson sought to increase Alcon's output of blockbuster films: \\"If you don't have repetitive cash flow, which is a fancy way of saying being in the sequel business, you are going to be in trouble eventually.\\" Progress on a new Blade Runner feature soon intensified when Kosove named Christopher Nolan one of his ideal choices to direct, although Nolan said he never planned to direct, despite being an admirer of the franchise. By August 2011, Alcon announced Ridley Scott's signing as the film's director to the press. The British filmmaker had long desired a sequel to expand upon the subject matter. After securing Scott's services, the studio assigned Michael Green and a returning Hampton Fancher the responsibility for writing the script. Alcon producers provided some insight of their vision but were unsure of how to approach the Blade Runner story, hence they and the normally candid Scott were tight-lipped when questioned further about the sequel's artistic direction in interviews conducted during the pre-production. Ultimately, Scott resigned from his duties once his existing commitment to Alien: Covenant (2017) took precedence, and retained partial oversight as an executive producer. He also made significant contributions to the screenplay, albeit in an uncredited role. Blade Runner 2049 was Alcon's second collaboration with director Denis Villeneuve, who they called for a meeting at a cafe in rural New Mexico to negotiate an offer. They had an existing professional relationship from Prisoners (2013). Villeneuve credits Blade Runner for inspiring his passion for filmmaking, but hesitated to accept the assignment at first as he feared tarnishing the franchise's legacy. Nevertheless, he liked the screenplay and was assured by Fancher's investment in the project. Villeneuve preserved elements of the original film by modernizing Blade Runner retrofuturistic onscreen world, which he saw imperative for an authentic story. =Casting= Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford promoting the film at the 2017 San Diego Comic- Con International. Harrison Ford and Ryan Gosling were Blade Runner 2049 first significant casting choices. Gossip about Ford's participation had been circulating in the media since the project's conception, claims that the producers initially denied, having only approached the actor for a part in 2014. Alcon did not publicly announce Ford's signing until the following year. Ford expressed interest reprising his role in past interviews and was enthusiastic about the Blade Runner 2049 script. The work environment on set was another aspect of the production Ford was pleased with, a stark contrast from the stressful shooting environment he endured on Blade Runner. He felt the experience playing an older Deckard lent unique context to his character's already-established backstory. Ford stated \\"You're not walking into the stadium. You're on the starting line, and you got there just in time and you're off. It was great. And the story I have to tell flows effortlessly out of the groundwork we've laid before. And it's unanticipated, and it's complicated and it has an emotional context that is just was the bait on the hook for me.\\" The only other returning Blade Runner actor, Edward James Olmos, appears in a bit supporting part which pivots the central story. The screenwriters tailored K specifically for Gosling, but it was the opportunity to work with Villeneuve and experienced cinematographer Roger Deakins, paired with his faith in the script, that convinced the actor to join Blade Runner 2049 in his first leading role in a blockbuster production. Gosling developed a reputation for his discriminating film choices‚Äîthe prospect of working on big-budget franchise sets never enticed him, yet he trusted the filmmakers' instincts, and the thematic complexity of the film's screenplay furthermore reassured his decision. A longtime Blade Runner fan, the actor said his first viewing experience of the film as a young teenager was profound, remarking, \\"It was one of the first films I had seen where it wasn't clear how I was supposed to feel when it was over. It really makes you question your idea of the hero and the villain, the idea of what it means to be human.\\" Blade Runner 2049 proved challenging for Gosling because of the production's scope. Ana de Armas auditioned several times before landing the film's female lead. De Armas was an actress of national renown in Spain aspiring to break into English- speaking roles. After working her first Hollywood film in Hands of Stone (2016), she settled in Los Angeles in pursuit of a role that did not typecast her ethnicity. De Armas underwent four months of vigorous speech training to master her English before auditioning. Once the studio commenced production of Blade Runner 2049, the actress said her fitness training provided the necessary mental space to prepare for the intense shooting schedule. Villeneuve considered David Bowie, one of the franchise's core influences, for the part of Niander Wallace, but the singer died before the start of filming. Instead he and the producers looked at Jared Leto, fresh off the filming of 2016's Suicide Squad, because they felt he exuded Bowie's rockstar sensibility. Leto refrains from naming specific sources that shaped certain aspects of his character's persona, rather the actor cites real-life friends that work in tech as a general influence. Leto is notorious in the film industry for his unorthodox preparation of his roles, and he continued his unusual practices in Blade Runner 2049 by wearing custom opaque contact lenses to work the set completely blind. Villeneuve recalled his first day shooting with the actor, \\"He entered the room, and he could not see at all. He was walking with an assistant, very slowly. It was like seeing Jesus walking into a temple. Everybody became super silent, and there was a kind of sacred moment. Everyone was in awe. It was so beautiful and powerful‚ÄîI was moved to tears.\\" A raft of mostly young actors comprise Blade Runner 2049 supporting cast; David Dastmalchian, Sylvia Hoeks, Carla Juri, Mackenzie Davis and Barkhad Abdi were lesser-known stars with years of expertise in indie cinema. Among the few exceptions are Dave Bautista, Hiam Abbass and Lennie James, whose castings were revealed between April‚ÄìJuly 2016, and Robin Wright, assigned to one of three major female roles in Blade Runner 2049. Wright's participation had been rumored for weeks, but was not immediately confirmed by the filmmakers because her existing duties to Netflix's political TV thriller House of Cards momentarily stalled the negotiations. =Filming= The filmmakers embarked on location scouting in April 2016, and principal photography of Blade Runner 2049 commenced that July, lasting four months until November. They first toured London but found no soundstage available for the needs of the production. As a result, Deakins and Villeneuve flew to Hungary for location scouting partly due to Scott's familiarity of the country's network of facilities. They also toured Slovakia to source architectural ideas. Blade Runner 2049 production crew were mostly Hungarian, with some American staff hired to supervise the set. Inserts with Wright and Hoeks were the first scenes filmed on set. Shooting took place mainly at Korda Studios and the Origo Studios backlot in suburban Budapest, where the shoot qualified for a 25% tax rebate on in-state costs from the Hungarian government. The Alcon‚ÄìSony partnership allocated $180 million ($90 million each) for the budget, rebates notwithstanding. Interior shots of the Budapest Stock Exchange's Liberty Square palace doubled for Las Vegas in casino-set scenes, and abandoned Soviet industrial sites such as the Inota Power Plant and the Kelenf√∂ld were important filming locations that emphasized Blade Runner 2049 dystopian ethos. The Budapest palace was the film's largest set, occupying at least three floors of the building. Filmmakers revised Deckard's capture by Luv into a simple conversational scene after Ford conveyed to Kosove and Johnson of his disapproval of the dialogue. Pitfalls occasionally beset the production. The filmmakers frequently fell behind schedule, and an Origo Studios-employed subcontractor was killed by falling debris when dismantling one of the sets. Gosling's obligation to fulfill a New York City press junket for La La Land (2016) exacerbated the unusual circumstances of the shoot; however, his scenes were able to be filmed in time for the Thanksgiving holiday. =Cinematography= Blade Runner 2049 is the third Deakins‚ÄìVilleneuve collaboration after Prisoners and Sicario (2015). Deakins was eager to work another fantasy project despite an unpleasant experience working the 1990 film Air America. Together with production designer Dennis Gassner, the men brainstormed ideas for the film's visual palette as Villeneuve was editing his science fiction drama Arrival (2016). The sequences were then storyboarded and left for Deakins and Villeneuve to execute. They were inspired by the architecture of several major cities, intending to craft an imposing brutalist character for the urban landscape of a cold, wet Los Angeles, among them the appearance of Beijing's cityscape in dense smog, the foothills of southern Spain, Bangladeshi shipyards, and certain mid-century landmarks in London (such as the Barbican Estate and Trellick Tower). For Las Vegas-set scenes, the filmmakers researched intense dust storms in the Sahara, Saudi Arabia and Sydney to replicate the sandy desert ruins Villeneuve sought for. It became apparent to Deakins that Blade Runner 2049 would be one of his biggest undertakings because of the technical demands involved realizing the onscreen universe. Deakins exercises full artistic control of his shoots, and the extent of his oversight meant a single-camera setup for the set‚Äîthe British cinematographer rejected a studio line producer's request for a nine unit-camera setup because he firmly believed said technique would yield sloppy camerawork. Rather he and Villeneuve resumed the practical approach of their previous collaborations to capture the Blade Runner 2049 scenes. They shot the project in 1.55:1 aspect ratio from a single Arri Alexa XT Studio camera with Zeiss Master prime lenses, assisted with an attached crane arm or a dolly. The filmmakers conducted tests with an Alexa 65 camera but preferred the XT Studio's somewhat grainy image quality, and the choice of lenses corresponded to the scale and lighting specifications of the scenes. For example, close-up character scenes were captured in 32 mm lenses, but filmmakers captured sweeping cityscape shots with 14 mm and 16 mm lenses. Occasionally, production filmed with Arri Alexa Mini cameras to capture shots from the spinners, the vehicles used in the film. Spinner on display at the Petersen Automotive Museum, Los Angeles When Gassner was first approached for Blade Runner 2049, he was called with a request from Villeneuve to observe the shape of passing street sweepers. Redesigning the spinners then became one of his initial responsibilities. He and the filmmakers envisioned a harsh, angular look for the spinners, one intended to evoke a sense of technological advancement. It was also up to Gassner to complete most of the Blade Runner 2049 sets so producers could exercise full artistic control of the shoot. Gassner had known Scott since 1982, when they had been introduced on the set of the Francis Ford Coppola-directed musical One From the Heart. The designer saw developing a distinct identity for Blade Runner 2049 while keeping consistent with the franchise ethos to be difficult despite his experience working franchise films. He said, \\"So you have to be respectful of the world that was already created and integrate that original aesthetic, but also create individuality and stand-alone visuals for the people who haven‚Äôt seen the original. It's kind of like you're sitting on the edge of a knife blade.\\" =Costumes= Costume designer Ren√©e April produced costumes featuring fake fur, painted cotton disguised as shearling, and breathing masks. April initially researched the fashion styles of the 1960s and 1970s, but elected to research various decades for influence as well as both Eastern and Western culture. When discussing the film, she stated she did not consider it a fashionable one. \\"I made costumes for the dark, wet, polluted, miserable world that Denis [Villeneuve] created. I had to hold myself back and remove anything too avant- garde or outr√© because it did not help the story. There were no superhero suits because the world needed to be realistic, and the characters relatable.\\" When April discussed the film with Villenueve about what direction she should take the costumes, Villenueve told her \\"brutal\\", a similar description he gave to Gassner. \\"So I took it from there and made it tougher. Also, we did not want to do something science-fiction. We wanted to do it realistic. I did not want costumes with [lots of] zippers and plastic. So my job was to make the characters believable.\\" =Post-production= Warner Bros. announced in early October 2016 that the film would be titled Blade Runner 2049. Editing commenced in December in Los Angeles, with the intention of having the film being rated R. At the 2017 San Diego Comic-Con, Villeneuve said that the film would run for two hours and 32 minutes. There originally existed a four-hour early cut of the film that Villeneuve described \\"quite strong\\" but also at times \\"too self-indulgent\\". He prefers the shorter final version that he describes as \\"more elegant\\" and which Ridley Scott still described as too long. Villeneuve says he will not show the four-hour cut to anyone. As with Skyfall, cinematographer Roger Deakins created his own IMAX master of the film rather than using the proprietary \\"DMR\\" process that IMAX usually uses with films not shot with IMAX cameras. =Soundtrack= Rapper-producer El-P said he was asked to compose music for the first Blade Runner 2049 trailer, but his score was \\"rejected or ignored\\". J√≥hann J√≥hannsson, who had worked with Villeneuve on Prisoners, Sicario and Arrival, was initially announced as composer for the film. However, Villeneuve and J√≥hannsson decided to end the collaboration because Villeneuve thought the film \\"needed something different\\", and also that he \\"needed to go back to something closer to Vangelis's soundtrack\\" of the first film. Composers Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch joined the project in July 2017. In September, J√≥hannsson's agent confirmed that he was no longer involved and was contractually forbidden from commenting. The musical cue during the final scene, \\"Tears in the Rain\\", is a call-back to the \\"Tears in rain\\" scene from Blade Runner which saw the death of the film's central antagonist Roy Batty. The track is a reimagined version of the original Vangelis work. Release =Premieres= Birmingham New Street Station, October 2017 Blade Runner 2049 premiered on October 3, 2017, at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles, although following the 2017 Las Vegas Strip shooting, the red carpet events were canceled prior to the screening. It was the opening feature at the Festival du nouveau cin√©ma in Montreal the following day. It also was premiered in Switzerland at the Zurich Film Festival on October 4, 2017. Sony Pictures Releasing, which had obtained rights to release the film in overseas territories, was the first to release Blade Runner 2049 in theaters, first in France and Belgium on October 4, 2017, then in other countries on the two following days. The film was released by Warner Bros. in North America on October 6, 2017. In addition to standard 2D and 3D formats, Blade Runner 2049 was released in IMAX theaters. Also, Alcon Entertainment partnered with Oculus VR to create and distribute content for the film exclusively for its virtual reality format and launched it alongside the theatrical release of October 6, 2017. That content would later be referred to as Blade Runner: Revelations. Due to the popularity and preference of IMAX in 2D (as opposed to 3D) among filmgoers in North America, the film was shown in IMAX theaters in only 2D domestically, but was screened in 3D formats internationally. Just like Skyfall, the movie was specially formatted for IMAX at the expanded aspect ratio of 1.9:1. The film is rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America for \\"violence, some sexuality, nudity, and language\\". Some scenes in the film were censored in Turkey. The scenes that featured nudity were cut. This decision received criticism from the country's film critics. = Prequels= Warner Bros. and Columbia Pictures jointly released an announcement teaser on December 19, 2016. A selection of excerpts (lasting 15 seconds) were released as a trailer tease on May 5, 2017, in the lead up to the full trailer, which was released on May 8, 2017. A second trailer was released on July 17, 2017. Three short films were made to explore events that occur in the 30-year period between Blade Runner 2049 and Blade Runner, set in 2019: * 2036: Nexus Dawn is directed by Luke Scott, and follows Niander Wallace as he presents a new Nexus-9 replicant to lawmakers in an attempt to have a prohibition on replicants lifted. The short film also stars Benedict Wong as one of the lawmakers. * 2048: Nowhere to Run, also directed by Scott, follows Sapper Morton as he protects a mother and daughter from thugs. * Blade Runner Black Out 2022, is an anime directed by Shinichir≈ç Watanabe wherein a rogue replicant named Iggy carries out an operation to detonate a nuclear warhead over Los Angeles, triggering an electromagnetic pulse that erases the Tyrell Corporation's database of registered replicants. Edward James Olmos reprises his role as Gaff in this film. Flying Lotus composed the soundtrack; Watanabe had used his music as a temp score in making a rough cut of the short. =Home media= The film was released on DVD, Blu- ray, Blu-ray 3D and 4K Blu-ray on January 16, 2018 and distributed by Netflix and Redbox on January 23, 2018. It made approximately $26 million in US physical home media sales. Reception =Box office= Blade Runner 2049 grossed $92.1 million in the United States and Canada, and $168.4 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $260.5 million, against a production budget between $150‚Äì185 million. The projected worldwide total the film needed to gross in order to break even was estimated to be around $400 million, and in November 2017 The Hollywood Reporter wrote that the film was expected to lose the studio as much as $80 million. Ridley Scott attributed the film's underperformance to the runtime, saying: \\"It's slow. Long. Too long. I would have taken out half an hour.\\" In the United States and Canada, the film was initially projected to gross $43‚Äì47 million in its opening weekend. In September 2017, a survey from Fandango indicated that the film was one of the most anticipated releases of the season. It made $4 million from Thursday night previews, including $800,000 from IMAX theaters, but just $12.6 million on its first day, lowering weekend estimates to $32 million. It made $11.4 million on Saturday and went on to debut to $31.5 million, well below initial projections but still finishing first at the box office and marking the biggest openings of Villeneuve and Gosling's careers. Regarding the opening weekend, director Villeneuve said, \\"It's a mystery. All the indexes and marketing tools they were using predicted that it would be a success. The film was acclaimed by critics. So everyone expected the first weekend's results to be impressive, and they were shocked. They still don't understand.\\" Deadline Hollywood attributed the film's performance to the 163-minute runtime limiting the number of showtimes theaters could have, lack of appeal to mainstream audiences, and the marketing being vague and relying on nostalgia and established fanbase to carry it. In its second weekend, the film dropped 52.7% to $15.5 million, finishing second behind newcomer Happy Death Day ($26 million) and dropped another 54% in its third weekend to $7.2 million, finishing in 4th behind Boo 2! A Madea Halloween, Geostorm and Happy Death Day. Overseas, it was expected to debut to an additional $60 million, for a worldwide opening of around $100 million. The debut ended up making $50.2 million internationally, finishing number one in 45 markets, for a global opening of $81.7 million. It made $8 million in the United Kingdom, $4.9 million in Russia, $1.8 million in Brazil and $3.6 million in Australia. It debuted in China on October 27, and made $7.7 million in its opening weekend, which was considered a disappointment. =Critical response= Roger Deakins' work on the film received critical acclaim and would lead to his first ever Academy Award for Best Cinematography win. Blade Runner 2049 was well received by the American press, and various US publications included the film in their end-of-2017 lists. Critical reviews compared the sequel favorably to Blade Runner as a worthy successor advancing the franchise mythos, though some were conflicted over the pacing and tonal shifts of the story, and the film drew occasional disapproval from reviewers who felt it lacked the spectacle and dramatic depth of its predecessor. The film's craftsmanship was the main source of praise from journalists, who routinely singled out Villeneuve for his expertise: The New York Times A. O. Scott viewed Blade Runner 2049 as an introspection of Villeneuve's own sensibilities, the product of a director exuding an \\"unnerving calm\\", while San Francisco Chronicle Mick LaSalle said the film seemed to employ a similar narrative tone to the director's late period films such as Arrival. The Villeneuve‚ÄìDeakins collaboration was noted for the creation of cinematography displaying \\"the kind of complex artistry one would expect from the profession's top veteran\\", with Deakins' work described as \\"bleakly beautiful\\". Other aspects of Blade Runner 2049, such as the set design, writing, and scoring, were cited among the strengths of the film. The actors' performances was a principal topic of discussion among critics. Critiques of the dynamic of the cast were positive in the media, and reviewers often distinguished Gosling, Ford, and Wright for further praise. Gosling's work was described as \\"superb, soulful\\", physically convincing as a replicant in his expression and appearance, whereas The Hollywood Reporter and Empire magazine were among those that believed Ford worked a career-best performance. Other journalists, such as Peter Travers of Rolling Stone, viewed the two men as \\"double dynamite\\" in conversational scenes, in which the film assumes \\"a resonance that is both tragic and hopeful\\". One particular point of contention in Blade Runner 2049 was characterization: some critics, for example, saw K's romance with Joi as an idea of unrealized potential because the film explores their relationship only superficially, so Joi never seems to develop into a fleshed out character. The harshest reviews criticized the film's depiction of its female characters in submissive roles. The fate of K in the closing scenes of the film has been a matter of debate; some critics have suggested that his demise is open to interpretation, as it is not explicitly stated in the film that K has died. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, screenwriter Michael Green expressed surprise that K's death had been called into question, referring to the use of the \\"Tears in rain\\" musical motif in the final scene. The question of whether Deckard is a human or a replicant has been an ongoing controversy since the original release of Blade Runner. Ridley Scott has stated that Deckard was a replicant, however, others, including Harrison Ford, disagree, and feel preserving the ambiguity of Deckard's status important to the film. Blade Runner 2049 draws no conclusion to this debate. During various physical struggles, Deckard showed no sign of artificial replicant strength; however, Gaff described Deckard to K as \\"retired\\"; and replicant maker Niander Wallace tells Deckard that \\"You are a wonder to me, Mr. Deckard\\", and that he might have been \\"designed\\" to fall in love with Rachael. As of October 2020, on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film had an approval rating of 88% based on 435 reviews, with an average rating of 8.24/10. The website's critical consensus read, \\"Visually stunning and narratively satisfying, Blade Runner 2049 deepens and expands its predecessor's story while standing as an impressive filmmaking achievement in its own right.\\" As of October 2020, Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 81 out of 100, based on 54 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". Critics who saw the film before its release were asked by Villeneuve not to reveal certain characters and plot points.Klimek, Chris - 'Blade Runner 2049': Even Sharper Than The Original . NPS, September 29, 2017 Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"A‚àí\\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it a 78% overall positive score and a 60% \\"definite recommend\\". Social commentary Reviewing the film for Vice, Charlotte Gush was critical of its portrayal of women, whom she said were \\"either prostitutes, holographic housewives\\" or victims dying brutal deaths. While acknowledging that \\"misogyny was part of the dystopia\\" in Scott's 1982 original, she stated that the sequel was \\"eye-gougingly sexist\\". Writing for The Guardian, Anna Smith expressed similar concerns, stating that \\"sexualised images of women dominate the stunning futuristic cityscapes\\" and questioned whether the film catered heavily to heterosexual men. Rachael Kaines of Moviepilot countered that \\"the gender politics in Blade Runner 2049 are intentional\\": \\"The movie is about secondary citizens. Replicants. Orphans. Women. Slaves. Just by depicting these secondary citizens in subjugation doesn't mean that it is supportive of these depictions ‚Äì they are a condemnation.\\" Helen Lewis of the New Statesman suggested that the film is \\"an uneasy feminist parable about controlling the means of reproduction\\" and that \\"its villain, Niander Wallace, is consumed by rage that women can do something he cannot\\": > Fertility is the perfect theme for the dystopia of Blade Runner 2049, > because of the western elite anxiety that over-educated, over-liberated > women are having fewer children, or choosing to opt out of childbearing > altogether.

Another is to take flight and > find another exploitable class to replace human females ... Maybe androids > don't dream of electric sheep, but some human men certainly dream of > electric wombs. In an interview with Vanity Fair, Denis Villeneuve responded that he is very sensitive about his portrayal of women: \\"Blade Runner is not about tomorrow; it's about today. And I'm sorry, but the world is not kind on women.\\" Quoting from the Variety magazine breakdown of viewer demographics for the film, Donald Clarke for The Irish Times indicated that female audiences seemed alienated from it; just 8% of its audiences were females under 25.Clarke, Donald (October 9, 2017). \\"Where did it all go wrong for Blade Runner 2049?],\\" The Irish Times. Esquire magazine commented on the controversial aspects of the sex scene ‚Äî involving K, the holographic Joi and replicant Mariette ‚Äî calling it a \\"robo-m√©nage √† trois\\", and compared it to the sex scene between Joaquin Phoenix and Scarlett Johansson in Her (2013).Miller, Matt (October 9, 2017). \\"Blade Runner 2049's Wild and Haunting Sex Scene Will Have People Talking About It for Years\\" , Esquire magazine. Mackenzie Davis, who portrayed Mariette, argued for the self-awareness of the film's social commentary in an interview with website Refinery29. Asked how she believed Blade Runner 2049 \\"differs [from Blade Runner] in its portrayal of women?\\", Davis responded that: > I think it‚Äôs pretty self-aware about a pornographic economy that has reduced > the roles of women to sheer consumption. The normalisation of women‚Äôs roles > as things to be consumed, there‚Äôs products that are made, just like there > are now, the idea of the semi-sentient sex doll is really in line with > what‚Äôs going on in this Blade Runner universe, about having a thing that > fulfills everything you want, but doesn‚Äôt talk back and can‚Äôt argue with > you, but can be a loving supporting companion and also fulfill all your > sexual needs feels like something that‚Äôs very contemporary and something the > movie is very self-aware about.

But there isn‚Äôt a lot of upward mobility.Cohen, Anne > (October 7, 2017). \\"Is Blade Runner 2049 Good For Women? We Asked Mackenzie > Davis\\" , Refinery29. = Accolades = Blade Runner 2049 has received numerous awards and nominations. At the 90th Academy Awards, it was nominated for five awards, winning Best Cinematography for Deakins, and Best Visual Effects. At the 71st British Academy Film Awards, it received eight nominations, including Best Director, and won for Best Cinematography and Best Special Visual Effects. At the 23rd Critics' Choice Awards, it was nominated for seven awards, winning for Best Cinematography.  Future  During the promotional tour for the 2015 film The Martian, Scott expressed interest in making additional Blade Runner films. In October 2017, Villeneuve said that he expected a third film would be made if 2049 was successful. Fancher, who wrote both films, said he was considering reviving an old story idea involving Deckard traveling to another country. Ford said that he would be open to returning if he liked the script. In January 2018, Scott stated that he had \\"another [story] ready to evolve and be developed, [that] there is certainly one to be done for sure\\", referring to a third Blade Runner film. In January 2020, Villeneuve expressed interest in \\"revisit[ing] this universe in a different way,\\" making \\"something disconnected from both other movies,\\" as opposed to a direct sequel.

Life His background was in business. In the autumn of 1767, with George Colman the elder, John Rutherford, and William Powell, he purchased from John Beard the patent of Covent Garden Theatre. The theatre opened 14 September 1767, with The Rehearsal, in which Powell spoke a prologue by William Whitehead. Colman took on a management role, but a serious quarrel broke outbetween Harris and Colman arose during the first season, driven by the ambitions of Jane Lessingham, an actress with whom Harris lived. Colman, with whom Powell sided, barricaded the theatre, and Harris, supported by Rutherford, broke it forcibly open. Legal proceedings and a pamphlet war followed. On 23 July 1770 a legal decision of the commissioners of the Great Seal reinstated Colman as acting manager, subject to the advice and inspection, but not the control, of his fellows. Powell meanwhile had died 3 July 1769. On the resignation, 26 May 1774, by Colman of his post, Harris undertook the duties of stage-manager, which he held to until his death. He was accused of sacrificing to spectacle the artistic interests of the drama. He behaved generously to actors, however, and maintained a good reputation and some personal popularity. Harris died on 1 October 1820 at his cottage near Wimbledon, and was buried in his family vault at Hillingdon, near Uxbridge. Family A daughter of Harris died in 1802, aged 15, and a son, George, lived to be a captain in the Royal Navy. A sister of Harris married into the family of Longmans, the publishers.
