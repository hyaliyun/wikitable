She was lead vocalist for twelve years for the musical group Algo Simple before going solo. She is best known for her video America which has been used in PBS documentaries. As an actress, she played the lead role in Texas Legacies for the 2003 season. Early life She is one of ten children of Camilo Espinoza, Jr., and Maria Guadalupe Orozco Espinoza. Her first performance was at the age of six with her father, who performed with Bob Wills, Marlon Brando, and The Lennon Sisters. Her love for music and stage grew. In high school, she received the Louis Armstrong Jazz Award for vocals. Carmen attended Texas Tech in Lubbock and West Texas A&M; University in Canyon and received her degree in the study of Montessori Education in 1997. Career Espinoza-Rodriquez was asked to be the lead vocalist for Hacienda Records artist, Algo Simple. After a twelve-year span with Algo Simple, she decided to go solo. It was at this turning point when she was recommended by CMA Award-winning singer-songwriter Susan Gibson (writer \\"Wide Open Spaces\\") to appear on a PBS video documentary. Inspired, she recorded an original composition and shot a video entitled America that has since been featured in two PBS documentaries; Celebrate America! and Southwest Expressions. Past members of her band include Robin Brannon from the Christian vocal group Acappella (group). Espinoza-Rodriquez was invited to record and perform as a special guest with the WTAMU Jazz Ensemble. During this time, she was approached to go on tour with Texas X-press, an outreach touring troupe for the outdoor musical drama Texas Legacies. It was during the tour that she was asked by the executive producer of Texas Legacies to take on the lead role (and was the first minority to be offered a lead role) as Maria Hinojosa' in Texas Legacies. Carmen accepted the role for the 2003 season. Since then, she has shared the stage with country artists including Lee Roy Van Dyke, Steve Wariner, Restless Heart, Holly Dunn, and Michael Martin Murphey.

Her original builder, Benjamin Tanner, became bankrupt during her construction, so John Cock completed her. In 1810 she was reclassed as a 20-gun sixth rate ship (but without being re-armed); in 1817 she was again re-rated, this time as 26 guns. She served primarily in the Indian Ocean. In 1810 she participated in the Invasion of Isle de France. The next year Hesper participated in the capture of Java, which she followed in 1812 by capturing Timor. She was sold in 1817. Service G. Aklom commissioned Hesper in March 1807. However, Hesper was not launched until 1809 and did not enter service until 1809. Captain George Hoare was appointed to Hesper in 1809, commissioned her in August and sailed for the Indian Ocean on 9 October.The National Maritime Museum database has Edward Wallis Hoare commissioning Hesper and W. Buchanan sailing her to the East Indies, but that information applies to and also appears on her record. In October 1810 Commander David Paterson took command. Hesper captured Mouche No.28 on 15 November 1810 near √éle Bonaparte (R√©union) as she was carrying dispatches to the √éle de France. A boarding party in Hespers cutter suffered three men wounded while boarding Mouche; French casualties were two men killed and five wounded, one of whom was Mouche No.28s commander. The British recommissioned her for the attack on √éle de France.Winfield and Roberts (2015), p. 253. Hesper was detailed for service with the squadron under Admiral Albemarle Bertie engaged in the invasion of Isle de France (Mauritius). Bertie set Hesper and to join the group blockading Port Louis. While she was there, she and the government armed ship Emma, Lieutenant B. Street commanding, performed a useful reconnaissance taking soundings at night of the anchorage on the coast, a service for which Bertie commended them.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 25, pp.164-170. They identified a place in a narrow strait between an islet called the Gunner's Coin and the beach where the fleet could anchor and where boats could land through an opening in the reef.Asiatic journal and monthly miscellany for British and foreign India, China, Australasia (1836), Vol 36, p. 157. The island surrendered on 3 December. In September 1814 prize money was paid to the officers and crews of the vessels that had been present at the capture of Isle de France. Following the successful invasion, Hesper was at the centre of a dispute between Admiral Bertie and Admiral William O'Bryen Drury whose commands overlapped. Bertie appointed Lieutenant Edward Lloyd to command Hesper and he sailed her back to Bombay with Major-General John Abercrombie and his staff as passengers.Gentleman's magazine, Vol. 44, p.316. There Lloyd found out that Drury had appointed Barrington Reynolds to command her. Although Drury died before the dispute was settled, Reynolds was confirmed in command.Marshall (1830), Supplement, Part 4, pp.306-7. On 5 January 1811, Hesper was one of six ships that shared in the capture of Mouche. French records report that Mouche No.27 was captured on 12 January at the entrance to Port Napol√©on (Port Louis, √éle de France) by a British frigate flying the French flag. Later in 1811, Hesper was attached to the squadron of Admiral Robert Stopford that captured Java. On 31 August the frigates Nisus, President, and Phoebe, and Hesper were detached to take the seaport of Cheribon.James (1837), vol.VI, pp.38-9. Reynolds received a promotion to Post-captain, confirmed the next year, for his role. In 1847 the Admiralty authorized the issuance of the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \\"Java\\" to all remaining survivors of the campaign. In February 1812 command passed to Charles Thomas Thurston, who was blown by a storm to Timor, which had been out on contact with Europe for two years. Thurston was able to persuade the Dutch garrison there to surrender and captured the island without fighting.Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine Vol. III, June 1818, article on pages 306-312, The Taking of the Island of Timor by the H.M.S. Hesper in 1811 Thurston was later invalided home. Lieutenant Henry Theodosius Browne Collier took command on 30 June 1812, but he too was invalided home before the confirmation of his promotion to Commander on 24 October 1812.O'Byrne (1849), p.216. Command then passed to Commander Joseph Prior. As a lieutenant, he had transferred to Hesper in 1809.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 22, p.263.William Bland was Hespers surgeon while she was at Bombay, India. He became involved in a wardroom argument with Robert Case the purser. In the duel, which took place on 7 April 1813, Bland killed Case. In October Hesper was in the Persian Gulf, delivering despatches to Bushire for the British ambassador at Teheran. She then visited Abu Dhabi. Captain Charles Biddulph replaced Prior in August 1812 and served until 22 April 1815, when he died. Before he died 22 May 1815, aged 29,The Gentleman's magazine, Vol. 118, p.634. he charted the four Biddulph's Islands (or Biddulph Group), which lie on the Arabian side of the Persian Gulf. Hesper was without a captain for a while and then on 20 September 1815 Michael Matthews was made Commander on Hesper.Marshall (1833), Vol. 4, Part 1, p.401. Commander Robert Campbell (acting) was his replacement. In 1816 Commander William Everard (acting) replaced Campbell. Fate Hesper was sold in 1817.

As a New Deal official she helped shape the modern American welfare state. She was inducted into the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame in 1986.Colorado Women's Hall of Fame, Josephine Aspinwall Roche Life She was born in Neligh, Nebraska, and raised in Omaha, attending private girls' schools there before matriculating at Vassar College in 1904. There she double-majored in economics and classics, and participated in basketball and track clubs. After graduating in 1908, Roche earned a master's degree in social work in 1910 from Columbia University. In 1906 her parents, John and Ella Roche, moved to Denver, where much of her life's work would be centered. Roche volunteered for social causes in both New York City and Denver, studied cost of living issues, and in 1912 returned to Denver full-time to become that city's first female police officer. However, her tenure there was short-lived, as her zealous prosecution of sumptuary laws and prostitution caused the city's more lenient law enforcement community to force her resignation. Over the following decade, Roche held a number of jobs in Denver and Washington, D.C., including serving as chair of the Colorado Progressive Party and campaigning against child labor in the sugar beet industry. While in Washington, she was briefly married to author Edward Hale Bierstadt, a colleague at the Foreign Language Information Service, of which she was the director; the marriage lasted from 1920 to 1922 and ended in divorce. In 1925, she returned to Colorado due to her father's failing health, and in 1927 inherited his holdings in the Rocky Mountain Fuel Company, a coal mining company which he had founded. By 1929, she had purchased a majority interest in the company and become president. She then proceeded to enact a variety of pro-labor policies, including an invitation for the United Mine Workers of America to return to Colorado and unionize her mines, 15 years after her father and other coal mine owners had broken the unions in the aftermath of the Ludlow Massacre of 1914. Roche left Rocky Mountain Fuel in 1934 to run for Governor of Colorado. After being defeated in the Democratic Party primary by Edwin C. Johnson, president Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed her as Assistant Secretary of the Treasury. She held that post from 1934 until 1937, when she resigned to return to Colorado and run Rocky Mountain Fuel following the death of its president. However, the company was too much impacted by a variety of economic forces, and declared bankruptcy in 1944. The company was ordered by bankruptcy court to liquidate assets and all mines ceased operation but the liquidation was not completed. Roche continued in control of the defunct company and the remaining assets and moved to Washington, D.C. Roche became president of Rocky Mountain Fuel Company in 1950 and maintained control of the company's non-liquidated assets until her death in 1976. Beginning in 1948, Roche served as one of three directors of the United Mine Workers' welfare and retirement fund. In 1968, the union and its leadership were sued for mismanagement of the fund. The mismanagement charge was eventually proven in court, forcing Roche to step down in 1971. Over the course of her life, Roche was honored by a number of business and civic organizations, and received honorary degrees from Smith College, Oglethorpe University, Mount Holyoke College, and the University of Colorado. Welfare reform Roche was a leader in health care reform, but organized efforts to launch national health insurance in failed repeatedly‚Äîmost notably in 1916, 1938‚Äì40, and 1943. Roche headed the New Deal insurance campaign in 1938-40, which had the best chance of success. From her position as Roosevelt's assistant secretary of the treasury, Roche led an interdepartmental study team and convened a 1938 conference to address national health. However, after the conference, Roosevelt withdrew his support. The major legislation proposed by the liberal leader in the Senate, Robert F. Wagner, died in 1940 in the face of opposition from the Conservative coalition. Opposition from the American Medical Association and private insurance companies was intense. Historian C. Richard Mulcahy argues that Roche herself was responsible for the 1938-40 failure. She did not try to develop a national support base and she did not provide a rationale for establishing health care as a national right.C. Richard Mulcahy, \\"Working Against The Odds: Josephine Roche, the New Deal, and the Drive for National Health Insurance.\\" Maryland Historian (1994) 25#2 pp 1-21 Reformers hoped Roche would become the administrator of the new Federal Security Agency in 1939, but President Franklin Roosevelt passed her over. Her poor performance in building support for national health insurance annoyed FDR. She had wide contacts but they worked at cross purposes and there was no self-contained and unified female network.Robyn Muncy, \\"Women, Gender, and Politics in the New Deal Government: Josephine Roche and the Federal Security Agency.\\" Journal of Women's History (2009) 21#3 pp 60-83.

The three-part series was broadcast on consecutive nights from 22 to 24 December 2008. It was written and co-produced by actor and writer Mark Gatiss,BBC Press Release who found fame in the BBC series The League of Gentlemen. The three linked episodes form an anthology story, influenced by the writings of M. R. James and Amicus horror movies, and a MƒÅori death-mask belonging to Gatiss. They concern the ghostly secrets of fictional Geap Manor, a recently demolished Tudor mansion.Radio Times December 2008 The first story, \\"The Wainscoting\\", is set in the late 18th century. Gatiss plays a museum curator who is given a strange door-knocker, which inspires him to share his dark researches into the Manor. The first tale related the story of Joseph Bloxham, who buys and improves the Manor after capitalising on an investment which ruined his fellow speculators. Strange noises are heard behind the newly installed wainscoting, the wood of which came from the gallows known as 'Tyburn Tree'. The second story, \\"Something Old\\", takes place in the 1920s, where, at the Manor, a lavish costume ball is being held. During the ball young Felix de Momery announces his engagement to Ruth, much to the surprise and annoyance of his grandmother and his friends, Billy and Katherine. The young couple's future seems to be inextricably linked with another tragic wedding day and a ghostly bride who haunts the corridors. In the third episode, \\"The Knocker\\", Ben himself discovers that, even though demolished, Geap Manor continues to cast a long shadow. Recently split from his girlfriend, he finds the cosy blandness of his modern house suddenly altered by events from the distant past, and by the sinister figure of Sir Roger Widdowson.

Sidon introduced the concept in his investigations of Fourier series. The main problem in the study of Sidon sequences, posed by Sidon,. Addendum, 19 (1944), 208. is to find the largest number of elements a Sidon sequence A can have smaller than some given number x. Despite a large body of research,. the question remained unsolved. Early results Paul Erd≈ës and P√°l Tur√°n proved that, for every x > 0, the number of elements smaller than x in a Sidon sequence is at most \\\\sqrt{x}+O(\\\\sqrt[4]{x}). Using a construction of J. Singer, they showed that there exist Sidon sequences that contain \\\\sqrt{x}(1-o(1)) terms less than x. Infinite Sidon sequences Erd≈ës also showed that if we consider any particular infinite Sidon sequence A and let A(x) denote the number of its elements up to x, then : \\\\liminf_{x \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\frac{A(x)\\\\sqrt{\\\\log x}}{\\\\sqrt{x}}\\\\leq 1. That is, infinite Sidon sequences are thinner than the densest finite Sidon sequences. For the other direction, Chowla and Mian observed that the greedy algorithm gives an infinite Sidon sequence with A(x)>c\\\\sqrt[3]{x} for every x.. Ajtai, Koml√≥s, and Szemer√©di improved this with a construction. of a Sidon sequence with : A(x)>\\\\sqrt[3]{x\\\\log x}. The best lower bound to date was given by Imre Z. Ruzsa, who proved. that a Sidon sequence with : A(x)>x^{\\\\sqrt{2}-1-o(1)} exists. Erd≈ës conjectured that an infinite Sidon set A exists for which A(x)>x^{1/2-o(1)} holds. He and R√©nyi showed. the existence of a sequence {a0,a1,...} with the conjectural density but satisfying only the weaker property that there is a constant k such that for every natural number n there are at most k solutions of the equation ai \\\\+ aj = n. (To be a Sidon sequence would require that k = 1.) Erd≈ës further conjectured that there exists a nonconstant integer-coefficient polynomial whose values at the natural numbers form a Sidon sequence. Specifically, he asked if the set of fifth powers is a Sidon set. Ruzsa came close to this by showing that there is a real number c with 0 < c < 1 such that the range of the function f(x) = x5 \\\\+ [cx4] is a Sidon sequence, where [.] denotes integer part. As c is irrational, this function f(x) is not a polynomial. The statement that the set of fifth powers is a Sidon set is a special case of the later conjecture of Lander, Parkin and Selfridge. Relationship to Golomb rulers All finite Sidon sets are Golomb rulers, and vice versa. To see this, suppose for a contradiction that S is a Sidon set and not a Golomb ruler. Since it is not a Golomb ruler, there must be four members such that a_i-a_j=a_k-a_l. It follows that a_i+a_l=a_k+a_j, which contradicts the proposition that S is a Sidon set. Therefore all Sidon sets must be Golomb rulers. By a similar argument, all Golomb rulers must be Sidon sets.

He has created Cercle Franco Americain, The French Workshop for Children, The Language Workshop For Children, and the French Language Salon. Thibaut has proved that students of different ages (toddlers, children, adults) require a different approach to language learning. For toddlers and children, language immersion in a structured play group on a regular basis triggers the process of learning. Adults learn best by focusing on conversations that integrate conjugation and grammar into the conversation, as well as the value of French culture, its sociability, and its sense of hospitality. This led to the creation of language education materials, including original songs, games, books, and the ‚ÄúProfessor Toto‚Äù video series. In 2019, the French Minist√®re de l‚ÄôEducation Nationale honored Thibaut with the Chevalier de l‚Äô Ordre des Palmes Acad√©miques (Order of Academic Palms) for his contribution to French language and culture. The Palmes Acad√©miques is a national order bestowed by the French government to distinguished academics and figures in the world of culture and education, and to educators who have contributed to the expansion of the French language and culture in the world. '''  Detailed Bio  Fran√ßois Thibaut is a researcher and French language teacher for children and adults. Thibaut has always been fascinated by how people speaking different languages interact with one another. At the age of 6, Francois was enrolled in an international boarding school where most of his classmates had different citizenships. Dozens of citizenships, in fact. Thibaut noticed that each time a new student arrived at the boarding school, their French language integration process followed a certain pattern. For the first few months, the student listened passively. Then they began to speak French spontaneously. Their spoken French continued to improve as time went on, thanks to formal instruction in the classroom combined with conversational practice with friends at the boarding school. Thibaut made an additional observation that shaped his later career: The younger the foreign students were when they arrived at the boarding school, the easier it was for them to learn French. Their passive listening phase was shorter, and they began speaking French spontaneously much sooner. Later, Thibaut enrolled in college at the Sorbonne in Paris with the intention of becoming an English language teacher. Then he was awarded a language teaching internship in the United States. His arrival in New York City was a life-changing experience! When Thibaut arrived there in 1972, he was 23 years old. He was excited to start teaching French to adults, but no matter how much effort he put into teaching and no matter how involved the students were, they could not lose their native accents. This was a completely different situation from the one that Thibaut remembered from the French boarding school, where young children quickly began to speak French with a perfect accent. He decided to create a French teaching method for young children only, which he designed especially for the ones who could not speak their own language yet. He pioneered the first French language immersion program for babies and toddlers in New York (The French Language Workshop). At the time, no other school offered language classes for children under the age of 6, although the ages between 3 and 6 are now acknowledged as the ‚Äúwindows of opportunity‚Äù for language learning. A few years later, The French Language Workshop became The Language Workshop For Children. Thibaut also conducted extensive research in neurolinguistics based on Eric Lenneberg‚Äôs work (Biological Foundations of Language ‚Äì 1967). He determined that it was possible for a child to start learning a foreign language even before beginning to speak their own native language. At the time, this theory was generally viewed as silly. Thibaut first opened the French Language Workshop, teaching only French. A few years later, it became The Language Workshop For Children, where other languages such as Spanish and Italian were taught by native speakers trained in the ‚ÄúThibaut Technique\\". For more than ten years, Thibaut closely observed his students‚Äô progress. He noticed that subtle details related to the way he engaged children emotionally had a significant impact on their ability to learn French. In addition to a formal teaching method, he captivated the children‚Äôs attention by creating satisfying emotions while immersing them in the language. Action games, songs, arts and crafts, ‚Äúmommy and me‚Äù interactions and visual aids were used to practice the French grammatical features and perceive the language through music and visual cues. The talents of Illustrators, musicians, dancers were also used to help the children learn French. Throughout the years, Thibaut proved that language immersion in a structured play group on a regular basis triggered the process that he had first observed at the French boarding school. At first, the student listened passively. Then they listened intently, interacted, and finally began to speak French. He became convinced that students of different ages (toddlers, children, adults) required a different approach to language learning. He tested his methods in his own school, teaching young students who became fluent in French at a time when public schools did not emphasize language education. The Language Workshop for Children also produced many language education materials, created its original songs, worked with illustrators and freelance artists for producing games, books, and a video series including the animation program ‚ÄúProfessor Toto‚Äù. The Professor Toto animation program has received many awards, including the National Parenting Publications (2004), Parent‚Äôs Choice (1998), Family Choice (2005) and iParenting Media. After finalizing his method of teaching the French language to children, Thibaut decided to resume teaching French to adults. He opened The French Language Salon, focusing on conversational French, the value of French culture, its sociability, and its sense of hospitality. Again, he created an original teaching method for adults that integrates conjugation and grammar into the conversation, starting at the beginner level. Today, Thibaut is recognized as a pioneer of modern early language education. Since Thibaut first began to experiment with language learning, research in neurolinguistics has shown that language acquisition starts as early as the beginning of life, and even before birth. By giving the gift of early language acquisition to thousands of children, Thibaut allowed them to benefit from excellent pronunciation and to master the basics of the language features, which are both a great advantage when continuing their language education. Whether we are speaking about children or adults, Francois Thibaut aims to sow seeds of love for language in his students‚Äô hearts that will flourish and will be sown again in the future. An impressive number of children who attended the Language Workshop for Children Summer camps have continued their education at The Lycee Fran√ßais. But what brings Thibaut the most joy is when a young guy in his 30s shows up at the school out of nowhere, asking ‚ÄúHi Mr. Thibaut, my name is Tristan. Do you remember me?‚Äù  Ordre des Palmes Academiques  In 2019, the French Minist√®re de l‚ÄôEducation Nationale honored Thibaut with the Chevalier de l‚Äô Ordre des Palmes Acad√©miques (Order of Academic Palms) for his contribution to French language and culture. The Palmes Acad√©miques is a national order bestowed by the French government to distinguished academics and figures in the world of culture and education, and to educators who have contributed to the expansion of the French language and culture in the world. The Language Workshop for Children Since 1973, Thibaut's internationally recognized Language Workshop for Children has offered stimulating language lessons for babies, toddlers and elementary grades. Original music, vocabulary-building songs, language immersion, festive visual aids, action games and native-fluent language teachers are why the LWFC is the country's leader in children's language educational play. As Thibaut says, ‚ÄúChildren remember the words that make them happy‚Äù. The French Language Salon In 2011, Thibaut drew on his successful technique with children by offering friendly, situationally relevant classes through his French Language Salon¬Æ classes for adults. Thibaut's new adult method immediately integrates grammar and conversation, rather than teaching them as separate disciplines. Thibaut's former child students often attend his adult classes to practice French for social and professional purposes. Thibaut also designed a test preparation program for students of varying levels who are working to pass exams focused on French as a second language and comply with the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages. Thibaut specializes in different types of test preparation that merge his original French teaching style with patterns that correlate to the specific exam (SAT, AP French, DELF/DALF, and Canadian TEF). He combines his French education experience with an understanding of the exams and their requirements, inspired by the ‚Äúlife-hack‚Äù movement and applied to a more academic and professional sphere. Technology Thibaut expanded his outreach platforms beyond the classroom by producing his Professor Toto Language Education Series for children, available in original CD/DVD and downloadable formats through Amazon.com, as well as providing language lessons and test prep services via Skype.

On opening in April 2019, the stadium had a capacity for 62,062 spectators, later increased to 62,303, and was designed to host football as well as NFL games. The development plans also include 585 new homes, a 180-room hotel, a local community health centre, the Tottenham Experience, a Spurs museum and club shop, an extreme sports facility, as well as the Lilywhite House, which contains a Sainsbury's supermarket, a sixth form college and the club's headquarters. Plans for the project were first announced in 2008 and a planning application submitted in 2009. The project however was revised several times and delayed due to objections by conservation groups and a protracted dispute over a compulsory purchase order (CPO) on existing businesses at the proposed development site. A revised plan was first approved in 2010 by the Haringey Council, and following further revisions, building started in September 2012. Only part of this initial plan was executed, and the construction of the stadium did not commence until 2016 after the CPO dispute has been resolved and a new design approved by Haringey Council. The stadium opening date was revised several times but eventually opened during the 2018‚Äì19 season on 3 April 2019. The new stadium also serves as a venue for at least two of the National Football League (NFL)'s London Games each season. The NFL invested ¬£10 million ($12.8m) in Tottenham's new stadium, just over 1% of the budget. The stadium features the world's first dividing retractable pitch, and it is the first stadium in the UK to have two pitches inside: a retractable grass pitch for football, and a synthetic surface underneath for NFL games and other events. The project is estimated to cost around ¬£1 billion and is intended to be a catalyst for a wider regeneration scheme in Tottenham. Origin Aerial view from the south of White Hart Lane before redevelopment, Wingate industrial estate was located to the north of stadium. Great part of the area here would be rebuilt in the Northumberland Development Project. Beginning in the 1980s, the Tottenham home ground White Hart Lane was redeveloped, and in order to comply with the recommendation of the Taylor Report, it was turned into an all-seater stadium. The capacity of the stadium was reduced from 50,000 in 1979 to around 36,000 by the time it was completed in 1998. The capacity was by then lower than other major English clubs with many of these clubs also planning to expand further, and Tottenham began to explore ways of increasing the stadium capacity so that it could better compete financially with other clubs. Various options were considered over a number of years. In 2000, the club under Alan Sugar submitted a plan to rebuild the East Stand as a three-tier structure to increase the ground capacity to 44,000. As the stadium was hemmed in by other buildings and conservation areas that limited expansion, the club in 2001 (by then owned by ENIC) also considered moving to a proposed new stadium in Picketts Lock planned to be used for the 2005 World Athletics Championships. The Picketts Lock plan however fell through when the government decided that it was too expensive and scrapped the plan, while the East Stand plan was also shelved in 2004 due to concerns over transport infrastructure and council objections. Other suggestions were mooted, including ground-share with rival Arsenal, and buying Wembley Stadium. In 2007, the club announced that it was considering redevelopment of the current site or a move to a new site, although no firm decision on the preferred option was made. While the various proposals were being considered, the club also bought up properties around White Hart Lane when they became available. In April 2008 it was revealed in the press that investigations were taking place into the possible use of the Wingate industrial estate immediately adjacent to the north of White Hart Lane. If planning permission were to be granted and there was agreement of the existing businesses there, a 55‚Äì60,000-seat stadium could be constructed on the White Hart Lane site. This proposal would become the Northumberland Development Project. In 2010, so as to keep all options open, the club also registered an interest in using the Olympic Stadium after the London 2012 Olympics.\\"Tottenham and West Ham lead London 2012 stadium bid\\" BBC News online, Accessed 12 November 2010 Tottenham proposed that the stadium be demolished, and a new 60,000-capacity football stadium without a running track be built in its place, at the same time offering to redevelop the stadium at Crystal Palace National Sports Centre as an athletics stadium. However, the government indicated that the running track should be retained at the Olympic Stadium, and the bid was won by West Ham United in 2011 as it was committed to keeping the track.West Ham chosen as preferred Olympic Stadium tenant BBC Sport online Retrieved 12 February 2011 After its attempts to overturn the Olympic Park Legacy Company's decision failed, the club abandoned the Olympic Stadium bid in October 2011. It focused its attention on the Northumberland Development Project, and announced its commitment to the building of a new stadium in Tottenham in January 2012. Planning historyFirst plans= First design for the Northumberland Development Project, the old buildings on High Road would be demolished to create a public square in this plan, which led to objections. The stadium itself was later redesigned. In November 2007, it was reported that the club was considering the building of a new 52,000-capacity stadium, to be masterminded by Tony Winterbottom, formerly of the London Development Agency, who had worked on development of Arsenal's Emirates Stadium. In this plan the club would leave White Hart Lane for two seasons, possibly sharing ground with West Ham. In October 2008, the club announced that it was planning for the Northumberland Development Project with a 60,000-capacity stadium. In December 2008, images for the new stadium were released, followed by plans for the project with a 58,000-capacity stadium in April 2009 for public consultation. In this plan, the new stadium would be built alongside the existing White Hart Lane. The stadium was designed by KSS Design Group, While the project masterplan was by Make Architects and it contained a public square and two amphitheatres designed by Martha Schwartz Partners, with Buro Happold responsible for the engineering and technical aspects of the build. In October 2009, planning application for a 56,000-seat stadium including proposal for 434 new homes, a 150-room hotel, a club museum and shop, and a supermarket was submitted, with a view to start construction in 2010. However, the plan to demolish eight locally listed buildings and two nationally listed buildings was criticised by English Heritage, and the Government's advisory body on architecture, the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment, as well as other conservation groups. In response to the objections, the club withdrew its planning application in favour of a revised plan in May 2010. This plan retained some of the listed buildings (although the Grade II-listed Fletcher House would still be demolished), reduced the number of new-build residential houses and improved the public spaces. The revised planning application was approved by the Planning Committee of Haringey Council on 30 September 2010, followed by the then-Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, on 25 November 2010. The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs indicated that she would not call in the planning application and that English Heritage would not seek further consideration of the listed building consent application for the project on 9 December 2010. Nevertheless, the club chairman Daniel Levy suggested that the project may not be viable due to the increasing costs that came from the requirements demanded by Haringey Council, Transport for London and English Heritage, and that the club may leave the area for the Olympic Stadium. In August 2011, rioting started in a deprived area of Tottenham, which concentrated the minds of the local authority keen to keep Spurs in the community. On 20 September 2011, the club concluded the Section 106 agreement with Haringey Council to pay for local facilities in the area should the project go ahead, and planning permission was granted. The Greater London Authority and Haringey Council announced on 28 September that it would relieve the club of all community infrastructure payments that planners would normally require, estimated at ¬£8.5m, and to provide a further ¬£8.5m for regeneration and infrastructure projects. In a joint statement with Haringey Council in January 2012, Tottenham announced that it would stay in North Tottenham and work with the council to rejuvenate the area. The Section 106 agreement was revised by the Haringey Council in February 2012; the council waived the requirement for 50% affordable housing in the development, and the ¬£16.436m investment in the community was reduced to ¬£0.477m. Tottenham Hotspur had originally planned to move into the new stadium, while it was partially built, for the beginning of the 2012‚Äì13 season, and the stadium would be completed by the end of the following season. The project however was delayed by the need to submit revised plans and a protracted dispute over the purchase of a factory on Paxton Road, and the completion date was put back to 2016, then to the summer 2017.Tottenham release financial results and give new stadium update fcbusiness 2 April 2014 , Accessed 20 February 2015 Only part of the plan, the construction of Lilywhite House, would be implemented while the dispute was ongoing, and the rest of the scheme was later redesigned. =Compulsory purchase order proceedings= In March 2012, Haringey Council approved plans to hand over council-owned land in the redevelopment area, including part of Wingate Trading Estate as well as Paxton Road and Bill Nicholson Way, to Spurs. It also agreed on a Compulsory Purchase Order (CPO) to buy the remaining property on Paxton Road belonging to Archway Sheet Metal Works that had yet to sell to Spurs. In April 2013 a Public Inquiry was held about the last remaining property to be acquired. Following this, the Planning Inspector recommended refusal of Haringey's application for a Compulsory Purchase Order in his report dated 24 September 2013, because he thought it was unacceptable that the London Borough of Haringey had waived the affordable housing requirement in the original S.106 Agreement. On 11 July 2014, a much delayed decision by Eric Pickles, the Secretary of State for the Department for Communities and Local Government, agreed with a compulsory purchase order made by the London Borough of Haringey enabling the project to proceed. In September 2014, the remaining business with two plots on the development site, Archway Sheet Metal Works, initiated a legal challenge in the High Court that the compulsory purchase order was unlawful and invalid.Tottenham stadium delay means club face season away from home BBC Sport website 10 December 2014, Accessed 20 February 2015 In November 2014, Archway Sheet Metal was subjected to a suspected arson attack, which destroyed their factory on the site. On 20 February 2015, the High Court judge ruled that the compulsory purchase order was legal and valid. He also refused permission to appeal though it could be referred directly to the Court of Appeal,plans for new stadium given massive boost as business looking to block move loses High Court appeal.

On 8 July 2015, it was announced that the club had reached an agreement with NFL to hold a minimum of two NFL games a year in a 10-year partnership. The same day a new design team was also announced alongside a revised project and stadium design: Populous for the stadium design and masterplan, the hotel and the visitor attractions; Allies and Morrison for the new homes; and Donald Insall Associates as heritage architect. The new stadium would have a higher capacity of 61,000 (later raised to 62,062), a larger single-tier stand of 17,000 capacity together with a retractable grass pitch that reveals an artificial surface underneath designed for NFL games. There would also be a 180 bedroom hotel, 579 new homes, an extreme sports centre and a community health centre. A ticket office Paxton Building was later added in 2016. The High Road pavement would be widened which required the demolition of three locally listed buildings (Edmonton Dispensary, The Red House, and the former White Hart public house). Warmington House, the Grade II listed building, would be kept and turned into the club museum, part of Tottenham Experience that includes a club store. The opening date of the new stadium was also revised to the 2018/19 season. In December 2015, the revised plans were approved by Haringey Council, including the demolition of locally listed buildings.Tottenham's revised stadium plans approved by Haringey Council BBC News. Retrieved 17 December 2015 The Mayor of London Boris Johnson also gave formal approval of the plan in February 2016. Tottenham Hotspur indicated that, to mitigate delays that occurred in the planning process and accelerate the construction of the new stadium, it would relocate on a temporary basis to an alternative stadium venue. Several stadia were mooted for ground-sharing, including Wembley Stadium and the Milton Keynes Dons' ground Stadium mk, the Boleyn Ground in Upton Park, and the London Stadium in Stratford. After some time it was announced on 28 May 2016, that Tottenham would play European matches at Wembley from the 2016/17 season, with all home games to be played at the stadium in the 2017/18 season. Scope of project The Northumberland Development Project covers an area of around , bordered by Park Lane to the South, Worcester Avenue to the East, Northumberland Park to the North and the High Road to the West. =Buildings and facilities= View of stadium from the northwest, Percy House in the terrace in frontLilywhite House The Tottenham Experience on Tottenham High Road Paxton building, the ticket office for the stadium The project overall design comprises: * Tottenham Hotspur Stadium ‚Äì the stadium is an enclosed asymmetric bowl with a capacity of 62,062, and it includes a single-tier stand with 17,500 seats influenced by Borussia Dortmund's Signal Iduna Park. It incorporates a fully retractable grass pitch over a Turf Nation synthetic turf pitch to be used for NFL games as well as other sports, concerts and events. In order to enhance the atmosphere on match days, the stands are placed closed to the pitch with the north and south stands just away, and the stadium is designed with good acoustics in mind. The south stand, the 'Home End', features a 5-storey atrium. It also offers separate facilities for football and NFL players, with dedicated entrance for NFL in the east stand. Four LED screens are placed in the stadium, the two in the south are the largest of any stadium in Western Europe. The stadium is intended to be active all year round with visitor attractions such as a Sky Walk that allows visitors to climb to the roof of the stadium. Some car parking is provided underneath the stand and in the basement. * Tottenham Experience ‚Äì it incorporates the Grade II listed Warmington House which serves as the club museum, and new buildings that will serve as an arrival hub and visitors centre, and will include a cinema, club store, ticket office and caf√©. * Lilywhite House ‚Äì the Tottenham Hotspur club headquarters * Other ancillary club buildings ‚Äì the Paxton Building to the northwest of the stadium will be the ticket office. The Northern Terrace, a row of Georgian houses on the north west corner of the site would be restored and renovated, with Percy House used as the home for the Tottenham Hotspur Foundation. * Public spaces ‚Äì this includes a large public open space on the south podium that incorporates a multi-use games area with five-a-side pitches, food stalls and cafes, and the redevelopment of the High Road for improved crowd management. * Housing ‚Äì 585 new homes including affordable housing, to be built in 4 towers ranging in height from 16 to 32 storeys. * Sports centre ‚Äì an extreme sports venue, including the tallest indoor climbing wall in the world and an indoor dive tank. * Hotel ‚Äì a 180 bedroom hotel with 49 serviced apartments on the upper floors. * Community facilities ‚Äì a new community health centre. * Retail spaces ‚Äì the Sainsbury's supermarket with parking space forms part of the Lilywhite House, with club offices above it.

Retrieved 24 May 2012 =Regeneration and infrastructure projects= The Northumberland Development Project is intended to be the catalyst for a 20-year regeneration program planned by the Haringey Council to spur on growth and wider changes in Tottenham. This includes developments in Tottenham Hale, Tottenham Green and Seven Sisters, Northumberland Park, and other areas. This wider regeneration plan aims to create 10,000 new homes, 5,000 new jobs, new schools and commercial spaces, as well as improved transport, leisure amenities and public facilities by 2025. When completed, the Northumberland Development Project itself would support 3,500 jobs, of which 1,700 are new jobs, with an estimated annual injection of ¬£293 million into the local economy. Among the various proposals, of direct relevance to the stadium is the High Road West regeneration scheme to redevelop the area between the stadium and White Hart Lane station. This involves the mass clearance of existing homes and businesses in the area, the rebuilding of White Hart Lane station and the creation of a walkway for fans from the station to the stadium, and the building of new apartments and leisure amenities. This regeneration scheme is associated with the Northumberland Development Project and involves the club. The proposal and the nearby Goods Yard development are controversial given the high levels of deprivation in Tottenham and the high levels of demand for social housing. One of the first schemes involving the club to be completed is the Cannon Road development located to the north of the High Road West area. It opened in 2015 and included 222 affordable home and the 400-pupil Brook House Primary School. The development of High Road West, however, has stalled. One aim of the project is to improve the public transport in the area with the new stadium designated a 'Public Transport Destination'. The Northumberland Park, Tottenham Hale and White Hart Lane station train station would be reconstructed, with investment to improve frequency of trains, and new shuttle bus links and better pedestrian connections planned. The club intends to rename the White Hart Lane station to Tottenham Hotspur. The club, which is a founding participant of the 10:10 environmental campaign has summarised the energy saving measures and other environmentally friendly elements of the project which it claims will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by around 40% compared to current Building Regulation requirements and make it one of the most environmentally sustainable stadiums in the United Kingdom. Cost and funding New stadium under construction, view from east The first plan of 2007 was initially estimated to cost around ¬£300 million, raised to around ¬£400 million in 2009 for a revised plan, then to ¬£430 million in 2012. Phase 1 of this plan was projected to cost ¬£45 million, Phase 2 which includes the construction of the stadium at ¬£305 million, and Phase 3 at ¬£80 million. After Phase 1 of this plan had been completed, a new plan with different designs for the stadium and other buildings was submitted in 2015, and this new plan was projected to cost ¬£400 million. Cost however had escalated in the course of construction, with the project estimated to cost ¬£850 million in 2018. Part of the increase was a result of the higher cost of import due to the effect of the Brexit vote on the exchange rate, changes to the built, overtime working and higher construction cost. In April 2019, club chairman Levy said that the cost is of the order of ¬£1 billion. On 21 August 2009 Tottenham Hotspur made a Stock Exchange announcement that it was issuing 30 million new shares to raise ¬£15 million to fund the first stage of the proposed development. The funds related specifically to the professional costs required to advance the project to the point where a full planning application could be submitted. The club's major shareholder, ENIC International Ltd subscribed to take up 27.8 million of the shares. On 22 July 2011, a supporter group, Supporting Our Future, submitted a proposal for a ¬£50 million funding initiative to Spurs to support the Northumberland Development ProjectSupporting Our Future ‚Äì News ‚Äì Supporting Our Future Community Share Proposal to Tottenham Hotspur FC and Haringey Borough Council by way of a Community Share scheme. This proposal was presented after polling Spurs fans on their views of the club and Northumberland Park Development,Supporting Our Future ‚Äì News ‚Äì Fan Referendum 2011, Results Now Online! and extensive consultation with the club, Haringey Council, and Supporters Direct. ¬£27 million of local and central government funding was pledged to improve the infrastructure and public spaces in the Northumberland Park regeneration zone planned by Haringey Council. NFL contributed ¬£10 million to provide American football accommodations in exchange for allowing at least two NFL games per year in the stadium. The club announced in April 2014 that it had divested some 'non-core' properties to the west of the High Road relating to phase 1 of the project to TH Property Limited, a subsidiary of ENIC, with the proceeds used to pay down debt secured against those properties. In December 2015, a ¬£200m interim financing facility was arranged with three banks to fund the relocation, planning and development. In May 2017, the club announced a ¬£400 million five-year loan deal with the banks, replacing the ¬£200 million previously in place, to fund the remaining built. The bank also provided a ¬£25m working capital facility, while the owner of Tottenham Hotspur, ENIC, supported the stadium financing with a ¬£50 million letter of credit. By this stage, ¬£340 million had already been spent on land acquisition, the planning process as well as construction cost; ¬£100 million of this came from the interim financing, with the rest from the club resources. In 2018, it was announced that due to spiralling cost, the club had to borrow an extra ¬£237 million, raising the financing facility to ¬£637m. In order to reduce debt-servicing costs and improve annual cash flow, ¬£525 million of the debt was refinanced by issuing bonds that will mature in 15 to 30 years' time. The bond issue was arranged by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, which also provided a ¬£112m loan. Instead of maintaining the White Hart Lane name, the club plans to pursue corporate sponsorship of the stadium, with Spurs eyeing potential suitors in the UAE and FedEx. The club was looking for a 20-year deal worth ¬£20m annually. Construction The project was planned to be completed in phases. =Phase 1= First building completed in the project - Lilywhite House with Sainbury's on Northumberland Park The first phase involved the building of Lilywhite House to the north of the White Hart Lane to house the club offices. This building incorporates a Sainsbury's supermarket and the University Technical College of Tottenham. McLaren was the main contractor of the project. Phase 1 of the project started in September 2012 with work on the Sainsbury's site. The supermarket covers an area of of sales floor space with car parking space at ground level intended for match day and non-match day use, together with an additional of floor space above the supermarket for the club's offices and the college. Sainsbury's opened in November 2013, and the University Technical College of Tottenham opened in September 2014 (the college however closed in 2017 and the site was then used by London Academy of Excellence Tottenham). In February 2015, the club announced that Lilywhite House of the Phase 1 development had been completed. =Phase 2= Northern section of the new stadium under construction in May 2017, West Stand of White Hart Lane partially demolished The second phase involved the construction of the stadium and the Tottenham Experience, scheduled to be completed in the summer of 2018. Mace was contracted to construct the stadium. The construction of the stadium was conducted in two main stages so that the White Hart Lane stadium could still be used for the 2016‚Äì17 season while the construction was in progress. The first phase involved the construction of the northern section of the new stadium (including the north, west and most of the east stands), while the south stand would be started in the second stage the existing stadium had been demolished. Large parts the land north of the existing stadium was cleared by 2014 while the Archway Steel CPO dispute was ongoing. After the dispute was resolved, preliminary work on the basement began in the summer of 2015, with concrete and ground works for the foundation by the subcontractor Morrisroe starting in autumn 2015 based on earlier approved and amended plans. The new plan for the project was given final approval in February 2016, which allowed construction of the upper sections of the new stadium itself to start soon after. In order to facilitate the construction of northern section of the stadium while matches of the final season were still being played at the Lane, its northeast corner was demolished during the summer of 2016 after the 2015‚Äì16 season. From the basement to level 6, the construction of this section is in reinforced concrete. Three further levels above are constructed in steel frame. There are only six vertical cores for vertical circulation instead of the eight expected of a stadium of this size as they needed to be constructed within the first phase of the stadium construction. Demolition of the remainder of the White Hart Lane stadium began immediately after the last home match of the 2016‚Äì17 season, and was completed by August 2017.https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/15/tottenham-hotspur-stadium-is-disrupting- the-premier-league-and-the-nfl.html Piling work for Phase 2 of the stadium construction had started in June 2017. While the northern section constructed in the first phase is a largely concrete structure, the entire single-tier south stand has a steel frame which allowed speedier construction. Two steel \\"trees\\", erected in December 2017, support the south stand, which will be the largest single-tier stand in the UK. The compression ring that holds the cable net roof structure was completed in February 2018, and the roof lift operation to raise the cable net roof structure to the top of the stadium, which took several weeks, was performed in March 2018. Parts of the old White Hart Lane were incorporated into the development - crushed aggregate of the concrete foundation of White Hart Lane was mixed in with new concrete to create the floor of the concourse of the new stadium, and bricks from the East Stand were used for the Shelf Bar. The frontage of the demolished Tottenham and Edmonton Dispensary is also incorporated into the Tottenham Experience. The gate to the West Stand of White Hart Lane, the Bill Nicholson Gates, will be incorporated into the scheme on the south west approach to the stadium together with a statue of Bill Nicholson positioned at the centre of the gates. =Phase 3= Phase 3 comprises the building of a hotel, a sport centre, a medical centre and homes. Work on the basement of the hotel began while the south stand was still being constructed in late 2017 and early 2018. The construction of the hotel has been delayed. Opening The club shop opened on 23 October 2018. After repeated delays, two test events open to the public and with increasing levels of attendance necessary for the issuing of safety certificate were held in March 2019. The stadium opened with a ceremony on 3 April 2019 before its first competitive Premier League game, which was against Crystal Palace.

Swimming for the Olympic Nice Natation club, she specialised in the individual medley and the free style events. Her career ran from 2005 to 2014. At the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, she won gold in the 400-metre freestyle, silver in the 200-metre freestyle and bronze in the 4√ó200-metre freestyle relay. In so doing, she became the fourth French swimmer to win an individual gold medal at the Olympic Games. She was also the third French athlete overall to win three Olympic medals at a single edition of the Olympic Games. She died in the Villa Castelli helicopter collision, at age 25, during the filming of French TV reality show Dropped for the TF1 network. Early life Born on 28 October 1989 in Nice, Camille Marie Manuella Muffat was the middle child in the family, having an older sister, Chlo√©, and a younger brother, Quentin. Her father, Guy Muffat was a physical therapist and her mother, Laurence, was a nurse. Upon finishing high school, she pursued a degree in economics, during which time she swam under a high-performance athlete studying system. She eventually dropped out of school in order to pursue her swimming career. Career Muffat was trained as a medley swimmer who was particularly gifted in the breaststroke and crawl styles, which are the closing disciplines in the medley. However, after a strong start to her career, her results in the medley events started to fade, and Muffat felt like she could not sustain her pace well enough to achieve her goals by swimming the medley. As a result, she changed her swimming profile, switching to the freestyle events, at the suggestion of her coach Fabrice Pellerin. Under Pellerin's guidance, Muffat dedicated herself to an extensive training programme, which included training on Sundays for a year before the 2012 Olympic Games. =2005‚Äì2007= Muffat first came into the spotlight in 2005, upon beating fellow Frenchwoman Laure Manaudou in the 200-metre individual medley event at the French National Championship, in Nancy, also breaking the French national record, which Manaudou also held. Only months later, she would again win the 200-metre individual medley event at the European Junior Championships, held in Budapest, Hungary. At the European Juniors, she would also take silver in the 100-metre freestyle. In 2006, she debuted in the senior European Championships by swimming a leg of the 4 √ó 100 metres freestyle relay for France. A month later, she won four medals, including one gold, at that year's World Junior Championships, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. In December 2006, she attained her first international podium, at the European Short Course Championships in Helsinki, Finland. In 2007, for the first time Muffat took part in a World Championship, held in Melbourne, Australia, reaching semifinals in the 400 m medley. At the end of the year, she had her first victory in senior competitions, by winning the 200-metre individual medley and taking bronze in the 400-metre individual medley event at the 2007 European Short Course Swimming Championships in Debrecen, Hungary. =2008‚Äì2011= In March 2008, Muffat won her first medal as a senior, long-course international event, by taking bronze at the 200-metre individual medley at the European Championships in Eindhoven, Netherlands. On the first day of the 2008 French national championships, a qualifying event for that year's Olympic Games, Muffat and Joanne Andraca tied in the 400 m individual medley (IM) in a new French record of 4:38.23. Two days later, she won gold at the 200-metre individual medley by breaking Laure Manaudou's French record. At the end of competition, Muffat had qualified for the 200- and the 400-metre individual medley events at the Olympics, and clinched a berth in the French team for the 4 √ó 200 metre freestyle relay. At the 2008 Summer Olympics, however, Muffat only qualified for the final of the relay, where the team finished fifth. Later, at the 2008 European Short Course Championships, held in Rijeka, Muffat finished second in the 400-metre freestyle, bested by her countrywoman and former Olympic relay teammate, Coralie Balmy. On both the 200- and 400-metre individual medley events, she finished in fifth place. At the 2009 French national championships, Muffat sets a new French record in the 200 m IM (2:09.34). At that year's World Championships, in Rome, she finished 7th in the 200 m individual medley final, and takes part in the French team that finishes eighth in the 4 √ó 200 m freestyle relay final. At the 2010 French Championship, in Saint-Raph√§el, she wins both the 200 m individual medley event and the 400 m individual medley event, finishing second to Coralie Balmy in the 200 m freestyle event. At the European Championships in Budapest, Muffat arrived as the favourite to take gold at the 200 m individual medley, declaring to the press that the gold medal is her objective in that event. However, after leading the field into the third discipline of the medley, the breaststroke, she was overtaken by Hungarian Katinka Hossz√∫, causing Muffat to lose momentum and finish fourth in the event. On the same day, the French 4 √ó 200 m freestyle relay team also finishes second in the final when Muffat, who was anchoring the French relay, got overtaken by another Hungarian swimmer, Evelyn Verraszt√≥. Two days later, she would also finish 4th in the 200 m freestyle event, which was won by Italian swimmer Federica Pellegrini. Following her disappointing results, her coach, Fabrice Pellerin, urges Muffat to make a choice between the medley events and the freestyle events. from sports.fr Choosing the latter, Muffat improved her results in freestyle swimming, taking first place in all distances (50 m, 100 m, 200 m and 400 m) at the following French Championships, at Chartre, where she also broke the French record in the 100 m freestyle event. A month later, at the 2010 World Short Course Championships in Dubai, Muffat would take her first world title, by winning the 200 m freestyle event, defeating Katie Hoff of the United States and Kylie Palmer of Australia. Swimming with the French 4 √ó 200 m freestyle relay, she also took a bronze medal from the event. In 2011, Muffat repeated the feat of winning all four distances (100 m, 200 m, 400 m and 800 m) at the French Championships in Strasbourg, thus also qualifying in all events for that year's World Championships, in Shanghai, China. At the World Championships Muffat took two bronze medals, in the 200 m and the 400 m freestyle events. =2012‚Äì2014= In March 2012, at the French Championships in Dunkerque, Muffat won the 400 m freestyle event by breaking Laure Manaudou's French record, established in 2006. Her time of 4:01:13 was the world's fastest of the year at the time, and earned her a berth in that year's Olympic Games. Two days later, Muffat would also win the 200 m freestyle event, breaking her own French record with a time of 1:54:87, thus qualifying for that event as well at the Olympic Games in London. Muffat qualified to enter three events at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. She won the gold medal in the 400 m freestyle with a new Olympic record, as well as the silver medal in the 200 m freestyle event. Also, her 4 √ó 200 m freestyle team won the bronze medal in a time of 7:47.49. [Camille Muffat (1:55.51); Charlotte Bonnet (1:57.78); Oph√©lie-Cyrielle √âtienne (1:58.05); Coralie Balmy (1:56.15)]. She thus equalled Laure Manaudou's 2004 Olympics achievement of one gold, one silver and one bronze, and also became only the third Frenchwoman after Micheline Ostermeyer and Manaudou to win three medals in a single summer or winter Olympic Games. In April 2013, at the French Championships in Rennes, she won the 400 m freestyle event for a third consecutive time, while also winning the 100 m and 200 m freestyle events, which qualified her for all three events at the 2013 World Championships in Barcelona, Spain. Her performance at the 2013 World Championships, however, were below expectations, with Muffat taking home the bronze medals, in the 200 m freestyle and the 4 √ó 200 m freestyle relay. In her signature 400 m freestyle event, however, she finished a disappointing seventh in the final. After the World Championships, Muffat decided to cut down on her training routine temporarily, and took a gold, a silver and a bronze at the 2013 French Short Course Championships in Dijon. At that year's European Championships, however, she failed to qualify for the 200 m freestyle final, and finished fifth in the 400 m. At the 2014 French Championships in Chartres, a qualifying event for the 2014 European Championships, Muffat won four titles, taking gold in the 100 m, 200 m and 400 m freestyle, as well as in the 100 m butterfly. She also took silver in the 50 m freestyle. However, on 12 July 2014, before the European Championships, she announced her retirement from competitive swimming at age 24, during an interview to the French newspaper, L'√âquipe.Olympic Champion Camille Muffat Announces Retirement Death On 9 March 2015, as a part of a group of sports stars participating in the French reality TV show Dropped, Muffat was killed along with nine other people when two helicopters collided in mid-air during filming in northwestern Argentina.Camille Muffat, Olympic gold medallist, among 10 dead in helicopter crashFrench Olympians filming reality TV survival show killed in helicopter crash in Argentina.

It allows players to engage in Mafia-style wars with one another and has become one of the most lucrative Facebook applications and the first to net US$1M per month in revenue. However, this number has never been confirmed by the developer or any third parties. Developed by David Maestri while he worked for Freewebs.com, it was subsequently the subject of an unsuccessful intellectual property lawsuit as Maestri's former employers attempted to claim ownership over the asset. The lawsuit was ultimately settled in December 2008 with the IP for Mob Wars remaining with Maestri but with SGN allowed to develop their own Mafia based role-playing application. In August 2008, Mob Wars had 2.5 million active users. It has spawned several very similar games with nearly identical gameplay and format on both Facebook and MySpace, some of which, such as Zynga's Mafia Wars, were the subject of further lawsuits.Mob Wars Creator Puts A Hit Out On Zynga, Sues For Copyright Infringement from TechCrunch.com (February 14, 2009) Zynga made some changes to Mafia Wars so it wouldn't resemble Mob Wars as closely, but Mob Wars creator David Maestri moved forward with his lawsuit. In September 2009, Maestri and Zynga settled the case for about $7‚Äì$9 million, less than the $10 million Maestri had originally demanded.  Gameplay  Mob Wars is a simple role-playing game. There is no world for the player to move around in. The only type of character interaction the player experiences with other players, is either by sending them messages, weapons, and energy boosts, or attacking them. Like many Facebook applications, most of the gameplay revolves around having friends of the player join the player's mob through means made possible in the game. The player starts off as a petty thief and works his way up to doing bigger and better paying jobs and heists. The player gains strength by equipping his mob with weapons, armor and vehicles. These can be drops from doing jobs and heists, gifts from friends, or they can be purchased with game money (earned by doing jobs, fighting other players, or as income from investments in properties.) Favor Points (sub-currency also known as Godfather points) can be used to heal or gain more game money. They are slowly earned as the player levels up or can be gained quickly by participating in sponsor surveys or off-site membership purchases with a credit card. Soon after the development of the game, alliances were formed by many players, to promote levelling and to organize group attacks, and to protect against those same tactics. Some families were more organized than others and these alliances would range from only a few players to hundreds. Eventually the game itself evolved to promote the family aspect of the game, giving each player's character the option of either staying on their own, creating their own family or joining another family. If the respective character is a member of an in- game family, they would be \\"tagged\\" with the family name, which would link to the family page, listing all of the mobsters in that respective family. Many of the original families created in-game family alternatives, but since they were limited to 50 members per family the groups lost many members to other newcomers. In 2012 the Family aspect of the game was improved to include a Win-Loss percentage in Wars.

On May 1, 1991 the Bicesse Accords were signed by the MPLA, led by Jos√© Eduardo dos Santos and by UNITA, led by Jonas Savimbi. The accords were meant to bring about a political settlement between UNITA and the MPLA by establishing a cease fire, integrating the armed forces and holding democratic elections. The MPLA's victory in the 1992 Angolan general election would result in UNITA alleging fraud on the part of the MPLA and, in response, withdrawing from the accords and resuming their armed struggle against the government. The rising tensions following the September election resulted in a flare up of violence around Luanda where armed MPLA supporters and police harassed and murdered a significant number of opposition party supporters. Thousands of UNITA supporters are estimated to have been murdered. Context The Angolan Civil War = Main article: Angolan Civil War Ever since its independence from Portugal in 1975, Angola was gripped in a civil war between the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA). The war was intensified by the direct and indirect involvement of outside superpowers who saw the conflict through the eyes of the Cold War. The MPLA, which claimed allegiance to Marxist-Leninist ideology, received direct support from Cuba with the backing of the Soviet Union and other communist states. Meanwhile, the UNITA sold itself as an anti-communist organization, receiving direct military support from South Africa with help from the United States. Ferocious combat was waged during this time period but neither side was able to claim total victory over the other. By 1988, as the Cold War began to draw to a close, Cuba and South Africa withdrew their troops from the conflict. Their withdrawal, coupled with the inability for either side to achieve total victory over the other, forced the MPLA and UNITA to the negotiating table to negotiate a political settlement to the conflict. = The Bicesse Accords = Main article: Bicesse Accords Beginning in 1 May 1991, UNITA and MPLA forces agreed on a framework to beginning establishing peace in Angola between the two warring parties. This framework would evolve into the Bicesse Accords, signed by the People's Republic of Angola and UNITA on 31 May 1991 in Lisbon, Portugual. The United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics acted as observers, while Portugual mediated the talks. The accords set out a timetable and established certain conditions that each side agreed to meet by the specified dates. There were three key parts of the agreement. The first was the beginning of a cease fire, with the initial stages taking effect at the beginning of May and entering into force upon the signing of the accords. The second key part of agreement was the integration of UNITA forces into the Angolan armed forces, which was to occur upon the implementation of the cease fire agreement and had numerous provisions to establish the non- partisan nature of the armed forces. The third part of the agreement scheduled the date of a nationwide democratic election, which was to take place \\"between 1 September to 30 November 1992\\", roughly sixteen months after the signing of the agreement. = 1992 Angolan general election = Main article: 1992 Angolan general election The 1992 elections, the first democratic elections held in Angola's history, took place from 29 September 1992 to 30 September 1992. The MPLA claimed victory in these elections, taking roughly fifty-three percent of the vote, gaining one hundred and twenty nine seats in the legislature. UNITA, under the leadership of Jonas Savimbi, claimed thirty four percent of the vote and gained seventy seats. For the presidency, Jos√© Eduardo dos Santos of the MPLA received forty-nine percent of the vote compared to UNITA Savimbi's forty percent. Despite having a higher percentage of the vote, dos Santos was just shy of the fifty percent majority required to be reelected. Because neither the MPLA nor UNITA obtained the required absolute majority of the presidential election, a follow-up election was necessary according to the constitution. Savimbi, in spite of the UN mission's declaration that the elections were generally free and fair, believed that the government had rigged the elections and began pulling UNITA's soldiers out of the new unified Angolan armed forces. This essentially marked the beginning of the end for the Bicesse Accords and rising tensions between the Angolan government and UNITA. Killings in Luanda 30 October to 1 November As both sides heightened war rhetoric, the MPLA attacked UNITA positions in Luanda on October 30th. According to some reports, the violence was not sporadic, but had been planned over the course of weeks . These included reports from residents of Luanda's suburbs \\"of arms were being distributed locally to government supporters and to former members of the security forces and militia\\" and even reports that \\"police stations served as centres of distribution\\", which demonstrates possible government complicity and encouragement of violence. UNITA supporters were targeted in house to house searches by both police and armed government supporters, with some supporters possessing lists of local UNITA supporters who were to be rounded up. Some were summarily executed while others were taken to police stations and later released, though often after receiving vicious beatings. Other people disappeared completely, some human rights reports detailing accounts of security forces carrying out executions of suspected UNITA supporters and clandestine graves. Many of the those targeted were of the Ovimbundu and Bakongo ethnic groups, which were the main supporters of the UNITA and considered to be potentially disloyal. Other opposition parties, which supported UNITA's claim that the 1992 election results were illegitimate, were also targeted in the violence. They included the Partido Social Democrata Angolano (PSDA), Angolan Social Democratic Party, Partido Democr√°tico para o Progresso-Alian√ßa Nacional Angolana (PDP-ANA), Democratic Progress Party/Angolan National Alliance and the Conven√ß√£o Nacional Democr√°tica de Angola (CNDA), Angolan National Democratic Convention. Results Jeremias Chitunda, Vice President of UNITA until his assassination on November 2nd, 1992 Several leading officials from UNITA were killed in the violence that occurred in Luanda. These included UNITA vice president Jeremias Chitunda, top negotiator Elias Salupeto Pena and party secretary Aliceres Mango. The total number of deaths ranges, with some sources saying the deaths numbered as high as 30,000. The repercussions of the massacre are difficult to determine, as UNITA's decision to pull out of the Angolan Armed Forces and their rejection of the election results shows that the political settlement reached in the Bicesse Accords had failed. However, the death of several high ranking UNITA officials, especially those who were directly involved in the peace negotiations, such as Pena, demonstrates that the return to hostilities was not a matter of if, but of when.

During this period, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places, being included primarily for its architecture. =Reopening= After some years of inactivity, the bank building was purchased in October 2004 by businessman Dimitri Makedonsky, who also owns properties around the bank. Dimitri proceeded to renovate the building: replacing the roof, redesigning the interior, and gradually restoring the interior to an appearance similar to that of a bank from the 1920s. Hoping to open a restaurant in the building, he refurbished several major side rooms: as the celebrated original restrooms no longer functioned, they were turned into museum rooms, while the bank's substantial vault became a lounge. The restaurant opened on May 15, 2008. After over a decade of operating as The Ladora Bank Bistro, the building now houses an Iowa Caucus themed bistro named Caucus Bistro.

Reed became known for his fiddle tunes only after Alan Jabbour and the Hollow Rock String Band spread his music. Reed never had a professional career as a fiddler but was able to influence many other musicians through a relationship with his apprentice Alan Jabbour. Early life Henry Reed was born in Monroe County, West Virginia on April 28, 1884. He was the youngest of the eight children of Marion Reed and Sophia Catherine Underwood Reed. Reed grew up in Monroe County in a large extended family and spent most of his life in the surrounding area. At the age of 23 Reed married Nettie Ann Virginia Mullins on December 11, 1907. They settled down in Glen Lyn, Virginia. Reed spent the next few years working at the Appalachian Power plant and raising his family, which eventually grew to twelve children. Career Reed is one of the few Appalachian musicians that became known for his music without playing professionally. Reed was recognized for his fiddling shortly after meeting Alan Jabbour in 1966. Jabbour was an apprentice to Reed, listening, recording and learning Reed's tunes on the Fiddle and harmonica. Alan Jabbour's band, the Hollow Rock String Band, used many of Reed's tunes in their music. As the band played Reed's tunes at more shows he became more of a public figure, and eventually began to be recognized for his music. In 1968, the Hollow Rock String band released a long-playing record, The Hollow Rock String Band: Traditional Dance Tunes. This record was made up of many tunes from Reed. The tune \\"Over the Waterfall\\" was produced by the Hollow Strings Band and is one of Reed's most well-known compositions. =Fiddle Technique= Reed's tunes include a variety of genres. According to Alan Jabbour's recordings, Reed often played \\"classic tunes, classic vintage, waltzes, schottisches, clogs, rag-like pieces from both grassroots and popular sources and several marches from the nineteenth-century fifing tradition.\\" Not all of the techniques Reed used to produce these genres were common among many fiddlers. Reed held the fiddle under his chin allowing his left hand to be free. Freeing up his left hand made it possible for him to achieve notes in the third position which included keys like a high D or C. Reed also had a particular way of holding the bow at the frog rather than choking it up higher like other fiddlers do. By gripping the bow on the frog Reed was able to achieve slurs into his playing; This style was referred to as the \\"longbow style.\\" Slurs are multiple notes in the same stroke of the bow allowing for a more diverse sound to come from the fiddle. The most unusual feature of his bow technique was the placement of his fifth finger underneath the nut rather than on the top of it. Death Reed Died at the age of 84 on February 8, 1968 due to a blood clot. The blood clot that was formed a month after a surgery to have his foot amputated because of an infection. His wife, Nettie died the following year. They are buried next to each other in Pearisburg. Legacy Reed's name and legacy continue on through the Henry Reed Fund and the Annual Henry Reed Memorial Fiddlers Convention. The Henry Reed Fund was started by Alan Jabbour in 1999. Alan explains why he created this fund by expressing his desire \\"to provide support for initiatives benefiting folk artists and taping the collections of the American Folklife Center. In doing so, [the Henry Reed Fund] also commemorates the important cultural process through which the artistry of people like Henry Reed is shared with younger generations and provides continuing enrichment for our cultural life.\\" The Annual Henry Reed Convention was started in 2003 in honor of Reed. This convention allows fiddlers to get together in Glen, Virginia once a year to share their music.

The goal of a good ballot title is to be a neutral summary that accurately conveys to voters the gist of what the proposed new law says or would do. The National Conference of State Legislatures says, \\"The ballot title and summary are arguably the most important part of an initiative in terms of voter education. Most voters never read more than the title and summary of the text of initiative proposals. Therefore, it is of critical importance that titles and summaries be concise, accurate and impartial.\\" However, it is not always clear how one would neutrally describe the gist of what a new law would do. As a result, ballot titles are fertile grounds for conflict and lawsuits. Differences between states One way that states differ in laws governing the initiative process has to do with whether the ballot title is determined before signatures are collected, or after. Another way that states differ has to do with whether the ballot title is determined by the government (which could be a commission, a ballot title determination board, the Secretary of State, or some other election official) or whether the ballot title is determined by the political organization that is advocating for the measure. Pre-circulation ballot titles States where the ballot title is set prior to circulation include: Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Idaho, Maine, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon (In Oregon, the ballot title is set after 1,000 initial sponsorship signatures have been submitted) and Washington. Post-circulation ballot titles States where the ballot title is determined by the government after the signatures have been collected are: Arizona, Michigan, Nebraska, Nevada, Oklahoma, Utah, Wyoming. Ballot titles determined by proponents In Florida and South Dakota, the ballot title is determined by the proponent, subject to legal challenge by opponents in court.

It is located at the ninth block of Colmena avenue, within the Historic Centre of Lima which was declared a World Heritage Site in 1988 by UNESCO. It is located near the Plaza Mayor of Lima and is connected to it by the Jiron de la Union. Its central monument gives homage to Peru's liberator, Jos√© de San Mart√≠n. History Monument to Jos√© de San Mart√≠n =Precedents= The location of the plaza had been the site of the San Juan de Dios hospital which was torn down in 1850 and replaced by a railway station, which in turn was torn down between 1911 and 1918. =Construction= The Plaza San Mart√≠n was inaugurated on July 27, 1921 in celebration of the 100th anniversary of the independence of Peru. The design, ornamentation, furnishing, and gardening of the plaza was designed by Manuel Piqueras Cotol√≠. The benches and handrails were constructed out of marble and the paving, of granite. There were also four water fountains, bronze streetlamps, and flower-filled gardens. The design for the monument to Jos√© de San Mart√≠n was chosen in a contest in which the design created by the Spanish sculptor Mariano Benlliure emerged victorious and illustrated San Martin during his voyage across the Andes. Architecture Hotel Bolivar (on the right side) The construction of the buildings that surrounded the plaza occurred at a gradual pace. The Col√≥n Theater and the Giacoletti buildings were the first structures to be built and were erected in 1914 before the construction of the plaza. The other buildings were later built in three stages. The Hotel Bolivar was built in 1924 and was designed by Rafael Marquina. The Zela and Pumacahua arcades were built during the second stage in 1926 and also were designed by Rafael Marquina. The Club Nacional was built in 1929 by Ricardo de Jaxa Malachowski and Enrique Bianchi. In the third and final stage of the project from 1935-1945 the remaining flanks of the plaza were built up with the construction of the Cine Metro, F√©nix, Boza, and Sudam√©rica buildings which were built in the Neocolonial style (similar to the Spanish Colonial Revival architecture). As a result, the plaza maintains uniformity with respect to its buildings' facades. Its overall appearance is primarily baroque; the buildings, plaza, and central monument all cohere to uniform and specific styles. The architectural style to which most of the surrounding buildings belong to is that of the neohispanic or neocolonial styles within the realm of European derived architecture.

History Workman was born in Belleville, Ontario, in 1973. In 1980, his family moved from Canada to the U.S. state of Florida, because Pierre Trudeau and the Liberal Party of Canada were successful in the 1980 federal election; and his father did not want to live in what he perceived as a socialist country . Workman graduated from Satellite High School in Satellite Beach and then attended Appalachian State University, where he graduated in 1995. Following graduation, he served in the National Guard from 1990 to 2005, including as a Battery Commander in Operation Noble Eagle. When incumbent State Representative Mike Haridopolos was elected to the Florida Senate in a 2003 Special Election, Workman ran to succeed him in the 30th District, which stretched from Rockledge to Palm Bay in southern Brevard County. Workman lost to Thad Altman in the Republican primary, receiving 29% of the vote to Altman's 41%. Florida House of Representatives When Altman opted to run for the Florida Senate rather than seek re-election in 2008, Workman ran to succeed him. In the Republican primary, Workman faced Tres Holton, whom he easily defeated, winning 62% of the vote. He faced Amy Tidd, the Democratic nominee, and, following a contentious campaign, narrowly defeated her, winning 54% of the vote to Tidd's 46%. When running for re-election in 2010, Workman once again faced Tidd, and he campaigned on his sponsorship of legislation similar to SB 1070 in Arizona, which would allow police officers to \\"detain a person who cannot prove their citizenship or legal status.\\" When Tidd responded that she was \\"still waiting to see his papers,\\" Workman responded, \\"Is it because I'm white that this is not a racial slur? I'm offended, but she makes my point for me. I'm pro-immigration reform because when someone comes here illegally, it diminishes my struggle.\\" The Orlando Sentinel endorsed Tidd over Workman, criticizing Workman's \\"dubious priorities,\\" including \\"aligning himself with a fringe group that rejects federal authority over states, though he sees no contradiction in Florida taking billions of dollars in stimulus money from Washington, D.C.\\" Despite this, Workman managed to expand his margin of victory over Tidd, defeating her in a landslide with 61% of the vote. In 2012, when the state's legislative districts were reconfigured, Workman was moved into the 52nd District, which included most of the territory that he previously represented in the 30th District. He faced no opposition in the Republican primary or the general election, and won his third term entirely uncontested. Workman was re-elected to his fourth and final term in the House in 2014 without opposition. Controversy During the 2011 legislative session, Workman authored several pieces of legislation that would have repealed a number of what he considered to be \\"inane\\" laws. The most controversial of the laws he aimed to repeal was a statute banning the practice of \\"dwarf-tossing,\\" a \\"competition in which little people are literally turned into human shot puts.\\" Workman asserted, \\"[Little people] don't need government to decide for them. This is insulting. Their actions aren't endangering anyone else. For every law that's on the books a little piece of your liberty and freedom is lost.\\" He argued that his legislation could help improve the economy, noting, \\"All that [the ban on dwarf-tossing] does is prevent some dwarfs from getting jobs they would be happy to get. In this economy, or any economy, why would we want to prevent people from getting gainful employment?\\" Little People of America, an advocacy group for individuals with dwarfism, condemned Workman's legislation, and Jennifer Arnold, one of the stars of The Little Couple, argued against the proposal, saying, \\"My biggest concern is that we're going backwards. It seems okay today to still make fun of little people. It's not okay to do that for races, religions and other disabled people.\\" Resignation After losing the 2016 primary election for the state senate, Workman was appointed to the Florida Public Service Commission by Republican Governor Rick Scott. Before he could assume office, Workman was accused of being vulgar by State Senator Lizbeth Benacquisto (R) who claimed he made vulgar comments and gestures at a charity event. She asked him to stop, but he persisted. When he refused to stop, others had to intervene.  December 4, 2017  Rick Scott‚Äôs appointment for PSC resigns after sexual misconduct allegation  Steve Bousquet  Senator Benacquisto announced she would not schedule Workman for confirmation by the Senate. Following Benacquisto's announcement, Workman contacted Scott and immediately withdrew from consideration. Workman apologized to Benacquisto and agreed to step aside from the PCS appointment to keep from becoming a distraction to the Governor.

History The party was founded in 1935 by Abul Muhasin Sajjad, the Amir of Imarat-e-Sharia, Bihar, to represent Muslims in Bihar who were disillusioned with Congress and the Muslim League. As Congress did not have a clear policy related to India's Muslim population and the Muslim League was advocating a separate nation, which was dividing the country, the Muslims of Bihar decided to establish their own Party. Barrister Mohammad Yunus and Syed Abdul Aziz were two of the most influential Bihari Muslim leaders at the time. Yunus formed the Muslim Independent Party, stating their opposition to both Congress and the Muslim League by using the word \\"Independent\\", and Syed Abdul Aziz formed the Muslim United Party. In the 1937 election, the party emerged as the largest Muslim political party in Bihar and the second largest party in Bihar after Congress. Out of 40 seats reserved for Muslims, the Muslim Independent Party won 20. Syed Abdul Aziz's Muslim United Party won seven of the seats, four Muslims were elected on the Congress ticket, and eight Independent Muslim candidates were also elected. Yunus won for the party in the rural Patna West seat, and Sayyid Minatullah Rahmani won in Bhagalpur/Munger. The Muslim Independent Party formed the government in Bihar in 1937. Yunus, the party president, became the chief minister of Bihar on 1 April 1937. The Muslim Independent Party wanted to form an coalition government with Congress to prove to the Muslim League that Hindu and Muslims, these two biggest religious groups, could exist with equal dignity and rights, but Congress rejected Yunus's proposal and attempted to form a government alone. Youth leader Jayaprakash Narayan, a staunch socialist, strongly criticised Yunus's acceptance of the governor's invitation to form a government. His Congress Socialist Party organised protests against the Muslim Independent Party government. The party soon lost power, allowing Congress to form the government in the state.2 December 1937 Indian Nation Daily References Category:Islamic organisations based in India ","title":"Muslim Independent Party"},{"id":"20824467","text":"Earlston railway station, in the Scottish Borders village of Earlston, was a station on the now disused Berwickshire Railway.There were two platforms (the location served as a passing loop) and two sidings, cattle dock and goods shed.

A structural element of its superstructure, it may be constructed of concrete, steel, open grating, or wood. Sometimes the deck is covered a railroad bed and track, asphalt concrete, or other form of pavement for ease of vehicle crossing. A concrete deck may be an integral part of the bridge structure (T-beam or double tee structure) or it may be supported with I-beams or steel girders. When a bridge deck is installed in a through truss, it is sometimes called a floor system.Members of a Truss Bridge, by Benj. F. La Rue, Home Study Magazine, Published by the Colliery Engineer Company, Vol 3, No. 2, March 1898, pages 67-68. A suspended bridge deck will be suspended from the main structural elements on a suspension or arch bridge. On some bridges, such as a tied-arch or a cable-stayed, the deck is a primary structural element, carrying tension or compression to support the span. Structural analysis Structural engineers have several principal categories of bridge decks, for the purposes of analytic techniques. A beam deck is one where the deck and any supporting structure act together as a single beam. A grid deck uses beams and diaphragms as the supporting structure. The supporting system of a grid deck is analyzed using a grillage analysis. A slab deck is one where the deck is analyzed as a plate. If the slab has a stiffness that is different in two directions (at right angles), then the deck is known and analyzed as an orthotropic deck. A beam and slab deck is one where the beams may deflect somewhat independently, and any transverse forces are carried in the deck. A cellular deck is one where a number of thin slabs and webs will enclose cells within the deck. A boxgirder deck is one where the deck forms the top of the box girder during analysis. Railway bridge decks An open-deck railway bridge in Leflore County, Mississippi A railway bridge with its track and ties supported on load carrying elements of the superstructure (floor beams, stringers or girders) is called an open deck. When the track rests upon ballast, which is then carried by the superstructure of the bridge, it is called a ballasted deck. The term direct fixation is used when the rails are anchored directly to the superstructure of the bridge.

It was a mostly working-class city until about the mid-20th century, when it was annexed by the nearby city of Clarksville. The 19th century  The nineteenth century had the advent of the railroad through New Providence and the nearby hubs of Clarksville and Saint Bethlehem. It brought new industry to the town, and a rise in population. Though it did not compare to that of nearby Clarksville, it fed railroads lines that went to St. Louis, Memphis, Nashville, Chattanooga, Atlanta, and many other major hubs in the southern United States. During the Civil War, the town was a strategic hub, given its railways and proximity to Fort Donelson in Stewart County. After the war, the town began to decline.  The 20th century  The railroads still brought many jobs to the town in the 20th century, but the area paled in comparison to many of its neighboring communities. The two world wars and the building of nearby Fort Campbell had many young men enlisting in the United States Army. During the 1960s, the town was annexed into the city of Clarksville, which now incorporated Clarksville, St. Bethleham, parts of Sango, and other parts of Montgomery County.  Crime  Since New Providence became part of Clarksville, one of its rising problems was that of rising crime rates and gang enrollment. The area has been known for its notorious incidents of businesses being robbed and burglarized. It has also been known in the local area for its drug and illegal alcohol and substances problems. Numerous drug arrests have been made in the neighborhood, and local police have had problems with moonshine stills. In recent years, it has contributed to the rising murder rate in the Clarksville area, and the Clarksville, TN-KY metropolitan statistical area.

Early accounts of the history of the Old Swiss Confederacy are found in the numerous Swiss chronicles of the 14th to 16th centuries. As elsewhere in Europe, these late medieval and early modern were subjected to critical treatment with the emergence of modern historiography in the later 18th century. Swiss historiographical scholarship of the postmodern era (late 20th century) also followed international trends in its emphasis on topical history, such as economic history, legal history and social history and Switzerland's conduct during World War II. The first comprehensive historiography was Gottlieb Emanuel Haller's six-volume Bibliothek der Schweizergeschichte (1785‚Äì88), published still before the collapse of the Old Swiss Confederacy in the wake of the French Revolution. Later comprehensive treatments include Johannes von M√ºller's Geschichten Schweizerischer Eidgenossenschaft (1786‚Äì1806), Johannes Dierauer's Geschichte der Schweizerischen Eidgenossenschaft (1887‚Äì1917, with extensions up until 1974), the Handbuch der Schweizer Geschichte, (1972‚Äì77) and the Historical Dictionary of Switzerland (2002-2014). Swiss chronicles The Swiss loot the camp of Charles the Bold after the Battle of Grandson of 2 March 1476 (Berner Schilling, 1480s). The earliest works of Swiss history are the battle songs and folk songs in which the earliest Confederates celebrated their deeds, as well as the Swiss chronicles written mostly in the 15th and 16th centuries, especially the illustrated chronicles produced in the late 15th and early 16th centuries on behalf of the authorities of the city-states of Bern and Lucerne.Im Hof, p. 13. While these chronicles were written from the point of view of the individual states, even the earliest did address issues of all- Swiss significance in some detail. With the introduction of movable type in Europe, chroniclers could reach a wider audience and begin to write about Swiss history as a whole. The 1507 Chronicle of the Swiss Confederation by Petermann Etterlin exerted great influence on later writers because, as a printed work, it was the first to be generally available. Early modern period Humanist scholars such as Johannes Stumpf and Aegidius Tschudi connected the history of their time with the Roman era of Switzerland and to the accounts of the Helvetii,Im Hof, p. 14. giving a greater depth to the emerging discipline of history in Switzerland. This development came to a close with Josias Simler's 1576 De Helvetiorum republica libri duo, a sober account of the Confederacy's constitutional status and historical background. The work remained the definitive account of Swiss political history for centuries ‚Äì it saw some 30 editions up until the 18th century, and was immediately translated into German and French. The rest of the world learnt of Swiss history essentially through Simler's treatise. Title page of Merian's Topographia Helvetiae, Rhaetiae et Valesiae (1642, reprinted 1654). As the Swiss city-states grew more stratified and oligarchical, and as confessional, social and political barriers became more pronounced, the 17th century saw a shift of focus in historical writing from the affairs of the Confederacy to that of the individual state. The continuation of the last great work of Swiss humanist historiography, Franz Guilliman's De rebus Helvetiorum sive antiquitatum, was thwarted by partisan politics. The baroque appetite for curiosa was allayed by Matth√§us Merian's great engravings. Historical research bloomed again in the time of the Enlightenment, when as early as with Johann Jakob Wagner's 1680 Historia naturalis Helvetiae curiosa, the spirit of critical inquiry took hold in Swiss scholarship. Conditions were not optimal ‚Äì state archives remained mostly closed to private researchers and the zeitgeist favoured a heroic interpretation of history in a less than heroic present.Im Hof, p. 15. Still, the early 18th century saw the first critical editions of ancient sources (by Johann Jakob Bodmer in 1735) and the publication of the first Swiss historical journals (Helvetische Bibliothek, also by Bodmer, and Mercure Helv√©tique, both in 1735). The century's most significant work of historiography was the country's first historical dictionary, the 20-volume Allgemeines helvetisches eidgen√∂ssisches Lexikon in 20 volumes (1743‚Äì63), written by scholars from all cantons and edited by Johann Jakob Leu. The need for a historical overview was met by Fran√ßois-Joseph-Nicolas d'Alt de Tieffenthal's very patriotic Histoire des H√©lvetiens (1749‚Äì53), Alexander Ludwig von Wattenwyl's prelude to Swiss criticism Histoire de la Conf√©d√©ration h√©lvetique (1754) and Vinzenz Bernhard Tscharner's Historie der Eidgenossen (1756‚Äì71). These works were complemented by treatises on the early history of Switzerland, the Reformation in Switzerland or Swiss military service abroad, as well as an increasing number of reports by foreign travelers in Switzerland.Im Hof, p. 16. These works, in general, hewed closely to the received account of the foundation of the Old Swiss Confederacy as described in the Swiss chronicles of the 15th and 16th centuries. Modern historiographyEnlightenment and Napoleonic era= Title page of the first volume of von Haller's Bibliothek der Schweizer-Geschichte (1785). When Bernese historians Gottlieb Emanuel Haller and Uriel Freudenberger first publicly questioned the historicity of William Tell, they triggered a political scandal and caused tensions between Bern and Tell's traditional home state, Uri. Their 1760 book Der Wilhelm Tell. Ein d√§nisches M√§hrgen, in which they showed the Tell saga to be an adaptation of a Danish legend, was banned and burnt in public. The first comprehensive historiography was Gottlieb Emanuel Haller's six-volume Bibliothek der Schweizergeschichte (1785‚Äì88). The 19th century's most influential work of historiography was Johannes von M√ºller's epic and lively five-volume Geschichten Schweizerischer Eidgenossenschaft (1786‚Äì1806). It helped Switzerland, thrown into turmoil by Napoleon's violent overthrow of the Ancien R√©gime and the establishment of the short-lived Helvetic Republic, to find a sense of national identity and to refound the Confederation after Napoleon's fall.Im Hof, p. 17. The work, which did not go beyond the Swabian War of 1499 ‚Äì Switzerland's war of independence ‚Äì was soon continued in the works of an entire generation of historians. Robert Glutz von Blotzheim and Johann Jakob Hottinger in the German-speaking part of Switzerland as well as Louis Vuillemin and Charles Monnard in the Romandie translated and extended M√ºller's work, providing the new federal state founded in 1848 with a reasonably coherent common national history. =Popularization of history= In the period of historicism, learning from this national history became a general preoccupation, and dozens of works of popular history ‚Äì notably by the educator Heinrich Zschokke and by the liberal historian Andr√© Daguet ‚Äì were published to meet this demand. The democratic reforms of the 18th century caused a broadening of public education and the publication of innumerable historical textbooks. Cantonal archives along with the new Federal Archives were opened to researchers, and chairs of Swiss history were established in Swiss universities. The first historical society in Switzerland was founded in 1841. As the rationalist Enlightenment gave way to the more emotional period of Romanticism, the questioning of popular heroes grew more unpopular still, and the traditional account of Tell was reestablished for generations by Friedrich Schiller's play William Tell of 1804. =Late 19th to early 20th centuries= Von M√ºller's work was eventually supplanted by Johannes Dierauer's seminal Geschichte der Schweizerischen Eidgenossenschaft (1887‚Äì1917, with extensions up until 1974), which remains indispensable to modern research thanks to its thorough critical apparatus.Im Hof, p. 19. An important foundation for later research was laid in the later 19th century through the edition and publication of official documents, including those of the Old Confederacy and the Helvetic Republic, in voluminous series whose publication was not completed until 1966.Im Hof, p. 18. This tradition is being continued in the ongoing publication of Swiss diplomatic archives by several Swiss universities starting in 1979. With the 17th and 18th century seen by later 19th-century historians as uninteresting periods of stagnation, academic interest focused on the early history of Switzerland, whose discovery was aided by new archaeological methods, and, following European trends, on the medieval period and the Reformation. The conservative Roman Catholic cantons ‚Äì who had been defeated in the 1847 Sonderbund war ‚Äì also received little attention from scholars situated in the liberal Protestant mainstream of the time. The early 20th century saw the publication of great topical histories of Switzerland, including Eugen Huber's legal history (Geschichte und System des schweizerischen Privatrechts, 1893), Andreas Heusler's constitutional history (Schweizer Verfassungsgeschichte, 1920; supplanted by Hans Conrad Peyer's Verfassungsgeschichte of 1978) and Paul Schweizer's diplomatic history (Geschichte der schweizerischen Neutralit√§t, 1895; continued by Edgar Bonjour from 1946 on). =Later 20th century= On the whole, Swiss historiography up until the early 20th century was focused on the political and military history of Switzerland. The liberal, Radical intellectual mainstream, which viewed Swiss history as a steady progression of liberty culminating in the founding of the 1848 federal state, was dominant. Some academic attention also shifted to the economic and social history of Switzerland, which began to be treated in substantial monographs by William Rappard and Eduard Fueter in the 1910s. These developments, inspired by Anglo-American historiographical trends, were however cut short by the World Wars.Im Hof, p. 20. Attempts by non-historians including Robert Grimm to write a Socialist history of Switzerland had no impact. On the other hand, apologists of the Ancien R√©gime such as Gonzague de Reynold, who praised the perceived enlighted authoritarianism of the Old Confederacy, left an imprint on the generally conservative historiography of the post-World War II generation. One historian, Karl Meyer, even attempted to rehabilitate the historicity of the national founding legends in a 1933 work.Im Hof, p. 21. The early Cold War period's emphasis on geistige Landesverteidigung ‚Äì \\"intellectual defense of the country\\" ‚Äì did also not encourage a re-thinking of Swiss history. It was only with the societal upheavals associated with the year 1968, which in Switzerland as elsewhere in the West began to move the mainstream of academic thought to the political Left, that the approach of Swiss historians began to shift again. Picking up where Rappard and Fueter had left off, historians of the 1960s and 1970s published large treatises on the social and economic history of Switzerland. Adapting the newer methods of historical research in the United States, the United Kingdom and France, researchers used disciplines such as historical demographics and ecology to support their work. Inspired by the Annales School, the postulate of \\"total history\\" ‚Äì a comprehensive view of history aiming to understand long-term structures instead of explaining the current state of affairs ‚Äì is now well- established in Swiss historiography. Contemporary works thumb Dierauer's seminal work of 1887‚Äì1917 was eventually supplanted as the leading work of Swiss historiography by the Handbuch der Schweizer Geschichte, a collaborative work of 1972‚Äì77, which remains largely rooted in the conservative mainstream of the early 1960s. A historians' \\"committee for a new history of Switzerland\\", avowedly following the new \\"total history\\" approach, published its three-volume Nouvelle histoire de la Suisse et des Suisses in 1982/83; a condensed one-volume edition (Geschichte der Schweiz und der Schweizer, last reprinted 2006) is currently the standard university textbook of Swiss history. The principal ongoing project of Swiss historiography is the Historical Dictionary of Switzerland, which as of 2008 has reached its seventh volume (letters J to L). It is also accessible online, as are more and more topical historical dictionaries, including SIKART (a biographical dictionary of Swiss artists) and the Culinary Heritage of Switzerland project (a historical encyclopedia of Swiss food).

Bradman's men went undefeated in their 34 matches; this unprecedented feat by a Test side touring England earned them the sobriquet The Invincibles. A leg spinner, Ring was not prominent in the team's success. Regarded as the last bowler to be selected for the team, Ring played in only the Fifth Test, taking one wicket for 44 runs (1/44) for the match and scoring nine runs in his only innings after replacing off spinner Ian Johnson, who was dropped for poor form. Along with Ron Hamence and Colin McCool, neither of whom played in a Test during the tour, Ring called himself \\"ground staff\\" because of the paucity of the trio's on-field duties in the major matches and they often sang ironic songs about their status. For the entire tour, Ring took 60 first-class wickets at a bowling average of 21.81, the most expensive among Australia's frontline bowlers. As England agreed to have a new ball available 55 overs after the start of each innings in the Tests‚Äîmore frequently than usual‚Äîfast bowling dominated over spin, and Ring was used primarily in the non-Test tour matches. Outside the Tests, only Bill Johnston bowled more overs, and Ring was used to relieve the workload on Bradman's pace spearheads to keep them fresh for the Tests. Ring scored 150 first-class runs at a batting average of 16.66 during the tour, and a top- score of 53 was his only effort beyond 50. Background Doug Ring is congratulated by his colleagues at the Melbourne Department of Commerce on 25 February 1948 after being selected to tour England. Ring made his Test debut in last international match of the 1947‚Äì48 Australian season, the Fifth Test against India. Australia rested a few of its players and some fringe cricketers such as Ring and Sam Loxton were given a debut so that their ability could be evaluated before the tour of England. Ring took six wickets for the match and was selected for the tour along with Loxton, who scored 80.Piesse, pp. 156, 335. Early tour Australia traditionally fielded its first-choice team in the tour opener, which was customarily against Worcestershire. Ring was omitted from this match, despite having replaced Colin McCool to make his Test debut in the fifth and final match against India in Australia during the 1947‚Äì48 season that preceded the tour of England; Ring had taken six wickets for 120 runs (6/120). Fellow leg spinner McCool and off spinner Ian Johnson‚Äîwho had been regular Test players since World War II‚Äîwere the two slow bowlers picked as Australia started their campaign with an innings victory. Ring was called into the team for the second tour match against Leicestershire. He made two runs with the bat before being run out as Australia ended on 448. Ring took two top order wickets to leave the hosts at 3/56 before returning to take three late wickets as Leicestershire lost their last four wickets without addition to be all out for 130. Ring ended with 5/45. Made to follow on, Leicestershire scored 147 and lost by an innings. Ring failed to add to his wicket tally in the county's second innings, conceding 26 runs. Ring was rested for the next match against Yorkshire, on a damp pitch that suited slower bowling. It was the closest Australia came to defeat on the tour, as they scraped home by four wickets in a low scoring affair.Fingleton, pp. 53‚Äì55. The Australians travelled to London to play Surrey at The Oval, and Ring made two in the tourists' 632. He then took 3/34 in the first innings, removing Arthur McIntyre, Alec Bedser and Jim Laker. He bowled five wicketless overs in the second innings as Surrey were defeated by an innings. Ring then took 1/18 and 0/52 from a total of 44 overs as Australia amassed 4/414 declared and defeated Cambridge University by an innings. In the following match, Australia crushed Essex by an innings and 451 runs, its largest winning margin for the summer. On the first day, Australia set a world record by scoring 721, the most first-class runs made in a single day's play, but Ring was unable to contribute to the surfeit of scoring, making only one. He bowled 18 overs and conceded a total of 35 runs without success as the hosts were bowled out for 83 and 187. This was followed by another innings victory, this time over Oxford University. After having failed to score more than two runs in any of his first three innings of the tour, Ring came to the wicket at 7/317 and scored 53, adding 87 runs in partnership with fellow Victorian Sam Loxton before being bowled. After Australia were out for 431, Ring took a match total of 1/51, removing Geoffrey Keighley as the hosts made 185 and 156. The next match was against the Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord's. The MCC fielded seven players who would represent England in the Tests,N- and were basically a full strength Test team, while Australia fielded their first- choice team. It was a chance for both teams to gain a psychological advantage. At this point of the tour, Ring had only taken ten wickets at an average of 28.30, while McCool had taken 17 at 14.35. McCool retained the first-choice leg spinner's position and took 4/35 as Australia won by an innings. Ring was rested for Australia'a first non-victory of the tour, a rain-affected draw against Lancashire. He returned for the match against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge, which was also drawn. Ring took 2/31 in the first innings, both of his victims being stumped, as the hosts made 179, before making an unbeaten nine in Australia's reply of 400. He then shouldered the heaviest workload as Nottinghamshire made 8/299 in the second innings, the highest score against the Australians thus far on the tour. Ring bowled 43 overs and took 4/104. He removed Joe Hardstaff junior, who had made the first century against Australia for the season, triggering a collapse that saw the loss of four wickets for 27 runs to leave the hosts at 8/289. He also dismissed future Test batsman Reg Simpson for 70. The hosts were 32 runs short of making Australia bat again, but held on for a draw as time ran out. Against Hampshire, Ring took 1/19 as the home team made 195 after being put into bat on a drying pitch. He made a duck as Australia collapsed to 117 to trail by 78 runs, the first time the tourists had conceded a first innings lead during the English summer. Ring was not required to bat in the Australian second innings, as Hampshire were bowled out for 103 in 42.5 overs and Australia then reached their target of 182 to win by eight wickets. Ring had a final chance to push for Test selection in the innings win over Sussex, the last match before the First Test. He bowled only two wicketless overs as the pacemen skittled the hosts for 86, and did not bat as Australia amassed 5/549 declared. He then took three consecutive wickets as Sussex fell from 5/98 to 8/109 before eventually being bowled out for 138. Ring ended with 3/42 from 13 overs. Test omission Ring's performances were not enough for him to take McCool's place in Bradman's first-choice team. Instead, Bill Johnston, who had taken 10/40 against Yorkshire and 11/117 against Hampshire on damp surfaces, was given the place on the opening morning of the First Test when rain appeared likely. Johnston then took nine wickets in Australia's victory, cementing his position in the team. This left Ring jostling with the other spinners‚ÄîJohnson and McCool‚Äîfor one spot in the Test team. After the First Test, Ring returned to action as Australia completed an innings victory over Northamptonshire. He took 1/31 in the hosts' first innings of 119, before making an unbeaten 16 in partnering McCool in an unbroken stand of 39 as Australia declared at 8/352. In the second innings, he took four of the last five wickets and ended with 4/31 as Northamptonshire collapsed from 5/142 to be all out for 169. This was followed by a drawn match against Yorkshire, in which Ring scored three runs and was not asked to bowl in the first innings. Yorkshire were bowled out for 206 from 90.1 overs; Bradman called on Ernie Toshack and Johnston to bowl 81.1 overs and did not entrust the other bowlers with substantial work. Ring then took 1/22 in the second innings as the match petered out into a draw. Ring was overlooked for the Second Test at Lord's as Bradman retained the same XI, despite the incumbent spinner Johnson managing only 1/85 in the First Test. Australia won convincingly by 409 runs. The next match was against Surrey, starting the day after the finish of the Test. Ring took 3/51 from 21.2 overs in the first innings, leading the way in terms of wickets and overs; most of the Test bowlers were given a light workload. He then contributed an unbeaten 15 in Australia's first innings of 389. After Australia took a first innings lead of 168, Ring bowled another 24 overs in the second innings and took 1/54. He twice dismissed Jack Parker, who had top-scored in each innings with 76 and 81. Australia then chased down the 122 runs for victory in less than an hour, to complete a 10-wicket win. In the match against Gloucestershire immediately before the Third Test, Ring did not bat as Australia reached 7/774 declared, which was their highest score of the tour and which underpinned an innings victory. Ring took two wickets in the space of three runs, including Test batsman Charlie Barnett, to end with 2/83 in 25 overs as the hosts made 279. After stand-in captain Lindsay Hassett enforced the follow on‚ÄîBradman had rested himself‚ÄîRing removed Test batsmen Barnett and George Emmett to leave Gloucestershire at 2/20. After resting he resumed bowling with the score at 4/93 and took three more wickets, as the hosts fell to 9/109 and then 132 all out. Ring took 5/47 and bowled the most overs (25) in the second innings. Johnson, however, took 11/100 in the match and retained his place in the team for the Third Test at Old Trafford.Perry, p. 176. The Test was drawn amid inclement weather. Ring then played against Middlesex in Australia's only match before the Fourth Test. He took one wicket in each innings for a match total of 2/57. After only scoring two in the first innings, Ring opened the batting with McCool in the second innings, with a target of only 22 runs. They promptly reached the target without loss, with Ring unbeaten on 15. This was not enough for Ring to force his way into the team for the Fourth Test at Headingley. Australia persisted with the same bowling attack and posted 3/404 in the second innings, setting a world record for the highest successful run- chase to win a Test. Former Australian Test leg spinner Bill O'Reilly criticised the Australians for using only one spinner, pointing out that he and Chuck Fleetwood-Smith, a left-arm wrist spinner, had taken 17 wickets between them during the last Anglo-Australian Test at Headingley in 1938. O'Reilly cited the 1934 Headingley Test the same venue in 1934 in which he and Clarrie Grimmett had significant success for Australia, and said that at least one of McCool or Ring, should have played alongside Johnson.O'Reilly, p. 110. England had been at 2/423 in their first innings, before collapsing to be 496 all out; O'Reilly blamed Australia's lack of early success on the absence of a leg spinner, attributing England's collapse to inept batting.O'Reilly, pp. 119‚Äì122. Immediately after the Headingley Test, Ring scored four as Australia amassed 456 against Derbyshire. He bowled the most overs in the first innings, taking 3/73 from 24 overs as the hosts made 240. He then took 0/23 from six overs after Australia enforced the follow on and ultimately won the match by an innings. In the next match against Glamorgan, Ring led the bowling with 3/34, including the wicket of opposition captain Wilf Wooller as the hosts folded for 197. Ring did not bat, as rain ended the match early, with Australia's score at 3/215. Ring was then rested for the match against Warwickshire, which Australia won by nine wickets. Bradman recalled Ring as Australia faced and drew with Lancashire for the second time on the tour. Ring scored 17 not out as Australia made 321; he then dismissed Test players Ken Cranston (who was captaining Lancashire) and Dick Pollard, to end with 2/25 in the first innings. In the county's second innings Ring bowled 22 of the 57 overs during which Australia reduced Lancashire to 7/199 before time ran out. He took 2/88, including the wicket of Cranston for the second time. In a non- first-class match against Durham, the last fixture before the Fifth Test, Ring made an unbeaten single as Australia scored 282. He then took 1/24 as the hosts fell to 5/73 in their first innings, before rain washed out the match. Fifth Test After taking only seven wickets at 61.00 in the first four Tests, Johnson was dropped for the Fifth Test at The Oval; Ring replaced him as the team's spinner. English skipper Norman Yardley won the toss and elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch, which was regarded as a surprising move by the majority of the press corps. Precipitation in the previous week caused an extremely wet outfield, which meant that the Test could not start until midday had passed. Former Australian Test batsman Jack Fingleton speculated that the Australians would have bowled if they had won the toss.Fingleton, p. 183. Along with the effects of the rain on the pitch, the humid conditions assisted the Australian fast bowlers, who were able to make the ball bounce at variable heights. Led by Lindwall, who took 6/20, Australia skittled England for 52, and Ring did not get a chance to bowl. Ring then made nine before being caught by Jack Crapp in the slips as Australia replied with 389.Arlott, p. 130. England started their second innings 337 runs in arrears late on day two and resumed at 1/54 the next morning. During the first session, Ring bowled a tidy spell of 13 overs as Denis Compton and Len Hutton added only 67 runs for the session.Fingleton, p. 189. Ring did not bowl consistently or accurately, and although the batsman hit him regularly, they did not place their shots, which often went to the fielders.O'Reilly, p. 154. There were four men in the off side ring and they had much work to do as Hutton hit the ball there repeatedly.Arlott, p. 134. The English batsmen progressed steadily although Ring had one confident appeal for lbw against Compton.O'Reilly, p. 155. Later in the day, Ring dismissed debutant Allan Watkins for two to take his only wicket of the match. Watkins lofted a delivery from Ring to the leg side straight into the hands of Hassett, who did not need to move from his position on the boundary, leaving England at 6/167. The hosts were eventually bowled out early on the fourth morning for 188, sealing defeat by an innings and 149 runs. Ring had taken 1/44 after sending down the most overs in the innings (28), including 13 maidens. Later tour matches After the Fifth Test seven matches remained on Bradman's quest to go through a tour of England without defeat. Australia rested Ring for the match against Kent, which Australia won by an innings. This was followed by a game against the Gentlemen of England, the leading amateurs in the country. Ring was not required to bat as Australia amassed 5/610 before declaring. He then bowled the most overs in the first innings, sending down 25.3 and taking the wickets of English Test batsmen Bill Edrich, Trevor Bailey and Freddie Brown. Ring ended with 3/74 as the hosts were bowled out for 245. Australia enforced the follow on and Ring again shouldered the heaviest workload. He removed Reg Simpson to break the opening stand of 60. The Gentlemen progressed to 3/217 before Ring dismissed Edrich for 128, followed by George Mann for a duck without further addition to the score. Ring then bowled Yardley and dismissed Wilf Wooller soon after, leaving the hosts at 7/240; they were eventually all out for 284, which sealed an innings victory for Australia. Ring ended with 5/70 from 32 overs. The following match against Somerset followed a similar pattern. Ring did not bat as Australia declared at 5/560. He then took 2/17 in the first innings and was not required to bowl in the second innings as the hosts collapsed for 115 and 71 to cede another innings victory. Ring was rested for the match against the South of England. Australia declared at 7/522 before the hosts made 298; rain ended the match before the second innings could start. Australia's biggest challenge in the post-Test tour matches was against the Leveson-Gower's XI. During the previous Australian tour of England in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit, but this time Bradman insisted that only six current England Test players be allowed to play for the hosts.Fingleton, pp. 207‚Äì209. Bradman then fielded a full-strength team.Perry (2005), pp. 253‚Äì254. He made only one change from the team that won the Fifth Test, dropping Ring for Johnson. Australia led by 312 runs on the first innings before persistent rain ended the match. The tour ended with two non- first-class matches against Scotland. In the first, Ring made an unbeaten three as Australia scored 236. He bowled five overs without success in the first innings, before removing four of the first five batsmen in the second innings and ending with 4/20. Scotland made 85 and 111 to lose by an innings. In the second match, Ring was the costliest bowler in the first innings, conceding 42 runs without success in Scotland's 178. After Australia declared at 6/407, Ring took the leading figures of 4/30, including the wickets of both openers as Australia ended the tour with another innings triumph. Role Ring's batting performance during the tour. The bars are the runs scored per innings (red for Test innings, pink for other first-class innings). The blue line is the average of the five most recent innings; the dots indicate alt=Ring started the season with three scores of two or less and then scored his only score beyond 50 on his fourth innings. He then had an alternating sequence of single-digit scores and scores between 10 and 20, the latter being not outs. His last score, in Test innings, was nine. His average of the five most recent innings fluctuated between 13 and 28. Although the 1948 tour of England was an unprecedented triumph for the Australians, Ring's leg spin was not prominent in the success. He jostled with McCool and Johnson for a position as Bradman selected only one specialist spinner in the Tests. Headlined by Lindwall, Miller and Johnston, the faster bowlers dominated the bowling attack. With a new ball allowed at intervals of 55 overs in Tests, a period that usually elapsed sooner than the 200 runs stipulated under the usual rule of the time, spinners were given few opportunities and made little impact in the big matches. Bradman and his fellow tour selectors‚Äîvice-captain Lindsay Hassett and Arthur Morris‚Äîpicked a pace-dominated attack to exploit the more frequently shiny ball, as a new ball swings and seams more for fast bowlers, while slower bowlers can impart more spin with a worn ball.Perry (2005), p. 223. In its summary of the tour, Wisden said that Ring \\"was never a trump card in the pack\\". Such was the strength of the bowling that Ring's 60 first-class wickets at an average of 21.81 made him the most expensive of the regular bowlers on the tour. Among the seven frontline bowlers, Ring's strike rate of 54.26 was the second least incisive and his economy rate of 40.20 was the second most expensive. Although McCool was less economical, he had the second highest strike rate, and while Toshack had the worst strike rate, he was the second most economical of the Australians in the first-class fixtures. Ring did most of his work in the non-Test first-class matches, in which he sent down 3,088 deliveries. This was second only to Johnston, who bowled 3,251. In contrast, Lindwall and Miller sent down only 2,105 and 1,749 deliveries outside the Tests respectively, as Bradman sought to preserve them for hostile bursts with the new ball against England. Along with Lindwall, Ring was the equal third highest wicket-taker in first-class matches excluding the Tests, with 59 scalps, doing a large part of the work in the county matches so that the leading bowlers could conserve energy for the Tests.Perry (2005), pp. 223‚Äì227. Ring had limited opportunities with the bat. Along with Toshack and Johnston, he invariably batted in the bottom three positions.N- This was because Australia's other frontline bowlers tended to be capable with the bat; Lindwall, Miller, and McCool all made Test centuries and more than nine triple-figure first-class scores, with the latter pair averaging over 30 in Tests. Johnson passed fifty on 21 occasions in his first-class career, six of them in Tests.Cashman, pp. 152, 175, 199, 258. The strength of the batting side meant that Ring batted only 14 times in his 19 first-class matches on the tour, as Australia often batted only once and won by an innings, and several times declared their first innings closed before Ring could bat. Ring scored 150 runs at 16.66, an aggregate and average better than only Toshack's. He passed 50 only once, and his tour batting average was lower than his career benchmark of 23.25.Cashman, p. 258. Ring also took 12 catches. Ring and fellow fringe members of the squad McCool and Ron Hamence, would refer themselves as the \\"ground-staff\\", as it was unlikely that the tour selectors would include them in the Test team during the tour.Donald Bradman referred to these players as the \\"Groundbowlers\\" in an appreciation of McCool for the 1959 testimonial year granted by Somerset. The trio were known to sing ironic songs about the paucity of their on-field duties during the tour.Fingleton, p. 196.

Background Raphael was Jewish, and the son of multi-millionaire financier Albert Raphael, who was part of a banking dynasty that in the 1920s rivalled the Rothschild family,http://www.express.co.uk/news/world-war-1/467102/Mother-reunited-at- last-with-her-First-World-War-hero-son John Raphael was educated at Merchant Taylors' School and St John's College, Oxford. Rugby in England rugby jersey Raphael won his first cap in 1902 when England took on Wales in the Home Nations Championship. A centre, winger or full-back, he also played in the 1905 and 1906 Championships as well as in Test matches against both France and New Zealand. The only points of his career came through a try which he scored in 1906 when playing Scotland. He captained the 1910 British Lions tour to Argentina, which included the South American nation's inaugural Test match. Raphael authored a book Modern Rugby Football which was published posthumously by his mother in 1918 Cricket Raphael played his cricket as a specialist batsman and most of his appearances at first-class level were for either Surrey or Oxford University. He also played first-class matches for the Marylebone Cricket Club, Gentlemen of England, London County and an England XI amongst others. Four of Raphael's five centuries were scored for Oxford University, including his career best score of 201 which he made against Yorkshire, who had the bowling of Wilfred Rhodes at their disposal. It remains the only double hundred to be made by an Oxford cricketer against Yorkshire. His only century for Surrey came in the 1904 County Championship, which he captained his county for much of, scoring 111 against Worcestershire. A part- time bowler, his three first-class wickets were of Samuel Coe, Lord Dalmeny and Test cricketer John King. Politics Raphael was involved in politics as a supporter of the Liberal Party. He stood for the UK parliament as Liberal candidate for Croydon at the 1909 Croydon by-election. In a three-way contest he finished second.The Bystander: An Illustrated Weekly, Devoted to Travel, Literature, Art, the Drama, Progress, Locomotion, Volume 17, 1908 Military In World War I Raphael served with the King's Royal Rifle Corps as a Lieutenant and died of wounds in 1917 at the Battle of Messines, while fighting in the country of his birth. He is buried at Lijssenthoek Military Cemetery near Poperinge, West Flanders, Belgium. Mrs Harriette Raphael, his mother, had her ashes buried next to his grave in 1929. A memorial to Raphael was erected by his mother at St_Jude%27s_Church,_Hampstead_Garden_Suburb , to whom she bequeathed the family home on her death.

Bradman's men were undefeated in their 34 matches and this unprecedented feat by a Test side touring England earned them the sobriquet The Invincibles. A frontline leg spinner and middle-order batsman, McCool was not prominent in the team's success. Although McCool started his Test career strongly, his form began to decline during the previous Australian season. After starting the tour in Bradman's first-choice team, a bloodied callus on his spinning finger troubled McCool. This prevented him from bowling for prolonged periods, and along with Ron Hamence, he was one of two squad members who did not play a Test on tour. Along with Doug Ring, the trio called themselves \\"ground staff\\" because of the paucity of their on- field duties in the major matches and they often sang ironic songs about their status. During the tour, McCool took 57 first-class wickets at a bowling average of 17.82; he was the fifth most prolific wicket-taker and had the fourth best average among Australia's seven frontline bowlers. With England agreeing to have a new ball available after every 55 overs, more frequently than the old rule of replacing the ball after every 200 runs, fast bowling dominated over spin. As a result, McCool did not play in the Tests, but was used heavily in the tour matches so the leading pacemen could conserve their energy for the important matches. Outside the Tests, McCool had the fourth heaviest workload among the regular bowlers, although overall, he delivered the least overs because of his injured finger. McCool took five wickets in an innings three times, his best return being 7/78 against Cambridge University. Although McCool also played as a frontline batsman during his career, his performances during the tour were far below his usual standards, scoring only 306 runs at a batting average of 20.40 with three half-centuries. However, he remained prominent with his fielding, taking 20 catches in 17 matches. Background Following the resumption of cricket after World War II, McCool had started his Test career strongly. After making his debut in a one-off Test against New Zealand in 1945-46, he played in all five Tests against England during the 1946-47 home season, scoring 272 runs at an average of 54.40 and taking 18 wickets at just over 27 apiece.Cashman et al., p. 199. Wisden said his batting featured \\"wristy cuts\\" and \\"vigorous hooks\\", adding that there were \\"few better players of spin bowling on a difficult pitch\\". Wisden judged his slow and loopy leg spin \\"a clever mixture of leg-breaks and googlies\\". However, when India toured Australia for the first time in 1947-48, McCool played in three Tests without much success, scoring only 46 runs and taking only four wickets. As a result, he was dropped for the last Test.  Early tour  Nevertheless, McCool gained selection as part of Australian team to tour England in 1948 under Donald Bradman. Australia had traditionally fielded its first-choice team in the opening match of the tour, which was customarily against Worcestershire. Although he was only selected sporadically during the preceding Test series against India, McCool was chosen alongside off spinner Ian Johnson and appeared to be part of Bradman's Test plans. The home side batted first and McCool took his maiden wicket on English soil, having former England captain Bob Wyatt stumped by fellow Queenslander Don Tallon. He removed Wyatt's replacement for a duck without further addition to the score and ended with 2/38 as the home side were dismissed for 233. McCool returned the favour during Australia's innings. Coming in at No. 5, he made a fifth ball duck and was part of a middle-order collapse that saw Australia lose 4/38 before steadying to declare at 8/462. In the second innings, McCool did the bulk of the damage, taking four of the five first wickets‚Äîtwo of whom were stumped by Tallon‚Äîto leave the hosts at 5/122 before Australia completed an innings victory. McCool had been the most successful bowler in the opening match. McCool was rested for the second tour match against Leicestershire, which Australia won by an innings. The next match against Yorkshire‚Äîon a damp pitch favourable to slower bowling‚Äîwas the closest Australia came to defeat for the whole tour.Fingleton, pp. 53-55. McCool made three in the first innings as Australia replied to Yorkshire's 71 with 101. After the hosts were bowled out for 89 in their second innings, Australia collapsed to 5/20 in pursuit of 60 for victory when McCool arrived at the crease. To make matters worse, Sam Loxton was injured and could not bat, so Australia effectively only had four wickets in hand and faced the prospect of losing to an English county for the first time since 1912. McCool scored five before hitting a long hop back to left-arm spinner Johnny Wardle to leave Australia at 6/31.Fingleton, p. 55. However, Australia lost no further batsmen and scraped home by four wickets. McCool's leg spin was used as Keith Miller and Bill Johnston bowled almost unchanged for the entire match.Fingleton, p. 56. McCool was rested as the Australians travelled to London to play Surrey at The Oval and won by an innings. McCool returned for the next match, which was Cambridge University. After going wicketless for 31 runs in the first innings, he did not bat as Australia declared at 4/414 in reply to the hosts' 167. In the second innings, McCool took the first four wickets‚Äîincluding two stumpings by Ron Saggers‚Äîto leave the hosts at 4/73. He returned to take three more wickets and end with 7/78 as Cambridge fell for 196 to lose by an innings and 51 runs. McCool was rested as Australia defeated Essex by an innings and 451 runs, its largest winning margin for the summer. During this match, the other batsmen set a world record by scoring 721 on the first day, the most first-class runs compiled in a day's play.Fingleton, pp. 65-67. He returned for the innings victory against Oxford University. McCool made his first substantial contribution with the bat, coming in at 5/214 and scoring 50 in a 91-run partnership with Loxton as Australia made 431. He removed Indian Test cricketer Abdul Hafeez Kardar in the first innings, before taking 3/29 in the second as Australia won by an innings. The next match was against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord's. The MCC fielded seven players who would represent England in the Tests, and were basically a full strength Test team, while Australia fielded their first-choice team. It was a chance to gain a psychological advantage, with Len Hutton, Denis Compton and Bill Edrich‚Äîthree of England's top four batsmen‚Äîall playing. Batting at No. 8, McCool made a duck as Australia collapsed late in their innings, losing 5/54 to be bowled out for 552. He was not required to bowl in the first innings as the three pacemen Ray Lindwall, Ernie Toshack and Miller skittled England for 189. McCool was given the shortest spell of the frontline bowlers in the second innings as the fast bowlers again made early inroads. He sent down 7.2 overs, and disposed of the tail, removing the last four wickets, including MCC and England captain Norman Yardley. McCool ended with 4/35 as the MCC lost their last four wickets for 28 to be all out for 205, giving Australia a victory by an innings and 158 runs. Four matches followed the MCC fixture before the First Test at Trent Bridge. McCool was rested for the first of these against Lancashire at Manchester, a rain-affected draw that was Australia's first non-victory of the season. He returned for the following match against Nottinghamshire, which was drawn, but had little success, taking a total of 0/68. He failed to maximise his promotion to No. 4, making only 17 as Australia scored 400 in their only innings. McCool did not get any more opportunities to push for selection, as he was rested from the next two matches against Hampshire and Sussex. Australia won the former by eight wickets after conceding a first innings lead for the first time on the tour, before winning the second by an innings by 325 runs.  Test omission  Bill Johnston‚Äîa left arm bowler who could bowl both pace and spin‚Äîwas not initially in Bradman's plan for the First Test at Trent Bridge. However, Bradman changed his mind on the morning when rain was forecast. Johnston was played in the hope of exploiting a wet wicket; he had previously taken match-winning figures of 10/40 and 11/117 against Yorkshire and Hampshire respectively on rain- affected surfaces. In addition, McCool had been struggling with an injury on his spinning finger, and Bradman was worried McCool would not have the endurance required for a five-day Test, which was two days longer than a normal tour match. Johnston's inclusion at the expense of McCool was the only difference between the team for the First Test and those against Worcestershire and the MCC. Johnston subsequently cemented his position by taking nine wickets in the match‚Äîthe most among the Australians.Fingleton, pp. 86-88. Johnson, the only specialist spinner chosen, took 1/85. Between Tests, McCool was recalled for the match against Northamptonshire. He took 1/19 in the first innings before coming in at the fall of the fifth wicket and scoring an unbeaten 50 as Australia declared at 8/352. McCool only bowled three overs in the second innings and went wicketless as Australia won by an innings. Johnson, the incumbent Test spinner, took 4/59. In the second match before the Second Test, against Yorkshire, McCool made only four and seven not out before Australia declared in their second innings. After not being bowled in the first innings, he took 2/33 in the last hour of the match as Yorkshire ended at 4/85 to secure a draw. McCool was overlooked for the Second Test at Lord's, where Australia fielded the same XI that had won the First Test by eight wickets. Bradman's men went on to complete a crushing win by 409 runs, and Johnson registered match figures of 3/75. The next match was against Surrey and started the day after the Second Test. McCool bowled only three overs in the first innings, before contributing 26 with the bat in Australia's reply. After the tourists had taken a first innings lead of 168, McCool bowled heavily as Bradman eased the workload on his Test players in the second innings. McCool removed Surrey's top three batsmen‚Äîtwo of them stumped by Saggers‚Äîto leave the hosts at 3/94. A 107-run seventh wicket stand saw Surrey recover to 6/267 before McCool took three of the last four wickets to end the innings at 289. McCool ended with 6/113 from 45.5 overs, having bowled approximately 40% of the overs. Australia chased down the 122 runs required for victory in less than hour to complete a 10-wicket win. In the following match against Gloucestershire before the Third Test, McCool came to the crease late on the first day with Australia at 5/529. Unbeaten on eight at stumps, with the score at 5/560, he continued the next morning and proceeded to add 140 for the sixth wicket with Loxton, before falling for 76, his highest first-class score of the season. Australia reached 7/774 declared, its highest of the tour, laying the foundation for an innings victory. McCool bowled a total of 19 overs to end with 0/51, while Johnson took 11/100 and retained his place for the Third Test at Old Trafford, which was drawn amid inclement weather. The match against Middlesex was the only fixture between the Tests. McCool toiled for 18 overs before snaring the last two wickets to end with 2/54 after the hosts had batted first. He made a duck as Australia scored 317 to take a 114-run lead. In the second innings, McCool took 3/54 including the wickets of John Dewes and Leslie Compton as the hosts lost 4/22 to be all out for 135. With only 22 runs needed for victory, Bradman let McCool and fellow leg spinner Doug Ring open the batting. The pair duly saw Australia home without losing a wicket, with McCool on seven. McCool was again overlooked for the Fourth Test at Headingley, in which Australia posted 3/404 in the second innings to win by seven wickets, setting a world record for the highest successful run-chase in a Test. Immediately after the Headingley Test, McCool made 31‚Äîbatting at No. 8‚Äîas Australia amassed 456 against Derbyshire. After taking 0/45 in the first innings, McCool bounced back as Australia enforced the follow on. A 100-run second wicket partnership by Arnold Townsend and Denis Smith took Derbyshire to 1/110. McCool removed Townsend for 46 and quickly dismissed the next two batsmen to leave Derbyshire at 4/116. He returned with the score at 5/163 and took three further wickets in close succession to dismiss the hosts for 182, sealing victory by an innings. McCool ended with 6/77 from 29 overs. In the next match against Glamorgan, McCool neither batted nor bowled in a rain-affected draw that did not reach the second innings. In the following fixture against Warwickshire, McCool did not bowl in the first innings and scored 19, before taking 4/56 in the second innings, helping to set up a win by nine wickets. McCool was then rested as Australia faced and drew with Lancashire for the second time on the tour. He returned for the non-first-class match against Durham, and came to the crease with Australia in trouble at 3/22. He top-scored with 64 to help Australia reach 282 all out. McCool took 1/17 as the hosts fell to 5/73 in reply when rain ended the match after the first day. After taking only seven wickets at 61.00 in the first four Tests, Johnson was dropped for the Fifth Test at The Oval. However, it was fellow leg spinner Ring and not McCool who was called in. Australia crushed England by an innings and 149 runs to take the series 4-0.  Later tour matches  Seven matches remained on Bradman's quest to go through a tour of England without defeat. Australia batted first against Kent and McCool made a duck in their total of 361. He then took 2/13 as the hosts were skittled for 51. Forced to follow on, Kent were bowled out for 124 to lose by an innings, but not before attacking McCool and taking 42 runs from his five wicketless overs. In the next match against the Gentlemen of England, McCool was rested as Australia amassed 5/610 and won by an innings. He returned for the next match against Somerset. Promoted to fourth drop, McCool could only make six as Australia declared at 5/560. Somerset reached 2/63 in reply before McCool took four quick wickets amid their collapse to 7/68. McCool ended with 4/21 as the hosts folded for 115. Forced to follow on, Somerset reached 3/49 before McCool took four of the next five wickets as the hosts fell to 8/66, and eventually 71 all out, handing Australia victory by an innings and 374 runs. In the following match against the South of England, McCool batted at No. 8 and made five as Australia declared at 7/522. McCool toiled for 36 overs in taking 2/89 as the hosts were bowled out for 298 when rain caused the match to end in a draw. Australia's biggest challenge in the post-Test tour matches was against the Leveson-Gower's XI. During the last tour in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit, but this time Bradman insisted only six current England Test players be allowed to play.Fingleton, pp. 207-209. After the hosts had complied, Bradman selected a full-strength team,Perry, pp. 253-254. with the only difference from the Fifth Test team being Ring's omission for Johnson, so McCool was left out. After Australia had taken a 312-run first innings lead, the match ended in a draw after multiple rain delays. The tour ended with two non-first-class matches against Scotland. In the first match, McCool came in with Australia 4/91 and put on 109 with Arthur Morris to consolidate the innings. When McCool was out for 52 and Morris for 109, the Australians collapsed and lost 6/36 to end with 236. McCool took 1/19 and 1/20 as Australia enforced the follow on and completed an innings victory. In the second match, McCool took 3/31 as the hosts made 178 after batting first. He opened the innings with the bat and made 108 in three hours, with 13 fours. Australia declared at 6/407 and McCool took 0/19 in seven overs as Australia wrapped up the tour with another innings victory.  Role  A chart showing McCool's batting performance during the tour. The runs scored per innings are represented by the bars, with the red bars being Test innings and the pink bars being other first-class innings. The blue line is the average of the five most recent innings and the dots indicate not outs. A frontline leg spinner and middle-order batsman, McCool was not prominent in the team's success. Although he had started his Test career strongly, McCool's form began to decline in the previous Australian season of 1947-48\\\\. In his first full Test season in 1946-47, which featured five Tests against England, McCool batted at No. 6 and scored 95 and 104 not out. He also took five wickets in an innings on two occasions. He ended the series with 272 runs at an average of 54.40 and took 18 wickets at just over 27 apiece. However, in the following season he made only 46 runs and took only three wickets in three Tests against India before being dropped. Nevertheless, McCool started the tour in Bradman's first-choice team, and was selected in the tour opener against Worcestershire and later against the MCC in his role as an all rounder. Bowling for long periods caused McCool to continually tear a callus on his third finger, which he used to impart spin on the ball. As a result, Bradman felt compelled to leave him out of the Test matches, feeling that his finger would not be able to handle the necessarily long bowling spells. This decision was aided by England and Australia's agreement to allow a new ball to be used every 55 overs, instead of the incumbent regulation of permitting a new ball for every 200 runs scored, which usually took longer than 55 overs. This meant the ball was in a shiny state more often, and therefore more conducive to fast and swing bowling, so Bradman relied heavily on his pacemen. For the rest of his career, McCool was troubled by the skin rubbing off his spinning finger. McCool was thus one of two players along with Ron Hamence who did not play a Test during the season. Along with Doug Ring, Hamence and McCool called themselves \\"ground staff\\" because of the paucity of their on-field duties in the major matches, and they often sang ironic songs about their status.Donald Bradman referred to these players as the \\"Groundbowlers\\" in an appreciation of McCool for the 1959 testimonial year granted by Somerset. The cricket writer Alan Gibson, who knew McCool well in his later cricket career at Somerset, said the omission \\"distressed him greatly at the time, though he could be philosophical enough about it later\\". McCool took 57 first-class wickets at 17.82; he was the fifth most prolific wicket-taker and had the fourth best average among Australia's seven frontline bowlers. As England agreed to have a new ball available after every 55 overs, fast bowling dominated in the Tests, so McCool was used heavily in the tour matches to allow the leading pacemen to conserve their energy in preparation for the Tests. Outside the Tests, McCool had the fourth heaviest workload among the regular bowlers, although overall he bowled the least overs due to his injured finger. McCool had the worst economy rate among the regular bowlers, but he took his wickets at a faster rate; his strike rate was second only to paceman Ray Lindwall. Although McCool also played as a frontline batsman during his career, with a first-class average of 32.85 and 18 centuries, his batting performances during the tour were far below his usual standards, garnering only 306 runs at 20.40 with three half-centuries. His highest score was 76 against Gloucestershire, although he added two more fifties and a century against Scotland in the three non-first-class fixtures. During the tour, McCool usually batted from Nos. 5 to 8.N- A specialist at first slip,Fingleton, p. 84. McCool remained prominent with his fielding, taking 20 catches in 17 matches.  Notes Statistical note= n-[1] This statement can be verified by consulting all of the scorecards for the matches, as listed here. = General notes =References  * * Category:The Invincibles (cricket) ","title":"Colin McCool with the Australian cricket team in England in 1948"},{"id":"20824685","text":"Ron Hamence was a member of Donald Bradman's famous Australian cricket team of 1948, which toured England and was undefeated in its 34 matches. As a result of this unprecedented feat by a Test side touring England, the team earned the nickname The Invincibles. A right-handed middle-order batsman, Hamence was not instrumental in the team's success. Regarded as the last batsman to be chosen for the team, his selection was the subject of controversy because many batsmen who had scored more runs in the preceding Australian season had been overlooked. Hamence and Colin McCool were the only squad members who did not play a Test on tour. Hamence was used in non-Test tour matches so that the leading batsmen could conserve energy for the Tests, as play was scheduled for six days a week. Along with Doug Ring, Hamence and McCool called themselves \\"ground staff\\" because of their scant playing duties in the major matches, and they often created and sang ironic songs about their lack of opportunities. Bradman was reluctant to risk the team's unbeaten record and as a result, Hamence did not receive many opportunities to bat high in the order, something that was the subject of criticism. Hamence scored 582 runs at a batting average of 32.33, with a top-score of 99. He was the only frontline Australian batsman not to score a century. The remaining eight frontline batsmen each scored at least 973 runs and all averaged no less than 47.30. Hamence also occasionally opened the bowling in the tour matches with his gentle medium pace, allowing the team's leading bowlers to recuperate between Tests.  Background  During the preceding 1947-48 season in Australia, Hamence was dropped from the national team. He had played sporadically in the Test team, being selected in three of the ten matches in the previous two seasons. In those three Tests he scored a total of 81 runs at an average of 27.00. Returning to domestic cricket following his omission, Hamence scored 85 and 66 against Queensland, a performance which kept him in the running for a place in the national team. His selection for the 1948 tour of England under Bradman was the subject of considerable controversy, as many other batsmen were overlooked despite being more productive during the Australian summer. For his part, Bradman described his middle-order‚ÄîHamence among them‚Äîas \\"an array of batsmen who could scarcely fail\\".Bradman, p. 153. From the start, Hamence was on the outer with regards to selection in the Tests.Perry (2008), p. 6. He was not selected for any of the Tests during the English campaign, but in a 2008 interview, emphasised that he felt no resentment over his omission. Hamence was a popular member of the touring party and his cheerful nature and splendid tenor voice added to the good spirits of the team.Perry (2008), p. 323. His roommate during the tour was the seamer Ernie Toshack.Perry (2008), p. 10. Early tour  Australia traditionally fielded its first-choice team in the tour opener, which was customarily against Worcestershire. Being a fringe member of the squad and having made only sporadic Test appearances in previous seasons, Hamence was not selected. Australia promptly crushed the hosts by an innings. Hamence made his debut on English soil in the second tour match against Leicestershire. Batting at No. 6, he came in at 4/344This notation means that four wickets were lost while 344 runs were scored. and made only seven. His dismissal triggered a collapse of 5/38 as Australia were bowled out for 448 before winning by an innings. The next match against Yorkshire, on a damp pitch that suited slower bowling, was the closest Australia came to defeat on the tour.Fingleton, pp. 53-55. Batting at No. 4, Hamence made 12 in the first innings as Australia replied to Yorkshire's 71 with 101. He batted slowly, coming in at 2/24 before departing at 7/74. After Australia dismissed the hosts for 89 in their second innings, Australia collapsed to 3/13 in pursuit of 60 for victory. Hamence came in and scored one before he was run out after being slow to set off for a quick single; Australia collapsed to 6/31. To make matters worse, Sam Loxton was injured and could not bat, so Australia effectively had only three wickets in hand and faced their first loss to an English county since 1912.Fingleton, p. 55. However, Australia scraped home by four wickets after a counterattack by Neil Harvey and Don Tallon, aided by a dropped catch and missed stumping.Fingleton, p. 56. Hamence was rested as the Australians travelled to London to defeat Surrey at The Oval by an innings. He returned for the next match against Cambridge University. Elevated to No. 3 by stand-in captain Lindsay Hassett, Hamence came in at 1/64 and put on a partnership of 176 with Bill Brown, ending with 92 as Australia piled on 4/414 and won by an innings. Hamence scored mainly from the back foot,Perry (2008), p. 56. and Jack Fingleton opined \\"a nice innings it was, too, in its neat strokemaking\\".Fingleton, p. 64. Hamence also bowled for the first time on tour, sending down three overs for seven runs in the second innings without taking a wicket. In the following match, Australia crushed Essex by an innings and 451 runs, their largest winning margin for the summer. On the first day, Australia set a world record by scoring 721, the most first- class runs added in one day.Fingleton, pp. 65-67. Halfway through the day, at 2/364, all rounder Keith Miller came to the crease. A cavalier and carefree character, Miller resented Bradman's ruthless attitude towards annihilating the opposition and often refused to try when Australia were in an unassailable position. He deliberately let the ball hit the stumps and was out for a golden duck.Fingleton, p. 67.Perry (2005), p. 227. Hamence came in and struck 46, adding 146 runs for the fifth wicket with Sam Loxton. The partnership took only an hour,Fingleton, p. 65. and Australia went on to win by an innings. Miller later said that one of his reasons for gifting his wicket was to protest the lack of opportunities given to Hamence and other fringe batsmen. Batting at No. 5 in the next match against Oxford University, Hamence made only three as Australia made 431 and proceeded to another innings victory. The next match was against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord's. The MCC fielded seven players who would represent England in the Tests,N- and were basically a full strength Test team, while Australia fielded their first- choice team. It was a chance to gain a psychological advantage. Given Hamence's early struggles in the English conditions, which saw him make only 161 runs at 26.83 in his first six innings, while all of Australia's first- choice top six had made centuries,N- he was not selected; Australia amassed 552 and won by an innings. Recalled for the next match, against Lancashire at Old Trafford in Manchester, Hamence scored two while batting at No. 7 in the first innings and an unbeaten 49 at No. 6 in the second, putting on an unbeaten century partnership with Harvey as the match ended in a draw after the entire first day's play was lost to rain. His second innings was praised for the aesthetic quality.Perry (2008), p. 82. It was the first match on tour that Australia had failed to win. Hamence was rested for the following match against Nottinghamshire, which was again drawn, before returning against Hampshire. He made five as Australia were dismissed for 117 in reply to the home side's 195, the first time the tourists had conceded a first innings lead during the season. He did not get another chance with the bat as Australia recovered to win by eight wickets. Hamence had one last chance to make his case for Test selection in the match against Sussex at Hove, the last county fixture before the First Test at Trent Bridge. He came to the crease at 4/453 and made 34 in a stand of 96 with Harvey. His dismissal and Harvey reaching his 100 prompted Australia to declare at 5/549. Bradman said that Hamence was \\"the unlucky player of the match\\" and that he was standing on the balcony ready to declare when Hamence fell on the last ball of the over.Bradman, p. 175. Australia went on to complete an innings victory. In the second innings, Hamence opened the bowling with Ray Lindwall. He took an early wicket before ending the innings by claiming the last man to fall, a stumping by Ron Saggers standing up to the stumps.  Test omission  Since World War II, the first five positions in Australia's Test batting order had regularly consisted of Arthur Morris, Sid Barnes, Bradman, Hassett and Miller, while the sixth position saw many occupants.Perry (2005), pp. 216-218. All of the first five were selected for the matches against Worcestershire and the MCC, and retained their positions for the First Test. This left one position for the remaining batsmen in the squad. Up to this point, Brown had scored 800 runs on tour at an average of 72.72, with four centuries, and was on his third tour of England.Perry (2000), pp. 172-177. Brown had played in the first-choice team in the matches against Worcestershire and the MCC. Harvey had accumulated 296 runs at 42.29, all rounder Loxton had 310 runs at 51.66, but was injured, while Hamence had made only 251 runs at 27.88 and was the only one of the four to not have scored a century. Hamence was overlooked while Brown gained selection in the First Test at Trent Bridge, batting out of position in the middle-order while Barnes and Morris were preferred as the first-choice opening pair, whereas Harvey was dropped despite making a century in Australia's most recent Test against India.Perry (2002), p. 100. This was the exact situation that had unfolded in the Worcestershire and MCC matches where Australia fielded their first-choice team; Brown batted in the middle order. Bradman explained the decision in his memoirs: \\"Hamence was not in good enough form and Harvey scarcely ready\\".Bradman, p. 176. During the opening stages of the tour, Bradman spent little time talking to Hamence at practice sessions, leading analysts to conclude that the Australian skipper viewed Hamence as being highly unlikely to play in the Tests.Perry (2008), p. 25. Australia went on to defeat England by eight wickets, although Brown struggled and made only 17. Between Tests, Hamence earned selection for the match against Northamptonshire, batting at No. 4 and scoring 34; he partnered acting captain Hassett in a stand of 104 for the third wicket. He took 1/11 in the second innings as Australia won by an innings. In the second match before the Second Test, which was against Yorkshire, Hamence made 48 and six not out, and took a total of 1/17 as the game ended in a draw. He batted slowly and cautiously; Bradman gave him few opportunities, so he had to make the most of them.Fingleton, p. 195. The first innings 48 was a determined performance on a sticky wicket that helped Australia to 249;Perry (2008), p. 122. Bradman felt that Hamence's grit was a notable factor in Australia managing to pass 200.Bradman, p. 182. Harvey made 49 and 56 while Brown made 19 and 113 as an opener. This was enough for Brown to retain his middle-order position for the Second Test at Lord's, where Australia fielded an unchanged team. Australia went on to a crushing win by 409 runs but Brown made only 24 and 32. The next match was against Surrey and started the day after the Second Test. As the Test players were tired, Bradman gave them a lighter workload and assigned Hamence and Loxton to open the bowling. Both took two wickets and Hamence snared opposing captain Laurie Fishlock and Eric Bedser to end with 2/24. Brown injured a finger while fielding, so he was not able to bat in Australia's first innings. Hamence was thus elevated to open the batting. Hamence made a duck, but Australia nevertheless took a 168-run lead. Hamence opened the bowling for the second time, although he was unable to take a wicket and ended with 0/30. In the second innings, Harvey volunteered to play as a makeshift opener alongside Loxton and they chased down the 122 runs for victory in less than an hour to complete a 10-wicket win. For the following match against Gloucestershire before the Third Test, Brown and Hamence did not play. Harvey made 95 and Loxton ended on 159 not out as Australia reached 7/774 declared, its highest of the tour, underpinning an innings victory. As a result of the performance, Loxton seized Brown's middle-order position for the Third Test at Old Trafford.Perry (2000), p. 176. During the drawn Third Test, opening batsman Sid Barnes was injured. This opened up a vacancy for the Fourth Test. Hamence made 30 as Australia defeated Middlesex by ten wickets in their only county match before the Fourth Test at Headingley. Hamence was overlooked for the vacancy as Harvey was called in. Australia scored 3/404 to set a world record for the highest successful Test run chase; Harvey scored a century. Immediately after the Test, Hamence made 21 at No. 6 as Australia amassed 456 and defeated Derbyshire by an innings. In the next match against Glamorgan, Hamence was yet to bat when rain ended the match at 3/215 in Australia's first innings. He was rested as Australia defeated Warwickshire by nine wickets. Hamence was recalled as Australia faced and drew with Lancashire for the second time on the tour. He made 14 in the first innings and was unbeaten on 10 in the second when Australia declared, having batted at No. 5 both times. In the last match before the Fifth Test, a non-first-class fixture against Durham, Hamence scored 24 batting at No. 6 in Australia's 282. The match was a rain-affected draw that did not reach the second innings. Hamence was overlooked for the Fifth Test, as Australia won by an innings to seal the series 4-0; the drawn Third Test was Australia's only non-victory.  Later tour matches  Seven matches remained on Bradman's quest to go through a tour of England without defeat. Australia batted first against Kent and Hamence made 38. Hamence was the ninth man to fall as partners ran out and Australia lost their last seven wickets for 89 to end at 361. Despite this, they completed an innings victory. In the next match against the Gentlemen of England, Hamence batted at No. 7 and only had a limited opportunity to contribute, coming in at 5/532 and scoring 24 before Bradman declared at 5/610 when Hassett reached 200. Hamence bowled in both innings for a total of 1/41 as Australia won by an innings. In the next match against Somerset, Hamence put on 195 for the fifth wicket with Ian Johnson to take Australia to 4/501 with his score on 99. The other batsmen had all made centuries, and the Australian players were keen to see Hamence do the same. With his score on 99, the rest of the team left their card games in readiness to applaud his impending milestone. However, Hamence hit two balls from the middle of the bat, only to see them travel directly to the fielder, yielding no runs. Anxious to reach his century, Hamence then charged down the pitch and was then stumped for 99, his highest score for the season.Perry (2008), p. 253. According to Bradman, Hamence \\"fell to what everyone said was the best ball all day\\".Bradman, p. 216. Nevertheless, Australia won by an innings and 374 runs. In the following match against the South of England, Hamence made seven as Australia declared at 7/522. The match was washed out; Hamence bowled three overs without success in the hosts' only innings. Australia's biggest challenge in the post-Test tour matches was the fixture against Leveson- Gower's XI. During the last tour in 1938, this team was effectively a full- strength England outfit, but this time Bradman insisted that only six players currently in England's Test team be allowed to play for the hosts.Fingleton, pp. 207-209. Bradman then fielded a full-strength team,Perry (2005), pp. 253-254. so Hamence was left out. Australia led by 312 on the first innings and were well in control, but the match ended in a draw after multiple rain delays. The tour ended with two non-first-class matches against Scotland. Hamence batted once in each match, scoring six and 15 as Australia ended the tour with two innings victories.  Role  alt=Hamence started with three scores below 20 before making 92 and a score in the 40s. After consecutive single figure scores, he makes four scores between 30 and 50 in five innings. eh then made six innings in a row below 30, before scoring 99 near the end of the sequence. During the tour, Hamence played 19 first-class matches and scored 582 runs at an average of 32.33. An occasional bowler who delivered 56.3 overs of medium pace during the tour, he took seven wickets at 21.42 and completed nine catches. He was the most successful of the specialist batsmen with the ball, occasionally opening the bowling in the tour matches, such as in both innings of the second match against Surrey and the second innings of the second match against Yorkshire. This allowed Bradman to rest his first- choice bowlers to keep them fresh for the Tests. Hamence's primary role was to allow the leading batsmen an opportunity to conserve energy for the Tests; the Australians generally had six days of play scheduled every week. In most of the matches, Hamence batted in the middle order at Nos. 5, 6 and 7.N- Along with Loxton, he was given 22 first-class opportunities with the bat, whereas the other eight frontline batsmen had at least 26 innings. Loxton scored 973 runs, while the others all scored more than 1,000. All of the batsmen other than Loxton averaged at least 47.30. and as Australia won many of their matches by an innings or by eight or more wickets, he seldom batted in the second innings. On four occasions, he was unbeaten when Australia either declared, reached their target or time ran out. Teammate Sid Barnes criticised the omission of Hamence from much meaningful cricket on the tour. Referring to the match against the Gentlemen of England, Barnes criticised the fact that Bradman, Hassett and himself all made centuries, while Hamence was only given a short innings in the lower order and was not out on 24 when Australia declared. As the tourists were already in a strong position, Barnes reasoned that Hamence \\"could have been sent in [at] first wicket down, where he batted with his interstate team ... Despite this, Hassett still went in before Hamence in the next game, against Somerset ... Hamence batted No. 6... but he should have been sent in No. 3.\\"Barnes, p. 180. \\"No. 6\\" and \\"No. 3\\" refer to positions in the batting order. The No. 3 batsman bats after the first wicket in the innings has fallen, i.e. third in order after the two opening batsmen. The No. 6 batsman will bat after the fourth wicket has fallen. Barnes reported that Hamence, along with the other frequent omissions Colin McCool and Doug Ring, termed themselves the \\"ground staff\\". He added: \\"In the dressing room during county games they would break out into ironic song about the few chances they got.\\" Loxton reported that these songs included the \\"odd risque limerick\\".Perry (2008), p. 57. Bradman did later state that \\"because of the strong array of batsman ahead of him, [Hamence] seldom had an opportunity to make big scores\\" but \\"was an extremely useful reserve who could have been played in the Tests with confidence\\". Following the 1948 tour, Bradman described Hamence as \\"a fine batsman of the strictly orthodox type. Very sound and reliable with his game based on driving\\" and a \\"very safe fieldsman\\".Bradman, p. 226. Bradman added that Hamence had few opportunities because of Australia's batting strength but \\"always batted well and often at a critical moment made valuable runs\\".Bradman, p. 230. Bradman said that Hamence \\"could have been played in the Tests with confidence\\" and praised his contributions to team morale.Bradman, p. 231. Fingleton said \\"there was criticism of his selection in this side, but had the war not intervened he undoubtedly would have made a[n] [Ashes] trip before\\".Fingleton, p. 208.

Today Germany is one nation, but until 1914, Germany and Central Europe was ruled over by a large number of independent states. Until World War I, the term German could have referred to peoples from areas of what is today the states Germany, Poland, Belgium, Luxembourg, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Austria, and even Croatia, and the Netherlands. From 1815 to 1860 this number was 35 separate German sovereign states (including Prussia and Austria) plus another 4 free cities, who together formed the German Confederation. Prior to 1789 there were over 300 independent sovereign states and thousands of other bishoprics, lordships, and free cities that made up the Holy Roman Empire.A Zamoyski, Rites of Peace, HarperCollins, London 2007  Why use Germans?  When the term German Prince or Princess is used, it is referring to a member of one of the many ruling sovereign houses of the Central Europe region. They were often used as suitable marriage candidates, simply due to the fact there were so many of them. Also, as all of the European royalty were related, it helped to use a German prince/princess to keep the marriage \\"in the family\\", so to speak, or sometimes the opposite: to broaden the gene pool. The only other area of Europe that was close to be being ruled over by so many different sovereign states was Italy which after 1815 was made up of at least 11 different states,F.

He overthrew Hubert Maga, whose presidency faced extreme economic stagnation and a host of other problems. Background The West African colony of French Dahomey, the present-day nation of Benin, was largely ignored by the French during its colonial era in French West Africa.. Dahomey had a weak economy, propelled by the lack of known natural resources. The last time the colony had a favorable trade balance was in 1924. Its main export was intellectuals, and was known as the Latin Quarter of Africa due to its rich cultural landscape.. On August 1, 1960, Dahomey gained its independence and prominent politician Hubert Maga was chosen as its first president.. At the time, Dahomey was also facing a major economic recession. Now that Dahomey was independent, France no longer offered subsidies. Maga helped counter this by investing in the infrastructure and encouraging civil servants to take Dahomey as their residence. Still, Dahomey's GDP grew by 1.4 percent annually from 1957‚Äì1965, making Dahomey's economy one of the weakest in Africa.. The economic stagnation triggered intense regionalistic attitudes in Dahomey.. Parties epitomising the idea began with the 1951 French National Assembly elections. Capitalising on growing cynicism for the domination of southern Dahomey in the French colony's politics, Maga allied himself with the northern tribes. Sourou-Migan Apithy, whom academic Samuel Decalo described as \\"the grandfather of Dahomeyan politics,\\" kept the second seat, which he had first won in 1945. Apithy represented the people living in southeast Benin, while a third figure, Justin Ahomad√©gb√©-Tom√™tin, represented the southwest. Attempts to counteract regionalism failed, as did the establishment of a one-party state.. Coalitions between Maga, Apithy, and Ahomad√©gb√©-Tom√™tin were similarly unsuccessful, as each sought absolute power.. In early 1961, the president began applying repressive measures on the opposition press and anyone suspected of trouble- making, thus practically eliminated Ahomad√©gb√©-Tom√™tin's voice in the country.. By April, most Dahomeyan Democratic Union (UDD) members had expressed interest in joining the Dahomeyan Unity Party, and Maga not only supported this but encouraged it. A notable exception was Ahomad√©gb√©-Tom√™tin himself. The choice was soon made for him; the entire UDD was dissolved by Maga on April 11.. Maga then attempted to design a four-year growth plan, to begin on January 1, 1962, that contained many ambitious acts.. It was designed to increase yield in agriculture and was financed by French capital.. Part of the plan was to cut all wages by ten percent.. Young Dahomeyans would contribute \\"human investment\\", or forced labor on the fields. Maga decided to reshuffle the cabinet in February 1962. He added the planning and development duties to Apithy's office to quench his apparently unquenchable thirst for power.. Nonetheless, he accused Maga of being a dictator, and the series of demonstrations the vice president coordinated would ultimately depose his boss. They were not sparked by Maga himself, but rather the murder of David Dessou.. Dessou riots January 1962 saw the poisoning of Dessou, an official of the Sakete sub-prefecture.. The deputy from his constituency, named Christophe Bokhiri, was accused of the crime and duly arrested. He was released after his fellow deputies in the National Assembly requested to suspend proceedings against him under the parliamentary immunity clauses of the Dahomey Constitution,. specifically Article 37. Maga, meanwhile, was away in Paris during all of this. The people of Dahomey, on the other hand, were outraged on the release of Bokhiri. They incited racial clashes in the summer of 1963, as the murderer and the victim were of different tribes. Demonstrations were organized in Porto Novo on October 21 and soon spread to Cotonou. They remained somewhat orderly before the trade unionists were involved. While still led by Maga, the trade unionists were still upset by the wage cut and used the case to further their interests. In addition, they criticized what they called Maga's \\"squander-mania\\", such as the construction of a presidential palace. Most of the demonstrations were peaceful, although several demonstrators destroyed a sign containing Maga's name on a hospital.. Six trade unionists were arrested on the second day of demonstrations, causing the unions to call a general strike.. By the end of the second day, protesters forced the National Assembly to put Bokhiri back in jail, which simultaneously enforced a curfew. In light of recent events, Maga cancelled his trip to the United States and returned to Dahomey immediately. Appealing for peace, he convened a special National Assembly session. The protesters and trade unionists were indifferent to these actions; when Maga agreed with their demands and replaced his government with a provisional one in which Apithy and Ahomad√©gb√©-Tom√™tin had equal standing, they organized themselves to \\"boo\\" this new order. Armed northerners came down to Cotonou to support Maga and clashed with dissenters, killing two. The protesters, however, would not return to their jobs until Maga no longer held his.. Coup On October 28 Chief of Staff of the 800-man Dahomeyan Army Christophe Soglo took control of the country to prevent a civil war. He dismissed the cabinet, dissolved the Assembly, suspended the constitution and banned any type of demonstrations. After having Maga sign his resignation the same day he gave Maga, Apithy, and Ahomad√©gb√©-Tom√™tin the powers of the Ministry of State. Southern Dahomey later created a statue in honor of this day in the national history.. The strikes ended the next day. The reasons for the overthrow of Maga was the \\"luxurious life style of the rulers, abusive increase in the number of ministerial posts, unsatisfied social demands, unkept promises, the rise of the cost of living, and antidemocratic measures that martyrized the people and reduced them to nothing.\\". Aftermath The provisional government dissolved the PDU and replaced it by a Dahomeyan Democratic Party (PDD). It announced a referendum on the status of the constitution was to be held on December 15,. although it was not held until 5 January 1964. At the same time, a committee was established to investigate perceived wrongdoings by the Maga administration. In late November, it began prosecuting members of the cabinet, such as the Minister of National Economy and the Finance Minister for misusing public funds. Maga was soon to find himself in jail too. Soglo and Maga were friends. However, in early December, Soglo discovered a plot to have him assassinated and blamed Maga, who resigned his post on December 4.. A few days after the discovery, he was placed under house arrest along with four former cabinet members. At an official inquiry this conspiracy charge was dropped, but Maga was still guilty of corruption. Following a March 1964 retrial, Maga was let out of prison. and went into exile in Paris..

She is known for her work in the areas of cognitive and language development, specializing in the effect of language on thought, the development of a theory of mind, and causal learning. Her writing on psychology and cognitive science has appeared in Science, Scientific American,Gopnik, Alison, \\"Making AI More Human: Artificial intelligence has staged a revival by starting to incorporate what we know about how children learn\\", Scientific American, vol. 316, no. 6 (June 2017), pp. 60‚Äì65. The Times Literary Supplement, The New York Review of Books, The New York Times, New Scientist, Slate and others. Her body of work also includes four books and over 100 journal articles. She has frequently appeared on TV and radio including The Charlie Rose Show and The Colbert Report. Slate writes of Gopnik, \\"One of the most prominent researchers in the field, Gopnik is also one of the finest writers, with a special gift for relating scientific research to the questions that parents and others most want answered. This is where to go if you want to get into the head of a baby.\\" Gopnik is a columnist for The Wall Street Journal, sharing the Mind & Matter column with Robert Sapolsky on alternating Saturdays. Academic career Gopnik received a B.A., majoring in psychology and philosophy, from McGill University in 1975. In 1980, she received a D.Phil. in experimental psychology from Oxford University. She worked at the University of Toronto before joining the faculty at UC Berkeley in 1988. Lecturing at SkeptiCal ‚Äì Berkeley, CA ‚Äì April 21, 2012 ‚Äì \\"The Philosophical Baby: What Children's Minds Tell us about Truth, Love and the Meaning of Life\\" Gopnik has done extensive work with applying Bayesian networks to human learning and has published and presented numerous papers on the topic. Gopnik says of this work, \\"The interesting thing about Bayes nets is that they search out causes rather than mere associations. They give you a single representational structure for dealing both with things that just happen and with interventions‚Äîthings you observe others doing to the world or things you do to the world. This is important because there is something really special about the way we treat and understand human action. We give it a special status in terms of our causal inferences. We think of human actions as things that you do that are designed to change things in the world as opposed to other events that just take place.\\" Judea Pearl, developer of Bayesian networks, says Gopnik was one of the first psychologists to note that the mathematical models also resemble how children learn. Gopnik's work at Berkeley's Child Study Center seeks to develop mathematical models of how children learn. These models could be used to develop better algorithms for artificial intelligence. In April, 2013, Gopnik was inducted into The American Academy of Arts and Sciences. She is, as of 2014, a Fellow of the Cognitive Science Society. Notable publications Gopnik is an authority on the philosophy of mind and a preeminent developmental psychologist. Gopnik is known for advocating the \\"theory theory\\" which postulates that the same mechanisms used by scientists to develop scientific theories are used by children to develop causal models of their environment. The \\"theory theory\\" was explored in \\"Words, Thoughts, and Theories,\\" co-authored with Andrew N. Meltzoff. Gopnik co-authored with Andrew N. Meltzoff and Patricia K. Kuhl \\"The Scientist in the Crib: What Early Learning Tells Us About the Mind.\\" The book posits that the cognitive development of children in early life is made possible by three factors: innate knowledge, advanced learning ability, and the evolved ability of parents to teach their offspring. \\"Causal Learning: Psychology, Philosophy, and Computation,\\" edited with Laura Schulz, explores causal learning and the interdisciplinary work done in furthering the understanding of learning and reasoning. In her book \\"The Philosophical Baby: What Children‚Äôs Minds Tell Us about Truth, Love, and the Meaning of Life,\\" Gopnik explores how infants and young children cognitively develop by using processes similar to those used by scientists, including experimenting on their environment. The book explains how an environment maximized for an infant's cognitive development is one that is safe to explore. The book also explores what babies can tell us about love, imagination and identity, as well as considering the broader philosophical significance of care-giving. \\"The Philosophical Baby\\" has been recognized as a New York Times Extended List Bestseller, a San Francisco Chronicle Bestseller, and an Independent Bookstores Bestseller. It has also received acclaim on the New York Times Editor's Choice list, the San Francisco Chronicle Editors Choice list, and as one of Babble's 50 Best Parenting Books. It has also been recognized as recommended reading by Scientific American. In 2009, Gopnik published a paper in Hume Studies arguing that the historical record regarding the circumstances around David Hume's authoring of A Treatise of Human Nature are wrong. Gopnik argued that Hume had access to the library of the Royal College at La Fl√®che, a Jesuit institution that had been founded by Henri IV. At the time Hume was living nearby and working on the Treatise, La Fl√®che was home to a Jesuit missionary named Charles Fran√ßois Dolu, a learned man who was an expert on different world religions who had visited the French embassy in Siam. In addition, Dolu had met Ippolito Desideri, another Jesuit missionary who had visited Tibet from 1716‚Äì1721. Gopnik argues that because of his exposure to Theravada Buddhism, Dolu may form the source of the Buddhist influence on Hume's Treatise. Gopnik cites a number of letters from Hume that mention his time at La Fl√®che and his meeting with Jesuits from the college. It is from this Buddhist connection through the learning of the Jesuit college that Hume is influenced to deny the ontological reality of the self‚Äîwhich Gopnik links to the Indian Buddhist idea of ≈ö≈´nyatƒÅ (Emptiness). The feature- length documentary film The Singularity by independent filmmaker Doug Wolens (released at the end of 2012), showcasing Gopnik's work in cognitive development as it relates to computer learning, has been acclaimed as \\"a large-scale achievement in its documentation of futurist and counter-futurist ideas\\" and \\"the best documentary on the Singularity to date.\\" Personal life Gopnik is the daughter of linguist Myrna Gopnik. She is the firstborn of six siblings who include Blake Gopnik, the Newsweek art critic, and Adam Gopnik, a writer for The New Yorker. She was formerly married to journalist George Lewinski and has three sons: Alexei, Nicholas, and Andres Gopnik- Lewinski. In 2010, she married computer graphics pioneer Alvy Ray Smith, the co-founder of Pixar.

Like the Tappan, whose territory overlapped, the Rumanchenank were a seasonally migrational people, who farmed (companion planting), hunted, fished, and trapped.

The B-side of the single, \\"Niko Mchumba Ngombe\\", also by Ochs, Dijiba, and Bukasa, was written in Swahili. Both songs were recorded by Ochs with the Pan-African Ngembo Rumba Band. The record was a commercial failure. \\"Bwatue\\" and \\"Niko Mchumba Ngombe\\" have been described as early examples of blending Western popular music with world music, and critics note that they predate Paul Simon's Graceland by more than ten years. Still, one critic says the record \\"should be seen more as a curiosity rather than a serious attempt at exploring a new style\\". One of Ochs' biographers cynically suggests that Ochs recorded the songs in order to deduct the cost of his trip to Africa from his income tax as a business expense. In the early 1990s, the single was reissued in a limited edition of 1000 by Sparkle Records, ostensibly on behalf of the Phil Ochs Fan Club of Canada.

A loose adaptation of Carmilla (1872), it revolves around two teenage orphan girls living in a Catholic convent, who unleash a demonic force and become possessed. Though a Mexican production, the film was shot in English. Internationally, it was released under several alternate titles, including Innocents from Hell and Sisters of Satan. The film has been noted by film scholars for its themes regarding national tradition versus modernity, as well as the tensions between science and religion, and the failures of both. Because of its depiction of nuns in emotionally- heightened, supernatural situations, the film has been associated with the nunsploitation genre. Plot In 1850, Lucy Westenra gives birth to a daughter, Alucarda, in a derelict colonial palace in the woods. Immediately after the child is born, Lucy begs a hunchbacked gypsy to bring Alucarda to a nearby stone-walled convent inhabited by an order of Catholic nuns, as she fears the devil will claim her daughter. As the gypsy flees with the infant, a demonic voice emanates throughout the palace as Lucy dies of complications from childbirth. Fifteen years later, a teenaged Alucarda still resides at the convent. Alucarda swiftly takes an interest in Justine, a new orphan her age who has arrived, and is eager to become her friend. Alucarda quickly refers to Justine as her sister. While playing in a forest, Alucarda and Justine witness a band of gypsies holding a funeral procession. One of the men‚Äîthe hunchback who helped deliver Alucarda‚Äîoffers to sell Alucarda an amulet. Shortly after, the girls stumble upon the abandoned palace, and wander into a crypt. There, Alucarda professes her love for Justine, and the two make a pact that they shall die together. In the crypt, they unwittingly open the grave of Alucarda's mother, and are immediately overcome by a powerful supernatural force that reduces Alucarda to tears. Later, during mass, Justine inexplicably faints. While Alucarda tends to Justine in her room, she goes into a fit and begins wildly reciting the names of demons. The hunchback gypsy appears in the room as Alucarda invokes Satan, and the girls, nude, perform a blood ritual. Meanwhile, while praying, Sister Ang√©lica has a vision of Alucarda and Justine performing a Satanic ritual with the gypsies in the woods and engaging in a mass orgy. During the ritual, one of the priestesses is stricken down by Sister Ang√©lica's invocation of God, and is killed. The next day during school, Alucarda and Justine begin chanting and professing their dedication to Satan, much to the horror of the nuns and their peers. The nuns make several unsuccessful attempts to have the girls repent, one of which ends with Alucarda attempting to seduce Father L√°zaro during confession. L√°zaro and the nuns, horrified by this, engage in a mass flogging of each other as punishment for their failure to save the girls from demonic influence. After, L√°zaro concludes they must perform an exorcism of Justine, who has grown progressively ill. During the exorcism, they bind Justine to a cross and poke at her flesh with instruments, eventually causing her to bleed to death. Dr. Oszek, arriving to examine Justine, walks in on the exorcism and is horrified by what he sees. Deeming the practice archaic and sadistic, Oszek takes Alucarda with him, fearing for her life. Alucarda awakens in Dr. Oszek's home, frightened and confused, and is comforted by his blind daughter, Daniela. Meanwhile, Oszek is summoned back to the convent, where the nuns have found that Justine's corpse has disappeared. Upstairs, Sister Germana is found inexplicably burned alive. When her body reanimates, Father L√°zaro bludgeons and ultimately decapitates her. The event challenges Oszek's science-based beliefs, and he flees back home, fearing for Daniela's safety; upon arriving, he finds Alucarda and Daniela are both gone. Oszek is led to the abandoned crypt by the nuns, who suspect Alucarda might have gone there. Inside, Sister Ang√©lica finds Justine's body lying in a blood-filled coffin. Now a vampire, Justine attacks Sister Ang√©lica, but Ang√©lica manages to stop the attack by praying. Oszek interjects and pours holy water on Justine, driving her into a fit, and she bites Ang√©lica's neck before disintegrating. Followed by Oszek, several monks carry Ang√©lica's body back to the convent, where Alucarda has arrived with Daniela. Using supernatural powers, Alucarda begins destroying the convent and causing various clergy to spontaneously combust in the grotto. Upon witnessing Ang√©lica's corpse, Alucarda is suddenly overcome with sorrow, and goes into a fit of rage at the base of a burning crucifix in the chapel. After she collapses, Alucarda's body disappears into the ground as Father L√°zaro and Oszek look on. CastThemes Some scholars, such as Frances Di Lauro, have noted that Alucarda is undergirded by anti-government and anticlerical sentiments that are manifested in the exaggerated idolatry, representations of clerics as tyrants and persecutors, and overt iconoclasm. Tensions between modernity and tradition are also prominent themes. Film scholar Doyle Green characterizes the film as an \\"apocalyptic collision of modernity and tradition in a perpetual Dark Age.\\" Scholars Ra√∫l Rodr√≠guez- Hern√°ndez and Claudia Schaefer contextualize this clash (and the film's representation of it) within Mexico's national history, exemplifying \\"literary and cinematic representations of persistent clashes between tradition and modernity, myth and reason. The added dimension of visibly transgressive actions taken by two young women against teachings, structure, and moral guiding principles of the church speaks directly to a post-1968 generation that celebrates the body but has lost faith in the society's master narratives.\\" Aesthetically, Rodr√≠guez-Hern√°ndez and Schaefer note visual references to Francisco Goya's Los caprichos, specifically during the sequence in which Alucarda and Justine engage in the blood ritual with the hunchbacked gypsy. Green also interprets Alucarda as being preoccupied with themes of mental illness and the handling of it within the Catholic Church. Green states that, in the film, \\"the convent becomes a psychiatric domain without psychiatry,\\" a theme also explored significantly in Ken Russell's The Devils (1973). Because of these shared depictions of Catholic clergy‚Äîspecifically nuns‚Äîin the context of hysteria, Green notes that both films became associated with the nunsploitation genre. The tension between science and religious dogma has been noted as another theme, specifically in the final act, during which the logically-minded Dr. Oszek‚Äîa man of science‚Äîis faced with supernatural occurrences he cannot rationalize. Alucarda is also associated with the vampire movie genre, although it is not a traditional vampire movie. Many critics have noted its similarities to Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu's early vampire novella Carmilla, especially the romantic relationship between the main female characters. According to director L√≥pez Moctezuma, \\"the film draws on the vampire tradition, and in a way the protagonist is a female vampire ‚Ä¶ but not in the sense of a blood drinker.\\" Release Alucarda opened at the Paris International Festival of Fantastic Film in March 1977. The film was released under the title Sisters of Satan in the United States in 1978, and subsequently released on video under various titles including Sisters of Satan, Innocents from Hell, and Mark of the Devil 3. =Critical response= Columnist Michael Weldon of the Psychotronic Video Guide wrote that the film was \\"The strongest, most imaginative, and visual witch movie since Ken Russell's The Devils.\\" David Wilt of the University of Maryland's Mexican Film Resource Page notes that the film is \\"visually, a rather stylish and interesting picture,\\" comparing it to the work of Alejandro Jodorowsky. Mexican filmmaker Guillermo del Toro has also expressed his appreciation for the film and other works from director Juan L√≥pez Moctezuma. =Home media= Mondo Macabro released a special edition DVD edition of Alucarda in 2002.

Through that series of changes the thread of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith traces its history in the region from the earliest moments of the B√°bism religion, accepted by Bah√° º√≠s as a predecessor religion, in that one of its most prominent figures, Tahirih, was an Azerbaijani. Followers of the religion formed communities in Nakhichevan before 1850. By the early 20th century the community, now centered in Baku, numbered perhaps 2000 individuals and several Bah√° º√≠ Local Spiritual Assemblies and had facilitated the favorable attention of local and regional, and international leaders of thought as well as long- standing leading figures in the religion. However under Soviet rule the Bah√° º√≠ community was almost ended though it was quickly reactivated as more than 30 years later when perestroyka loosened controls on religions. The community quickly rallied and re-elected its own National Spiritual Assembly in 1992. The modern Bah√° º√≠ population of Azerbaijan, centered in Baku, may have regained its peak from the oppression of the Soviet period of about 2000 people, today with more than 80% converts, although the community in Nakhichevan, where it all began, is still seriously harassed and oppressed. The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated some 1638 Bah√° º√≠s in 2005.

The region of Azerbaijan remains divided between an independent state including the semi-autonomous state of Nakhchivan, and of northern-western provinces of Iran. = Earliest phase = In the beginning of the earliest phase, among the most notable fact is a woman of Azerbaijani background would play a central role in this history of Babism - she would be later named Tahirih though her story would be in the context of Iran. She was among the Letters of the Living of the B√°b. A group of members of the B√°b√≠ religion formed in Nakhichevan and spread before 1850 largely of Persian expatriates who were fleeing persecution in Persia. The Russian army, under the command of General Vasili Bebutov, attacked the new community which formed so quickly and is thought to have included more than ten thousand people. =Growth during the B√°b√≠ period= From 1850 on small communities established themselves in Ordubad, Baku, Balakhani, Ganja, Barda, Goychay, Salyan, Khilli (present Neftchala), Shaki, Shamakhy. Soon the community of Baku counted the largest number of believers in the region and in 1860 obtained official recognition from the authorities. The community recognized the newly announced position of Bah√° ºu'll√°h. Soon there was more public awareness and some favor from leaders of the broader community and at the same time the Bah√° º√≠ community of Baku broadened its communication with other Bah√° º√≠ communities in Russia, Turkey and Ashkhabad and did much work printing materials in Turkish. The most publicly recognized member of the community approaching 1900 was Musa Nagiyev, one of Azerbaijan's richest citizens of the times though there were many public figures before and after who seem to have admired the religion or even been members of it. =Maximum extent of the early community= Circa 1902 relations with the government were good but with the general population \\"‚Ä¶we have no satisfactory tranquility on account of the people.\\" and the Baku assembly was now also in contact with Bah√° º√≠ communities in the United States. Bah√° º√≠ Local Spiritual Assemblies were elected in Balakhani, Baku, Ganja, Barda, and Salyan. Charles Mason Remey traveled there in 1908 and describes the community briefly. The community may have peaked at about 2000 people, second only to that of Ashqabad - see Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Turkmenistan. The Nakhjavani family played many and major roles in the Bah√° º√≠ Faith before and in the coming decades. The father of the family, Mirza  ªAli-Akbar Nakhjavani, translated communications to and from Leo Tolstoy c. 1890s and assisted  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° in his travels to the United States in 1911‚Äì12. The children of Ali-Akbar included Jalal, born in 1917, and Ali in 1919. After his death c. 1920‚Äì1, the family was invited to take up residence in Haifa and Ali-Akbar's wife and sister worked as attendants in the house of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° after his death, assisting the many pilgrims who came there. Both children grew up eventually attending Beirut University and moved to a variety of places to help spread the religion. Both initially moved back to Iran and then Africa. Jalal went to Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania and then years later in Hamburg West Germany and helping to found the assembly of Neumuenster and then finally in Selkirk Canada where he soon died, though he traveled and spoke to groups until his last days. Ali helped spread of the religion across from Uganda through central Africa to Cameroon and in 1963 would be elected to the Universal House of Justice and was re-elected and served 40 years before retiring. =First oppression= A Baha'i \\"character building\\" class in Baku, 1926 shows a group of Baha'i children receiving instructions in the principles of character training. From 1922 Soviet officials launched their initial campaigns against the Bah√° º√≠s including deportation of Bah√° º√≠ Iranian citizens to Iran and the exile of others to Siberia, publications and schools were banned, as well as collective meetings. Regardless, a new wave of national organization was achieved with the election of the regional National Assembly of the Bah√° º√≠s of the Caucasus and Turkistan in 1925. However, in 1928 orders were dispersed among the Bah√° º√≠ communities suspending all meetings, and suppressing all local and national administration. Prohibitions were placed on the raising of funds, and Bah√° º√≠ youth and children's clubs were ordered closed. By about 1937 only the assembly of Baku and Ashgabat were still functioning though the membership of the Baku assembly had been elected three times in two years because the first two set of members were arrested en masse and exiled to Siberia. The third set was mostly women. In 1937, with the NKVD (Soviet secret police) and the policy of religious oppression the Soviets began a sweep against the Bah√° º√≠s on October 13 and in a few days all the members of the spiritual assembly of Baku and dozens of others were arrested. The chairman was executed. It wasn't until 1956 when the Spiritual Assembly of Baku started to function again after a fashion but by the end of 1963 was ranked as only a community, not an assembly. The regional National Assembly of the Caucasus and Turkistan was disbanded. =Second oppression= In November 1982 there were systematic sweeping arrests by the KGB including of S.D. Asadova, I.F. Gasimov, and I.G. Ayyubov who were interrogated for 7 hours continuously and had to write 10-page explanations. They were prohibited from telling anybody about their arrest and meetings of the community were ended. From Perestroyka Since its inception the religion has had involvement in socio-economic development beginning by giving greater freedom to women, promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern, and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics. The religion entered a new phase of activity around the world when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Bah√° º√≠s were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Bah√° º√≠ teachings, in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bah√° º√≠ socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. However, in the Soviet Block Bah√° º√≠s had almost disappeared. As Perestroyka approached, the Bah√° º√≠s began to organize and get in contact with each other. From 1988 the Bah√° º√≠s in Moscow and Ashqabad and then in Baku became active (see also Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Ukraine.) With more than 20 Bah√° º√≠s in Baku at that time only three went to the State Department of Religion of Azerbaijan, for fear of arrests, in order to announce their intention to re- establish the Spiritual Assembly of the Bah√° º√≠s of Baku. By the end of 1990, after 50 almost years, the election for the Spiritual Assembly of the Bah√° º√≠s of Baku was held, followed by Gandja and Barda. In 1991 the Spiritual Assemblies were re-elected in Salyan and Balakhani. In 1992 the Parliament of Azerbaijan adopted the law of religious liberty and Bah√° º√≠s gained an opportunity to officially register communities and the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bah√° º√≠s of Azerbaijan was elected, which had been effectively disbanded since 1938. In 1993 the Governing Board of the Ministry of Justice of the Azerbaijan Republic gave official permission for the functioning of the Bah√° º√≠ Community of Baku. The Bah√° º√≠s of Baku are seeking the return of property confiscated during the Soviet era‚Äîespecially a house that served as the Bah√° º√≠ Center. The Bah√° º√≠ population of Azerbaijan, centered in Baku, may have regained its peak from the oppression of the Soviet period of about 2000 people, with more than 80% converts. In 2005 the Association of Religion Data Archives (relying in part on the World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated somewhat fewer Bah√° º√≠s at about 1500. Influence from Turk, rather than Russian or Iranian, Bah√° º√≠s seems to be playing a leading role among conversions of Azerbaijans, especially the Lezgins. However, the small Bah√° º√≠ Nakhichevan community is harassed by the authorities and they lack freedom of association. A leading Bah√° º√≠ was arrested in 2004. Officials claimed he was not imprisoned for his religious beliefs though officials extracted a verbal promise from him not to speak further of his religion to anyone. The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated some 1638 Bah√° º√≠s in 2005.

It was the fifth event under the Bound for Glory chronology, and was the premiere event for TNA in 2009. Bound for Glory featured a supercard, a scheduling of more than one main event. Nine matches took place at the show. The headlining match showcased A.J. Styles defeating Sting to retain his TNA World Heavyweight Championship in a match voted by the fans as the Match of the Year. Other matches high up on the card saw Kurt Angle defeat Matt Morgan, Abyss defeat Mick Foley in a Monster's Ball match, and Bobby Lashley defeat Samoa Joe in a Submission match. In October 2017, with the launch of the Global Wrestling Network, the event became available to stream on demand. ProductionBackground= The fifth installment of the Bound for Glory chronology was first announced in late 2008, when TNA released their PPV event schedule for February to October 2009. On the list, Bound for Glory was scheduled to take place on October 18. The location for Bound for Glory was first announced during a promotional video package which aired during TNA's anniversary PPV event Slammiversary on June 21, 2009, stating that it would be held in Los Angeles, California. Later that evening, TNA issued their first public written statement regarding the event via a press release announcing that Bound for Glory would be held at the Bren Events Center located on the University of California at Irvine campus in Irvine, California; contradicting their earlier promotional video package proclaiming it would be held in Los Angeles. Tickets for the event went on sale August 1, 2009. On August 23, 2009, TNA published an article on their official site giving a first look at the Bound for Glory 2009 poster, which featured Sting, an updated Bound for Glory logo, advertising for the event, and the tagline \\"The Final Curtain?\\". In August 2009, the official site for the fifth incarnation was opened at BoundforGlory5.com; Crawl Back In, a single by the rock band Dead by Sunrise to be featured on their debut album Out of Ashes was announced as the official theme song of the event on the site. =Storylines= Bound for Glory featured nine professional wrestling matches and one pre-show match that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. The primary match featured was between A.J. Styles and Sting, wrestling for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. In August 2009 on the television show TNA Impact!, during a depressing period for Styles over his setbacks that year, Sting delivered a motivational speech to Styles that ceased him from retiring from professional wrestling. Wanting Styles to be the guy that carried the torch after him, Sting told Styles to get his head in the game and \\"claim what's supposed to be, yours!\\". Going on to earn his opportunity at the World Title the next week, on September 20 at No Surrender the next month, Styles faced off against Kurt Angle, Matt Morgan, Hernandez (who was cashing in his Feast or Fired briefcase he earned at the December Final Resolution 2008 PPV) and Sting in a five-way match for the title. On that night, Styles moved in for the victory when Sting stepped aside, allowing him to capture his first reign under the TNA World Title belt, after which turned into a celebratory night. Shortly later in the week, Styles, showing his gratitude, rewarded Sting a shot at his title on October 18 at Bound for Glory, an event that would transpire in Sting's home state of California. A predominant feud was Matt Morgan rivaling Kurt Angle. Beginning in April 2009, Matt Morgan, not a former world champion himself but noticed others who were invited to membership without those credentials, started campaigning to become a member of the villainous Main Event Mafia group, consisting of former world champions and headed by then-TNA World Heavyweight Champion Kurt Angle. Angle hired Morgan as an assistant and constantly vowed that while Morgan carried out a few tasks, he would also be under consideration as a member. After given the run-around for far too long, it turned out that Angle's intentions were to use Morgan to keep his reign as world champion. Their friction continued to heat up for weeks, and on September 20 at No Surrender, Morgan competed in a five-way match with AJ Styles, Hernandez, Sting, and Kurt Angle, who he cost a world title loss, and as a result, turned into a fan favorite. Morgan soon revoked his interest in Main Event Mafia, continuing his feud with Angle. Another feud was between Abyss and Mick Foley. On August 16 at Hard Justice, after Mick Foley lost to Kevin Nash to be dethroned of the TNA Legends Championship, Abyss saved Foley from a post-match attack involving a beat down with a barbed wire bat by Nash. Foley showed his appreciation by giving Abyss a gift in the form of one of his signature flannel shirts. On the September 16 episode of Impact!, Abyss helped fend off Nash from attacking Foley during a match, causing Foley the match by disqualification. The following week, when Foley teamed with Abyss to go up against Booker T and Scott Steiner for the TNA World Tag Team Championship, Foley turned on Abyss, becoming a heel and brutalizing Abyss with a barbed wire bat. Abyss demanded answers, declaring he had idolized Mick Foley and his barbaric ways that much of Foley's career epitomized, and was only trying to save him. Taking Abyss' help as an insult, Foley claimed that Abyss was a \\"carbon copy\\". After Abyss described himself as hardcore and that Foley \\"used to be\\", he challenged Foley to a Monster's Ball match at Bound for Glory.

The main feud heading into Hard Justice was between Kurt Angle, Sting, and Matt Morgan over the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. On TNA's primary television program TNA Impact! in the weeks leading to the event, Morgan competed against A.J. Styles for a spot in the main event at Hard Justice. Morgan won their contest and injured Styles in the process. Angle tried to trade Morgan a spot in The Main Event Mafia in exchange for Morgan making sure that Angle kept his title at the event. Sting had been attacked by Angle and The Main Event Mafia on Impact!, and his presence distracted Kevin Nash and Angle long enough for Mick Foley to win the TNA Legends Championship from Nash with the help of Bobby Lashley. Another feud was between Mick Foley and Kevin Nash over the TNA Legends Championship. Foley had won the title from Nash in a tag team match with special stipulations that also involved Angle and Bobby Lashley. Foley and Nash then argued about whether wrestling was about the wrestling or the money, which heated up their emotions leading into the event. A feud on the mid-card revolved around Rob Terry stealing Hernandez's Feast or Fired Briefcase which holds a title shot at the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. Their match at Hard Justice would be with the briefcase on the line. The final major feud heading into the event was between Abyss, Dr. Stevie, and Jethro Holliday. Dr. Stevie had offered $50,000 to anyone who could beat Abyss, and Holliday took up the offer and attacked Abyss with a steel chair while he was giving an interview on Impact!. Reception 411mania.com writer Arnold Furious rated the event 4 out of 10 stars, which was lower than the 2008 event's rating of 7.6 out of 10 stars.

At Slammiversary, TNA's preceding pay per view, Kurt Angle won the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, and subsequently reclaimed his position as leader of the villainous alliance, The Main Event Mafia. Former champion and executive shareholder of the company, Mick Foley, decided to get a rematch for the title at Victory Road. To appease Angle in getting his match, Foley also gave Main Event Mafia member, Kevin Nash, a match for the TNA Legends Championship against A.J. Styles; he also had created a chance for two other members of the Mafia in Booker T and Scott Steiner to challenge Beer Money, Inc. (the name of the tag team of Robert Roode and James Storm) for the TNA World Tag Team Championship, which they received their chance following their victory over Team 3D (Brother Devon and Brother Ray). After allowing Angle to win the TNA World Heavyweight Championship at Slammiversary, Samoa Joe was initiated into the Main Event Mafia at the expense of its former leader, Sting, which was represented by the Mafia beating down on Sting the edition of Impact! following the show. After weeks of confrontation between Joe and Sting, it was announced on the July 9 edition of Impact! that the two would face each other at Victory Road. Abyss had been seeing a psychiatrist for months in the form of Dr. Stevie in an attempt to overcome his sadistic desires; it came to light eventually that Stevie was physically and mentally abusing his patient and controlling him with stun guns and drugs, eventually recruiting associates (Raven and Daffney) to aid him in controlling Abyss in similar fashion, as well as threatening Abyss's love interest, Lauren Brooke. The provocation continued, and on the July 16 edition of Impact!, it was announced Abyss would face Stevie. Reception The Wrestling Observer newsletter ranked TNA Victory Road 2009 the worst major wrestling show of 2009. Figure Four Weekly webmaster Bryan Alvarez said on the July 19, 2009 edition of \\"The Bryan and Vinny Show\\" that he could not rate any match above two and a half stars, and was critical of the finish to the Beer Money vs. Booker T and Scott Steiner match saying that referee Earl Hebner should not be able to get into a ring faster than James Storm. Alvarez saved his harshest criticism for the Jenna/Sharmell match; not only did he give it a minus five star rating and call it the worst women's match he had ever seen, he said he had been unable to remember the last time he had done so because it had been so long since he had seen a match that bad.List of Wrestling Observer Newsletter awards#Worst Major Wrestling Showhttp://www.f4wonline.com/radio-archive/bryan-and- vinny?year=2009&month;=7&limit;=20‚Ñ¥=DESC ResultsReferencesExternal links *TNAwrestling.com (Official Website of TNA Wrestling) *TNAVictoryRoad.com (Official Website of TNA Wrestling's \\"Victory Road\\" Pay- Per-View) Category:TNA Victory Road Category:Professional wrestling in Orlando, Florida Category:July 2009 events in the United States Category:2009 in Florida Category:2009 Total Nonstop Action Wrestling pay-per-view events Category:Events in Orlando, Florida ","title":"Victory Road (2009)"},{"id":"20825078","text":"Avalon is an historic three-story red brick building in Rochester, Minnesota.

The League was created in 1935, two years after the end of Prohibition, and today has 5,000 members. The League is headquartered in Fitchburg, Wisconsin. The TLW lobbies for member interests at the state and federal level, and supports members in complying with legal issues facing their businesses. Issues include opposition to increases in alcohol and cigarette taxeshttp://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=20226882&BRD;=1134&PAG;=461&dept;_id=150853&rfi;=6 and licensing laws seen as onerous, and opposition to restrictions on gambling machines. The TLW supports programs that aim to combat drunk driving by providing rides to and from bars.http://www.newswise.com/articles/view/505941/Reducing alcohol-impaired driving crashes through the use of social marketing (2006), Rothschild, M.L., Mastin, B., Miller, T.W. Accident Analysis & Prevention 38-6, pg 1218‚Äì1230 At the same time, the TLW has condemned campaigns against binge drinking in Wisconsin as an attempt to \\"demonize\\" people who drink casually to relax. In 2005, lobbyists with the TLW were investigated by the State Ethics Board; the investigation was launched after State Senator Russell Decker was pulled over for drunk driving shortly after leaving an all-you-can-drink event for lawmakers hosted by the TLW. The TLW has focused especially on opposing smoking bans in drinking establishments. When a smoking ban law was proposed in 2008, the TLW worked with state senate majority leader Decker to insert provisions requiring that the ban would not take effect until July 5, 2010, giving members time to adapt, and preventing municipalities from passing laws that would have the same effect in the grace period.http://www.wausaudailyherald.com/article/20081221/WDH0101/812210722/1981 An editorial in the Appleton Post-Crescent stated that this \\"derailed\\" the bill. Previously, the TLW had received money and lobbying help from R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company to fight smoking ban legislation in Wisconsin. Researchers from the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison accused the TLW of working in concert with the tobacco industry and other trade groups to undermine Wisconsin's anti-smoking efforts, particularly its attempts to restrict the sale of cigarettes to minors. The study's conclusions were disputed by Philip Morris and by other members of the coalition.

The activities are supervised by the Ministry of Economy. Functions In accordance to Article 6 of the Corredor Publico Federal law, the main functions of this legal professional are: * To intermediate commercial transaction between buyers and sellers, acting as a licensed broker * To act as judge under commercial arbitration * To act as legal advisor, similar to a solicitor for common law judicial systems * To appraise any kind of goods, services, rights and obligations * To act as a notary public under federal jurisdiction issues; these are focused mainly on commercial transactions The Corredor Publico is similar to a Civil Law notary public, but with specialized training in commercial (mercantile) law.

Modern day Warumungu are mainly concentrated in the region of Tennant Creek and Alice Springs.  Language  Their language was Warumungu, belonging to the Pama‚ÄìNyungan family. It is similar to the Warlpiri spoken by the Warlpiri people. It is a suffixing language, in which verbs are formed by adding a tense suffix (although some verbs are formed by compounding a preverb). As are many of the surviving Indigenous Australian languages, the Warumungu language is undergoing rapid change. The morphology used by younger speakers differs significantly than the one used by older speakers. An example of a Warumungu sentence might be \\" apurtu im deya o warraku taun kana \\", meaning \\" Father's mother, is she there, in town, or not? \\". Warumungu is classified as a living language, but the number of speakers seemed to be decreasing quickly and by the mid-1950s, Australian linguist Robert Hoogenraad estimated that there were only about 700 people who could speak some Warumungu; by 1983, the population was estimated to be as small as 200 speakers. Today, the language is in a robust position compared to many indigenous Australian languages, as it is being acquired by children and used in daily interaction by all generations, and the situation is sustainable though some ethnic group members may prefer Kriol. Country In Norman Tindale's estimation, the Warumungu's lands once extended over some , from the northernmost reach at Mount Grayling (Renner Springs) southwards to the headwaters of the Gosse River. The eastern boundary was around Alroy and Rockhampton Downs. The western limits ran to the sand plan 50 miles west of Tennant Creek.  History  In the 1870s, early white explorers described the Warumungu as a flourishing nation. However, by 1915, invasion and reprisal had brought them to the brink of starvation. In 1934, a reserve that had been set aside for the Warumungu in 1892 was revoked in order to clear the way for gold prospecting. By the 1960s, the Warumungu had been entirely removed from their native land. \\"The post contact history of the Warumungu people is an unvarnished tale of the subordinaton of an Aboriginal society and its welfare to European interests... European settlement meant forced dispossession. This was not a once and for all process, but continued with the Warumungu being shunted around, right up to the 1960s, to accommodate various pastoral and mining interests.\\"Maurice, M. Warumungu Land Claim. Report No.31. Report by the Aboriginal Land Commissioner, Mr Justice Maurice, to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and to the Administrator of the Northern Territory. Australian Government Publishing Service. Canberra, 1988 Tennant Creek is the urban centre of Warumungu country. During the 1970s, the era of Federal government Self-Determination policy, Aboriginal people began to move or return to Tennant Creek from cattle stations and Warrabri Aboriginal settlement. In the face of opposition at their attempts to settle in the town, from authorities and European towns people, Aboriginal people began to establish organisations to gain representation, infrastructure and services for their community. Over the next decade a housing authority Warramunga Pabulu Housing Association (later Julali-kari Council), a health service Anyininginyi Congress and an office of the Central Land Council was opened. Today, Aboriginal people of the region have rights to country surrounding the town, claimed and recognised under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976. The original Land Claim was lodged in 1978, for a decade the Warumungu fought for the return of their traditional lands. The ruling was made in 1988 and the hand back of the claim areas began soon after.The University of Melbourne School of Language and Linguistics (n.d.). Tennant Creek. Retrieved from http://languages- linguistics.unimelb.edu.au/research/past-acla1-regions At the Telegraph Station to the south at Barrow Creek, conflict between the local Kaytetye and Europeans broke out in the 1870s and lead to punitive expeditions, in which many Kaytetye, Warumungu, Anmatjerre, and Alyawarre and Warlpiri were killed. Conflict, largely over cattle, and resultant frontier violence occurred in many places in Central Australia in the first 50 years of settlement, causing the displacement of Aboriginal people. In the early 1900s Alyawarre and Wakaya fled violence at Hatcher's Creek and moved to Alexandria Station and other stations on the Barkly Tablelands. Many moved later to Lake Nash. Eastern Warlpiri people fled after the Coniston massacre in 1928, many onto Warumungu country. By the 1890s it is estimated that 100 people were living at camps around the Tennant Creek Telegraph Station, some receiving rations, some worked for the station. Many came to the site during the 1891-93 droughts, to the perennial waterholes along the creek, which Warumungu people traditionally used in drought years. An area of dry country to the east of the Telegraph Station was gazetted as a Warumungu Reserve in 1892, to be revoked in 1934 to allow mining in the area. In the 1930s gold was discovered, starting a gold rush, which brought hopefuls from across the country. Aboriginal people worked on the mines, many of which were located on what had been the Warumungu Reserve. Tennant Creek town was established in 1934, at a site 7 miles to the south of the Telegraph Station. It was off limits to Aboriginal people until the 1960s. Warumungu and Alyawarre people also worked at mines in the Davenport Murchinson Ranges, after wolfram discovered at Hatcher's Creek in 1913. Many Aboriginal people spent substantial periods of their lives there and on neighbouring Kurandi Station, where, in 1977 Aboriginal workers went on strike and staged a walk off. The life histories of most people include their experiences living on cattle stations, which eventually surrounded the original site of European settlement. Vast tracts of Warumungu country had been granted as pastoral leases and were stocked from the 1880s onwards. Running cattle on these lands was incompatible with Aboriginal hunting and gathering practices and people were forced to settle on stations or the reserve. Many men worked as stockmen, drovers, butchers and gardeners, while women carried out domestic work in the station houses. Payment was generally in rations only and conditions were generally very poor. Native title In 1978, the Central Land Council of the Northern Territory made a claim on behalf of the Warumungu under the Aboriginal Land Rights Act. A lengthy legal battle ensued, in which the litigations eventually went to the High Court of Australia. Fifteen years later, in 1993, most of the land claim was finally returned to the Warumungu. The Warumungu Land Claim is currently made up of ten separate parcels of land, which together make up .

High-level radioactive waste management concerns how radioactive materials created during production of nuclear power and nuclear weapons are dealt with. Radioactive waste contains a mixture of short-lived and long-lived nuclides, as well as non-radioactive nuclides. There was reportedly some of high-level nuclear waste stored in the United States 2002. The most troublesome transuranic elements in spent fuel are neptunium-237 (half-life two million years) and plutonium-239 (half-life 24,000 years). Consequently, high-level radioactive waste requires sophisticated treatment and management to successfully isolate it from the biosphere. This usually necessitates treatment, followed by a long-term management strategy involving permanent storage, disposal or transformation of the waste into a non-toxic form. Radioactive decay follows the half-life rule, which means that the rate of decay is inversely proportional to the duration of decay. In other words, the radiation from a long-lived isotope like iodine-129 will be much less intense than that of short-lived isotope like iodine-131. Governments around the world are considering a range of waste management and disposal options, usually involving deep-geologic placement, although there has been limited progress toward implementing long-term waste management solutions. This is partly because the timeframes in question when dealing with radioactive waste range from 10,000 to millions of years, according to studies based on the effect of estimated radiation doses. Thus, engineer and physicist Hannes Alfv√©n identified two fundamental prerequisites for effective management of high-level radioactive waste: (1) stable geological formations, and (2) stable human institutions over hundreds of thousands of years. As Alfv√©n suggests, no known human civilization has ever endured for so long, and no geologic formation of adequate size for a permanent radioactive waste repository has yet been discovered that has been stable for so long a period. Nevertheless, avoiding confronting the risks associated with managing radioactive wastes may create countervailing risks of greater magnitude. Radioactive waste management is an example of policy analysis that requires special attention to ethical concerns, examined in the light of uncertainty and futurity: consideration of 'the impacts of practices and technologies on future generations'.Genevieve Fuji Johnson, Deliberative Democracy for the Future: The Case of Nuclear Waste Management in Canada, University of Toronto Press, 2008, p.9 There is a debate over what should constitute an acceptable scientific and engineering foundation for proceeding with radioactive waste disposal strategies. There are those who have argued, on the basis of complex geochemical simulation models, that relinquishing control over radioactive materials to geohydrologic processes at repository closure is an acceptable risk. They maintain that so- called \\"natural analogues\\" inhibit subterranean movement of radionuclides, making disposal of radioactive wastes in stable geologic formations unnecessary.Bruno, Jordi, Lara Duro, and Mireia Griv√©. 2001.

QuantiSci S. L. Parc Tecnol√≤gic del Vall√®s, Spain, for Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management Co. However, existing models of these processes are empirically underdetermined:Shrader-Frechette, Kristin S. 1988. \\"Values and hydrogeological method: How not to site the world‚Äôs largest nuclear dump\\" In Planning for Changing Energy conditions, John Byrne and Daniel Rich, eds. New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction Books, p. 101 due to the subterranean nature of such processes in solid geologic formations, the accuracy of computer simulation models has not been verified by empirical observation, certainly not over periods of time equivalent to the lethal half- lives of high-level radioactive waste.Shrader-Frechette, Kristin S.

Expert judgment in assessing radwaste risks: What Nevadans should know about Yucca Mountain. Carson City: Nevada Agency for Nuclear Projects, Nuclear Waste Project, 1992 On the other hand, some insist deep geologic repositories in stable geologic formations are necessary. National management plans of various countries display a variety of approaches to resolving this debate. Researchers suggest that forecasts of health detriment for such long periods should be examined critically. Practical studies only consider up to 100 years as far as effective planning and cost evaluations are concerned. Long term behaviour of radioactive wastes remains a subject for ongoing research. Management strategies and implementation plans of several representative national governments are described below. Geologic disposal The International Panel on Fissile Materials has said: > It is widely accepted that spent nuclear fuel and high-level reprocessing > and plutonium wastes require well-designed storage for periods ranging from > tens of thousands to a million years, to minimize releases of the contained > radioactivity into the environment. Safeguards are also required to ensure > that neither plutonium nor highly enriched uranium is diverted to weapon > use. There is general agreement that placing spent nuclear fuel in > repositories hundreds of meters below the surface would be safer than > indefinite storage of spent fuel on the surface. The process of selecting appropriate permanent repositories for high level waste and spent fuel is now under way in several countries with the first expected to be commissioned some time after 2017. The basic concept is to locate a large, stable geologic formation and use mining technology to excavate a tunnel, or large-bore tunnel boring machines (similar to those used to drill the Channel Tunnel from England to France) to drill a shaft below the surface where rooms or vaults can be excavated for disposal of high-level radioactive waste. The goal is to permanently isolate nuclear waste from the human environment. However, many people remain uncomfortable with the immediate stewardship cessation of this disposal system, suggesting perpetual management and monitoring would be more prudent. Because some radioactive species have half-lives longer than one million years, even very low container leakage and radionuclide migration rates must be taken into account. Moreover, it may require more than one half-life until some nuclear materials lose enough radioactivity to no longer be lethal to living organisms. A 1983 review of the Swedish radioactive waste disposal program by the National Academy of Sciences found that country‚Äôs estimate of several hundred thousand years‚Äîperhaps up to one million years‚Äîbeing necessary for waste isolation \\"fully justified.\\" The proposed land-based subductive waste disposal method would dispose of nuclear waste in a subduction zone accessed from land, and therefore is not prohibited by international agreement. This method has been described as a viable means of disposing of radioactive waste, and as a state- of-the-art nuclear waste disposal technology. In nature, sixteen repositories were discovered at the Oklo mine in Gabon where natural nuclear fission reactions took place 1.7 billion years ago. The fission products in these natural formations were found to have moved less than 10 ft (3 m) over this period, though the lack of movement may be due more to retention in the uraninite structure than to insolubility and sorption from moving ground water; uraninite crystals are better preserved here than those in spent fuel rods because of a less complete nuclear reaction, so that reaction products would be less accessible to groundwater attack.Krauskopf, Konrad B. 1988. Radioactive waste and geology. New York: Chapman and Hall, 101‚Äì102. Horizontal drillhole disposal describes proposals to drill over one kilometer vertically, and two kilometers horizontally in the earth‚Äôs crust, for the purpose of disposing of high-level waste forms such as spent nuclear fuel, Caesium-137, or Strontium-90. After the emplacement and the retrievability period, drillholes would be backfilled and sealed. A series of tests of the technology were carried out in November 2018 and then again publicly in January 2019 by a U.S. based private company. The test demonstrated the emplacement of a test-canister in a horizontal drillhole and retrieval of the same canister. There was no actual high-level waste used in this test. Materials for geological disposal In order to store the high level radioactive waste in long-term geological depositories, specific waste forms need to be used which will allow the radioactivity to decay away while the materials retain their integrity for thousands of years.Clark, S., Ewing, R. Panel 5 Report: Advanced Waste Forms. Basic Research Needs for Advanced Energy Systems 2006, 59‚Äì74. The materials being used can be broken down into a few classes: glass waste forms, ceramic waste forms, and nanostructured materials. The glass forms include borosilicate glasses and phosphate glasses. Borosilicate nuclear waste glasses are used on an industrial scale to immobilize high level radioactive waste in many countries which are producers of nuclear energy or have nuclear weaponry. The glass waste forms have the advantage of being able to accommodate a wide variety of waste-stream compositions, they are easy to scale up to industrial processing, and they are stable against thermal, radiative, and chemical perturbations. These glasses function by binding radioactive elements to nonradioactive glass-forming elements. Phosphate glasses while not being used industrially have much lower dissolution rates than borosilicate glasses, which make them a more favorable option. However, no single phosphate material has the ability to accommodate all of the radioactive products so phosphate storage requires more reprocessing to separate the waste into distinct fractions. Both glasses have to be processed at elevated temperatures making them unusable for some of the more volatile radiotoxic elements. The ceramic waste forms offer higher waste loadings than the glass options because ceramics have crystalline structure. Also, mineral analogues of the ceramic waste forms provide evidence for long term durability.Weber W. J., Navrotsky A., Stefanovsky S., Vance E.R., Vernaz E. Materials Science of High-Level Nuclear Waste Immobilization. MRS Bulletin 2009, 34, 46. Due to this fact and the fact that they can be processed at lower temperatures, ceramics are often considered the next generation in high level radioactive waste forms. Ceramic waste forms offer great potential, but a lot of research remains to be done. National management plans Finland, the United States and Sweden are the most advanced in developing a deep repository for high-level radioactive waste disposal. Countries vary in their plans on disposing used fuel directly or after reprocessing, with France and Japan having an extensive commitment to reprocessing. The country-specific status of high-level waste management plans are described below. In many European countries (e.g., Britain, Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland) the risk or dose limit for a member of the public exposed to radiation from a future high-level nuclear waste facility is considerably more stringent than that suggested by the International Commission on Radiation Protection or proposed in the United States. European limits are often more stringent than the standard suggested in 1990 by the International Commission on Radiation Protection by a factor of 20, and more stringent by a factor of ten than the standard proposed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository for the first 10,000 years after closure. Moreover, the U.S. EPA‚Äôs proposed standard for greater than 10,000 years is 250 times more permissive than the European limit. The countries that have made the most progress towards a repository for high-level radioactive waste have typically started with public consultations and made voluntary siting a necessary condition. This consensus seeking approach is believed to have a greater chance of success than top-down modes of decision making, but the process is necessarily slow, and there is \\"inadequate experience around the world to know if it will succeed in all existing and aspiring nuclear nations\\".M.V. Ramana. Nuclear Power: Economic, Safety, Health, and Environmental Issues of Near-Term Technologies, Annual Review of Environment and Resources, 2009, 34, p. 145. Moreover, most communities do not want to host a nuclear waste repository as they are \\"concerned about their community becoming a de facto site for waste for thousands of years, the health and environmental consequences of an accident, and lower property values\\".Benjamin K. Sovacool (2011). Contesting the Future of Nuclear Power: A Critical Global Assessment of Atomic Energy, World Scientific, p. 144. =Asia=China In China (People's Republic of China), ten reactors provide about 2% of electricity and five more are under construction. China made a commitment to reprocessing in the 1980s; a pilot plant is under construction at Lanzhou, where a temporary spent fuel storage facility has been constructed. Geological disposal has been studied since 1985, and a permanent deep geological repository was required by law in 2003. Sites in Gansu Province near the Gobi desert in northwestern China are under investigation, with a final site expected to be selected by 2020, and actual disposal by about 2050. Taiwan In Taiwan (Republic of China), nuclear waste storage facility was built at the Southern tip of Orchid Island in Taitung County, offshore of Taiwan Island. The facility was built in 1982 and it is owned and operated by Taipower. The facility receives nuclear waste from Taipower's current three nuclear power plants. However, due to the strong resistance from local community in the island, the nuclear waste has to be stored at the power plant facilities themselves.http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aipl/201304030025.aspxhttp://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2012/02/21/2003525985 India India adopted a closed fuel cycle, which involves reprocessing and recycling of the spent fuel. The reprocessing results in 2-3% of the spent fuel going to waste while the rest is recycled. The waste fuel, called high level liquid waste, is converted to glass through vitrification. Vitrified waste is then stored for a period of 30-40 years for cooling. Sixteen nuclear reactors produce about 3% of India‚Äôs electricity, and seven more are under construction. Spent fuel is processed at facilities in Trombay near Mumbai, at Tarapur on the west coast north of Mumbai, and at Kalpakkam on the southeast coast of India. Plutonium will be used in a fast breeder reactor (under construction) to produce more fuel, and other waste vitrified at Tarapur and Trombay. Interim storage for 30 years is expected, with eventual disposal in a deep geological repository in crystalline rock near Kalpakkam. Japan In 2000, a Specified Radioactive Waste Final Disposal Act called for creation of a new organization to manage high level radioactive waste, and later that year the Nuclear Waste Management Organization of Japan (NUMO) was established under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. NUMO is responsible for selecting a permanent deep geological repository site, construction, operation and closure of the facility for waste emplacement by 2040. Site selection began in 2002 and application information was sent to 3,239 municipalities, but by 2006, no local government had volunteered to host the facility. K≈çchi Prefecture showed interest in 2007, but its mayor resigned due to local opposition. In December 2013 the government decided to identify suitable candidate areas before approaching municipalities. The head of the Science Council of Japan‚Äôs expert panel has said Japan's seismic conditions makes it difficult to predict ground conditions over the necessary 100,000 years, so it will be impossible to convince the public of the safety of deep geological disposal. =Europe=Belgium Belgium has seven nuclear reactors that provide about 52% of its electricity. Belgian spent nuclear fuel was initially sent for reprocessing in France. In 1993, reprocessing was suspended following a resolution of the Belgian parliament; spent fuel is since being stored on the sites of the nuclear power plants. The deep disposal of high-level radioactive waste (HLW) has been studied in Belgium for more than 30 years. Boom Clay is studied as a reference host formation for HLW disposal. The Hades underground research laboratory (URL) is located at in the Boom Formation at the Mol site. The Belgian URL is operated by the Euridice Economic Interest Group, a joint organisation between SCK‚Ä¢CEN, the Belgian Nuclear Research Centre which initiated the research on waste disposal in Belgium in the 1970s and 1980s and ONDRAF/NIRAS, the Belgian agency for radioactive waste management. In Belgium, the regulatory body in charge of guidance and licensing approval is the Federal Agency of Nuclear Control, created in 2001. Finland In 1983, the government decided to select a site for permanent repository by 2010. With four nuclear reactors providing 29% of its electricity, Finland in 1987 enacted a Nuclear Energy Act making the producers of radioactive waste responsible for its disposal, subject to requirements of its Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority and an absolute veto given to local governments in which a proposed repository would be located. Producers of nuclear waste organized the company Posiva, with responsibility for site selection, construction and operation of a permanent repository. A 1994 amendment to the Act required final disposal of spent fuel in Finland, prohibiting the import or export of radioactive waste. Environmental assessment of four sites occurred in 1997‚Äì98, Posiva chose the Olkiluoto site near two existing reactors, and the local government approved it in 2000. The Finnish Parliament approved a deep geologic repository there in igneous bedrock at a depth of about in 2001. The repository concept is similar to the Swedish model, with containers to be clad in copper and buried below the water table beginning in 2020. An underground characterization facility, Onkalo spent nuclear fuel repository, was under construction at the site in 2012. France With 58 nuclear reactors contributing about 75% of its electricity, the highest percentage of any country, France has been reprocessing its spent reactor fuel since the introduction of nuclear power there. Some reprocessed plutonium is used to make fuel, but more is being produced than is being recycled as reactor fuel. France also reprocesses spent fuel for other countries, but the nuclear waste is returned to the country of origin. Radioactive waste from reprocessing French spent fuel is expected to be disposed of in a geological repository, pursuant to legislation enacted in 1991 that established a 15-year period for conducting radioactive waste management research. Under this legislation, partition and transmutation of long-lived elements, immobilization and conditioning processes, and long-term near surface storage are being investigated by the Commissariat √† l‚ÄôEnergie Atomique (CEA). Disposal in deep geological formations is being studied by the French agency for radioactive waste management, L'Agence Nationale pour la Gestion des D√©chets Radioactifs, in underground research labs. Three sites were identified for possible deep geologic disposal in clay near the border of Meuse and Haute-Marne, near Gard, and at Vienne. In 1998 the government approved the Meuse/Haute Marne Underground Research Laboratory, a site near Meuse/Haute-Marne and dropped the others from further consideration. Legislation was proposed in 2006 to license a repository by 2020, with operations expected in 2035. Germany nuclear waste disposal centre at Gorleben in northern Germany Nuclear waste policy in Germany is in flux. German planning for a permanent geologic repository began in 1974, focused on salt dome Gorleben, a salt mine near Gorleben about northeast of Braunschweig. The site was announced in 1977 with plans for a reprocessing plant, spent fuel management, and permanent disposal facilities at a single site. Plans for the reprocessing plant were dropped in 1979. In 2000, the federal government and utilities agreed to suspend underground investigations for three to ten years, and the government committed to ending its use of nuclear power, closing one reactor in 2003. Within days of the March 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, Chancellor Angela Merkel \\"imposed a three-month moratorium on previously announced extensions for Germany's existing nuclear power plants, while shutting seven of the 17 reactors that had been operating since 1981\\". Protests continued and, on 29 May 2011, Merkel's government announced that it would close all of its nuclear power plants by 2022. Meanwhile, electric utilities have been transporting spent fuel to interim storage facilities at Gorleben, Lubmin and Ahaus until temporary storage facilities can be built near reactor sites. Previously, spent fuel was sent to France or the United Kingdom for reprocessing, but this practice was ended in July 2005. Netherlands COVRA (Centrale Organisatie Voor Radioactief Afval) is the Dutch interim nuclear waste processing and storage company in Vlissingen,COVRA website which stores the waste produced in their only remaining nuclear power plant after it is reprocessed by Areva NCAREVA NC - nuclear energy, nuclear fuel - La Hague in La Hague, Manche, Normandy, France. Until the Dutch government decides what to do with the waste, it will stay at COVRA, which currently has a license to operate for one hundred years. As of early 2017, there are no plans for a permanent disposal facility. Russia In Russia, the Ministry of Atomic Energy (Minatom) is responsible for 31 nuclear reactors which generate about 16% of its electricity. Minatom is also responsible for reprocessing and radioactive waste disposal, including over of spent nuclear fuel in temporary storage in 2001. Russia has a long history of reprocessing spent fuel for military purposes, and previously planned to reprocess imported spent fuel, possibly including some of the of spent fuel accumulated at sites in other countries who received fuel from the U.S., which the U.S. originally pledged to take back, such as Brazil, the Czech Republic, India, Japan, Mexico, Slovenia, South Korea, Switzerland, Taiwan, and the European Union. An Environmental Protection Act in 1991 prohibited importing radioactive material for long-term storage or burial in Russia, but controversial legislation to allow imports for permanent storage was passed by the Russian Parliament and signed by President Putin in 2001. In the long term, the Russian plan is for deep geologic disposal. Most attention has been paid to locations where waste has accumulated in temporary storage at Mayak, near Chelyabinsk in the Ural Mountains, and in granite at Krasnoyarsk in Siberia. Spain Spain has five active nuclear plants with seven reactors which produced 21% of the country's electricity in 2013. Furthermore, there is legacy high-level waste from another two older, closed plants. Between 2004 and 2011, a bipartisan initiative of the Spanish Government promoted the construction of an interim centralized storage facility (ATC, Almac√©n Temporal Centralizado), similar to the Dutch COVRA concept. In late 2011 and early 2012 the final green light was given, preliminary studies were being completed and land was purchased near Villar de Ca√±as (Cuenca) after a competitive tender process. The facility would be initially licensed for 60 years. However, soon before groundbreaking was slated to begin in 2015, the project was stopped because of a mix of geological, technical, political and ecological problems. By late 2015, the Regional Government considered it \\"obsolete\\" and effectively \\"paralyzed.\\" As of early 2017, the project has not been shelved but it stays frozen and no further action is expected anytime soon. Meanwhile, the spent nuclear fuel and other high-level waste is being kept in the plants' pools, as well as on-site dry cask storage (almacenes temporales individualizados) in Garo√±a and Trillo. As of early 2017, there are no plans for a permanent high-level disposal facility either. Low- and medium- level waste is stored in the El Cabril facility (Province of Cordoba.) Sweden In Sweden, as of 2007 there are ten operating nuclear reactors that produce about 45% of its electricity. Two other reactors in Barseb√§ck were shut down in 1999 and 2005. When these reactors were built, it was expected their nuclear fuel would be reprocessed in a foreign country, and the reprocessing waste would not be returned to Sweden. Later, construction of a domestic reprocessing plant was contemplated, but has not been built. Passage of the Stipulation Act of 1977 transferred responsibility for nuclear waste management from the government to the nuclear industry, requiring reactor operators to present an acceptable plan for waste management with \\"absolute safety\\" in order to obtain an operating license. In early 1980, after the Three Mile Island meltdown in the United States, a referendum was held on the future use of nuclear power in Sweden. In late 1980, after a three-question referendum produced mixed results, the Swedish Parliament decided to phase out existing reactors by 2010. On 5 February 2009, the Government of Sweden announced an agreement allowing for the replacement of existing reactors, effectively ending the phase-out policy. In 2010, the Swedish government opened up for construction of new nuclear reactors. The new units can only be built at the existing nuclear power sites, Oskarshamn, Ringhals or Forsmark, and only to replace one of the existing reactors, that will have to be shut down for the new one to be able to start up. The Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management Company. (Svensk K√§rnbr√§nslehantering AB, known as SKB) was created in 1980 and is responsible for final disposal of nuclear waste there. This includes operation of a monitored retrievable storage facility, the Central Interim Storage Facility for Spent Nuclear Fuel at Oskarshamn, about south of Stockholm on the Baltic coast; transportation of spent fuel; and construction of a permanent repository. Swedish utilities store spent fuel at the reactor site for one year before transporting it to the facility at Oskarshamn, where it will be stored in excavated caverns filled with water for about 30 years before removal to a permanent repository. Conceptual design of a permanent repository was determined by 1983, calling for placement of copper-clad iron canisters in granite bedrock about underground, below the water table in what is known as the KBS-3 method. Space around the canisters will be filled with bentonite clay. After examining six possible locations for a permanent repository, three were nominated for further investigation, at Osthammar, Oskarshamn, and Tierp. On 3 June 2009, Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Co. chose a location for a deep-level waste site at √ñsthammar, near Forsmark Nuclear Power plant. The application to build the repository was handed in by SKB 2011. Switzerland Switzerland has five nuclear reactors that provide about 43% of its electricity around 2007 (34% in 2015). Some Swiss spent nuclear fuel has been sent for reprocessing in France and the United Kingdom; most fuel is being stored without reprocessing. An industry- owned organization, ZWILAG, built and operates a central interim storage facility for spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste, and for conditioning low-level radioactive waste and for incinerating wastes. Other interim storage facilities predating ZWILAG continue to operate in Switzerland. The Swiss program is considering options for the siting of a deep repository for high-level radioactive waste disposal, and for low and intermediate level wastes. Construction of a repository is not foreseen until well into this century. Research on sedimentary rock (especially Opalinus Clay) is carried out at the Swiss Mont Terri rock laboratory; the Grimsel Test Site, an older facility in crystalline rock is also still active. United Kingdom Great Britain has 19 operating reactors, producing about 20% of its electricity. It processes much of its spent fuel at Sellafield on the northwest coast across from Ireland, where nuclear waste is vitrified and sealed in stainless steel canisters for dry storage above ground for at least 50 years before eventual deep geologic disposal. Sellafield has a history of environmental and safety problems, including a fire in a nuclear plant in Windscale, and a significant incident in 2005 at the main reprocessing plant (THORP). In 1982 the Nuclear Industry Radioactive Waste Management Executive (NIREX) was established with responsibility for disposing of long-lived nuclear waste and in 2006 a Committee on Radioactive Waste Management (CoRWM) of the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs recommended geologic disposal underground. NIREX developed a generic repository concept based on the Swedish model but has not yet selected a site. A Nuclear Decommissioning Authority is responsible for packaging waste from reprocessing and will eventually relieve British Nuclear Fuels Ltd. of responsibility for power reactors and the Sellafield reprocessing plant. =North America=Canada The 18 operating nuclear power plants in Canada generated about 16% of its electricity in 2006. A national Nuclear Fuel Waste Act was enacted by the Canadian Parliament in 2002, requiring nuclear energy corporations to create a waste management organization to propose to the Government of Canada approaches for management of nuclear waste, and implementation of an approach subsequently selected by the government. The Act defined management as \\"long term management by means of storage or disposal, including handling, treatment, conditioning or transport for the purpose of storage or disposal.\\" The resulting Nuclear Waste Management Organization (NWMO) conducted an extensive three-year study and consultation with Canadians. In 2005, they recommended Adaptive Phased Management, an approach that emphasized both technical and management methods. The technical method included centralized isolation and containment of spent nuclear fuel in a deep geologic repository in a suitable rock formation, such as the granite of the Canadian Shield or Ordovician sedimentary rocks. Also recommended was a phased decision making process supported by a program of continuous learning, research and development. In 2007, the Canadian government accepted this recommendation, and NWMO was tasked with implementing the recommendation. No specific timeframe was defined for the process. In 2009, the NWMO was designing the process for site selection; siting was expected to take 10 years or more. United States The locations across the U.S. where nuclear waste is stored The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 established a timetable and procedure for constructing a permanent, underground repository for high-level radioactive waste by the mid-1990s, and provided for some temporary storage of waste, including spent fuel from 104 civilian nuclear reactors that produce about 19.4% of electricity there. The United States in April 2008 had about of spent fuel and 20,000 canisters of solid defense-related waste, and this is expected to increase to by 2035. The U.S. opted for Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository, a final repository at Yucca Mountain in Nevada, but this project was widely opposed, with some of the main concerns being long distance transportation of waste from across the United States to this site, the possibility of accidents, and the uncertainty of success in isolating nuclear waste from the human environment in perpetuity. Yucca Mountain, with capacity for of radioactive waste, was expected to open in 2017. However, the Obama Administration rejected use of the site in the 2009 United States Federal Budget proposal, which eliminated all funding except that needed to answer inquiries from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, \\"while the Administration devises a new strategy toward nuclear waste disposal.\\"A New Era of Responsibility, The 2010 Budget, p. 65. On March 5, 2009, Energy Secretary Steven Chu told a Senate hearing \\"the Yucca Mountain site no longer was viewed as an option for storing reactor waste.\\"Hebert, H. Josef. 2009. \\"Nuclear waste won't be going to Nevada's Yucca Mountain, Obama official says.\\" Chicago Tribune. March 6, 2009, 4. Accessed 3-6-09. Starting in 1999, military- generated nuclear waste is being entombed at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico. Since the fraction of a radioisotope's atoms decaying per unit of time is inversely proportional to its half-life, the relative radioactivity of a quantity of buried human radioactive waste would diminish over time compared to natural radioisotopes; such as the decay chains of of thorium and of uranium which are at relatively trace concentrations of parts per million each over the crust's mass.American Geophysical Union, Fall Meeting 2007, abstract #V33A-1161. Mass and Composition of the Continental Crust For instance, over a timeframe of thousands of years, after the most active short half-life radioisotopes decayed, burying U.S. nuclear waste would increase the radioactivity in the top of rock and soil in the United States () by ‚âà 1 part in 10 million over the cumulative amount of natural radioisotopes in such a volume, although the vicinity of the site would have a far higher concentration of artificial radioisotopes underground than such an average.Interdisciplinary Science Reviews 23:193‚Äì203;1998. Dr. Bernard L. Cohen, University of Pittsburgh. Perspectives on the High Level Waste Disposal Problem In a Presidential Memorandum dated January 29, 2010, President Obama established the Blue Ribbon Commission on America‚Äôs Nuclear Future (the Commission). The Commission, composed of fifteen members, conducted an extensive two-year study of nuclear waste disposal, what is referred to as the \\"back end\\" of the nuclear energy process. The Commission established three subcommittees: Reactor and Fuel Cycle Technology, Transportation and Storage, and Disposal. On January 26, 2012, the Commission submitted its final report to Energy Secretary Steven Chu. In the Disposal Subcommittee‚Äôs final report the Commission does not issue recommendations for a specific site but rather presents a comprehensive recommendation for disposal strategies. During their research the Commission visited Finland, France, Japan, Russia, Sweden, and the UK. In their final report the Commission put forth seven recommendations for developing a comprehensive strategy to pursue: ; Recommendation #1: The United States should undertake an integrated nuclear waste management program that leads to the timely development of one or more permanent deep geological facilities for the safe disposal of spent fuel and high-level nuclear waste. ; Recommendation #2: A new, single-purpose organization is needed to develop and implement a focused, integrated program for the transportation, storage, and disposal of nuclear waste in the United States. ; Recommendation #3: Assured access to the balance in the Nuclear Waste Fund (NWF) and to the revenues generated by annual nuclear waste fee payments from utility ratepayers is absolutely essential and must be provided to the new nuclear waste management organization. ; Recommendation #4: A new approach is needed to site and develop nuclear waste facilities in the United States in the future. We believe that these processes are most likely to succeed if they are: * Adaptive‚Äîin the sense that process itself is flexible and produces decisions that are responsive to new information and new technical, social, or political developments. * Staged‚Äîin the sense that key decisions are revisited and modified as necessary along the way rather than being pre-determined in advance. * Consent-based‚Äîin the sense that affected communities have an opportunity to decide whether to accept facility siting decisions and retain significant local control. * Transparent‚Äîin the sense that all stakeholders have an opportunity to understand key decisions and engage in the process in a meaningful way. * Standards- and science-based‚Äîin the sense that the public can have confidence that all facilities meet rigorous, objective, and consistently-applied standards of safety and environmental protection. * Governed by partnership arrangements or legally-enforceable agreements with host states, tribes and local communities. ; Recommendation #5: The current division of regulatory responsibilities for long-term repository performance between the NRC and the EPA is appropriate and should continue. The two agencies should develop new, site-independent safety standards in a formally coordinated joint process that actively engages and solicits input from all the relevant constituencies. ; Recommendation #6: The roles, responsibilities, and authorities of local, state, and tribal governments (with respect to facility siting and other aspects of nuclear waste disposal) must be an element of the negotiation between the federal government and the other affected units of government in establishing a disposal facility. In addition to legally-binding agreements, as discussed in Recommendation #4, all affected levels of government (local, state, tribal, etc.) must have, at a minimum, a meaningful consultative role in all other important decisions. Additionally, states and tribes should retain‚Äîor where appropriate, be delegated‚Äîdirect authority over aspects of regulation, permitting, and operations where oversight below the federal level can be exercised effectively and in a way that is helpful in protecting the interests and gaining the confidence of affected communities and citizens. ; Recommendation #7: The Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board (NWTRB) should be retained as a valuable source of independent technical advice and review. =International repository= Although Australia does not have any nuclear power reactors, Pangea Resources considered siting an international repository in the outback of South Australia or Western Australia in 1998, but this stimulated legislative opposition in both states and the Australian national Senate during the following year. Thereafter, Pangea ceased operations in Australia but reemerged as Pangea International Association, and in 2002 evolved into the Association for Regional and International Underground Storage with support from Belgium, Bulgaria, Hungary, Japan and Switzerland. A general concept for an international repository has been advanced by one of the principals in all three ventures. Russia has expressed interest in serving as a repository for other countries, but does not envision sponsorship or control by an international body or group of other countries. South Africa, Argentina and western China have also been mentioned as possible locations. In the EU, COVRA is negotiating a European-wide waste disposal system with single disposal sites that can be used by several EU-countries. This EU-wide storage possibility is being researched under the SAPIERR-2 program.

He is best known as the architect of Navy Pier and for designing over 100 buildings for the Chicago and North Western Railway. Biography Born in Lewiston, Maine, Frost was first a draftsman in Boston, and graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1876. While working in Boston he worked for the firm of Peabody and Stearns from 1876 to 1881.Stuart Cohen and Susan Bejamin; North Shore Chicago; Houses of the Lakefront Suburbs 1890-1940 Acanthus Press, 2004, p.311 He moved to Chicago in 1882, when he began a partnership with Henry Ives Cobb. Together, they established the firm Cobb and Frost, which was active from 1882 to 1898. After the partnership ended, he worked alone. Frost married Mary Hughitt, a daughter of Marvin Hughitt, the President of the Chicago and North Western Railroad, in 1897. On January 1, 1898, he partnered with his brother-in-law, Alfred Hoyt Granger, to form the firm of Frost and Granger. Frost and Granger were known for their designs of train stations and terminals, including the now- demolished Chicago and North Western Terminal. Frost designed 127 buildings for the Chicago and North Western Railroad alone.http://gis.hpa.state.il.us/pdfs/200342.pdf After Frost and Granger dissolved in 1910, Frost continued to work independently, designing such structures as the Navy Pier Auditorium. Frost Papers at UMN Frost was a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects. He retired on December 31, 1928 and died on December 11, 1931 in Chicago.

This Ohio state park lies on the banks of the Maumee River and features ruins of the Miami and Erie Canal. The park was established in 1949 and is open for year-round recreation including, boating, fishing, hiking and picnicking. It is off U.S. Route 24 just east of Defiance, Ohio. History Independence Dam State Park is near the confluence of the Auglaize River and Maumee River. The area has played a key role in the history of northwest Ohio providing a travel route for numerous Indian tribes including the Iroquois, Miami, Lenape, Ottawa, Erie, Wyandot, and Shawnee. Anglo-American explorers were also drawn to the rivers for many of the same reasons as the Native Americans. It provided a reliable source of water as well as an abundance of fish and game. Two Indian leaders spent part of their lives in the area. Pontiac, an Ottawa leader, is believed to have been born near the confluence of the rivers. He went on to lead what is known as Pontiac's Rebellion against the trade policies of the British rulers in the years following the French and Indian War. Blue Jacket a Shawnee leader made his home in the area. He was a leader in the Northwest Indian War an effort by a united group of tribes to halt the westward expansion of American settlement. President George Washington dispatched General Anthony Wayne and his army to the Northwest Territory to put down the Indian uprising. After the Native Americans were driven out and west, the land was opened to settlement by Anglo-Americans. Homesteaders arrived soon after. They cleared the land and began farming. The Miami and Erie and Wabash and Erie Canals passed through the area of Independence State Park. The canals connected the Ohio River with Lake Erie. Cities such as Defiance grew along the banks of the canal. They developed into trade and industrial centers. The canal system thrived for about thirty years in the mid-to-late 19th century before they were replaced by the railroads. Independence Dam on the Maumee River A flood in 1913 destroyed much of what remained of the canals. Seven preserved miles of the canal stretch between Independence Dam State Park and Ohio State Route 424. The ruins of Lock Number Thirteen of the canal are crossed by the main park entrance. Independence Dam was built in the 19th century to provide water for the canal system. The original wooden dam was replaced in 1924 by the current concrete dam. At this time several civic organizations began a drive to set aside the land between the river and the canal as a state park. The Ohio Department of Public Works purchased the lands and Independence Dam State Park was opened to the public in 1949. Ecology Independence Dam State Park is in the Maumee Valley. This valley has been changed tremendously since it was settled after the Northwest Indian War. It was in the middle of the Great Black Swamp which was 30 to wide and about long. It was a heavily forested area that was home to massive sycamore trees that were converted into barns and in some cases homes. Oak and tulip trees were mixed in with the sycamore and walnut. Nearly every tree was cut in less than 100 years after the settlement of Ohio. The Maumee River as seen from Independence State Park The Maumee Valley was one of the last areas of Ohio to be cleared. The swampy ground made it difficult for settlers to enter. The swamp was drained between 1859 and 1875 with a series of ditches and drains. Nearly of land were cleared after the swamps were emptied. The region was covered with farms, as it is today, by 1885. Only six percent of the Maumee Valley is now covered with forests, some of this land is in Independence Dam State Park and up and down the Maumee River from the park. Stands of great sycamore, beech, maple and black locust trees line the river banks. The river banks support a variety of woodland plant and animals including skunks, raccoons, fox squirrels, groundhogs, jewelweed, spring beauties, Louisiana waterthrush, and yellow-throated warblers. Recreation Independence Dam State Park is open for year-round recreation. Access to the Maumee River is provided at the park. Unlimited horsepower boating is allowed on the river. A four-mile (6 km) section above Independence Dam is open to water skiing. The river is home to northern pike, crappie, walleye, smallmouth bass, and catfish. Anglers must have a valid Ohio fishing license when fishing at the park. The former towpath for the Miami and Erie Canal is open for hiking and biking. There are several picnic tables along the banks of the river.

In 2007 Candy Cane Lane celebrated its fiftieth anniversary and was honored with a parade and a proclamation by the mayor of the borough proclaiming the month of \\"December as Candy Cane Lane month forever more in DuBoistown\\". Location Duboistown is a borough in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania, which is about northwest of Philadelphia and east-northeast of Pittsburgh. Duboistown is between the West Branch Susquehanna River to the north and Bald Eagle Mountain to the south. The city of Williamsport lies to the north of Duboistown across the river, the borough of South Williamsport is east, and Armstrong Township is to the west and south. Summer Street runs north-south in Duboistown, with Winter Street to the west and Spring Street to the east. Summer Street is only two blocks long and the 200 block, between Euclid Avenue (which is also Pennsylvania Route 654) to the north and Highland Avenue to the south. The 200 block of Summer Street is the part of the street known as Candy Cane Lane. Fiftieth anniversary View looking up the west side of Candy Cane Lane in December 2009 Candy Cane Lane was first decorated for Christmas in 1957. On December 9, 2007, the borough of Duboistown celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of Candy Cane Lane with a parade and proclamation. The parade featured thirty units, including floats, fire and police vehicles, marching bands, local politicians and celebrities, and people dressed as elves, Dugout (the Little League Baseball mascot), Frosty the Snowman, Santa and Mrs. Claus. A celebration followed in the Duboistown Fire Hall. The 200 block of Summer Street has only thirteen houses on it: five on the west side and eight on the east. All of these house are heavily decorated for the holidays with lights and figures. The proclamation for the fiftieth anniversary of Candy Cane Lane specifically recognized six residents of Summer Street who have lived there the entire fifty years. Borough mayor Lou Plankenhorn‚Äôs proclamation officially declared the month of \\"December as Candy Cane Lane month forever more in DuBoistown\\". Candy Cane Lane is a popular destination for sightseers between Thanksgiving and Epiphany. On Christmas Eve traffic backs up on Euclid Avenue as people wait to drive up the street.

QUEEN was established to understand the processes involved in environmental changes in the Arctic region by studying past environmental changes during the Late Cenozoic era. A primary objective of QUEEN was to make the environmental record and the history of glaciation during the last 250,000 years as complete for Eurasia as elsewhere. Regions of particular importance for understanding the Arctic's role in global climate change are the Eurasian shelves and the land masses south of these, including Siberian permafrost. The ice sheets in these regions are key elements in paleoclimatic models and play a vital role in the reconstruction of a continuous paleoenvironmental record. Special effort was devoted to the correlation of records from different sources across the Arctic. The programme was running between 1996 and 2003 under the umbrella of the European Science Foundation (ESF) and was coordinated by Prof. Dr. J√∂rn Thiede.  Objectives  Sites on land and in the Arctic Ocean were sampled during the QUEEN project * Investigation of environmental changes in the Eurasian Arctic over the past 250,000 years, i.e., the last two climatic cycles. * Establish a record of palaeoenvironmental changes during this period on land, on continental shelves, and in the deep sea of the Arctic Ocean along the Eurasian continental margin. * Correlate terrestrial, shelf and deep ocean records by using a variety of stratigraphic tools and dating methods. * Reconstruct ice-sheet growth and decay over this period from geological and palaeontological evidence. * Predict how sensitively ice sheets respond to climate change through the glacial-interglacial cycles by numerical modeling. * Study relative changes in sea level to build a map of corresponding vertical movements of the underlying earth surface. * Investigate how the depth of permafrost has responded to climatic and environmental change. * Use high resolution radiocarbon-dating for the environmental record of the last glacial maximum and deglaciation (<30,000 yr BP).

As Chevalier reviews the stories from the campers, he gets a call from his publisher, rejecting his latest manuscript. Panicked, he picks up Benjamin's story, and it sparks his imagination. Chevalier changes Purvis' Bronco into Brutus, an extremely effeminate and comically flamboyant hero, changes the other character names and title, but otherwise leaves the story intact. His publisher loves it, and the novel is rushed into production under the title Brutus and Balzaak. Portions of Chevalier's version are now seen playing out alongside Benjamin's original vision of the story. At the local premiere of Donaho's version of Yeast Lords, Benjamin is nauseated to see how badly Donaho has adapted his work, and he abruptly leaves the film with Tabatha. They go to a bookstore where he discovers Chevalier's plagiarism after reading a paragraph from Brutus and Balzaak. He confronts Chevalier at a local book signing, and assaults him with some merchandise Chevalier had offered him in exchange for keeping his theft quiet. Two policeman hustle him out of the store and he is placed in jail. Judith comes to visit her son in jail to give him his birthday present. She hands him a box of manuscripts, all officially bound by the Writers Guild of America. She explains that she has been registering all his stories with them since he was seven years old, thinking they would make a nice keepsake for his children. Yeast Lords is one of the registered stories. Copies of Chevalier's novel are unceremoniously dumped from store shelves and replaced with Benjamin's original novel.

The deal called for Jared Hess to direct and Mike White, who co-wrote Nacho Libre with them, to produce. Hess brought Angarano onto the project based on his performance in the film Snow Angels, which also starred Rockwell. Filming began in March 2008 in Utah. Much of the film was shot in Tooele, Utah. In early August 2008, work on an Internet viral marketing began, which had a video introducing the character of Ronald Chevalier. A second video was released in October 2008. A trailer was released on August 19, 2009. Some of the artwork in the opening credits is by fantasy and science fiction artist David Lee Anderson. Release Gentlemen Broncos was intended to be released theatrically on October 30, 2009, but due to poor reviews the national release was pulled from theaters. Reception The film received mostly negative reviews and holds a 19% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 79 reviews by critics and the sites consensus reads: \\"Unselfconsciously juvenile and overwhelmingly quirky, Gentlemen Broncos offers a lot of potty humor but isn't terribly funny\\". Metacritic gave it a generally unfavorable 28 out of 100 based on 21 reviews. Roger Ebert gave the film 2 out of 4 stars, writing that while \\"Hess invents good characters\\" they quickly become lost in a disjointed and meandering story. However, Richard Brody, writing for The New Yorker, lauded the film, and he recently described Gentlemen Broncos as \\"a truly great film, with no asterisk whatsoever\\".

Atwater (Editor) - Greenwood Press (November 30, 1997) Griffin, noted for his genial demeanor, rose to the Speaker status in 1981‚Äîthe first speaker from western Missouri since 1955. He increased the number of committees from 36 to 45 and installed several chairmen from western Missouri and Kansas City, Missouri. Griffin would steer numerous projects to western Missouri including the Western Missouri Correctional Center in his hometown in Cameron (located on Pence Rd. on the edge of Cameron). In 1989 he was accused of steering business to his new Kansas City law firm of Kraft Fridkin and Ryhne. He was challenged for the Speaker position by St. Louis, Missouri Democrat Tony Ribaudo. Corruption charges In January 1992 after endorsing a 6 percent gasoline tax to improve the state highway system, Griffin was accused of meeting with members of the Heavy Constructors Association of Kansas City and the Associated General Contractors of Missouri at a Jefferson City, Missouri hotel where he told them they should hire Cathryn Simmons to lobby for the tax. The contactors paid Simmons $200,000, who reportedly paid Griffin $5,000. After the proposed tax passed the House, Simmons was said to have paid Griffin another $5,000. In August 1992 Simmons was working for Health Midwest when she asked Griffin to remove Bill Skaggs from a committee overseeing the proposed construction of a hospital in eastern Jackson County, Missouri which Health Midwest opposed. After Skaggs was removed and the hospital cancelled, Simmons was said to have paid Griffin $10,000. In 1993 Griffin was arrested on a DWI charge. After the Great Flood of 1993 Griffin pushed legislation to repair Missouri's roads. Griffin again pushed the construction companies to hire Simmons, this time for $90,000. Simmons then hired Griffin's son for $5,000. In March 1994 Griffin was alleged to receive a $21,000 check from Simmons. Griffin defended the payment by saying he was doing private law work for Simmons. In 1994 Griffin worked with Simmons to get Sahara Casino built in Parkville, Missouri which would require a referendum to be passed to allow slot machines. It was alleged Griffin was pushing for Simmons to receive a 20 percent stake in the casino with a secret 1 percent stake for Griffin. The casino was never built and The Kansas City Star published articles on Griffin's actions prompting state and federal prosecutors to review Griffin's activities. On January 26, 1996, Griffin tendered his resignation effective January 31, 1996. He was indicted on October 31, 1996 on six bribery violations, two mail fraud violations, and one violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.

Hablik, a member of the Deutscher K√ºnstlerbund, became best known, however, for his etchings and paintings and his links with major German Expressionist figures and movements, including the Arbeitsrat f√ºr Kunst and the Glass Chain. In 1909 Hablik published his Creative Forces (\\"Schaffende Kr√§fte\\"), \\"a portfolio of twenty etchings portraying a voyage through an imaginary universe of crystalline structures\\" that \\"represents the most significant accomplishment of his career.\\"Timothy O. Benson et al., Expressionist Utopias, Berkeley, University of California Press, 2001; p. 210. Hablik also published other portfolios of his etchings, The Sea (\\"Das Meer\\", 1918) and Architectural Cycle ‚Äî Utopia (\\"Cyklus Architektur ‚Äî Utopie,\\" 1925). Some of Hablik's designs, particularly of lamps and small sculptures, relate to and express the \\"utopian crystalline\\" forms of his etchings. \\"Sylt, Sonnenuntergang, D√ºnen\\" (\\"Sylt, Sunset, Dunes\\"), 1912 Hablik maintained a strong lifelong interest in crystals and geological forms generally. His visual art is notable for its highly imaginative and fanciful aspects; he created depictions of temples, flying cities, and crystal chasms.Benson et al., pp. 9, 36, 38, 40, 42, and ff.; 209‚Äì12. A catalogue in the artist's autograph lists some 600 artworks; about 250 oil paintings by Hablik are known at present. He produced portraits, landscapes, nude figures, and pictures showing Symbolist influences. A tour of South America in 1925‚Äì26 inspired him to create paintings of cactuses and flowers. Hablik died at Itzehoe in 1934. A Wenzel Hablik Museum was established in the city in 1995. The museum contains much of his art, as well as his collections of crystals and minerals, seashells and snails. Selected quotes Selected quotes from Hablik's Glass Chain letters:Eric D.

His realist style of painting captured the life of the typical Puerto Rican in the twentieth century. Early years Frade (birth name: Ram√≥n Frade de Le√≥n ) was born in the town of Cayey, Puerto Rico on May 12, 1875. His father died when he was just a child and his mother gave him up for adoption. He was adopted by Nemesio Laforja and his wife who were Spanish nationals. The Laforja family moved back to Spain and in 1885, immigrated and settled down in Santo Domingo the capital of the Dominican Republic. During his youth he traveled to Europe and studied art in Italy. He was also a pupil of the Dominican artist Luis Desangles. The subjects of his first paintings were the Roman ruins in Italy. From (1896 to 1902), Frade traveled to the Dominican Republic and Cuba where he painted scenes of the main colonial cities. Visual artist Frade painted portrayals of the life of the Puerto Rican campesinos (country people). What is considered as his masterwork, \\"El Pan Nuestro de Cada D√≠a\\" (Our Daily Bread) (1905), represents a \\"j√≠baro\\" farmer carrying plantains. In his painting he shows what is an old barefooted man who is poor but proud, serious, dignified, clean. This j√≠baro is supposed to represent Puerto Rico at the beginning of the century. Other works by Frade include: \\"La Planchadora\\" (The Ironing Lady) (1948), \\"El Ni√±o Campesino\\" (the country child), Ensenada, \\"La Poza\\", \\"Reverie\\", and \\"La Inmaculada\\" (The Immaculate) and many others.A Guide to the Island of Boriqu√©n, Federal Writers Project, 1940 Architect In 1907, Frade returned to his hometown Cayey and, unable to make a living from his paintings, decided to make use of his land-surveyor's degree which he had earned from the University of Sevilla through a mail correspondence course. During the early part of the 20th century there was a great demand for additional housing, infrastructures and tobacco warehouses in the towns of Caguas, Comer√≠o and Cayey. Inspired by the possibilities which the construction sector represented, Frade in 1909, decided to take a correspondence course in architecture in the American School of Correspondence in Chicago, Illinois. He earned his diploma on July 26, 1913, however he began to let it be known that he was an architect as early as 1912. Among Frade's works as an architect were the new design of Cayey's municipal cemetery, a plaza dedicated to Eugenio Mar√≠a de Hostos, the buildings of two tobacco companies and various buildings in the commercial section of the town. Legacy On November 7, 1954, Ram√≥n Frade died in his hometown at the age of 79 years. His widow donated his art works to the Cayey campus of the University of Puerto Rico. Cayey has honored his memory by naming a school and a public plaza after him. The R√≠o Piedras campus of the University of Puerto Rico has a gallery with an exhibit of Frade's art works.Galeria Universitaria See also *List of Puerto Ricans NotesReferences Category:1875 births Category:1954 deaths Category:People from Cayey, Puerto Rico Category:Puerto Rican painters Category:University of Seville alumni Category:Puerto Rican architects Category:20th-century American painters Category:American male painters ","title":"Ram√≥n Frade"},{"id":"20825885","text":"Janthina is a genus of small to medium-sized pelagic or planktonic sea snails, marine gastropod molluscs in the family Epitoniidae,.Gofas, S. (2011). Janthina R√∂ding, 1798. Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=138092 on 2011-11-01 In 2017 this genus has been transferred to Epitoniidae Beu A.G. (2017). Evolution of Janthina and Recluzia (Mollusca: Gastropoda: Epitoniidae). Records of the Australian Museum. 69(3): 119-222 Distribution Species in this genus occur worldwide in tropical, subtropical and warm seas. Description These snails are pelagic and live at the surface of the ocean. Adult snails may not be capable of swimming, and die when they are detached from their rafts; Janthina janthina larvae, however, actively swim in the water column. The adult snails prey upon (and live near to) one of several species of pelagic animals loosely known as jellyfish. More specifically they eat the medusae of free-swimming Cnidaria, in particular the genus known as \\"by-the-wind sailors\\", Velella. The snails are able to float securely because they create a raft of clear chitin around air bubbles formed near the ocean surface. They anchor to this raft using their foot. The snails do not have an operculum. These snails are frequently washed ashore during storms. The common names for this genus derive from the light purple or violet color of the shells and the violet-colored bodies. The other genus in the family, Recluzia, has olive-tan colored shells. Species This genus has accumulated a very large number of species names over the centuries. Most of the names that have been given are in fact synonyms of just a few species which have world-wide distributions in tropical waters. Experts disagree about some details of the synonymy.

Transportation Due to the peculiar local terrain‚Äîa series of parallel mountain ranges running in the SW to NE direction --, most roads in the area run in the valleys, also in the SW-NE direction. The G65 Baotou‚ÄìMaoming Expressway runs through Linshui County, but no railway does. The closest railway to Linshui, the Xiangyang‚ÄìChongqing line, runs west of these ranges, outside of the county's borders; the closest railway station, in Huaying, is almost away by road, and has very limited service.Schedule for Huaying Plans exist for a high speed railway (Dazhou- Chongqing Intercity Railway, ) that would run from Chongqing to Dazhou, roughly parallel to the older Xiangyang‚ÄìChongqing Railway. In early May 2015, Linshui people learned that the railway would be routed (i.e. the valley in which it will run) was to be via Guang'an, hometown of Deng Xiaoping. Tens of thousands of residents marched in protest and were met by violent attacks by local police, including a Special Police Unit team, with two people reported dead. A violent reaction followed and the confrontation lasted all day and well into the night with many police cars damaged.China: Massive Protest in Linshui Intense Repression and Resistance , Revolution News, Jennifer Baker, 15 Jun 2015Protesters in Southwest China Rally to Demand Railroad Link, By AUSTIN RAMZY MAY 18, 2015 ClimateNotes Category:County-level divisions of Sichuan ","title":"Linshui County"},{"id":"20825902","text":"Raymond Arthur Flanigan (January 8, 1923 ‚Äì March 28, 1993) was an American professional baseball player, a right-handed pitcher who appeared in three games in Major League Baseball for the Cleveland Indians at the tail end of the 1946 season.

The species is endemic to Australia. Common names Common names for Morethia boulengeri include south-eastern Morethia skink, Boulenger's snake-eyed skink,Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Morethia boulengeri, p. 33). Boulenger's Morethia, and Boulenger's skink.OzAnimals.com. Etymology The specific name, boulengeri, as well as three of the common names for this skink, are in honour of George Albert Boulenger, a Belgian-born British herpetologist who described a wide range of reptile, amphibian, and fish species new to science. Description The markings and colouration of M. boulengeri can vary significantly between individuals. In general, it is grey or brown in colour with darker-coloured flecks in a longitudinal pattern along the dorsal side of the lizard, while the ventral side is largely white. A thin white stripe also runs longitudinally from the mouth to the groin region on both lateral sides. Above the white line is a thicker black stripe that borders the white stripes.Cogger H (2014). Reptiles and Amphibians of Australia. Collingwood: CSIRO Publishing. Seventh Edition. p:660-661. Juvenile lizards also have a distinctive red- orange tinge on the ventral side of the tail, which is a distinguishing feature of the genus Morethia. Boulenger's skink can grow to a total length (including tail) of; however, on average they reach only nose to tail tip, or snout to vent.Rayner I (2007). \\"Morethia boulengeri \\". This species of skink also exhibits square-shaped supraciliary scales above the eye region. Geographic range and ecology M. boulengeri is endemic to Australia and can be found across the majority of the country, in every state and territory except Tasmania. It is a generalist species that has the ability to inhabit a wide range of environments in semi-arid and arid zones. It survives in the leaf litter and dead fallen vegetation in dry sclerophyll forests, mallee, desert, scrublands, woodlands, and low shrublands ecosystems. It is found in high numbers in the Murray catchment area, in southern New South Wales. Sometimes the density of M. boulengeri is as high as several hundred individuals in one hectare of land.Michael D, Lindenmayer D (2010). Reptiles of the NSW Murray Catchment: A Guide to Their Identification, Ecology & Conservation. Collingwood: CSIRO Publishing. p:154. Diet M. boulengeri is an insectivorous species, like the majority of skinks, which means the diet of this species consist almost exclusively of insects. It eats predominately arthropod species and snails, with moths making up a large portion of its diet.Hoser R (1989). Australian Reptiles & Frogs. Mosman: Pierson & Co. p. 105. Spiders, beetles, ants, cockroaches, and other bugs are also a part of the diet. All of these prey species are abundant within Australia and in the leaf litter habitat that M. boulengeri occupies. Reproduction M. boulengeri mates in the warmer months in spring and summer.Smyth M (1974). \\"Changes in the fat scores of the skinks Morethia boulengeri and Hemiergis peronii (Lacertilia)\\". Australian J. Zool. 22 (2): 135-145. During this time the throat of the male skink turns vibrant orange in correspondence with testicle size, indicating to the female that the male is fertile and available for mating.Smyth M (1974). \\"Aspects of the Natural History of Three Australian Skinks, Morethia boulengeri, Menetia greyii and Lerista bougainvillii \\". Journal of Herpetology 8 (4): 329-335. This species of skink is oviparous which is a method of reproduction in which the female lays eggs. A female M. boulengeri generally reaches sexual maturity and begins breeding within the first year of life. On average, 3 eggs are laid per clutch, and a female produces approximately 3 clutches per year.Henle K (1989). \\"Population Ecology and Life History of the Diurnal Skink Morethia boulengeri in Arid Australia\\". Oecologia 78 (4): 521-532. . The clutch is incubated for approximately 60 days before the eggs hatch. During this time the rate of oxygen consumption dramatically increases.Thompson M, Russell K (1999). \\"Embryonic Energetics in Eggs of Two Species of Australian Skink, Morethia boulengeri and Morethia adelaidensis \\".

The 2003 Canberra bushfires were also particularly severe. The developing drought in Australia and well below-average rainfall through winter and spring of 2002 established conditions conducive to above-average bushfire potential. During the 2002‚Äì03 season, there were 5,999 bushfires attended by the relevant agency Australia-wide and 7 fatalities, 4 of those from the January Canberra fires. Perhaps the most well known fire of the season was the Eastern Victorian alpine bushfires that burnt in north-eastern Victoria, the Victorian Alps and Gippsland. This fire was ignited in several locations by multiple lightning strikes and burnt 1.12 million hectares of land over the course of 2 months. Over 15,000 personnel were directly engaged with this fire complex. Overview While hundreds or thousands of individual fires burn in any given bushfire season, areas of large fires that join and split are referred to as 'fire complexes'. The major fire complexes included: *Big Desert Fire (17‚Äì25 December) *Yambulla Fire (6‚Äì11 January) *Eastern Victorian alpine bushfires (8 January ‚Äì 7 March) *Canberra bushfires (8 January ‚Äì 14 February) According to the ABS, in their 1301.0 - Year Book Australia, 2004, between 664 and 646 houses were destroyed and 13427 to 14427 stock lost in the 2002-03 bushfire season. Timeline Anglers Rest, East Gippsland, one of the worst hit areas Regrowth on the Bogong High Plains, two years after the 2003 Great Divide Fire Complex =September‚ÄìNovember 2002= The first fires of the 2002‚Äì03 season were reported in September 2002 in Victoria. Ongoing drought and lack of spring rain led to the Bureau of Meteorology predicting conditions comparable to that of the 1983 Ash Wednesday fires, and Fire Authorities were subsequently placed on high alert. =December 2002= On 17 December, multiple lightning strikes in the Big Desert Wilderness Park ignited vegetation, creating a fire complex within the park south of Murrayville and burning until 25 December. The Big Desert Fire was, at the time, the biggest fire in Victoria in 20 years, affecting 181,400 hectares of predominantly public land and requiring significant resources to contain. =January‚ÄìMarch 2003= Satellite image of South-eastern Australia, showing the Eastern Victorian alpine fires on 22 January 2003 On 6 January, lightning ignited a fire near Yambulla, north west of Genoa in East Gippsland. The fire was seen as posing a major threat, requiring significant firefighting resources. At the time the main fires started on 8 January, a total of 180 DSE firefighters were allocated to the Yambulla fire, supported by bulldozers and firebombing aircraft. The fire was contained within a few days. This level of resourcing did, however, decrease the local resources available to fight the multiple outbreaks that followed. On 7 January, multiple lightning strikes in north- east Victoria and Gippsland started hundreds of fires in Victoria that would remain uncontained until 7 March, a full 2 months later. In early February, at the peak of the fires, around 3,760 people were involved in the fire effort, excluding local CFA brigades. This figure includes 160 Defence Force staff, over 300 interstate firefighters, 33 alpine firefighting specialists from New Zealand, and 35 personnel from the United States. In total, 15,725 personnel were directly engaged on the Eastern Victorian alpine bushfires. Aftermath Big River, north of Anglers Rest in East Gippsland In October 2003, the DSE published a report on the 2002‚Äì03 fires, which was considered a formidable task as it had to document over 3,000 separate fires and all the effects and personnel involved. The report concluded that the responses and containment of the fires was commendable. No lives were lost, and stock losses and property damage was kept to a minimum considering the area of land affected by the fires.

A member of Fanmi Lavalas, he was arrested by armed rebels on March 1, 2004 \\\\- the day after the controversial Haitian President, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, fled into exile which was triggered by both a popular and an armed uprising. Mr. Dauphin has spent the ensuing years in a Haitian prison without having been convicted of any crime. Prior to his arrest, Ronald Dauphin A.K.A \\"Black\\" or Black Ronald, had been working several security and disposal jobs for the Lavalas party. He had also been the main securuty chief for the Mayor of Saint-Marc in the time prior to his government contract work. While incarcerated, his father was burned alive in his house by people seeking revenge on Ronald. He was also diagnosed with tuberculosis, due to the poor and overcrowded prison system in Haiti. Legal background Ronald Dauphin is the last detainee held for the so-called La Scierie massacre, that Lavalas opponents claimed happened in the city of St. Marc, Haiti in February, 2004. Other La Scierie defendants were former Haitian Prime Minister Yvon Neptune and former Minister of the Interior Jocelerme Privert. No one has been convicted, or even tried in connection with the La Scierie incident. Most defendants have had their charges dismissed. Louis Joinet, the United Nations Commission on Human Right's Independent Expert on Haiti, concluded after investigation that there was no \\"massacre\\" at La Scierie, but instead a clash between two armed groups. International support for justice for Ronald Dauphin On August 7, 2009 Amnesty International issued an Appeals Case for Dauphin. On June 10, 2009, U.S. Representative Maxine Waters wrote two letters, one to Haitian Prime Minister Michele Pierre-Louis,the other to U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, urging both to act to ensure justice for Ronald Dauphin. On December 2, 2008, 51 U.S.-based human rights organizations wrote to President Ren√© Pr√©val asking for justice for Ronald Dauphin. Human rights organizations urge release of Haiti's political prisoners In August 2006, Amnesty International called on Haiti's government to promptly bring to trial or release all political prisoners, condemning the prolonged detention of Lavalas activists as politically motivated. In October 2006, the National Lawyers Guild urged the Haitian government to release the remaining political prisoners, with particular emphasis on the defendants held in the La Scierie case. On December 14, 2008, the International Association of Democratic Lawyers(IADL) unanimously passed a Resolution calling for an end to Mr. Dauphin's persecution. In May 2008, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IACHR) ruled that the State of Haiti had violated the human rights of former Prime Minister Yvon Neptune, another defendant in the La Scierie case, by holding him without trial for over two years with no proof he committed a crime. While Mr. Neptune was provisionally released, as was another defendant, Amanus Maette - Ronald Dauphin remains in prison. Prison situation in Haiti The IACHR declared conditions in Haiti's overcrowded prisons inhumane. Numerous human rights reports document that prisoners are dying inside the sweltering, overcrowded 3800-person National Penitentiary in the country's capital, Port- au-Prince. They suffer dehydration and disease from filthy water, and Beri beri from starvation rations. Cell \\"blocks\\" built to hold five or six people are packed with up to 70 and 80 bodies at a time; prisoners take shifts sleeping and standing. Without adequate food, clean water, sanitation and medical attention, Dauphin's detention amounts to a death sentence, particularly because he is in ill health. His wife brings him food and medicine when she is able. But the cost of food is high, and the price of gas makes even getting to the prison a challenge. So Dauphin doesn't get to see his wife very often.Minimally, Dauphin says he should be offered medical release to have his undiagnosed symptoms treated by specialists. There is a prison dispensary \\"but conditions in the dispensary are not good. Every month since I've been here, someone has died in the dispensary,\\" he says. His co- defendant, Wantales Lormejuste, died in 2007 from untreated tuberculosis contracted inside prison. As bad as he feels for himself, Dauphin says his wife's situation is worse. \\"I can't tell you how much she feels alone\\", he said. \\"God is with her. It's like she is in jail. One day this will end. I will keep praying. There is hope that one day I will be free.\\"  References  External links  *Background paper on Ronald Dauphin by lawyers Mario Joseph and Brian Concannon Category:Living people Category:Haitian prisoners and detainees Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Ronald Dauphin"},{"id":"20826054","text":"St. Nicholas' Priory (Danish: Sankt Nikolai Kloster) was a Benedictine nunnery founded in 1170 in Ribe, Denmark.  History  The foundation of St. Nicholas' Priory in Ribe was the result of events at Seem Abbey, a Benedictine double monastery established by the Bishops of Ribe in the first third of the 12th century. After allegations of unruliness and impropriety during the 1160s the nuns were moved out in 1170 to a new priory built for them by Bishop Ralph, closer to Ribe and episcopal supervision.the monks initially remained at Seem and were put under the charge of the then new and austere Cistercians, but in 1173 they gave up the site and moved on to L√∏gum Abbey The new priory at Ribe, dedicated to Saint Nicholas, consisted of a quadrilateral enclosure, of which the church formed one side and ranges of conventual buildings the other three. The prioress ran the community, while a local nobleman held the office of provost (or honorary prior) and represented the nuns in secular matters. Mass was said by a local priest. The church was open to the people of Ribe, but the nuns were separated from them by iron gates around the choir. By the reign of Christian II (1513‚Äì23) the reputation of the nuns of Ribe for immorality was notorious, to the extent that they were used as a stock example of debauchery by early Danish Lutheran preachers: Thomas Lillelund, for example, accused them of institutionalized whoring (Danish: horeri). When Christian's successor, Frederik II, refused to protect them, the nuns were driven from the priory by the citizens of Ribe. Denmark became officially Lutheran in 1536 and all religious houses and their income properties reverted to the crown. The former priory was reopened as a secular institution where a few of the nuns were allowed to live until 1560, when the citizens of Ribe complained about the cost of maintaining all ten churches and four monasteries and the leper hospital. With the agreement of the crown, the church of Ribe Abbey, now St. Catherine's Church, was made the parish church of Ribe, and the medieval Ribe Cathedral was confirmed as the seat of the Lutheran Diocese of Ribe, but the rest of the churches and religious houses, including St. Nicholas' Priory, were demolished and the materials used for other buildings.

In 1934, at the age of 18, Graham joined the National Guard, a reserve component of the United States Army, and served in Europe during World War II. In 1945, he attained the rank of Lt. Colonel and served in the Korean War in 1952. For his military services he received Bronze Star Medals and a Legion of Merit.New York Times Obituary, March 26, 1999, page A21 He also served as Adjutant General for the State of Alabama from 1959 to 1961. In 1961, Graham was promoted to the rank of Brigadier General. General Graham had several prominent roles in the American civil rights movement. In 1961, General Graham led the Alabama National Guard to protect the Freedom Riders from mob violence. On the evening of May 21, 1961, Freedom Riders and their supporters met at Ralph Abernathy's First Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama to honor their struggle. Martin Luther King Jr. also flew in to offer support. As white mobs gathered outside the church and became increasingly agitated, the Kennedy Administration and Alabama Governor John Malcolm Patterson agreed to employ Alabama National Guard troops to surround the church for safety. At the request of King, General Graham entered the church to inform the crowd that they would have to wait until the next morning to leave the church.Freedom Riders: 1961 and the Struggle for Racial Justice, Raymond Arsenault, page 239 At dawn, Graham arranged for the members of the crowd to be escorted to their homes. Two days later, on May 24, Graham was responsible for escorting the Freedom Riders from the Montgomery bus terminal to the Alabama-Mississippi border using a convoy of three planes, two helicopters, and seventeen highway patrol cars.Nobody But the People, Warren Trest, page 343Freedom Riders: 1961 and the Struggle for Racial Justice, Raymond Arsenault, page 261-262 thumb In his most prominent role, on June 11, 1963, General Graham confronted Governor George Wallace at the University of Alabama for refusing to allow two black students, James Hood and Vivian Malone, to register for classes. Among a crowd of media, Governor Wallace obstructed the doorway of Foster Auditorium in an attempt to disregard federal law requiring the University to integrate. United States Deputy Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach had approached Wallace earlier in the day and requested his cooperation in standing aside. When Wallace refused, President Kennedy mobilized the Alabama National Guard and General Graham was called to the University. Graham approached Wallace with four sergeants, saluted Wallace and said \\"Sir, it is my sad duty to ask you to step aside under the orders of the President of the United States.\\"Carry Me Home: Birmingham, Alabama: The Climactic Battle of the Civil Rights Revolution, Diane McWhorter, page 462 The episode is known as the \\"Stand in the Schoolhouse Door.\\"The Schoolhouse Door: Segregation's Last Stand at the University of Alabama, E.

Summary of military career Graham served in the National Guard from 1934 until his retirement in 1976 with the rank of Major General. He was called to active duty for federal service during World War II and the Korean War, with the following dates of rank. * Enlisted service: 27 March 1934 ‚Äì 14 September 1940 **Private: 25 March 1934 **Corporal: 24 March 1937 **Sergeant: 23 April 1937 **First Sergeant: 27 May 1940 * Second Lieutenant: 15 September 1940 (National Guard) / 25 November 1940 (Army of the United States) * First Lieutenant (Army of the United States): 28 January 1942 * Captain (Army of the United States): 17 September 1942 * Major (Army of the United States): 24 March 1943 * Lieutenant Colonel: 16 September 1945 (Army of the United States) / 28 October 1945 (Officer Reserve Corps) / 17 December 1946 (National Guard) * Colonel (National Guard): 1 April 1953 * Major General (National Guard): 21 April 1959 [Promotion to Brigadier General retroactively applied 15 September 1961] Due to the service component intricacies of the National Guard versus federalized status, while a Major General in the National Guard, Graham was twice appointed as Brigadier General in the Army of the United States in order to perform federalized duties under the authority of the President of the United States. The first occurrence was on June 11, 1963, and again on September 13, 1963; both events were in connection with federalization due to civil rights tensions in Alabama. On March 13, 1970, while still serving as a Major General and National Guard Adjutant General, Henry Graham accepted a \\"dual commission\\" as a Chief Warrant Officer in the National Guard, solely for the purposes of performing flight operations as pilot of a McDonnell F-101 Voodoo. This unusual administrative move was to enable General Graham, who did not hold the proper military occupational specialty to serve as a pilot, and to perform flight training and duties as a Warrant Officer. In theory, General Graham was technically resigned from his general officer's commission each time he flew, was a Warrant Officer in the air, and then reinstated as a Major General when the flight mission concluded. In practice, however, General Graham maintained his rank and insignia at all times. =Awards and decorations= * Legion of Merit * Bronze Star Medal (w/1 bronze oak leaf cluster) * American Defense Service Medal * American Campaign Medal * European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal (w/4 bronze service stars & arrowhead device) * Army of Occupation Medal * World War II Victory Medal * Korean Service Medal * National Defense Service Medal * United Nations Service Medal * Korean War Service Medal (retroactive) * Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation (retroactive) * Army Aviator Badge * Parachutist Badge * Expert Badge (with Pistol Bar)  References  External links  *The Schoolhouse Door: Segregation's Last Stand at the University of Alabama *Crisis: Behind a Presidential Commitment *Original Footage: The Struggle for School Integration (at 7min 45sec) *Original Footage: 25 Years Since Racial Integration *Video of General Graham Approaching Governor Wallace * Category:1916 births Category:1999 deaths Category:Military personnel from Birmingham, Alabama Category:United States Army generals Category:National Guard of the United States generals Category:American army personnel of World War II Category:Recipients of the Legion of Merit Category:Alabama National Guard personnel Category:American real estate businesspeople ","title":"Henry V.

More specifically, this species is located in the tropical and subtropical Atlantic, Indian and Pacific oceans. This information was obtained through an academic study of the differences between the different species within this genus.They are often found in large groups and sometimes become stranded on beaches when they are blown ashore by strong winds. These snails are a unique part of the pleuston, organisms living on or at the very surface of the water, because of their relatively large size. They have veliger or free swimming larvae, but the adults do not swim and cannot create their rafts except at the surface where air bubbles are available. Habitat These snails are pelagic, drifting on the surface of the ocean, where they feed upon pelagic hydrozoans, especially the by-the-wind sailor Velella velella and the Portuguese man o' war Physalia physalis. Description J. janthina is a member of the family Janthinidae, snails that trap air bubbles with a layer of clear chitin to maintain their positions at the surface of the ocean where they are predatious on the hydrozoans.Powell A. W. B., New Zealand Mollusca, William Collins Publishers Ltd, Auckland, New Zealand 1979 . In addition to the bubble raft, only the veliger, or larval stage, has an operculum, and the shell is paper-thin to allow the animal to float upside down at the surface. Five views of a shell of Janthina janthina The snail's shell is reverse countershaded, because of its upside-down position in the water column. There is a light purple shade on the spire of the shell, and a darker purple on the ventral side. The animal has a large head on a very flexible neck. The eyes are small and are situated at the base of its tentacles. The snail begins life as a male and later changes to the female of the species. The eggs are held by the female until they develop into a larval form. The shell is almost smooth with a slightly depressed- globose shape. It is thin and delicate, and is without an operculum. The colour of the shell is violet, with a paler upper surface. The height of the species shell is up to 38 mm, the width to 40 mm.

Nageshvara is one of the temples mentioned in the Shiva Purana and is one of the twelve Jyotirlingas. Jyotirlinga According to Shiv Mahapuraan, Brahma (The Creator) and Vishnu (The Preserver) once had a disagreement about which of them was supreme. To test them, Shiva pierced the three worlds as an immeasurable pillar of light, the Jyotirlinga. Vishnu and Brahma parted company to determine the extent of each end of the pillar. Brahma, who had set off upward, lied that he had discovered the upper end of the pillar, but Vishnu, who had gone in the direction of the base of the pillar, admitted that he had not. Shiva then appeared as a second Jyotirlinga and cursed Brahma, telling him that he would have no place in the ceremonies, though Vishnu would be worshipped until the 'end of eternity'. The Jyotirlinga is the supreme indivisible reality from which Shiva appears. Jyothirlinga shrines commemorate this time when Shiva appeared. It was believed that there were originally sixty-four jyotirlingas. Twelve are considered to be especially auspicious and holy. Each of the twelve sites takes the name of the presiding deity and each is considered a separate manifestation of Shiva. At all these sites, the primary deity is a lingam representing the beginning less and endless Stambha pillar, symbolizing the Shiva's infinite nature.Vivekananda Vol. 4 The twelve jyothirlinga are Somnath in Gujarat, Mallikarjuna at Srisailam in Andhra Pradesh, Mahakaleswar at Ujjain in Madhya Pradesh, Omkareshwar in Madhya Pradesh, Kedarnath in Himalayas, Bhimashankar in Maharashtra, Viswanath at Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh, Triambakeshwar in Maharashtra, Vaidyanath at Deoghar in Jharkhand, Aundha Nagnath temple in Maharashtra, Rameshwar at Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu and Grishneshwar at Aurangabad in Maharashtra. Bhimashankar jyotirlinga is also thought to be in Assam. According to Shivpuran, Bhima the son of Kumbhakarna had imprisoned Kamrupeshwar. The ancient name of Assam is Kamrup. So the king of Kamrup was called Kamrupeahwar. This jyotirlinga is situated in a forest called Dakini van or Dakini pahar, in the outskirts of present day Guwahati. Legend The Shiva Purana says Nageshvara Jyotirlinga is in 'the Darukavana', which is an ancient name of a forest in India. 'Darukavana' finds mention in Indian epics, such as Kamyakavana, Dvaitavana, Dandakavana. A narrative in the Shiva Purana about the Nageshvara Jyotirlinga tells of a demon named Daruk, who attacked a Shiva devotee named Supriya and imprisoned him along with many others in his city of Darukavana, a city under the sea inhabited by sea snakes and demons. At the urgent exhortations of Supriya, the prisoners started to chant the holy mantra of Shiva and immediately thereafter Lord Shiva appeared and the demon was vanquished, later residing there in the form of a Jyotirlinga. The demon had a wife, a demoness named Daruka who worshipped Mata Parvati. As a result of her penance and devotion, Mata Parvati enabled her to master the forest where she performed her devotions, and renamed the forest 'Darukavana' in her honour. Wherever Daruka went the forest followed her. In order to save the demons of Darukavana from the punishment of the gods, Daruk summoned up the power Parvati had given her. She then moved the entire forest into the sea where they continued their campaign against the hermits, kidnapping people and keeping them confined in their new lair under the sea, which was how that great Shiva devotee, Supriya, had wound up there. The arrival of Supriya caused a revolution. He set up a lingam and made the prisoners recite the mantra Om Namaha Shivay in honour of Shiva while he prayed to the lingam. The demons' response to the chanting was to attempt to kill Supriya, though they were thwarted when Shiva appeared and handed him a divine weapon that saved his life. Daruka and the demons were defeated and Parvati saved the remaining demons. The lingam that Supriya had set up was called Nagesha; it is the tenth lingam. Shiva once again assumed the form of a Jyotirlinga with the name Nageshwar, while the Goddess Parvati was known as Nageshwari. Lord Shiva then announced that he would show the correct path to those who would worship him. Location controversy The actual location of the legendary forest of Darukavana is debated. No other important clues indicate the location of the Jyotirlinga. 'Darukavana' remains the only clue. The name Darukavana, is derived from daruvana (forest of deodar trees), is thought to exist in Almora. Deodar (daru vriksha) is found abundantly only in the western Himalayas, not in peninsular India. Deodar trees have been associated with Lord Shiva in ancient Hindu texts. Hindu sages used to reside and perform meditation in deodar forests to please Lord Shiva. Also, according to the ancient treatise Prasadmandanam, > \\"‡§π‡§ø‡§Æ‡§æ‡§¶‡•ç‡§∞‡•á‡§∞‡•Ç‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡§∞‡•á ‡§™‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§∂‡•ç‡§µ‡•á ‡§¶‡•á‡§µ‡§¶‡§æ‡§∞‡•Ç‡§µ‡§®‡§Ç ‡§™‡§∞‡§Æ‡•ç ‡§™‡§æ‡§µ‡§®‡§Ç ‡§∂‡§Ç‡§ï‡§∞‡§∏‡•ç‡§•‡§æ‡§®‡§Ç ‡§§‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡•ç ‡§∏‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡•á > ‡§∂‡§ø‡§µ‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§ö‡§ø‡§§‡§æ‡§É‡•§\\" Because of this the 'Jageswara' temple in Almora, Uttarakhand is commonly identified as Nageshvara Jyotirlinga. The written name of Darukavana could be misread as 'Dwarakavana' which would point to the Nageswara temple at Dwaraka. However, no forest is in this part of Dwaraka that finds mention in any of the Indian epics. The narratives of Shri Krishna, mention Somanatha and the adjoining Prabhasa tirtha, but not Nageswara or Darukavana in Dwaraka. Darukavana might exist next to the Vindhya Mountains. It is south-southwest of the Vindhyas extending to the sea in the west. In the Dvadasha Jyotirlinga Stotra (6),Dvadasha Jyotirlinga Stotra Shankaracharya praised this Jyotirlinga as Naganath: > \\"Yamye sadange nagaretiramye vibhushitangam vividhaishcha bhogai > Sadbhaktimuktipradamishamekam shrinaganatham sharanam prapadye\\" This could be taken to mean that it is located in the south ['yamye'] at the town of 'Sadanga', which was the ancient name of Aundh in Maharashtra, south of the Jageswara shrine in Uttarakhand and west of Dwaraka Nageshvara.

The company performs Custom LASIK, PRK and monovision treatment to correct nearsightedness, farsightedness, astigmatism and reduce the effects of presbyopia. According to the company, one million laser vision correction procedures have been performed at its LasikPlus vision centers since 1991.istockanalyst.com Background Laser Centers of America, Inc., LCA-Vision's corporate predecessor, was incorporated in 1985. The company served as a professional management firm assisting hospitals and medical centers throughout the United States in managing their laser and minimally invasive surgery programs. In 1991, shortly after the first laser to perform laser vision correction procedures in Canada was approved, LCA-Vision began applying its laser operating capability to the field of refractive eye surgery, particularly to Photorefractive Keratectomy (PRK), a procedure in which lasers are used to correct nearsightedness and other eye conditions. In 1995, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved PRK technology in the United States. In December 1995, LCA-Vision opened its first Laser Vision Correction center in the United States at its corporate headquarters in Cincinnati. Founded and chaired by Stephen Joffe, Joffe was a practicing general surgeon and tenured, full professor at the University of Cincinnati Academic Health Center. An early advocate of applying laser technology in medical disciplines, he founded a laser technology device company and later, a laser surgery management business with hospitals and medical centers throughout the U.S. In January 1996, shares of LCA-Vision common stock began trading on the Nasdaq SmallCap Market under the symbol LCAV. By the end of the century, LCA-Vision was the third largest publicly held vision correction company in the United States, with 21 locations in the United States and two in Canada. The company also continued to provide laser and minimally invasive surgery programs for hospitals and medical centers. In 1997, the FDA approved the technology for a more advanced outpatient procedure for laser vision correction, Laser in-situ keratomileusis (LASIK), to treat nearsightedness, also using an excimer laser. Within one year of its FDA approval, PRK became less and less popular following the development of LASIK, a procedure that allowed patients to have their vision corrected without the need for extended recovery from surgery. In August 1997, LCA-Vision completed its first major acquisition through the purchase of Summit Technology's laser vision correction centers, Refractive Centers International, Inc. (RCII). In July 1999, LCA-Vision introduced the \\"LasikPlus\\" name at its laser vision correction center in Baltimore, Maryland. LCA-V Partnerships On December 9, 2009 LasikPlus announced its partnership with the Wounded Warrior Project to provide free LasikPlus corrective vision surgery to U.S. military veterans and their spouses/caregivers across the nation. These procedures were organized through a partnership among LasikPlus, Wounded Warrior Project and Fisher House Foundation. To date, the partnership has provided more than 70 warriors and seven caregivers with free LasikPlus laser vision correction across the country.

He published his memoirs in Welsh and English in the 1980s. Biography Frank Evans was born in 1917 in Llanwnnen, Lampeter in Wales. He was dispatched to the Crown Colony of Hong Kong as a member of the British Army (Royal Army Pay Corps) in 1941. As a result of the Battle of Hong Kong in December 1941, he was captured by the Japanese Army and interned at the Sham Shui Po and Argyle Street POW camps in Hong Kong and later transferred to the Oeyama POW Camp, Iwataki Town, Yoza-gun, Kyoto Prefecture where he was forced to work in the open-pit nickel mine in Kaya and the smelting factory in Iwataki together with nearly 700 POW's from countries such as the UK, Canada, Australia and the USA. The POW's were released from the camp in September 1945 after the defeat of Japan in the Pacific War and Frank Evans returned to Wales in November. Nearly ten per cent of the POW's in the Oeyama camp had died of malnutrition, hard labour and torture when the war was over. He privately published his memoirs in Welsh in 1981 and later in English in 1985 with the title Roll Call at Oeyama, P.O.W. Remembers. Evans visited the former Oeyama POW camp site for the first time since the end of World War II in 1984 and had a memorial for his comrades erected at the former nickel mine site with cooperation from the Town of Kaya (now a part of Town of Yosano) and Nippon Yakin Company Ltd. This visit and the 1985 visit by Mayor Takuichi Hosoi of Kaya to Aberystwyth enabled the two municipalities to establish exchange programs for their respective high school students and citizens. Evans died in Aberystwyth in 1996. Roll Call at Oeyama, P.O.W. Remembers The English version of Evans' memoirs, Roll Call at Oeyama, P.O.W. Remembers , is known as one of the important accounts of POW's experience in Hong Kong and Japan. It is also quite unique as it combines his memories from World War II and the process of post-war reconciliation between his former enemies and himself as a result of his 1984 visit to Japan. It is quoted in Long Night's Journey into Day by Dr. Charles G. Roland (Wilfrid Laurier University Press, 2001) and in We shall Suffer There by Tony Banham (Hong Kong University Press, March 2009). It is also quoted in an English language textbook in Japan for senior high school students by the Kairyudo Press and in Amerika Kokka Hangyaku-zai (A Case of Treason in the (Post-War) USA) in Japanese by Tetsuro Shimojima (Kodansha Press, Tokyo, 1993).

In 1937, Max Eckardt established Shiny Brite ornaments, working with the Corning Glass company to mass-produce glass Christmas ornaments. Eckardt had been importing hand-blown glass balls from Germany since around 1907, but had the foresight to anticipate a disruption in his supply from the upcoming war. Corning adapted their process for making light bulbs to making clear glass ornaments, which were then shipped to Eckardt's factories to be decorated by hand. The fact that Shiny Brite ornaments were an American-made product was stressed as a selling point during World War II. Dating of the ornaments is often facilitated by studying the hook. The first Shiny Brite ornaments had the traditional metal cap and loop, with the hook attached to the loop, from which the ornament was hung from the tree. Wartime production necessitated the replacement of the metal cap with a cardboard tab, from which the owner would use yarn or string to hang the ornament. These hangers firmly place the date of manufacture of the ornament to the early 1940s. Following the war, Shiny Brite introduced a line of ornaments with a newly designed metal hook that provided the user with two lengths of hanger. The long hook traveled through the center of the ornament and exited the bottom, where it attached to the foot of the ornament. This provided the \\"short\\" hanger. Unlatched from the bottom, the entire length of the hook was available, allowing the ornament to dangle at a greater distance from the tree limb to which it was attached. This arrangement was designed to allow the ornament to fill sparsely limbed areas of a natural tree. The increasing popularity of the aluminum artificial Christmas tree, first manufactured in 1958, made this device far less attractive to the consumer, as an artificial tree had no gaps to be filled. The added expense of the lengthy hanging wire coupled with the diminishing need caused this feature to be discontinued in 1960. Shiny Brite ornaments were first manufactured at Corning's plant in Wellsboro, Pennsylvania, and continued there for many decades.https://pawilds.com/wellsboro-the-town-that-saved-christmas/ During its peak, Shiny Brite also had factories in New Jersey, located in the cities of Hoboken, Irvington, North Bergen, and West New York. The company's main office and showroom were located at 45 East 17th Street in New York city. Shiny Brite's most popular ornaments have been reissued under the same trademark by Christopher Radko since 2001.

Gregory expanded and modernized the church and its institutionsDick (2004), pp. 38‚Äì39 and participated in the First Vatican Council, where he championed the rights of the Eastern Catholic Churches. Gregory is remembered as a particularly dynamic patriarch of the Melkite Church. He is recognized as one of the forerunners of interconfessional dialogue and as an advocate for preserving the traditions and autonomy of the Melkites. Early life, priesthood and episcopate Hanna Youssef-Sayour was born October 17, 1823, at Rosetta, near Alexandria, Egypt. In 1840, at age 16, he entered the Basilian Salvatorian Order. In 1844, he began to study in the Jesuit seminary of Kesrouane in Mount Lebanon. From 1847 to 1856 Youssef studied philosophy and theology in the Pontifical Greek College of Saint Athanasius in Rome, where he was ordained priest on June 11, 1854. Back in the Middle East, he was chosen by the newly elected patriarch Clement Bahouth as successor for the See of Acre and Galilee. He received the episcopal consecration on November 13, 1856, by patriarch Clement Bahouth. During his episcopate Youssef faced three major issues: discontent within the Melkite Church for the introduction of the Gregorian Calendar by Clement Bahouth, a short-lived schism supported by the Russian Orthodox Church on the basis of the newly introduced Gregorian Calendar, and division between the Basilians monks. Youssef remained strictly neutral on the calendar, but fiercely fought the schism. Patriarchate The conflicts in the Melkite church escalated and in 1864 Clement Bahouth asked the church leadership in Rome to abdicate his position as patriarch and elect Youssef as his successor. Rome authorized the resignation, and a synod of bishops was convened for September 24, 1864. At the opening of the synod Clement Bahouth announced his resignation, and the synod elected Youssef as patriarch on September 29, 1864. Youssef took the name Gregory and was confirmed by Pope Pius IX on March 27, 1865. Once elected, patriarch Gregory worked to restore peace in the religious community and successfully healed the schism. He also focused on improving church institutions and founded the Patriarchal College in Beirut in 1865 and the Patriarchal College in Damascus in 1875, and re-opened the Melkite seminary of Ain Traz in 1866.Dick (2004), p. 38 Gregory promoted the establishment of Saint Ann's Seminary (Jerusalem) by the White Fathers in 1882 for the training of Melkite clergy. Following the Hatti Humayyouni decree by Sultan Abdul Majid in 1856 the life of Christians in the Near East improved. This allowed Gregory to successfully encourage greater participation by the Melkite laity in both church administration and public affairs. Gregory also took an interest in ministering to the growing number of Melkites who had emigrated to the Americas. In 1889, he dispatched Father Ibrahim Beshawate of the Basilian Salvatorian Order in Sidon, Lebanon, to New York to minister to the growing local Syrian community. According to historian Philip Hitte, Beshawate was the first permanent priest in the United States from the Near East from the Melkite, Maronite, and Antiochian Orthodox Churches. First Vatican Council Gregory was a prominent proponent of Eastern ecclesiology at the First Vatican Council. In two discourses he gave at the Council on May 19 and June 14, 1870, he emphasized the importance of conforming to the decisions of the Council of Florence and of not innovating ideas of papal primacy, such as papal infallibility.Dick (2004), pp. 109‚Äì111 He anticipated a negative impact of a dogmatic definition of papal infallibility on relations with the Eastern Orthodox Church and became a prominent opponent of the dogma at the Council.Parry (1999), p. 313 Gregory also defended the rights and privileges of the patriarchs afforded by earlier ecumenical councils. Speaking at the Council on May 19, 1870, Gregory stated: > The Eastern Church attributes to the pope the most complete and highest > power, however in a manner where the fullness and primacy are in harmony > with the rights of the patriarchal sees. This is why, in virtue of and > ancient right founded on customs, the Roman Pontiffs did not, except in very > significant cases, exercise over these sees the ordinary and immediate > jurisdiction that we are asked now to define without any exception. This > definition would completely destroy the constitution of the entire Greek > church. That is why my conscience as a pastor refuses to accept this > constitution.Dick (2004), p. 110. Dick notes that his source is C. Patelos, > Vatican 1st et les eveques uniates, Louvain: Nauwelaerts, 1981, 482-283 Gregory refused to sign the Council's dogmatic declaration on papal infallibility. He and two of the seven other Melkite bishops present voted non placet at the general congregation and left Rome prior to the adoption of the dogmatic constitution Pastor aeternus on papal infallibility. Other members of the anti-infallibilist minority from the Latin church and other Eastern Catholic churches also left the city.Descy (1993), p. 64 Relationship with the Vatican following the Council After the First Vatican Council concluded, an emissary of the Roman Curia was dispatched to secure the signatures of the patriarch and the Melkite delegation. Gregory and the Melkite bishops subscribed to it, but added the qualifying clause used at the Council of Florence: \\"except the rights and privileges of Eastern patriarchs.\\"Zoghby (1998), p. 83 He earned the enmity of Pope Pius IX for this; during his next visit to the pontiff before leaving Rome, when Gregory was kneeling the Pope placed his knee on the patriarch's shoulder, just saying to him: Testa dura! (You headstrong!).Parry (1999), p. 313. See also the account given by Zoghby (1998), p. 83 In spite of this event, Gregory and the Melkite Catholic Church remained committed to their union with the Holy See. Relationships with the Vatican improved following the death of Pius IX and the subsequent election of Pope Leo XIII. Leo's encyclical Orientalium dignitas in 1894 addressed some of the Eastern Catholic Churches' concerns on latinization and the centralization of power in Rome.Dick (2004), p. 39 Leo confirmed that the limitations placed on the Armenian Catholic patriarch by Pius IX's 1867 letter Reversurus would not apply to the Melkite Church and he formally recognized an expansion of Patriarch Gregory's jurisdiction to include all Melkites throughout the Ottoman Empire. Patriarch Gregory died on July 13, 1897, in Damascus. Following his death he was succeeded as patriarch by Barakat G√©raigiry, who assumed the name Peter IV. Legacy Gregory is remembered as a particularly dynamic patriarch of the Melkite Church.Descy (1993), p. 60 His defense of the Eastern ecclesiological conception of church autonomy established the framework for the Eastern Catholic Church's interventions during the Second Vatican Council.

It is used in astronomy to determine the magnitude and spectral class of a star and in meteorology to determine the intensity of the convection in the planetary boundary layer. Radiative flux also acts as a generalization of heat flux, which is equal to the radiative flux when restricted to the infrared spectrum. When radiative flux is incident on a surface, it is often called irradiance. Flux emitted from a surface may be called radiant exitance or radiant emittance. The ratio of irradiance reflected to the irradiance received by a surface is called albedo. Shortwave radiation flux Shortwave flux is a result of specular and diffuse reflection of incident shortwave radiation by the underlying surface. This shortwave radiation, as solar radiation, can have a profound impact on certain biophysical processes of vegetation, such as canopy photosynthesis and land surface energy budgets, by being absorbed into the soil and canopies. As it is the main energy source of most weather phenomena, the solar shortwave radiation is used extensively in numerical weather prediction. Longwave radiation flux Longwave flux is a product of both downwelling infrared energy as well as emission by the underlying surface. The cooling associated with the divergence of longwave radiation is necessary for creating and sustaining lasting inversion layers close to the surface during polar night.

The station was owned by Elfred Beck. KCEB operated for almost ten months from March 13 to December 4, 1954. History The station was founded by Tulsa oilman Elfred Beck. KCEB (which Beck named after himself as a reversal of his last name) began construction of its studio facilities atop Lookout Mountain in west Tulsa on August 21, 1953. At the time, electronics manufacturers did not include UHF tuners on television sets (the United States Congress later passed the All-Channel Receiver Act into law in 1961, requiring UHF tuners to be included in all newer sets by 1964) and converters or adapters had to be used on sets built prior to that time in order to receive television stations on that band; this factor played into the station's downfall, as many UHF stations ceased operations during the 1950s and early 1960s due to a lack of wide reception; in June 1954, 82 UHF television stations were on the air in the United States, which was reduced substantially to 24 by the following year. At one point, an estimated 100,000 UHF converters had been sold to Tulsa residents by local electronics retailers (which accounted for about 40% of all households with a set in the area). The station was outfitted with the latest equipment. The station signed on the air on March 13, 1954 as the second television station to sign on in the Tulsa market. It originally operated as an affiliate of NBC and the DuMont Television Network; it also shared ABC programming with primary CBS affiliate KOTV (channel 6), which signed on 4¬Ω years earlier in October 1949. As electronics manufacturers were not required to include UHF tuners on television sets at the time, NBC reached an agreement with KOTV that allowed that station to continue \\"cherry-picking\\" stronger shows from both networks. Not long afterward, NBC began allowing KOTV to cherry-pick much its programming, leaving less programming available for KCEB to broadcast. Soon after KCEB signed on, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issued a construction permit to Central Plains Enterprises (run by a group of businessmen led by Robert S. Kerr, William G. Skelly and Dean A. McGee), owners of local radio station KVOO (1170 AM, now KFAQ), for the market's second commercial television station; Central Plains signed KVOO-TV (channel 2, now KJRH-TV) on December 5, 1954. Months beforehand, NBC, which sought VHF affiliations wherever possible, cancelled its affiliation agreements with KCEB and later KOTV, and moved its entire programming schedule to channel 2 through an exclusive contract with that station. Beck then struck a contract with ABC to make it a primary affiliation. However, under the terms of the contract, ABC reserved the right to give KOTV right of first refusal on carriage of all programs. The situation grew worse for the station. The Tulsa Broadcasting Company, which was majority owned by grocery magnate John Toole Griffin, signed on Muskogee-licensed KTVX (channel 8, now KTUL) as the new ABC affiliate on September 18, 1954, taking all of the remaining ABC programs, leaving KCEB with NBC and DuMont, the nation's fourth-rated television network. DuMont's days as a network operation were numbered due to a lack of advertising revenue, with most of the network's programming being dropped by April 1, 1955; the network ceased operations in August 1956. As a last-ditch move, Beck decided to cut back KCEB's operations to a limited four-hour-a-day program schedule in October 1954, relying on filmed programming and NBC programs; the move failed to increase viewership and revenue, resulting in Beck deciding to sign off the station for the last time on December 10, 1954. Four months later on April 5, 1955, Beck sold the KCEB studios and the 40-acre property surrounding it atop Lookout Mountain to the Tulsa Broadcasting Company, to house the facilities of KTVX. Channel 8 initially used the site as an auxiliary studio, before obtaining FCC approval to move channel 8 from Muskogee to Tulsa in November 1955 under the new call letters KTUL-TV to match its sister radio station KTUL (1430 AM, now KTBZ). =Brief revival= Beck retained the construction permit for the channel 23 allocation; upon notice from the Federal Communications Commission in 1965, Beck was ordered to return the station to the air by April 11, 1966 or surrender the construction permit to the Commission. Beck sought outside investment in order to bring the station back on, with Beck selling 65% control of the station to local jeweler Ernest Moody holding and a 25% interest to Claude Hill (owner of radio station KOCW-FM (97.5, frequency now occupied by KMOD-FM)), while Beck retained the remaining 10%. The station briefly returned to the air in September 1967 as an independent station. The station also leased space at the then-recently completed Fourth National Bank Building, to house its transmitter facilities atop the building and to operate studio facilities on the 29th floor of the building. Broadcasting between six and seven hours a day, programming on the station at that time consisted primarily of movies and syndicated programming; plans also called for a nightly primetime newscast at 9:00 p.m., editorials, and forum-formatted public affairs programs. =Post-shutdown= A group of prominent corporate executives and community leaders in the Tulsa area, known as \\"Tulsa 23, Ltd.\\" (led by managing partner Benjamin F. Boddie and investors that included former Williams Companies CEOs John H. Williams and Charles P. Williams, who were also responsible for the redevelopment in downtown Tulsa including the establishment of the Williams Center, the Bank of Oklahoma Tower and the Tulsa Performing Arts Center), was awarded a new station license on UHF channel 23 in early 1980. The group signed on the new station, KOKI-TV, as an independent station on October 23, 1980. KOKI affiliated with the Fox Broadcasting Company when that network launched in October 1986; the station (which has been owned by Atlanta-based Cox Media Group since 2012) launched a news department in February 2002 under the ownership of Clear Channel Communications, and gradually converted to a news-intensive schedule (carrying 48 hours of newscasts each week ), in addition to airing sitcoms, drama series, talk and court shows.

H5 is defined by T16304C in the HVR1 region and 456 in the HVR2 region. Origin H5 has been dated to around 11,500 BP (9500 BC). It appears to be most frequent and diverse in the Western Caucasus, so an origin there has been suggested, while its subclade H5a appears European.U. Roostalu et al, Origin and expansion of haplogroup H, the dominant human mitochondrial DNA lineage in West Eurasia: the Near Eastern and Caucasian perspective, Molecular Biology and Evolution, vol. 24, no. 2 (2007), pp. 436-448 However samples of mtDNA with T16304C in the HVR1 region have been found in four individuals of around 6800 BC from the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B site of Tell Halula, Syria,Fern√°ndez, E. et al., Mitochondrial DNA genetic relationships at the ancient Neolithic site of Tell Halula, Forensic Science International: Genetics Supplement Series, vol.1, no. 1 (2008), pp. 271‚Äì273. suggesting that H5 may have arrived in the Caucasus with farmers from the Near East. Distribution H5* is present at low levels (1%‚Äì3%) throughout the Near East. H5* is most frequent in the Caucasus, forming over 20% of the haplogroup H gene pool in Karatchaians-Balkarians and Georgians ‚Äì people living in the immediate vicinity of the two sides of the High Caucasus. It does not appear to be present in Central Asia. In Europe estimated levels vary from a total absence in Volga-Uralic Finno-Ugrians to 8% in Slovaks and French.Eva-Liis Loogvali et al., Disuniting Uniformity: A Pied Cladistic Canvas of mtDNA Haplogroup H in Eurasia, Molecular Biology and Evolution, vol. 21 no. 11 (2004), pp. 2012‚Äì2021; U. Roostalu et al, Origin and expansion of haplogroup H, the dominant human mitochondrial DNA lineage in West Eurasia: the Near Eastern and Caucasian perspective, Molecular Biology and Evolution, vol. 24, no. 2 (2007), pp. 436-448. However the level generally averages around 5%. Although some research gives the highest levels of H5 concentration throughout Europe as being in Wales. (8.5%) Alzheimer's disease Mitochondria are key regulators of cell survival and death. The most recent report about a possible link between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mtDNA genotypes might show evidence for subhaplogroup H5 as a risk factor for late onset AD. Subclade H5a The one known subclade of H5 is H5a, defined by T4336C in the control region, which has its own subclades of H5a1 and H5a2. H5a is thought to be around 7000‚Äì8000 years old, in other words, the mutation T4336C probably occurred c. 5500 BC. It is fairly evenly distributed at low levels across Europe. The average in samples from Austria, Germany, Hungary, Macedonia , and Romania was 2.4%. Yet it is almost absent from the Caucasus and the Near East, suggesting a European origin. Although it was initially thought to have its highest level on the central European plain, more recent research has shown the highest levels in Iberia, the Balkans and Finno- Scandia. The British Isles was excluded from the latter study, but the former showed that H5a does occur there. √Ålvarez-Iglesias et al. observed a frequency peak for H5a in the Franco-Cantabrian region decreasing towards East Europe and commented that \\"This is compatible with a process of demographic repopulation of Europe after the LGM period centered in this climatic and geographic refuge.\\" However such a scenario would be too early for the date of c. 5500 BC. calculated by Lu√≠sa Pereira, Martin Richards, Ana Goios, et al. So a later dissemination across Europe would appear more likely if the dating is correct. =Ancient DNA= Studies of ancient DNA have found H5 in four individuals of around 6800 BC from the Pre-pottery Neolithic B site of Tell Halula, Syria. H5a has been found in a Tagar (800 BC‚Äì100 AD) man on the Russian steppe whose Y-DNA was R1a1a C.

Subclade H5a1 The subclade H5a1 is defined by the additional transition C15833T.E.-L. Loogv√§li, U. Roostalu, et al., Molecular Biology and Evolution vol. 21, (2004), pp. 2012‚Äì2021. It appears to occur fairly evenly across Europe at slightly lower levels than its parent. The population average in samples from Austria, Germany, Hungary, Macedonia and Romania was 1.8%.

Personal history Hind was born in Preston, Lancashire in 1878. He was educated at Uppingham School before entering Trinity Hall, Cambridge in 1897. He gained four sporting Blues in athletics between 1898 and 1901 and ran the 100 yards in 9.8 seconds on teo occasions. He gained a further Blue with the rugby team in 1900. On leaving university be became a solicitor. Cricket career A right arm medium pace bowler and handy lower order batsman, Hind played most of his cricket for Cambridge but also appeared in a first-class match for Nottinghamshire. That match came in the 1901 County Championship, against Leicestershire at Aylestone Road, but in a low scoring encounter but wasn't called on to bowl by his captain Arthur Jones. The previous year he had played a three-day match for Nottinghamshire against the touring West Indians and made what would have been his highest score of 60 except the match wasn't awarded first-class status. Hind's first year at Cambridge University Cricket Club was his best, claiming 35 wickets at 17.91 in 1898. He took his career best figures of 7 for 30 on debut, in a University Match against CI Thornton's England XI and despite him taking a further two wickets in the second innings they still lost the match. Perhaps the biggest name out of his 80 first-class victims was the great W.G. Grace, whom Hind dismissed when the England Test cricketer was playing for the Marylebone Cricket Club in 1900. Rugby career Hind had a long and distinguished rugby career, first representing Cambridge University while a student. He played in the Varsity Match of 1900 and on leaving he joined Leicester. The first of Hind's two England rugby union caps was a Test in 1905 against New Zealand. The other came the following year when he played against Wales in a Home Nations encounter. In 1903 he toured South Africa with the British Isles and he played his club rugby at Nottingham, mostly as a winger.

The several groups of people who have settled or controlled today's North Macedonia have influenced the country in many ways, one of the most visible being architecture. These groups of people include the Paionians, Illyrians, Ancient Macedonians, Romans, Byzantines, Bulgarians, Serbs, Ottomans, Yugoslavs, and ethnic Macedonians. Early architecture The earliest example of architectural activity in North Macedonia date from the Neolithic and consist of structures associated with Megalith culture. Kokino is the fourth oldest megalithic observatory in the world. The site consists of rocks crafted in a way that lets one observe celestial objects.Kokino Official Website Architecture of Ancient Macedonia Ancient Theatre of Ohrid Remnants of the architecture from the times of the ancient Macedonian Kingdom are scattered throughout North Macedonia, especially in the south of the former territory of Macedon. Heraclea Lyncestis, founded in the middle of the 4th century BC, was an important strategical town as it bordered Epirus to the west and the Paeonian kingdoms to the north. Roman architecture dominates the site today because of the level of the excavations which are exposing the layers from the Roman times. The Ancient Theatre in present-day Ohrid was built during the 1st century BC. It was part of the ancient town of Lychnidos. It is reconstructed and in use today. Its location between two hills that surround it keep it protected from winds that could interfere with acoustics during performances. Roman architecture The Skopje Aqueduct Roman architecture is scattered throughout the country. Skopje is home to a few examples of this type of architecture. One is the Skopje Aqueduct, the only aqueduct in North Macedonia. It consists of 55 stone arches. Another example is Scupi. Although not much remains of this archaeological site, burial grounds and a theatre are somewhat visible. Although it was founded by the Ancient Macedonians, most of the remains of Heraclea Lyncestis are from Roman occupation. These remains include a portico and a large theatre. Other examples of Roman architecture in North Macedonia includes the many Roman ruins in and around the town of Strumica. One of the largest is a well- preserved Roman therma, built during Late Antiquity.  Medieval Bulgarian and Serb architecture  On and off from 893 A.D. to the 13th century, some or all of today's North Macedonia had been controlled by the First Bulgarian Empire and the Second Bulgarian Empire. This resulted in buildings concentrated particularly in Ohrid which was the capital of the First Bulgarian Empire from 968/972 to 1018 AD. This includes historic churches and monasteries like the Church of Saint Sophia, the Monastery of Saint Naum and the Church of Saints Clement and Panteleimon. By 1345, King Stefan Dusan of the Serbian Empire had taken over half of the Balkans including the region of Macedonia and declared himself the new Caesar. The Serbs ruled the territory of modern North Macedonia until end of the 14th century. During their rule, they built notable architecture such as Psaƒça Monastery, Markovi Kuli, and the Church of Saint George. Byzantine architecture Byzantine architecture is one of the most prominent forms of architecture in North Macedonia. It is mostly seen in churches and monasteries, such Treskavec monastery near Prilep. Ottoman architecture The Ottomans controlled the land of present-day Macedonia for about five centuries. They left their mark with the many mosques and other Islamic buildings they constructed. Ottoman architecture is predominant in some parts of Skopje, especially the city's old town. Mustapha Pasha Mosque is one of the most famous Ottoman buildings in North Macedonia. Built in 1492, the mosque is square in shape and the diameter of the dome is 16 meters. The pillars of the porc hare decorated by stalactite decorations that are typical of Ottoman architecture.Culture in MK Ottoman architecture can also been seen in Bitola and Tetovo. 19th-century architecture Examples of neoclassical or baroque architecture are throughout the country but can be rare and limited to one structure per city. Neoclassical architecture can be seen in Skopje (Risti·∏± Palace). The exception to this pattern is in Bitola. ≈†irok Sokak street is filled with neoclassical and baroque architecture and a Gothic Catholic church.

Following governmental centralization after the 1918 creation of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, this initial bottom-up enthusiasm began to fade. Yugoslav architecture became more and more dictated by an increasingly concentrated national authority which sought to establish a unified state identity. Beginning the 1920s, Yugoslav architects began to advocate for architectural modernism, viewing the style as the logical extension of progressive national narratives. The Group of Architects of the Modern Movement, an organization founded in 1928 by architects Branislav ƒê Kojiƒá, Milan Zlokoviƒá, Jan Dubovy, and Dusan Babic pushed for the widespread adoption of modern architecture as the \\"national\\" style of Yugoslavia to transcended regional differences. Despite these shifts, differing relationships to the west made the adoption of modernism inconsistent in Yugoslavia WWII; while the westernmost republics of Croatia and Slovenia were familiar with Western influence and eager to adopt modernism, long-Ottoman Bosnia remained more resistant to do so. Of all Yugoslavian cities, Belgrade has highest concentration of modernist structures. File:Skopje, razglednica so Gradska bolnica, 1930.jpgThe Skopje City Hospital was designed in 1930 by Drago Ebler File:Antigua_estaci√≥n_de_ferrocarril,_Skopie,_Macedonia,_2014-04-17,_DD_15.JPGOld Skopje Bus Station = Socialist realism (1945‚Äì48) = Immediately following the Second World War, Yugoslavia's brief association with the Eastern Bloc ushered in a short period of socialist realism. Centralization within the communist model led to the abolishment of private architectural practices and the state control of the profession. During this period, the governing Communist Party condemned modernism as \\"bourgeois formalism,\\" a move that caused friction among the nation's pre-war modernist architectural elite. = Socialist modernism = Socialist realist architecture in Yugoslavia came to an abrupt end with Josip Broz Tito's 1948 split with Stalin. In the following years the nation turned increasingly to the West, returning to the modernism that had characterized pre-war Yugoslav architecture. During this era, modernist architecture came to symbolize the nation's break from the USSR (a notion that later diminished with growing acceptability of modernism in the Eastern Bloc). = Spomeniks = During this period, the Yugoslav break from Soviet socialist realism combined with efforts to commemorate World War II, which together led to the creation of an immense quantity of abstract sculptural war memorials, known today as spomenik = Brutalism = Student dormitory (1971) by Georgi Konstantinovski in Skopje In the late 1950s and early 1960s Brutalism began to garner a following within Yugoslavia, particularly among younger architects, a trend possibly influenced by the 1959 disbandment of the Congr√®s Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne. Brutalism's growing influence in the nation was most prominently exemplified in reconstruction efforts of Skopje following a destructive 1963 earthquake. Japanese architect Kenzo Tange played a key role in pushing for brutalism in the city, going so far as to propose a full redesign of Skopje in the style. = Decentralization = The Church of St. Clement of Ohrid (1972) by Slavko Brezoski in Skopje blurs the lines between Macedonian religious architecture and postmodernism With 1950s decentralization and liberalization policies in SFR Yugoslavia, architecture became increasingly fractured along ethnic lines. Architects increasingly focused on building with reference to the architectural heritage of their individual socialist republics in the form of critical regionalism. Growing distinction of individual ethnic architectural identities within Yugoslavia was exacerbated with the 1972 decentralization of the formerly centralized historical preservation authority, providing individual regions further opportunity to critically analyze their own cultural narratives.  Contemporary architecture  Most of the modern buildings in North Macedonia are located in central Skopje. One example is the MRT Center (the national TV broadcast station),rising to (70 m) which was the tallest building in the country until 2013 when the Cevahir Towers were build.

Her expertise on Singapore history and citations from her book The Straits Settlements was instrumental to the case presented by the Singapore legal team to the International Court of Justice, in claiming sovereignty over Pedra Branca in 2008. Mary was born the only child to David Turnbull (1900-1961), a native farm-owner in the Cheviot Hills, and Edna Mary Williamson (1901-1991), a schoolteacher from Laxey in the Isle of Man, on a farm not far from Wooler, Northumberland. In the 1920s Coventry grew to be the centre of UK motor industry, and her family moved to the thriving city when her father, who had been forced give up farming as a result of the Great Depression, found a job in motorcar engineering at the Rootes car factory. Throughout her childhood Mary led a happy but simple life despite having to live with different relatives during the Great Depression while her parents were both looking for work in Coventry, and being evacuated several times during World War II. She often described the experience of living through the Coventry Blitz and later, as a university student, the \\"doodlebugs\\" (V-1 flying bombs) in London. On leaving Bedford College, London, she worked for ICI in what would now be termed the Human Resources department. Looking for a more adventurous life, she joined the Malayan Civil Service, the first female administrative officer to be recruited to the Service, and one of only two women who would ever work in that capacity for the colonial authorities. She later joined the University of Malaya in Kuala Lumpur, but on her marriage to businessman Leonard Rayner in 1962, moved to Singapore. Here she was a member of the History Department until 1971 when she moved to Hong Kong to take up a post as lecturer at the University's History Department. It was during her time in Hong Kong that Mary first published her 'History of Singapore'. In 1988 Mary retired from her position as Head of the History Department at Hong Kong University, although she remained in Hong Kong until her husband, Leonard, also retired in 1990. The couple moved back to the UK and settled in the village of Sulgrave, Northamptonshire. Mary continued to write, and travel around Britain, Europe, the United States, Australia and New Zealand and on occasions, visited Singapore and Malaysia. In the 1990s she was commissioned by The Straits Times to compile the history of the Singapore newspaper company and in 1995, Dateline Singapore: 150 Years Of The Straits Times that resulted from nearly 3 years' of work, was launched to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the founding of the newspaper title. Following the death of her husband in 1995, Mary moved to Oxford where she became a fellow of St Antony's College and a member of Oxford University's International Strategic Studies Committee. On the afternoon of September 5, 2008, she was diagnosed with a serious heart condition during a routine check-up and died hours later of a ruptured aorta while awaiting surgery. She had completed the final revisions for the third edition of A History of Singapore just days before her death., Bibliography * Mills, L. A. (1961) British Malaya, 1824-67.

He learnt music from Sesha Bhagavatar, Abhirama Sastri and Chittoor Subramanyam Pillai. He started his career by giving a concert in Tiruchendur in 1934. He was awarded the Padma Shri by the Government of India in 1976, the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award in 1978 and the Sangeetha Kalasikhamani award by The Indian Fine Arts Society in 1983. Annamalai University conferred the Doctor of Law on him Honoris Causa. He was an ardent devotee of Lord Muruga and is known to take pauses to chant his name.  Early Life  It is interesting how Madurai Somu got his name. Paramasivam was the tenth child of Sachidanandam Pillai and Kamalambal, born on February 9, 1919. Sachidanandam, a Bench Court clerk was the son of Srinivasa Pillai, well-known nagaswara vidwan and the family lived in Swamimalai. Sachidanandam got transferred to Madurai, where they lived on Sembu Kinatru Theru. Paramasivam and his elder brothers were attracted towards the martial arts school run by Muthu Vadyar. They learnt silambam, wrestling, etc. Paramasivam was also drawn by the bhajans sung by Narayana Konar at the temple. He would sit with a sruti box accompanying the singer. His mother wanted him to learn the nagaswaram but Somu was keen on vocal music so much so that he would stand in neck-deep water and do sadakam. Paramasivam was initiated into music under Seithur Sundaresa Bhattar, a disciple of Kancheepuram Naina Pillai. Then followed Thevara singing training under Madurai Latchumana Chettiar, a disciple of M.M. Dandapani Desikar and from Sesham Bhagavathar, Abhirami Sasthriar and Madurai Thiruppugazh Mani. In 1934, Paramasivam rendered some devotional songs in front of the presiding deity Lord Muruga at Thiruchendur. With the blessings of Lord Somasundareswara of Madurai and his own mother Paramasivam became Somasundaram... Somu.

Legislation, planning, management and suppression are the responsibilities of the Victorian State Government through its departments and agencies including the Country Fire Authority (CFA) and the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning (DELWP). Fire districts Victoria is divided into nine fire districts as follows: *Central (includes Melbourne, Geelong and Ballarat) *East Gippsland *Mallee *North Central *Northeast *Northern Country *West & South Gippsland *Western District *Wimmera The districts were reconfigured together with weather forecast districts so that they share common alignments. The revised alignments follow Local Government Authority boundaries, except in Yarriambiack Shire. The new alignments came into effect on 3 November 2010. Total Fire Bans & Fire Danger Ratings maps reflect predictions of the relative danger of bushfire conditions in each district and are communicated to the general public through weather forecasts and the Country Fire Authority and Department of Environment and Primary Industries internet sites during the fire season. The ratings are Low-Moderate, High, Very High, Severe, Extreme and Code Red. Bushfire activity in East Gippsland in 2007 Fire management Controlled burning in the Warrandyte State Park, east of Melbourne, February 2008 =Suppression= A number of agencies are responsible for bushfire suppression in Victoria - the Country Fire Authority (CFA) which is a statewide volunteer-based organisation, the Department of Environment, Land, Water & Planning (DELWP) who are responsible for public land, covering one third of the state and the Metropolitan Fire Brigade (MFB), which covers the metropolitan area of Melbourne. Parks Victoria is a government agency which also assiduously maintains the majority of Victoria's wetlands, national parks, marine parks and parklands. Parks Victoria takes part regularly in planned burning and fuel reduction burns which aim to reduce the potential impact of bushfires. Around 70% of Parks Victoria's staff are trained in specific fire fighting roles. Many of those staff are deployed each summer in Victoria to assist in fighting fires. Parks Victoria openly states that it supports the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning (DELWP). =Bushfire warnings= Once fires have started, the Country Fire Authority give graded warnings through various means to areas of settlements that may be affected by the fire. These warnings are distributed as messages detailing the status of the fire, its potential movements and give advice to residents in areas that may be affected. They are as follows: Emergency Alert telephone warnings may be sent in extreme circumstances. Landlines in the emergency area receive voice messages and mobile phones (with a billing address in the emergency area) receive text messages. Emergency broadcasts are made on local ABC and commercial radio stations and Sky News television. Information can also be sought by telephone from the Victorian Bushfire Information Line. During an emergency, the Standard Emergency Warning Signal is played via television, radio and public address systems. Current bushfire incidents and warnings are listed on the VicEmergency website launched in December 2013, Information is also available through the CFA's Twitter and Facebook sites as well as the FireReady app. A 90-second siren at a CFA fire station indicates that CFA members are attending an emergency incident. A prolonged, 5-minute siren is targeted at the local community, indicating that there is an emergency in the area and further information should be sought. =Fuel- reduction burning= Planned burning is carried out by the Department of Environment, Land, Water & Planning at certain times of year to reduce fuel levels in parks and reserves throughout the state. PlanningBushfire Management Overlays= Bushfire Management Overlays are areas identified in planning schemes within each of the Local Government Areas of Victoria that are deemed to have high fire risk. These areas are subject to particular planning and building controls. =Vegetation removal= Following the Black Saturday bushfires of 2009, interim measures were introduced by the State Government to permit vegetation removal in bushfire prone areas. The exemptions include removal of vegetation (including trees) within 10 metres of existing residences as well as all vegetation (excluding trees) within 30 metres. The measures expire on 1 March 2012. =Building standards= The Victorian Government has adopted the residential building Australian Standard 3959-2009 to cover the location, design, construction of new dwellings in bushfire prone areas. The new standard includes consideration of Bushfire Attack Levels which are based on a number of factors including slope, proximity of vegetation and Fire Danger Index. New interim regulations have also been introduced for the construction of private bushfire shelters or bunkers. =Community Information Guides= The CFA, in consultation with councils and stakeholder groups, have developed Community Information Guides for locations in Victoria that are deemed to be in high risk areas. These are mailed to residents and are available on the CFA website. The guides provide emergency contact details, a map and information on preparations, planned emergency service actions and bushfire survival options. Some of these guides include designated Neighbourhood Safer Places which are sanctuaries of \\"last resort\\" during a bushfire emergency. Common causes Common causes of bushfire, figures for Victoria over a 20-year period.Victorian DSE Lightning is the most common cause, igniting the highest number of bushfires, which subsequently account for nearly half of the area burnt by bushfires in the state. Deliberately lit fires are the next most common, although burn much less area than fires ignited by lightning. Public utilities, such as powerlines, ignite relatively few fires, but these subsequently burn similar area to that of deliberately lit fires. Cigarettes, matches and such, ignite a fair few fires, mostly in and around urban areas, and thus burn small areas of land as they are attended to more easily in the more accessible terrain. Many fires are caused by many other less common ignition sources or have unknown causes. =By number of fires= Signage indicating to motorists that smoke from controlled burns may be in the area *Lightning - 26% *Deliberate - 25% *Agricultural - 16% *Campfire - 10% *Cigarettes/Matches - 7% *Unknown Causes - 6% *Misc - 5% *Machinery/Exhausts - 3% *Planned burn escapes - 2% *Public Utilities - 1% =By area burnt= *Lightning - 46% *Public Utilities - 14% *Deliberate - 14% *Misc - 9% *Agricultural - 7% *Planned burn escapes - 5% *Unknown Causes - 3% *Machinery/Exhaust - 2% *Campfire - 1% *Cigarettes/Matches - less than 1% Major Victorian Bushfires Big River, near Anglers Rest, Gippsland, after the 2003 fires =Most extensive fires= *1851 - 6 February \\"Black Thursday\\" (5 million hectares) *1938-39 - December - January \\"Black Friday\\" (2 million hectares) *2020 - 3 January \\"Victoria/NSW Mega Blaze\\" (1.5+ million hectares) *2003 - January - March \\"2003 Eastern Victorian alpine bushfires\\" (1.3 million hectares) *2006-07 - 1 December - 6 February \\"Eastern Victoria Great Divide bushfires\\" (1.2 -1.3 million hectares) *1944 - January - February (1 million hectares) *1983 - 16 February \\"Ash Wednesday\\" (510,000 hectares) *2009 - 7 February \\"Black Saturday\\" (450,000 hectares) *1965 - Gippsland (300,000 hectares) *1898 - 1 February \\"Red Tuesday\\" (260,000 hectares) =Deadliest fires= *2009 - 7 February - March \\"Black Saturday\\" (173 deaths) *1939 - December - January \\"Black Friday\\" (71 deaths) *1926 - 14 February - March \\"Black Sunday\\" (60 deaths) *1944 - December - February (51 deaths) *1983 - 16 February \\"Ash Wednesday\\" (47 in Victoria) *1962 - 14‚Äì16 January (33 deaths) *1969 - 8 January (23 deaths) *1942 - Western Victoria (20 deaths) *1905 - 1 December (12 deaths) *1898 - 1 February \\"Red Tuesday\\" (12 deaths) *1851 - 6 February \\"Black Thursday\\" (12 deaths) *1943 - 22 December (10 deaths) *1952 - January - March, Central Victoria (10 deaths) *1977 - 12 February, Western Victoria (8 deaths) *1965 - 17 January (7 deaths) Longwood, Northern Victoria *1998 - 2 December (5 deaths) Linton, Western Victoria *1985 - 14 January (3 deaths) Avoca, Central Victoria *1997 - 21 January (3 deaths) Dandenong Ranges See also *Wildfire *Bushfires in Australia * 2015‚Äì16 Australian bushfire season *2019‚Äì20 Australian bushfire season *Aerial firefighting and forestry in southern Australia References *DSE Major Bushfire in Victoria *Anatomy of a firestorm, The Age External links *State Library of Victoria's Bushfires in Victoria Research Guide Guide to locating books, government reports, websites, statistics, newspaper reports and images about Victorian bushfires from 1851 to the present. *Country Fire Authority *Department of Environment, Land, Water & Planning: Fire & emergencies * VicEmergency (Incidents and warnings) Bushfires Category:Environment of Victoria (Australia) ","title":"Bushfires in Victoria"},{"id":"20826668","text":"The New Delta Review is a respected literary magazine in the United States in print since 1984 and online since 2012.

He was killed at Cape Helles in Ottoman Turkey during the initial invasion of the Gallipoli peninsula by the forces of the First AIF (Australian Imperial Force) on 25 April 1915.Despite various suggestions given over time, related to particular individuals, it is clear that at least six former VFL footballers were killed during the chaos of the landing at Anzac Cove ‚Äî Rupert Balfe (University, Alan Cordner (Geelong and Collingwood), Claude Crowl (St Klda), Charlie Fincher (South Melbourne), Fen McDonald (Carlton and Melbourne), and Joe Pearce (Melbourne) ‚Äî it can never be definitively argued that one of these men was \\"the first VFL footballer killed in the First World War\\". Family The son of Isaiah Joseph Cordner (1860‚Äì1934), a bank manager, and Jessie Cordner (1865-1901), n√©e Walker, he was born on 6 May 1890 at Bridgewater On Loddon, Victoria. His father remarried Mabel Emilie McKay (1860‚Äì1969) in 1902. He had one full brother, Edward Clement Cordner (1892‚Äì1943), three half-brothers and one half- sister. He attended the Hamilton and Western District Boys' College from 1902 to 1906, and was a prefect in 1905 and school captain in 1906.Main and Allen (2002), p. 44. Footballer As a schoolboy he was renowned for his long drop-kicks and his very strong marks. Recruited from Warrnambool, he played his first senior VFL match, aged 21, for Geelong, against Carlton, at Princes Park, on Saturday, 19 August 1911 (round sixteen). He was given the single game to gauge his prospects for the 1912 season; he played well for Geelong in a high standard match, which Carlton won in the last quarter.Carlton Beats Geelong, The Argus, (Monday 21 August 1911), p. 4.] Although he played well in Geelong's first match of the season,Carlton in Fine Form, The Argus, (Monday, 29 April 1912), p.11. he was not selected again until the match against University on 8 June 1912 (round eight). On a very windy day, with a bad football (it had been over-inflated), and in a very low standard game, which Geelong eventually won by 37 points, 8.15 (63) to 3.8 (26), he was not amongst Geelong's best players.Poor Game at Geelong: University's Weak Forwards, The Argus, (Monday, 10 June 1912), p. 5. Cleared from Geelong to Collingwood on 9 April 1913,Football: Permit Applications (J. A. Cordner, Geelong to Collingwood), The Argus, (Thursday, 10 April 1913), p. 10. he played his first senior game for Collingwood, at Victoria Park, against Carlton, on 17 May 1913 (round four); he played well, in the backline, in a Collingwood team that won a hard-fought match by six points.The Argus, (Monday, 19 May 1913), p. 12. In 1913 he played a total of ten senior games (of a possible nineteen) for Collingwood, including its Semi-Final 37-point loss to Fitzroy on 13 September 1913. He injured his collar-bone during the match, which was played in the rain, on a very wet and muddy ground. He remained on the field of play once injured, but was of little use.Spoiled by Rain: Fitzroy in the Crush: Collingwood Comfortably Beaten, The Argus, (Monday, 15 September 1913), p. 12. His half brother Laurence Osmaston \\"Larry\\" Cordner (1911‚Äì1992), and two of his cousins, Dr. Henry \\"Harry\\" Cordner (1885‚Äì1943) and Dr. Edward Rae \\"Ted\\" Cordner (1887‚Äì1963), also played senior VFL football. Dr \\"Ted\\" was the father of the Don Cordner, Denis Cordner, Ted Cordner and John Cordner who all played for Melbourne in the 1940s. Soldier In 1914 he was working as a clerk, but he enlisted in Melbourne on 22 August 1914; the same day that he played his last match for Collingwood.Note: some accounts are mistaken: he enlisted for service in Melbourne, and his signature was witnessed by a \\"Captain John W. Hamilton\\"; he did not (as some assert) enlist at Hamilton, Victoria (see Service Record p. 2). He was the first Collingwood footballer to enlist.See his father's comment on the AWM \\"Circular\\". He served as a private in B Company of the 6th Battalion, First AIF, and embarked on 19 October 1914, aboard HMAT Hororata, for service overseas. His brother, Sergeant Edward Clement Cordner (89), enlisted on 18 May 1914, serving in the 13 Light Horse.National Archives of Australia: World War I Service Record: Edward Clement Cordner (89) His cousin, Captain Edward Rae \\"Ted\\" Cordner, served as a medical officer in the 6th Field Ambulance.World War I Nominal Roll: Cordner, Edward Rae. His other cousin, Dr. Henry \\"Harry\\" Cordner, overseas at the time that war broke out, was commissioned as an officer in the Royal Army Medical Corps, and served in France.The Argus, 29 August 1914. Death He died on 25 April 1915, shot some four miles inland, after being cut off by the Turks and becoming separated from his Battalion at Cape Helles, the rocky headland at the southwesternmost tip of the Gallipoli peninsula. His body was never recovered. He was initially posted as \\"wounded\\" (in April 1915);The Argus, 25 October 1915. following a fruitless search of the relevant hospitals, he was posted as \\"wounded and missing\\" (in October 1915).The Brisbane Courier, 2 November 1915. He was not officially declared to have been \\"killed in action\\" until after some twelve months of investigation had been conducted by the Red Cross.The Argus, 12 June 1916.Lane, Daniel, \\"ANZAC hero Ted Larkin: The greatest sacrifice of all\\", The Sydney Morning Herald, (18 April 2015). In an apparent act of kindness, the final declaration of his death was conveyed to his mother and father by the Reverend Thomas Pearse Bennett, the vicar of Christ Church, Warrnambool. Pearse, who was also an Anglican military chaplain,World War I Nominal Roll: Chaplains: Bennett, Thomas Pearse. had received the news by wire, that Cordner had been declared \\"killed in action\\", along with \\"expressions of sympathy with the deceased's parents from the King and Government\\", and took the news immediately to Cordner's parents at the Warrnambool National Bank.Warrnambool Standard, 3 June 1916.

Plot summary Batman comes to New York City in his search for an arsenal of high-tech weapons and robots that use decapitated human heads as their brains. Antagonistic, confrontational and suspicious of each other, Spawn and Batman engage in violent battles before realizing they are both after the same villain. Grudgingly, they decide to work together. The person they seek has been kidnapping and decapitating the homeless for use in the robots, but that is only part of the plan: There is also a nuclear arsenal ready to be deployed. Continuity A note inside the front cover states that the one-shot is \\"a companion piece to DC Comics' The Dark Knight Returns. It does not represent current DC Comics continuity\\" and so on. Though the crossover has never been a part of the ongoing Spawn continuity either, it is a commonly held belief that the scar appearing on Spawn's face at the beginning of Spawn #21 is the same wound inflicted by Batman with a carefully thrown Batarang at the closing of the crossover, which is upheld by Spawn's remark in that very same issue that the scar was a result of his run-in with \\"some bozo in black\\". However, through some slight retcon, specifically with the non-chronological release of Spawn #19 and 20, the \\"bozo in black\\" in question is actually revealed/changed to be Harry Houdini, and the scar in question is the result of gunfire that Spawn suffered while protecting Terry Fitzgerald. Frank Miller revealed that the crossover took place in his Batman shared universe alongside The Dark Knight Returns and its various sequels and prequels. In the game Mortal Kombat 11, Raiden remarked that Spawn reminded him of another ‚ÄúDark Knight‚Äù. Spawn remarks that the ‚Äúbillion dollar crusader‚Äù is a friend.

He played college football at Connecticut, and was drafted by the New York Giants in the second round of the 2009 NFL Draft.

On July 30, 2009, the Giants announced that they had signed Beatty to a 4-year contract worth $2.67 million.Giants.com http://www.giants.com/news/headlines/story.asp?story_id=38494 2009: Rookie season Beatty in 2009 In his rookie season, Beatty played in all 16 games. He began the season as a special teams player and situational tight end when the Giants wanted to use an extra blocking tight end. Beatty started 4 games in his rookie campaign at Right Tackle, replacing the injured Kareem McKenzie. His first career start came against the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday Night Football on NBC on October 25, 2009. This ended the current streak of 38 consecutive starts by the offensive line unit. Not until the final 3 games of the regular season did Beatty get the opportunity to start again as McKenzie went down with another injury. Beatty started against the Washington Redskins on Monday Night Football on December 21, 2009; the Carolina Panthers on December 27, 2009; and the Minnesota Vikings on January 3, 2010. In all of the final 3 games Beatty went up against premier defensive ends including Washington's Brian Orakpo, Carolina's Julius Peppers, and Minnesota's Jared Allen. The Giants failed to make the playoffs in 2009 despite winning their first 5 games of the year. 2010 season The 2010 offseason had much speculation about Beatty becoming the starting left tackle. Beatty began the regular season as an extra tight end and special teams contributor. In the first game of the 2010 season, Beatty suffered a foot injury that sidelined him for 8 weeks. He was able to return and started two games at Left Tackle for the injured David Diehl. During this season, Beatty did not give up any sacks. He defines his role with the Giants succinctly: \\"Keeping Eli clean is my job.\\" 2011 season During the lockout of the 2011 offseason, Beatty gained 19 pounds and reported to camp at 319 pounds. In training camp, Beatty won the starting Left Tackle job. The offensive line underwent significant change as veteran offensive linemen Shaun O'Hara and Rich Seubert were both released. In the first preseason game against the Carolina Panthers, Beatty did not give up any sacks. Beatty gained media attention in the week following the game for his tough practicing against Jason Pierre-Paul, who had 2 sacks in the Carolina Preseason game and veteran Osi Umenyiora. Beatty wrote on his Twitter page, \\"Today I showed a vet, Osi Umenyiora #NYG how much I have grown and prepared this off season. I'm glad to have the opportunity to practice my skill on a great pass rusher in the NFL.\\" The following day he added, \\"We had open practice today and all I can say is, if you missed practice you missed a good show.\\" This smack-talking was well received by Giants fans who originally thought that Beatty was too soft and mild-mannered to play in the NFL. Beatty started the first 10 games at Left Tackle for the Giants in 2011. Detached retina On November 23, Beatty discovered that he had a detached retina after playing the Philadelphia Eagles. Beatty had emergency surgery the next day on Thanksgiving Day in New York City to fix the issue. He missed the Monday Night Football game (loss) against the New Orleans Saints. While his eye had been 100% fully reattached, he would not be ready for full contact this season. He was placed on the injured reserve on November 30 with the Giants record being 6-5. The Giants won the Super Bowl this season. Beatty became the first Connecticut football player to win an NFL Super Bowl. 2011 offseason In the offseason, during a lifting session, Beatty disrupted the sciatic nerve in his back. The nerve injury sidelined Beatty from OTA's. 2012 season While allowing his Sciatic nerve to fully heal, Beatty sat out the majority of the pre-season. Due to the detached retina he sustained in the previous season, Beatty received a new helmet, with a shaded visor and a 5 bar facemask to prevent injury and glare. Beatty was declared \\"healed\\" by the medical staff prior to week 1 of the regular season, but in attempt to ease Beatty back into the flow of the game, the coaching staff used Beatty as a 3rd TE in their jumbo package against the Cowboys. Veteran tackle Sean Locklear got the start for Beatty in the season opener. The Giants lost to the Cowboys. In the second game of the season against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Locklear also got the start over Beatty. Beatty started the game as the 3rd TE in the jumbo package. In the first half of the game, Eli Manning threw a red zone pass just behind a wide open Beatty, who missed the catch. Beatty poked fun at himself on his Twitter page, \\"I had a moment to show the world how versatile O Line men can be..... Sorry fellows for not finishing the play.\\" He also include a video of the missed catch on his page. Also during the 1st half, RT David Diehl went down with a knee injury. Locklear then moved to RT, and Beatty moved into the LT spot. He and the rest of the offensive line worked cohesively to protect Eli Manning while he manufactured a fourth quarter comeback. The third game of the season was a Thursday Night game against the Carolina Panthers. Beatty started the game at LT. The offensive line blocked well in pass protection and run blocking. 4th year RB Andre Brown, in his first career start, ran for 113 yards and 2 touchdowns. This game was arguably Beatty's finest game as a pro to date. Beatty started the remaining games of the 2012 season at Left Tackle for the Giants. For the 3rd time in his four-year career, the Giants failed to make the playoffs. They finished with a 9-7 record. For the 2012 NFL season, Pro Football Focus ranked Beatty as the #2 overall LT in the NFC with a 22.3 rating, behind Pro-Bowler Joe Staley. Pro Football Focus also ranked Beatty as the #3 Pass Blocking LT in the NFC, and #2 Run Blocking LT in the NFC (#5 in the NFL), making him one of the most balanced and productive LT in the NFL. His low score could mostly be attributed to his 11 penalties. 2012 offseason On February 27, 2013, Beatty re-signed with the New York Giants. Will signed a 5-year contract worth up to $38.75 million, with $19 million guaranteed and a $12.5 million signing bonus. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good to be home,‚Äù Beatty said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a great feeling. You could be going through free agency, but when that happens a lot of stuff is going through your mind. That feeling is no longer there. You‚Äôre settled in with a great team, a team I love playing for. I know the coaching staff. I‚Äôm looking forward to getting back in it and moving forward.\\" ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad I don‚Äôt have any of those free agency jitters to deal with. It‚Äôs settled, we‚Äôre done and we‚Äôre moving on.

We believe he is one of the ascending left tackles in the NFL.‚Äù 2013 season Beatty started every game at Left Tackle for the Giants. Beatty broke his leg in the final game of the season vs the Washington Redskins, when DeAngelo Hall upended Beatty in frustration. Hall was fined $7,875 for slamming Beatty's head into the ground while Beatty laid on the ground with a fractured leg.http://www.sportsmedia101.com/newyorkgiants/2014/01/04/washington- redskins-deangelo-hall-fined-7875-for-striking-giants-will-beatty-in-head/ 2014 season Despite breaking his leg, Beatty did not miss any training camp or pre-season. Beatty started the 2014 season, his first under new Offensive Coordinator Ben McAdoo, as the #1 Offensive Tackle as ranked by Pro Football Focus. He remained #1 on the list until a Week 7 PFF score of -6.3 dropped him in the rankings. Beatty leveled off to finish as PFF's 11th best Overall Left Tackle and in their top 10 in run blocking. Beatty started every game in 2014. His third consecutive season playing every game. 2015 season On May 20, 2015, during a lifting session, Beatty suffered a torn pectoral injury which required surgery, sidelining him for 5‚Äì6 months. On September 1, 2015, Beatty was placed on the reserve/physically unable to perform list by the Giants, which forced him sit out the first six games of the 2015 season. On November 12, 2015, Giants head coach Tom Coughlin announced that Beatty needed shoulder surgery for a torn rotator cuff and would not return during the 2015 season. Beatty injured his rotator cuff while rehabilitating his pectoral muscle. 2016 season On February 10, 2016, Beatty was released by the New York Giants. He was re-signed by the Giants on August 30, 2016. =Philadelphia Eagles= On November 14, 2017, Beatty signed a one-year contract with the Philadelphia Eagles.

It was adopted in 1959, the year Singapore became self-governing within the British Empire. The committee that created it, headed by then Deputy Prime Minister Toh Chin Chye, was also responsible for the national flag and the national anthem of Singapore. At the centre of the emblem is a red shield bearing a white crescent (a new moon, representing a rising young nation) and five white stars (representing various national ideals including multiculturalism), supported by a lion and a tiger (representing Singapore and Malaysia respectively); below them is a blue ribbon inscribed with Majulah Singapura in gold, Malay for \\"Onward Singapore\\". While the use of the coat of arms is restricted to the government, the symbol enjoys wide use on the national currency and state decorations, and appears on the cover of the national passport.  History  When Singapore became self- governing in 1959, Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew was determined to create for the new state a coat of arms, among other symbols, to replace the coat of arms of the United Kingdom that had been in use until then. A committee was formed to design the state symbols, headed by the deputy prime minister Toh Chin Chye, who wanted both the arms and flag of Singapore to represent the country's united, multi-ethnic society. The coat of arms and the flag were created over a span of two months by Toh and his committee. A law establishing the state symbols of Singapore was presented to the National Assembly by the Minister of Culture, S. Rajaratnam, and approved in November 1959. On 3 December 1959, the state coat of arms, flag and anthem were presented to the people of Singapore for the first time. Toh said in a 1989 interview that when tasked with the creation of the state symbols, \\"apart from the anthem we have to produce the flag and the crest\\", and he felt that the new flag of Singapore should be flying next to the Union Jack.: Toh further stated:  Symbolism  The central emblem of the coat of arms is a red shield with five white stars resting above a white crescent, similar to the crescent and stars used on the Singapore flag and such other national symbols as the national ensign for civilian ships. Red symbolises \\"universal brotherhood and equality of man\\" and white \\"pervading and everlasting purity and virtue\\". The crescent represents a new moon, which reflects \\"a young nation on the ascendant\\", while the five- pointed stars \\"stand for the nation's ideals of democracy, peace, progress, justice and equality\\".Second Schedule of the Singapore Arms and Flag and National Anthem Rules (Cap. 296, R 1, 2004 Rev.

See also The supporters of the shield are a lion and a tiger: the tiger symbolises the nation's historical and close connections to Malaysia (which Singapore was a state of from 1963 to 1965) while the lion represents Singapore itself. Below the supporters is a blue ribbon on which the national motto, Majulah Singapura, is written in gold. Majulah Singapura is also the title of the national anthem; it means \\"Onward Singapore\\" in Malay, the national language of Singapore.  Uses  Istana, the official residence of the President of Singapore The Emblem on the Singapore passport In 1985, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) began to issue their second series of coins. The coat of arms is displayed on the obverse side of these coins, surrounded by an inscription comprising the name of Singapore in the four official languages (Chinese, Malay, Tamil and English) and the year of minting. In 1987 the dollar coin entered circulation with this same pattern. According to the MAS, the coat of arms has also appeared on all Singaporean banknotes since the \\"Orchid\\" series of 1967. State decorations of Singapore also depict the coat of arms on the medallions. For example, the medallions of the Darjah Utama Temasek and the Sijil Kemuliaan use the full achievement of arms, while the Darjah Utama Bakti Cemerlang medal displays the shield.  Guidelines  According to the Singapore Arms and Flag and National Anthem Rules, the use of the coat of arms is restricted to the government. Without explicit permission from the Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts (MICA), no person or group is permitted to physically print, manufacture, display or sell anything depicting the coat of arms, or to allow such actions to happen. It is also forbidden to use any symbol that can be easily mistaken for the coat of arms. Persons who wish to use the coat of arms in a literary work must also obtain prior permission from MICA. The only exception provided by the Rules is that the arms can be used by government officials and ministries on their building's exteriors and on printed documents.Singapore Arms and Flag and National Anthem Rules (Cap. 296, R 1, 2004 Rev.

Geography Ukraine's territory (including the Crimean Peninsula) was the same as that of the Ukrainian SSR with a land area of about . HistoryIndependence= The Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic was one of the founding states of the Soviet Union (USSR). Prior to its creation, the Ukrainian People's Republic was proclaimed in 1917 and declared its independence from Russia on 25 January 1918 before being consumed with Soviet Russia in 1921. In 1985, Mikhail Gorbachev became head of state of the USSR and introduced a number of policies, such as the perestroika and glasnost. Instead of saving the Soviet regime, the reforms triggered a number of popular upheavals in Europe, such as the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. Between 1990 and 1991, several republics of the Soviet Union proclaimed their state sovereignty and then announced their independence. On July 16, 1990, the Ukrainian SSR's parliament issued its 12th legislation proclaiming the sovereignty of Ukraine's territory and the country eventually declared its independence on August 24, 1991. The declaration was then confirmed by the results of the referendum on December 1 later that year, where 90,3 % of voters were in favor of independence. The same day, Leonid Kravchuk, head of the Supreme Council of Ukraine, was elected as the country's first president. Shortly after, an economic then political crisis developed and Kravchuk organized another presidential election as a response. In 1992, Mykola Plaviuk, the exiled Ukrainian president, handed over powers to Kravchuk, thus declaring the Ukrainian government a legal successor to the Ukrainian People's Republic. =Crisis in CrimeaEnd of the transitional period= In 1994, Leonid Kuchma was elected by 52% of the voters. He started implementing certain economic reforms paving the way for aid by the International Monetary Fund. However, Kuchma fails to obtain a majority in the following legislative election by parliament and had to share power with the opposition. The 13th legislation was issued by parliament on June 28, 1996, where a constitution was adopted and took effect immediately afterwards.

Founded as the Red Lion and Sun Society in 1922, it became affiliated with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) in 1924 and changed its name and emblem in 1980, informing the international community of Hilal Ahmar adoption while assuming the right to adopt the former emblem in future. The society is one of the world's largest national societies within IFRC and is noted for its special expertise in responding to earthquakes. Since inception, the IRCS has participated in a variety of public activities. Its core activity is to perform relief and rescue operations to help victims and the injured in natural disasters and accidents. It also engages a in wide range of humanitarian services in health and rehabilitation, training and research. The society had a therapeutic approach and was regarded a major healthcare institution with thousands of hospital beds across the country until 1979, when all of its medical facilities were transferred to the Ministry of Health. IRCS is an example of strong national societies that play an important role domestically and is held in high esteem by the Iranian general public. Organization Emblem formerly used for the Red Lion and Sun Society IRCS has 30 governorate headquarters, one in each province of Iran, and 330 branches throughout the country, as of 2005. Based on the latest structure, it is made up of four departments: relief and rescue (emdƒÅd wa najƒÅt), medical provisions (tadƒÅrokƒÅt-e peze≈°ki), volunteers (dƒÅv·π≠alabƒÅn), and youth (javƒÅnƒÅn). The latter is largely made up by high school and university student members. According to the law enacted by the Iranian Parliament, the society is run by a chairman appointed by the President of Iran. This procedure is in contrast with the elective nature of a society chairman as suggested by the IFRC.

The film was released in the United Kingdom by Focus Features. Synopsis A young Glaswegian-Italian lounge singer, Toni Cocozza (Ian Hart), has a passion for Frank Sinatra and the dream of becoming a famous musician. He grows weary of playing to elderly crowds in third-rate bars and decides to accept career help from mob enforcer Chisholm (Brian Cox) and his boss Connolly (Iain Cuthbertson) whose wife (Una McLean) has taken a liking to Toni. In exchange for assisting the organization with their illegal activities, Chisholm pays for new clothes for Toni and pressures the producer of a talent show to allow Toni to compete in the contest. Meanwhile, he tries to keep his ties with the mob secret from his friend and accompanist Bill (Alun Armstrong) and pretty cigarette girl Irene (Kelly Macdonald) for whom he has fallen. The trio form a modern-day Rat Pack with Irene as Shirley MacLaine. Eventually his luck runs out. While he is helping to rob a store, Toni misses a date with Irene and she and Bill discover that he is leading a double life. They beg him not to compete in the talent show as he will be forever indebted to Chisholm, but he goes anyway. He only places fifth and continues his career singing in lounges, but is deeply unhappy. One day while making a drug drop the drugs he is carrying are stolen by a street kid. Toni refuses to harm the street kid, thus making him a target for the mob hitmen. He performs one last time at a birthday bash for Connolly's wife, fully expecting to be killed after he finishes his number. Bill rescues him by creating a distraction, which gives him a chance to get away with Irene. Using assumed names, the two manage to evade the mobsters and escape to New York City.

Ian was a hugely talented actor, a consummate professional and a much loved colleague.\\" Critical reception The film received less than stellar reviews from critics upon its release, despite the well-regarded cast. Filmcritic.com's Christopher Null wrote, \\"Aside from good singin' and the always engaging Kelly Macdonald (as a cigarette girl who becomes Cocozza's girlfriend), there's just not much movie here.\\" The BBC's Jamie Russell shared similar sentiments: \\"Lacking the scope or ambition that a feature film deserves, this could have made a passable TV drama, but on the big screen it's simply pointless. Not even the talented cast, which includes Ian Hart in the lead and the ever-reliable Brian Cox as one of the main gangsters, can enliven proceedings.\\" ReferencesExternal links * IMDB Listing * Focus Features Category:2001 films Category:British films Category:Films directed by Peter Capaldi ","title":"Strictly Sinatra"},{"id":"20826938","text":"After the Ball is a 1932 British-American comedy film directed by Milton Rosmer and starring Esther Ralston, Basil Rathbone and Marie Burke.

When Burma was politically separated from India in 1937, it attained national status and was recognised as Burma Red Cross Society. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) recognised it as a National Society in 1939. The Society was admitted to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in 1946. The Burma Red Cross Act was enacted in 1959 and amended subsequently in 1964, 1971 and 1988. The 1959 (MRCS) Act confers responsibility to the National Society in implementing humanitarian activities and alleviating human suffering. The St. John Ambulance Brigade Overseas was taken over by the Society as Burma Ambulance Brigade under the 1959 Act.

It was written by Lizzie Mickery, directed by James Hawes, and filmed on location in Scotland, starring Rupert Penry-Jones, Lydia Leonard, David Haig, Eddie Marsan, and Patrick Malahide. Following three screen versions of the novel and the 1952 and 1977 television adaptations of The Three Hostages, Penry-Jones became the sixth actor to portray Hannay on screen. This adaptation is set on the eve of the First World War and sees mining engineer Richard Hannay caught up in an espionage conspiracy following the death of a British spy in his flat. The single drama was first shown on BBC One and BBC HD on 28 December 2008 as part of BBC One's Christmas 2008 line-up, and it was the most watched programme of the day. Compared to Alfred Hitchcock's 1935 film, it received mostly negative reviews from the press. The production was criticised for its historical inaccuracies, particularly its use of anachronistic props. Plot The story starts on 28 June 1914; Richard Hannay (Rupert Penry-Jones), a mining engineer and an intelligence officer during the Second Boer War, is in London following his recent return from Africa, finding England \\"cliquey\\", \\"class-bound\\" and \\"deathly, deathly dull\\". Evading German spies (Werner Daehn and Peter Stark), Scudder (Eddie Marsan) pushes himself into Hannay's flat and reveals himself to be a betrayed freelance British Secret Service Bureau agent, who has been on the trail of a German espionage ring with headquarters in Scotland. He has heard rumours of a plot to assassinate a high-ranking European royal, which could lead to war. Believing he will soon be killed, he hands Hannay a notebook to pass to Captain Kell of the Secret Service Bureau. While Hannay answers the door, Scudder is shot by one of the German spies seeking his notebook who has entered the flat via a back door. The police arrive, and Hannay is arrested for murder before escaping. Unable to contact Kell, Hannay flicks through the notebook, finding it contains pages of code using Roman numerals. He finds a map in the back and takes a train to Scotland to prove Scudder right, attempting to decipher the code en route. Finding out Archduke Ferdinand has been assassinated, Hannay reaches Scotland and leaves the train to escape the police. He stays in a barn overnight, where he deciphers the code in the notebook (except a section in double code), which reveals the Germans want to destroy the Royal Navy so that they could invade the country, starting a war. Chased by the police, the Germans and machine-gun-fire from a biplane, he encounters brother and sister Harry and Victoria Sinclair, a prospective Member of Parliament and a suffragette respectively (Patrick Kennedy and Lydia Leonard), who believe him to be a Liberal spokesman. At a political rally in a nearby town (Culross) where Hannay meets Sir George Sinclair, Harry and Victoria's uncle (David Haig), Victoria aids Hannay's attempt to escape, before they are captured by the Germans. With the notebook missing from Hannay's pocket, they are taken to Longkeep Castle (Dumbarton Castle), the headquarters of the German espionage ring, where they are imprisoned by Professor Fisher (Patrick Malahide). Sir George arrives as they are captured and inquires about them while they are held in another room. After he leaves they are bound and gagged and placed in the cellar. They escape and return to where they were captured to look for the notebook, which Victoria reveals she had picked from Hannay's pocket and hidden. They stay overnight in an inn, where Hannay details the contents of the notebook to Victoria. In the morning, they escape to Harry's house, where Victoria unsuccessfully attempts to contact Captain Kell. Hannay, alone, meets with Sir George, who sits on the defence committee. Hannay reveals the contents of the notebook, leading to Sir George disclosing that a meeting of the National Committee of Defence is being held the next day at Stirling Castle to unveil new naval plans, matching part of the double code. Later, Hannay and Victoria kiss, and the next morning he sees her leaving with a man, whom he recalls seeing previously on the train and at the rally. With the notebook missing and finding out that Victoria disconnected the call she made to the Secret Service Bureau before it was connected, Hannay goes to Stirling Castle, believing Victoria to be a traitor. There, Victoria reveals she works for the Secret Service Bureau and he meets Kell (Alex Jennings) and Wakeham, the man Victoria left with earlier (Steven Elder), who reveal they used Hannay to distract the Germans and sent Victoria to keep an eye on him. Hannay deduces that Sir George is the traitor, as he should have heard them when he was at Fisher's House, and, with his photographic memory, has escaped with the naval plans memorised. To identify his rendezvous point with the Germans, they crack the remaining code, referring to the room they were previously imprisoned in at Longkeep Castle, and discover \\"39 steps\\" written in the notebook by Scudder using invisible ink. At the Castle, Hannay and Victoria find 39 steps leading to a loch. A shoot-out ensues, and a German U-boat surfaces in the loch. Fisher, the Germans and Sir George fail to get to the U-boat before it submerges, and surrender. Together by the loch, Hannay and Victoria kiss before she is hit by a bullet fired by a surviving gunman, falls into the loch and disappears. The story concludes four months later, after the declaration of the First World War, when Hannay, in a British Army officer's uniform, is waiting to meet someone at St Pancras Station. Harry appears, saying that Victoria wanted to say goodbye, and Hannay sees her in the distance. In reply to Hannay's bewilderment, Harry tells him, \\"top secret, old man.\\" Victoria disappears behind a luggage trolley and Harry tells Hannay she'll see him after the war. ProductionDevelopment= Announced by the BBC in August 2008, filming began in September 2008 for a first broadcast at Christmas. Penry-Jones, who had previously worked on the spy drama Spooks, took the lead role, with the screenplay written by Lizzie Mickery (co-writer of the dramas The State Within and Messiah), produced by Lynn Horsford (Boy A, The Mark of Cain) and directed by James Hawes (Fanny Hill, Merlin, Doctor Who). Penry-Jones became the fifth actor to play Hannay on screen, preceded by Robert Donat, Kenneth More, Barry Foster, and Robert Powell. =Writing= At the time of the announcement, Horsford said: \\"With this adaptation we wanted to stay faithful to the spirit and period of the book, but asked the writer Lizzie to feel free to re-imagine it for a modern audience more familiar with James Bond and Jason Bourne.\\" The production was set around the eve of the First World War and retained other elements from the book, including having the 39 steps refer to steps to a departure point, but according to The Times' thriller critic it has \\"a style that gives more than a nod to the grittier James Bond of Daniel Craig\\". A piece in The Observer stated that Mickery was \\"braced for complaints this Christmas from fans of previous screen portrayals\\", after basing her plot on the original book rather than the films. Differences from the book include the introduction of romance for Hannay, through suffragette and spy Victoria Sinclair, played by Lydia Leonard, and, according to Serena Davies of The Daily Telegraph, \\"a plot with so many twists and turns you almost need a degree in espionage to follow it\\". =Casting= Penry-Jones read the book and saw the other versions of the film, but said that Hitchcock's 1959 film North by Northwest was \\"more of a template for me than any version of The 39 Steps\\". Explaining why he took on the part, he said to Tim Oglethorpe of the Daily Record: > Part of the appeal was the cars, I'm a bit of a buff ... And I said ‚Äì > jokingly, of course ‚Äì that I wouldn't be in The 39 Steps unless the action > included the famous chase scene in which Hannay is pursued by a biplane. > I've always wanted to be chased by a plane like Cary Grant in the movie > North by Northwest and I was just delighted when it happened in our version > of Steps. =Locations= The main gate at Stirling Castle, one of the locations used for the production and the setting for a pivotal scene. Filming took place on location in Scotland. Locations used included the area around West Register Street in Edinburgh for the London scenes at the start of the film, Bo'ness railway station, Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum for the interior scenes of St Pancras railway station, Glasgow City Chambers, Culross, Stirling Castle, Dumbarton Castle, the highlands of Argyll and Loch Katrine, used for the finale. =Filming= The production was shot using 35 mm film rather than high-definition cameras. Hawes told Matthew Bell of Broadcast that: > Film is absolutely right for this project. It has scale, big exterior > locations and that's something that still challenges HD .... The HD cameras > available to us on our budget are still vulnerable in difficult weather > conditions [encountered during filming]. There's no doubt that what we've > got on 35mm is just so much more detailed. It has so much more depth of > field and richness than we could have got on HD. =Historical inaccuracies= Some artistic licence was used to find the appropriate props. Cars used included a 1924 Morris Oxford, a 1926 Darracq, and a 1927 Wolseley, previously used in the 1960s series Dr Finlay's Casebook. Willie Bennie, who sourced the vehicles, told the Daily Record: > I knew they were wanting to include car chases to make the drama much more > exciting to watch. The only trouble was that the cars around this era > weren't very fast. Alt URL The biplane that chased Hannay was a 1916 Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5a, his apartment was in an Art Deco building and 1950s rail carriages were being pulled by a steam engine built in 1927. Ben Stephenson, Head of Drama Commissioning at the BBC, told The Daily Telegraph in reply to complaints about the inaccuracies: > The question is: for the seven million people who watched it, did it feel > authentic, did it create a sense of period? ...We were creating a realistic > world within a world ‚Äì a world of damsels and heroes and a huge amount of > excitement. That, for me, is the priority. Did it create that world? It > absolutely did. That's not to say that we don't work increasingly hard to > get everything right. But it's hard to get all the details right when it's a > 21st century drama, never mind anything earlier. Broadcast The adaptation was originally planned to be broadcast on BBC One on Boxing Day, but was later moved to a Sunday night slot on 28 December. It was simulcast in high-definition on BBC HD. Reception Hannay (Penry-Jones) being chased by a 1916 biplane in a promotional image from the production. Penry-Jones was \\"delighted\\" that the scene was included, but it drew criticism and viewer complaints for its historical inaccuracy. Overnight viewing figures estimated that the programme was seen by 7.3 million viewers (28% audience share) on 28 December 2008, against a Top Gear: Vietnam Special on BBC Two. It was the most watched programme of the day. The adaptation received mostly negative reviews from the press, believing it did not match up to Hitchcock's 1935 film version (as predicted by Mickery). Sam Wollaston of The Guardian felt that the romance scene between Hannay and Victoria (when they stay overnight in an inn) was \\"one of the silliest ever\\" and felt that after the final scene at the loch and the concluding scene: \\"It's all very silly .... It doesn't have the pace, the moodiness or the wit.\\" Damien Love of Sunday Herald felt the \\"tepid pace\\" was set by the casting of Penry-Jones, and that he \\"has a style reminiscent of the young Roger Moore, but without the vital, animating spark of self-deprecation. As Hannay, Penry-Jones is not at his best, and more reminiscent of a well-stuffed armchair on wheels.\\" Mick Hume of The Times said \\"The overall effect was to turn Buchan's blood and thunder tale into a pallid politically correct Enid Blyton story\\", and The Independent's Robert Hanks concluded his review by saying that \\"By the end, my impression was that several pages of the plot must have been eaten by a dog, or a bored actor, and the director had decided, sod it, nobody's going to keep watching this long. Which I wouldn't have if I wasn't being paid.\\" The adaptation did receive some positive comments however. In The Sunday Times, A. A. Gill praised Penry-Jones and said that it was \\"racily paced\\" and was \\"the closest to the original [the book] and by far and away the most convincing\\". Roz Laws of the Sunday Mercury also commented on Penry-Jones, saying that he \\"proved to be just as good a spy in 1914 as he was in Spooks, only more dashing\\" and Alison Graham of the Radio Times, in her 'pick of the day' piece, said that Penry-Jones is \\"just perfect as John Buchan's hero\\" and commented that Victoria (Leonard) was \\"a splendid suffragette\\". Alasdair McKay of The Herald said \\"it was all rather spiffing and well-mannered\\". Home media The adaptation was released on Region 2 DVD on 2 February 2009, and Region 1 DVD on 2 March 2010. Sequels Penry-Jones said prior to broadcast that, depending on the reception, \\"They'd like to do more if they can.

Life and career Born and raised in Inkster, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit. She was 17 years old when a fellow member of her high school glee club, Gladys Horton (aged 15), asked her to join her unnamed singing group. After one of the members jokingly said \\"we can't sing yet\\", they became the Casinyets and the group soon featured Katherine Anderson, Juanita Cowart and Georgia Dobbins. After coming in fourth place at a high school talent contest, two of their school's teachers decided to send the group to audition for Motown despite their last place finish. The group auditioned in front of several Motown staffers singing various songs by The Shirelles and The Chantels. Although reportedly impressed, the staffers asked the group to come back with an original recording. Dobbins later took an unfinished blues song, \\"Please Mr. Postman\\", and rewrote it as a catchier doo-wop single. Before they returned to Motown, Dobbins opted to leave for personal reasons. Horton found Wanda Young and the group returned with their own song and was quickly signed to Motown's Tamla subsidiary but not before changing their name to the Marvelettes after Motown CEO Berry Gordy claimed their original name was harder to pronounce. \\"Please Mr. Postman\\" became Motown's first number-one hit on the pop charts and their second million-seller. Tillman would sing on a total of thirteen Marvelettes singles including the follow-up hits \\"Twistin' Postman\\", \\"Playboy\\", \\"Beechwood 4-5789\\" and \\"Too Many Fish in the Sea\\". In 1962, original member Juanita Cowart sang for the Marvelettes until the end of 1963. Continuing on as a quartet, Tillman soon began to have health problems and by 1963 was diagnosed with lupus, she also had been diagnosed with sickle cell anemia during childhood. The constant rehearsals, a stringent touring schedule and recording sessions became too much by the beginning of 1965. On the advice of her doctor after she began suffering health issues during performances, Tillman told band mates she was retiring from performing and recording. She officially left the Marvelettes that January with the rest of the group carrying on as a trio.

Name Dobrova was first mentioned in German written sources in 1252 as in Harde (literally, 'in the woods'), in 1354 as cze Hard ('at the woods'), and in 1490 as bey der Hurd ('by the woods'), semantically corresponding to the Slovene name. The name Dobrova is derived from Common Slavic *d«´brova 'place where there is a deciduous or oak forest', in turn derived from *d«´b—ä 'deciduous tree, oak'. Like similar names (e.g., Dobrovce, Dobrovnik, Zadobrova), it originally referred to the local vegetation.Snoj, Marko. 2009. Etimolo≈°ki slovar slovenskih zemljepisnih imen. Ljubljana: Modrijan and Zalo≈æba ZRC, p. 114. In the past it was known as Dobrawa in German. History The name of nearby Gradi≈°ƒçe Hill (cf. grad 'castle') south of Dobrova, across the Horjul≈°ƒçica River, hints at late Roman or even earlier settlement of the area. A school was founded in Dobrova in 1844 in the sexton's house, which was later adapted for school needs. =Second World War= On 8 July 1942 the Partisans attacked an Italian stronghold at the rectory in Dobrova.

Church Assumption Church in Dobrova The parish church in Dobrova is dedicated to the Assumption of Mary and was one of the most important pilgrimage churches in Carniola. A church or chapel has stood at this site since before 1231, when the structure there was enlarged. According to Johann Weikhard von Valvasor, this is one of the oldest church sites in Slovenia, and according to some sources it may even date to as early as 970. The current church was built between 1711 and 1716, largely due to the efforts of Baron Franc Bogomir Polhograjski, at that time the cathedral canon and dean in Ljubljana. The church was designed by the architect Gregor Maƒçek, Sr. (1664‚Äì1725). The height of the bell tower was increased in 1752. The interior frescos were painted by Matija Brada≈°ka (1852‚Äì1915) and the main altar is a work by Matija Tomc (1814‚Äì1885). The church was formerly known as the Our Lady of the Hazels Church () due to the hazels that still grow there. The church has been protected as a cultural heritage monument since 2009.Slovenian Ministry of Culture register of national heritage reference number e≈°d 1771 Notable people Notable people that were born in, lived in, or had family connections to Dobrova include: *Emil Adamiƒç (1877‚Äì1936), composer *Jo≈æe Marinko (1893‚Äì1975), poetOro≈æen, Bo≈æena. 1991.

Early life and career George Hugh Smith was born in Philadelphia, the son of George Archibald Smith and Ophelia Ann Williams. His family moved back to Virginia when he was a child. Smith attended Virginia Military Institute (VMI) in Lexington, Virginia with his cousin George Smith Patton, and graduated in 1853, ranking 6th out of 26 cadets.Report of the Board of Visitors and Superintendent of the Virginia Military Institute (1853), p. 61 At first Smith was an assistant instructor at the VMI, but he was admitted to the bar in 1855 and practiced law in Glenville, Virginia until he journeyed into the west and settled in the Washington Territory. In 1860 he returned to the east and practiced law in Baltimore. Civil War In 1861 Smith entered the Confederate States Army on June 11 as a Private in the Pendleton Rifles, which became Company E of the 25th Virginia Infantry. Elected as Captain on July 1, he and his men were part of the surrender after the Battle of Rich Mountain. Being paroled 2 weeks later he was formally exchanged in March 1862, and was elected as Colonel of his regiment. He was wounded in the Battle of McDowell and received another wound at the Second Battle of Bull Run. After recovering in late 1862 Smith was ordered by the War Department to take several hundred newly exchanged soldiers to Colonel John D. Imboden for service in western Virginia, and was offered the command of them. In January 1863 he became Colonel of the new 1st Regiment Virginia Partisan Rangers, that became the 62nd Virginia Mounted Infantry, as part of General Imboden's Cavalry Brigade and took it into the Jones-Imboden Raid. In June 1863 the brigade went North, and took part in the Gettysburg Campaign as part of Imboden¬¥s Command that covered the retreat into Virginia. Smith and his men spent the rest of 1863 and early 1864 scouting and skirmishing in northwestern Virginia. While Smith acted as brigade commander on behalf of General Imboden he was transferred with his (now dismounted) regiment to the forces of General John C. Breckinridge. He participated in the battles of New Market and Cold Harbor. Rushing to take part in the Lynchburg Campaign Colonel Smith and his regiment were reassigned to General Imboden and mounted again; and took part in the further Valley Campaigns of 1864. When General Imboden was struck with typhoid fever Smith took command of the brigade on July 5 and reassumed it several times till the end of the war. Being nominated for a promotion to Brigadier General by his division command General Lunsford L. Lomax the nomination was at first vetoed by General Lee. Later on in 1865 General Lee endorsed the promotion, but it was too late in the war to be realized. Postbellum When the war ended Smith first fled to Cuba and in 1866 went to try farming in Mexico. He then went to San Francisco in 1868, and then to Los Angeles in 1869.

It includes the hamlet of Zibel to the southwest of the main settlement and other scattered farms. Geography Babna Gora is a scattered village below Veternik Hill (; also known as Vetrnik or Tabor) and a cliff known as Babƒçar Fort (, ), both standing northeast of the village. A small valley named Pustote lies below the road into the village, where there is a spring. Tilled fields and meadows lie below the village to the northwest, along the Grada≈°ƒçica River, which is prone to flash floods. Name Babna Gora was first mentioned in 1315 as ouf dem Babenberch pei dem Stein (literally, 'on Mount Baben by the stone') and in 1490 as Babina Gora. It is mentioned as Wabnagora or Babnagora in Johann Weikhard von Valvasor's 1689 work The Glory of the Duchy of Carniola. In the past it was known as Babnagora in German.Intelligenzblatt zur Laibacher Zeitung, no. 141. 24 November 1849, p. 13.

Ljubljana: Cankarjeva zalo≈æba, p. 49. (see below) because the local women would take refuge there and to repel Turkish attacks. However, because the fortification postdates the 1315 attestation of the village's name (the Turks attacked the area only once, in 1476), this is merely a folk explanation. In fact, lone cliffs or rock formations are often named Baba 'old woman' or Dedec 'old man' in Slovenia, and it is from this that the toponym Babna Gora and oeconym Babƒçar are derived. History Valvasor's 1689 The Glory of the Duchy of Carniola states that an \\"old, destroyed, mighty camp\\" stood at the top of Veternik Hill and that it was a \\"large structure, containing fourteen rooms.\\" This fortification, the Babƒçar Fort (), is named after the Babƒçar farm in the village and dates back to at least the 15th century. The ruins of the Babƒçar Fort are protected as cultural heritage. =Mass grave= Hudnik family mass grave The forest just outside Babna Gora is the site of a civilian mass grave from World War II known as the Martinƒçiƒç Family Grave [sic] (). The victims were nine members of the Hudnik family from the Martinovec farm (an oeconym) that were executed by the Partisans on November 24, 1942 for sheltering a deserter.Matija ≈†kerbec. 1957.

Rajagopalachari and Maulana Azad The Simla Conference of 1945 was a meeting between the Viceroy of India Lord Wavell and the major political leaders of British India at Viceregal Lodge in Simla. Convened to agree on and approve the Wavell Plan for Indian self-government, and there it reached a potential agreement for the self-rule of India that provided separate representation for Muslims and reduced majority powers for both communities in their majority regions. Talks, however, stalled on the issue of selection of Muslim representatives. Seeking to assert itself and its claim to be the sole representative of Indian Muslims, the All-India Muslim League refused to back any plan in which the Indian National Congress, the dominant party in the talks, appointed Muslim representatives. This scuttled the conference, and perhaps the last viable opportunity for a united, independent India. When the Indian National Congress and the All India Muslim League reconvened under the Cabinet Mission the next year, the Indian National Congress was far less sympathetic to the Muslim League's requests despite Jinnah's approval of the British plan. On 14 June 1945 Lord Wavell announced a plan for a new Executive Council in which all members except the Viceroy and the Commander in Chief would be Indians. This executive council was to be a temporary measure until a new permanent constitution could be agreed upon and come into force. All portfolios except Defense would be held by Indian members. Lord Wavell Prime Minister Winston Churchill as head of the war cabinet proposed Field Marshal Wavell's name to his cabinet in mid-June 1943, as India's next viceroy. General Sir Claude Auchinleck who had followed Wavell in his middle eastern command was to be the next commander in chief of Indian army after Lord Wavell. In October 1943 the British Government decided to replace Lord Linlithgow with Lord Wavell as the Viceroy of India. Before assuming the vice royalty, Lord Wavell had been head of the Indian army and thus had an understanding of the Indian situation. On becoming Viceroy, Wavell‚Äôs most important task was to present a formula for the future government of India which would be acceptable to both the Indian National Congress and the All-India Muslim League. Background of the Simla Conference Gandhi launched the Quit India Movement in August 1942, after which he was arrested with other Congress lieutenants like Nehru and Patel. He was kept separate in Agha Khan's Pune palace while others were kept in Ahmednagar Fort. Now he decided to launch his Satyagraha, he commenced after the early morning breakfast on 10 February 1943 a fast for 21 days. Weighing 109 pounds when he started fast lost eighteen pounds after his 21-day ordeal. Fearing the death of Gandhi in prison as before him Kasturba his wife and Mahadev Desai his private secretary died in the same prison in Pune Palace, Lord Linlithgow recommended Churchill immediate unconditional release of Gandhi. Churchill wrote back to Linlithgow, \\"it seems almost certain that the old rascal [Gandhi] will emerge all better for his so-called fast. Gandhi broke his fast on 3 March 1943. Gandhi suffered from malaria, and after that his health was seriously deteriorated. New Viceroy Archibald Wavell, recommended his unconditional release, Leo Amery the secretary of state for India convinced Churchill to release Gandhi on medical grounds, so he was released. Instead of dying Gandhi showed remarkable resilience and recovered. It was quite funny when Churchill sent Wavell a peevish telegram asking why Gandhi has not died yet? Communal problem was the greatest problem for any political advance in India, so Wavell also began to agree with Amery's conviction that until \\"Aged Trinity\\" (Gandhi, Churchill and Jinnah) is in lead there is a little chance of any political advance. Lord Wavell had a plan in his mind and was eager to invite key leaders to a summit, but he was waiting for something to come out of Gandhi-Jinnah meetings rescheduled on 9 September. C. Rajagopalachari has presented a formula before that meeting that was accepting the Muslim right for a separate homeland. Talks started on 9 September 1944 in Mallabar Hill house of Jinnah, both leaders spent three and half hours of secret discussion but Gandhi later with C. R. called it a \\"test of my patience and nothing and I am amazed at my own patience.\\" Their second meeting proved no more fruitful than first one, Jinnah sensed by this time the futility of talks. Then there was a session of written correspondence on 11, 12, 13 and 14 September, and on 24, 25 and 26 September 1944, but nothing came out of it. Gandhi by now believed that \\"Jinnah was a good person but he suffers hallucination when he imagines about unnatural division of India and creation of Pakistan\\". Wavell wired to Amery, \\"Gandhi wants independence first and then willing to resolve communal problem as he is profoundly a Hindu and wants transfer of full Power to some nebulous national\\", While Jinnah wants to settle down communal problem first and then wants independence as he has lost his trust in Congress and Hindus.\\" Wavell also viewed this mini-summit breakdown a personal challenge to bring together two parties. He has many creative ideas, and was willing to use his influence and power to settle the communal deadlock. He would try to bring some moderate Indian leaders on a settlement by calling them to Shimla (India's summer capital). His list included as he told to Amery, \\"Gandhi and one \\"other\\" of Congress party, Jinnah and one other member of Muslim League, Dr. Ambedkar to represent \\"Depress classes\\", Tara Singh to represent Sikhs, M. N. Roy for labor representation, and some other to represent Non-Congress and Non-League Hindus and Muslims. After correspondence with Amery in October, now Wavell decided to write Churchill directly and he tried to convince Churchill in this regard though he was sure that Churchill was reluctant for any summit as \\"he hated India and anything to do with it\\". Churchill informed Amery the possibility to see Wavell not before March 1945, Wavell on his own behalf met with Jinnah on 6 December, and tried to convince him to live in United India as this will be much more beneficial for all as it will represent a strong nation on international level. Jinnah argued that \\"Indian unity was only a British creation\\". Benghal's governor Richard Casey was well informed about Congress- League relation that he wrote to Wavell, \\"Congress is basically responsible for the growth of Pakistan idea, by the way they treated the Muslims especially by refusing them into coalition provincial governments.\\" Wavell agreed with everything Casey said about Pakistan, writing in his reply \\"I do not believe that Pakistan will work\\". Churchill chaired his war cabinet that reviewed and rejected Wavell's proposal for constitutional reforms in India on December 18. But Wavell was invited to visit England, and met with Churchill and Cabinet in May 1945. Wavell was allowed to fly back to India in June 1945 to release Congress Working Committee member and start talks that was later called Shimla Conference. Wavell decided to call all key leaders of India in Shimla on 25 June 1945 and broadcast a message to all Indians on 14 June 1945 showing British willingness to give India dominion status as soon as possible if the communal deadlock is broken down. \\"India needs a surgical operation\\", Nehru noted after considering Wavell's idea, \\"We have to get rid of our preoccupation with petty problem\\" as he considered communal problem a petty problem. Jinnah accepted the invitation but if he could meet with Wavell alone first on 24 June. Details of the Conference One day before the conference was convened on 24 June, Wavell met with Azad, Gandhi and Jinnah to assess their approach. He noted in his diary, \\"Gandhi and Jinnah are behaving like very temperamental prima donnas\\". Lord Wavell officially opened the summit at 11:00 am on 25 June 1945. In the beginning Azad being president of Congress spoke of its \\"non-communal\\" character. Jinnah spoke of Congress' predominately Hindu character, at that point there was a tug of war that was settled down by Wavell's intervention. On the morning of 29 June the conference was reconvened and Wavell asked parties to submit list of candidates for his new council, Azad agreed while Jinnah refused to submit a list before consulting Muslim League's working committee. Conference was adjourned till 14 July, meanwhile Wavell met with Jinnah on 8 July and tried to convince him as Jinnah was determined to nominate all Muslim member from Muslim League's platform as he considered Congress Muslim representatives as \\"Show Boys\\". Wavell gave him a letter that was placed in front of Muslim League's Working Committee on 9 July. Jinnah replied after careful consideration of Working Committee, \\"I regret to inform you that you have been failed to give assurance relating nomination of all Muslim members form Muslim League's platform so we are not able to submit a list.\\" The Viceroy was equally resolved not to give at that point and wired to Amery at that night his own list of new council members. Four were to be Muslim League members (Liaquat Ali Khan, Khawaja Nazimuddin, Chaudhry Khaliquzzaman and Eassak Sait) and another Non-League Muslim Muhammad Nawaz Khan (a Punjabi landlord). The five 'Caste Hindus' had to be Jawaharlal Nehru, Vallabhbhai Patel, Rajendra Prasad, Madhav Shrihari Aney, B. N. Rau. Tara Singh was to represent Sikhs and B. R. Ambedkar to \\"untouchables\\" John Mathai was the only Christian thus bringing total to sixteen with Viceroy and Commander-in-Chief. Amery asked Wavell to consult this list with Jinnah, when Jinnah was asked about Muslim names he bitterly refused to allow any League member to be part of the government until the League's right to be the sole representative of Muslims of India was acknowledged. Wavell found this demand impossible thus he half an hour later told Gandhi about his failure, Gandhi took news calmly and said \\"H. M. G. sooner or later have to take Hindu or Muslim point of view as they were irreconcilable.\\" Thus the Wavell plan that was later to be called Shimla Conference was badly failed. Detailed Wavell Plan In May 1945 Wavell visited London and discussed his ideas with the British Government. These London talks resulted in the formulation of a definite plan of action which was officially made public simultaneously on 14 June 1945 by L.S. Amery, the Secretary of State for India, in the House of Commons and by Wavell in a broadcast speech delivered from Delhi. The plan, commonly known as the Wavell Plan, proposed the following: 1\\\\. The Viceroy‚Äôs Executive Council would be immediately reconstituted and the number of its members would be increased. 2\\\\. In the Council there would be equal representation of high-caste Hindus and Muslims. 4\\\\. All the members of the Council, except the Viceroy and the Commander-in-Chief, would be Indians. 5\\\\. An Indian would be appointed as the member for Foreign Affairs in the Council. However, a British commissioner would be responsible for trade matters. 6\\\\. The defense of India would remain in British hands until power was ultimately transferred to Indians. 7\\\\. The Viceroy would convene a meeting of Indian politicians including the leaders of Congress and the Muslim League at which they would nominate members of the new Council. 8\\\\. If this plan were to be approved for the central government, then similar councils of local political leaders would be formed in all the provinces. 9\\\\. None of the changes suggested would in any way prejudice or prejudge the essential form of the future permanent Constitution of India. To discuss these proposals with Indian leaders, Wavell summoned them to a conference to take place in Simla on 25 June 1945. Criticism of Wavell Plan The Wavell Plan, in essence, proposed the complete Indianisation of the Executive Council, but instead of asking all the parties to nominate members to the Executive Council from all the communities, seats were reserved for members on the basis of religion and caste, with the caste Hindus and Muslims being represented on it on the basis of parity. Even Mahatma Gandhi resented the use of the words ‚Äúcaste Hindus‚Äù. While the plan proposed immediate changes to the composition of the Executive Council it did not contain any guarantee of Indian independence, nor did it contain any mention of a future constituent assembly or any proposals for the division of power between the various parties of India. Failure of the Simla Conference Meanwhile, a general election had been held in the United Kingdom in July 1945 which had brought the Labor Party to power. The Labor party wanted to transfer power to the Indians as quickly as possible. The new government sent the Cabinet Mission to India and this proved to be the final nail in the coffin of the Wavell Plan.

The station maintains a tower in Dresden and studios in Martin, shared with WCMT-AM-FM (1410 AM and 101.3 FM); WCDZ's tower site is also home to WCMT AM's FM translator.  History  WCDZ began broadcasting November 18, 1991 as WJZK. The original format was Lee Abrams' Classic Rock from the Satellite Music Network in Dallas, Texas. The station was the first in the West Tennessee area to broadcast digitally 24 hours a day. The station's format changed on March 1, 1992, to a 24-7 Southern Gospel format; the call letters changed to WGNN which stood for the Good News Network. In 1994, Valley Wide Broadcasting, whose principals included Ray Smith and John Latham of Camden, Tennessee, sold the radio station to Thunderbolt Broadcasting.http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/cgi- bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/call_hist.pl?Facility_id=67055&Callsign;=WCDZ After Thunderbolt bought the station, it changed the call letters to WCDZ February 28, 1994. WCDZ carried the Jones Radio Network's CD Country syndicated format and also added the Atlanta Braves and Tennessee Vols sports. In 1998, the station changed to \\"Good Time Oldies\\", also from the Jones Radio Network, playing music from the late 50s to the early 70s, with primary focus on music of the 60s. That change proved to be very successful for the station. On October 8, 2010, WCDZ shifted programming to classic hits and adopted the Star 95.1 moniker. The station abandoned the satellite format in 2013 and now broadcasts with all music programmed locally without personalities.

He also stressed that \\"power is seen as something that has a moral substance\\" in the RDPC and that \\"when you are in power and managing people, you must show exemplary conduct\\". According to Ngolle Ngolle, Biya's re-election as RDPC National President at the congress was almost a foregone conclusion due to what he described as Biya's impressive achievements; he credited Biya with introducing multiparty democracy as well as working with the opposition and thereby facilitating dialogue between political parties. After nearly nine years as Minister of Special Duties, Ngolle Ngolle was promoted to the position of Minister of Forestry and Wildlife on 22 September 2006.\\"The Rejig And Spanking\\", The Post (Cameroon), 25 September 2006. As Minister of Forestry and Wildlife, Ngolle Ngolle worked to enforce anti-poaching laws and curb the illegal sale of bushmeat. Although a law designed to protect endangered species from poaching was passed in 1994, it was not enforced until around 2004, and even afterward trade in illegal bushmeat remained quite widespread. Ngolle Ngolle complained in early 2010 that \\"we see people selling bushmeat everywhere, anywhere, in public places, along the roadsides. And it's more or less putting a shame on our dignity and our commitment to fight illegal poaching.\\" At the same time, he discussed the introduction of a new government program to regulate the trade by allowing the sale of bushmeat only at specially designated places. At those places, bushmeat from relatively prolific species, such as cane rats, could be sold, but people selling meat from endangered species would be punished. Related government initiatives conducted by Ngolle Ngolle's ministry involved the recruitment of forest guards and providing bushmeat traders with work in the agricultural sector.Divine Ntaryike, \\"Cameroon Government Regulates Bushmeat Trade\\", VOA News, 4 February 2010.

He read politics, philosophy, and economics (PPE) at St. John's College, University of Oxford and graduated with honours.About Korn While at St. John's College, he was a classmate of Abhisit Vejjajiva. Investment banker Korn worked in asset management at SG Warburg while a student and joined the firm after his graduation. He left Warburg and returned to Thailand in 1988, founding J.F. Thanakom, a joint venture between Jardine Flemings and Finance One. JF Thakakom became the kingdom's largest brokerage by 1995-6 and became the first Thai investment bank to manage a public takeover, as well as the first to lead manage a Euro- convertible for a Thai firm, with Korn at the helm. In 1999, JF Thanakom was sold to JP Morgan (later JP MorganChase). Korn stayed on as Senior Country Officer. 2005-2006 Thai political crisis and the 2006 coup Korn (center) with Abhisit Vejjajiva (right) Korn left JP Morgan in October 2004, joined the Democrat Party to run for office, and subsequently went on to win a seat in Bangkok‚Äôs 2nd constituency (Sathorn ‚Äì Yannawa) in the general elections of February 2005. After the defeat of the Democrat Party, Abhisit Vejjajiva replaced Banyat Banthadthan as Democrat Party leader. Korn was appointed Deputy Secretary General and Secretary for Economic Affairs of the Party. He became a vocal member of the opposition to the government of Thaksin Shinawatra during the 2005-2006 Thai political crisis. During the same period, Korn played a major role in examining the economic policies of Thaksin's government including the Shin Corporation Deal Scandal. On the night of 19 September 2006, the Thaksin government was overthrown by 2006 coup. Korn expressed his opinion that he was \\"sad\\" and felt that it was \\"understandable for any democracy to denounce coups as a concept in general\\", however he felt that the coup had to be examined \\"within the context of the Thai political situation.\\" Korn was reelected in the post-coup 2007 elections, but the Democrat Party remained in the opposition after losing to the People's Power Party. During both Samak Sundaravej and Somchai Wongsawat's brief terms as prime minister, Korn served as shadow finance minister for the Democrat Party. 2008-2011, member of Abhisit government Korn during travel to APEC Singapore 2009 On 2 December 2008, the Constitutional Court dissolved the People's Power Party. Abhisit Vejjajiva was subsequently appointed prime minister after a parliamentary vote. Korn was appointed finance minister in the Abhisit administration in December 2009. Korn's significant achievements as Minister of Finance include: a 117-billion baht stimulus package initiated in January 2009 and a second stimulus package (), valued at over 1.4 trillion baht in 2010‚Äì2012. Most of the funds were spent improving infrastructure in Thailand, especially irrigation and transportation, public health, education, and tourism. Korn focused on policies that addressed social inequality and poverty. He pushed through a bill in the Thai cabinet in April 2010 on land and building tax (property tax), part of a plan to overhaul the country's tax structure as the first step to achieving a balanced budget. Korn helped refinance loan shark debt for over 500,000 Thais, many of whom were being charged more than 100% per annum interest on their loans. In January 2010, Korn was named \\"Finance Minister of the Year 2010\\", both globally and for the Asia Pacific region by The Banker magazine of the Financial Times. The magazine complimented the Thai minister on his \\"financial management skills as he assumed the finance ministerial position in Thailand amid the economic stagnation\\". He was also given credit for his contributions to promote and enhance financial and economic cooperation in ASEAN. Korn is the only Thai to have received both awards.The Banker: Finance Minister of the Year 2010 - Global and Asia-Pacific As then Chair of the ASEAN Finance Ministers' meetings in 2009, Korn helped create the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization (CMIM), a regional foreign reserve pool to remedy currency flow shortages. After the Democrats were defeated in the 2011 election, Korn's term as finance minister ended and he took on the role of Shadow Deputy Prime Minister for Economic Affairs in Abhisit Vejjajiva's shadow cabinet. He was replaced by Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) economist Thirachai Phuvanatnaranubala. In May 2011, the editorial pages of both the Japan Times and the South China Morning Post mentioned Korn as a possible candidate to replace Dominique Strauss-Kahn as head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for \\"his deep understanding of financial markets\\". Moreover, it was mentioned that the position should not be limited to candidates exclusively from the US and the European Union, as there were many good candidates from Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Korn did not accept a position with the IMF but instead continued his work with the Democrat Party. 2014‚Äì2020: post-coup activities Prior to the 2014 Thai coup d'√©tat, Korn chaired the Democrat Party's Policy Unit. In his capacity as the Chair of the Policy Unit, Korn helped transform the party's platform to become more research oriented and issue-based. The main focus of his research centred around the topics of education reform, enhancing irrigation technology to increase crop yields, and increasing the value of agricultural products. Korn travelled extensively in Asia to advocate a reorganization and rebalancing of multilateral institutions to reflect the shift in economic power away from North America and Europe towards Asia. In an opinion piece in the Nikkei Asian Review, Korn wrote: \\"Clear double standards in how Western institutions treat those outside their 'club' have drawn a significant response from developing countries. ASEAN, with the cooperation of China, Japan and South Korea, managed in 2010 to create a foreign exchange reserves pool named the Chiang Mai Initiative‚Äîa multilateral currency swap mechanism aimed at preventing a repeat of the Asian Financial Crisis, when they were forced to kowtow to unsympathetic multilateral institutions.\\" In August 2014, Korn established Kaset Khem Kaeng, a non-profit with a mission to help small farmers practice sustainable farming and receive fair compensation for their produce. The project started as a joint venture between the company and one small village in Maha Sarakham Province, one of the poorest provinces in Thailand. The company was able successfully to buy chemical-free Jasmine rice from farmers at 20,000‚Äì25,000 baht per tonne compared to the market rate of only 8,000 baht per tonne. In March 2015, Korn presented a vision for modern Thai entrepreneurship by interviewing twelve Thai entrepreneurs in the book Dare to Do ‡∏Å‡∏•‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏•‡∏∏‡∏¢ ‡πÑ‡∏°‡πà‡∏Å‡∏•‡∏±‡∏ß‡∏•‡πâ‡∏°\\" 12 ‡πÄ‡∏™‡πâ‡∏ô‡∏ó‡∏≤‡∏á‡∏Ñ‡∏ß‡∏≤‡∏°‡∏™‡∏≥‡πÄ‡∏£‡πá‡∏à‡∏Ç‡∏≠‡∏á 12 ‡∏¢‡∏≠‡∏î‡∏ô‡∏±‡∏Å‡∏ò‡∏∏‡∏£‡∏Å‡∏¥‡∏à‡πÅ‡∏´‡πà‡∏á‡∏¢‡∏∏‡∏Ñ. In January 2020, Korn resigned from the Democrat Party, leading to speculation that he might form a new party. The following day, he was followed by Democrat Party MP Attawit Suwanpakdee, lending credence to the notion that a new party is in the works. That party came into being on 14 February 2020, when Korn and his political allies registered a new party with the Election Commission. It is called the \\"Kla Party\\" (, ). Korn contributes regularly to the Bangkok Post, Forbes (Thailand), and GQ (Thailand).

The university offers doctoral studies in musicology and music education.  History  Frankfurt had an institute for the teaching of music since 1878. The Hoch Conservatory flourished and had a worldwide reputation in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Through teachers like the pianist Clara Schumann and composers Joachim Raff, Bernhard Sekles and Engelbert Humperdinck, the Hoch Conservatory attracted students from around the world, including the composers Hans Pfitzner, Edward MacDowell, Percy Grainger, Paul Hindemith and Ernst Toch, and the conductors Otto Klemperer and Hans Rosbaud. In April 1933, when the National Socialists came to power in Germany, the director Bernhard Sekles, M√°ty√°s Seiber, head of the world's first jazz department, and twelve other members of the teaching staff who were Jewish or foreign, were removed from their positions. Later, the Hoch Conservatory was degraded to a Music School (Musikschule des Dr Hoch's Konservatorium). In 1938 the \\"Hochschule f√ºr Musik\\" was established. In 1940 its name was the \\"Staatliche Hochschule f√ºr Musik ‚Äì Dr Hoch's Konservatorium\\", but in 1942 the subtitle \\"Dr Hoch's Konservatorium\\" was dropped, leaving the full name as \\"Staatliche Hochschule f√ºr Musik\\". In his testament Joseph Hoch, benefactor of the conservatory, had stipulated that the name \\"Dr Hoch's Konservatorium\\" should never be changed.See \\"Verfassung\\" at dr-hochs.de The Hochschule thus became a new and separate institution, distancing itself from the conservatory its history. In the closing stages of World War II, both institutions closed down. After the war both were reopened, and they now work together in a three-tier system of the Hochschule, the Hoch Conservatory and the Music School. Helmut Walcha, who had taught the organ at the Hoch Conservatory from 1933 to 1938, initiated the reopening of the Hochschule in 1947. The first department to be reopened was that of church music, followed by the department of school music and, in 1949, the seminar for the teaching of music. The Big Band of the Hochschule with Allen Jacobson In the summer of 1950, the violinist Walther Davisson, who had studied and taught at the Hoch Conservatory, became artistic director of both the Hochschule and the Hoch Conservatory. Under his directorship the Department of Performance was, step by step, restarted in instrumental and vocal training. During this post-war period, teaching was still taking place in private homes and in the partly renovated conservatory building ‚Äì which was still in ruins. (It was unfortunately pulled down later.) Not until 1956 did the Hochschule have its own building: it was given the Radio-House of the Hessischer Rundfunk, built in 1933. The development of the Hochschule continued through the 1950s and 60s: including the establishment of the opera school and opera- choir school (1954 and 1958), the drama school (1960) and the dance school (1961). In the 1960s the Studio for New Music and the Studio for Early Music were initiated. Later, departments of jazz and popular music were opened and in 1982 the department of musicology was established. From 1989 the Hochschule was given the right to offer graduate studies in the teaching of music and musicology. From 1990 until 1993 the Hochschule's new main building and library were built. The Historical Performance Practice and Contemporary Music Institutes were founded in 2005.Information about the history of the Hochschule since 1950 comes from the website of the Hochschule.

It was a substitution code based on a prose passage of 682 characters, so that a given character could be replaced by more than one number. Dumas planted stories favorable to the United States in the Gazette de Leyde (Leiden, Netherlands) with the goal of gaining a good credit rating for the United States in financial markets.Knott, Stephen F., \\"Secret and sanctioned, covert operations and the American Presidency,\\" Oxford University Press, 1996, page 21. .

History  The shrine room inside the temple It is believed that the temple bears a history dating back to about 2,000 years. Historically, the Dhowa temple was known as the Kumbaltissa Ariyagala Vehera, named after its chief priest who had provided sanctuary for King Walagamba, who turned the cave into a temple.Dowa Cave Temple Work at the temple was not completed during the reign of King Walagamba, but was fully completed during the Kandyan Kingdom.  Attractions  The unfinished Buddha image at Dhowa Raja Maha Vihara The rock carved Buddha statue and the ornamental gateway are the main attractions of the temple. The statue is in a state of ruin due to rapid decaying. Folk tales hold that the half finished Buddha statue was carved by King Walagamba himself while hiding in this caves during foreign invasions. The king is said to have left the area before he could finish carving the statue, thus leaving it half finished. = Paintings = The paintings of the shrine room had been decorated with the influence of the Kandyan era. These paintings depict various Jathaka stories. The canopy of the rock is decked with paintings of lotus and various other flowers. Among these paintings, the Ath-Gon Satana (battle between a tusker and a bull) is featured. The priority had been given to the cobra image in the structure of the temple.

The monastic complex consists of a church, chapel, and gavit. Surrounding the monastery are numerous khachkars and gravestones that are part of a small cemetery. To the northwest a short distance from the site, are the remains of Bronze Age through medieval fortification walls and foundations of a settlement. A polished black vessel of the Early Bronze Age was discovered during archaeological excavations in the area. Weapons of metal and stone, tools, clay idols, numerous vessels, fireplaces and two tombs, all from the Iron Age were discovered in the vicinity as well.  Architecture  Church and Chapel = The church at Hayravank was built during the late 9th century. It is a quatrefoil cruciform central-plan structure with four semi-circular apses that intersect to create squinches for the octagonal drum and conical dome to stand above. A small chapel was added in the 10th century, accessed from the southeastern corner of the church. A single portal leads into the church from the gavit, it is believed that this entry was added between the 12th and 13th centuries. There is a second entrance through the church's exterior on its south side. Exterior walls of the structure differ from the construction of the rest of the complex in that rubble masonry has been incorporated into the fa√ßade. The original drum and dome had collapsed completely: their current rebuilt form dates from a restoration undertaken between 1977 and 1989. = Gavit = The gavit is located west of and adjacent to the church and was added in the 12th century. A main portal leads into the structure from the western wall, and has an arched tympanum with a worn inscription located above the lintel. Another portal leads into the gavit from the southern wall. Two thick columns situated at the western half of the building and two semi-columns at the eastern wall support large arches and a cupola above. The cupola consists of a short octagonal drum (only seen from the interior) as well as a short octagonal conical dome above decorated with \\"Harlequin Patterned\\" stonemasonry. The pattern alternates with reddish and a lighter grayish colored tufa. This example is considered to be one of the earliest examples of polychrome decorative masonry that was to become widespread in the following centuries in sacred buildings throughout Armenia. An oculus at the peak of the dome lets light into the room below.  Gallery  Image:Hayravank ensemble.jpgMonastic complex at Hayravank.

He stayed most of his life at Shegaon, near Akola district in Maharashtra and has taken \\"Samadhi\\" there. Therefore, Shegaon has got a special significance for Maharaj and his devotees. Shegaon hosts a magnificent temple. His devotees have constructed many Gajanan Maharaj Temples in different parts of Maharashtra, India. A small temple has also been constructed at Kanhor, Kulgaon, Badlapur, Dist. Thane. The temple is situated just outside Badlapur village on a small hillock surrounded by fields and greenery all around. The natural environment around the temple is another attraction for the devotees who visit the temple. About the Temple Scenic View of the Gajanan Maharaj Temple at Kanhor. Shri Sant Gajanan Maharaj Seva Samiti was established in 1981. Shri Vitthalrao Raut gave his land for the construction of the temple. Here is how it happened. Shri Shripadrao Kulkarni was a committed devotee of Shri Gajanan Maharaj. Once in his dream he was told by Maharaj to construct a temple. Shri Kulkarni, could not think of anything else since that day. He was restless. He told this to his friend Shri Bapat. Both of them started searching for the place to construct a temple. They were told that Badlapur has some land up for sale. The land was under \\"ceiling\\" and hence could not be bought for this purpose. When Shri Vitthal Raut, Badlapur came to know about this, he decide to offer his own land for the construction of the temple free of cost. The place is situated on a small hillock just outside the village. On a backdrop of the temple, on a hill, Shri Khandoba blesses all the devotees who visit Maharaj. The place was transferred to Seva Samiti and then the construction of the temple started. The Bhumipujan was done by Shri Ganapatrao Raut (Father of Shri Vitthalrao Raut) and his wife. Whole of Kanhor participate in this ceremony with zest and enthusiasm. A small miracle happened during these times. An \\"Audumbar\\" tree grew up beside the planned location of the temple. Prakat Din utsav was regularly celebrated under this same tree since 1981. This temple was realized on Vijaya Dashami - Dasara in 1981.

The measure enacted law which prohibits courts from imposing less than a presumptive sentence for persons convicted of specified drug and property crimes under certain circumstances, and requires the Department of Corrections to provide treatment to certain offenders and to administer grant program to provide supplemental funding to local governments for certain purposes. Official Ballot Title Increases Sentences For Drug Trafficking, Theft Against Elderly And Specified Repeat Property And Identity Theft Crimes; Requires Addiction Treatment For Certain OffendersDetailed information on SB1087 from the Secretary of State BackgroundCompeting ballot measures= A similar measure, (Oregon Ballot Measure 61 (2008), proposed by Kevin Mannix, was also approved for the November election. The main differences were: 1) Measure 61 has mandatory prison time for some first time felony offenders, while SB 1087 only does so for repeat offenders 2) SB 1087 significantly increases funding for drug treatment programs, while Measure 61 provides none. 3) Measure 61 will cost $250‚Äì$400 million per two year budget cycle, while SB 1087 would only cost $140 million. If both measures pass, the one with the most votes will go into effect.OregonLive.com \\"Mannix's tough-on- crime measure will be on Oregon ballot\\", The Oregonian, April 11, 2008 =An increase in prison inmates since 1994= In 1994, Measure 11, an earlier initiative proposed by Kevin Mannix, was passed, which set mandatory minimum sentences for violent crimes. It is responsible for 28% of today's prison population. Oregon uses the highest percentage of its state budget to lock up criminals and supervise parole of any state. Oregon has seen a growth in prison inmates from about 4,000 to more than 13,500. If SB 1087 or the initiative proposed by Mannix, is passed, Oregon's prison population and percentage of state budget will become more pronounced. However, Oregon has seen an even greater drop in violent crime than the rest of the country on average since Measure 11 passed.Prisons Lock in a Chunk of Budget from The Oregonian Support Supporters include: =Organizations= * Measure 57 or The Better Way to Fight Crime Committee, which was a broad coalition of police officers, police chiefs, sheriffs, district attorneys, business leaders, teachers, parents, advocates for children and seniors and many more. * Oregon Council of Police Associations * Oregon Police Chiefs for Safer Communities * Oregon Assoc. of Community Corrections Directors * Federation of Oregon Parole and Probation Officers * Juvenile Parole Officers ‚Äì AFSCME Council 75 * AFSCME Corrections United * Association of Oregon Corrections Employees * Nominee, Oregon Attorney General, John Kroger * AARP Oregon * Stand for Children * National Association of Social Workers-Oregon Chapter * SEIU, Local 503, representing front-line workers at the Oregon Youth Authority, & 45,000 other workers * SEIU, Local 49 * Oregon Prevention Education and Recovery Association * Oregon Business Association * Oregon Education Association * Save Oregon Seniors * Oregon State Council for Retired Citizens * Advocacy Coalition for Seniors & People with Disabilities * Oregon Alliance for Retired Americans * Partnership for Safety & Justice * Elders in Action Commission * United Way of the Mid-Willamette Valley * Ainsworth United Church of Christ, Justice Commission * Community Action Relationship of Oregon * Community Alliance of Tenants * Community Providers Association of Oregon * Human Services Coalition of Oregon (HSCO) * Multnomah County Democrats * Northwest Oregon Labor Council * One Voice for Child Care * Oregon AFL-CIO * Oregon Consumer League * Oregon Health Action Campaign * Oregon Nurses Association * Rural Organizing Project * Association of Oregon Counties =Elected officials=Justices *Former Oregon Supreme Court Justice Betty Roberts Attorneys General *Oregon Attorney General, Hardy Myers Legislators *Sen.

It is a game similar to draughts and Alquerque as players hop over one another's pieces when capturing. However, unlike draughts and Alquerqe, Astar is played on 5x6 square grid with two triangular boards attached on two opposite sides of the grid. The board somewhat resembles those of Kotu Ellima, Sixteen Soldiers, and Peralikatuma, all of which are games related to Astar. However, these three games use an expanded Alquerque board with a 5x5 square grid with diagonal lines. Astar uses a 5x6 grid with no diagonal lines.General concept of Astar Astar board Goal The player that captures all of their opponent's pieces wins. Alternatively, the player that fully occupies their opponent's triangular board wins. Another way to win, is if a player can trap their opponent's pieces and thus preventing them from performing a legal move. Equipment A 5x6 square grid is used with a triangular board attached on two opposite sides of the square grid specifically on the two shorter sides of the square grid. The square grid only consist of orthogonal lines; there are no diagonal lines. Each player has 16 pieces of which one set is black, and the other is white. Game play and rules 1\\\\. Players decide who will play the black pieces, and who will play the white pieces. They also decide who will start first. 2\\\\. Players play opposite one another across the board with each player having its own triangular board. Players place all of their 16 pieces in the first four ranks of their side of the board. Therefore, each player's triangular board will be filled up with their own pieces, and on the fourth rank, the three middle intersection points are occupied. 3\\\\. On a player's turn, a piece may move (in any orthogonal direction) along a marked line onto a vacant adjacent intersection point. Alternatively, a player's piece may capture an enemy piece. The player's piece must be orthogonally adjacent to the enemy piece. The player's piece leaps over it (as in draughts), and lands on a vacant point immediately beyond. The leap must be in a straight line, and follow the pattern on the board. If possible, the piece can continue to capture in any (orthogonal) direction. It is uncertain whether captures are compulsory, but in games like Kotu Ellima, Sixteen Soldiers, and Peralikatuma, captures are compulsory. The same may be true for Astar. Since captures may be compulsory, a player's piece must continue to leap and capture enemy pieces until it can no longer do so. Captured piece(s) are removed from the board. 4\\\\. Only one piece may be moved or used to capture enemy piece(s) in a turn. 5\\\\. If a player has more than one option to capture, then the player can choose any one (and only one) of them.

The rules are simple enough to be mastered by a five-year-old, yet there is no element of chance, and experienced players can use sophisticated tactics and strategies to win. The game was first published by Parker Brothers in 1965, then by Waddingtons in 1966. The title is currently owned by Hasbro and is no longer manufactured. Play The board consists of a raised, cross shaped platform divided into squares on which the pieces move surrounded by a circular \\"canal\\". Each player has 8 pieces (or \\"men\\") and a boat of the same color which is located at one of \\"docks\\" at the ends of the cross. The initial position of all the pieces and boats is always the same. The winner is the first player to successfully move five of their eight pieces into their own boat. Players take turns to move one piece to an adjacent square in any direction (including diagonals). Pieces can move further by jumping over one or more of their own or opponents' pieces, making a series of jumps where possible. When a player jumps into their boat, all the boats are moved clockwise around the board, one quarter turn. As a result, players will often find their own boat moves away from the dock they have moved one of their pieces to, giving the game its name. Comparison with other games Although the objective of the game (moving a number of pieces from start to finish) is superficially similar to ludo, there are no dice and there is no element of luck. The movement of the pieces is determined purely by the rules, as in chess or draughts. The pieces are moved similarly to a king in chess, but the ability to extend moves by jumping over other pieces has similarities to draughts, although pieces are not eliminated during this process: it is more similar in this respect to halma or Chinese checkers. Tactics and strategy Players can attempt to predict the movement of other players' pieces, and the effect this will have on the position of the boats. Tactics include frustrating the predictions of other players by choosing not to jump into a boat when expected. This can even be done cooperatively with other players in an attempt to prevent another player from winning.

The Xianbei state or Xianbei confederation was a nomadic empire which existed in modern-day Mongolia, Inner Mongolia, northern Xinjiang, Northeast China, Gansu, Buryatia, Zabaykalsky Krai, Irkutsk Oblast, Tuva, Altai Republic and eastern Kazakhstan from 156 to 234. Like most ancient peoples known through Chinese historiography, the ethnic makeup of the Xianbei is unclear. HistoryOrigin= When the Donghu \\"Eastern Barbarians\\" were defeated by Modu Chanyu around 208 BC, the Donghu splintered into the Xianbei and Wuhuan. According to the Book of the Later Han, ‚Äúthe language and culture of the Xianbei are the same as the Wuhuan‚Äù. The first significant contact the Xianbei had with the Han dynasty was in 41 and 45 when they joined the Wuhuan and Xiongnu in raiding Han territory.Xianbei ÈÆÆÂçë In 49, the governor Ji Tong convinced the Xianbei chieftain Pianhe to turn on the Xiongnu with rewards for each Xiongnu head they collected. In 54, Yuchouben and Mantou of the Xianbei paid tribute to Emperor Guangwu of Han. In 58, Pianhe attacked and killed Xinzhiben, a Wuhuan leader causing trouble in Yuyang Commandery. In 85, the Xianbei secured an alliance with the Dingling and Southern Xiongnu. In 87, the Xianbei attacked the Xiongnu chanyu Youliu and killed him. They stripped the skin off of him and his followers and took the skin back with them as trophies. =Confederation= After the downfall of the Xiongnu, the Xianbei replaced them with a loose confederacy from AD 93. Qizhijian became the first great war-leader of the Xianbei in 121. From 121 until his death in 133, the Xianbei made regular raids on Han territory. In 145, the Xianbei raided Dai Commandery. Around 155, the northern Xiongnu were \\"crushed and subjugated\\" by the Xianbei. The Xianbei chief, known by the Chinese as Tanshihuai, then advanced upon and defeated the Wusun of the Ili region by 166. Under Tanshihuai, the Xianbei extended their territory from the Ussuri to the Caspian Sea. He divided the Xianbei empire into three sections, each ruled by twenty clans. Tanshihuai then formed an alliance with the southern Xiongnu to attack Shaanxii and Gansu. China successfully repulsed their attacks in 158. In 177 AD, Xia Yu, Tian Yan and the Tute Chanyu led a force of 30,000 against the Xianbei. They were defeated and returned with only a quarter of their original forces. A memorial made that year records that the Xianbei had taken all the lands previously held by the Xiongnu and their warriors numbered 100,000. Han deserters who sought refuge in their lands served as their advisers and refined metals as well as wrought iron came into their possession. Their weapons were sharper and their horses faster than those of the Xiongnu. Another memorial submitted in 185 states that the Xianbei were making raids on Han settlements nearly every year. The Xianbei might have also attacked Wa (Japan) with some success.\\"Nomads in Central Asia.\\" N. Ishjamts. In: History of civilizations of Central Asia, Volume II.

Paris: UNESCO Publishing, pp. 155-156.SGZ 30. 837‚Äì838, note. 1. =Decline= The loose Xianbei confederacy lacked the organization of the Xiongnu but was highly aggressive until the death of their khan Tanshihuai in 182. Tanshihuai's son Helian lacked his father's abilities and was killed in a raid on Beidi in 186. Helian's brother Kuitou succeeded him, but when Helian's son Qianman came of age, he challenged his uncle to succession, destroying the last vestiges of unity among the Xianbei. Qianman was unsuccessful and disappeared soon after. By 190, the Xianbei had split into three groups with Kuitou ruling in Inner Mongolia, Kebineng in northern Shanxi, and Suli and Mijia in northern Liaodong. In 205, Kuitou's brothers Budugen and Fuluohan succeeded him. After Cao Cao defeated the Wuhuan at the Battle of White Wolf Mountain in 207, Budugen and Fuluohan paid tribute to him. In 218, Fuluohan met with the Wuhuan chieftain Nengchendi to form an alliance, but Nengchendi double crossed him and called in another Xianbei khan, Kebineng, who killed Fuluohan. Budugen went to the court of Cao Wei in 224 to ask for assistance against Kebineng, but he eventually betrayed them and allied with Kebineng in 233. Kebineng killed Budugen soon afterwards. Kebineng was from a minor Xianbei tribe. He rose to power west of Dai Commandery by taking in a number of Chinese refugees, who helped him drill his soldiers and make weapons. After the defeat of the Wuhuan in 207, he also sent tribute to Cao Cao, and even provided assistance against the rebel Tian Yin. In 218 he allied himself to the Wuhuan rebel Nengchendi but they were heavily defeated and forced back across the frontier by Cao Zhang. In 220 he acknowledged Cao Pi as emperor of Cao Wei. Eventually he turned on the Wei for frustrating his advances on another Xianbei khan, Sui. Kebineng conducted raids on Cao Wei before he was killed in 235, after which his confederacy disintegrated.L√º, Jianfu [ÂëÇÂª∫Á¶è], 2002. Tu zu shi [The Tu History] ÂúüÊóèÂè≤.

The third century saw both the fragmentation of the Xianbei state in 235 and the branching out of the various Xianbei tribes later to establish significant empires of their own. The most prominent branches were the Murong, Tuoba, Khitan people, Shiwei and Rouran Khaganate. Xianbei peoples subsequently pushed their way inside the Great Wall of China and established an extensive presence in the Sixteen Kingdoms (304‚Äì439), Northern Dynasties (386‚Äì581),Ma, Changshou [È¶¨Èï∑Â£Ω] (1962).

Since 1975 there is also a regional office in Bolzano for the German-speaking population of South Tyrol, Italy. The regional studios produce their own state radio, broadcast in the whole state. These regional radios are in the √ñ2 group. The regional studio in Carinthia also produces the ORF Radio Dva. For television, each regional studio produces its own news with weather for the state, which are broadcast in their state simultaneously on the TV channel ORF2. Every Sunday at 6:30pm, one regional studio gets chosen to produces an ‚Äû√ñsterreich Bild‚Äú, which shows the highlights of their state to the rest of Austria. Similar topics are also covered in the show ‚ÄûErlebnis √ñsterreich‚Äú, Saturdays at 5:05pm, where the regional studios contribute with articles and interviews. Each regional studio has its own web portal on the internet, providing recent news for their state. The regional studios also play a part in the national news and shows. For the nationwide news show ‚ÄûZeit im Bild‚Äú, articles get sent directly to the ORF Center in Vienna, ready to be broadcast. For some shows like ‚ÄûThema‚Äú or ‚ÄûDer Report‚Äú, the moderator from Vienna travels to the different places in Austria, and the regional studio of the state involved only provides a camera team or equipment. The headquarters of each regional office is always in the capital of the state, except in Vorarlberg, where the headquarters are in Dornbirn, the largest city of Vorarlberg. Even though the ORF Center is located in Vienna, Vienna also has its own independent studio, which is located in the Funkhaus Wien. Every regional office has a regional director, and all regional studios and offices were built by the same architect, Gustav Peichl, so all buildings look similar.

On 18 May 1807 he sailed her to the Mediterranean, where he proceeded to cruise off Corfu in the early stages of the Adriatic campaign. Herald attacked French shipping off the island and later in the year cruised off the Dardanelles before returning to the Adriatic off Otranto, attacking a number of coastal merchant vessels with success. On 25 October 1807, Herald was off Otranto when she found an armed trabaccolo anchored under the fortress. Despite resistance, Herald's boats cut out the vessel, which turned out to be the French privateer C√©sar, armed with four 6-pounders. C√©sar was sailing from Ancona to Corfu with a cargo of rice and flour. All but four of the crew escaped. Herald suffered four men wounded. In January 1808 Commander George Jackson took command. Herald operated off the Italian coasts, capturing or destroying numerous French and Italian merchant ships during the year.

To the west it extends up the ridge known as Fat Hill (), including Kamen≈°ƒçica (or Kamni≈°ca) Hill (461 m) and Kopavnik (or Strmec) Hill (377 m). To the east it extends to the hamlet of ≈Ωeje. Name Podsmreka was attested in historical sources as Sand Mertein 'Saint Martin' in 1414 and sand Mertten pey der Tannen 'Saint Martin by the fir tree' in 1448, among other transcriptions. The name Podsmreka is derived from a prepositional phrase in which the noun has lost its case ending: pod 'below' + smreka 'spruce'. The name therefore means 'below the spruce (forest)' and, like similar names (e.g., Podsmreƒçje, Smreƒçno), originally referred to the local vegetation.Bezlaj, France. 1995. Etimolo≈°ki slovar slovenskega jezika, vol. 3. Ljubljana: Slovenska akademija znanosti in umetnosti, p. 276. The name can also be found spelled Podsmereka in some sources.Lesjak, Anton. 1893. Zgodovina dobrovske fare pri Ljubljani. Ljubljana: Blasnik, pp. 14. Locally the village is also known as ≈†martno 'Saint Martin' because of the local church.Dobrova parish site In the past it was known as Podsmerek in German. History On 18 November 1942 Italian forces killed a number of hostages from the neighboring settlement of Dra≈æevnik below Kamen≈°ƒçica Hill. The economy of the village was traditionally tied to vegetable production, raising livestock, and dairy farming for the market in Ljubljana. Church St. Martin's Church Saint Martin's Church in the village is a chapel of ease. It was first mentioned in written sources in 1414.Slovenian Ministry of Culture register of national heritage reference number e≈°d 1775 It was remodeled in Baroque style after a fire in 1749. It formerly belonged to the Parish of Saint Peter in Ljubljana, but was reassigned to the Parish of Dobrova in 1785. The altars are of unknown age and were reworked by the sculptor Leopold Gecelj in 1872. At the end of the 19th century the church possessed two chalices, one dating from 1573 and another of presumably equal age. The bell tower of the church was octagonal until 1856, when it was torn down and rebuilt larger for a new bell. The walled area around the church probably contained a cemetery at one time because the parish church in Ljubljana was too far away and the nearest cemetery, in Dobrova, was in another parish.Lesjak, Anton. 1893. Zgodovina dobrovske fare pri Ljubljani. Ljubljana: Blasnik, pp. 111‚Äì113. The main altar was created by the stonemason Alojz Vodnik from Podutik in 1902.

Construction  After the opening of the Zwiesel‚ÄìGrafenau railway in 1890, new possibilities arose for the transportation of logs by rail from the woods around the Gro√üer Rachel, one of the highest hills in the Bavarian Forest. At the suggestion of the senior forestry commission officer, Leyth√§user, who was elected in 1890 to the government of the province of Lower Bavaria, forestry staff began to lay a narrow gauge railway from the state railway station at Spiegelau in 1900 under their own steam. The official authority to build a permanent forest railway was given on 26 August 1908. At that time, a 7 kilometre long section already existed. In November 1909 the official test run took place on the line, now 17.5 km long, in the presence of officials from the Regensburg railway division. Also in 1909 the first two steam locomotives were delivered. In 1911 the main route reached Mauth, 32 kilometres away. Now a side branch was built towards the Rachel site office. The First World War and the post-war period interrupted further expansion. During the 1920s the network was extended towards Klingenbrunn station and, by 1926, there were 41 kilometres of line and 5 kilometres of sidings. After the hurricane devastation of 1927, work intensified and a line was built to the forest railway terminus at Finsterau. In the early 1930s the Spiegelau Forest Railway reached its greatest extent with 95 kilometres of permanent way. As new railway sections were now built, old ones were lifted. The last extension of the railway network was as late as 1951 with the construction of a 7 km long stretch to the Scheerh√ºtte by 156 emergency workers. In 1953 the highest point in the network was finally reached at just under 1,000 metres, opening up a 700 hectare area of the forest.  Operation  The Spiegelau Forest Railway transported logs to the loading areas at Spiegelau or at Klingenbrunn, where they were loaded onto standard gauge track and dispatched in the direction of Zwiesel. The lines were very steep and winding. Tracks were laid on robust railway embankments. Tracks were frequently lifted at a particular site, loaded onto a train and relaid elsewhere. At the Betriebswerk in Spiegelau the forestry commission built a locomotive turntable in the early 1920s. At Sagwassers√§ge there was a wye track and Klingenbrunn had a terminal loop. As well as logs the railway also carried part-load goods, especially food, to the remote villages of Gugl√∂d, Waldh√§user und the Graups√§ge. In 1930 the record load was transported: 118,119 cubic metres of logs, 40,491 stacked cubic metres of laminated wood and 2,127 tonnes of part-load goods. From the 1920s the locomotive fleet comprised about 7 permanent locomotives, painted green with yellow outline stripes. From 1926 there were also diesel locomotives. The Forest Railway had a total of 12 locomotives, of which 5 were steam, 4 were diesel und 3 petrol- electric locos. At the peak of operations in 1932 it had 355 log wagons (Trucks) and 47 other wagons. In winter railway traffic ceased due to the amount of snow.  The end  After the Second World War the Regensburg federal railway division, who were responsible for construction standards, demanded that the railway was overhauled, which would have cost about 500,000 marks. Because the construction of forest roads and transportation of logs by road vehicles was cheaper, on 21 September 1957 the Regensburg Forestry Department ordered the dismantling of the Spiegelau Forest Railway by 1960. In 1955 the Forest Railway still owned eleven locomotives 182 Trucks and 23 special wagons. In 1957 the tracks were lifted in favour of forest roads. Farewell rides were laid on for the local population. On 11 May 1960 the last train ran; on 8 September the last track was lifted.  Today  The locomotive shed at Spiegelau station is still there. Several former railway embankments form the base for walking trails or vehicle tracks. Some have been uncovered again by the Bavarian Forest National Park. Early on there were attempts by railway fans to reactivate the Spiegelau Forest Railway as a museum railway. In addition there is a permanent exhibition about the Forest Railway at the information centre in Spiegelau. A Forest Railway locomotive and three wagons are also displayed in the village centre. Since 10 August 2003 a short Feldbahn section has been built at Riedlh√ºtte by the Feld- und Waldbahnverein Riedlh√ºtte (Riedlh√ºtte Field and Forest Railway Society). This has since been regularly operated. It is however a completely new line, which was built alongside the former Forest Railway trackbed in the village centre.

During 1993‚Äì1996, he studied at Cheltenham School of Art, where he gained a First Class BA Honors degree in fine art painting.McLean, Pauline (1997), \\"Drawing on Myths & Legends ‚Äì With A Dog on the Loose\\", Western Mail, 24 May 1997, p. 8. During his time at Cheltenham, Payne was granted a place on the ERASMUS programme at the Athens School of Fine Arts.

It is the center of the Upper Grada≈°ƒçica Valley.Dobrova‚ÄìPolhov Gradec municipal site Name Polhov Gradec was first mentioned in written records under the German name Pilchgrez in 1261 (Pilchgraez in 1269, and simply Graetz in 1291; cf. modern-era German Billichgr√§tz). All of these are derived from the Slovene name for the settlement, with the last element ‚Äëgr√§tz derived from Slovene gradec 'little castle'. The first part of the name is derived from a personal name, Polh or Povh; the name therefore means 'Polh's (little) castle'. The name Polh is, in turn, probably derived from the zoonym polh 'dormouse'. An alternative theory, considered less likely, derives Polh from the name Pavel 'Paul'.Snoj, Marko. 2009. Etimolo≈°ki slovar slovenskih zemljepisnih imen. Ljubljana: Modrijan and Zalo≈æba ZRC, p. 318. A folk legend offers a more fanciful, but unfounded, explanation of the name of the settlement. According to the legend, which is reproduced in material for tourists, a traveler once spent the night at Polhov Gradec Castle. When he woke up in the morning he found that the dormice had eaten his horse's saddle and bridle, causing him to exclaim, \\"To ni Gradec, temveƒç Polhov Gradec!\\" ('This isn't a castle, it's a dormouse castle!').The Blagaj Trail (tourist brochure) History The area has been inhabited since Roman times and a Roman villa has been excavated near the town, finds from which are kept in the National Museum of Slovenia.National Museum of Slovenia site A court was established in Polhov Gradec in 1478, which was placed under the jurisdiction of the sovereign in 1474. In 1515 the area was engulfed in a peasant uprising. A part-time school was established in 1820 and a regular school in 1852. The first school building was built in 1859. Polhov Gradec Manor Polhov Gradec Manor () is a large mansion in the settlement. The manor was first mentioned in written sources in 1315. The manor was purchased by Mark Anton Kunstl von Baumgarten in 1658. Kunstl was elevated to the position of Baron of Billichgr√§tz in 1684, and the manor's Neptune Fountain was created under Kunstl's ownership.Polhov Gradec Manor: History of the Manor At the beginning of the 19th century ownership was assumed by the Ursini Blagaj family.Technical Museum of Slovenia: History of Polhov Gradec Castle In 1875 Janko and Luiza (Altmann) Urbanƒçiƒç from Preddvor purchased the estate, after which it was owned by their daughter Ana Urbanƒçiƒç Delago. The Delago family was forcibly deported to Austria by the Yugoslav Secret Police (OZNA) on 18 December 1945 and the manor was then nationalized and plundered.Interview with Jo≈æica Kavƒçiƒç The building housed an elementary school from 1952 to 1969, and was then left to decay until the 1990s, when renovation started. In 1999 it was declared a cultural monument of national significance, and in 2008 management of the estate was transferred to the Technical Museum of Slovenia.Polhov Gradec Manor at the Dobrova‚ÄìPolhov Gradec municipal site Since 2008, the Museum of Post and Telecommunications resides there. Birth of the Virgin Mary Church The parish church in the town is dedicated to Birth of Mary. It is mentioned as an independent parish in documents dating to 1292. It originally belonged to the Patriarchate of Aquileia and since 1461 it has been part of the Archdiocese of Ljubljana. The actual church building dates to 1736, after the old church burned in 1728 and had to be completely demolished.

McDonagh joined the team during the 1992-93 National League and was a regular member of the starting fifteen until his retirement prior to the start of the 2004 championship. During that time he won two Munster medals and one National Hurling League medal. McDonagh was an All-Ireland runner-up on two occasions. At club level McDonagh was a one-time county club championship medalist with Bruree. Playing careerClub= McDonagh played his club hurling with Bruree and enjoyed some success in a career that spanned almost twenty-five years. Having played in and lost the county final of 1994, it would take twelve years before McDonagh lined out in his second championship decider. As captain of the team he led his club men against club kingpins Patrickwell. Bruree took an early lead by trailed by two points at the interval. A 49th-minute goal eventually helped the team to 1-16 to 1-15 victory. It was a first championship medal for McDonagh. =Inter-county= McDonagh joined the Limerick senior hurling panel during the 1992-93 National League and made his debut against Galway in the quarter-final of the competition. The following year McDonagh became a regular member of the starting fifteen as Limerick qualified for the Munster final. Provincial whipping boys Clare were the opponents and a rout took place. A 0-25 to 2-10 score line gave Limerick the win and gave McDonagh his first Munster medal. Limerick subsequently qualified to meet Offaly in the All- Ireland final. It looked as if McDonagh's side were going to make history and claim a first title in twenty-one years as Limerick had a five-point lead with as many minutes left. Offaly suddenly sprang to life following a Johnny Dooley goal from a close-in free. Following the puck-out Offaly worked the ball up the field and Pat O'Connor struck for a second goal. The Offaly forwards scored another five unanswered points in the time remaining to secure a 3-16 to 2-13 victory. It was a bitter blow for Limerick who looked as if they had one hand on the Liam MacCarthy Cup. Two years later in 1996 McDonagh was back in the provincial decider. Limerick faced Tipperary on that occasion and looked to be heading out of the championship as Tipp took a ten-point lead. McDonagh's side battled back to secure a 0-19 to 1-16 draw and a second chance to defeat their near rivals. The replay also saw Tipperary take a decisive lead, however, Limerick's goal-scoring ability was the deciding factor. A 4-7 to 0-16 score line gave Limerick the win and gave McDonagh a second Munster medal. The subsequent All-Ireland final pitted Limerick against Wexford for the first time in over forty years. The game was far from a classic; however, it did provide excitement. Tom Dempsey was the hero of the day as he scored a goal after nineteen minutes to give Wexford a major advantage. His side led by 1-8 to 0-10 at half-time in spite of having √âamonn Scallan sent off. Wexford took a four-point lead in the second-half; however, this was whittled back to two points as Wexford hung on for the last twenty minutes. The final score of 1-13 to 0-14 provided Limerick with a second All-Ireland defeat in three seasons. Limerick bounced back immediately in 1997 by defeating Galway by 1-12 to 1-9 to take the National Hurling League title. It was McDonagh's sole winners' medal in that competition. The recent All-Ireland defeats, however, seemed to have damaged the team as Limerick crashed out of the provincial championship at an early stage. This process repeated itself over the next few years and it was 2001 before McDonagh lined out in another Munster final. Tipperary were the opponents on that occasion, however, Limerick fell by 2-16 to 1-17. McDonagh was now in the twilight of his career and success seemed as far away for Limerick as it did when he joined the panel. After failing to make an impact on the panel under new manager Pad Joe Whelehan in 2004, McDonagh decided to retire from inter-county hurling after a National League game against Galway.

In the past it was known as Rosore in German.Intelligenzblatt zur Laibacher Zeitung, no. 141. 24 November 1849, p. 21. The name Razori is a plural form of the common noun razor 'dead furrow'. The name probably does not refer to agricultural activity, but is instead metaphorical, referring to split or fissured terrain. Cultural heritage Wayside shrine in Razori A wayside shrine in the form of a large wooden crucifix stands in the center of the village, near the intersection of the road to Brezovica pri Ljubljani with the road from Dobrova to Ljubljana. The inscription on the plaque at the base of the crucifix reads Na kri≈æu visim in zate . 1898 ('I hang on the cross and I suffer for you. 1898.') The crucifix has been registered as cultural heritage.Slovenian Ministry of Culture register of national heritage reference number e≈°d 17189 History At the beginning of July 1942, Italian forces burned several buildings in the village.

It is located on the Murray River in the twin cities of Albury-Wodonga on the Victoria/New South Wales border. In partnership with the Victorian Department of Education, the students/young artists in years 3‚Äì9 attend the selective entry Flying Fruit Fly Circus School where they undertake academic studies to complement their circus training, which is uniquely incorporated into the curriculum. The Flying Fruit Fly Circus regularly performs in Australia and internationally at major arts centres, regional theatres, corporate events and festivals. History The Flying Fruit Fly Circus was one of the productions of the Murray River Performing Group, initially an ensemble of nine artists, set up mostly by graduates the Victorian College of the Arts Drama School, including Robert \\"Bomber\\" Perrier, who was the artistic director from the outset, Lloyd Suttor, Mark Shirrefs and Ian Mortimer (Mort). The group began full-time operations in 1979, the International Year of the Child. Within four months the group had conducted workshops and performed in over forty venues, written two shows, performed street theatre directed by Mort, organised 171 circus training sessions and produced the first Flying Fruit Fly Circus event involving 117 performers aged from seven to seventeen. Mark Shirrefs and Ian Mortimer went to local schools and introduced skills to local kids, some of whom are still active in circus, Michael Ling has spent 18 years with Circus Oz.Perrier, Robert, Finding an Audience: The Murray River Performing Group, Meanjin, Vol. 41, No. 1, Apr 1982: 29‚Äì38 In 1979 On the Outside, a show about unemployed youth, was designed as a full-scale theatrical performance for high school. Lloyd Sutler, the Murray River Performing Group's resident writer, wrote the script. Performed inside an octagon made of three-inch agricultural piping on a big yellow mat, the show involved a mixture of naturalism, Brecht and satire. In the same year Heap, written by Mark Shirrefs was performed by Mark, Boris Conley, Mort for the upper three grades of Primary School. Lloyd Sutter and Mark Shirrefs also worked with local writers Dotty Simmons and Barbara Connyngham. Three of the pieces developed by this work were produced in 1979 and 1980. Mort continued teaching a small group in the craft of street theatre as sidewalk circus, these included Michael Ling, Mark Barlow (Strauss) Cathy and Herby, and many others. The second annual Flying Fruit Fly Circus event, in 1980, was seen by Chris Brookes, a Canadian playwright who visited at the suggestion of the Community Arts Board of the Australia Council. He suggested taking the Circus to the Vancouver Children's Festival in 1981. At that time the administration of the group was carried out by a core of five people with John Paxinos coming in as administrator. There was a performing group, responsible for writing and performing pieces for set venues. The next group was the clown group headed by Mort, for community involvement, instant theatre and schools. Finally, there was the semi-autonomous Flying Fruit Fly Circus. The Flying Fruit Fly Circus was the most durable of the activities and has sustained to the present day. Following the successful Canada event at the Vancouver Children's Festival in 1981 there were successful seasons in Melbourne, Albury and Benalla. Tanya Lester won a Gold Medallion in Le Cirque de Demain Competition in Paris. In 1982 she was the recipient of the ‚ÄòYoung Australian of the Year‚Äô title. In 1982 the Nanjing Acrobatic Troupe of China undertook a training project in Albury Wodonga with Flying Fruit Fly Circus performers, Circus Oz and other physical theatre artists. The outcome was the show The Great Leap Forward. In 1984 on behalf of the company, artistic director Robert \\"Bomber\\" Perrier won the BHP Pursuit of Excellence Award in Arts and Literature. In 1989‚Äì90, after 10 years of operation, Flying Fruit Fly Circus performed at the Sydney Festival, the Melbourne International Comedy Festival, Geelong Performing Arts Centre and were invited to join the nationwide tour of the Great Moscow Circus. The Flying Fruit Fly Circus represented Australia at Australia Week in Veneto, Italy and were awarded the Ros Bower Award for Outstanding Contribution to Community Arts. In 1993 a sell-out season of Red Alert for the Sydney Festival (and half-time entertainment for the World Series Cricket) was followed by tours to Brisbane, Gippsland and Melbourne. In 1997 the Flying Fruit Fly Circus performed at the Melbourne Summer Live concert, the Fashion Spectacular and Moomba. In 1999 the Circus Festival transferred from its usual base in Tasmania to Albury Wodonga, where Flying Fruit Fly Circus's Outburst! performed. The Gift opened in New York, selling out a five-week season over Christmas New Year. In 2009, 30 years on, Flying Fruit Fly Circus performed The Promise at the Sydney Festival and Albury. Federal Minister Peter Garrett announced $3.75m government contribution to redevelop Flying Fruit Fly Circus training space. In 2010 a major touring exhibition Step Right Up! The Circus in Australian Art developed through a partnership between Albury City and the Flying Fruit Fly Circus toured nationally from early 2010 through to January 2011 at venues including Mosman Art Gallery, Horsham Art Gallery, Port Pirie Regional Art Gallery, Bunbury Regional Art Gallery and Lake Macquarie City Art Gallery. The exhibition featured paintings, drawings, photographs, sketchbooks, prints and sculptures by Tom Alberts, David Archer, Monique Auricchio, George Baldessin, Dorrit Black, John Brack, Robert Campbell, Margaret Cilento, Ray Cook, Robert Dickerson, Vincent Drane, Graeme Drendel, Ian Fairweather, Cedric Flower, Donald Friend, Joe Furlonger, James Guppy, Ponch Hawkes, Euan Heng, Petrina Hicks, Lorraine Jenyns, Warren Langley, Nerissa Lea, Michael Leunig, Stewart MacFarlane, Noel McKenna, Kevin Mortensen, John Olsen, Alexander Seton, Andrew Sibley, Jeffrey Smart, David Strachan, Albert Tucker, Ken Whisson, Arthur Wicks, Fred Williams, Anne Zahalka and Salvatore Zofrea.

In Australia the circus regularly performs at festivals including the Melbourne Festival, Melbourne International Comedy Festival and Sydney Festival. Special appearances include the 2000 Sydney Olympics Opening Ceremony and Cultural Festival and the closing Ceremony of the XVIII Melbourne Commonwealth Games in 2006. The Flying Fruit Fly Circus is currently the resident youth circus at Sydney Opera House and has an ongoing partnership with the Arts Centre Melbourne and other key performing arts venues around Australia. In 2014 the company celebrated 35 years with sell-out seasons at Sydney Opera House, Melbourne International Comedy Festival, a major nine-week tour to VIC, NSW and QLD, performances and workshops at the Barunga Festival in NT and Lorne Festival in VIC and a re-connection with the landmark cultural exchange that changed the face of contemporary circus in Australia, Nanjing Project III, in a collaboration with NICA and the Melbourne Festival. A new weekend festival of circus and theatre was launched, BORDERVILLE, to celebrate the legacy of the Flying Fruit Fly Circus and neighbours HotHouse Theatre and the region's culture. In 2015 it became a company in residence at Sydney Opera House with a three-year partnership and established a collaboration with the Vietnam School of Circus Arts and Vaudeville in Hanoi.Tahlia McPherson, (21 October 2014), Fruit Flies plan Vietnam exchange in international first, Border Mail, Albury- Wodonga It also travelled to Turkey for a two-week engagement in Istanbul as part of the Australia in Turkey Festival.

The concentration of brown bears (Ursus arctos) in the Carpathian Mountains of central Romania is largest in the world and contains half of all Europe's population, except Russia.A.G.V.P.S. (National Romanian Association of Sport Fishing and Hunting)  History  August Von Spiess, Director of the Royal Hunts, after a Carpathian bear hunt, 1930s. Remnants of hunting implements and wild game bones in Stone Age dwellings and burial sites or animal cave paintings like ones in Cuciulat, Pe»ôtera cu Oase or Pe≈ütera Muierilor indicate the humans have been hunting in Romania for thousands of years. In the Mesolithic age, antlers and animal skulls were used for jewelry and burial sites, and the bow began common and hunt for all game types begun. The Dacians, ancient inhabitants of present-day Romania, adopted the wolf (Canis lupus) as a symbol and carried wolf heads and skins on poles as totemic battle flags. Ancient Greek and Roman chronicles also mention hunting as an occupation. The medieval chronicle Descriptio Moldaviae recorded that Moldavia, one of the three historic provinces of Romania, was founded by Prince Dragos in 1351 while hunting. He was chasing an aurochs or a wisent (European bison), who gored and trampled his favorite dog, a bitch named Molda, across his lands of Maramure≈ü. After killing the aurochs, impressed with the riches and beauty of the land, he named it after his dog, brought his people and settled the lands. The aurochs' head remains until today the heraldic symbol of Moldovans. Beginning in the Middle Ages as a passion or test of manhood, bears, wild boars and sometime stags were killed from close quarters with boar spears after being chased and bayed with dogs. Between the 16th and 18th centuries, Moldova and Wallachia paid part of their tribute to the Ottoman Empire in hunting falcons and wild animal furs, such as ermine and marten. Transylvanian rulers, like George I R√°k√≥czi (1591‚Äì1648), were ardent hunters, along with most members of the nobility. Since the 15th century, hunting reserves were established, where game was managed, monitored and sometimes introduced, such was the case of fallow deer in Romania. While nobility hunted all range of game and used horses, hounds, weapons and falcons for hunting, the common folk and peasants often hunted only the hare, on foot, relying on spears, slings, maces, pitchforks, throwing axes and snares. The few peasants that lived off hare hunting were known as rabiteers (iepurari). But poachers (braconieri) illegally hunted all species. Punishments for hunting in royal forest were severe; poachers could be sentenced to death. Aurochs became extinct after disappearing from Romania in 16th or 17th century. The last wisent hunt took place in 1762 in Moldavia and 1790 in Transylvania, and wisent are now confined to total protection in three of Romania's national parks or reserves after its reintroduction from Poland. Around the same time moose and beavers started to disappear from northern Romania. When Transylvania was part of Austria‚ÄìHungary, it was a popular hunting destination for the Hungarian nobility; some, like the resident lords like Baron Franz Nopcsa and the Teleki, Sz√©ch√©ny and N√°dasdy families, who owned large estates maintained only for this purpose. Trophies at the Museum of Hunting, Sibiu. Wolvers (lupari) engaged in old wolf hunting (luparia), seeking the large bounty of money offered per wolf, as these animals caused destruction to livestock. Wolves' fur was also prized as a material for dolmans and winter coats (sube). In 1855, in Transylvania alone, 842 wolf heads were turned in for the recompense. During the interwar period, shepherds used strychnine to control the wolf population, causing an ecological catastrophe. This technique failed to control the wolf population but did contribute to the extermination of the griffon vultures (Gyps fulvus); the last one was shot in 1929, while flying over the FƒÉgƒÉra≈ü Mountains. The black vulture (Aegypius monachus) was next to disappear. Until World War I, nobility and gentry indulged in large hunts. In 1901, a party of Count Geza Szecheny killed 28 brown bears in three weeks in Transylvania. Another 22 bears were killed by a parallel hunting party.Barclay, Edgar N. Big Game Shooting Records, p. 227. Realising that game can only be preserved through protection and education, in 1931, Romania established the world's second-oldest hunting museum, in the Royal Park, Bucharest under King Carol I supervision; unfortunately, in 1940, the museum was destroyed by a large fire. In 1935, by royal decree, the Retezat National Park is created, it was the country's first of its kind. Once Romania declared its independence in 1877 and the Hohenzollern dynasty was established, hunting became a royal sport; royal hunting ch√¢teaus and chalets were created on every hunting domain and people employed were appreciated accordingly. Hohenzollern- dynasty kings were taught from childhood to hunt. King Ferdinand I was a fine hunter; film footage from a 1924 bear hunt of his remains. The Foisor hunting chateau was the king's original summer residence in the Carpathians, before the Pele≈ü Castle was used for royal summer vacations. In the 19th century, Romania emerged as a major European hunting destination, notably for its Carpathian stag, chamois and bears. Royalty and world's finest or wealthiest hunters came to Romania in pursuit of big game in the Carpathian Mountains. Sir Samuel Baker visited in 1858 to 1859 together with Maharaja Duleep Singh and Frederick Courteney Selous came in 1899. Other visitors included King Edward VII of the United Kingdom, Rudolf, Crown Prince of Austria, King Paul of Greece and even today, kings like Juan Carlos of Spain are amongst the visiting hunters. Colonel August Von Spiess chose to remain in Romania, only to become Director of the Royal Hunts under King Ferdinand I of Romania in 1929. Many of the country's most notable writers and poets, including Mihail Sadoveanu, Ionel Teodoreanu, Eugen Jianu, Ionel Pop, Demostene Botez, Octavian Goga, C. Rosetti-Balanescu, I.Al. Bratescu-Voine≈üti, Nicolae Cristoveanu, were passionate hunters. Some figures, like Mihai Tican Rumano, Dimitrie Ghica- ComƒÉne≈üti, or Transylvanian-born Hungarian count S√°muel Teleki have undergone extensive safaris and explorations both in Romania and abroad. World's foremost trophy record book of Rowland Ward mentions Romanian lands as provider of world records for stag (by local and foreign sportsmen), chamois (by Frederick Selous) and Eurasian lynx (by the Prince of Liechtenstein). Between World War II and the fall of the communism, big game hunting was extremely limited, and permits were granted almost entirely to the Communist Party members, particularly after 1972. The most famous of all was none other than Romanian former dictator Nicolae Ceau»ôescu. For years, he was dubbed as \\"country's first hunter\\", a title he acquired after claiming many trophy animals including world record European brown bear, but the sportsmanship of his methods is subject to debate and generally shunned upon. In total it is estimated that Ceau≈üescu received a total of 270 gold medals, 114 silver medals and 34 bronze medals according to CIC (Conseil International de la Chasse et de la Conservation du Gibier - International Hunting and Game Conservation Council) for the trophies he presented in exhibit. Many other communist presidents like Todor Zhivkov (Bulgaria) in October 1976 and 1980s, Leonid Brezhnev (USSR) in November 1976, Erich Honecker (East Germany) in February 1977, Nikita Khrushchev (USSR), Gaddafi (Libya) and in particular Josip Broz Tito (Yugoslavia) hunted in Romania at Ceau»ôescu's invitation and used many of the designated hunting chalets and chateaux domains like LƒÉpu≈üna or Scrovistea for big game hunting. Between 1955-1989 it is unofficially estimated that Ceau»ôescu's hunting parties shot over 4000 brown bears. Starting in 1966, he also introduced mouflons as game animals at Neguresti, Timi≈ü and Scrovistea but the numbers remain very low. After the fall of the communism, hunting returned to normal and was promoted, and foreign hunters also started to come. The country is now an international destination for sportsmen. One of these was King Juan Carlos of Spain, who in 2004, at Covasna, bagged five bears, two wild boars and a wolf, while football star Roberto Baggio went for rabbit drive hunts in BƒÉrƒÉgan. Furthermore, Romanian former prime minister Adrian NƒÉstase is the chairman of the national hunting association and a spokesman for the rights of hunting. Other politicians and former prime ministers, like Petre Roman, Teodor Mele≈ücanu and Gheorge Maurer, or artists like Mircea Dinescu, Ludovic Spiess, and Octavian Andronic were also hunters. Romanian-American gymnastics legend B√©la K√°rolyi is also an aficionado, hunting worldwide. = Romanians and their hunting traditions = Hunting Lodge in Mure≈ü County. Throughout the 19th and 20th century, the box- lock or open hammers 12 or 16 gauge, side-by-side double shotgun was the most common hunting firearm of all. Traditionally the hunters and game wardens wear dark green clothing of thick felt, and fedora or trilby hats. More and more, traditional clothes are giving way to modern camouflage, and they may sadly soon be obsolete. Decorative hunting pins are extremely prized for Romanian hunters in their sporting hats, which depending on the wealth or type of hunter can range from a simple fresh branch of fir tree or pine to animal hair brushes or pheasant chest feather fans; the most expensive are usually silver cased badger and boar bristle tufts or capercaillie feather fans. In Romania, hunting is regarded as a privilege, not a right, and is surrounded by a nostalgic and romantic aura as people pursue it as a noble passion, complete with certain rituals like botez vanatoresc or tablou vanatoresc. Tradition dictates that in big game hunting, in respect for the game and hunt, a tablou (English: image or painting) must be created, where all game is lined up for inspection, cleaned up as much as possible, with small pine branches in their mouths, in a photographic pose and by the hunting master, together with the other hunters and their guns, and photographs are taken as a memory. Less strictly, a tablou is also required if more than two people are hunting rabbit, pheasant or upland game in general. Also, according to tradition, the hunting master asks for forgiveness from the dead animal by kneeling and the successful hunter receives a little branch dipped in the animal's blood as badge of recognition; other rules like never stepping or mounting on a trophy are also part of the ethics. A \\"hunter's baptism\\" (botez vanatoresc) is performed for a novice hunter by his fellows when he kills a type of game for the first time; this consists of a mock caning with a branch, lest the hunter ever forget to respect the game or give a purpose to its killing.Bear hunting, an informal \\"tablou\\" with hunters and their trophies, Romania. A toast with liquor or wine is given in the honor of the hunt, the game and fellowship of hunters. After the end of ceremonies, lavish meals and partying with folk music is to follow, according to one's wealth and mood. Ethics dictate that one should never shoot a female of anything, unless that is the predetermined quarry, or to shoot an animal while sleeping or drinking. It is forbidden to shoot waterfowl while still on the water. Over time, Romania has produced a large amount of literature on hunting, including scientific. A good amount of hunting publications, some over a century old, are dedicated solely to wildlife conservation, fishing and hunting. Most famous remains \\"Vanatorul si Pescarul Sportiv\\" magazine, a Romanian equivalent of \\"Field and Stream\\". Today, dedicated hunting museums exist, like the small Hunting Museum of Posada (Rom: Muzeul Cinegetic Posada), Prahova, hosting nationally celebrated writer Mihail Sadoveanu's collection. More known is the August Von Spiess Museum of Hunting and Hunting Arms, in Sibiu, last one of 1600 pieces, based on collections of Emil Witting (1741‚Äì1787), August Von Spiess (1841‚Äì1923) and the Transylvanian Society of Natural Sciences (Romanian: Societatea Ardeleana de Stiinte Naturale). Another collection of hunting arms is in exhibit at the Peles Castle but valuable pieces are to be encountered throughout the country in regional or natural history museums. Former chateaus and hunting lodges are still preserved and some are open to public, but most have lost their initial purpose. =Hunting legislation and agencies= Pheasant roosters are popular game. All hunting in Romania is legislated by AGVPS, or Asociatia Generala a Vanatorilor si Pescarilor Sportivi (National Association of Sport Hunters and Fishermen). This organization has its roots in the first Romanian hunters association founded around 1880 in Bucharest, and the one in \\"Hunters Club of Bra»ôov\\" in 1883, but after the Union of Romania, in 1918 some 30,000 hunters came together in a national organization. Since 1930, Romania is a founder member of CIC (Conseil International de la Chasse et de la Conservation du Gibier - International Council for Game and Wildlife Conservation), and since year 2000, a member of FACE (Federation of Associations for Hunting and Conservation of the EU). AGVPS is active under the jurisdiction of ROMSILVA, or Department of Forestry. They have local clubs (named ocol silvic in Rom.), well organized, in every city or town and regulate hunting seasons and harvest numbers. They are also in charge of enforcing laws against poaching and illegal logging. The common Romanian term for game warden or otherwise any forestry worker is padurar (forester), while the forestry superior officer who must earn a BA diploma and superior education bears the title of inginer silvic (forestry engineer). Most hunting seasons in Romania for all big game, small game, waterfowl and upland game runs from mid-autumn to late winter. The minimal wild boar and fallow deer rifle caliber in Romania is 6.5√ó57mm Mauser, while going up to 7x57mm Mauser for red stag and 7x64mm for brown bear. Using shotguns for wild boar is permitted, but forbidden for red stag and brown bear. Currently, all foreign hunters are welcomed to Romania and can hunt all species under out of country tariffs and regulations. Problems like poaching, ethics, and habitat shrinking are subjects of heated debates.  Big game hunting  Big game species include the apex predators brown bear (Ursus arctos), wolf (Canis lupus) and European lynx (Lynx lynx). Species of ungulates include the chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra), red deer (Cervus elaphus), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), fallow deer (Dama dama), wild boar (Sus scrofa) and mouflon (Ovis aries musimon). Transylvanian Bloodhounds, Fox Terriers and Airedale Terriers are used to hunt wild boar. Hounds are rare and Greyhounds are non-existent in the hunting field in Romania; yet the Transylvanian Bloodhound is a breed of hunting dog developed by the Hungarian ethnics of Transylvania, Romania, centuries ago but internationally registered as a Hungarian breed. Bear hunting (vanatoare de urs): Romania has the highest number and density of brown bears in Europe and is one of the only few countries to allow its hunting. According to CIC, the world record Eurasian brown bear trophy skin (687.79 CIC points) was shot in Romania in 1985, and for the skull trophy, Romania has 2nd place (69.30 points), while 1st place (70.0 CIC points) was shot in Kamchatka, Russia. Around 250 permits are issued yearly for two bear hunts: fall season (Sep. 15 - Dec. 31) and spring season (Mar. 15 - May 15). Methods used are spot and stalk, waiting, game drives and under special permit, over bait; anything else, like trapping, shooting from blinds or elevated stand or use of archery are illegal. Recommended are large caliber rifle magnums, with a 7x64 mm minimum necessary. Good populations are in Gurghiu, Vrancea, FƒÉgƒÉra≈ü and south-east Carpathians. In Romanian hunting tradition, bear baculum is regarded as unconventional trophy. Chamois hunting (vanatoare de capre negre) in Romania ranks as one of the world's finest, in both specimens‚Äô quality and level of challenge. According to the CIC, Romania accounts for the top world record chamois trophy at 141.1 CIC points, shot in FƒÉgƒÉra≈ü in 1937, and unbeaten since, along with other seven of the world's top ten trophies. Capra neagra (black goat) or capra de munte (mountain goat), or how Romanians call these animals, are confined solely to the alpine regions of the south and eastern Carpathian Mountains, living summers above and winters under the timberline. Hunting in such rugged terrain, such wary animal, with very keen senses, makes it very demanding, tiresome and suited only for the fittest and experienced sportsman; chamois hunting is comparable to that of Eurasian ibex or North American mountain goat. The only methods used are stalking and waiting; any use of dogs or drives with beaters are strictly forbidden. The only weapon allowed for hunting chamois is rifle, with a 5.6x50 mm caliber coefficient or better. Most successful shots are long range, made from scoped bolt-action or express rifles. A special permit must be obtained by both hunters, foreign or domestic, in order to pursue this animal, in a hunting season of a month or so, opened each year around mid-October. Roe deer is a small type of European deer. Stag hunting (vanatoare de cerbi) refers to three species cerb carpatin or Carpathian stag (Cervus elaphus hippelaphus), caprior or roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and cerb lopatar or fallow deer (Dama dama). The most prized remains the red stag (Cerbus elaphus hippelaphus) the largest of the subspecies whom will refer to hitherto. With good numbers, and of fine quality, Romania possessed many times the world record, last of which, between 1981‚Äì1985, with a trophy of 261.25 CIC, points, taken in Soveja, Vrancea County, in 1980. Current national record is 264.51 CIC points, taken by Ronald Philipp on 22 Sep. 2003 in Valea Gurghiului, Mure≈ü County. Inside hunting preserves, trophies are known to get even bigger, due to controlled feeding and protection. Hunting is done during an open season between 15 Sep. - 15 Dec., with a doe season extending until Feb. 15; methods use are by stalking or by waiting, with or without call (boncanitoare). Harvesting can be legally done only with the rifle, 7 mm caliber minimum, or more. Conventional trophies are the skull with antlers or shoulder mount but unconventionals are skin, the \\"pearls\\" (false canines), mane hair and the Hubertus Cross. Places generally acceptated as providing best trophies are Valea Gurghiului, Valea Frumoasei Wild boar hunting (vanatoarea la mistret) (Sus scrofa) is the most common big game sport in Romania; wild boar is often used for meat as well as for trophies (conventionally the male tusks only, but also shoulder mounts, female tusks, silver hat pins with boar bristles or hair or even skins and rugs). Hunting season for wild boar opens August 1 and closes February 15, but where considered varmints or pests, they can be shot any time of the year, with AGVPS approval. Methods used are waiting and stalking, but most popular are chase with dogs, usually terriers and scent hounds. Drives, where beaters drive the game to shooters waiting in stands who take shots at the running game, are also popular. Wild boar drives may include other animals as well, including red deer, roe deer, rabbits, foxes, wolves, and even bears, leading to staggering numbers of game. In his infamous drives, ex-tennis champion and billionaire Ion ≈¢iriac shot, together with his party (including Prince Dimitrie Sturdza, Wolfgang Porsche), each year, on the Balc hunting domain, in Bihor district, 185 boars in 2005, 186 boars in 2006 and a record of 240 wild boars in 2007 in single drive hunts.\\"Cotidianul‚Äô‚Äô newspaper (14 Jan. 2007) article in Romanian language: \\"Vanatoarea lui Tiriac: 240 de mistreti.‚Äô‚Äô or use direct link to read all article: http://www.cotidianul.ro/vinatoarea_lui_tiriac_240_de_mistreti-20515.html National record for wild boar (tusk trophy) is of 144.0 CIC, points. Most boars taken are weighing between 300-400 lbs., with sometimes old, solitary males up to 600 lbs.  Furbearers and small game hunting  Wolf (Canis lupus) was historically hunted and still exists in large numbers, available even today. Wolf populations remain strong with an estimated 4000 heads as of 2005, allows wolf hunting (vanatoare de lupi). The season is between September 15 and March 31. Hunters use snow tracking, stalking, calling, and driving with beaters. Firearms used are shotguns with slug or minimal 5 mm pellet or rifle of 5.6 mm caliber bullet or better. Trophies are considered the skin (rug mount) and skull. Since 1997, Romania has the International Council for Game and Wildlife Conservation (CIC) world record of wolf skin (186.17 points), and a national CIC skull record of 45.30 points. The red fox, like badgers (Meles meles) are pursued with dogs, such as Dachshunds, Fox Terriers and Jagdterriers, who are used to chase critters even in their burrows. Fox hunting (vanatoarea de vulpe) is also featured in Romanian literature and folk tales, where the cunning of the fox is a common theme. Small game furbearers are plentiful in Romania and usually hunted with the aid of dogs and snow tracking. Species include European badger (Meles meles), European hare (Lepus europaeus), European pine marten (Martes martes), beech marten (Martes foina), European polecat (Mustela putorius), ermine (Mustela erminea) and weasel (Mustela nivalis). A rare animal is the marmot (Marmota marmota). Otter (Lutra lutra) can be found in the Danube Delta and other marshlands, and is hunted in winter, over iced rivers, at the breathing holes and with dogs, tracking through snow. In the same region, European mink (Mustela lutreola), muskrat (Ondatra zibethica), and raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides) may be seen. Rabbit hunting (vanatoarea de iepuri) is among the most common type of hunting. The open season is from November 1 to January 31. Virtually every hunter takes up this sport, using walking and stalking (la picior) with pointer dogs or through drive with beaters (goana). Forbidden techniques are waiting and night hunting. Firearms used are shotguns with pellets size 3‚Äì4 mm and rimfire rifles. It is not uncommon to see hundreds of beaters are used during drive hunts for rabbit, or others.  Bird hunting  Popular upland game birds include common pheasant (Phasianus colchicus), grey partridge (Perdix perdix), common quail (Coturnix coturnix), Eurasian collared dove (Streptopelia decaocto), turtle dove (Streptopelia turtur), woodcock (Scolopax rusticola), and starlings (Sturnus sp.). Other hunted birds include hazel grouse (Tetrastes bonnasia), wood pigeon (Columba palumbus), skylark (Alauda arvensis), thrushes (Turdus sp.). Among the most sought-after game birds in Romania is the capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus), a large turkey-like bird, which have a significant presence in the country. It is hunted during mating season, on snow, when the male becomes deaf and blind to all things around him and can be stalked. Beside taxidermy mounts, unconventional capercaillie trophies are the 400-1000 gastroliths, or gizzard stones. Waterfowl hunting also exists in Romania. Sixteen species of duck are present although only the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), the common teal (A. crecca) and the garganey (A. querquedula) are commonly encouraged. Two geese species are important as waterfowl game in Romania: The greater white-fronted goose (Anser albifrons) and the greylag goose (A. anser). Other species are hunted, like Eurasian coot and cormorants. Shooting waterfowls with lead pellets is forbidden due to toxicity if ingested by other species. The carrion crow (Corvus corone) and magpie (Pica pica) are hunted without restriction or season regulations as pests. On the other hand, birds like golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) and bustards (Otis tardus) have been hunted to the brink of extinction and are now completely protected. Common bird dogs are the German Shorthaired Pointer, German Wirehaired Pointer and Setters. Waterfowling retrievers such as the Cocker spaniels and Labradors are used for waterfowl.  In cuisine  Wild game meat has always been popular with Romanians and Romanian cuisine. A large number of inns, pubs, and restaurants in the country serve menus partially or entirely based on wild game dishes, and specialised chefs are catering to both local and international crowds. Some popular choices are: wild boar platter (mistret la tava), bear stew with wild mushrooms (tocanita de urs cu ciuperci), wild boar stew (tocanita de mistret), bear paw (laba de urs), venison medallion (medalion de caprioara), venison sausage (carnaciori de caprioara), rabbit with olives (iepure cu masline), ember roasted quail (prepelita la jar) and pheasant soup (supa de fazan). Some of the most famous restaurants serving wild game in Romania are: Cornul Vanatorului (The Hunter's Horn) in Pite≈üti, Burebista Vanatoresc (Hunter Burebista) and Hanul Vanatorului (Hunter's Inn), both in Bucharest and Cabana Vanatoreasca (The Hunting Cabin) in Sinaia. Their dishes do not necessarily come cheap but many are willing to pay the price tag for such, while supply and demand is well balanced.

Celesbianism as a Western media phenomenon came into vogue in 2008, when several female celebrities presented themselves as lesbians. The term was first used by New Yorkers Pam Franco and Susan Levine, a disk jockey. It was used in a full-page ad in a lesbian nightlife magazine, GO MAGAZINE. The ad was for the Mz Hip and Fit NY contest, the idea of Denise Cohen of Denco Designs & Events. The contest was a search for the hottest lesbian in the United States. The term celesbian was used for the celebrity lesbian judges.  Fauxmosexual  In contemporary mass media, the term has come to mean a female celebrity who claims to be a lesbian, either explicitly or implicitly ‚Äî often to get publicity. She may or may not really be homosexual. A term similar to this second sense of celesbian is fauxmosexual, combining faux (false) and homosexual, in which case the celebrity may be either male or female. Some LGBT activists have objected to the fauxmosexuality phenomenon, saying it trivializes real homosexuals, both in presenting homosexuality as an \\"outrageous\\" novelty, and in glossing over the serious issues faced by young people struggling to come to terms with their homosexuality.The dangers of fauxmosexuality Tim Duggan, The Sydney Morning Herald, October 10, 2008.

In August 2015, The Austin Chronicle covered Camila Grey's and Kate Moennig's performance at Austin Pride. Kate Moennig plays Shane in The L Word and Lena in Ray Donovan. Ellen DeGeneres publicly came out as a lesbian in 1997 on The Oprah Winfrey Show. When asked by host Oprah Winfrey, \\"Why did you think it was necessary for you to come out?\\" Ellen replied, \\"Because it's okay.

He began life in an insurance office, but gave up his secular work and studied for the ministry, with the aim of becoming a missionary: his background was formed by followers of Robert and James Haldane. Weak health prevented his accepting a missionary appointment, and he then became minister of a small congregation in Edinburgh, known as \\"English Baptists\\", at the Charlotte Chapel. He held this post until shortly before his death. Anderson was interested in the Scottish Highlands, and was a founder of the Gaelic School Society. He established the independent Edinburgh Bible Society. He supported the Serampore mission in India, travelled to explain its objects, and collected funds on its behalf. Anderson died on 18 February 1852. New York University would have sent him a diploma, but he refused it. At his death he left a collection of early English bibles. Charlotte Chapel, Edinburgh today Works Anderson published two memorials on the diffusion of the Scriptures in the Celtic languages; and, in 1828, a volume of Historical Sketches of the Native Irish. His major work was the Annals of the English Bible. It is now regarded as ethnocentric. On 4 October 1835, the tercentary of the publication of the first complete English Bible by Myles Coverdale, Anderson published a sermon on The English Scriptures, their first reception and effects, including Memorials of Tyndale, Frith, Coverdale, and Rogers.

Geography Ables Springs is located at in northeastern Kaufman County. It is situated along FM 429, approximately ten miles northeast of Terrell. The community, as well as all of Kaufman County, is part of the Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington Metropolitan Statistical Area. History Land in the area was granted to Ezekiel Ables by the state of Texas in 1848. Five years later, Ezekiel's son James and his wife Eliza settled there. A freshwater spring that later contributed to the community's name, ran through the area. Mr. and Mrs. Ables deeded an plot to a Methodist Episcopal Church in 1878. A tabernacle, church, and school were later constructed on the land. A separate portion was also set aside for a cemetery. For many years thereafter, Ables Springs was a center for local religious and school activities. The community remained small as surrounding towns, particularly Terrell, grew. The spring that once served as the community's primary water source eventually ran dry as a result of overuse and development of a nearby rock quarry. The lack of water caused area officials to seek out other sources to serve Ables Springs. On November 1, 1979, the Ables Springs Water Supply Corporation was commissioned.Ables Springs WSC History ‚Äì Ables Springs Water Supply Corporation. Retrieved 12-24-2008. It continues to serve the area's water needs to this date. Incorporation attempt In early 2007, a group of Ables Springs residents began researching what it would take to incorporate the community. Citing Kaufman County's rapid population growth and the desire to preserve the small, close-knit atmosphere of Ables Springs, organizers gathered the necessary number of signatures needed to place the issue on a ballot. The election was held on May 12, 2007. Of the 102 valid votes cast, 40 (39.22%) voted in favor of incorporation while 62 (60.78%) voted against the proposition.

The band was formed in 2008 by frontman Michael Crafter, who is best known as the former lead vocalist of metalcore bands I Killed the Prom Queen, Carpathian and Bury Your Dead. They have released one EP entitled Can't Live, Can't Breathe, and three albums: Cancer, The Long Way Home and \\"Life And Death\\" on Resist Records. Vocalist Michael Crafter made a social media post on 7 January 2019 that stated, ‚ÄúMARCH 23 2019 MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA‚Äù, which is rumoured to be their return date. HistoryFormation and Can't Live, Can't Breathe (2008‚Äì2009)= Confession was started by Michael Crafter in 2008, following his Australian farewell tour with I Killed the Prom Queen. The first member that Crafter enlisted for his new band was guitarist Dan Brown, who previously played in Byron Bay based hardcore punk band 50 Lions. On 11 October 2008, the band released their first EP on Resist Records entitled Can't Live, Can't Breathe. The EP featured a cover of the Frenzal Rhomb song \\"Ship of Beers\\", as well as 7 original songs, one of which was an intro. The band promoted the EP by touring Australia with Deez Nuts, featuring Crafter's ex-I Killed the Prom Queen bandmate JJ Peters. The band also served as openers for the Sweatfest Australian Tour in December 2008, featuring Parkway Drive and A Day to Remember as headliners, as well as Suicide Silence and The Acacia Strain. =Cancer (2009‚Äì2010)= On 9 October 2009, the band released their first full-length album, Cancer, which was recorded between June-September 2009 at Adelaide's Sound House Studio. The album earned the band Blunt Magazine's Album of the Year award. Following the release of Cancer, the band headlined their first Australian headlining tour in October-November 2009, with many local Australian metalcore and hardcore bands supporting them. Before the recording of the album, the band parted ways with drummer Matthew Owens and bassist \\"Borgs\\". Shane O'Brien was soon added as the band's drummer, with bass duties being handled by guitarist Dan Brown who decided to switch from guitar to bass so it would ease on him to sing clean vocals. Tyrone Burke of Hiroshima Will Burn joined the band as his replacement on guitar and toured the band on the Sick Summer Tour supporting Parkway Drive in January-February 2010, though he was kicked out of the band later in 2010 after stealing money from the band. Kevin Cameron (ex-I Killed the Prom Queen) temporarily replaced Burke on guitar, until Dan Brown decided to return to his guitar duties, bringing Jamie Hope of The Red Shore to fill-in for him on bass. In March- April 2010, the band played their first tour outside of Australia: a European tour supporting For the Fallen Dreams. After playing with the band for the Keeping it Bogan Tour, Jamie Hope was replaced by Byron Carney of 50 Lions. Though, Byron stay with the band was short and as the band was without the bassist at the time, Dan Brown was forced to return to bass duties and the band played as a 4 piece for a while, before ex-The Red Shore bassist Tim Anderson joined the band. In July 2010, the band played on the Youngbloods Tour in support of The Amity Affliction, and in August, they have toured in support of House Vs. Hurricane on the Escape to OZ Tour. In October-November 2010, the band once again headlined an Australian tour with local hardcore bands as support acts, =The Long Way Home (2010‚Äì2012)= In November the band headed to Dan's home town of Byron Bay and started writing the new album at the Parkway Drive house. The band felt this was the best place to write the new album. Just so happened Parkway was away and the Gordon family was happy to let Confession set up in the basement to write the new album. These sessions lasted 3 weeks. December 2010, the band played 5 dates as part of the No Sleep Til Festival, alongside such bands as Megadeth, NOFX, A Day to Remember, August Burns Red, Alkaline Trio and more.\\\\ In April 2011, the band flew to Gothenburg, Sweden, to start recording their second studio album, with producer Fredrik Nordstr√∂m at his Studio Fredman. Recording began on 18 April and ended on 29 April 2011. Following the wrapping of the recording, the band went on a European tour supporting Swedish hardcore punk band Raised Fist, along with melodic hardcore band Hundredth, between 30 April-14 May. Between 18-28 May 2011, the band played as one of the opening acts to Parkway Drive on the Australian Mix N' Mash Tour, along with Miss May I and The Wonder Years. On 7 August 2011, the band had announced that their new album will be titled The Long Way Home, and also revealed its artwork and release date as being 23 September 2011. On 17 August 2011, the band released their first single from The Long Way Home, entitled \\"Asthma Attack\\". A tour in support of the album, entitled The Long Way Home Tour was announced to take place between 7-30 October 2011, with supporting acts Thy Art Is Murder and Antagonist A.D.. Confession opened for Parkway Drive on their 2012 European tour. The other bands on the bill were The Ghost Inside and Miss May I. =New lineup (2012‚Äì2013)= On 9 May 2012, the band announced that they had parted ways with vocalist Michael Crafter. An unaware Crafter tweeted that he was kicked out without him knowing. In a turn of events, Crafter went on the band's Facebook page, banned all the other members from accessing the account, changed the band location to Perth, Australia, and then kicked out all the band members via a Facebook post: \\"It's Crafter here. I would like to announce that the members who used to play in this band have tried to double cross me. I have now kicked out all members of the band and will be looking for legit friends to play within the band.\\" An interview with Stu on Short Fast Loud later that night would clarify the situation. The band toured Japan in January 2013. They then played the Soundwave festival across Australia, during February 2013, as well as two Sidewave shows opening for Gallows. On 19 August, the band announced on their Facebook that Doyle had left the band to focus on his solo career of acoustic covers. Confession took part in Parkway Drive's 10 Years Of Parkway Drive tour alongside Thy Art Is Murder. At one show, Andy Marsh of Thy Art Is Murder filled in on guitar while Sean Delander and Lee Stanton of Thy Art Is Murder provided guest rap and singing parts. The video of this performance was a viral hit. The band commenced working on a new full length and also took part in the Vans Warped Tour in Australia in November and December 2013 alongside The Amity Affliction, The Offspring, Parkway Drive and Hatebreed. Jamey Jasta complimented Crafter on his extensive array of camo clothing. =Life and Death (2014‚Äìpresent)= The band headed to California to record Life And Death with producer Dan Castleman at Lambesis Studios in February 2014. A new song \\"Fuck Cancer\\", using the same name as Crafter's charity work, was released on 12 May via Channel V. The video contains many cancer survivors and their families. The subject matter and video is seen as a reaction to the current vapid state of meaningless heavy music. The album was released on 20 June 2014. On 7 October 2015 Crafter announced his retirement from the band and music. A farewell-tour in Australia took place in January 2016.

The ensemble comprises a core of around 20 virtuoso musicians from Australia and around the world. Since 1986 it has maintained an active schedule of concerts, recordings, broadcasts, and music-theatre/opera, installation art and new media art performances, principally in Australia and Europe. During 2008 the ensemble presented 36 individual works, including 11 world premieres, in 18 concerts or events in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Berlin and London. Its 18th compact disc was released in 2009 (see Discography). ELISION combines its Australian perspective with a long-term exploration of complex musical aesthetics, and in so doing has developed an international reputation for Australian new music and performance practice. Paul Griffiths, in Modern Music and After, writes of ELISION \\"‚Ä¶ whose splendiferous range of colours ‚Ä¶ has produced a kind of sensuous complexity that may be uniquely Australian\\". In 2018 the ensemble toured internationally to Germany and Mexico, as well as performing in Australia in Melbourne, Brisbane, and Sydney. Aesthetics ELISION's musical aesthetic is at the complex and virtuosic end of the contemporary classical compositional spectrum. A strong element of this music is the sheer difficulty of its performance; multiple compositional layers, complex and heavily detailed musical notation pose significant interpretative challenges. Interplay between the resultant unpredictabilities and performative decisions required by complex multi-layered and paradoxical strands of information embedded in notational practice can lead to a frustration for the player, or to a fascination born of engagement in the act of \\"what it is to make music\\". The latter is a key aspect for the members of ELISION; a further is the physicality of performance, the intimate connection between the musician and the instrument. > \\"The ELISION ensemble ‚Ä¶ celebrated its 10th birthday with a characteristic > sequence of salto mortale items, proving yet again that ‚Äòimpossible‚Äô is a > relative word. Its repertoire, once relatively eclectic, has now become > sharply focused: both technically and aesthically, it specialises in ‚Äòtough > cookies‚Äô. Typically, though not exclusively, these tend to be rhythmically > highly complex, with dense webs of wide-flung micro-tonal melodies, and the > same horror of rests that one finds in Faur√©'s later chamber works. In such > a context, even a new cello solo by Stockhausen (Violoncello aus > Orchester‚ÄîFinalisten) sounded meek and mild.\\" Toop, Richard: In Sydney > Morning Herald, 2 July 1996 The ensemble has commissioned and premiered new works from Richard Barrett, Chris Dench, Brian Ferneyhough, James Dillon, Michael Finnissy, Aaron Cassidy, Evan Johnson, Timothy McCormack, Jeroen Speak, and others associated with the so-called New Complexity movement. A very long-term collaborator is Australian composer Liza Lim who has written three operas and over twenty smaller works for ELISION and its members. Other composers who have written for the ensemble include Franco Donatoni, Aldo Clementi, Karlheinz Essl, Volker Heyn, Richard Rijnvos and Australians John Rodgers, Timothy O'Dwyer, Dominik Karski, David Young, Brendan Colbert, Michael Barkl and Michael Smetanin. Cross-artform events Beyond its traditional concert-giving activity, a distinguishing aspect of ELISION's work had been the creation of new cross-artform events, combining musical performance with the visual and sonic arts,Jenkins, John and Linz, Rainer: Recent Australian Music Theatre, Redhouse Editions, 1997, pp.134‚Äì137 including new media,Kuppers, Petra: The Scar of Visibility: Medical Performances and Contemporary Art, University of Minnesota Press, 2007, pp.197‚Äì200 but particularly installation art. Examples include Opening of the Mouth (composer Richard Barrett, installation artist Richard Crow; Perth 1997), Sonorous Bodies (composer Liza Lim, video artist Judith Wright; Brisbane 1999 and Berlin 2001),Hamilton, Margaret: \\"International fault lines: directions in Contemporary Australian performance and the new millennium\\", in Playing Australia: Australian Theatre and the International Stage, Schafer, Elizabeth and Bradley Smith, Susan, editors: Rodopi, 2003 and , pp.181‚Äì187 or DARK MATTER (Barrett and Norwegian installation artist Per Inge Bj√∏rlo; Brisbane 2002 and Berlin 2003). These works stem from close collaboration between composer, visual artist, sound artist and musicians,Buckley, Daryl: \\"ELISION: Philosophy Defining and Performance Practice\\", http://elision.org.au/articles/practice/index.html and frequently occur in musically unusual locations (disused power stations, old railway workshops, backstage, galleries), and create a \\"total art work\\" aiming to envelop the audience visually as well as sonically. > \\"ELISION constructs itself not so much as a concert-performing ensemble but > as a vehicle for the creation of unique and thought‚Äìprovoking artistic > statements ‚Ä¶ ELISION projects are ones with which one mentally carries on an > argument long after the event. ELISION is a mouth.\\" McCallum, Peter: In > Sydney Morning Herald, 11 March 1997 > \\"The Welsh composer Richard Barrett entreated an excursion into the black > holes of the universe.

Beyond notated music, ELISION has also maintained a strong thread of structured improvisation performance, often within cross-artform events, such as the seven-night long Bar-do'i-thos-grol (The Tibetan Book of the Dead) (composer Liza Lim, installation artist Domenico de Clario; Lismore 1994 and Perth 1995) (described as \\"one of the most astonishing creations in recent Australian music performance\\"McGillick, Paul: In Australian Financial Review, 3 March 1995). The use of improvisation as a creative laboratory to generate sonic understandings, subsequently informing more formal processes, has occurred with composers Richard Barrett and John Rodgers, and recently in What Remains (composer/performers John Butcher and Timothy O'Dwyer; Brisbane 2007). History ELISION was established in Melbourne, Australia in 1986 by its current Artistic Director Daryl Buckley and other musicians from the Victorian College of the Arts; several founding members remain in the ensemble. While resident in Melbourne it built an international reputation, making its first European appearance in 1991. In 1996 it relocated its administrative base to The University of Queensland, Brisbane, and was a resident company at the Judith Wright Centre of Contemporary Arts in Brisbane from its opening in 2001 until 2008. ELISION has received government funding from arts councils including the Australia Council, Arts Victoria and Arts Queensland. The ensemble has also secured funding from government and private sources in Europe, particularly to commission new work. ELISION is operated by a not-for- profit incorporated association, whose membership is dominated by musicians in the ensemble. Current membership Deborah Kayser (soprano), Genevieve Lacey (recorder), Paula Rae (flute), Peter Veale (oboe), Richard Haynes (clarinet), Carl Rosman (clarinet), Timothy O'Dwyer (saxophone), Ysolt Clark (horn), Tristram Williams (trumpet), Benjamin Marks (trombone), Peter Neville (percussion), Richard Barrett (electronics), Daryl Buckley (electric guitar), Marilyn Nonken (piano), [Marshall McGuire (harp), Satsuki Odamura (koto), Graeme Jennings (violinist) (violin), Erkki Veltheim (viola), S√©verine Ballon (violoncello), Joan Wright (double bass).

The name of the neighborhood dates from the early 20th century, and is derived from the fact that the neighborhood's streets are named after islands and other geographical concepts in the former Dutch colony of the Dutch East Indies or now known as Indonesia. The first street was named in 1902. In 2003, the neighborhood had around 23,000 inhabitants. The neighborhood is bounded on the west by the railroad Amsterdam - Hilversum (with the Muiderpoort Station), on the east side by Flevopark, on the north side by Zeeburgerdijk and on the south side by the Ringvaart Watergraafsmeer. Indische Buurt is the oldest part of the former Zeeburg district and is very ethnically diverse. A high percentage of the population is of immigrant origin (for Zeeburg this is already high at 55%, but higher in the Indische Buurt) and there are an estimated 100 languages spoken. History The impetus was given to create a new residential area in the early 20th century, as Amsterdam had previously experienced large population growth. The construction of the area was well under way on the wave of economic growth that followed the completion of the North Sea Canal in 1876 and the commissioning of the Merwedekanaal in 1892. In May 1915, the tram route 14 was extended into Indische Buurt. The growth continued for some time, with an interruption in the 1930s as a result of the Great Depression. Indische Buurt was relatively isolated from the rest of the city by its position behind the railway line that runs through the area, and connects Amsterdam Centraal with Utrecht, until 1939 when Muiderpoort Station was built. One of the last bath houses in Amsterdam was built on Javaplein in 1942, which functioned until 1982. From the 1960s the Amsterdam seaport moved to the west of the city and the neighborhood became a purely residential area. Redevelopment The Javastraat in the Indische Buurt Since the mid-1990s the area has been undergoing rapid gentrification as formerly squatted buildings, as well as former student housing, are being renovated and sold. Timorplein is a particular area of focus for the area's urban gentrification, and the square's renewal was completed in 2010 with the opening of a new cultural institution which includes Studio K, housing a theater and restaurant,http://www.studio-k.nu/page=site.page/id=timorplein/ a new 'Stayokay' hostel, and the IIRE, which includes meeting and conference rooms. Another redevelopment project is 'Pompstation', near the Zeeburgerdijk tram stop, a restaurant and cafe located in a former industrial building.http://extra.volkskrant.nl/volkskeuken/recensies/pompstation_in_amsterdam In addition, one of the neighborhoods's major thoroughfares, the Javastraat, has been transformed into a new Mediterranean-style shopping area which included the repaving of streets and improved bicycle parking. In 2010, the Borneohof building was constructed on the Javaplein, which houses a large library of Amsterdam, restaurants like Het Badhuis en de Wilde Zwijnen and the gym Akademia Training. Public transport Amsterdam Muiderpoort railway station is situated in the west of Indische Buurt on the border with Watergraafsmeer. Trains to Amsterdam, Schiphol, Rotterdam, Utrecht / Rhenen and Amersfoort call at Muiderpoort. Tram routes 1, 3 and 14 have their terminus in Indische Buurt. Route 1 has its terminus at the Muiderpoort Station, and routes 3 and 14 at Flevopark. Bus routes 22, 40, 41 all have a terminus at Muiderpoort Station. In addition, bus lines 37, and 65 run through Indische Buurt.  Areas  Within Indische Buurt, several smaller areas are recognized: Ambonbuurt, Makassarbuurt, Sumatrabuurt and Timorbuurt. = Ambonbuurt = Ambonbuurt (Ambon neighborhood) is a densely populated residential area bounded by the Insulindeweg, Molukkenstraat, Valentijnkade and the railway line. The neighborhood has the second highest population density of the neighborhood after the neighboring Sumatrabuurt. The population in 2010 was approximately 4,000 people in an area of 16 hectares. = Makassarbuurt = Makassarbuurt (Makassar neighborhood) is primarily a residential neighborhood which lies in between Zeeburgerdijk, Molukkenstraat, Insulindeweg and Flevopark. The area covers 115 hectares, of which more than half is park and water. The area is densely populated and has 6,618 residents as at early 2010. The neighborhood's shopping areas include Molukkenstraat and the commercial zone around Zeeburgerdijk. Flevopark Entrance to Flevopark On the east side of Indische Buurt is Flevopark, which includes the outdoor Flevopark swimming pools. This park was planned in 1908 by naturalist Jac. P. Thijsse, who envisioned a park between the Jewish Cemetery and the Nieuwe Diep. The expropriation procedure began in 1914, and from 1921 there was money available to obtain the land suitable for building the park. In 1928, the construction of the park began. Flevopark includes the site of a Jewish cemetery. It was in use since 1714 by the Jewish Community, and there are an estimated 200,000 people buried there. It has not been in active use anymore since 1942. = Sumatrabuurt = Sumatrabuurt (The Sumatra Area) lies between Insulindeweg, Molukkenstraat and Valentijnkade. It is the most densely populated of all neighborhoods in the borough of Amsterdam-Oost. In 2010, about 3,000 people lived on an area of 14 hectares. A commercial area lies on the west side along Molukkenstraat. = Timorbuurt = Timorbuurt lies between Zeeburgerdijk, Molukkenstraat, Insulindeweg and Celebesstraat. It is densely populated: the population in 2010 was approximately 8,000, giving a population density of 14,837 per km¬≤. There are no parks in the area. The area contains the Timorplein, a cultural spot. Mostly a residential neighborhood, it contains the Javastraat, the Indische Buurt's most important shopping street.

Konni was often seen at the President's side, including at staff meetings, and when Putin greeted world leaders during their visits to Russia. Family Konni, full name Connie Paulgrave, was born in 1999 at a cynology centre located at the Ministry of Emergency Situations in Noginsk, where she was to be trained as a search and rescue dog. Konni's parents are Henrietta Bush (mother) and Alkor Ross Bradford (father). In December 2000, Konni was presented to President Vladimir Putin as a gift by Sergey Shoygu. On 7 December 2003, the day of the 2003 legislative election, Konni gave birth to eight puppies. One pup named Darina was given to a pensioner in Novozolotovka, Neklinovsky District of Rostov Oblast. Another pup, named Oscar, was given to a six-year-old girl in Smolensk. Two pups were given to the President of Austria, Thomas Klestil, as a symbol of Austrian-Russian friendship. When Klestil's widow, diplomat Margot Klestil-L√∂ffler, was appointed Austrian Ambassador to Russia in December 2009, the two dogsnamed Olya and Orhireturned to Moscow with her; Klestil-L√∂ffler stated that the dogs helped her deal with her husband's death. Another of Konni's pups was employed by rescue services in Vladikavkaz in North Ossetia- Alania. Relationship with Vladimir Putin Konni with Putin in 2001. Since Konni became part of the Putin family, she was featured largely in the life of the President, and was regularly at her master's side. In 2007, organisers of the Saint Petersburg Economic Forum, which is a regional meeting of the World Economic Forum, wrote to the Presidential Administration requesting a photograph of the President for his accreditation badge, and the Putin Administration sent back to the organisers a photograph of Putin sitting in an armchair next to a fireplace with Konni lying at his feet. Answering a question at a press conference, Putin stated that, like everyone else, he too has occasional bad moods, and explained: > \\"In those situations I try to consult with my dog Konni, who gives me good > advice.\\" Konni responded to simple commands given to her by Putin, including \\"down!\\" (lezhat!), \\"sit!\\" ( Sidet'!), \\"heel!\\" (Ryadom!), \\"go!\\" (Fas!) and \\"bark!\\" (Golos!), in addition to shaking hands. Although Konni was, for the most part, allowed to attend meetings with Putin, on occasion she was kept away from such functions. Rossiyskaya Gazeta recalled an incident in 2003, when journalists travelled to Sochi to discuss various issues with the President. Upon arrival at Bocharov Ruchei, Konni, who was described as cheerful and inquisitive, greeted the journalists. When it came time to start the meeting, Putin's security detail stopped Konni from following him. As the journalists and Putin started walking down the staircase, Konni rushed towards them and began to bark loudly at Putin. As a result, Irena Lesnevskaya, the President of REN TV, asked \\"So who else here can so bark at the President?\\". Konni, in what appeared to be an expression of dissatisfaction for not being allowed to \\"participate\\" in the meeting, then continued barking, and refused several orders by Putin to come to him, leading Lesnevskaya to ask, \\"So who else can disobey the President?\\". In the public eye In December 2004, Konni was taken to a children's New Year's Eve party at the State Kremlin Palace by Putin. While Putin was on stage giving a speech to the media, politicians and the public, Konni managed to escape from her holdings and joined her owner on stage. Konni as Putin's foreign affairs advisor in the comic strip published by Ogoniok. Konni gained fame when Detskaya Literatura, one of the oldest publishing houses and the largest publisher of children's books, published a book in 2004, entitled Connie's Stories. The 60-page book written by Irina Borisova in English, chronicles the life and adventures of a Black Labrador named \\"Connie\\"; at the end it is revealed that Connie (Konni) is the President's dog. Konni gained additional public exposure when she was present at an April meeting with Putin and President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, in Sochi. Konni's visibility in the meetings of Putin with world leaders led to the publication by Ogoniok of a satirical series of comic strips that features Konni as an advisor to Putin on matters relating to the foreign relations of Russia. Konni wearing a GLONASS-enabled collar in October 2008. In July 2006, in an online conference organised by Yandex and the BBC, Putin revealed that Konni ate two to three times a day and had a penchant for porridge with meat. During the same online Question and Answer session, Putin reiterated a request that he had previously made on his website for people not to feed Konni, stating: > \\"Sometimes, Konni leaves a room full of journalists with a very pleased > expression on her face and biscuit crumbs around her mouth... Please do not > feed my dog.\\" In December 2007, Sergey Ivanov updated Putin on the progress of the Russian Global Navigation Satellite System GLONASS, when Putin enquired whether he would be able to buy a device hooked into GLONASS that would allow him to keep track of Konni. Ivanov advised Putin that collars for pets would be available in mid-2008. The collar was demonstrated to Putin on Konni on 17 October 2008, making Konni the first recipient of a GLONASS-enabled pet collar. Russian politics In February 2005, the We Youth Movement, a member of The Other Russia coalition, started a campaign to promote Konni for President. It was the opinion of the group that no matter who won the 2008 Russian Presidential election the operating Head of State would remain the same, and hence Konni would make the best candidate. Georgy Satarov, a key member of The Other Russia, believed that if Putin were to have endorsed Konni as his successor, then 40% of the electorate would have voted for the Labrador, given that 40% of the people would have voted for whomever Putin endorsed for the election. Russian foreign affairs Konni at a meeting with Putin and Angela Merkel. Konni became a symbol of friendly meetings between the Russian President and various world leaders, and was allowed to attend official government meetings. A popular anecdote was when the Chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel, met President Vladimir Putin, Putin brought Konni to their meetings. On 21 January 2007, the two leaders met at Bocharov Ruchei, the President's summer residence in Sochi, and at the beginning of their meeting Konni wandered into the room, leading Putin to ask Merkel, who reportedly has a \\"deep-seated fear of dogs\\", \\"The dog does not bother you, does she? She's a friendly dog and I'm sure she will behave herself.\\"Bohlen, Celestine (16 June 2014). \\"Putin Puts Tough Image Before Words\\", The New York Times. Merkel responded in Russian, a language in which she is fluent, \\"She doesn't eat journalists, after all.\\" Konni then proceeded to sniff the German Chancellor, and sat at her feet. Merkel was reported to have shown \\"apparent discomfort\\". Putin later said that, after learning of Merkel's fear of dogs, he apologized to her.\\"BILD-Interview with Russian President Vladimir Putin - Politik Ausland - Bild.de\\" \\"I wanted to make her happy. When I learned that she does not like dogs, I apologized, of course.\\" January 11, 2016 When US President George W. Bush visited Putin's residence at Novo-Ogaryovo, Konni was there to greet both leaders. Putin was reported to have remarked to the visiting President that Konni is \\"bigger, tougher, stronger, faster, meaner ‚Äì than Barney,\\" which aides to Bush said was \\"a mark of a friendship strengthened by a little needling.\\" Stephen Harper later \\"drolly noted [to Bush], 'You're lucky he only showed you his dog.'\\"Dowd, Maureen, \\"‚ÄòBlindsided‚Äô: A President‚Äôs Story\\", 6 November 2010 (7 November 2010 p. WK9 NY ed.). Retrieved 7 November 2010. At a meeting with Putin in Sochi in March 2003, and again in April 2005, President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko, who regarded Konni as a \\"friend\\", attempted to call the dog to him; however, Konni did not respond, except for yawning at the Belarusian President on several occasions, before getting up and instead going over to the journalists who had gathered to cover the meeting. Death In February 2015, it was reported in the press that Konni had died in late 2014, at the age of 15. Gallery File:Vladimir Putin and Koni-2.jpgVladimir Putin with Konni in Novo-Ogaryovo, 2002.

In ultrasonic machining, welding and mixing, a sonotrode is a tool that creates ultrasonic vibrations and applies this vibrational energy to a gas, liquid, solid or tissue. A sonotrode usually consists of a stack of piezoelectric transducers attached to a tapering metal rod. The end of the rod is applied to the working material. An alternating current oscillating at ultrasonic frequency is applied by a separate power supply unit to the piezoelectric transducers. The current causes them to expand and contract. The frequency of the current is chosen to be the resonant frequency of the tool, so the entire sonotrode acts as a half-wavelength resonator, vibrating lengthwise with standing waves at its resonant frequency. The standard frequencies used with ultrasonic sonotrodes range from 20 kHz to 70 kHz. The amplitude of the vibration is small, about 13 to 130 micrometres. Sonotrodes are made of titanium, aluminium or steel, with or without heat treatment (carbide). The shape of the sonotrode (round, square, with teeth, profiled ...), depends on the quantity of vibratory energy and a physical constraint for a specific application. Its shape must be optimized for the particular application. Sonotrodes of small diameter are sometimes called probes. For an ultrasonic welding or cutting application, the sonotrode gives energy directly to the welding contact area, with little diffraction. This is particularly helpful when vibrations (wave propagation) could damage surrounding electronic components.Design of ultrasonic devices ReferencesSee also * Horn analyzer * Ultrasonic horn Category:Sound ","title":"Sonotrode"},{"id":"20828767","text":"Jos√© Gil (born 15 June 1939 Muecate, Portuguese Mozambique) is a Portuguese philosopher. In his youth he lived in Lisbon, Portugal, but his experiences under Ant√≥nio Salazar's 1933-1974 dictatorship, made him decide to study in a free country. He moved to Paris, France where in 1982 he got his PhD from the University of Paris (Universit√© de Vincennes √† Saint-Denis) where he researched on the body as a power field under the supervision of Fran√ßois Ch√¢telet. There he assisted at Gilles Deleuze's classes whose influence on his thinking was decisive. Between 1986 and 1989 he conducted an original research project on the aesthetics of Fernando Pessoa, at the Coll√®ge International de Philosophie, where he directed a program. He wrote several books prior to 1983 but when \\"Portugal, Today: Fear of Existing\\" (Portugal, Hoje: O Medo de Existir, Lisboa: Rel√≥gio d'√Ågua) was published in November 2004, there was a massive response. The book describes, in a way considered by some to be very accurate, what is to be Portuguese and how Portuguese people perceive themselves, other people and the world, thus helping to establish what it is to be \\"Portuguese\\" and related identities. The fact that the book was a success enabled the Portuguese to share a public awareness of the problem which may be relevant to helping to solve it. The following month, December 2004, Le Nouvel Observateur named him one of the 25 Great Thinkers of the contemporary world along with Richard Rorty, Peter Sloterdijk, Toni Negri and Slavoj ≈Ωi≈æek. For several years he has taught courses on aesthetics, Deleuze and Spinoza at Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Department of Philosophy. He also writes for several Portuguese and foreign magazines. The academic year 2008/ 2009 brought his teaching career to an end. In 2008 he has published two books: one on Deleuze's philosophy (The Imperceptible Becoming of Immanence/ O Impercept√≠vel Devir da Iman√™ncia, Lisboa: Rel√≥gio d'√Ågua); and a second one, a fictional work, \\"At noon, the birds\\" (ao meio-dia, os p√°ssaros, Lisboa: Rel√≥gio d'√Ågua).

Background Serhiy Fedorovich Tkach (also spelled Sergey) was born on 15 September 1952 in Kiselyovsk, Russian SFSR, Soviet Union. He served in the Soviet Army, and according to neighbours he claimed to be a veteran of the Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan. Tkach worked as a police criminal investigator in Kemerovo Oblast, where he was recommended for admission to a Ministry of Internal Affairs school until he was caught falsifying evidence and forced to resign. Afterwards Tkach worked numerous different jobs before moving to the Ukraine SSR in 1982, where he began working again as a police criminal investigator in the Dnipropetrovsk region. Murders In 1984, young women and girls began to noticeably disappear across Kharkiv Oblast, Zaporizhia Oblast, Dnipropetrovsk and Crimea in eastern Ukraine, near where Tkach lived and worked. He targeted female victims, aged between 8 and 18, who would be raped, suffocated, and after they were dead performed sex acts on their bodies. Tkach used his police knowledge to mislead others investigating his killings, such as choosing victims near railway lines recently treated with tar to throw police dogs off his scent. Arrest, conviction, and imprisonment In August 2005, Tkach attended the funeral of one of his victims, where children who were also attending claimed to have seen him with the victim shortly before her death. Tkach was arrested at his home in Polohy and admitted to his crimes, claiming to have killed over 100 people until his arrest, and demanded the death penalty. After a one-year trial, in 2008 a tribunal in Dnipropetrovsk sentenced him to life imprisonment for the murder of 37 women and girls over more than two decades. Over the years 15 men were wrongly jailed for some of the murders of which Tkach was found guilty, one of whom committed suicide, and another was not released until March 2012.Innocent Man Spends 7 Years In Prison, Kyiv Post (12 April 2012) A 2018 Netflix documentary titled Inside the World's Toughest Prisons revealed that Tkach fathered a child while in prison with a woman in her twenties who became infatuated with him after reading an interview in the media. She went on to marry Tkach in 2015, who was allowed conjugal visits according to human rights provisions. Death Serhiy Tkach died in the Prison No. 8 of Zhytomyr, where he served his sentence, on November 4, 2018, at 7 p.m. local time. The cause of death was heart failure. Tkach was buried on November 7 by the prison staff as none of his relatives had claimed the body.

Early life and education Sharafkandi was born on 1 January 1938, in Bukan, West Azerbaijan, Iran. He spent two years of his elementary studies in his native village, then his family moved to Mahabad, where he completed his primary and secondary education. In 1959, he received his degree in chemistry at the Institute of Higher Education in Teheran. Career After graduation, up to 1965, Sharafkandi taught chemistry in the Kurdish towns of Bukan and Mahabad. Because of his political activities, he was transferred first to Arak, then to Karaj by the Shah's regime, before being appointed assistant lecturer in chemistry at the Teachers‚Äô Higher Training College in Teheran. In 1972, he went to France to study at the University of Paris VI, where he received his Ph.D. in analytical chemistry in 1976. While studying in Paris in 1973, he met Dr. Abdul Rahman Ghassemlou, the Secretary-general of the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan (PDKI), and joined the Party. Upon his return to Iran, he became Ghassemlou's representative in his country. In 1976, he went back to Iran to teach at the Teachers‚Äô Higher Training College in Teheran. After the fall of the Shah's regime in February 1979, he resigned from his position and joined the reawakening Kurdish movement, which in August became the target of a ‚ÄúHoly War‚Äù decreed by Ayatollah Khomeini. In February 1979, after the fall of the Shah's regime, the PDKI's activities became illegal. Dr. Sharafkandi was elected alternate member of the Central Committee and appointed as the Party's official in Teheran. During the summer of 1979, he became a permanent Party cadre and in 1980, during the following Congress, he acceded to the Political Bureau. From then onwards, up to the assassination in July 1989 in Vienna of Dr. Ghassemlou by Iranian emissaries, he was regularly re-elected and put in charge of the Party's publications. In 1986, he also took office as assistant Secretary-general of PDKI. After Ghassemlou's assassination, he temporarily took over the Party's leadership until December 1991, when he was unanimously elected Secretary-general during the IXth Congress.

On 17 September 1992, Iranian-Kurdish insurgent leaders Sadegh Sharafkandi, Fattah Abdoli, Homayoun Ardalan and their translator Nouri Dehkordi were assassinated at the Mykonos Greek restaurant in Berlin, Germany. In the Mykonos trial, the courts found Kazem Darabi, an Iranian national who worked as a grocer in Berlin, and Lebanese Abbas Rhayel, guilty of murder and sentenced them to life in prison.

It is a tributary of the Yarra River. For tens of thousands of years it was used as a food and tool source sustainably by the Wurundjeri people, Indigenous Australians of the Kulin nation, who spoke variations of the Woiwurrung language group. The creek begins in the hills north of Ringwood on the boundary of urban metropolitan Melbourne where it flows for roughly 2‚Äì3 km through Park Orchards and around 4 km through Warrandyte before emptying into the Yarra River. The creek is relatively uninhibited by weirs, dams or reservoirs and it floods often after heavy rain. It provides habitat for significant species, which includes amongst others; platypus, rakali, koalas, powerful owls, rufous night herons, white-winged choughs and yellow-tailed black cockatoos. Gold was first discovered in Victoria in Andersons Creek near the present day Warrandyte State Park and the township of Warrandyte was initially named after the creek.

Her father Gerard Murail is a poet and her mother, Marie-Th√©r√®se Barrois, a journalist. One of her brothers and her younger sister also write: and Elvire Murail, aka Moka. The music composer Tristan Murail is her older brother. In 1973, she married Pierre Robert, an INSEE bureaucrat, with whom she had three children, Benjamin (1977), Charles (1987) and Constance (1994).  Itinerary  She was born in Le Havre. Murail has been writing since she was thirty six years old. After modern literature studies at the Sorbonne University ‚Äì concluded with a thesis devoted to adapting classical novels for children ‚Äì she earned her \\"stripes\\" at the Editions mondiales, where she published a hundred short stories in women's magazines (Intimit√©, Nous Deux) between 1980 and 1987. In the mid 1980s, her two first novels (for adults) were published by Swiss publisher Pierre-Marcel Favre: * Passage (1985) * Voici Lou (1986) Since her first story, \\"C'est mieux d'√™tre bleu\\", published in 1985 in the Astrapi magazine, she has written over 80 books for children, most notably three series, \\"Emilien\\", \\"Nils Hazard\\" and \\"L'Espionne\\". Most of her books were published by L'Ecole des Loisirs, Bayard and lately by Pocket. ;The \\"Emilien\\" series Murail directs Emilien Pardini, a boy aged fourteen at the beginning of the series, who lives alone with his mother Sylvie. The various books follow him throughout his teen years. Murail exploits all the dramatic and comical resources of a contemporary single-parent family. * Baby-sitter blues (1989) * Le Tr√©sor de mon p√®re (1989) * Le Clocher d'Abgall (1989) * Au bonheur des larmes (1990) * Un s√©ducteur n√© (1991) * Sans sucre, merci (1992) * Nos amours ne vont pas si mal (1993) The series was republished in the Neuf collection (2006). ;The Nils Hazard series Alongside the \\"Emiliens\\", Murail initiates an adventure series in which Nils Hazard, an etruscologist and teacher at the Sorbonne University, assisted by ex-student Catherine Roque, now his secretary and girlfriend, has to solve detective plots. * Dinky Rouge Sang (1991) * L'assassin est au coll√®ge (1992) * La dame qui tue (1993) * T√™te √† rap (1994) * Sc√©nario catastrophe (1995) * Qui veut la peau de Maori Cannell? (1997) * Rendez-vous avec M. X (1998) ;Fantasy Murail widens the range of her production, exploring a slightly fantastic daily life first in \\"Ma vie a chang√©\\" (1997), staging a librarian struggling with a domestic elf, then definitely delirious when this daily life mixes with vampires (\\"Amour, vampire et loup-garou\\", 1998) or aliens (\\"Tom Lorient\\", 1998). In 2002, teenagers' craving for video games inspired \\"Golem\\", where virtual reality bursts in the real world. Golem was also a three-person writing experience. Brother and sisters expressed, each in their own way, how they felt about it (see the writer's website). Marie-Aude led another writing project with her brother Lorris during the following year (\\"L'exp√©rienceur\\", 2003). * Ma vie a chang√© (1997) * Amour, vampire et loup-garou (1998) * Tom Lorient (1999) * L'exp√©rienceur (written with Lorris Murail) (2003) * Golem (written with Elvire and Lorris Murail) (2002) \\"Golem\\" begins when Majid Badach, a young boy who lives in Hummingbird Tower on the Moreland estate, wins a computer from Priceshrinkers, apparently a trustworthy company. One of his teachers, Hugh Mullins, helps him setting it up. Only one day, while they are chatting on the Internet, a video game sets in and runs on its own: Golem. Majid's life, along with his teacher's, turn on a dime ... ;History as a source of stories After \\"J√©sus, comme un roman ...\\" (1997), Murail wrote a six-episode series published by Je Bouquine during the two last months of the second millennium. Murail plunged her readers into six different periods of History (\\"D'amour et de sang\\", 1999). She then paid homage to her favorite novelist and ¬´ heavenly father ¬ª (\\"Charles Dickens\\", 2005), and took her readers back to 19th-century England with the autobiography of a Victorian illustrator, inspired by the life of Beatrix Potter (\\"Miss Charity\\", 2008) * J√©sus, comme un roman ...(1997) * D'amour et de sang (1999) * Charles Dickens (2006) * Miss Charity (2008) ; A work that keeps diversifying Even though her readers, who have quite grown up in twenty years, often ask her about Emilien, Martine-Marie or Nils, Murail now changes time and space with each novel. Although the teen age and its route still make the very heart of her books, family, social and political considerations are now finding their way into her work. She now uses the strength of experience and current events, whether the topic is undocumented children and the necessarily enshrined school system (\\"Vive la R√©publique!\\", 2005), or a company and a kindergarten being submitted to the same imperatives of ¬´ globalisation ¬ª and ¬´ working more ¬ª (\\"Papa et maman sont dans un bateau\\", spring 2009), yet never being short of humor. Despite the seriousness of the issues in question, her ¬´ dramatic pedagogy of life ¬ª is neither bleak nor heavy : Murail thinks a fictional work intended for children has no need of sad endings. She sincerely thinks that it would be malpractice. This might be the writer's only ethical principle, driven by her characters' lives and the dynamics they imprint on her writing. Thus ¬´ life, Life ¬ª are Miss Charity's very last words. * Oh Boy! (2000) * Simple (2004) * Ma√Øt√© Coiffure (2004) * La fille du docteur Baudoin (2006) * Vive la R√©publique ! (2006) * Papa et maman sont dans un bateau (spring 2009) ; For her first readers Her first novel for young readers is a tale parody, published by Gallimard : * Myst√®re (1987) Afterwards, she wrote eleven ¬´Mouche ¬ª and two ¬´ Neuf ¬ª, published by L'Ecole des Loisirs : * Le Chien des Mers (1988) * Le hollandais sans peine (1989) * Les secrets v√©ritables (1990) * Mon b√©b√© √† 210 francs (1990) * Un dimanche chez les dinosaures (1991) * Le changelin (1994) * Qui a peur de madame Lacriz ?

(2008) * MythO (2001) * Nonpareil (2007) In addition to five short stories published by Astrapi, Murail wrote over twenty illustrated stories in monthly magazine J'aime Lire (‚Äúfrom 7 years-old on‚Äù), most of which were republished as books by Bayard. * Graine de monstre (1991) * L'oncle Giorgio (1990) * Le visiteur de minuit (1993) * Les secrets du docteur Magicus (1993) * L'or des mages (1996) * No√´l √† tous les √©tages (2001) * Il √©tait trois fois (written with Elvire Murail) (2008) ;The L'espionne series, illustrated by Fr√©d√©ric Joos, published by Bayard. * L'espionne fonde son club (2001) * L'espionne (2001) * L'espionne joue √† l'espion (2001) * L'espionne sauve la plan√®te (2003) * L'espionne arr√™te d'espionner (2003) * L'espionne allume son robot (2003 * L'espionne s'√©nerve (2003) * L'espionne se m√©fie (2004) * L'espionne veut la v√©rit√© (2004) * L'espionne cartonne (2005) * L'espionne d√©clone (2006) * L'espionne est occup√©e (2007) Je Bouquine, a magazine edited by the same publisher, often publishes her stories, longer and intended for older readers (10‚Äì15 years old). * Le d√©fi de Serge T. (1993) * Moi, le zoulou (1994) * Devenez populaire en cinq le√ßons (1995) * La peur de ma vie (2000) * Le g√®ne zinzin (2002) * Jeu dangereux (2003) * Ma√Øt√© Coiffure (2004) (also published as a book by L'√©cole des loisirs) * Le baron de Nonpareil (2006) ; For those learning to read Murail also took an interest in teaching how to read. Teamed up during five years with primary teacher Christine Thi√©blemont from Orl√©ans, then joined by educational counselor Patricia Bucheton, she wrote a reading course book for first graders, the \\"Bulle\\" textbook, published by Bordas. Murail revealed her motives and her contribution to this common experience as a children's writer in an interview that can be found on the website of La Charte des auteurs et illustrateurs jeunesse, an association she is involved in. The Bulle course book is characterized by the role given to children's literature and reading aloud in the development of infantile imagination. Murail discusses this in a video. * Bulle m√©thode de lecture pour le CP - cycle 2 (2008). ; Being a children's writer Murail has not stopped thinking, since she wrote her literature thesis, about the purpose of her work. Thereupon she wrote articles, conferences and even books. She wrote a first one in 1993, in which she drew the results of her encounters with her readership, and another one ten years later, rather dedicated to the convictions that made her, as she had already written in the conclusion of her thesis, ‚Äúremain in childhood‚Äù. From the viewpoint that has been hers since she was 25, she has nonetheless kept her readership growing, her readers staying faithful as they grow up. * Continue la lecture, on n'aime pas la r√©cr√©.. (1993) * Auteur jeunesse - Comment le suis-je devenue, pourquoi le suis-je rest√©e (2003) A recognized work Oh, Boy! is her most sold and translated book. It was adapted for television by director Thierry Binisti, produced by K'ien Productions. Most of her books received various prizes, in France and abroad, since they were exported, in Europe and beyond, and translated to about fifteen languages. Simple, Tobias Scheffel's German translation of Simple, received the Deutscher Jugendliteraturpreis, bestowed by a jury of German teenagers during the Frankfurt Book Fair. The French version had already received the Prix des lyc√©ens alllemands during the Leipzig book fair in 2006. Nowadays, Murail sells about 200,000 books each year in France. In 2004, Murail was granted the distinction of Chevalier de la L√©gion d'honneur, in recognition of her whole career.

The election was won by Democrat Judy Chu, who became the first Chinese American woman elected to serve in Congress.  Background and procedures  The election resulted from Hilda Solis's resignation to become Secretary of Labor following her confirmation on February 24, 2009. The election was called to fill the rest of her term, which ended on January 3, 2011. On March 10, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger called for the special primary election to be held on May 19, the same day as a statewide special election. If a candidate received the majority of votes in the primary election he or she would have been declared the winner and no runoff would have been held. Since no candidate won a majority, the candidates that won the most votes in each party appeared on the ballot for the general runoff election, held on July 14.  Candidates  A total of 13 candidates registered for the special election, of which only three qualified for the runoff general election. One additional candidate registered only for the general election. = Democratic = *Francisco Alonso, former Mayor of Monterey Park *Gil Cedillo, State Senator from the 22nd district *Judy Chu, member of the State Board of Equalization from the fourth district *Benita Duran, former aide to Hilda Solis *Stefan Lysenko, independent filmmaker *Nick Mostert, attorney and legislative analyst *Rafael Nadal, businessman and field representative *Emanuel Pleitez, economic advisor = Independent = *Eleanor Garcia, a write-in candidate for the general election = Libertarian = *Christopher Agrella, a businessman = Republican = *Betty Chu, a member of the Monterey Park City Council *Teresa Hernandez, a businesswoman *Larry Scarborough, a write-in candidate for the primary election *David Truax, a businessman Primary campaign The campaign to replace Solis began as soon as her nomination to Obama's cabinet was announced. State Senator (and former Majority Leader) Gloria Romero, whose 24th State Senate district overlaps the congressional district, became the first politician to express interest in running for the open seat. On December 18, 2008, the day that Solis's selection first became known, Romero said, \\"I have deep roots, and I would certainly give it every consideration. Definitely, I am interested\\". The same State Senate seat was previously held by Solis. Of the many possible contenders, Romero said, \\"I can beat them all\\". However, on January 8, Romero decided not to run for the seat, opting to try for California State Superintendent of Public Instruction instead. On December 22, Judy Chu, Chair of the State Board of Equalization, announced that she would run in the special election. She said, \\"I've decided to heed those calls [of supporters]. I know this district very, very well and I believe the people of this district know me and know I'm very devoted to the San Gabriel Valley\\". The congressional district makeup was 48% Latino and 13% Asian. She began campaigning heavily, and captured the endorsements of several San Gabriel Valley politicos. (The following month, Chu became Vice Chair of the Board of Equalization.) On January 8, 2009, State Senator Gil Cedillo announced he was running. He was endorsed by Romero once she decided not to run, and the race was largely viewed as a contest between Chu and Cedillo. Cedillo collected the endorsements of several local mayors. On January 7, the day before, Emanuel Pleitez, a 26-year-old member of the Barack Obama presidential transition team for the U.S. Treasury Department, had declared his intentions to run. A young banker who left Goldman Sachs, Pleitez is a native of the district. Pleitez ran a more grassroots campaign, relying on a steady flow of volunteers and various individuals making any contribution to his efforts. The Huffington Post said if elected, he would become the second member of the Millennial generation to serve in Congress. By late March, the Pleitez campaign had about 20 full-time staffers and many volunteers; it was also the first campaign of the 32nd Congressional district to open a campaign office, and launched a modern website before any candidate. By late January, Blanca Rubio, president of the Baldwin Park Unified School District Board of Education, also said she was running. However, she was not mentioned in subsequent press reports about the election. In late March, she said she was withdrawing from the race for family reasons and endorsed Chu. Others who had been mentioned as possible candidates for the seat included Assemblyman Charles M. Calderon, his brothers Senator Ronald S. Calderon and former Assemblyman Thomas M. Calderon (both Ronald and Thomas Calderon subsequently declined to run and endorsed Cedillo instead), Assemblyman Edward Hernandez (who subsequently declined to run and endorsed Chu instead), Chu's husband, Assemblyman Mike Eng, and former Assemblyman Ed Chavez (who subsequently declined to run and endorsed Cedillo instead). Candidates from outside the congressional district were also permitted by law. No major Republicans indicated that they would run in the special election. The Republican who were candidates were former Covina mayor David Truax, accountant Jim Hetzel, and business owner Teresa Hernandez. Hetzel and Hernandez were political newcomers, and these were the first Republicans to vie for the seat since 2002. As the only Libertarian Party candidate, Christopher Agrella, a businessman, was guaranteed to move on to any general election from the primary. Agrella said his top priorities if elected would be to bring about real government accountability, balance the federal budget by cutting out waste, and repeal the federal tax code in its entirety.http://agrella4congress.org/index.jsp [date:4/21/2009] Turnout in special elections is almost always low, and support from organized labor was seen as crucial in helping to get out a candidate's vote. On January 26, Chu received the coveted endorsement of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor. Cedillo replied that he had a long association with the labor movement and that, \\"At the end of the day, people know me as a public servant who delivers and not as a politician.\\" Somewhat ironically, all of this campaign activity had taken place before there was any official vacancy in the seat, as Solis's confirmation process was being held up in the United States Senate. Solis herself decline to endorse any of the potential replacements for her, although Chu suggested that the congresswoman would prefer her. On February 24, 2009, the special election finally became a certainty, with Solis's long confirmation process coming to a successful close. Chu formally announced her candidacy on February 27, stating, \\"It occurred to me this seat would open, and who could carry on ... [Solis's] desire to represent the constituents?\\" Cedillo formally announced his candidacy on March 7 at a rally in El Monte. The first candidates' forum was held on March 19 in Cypress Park, Los Angeles, sponsored by the Southwest Voter Registration Education Project. Only Cedillo, Chu, and Pleitez were invited. By late March, Cedillo and Chu had each raised several hundred thousand dollars and were widely viewed as the frontrunners. A fellow of the Rose Institute of State and Local Government characterized the contest by saying: \\"When people talk about this race, there's Cedillo and Chu, then there's Pleitez, and then there's everybody else.\\" Through the end of March, Chu had raised $770,000, Cedillo $568,000, and Pleitez $153,000. One political analyst commented ruefully, \\"It does not take a lot of money in these low turn out races, but that doesn't mean a lot of money isn't going to be spent.\\" By April 6, the official filing deadline for the primary, twelve candidates had filed for the race, comprising eight Democrats, three Republicans, and one Libertarian. Chu and Cedillo were still considered the front-runners, with each having raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for their campaigns. Judy Chu's task was complicated by the appearance of her cousin-in-law, Betty Chu, a Republican Monterey Park City Council member and former mayor, on the ballot as well. Benita Duran entered the race as the last candidate for the 32nd Congressional district. She was the former deputy district director for Solis' congressional office and staged a grassroots campaign for the seat.http://www.benitaduranforcongress.com/ By early May, Cedillo and Chu were battling each other via campaign mailers, with Cedillo putting out attacks on Chu that included unrelated headlines from articles about the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2010. Cedillo also put out a mailer against Pleitez that represented one of the first uses of in American politics of Facebook photographs for opposition research and negative campaigning. Cedillo's material likened Pleitez's socializing to Animal House and accused Pleitez of flashing gang signs. Chu had the endorsement of Mayor of Los Angeles Antonio Villaraigosa. While Solis herself continued to remain neutral, Solis's husband, parents, and siblings all endorsed Chu.  Primary results  In the May 19 primary, Democrat Judy Chu led all candidates, but failed to gain enough to prevent a runoff general election. Betty Chu qualified as the Republican candidate for the runoff and Christopher Agrella qualified as the Libertarian. General election campaign Not much media attention was given to the general election race due to the district's heavily Democratic lean. The San Gabriel Valley Tribune dubbed the race \\"The Chu Chu train\\" in reference to the same last names of the two major candidates, while a campaign consultant referred to it as \\"The Chu-Chu runoff\\". With expected turnout at the 10 percent level, one analyst dismissed the possible name confusion effect on voters: \\"When you‚Äôre dealing with that low of turnout, you‚Äôre dealing with a sophisticated, knowledgeable electorate.\\" Despite their relation by marriage, the two women did not know each other well nor like each other. Judy May Chu accused Betty Tom Chu of dropping her middle name \\"Tom\\" in order to play further upon the name similarity, a charge that Betty Chu sternly denied. At a June 23 debate featuring the three candidates, the two Chus presented conflicting views on term limits, the Employee Free Choice Act, and universal health care. Following the debate, while Betty Chu remained in the area, Judy Chu flew to Washington, D.C., to meet with Democratic leaders, indicating her confidence in winning the race. With the election looming, Judy Chu has actually downsized her headquarters, again signaling her confidence in winning the heavily democratic district. On the other side, Betty Chu opened a campaign headquarters, and Libertarian candidate Christopher Agrella operated his low-tech campaign out of a storage shed. While Judy Chu was considered to be the clear front-runner, she said she was not taking anything for granted; much of her campaigning involved phone calls to voters and fundraising. Betty Chu also worked to raise funds and to get her message out, telling voters that she had a great deal of experience as a long-time attorney, banker, entrepreneur, and elected official. Agrella continued to run what he called a \\"shoe-string\\" campaign, trying to get his name known in the district. A forum, sponsored by the American Legion, was held between Betty Chu and Christopher Agrella. Judy Chu was originally scheduled to participate but dropped out to do a fundraiser. Judy Chu also did not attend a forum sponsored by Looking Green, leading to the cancellation of the forum, since the remaining candidates felt it was unnecessary due to their similar positions on the issues. The Judy Chu campaign explained their reason for not attending was to spend the last days of the campaign contacting voters and making sure they show up for the election, which was expected to have low turnout. Fundraising reports indicated that Judy Chu had raised $1.3 million from individuals (constituting about three-quarters), PACs, and unions. The amount was more than expected and budgeted for the race by the campaign. The campaign indicated that $1 million was spent in the primary, and $200,000 spent in the general election. Betty Chu spent around $75,000 on efforts to get her name known in the district with billboards, mailers, and TV ads. Much of the spent monies were personal loans. The Betty Chu campaign missed one filing deadline with the Federal Election Commission. With turnout expected not to be higher than 10%, or 25,000 or so votes, both Chus were working to ensure their constituents turned out on election day. The general election was considered less relevant than the primary by the voters, with the Judy Chu campaign acknowledging that many of the voters they had talked to thought the primary in May was the end of the election. While Judy Chu was pushing to ensure loyal Democrats come to the polls, Betty Chu worked to get Republicans, unmotivated to show up by the district's Democratic tilt, to flock to the polls and perhaps pull off a long-shot upset. Over 10,000 absentee ballots were filed, with about half from Democrats, a third from Republicans, and the remaining from unaffiliated voters.

He is the current manager of the Roscommon county football team. He is the only manager to lead a football team and a hurling team to provincial titles in two different provinces. Born in Peterswell, County Galway, Cunningham was raised in a hurling stronghold in the south of the county. He was a two-time Connacht medallist at colleges level with Our Lady's College while simultaneously joining the St. Thomas' senior club team. Cunningham made his debut on the inter-county scene at the age of fifteen when he first linked up with the Galway minor team. An All-Ireland-winning captain in this grade, he later captained Galway to an All-Ireland title with the under-21 team. Cunningham joined the senior panel during the 1983-84 league. He went on to play a key role for Galway in attack during a hugely successful era, and won two All- Ireland medals and one National Hurling League medal. He was an All-Ireland runner-up on four occasions. As a member of the Connacht inter-provincial team, Cunningham won four Railway Cup medals between 1986 and 1991. Throughout his inter-county career he made 15 championship appearances. Cunningham retired from inter-county hurling following the conclusion of the 1993 championship. Equally adept as a coach of both hurling and Gaelic football, Cunningham's first position as manager of the Roscommon senior hurling team was an unsuccessful one. In 2006 he took charge of the St. Brigid's football team, guiding them to back-to-back championship titles. Cunningham later guided Garrycastle to an All-Ireland appearance having already secured a Leinster title and three successive championship titles. In 2009 Cunningham was back as an inter-county manager with the Galway under-21 hurling team. A successful tenure, culminating in the winning of the All-Ireland title, led to Cunningham being appointed manager of the Galway senior team on 27 October 2011. He has since gone on to lead Galway to two All-Ireland final appearances and a Leinster title. He was manager of the Galway senior team from 2011 to 2015. Playing careerMinor and under-21= Cunningham first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Galway minor hurling team as a sixteen-year-old in 1981. He made his debut that year as Galway reached the All-Ireland final for the first time in eight years. Kilkenny were the opponents and went on to win the game by 1‚Äì20 to 3‚Äì9. Galway were back in a second successive All-Ireland minor decider again in 1982 as Tipperary provided the opposition. A complete collapse by Galway resulted in a 2‚Äì7 to 0‚Äì4 defeat. In 1983 Cunningham was in his final year on the minor team when he was appointed captain. Galway reached a third consecutive All-Ireland decider, this time with Dublin providing the opposition. A 0‚Äì10 to 0‚Äì7 victory spared Galway the unwanted distinction of losing three successive championship deciders, while it also gave Cunningham an All-Ireland Minor Hurling Championship medal as captain. Cunningham subsequently joined the Galway under-21 hurling team. After a few unsuccessful seasons he was appointed captain in his final year on the team in 1986. Galway qualified for the All- Ireland final that year with Wexford providing the opposition. A 1‚Äì14 to 2‚Äì5 victory gave Galway the title and gave Cunningham an All-Ireland medal in the under-21 grade. =Senior= Cunningham made his senior debut for Galway in a National Hurling League game against Tipperary in 1984 and immediately became a regular member of the starting fifteen. In spite of an indifferent league campaign during the 1984‚Äì85 season, Galway subsequently qualified for the All- Ireland final against Offaly. Cunningham came on as a substitute in that game, however, Offaly won by 2‚Äì11 to 1‚Äì12. In 1986 Galway qualified for a second successive All-Ireland decider, this time with Cunningham as a member of the starting fifteen. The men from the west were the red-hot favourites against an ageing Cork team, however, on the day a different story unfolded. Four Cork goals, one from John Fenton, two from Tom√°s Mulcahy and one from Kevin Hennessy, stymied the Galway attack and helped 'the Rebels' to a 4‚Äì13 to 2‚Äì15 victory. Cunningham enjoyed his first senior success with Galway in 1987 when he won a National League winners' medal following a two-point defeat of Clare. For the third year-in-a-row Galway reached the All-Ireland final. The prospect of becoming the first team to lose three consecutive championship deciders weighed heavily on the Galway team as Kilkenny provided the opposition. The game was not a classic by any standard and Noel Lane got a key goal for Galway nine minutes before the end. A 1‚Äì12 to 0‚Äì9 victory gave Cunningham his first All-Ireland winners' medal. Galway reached a fourth successive All-Ireland final in 1988 and were presented with the chance of becoming the first Galway team to retain the title. After more than a decade-and-a-half in the wilderness Tipperary were back providing the opposition. Noel Lane again scored the crucial goal for Galway while Nicky English sent a late Tipp penalty over the bar for a point. A 1‚Äì15 to 0‚Äì14 score line resulted in victory for Galway and a second All-Ireland winners' medal for Cunningham. A third successive All-Ireland title proved beyond Galway, however, the team bounced back and reached the championship decider again in 1990. Cork were the opponents, however, Galway were the favourites. Shortly after half-time Galway were up by seven points and were cruising to victory. Tom√°s Mulcahy, however, played a captain's role and scored a crucial goal that revitalised the Cork attack. The final score of 5‚Äì15 to 2‚Äì21 gave Cork the victory and a third All- Ireland final defeat for Cunningham. Following this defeat Cunningham fell out of favour with the Galway selectors. He remained on the panel for another few years and was an unused substitute when Kilkenny defeated Galway in the 1993 All-Ireland decider. He retired from inter-county hurling following this defeat. =Inter-provincial= Cunningham also lined out with Connact in the inter-provincial championship. He won his first Railway Cup medal in 1986 as Connacht defeated Munster by 3‚Äì11 to 0‚Äì11. Connacht made it two-in-a-row in 1987, with Cunningham collecting a second Railway Cup medal following a 2‚Äì14 to 1‚Äì14 defeat of Leinster. After defeat in 1988, Connacht returned to the final again the following year. A thrilling 4‚Äì16 to 3‚Äì17 defeat of Munster gave Cunningham a third Railway Cup medal. No championship took place in 1990, however, Connacht were back in a sixth final in seven years in 1991. Cunningham was once again on the team, and he collected a fourth Railway Cup medal following a 1‚Äì13 to 0‚Äì12 defeat of Munster. Managerial careerRoscommon (hurling)= Cunningham took over as manager of the Roscommon county hurling team in 2004. He enjoyed little success in his first season with 'the Rossies' making little progress in the 'B' championship. In 2005, Roscommon contested the newly established Christy Ring Cup. After losing three of their group stage games, Cunningham's side faced a relegation battle which they just about survived. =St Brigid's= After guiding the St Brigid's under-21 football team to the championship title in 2005, Cunningham was appointed manager of the club's senior team in 2006. The pressure was on for Cunningham in his debut season, as St. Brigid's were already the reigning county champions. A 1‚Äì7 to 1‚Äì5 defeat of St Faithleach's in the 2007 decider secured a second successive championship for St Brigid's. Cunningham's side later claimed the Connacht title following a one-point defeat of Corofin. In 2007, Cunningham's side made it three county championships-in-a-row following another defeat of St Faithleach's. Four-in-a-row proved beyond St Brigid's and Cunningham stepped down as manager in 2008. =Garrycastle= Following his successful stint with St Brigid's, Cunningham was appointed manager of the Garrycastle senior football team in early 2009. Once again success was immediate. In his debut season Cunningham guided Garrycastle to the county championship title following a 3‚Äì8 to 0‚Äì6 defeat of St. Loman's. Cunningham guided Garrycastle to a second successive county championship in 2010 following a 2‚Äì9 to 1‚Äì8 defeat of Mullingar Shamrocks. The success continued for Cunningham's side once again in 2011. A 1‚Äì9 to 0‚Äì9 defeat of Mullingar Shamrocks after a draw and a replay gave Garrycastle an historic third championship title in succession. Garrycastle later secured the Leinster title following a narrow 1‚Äì8 to 0‚Äì10 defeat of Dublin's St. Brigid's. After three years at the helm, Cunningham finally guided Garrycastle to the All-Ireland final. Crossmaglen Rangers were the opponents and a 0‚Äì15 to 1‚Äì12 draw was the result. In spite of leading by four points in the first game, Cunningham's side were comprehensively defeated by 2‚Äì19 to 1‚Äì7 in the replay. =Galway (hurling)=Under-21 In March 2009, Cunningham was appointed manager of the Galway under-21 hurling team for a two-year term. After exiting the championship at the first hurdle in 2009, Cunningham guided Galway to the All- Ireland decider the following year. Tipperary were the opponents and went on to trounce Galway by 5‚Äì22 to 0‚Äì12. In late 2010, Cunningham was re-appointed manager for a further two-year term. In third season Cunningham guided Galway to a second successive All-Ireland final, this time with Dublin providing the opposition. A 3‚Äì14 to 1‚Äì10 victory gave Gslway their tenth All-Ireland title. =Senior= On 27 October 2011, Cunningham was appointed as the Galway senior hurling manager. In November 2011 Cunningham dropped one third of the team which featured against Waterford in the 2011 All-Ireland SHC quarter-final defeat from his 37-man training squad for the 2012 season. In his first season as manager he guided Galway to win their first ever Leinster Hurling Championship against Kilkenny and all the way to the 2012 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship Final, in which Kilkenny defeated them after a replay. 2013 proved to be more difficult for Anthony Cunningham. He maintained Galway's top flight status in Division 1A of the Allianz Hurling League with wins over Kilkenny and Waterford and a draw against Cork. This was followed by a League semi-final defeat, in which Kilkenny easily defeated Galway on a scoreline of 1‚Äì24 to 1‚Äì17. However, questions were raised of Galway's over- reliance on Joe Canning for scores. Galway opened their 2013 Championship campaign against hurling minnows Laois, where they won on a scoreline of 2‚Äì17 to 1‚Äì13. This was followed by a comprehensive defeat at the hands of Dublin in the Leinster Senior Hurling Championship Final. Following the defeat questions were raised over Anthony Cunningham's team selections over the year, most notably from former Galway hurler Sylvie Linnane, who raised questions over the inconsistent selection of the backs. Both Tony √ìg Regan and Niall Donoghue, both of whom gained an All Star nomination for their performances the previous year, were not selected for the game against Dublin. As a result of the defeat, Galway were drawn against Clare in the All Ireland Quarter- final. Another disappointing defeat followed. Again, the selection of the team drew the attention of pundits, as a total of six changes were made from the previous outing. Cunningham subsequently came under pressure as Galway senior hurling manager. However, on 3 November 2013 it was confirmed that Cunningham would continue as manager and bring on-board new members of his backroom team; former Galway hurler and All-Star, Eugene Cloonon, along with GMIT GAA officer Damien Curley. Cunningham's three-year term ended when Galway were knocked out of the All-Ireland qualifiers by Tipperary on 5 July 2014 and he had to apply and be nominated when the position was thrown open again. Cunningham was eventually appointed for another two years in October 2014. He will be aided by a backroom team of Pat Malone, Damien Curley and Eugene Cloonan. On 16 August 2015 Galway reached the 2015 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship Final after defeating Tipperary in the semi-final. Galway went on to lose the final on 6 September to Kilkenny by four points. It was confirmed on 28 September 2015, that Cunningham would remain in charge in 2016. In early October 2015, reports emerged that the Galway players had put forward a vote of no confidence in him with Cunningham stating that he was keen to remain in charge. GAA officials in Galway were seeking to appoint a mediator in a bid to resolve the dispute. On 16 November 2015 Cunningham stepped down as Galway hurling manager after many players voted to oust him as manager. =Roscommon (football)= On 9 November 2018, Cunningham was appointed manager of the Roscommon county football team on a 2 year deal with an option of a 3rd year. In June 2019, Cunningham created history by leading Roscommon to victory over Galway in the Connacht Senior Football Championship Final. In doing so, Cunningham became the first manager to win provincial titles in both football and hurling, in different provinces.

An 1857-built day school in Hatfield Broad Oak provided non-religious teaching to 113 parish pupils; it became government funded in 1862, and in 1898, after rising and falling numbers, an infants room was added, and in 1929 it was amalgamated with Hatfield Heath National School.Bartholomew, J.

Newnes, London (1904), p. 214 The Hatfield Heath Congregational community dates to 1665, established by an incumbent ejected from the vicarage of Hatfield Broad Oak who became licensed as a Congregational minister. The community met in a meeting house, and by 1724 in a barn, where the congregation numbered 300. A further house was acquired on which land the present enlarged church was built in 1875, building on a number of earlier church structures. By 1851 the congregation was 500, and became part of the United Reformed Church in 1972, after which membership fell to 91 in 1980. The Hatfield Broad Oak Congregational church building, dating from 1818 and later converted for Roman Catholic use, was until the 1920s a station of Hatfield Heath Congregational church. Kelly's Directory noted in 1902 at Hatfield Heath a Gothic style independent Congregational \\"chapel\\" seating 300, built in 1876. The church's front gable contained a stained glass window to Rev. C. Berry, who was the minister for over 50 years. The first British School associated with the Congregational community dated to 1827, with 18 pupils attending by 1833. By the end of the decade it was reduced to a Sunday school. A second British School was built concurrently with the present church; it housed places for 150 mixed children, and by 1902 had an average attendance of about 70.The National gazetteer: a topographical dictionary of the British Islands compiled from the latest and best sources..., Virtue and Co., London (1868), Vol II, p. 214Kelly's Directory of Essex 1902 'Doune Bridge' over Pincey Brook An original bridge over Pincey Brook on the road to Matching south from Hatfield Heath dates to before the late 13th-century. The upkeep of the bridge (formerly Doune Bridge) was the responsibility of Hatfield Priory, and after the Dissolution of the Monasteries, Down (Doune) Hall manor and later manorial lords. By the middle of the 17th-century these later responsibilities were not always maintained. The bridge came under the auspices of the county in 1881. On the Chelmsford Road to the east of the village is Stone Bridge over the Pincey Brook. This bridge was the responsibility of two local farmers until 1779, after which in 1800 it was maintained by the county, but was dilapidated by 1858. A significant estate at Hatfield Heath is 'Gladwyns' (today on Sheering Road at the southwest of the village); it was named as such in the early 14th-century during the reign of King Edward II. The early 19th-century house on the estate, within grounds of 3 acres, was in 1902 occupied by Horace Broke J.P. (1827-1909), and was Grade II listed in 1981.

The church is situated in Mahim, located at the intersection of L.J. Road and Mahim Causeway. The church was originally built by the Portuguese in 1534. Initially known as San Miguel, it is the oldest Portuguese Franciscan church in Mumbai. It was rebuilt a number of times; the present structure dating to 1973. The church also served as a refuge to the popular icon of the Virgin Mary from Our Lady of the Mount chapel, Bandra from 1739 to 1761. Due to its location, it is also informally known as Mahim Church. The church is famous for its Novenas on Wednesdays, which is visited by thousands.  History  Interior of St. Michael's Church, Mahim (Mumbai, India) The original St. Michael's Church is believed to have been built in 1534 by Ant√≥nio do Porto, a church builder of the Franciscan Order. When the Marathas conquered Salsette in 1739, Our Lady of the Mount chapel in Bandra was destroyed by the Portuguese at the instance of the British so that its location remained secret to the Marathas. In this time, St. Michael's Church was the refuge place for the image of the Blessed Virgin from the chapel. The image remained in St. Michael's till 1761, when it was moved to its present structure in Bandra. In 1853, St. Michael's Church witnessed a struggle between Bishop Anastasius Hartmann and the padroado order. St. Michael's was in control of the vicars apostolic for nearly 60 years. In 1853, a discontented group decided that the control be handed over to the padroado party. To prevent this, Hartmann as the vicars's leader, went to the church and declared that \\"he would rather die a martyr than surrender the church to the schismatics\\". Hartmann and his followers stayed in the church with enough food and water for 15 days. Hartmann's opponents had laid \\"siege\\" to the church in this period, blocking all entrances. On the 15th day, civil authorities intervened and insisted that the church be reopened. Following this, Hartmann lost control of the church, passing it to padroado order. In his 1917 book, Sheppard remarks that St. Michael's was situated on the Portuguese Church Street and is one of the four \\"only known Portuguese buildings; and of these no distinguishing original feature survives, as they were much rebuilt\\". The present structure of St. Michaels was rebuilt in 1973.  Novena  The original Our Lady of Perpetual Succour picture from Rome St. Michael's sees a large number of people on Wednesdays every week, when novena prayers to Our Lady of Perpetual Succour are held throughout the day. These services are attended by people of all faiths. Devotees believe that visiting the Church on nine consecutive Wednesdays (Novena) will grant their wishes. Some of them offer wax figures of what they desire, for example, a wax house. According to Father Hugh Fonseca, around 40-50,000 devotees visit the church every week. The weekly Novena services were started in 1948, when a Father Edward Placidus Fernandes from Bombay noticed a similar ritual celebrating Our Lady of Perpetual Succour at Belfast, Northern Ireland, during his visit to Europe. Fr. Fernandes brought with him a picture touched to the original icon at Rome. On 8 September 1948 ‚Äì the Birthday of Mary, concurrent with a Wednesday that year, Fr. Fernandes as the vicar held the first Novena services. Initially, only two services were held every Wednesday, but today from 8:30 am to 10:30 pm, the thirteen services are held in various languages: English, Konkani, Marathi, Tamil and Hindi. In 2014, A painting of the Our Lady of Perpetual Succor was gifted to St. Michaels by the Vatican. The painting is an authentic hand painted version of the original icon in Rome.  Reported \\"Bleeding\\" Christ picture  On 27 June 2008, thousands of devotees visited St. Michael's to see the picture of Jesus called \\"the Divine Mercy\\". The picture showed some red spots which were believed to be blood near the heart of Jesus. The spots were noticed on the day at 8.30 pm on the occasion of the feast of Our Lady of Perpetual Help and were termed as a \\"miracle\\" by devotees. Not only Christians, but also Hindus and Muslims from Maharashtra and the neighbouring states of Goa, Karnataka and Gujarat, visited the Church to catch a glimpse of the picture. The queue to St. Michael's extended more than a kilometre. Parish Priest Father Raphael and Father Doneth D'Souza from the St. Michael's church as well as Archbishop cardinal Oswald Gracias declined the miracle claim. Fr. D'Souza explained \\"It's not a blood stain and it's also not a miracle. Every image of Divine Mercy has a red halo around the heart and in this case, the red colour has run because of the moisture in the air. It will look like a blood stain, but it's not.\\" The image was removed and sent to a scientific analysis on the orders of Oswald Gracias. The result of that study was released in the September archdiocesan weekly and it said that the tests \\"established that there are no traces of blood in the red rays emanating from the Heart of Jesus in this image of Divine Mercy\\". Monsoon humidity and changes in the air quality were the suspected causes, Oswald Gracias did not explain the exact reasons.No blood in bleeding Jesus‚Äô picture: Study September 3, 2008 Indian Catholic  See also  * Saint Michael: Roman Catholic traditions and views  References  External links  * Youtube: Mass at St. Michael's Category:Roman Catholic churches in Mumbai Category:1534 establishments in the Portuguese Empire ","title":"St. Michael's Church, Mumbai"},{"id":"20829028","text":"The soprano oboe (in C) and its alto version, the English horn (in F) , are instruments generally associated with art music, but they have been used sporadically in popular music recordings, generally by (often uncredited) studio musicians on recordings of specific songs. In the late 1960s and 1970s, several bands emerged that featured oboists as members, including The Moody Blues (Ray Thomas), Henry Cow (Lindsay Cooper), New York Rock & Roll Ensemble (Martin Fulterman and Michael Kamen), Roxy Music (Andy Mackay), Electric Light Orchestra (Roy Wood), Wizzard (Roy Wood), and Japan (Mick Karn). The oboists in these bands generally used the oboe as a secondary instrument, not playing it on every song. Japan and Roxy Music, however, did use the oboe quite frequently. However, Iva Davies, the frontman of the Australian rock band Icehouse (formerly \\"Flowers) studied oboe at the Sydney Conservatorium and played both oboe and cor anglais in many of the band's songs. Since the 1990s, the oboe has been used in rock most notably by Sigur R√≥s (played by Kjartan Sveinsson), as well as by indie rock musician Sufjan Stevens (who also plays cor anglais and often overdubs both instruments on his albums). Jarlaath, the vocalist of the French gothic metal band Penumbra, plays the oboe in a number of the band's songs, as does Robbie J. de Klerk, the vocalist of the Dutch melodic doom/death metal band Another Messiah. In America, a band called Hoboe defines itself as a rock band showcasing amplified oboe, fronted by oboist Zen Ben.. The band Liminal Phase uses amplified oboe, played by Lisa Hirst Carnes along with bassoon, harmonium, cello, keys, guitar, drums & noise to create an electronic chamber sound.

The series spawned manga and light novel adaptations. Taking place two years after the events of 428: Shibuya Scramble, Canaan centers on three women, their connections to one another, and an upcoming anti-terrorism summit in Shanghai, China. The first woman is Canaan, a Middle Eastern assassin and mercenary. The second is Alphard Al Sheya, Canaan's rival and a skilled assassin who heads the terrorist organization known as 'Snake.' The final girl is Maria ≈åsawa, a returning character from the Shibuya incident, who came to Shanghai with her fellow reporter, Minoru Minorikawa. Their subsequent encounters lead to armed interventions between Canaan and Alphard, along with the reveal of their deep and tragic past. Plot Two years after the events of 428: Shibuya Scramble, Maria ≈åsawa and Minoru Minorikawa are dispatched as reporters to Shanghai in order to cover the upcoming Shanghai NBCR International Anti-Terrorist Conference. Prior to their current assignment, both Maria and Minoru were survivors of the Shibuya bio- terrorism incident, where Maria was kidnapped by terrorists and was infected by the Ua virus but was cured by her scientist father using an experimental anti-Ua virus vaccine. On her first day in Shanghai, Maria is targeted by masked assassins but saved by a Middle Eastern girl named Canaan, whom she befriended in the Middle East prior to the events of 428: Shibuya Scramble and her Shanghai trip. Their presence in the city is being overshadowed by a mysterious event being planned by Alphard, Canaan's rival. Unknown to the two, Alphard is preparing a big plot related to the anti-terrorist summit after being rescued by Cummings and Liang Qi, a pair of mercenaries and Alphard's allies. Maria's life was placed in danger once more when Snake assassins were dispatched to harm her, placing Canaan at the forefront of it all in order to protect her friend. Minoru investigates a strange purple mark that he spotted from one of the assassins Canaan had killed recently, tying it back to the events in Shibuya. Canaan and Alphard continue to violently confront one another before and after the terrorist attack on the anti-terrorist summit, the latter trying to make Canaan fight her with all of her strength. The reason for their rivalry was Siam, a mercenary and mentor to Canaan, who was gunned down by Alphard during a joint mission together in an attempt to forge her own path without being influenced by Siam as she also was raised by him with the name Canaan once before she discarded it for her current name. Canaan later goes on a journey with Mino, Maria and several others to Western China where a new Ua virus was first used to find out about its origin and track down Alphard. After Maria and Minoru made their safe return to Japan from their journey in China, Maria opened a photo gallery and reflected on the friendship she and Canaan shared. One of the portraits she had for public display was named Canaan. It consisted of pictures of Alphard, who was formerly known as Canaan, and the Canaan she knew back from her Middle East trip. Characters Poster of the show's characters. From left to right: Nene, Santana, Hack≈ç, Yunyun, Cummings, Liang Qi, Alphard, Canaan, Yuri Natsume, Maria ≈åsawa and Minoru Minorikawa. =Main characters= ; : :Canaan is the titular character and main protagonist of the series, a mercenary currently operating in Shanghai. She was the only survivor of a village destroyed by war in the Middle East before being found and trained by Siam, who has her adopting the name Canaan. She developed a respect for her mentor during the course of her training and later to Alphard as well (Siam's former student who she saw as an older sister figure). But when Alphard betrayed both her and Siam during a mission and left Siam to die, Canaan was consumed by the quest for revenge. Canaan gets serious whenever she sees Alphard. As an elite mercenary, Canaan is also a skilled marksman and an expert of combat, her weapon of choice most of the time being a Beretta Px4 Type G 9 mm semi- automatic pistol. She has the ability to use synesthesia to aid her in combat, viewing the world in different colors to tell enemies from civilians. She is always seen with a red halterneck shirt and brown pants. On her left wrist, she wears a black tattoo that possibly completes a whole picture of a snake with the tattoo on Alphard's arm. She covers this tattoo with a layered red armband, which repeatedly gets ripped off during her fights. ; : :The series' most prominent villain, Alphard is an attractive young woman who is both the leader of a terrorist organization called ', which is responsible for both the Shibuya and Shanghai terrorist attacks and Canaan's arch-enemy. Once Siam's apprentice and known as Canaan, she has since thrown away the identity and adopted her current name. Prior to the events of 428: Shibuya Scramble, Alphard, Siam and Canaan were hired to hijack an armored military train containing the Ua virus. During the assignment Alphard betrayed her teammates when it was revealed their client ordered her to kill all witnesses, including them. She shot Siam and left him to die while escaping with the virus. She appears easily capable of taking down Canaan even though the latter uses her synesthesia, reasoning that she is no longer manipulated by feelings (unlike Canaan). She carries a FN Five-seveN USG 5.7 mm pistol as a sidearm. On her lower left arm, a strange tattoo is worn, and it possibly is a half of a whole picture of a tattoo if combined with the tattoo on Canaan's arm. However, she amputated this arm during her final battle with Canaan, later coming to be known as \\"the one-armed woman\\". ; : :Usually seen smiling, Maria is one of the central characters of the series. Two years ago during the events of 428: Shibuya Scramble, she was abducted by Snake terrorists and they infected her with the Ua virus to force her father, Kenji ≈åsawa, to make them a cure to the Ua virus to save her life. While her life was saved thanks to her father's anti-virus, the trauma she endured during the Shibuya incident made her suffer amnesia. As a result, she cannot remember certain events during that incident, including not remembering having met Alphard before. Prior to the Shibuya incident, she befriended Canaan after being saved from hoodlums during a trip somewhere in the Middle East. As her dream is to become a photographer, she became the partner of Minoru Minorikawa before the pair's assignment in Shanghai and her subsequent reuniting with Canaan. Several characters have made fun of her cowlick hairstyle and her relatively small bust size. =Secondary characters= ; : :An ex-mercenary who mentored both Canaan and Alphard. He rescued the young Canaan from the ruins of her home village, took her under his care, and trained her in the art of combat. Prior to the events of 428: Shibuya Scramble, he, Canaan and Alphard were hired to hijack an armed military train to steal the Ua virus it was carrying. He was shot by Alphard who revealed that their client had ordered her to kill all witnesses on the train; this included him and Canaan. Alphard left him to die while a bomb was placed to blow up the train. However, Siam ordered Canaan to stop Alphard from escaping with the Ua virus. He disarmed the bomb before bleeding to death. This event is the main reason of contention between Canaan and Alphard. Even though he is dead, his \\"spirit\\" appears to both Canaan and Alphard. ; : :One of the main characters in the original 428: Shibuya Scramble and a survivor of the Shibuya incident, Minorikawa is a hot-headed reporter who is assigned to Shanghai along with Maria, who (along with Canaan) nicknames him 'Mino-san'. He acts as both Maria's supervisor and friend as he and Maria work to find out more about the strange cases in Shanghai. ; : :One of Alphard's top lieutenants who affectionately refers to Alphard as an elder sister, she was hinted to have been with Alphard ever since Alphard and Siam had gone their separate ways. She appears calm and even-tempered, but is in fact unwavering, merciless, and very much obsessed with admiring and idolizing Alphard to the point of being in love with her. To her frustration, however, Alphard does not reciprocate and instead ignores or even proceeds to ridicule her from time to time. Her obsession with Alphard leads her into a mad desire to kill Canaan, believing that Alphard will then pay more attention to her. Halfway through the series, she eventually does lose her calm demeanor and acts irrationally, resulting to her death at the hands of Cummings, a man she supposedly worked as secretary for, and Alphard herself. ; : :Born Song Yun Mi, this eccentric and energetic young girl is one of the Borners, surviving test subjects of Snake's Ua virus experiment. The Ua mutation did not appear to have granted her any extraordinary ability save for an additional appendix; however, her dependence on anti-viral medicine provided by Liang Qi allowed her to be treated as a disposable pawn. A comic-relief who was also made fun of for her almost-flat chest. ; : :Cummings is the public head of the private military company Daedala, a front organization of the Snakes, staffed by members of the terrorist organization. Within Snake, however, he serves under Liang Qi, whom he is in love with, as an adviser and is often her primary victim of venting frustrations from being unable to win over Alphard's attention, usually as airsoft gun target practice which he does not mind as he is a masochist. Publicly, Cummings is accompanied by a Snake member named as his personal bodyguard. He kills Liang Qi in order to free her of her pain and in return she says she loves him (as that was his request). In the end it appears he has become a monk. ; : :Santana runs a karaoke cosplay bar in the streets of Shanghai while working with Hakko to assist other Borners and Unblooms to find refuge from Snake. In addition, he is an acquaintance of Natsume and is rather protective of Hakko, willing to enter into a physical altercation with Minoru for asking her too many questions. He assists Canaan, Minoru, and Maria to revisit the destroyed hometown village and the factory. He confronts Liang Qi at the factory, but is captured. Liang Qi manipulates Hakko into accidentally mortally wounding Santana with her deadly voice. Santana dies in Hakko's arms as she whispers her love to him. ; : :A Borner with the ability to inflict brain damage with her voice (which can be fatal if wholly unleashed). Usually seen behaving childlike, she works as a cosplay waitress in Santana's bar as well as his assistant, having since developed feelings for him. Unfortunately, since she is unable to speak out without hurting him, he remains under the impression that Hakko has never forgiven him for his role in the destruction of her home village. She accompanies the protagonists on a goal to liberate a factory used for creating Snakes subordinates. There she is tricked by Liang Qi into killing Santana with her voice, causing Hakko to become depressed. Near the end of the series, she confesses her love to a dying Santana and remains with his corpse in the factory as it collapses. ; : :Natsume is a Japanese woman who acts as both a representative of Canaan's employer and her informant, working for a Non-Governmental Organization called OWL. She is calm and punctual, as attested by the way she interacts with Canaan despite initially being very much annoyed by the latter's single-mindedness for avenging Siam's death. She is an acquaintance of Santana and usually advises him to treat Hakko well. It is later revealed that she really works for the Defense Intelligence Headquarters with the rank of Major, using the Ua virus incidents and manipulating the US and China in order to get Japan to an advantageous position in the international politics arena. =Supporting characters= ; : (Japanese) :A biological researcher and also one of the protagonists of 428: Shibuya Scramble, he is the man that was able to cure the Ua virus which he uses his knowledge to save his twin daughters, Maria and Hitomi during the Shibuya incident who were both affected with the Ua virus (Hitomi is one of the main characters in the game). He makes a cameo during the terrorist attack on the Shanghai International Conference Hall, bringing in stockpiles of Ua anti-virus medicine after a staged assassination. ; : :Maria and Minorikawa first encounter him when they are pursued by assassins sent by Snake. Since then, he has met up with them a few more times. He drives like a maniac and idolizes a singer named Nene. He is based on Hachirou Kimizuka, the taxi driver from the original 428: Shibuya Scramble game. Terminology * : Snake is a secret terrorist organization led by Alphard. The goals of Snake is unknown but what is known is they profit from any conflicts they get involved. The organization has many spies around the world from Japanese hoodlums, to scientists and even within the CIA. Officially, many countries are opposed to them but some countries secretly work with them if they gain something from it. * Ua virus: a biological weapon of mass- destruction that kills its victims within 12 hours, causing parts of their bodies to bleed. It was created by an unknown country and before the events of 428: Shibuya Scramble, it was the most dangerous virus in the world as there was no known cure for it. The use of the virus in a bio-terrorist attack in Shibuya forms the background of 428: Shibuya Scramble as the \\"Snakes\\" were trying to steal the newly discovered anti-virus developed by Kenji ≈åsawa. Their goal was to keep the secrets of the anti-virus to themselves as the only one with the cure for the Ua virus thus making Snake profit from any country that was a victim of the Ua virus. However their mission fails thanks to actions of a group of people (the protagonists of \\"428: Shibuya Scramble\\"). A second generation Ua virus was later developed by a joint venture between the CIA and Snake. Ua is a word from the Swahili language that means flower or death. * Borner: Borners are individuals infected with the 2nd generation Ua virus but managed to survive. As a result, their bodies mutate and possess unusual abilities, with few exceptions (for example, Yunyun, aside from her extra appendix, does not display anything readily noticeable). When someone becomes a Borner, blood vessels from a random part of his/her body would surface to form a mark with the shape of a flower. In order to suppress the virus, Borners require regular intakes of a special medication, or they will still die. Some are under the employ of Snake for this very reason as assassins against opposing factions and Unblooms who attempt to escape from Snakes control. * Unbloom: Unblooms are also victims of the 2nd generation Ua virus who survived before the advent of the anti-virus. They, too, have blood vessels from a random part of their bodies surfacing to form a mark with the shape of a flower. Unlike Borners, however, they did not gain any special ability or otherwise mutate, except that they become deadly vulnerable to UV rays and outside noises. Those individuals who venture outside the Factory must wear masks that look like a mascot head costume (and serve to shield the wearers from the aforementioned hazards), the removal of which invariably ends up killing them. Development The series was known in its initial planning stages as 428 the animation when it was first announced in Newtypes October 2008 issue and by Sega at the 2008 Tokyo Games Show, where a trailer for the series was aired and announced as an adaptation of Type-Moon's original scenario for the game.

Life Born in Zahl√©, Lebanon on August 6, 1841, G√©raigiry was ordained priest on March 16, 1862, with a special permission due to his young age. He soon set up an elementary school in Zahle and became a teacher in the patriarchal college of Beirut. From 1874 to 1878 he studied theology in France. When he returned to Lebanon he became director of the schools of his diocese. In 1882 G√©raigiry was appointed delegate of the Patriarch and thus he traveled to Rome, Paris, Istanbul. On February 21, 1886, patriarch Gregory II Youssef consecrated bishop G√©raigiry and appointed him responsible of the newly created diocese of Paneas, where he set up twenty-three Christian schools. After the lengthy and eventful reign of Gregory II Youssef, on February 24, 1898, G√©raigiry was appointed patriarch of the Melkites following his election by the Melkite synod of bishops. Although his election was considered null by the Roman Congregation of Propaganda Fide, Pope Leo XIII confirmed it shortly later. The four years of his reign were marked by crisis. Some discontent arose from appointments of bishops taken without consulting the synod, and from his attempt to move the Patriarchal See from Damascus to Beirut. Also his relations with the Congregation of Propaganda Fide were often tense, mainly because Rome wanted him to summon a synod to define in details the powers and the autonomy of the patriarch and of all the Melkite clergy, while G√©raigiry hesitated and took time. The synod never met under his reign. Peter IV G√©raigiry died in Beirut on April 24, 1902.

Various Danish phrases are recorded that refer to the horse. The Helhest is associated with death and illness, and it is mentioned in folklore as having been spotted in various locations in Denmark. Folklore The horse figures into a number of Danish phrases as recent as the 19th century, such as \\"han g√•r som en helhest\\" (\\"he walks like a hel- horse\\") for a male who \\"blunders in noisily\\". The helhest is sometimes described as going \\"around the churchyard on his three legs, he fetches Death\\", and from Schleswig, a phrase is recorded that, in time of plague, \\"die (corrected by Grimm from der) Hel rides about on a three-legged horse, destroying men\\".Grimm (1883:844). 19th century scholar Benjamin Thorpe connects the Danish phrase \\"he gave death a pack of oats\\" when an individual survives a near-fatal disease to notions of the Helhest, considering the oats either an offering or a bribe.Thorpe (1851:209). According to folklore, the Aarhus Cathedral yard at times features the Hel-horse. A tale recorded in the 19th century details that, looking through his window at the cathedral one evening, a man yelled \\"What horse is outside?\\" A man sitting beside him said \\"It is perhaps the Hel-horse.\\" \\"Then I will see it!\\" exclaimed the man, and upon looking out the window he grew deathly pale, but would not detail afterward what he had seen. Soon thereafter he grew sick and died. At the Roskilde Cathedral, people in former times would spit on a narrow stone where a Helhest was said to be buried.Vicary (1884:110). Legend dictates that \\"in every churchyard in former days, before any human body was buried in it, a living horse was interred. This horse re-appears and is known by the name of 'Hel-horse.'\\" 19th century scholar Jacob Grimm theorizes that, prior to Christianization, the helhest was originally the steed of the goddess Hel.

The bridge was constructed in 1924, designed by Frank McEnteer.http://www.wvculture.org/shpo/nr/NRLIST02.txt This elegant bowstring reinforced concrete arch bridge represents a traditional bridge type which was readily adapted to what was essentially a new construction material: reinforced concrete. Unlike a rail or road bridge, this bridge can be considered an unusual pedestrian bridge in that it was built by the Bridgeport Lamp Chimney Company in 1924 to provide access from the glass plant to a warehouse on the other side of Simpson Creek. The bridge was designed to carry hand carts with glass products across the river to the warehouse. The bridge remains the only evidence of the original works, and its successor, Master Glass Company. Thus the bridge stands in splendid isolation from any other structure. Structure details The bridge is long by in width. The height of the center line transom is above the deck. Although hidden from view, a notable feature is the proprietary reinforcement used throughout the structure. The principal reinforcing bars are either of the patented Havemeyer reinforcement produced by the Concrete Steel Company of New York, or a similar bar produced by Cambria Iron Works of Johnstown, Pennsylvania. It was an era of intense competition among reinforcing bar manufacturers with each individual deformed bar pattern carefully protected by patents. Smooth bars of approximately diameter were employed for stirrups throughout the bridge structure.http://www.wvculture.org/shpo/nr/pdf/harrison/96001571.pdf *Arch: *Tension ties: *Deck: *Verticals: Historical significance The reinforced concrete bowstring arch erected in 1924 by Frank Duff McEnteer and his Concrete Steel Bridge Company is an elegant expression of the bridge builders art executed by one of the pioneers in the use of reinforced concrete for both bridges and buildings. The bridge is a poignant reminder of the early glass industry that flourished in the Clarksburg area and indeed in the state as a whole. The glass industry found a favorable business climate based on cheap natural gas and abundant quartzite for producing products ranging from utilitarian bottles to the finest cut glass. Little remains of this once flourishing industry.

The play features the historical figure My≈çe Sh≈çnin (1173 ‚Äì 1232), abbot of the Buddhist temple K≈çzan-ji, and famous for his detailed dream diary. My≈çe sought for many years to visit China and India, and to witness the places where the historical Buddha preached; in episodes recorded in his dream diary and other sources, My≈çe is said to have been visited, both in dreams and via oracles, by the Dragon God of Kasuga Shrine, who persuaded him to remain in Japan. The play is inspired by and based upon these sources, and relates one such meeting of My≈çe with the Dragon God. Plot Opening page of the play songbook for Kasuga Ry≈´jin The play opens with My≈çe and his companions traveling to Kasuga Shrine to say formal farewells to the kami of the shrine, before they leave for their journey to China and India. There, they meet a priest, an old man, who welcomes them into the shrine grounds, saying that My≈çe is favored by the kami of the shrine like a first-born son, and that of course he should be most welcome. Learning of My≈çe's intentions to journey abroad, however, he argues that the kami shouldn't like to see him go, as his presence at the shrine is so treasured. The priest goes on to explain that, were the Buddha still living, one would do well to hear him preach in person. But, he says, the ages have turned, and the sacred places of India and China are now represented in Japan. He equates important Buddhist sites such as Vulture Peak to sites in Japan, such as Mount Mikasa, and encourages My≈çe to visit these sacred sites instead. He offers that if My≈çe will desist with his plan, he will reveal to the monk, upon Mount Mikasa, the five regions of India, the Buddha's birth, the Buddha's enlightenment, his preaching, and his passing. Convinced, My≈çe gives up his intentions to travel to the continent, and asks the old man his name. The priest identifies himself as Tokif≈´ Hideyuki, a name drawn from those of the founders of the Kasuga Shrine, Nakatomi no Tokif≈´ and Nakatomi no Hideyuki, at which he vanishes. Between the two acts of the play, a ky≈çgen actor portraying a minor kami in the service of the shrine comes forth and retells the story of the first act. In the second act, the Dragon God of Kasuga (the kasuga ry≈´jin of the play's title) appears, and dances, while speaking to My≈çe, and confirming that he has in fact given up his intentions to journey to the continent.

The film is Ben Rock's first feature film as a director. The film was produced by Daniel Myrick, John Shiban, and Tony Krantz, and was released by Warner Home Video and Raw Feed in September 2008.  Plot  Just as the local grocery store is about to close, a group of six armed, masked people enter the building. They take the staff and remaining customers hostage and immediately shoot down one of the employees. One of the masked men named Spooky is then told to check whether \\"he\\" is among the hostages. When he identifies a woman as one of \\"them\\", she tries to escape but is shot down. Meanwhile, a police officer, who was also inside the store, manages to kill one of the masked men. He then calls for back-up and shoots Spooky, who hasn't managed to check all hostages yet. The cop is then killed too. As the police arrive, the group argues whether or not to leave, but their leader, a man named Ritter, tells them that they need to finish their job. They release the hostages Spooky already managed to clear and move the rest to the back of the store. As they inspect one of the corpses, it becomes clear that the person was infected with an organism that breeds inside the person. With Spooky dead, the group resorts to a different method for checking whether the rest of the people are infected or not. One by one, the hostages are taken to another room and have one of their fingers cut off, which Sterling, the doctor of the group, uses to verify if they are infected or not. Outside the store a policeman named Seth, whose stepdaughter Whitney works as a cashier at the store, takes charge of the police operation. They discover that Ritter used to work as a rocket scientist and that the group hunts people that are infected with an alien parasite that came to Earth inside a meteorite, which the cops don't believe. Trying to negotiate with Ritter, they come to the agreement that Ritter will release one of the hostages if the police bring them a woman named Charlotte, who used to be part of the group and possesses the same ability as Spooky did. The group inside discovers another woman is infected and kill her. They are then attacked by the revived body of the cop, who manages to kill two of the captors and three of the hostages. Ritter then explains to the remaining hostages what they were after: The parasites are divided in two groups, several females and one king. Without the king, the parasites would eventually go extinct. They knew that one of the persons inside the store was the host of the king, which is why they took the whole store hostage. Seth and Charlotte then come inside. With Charlotte's help, the group lures the infected cop into a trap, while Seth leads his stepdaughter and the store clerk named Benny, who volunteered to have his finger cut off to spare Whitney the ordeal, outside. Ritter manages to cut the living parasite out of the cop, but is subsequently gunned down by the police who try to kill it. Just as Sterling is arrested by Seth, Charlotte realizes that the killed parasite was not the king. Inside a police car, Benny overhears Seth calling the other cops, telling them that Benny must be the king. Benny realizes that it must actually be Whitney, since she was the only one who is still alive and wasn't checked by the captors. As he aims a gun at her, her eyes and veins change to a darker color and the screen fades to black, while Benny is heard screaming.  Cast  Production  The film used Inglewood, California as a location. Working titles for the film were Inhuman and Supermarket.  Awards  According to IMDb, Alien Raiders won the Audience Award at the H.P. Lovecraft Film Festival in 2008 Courtney Ford won the Science Fiction Genre Award for Best Actress at ShockerFest in 2008 The film also won Best Thriller Feature at Shriekfest in 2008 Reception The film holds a 100% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on six reviews with an average score of 7.21/10.  Reviews  According to critic and audience reviews on the film, many people compare the work of Alien Raiders to other Sci-Fi thrillers such as the 1982 film The Thing and the 2007 film The Mist for its similarities in story and how the aliens or creatures manifest themselves. People also claim that the visuals and acting in the film were surprisingly well and exceeds expectations for a low budget independent film. Although the film does not have a new or original story line, critics say that it executes its formula well.

Plot  A concerned mother and father (played respectively by Jahanara Hai and Abid Ali) have four young daughters, Malaika (Amna Hussain), Sajjal (Ayesha Khan), Alishba (Aamina Haq) and Laiba (Fiza Ali). The beginning of the drama sees all four marrying their respective husbands on the same day. The rest of the serial showcases their marital lives, the problems they face and the difficulties they must conquer. Even though theirs is a love marriage, Laiba and her husband, Aahad (Kamran Jillani), have yet to reach the level of understanding that a stable marriage requires. Fights are their general custom from day one, and both must make efforts to cut down their troubles, and live a happy, married life. Adding to their troubles are Aahad's insensitive older sister. Laiba finds herself pregnant, though miscarries soon after, when she falls because of an argument with her sister-in-law. When it becomes apparent that they may never conceive, the couple contemplates adoption. the eldest daughter Malaika's husband Taha (Adnan Siddiqui) on the other hand, is financially unstable and wants his father-in-law's help to establish himself. he originally worked in the same hospital as Sajjal's husband Shahzeb, but quit as the wedding drew near, as he was insecure about the prospect of being at a lower post after marriage. While he originally, had no intention of asking for his in-laws help, he is spurred on by his visiting brother's wife. Problems spring up for Malaika as his demands grow, and the young woman finds herself trying to balance old home and new home, and a reeling life and world. And in the midst of all this, she is devastated by the revelation that she is adopted, and is actually the child of brother-in-law Rameez's father's deceased cousin. Feeling confused and betrayed, she turns her back from her family, and this puts a further strain on her marriage. Sister Alishba's problems are altogether even worse: While all three of her sisters have chosen their partners themselves, her marriage is an arranged one. We find that her husband, Rameez (played by heart-throb Aijaz Aslam) was in love with another girl, Ramsha, but was forced by his parents (played by Qazi Wajid and Ayesha Khan) to marry Alishba. Frustration rocks this couple, with Rameez wanting time and again to return to Ramsha, who is bent upon forcing him to divorce Alishba. Alishba, meanwhile, desperately tries to save a marriage that could fail any second, and send her dreams crashing to the ground. Sajjal's love marriage with cousin Shahzaib (Humayun Saeed) seems to come almost as a relief, as the couple is a mature, highly loving one, with both partners ready to see each other through thick and thin, and Sajjal soon finds herself pregnant. But tragedy strikes, turning their lives topsy-turvy as it is discovered Shahzaib has cancer. Things wrap up quite nicely in the end, though not without some shocking and touching moments of surprise. Laiba and Ahad succeed in adopting despite initial protests of Aahad's mother. Malaika comes to terms with her own adoption, Taha mends realizes his mistakes, and the two make amends with each other, and try to salvage their relationship. Rameez realizes that he can't in good faith divorce Alishba, and the two resolve to move forward in life. Sajjal and Shahzaib cherish each other as only two true lovers can, but Sajjal's world is shattered when her husband's deadly disease takes his life. She will, in time, learn to live again, treasuring and holding near and dear the sweet memories of their times together, as she awaits the birth of her child.

Its goal was to maintain the autonomy of the Kingdom of Dalmatia within the Austro-Hungarian Empire, as opposed to the unification with the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia. The Autonomist Party has been accused of secretly having been a pro-Italian movement due to their defense of the rights of ethnic Italians in Dalmatia.Maura Hametz. In the Name of Italy: Nation, Family, and Patriotism in a Fascist Court: Nation, Family, and Patriotism in a Fascist Court. Fordham University Press, 2012. The Autonomist Party did not claim to be an Italian movement, and indicated that it sympathized with a sense of heterogeneity amongst Dalmatians in opposition to ethnic nationalism. In the 1861 elections, the Autonomists won twenty-seven seats in Dalmatia, while Dalmatia's Croatian nationalist movement, the National Party, won only fourteen seats.Ivo Goldstein. Croatia: A History. 2nd edition. C. Hurst & Co, 1999, 2001. P. 80. This number rapidly decreased: already in 1870 autonomists lost their majority in the Diet, while in 1908 they won just 6 out of 43 seats. History Traditionally linked to the idea of a Dalmatian nation advocated by Niccol√≤ Tommaseo in the first half of the 19th century and regarded as a meeting of the Latin world with the Slavic world, initially the party also attracted the sympathies of some of the Slavic Dalmatians, while maintaining an undisputed open to the Italian cultural world. The Dalmatian branch of the People's Party (, ), which supported the reunification of Dalmatia with the remainder of Croatia, viewed the Autonomists as supportive of an Italian annexation of Dalmatia, which was indeed the ambition of the Italian state. The Autonomist Party received the vote of the Dalmatian Italians and some bilingual Slavs and controlled most Dalmatian coastal cities: this party had a majority in the Parliament of Dalmatia in the mid-19th century. However, in 1870 democratic alterations to the electoral laws allowed the majority Croatian population of Dalmatia to influence the elections for the first time. The democratic reforms allowed for a greater part of the general population to vote (but even areas where non- Slav population was the majority were affected) and so the Autonomist Party no longer had a majority: by the outbreak of World War I, only the city of Zara (now called Zadar) remained in Autonomist hands. A similar but independent political development occurred in Fiume, where Michele Maylender, claiming greater autonomy from the centralizing Hungarian executive of Dezs≈ë B√°nffy, founded the (Fiume) Autonomist Party in 1896. Although the reference with Dalmatia was never made explicit among Fiume autonomists (who widely read Tommaseo and Bajamonti) the goals of the Party were very similar to that in Dalmatia as it opposed the inclusion of the city to Croatia. As in Zadar the party remained in power up to 1914, and both cities, although claimed by the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes at the Paris Peace Conference, were finally assigned to Italy: Zara by the Treaty of Rapallo and Fiume with the Treaty of Rome, which gave Fiume to Italy and the adjacent port of Su≈°ak to Yugoslavia. Antonio Bajamonti, the most prominent Autonomist in the history of the party, once remarked: Count Francesco Borelli Dalmatian deputy, argued for the autonomy of the Kingdom of Dalmatia, claiming that it had no connection whatsoever with Croatia. Though he admitted that the majority of the population was Slavic in language, mentality and outlook, he pointed out that Dalmatia's \\"higher\\" culture was Italian. At the beginning of the 20th century the Autonomist Party, having lost his majority in nearly all Dalmatia, started to be dominated by a group of Dalmatian Italians from Zara, led by Luigi Ziliotto and Giovanni Bugatto, who supported Italian irredentism in Dalmatia: the party was suppressed in 1915 when Italy declared war on Austria during World War I.Monzali, Luciano.

His son, Richard Henry Dana Jr., also became a lawyer and author. Biography Richard Henry Dana was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts on November 15, 1787, and was the son of Federalist judge Francis Dana.Haralson, Eric L. Encyclopedia of American Poetry: The Nineteenth Century. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers, 1998: 115. He graduated from Harvard College and became a lawyer. He married Ruth Charlotte Smith and they had four children including Richard Henry Dana Jr. Despite having graduated from there, Dana accused Harvard of smothering genius, and believed that the minds of poets were more insightful than the general community. He seldom practiced law. Dana's home on Beacon Hill, Boston Between 1817 and 1827, he was the first American to write major critiques of Romanticism, though his views were unconventional for his time. In a review of the poetry of Washington Allston, he noted his belief that poetry was the highest form of art, though it should be simple and must avoid didacticism. Dana also criticized the Transcendentalism movement. He wrote, \\"Emerson & the other Spiritualists, or Supernaturalists, or whatever they are called, or may be pleased to call themselves... [have] madness in their hearts\\". Dana was a member of the Anthology Club. In 1817 he and others in the club founded the North American ReviewBrickhouse, Amanda.

Encyclopedia of American Poetry: The Nineteenth Century. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers, 1998: 115‚Äì116. Though some of his criticisms were controversial when first published, by 1850 his opinions were conventional. As he wrote at the time, \\"Much that was once held to be presumptuous novelty... [became] little better than commonplace\\". As a writer of fiction, Dana was an early practitioner of Gothic literature, particularly with his novel Paul Felton (1822), a tale of madness and murder. The novel has also been called a pioneering work of psychological realism alongside works by William Gilmore Simms.Pfister, Joel. The Production of Personal Life: Class, Gender, and the Psychological in Hawthorne's Fiction. Palo Alto, CA: Stanford University Press, 1991: 52‚Äì53. Dana had difficulty supporting his family through his writing, which earned him only $400 over 30 years.Sullivan, Wilson. New England Men of Letters. New York: The Macmillan Company, 1972: 99.

Hartmann was born in Elgin, Illinois,USA on 28 July 1939. He studied electrical engineering and physics at Iowa State University in Ames, IA, (BSEE 1961). Supported by a Rhodes Scholarship (Iowa and Lincoln, 1961) he studied theoretical physics with Sir Roger Elliott at Oxford University in England (D.Phil. ‚Äì condensed matter theory 1965).Hartmann WM and Elliott RJ (1967) Theory of 1-phonon impurity-induced infra-red absorption in rare-gas solids.

He continued research in condensed matter theory as a post-doctoral scholar at Argonne National Laboratory in Argonne Illinois (1965‚Äì1968). In 1968 Dr. Hartmann joined the Department of Physics (now the Department of Physics and Astronomy) at Michigan State University in East Lansing where he is still employed as a professor of physics. His work in condensed matter theory primarily involved lattice vibrations (phonons) in defective crystals, where he was the first to show how to include short-range order among defects in the vibrational theory of alloys.\\"Theory of the vibrations of dilute alloys with short-range order,\\" W.M. Hartmann, Phys. Rev. {172}, 677‚Äì688 (1968).

Hartmann, Physical Review Letters {26}, 1640‚Äì1643 (1971). In 1974 he began teaching an undergraduate course on musical acoustics which inspired his interest in human hearing. In 1976 he reinvented himself as a psychoacoustician, and he has continued to work in psychoacoustics, musical acoustics, and signal processing since that time. He has been an adjunct professor in the MSU Department of Psychology since 1979. In 1981‚Äì82 Dr. Hartmann was a visiting scientist at the Institute for Research on Acoustics and Music (IRCAM) in Paris.

A pioneer of jazz and tango in Poland, in the United States he is best known as a promoter of polka music. He wrote the score for the first Polish sound film. Born April 26, 1902 in Warsaw, then in the Russian-held Congress Poland, to a renowned Polish writer and revolutionary Gustaw Dani≈Çowski. In 1919 he joined the Polish Army and served with distinction during the Polish-Bolshevist War. Following demobilisation he started studies at the Warsaw Conservatory. He studied piano under tutelage of Henryk Melcer-Szczawi≈Ñski and theory of music in the class of Piotr Rytel. In 1926 he also graduated from the law faculty of the University of Warsaw. In late 1920s Dani≈Çowski spent two years working for the Polish embassy in Paris, where he fell in love with jazz and tango, two styles of music gaining increasing popularity in Europe at that time. Upon his return to Poland he started composing for the Qui Pro Quo cabaret. Numerous songs written for the star of the cabaret, Hanka Ordon√≥wna, gained him much fame in Warsaw and then in the entire country. Also in 1928 he founded a Ch√≥r Dana (Dan's Choir), modelled after The Revelers. In 1929 he also formed an Argentinian Choir V. Dana which helped popularise tango in Poland, to the extent that already by the start of the 1930s it started to be considered a part of Warsaw's folklore. http://www.todotango.com/spanish/biblioteca/cronicas/tango_en_polonia.asp His music gained him much fame in 1930s Poland and he became one of the most popular composers of the time. His songs were sung by many of the most notable vocalists of the epoch, including Adam Aston, Mieczys≈Çaw Fogg, Zofia Tern√© and Mira Zimi≈Ñska-Sygiety≈Ñska, to name but a few. In 1930 he also wrote the score for the first Polish sound film, the Moralno≈õƒá Pani Dulskiej. He later wrote scores for numerous other films, including Dziesiƒôciu z Pawiaka (1931), Dvan√°ct k≈ôesel (1933), Wacu≈õ (1935) and Dodek na froncie (1936). The lyrics for his songs were written by some of the most renowned Polish authors of the time, including Julian Tuwim, Marian Hemar, Konrad Tom and Jerzy Jurandot. Until 1939 he was also the head of the Popular Music Department of the Polish Radio, at the same time he continued a successful diplomatic career for the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Following the outbreak of World War II Dani≈Çowski moved to Italy and then in 1940 to the United States. There he re- activated his Dana Choir under a new name (Dana Ensemble) and adopted a new pseudonym - Walter Dana. He worked as a speaker for numerous Polish-language radio stations and signed contracts with Harmonia and RCA Victor record companies. In the 1940s he also founded his own label, Dana Records. In hid capacity of record company executive, promoter, and publisher, he was largely responsible for the \\"big-band\\" sound of polka music that became pre-eminent in the America. Jimmy Sturr states that \\"He started what is known today as polka music, it's as simple as that,\\" In 1958 he moved to Miami Beach. Later in his life he transitioned to a composer of classical music. He died March 4, 2000 and was buried in the Southern Memorial Park.

Whereas the central distribution describes how a test statistic is distributed when the difference tested is null, noncentral distributions describe the distribution of a test statistic when the null is false (so the alternative hypothesis is true). This leads to their use in calculating statistical power. If the noncentrality parameter of a distribution is zero, the distribution is identical to a distribution in the central family.Dodge, Y. (2003). The Oxford Dictionary of Statistical Terms, Oxford University Press. For example, the Student's t-distribution is the central family of distributions for the noncentral t-distribution family. Noncentrality parameters are used in the following distributions: :* Noncentral t-distribution :* Noncentral chi-squared distribution :* Noncentral chi-distribution :* Noncentral F-distribution :* Noncentral beta distribution In general, noncentrality parameters occur in distributions that are transformations of a normal distribution. The \\"central\\" versions are derived from normal distributions that have a mean of zero; the noncentral versions generalize to arbitrary means. For example, the standard (central) chi-squared distribution is the distribution of a sum of squared independent standard normal distributions, i.e., normal distributions with mean 0, variance 1. The noncentral chi-squared distribution generalizes this to normal distributions with arbitrary mean and variance. Each of these distributions has a single noncentrality parameter. However, there are extended versions of these distributions which have two noncentrality parameters: the doubly noncentral beta distribution, the doubly noncentral F distribution and the doubly noncentral t distribution.Johnson, N.L., Kotz, S., Balakrishnan N. (1995). Continuous univariate distributions, Volume 2 (2nd Edition). Wiley. These types of distributions occur for distributions that are defined as the quotient of two independent distributions. When both source distributions are central (either with a zero mean or a zero noncentrality parameter, depending on the type of distribution), the result is a central distribution. When one is noncentral, a (singly) noncentral distribution results, while if both are noncentral, the result is a doubly noncentral distribution. As an example, a t-distribution is defined (ignoring constant values) as the quotient of a normal distribution and the square root of an independent chi-squared distribution. Extending this definition to encompass a normal distribution with arbitrary mean produces a noncentral t-distribution, while further extending it to allow a noncentral chi-squared distribution in the denominator while produces a doubly noncentral t-distribution. There are some \\"noncentral distributions\\" that are not usually formulated in terms of a \\"noncentrality parameter\\": see noncentral hypergeometric distributions, for example. The noncentrality parameter of the t-distribution may be negative or positive while the noncentral parameters of the other three distributions must be greater than zero.

Due to insufficient funds and partly due to the nationwide Panic of 1837, the KSS eventually collapsed amid accusations of fraud and mismanagement, with Smith and associates facing seventeen lawsuits. 1860s * Jacob Young, William Abrams, and Nancy Clem ran what author Wendy Gamber argues, in her book \\"The Notorious Mrs. Clem: Murder and Money in the Gilded Age,\\" was the first-ever Ponzi scheme. * In Munich, Germany, Adele Spitzeder founded the \\"Spitzedersche Privatbank\\" in 1869, promising an interest rate of 10 percent per month. By the time the scheme collapsed in 1872 it had become the largest case of fraud in 19th-century Bavaria. 1870s *Johann Baptist Placht ran a Ponzi scheme in Vienna from 1872 to 1873, claiming to invest in the stock market. *Fraudster Sarah Howe opened a savings bank called Ladies' Deposit Company in 1878 meant to target unmarried women. She claimed that the bank worked in conjunction with a Quaker charity that wanted to help less privileged women. She promised high interest rates of eight percent per month. There was in fact no such charity. Howe was able to gain over 1,200 clients and US$500,000 in deposits before the Boston Daily Advertiser began outing LDC as a fraud in 1880. Howe was arrested, convicted, and served three years in prison. She attempted some other schemes after release in the 1880s, either being arrested, or fleeing to avoid it, eventually becoming a fortune teller until her death in 1892. 1890s *Before Charles Ponzi, in 1899 William \\"520 Percent\\" Miller opened for business as the \\"Franklin Syndicate\\" in Brooklyn, New York. Miller promised 10% a week interest and exploited some of the main themes of Ponzi schemes such as customers re-investing the interest they made. He defrauded buyers out of $1 million and was sentenced to jail for 10 years. After he was pardoned, he opened a grocery store on Long Island. During the Ponzi investigation, Miller was interviewed by The Boston Post to compare his scheme to Ponzi's‚Äîthe interviewer found them remarkably similar, but Ponzi's became more famous for taking in seven times as much money.Zuckoff, Mitchell. Ponzi's Scheme: The True Story of a Financial Legend. Random House: New York, 2005. () =20th century=1920s *Charles Ponzi became noted in 1920, in Boston, for his supposed arbitrage scheme, which ultimately proved to be merely a masquerade for paying off early investors with the deposits of later investors. The Ponzi Scheme is named after him. He claimed he would double investors' money in 90 days through a bizarre plan to buy and resell international postal-reply coupons. (These, according to the U.S. Postal Service, then operating as the Post Office Department, actually cannot be redeemed for cash.) Ponzi collected more than $8 million from about 30,000 investors, in just seven months, before the scheme collapsed. He served fourteen years in prison, was deported from the United States, and spent the rest of his life vainly seeking ways to provide restitution for the losses of his investors. 1930s *Ivar Kreuger, a Swedish businessman known as the \\"match king\\", built a Ponzi scheme, defrauding investors based on the supposedly fantastic profitability and ever- expanding nature of his match monopolies. The scheme soon collapsed in the 1930s, and Kreuger shot himself.The Incredible Ivar Kreuger, Allen Churchill; Weidenfeld, London; Rinehart & Co., New York; 1957 1980s *In the 1980s, Jean Pierre Van Rossem ran a stock market investment company called \\"Moneytron\\" in Belgium. Van Rossem claimed that he had developed a statistical model to predict the behavior of the stock markets and beat the capitalist system. Investors believed Van Rossem's claims, and that trust, coupled with his gift for self-promotion, allowed Van Rossem to accumulate US$860 million (about 32 billion Belgian francs). He also traded duplicate stocks. In 1991, he was sentenced to five years in prison for what was in part a Ponzi scheme; according to him, it was \\"a way to fuck the system\\". *Between 1970 and 1984 in Portugal, Dona Branca maintained a scheme that paid 10% monthly interest. In 1988, she was sentenced to 10 years in prison. She always claimed that she was only trying to help the poor, but in her trial it was proven that she had received the equivalent of ‚Ç¨85 million (almost US$120 million). *In January 1984, Adriaan Nieuwoudt started the so-called \\"Kubus\\" scheme with an apparent beauty product in South Africa. Subscribers to the scheme bought a supposedly biological substance called an \\"activator\\", that was used to grow cultures in milk. After growing for a week or two, the cultures were harvested and dried, and sold back to the scheme. The cultures were never used for a beauty product but were simply ground up and resold to further investors as activators. *1600 investors in Diamond Mortgage Company and A.J. Obie, two firms with the same managers, lost approximately $50 million in what the Michigan Court of Appeals described as \\"the largest reported 'Ponzi' scheme in the history of the state\\". It led to the passage in 1987 of the Mortgage Brokers, Lenders, and Servicers Act.\\"People v.

David & Company, a purported currency and commodity trading and investing operation named after its founder, J. David Dominelli, a withdrawn and shy currency and commodity trader, was revealed to be a Ponzi scheme which took in $200 million and returned $120 million to investors, leaving a net loss of $80 million. The scheme touched all levels of upper-class business and professional life in San Diego and environs. One of those most closely involved was Nancy Hoover, the mayor of Del Mar, California, a cozy upscale beach town just north of La Jolla. Hoover was J. David's assistant and live-in companion at the time. Also involved was the prominent New York law firm Rogers & Wells (now Clifford Chance), which had advised J. David (through a rogue partner) and others.Rancho Santa Fe, California When the fall came, J. David briefly escaped to Montserrat in the Caribbean, but was returned ultimately to plead guilty to federal charges and was sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment, *Between 1978 and 1983, Ron Rewald ran an investment firm in Hawaii. The firm declared bankruptcy in 1983 and was revealed to have been a Ponzi scheme which defrauded over 400 investors of more than $22 million. Rewald claimed that he had been operating the firm as a front for the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. Rewald was convicted and sentenced to 80 years in prison; he was paroled in 1995. 1990s *–ú–ú–ú was a Russian company that perpetrated one of the world's largest Ponzi schemes of all time. By different estimates from 5 to 40 million people lost up to $10 billion. The company started attracting money from private investors, promising annual returns of up to 1,000%. It is unclear whether a Ponzi scheme was the initial intention, as such extravagant returns might have been possible during the Russian hyperinflation in such commerce as import-export. *In Romania, between 1991 and 1994, the Caritas scheme run by the \\"Caritas\\" company of Cluj-Napoca, owned by Ioan Stoica promised eight times the money invested in six months. It attracted 400,000 depositors from all over the country who invested 1,257 billion lei (about US$1 billion) before it finally went bankrupt on August 14, 1994, having a debt of US$450 million. The owner, Ioan Stoica, was sentenced in 1995 by the Cluj Court to a total of seven years in prison for fraud, but he appealed and it was reduced to two years; then he went on to the Supreme Court of Justice and the sentence was finally reduced to one year and a half. *Anubhav Teak Plantations scam (India): From 1992 to 1998, a number of teak plantation Ponzi schemes were floated in India, prominent being Anubhav Plantations. These promised extravagant profits for people who invested in planting teak (done by purchasing \\"teak shares\\"). In 1998, Anubhav plantations collapsed leaving more than 31,000 depositors defrauded to the tune of Rs. 10712 Crores. *Towers Financial Corporation, a bill collection agency, collapsed in 1993; in 1995, chairman Steven Hoffenberg pleaded guilty to bilking investors out of $475 million. Judge Robert W. Sweet sentenced him to 20 years in prison, plus a $1 million fine and $463 million in restitution. He settled a civil suit with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for $60 million. He briefly was the owner of the New York Post. At the time the SEC considered the fraud to be \\"one of the largest Ponzi schemes in history.\\" For years, Epstein‚Äôs old boss, Steven Hoffenberg, has claimed that Epstein was his accomplice in a Ponzi scheme Hoffenberg ran through his Towers Financial Corp. The mystery source of Jeffrey Epstein‚Äôs wealth could be buried in a 1980s fraud case resurfacing as the billionaire financier faces a slew of sex-trafficking charges. *In late 1994, the European Kings Club collapsed, with ensuing losses of about $1.1 billion. This scam was led by Damara Bertges and Hans G√ºnther Spachtholz. In the Swiss canton of Uri and Glarus, it was estimated that about one adult in ten invested into the EKC. The scam involved buying \\"letters\\" valued at 1,400 Swiss francs that entitled buyers to receive 12 monthly payments of 200 Swiss francs. The organisation was based in Gelnhausen, Germany. *In early 1996, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a civil action against Bennett Funding Group, its chief financial officer, Patrick R. Bennett, and other companies Bennett controlled, in connection with a massive Ponzi scheme. The companies fraudulently raised hundreds of millions of dollars, purportedly to purchase assignments of equipment leases and promissory notes. *From 1993 until 1997, a church named Greater Ministries International in Tampa, Florida, headed by Gerald Payne bilked over 18,000 people out of $500 million. Payne and other church elders promised the church members double their money back, citing Biblical scripture. However, nearly all the money was lost or hidden away. Church leaders received prison sentences ranging from 13 to 27 years. *In the mid-1990s, Albania was transitioning into a liberalized market economy after years under a State- controlled economy reinforced by the cult of personality involving longtime Communist leader Enver Hoxha; the rudimentary financial system became dominated by pyramid schemes, and government officials tacitly endorsed a series of pyramid investment funds. Many Albanians, approximately two-thirds of the population, invested in them. In 1997, Albanians, who had lost $1.2 billion, took their protest to the streets where uncontainable rioting and attacks on government infrastructure led to the toppling of the government and the temporary existence of a stateless society. Although technically a Ponzi Scheme, the Albanian scams were commonly referred to as pyramid schemes both popularly and by the International Monetary Fund.Christopher Jarvis, The Rise and Fall of Albania's Pyramid Schemes, Finance & Development: A Quarterly Magazine of the IMF, March 2000. *In 1996, Sidney Schwartz and his son, Stuart F. Schwartz, pleaded guilty to charges of running a multimillion-dollar Ponzi scheme that targeted members of a Long Island, New York, country club at which the senior Schwartz was a member of the board of governors. *In 1997, South African businessman Kenny Kunene was convicted of running a Ponzi scheme with over 2,000 investors and sentenced to six years in prison. *In Delhi, India, Hoffland Finance collapsed amid a major scandal in 1998. Hoffland, a category II merchant banker, had been suspended by SEBI, which directed it to refrain from undertaking any new portfolio management assignments. It had floated a scheme, called \\"Invest Card\\", that lured investors with a return of 27% annually.Indian Express, January 24, 1998 *Since 1998, 1040 Sunshine Project has been an illegal pyramid schemes or Multi-level marketing and originated in Beihai City, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. =21st century=2000s *In 2001, some Haitians fell prey to Ponzi schemers offering rates up to 15%. The outfits, called \\"cooperatives\\", appeared to be implicitly backed by the government and became wildly popular in the population at large, who felt safe since the co-ops were openly advertising in radio and TV ads using Haitian pop stars as spokespeople. It is estimated that more than $240 million was swindled from investors, equivalent to 60% of the country's government budget. *The Brothers was a large investment operation in Costa Rica, from the late 1980s until 2002, eventually exposed as a Ponzi scheme. The fund was operated by brothers Luis Enrique and Osvaldo Villalobos. Investigators determined that the scam took in at least $400 million. Most of the clientele were American and Canadian retirees but some Costa Ricans also invested the minimum $10,000. About 6,300 individuals ultimately were involved. Interest rates were 3% per month, usually paid in cash, or 2.8% compounded. The ability to pay such high interest was attributed to Luis Enrique Villalobos' existing agricultural aviation business, investment in unspecified European high yield funds, and loans to Coca-Cola, among others. Osvaldo Villalobos' role was primarily to move money around a large number of shell companies and then pay investors. In May 2007, Osvaldo Villalobos was sentenced to 18 years in prison for fraud and illegal banking, while Luis Enrique Villalobos remains a fugitive. *In 2003, the SEC shut down a $1 billion scheme by Mutual Benefits Company in Florida, run by Peter Lombardi, affecting 28,000 investors.

Herula himself raised about $16.5 million of investor funds, most of which was later transferred to his wife's brokerage account at Raymond James; he was arrested in Bermuda and extradited to the United States where he pleaded guilty to fraud and was sentenced to 15 years and eight months' imprisonment. *In February 2005, Moshe Leichner and his son Zvi were sentenced to 20 years in federal prison for running a Ponzi scheme that defrauded hundreds of investors out of more than $95 million, of GunnAllen Financial (shut down by regulators in March 2010 for fraud allegations and losses related to another Ponzi scheme) and Safe Harbor Capital Management (now dba HarborLight Capital Management) which lost $40 million for their investors. *In May 2006, James Paul Lewis, Jr. was sentenced to 30 years in federal prison for running a $311 million Ponzi scheme over a 20-year period. He operated under the name Financial Advisory Consultants from Lake Forest, California. *In October 2006, in Malaysia, two prominent members of society and several others were held for running an alleged scam, known as SwissCash or Swiss Mutual Fund (1948). SwissCash offered returns of up to 300% within a 15-month investment period. Currently, this HYIP investment is offered to citizens of Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia. It claimed investors' funds were channeled to business activities ranging from oil exploration to shipping and agriculture in the Caribbean. The company claims to be operating out of New York City and incorporated in the Commonwealth of Dominica. *In October 2006, Gregory Nathan, a Sydney fund manager, was arrested on charges including dishonest conduct and obtaining money by making false and misleading statements, in what investigators discovered to have been a Ponzi scheme.

Ervin of Safevest LLC had been arrested by the FBI on suspicion of running a Ponzi scheme that collected $25.7 million, mostly from Christian investors, partly recruited through Ervin's business partner Pastor John Slye and members of his church. Specifically, according to newspaper The Orange County Register, \\"the company recruited church members to sell the investment to other church members.\\" Slye had run a cancer research charity, which gave investors confidence. The scheme ran from May 2007 but started to run out of funds by October as investors asked for their money back. Safevest LLC returned $18 million to investors, the rest having been split among five main expenditures, including the two business partners' families, the purchase of a $1 million golf course, and $950,000 for GTS Research Inc. The latter, run by Carl LaRue Godfrey who was previously convicted for \\"illegal business practices and various other crimes\\", was served a Desist and Refrain order by the State of California in August 2007, the year of the Safevest scheme. GTS Research had claimed to have a patent pending for a new energy source. The fifth portion, $510,000, was paid to Dennis D. Cope, who had a criminal conviction in relation to a previous Ponzi scheme.

U.S. Attorney‚Äôs Office Eastern District of Texas. May 4, 2012 via fbi.gov *On August 17, 2012, the SEC filed a federal case against defendants Paul Burks and Zeek Rewards, based out of North Carolina. Paul Burks ran the entity of Zeek Rewards, a fraudulent investment opportunity that promised investors returns as high as 1.5% per day by sharing in the profits of Zeekler, a penny auction. Investors were encouraged to recruit new members to increase their returns. New investors had to pay a monthly \\"subscription\\" of up to $99/month and an initial investment of up to $10,000. The higher the initial investment, the higher the returns appeared. The Zeekler entity was an online penny auction that served as a front for the Zeek Rewards entity. Investors in the Zeek Rewards scheme were promised payouts from the profits made on Zeekler by recruiting new members and giving out \\"bids\\" that customers would use on the penny auction. While the Zeekler website did bring in revenue, it was only about 1% of what investors believed was being brought into the Zeek Rewards company. The vast majority of dispersed funds were paid out from newly recruited investors. It is believed that the ponzi scheme was a $600M enterprise and the number of affected investors was 1 million when the SEC filed suit. This made Zeek Rewards the largest ponzi scheme in history by number of affected investors, even though numerous other ponzi schemes have had larger enterprise values. Paul Burks paid $4 million to the SEC and agreed to cooperate. It remains unknown how much, if any, of the funds lost in the scheme will be returned to affected investors, as of August 2012. *In August 2012, Trendon T. Shavers (aka \\"Pirate\\" and \\"pirateat40\\"), the founder and operator of \\"Bitcoin Savings and Trust\\" (BTCST), a non existent company advertised over an internet forum, disappeared from the public scene. Shavers raised at least 700,000 Bitcoin in BTCST investments by running it as a Ponzi scheme. The fact that BTCST was run using Bitcoin, makes this a unique instance of a Ponzi scheme. It allowed Shavers to initially stay completely anonymous, making it possible for him to just disappear with the money from his investors. Although some called it a pyramid scheme, BTCST is generally considered a Ponzi scheme. At the time he disappeared, somewhere around August 31, the 700,000 BTC were valued at around US$4,500,000. However, since Bitcoin prices increased significantly since the time it happened, they are now estimated to be worth more than US$2.5 billion. The SEC charged Shavers with securities fraud. Shavers pled guilty, and on July 21, 2016, he was sentenced to 18 months in prison, and 3 years of supervised release. *On September 5, 2012, the Economic Offences Wing of the Tamil Nadu Police arrested M S Guru, the mastermind of a 'contract emu farming' scheme for financial fraud and cheating over 12,000 investors.

During the proceedings, more than 300 million NIS of unfulfilled debt, mostly from investors, were set before the court. In addition, the court appointed liquidator produced a report claiming that funds in the Kela fund were not actually used for \\"Capital completion\\", but rather funneled into Rubicon Business Group, and that in addition that funds were moved from Rubicon to Bramly and his family, due to which a court order prohibiting disposition of assets was placed on Bramly and members of his family. As a result, the Kela fund, Rubicon Business Group, and a number of held companies were placed in permanent liquidation by the Tel Aviv district court in January 2016 after the court determined that funds were inter-meshed between the companies, and that debts, mainly to investors, exceeded assets. In June 2016 Bramly was indicted for theft, fraud and laundering of more than 400 million NIS, and Kela's investment recruiter Sivan Zibulski, as part of a plea bargain in which she will serve as a prosecutor's witness, was convicted and sentenced in January 2017. * In June 2013, Brazilian Justice first blocked Telexfree Brazilian operations, and in September 2015, convicted the company for operating a Ponzi Scheme.

Description Black's Picturesque Guide through Wales (1851) described St John's as \\"an ancient and finely proportioned edifice, with a noble quadrangular tower, surmounted by pierced battlements and four open gothic pinnacles... It is justly admired, and forms a conspicuous feature in every view of the town.\\" The same remains true today, with good views of the church from Church Street, Trinity Street and Working Street in the city centre. Newman describes the pinnacled west tower as a \\"magnificent marker\\". At a height of over 40 metres the tower is in four stages, faced in grey limestone ashlar with details in buff coloured Dundry stone. History View down Church Street towards St John's Church in 1852 Interior of the church The church was built in 1180 as a chapel of ease for the larger St Mary's Church, itself founded by Benedictine monks from Tewkesbury Abbey. Originally constructed of blue Lias, a Jurassic stone with layers of fossilised shells, it was sourced from Aberthaw. The walls were then originally dressed with freestone - limestone sourced from Dundry. St John's was sacked during a rebellion of Owain Glynd≈µr in 1404. The church was rebuilt in the second half of the 15th Century and given a perpendicular tower with a peal of ten bells. Today it still has a crown of openwork battlements, reminiscent of churches in the West Country of England, and is dated c.1490 because of the similar Jasper Tower of Llandaff Cathedral which was built at this time. After the foundations of St Mary's were destroyed by the Bristol Channel flood of 1607, the two churches were worked as a dual-location parish until all main services were moved to St John in 1620. In 1843, John Crichton- Stuart, 2nd Marquess of Bute paid for the construction of the Church of St. Mary the Virgin and St. Stephen the Martyr in Bute Street as a permanent replacement for St Mary's. This allowed the reconstruction of St John, with extensions to the church made in 1886‚Äì1897 using carboniferous limestone quarried from Culverhouse Cross. The churchyard wall was also rebuilt, using original Lias mixed with red sandstone in the walls, topped with coping stones of Devonian sandstones from the Forest of Dean. In 1851 the Cardiff firm of Messrs. Thomas & Norris were engaged for repewing of St John's with the work to be completed by Christmas that year. St John's stained glass windows date from circa 1855, in the north chapel, with references to the Bute family. Those in the north inner aisle date to 1869, by Morris & Co, with a top row of apostles designed by William Morris himself. The church was increased in width with outer aisles added to St John's in 1889 and 1891. The old aisle windows were re-set and all the new building was re-surfaced with Sweldon limestone. The graveyard, already full, was divided by a new public pathway in the 1890s connecting Working Street with Cardiff Central Market. As part of the agreement for the new path, Cardiff Corporation agreed to take responsibility for the graveyard south of the path. This later became St John's Gardens.

More than a TT replica sports roadster, the OHC Model 30, was 500 cc and the OHC Model 40 was 350 cc. During the 1930s it could be ordered from the Norton factory with all manner of racing parts fitted. Such factory bikes won many Isle of Man TT races during the 1930s, many of them 1-2-3 results. Norton factory riders on Inters, including Jimmie Guthrie, Jimmy Simpson, Stanley Woods were household names of the era. Production of the Model 30 and 40 International ended temporarily on the outbreak of World War II. Production of the Inter resumed for 1947, and continued until 1957. Although the engine continued almost from first to last unchanged, the famed featherbed frame was adopted for the 1953 models. By the 1950s though, the model was outdated and outclassed by the new twins and shared only the featherbed frame with its postwar Manx racing cousins, and only sold in small numbers. In the final years the Inter was not even mentioned in the catalog and was available only to special order. Development The name International was first used by Norton both for its newly designed race bikes and also for the TT replica sports roadster in 1932. Overseen by Joe Craig, Arthur Carroll had designed an overhead-camshaft engine for the works racers and although it retained the bore and stroke of the Norton CS1 the Model 30 International was all new. The racing heritage led to quickly detachable wheels and hairpin type valve springs that could be changed rapidly when racing. In 1933, the forks and gearbox were redesigned and in 1935, the Sturmey-Archer gearbox was replaced, as Sturmey-Archer had stopped making gearboxes, so Norton bought the rights to the design and commissioned Burman to produce them. These gearboxes proved so good they remained unchanged for the next 30 years, although the external appearance was altered several times, and the gearchange mechanism fully enclosed and thus lubricated. In 1936, the engine was upgraded with an alloy head and barrel with a bronze liner, available as an option. In 1938 suspension was upgraded to plunger type. And telescopic Roadholder Forks as ridden by Harrold Dannels and Freddie Frith in this year 1938 also available as an option. Production of the Model 30 and 40 ended on the outbreak of World War II. After the war, production of the International Model 30 (500 cc) and Model 40 (350 cc) restarted with an iron head and barrel, as fitted to the pre-war CS1 and CJ Nortons. The suspension was upgraded to Norton Roadholder telescopic forks instead of girders and Clubmans versions were also produced without silencers and lights for racing use. Close ratios gearboxes were supplied as standard from 1947, and the alloy-headed engine made a comeback in 1953 in the new Featherbed frame. Volume production of the International ended in 1955, although small numbers were built to special order for two or three years after. World record In 1935 works Norton team rider Jimmie Guthrie set a number of world speed records on a Norton International at the concrete bowl track in Montlhery, France. As well as setting a new one-hour world record at a speed of , he also broke the , , and records. Military use Military police from the Provost Company of the Territorial Army's 1st London Division, commanded by Captain Sir Malcolm Campbell, were equipped with the Model 30 in 1940 for fast escort and traffic control in the Coats Mission to evacuate King George VI, Queen Elizabeth and their immediate family in the event of German invasion. George Formby's Norton International A Norton International owned by comedian George Formby sold for ¬£30,582 at an auction on 3 December 2007. The 1947 Norton International was one of several motorcycles owned by Formby, who starred in the film No Limits, a spoof of the 1935 Isle of Man TT race. The International was presented to Formby during a visit to Norton‚Äôs Bracebridge Street factory in July 1947. Featherbed Norton Internationals in the 1950s For 1951, the by-now outdated and heavy plunger frames on the Internationals were upgraded with Nortons new race proven Featherbed frame. The engine stayed essentially the same, although the lightweight alloy head and cylinder were fitted as standard (previously a no-cost option), and the gearbox was the laydown version (same gears in a revised housing). Although Nortons advertising slogan of the time was \\"Built in the light of experience. Norton. The Worlds Best Roadholder\\" the new featherbed Inter was well behind the specification of the racing Norton Manx - double overhead cams and 8-inch twin leading shoe front brake. Also, the BSA Gold Star was proving formidable opposition in the Clubman Racing scene, so popular in the 1950s. So sales of the 1950s Norton International were somewhat muted, and by the mid-1950s it had disappeared from the catalogue, available only to special order. A final facelift for the 1957 and 1958 models was a cosmetic update to the full width alloy hub wheels, chrome plated tank sidepanels, new type Lucas headlamp and tubular exhaust. Only a dozen or less of these final models are reputed to have been produced.

In the 1950s she moved to Port Elizabeth in South Africa where she soon married a South African named Dennis Solomon.Quarterly Poultry Bulletin, Issues 41-60. British Oil & Cake Mills Limited, 1964, p. 51 The marriage ended in divorce after a few years and Sue Hart had to raise two children on her own. Sue Hart's second husband was veterinarian Antonie Marinus Harthoorn whom she had known since college. He was notable for the development of the M-99 (etorphine hydrochloride) capture drug and its accompanying gun, the capture gun, for darting big game animals. He was known by the Swahili name Daktari (Swahili: doctor). In 1964, Sue and her husband moved to Kenya where they met George Adamson. Adamson became Sue Hart's mentor and she learned all about handling wild animals from him. Sue Hart and Toni Harthoorn built up a wildlife orphanage which became noteworthy for its pioneering operations on cheetahs and lions, including the eye surgery on George Adamson's lion, Ugas. After Hungarian-born American television producer Ivan Tors became aware of this project he was so impressed by the work of the Harthoorns that he used it as inspiration for the television film Clarence, the Cross-Eyed Lion and the series Daktari. In 1967, Susanne Hart was one of the readers in the BBC children's television series Jackanory. In the mid 1970s she returned to South Africa.

It is the sixth entry in his Harry Hole series. Plot In 1991, at a youth camp run by the Norwegian Salvation Army, the 14-year-old daughter of a senior Salvationist official is raped in a public toilet. Because of the Salvation Army's strict hierarchical setup, and also because revelation of the rape will severely damage the organisation's reputation, she does not tell anyone about the ordeal. The name of the assailant is not given. That same year, during the breakup of Yugoslavia, a young Vukovar Croat fighter witnesses atrocities committed by the victorious Serb militias in the aftermath of the Battle of Vukovar. The fighter, who receives the nickname \\"Little Redeemer\\", later becomes a professional assassin, who carries out contract killings in various European cities. In the present day (2003), the assassin ‚Äì calling himself Stankiƒá ‚Äì arrives in Oslo and kills a Salvation Army officer during a Christmas street concert. Stankiƒá has a facial anomaly known as hyperelasticity, wherein his facial muscles can be manipulated voluntarily to stop people from recognizing him. As such, despite the murder happening in a public place, the Norwegian police get little useful information regarding the killer. Meanwhile, retiring Oslo police inspector Bjarne M√∏ller gives his three main officers. Jack Halvorsen, Beate L√∏nn, and Harry Hole gifts. Hole's is a wristwatch which grows to annoy him due to its incessant ticking. M√∏ller is replaced as senior police inspector by Gunnar Hagen. Hole, Halvorsen, and L√∏nn are assigned to the murder of the Salvation Army officer, Robert Karlsen. When a murder attempt is made on Robert's brother Jon, it is believed that the Karlsen family is being attacked. With Hole's former girlfriend, Rakel Fauke, having left him and started seeing another man, Matthias Lund-Helgesen, Hole meets ‚Äì and eventually begins a relationship with ‚Äì Martine, the young woman who (unbeknownst to Harry) was raped in 1991. Hole finds clues that lead him to Croatia and to Stankiƒá's minder, who is revealed to be the assassin's mother. He makes a deal with her to save her son's life, but upon returning to Norway discovers that a man wearing Stankiƒá's clothes has been shot and killed by a police marksman. The dead man's face is all but obliterated and identification is near-impossible. Halvorsen, L√∏nn's boyfriend, is fatally wounded outside Jon Karlsen's flat. Afterwards, Hole discovers that the blood of the dead man does not match that of Stankiƒá, whose blood was found at the scene of Halvorsen's attack. Hole continues to follow Stankiƒá, but now knows Jon placed the kill contract on himself by going to Croatia and setting up the hit under the guise of Robert. Jon switched places with his brother so that his murder could not be blamed on him. This had the additional bonus to Jon in that, had Stankiƒá returned home before discovering that he had killed the wrong target, the hitman and his mother would believe they had killed the customer, thus rendering payment impossible and nullifying the need to complete the killing of the 'correct' brother. Jon has been swindling the Salvation Army out of 5,000,000 krone for an apartment block. On the night of an indoor Christmas concert, Jon stands up his girlfriend, Thea, claiming that he is visiting his ill father in Thailand. Stankiƒá and Hole both get the information from Thea that Jon is about to flee the country. Stankiƒá catches up to Jon in a toilet some distance from the main airport terminal. Hole also catches up with the two and gets Jon to give a full confession, stating that anything said with a gun to his head is inadmissible in court. Jon tells everything, believing that he will be set free, but Hole instead tells Stankiƒá that Jon's bag contains 5,000,000 krone and walks away. Behind him a single shot is heard as Stankiƒá fulfils his contract by killing Jon and claims his payment. Part of the confession includes that it was Jon, not Stankiƒá, who fatally wounded Halvorsen. Hole also knows that it was Jon who raped Martine, and that he has been raping young girls regularly ever since. Owing to the high valuation that an antique dealer puts on the watch given to him by M√∏ller, Hole also realises that his former boss was involved in the same group of corrupt police officers as his former nemesis, Tom Waaler. Hole goes to Bergen to speak with M√∏ller, but after he describes that he was trying to do what was best for the force, Harry elects not to arrest him.

Current activities Carrie Searley explained to paranormal researcher Ben Radford that \\"fake ghost photography is in the minority, however, it does occur ... It is purely down to us to educate ourselves with the up and coming new photo apps that are being offered on the market\\". And ASSAP asked the public for its help to catalogue the known fake images for smartphones. Though the charity still analyses ghostly photographs, in 2011 it ceased to study smartphone pictures, as apps became available for the specific purpose of faking ghostly figures.The charity asked members to send before and after pictures using the applications to help weed out fakes. In 2013 the organisation staged a one-day \\"Summit on the Future of Ufology\\", stating that a possible crisis in the world of UFO researchers, as well as recent sightings, required examination. They held a similar conference in 2012 at the University of Worcester. They had earlier hosted the Paranormal Olympics at the University of London.

They group serves the entire UK with the Higginson's frequently travelling to investigate paranormal claims. The group has conducted over 22 investigations. They have captured numerous 'ghostly' phenomenon including orbs and magnetic fluctuations. Their most famous investigation was of St. Mary's Great Hall. The group's aim is to prove the existence of ghosts and to this end they carry out investigations using an array of scientific equipment; from infra-red cameras to electromagnetic frequency metres. They also perform vigils to look out for ghosts. The vigils are limited to 20y investigators at one time.

Since its formation in 2007, the team has been responsible for a series of successful released in pop, R&B; and dance music, including 2008's \\"Right Here (Departed)\\" by Brandy and Beyonc√©'s \\"Halo.\\"  History  Eventually a trio, the collective was formed in October 2007 following a writing camp throw by Bogart & Qui√±ones in J.R. Rotem's studio at Chalice, adding Erika Nuri to the collective shortly thereafter. A fourth member originally added, Victoria Horn, a British songwriter, left the formation soon-after joining amicably due to creative and business differences about the overall goals of The Camp. The remaining original trio has since formed The Writing Camp LLC, housing a music publishing company, music production house and music supervision company for television, film & commercials. TWC Music Publishing has signed three songwriters Greg Ogan, Shari Short & Eric Bellinger, through their joint-venture with Sony ATV Music Publishing. The 2011 Bravo series Platinum Hit was an elimination competition series featuring undiscovered singer-songwriters where talented newcomers battle through a series of innovative songwriting challenges to find out who's ready for the top of the pop charts. In each episode, the winning song will be revealed in a performance by a special guest star, some of the hottest singers today. True Entertainment (‚ÄúThe Real Housewives of Atlanta‚Äù) developed the reality series for Bravo with Steven Weinstock, Glenda Hersh, Tim Bogart, Evan Bogart, David Quinones and Erika Nuri serving as executive producers. The Writing Camp is also a producer. Members * Evan \\"Kidd\\" Bogart, the son of legendary Casablanca Records founder Neil Bogart, began rapping before transitioning into corporate gigs at Interscope and Warner Bros. Records, BAT Management, Casbah Artists Management, and Agency for the Performing Arts, where he aided in the discovery and development of Eminem, Maroon 5 and OneRepublic, among others. When his co-written \\"SOS\\", recorded by Rihanna, became a worldwide smash, Bogart returned to the creative side where he has since penned songs for everyone from Beyonc√© to Leona Lewis. * New York-born Erika Nuri spent formative creative time in the musical R&B; hotbed of Atlanta before relocating to Los Angeles, signing a co-publishing deal with Kenneth \\"Babyface\\" Edmonds' company and garnering cuts with K-Ci & JoJo, Chingy (featuring Janet Jackson), B2K, Yasmeen and penning \\"Fatal\\" for J. Holiday. After a brief hiatus from the business, Nuri rebounded with an eight-week number 1 Billboard hit, the two-time Grammy nominated \\"When I See U\\" performed by American Idol champ Fantasia. * David \\"DQ\\" Quinones was raised in the Washington, DC suburb of Sterling, VA. He attended Shenandoah Conservatory for music education and opera studies before entering Berklee College of Music with a focus on music production and engineering. His studio r√©sum√© in vocal production and arrangements is extensive and DQ has consistently \\"wowed\\" the likes of Rodney \\"Darkchild\\" Jerkins, J.R. Rotem, Ryan Tedder and Midi Mafia, to name a few. DQ's has written most notably for Beyonc√©, Brandy, Pussycat Dolls and Enrique Iglesias * Boston native Greg Ogan signed with TWC Music Publishing/Sony ATV Music LLC in November 2009.

Eric Bellinger is an all-star talent who, in his young career, has already written for the likes of Chris Brown, Chipmunk, Greyson Chance, John Brown, Cali Swag District and Selena Gomez & The Scene. * Singer/Songwriter Shari Short (former Miss Teen Idaho) moved from Idaho to Los Angeles several years ago to pursue her dream as an artist and songwriter. She signed with TWC Music Publishing/Sony ATV Music LLC in early-2010. Shari has had songs placed on Desperate Housewives, Grey's Anatomy, and got her first cut as a songwriter on the Hannah Montana soundtrack. She has written with artists such as Joe Jonas, Matthew Morrison and co-wrote the theme song with Jessica Simpson & TWC's Bogart for Simpson's television show \\"Price of Beauty\\" on VH1. *New Jersey native Sonyae Elise grew up in a musical family being with her mother in the recording studio often.

They were regular performers on the Glasgow live music scene, but also travelling and playing in various locations in Scotland, from Greenock to Aberdeen. They wrote all of their own material, adding some classic covers for their live performances. They also made a number of studio recordings, and a promotional video. Recordings The two significant recording sessions were held at CaVa Studios in Glasgow and The Warehouse in Coatbridge. The Warehouse recordings were produced by Ted Blakeway, who now runs The Foundry Music Lab with Graeme Duffin (Guitarist with Wet Wet Wet) and Sandy Jones. Seven songs in total were recorded, but as the band were never signed to a record label the songs were never released. However, some of the tracks were given airplay on Glasgow-based radio stations. The promotional video, made by film students known to the band, was shot in numerous locations in and around Glasgow including the Winter Gardens at The People's Palace. Record label interest and competitions The four songs from The Warehouse session were used to attract record label interest, which included discussions with Alan McGee at Creation Records, and were also used as the band's entry into a competition for unsigned bands run by Evening Times, where the prize on offer was a management deal with London-based Artist Connection. The band won the competition\\"Beltanes take the prize\\", Evening Times, 25 October 1991, p25\\"Baptism of Fire\\", The Extra, 24 October 1991, p11 but the proposed management deal was refused by the band following protracted negotiations. Attempts to attach punitive contract terms similar to those eventually overturned against Silvertone Records and Zomba Music by The Stone RosesZomba Music v Mountfield & Ors [1993] EMLR 152 with the support of Geffen Records, left the band unwilling to sign. Live performances The Beltanes live performances notably included headlining several times at King Tut's Wah Wah Hut, and also supporting Goodbye Mr Mackenzie at Glasgow's Barrowland Ballroom and Ayr Pavilion during their 1991 'Hammer and Tongs' tour, shortly before the departure of Shirley Manson to front Garbage. The band, although unsigned, bucked the trend of billing at Glasgow's premier club venue, King Tut's, by headlining in King Tut's first ever music and comedy combo, airing for the first time some of Glasgow's leading comedy talent from Glasgow's Blackfriars Comic Club as support. In addition, this groundbreaking formula took place in the same week as another unsigned band were lucky enough to be picked up. That band, Oasis, were required by King Tut's Management to share billing, unlike the Beltanes, indicating the esteem in which the venue held them. The comedy connection continued with other successful collaborations, notably at Glasgow University Union Glasgow University, Freshers Week, GUU - Sept 1991 with the band supporting a Glasgow Comic Club gig in return, featuring comic talents such as Fred MacAulay, Greg Hemphill, John Paul Leach and John Gillick in addition to another band featuring Carol Smillie on vocals. Breaking in other new Glasgow venues, including Glasgow's Nice'n'Sleazy, the band continued their musical development, narrowly escaping arrest along with their regular crew from Hyper PA when Strathclyde Police swept in to raid an impromptu rave in the disused printworks in Glasgow's Herbert Street. Organised largely by unknown street associates of the then Editor of M8 Magazine, the source of the police tip off was never discovered and the band escaped in a hire van as the police swept in and cordoned off the building.M8 Magazine, Sept 1990 Influences The Beltanes music drew on many influences, from the classic Blues of artists like Robert Johnson, through Jimi Hendrix, The Rolling Stones and Cream, to the Manchester music scene also known as Madchester from which bands such as The Stone Roses and The Happy Mondays emerged. Press coverage In addition to the press coverage in The Evening Times generated by the competition win, the band received press coverage notably in M8 Magazine, who referred to them as 'an icon for the 90's'.M8 Magazine, July 1990 Music Scotland Ltd Paisley Band members Two of the band members, Marc (drums) and Mark (guitars, vocals, flute), had originally been brought together musically whilst at school, where one of their early projects was performing in a band with other local bands to raise significant charity funds for the Live Aid appeal,\\"Eastwoods bands' own Aid for Africa shows\\",The Mercury, 24 January 1986, p7 under the name of \\"She Said\\". As their music matured and developed, they were joined by Mark's brother Paul (guitars, vocals), along with friends Michael (guitars, accordion) and Ian Mowbray (bass guitar), to form the original line-up as The Beltanes. Ian left in 1991 and was replaced by Nigel. The band never officially split up, but they have not played together since 1992. Marc is now a business consultant, Mark is now studying to be a lawyer, Paul is now a doctor, Michael is now a teacher, Ian is now a clinical research associate, and Nigel is now a lecturer. All of them still live in Glasgow with the exception of Ian, who lives in West Lothian and Nigel, who lives in New Zealand. Their contribution to Glasgow's rich musical culture of the time is not to be underestimated, developing and popularising many talents and music venues which continue to make a valuable contribution today.Including band members contributions to uilleann piping in Scotland, e.g. at Tional 2000, Glasgow Piping Centre, McPhater Street, Glasgow References Category:Scottish rock music groups ","title":"The Beltanes"},{"id":"20830196","text":"The Monegasque Supreme Court is one of the highest courts of law in the city- state of Monaco for judicial appeals as well as ensuring the constitution of Monaco is upheld.

It was developed by Sumo Digital and published by Sega. The game was released on April 15, 2009 on Xbox Live Arcade. It was also released exclusively in Europe for the PlayStation 3 on April 16, 2009 via the PlayStation Network. Gameplay involves players racing their choice of Ferrari through a selection of fifteen stages in the shortest time possible. The game was fairly well received by critics, with aggregate scores averaging 78% for both platforms at GameRankings. Reviewers generally felt that the game was a faithful adaptation of the OutRun 2 series of games. The upgraded high definition graphics were also lauded. Critics felt that the game was worth the price, however, some felt that the amount of available content was lacking considering the cars and stages available in the series' other titles. On October 13, 2010, Sega announced that OutRun Online was taken down from the PlayStation Network and it was removed from Xbox Live Arcade in December 2011 due to the expiration of their contract with Ferrari. Gameplay In OutRun Online Arcade, the player navigates a car from a rear third-person perspective to race through a selection of fifteen stages. At the end of each stage, the player is presented with a fork in the road that allows the player to choose one of two stages. The left route presents an easier stage, while the right provides a greater challenge. The game times the player's performance, and passing through checkpoints award the player with extra time. Once the timer reaches zero or the player completes the race, the game ends. arcade-style gameplay found throughout the OutRun series. OutRun Online Arcade features four modes of play: OutRun, Time Attack, Continuous Race, and Heart Attack. In OutRun mode, the player drives through five of fifteen stages, selecting them en route. The Continuous mode is similar to OutRun mode, but instead the player must drive through all fifteen stages. As in previous games in the series, there is a time limit that is extended upon passing checkpoints. Time Attack mode has the player race a ghost car over a pre-selected set of stages while timed. Time checks are presented to the player at various points on each stage. Heart Attack mode is an expansion on OutRun mode. In addition to attempting to complete certain stages, a passenger riding in the player's vehicle will frequently request certain stunts and actions. These requests can include passing cars, drifting around bends, driving through marked lanes, knocking over cones, and avoiding crashes into objects for as long as possible. If successful, the player receives hearts from the passenger. Crashing into the scenery results in the player losing hearts. At the end of each section and stage, the player is graded based on the number of hearts received. Should the player reach a goal with a satisfying grade, a romantic ending is displayed. Players can also compete in multiplayer races with up to six players. The hosting player can adjust options for the race, including the ability to toggle vehicle collisions, give a speed boost to allow slower players to catch up, and set the vehicle performance to normal or tuned. Online leaderboards are also present in the game, divided by game mode, vehicle performance setting, and driving stage. Development Partially based on OutRun 2006: Coast 2 Coast, the game contains the fifteen courses from OutRun 2 SP and ten officially licensed Ferraris. OutRun Online Arcade also supports online head-to-head play for six players, as well as high definition graphics. To promote the game, Sega Europe held a contest in which the winner of a race would receive a trip to Maranello, Italy, where Ferraris are manufactured. The game was released on for the Xbox 360 on April 15, 2009, and was part of Microsoft's Days Of Arcade promotion. The PlayStation 3 release followed on April 16, 2009, exclusive to the European region. The release was prior to Microsoft's raising of the maximum size of Xbox Live Arcade titles to 2 gigabytes, which would happen later that fall. Because of this, developer Sumo Digital had only 350 megabytes in which to fit the game. In order to fit the game into the size restrictions, several elements of OutRun 2006: Coast 2 Coast were removed from the game, including the fifteen original OutRun 2 stages, several cars, and the player's choice of a passenger. Reviewers speculated that the developer would release additional content, bringing some of the lost content back as downloadable content. However, to date no downloadable content has been released. The game was removed from the PlayStation Network in October 2010, with the Xbox Live Arcade version being scheduled for removal in December 2011. Sega explained that the removal of the title was due to \\"the expiry of the contract with Ferrari.\\" Reception OutRun Online Arcade was fairly well received by critics. Aggregate sites GameRankings and Metacritic report scores of 78.97% and 79/100 for the Xbox 360, respectively. GameRankings reports a score of 78.64% for the PlayStation 3 version. Individual scores were mostly positive, with only two scores below the 70% range across both platforms. The game was first in sales on Xbox Live Arcade for the two weeks following its release, dropping to seventh during the third week. Reviewers' overall impressions of the game were positive. Games Master UK called it a \\"timeless classic\\" with a \\"reasonable download price\\".\\"Games Master UK\\" (April 2009) GamePro noted the game's high replay value and reasonable price. IGN favorably compared the game to the original 1986 Out Run, adding that it was a great option if \\"you're looking to waste a few hours drifting.\\" Reviewers were mostly in accord in praising OutRun Online Arcades arcade-style gameplay. They generally appreciated the HD resolutions and the other graphical improvements made to the OutRun 2 engine. Game Revolution called OutRun Online Arcade \\"one of the better-looking 3D games on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network,\\" citing graphical improvements to the cars in addition to the new lens flare and light bloom features. Some reviewers complained of faulty multiplayer components. VideoGamer.com felt the online portion was lacking considering the inclusion of the word online in the game's title. 1UP.com noted that though the game was worth the price, they would have preferred to pay a higher price to have additional content and a more stable online experience. Game Revolution also expressed disappointment in the fact that game modes and cars from OutRun 2 and OutRun 2006 were excluded from the game.

The house was constructed in 1818 for then Assemblyman Joseph Johnson. The structure is significant because it was the home of the only governor of Virginia from the Trans-Alleghany region and one of antebellum Western, now West Virginia's most significant public figures. Architecture Oakdale was originally a two- story frame residence. It was remodeled in about 1840 in the form of an Italianate architecture residence. Still two stories, it is basically a rectangular wood residence, with clapboard siding. There is a central corbelled chimney dating from 1818 period, as well as a middle-of-bay rear chimney that is part of the 1840 remodel.

The railcars were very comfortable to travel in because they were quiet (despite the typical whine of their DC motors), rode well on the rails owing to the weight of the batteries, and were pollution-free (no smoke or fumes). They ran on both main and branch lines. They were very popular with passengers, who nicknamed them Akkublitz (Battery Lightning), S√§urebomber (Acid Bombers), Steckdosen-InterCity (Socket InterCitys), Taschenlampen-Express (Pocket Torch Express), or Biene Maja (Maya the Bee ‚Äì because of the sound they made when under way).  History  As a result of many years of favourable experience with this type of vehicle (the Prussian state railways had placed accumulator railcars in service as early as 1907 ‚Äì these would later become Deutsche Reichsbahn's Class ETA 178) and an evaluation of the results obtained from the use of Class ETA 176 prototypes, DB placed 232 Class ETA 150 power cars and 216 of their associated Class ESA 150 driving trailers in service between 1953 and 1965. DB preferred to employ these two-coach sets on relatively level routes. They were rarely used on hilly lines owing to the resultant high current consumption and hence limited range. In the main this affected only those vehicles stationed at Wanne-Eickel and used in the Wuppertal area. The main areas of operation of the class, apart from the Ruhrgebiet, were Schleswig-Holstein, eastern Lower Saxony, eastern Rhineland-Palatinate (in the Westerwald forest), south Hesse, south Baden, and the region around Augsburg and N√∂rdlingen. The last few railcars also worked in the area of the Rhine- Ruhr Transport Union (Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Ruhr) or VRR until 1995. Between 1978 and 1988 the railcars also worked between Aachen and Maastricht in the Netherlands. In 1968, under DB's renumbering scheme, the power cars became Class 515, and the driving trailers Class 815\\\\. Compared to the Prussian Wittfeld accumulator cars, the ETA 150s had an unfavourable weight distribution ‚àí the batteries were located in the middle of the coach body instead of over the end axles, so that in their last years in service the frames tended to sag in the middle, which resulted in the vehicles' acquiring the nickname H√§ngebauchschweine (Pot-bellied pigs).

The Chicago Opera House building took the cue provided by the Metropolitan Opera of New York as a mixed-used building: it housed both a theater and unrelated offices, used to subsidize the cost of the theater building. The theater itself was located in the middle of the complex and office structures flanked each side. The entire complex was known as the \\"Chicago Opera House Block,\\" and was located at the Southwest corner of West Washington Avenue and North Clark Street. The Chicago Opera House was opened to the public on August 18, 1885. The first performance in the new theater was of Hamlet starring Thomas W. Keene. From 1887 to 1890, the Chicago Opera House served as the official observation location for recording the climate of the city of Chicago by the National Weather Service. The theater suffered a fire in December 1888, which mainly damaged portions of the roof. However, the roof was repaired, and most of the exterior of the building remained undamaged. During its existence, the Chicago Opera House was the site of the premiere of several successful musicals such as Sinbad and The Arabian Nights. The last performance at the building was the stage play The Escape by Paul Armstrong (later made into a film, now lost, by D.W. Griffith in 1914). Demolition on The Chicago Opera House began May 5, 1913. The site is currently occupied by the Burnham Center (formerly known as the Conway Building), completed in 1915. Construction The idea for the Chicago Opera House came from Scottish-born newspaperman and financier David Henderson. Henderson \\"planned the scheme and the stock ‚Äì 550,000 ‚Äì was subscribed in six weeks. Thus Chicago had the first fireproof, steel constructed, electric lighted theatre in the country.\\" The construction of the Chicago Opera House was one of the earliest examples of general contracting, run by George A. Fuller. Upon completion, the masonry-clad building was 10 stories and tall.

It operates a 24/7 service for passengers and freight (known as \\"waybill\\") between Metro Manila and northwest Luzon (the Ilocos corridor). Dominion Bus Lines, Inc. at Dau Mabalacat, Pampanga Terminal Dominion Bus, night portrait History The company was founded from its precursor, Times Transit Transportation Co., by Santiago Rondaris who inherited the earlier company from his parents Timoteo and Estelita Rondaris (hence, the name \\"TIMES\\"). Times was founded in the 1960s. The Rondarises also once operated the Shooting Star Freight Service alongside Times to answer the freight-moving needs of Ilocos Sur. Times Transit mostly operated International Harvester Loadstar and some S-Series buses (and two Loadstar wreckers) with white, green and red livery with an illuminated logo on the roof, a few buses with a green and white paint scheme, with Superior Coach bodies built under license by Manila Motor Works. It was also known for its then-unique express buses, based on an International-Harvester bus platform and with Superior Coach bodies built under license by Manila Motor Works. They later supplanted their fleet with new air-conditioned buses, including some Hino buses with the then-new \\"Grandtheater\\" configuration‚Äîmaking them one of four bus companies operating in the North to field them (St. Joseph, Dagupan Bus, and Victory Liner being the other three), retaining the livery of the buses they supplanted. It had terminals along its route, from Laoag City in Ilocos Norte to Manila, and to Bangued, Abra and Baguio; its terminal at the southern end of Quezon Avenue in its northern headquarters in Vigan is particularly well known for its unique style and its flashy sign, which was the first and, because of its unique design, only of its kind in the city. A labor dispute between management and its employees union finally brought the company down in the 1990s. About a year later, MENCORP bought some of the company's assets (including its new air-conditioned Hino, Mitsubishi Fuso and Mercedes-Benz buses‚Äîincluding their Hino \\"Grandtheater\\" buses) and formed Dominion Bus Lines. As a result, its route to Baguio was terminated, while all other routes by Times Transit were maintained. Its main terminal in Vigan is already half the size of its original dimensions, as part of the terminal is now leased to business establishments like a gasoline station and a private school; and, starting May 20, 2013, to Viron Transit. Viron also currently occupies Times' former garage located behind Mira Hills in Vigan, a few steps away from the sub-office of a power utility cooperative. Times' terminal, refueling stop, employees dormitory, and mini-garage in Bantay, Ilocos Sur, which is along the National Highway, formerly housed one of the most modern garages in the province. It now ceased operations, and is currently occupied by food establishments (after its gasoline station, also owned by Rondaris, ceased operations ten or so years after the company shut down). The refueling stop, garage entrance, and employees' dormitory were later demolished to make way for a pizza restaurant, with part of the gasoline station's service bays still standing. The site is located across the street from where GMW Transit formerly parked its buses in Vigan City before eventually opening their own garage in Bantay. Also in Bantay is another of Times' garages, located just beside the Quirino Stadium. It is still standing today (along with some quarters for drivers), rather well-preserved, as it is currently occupied by a soft drink distributor. Recent Updates Currently, Dominion Bus Lines utilizes Mercedes Benz, Mitsubishi Fuso, and Hino buses - some of which are repowered with a new engine, mostly by Cummins Power Engine (former assets of Times), with a supplanting of King Long buses. The principal provincial terminals are at Vigan City (Ilocos Sur), Bangued (Abra), and San Fernando (La Union). Recently, Dominion Bus Lines acquired Higer, Yutong, Golden Dragon and Daewoo Units (also to replace the five old buses won by the Times Employees' Union in a court case).

The gardens have a long history under the Dukes of Northumberland, but fell into disrepair until revived at the turn of the 21st century. The garden now features various themed plantings designed around a central water cascade. The revival of the gardens led to several public disputes between the Duchess of Northumberland and various garden experts concerning preservation and the use of public funds. The garden now belongs to a charitable trust, which is separate from Northumberland Estates, although the 12th Duke of Northumberland donated the 42-acre (17 ha) site and contributed ¬£9 million towards redevelopment costs.  History  The first garden was laid down in 1750 by the 1st Duke of Northumberland, who employed Capability Brown, the celebrated Northumberland gardener, to landscape the parkland adjoining Alnwick Museum. The 3rd Duke was a plant collector, and led a century of development at Alnwick - he brought seeds from over the world, and pineapples were raised in hothouses. In the middle of the 19th century, the 4th Duke created an Italianate garden featuring a large conservatory, and at the end of the century, the gardens were at their grandest, with yew topiary, avenues of limes and acres of flowers. During the Second World War‚Äôs \\"Dig for Victory\\" campaign, the garden was turned over and provided food, and soon afterwards the austerity of the 20th century saw the garden fall into disrepair. It was closed as a working garden in 1950.  Redevelopment  Redevelopment of the garden was instigated by Jane Percy, Duchess of Northumberland in 1997, and has been led by Belgian landscape designers Jacques and Peter Wirtz. It is the most ambitious new garden created in the United Kingdom since the Second World War, with a reported total development cost of ¬£42 million. The first phase of redevelopment, opened in October 2001, involved the creation of the cascade and initial planting of the gardens. In 2004 a large 6,000 sq ft (560 m2) tree house complex, including a cafe, was opened. A pavilion and visitor centre designed by Sir Michael Hopkins and Buro Happold opened in May 2006, with capacity for 1,000 people. The pavilion and visitor centre feature a barrel- vaulted gridshell roof. The gardens include several water features as well as architectural landscaping, topiary and decorative gates.  Poison Garden  Entrance gate to the Poison Garden A garden featuring intoxicating and poisonous plants was added in February 2005. The garden was though of by the duchess herself, who wanted the garden to have something that was different from other gardens. Species of the Poison Garden include Strychnos nux-vomica (source of strychnine), hemlock, Ricinus communis (source of harmless castor oil but also deadly ricin), foxglove, Atropa belladonna (commonly called Deadly Nightshade), Brugmansia and Laburnum. The mission of the Poison Garden also includes drug education, with featured plantings of cannabis, coca and the opium poppy Papaver somniferum. The poison garden is now one of the main reasons that people visit the gardens.

The Prussians rearmed her with thirty-eight Swedish 68-pounder guns, although two of these were later removed. Service history Thetis was designed by Read, Chatfield and Creuze and she was the only ship of her class, which was approved on 16 March 1843. With the approval of the final order Thetis was laid down at Devonport Dockyard on 2 December 1844.

On its right is the foot button for the train horn Sifa is a type of deadman's control system used on German- influenced European railways. Although deadman's pedals are commonly used on railways worldwide, Sifa systems are specifically those codified by German Industrial Norms VDE 0119-207-5. In Switzerland the equivalent system is called 'safety control' (Sicherheitssteuerung).Eidgen√∂ssisches Departement f√ºr Umwelt, Verkehr, Energie und Kommunikation: Ausf√ºhrungsbestimmungen zur Eisenbahnverordnung (AB-EBV), as at: 01July 2016 Description Sifa is short for Sicherheitsfahrschaltung, German for \\"safety driving switch\\". It is usually a pedal and/or large press button, which monitors the alertness of the driver. The driver has to repeatedly press a button after a fixed interval; if they fail to do so, the train will carry out an emergency stop. It complements the external train safety systems: PZB, LZB and ETCS.Ernst Anderegg: Sicherheitssteuerungen f√ºr Triebfahrzeuge. Schweizerische Bauzeitung, Vol. 68 (1950), Issue 15 (E-Periodica, pdf3.0 MB) The Sifa control display in the ICE 3 In Europe the Zeit-Zeit-Sifa (time-time Sifa) is common. In this system, the engine driver holds a pedal or button down for 30 seconds and must then briefly release the pressure. Thus the system can confirm that the driver is still able to react. If the driver does not react after 30 seconds, the system warns the driver, at first optically, then for a few seconds acoustically. After a further short period of time without any reaction the train is automatically stopped. The Zeit-Weg-Sifa (time-distance Sifa) system takes account of the distance travelled, as well as time, since the last activation. In electric trains such as those working on U- and S-Bahn lines the Sifa has for a long time been combined with the driving switch. This is where the concept of the dead man's switch first arose. If the button was released (due to the driver becoming incapacitated) the train was automatically stopped. In order to test the function of the Sifa the driver must carry out a Sifa test run before the train is used in order to check that the train is automatically braked. After serious accidents as a result of drivers falling asleep, where the pedal was still regularly activated, the Deutsche Reichsbahn in East Germany introduced a special type of Sifa (Sifa86) into service. Here the driver has to acknowledge, by pressing a button, an optical signal at a time and distance interval randomly generated by the system.

He played as a defender for Queen's Park, Clyde, New Brighton and Grimsby Town. He then managed Accrington Stanley, Bradford Park Avenue, New Brighton, Tranmere Rovers, Hibernian, Stockport County and Berwick Rangers.Mackay, pp193.MANAGER PROFILE, League Managers Association.Walter Galbraith's managerial career, Soccerbase. Like most players of his generation, Galbraith's league career was delayed by the Second World War, which meant that league football in both England and Scotland was not held from 1939 until the start of the 1946‚Äì47 season. Galbraith played for Clyde for two seasons before moving to Merseyside club New Brighton, for which he made over 100 league appearances in three seasons. He then moved to Grimsby Town, where he stayed for two seasons. Galbraith was then appointed as player- manager of Accrington Stanley in 1953, making 21 league appearances in the 1953‚Äì1954 season before ending his playing career. As manager, Galbraith took Accrington to their highest ever finishing position in the Football League, as they narrowly missed out on promotion to Division Two.1962 and all that ..., Manchester Evening News, 3 August 2006. He once selected a team of eleven Scots for Accrington in a Football League match,The world's most famous club, Accrington Observer, 4 December 2002.Accrington rise from ashes, BBC Sport, 2 May 2002. and fans joked that players wouldn't be selected unless they were Scottish.Dreams can come true, Accrington Observer, 2 March 2006. Galbraith resigned in August 1958 after the club's directors advised him that they would be cutting his budget for players.Club hurtles to disaster ‚Äì Cash-strapped Stanley forced to sell top players, Accrington Observer, 4 December 2002. Galbraith had stints as manager of Bradford Park Avenue and New Brighton. This was followed by a short, unsuccessful stint as Tranmere Rovers manager in 1961. The club was relegated to Division Four and were eliminated from the FA Cup by non-league opposition. Galbraith left Tranmere near the end of the year, when Hibs were seeking to replace Hugh Shaw, who had resigned in November.Mackay, pp192. Bobby Brown and Jock Stein were the preferred choices of the Hibs board, but Brown did not want the job and Dunfermline refused to allow Stein to move. Galbraith was the next choice for Hibs, who had signed Gerry Baker from Manchester City while the club did not have a manager. Hibs just avoided relegation in both seasons that Galbraith managed the club, but he introduced Pat Stanton into the team and signed players such as Neil Martin, Pat Quinn, John Parke and Willie Hamilton. Galbraith resigned from his position after the club had secured their Division One status near the end of the 1963‚Äì64 season, without acrimony or lining up another club.Mackay, pp195. Galbraith was unsuccessful as Hibs manager, but the relative success of his successors (Jock Stein and Bob Shankly) was due to the players mentioned above.Mackay, pp196. In fact, Stein only signed one player (John McNamee) before the start of the 1964‚Äì65 season, as he was able to make a good team out of the good players Galbraith had introduced.Mackay, pp197. After leaving Hibs, Galbraith had brief spells in charge of Stockport County and Berwick Rangers. He died in 1995.

Life and work  Born to an Afro Argentine family (most likely a descendant of western African peoples) in Buenos Aires, in 1897, Maciel received his early musical instruction in a local parochial school, and his first professional performance was in 1915.

There, he met Jos√© Mar√≠a Aguilar, with whom he made recordings in a guitar duo, accompanied by fellow RCA artists. Maciel's skill as a pianist earned him the tripling of an otherwise modest salary. His first new tango under this arrangement was \\"Grief\\" - performed by Osvaldo Fresedo and Rosita Quiroga (on harmonium). In 1925, the pianist Carlos Geroni Flores presented Ignacio Corsini to Maciel, who was incorporated into his popular group as a guitarist and pianist. Corsini's performances alongside Maciel continued until 1943, and their companions included Jos√© Aguilar on guitar and Rosendo Weight; Aguilar left the set in 1928 and joined Armando Pag√©s.La Pulpera The group became popular on Argentine radio, particularly on Radio Buenos Aires.

Her first break came in 1985 when she was cast on the CBC's first nations TV series Spirit Bay, and later, in 1997, she found a role on the CBC's TV series The Rez. She was named chancellor of Brock University in July 2015,\\"Acclaimed native actor/director named Brock chancellor\\" . St. Catharines Standard, July 16, 2015. the institution's first female and first aboriginal chancellor. Biography Shirley Cheechoo was born in 1952 in Eastmain, Quebec, and grew up in Moose Factory and Hearst, Ontario. Shirley spent her early life on traplines with her parents and brothers, but at the age of nine was sent to a residential school, Shingwauk Residential School, now known as Algoma University College. At this school Cheechoo, like many other residential school survivors, experienced violence and abuse and was told that \\"her parents would die if she ran away.\\" After leaving school at fifteen, Cheechoo experienced problems with substance abuse, but eventually, she turned her life around and began to work in film and theatre to explore themes of healing and survivance post-trauma. Her experiences at a residential school and her road to healing are documented in her stage play 1991 Path with No Moccasins. Shirley attended art classes at the Manitou Arts Foundation during the summer of 1966. The De-ba-jeh-mu-jig years Shirley founded De-ba-jeh-mu-jig theatre, which developed out of the children's theatre. After starting the theatre company, partner Blake Debassige, a visual artist, served on the board of directors and as president of the board during the early years of De-Ba- Jeh-Mu-Jig theatre group. During her time at Debaj, Shirley fulfilled the role of artistic director, president of the board of directors, as well as fulfilling much of the administrative roles, actor, and playwright. Shirley is the first First Nations woman to \\"write, produce, direct, and act in a feature length film from Canada\\". Career Shirley first gained national attention with Path With No Moccasins. Her directorial debut was with a short film called Silent Tears, which won several film festival awards for Best Short Film and was \\"screened at the 1998Sundance Film Festival.\\" Her first feature film was Backroads, a journey into the harsh contemporary life of Cree women. The movie was financed and executive-produced by Offline Entertainment Group.Aleiss, Angela. \\"Making War Bonnets Old Hat: Native American Filmmakers are Forging into Hollywood with Projects Involving Real Human Concerns,\\" Los Angeles Times, August 15, 1999. Shirley realized that she could \\"ease a pain or raise an issue with her film work\\" and so dedicated herself to creating film by enrolling in writing classes, director's labs, acting workshops and film schools.Shirley Cheechoo, National Aboriginal Achievement Foundation Much of her art is based on biographical elements. Path With No Moccasins gave Shirley the opportunity to \\"speak about her life and the struggle to retain her identity, and Cree heritage\\".Shirley Cheechoo, Art World of Sherway Silent Tears chronicles the events of a \\"harsh winter trip with her parents to a northern trap line when she was eight years old\\". In order to promote Aboriginal artists, Shirley and Blake Debassige co-own Kasheese Studios art gallery. She is also the president of Spoken Song film production company and founded the Weengushk Film Institute on Manitoulin Island that will train, develop and guide independent filmmakers. Her artwork is inspired by Woodlands School, which is a concept given birth by Norval Morrisseau. Her art has been exhibited around the world, and her commissions include: *Christmas cards for UNICEF *Amnesty International *The Ontario Native Women's Association *The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto Cultural work She is a mentor to many in the Native arts community and one of Canada's most well-known and respected artists. She visits other communities and schools and holds workshops. On the topic of visiting schools to host acting and playwrighting workshops, Shirley has said > the kids that come into the theatre, into the drama workshops, are the kids > that I pick. I feel that they need some kind of self-esteem, and drama does > it. Anything in the arts gives these kids a lot of self-esteem ... the arts > are really important for children and they're not taught in the schools Shirley is concerned with Indigenous people's complacency with \\"small advancements and the slight changes that appear when it comes to equality and respect\\" and believes that \\"We must continue to fight in the most positive way to try and find a level playing field for Indigenous people to work, live, and create in the main\\". In February 2008, Shirley was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award in the area of art by the National Aboriginal Achievement Foundation.Shirley Cheechoo, Indspire She was also awarded the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Award in 2013 to recognize her commitment to education.

The first production split-single engine was built from 1918 and the design was used on several motorcycles and cars until the mid 1950s, although one company continued producing split-single engines for motorcycles until 1970. During this time, the design was also occasionally used for engines with four or more cylinders. Principle of operation Operating principle The split-single uses a two-stroke cycle (i.e. where every downward stroke produces power) with the following phases: # Pistons travel upwards, compressing the fuel-air mixture in both cylinders. A spark plug ignites the mixture (in the right side cylinder in the animation) when the pistons are near the top of the cylinders. # Pressure from the ignited air- fuel mixture pushes both pistons downwards. Near the bottom of the travel, an exhaust port becomes exposed (in the left side cylinder in the animation), causing the exhaust gases to exit both cylinders. At the same time, the intake port is exposed on the other cylinder, causing a fresh air-fuel mixture (which has been pressurised in the crankcase by the downward movement of the pistons) to be drawn in for the next cycle.  Characteristics  The advantage of the split-single engine compared to a conventional two-stroke engine is that the split-single can give better exhaust scavenging while minimising the loss of unburnt fresh fuel/air charge through the exhaust port. As a consequence, a split-single engine can deliver better economy, and may run better at small throttle openings. A disadvantage of the split-single is that, for only a marginal improvement over a single-cylinder engine, a split-single engine is larger, heavier and more expensive. Since a manufacturer could produce a conventional two-cylinder engine at similar cost to a split-single engine, a two-cylinder engine is usually a more space- and cost-effective design. Most engines used a single combustion chamber (i.e. two cylinders), however some engines used two combustion chambers (i.e. four cylinders) or more. Initial designs of split-single engines from 1905-1939 used a single Y-shaped or V-shaped connecting rod. Externally, these engines appeared very similar to a conventional single-cylinder two-stroke engine; they had one exhaust, one carburettor in the usual place behind the cylinders and one spark plug. After World War II, more sophisticated internal mechanisms improved mechanical reliability and led to the carburetor being placed in front of the barrel, tucked under and to the side of the exhaust. An example of this arrangement was used on the 1953-1969 Puch 250 SGS. Early engines using a \\"side-by-side\\" layout (with the carburettor in the \\"normal\\" place behind the cylinder) had similar lubrication and pollution problems as conventional two-stroke engines of the era, however the revised designs after World War II addressed these problems.  Pre-World War II examples  Lucas = The first split-single engine was the Lucas, built in the UK in 1905. It used 2 separate crankshafts connected by gears to drive 2 separate pistons, so that the engine had perfect primary balance. = Garelli = From 1911-1914, Italian engineer Adalberto Garelli patented a split single engine which used a single connecting rod and long wrist pin which passed through both pistons. Garelli Motorcycles was formed after World War I and produced a split-single motorcycle engine for road use and racing from 1918-1926. = Trojan = The Trojan two-stroke, as used from 1913 in the Trojan car in the UK, was independently invented but would now be described as a split-single. Photos of a 1927 \\"twin\\" model at the London Science Museum show the internals.Trojan Two-stroke 1927 Science Museum photo of split-single with V-shaped Connecting Rod. The \\"fore-and-aft\\" layout of the cylinders means that the V-shaped connecting rod has to flex slightly with each revolution. Unlike the German/Austrian motorcycle engines, this engine was water-cooled. The tax horsepower regulations in the United Kingdom resulted in a lower road tax for the Trojan compared with a conventional engine of similar displacement. Trojan also made another split-single engine later with the cylinders arranged in a 'V' formation. The unusual 'V6' design had two split-single sets of cylinders (4 cylinders total) on one bank of the V and two scavenge blower cylinders on the other bank of the V. = Puch = After World War I ended, Austrian industry struggled to recover. Italian engineer Giovanni Marcellino arrived at the main factory of Puch with the instruction to wind up operations. Instead of liquidating the factory, he settled in the town and designed and began production of a new split-single engine which debuted in the 1923 Puch LM racing motorcycle. Influenced by industrial opposed-piston engines, the Puch engine had asymmetric port timing and pistons arranged one behind the other (instead of the side-to-side arrangement used by Garelli). To avoid flexing of the connecting rod, the small-end bearing of the cooler intake piston was arranged to slide slightly fore-and-aft in the piston.Puch's two-stroke double-piston engines asymmetric port opening of 1923 Puch Marcellino design, inspired by industrial opposed- piston engines. In 1931 Puch won the German Grand Prix with a supercharged split-single. By 1935, a four-cylinder version of the Puch split-cylinder design produced and was used in motorcycles. = Motor racing = From 1931 until 1939, DKW racing motorcycles powered by split-single engines dominated the Lightweight and Junior racing classes. At the 1931 and 1932 Indianapolis 500, Leon Duray's competed with cars powered by the 16-cylinder Duray U16 engine using a split-cylinder design. In 1935, the Monaco-Trossi Grand Prix car was built with a 16-cylinder radial engine using a split-cylinder design.  Post-World War II Examples  Puch = Puch's split-single production and racing were restarted in 1949, and a split-single engine was used in the Puch 125T model. The 1953-1969 Puch 250 SGS (sold in the United States by Sears as the \\"Allstate 250\\" or \\"Twingle\\") used with an improved system of one connecting rod hinged on the back of the other. These engines typically use the forward piston to control both intake and exhaust ports, with the interesting result that the carburettor is at the front of the engine, under and to the side of the exhaust. The rear piston controls the transfer port from the crankcase to the cylinder. Increasingly, these models were fitted with an oil mixing pump, fed from a reservoir incorporated in the petrol tank. Some also have a twin-spark plug ignition system firing an almost figure-eight shaped combustion chamber. The improvements tamed, if not virtually eliminated, the previous problem of two-stroke plug fouling. A total of 38,584 Puch 250 SGS motorcycles were produced between 1953 and 1970.Friedrich F. Ehn: Das gro√üe Puch-Buch. Weishaupt, Graz 1993, (German). 38,584 Puch 250 SGS were produced from 1953 to 1970. Puch ceased production of split-single engines around 1970. = EMC Motorcycles = EMC Motorcycles in the United Kingdom manufactured a split-single engine that was used in the 1947-1952 EMC 350. After 1948 the engine also was fitted with an oil pump controlled by the throttle, which dispensed two-stroke oil into the fuel at a variable rate depending on throttle opening, instead of having to pre-mix oil in the fuel. = Iso Autoveicoli = The Italian manufacturer began producing a split- single engine in 1952 for their Iso Moto motorcycle. This engine was then used in the Iso Isetta bubble car from 1953‚Äì1956. = Triumph-Werke N√ºrnberg = Triumph-Werke N√ºrnberg (TWN) in Germany began production of a split-single engines for their motorcycles in 1946. The TWN BDG 250 and TWN BDG 500 models, produced from 1946-1957, used a Y-shaped connecting rod, so the pistons are \\"side-by-side\\", making the engine little different visually from a regular two-stroke. Other split-single models from TWN were the 1954-1957 TWN Cornet (200 cc with 12 volt electrics and no kickstart), the 1953-1957 TWN Boss (350 cc) and the 1954-1957 Contessa scooter (200 cc). The bulbous shape of the exhaust of the Cornet and Boss is a two-stroke TWN feature, not linked to the split-single engine. All TWN motorcycle production ceased in 1957.

It was originally raised in 1824 as the 98th Regiment of Foot, before assuming the title of the 98th (Prince of Wales) Regiment of Foot in 1876. Later, in 1881, following the Childers Reforms of the British Army, the regiment was amalgamated with the 64th Regiment of Foot to become the Prince of Wales's (North Staffordshire) Regiment. As the 64th Foot was senior to the 98th, the 98th became the 2nd Battalion in the new regiment. Throughout the course of the regiment's existence it served mostly overseas in South Africa, China and India. History Mildmay Fane, founder of the regiment =Formation= The 98th Foot was raised in Chichester by Lieutenant Colonel Mildmay Fane in response to the threat posed by the French intervention in Spain in March 1824. It was the sixth regiment to be numbered the 98th Foot. The first Colonel of the regiment was Major General Henry Conran. The first set of colours were presented by the Duchess of Richmond at a ceremony at Chichester on 6 October 1824. In December 1824 the new regiment was posted to South Africa where for all bar two years of its 13-year tour it was based in Cape Town, the other two years being in Grahamstown. During the entire tour no active service was seen. Returning to England in 1837 the regiment was based for two years in Newcastle upon Tyne where it was frequently called out to support the civil powers during the Chartist unrests. At this point command of the regiment was taken over by its most famous commanding officer, Sir Colin Campbell who commanded the regiment for 12 years between 1835 and 1847. =The Victorian era= The 98th Foot at the Battle of Chinkiang in China, 21 July 1842 In 1841 the regiment moved to Ireland but very shortly afterwards was sent to China during the First Opium War. Arriving in Hong Kong in 1842 it formed part of the 1st Brigade, commanded by Major General Lord Saltoun, along with the 26th Foot, the Bengal Volunteer Battalion and the grenadier and light companies of the 41st Madras Native Infantry. The brigade advanced on Chinkiang and after an ineffective pursuit of retreating Chinese forces took part in the final advance on Nanking. During this war very few battle casualties were taken but over 50 died from cholera with another over 200 unfit for duty. As a result of its participation in the war, the regiment was awarded its first battle honour \\"The DRAGON superscribed CHINA\\". A move to Hong Kong followed where the appalling death rate from disease continued with over 500 dying and sick. This loss of life affected the 98th's commander, Sir Colin Campbell; his biographer, Adrian Greenwood, argues that Campbell was suffering from manic depression at the time. The next move was to India in 1846. Initially the regiment was based in Calcutta (Kolkata) and Dinapore, however, in 1848 it moved to the Punjab where, although not directly engaged in the Second Anglo-Sikh War, a second battle honour ‚Äî PUNJAUB ‚Äî was awarded. From here the regiment was one of the first British units to serve on the North West Frontier and spent 1849‚Äì1851 in and around the Kohat Pass area. The governor-general of India, had instructed Sir Colin Campbell to take the 98th on a series of punitive raids against Pathan tribesmen, in order to force them to pay taxes levied by the East India Company, but Campbell refused and was forced to resign and return to England. By 1851 the regiment had been abroad for a total of nine years and in that time it had suffered over 1,100 deaths, mostly from sickness, with almost 200 invalided home. The last three years of the posting were spent in Calcutta before the regiment returned to England in 1855. Following three years on home service the regiment returned to India and the North West Frontier. As a result, it saw no service in the Indian Mutiny. Instead it was employed as part of the Sittana Field Force sent to deal with the so-called Hindustani Fanatics. The regiment returned home in 1867 and then in 1870 moved to Ireland for three years. During this time it dealt with minor disturbance including a mutiny by the Tipperary Light Infantry Militia. As part of the Cardwell Reforms of the 1870s, where single-battalion regiments were linked together to share a single depot and recruiting district in the United Kingdom, the 98th was linked with the 64th (2nd Staffordshire) Regiment of Foot, and assigned to district no. 20 at Whittington Barracks, Staffordshire. The next posting was to the West Indies from 1873 to 1880 followed by a move to Malta. It was in Malta following the presentation of what transpired to be the last set of regimental colours by The Prince of Wales that the regiment became the 98th (Prince of Wales's) Regiment of Foot on 27 October 1876. = Amalgamation = War broke out in Afghanistan in 1879 and in 1880 in response the regiment moved once more to India being based initially at Karachi. It was here that in 1881 the eventual conclusion of the Childers Reforms took effect and the regiment amalgamated with the 64th Foot and with militia and rifle volunteer units in Northern Staffordshire to form the Prince of Wales's (North Staffordshire) Regiment. As the junior regiment the 98th Foot became the 2nd Battalion of the new regiment. The regiment was renamed The North Staffordshire (The Prince of Wales's) Regiment in 1920. In 1959 the North Staffordshire and South Staffordshire Regiments amalgamated to form the Staffordshire Regiment (The Prince of Wales's). In September 2007 The Staffordshire Regiment amalgamated with the 22nd (Cheshire) Regiment and the Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment to form the Mercian Regiment, in which the Staffords became the 3rd (Staffordshire) Battalion. The Dragon device is still carried on the colours and drums of the Mercian Regiment.

Polk Johnson, A History of Kentucky and Kentuckians: The Leaders and Representative Men in Commerce, Industry and Modern Activities, Volume 2 (Google eBook), Lewis Publishing Company, 1912, p. 758) was formed on July 23, 1826 to promote the breeding and racing of Thoroughbred horses in the Bluegrass region of Kentucky. The \\"oldest turf organization in America\\", it was founded by a group of prominent locals, who included planter and politician Henry Clay, Jesse Bledsoe, Dr. Elisha Warfield, and Thomas F. Marshall. Between 1828 and 1834, the Association acquired 65 acres of land in an area of the city of Lexington, Kentucky that today is the east end of 5th Street at Race Street. On the property, the Association built a one-mile dirt racetrack with grandstand and stables to host Thoroughbred flat racing events. After more than six decades of success, financial problems led to the track being sold in 1890 to a group of investors. The economic depression following the Panic of 1893 was a serious blow, and financial difficulties plagued the new owners. Given the low economy, they had difficulty attracting horses for important events such as the 1896 Ashland Oaks, which the New York Times described as a farce after it drew only two entries., New York Times Facing imminent foreclosure, on March 18, 1897 the track was put up for sale., New York Times The status of the track remained in limbo for four years until Charles Green of St. Louis, Missouri, who had been a Trustee for the stockholders, purchased the track in 1901 for $1 plus other considerations., New York Times In April 1906 a fire broke out at the track, which quickly spread to the surrounding private residences. Eighteen area homes were destroyed. The Phoenix Stakes, now the oldest stakes race in the United States, was first run in 1831 as the Phoenix Hotel Handicap at the Kentucky Association track. Other important races inaugurated there and still run today, include the Ashland Stakes, named for Henry Clay's Ashland estate; the Breeders' Futurity Stakes (1910), the Blue Grass Stakes (1911), and the Ben Ali Stakes (1917). Some of the notable events that took place at the Kentucky Association Racetrack include: * On September 16, 1876, future Hall of Fame jockey Isaac Burns Murphy earned his first win. * In 1898 Hall of Fame jockey Jimmy Winkfield got his start. * On January 27, 1921, the champion stallion Man o' War arrived in Kentucky. Prior to beginning stud duty at Hinata Farm near Lexington, he was installed at Edward R. Bradley's stable at the Kentucky Association racetrack. A crowd gathered to watch him exercise gallop. Past presidents of the racetrack include John C. Breckinridge and General Leslie Combs. During 1918-1919, the Kentucky Jockey Club was created to take over the four racetracks in the state, consisting of the Kentucky Association, Churchill Downs, Latonia Race Track, and the Douglas Park Racetrack. The Kentucky Association racetrack closed in the spring of 1933 and its facilities were torn down in 1935. On April 17, 1933, articles of incorporation were filed for the Keeneland Association; their new racecourse opened in 1935, located about six miles outside of Lexington. Today city roads Versailles and Man O' War Boulevard intersect at one corner. The Kentucky Association racetrack's historic gates were replicated at the Keeneland Race Course. The historical records for the Kentucky Association (1828 to c.1935) are maintained at the University of Kentucky library's Special Collections & Digital Programs Division.
