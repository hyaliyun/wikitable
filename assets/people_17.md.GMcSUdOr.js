He served as a chancellor during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang. He took an unconventional path to the position of chancellor by starting as a low-level bureaucrat and gradually getting promoted, rather than going through the imperial examinations, and was known for being careful and obedient to fellow chancellor Li Linfu.  Background  Niu Xianke was born in 675. He was from Jing Prefecture (涇州, roughly modern Pingliang, Gansu). His family traced its ancestry to the Han dynasty military official Niu Han (), whose descendants later settled in the region that became Jing Prefecture. His family was not prominent in political circles, as, unlike most other chancellors of the time, there were no records of any other ancestors of his serving as officials. All that were recorded about his great-grandfather Niu Tong (), grandfather Niu Hui (), and father Niu Yi () were their names.New Book of Tang, vol. 75. Niu Xianke himself initially served as a minor bureaucrat in his home county of Chungu (鶉觚, in modern Pingliang), and was respected by the county magistrate Fu Wenjing (). Fu was later charged with the operation of military farming settlements in the Longyou (隴右, modern eastern Gansu) region, and he brought Niu with him as an aid. For Niu's contributions in military matters, he was eventually promoted to military adviser to the prefect of Tao Prefecture (洮州, roughly modern Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Gansu).  During Emperor Xuanzong's reign  Early in the Kaiyuan era (713-741) of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, the general Wang Junchuo (王君㚟) served as the jiedushi, a military commissioner, of Hexi (河西, headquartered in Wuwei, Gansu). Niu Xianke and Song Zhen () served as his assistants and were his close associates. In 727 Wang and Song were killed in an ambush by the Uyghur tribal leader Yaoluoge Hushu (), but Niu was able to escape. Subsequently Niu and Pei Kuan () served under the general Xiao Song, the jiedushi of Hexi who replaced Wang. Xiao entrusted much responsibility to Niu, and Niu was said to be honest and hard-working. He began to impress prominent people of the region despite his humble origins. After Xiao became chancellor in 728, Niu was made the secretary general of Liang Prefecture (涼州, roughly modern Wuwei) and acting jiedushi of Hexi through Xiao's recommendation. Xiao continual praise eventually led to Niu's promotion to full jiedushi. While serving as jiedushi, Niu was known to be frugal and saved a large surplus for the governmental treasury, and also had good armor and weapons made. In 736, Niu replaced Xuanzong's second cousin Li Hui () the Prince of Xin'an as jiedushi of Shuofang (朔方, roughly modern Yinchuan, Ningxia), and the official Cui Xiyi () replaced Niu as jiedushi of Hexi. Cui was impressed with the amount of treasury as well as supply of armor and weapons that had been stockpiled in Hexi, and he reported this to Xuanzong. Xuanzong sent the official Zhang Lizhen () to verify this, and once confirmation had been sent, was exceedingly pleased. He wanted to promote Niu to minister of defense (兵部尚書, Bingbu Shangshu) and wanted to create him a title—both actions were opposed by the chancellor Zhang Jiuling, on the basis that Niu, not learned, was unsuitable to be minister of a major ministry, and that being honest and frugal were part of his responsibility, not something that should be awarded with a title. This drew Xuanzong's displeasure, and another chancellor, Li Linfu, seeing this, advocated for Niu's creation as a duke. Xuanzong agreed and created Niu the Duke of Longxi. Later that year Zhang offended Xuanzong further and Xuanzong removed him and his friend and fellow chancellor Pei Yaoqing from office. He made Niu the minister of public works (工部尚書, Gongbu Shangshu) and designated him as Tong Zhongshu Menxia Sanpin (), making him a chancellor de facto, to serve alongside Li Linfu, while still letting him keep the post in Shuofang. As chancellor, it was said that Niu was careful and frugal, and did not dare to make any key decisions, deferring all of them to Li Linfu. In 737, the imperial censor Zhou Ziliang () submitted an indictment against Niu, arguing that he did not have qualifications to be chancellor, and further cited a prophecy that indicated that a person named Niu would harm the empire. Xuanzong, in anger, had Zhou caned and then exiled, and Zhou died on the way.That Zhou actually submitted an indictment against Niu per the Zizhi Tongjian, which relied on biographies of Zhang and Li Linfu. According to Niu's biography in the Old Book of Tang, Zhou never submitted an indictment but had merely criticized Niu in private in a conversation with his colleague Li Shizhi, which Li Shizhi then reported to Xuanzong. Compare Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 214 with Old Book of Tang, vol. 103 . As Zhou had been recommended by Zhang, Li Linfu used this opportunity to attack Zhang, and Zhang was exiled from the capital. Later that year the deputy chief judge of the supreme court, Xu Jiao (), submitted a flattering report to Xuanzong, pointing out that capital punishment had become almost unnecessary due to the peacefulness of his reign. Xuanzong was pleased and credited the chancellors. He thus created Li Linfu the Duke of Jin and Niu the Duke of Bin. It was also around this time that a revision of the laws, led by Li Linfu, Niu, and the officials in charge of the justice system, was completed. In 738, Niu was made Shizhong (), the head of the examination bureau (門下省, Menxia Sheng), a post considered one for a chancellor; he was also made the deputy jiedushi of Hedong Circuit (河東, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), but remained at the capital Chang'an to serve as chancellor. He was further given the additional post of minister of defense in 739 and was responsible for selecting military officers, just as Li Linfu was made the minister of civil service affairs and was responsible for selecting officials. In 740, he was stripped of his commands of Shuofang and Hedong, but remained chancellor. In 742, Niu was gravely ill. His former assistant at Shuofang, Yao Hong (), a grandson of the deceased chancellor Yao Chong, had been favored by him due to Yao Hong's dabbling in supernatural matters and claimed to know how to avoid misfortune. He recommended Yao to serve as imperial censor. Now that he was ill, he asked Yao to pray for him—and Yao did so but forced Niu to recommend Yao's uncle Yao Yi () and the official Lu Huan () to replace Niu himself as chancellor. Yao Hong went as far as writing out the petition and forcing Niu to sign, but Niu was so ill that he was unable to sign properly. Niu died in fall 742. After his death, his wife, when imperial messengers came to mourn him, showed the imperial messengers a petition to accuse Yao Hong of extortion. In anger, Xuanzong forced Yao Hong to commit suicide and demoted Yao Yi and Lu. He awarded Niu posthumous honors.

The village of Shawbost has a population of around 500 and lies around west of Lewis's capital Stornoway. Shawbost is within the parish of Barvas. A recent development in the village was the renovation of the old school into the new community centre. The scattered settlement is split into three sections: North Shawbost (Siabost bho Thuath), South Shawbost (Siabost bho Dheas) and New Shawbost (Pàirc Shiaboist). There is a small museum of folk life and nearby is a small stone circle. The village is overlooked by a small hill named Beinn Bhragair, 261 m high. Shawbost is a prominent village on the Isle of Lewis, due to the school, community centre, beach and Harris Tweed mill.  Shawbost School  The new school at Siabost The local school has both secondary and primary teaching units. Shawbost School has a roll of 86 pupils between 5–14 years of age. The school is also an optional secondary school for children from the neighbouring villages of Carloway, Bragar, Arnol, Bru and Barvas. The children's other option is to transfer directly to the Nicolson Institute in Stornoway. The present school building was opened in 1992 and provided the village, along with the neighbouring villages, with various facilities. These facilities include a community library, games hall, swimming pool, outdoor football park and shinty, all which can be used by the public in addition to a kitchen and meeting rooms. The school has both permanently based teachers and visiting staff who also teach at other local schools. This allows the children to receive the best education possible in subjects such as art and music. The school is as of May 2011 the home of shinty in Lewis. It is the home park of Lewis Camanachd.  Ionad Na Seann Sgoil  The Old School has been modernised and turned into an enterprise base and local government offices Ionad Na Seann Sgoil (Old School Centre) is Shawbost's community centre. The community centre had been the village's first school until the new school was built. The building was then used as a nursery school for a short while until the building came into disrepair. It was then abandoned for many years, but was rebuilt at a cost of nearly £1 million and used as the village's new community centre; it was opened in September 2005. The purpose of the community centre was to serve the needs of the local community, both young and old, and of the wider community, extending beyond the West Side to the entire island. Thus the centre became home to many new facilities, including an auditorium which can seat around 75 people but can be folded and stored away so that the room can be used for dances and other events. A museum is contained in the building displaying local historical artefacts as well as much literature about the local history and people, and the archives of the West Side Historical Society. There is also a community kitchen which is used as a café in summer for visitors to the local museum and also for tourists passing through the village en route to another of Lewis's many historical sites. The centre also contains a conference room, fitness suite and a croileagan, which is a nursery in which the children are taught in Gaelic. Outside the centre is a community garden which was created over a number of years. Finally the community centre contains a Youth Café which has modern equipment to keep the local youth entertained. Facilities include a PC suite, games consoles with High Definition Televisions and various musical equipment, among others.  Shawbost Beach  Shawbost beach Shawbost beach is one of many beautiful beaches on the Isle of Lewis. It is reached by one of two single track roads, one arriving at the beach from each side, which diverge from the main road. The beach is about long and has a slipway on the left hand side. On either side of the beach are creags as well as cliffs; there is a coastal walk from Dail Beag to Bragar. The beach is usually very quiet, even in summer.

Shanta is an Indian oncologist and the chairperson of Adyar Cancer Institute, Chennai. She is best known for her efforts towards making quality and affordable cancer treatment accessible to all patients in her country. She has dedicated herself to the mission of organizing care for cancer patients, study of the disease, research on its prevention and cure, spreading awareness about the disease, and developing specialists and scientists in various subspecialties of oncology. Her work has her won several awards, including the Magsaysay Award, Padma Shri, Padma Bhushan, and Padma Vibhushan, the second highest civilian award given by the Government of India. She has been associated with Adyar Cancer Institute since 1955, and has held several positions, including that of the director of the institute between 1980 and 1997. She has served as a member of several national and international committees on health and medicine, including the World Health Organization's Advisory Committee on Health. Early life Shanta was born on 11 March 1927, at Mylapore, Chennai, into a distinguished family that included two Nobel Laureates, C.V. Raman (grand uncle) and S. Chandrasekar (uncle). She did her schooling from National Girls High School (now Lady Sivaswami Ayyar Girls Higher Secondary School) and had always wanted to become a doctor. She completed her graduation (M.B.B.S) from the Madras Medical College in 1949, D.G.O. in 1952, and M.D. (in Obstetrics & Gynecology) in 1955. Career When Dr. Muthulakshmi Reddy set up the Cancer Institute in 1954, Shanta was about to complete her Doctor of Medicine (M.D.). She had got through the Public Service Commission examination and had been posted to the Women and Children Hospital. In the 1940s and 1950s, Indian women who entered the medical profession generally took obstetrics and gynecology, but Shanta wanted to be different. She decided to join the Cancer Institute instead, upsetting many people in her family. The institute began as a small, 12-bed cottage hospital with just a single building, minimal equipment and just two doctors, Shanta and Krishnamurthi. For three years she worked as honorary staff after which, the Institute offered to pay her Rs.200 per month and residence within the campus. She moved into the campus on 13 April 1955, and has remained there ever since. Dr. Shanta is a member of the Tamil Nadu State Planning Commission for Health. She is a strong advocate of early detection of cancer and the need to change public perception of the disease, especially the extreme fear and hopelessness associated with the disease. She has been particularly critical of the metaphorical usage of the name of the disease to describe a dangerous and uncontrollable situation or one of hopelessness.

This program is independent and unconnected to any other international space-active countries. The program began in 1992 as Project 921-2. , China moved forward on a large multiphase construction program that will lead to a large space station around 2020. China launched its first space laboratory, Tiangong-1, on September 29, 2011. Following Tiangong-1, a more advanced space laboratory complete with cargo ship, dubbed Tiangong-2, was launched on September 15, 2016. The project will culminate with a large orbital station, which will consist of a 20-ton core module, 2 smaller research modules, and cargo transport craft. It will support three astronauts for long-term habitation and was scheduled to be completed by 2020 just as the International Space Station was at that time scheduled to be retired, but this has since slipped to 2024. Background After the United States threatened to use nuclear weapons during the Korean War, Chairman Mao Zedong decided that only a nuclear deterrent of its own would guarantee the security of the newly founded PRC. Thus, Mao announced his decision to develop China's own strategic weapons, including associated missiles. After the launch of mankind's first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1 by the Soviet Union on 4 October 1957, Chairman Mao decided to put China on an equal footing with the superpowers (\\"我们也要搞人造卫星\\"), using Project 581 with the idea of putting a satellite in orbit by 1959 to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the PRC's founding. However, it would not be until 24 April 1970 that this goal would become a reality. The PRC crewed space program orbited Yang Liwei in Shenzhou 5 Mao and Zhou Enlai began the PRCs crewed space program on 14 July 1967. China's first crewed spacecraft design was named Shuguang-1 (曙光一号) in January 1968. Project 714 was officially adopted in April 1971 with the goal of sending two astronauts into space by 1973 aboard the Shuguang spacecraft. The first screening process for astronauts had already ended on 15 March 1971, with 19 astronauts chosen. The program was soon cancelled due to political turmoil. The next crewed space program was even more ambitious and was proposed in March 1986 as Project 863. This consisted of a crewed spacecraft (Project 863-204) used to ferry astronaut crews to a space station (Project 863-205). Several spaceplane designs were rejected two years later and a simpler space capsule was chosen instead. Although the project did not achieve its goals, it would ultimately become the 1992 Project 921, encompassing the Shenzhou program, the Tiangong program, and the Chinese space station. On the 50th anniversary of the PRC's founding, China launched the Shenzhou 1 spacecraft on 20 November 1999 and recovered it after a flight of 21 hours. The country became the third country with a successful crewed space program by sending Yang Liwei into space aboard Shenzhou 5 on October 15, 2003 for more than 21 hours. It was a major success for Chinese space programmes. Project history In 1999, Project 921-2 was finally given official authorization. Two versions of the station were studied: an 8-metric ton \\"space laboratory\\" and 20-metric ton \\"space station\\". In 2000, the first model of the planned space station was unveiled at Expo 2000 in Hanover, Germany. This was made up of modules derived from the orbital module of the Shenzhou spacecraft. Overall length of the station would be around 20 m, with a total mass of under 40 metric tons, with possibility of expansion through addition of further modules. In 2001, Chinese engineers described a three-step process toward the realization of Project 921. The original target date for the fulfillment of the project was 2010. *First, crewed flight itself (Phase 1); this successfully occurred in 2003. *Second, the orbiting of a space laboratory (Phase 2, a scaled back version of the initial model) that would only be crewed on a short-term basis and left in an automated mode between visits. *The third phase would involve the launch of a larger space laboratory, which would be permanently crewed and be China's first true space station (Phase 3). Originally, China planned to simply dock Shenzhou 8 and Shenzhou 9 together to form a simple space laboratory. However, it was decided to abandon that plan and launch a small space laboratory instead. In 2007, plans for an 8-metric ton \\"space laboratory\\" being launched in 2010 under the designation of Tiangong-1 were made public. This would be an eight-ton space laboratory module with two docking ports. Subsequent flights (Shenzhou 9 and Shenzhou 10) will dock with the laboratory. On September 29, 2008, Zhang Jianqi (), Vice Director of China crewed space engineering, declared in an interview of China Central Television it is Tiangong-1 (i.e. not Shenzhou 8) that will be the 8-ton \\"target vehicle\\", and Shenzhou 8, Shenzhou 9, and Shenzhou 10 will all be spaceships to dock with Tiangong-1 in turn. On October 1, 2008, Shanghai Space Administration, which participated in the development of Shenzhou 8, stated that they succeeded in the simulated experiments for the docking of Tiangong-1 and Shenzhou 8. On June 16, 2012, Shenzhou 9 was launched from Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in Inner Mongolia, China, carrying a crew of three. The Shenzhou craft successfully docked with the Tiangong-1 laboratory on June 18, 2012, at 06:07 UTC, marking China's first crewed spacecraft docking. On June 11, 2013, China launched Shenzhou 10 with a crew of three headed for the Tiangong-1.China launches fifth manned space mission The full 60-metric ton \\"space station\\" has been delayed to ~2020–2022, and will support three astronauts for long-term habitation.

Tiangong-1 \\"target vehicle\\" Drawing of Shenzhou docked to Tiangong-1 The Chinese docking target consists of a propulsion (resource) module and a pressurized module for experiments, with a docking mechanism at either end. The docking port of the experiment section supports automated docking. Its length is , diameter is , with a mass of . Launched on September 29, 2011, it was intended for short stays of a crew of three. The second docking port, on the propulsion module, was kept screened from press photography inside and outside the module. It re-entered and burned up in the atmosphere on April 2, 2018, at 00:16 UTC. Tiangong-2 \\"space laboratory\\" Model of a Shenzhou docked to a Tiangong A second and a third test station were originally planned to precede the eventual modular station. These would be long, with a diameter of , and weigh up to . The second one would provide life support for a crew of 2 for 20 days, and the third one a crew of 3 for 40 days. However, all the objectives of these two stations were later merged into one project, and the size scaled down to less than . The resulting Tiangong-2 space laboratory was launched on September 15, 2016. The station made a controlled reentry on 19 July 2019 and burned up over the South Pacific Ocean.

This was dependent upon the date of OPSEK's separation from the ISS but after a statement in September 2017, the head of Roscosmos Igor Komarov said that the technical feasibility of separating the station to form OPSEK had been studied and there were now \\"no plans to separate the Russian segment from the ISS”.Foust, Jeff (25 September 2017). \\"International partners in no rush regarding future of ISS\\". SpaceNews. Retrieved 28 December 2018. Komarov: We have no plans to separate the Russian segment from the ISS ... We keep the same position, that we should work on the ISS together with our partners. The previous separate components will be integrated into a space station, arranged as: * Core Cabin Module (CCM) – based on the Tiangong-3 \\"space station\\" and analogous to the Mir Core Module. The 18.1-meter-long core module, with a maximum diameter of 4.2 meters and a launch weight of 20 to 22 tons, will be launched first. * Laboratory Cabin Module I (LCM-1) and Laboratory Cabin Module II (LCM-2) – based on Tiangong-2 \\"space laboratory\\". Each laboratory module is 14.4 meters long, with the same maximum diameter and launch weight of the core module. * Shenzhou – crewed vessel * Tianzhou (\\"Heavenly Vessel\\") – a cargo craft based on Tiangong-1 that will have a maximum diameter of and a launch weight less than , intended to transport supplies and experiments to the space station. The craft will have three versions: pressurized, unpressurized, and a combination of the two. It was first launched on the new Long March 7 rocket from Wenchang on April 20, 2017. The larger station will be assembled in 2020–2022 and have a design lifetime of ten years. The complex will weigh approximately and will support three astronauts for long-term habitation. The public is being asked to submit suggestions for names and symbols to adorn the space station and cargo ship. \\"Considering past achievements and the bright future, we feel that the crewed space program should have a more vivid symbol and that the future space station should carry a resounding and encouraging name\\", Wang Wenbao, director of the office, said at the news conference. \\"We now feel that the public should be involved in the names and symbols as this major project will enhance national prestige, and strengthen the national sense of cohesion and pride\\", Wang said. International co-operation After the success of China's crewed space launch, a Chinese official expressed interest in joining the International Space Station program. In 2010, ESA Director-General Jean-Jacques Dordain stated that his agency was ready to propose to the other 4 partners that China, India, and South Korea be invited to join the ISS partnership. China has indicated a willingness to cooperate further with other countries on crewed exploration.

The station is served and operated by South Western Railway. It is down the line from on the West of England Main Line. According to the Office of Rail Regulation statistics on rail trends for the year 2005, 982,255 exits and entries were made at Andover rail station, making it the 14th most used rail station in the county of Hampshire (including the unitary authority areas of Portsmouth City Council and Southampton City Council). History A disused platform at the east end of the station. The station was opened on 3 July 1854 and was previously known as Andover Junction, as it stood at the junction of the Exeter-London line and the now-defunct Midland and South Western Junction Railway running between Cheltenham, Swindon, Andover and Southampton Terminus.Body, p.54 Andover had a second station, Andover Town, to the south of the junction station on the line to Redbridge that was often called the Sprat and Winkle Line. This route fell victim to the Beeching Axe in September 1964, three years after passenger trains had been withdrawn from the M&SWJR; line. Opened by the London and South Western Railway (LSWR), it became part of the Southern Railway during the Grouping of 1923. The station then passed on to the Southern Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948. When Sectorisation was introduced in the 1980s, the station was served by Network SouthEast until the Privatisation of British Railways. Motive Power Depots The LSWR opened a small locomotive depot a short distance past the junction in 1854, which was damaged in 1856 by a locomotive boiler explosion. The Swindon Marlborough and Andover Railway (SM&AR;) also built a depot next to the station in 1882. The LSWR depot was destroyed by fire in 1896 and was replaced by a larger depot next to the SM&AR; shed in 1903. The SM&AR; was closed by the Western Region of British Railways in 1958 and demolished soon afterwards. The LSWR depot was in the Southern Region and survived until June 1962. Down freight in 1962 Services South Western Railway runs northbound services to London Waterloo, southbound services to Salisbury and Exeter St David's. On limited occasions services run to Bristol Temple Meads and Yeovil Pen Mill. London Waterloo in 2017 Layout The entrances are on the south side of the station, which consists of a ticket office, a heated waiting room, three self-service ticket machines, a small counter selling hot drinks outside the station, a bike locker, and a small shop. There are four entrances – one to the east of the ticket office, used when it is closed; the ticket office itself; an entrance to the west of the ticket office that was formerly used for a drinks van (now relocated to the counter outside the station); and one from the car park. This side of the station is platform 2, with trains going west to Salisbury and Exeter St Davids. Through a step-free subway immediately adjacent to the third entrance as listed above is platform 1, an island platform, which has trains going east to Basingstoke and London. Platform 1 has a waiting room, toilets and a passenger assistance office. There are two disused platforms. The first is a bay platform on the east side of platform 2, which used to serve as the platform to Redbridge on the Sprat and Winkle Line until the line was closed. The trackbed is still clearly visible, but the track itself has been removed. The second is on the other side of the island to platform 1, which used to serve as the platform to Swindon on the Midland and South Western Junction Railway. This platform still has track, as it is still used for military purposes to link with the depot in Ludgershall. Beyond this are disused sidings.Andover Railway Station Talbot, Chris Geograph.org; Retrieved 6 October 2016 Future The new open-access operator Go!

He was known as one of the Eight Immortals of the Wine Cup due to his ability to drink a large amount of wine without becoming drunk.New Book of Tang, vol. 202 .  Background  It is not known when Li Shizhi was born, but it is known that his grandfather was Li Chengqian, the eldest son and original crown prince of Tang Dynasty's second emperor Emperor Taizong. Li Chengqian was deposed in 643 but spared, and his line was bypassed in the subsequent succession, which eventually went to his brother Li Zhi (Emperor Gaozong). Li Shizhi's father Li Xiang () served as a prefectural secretary general during the reign of Emperor Gaozong's wife Wu Zetian, but was removed by her. Li Shizhi himself started his public service as an officer of the imperial guards during the second reign of Emperor Gaozong's son (and thus his cousin) Emperor Zhongzong.See New Book of Tang, vol. 70  During Emperor Xuanzong's reign  In the middle of the Kaiyuan era (712-741) of Emperor Zhongzong's nephew Emperor Xuanzong, Li Shizhi became the prefect of Tong Prefecture (通州, in modern Beijing). He was known for being able, and after the imperial attendant Han Chaozong () surveyed the region, Han recommended him to Emperor Xuanzong. He thereafter successively served as the commandant at Qin Prefecture (秦州, roughly modern Tianshui, Gansu), the prefect of Shan Prefecture (陝州, roughly modern Sanmenxia, Henan), and then mayor of Henan Municipality, to which the eastern capital Luoyang belonged. It was said that Li Shizhi's governance was simple and straightforward, and that he did not dwell on details, to the relief of the officials and people under him. While at Luoyang, he was responsible for building three major levees that alleviated flooding problems that plagued Luoyang, and when a monument was subsequently erected to commemorate his contributions, Emperor Xuanzong had his son Li Lin () the Prince of Yong write the text and Li Ying the Crown Prince write the heading, a great honor for Li Shizhi. Li Shizhi later served as Yushi Daifu (), the chief imperial censor. In 736, Li Shizhi, lamenting the fact that neither his grandfather nor his father, on account of their removals, received an honored burial, requested that they be allowed to be reburied near the tomb of Emperor Taizong. Emperor Xuanzong agreed, and further posthumously created Li Chengqian a prince and Li Xiang a duke, as well as bestowing posthumous honors on Li Shizhi's uncle Li Jue () and several of Li Shizhi's brothers. They were buried together in a grand ceremony. Li Shizhi was soon made the minister of justice (刑部尚書, Xingbu Shangshu). It was said that Li Shizhi liked entertaining guests, and that he was able to drink two liters of wine without being drunk. Although he spent nights entertaining guests and only days on the affairs of state, he was able to get everything done. In 739, Li Shizhi became the governor at You Prefecture (幽州, roughly modern Beijing) and acting military governor (Jiedushi) of the region. In 742, after the death of the chancellor Niu Xianke, Li Shizhi succeeded Niu as Zuo Xiang () -- the head of the examination bureau of government (門下省, Menxia Sheng) and a post considered one for a chancellor; he was also created the Duke of Qinghe. He served alongside Li Linfu, and they fought over control of government, although since Li Shizhi was not a deep thinker, Li Linfu was able to find ways to damage him. For example, on one occasion, Li Linfu told Li Shizhi that there were gold deposits at Mount Hua that could be mined—and Li Shizhi, as Li Linfu intended, then proposed to Emperor Xuanzong to mine the gold deposits. Li Linfu then pointed out that pursuant to Taoist principles, he believed that a mine at Mount Hua would damage Emperor Xuanzong's health, thus bringing imperial displeasure on Li Shizhi. In another incident, in 745, with Li Shizhi also serving as the minister of defense and Emperor Xuanzong's son-in-law Zhang Ji () serving as deputy minister and whom Li Linfu also disliked, Li Linfu had some 60 officials at the minister of defense accused of corruption, and then coerced confessions out of them by torture, intending to use this to discredit Li Shizhi and Zhang, although neither was punished. However, subsequently, Li Linfu was able to accuse several officials friendly with Li Linfu—Huangfu Weiming (), Wei Jian (), Pei Kuan (), and Han Chaozong—and get them demoted or exiled. Li Shizhi, in fear, offered to resign the chancellor position, and in 746 was removed from his chancellor post, becoming an advisor to the new crown prince (Li Ying having been forced to commit suicide in 737) Li Heng. He wrote a poem in which he lamented that after he was removed, not even his family and friends were visiting him. Later in 746, however, when Li Linfu made further accusations against Wei, Li Linfu implicated a large number of Wei's associates, including Li Shizhi. Li Shizhi was thus demoted to be the governor of Yichun Commandery. In 747, when Li Linfu was able to get Emperor Xuanzong to send the imperial censor Luo Xishi () to various commanderies to execute Wei and several other officials implicated, the commanderies were terrorized. As Luo was approaching Yichun, Li Shizhi was fearful and committed suicide.  Notes and references  * Old Book of Tang, vol. 99. * New Book of Tang, vol. 131. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 214, 215.

Life Born in Perth, Western Australia, his family moved to Tokyo and lived there from 1907 to 1915, where his father worked as an accountant at the Salvation Army mission in Japan, and Norman attended the American School in Japan where his closest friend was Gordon Bowles, a Quaker who, like him, later became an anthropologist. The family returned to Perth in August 1917, and soon after moved to Adelaide where Tindale took up a position as a library cadet at the Adelaide Public Library, together with another cadet, the future physicist, Mark Oliphant. In 1919 he began work as an entomologist at the South Australian Museum. From his early years, he had absorbed the habit of taking notes on everything he observed, and cross-indexing them before going to sleep, a practice which he continued throughout his life, and which lay at the basis of the vast archive of notes he left to posterity: he was observed writing by lamplight far into the night long after others had gone to bed, during an expedition to the Pinacate. Shortly after this, Tindale lost the sight in one eye in an acetylene gas explosion which occurred while assisting his father with photographic processing. In January 1919 he secured a position at the South Australian Museum as Entomologist's Assistant to the formidable Arthur Mills Lea. He had already published thirty-one papers on entomological, ornithological and anthropological subjects before receiving his Bachelor of Science degree at the University of Adelaide in March 1933. Early ethnological expeditions, 1921–1939 Tindale's first ethnographic expedition took place over 1921–1922. His principal aim was to gather entomological specimens for the South Australian Museum, the ethnographic aspect being almost an accidental sideline which developed, as his curiosity was stimulated, into close observation of the indigenous people he encountered from the Cobourg Peninsula to the Gulf of Carpentaria. Tindale's family background had qualified him to be taken on by the Church Missionary Society of Australia and Tasmania which was interested in proselytizing in the north. He spent half a year, accompanying the missionary Hubert E. Warren to sound out the area for an appropriate site for an Anglican mission, which as the Emerald River Mission, was subsequently established on west coast of Groote Eylandt. He followed this up with a further 9 months nearby on the mainland around the Roper River. Tindale wrote up his observations for the South Australian Museum in two continuous reports which constitute the first detailed account of the Warnindhilyagwa people on that island. In 1938-39, Tindale teamed up with Joseph Birdsell, an anthropological graduate student, who was under E.A. Hooton of Harvard University, after meeting the pair on a 1936 visit to the US. PDF - Chapter 6 in They were to undertake an extensive anthropological survey of Aboriginal reserves and missions across Australia, and the relationship forged between the two developed into a half century of collaboration. Tindale would study the genealogies, while Birdsell undertook the measuring, and with government support the pair travelled across south- east Australia, parts of Queensland, Western Australia, and Tasmania. In May 1938, the two men and their wives visited Cummeragunja Aboriginal reserve in New South Wales. A later study looking at their 1939 expedition to the Cape Barren Island Aboriginal reserve said that this contributed to their decision to advocate assimilation (\\"absorption\\") as a solution to \\"the half-caste problem\\". Wartime service On the outbreak of World War 2, Tindale tried to enlist, but was rejected because of his poor eyesight. When Japan precipitated war with the United States however, Tindale's knowledge of Japanese, rare in Australia at the time, made him an asset for military intelligence. In 1942 Tindale joined the Royal Australian Air Force and, assigned the rank of Wing Commander, he was transferred to The Pentagon, where he worked with the Strategic Bombing Survey as an analyst for estimating the impact of bombing on the military and civilian population of Japan. In 1942 an Air Technical Intelligence Unit (ATIU) was established under Captain Frank T. McCoy at Hangar 7, Eagle Farm airfield just outside Brisbane, and, on Tindale's initiative it was tasked with examining parts recovered from the wreckage of Japanese airplanes that had been shot down, working out whatever intelligence could be gathered from the manufacturing markings, and reassembling them where possible. Jones states that Tindale's unit's meticulous analysis of the metallurgical débris and serial numbers enabled them to arrive at the companies responsible for producing the components, deduce production figures and infer what crucial alloys the Japan military was beginning to suffer shortfalls in. Tindale also played a major intelligence role in putting a halt to Japan's balloon bombing assault on the western coast of the United States. His team's forensic analysis of the debris enabled the U.S. airforce to identify and bomb the production facilities in Japan. Jones adds two other key contributions by Tindale to the war effort: > He was instrumental in cracking the Japanese aircraft production code > system, which gave the Allies reliable information as to Japanese air power. > More importantly, he and his unit deciphered the Japanese master naval code. Later years On retirement after 49 years service with the South Australian Museum, Tindale took up a teaching position at the University of Colorado and remained in the United States until his death, aged 93, in Palo Alto, California. Film making The Adelaide Board for Anthropological Research began a programme for filming Aboriginal life in 1926, and was the first to systematically do so. Over an 11-year period they produced over 10 hours of footage concerning many aspects of Aboriginal life, from material culture to hunting and gathering practices, cooking, love-making and even ceremonies of circumcision observed during their field expeditions. Tindale produced the film while the actual camera-work was undertaken by E.O.Stocker. Work Tindale is best remembered for his work mapping the various tribal groupings of Aboriginal Australians. This interest began with a research trip to Groote Eylandt where Tindale's helper and interpreter, a Ngandi impressed him with the importance of knowing with precision tribal boundaries. This led Tindale to question the official orthodoxy of the time which was that Aboriginal people were purely nomadic and had no connection to any specific region. While Tindale's methodology and his notion of the dialectal tribe have been superseded, this basic premise has been proved correct. His salvage ethnography also involved collecting by trade objects for his museum. He was meticulous in making notes on the provenance of each object purchased. Philip Jones writes: > one of Tindale's key tasks was to record the names and sociological details > of each of the Aboriginal people participating in the fortnight-long > intensive survey. This had a crucial outcome in that each object, drawing, > photograph, sound recording or even film record subsequently collected by > Tindale during these expeditions could be keyed, not only to place and > tribal group, but to their individual makers or owners.' At the same time, these collections were often made using mere lollies or tobacco as barter goods for precious items, and at times exploited the dire conditions of undernourishment suffered by Aboriginal people. After one successful expedition at Flinders Island he wrote: The Flinders Island people are hungry and in exchange for flour etc have been scouring the camp for specimens. We have pretty well cleaned them up, & nothing of much interest remains\\".\\" In historical context, Tindale's firm insistence on the unit of a tribe, with its set territory and fixed boundaries, flew in the face of A. R. Radcliffe-Brown's dismissal of the idea of a higher integrating reality like the tribe, as opposed the assemblies of hordes. Tribes did not hold land, each of their respective \\"hordes\\" did, and clan-attachment of land was Radcliffe- Brown's basic sociological unit for Australian groups. Neither notion has stood the test of time. In particular Tindale's notion of a fixed tribal territory proved inadequate at least as regards the nomadic realities of the Western Desert cultural bloc, as Ronald Berndt and Catherine Berndt implicitly argued as early as 1942, and in more detail almost two decades later by Ronald Berndt. =Entomology= Tindale made a particular study of the primitive Hepialidae or ghost moth family of the order Lepidoptera. In the 1920s he began to revise understanding of the Australian Mantidae (Archimantis mantids ) and mole crickets. A point of departure was a meticulous analysis of the male genitalia of each species, as a guide to more precise classification, and, starting in 1932, over three decades he wrote several papers reordering the Australian ghost moths. Awards Tindale was awarded the Verco Medal of the Royal Society of South Australia during 1956, the Australian Natural History Society Medallion during 1968 and the John Lewis Medal of the Royal Geographical Society of Australasia during 1980. In 1967, at the age of sixty- six, he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Colorado. He was eventually honoured with a doctorate by the Australian National University in 1980. During 1993 Tindale received unofficial confirmation of his appointment as an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO); this was presented posthumously, to his widow Muriel. Also in 1993, the South Australian Museum Board's named a public gallery in his honour. Evaluations The prevailing criticism of Tindale's influential overview of Australian tribes stresses the dangers in his guiding premise that there is an overlap between the language spoken by a group, and its tribal domains. In short, Tindale thought that speakers of the same language constituted a unified territorial group identity. It has been argued that Tindale's early familiarity with Japanese affected his hearing and transliteration of words in a number of Aboriginal languages, such as Ngarrindjeri. Japanese is written syllabically reflecting its phonetic consonant+vowel structure, and in writing down words like tloperi (ibis), throkeri (seagull) and pargi (wallaby) he would convert them to toloperi, torokeri and paragi respectively. Aboriginal Legal Aid lawyer and land council lawyer Paul Burke, first in his book Law's Anthropology, and in a later essay, argues that Tindale's map of Australian territories had not only achieved \\"iconic status\\", but had begun to exercise a deleterious impact on native title judgements made in suits that have been brought to court by indigenous peoples following the landmark Mabo decision of 1992, and negatively affect their rights to land tenure in a number of cases. In evaluating claims, there is, Burke argues, a tendency to exaggerate the value of the earliest ethnographic reports of anthropologists like A.R. Radcliffe-Brown, A. P. Elkin, Tindale and others, and privilege it over more recent scholarship although the accuracy of many of these \\"classic\\" texts and papers has, over time, often come to be viewed skeptically by modern anthropologists. Specifically, Burke noted that in his magnum opus, Tindale had recognised and mapped in the land of a Djukan people, despite the fact that it was absent from the map of the area prepared by Ernest Wurms. Tindale simply drew on Elkin's authority to do so. Again, Tindale conjured up, or made a separate entry for, a tribe, the Jadira, on the basis of very scant evidence, but there is almost no independent testimony that would allow the inference. Inaccuracies of this type compromise modern native title claims, since the authority of early ethnographers for the \\"extinction\\" of tribes and for their putative territorial boundaries weighs more heavily than modern anthropological studies of their descendants. If, for example, there are no \\"Jadira\\", but their ostensible land was mapped by Tindale, the actual tribes in that area face immense difficulties in proving their links to what is conventionally accepted to be \\"Jadira\\" territory. Ray Wood argues that Tindale's mapping of Cape York Peninsula tribes is suspect, since there is evidence he disregarded the in situ observations of reliable earlier ethnographers in favour of material he later gathered from informants among the remnants in places like Palm Island. Other have noted that the editor of Tindale's paper on Groote Eylandt in 1925, Edgar Waite, changed his drawn boundaries as dotted lines, obtrusively insisting that Aborigines were nomadic, and not place-bound. When Tindale finally managed to print, unaltered, his own map, he represented the Aborigines as filling every nook and cranny of what became colonial Australia, avowing their former presence, much to the unease of many cartographers, everywhere. In doing so he placed a disappearing people back 'on the map', much to the later discontent of mining corporations, which fund research that would revise Tindale's approach and restrict Aboriginal territoriality. David Horton later used Tindale's map as a basis for the maps included in his Encyclopaedia of Aboriginal Australia: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander History, Society and Culture (1994) and the separate map published in 1996. =Links to eugenics= When Tindale was writing up his work on Aboriginal people at the University of Virginia in the 1930s, he worked alongside eugenics scientists who supported a proposed law on involuntary sterilisation of women with disabilities or mental illness, and who influenced the Nazi program in Germany. He also wrote of his attendance at a Nazi rally in Munich, writing of Hitler as an \\"impressive figure\\". A 2007 article looking at Tindale and Birdsell's 1939 expedition to Cape Barren Island reserve argues that this \\"was the last major eugenic research project to be undertaken in Australia\\". One critic of Tindale's work on Aboriginal people wrote in 2018 that it \\"contributed to a larger landscape of objectification and categorisation of racialised ideas about Aboriginal people and was part of a global movement of analysis using the ideologies of eugenics, concerned with racial purity, blood quantum and hierarchies of race, and phrenology\\".

He was born in North Troy, Vermont in 1820 and moved to Canada in 1837, where he began work in the timber trade. In the late 1850s and early 1860s, he set up a sawmill and gristmill operation at Manotick, Ontario with Moss Kent Dickinson. He also operated his own lumber business in New Edinburgh from 1853 to the late 1860s and was a partner in the Wright, Batson and Currier Company with Alonzo Wright which operated a saw mill at Hull, Quebec. In 1868, Currier built a house at 24 Sussex Drive, for his third wife Hannah Wright (granddaughter of Philemon Wright), which is now used as the official residence for the Prime Minister of Canada. Currier named the house Gorffwysfa, Welsh for place of rest. Currier became a member of the city council for Ottawa in the 1860s. In 1863, he was elected as a representative for Ottawa in the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada. He supported Confederation and continued to represent Ottawa in the Parliament of Canada until 1882. During that period, he was forced to resign on April 16, 1877 because his firms had done business with the government of Canada; he was re-elected in a by-election on May 9, 1877. From 1872 to 1877, he was president of the Citizen Printing and Publishing Company which produced the Ottawa Daily Citizen. He also was president of two railway companies in the Ottawa area, the Ottawa and Gatineau Valley Railway and the Ontario and Quebec Railway. He was also connected with many other companies in the construction, banking and insurance industries. He began encountering financial problems in the 1870s and, in 1878, when the saw mill in Hull burned, he was bankrupt. He was appointed postmaster of Ottawa in May 1882. He died in 1884 in New York City and is buried in Beechwood Cemetery. Currier had three wives: Christina Wilson whom he married in 1846 and who died in 1858; Ann Elizabeth Crosby; and Hannah Wright, daughter of Ruggles Wright, whom he married in 1868. He married his second wife in January 1861 and brought her to Manotick a month later. While viewing the machinery in the mill, Ann's dress became caught in a shaft and she was thrown against a wooden post. She died instantly from the impact to her head. Currier is said to have never visited Manotick again and he cut his ties to the business there in 1863, selling his shares of the mill to Dickinson. According to local legend, Ann's ghost continues to haunt Watson's Mill in Manotick.

Formed in 1998, the group has released seven studio albums. HistoryEarly career (1998-2002)= Unearth was formed by Trevor Phipps, Buz McGrath, Ken Susi, Mike Rudberg, and Chris Rybicki in Lynn, Massachusetts in 1998. The band began as Point 04 (containing McGrath, Rudberg, and Rybicki), and Susi was recruited soon afterwards. The band attempted to recruit Phipps while he recovered from appendicitis, but Phipps was reluctant to join. However, when Phipps showed up to a jam session for one of Susi's side bands, Unearth was practicing instead, and Phipps agreed to join after hearing the song \\"Shattered by the Sun.\\" The name \\"Unearth\\" was coined by drummer Mike Rudberg as he wanted the band to \\"Unearth\\" a new sound in the metal and hardcore world. On the small independent label, Endless Fight Records, they released their first EP called Above the Fall of Man in May 1999. Unearth then signed to Eulogy Recordings to release The Stings of Conscience in 2001 and the Endless EP in 2002. During the process of Endless, Chris Rybicki left the group and was replaced by John Maggard. =The Oncoming Storm (2003-2005)= After playing tours and festivals like the New England Metal and Hardcore Festival with Unearth, Mike Rudberg departed from the group days after their performance at The SXSW in 2003, having performed the show in the nude. Also Buz McGrath left for personal problems but came back shortly after. The rest of Unearth would then use Tim Mycek of Sworn Enemy as temporary replacement drummer and Kia Eshghi of Rumi on guitar. Before Buz returned, Mike Martin from All That Remains also filled in for him. After Buz's return, Adam D from Killswitch Engage also filled in on drums for the last two months of the year. With Buz McGrath and new permanent drummer Mike Justian, of The Red Chord and previously post- hardcore band Hassan I Sabbah, Unearth released The Oncoming Storm through Metal Blade Records on June 29, 2004. That summer, they played at Ozzfest and would later begin touring with Killswitch Engage, Shadows Fall, and Lamb of God for MTV's Headbangers Ball United States tour. They would also tour with Slipknot the next year. In 2005, Unearth performed in the first ever Sounds of the Underground tour with numerous bands like Norma Jean, Gwar, and All That Remains. =III: In the Eyes of Fire (2006-2008)= Unearth in 2006 In early 2006, they began writing their next album. After the writing process, they recorded III: In the Eyes of Fire with well-known heavy metal producer Terry Date at Seattle. This latest coup was yet another landmark in their blossoming career, a fact the band were quick to acknowledge: \\"Working with Terry Date is another amazing feat for us on a growing list of accomplishments\\". As they finished their latest album, they performed at Ozzfest for the second time, including songs from the album even though it was not destined for release until August 8, 2006. During the release, they began their headlined Sanctity of Brothers tour with Bleeding Through, Animosity, Through the Eyes of the Dead and Terror. After participating in Japan's Loud Park festival, Unearth and Slayer toured together all around the U.S. in early 2007 on the Christ Illusion tour. They headlined a European tour in the beginning of 2007 with Job for a Cowboy, Despised Icon, and DÅÅTH. Which was followed by a U.S. & Canadian tour with Dimmu Borgir, DevilDriver and Kataklysm that began in the middle of April. It was during this tour that drummer Mike Justian was fired from the band for numerous reasons. To fill in for the rest of the tour, Gene Hoglan of Strapping Young Lad was recruited. They played in the 2007 Download Festival with Seemless/Kingdom of Sorrow/studio drummer Derek Kerswill who has since joined the band officially. The band's live DVD Alive from the Apocalypse was released on March 18, 2008, and debuted at No. 13 on the Billboard Top Music Video Chart, with sales around 1,800. It was also certified gold in Canada a week after its release. =The March (2008-2010)= Unearth in Barcelona (2010) On October 14, 2008, Unearth released their fourth album, entitled The March. The album features a re-recorded version of the song \\"The Chosen\\", which they contributed to the album Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters Colon the Soundtrack. The band recently completed a tour with Gwen Stacy, The Acacia Strain, Whitechapel and Protest the Hero. They have completed the Never Say Die Club Tour with Parkway Drive, Architects, Despised Icon, Protest the Hero, Whitechapel and Carnifex. They have also completed the Metal Hammer Defenders of the Faith tour with other acts such as Lamb of God, Dimmu Borgir and Five Finger Death Punch As of early 2009, it has been confirmed that The March has sold more than 100,000 copies worldwide. In March 2010, Unearth confirmed that they will be playing the Download Festival opening the festival on the Maurice Jones Stage (formerly known as Main Stage) along with Killswitch Engage, 36 Crazyfists and Them Crooked Vultures. On September 20, 2010 it was announced that former bassist, Chris Rybicki was killed in a car accident caused by an intoxicated woman. He was 39 years old.UNEARTH’s Former Bassist Chris ‘Rover’ Rybicki Killed The Interlude On October 25, 2010, Unearth issued a statement saying they and Derek Kerswill had amicably parted ways. The band stated there is no bad blood towards Kerswill, and that the situation is purely based on musical differences. Justin Foley will fill in for drums for their new album. Unearth completed a North American tour with As I Lay Dying, All That Remains and Carnifex and headed to Europe for the 10-day \\"Persistence Tour\\" in December 2010. =Darkness in the Light (2011-2013)= In January 2011 the band entered the studio to work on their fifth studio album entitled Darkness in the Light, which was later released on July 5, 2011. The album was produced by Adam Dutkiewicz and drums were tracked by Justin Foley. On the Metal Injection LiveCast on Wednesday, April 13 Buz McGrath was the special guest. He discussed the new album and mentioned a possible release date. He mentioned that it was vocalist's Trevor Phipps best effort on all the Unearth albums. On January 31, 2011, the band was announced to be a part of the 2011 Mayhem Festival on the Jägermeister stage. Among the other bands billed for this tour were Disturbed, Godsmack, Megadeth, In Flames, Trivium, Suicide Silence, All Shall Perish, Kingdom of Sorrow Red Fang and Machine Head. In 2013, Unearth was a part of the Brothers of Brutality tour headlined by Whitechapel and Emmure. John did not perform this tour due to personal matters. Matt DeVries took over until his return. =Watchers of Rule, departure of John Maggard (2014-2016)= During fall 2014, Unearth released two tracks from their new album Watchers of Rule, which was later released on October 28, 2014 via eOne Music and features 11 tracks on the regular edition and 13 tracks on the deluxe version. In an interview with Noisefull, lead guitarist Buz McGrath revealed that the band currently has an open bass player position, confirming that John 'Slo' Maggard (who had been missing from touring for the last two years and did not contribute to Watchers of Rule) is no longer in the band. DeVries, who had performed live bass on all but one tour since the start of 2013, also chose to end his association with the band (and indeed stepped out of music altogether) at year's end, with Chris O'Toole being selected as a live fill-in afterward. Unearth headlined the fury tour which featured acts like Fit For an Autopsy, Reflections, Great American Ghost, Ringworm and Culture Killer. The band then supported Soilwork on their Fury Tour alongside Battlecross, Darkness Divided and Wovenwar. In 2017, Unearth did a small Spring headliner with Fit for an Autopsy, exalt and Darkness Divided. =Extinction(s) (2018-present)= In the March of 2018, Unearth announced that they would be playing the final touring portion of the Vans Warped Tour. They would be joined by bands like Every Time I Die, Motionless in White, Wage War, Chelsea Grin, Simple Plan, The Amity Affliction, Harm's Way and much more. The first single off their newest album, Incinerate premiered on July 2, 2018. The album Extinction(s) was released on November 23. In support of the new album, the band went on a late 2018 tour with Fit for an Autopsy once again, The Agony Scene and Traitors joined as support. In early 2019, Unearth co-headlined The \\"Death to False Metalcore Tour\\" with Darkest Hour. Misery Signals, Malevolence and Left Behind joined as support on the tour. Unearth supported Soulfly in the February of 2019 on the West Coast for their Ritual Tour. Unearth opened up for All That Remains on their Spring Headliner Tour. Big Story and The 9th Planet Out also joined up on the tour. Unearth is set to open up for Soulfly once again this year for the \\"Blood on the Streets\\" tour. Incite, Prison and Arrival of Autumn will be featured on the lineup.

Construction of the site is attributed to the Mogollon culture. Casas Grandes has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is under the purview of INAH. Casas Grandes is one of the largest and most complex Mogollon culture sites in the region. Settlement began after 1130 AD, and the larger buildings developed into multi-storied dwellings after 1350 AD. The community was abandoned approximately 1450 AD. Casas Grandes is regarded as one of the most significant Mogollon archaeological zones in the northwestern Mexico region,Phillips and Bagwell (2001) linking it to other sites in Arizona and New Mexico in the United States, and exhibiting the expanse of the Mogollon sphere of influence. Casas Grandes complex is located in a wide, fertile valley on the Casas Grandes or San Miguel River, south of Janos and northwest of the state capital, the city of Chihuahua. The settlement relied on irrigation to support its agriculture. The archaeological zone is contained within the eponymous modern municipio (municipality) of Casas Grandes.Not to be confused with the adjoining, separate Chihuahuan municipality, Nuevo Casas Grandes. The valley and region have been inhabited by indigenous groups for thousands of years.  Pre-Columbian culture  Map of major prehistoric archaeological cultures Between 1130 and 1300 AD, the area's inhabitants began to congregate in small settlements in this wide fertile valley. The largest identified settlement is known today as Paquimé or Casas Grandes. It began as a group of 20 or more house clusters, each with a plaza and enclosing wall. These single-story adobe dwellings shared a common water system. Evidence shows that Paquimé had a complex water control system that included underground drain systems, reservoirs, channels for water to get to the homes, and a sewage system.Deeds (2000), p. 49 After being burned about 1340, Casas Grandes was rebuilt with multi-story apartment buildings to replace the small buildings. Casas Grandes consisted of about 2,000 adjoining rooms built of adobe, I-shaped Mesoamerican ballcourts, stone-faced platforms, effigy mounds, and a market area. About 350 other, smaller settlement sites have been found in the Casas Grandes area, some as far as 70 kilometers (39 miles) away. Archaeologists believe that the area directly controlled by Casas Grandes was relatively small, extending out about from the city.\\"The Casas Grandes Community.\\" Archaeology Southwest, Vol. 17, No. 2 (Spring 2003), p. 2 The population may have been about 2,500 in Casas Grandes with perhaps 10,000 people living within its area of control.\\"Archaeological Zone of Paquime, Casas Grandes\\" UNESCO.https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/560, accessed 24 May 2012 Specialized craft activities included the production of copper bells and ornaments, extensive pottery, and beads from marine molluscs. These crafts were probably distributed by an extensive trading network. Casas Grandes pottery has a white or reddish surface, with ornamentation in blue, red, brown, or black. It is sometimes considered to be of better manufacture than the modern pottery in the area. Effigy bowls and vessels were often formed in the shape of a painted human figure. Casas Grandes pottery was traded among prehistoric peoples as far north as present-day New Mexico and Arizona and throughout northern Mexico. The archaeologist Stephen Lekson has noted that Paquimé is aligned on roughly the same longitudinal axis as Chaco Canyon and Aztec Ruins, with an error of only a few miles. Chaco reached its cultural peak first, then Aztec and Paquimé. The similarities among these sites may indicate that their ruling elites also had a ceremonial connection. Lekson proposed that ruling elites, once removed from their prior positions at Chaco, re-established their hegemony over the area at Aztec and later Paquime. This idea, though, remains controversial and is not as widely accepted as often reported (cf. Lekson 2009). It has been proposed, and more widely accepted, that the origins of Paquime can be found in its connection with the Mogollon culture.

Before significant archaeological investigation, sizable portions of buildings from pre-Columbian times were extant about half a mile from the modern community. The ruins were built of sun-dried blocks of mud and gravel, about thick, and of irregular length, generally about , probably formed and dried in place. The thick walls seem to have been plastered both inside and outside. A principal structure extended from north to south, and east to west. It was generally rectangular, and appears to have consisted of three separate units joined by galleries or lines of lower buildings. The eastern and western halves of the city are divided by a stone wall and reservoirs. The monuments on the east are rectilinear, puddled adobe structures used primarily for domestic and manufacturing purposes. The buildings on the west, on the other hand, are open earth mounds lined in stone for public displays. This visual structure defines the eastern side as lending toward the Puebloan peoples of North America and the west as referencing the cultures to the south in Mesoamerica. This visual motif is prevalent throughout the other sites sharing the same longitudinal line, indicating that they were built by a common group.\\"Complementary Dualities: The Significance of East/West Architectural Difference in Paquimé\\", Hughes, Delain, 2005 The homes at Paquimé were circular and semi-circular pit houses and coursed-adobe room blocks built around plazas. The living spaces varied in size from closet-sized to extensive courtyards. Walls at many of the angles stand high, and indicate an original elevation of up to six or seven stories. Ruins about from the main grouping consist of a series of rooms ranged round a square court, seven rooms to each side with a larger apartment at each corner. T-shaped doorway at Paquimé The settlement featured T-shaped doorways and stone disks at the bottom of ceiling support columns, both distinctive of Puebloan architecture. Casas Grandes had ballcourts, though they were relatively small compared to other major sites.Ferguson, 2007 The ballcourts at Paquime are in the classic \\"I\\" shape of those found Mesoamerica, and not the oval-shaped ones found in association with the Hohokam culture in south and central Arizona. A iron meteorite was found in one of the rooms, carefully wrapped in linen. The meteorite is displayed in the Janet Annenberg Hooker Hall of Geology, Gems and Minerals at the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History. Macaw Pens at Paquimé Excavations in one compound produced eggshell fragments, bird skeletons, and traces of wooden perches. Additionally, there is the presence of a row of macaw pens in the center of the site. Archaeologists concluded that the community had imported an initial population of scarlet macaws from Mesoamerica and raised them as their feathers were considered sacred and important in Mesoamerican rituals. A major collection of Casas Grandes pottery is currently held by the Museum of Peoples and Cultures at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. Stanford University in California also holds pottery artifacts from the site. A group of 23 pottery vessels from the site was acquired by the British Museum in 1979. British Museum Collection A new permanent exhibit, Without Borders: The Deep History of Paquimé, has also recently opened at the Amerind Museum. The remainder of the material culture recovered from Paquime is located in the care of INAH in Casas Grandes, Chihuahua and Chihuahua City, Chihuahua. Casas Grandes' ruins are similar to neighboring ruins near Gila and Salinas in New Mexico, as well as Arizona and Colorado. It is reasoned they represent cultural groups related and linked to the Mogollon culture. Early ethnologist Hubert Howe Bancroft, in his The Native Races of the Pacific States of North America (1874), had alleged that they are related to the modern-day Hopi People, referred as \\"Moqui\\" during his period. Contemporary scholars have not precisely identified the descendants of the Casas Grandes people. Iconography The Horned Serpent design is a common theme on pottery from Casas Grandes Iconography can be simply defined as pictorial or material relating to or illustrating a subject, the traditional or conventional images or symbols associated with a subject and especially a religious or legendary subject, including art.\\"Iconography.\\" Merriam-Webster. Web. 29 Oct 2012. In the case with the ruins found at Casas Grandes, iconography has proven to be particularly important in understanding gender differences, especially in regards to trade, daily tasks, and religious rituals. Effigies (small figurines) were found through excavation of the site, thus the effigies show definite gender and sex differences between males and females in society. The similar characteristics of the effigies such as body positions, body proportions, activities, and facial decorations allow archaeologist to make assumptions of how gender differences were portrayed.VanPool, Christine S., and Todd L. VanPool. \\"Society for American Archaeology: American Antiquity.\\" Society for American Archaeology: American Antiquity. 71.1 (2006): 65. Artisans of Casas Grandes depicted a wide range of behaviors and beliefs from rules about social behavior (sitting positions) to ritual activities (smoking) and the supernatural (horned/plumed serpents).VanPool, Christine S., and Todd L. VanPool. \\"Society for American Archaeology: American Antiquity.\\" Society for American Archaeology: American Antiquity. 71.1 (2006): 69. Based on archaeologists' studies of the effigies found, the activities of women and men were both valued, and social differentiation was based more on individual status and class membership than sex and gender.VanPool, Christine S., and Todd L. VanPool. \\"Society for American Archaeology: American Antiquity.\\" Society for American Archaeology: American Antiquity. 71.1 (2006): 71. Contrasting specific pictorial representations of the effigies include masculine identified features and activities such as sitting with their legs flexed to their bodies, decorated with pound signs and horned serpent imagery, smoking, and their penis.VanPool, Christine S., and Todd L. VanPool. \\"Society for American Archaeology: American Antiquity.\\" Society for American Archaeology: American Antiquity. 71.1 (2006): 65. Females in contrast have large midsections sitting with their legs extended, decorated with modified pound signs and bird imagery, holding children and pots, and occasionally nursing.VanPool, Christine S., and Todd L. VanPool. \\"Society for American Archaeology: American Antiquity.\\" Society for American Archaeology: American Antiquity. 71.1 (2006): 65. The effigies depicted the way in which the Casas Grandes people thought social life should be implemented based on gender differences and provide insight on the simple aspects of society. Birth and death of Casas Grandes Various theories exist as to the inhabitants of Casas Grandes, but the most logical relationship of Casas Grandes to Forty Houses to the south and to TJ Ruins and Gila Cliff to the north led to the common agreement that the site is part of the Mogollon culture sphere of influence. Three other theories compete to explain its existence. The archaeologist Charles C. Di Peso advanced the theory that Casas Grandes was a backwater until about 1200 CE when pochteca (traders) from the Aztec empire or other Mesoamerican states to the south turned it into a major trading center. A diametrically opposed theory is that Casas Grandes was established by the elites of the Ancestral Puebloans from the north who were leaving Chaco Canyon and other areas during their decline. The third theory is that Casas Grandes is purely a local creation, a community that grew over time to dominate its region and adopted some religious and social customs from the civilizations of Mesoamerica.\\"The Casas Grandes Community.\\" Archaeology Southwest. Vol 17, No 2. (Spring 2003), p. 2 There is common academic agreement that trading existed between the cultures of Mesoamerica, Aridoamerica, and the American southwest, though not on a large or planned scale. As no system like the pochteca existed in the north, the architectural remains throughout yet share a commonality of knowledge from north to south, that included such ancient population centers such as at Snaketown.http://westerndigs.org/mesoamerican-fools-gold-mirrors- found-in-arizona-reveal-ties-to-ancient-mexico/ Casas Grandes was abandoned in about 1450. It is unclear whether it was abandoned slowly over a period of years or quickly. The Spanish explorer Francisco de Ibarra found the site of Casa Grandes in 1565. The Indians nearby, non-agricultural nomads, probably Suma or Jano, told him that a war with village dwellers, the Opata, four days journey west had caused the abandonment of Casas Grandes and that the inhabitants had moved six days journey north. This story suggests the people of Casas Grandes joined the Pueblos on the Rio Grande in New Mexico.Phillips, Jr., David A. \\"The End of Casas Grandes.\\" pp. 6–7 http://www.unm.edu/~dap/End- of-Casas-Grandes.pdf, accessed 24 May 2012 Other theories are that the Casas Grandes people migrated west to Sonora and joined or became the Opata whom the Spaniards found in the mid 16th century living in \\"statelets,\\" small but well- organized city states. It is also possible that Casas Grandes was abandoned because opportunities were greater elsewhere. Other communities in the Southwest are known to have been abandoned in favor of a new home.Phillips, p. 7 The language the inhabitants of Casas Grandes spoke is unknown. Given the Mesoamerican influence on Casas Grandes, Nahuatl was probably widely spoken but it was not the primary language of the people.

The planned Chinese Space Station will be roughly one-fifth the mass of the International Space Station and about the size of the decommissioned Russian Mir space station. The Chinese station is expected to have a mass between . Operations will be controlled from the Beijing Aerospace Command and Control Center in China. The planned launch date of the core module, the Tianhe (“Joining of the Heavens”), is 2021. In 2017, the Chinese launched the Tianzhou-1 (\\"Heavenly Vessel\\") cargo spaceship, which is based on the Tiangong 1 and 2 space laboratories. Overview The construction of the station will manifest the third phase of the Tiangong program. It builds on the experience gained from its precursors, Tiangong-1 and Tiangong-2. Chinese leaders hope that research conducted on the station will improve researchers' ability to conduct science experiments in space, beyond the duration offered by China's existing space laboratories. Origin of name Deng Xiaoping decided that the names used in the space program, previously all chosen from the revolutionary history of the PRC, would be replaced with mystical-religious ones. Thus, the new Long March carrier rockets were renamed Divine arrow (神箭), space capsule Divine vessel (神舟), space shuttle Divine dragon (神龙), land-based high-power laser Divine light (神光) and supercomputer Divine might (神威). These poetic names continue as the first, second, third, fourth and fifth Chinese Lunar probes are called Chang'e after the Moon goddess. The name \\"Tiangong\\" means \\"heavenly palace\\". Across the PRC the launch of Tiangong 1 inspired a variety of feelings, including love poetry.

First generation space stations, such as early Salyut, Almaz, and Skylab, were single piece stations and not designed for resupply. Second generation Salyut 6 and 7, and Tiangong 1 and 2 stations, are designed for mid-mission resupply. Third generation stations such as Mir, the International Space Station, and the CSS are modular space stations, assembled on-orbit from pieces launched separately. Modularised design methods can greatly improve reliability, reduce costs, shorten development cycle, and meet diversified task requirements. =Technology exchanges= A model of the launcher for modules, the Long March 5 The assembly method of the station can be compared with the Soviet-Russian Mir space station and the Russian orbital segment of the International Space Station. If the station is constructed, China will be the second nation to develop and use automatic rendezvous and docking for modular space station construction. Shenzhou spacecraft and space stations use a domestically made docking mechanism similar to, or compatible with, the Russian designed APAS docking adapter. During the cordial Sino-Soviet relations of the 1950s, the USSR engaged in a cooperative technology transfer program with the PRC under which they taught Chinese students and provided the fledgling program with a sample R-2 rocket. The first Chinese missile was built in 1958 reverse- engineered from the Soviet R-2, itself an upgraded version of the German V-2 rocket. But when Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev was denounced as revisionist by Mao, the friendly relationship between the two countries turned to confrontation. As a consequence, all Soviet technological assistance was abruptly withdrawn after the 1960 Sino-Soviet split. Development of the Long March rocket series allowed the PRC to initiate a commercial launch program in 1985, which has since launched over 30 foreign satellites, primarily for European and Asian interests. In 1994, Russia sold some of its advanced aviation and space technology to the Chinese. In 1995 a deal was signed between the two countries for the transfer of Russian Soyuz spacecraft technology to China. Included in the agreement was training, provision of Soyuz capsules, life support systems, docking systems, and space suits. In 1996 two Chinese astronauts, Wu Jie and Li Qinglong, began training at the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Centre in Russia. After training, these men returned to China and proceeded to train other Chinese astronauts at sites near Beijing and Jiuquan. The hardware and information sold by the Russians led to modifications of the original Phase One spacecraft, eventually called Shenzhou, which loosely translated means \\"divine vessel.\\" New launch facilities were built at the Jiuquan launch site in Inner Mongolia, and in the spring of 1998 a mock-up of the Long March 2F launch vehicle with Shenzhou spacecraft was rolled out for integration and facility tests. A representative of the Chinese crewed space program stated that around 2000, China and Russia were engaged in technological exchanges regarding the development of a docking mechanism. Deputy Chief Designer, Huang Weifen, stated that near the end of 2009, the Chinese agency began to train astronauts on how to dock spacecraft. =Modules= Panel views of the Chinese Tianhe Space Station core module The 'Tianhe' Core Cabin Module provides life support and living quarters for three crew members, and provides guidance, navigation, and orientation control for the station. The module also provides the station's power, propulsion, and life support systems. The module consists of three sections, living quarters, service section and a docking hub. The living quarters will contain a kitchen and toilet, fire control equipment, atmospheric processing and control equipment, computers, scientific apparatus, communications equipment to send and receive communications via ground control in Beijing, and other equipment. A Canadian-style SSRMS robotic arm will be transported into space folded under the Tisane service section. Additionally, the Wentian experiment (described below) will also carry a duplicate stowed second SSRMS robotic arm. In 2018 fullscale mockup of CCM was publicly presented at China International Aviation & Aerospace Exhibition in Zhuhai. The video from CNSA revealed that the Chinese have built two of these core modules. Artist impressions have also depicted the two core modules docked together to enlarge the overall station. Wentian supplemental experiment module Mengtian supplemental experiment module The first of two Laboratory Cabin Modules 'Wentian' & 'Mengtian' respectively, will provide additional navigation avionics, propulsion and orientation control as backup functions for the CCM. Both LCMs will provide a pressurised environment for researchers to conduct science experiments in freefall or microgravity which could not be conducted on Earth for more than a few minutes. Experiments can also be placed on the outside of the modules for exposure to the space environment, cosmic rays, vacuum, and solar winds. Like Mir and the Russian orbital segment of the ISS, the CSS modules will be carried fully assembled into orbit, in contrast to the US Orbital Segment of the ISS, which required spacewalking to interconnect cables, piping, and structural elements manually. The axial port of the LCMs will be fitted with rendezvous equipment and will first dock to the axial port of the CCM. A mechanical arm similar to the Russian Lyappa arm used on the Mir space station will then move the module to a radial port of the CCM. =Construction timeframes= In 2011, the space station was planned to be assembled during 2020 to 2022.China Details Ambitious Space Station Goals Space.com March 7, 2011 By 2013, the space station's core module was planned to be launched earlier, in 2018, followed by the first laboratory module in 2020, and a second in 2022. By 2018 this had slipped to 2020-2023.http://spacenews.com/chinese-space-program-insights-emerge-from- national-peoples-congress/ A total of 12 launches are planned for the whole construction phase. =Systems=Electrical Electrical power is provided by two steerable solar power arrays on each module, which use photovoltaic cells to convert sunlight into electricity. Energy is stored to power the station when it passes into the Earth's shadow. Resupply ships will replenish fuel for the station's propulsion engines for station keeping, to counter the effects of atmospheric drag. Docking Foreign sources have stated that the docking mechanism strongly resembles APAS-89/APAS-95, with one American source going as far as to call it a clone. There have been contradictory claims on the compatibility of the Chinese system with both current and future docking mechanisms on the ISS. =Experiments= The programmed experiment equipment for the three modules as of June 2016 are: *Space life sciences and biotechnology **Ecology Science Experiment Rack (ESER) **Biotechnology Experiment Rack (BER) **Science Glove-box and Refrigerator Rack (SGRR) *Microgravity fluid physics & combustion **Fluids Physics Experiment Rack (FPER) **Two-phase System Experiment Rack (TSER) **Combustion Experiment Rack (CER) *Material science in space **Material Furnace Experiment Rack (MFER) **Container-less Material Experiment Rack (CMER) *Fundamental Physics in Microgravity **Cold Atom Experiment Rack (CAER) **High-precision Time-Frequency Rack (HTFR) *Multipurpose Facilities **High Micro-gravity Level Rack (HMGR) **Varying-Gravity Experiment Rack (VGER) **Modularized Experiment Rack (RACK) Resupply The station will be resupplied by crewed spacecraft and robot cargo ships. =Crewed mission= The Next-generation crewed spacecraft is designed to carry to the Chinese space station with the capability for the moon exploration, replacing previous generation of Shenzhou spacecraft. China’s next-generation crew carrier is reusable with a detachable heat shield built to handle higher-temperature returns through Earth’s atmosphere. The new capsule design is larger than the Shenzhou, according to Chinese officials. The spacecraft is capable of carrying astronauts to the moon, and can accommodate up to six to seven crew members at a time, three more astronauts than that of Shenzhou. The new crewed spacecraft has cargo section that allows astronauts bringing cargo back to Earth, whereas Tianzhou cargo resupply ship is not designed to bring any cargo back to Earth. =Cargo resupply= Tianzhou (Heavenly Vessel), a modified derivative of the Tiangong-1 spacecraft, will be used as robotic cargo spacecraft to resupply this station. The launch mass of Tianzhou is expected to be around 13,000 kg with a payload of around 6,000 kg. Launch, rendezvous and docking shall be fully autonomous, with mission control and crew used in override or monitoring roles. This system becomes very reliable with standardizations that provide significant cost benefits in repetitive routine operations. An automated approach could allow assembly of modules orbiting other worlds prior to crewed missions. SafetyOrbital debris= The CSS will be operated in Low Earth Orbit, 340 to 450 kilometers above the Earth at an orbital inclination of 42 to 43 degrees, in the centre of the Earth's thermosphere. At this altitude there is a variety of space debris, consisting of many different objects including entire spent rocket stages, dead satellites, explosion fragments—including materials from anti-satellite weapon tests (such as the 2007 Chinese anti-satellite missile test, the 2019 Indian anti-satellite test and the 1985 U.S. ASM-135 ASAT anti-satellite test), paint flakes, slag from solid rocket motors, coolant released by RORSAT nuclear powered satellites and some clumps remaining from the 750,000,000 small needles from the American military Project West Ford. These objects, in addition to natural micrometeoroids, are a significant threat. Large objects could destroy the station, but are less of a threat as their orbits can be predicted. Objects too small to be detected by optical and radar instruments, from approximately 1 cm down to microscopic size, number in the trillions. Despite their small size, some of these objects are still a threat because of their kinetic energy and direction in relation to the station. Spacesuits of spacewalking crew could puncture, causing exposure to vacuum. Space debris objects are tracked remotely from the ground, and the station crew can be notified. This allows for a Debris Avoidance Manoeuvre (DAM) to be conducted, which uses thrusters on station to change orbital velocity and altitude, avoiding the debris. DAMs will take place if computational models show the debris will approach within a certain threat distance. Usually the orbit will be raised saving fuel, as the station's orbit must be boosted periodically to counter the effects of atmospheric drag. If a threat from orbital debris is identified too late for a DAM to be safely conducted, the station crew close all the hatches aboard the station and retreat into their Shenzhou spacecraft, so that they would be able to evacuate in the event it was damaged by the debris. Micrometeorite shielding is incorporated into the station to protect pressurised sections and critical systems. The type and thickness of these panels varies depending upon their predicted exposure to damage. =Radiation= Stations in low earth orbit are partially protected from the space environment by the Earth's magnetic field. From an average distance of about 70,000 km, depending on Solar activity, the magnetosphere begins to deflect solar wind around the Earth and space stations in orbit. However, solar flares are still a hazard to the crew, who may receive only a few minutes warning. The crew of the ISS took shelter as a precaution in 2005 in a more heavily shielded part of that station designed for this purpose during the initial 'proton storm' of an X-3 class solar flare. But without the limited protection of the Earth's magnetosphere, China's planned crewed mission to Mars is especially at risk. Video of the Aurora Australis taken by the crew of the ISS on an ascending pass from south of Madagascar to just north of Australia over the Indian Ocean Subatomic charged particles, primarily protons from cosmic rays and solar wind, are normally absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere, when they interact in sufficient quantity their effect becomes visible to the naked eye in a phenomenon called an aurora. Without the protection of the Earth's atmosphere, which absorbs this radiation, station crews are exposed to about 1 millisievert each day, which is about the same as someone would get in a year on Earth, from natural sources. This results in a higher risk of crew members developing cancer. Radiation can penetrate living tissue and damage DNA, cause damage to the chromosomes of lymphocytes. These cells are central to the immune system and so any damage to them could contribute to the lowered immunity experienced by crew. Radiation has also been linked to a higher incidence of cataracts in astronauts. Protective shielding and protective drugs may lower the risks to an acceptable level. The radiation levels experienced on ISS are about 5 times greater than those experienced by airline passengers and crew. The Earth's electromagnetic field provides almost the same level of protection against solar and other radiation in low Earth orbit as in the stratosphere. Airline passengers, however, experience this level of radiation for no more than 15 hours for the longest intercontinental flights. For example, on a 12-hour flight an airline passenger would experience 0.1 millisievert of radiation, or a rate of 0.2 millisieverts per day; only 1/5 the rate experienced by an astronaut in LEO. International co-operation Cooperation in the field of crewed space flight between the CMSEO and the Italian Space Agency was examined in 2011, participation in the development of China crewed space stations and cooperation with China in the fields such as astronauts flight, and scientific research was discussed. Potential areas and ways for future cooperation in the fields of development of crewed space station, space medicine and space science have also been discussed during the meeting. On 22 February 2017, the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA) and Italian Space Agency (ASI) signed an agreement to cooperate on long-term human spaceflight activities. The consequences of this agreement could be important, considering, on the one hand, the leading position Italy has achieved in the field of human spaceflight with regard to the creation and exploitation of the International Space Station (Node 2, Node 3, Columbus, Cupola, Leonardo, Raffaello, Donatello, PMM etc.) and, on the other hand, the important human spaceflight programme that China is developing, especially with the creation of the Tiangong-3 Space Station. End of orbit The Chinese large modular space station is designed to be used for 10 years and will accommodate three astronauts. Chinese crewed spacecraft use deorbital burns to slow their velocity, resulting in their re-entry to the Earth's atmosphere. Vehicles carrying a crew have a heat shield which prevents the vehicle's destruction caused by aerodynamic heating upon contact with the Earth's atmosphere. The CSS has no heat-shield; however, small parts of space stations can reach the surface of the Earth, so uninhabited areas will be targeted for de-orbit manoeuvres.

It is used as an adverb such as in \\"hella bad\\" or \\"hella good\\" and was eventually added to the Oxford English Dictionary in 2002. It is possibly a contraction of the phrase \\"hell of a\\" or \\"hell of a lot [of]\\", in turn reduced to \\"hell of\\", though some scholars doubt this etymology since its grammatical usage does not align with those phrases. It often appears in place of the words \\"really\\", \\"a lot\\", \\"totally\\", \\"very\\", and in some cases, \\"yes\\". Whereas hell of a is generally used with a noun, according to linguist Pamela Munro, hella is primarily used to modify an adjective such as \\"good\\". According to lexicographer Allan A. Metcalf, the word is a marker of northern California dialect. According to Colleen Cotter, \\"Southern Californians know the term ... but rarely use it.\\" Sometimes the term grippa is used to mock \\"NorCal\\" dialect, with the actual meaning being the opposite of hella. HistoryEarly use= Hella has likely existed in California English since at least the mid-1970s. By 1993, Mary Bucholtz, a linguist at the University of California, Santa Barbara, collated materials from an urban high school (Mount Eden High School) in the Bay Area and found that hella was \\"used among Bay Area youth of all racial, ethnic, and socio-economic backgrounds and both genders.\\" Hella remains part of the dialect of northern California, where it has grown in popularity. =Spread= By 1997 the word had spread to hip hop culture, though it remained a primarily West Coast term. With the release of the 2001 No Doubt song \\"Hella Good,\\" one Virginian transplant in California \\"fear[ed] the worst: nationwide acceptance of this wretched term.\\" Since the early 1990s hella has been used regularly in the Pacific Northwest as a common slang term, particularly in Seattle and Portland, Oregon. Popular area rappers Blue Scholars and Macklemore regularly use the term in their lyrics; Macklemore uses the word several times in his worldwide hit songThrift Shop (song)#Weekly charts \\"Thrift Shop\\". In the South Park episode \\"Spookyfish,\\" which was the 1998 Halloween special, the character Cartman repeatedly used the term hella to the annoyance of the other characters, which contributed to its currency spreading nationally. \\"You guys are hella stupid\\" is one of the phrases spoken by a talking Cartman doll released in 2006. The Sacramento- based band Hella chose its name for the regional association; Zach Hill says \\"It's everywhere up here.... We thought it was funny, and everyone says it all the time.\\" Hella was included on the BBC's list of 20 words that sum up the 2000-2009 decade, defined as \\"An intensive in Youthspeak, generally substituting for the word very\\". Paralleling the use of the minced oath heck, some people use hecka in place of hella. Younger school children may be required to use this form. Church culture in Northern California also encouraged usage of hecka over hella. The Prince song \\"U Got The Look,\\" released in 1987 on the album Sign o' the Times, features the lyric \\"your body's hecka slammin'...\\", which would appear to be an early adoption of the term hecka in its accepted vernacular usage. UsageIntensifier= While intensifiers similar to hella exist in many colloquial varieties, hella is uncommonly flexible. It can be used to modify almost any part of speech, as shown below: *That pizza was hella good: hella modifies the adjective good, where Standard American English would use very. *Chris's pizza is hella better than anyone else's: hella modifies the adjective better, replacing much. *I ate hella pizza: hella modifies the noun pizza, replacing a lot of. *I hella bought four pizzas: hella modifies the verb to buy, replacing really or totally. *I ran to the pizza joint hella quickly: hella modifies the adverb quickly, replacing very. =SI prefix= An online petition begun in 2010 by Austin Sendek of Yreka, California seeks to establish \\"hella-\\" as the SI prefix for 1027. The prefix was recognized by Google in May 2010, and Wolfram Alpha in May 2011. In 2013, Andrew McAfee suggested the term hellabyte with this usage.

The only ancient writers who mention him are Gennadius, presbyter of Massilia (end of 5th century), in his De scriptoribus ecclesiasticis, and Pope Gelasius in De libris recipiendis et non recipiendis, in which his works are classed as Apocryphi, probably on account of certain heterodox statements contained in them. Commodianus is supposed to have been from Roman Africa, partly on the ground of his similarity to Cyprian, partly because the African school was the chief center of Christian Latinity in the third century; a Syrian origin has also been suggested.Joseph Martin, Studien und Beiträge Erklärung und Zeitbestimmung Commodians, p. 138; from Texte und Untersuchungen, Band 39; repr. Gorgias Press, 2010. As he himself tells us, he was originally a heathen, but was converted to Christianity when advanced in years, and felt called upon to instruct the ignorant in the truth. He was the author of two extant Latin poems, Instructiones and Carmen apologeticum (first published in 1852 by J. B. Pitra in the Spicilegium Solesmense, from an MS. in the Middlehill collection, now at Cheltenham, supposed to have been brought from the monastery of Bobbio). The Instructiones consist of 80 poems, each of which is an acrostic (with the exception of poem 60, where the initial letters are in alphabetical order). The initials of poem 80, read backwards, give Commodianus Mendicus Christi. The Carmen Apologeticum, undoubtedly by Commodianus, although the name of the author (as well as the title) is absent from the MS., is free from the acrostic restriction. The first part of the Instructiones is addressed to the heathens and Jews, and ridicules the divinities of classical mythology; the second contains reflections on Antichrist, the end of the world, the Resurrection, and advice to Christians, penitents, and the clergy. In the Apologeticum all mankind are exhorted to repent, in view of the approaching end of the world. The appearance of Antichrist, identified with Nero and the Man from the East, is expected at an early date. Although they display fiery dogmatic zeal, the poems cannot be considered quite orthodox. To the classical scholar the metre alone is of interest. Although they are professedly written in hexameters, the rules of quantity are sacrificed to accent. The first four lines of the Instructiones may be quoted by way of illustration: :Praefatio nostra viam erranti demonstrat :Respectumque bonum, cum venerit saeculi meta :Aeternum fieri, quod discredunt inscia corda: :Ego similiter erravi tempore multo. These versus politici (as they are called) show that the change was already passing over Latin which resulted in the formation of the Romance languages. The use of cases and genders, the construction of verb, and prepositions, and the verbal forms exhibit striking irregularities. The author, however, shows an acquaintance with Latin poets Horace, Virgil, and Lucretius. ReferencesEditions *Poinsotte, Jean-Michel (ed., trans.). Commodien.

It is usually quoted at [standard temperature and pressure], the 2014 CODATA recommended valueCODATA Recommended Values of the Fundamental Physical Constants:2014 , is per cubic metre at 0 °C and 1 atm and the 2006 CODATA recommended value was 2.686 7774(47) per cubic metre at 0 °C and 1 atm. It is named after the Austrian physicist Johann Josef Loschmidt, who was the first to estimate the physical size of molecules in 1865.. The term \\"Loschmidt constant\\" is also sometimes used to refer to the Avogadro constant, particularly in German texts. The Loschmidt constant is given by the relationship: :n_0 = \\\\frac{p_0}{k_{\\\\rm B}T_0} where p0 is the pressure, kB is the Boltzmann constant and T0 is the thermodynamic temperature. It is related to the Avogadro constant, NA, by: :n_0 = \\\\frac{p_0N_{\\\\rm A}}{RT_0} where R is the gas constant. Being a measure of number density, the Loschmidt constant is used to define the amagat, a practical unit of number density for gases and other substances: :1 amagat = n0 = , such that the Loschmidt constant is exactly 1 amagat.  Modern determinations  In the CODATA set of recommended values for physical constants, the Loschmidt constant is calculated from the gas constant and the Avogadro constant: :n_0 = \\\\frac{N_{\\\\rm A}}{R}\\\\frac{p_0}{T_0} = \\\\frac{A_{\\\\rm r}({\\\\rm e})M_{\\\\rm u}c\\\\alpha^2}{2R_{\\\\infty}hR}\\\\frac{p_0}{T_0} where A(e) is the relative atomic mass of the electron, M is the molar mass constant, c is the speed of light, α is the fine structure constant, R is the Rydberg constant and h is the Planck constant. The pressure and temperature can be chosen freely, and must be quoted with values of the Loschmidt constant. The precision to which the Loschmidt constant is currently known is limited entirely by the uncertainty in the value of the gas constant.  First determinations  Loschmidt did not actually calculate a value for the constant which now bears his name, but it is a simple and logical manipulation of his published results. James Clerk Maxwell described the paper in these terms in a public lecture eight years later: > Loschmidt has deduced from the dynamical theory the following remarkable > proportion:—As the volume of a gas is to the combined volume of all the > molecules contained in it, so is the mean path of a molecule to one-eighth > of the diameter of a molecule. To derive this \\"remarkable proportion\\", Loschmidt started from Maxwell's own definition of the mean free path: :\\\\ell = \\\\frac{3}{4n_0\\\\pi d^2} where n has the same sense as the Loschmidt constant, that is the number of molecules per unit volume, and d is the effective diameter of the molecules (assumed to be spherical). This rearranges to :\\\\frac{1}{n_0} = \\\\frac{16}{3}\\\\frac{\\\\pi\\\\ell d^2}{4} where 1/n is the volume occupied by each molecule in the gas phase and πℓd/4 is the volume of the cylinder made by the molecule in its trajectory between two collisions. However, the true volume of each molecule is given by πd/6, and so n'πd/6 is the volume occupied by all the molecules not counting the empty space between them. Loschmidt equated this volume with the volume of the liquified gas. Dividing both sides of the equation by n'πd/6 has the effect of introducing a factor of V/V, which Loschmidt called the \\"condensation coefficient\\" and which is experimentally measurable. The equation reduces to: :d = 8\\\\frac{V_{\\\\rm l}}{V_{\\\\rm g}}\\\\ell relating the diameter of a gas molecule to measurable phenomena. The number density, the constant which now bears Loschmidt's name, can be found by simply substituting the diameter of the molecule into the definition of the mean free path and rearranging: :n_0 = \\\\left (\\\\frac{V_{\\\\rm g}}{V_{\\\\rm l}}\\\\right )^2 \\\\frac{3}{256\\\\pi\\\\ell^3} Instead of taking this step, Loschmidt decided to estimate the mean diameter of the molecules in air. This was no minor undertaking, as the condensation coefficient was unknown and had to be estimated–it would be another twelve years before Pictet and Cailletet would liquify nitrogen for the first time. The mean free path was also uncertain. Nevertheless, Loschmidt arrived at a diameter of about one nanometre, of the correct order of magnitude. Loschmidt's estimated data for air give a value of n = 1.81 m. Eight years later, Maxwell was citing a figure of \\"about 19 million million million\\" per cm, or 1.9 m.

Tucker is an aspiring Canadian documentary film-maker who is a tenant in the building. Other cast members included John Candy and Catherine O'Hara who both subsequently starred in Second City Television (aka SCTV) and feature films. Dan Aykroyd, who played the building superintendent, appeared in this series concurrently with his star-making turn on Saturday Night Live. Candy and O'Hara actually appeared on Rosie concurrently with their early episodes of SCTV, while Candy was also a regular on the sitcom The David Steinberg Show during this period. Many of the actors in this series also appeared in the less successful 1974-1975 CBC series Dr. Zonk and the Zunkins.

(The former names are traditional ones, derived from the ancient Greek; the latter have become common in recent decades. These names reflect a basic concept in number theory, the 2-order of an integer: how many times the integer can be divided by 2. This is equivalent to the multiplicity of 2 in the prime factorization. A singly even number can be divided by 2 only once; it is even but its quotient by 2 is odd. A doubly even number is an integer that is divisible more than once by 2; it is even and its quotient by 2 is also even. The separate consideration of oddly and evenly even numbers is useful in many parts of mathematics, especially in number theory, combinatorics, coding theory (see even codes), among others. Definitions The ancient Greek terms \\"even-times-even\\" and \\"even-times-odd\\" were given various inequivalent definitions by Euclid and later writers such as Nicomachus. Today, there is a standard development of the concepts. The 2-order or 2-adic order is simply a special case of the p-adic order at a general prime number p; see p-adic number for more on this broad area of mathematics. Many of the following definitions generalize directly to other primes. For an integer n, the 2-order of n (also called valuation) is the largest natural number ν such that 2ν divides n. This definition applies to positive and negative numbers n, although some authors restrict it to positive n; and one may define the 2-order of 0 to be infinity (see also parity of zero). The 2-order of n is written ν2(n) or ord2(n). It is not to be confused with the multiplicative order modulo 2. The 2-order provides a unified description of various classes of integers defined by evenness: *Odd numbers are those with ν2(n) = 0, i.e., integers of the form . *Even numbers are those with ν2(n) > 0, i.e., integers of the form . In particular: **Singly even numbers are those with ν2(n) = 1, i.e., integers of the form . **Doubly even numbers are those with ν2(n) > 1, i.e., integers of the form . ***In this terminology, a doubly even number may or may not be divisible by 8, so there is no particular terminology for \\"triply even\\" numbers in pure math, although it is used in children's teaching materials including higher multiples such as \\"quadruply even.\\"url=https://www.parleybot.com/p/double-triple-quadruple-even- number.html  Multiple-evens Online Calculator One can also extend the 2-order to the rational numbers by defining ν2(q) to be the unique integer ν where :q = 2^ u\\\\frac{a}{b} and a and b are both odd. For example, half-integers have a negative 2-order, namely −1\\\\. Finally, by defining the 2-adic norm, :n_2 = 2^{- u_2(n)}, one is well on the way to constructing the 2-adic numbers. ApplicationsSafer outs in darts= The object of the game of darts is to reach a score of 0, so the player with the smaller score is in a better position to win. At the beginning of a leg, \\"smaller\\" has the usual meaning of absolute value, and the basic strategy is to aim at high-value areas on the dartboard and score as many points as possible. At the end of a leg, since one needs to double out to win, the 2-adic norm becomes the relevant measure. With any odd score no matter how small in absolute value, it takes at least two darts to win. Any even score between 2 and 40 can be satisfied with a single dart, and 40 is a much more desirable score than 2, due to the effects of missing. A common miss when aiming at the double ring is to hit a single instead and accidentally halve one's score. Given a score of 22 — a singly even number — one has a game shot for double 11. If one hits single 11, the new score is 11, which is odd, and it will take at least two further darts to recover. By contrast, when shooting for double 12, one may make the same mistake but still have 3 game shots in a row: D12, D6, and D3. Generally, with a score of , one has such game shots. This is why is such a desirable score: it splits 5 times. =Irrationality of the square root of 2= The classic proof that the square root of 2 is irrational operates by infinite descent. Usually, the descent part of the proof is abstracted away by assuming (or proving) the existence of irreducible representations of rational numbers. An alternate approach is to exploit the existence of the ν2 operator. Assume by contradiction that :\\\\sqrt2 = a / b, where a and b are non-zero natural numbers. Square both sides of the equality and apply the 2-order valuation operator ν2 to : : u_2(2b^2) = u_2(a^2) : u_2(b^2) + 1 = u_2(a^2) :2 u_2(b) + 1 = 2 u_2(a) : u_2(a) - u_2(b) = \\\\frac12 Since 2-order valuations are integers, the difference cannot be equal to the rational \\\\frac12. By contradiction, therefore, is not a rational. More concretely, since the valuation of 2b2 is odd, while valuation of a2 is even, they must be distinct integers, so that 2 b^2 - a^2 \\\\geq 1. An easy calculation then yields a lower bound of \\\\frac{1}{3b^2} for the difference \\\\sqrt2 - a / b, yielding a direct proof of irrationality not relying on the law of excluded middle. =Geometric topology= In geometric topology, many properties of manifolds depend only on their dimension mod 4 or mod 8; thus one often studies manifolds of singly even and doubly even dimension (4k+2 and 4k) as classes. For example, doubly even-dimensional manifolds have a symmetric nondegenerate bilinear form on their middle-dimension cohomology group, which thus has an integer-valued signature. Conversely, singly even-dimensional manifolds have a skew-symmetric nondegenerate bilinear form on their middle dimension; if one defines a quadratic refinement of this to a quadratic form (as on a framed manifold), one obtains the Arf invariant as a mod 2 invariant. Odd-dimensional manifolds, by contrast, do not have these invariants, though in algebraic surgery theory one may define more complicated invariants. This 4-fold and 8-fold periodicity in the structure of manifolds is related to the 4-fold periodicity of L-theory and the 8-fold periodicity of real topological K-theory, which is known as Bott periodicity. If a compact oriented smooth spin manifold has dimension , or exactly, then its signature is an integer multiple of 16.Ochanine, Serge, \\"Signature modulo 16, invariants de Kervaire généralisés et nombres caractéristiques dans la K-théorie réelle\\", Mém. Soc. Math. France 1980/81, no. 5, 142 pp. =Other appearances= A singly even number cannot be a powerful number. It cannot be represented as a difference of two squares. However, a singly even number can be represented as the difference of two pronic numbers or of two powerful numbers.* In group theory, it is relatively simpleSee, for example: to show that the order of a nonabelian finite simple group cannot be a singly even number. In fact, by the Feit–Thompson theorem, it cannot be odd either, so every such group has doubly even order. Lambert's continued fraction for the tangent function gives the following continued fraction involving the positive singly even numbers: :\\\\tanh \\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{e - 1}{e + 1} = 0 + \\\\cfrac{1}{2 + \\\\cfrac{1}{6 + \\\\cfrac{1}{10 + \\\\cfrac{1}{14 + \\\\cfrac{1}{\\\\ddots}}}}} This expression leads to similar representations of . In organic chemistry, Hückel's rule, also known as the 4n + 2 rule, predicts that a cyclic π-bond system containing a singly even number of p electrons will be aromatic. Related classifications Although the 2-order can detect when an integer is congruent to 0 (mod 4) or 2 (mod 4), it cannot tell the difference between 1 (mod 4) or 3 (mod 4). This distinction has some interesting consequences, such as Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares.

Nelson (born January 23, 1971) is an American singer and songwriter. His mother was the late American singer Phyllis Nelson, best known for the songs \\"I Like You\\" and \\"Move Closer\\". He was an original member of Boyz II Men while still attending Philadelphia's High School of Performing Arts. However, Nelson left the group to pursue a solo career before they released their first album. CareerBoyz II Men= Nelson attended the Philadelphia High School for Creative and Performing Arts, in Pennsylvania. There, he and his friend Nathan Morris, joined later by Wanya Morris, Shawn Stockman, and Michael McCary, formed the singing group Unique Attraction. After hearing New Edition's song \\"Boys to Men\\" on the radio one evening, the group changed their name to Boyz II Men. In 1989, the group met Michael Bivins and began making arrangements to sign the group to a major label and begin recording. In the interim, the group encountered delays in recording their album. Nelson grew impatient and left the group and began recording his debut solo project. =Solo= After signing a solo deal with Capitol Records, Nelson scored a hit with a cover of Marvin Gaye's \\"I Want You\\", which hit #26 on the R&B; charts. His follow-up, \\"Count On Me\\", reached #48 on the R&B; charts. Nelson released his solo album, I Want You, in 1991. Following the release of his solo album, Nelson began concentrating his talents as a songwriter. Drawing the attention of Babyface, Nelson wrote for artists like Toni Braxton, Brandy, Tamia, Tyrese, and Jon B. Through Babyface, Nelson met the four members of the group Az Yet and was added to the line-up as second lead vocalist; the group was signed to LaFace Records. =Az Yet= As a member of Az Yet, Nelson found success. The group's self-titled debut album, released in 1996, went platinum. A single on the album, \\"Last Night\\", went gold and reached #9 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Their second single, \\"Hard To Say I'm Sorry\\" did even better, going platinum and reaching #8 on the Hot 100. =Chocolate Mood= Nelson left Az Yet and began writing intensely. Subsequently, he released his second solo second album, Chocolate Mood, in 1999. The album featured Nelson's biggest solo hit, \\"15 Minutes\\", which reached #4 on the R&B; charts and #27 on the Billboard Hot 100. He also featured on the duet \\"After All is Said and Done\\" with Beyoncé, on the soundtrack to the motion picture The Best Man (1999). On January 9, 2007, SESAC honored Nelson at their third Jazz Awards Luncheon, for his authorship on \\"It's On Tonight\\" by Brian Culbertson. The event honored jazz writers whose works achieved Top 5 status on the jazz charts from January 1, 2006 through December 31, 2006. =Marc: My Words= Nelson released his first independent project, Marc: My Words (Lyric Masters 911) on July 24, 2007. Nelson wrote or co-wrote the lyrics on all 15 tracks of the album. He also produced or co-produced all of the tracks on the album. Nelson extracted the material for the release from his existing catalog of songs written between 2001 and 2007, and began recording the material in 2006. The album features the original version of \\"I Don't Wanna Be In Love\\" (co- written by jazz artist Brian Culbertson) which also appears on the 2007 release Crystal City by Andre Ward. =Blayse= Nelson was also a founding member of the R&B; super-group Blayse, with fellow R&B; veterans Tony Grant of Az Yet, Gary \\"Lil G\\" Jenkins of Silk, and Terrell Phillips of Blackstreet. Although the group managed to record several songs, the recordings were never publicly released, the album was never completed, and the group disbanded in December 2007. Lil G returned to Silk, Nelson returned to Az Yet, and Tony Grant toured in the Tyler Perry stage production The Marriage Counselor, from January 2008 through May 2008. =Solo= On July 24, 2017, Nelson returned with a new R&B;/Soul single entitled \\"Wishing You The Worst\\". The 2017 song was released independently under his newly founded production company, Focused Artist Entertainment. Nelson was nominated for an Emmy Award for penning the theme song to the 2016 animated Christmas television film \\"Snowy Day\\". The song he penned was performed by Boyz II Men and was also the title song. Nelson acted in a number of stage plays and film productions dating back to 2007.

(stylized as HELLA) is an internationally operating German automotive part supplier with headquarters in Lippstadt, North Rhine- Westphalia. The company develops and manufactures lighting and electronic components and systems for the automotive industry, and also has one of the largest trade organizations for automotive parts, accessories, diagnosis and services within Europe. Hella is one of the top 50 global automotive suppliers and belongs to the 100 largest industrial companies in Germany. Worldwide, about 40,000 people are employed in more than 100 locations in over 35 countries. More than 5,800 engineers and technicians work in research and development within the company. History Sally Windmüller founded the company in 1899 under the name Westfälische Metall-Industrie Aktien- Gesellschaft (WMI) to produce ball horns and candles and kerosene lamps for carriages. Hella's name first appeared in 1908 as a trademark for acetylene headlights. In 1923, the manufacturing family Lüdenscheider Hueck took over the majority of the shares. The name “Hella” was included in the company name in 1986. The most likely explanation for the Hella brand is attributed to Sally Windmüller: He wanted to honour his wife Helen, in short Hella, and also wanted to use the playful association between this name and the German word hell (bright). After World War II the company started to expand, so that in 1951 the first subsidiary company was founded in Wembach. Today Hella has six different production manufactures in Germany, which are located in Lippstadt, Bremen, Recklinghausen, Hamm (Bockum-Hövel), Nellingen and Wembach. Early internationalization and the creation of a global distribution network in the 1960s resulted in the company developing one of the largest distribution networks in the industry, including its own subsidiaries and partners in numerous markets worldwide. In 1961, for example, the first foreign production plant was founded in Mentone, Australia. Today Hella has more than 100 places of location in over 35 countries and is operating in the economic region of Europe, NAFTA/South America, Africa and Asia/Pacific. Since the early 1990s Hella is also part of several Joint Ventures with other automotive part suppliers. Those Joint Ventures help developing other fields of competence. At the moment Hella cooperates with several different companies, such as Mahle Behr, Plastic Omnium, Samlip, Leoni, Mando, TMD Friction and InnoSenT. Joint Ventures are, for example, HBPO and BHTC in Lippstadt. Furthermore, the holding \\"HELLA Stanley Ltd Pty\\" with Stanley Electric was founded in 2002, which is located in Melbourne. In 2008, Hella started a joint venture between Hella and Gutmann Messtechnik, diagnostic specialists, to devote more attention to this area. Also in 2008, it was announced that the company would pay more attention in the future to issues and items that are outside of the traditional automotive domain. That same year, Hella sold Danish subsidiary Holger Christiansen A/S to the automotive supplier Bosch. Because of strong economical fluctuations Hella recorded a loss in the fiscal year 2005/06. The management decided for a program to lower the costs and increase efficiency, so that in the following fiscal year 2006/07 an operational gain could be recorded. In the fiscal year 2007/08 this operational gain increased again. Furthermore, Hella recorded the second highest consolidated sale of 4,4 billion Euro. In the following fiscal years a constant growth was recorded, which reached 5,3 billion Euro in 2013/14. Since 2017, Hella has spun off brighter AI and Yptokey from their own incubator.

In the lighting division, Hella develops and manufactures headlamps, refulgence and interior lighting. Recent innovations include headlights that adapt to the prevailing driving and weather situation. Headlamps with LEDs as light sources for low beam and high beam are already produced in series. An example would be the beams in the Cadillac Escalade Platinum. As daytime running lights, they are in many middle and upper class vehicles often been voted as standard. Camera-based driver-assistance systems provide the next level of innovation. They create new opportunities for optimum light distribution, depending on the traffic situation. For this reason, the company took over AGLAIA, the Berlin- based specialist for visual sensor systems, in 2006. Systems to increase efficiency and safety and comfort systems dominate the electronic product portfolio. These include Data-enabled electronic control units and roof modules as complex light-electronic modules, as well as Vehicle access and driving authorization. Modules for power management to optimise the energy balance of the electrical system and improve the battery charge balance. Innovation and growth area are electronic driver assistance systems. With infrared (lidar), 24-GHz radar and camera and ultrasonic sensors, Hella offers here a powerful technology portfolio and the corresponding series experience. Another important business segment are electronic components such as position sensors, actuators, vacuum pumps and wash water systems. Hella is one of the world's largest companies selling automotive parts and accessories with its own sales companies and partners in more than 100 countries. Thus Hella supplies the automotive aftermarket and garages with comprehensive and continually growing parts ranges in the core areas of lighting, electrical, electronics and thermal management. In addition, the aftermarket and garages are provided with effective sales support and expert technical service. In 2005, the joint venture Behr Hella Service was established for the collective processing of the global independent aftermarket for vehicle air conditioning and engine cooling. Through strategic partnerships with companies such as Behr and Plastic Omnium, Hella is well established in other areas, such as front- ends (joint venture HBPO GmbH, Lippstadt), and climate control systems and engine cooling (joint venture BHTC GmbH, Stuttgart). In addition to car accessories designed for civilian cars, Hella also manufactures special signaling for official emergency vehicles. These include flash beacons and beacons (in blue and yellow), Visual Warning Systems (OWS) and all-round sound combinations (RTK). These are compact roof structures that combine the two blue lights, sirens, and possibly several additional issues. Police, emergency services, fire departments, agencies for technical aid and numerous other operators of deployment and use special vehicles use them. Also part of the product range of authorities, are headlights on the bumper and some other products (e.g., covert special signal for civilian emergency vehicles). The New Zealand subsidiary, Hella New Zealand Limited, provides the Hella marine lights program for marine use. These include not only the mast and interior lighting with LED technology and lighting systems for boat trailers. In the 'Industries' segment Hella transfers existing technologies from the automotive sector to new target groups. As a first pilot project some cities in China have been provided with these new street lights. Another project is the LED- airport beacons, which can be found at the airports of Luxembourg, Paderborn/Lippstadt and Stavanger. Despite, new components for LED-interior lighting are being offered. In 2012 Hella started a cooperation with the Chinese automobile manufacturer BAIC to develop and produce light systems, particularly designed for the Chinese market. In 2017 Hella partnered with Air-Quality Data Company BreezoMeter  See also  * Charging station * Inductive charging * Electric vehicle ReferencesExternal links * * HELLA Developing New Charging Systems For Electric Vehicles * HELLA Innovation Ltd Category:Manufacturing companies of Germany Category:Auto parts suppliers of Germany Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1899 Category:Companies based in North Rhine-Westphalia Category:Electric vehicle industry Category:German brands Category:1899 establishments in Germany ","title":"Hella (company)"},{"id":"2481476","text":"Rice husk Rice hulls (or rice husks) are the hard protecting coverings of grains of rice. In addition to protecting rice during the growing season, rice hulls can be put to use as building material, fertilizer, insulation material, or fuel. Rice hulls are part of the chaff of the rice. Production Rice hulls are the coatings of seeds, or grains, of rice. The husk protects the seed during the growing season and is formed from hard materials, including opaline silica and lignin. The hull is hard to eat or swallow and mostly indigestible to humans because of its enriched fibre components. However, during times of food scarcity in ancient China, a common daily meal was a pastry made from rice husks, wild vegetables, and soybean powder. This led to the idiom \\"meals of cereal, hulls, and vegetables for half a year,\\" indicating poverty and food insecurity. Winnowing, used to separate the rice from hulls, is to put the whole rice into a pan and throw it into the air while the wind blows. The light hulls are blown away while the heavy rice fall back into the pan. Later pestles and a simple machine called a rice pounder were developed to remove hulls. In 1885 the modern rice hulling machine was invented in Brazil. During the milling processes, the hulls are removed from the raw grain to reveal whole brown rice, which is then usually milled further to remove the bran layer, resulting in white rice. Uses The temples of the Batujaya Archaeological Site in Indonesia (5th century AD) were built with bricks containing rice hulls. =Ash= Combustion of rice hulls affords 'rice husk ash' (acronym RHA). This ash is a potential source of amorphous reactive silica, which has a variety of applications in materials science. Most of the ash is used in the production of Portland cement.Otto W. Flörke, et al. \\"Silica\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2008, Weinheim: Wiley-VCH, . . When burnt completely, the ash can have a Blaine number of as much as 3,600 compared to the Blaine number of cement (between 2,800 and 3,000), meaning it is finer than cement. Silica is the basic component of sand, which is used with cement for plastering and concreting. This fine silica will provide a very compact concrete. The ash also is a very good thermal insulation material. The fineness of the ash also makes it a very good candidate for sealing fine cracks in civil structures, where it can penetrate deeper than the conventional cement sand mixture. Rice husk ash has long been used in ceramic glazes in rice growing regions in the Far East, e.g. China and Japan. Being about 95% silica, it is an easy way of introducing the necessary silica into the glaze, and the small particle size helps with an early melt of the glaze. A number of possible uses for RHA include absorbents for oils and chemicals, soil ameliorants, a source of silicon, insulation powder in steel mills, as repellents in the form of \\"vinegar-tar\\" release agent in the ceramics industry, as an insulation material. More specialized applications include the use of this material as a catalyst support.J. Chumee et al. \\"Characterization of platinum–iron catalysts supported on MCM-41 synthesized with rice husk silica and their performance for phenol hydroxylation\\" Sci. Technol. Adv. Mater. 9 (2008) 015006 free download Goodyear announced plans to use rice husk ash as a source for tire additive. Rice hulls are a low-cost material from which silicon carbide \\"whiskers\\" can be manufactured. The SiC whiskers are then used to reinforce ceramic cutting tools, increasing their strength tenfold. =Toothpaste= In Kerala, India, charcoal from Rice husks (Umikari in Malayalam) were universally used for over centuries in cleaning teeth, before toothpaste replaced it. =Brewing= Rice hulls can be used in brewing beer to increase the lautering ability of a mash. Rice husk is also used in one step of traditional preparation processes of Kaoliang (Sorghum) liquid. After fermentation, rice husk can be added into the wine tank to increase the void, which is advantageous for distillation. = Fertilizer and substrate = Rice hulls can be composted, but their high lignin content can make this a slow process. Sometimes earthworms are used to accelerate the process. Using vermicomposting techniques, hulls can be converted to fertilizer in about four months. Rice hulls that are parboiled (PBH) are used as a substrate or medium for gardening, including certain hydrocultures. The hulls decay over time. Rice hulls allow drainage, and retain less water than growstones. It has been shown that rice hulls do not affect plant growth regulation. =Fireworks= Rice hulls are coated with fine-grained gunpowder and used as the main bursting charge in aerial fireworks shells. =Fuel= Rice hulls can be pressed into logs for use in cooking fires instead of wood With proper techniques, rice hulls can be burned and used to power steam engines. Some rice mills originally disposed of hulls in this way. Unfortunately the direct combustion of rice hulls produces large quantities of smoke. An alternative is gasification. Rice hulls are easily gasified in top- lit updraft gasifiers. The combustion of this rice hull gas produces a blue flame, and rice hull biochar makes a good soil amendment. =Juice extraction= Rice hulls are used as a \\"press aid\\" to improve extraction efficiency of apple pressing.Press aids =Pet food fiber= Rice hulls are an inexpensive byproduct of human food processing, serving as a source of fiber that is considered a filler ingredient in pet foods. =Pillow stuffing= Rice hulls are used as pillow stuffing. The pillows are loosely stuffed and considered therapeutic as they retain the shape of the head. =Insulating material= Rice hulls themselves are a class A thermal insulating material because they are difficult to burn and less likely to allow moisture to propagate mold or fungi. It is also used as roofing after mixing it with mud and water. =Particle boards and cardboard= Rice hulls are also used to make particle boards and cardboard. The silica in rice husk make the particle boards less attractive to termites. =Geopolymers= Due to high amorphous silica content, the RHA (rice husk ash) can be used as a precursor material for geopolymer concrete.

The focus of the ride is on agriculture, especially new technology to make agriculture more efficient, sustainable, and environmentally friendly.  Ride experience  The prairie diorama within the Living with the Land attraction The dark-ride portion of the attraction opens with a scene of a deciduous forest in the middle of a thunderstorm, illustrating how the forces that shape the land can appear destructive to us. The boat then sails through artificial biomes representing a tropical rainforest, a desert and the American prairie. Some of the Audio-Animatronic figures in this section were originally created for the never-built Magic Kingdom attraction, Western River Expedition. The biomes feature sound and lighting effects, in addition to heat, wind and mist, to simulate real conditions. The boats float through a small theater that illustrates the relationship between humans and the environment, and the ways that we have been modifying the land to better serve our purposes. The second part of the attraction takes place in The Land's \\"Living Laboratory\\", which showcases ideas about the future of agriculture. All of the plants in this section are grown through various methods of hydroponics. Plants are grown in sand, perlite, coconut coir and rockwool. There are five distinct areas of the \\"living laboratory\\", which are: *Tropics Greenhouse - This greenhouse features crops from the tropical areas of the world, including both familiar and exotic foods. Plants on display include banana, cacao, jackfruit, date palm, dragonfruit, vanilla, cleome, pineapple, java apple and papaya. *Aquacell - This section focuses on aquaculture, or \\"fish farming.\\" It includes several high-density tanks and a few low-density display tanks and tubes. Animals on display include tilapia, sturgeon, paddlefish, catfish, bass, American alligator, and shrimp. Some of the fish harvested from the Aquacell are served in the Coral Reef Restaurant in The Seas with Nemo and Friends pavilion. *Temperate Greenhouse (formerly the Desert Greenhouse) - A greenhouse featuring crops from temperate climates. Currently, the Temperate house showcases large-sized crops, such as Prizewinner and Atlantic Giant pumpkins, winter melon, pomelo, and \\"Nine-pound Lemon.\\" Other crops include sunflower, beets, turnip, cotton, millet and cassabanana. A Mickey Mouse shaped pumpkin *String Greenhouse (formerly the Production Greenhouse) - This greenhouse focuses on innovative high-density techniques, such as Nutrient film technique. It also shows off \\"vertical growing techniques\\", in which plants are grown on specialized trellises which cause the herbaceous plants to approximate the shape and structure of trees. One of the most famous examples of these trees is The Land's \\"tomato tree\\", which produced over 32,000 tomatoes in a 16-month period. It was recognized by Guinness World Records as both the largest and most productive tomato plant in the world. Other crops include eggplant, peppers, winged bean, lettuce and snake gourd. Furthermore, cucumbers and pumpkins are grown in the shape of Mickey Mouse through the use of special molds. Much of the produce grown in the String Greenhouse is used in The Garden Grill and Sunshine Seasons, both restaurants in The Land pavilion. In total, over 30 tons of produce are harvested from The Land each year. *Creative Greenhouse - The final greenhouse in the attraction shows some unusual ideas about the future of agriculture. Most of the plants in Creative House are grown via Aeroponics, in which a fine mist of water and nutrients is sprayed directly onto the roots of the plants. The roots dangle freely in the air, and are not hindered by any growing medium. Some of the plants' roots in Creative House are enclosed within rotating columns and A-frame structures, while others are completely exposed to the open air, at least temporarily, so the entire plant may be viewed by the Guests on the boat ride. Creative House also features a small exhibit of NASA hydroponic growing units, which were developed for use on extended-length space journeys. Crops on display include tomato, squash, lettuce, basil, rosemary, cabbage, super-dwarf wheat, swiss chard, marigold and snapdragon. Additionally, the Living Laboratory contains: The US Department of Agriculture Research lab within Living with the Land *Biotechnology Lab - Attached to the Creative Greenhouse, the Biotechnology Lab is a sterile research environment. Several USDA scientists are on-site at The Land, performing research on crop improvement. The Land also produces a product called \\"Mickey's Mini Gardens\\" in the Biotechnology Lab, which are available for purchase in several locations in Epcot. *Integrated Pest Management Lab - An Entomology laboratory that raises beneficial insects for use in The Land and all over Walt Disney World property. It is not visible on the Living with the Land boat ride, but is visited during the Behind the Seeds backstage tour. Insects raised here include tiny, stingless parasitoid wasps and ladybugs. The ride concludes with a lighted collage of people and produce from all over the world, along with a projection of Earth as seen from space. Listen to the Land Living with the Land is an updated version of a previous attraction, Listen to the Land. Very little was changed between the two versions of the attraction. The opening scene, the \\"Symphony of the Seed\\", which provided a stylized look at the growth of a plant, was replaced by the opening storm scene. Also, the Biotechnology lab was relocated from the exit tunnel to the Creative Greenhouse. The Integrated Pest Management Lab is now housed in the space formerly occupied by the Biotechnology Lab. The ride has been updated to use an automated guide, not a cast-member. Also, the theme song \\"Listen to the Land\\" is no longer used in the attraction, though an instrumental version can still be heard in The Land's exterior background music loop as well the music loop played inside the Garden Grill. They are currently using portions of various other pieces, including \\"Rain Forest Rhapsody\\" and \\"Dawn of a New Day\\".

She was also part of the Socialist Patients' Collective (SPK).J. Smith, André Moncourt, Bill Dunne, \\"The Red Army Faction: a documentary history\\", Kersplebedeb, 2009, p. 171 From 1971 until 1982 she was active within the RAF. Early life Mohnhaupt was born in Rheinberg, North Rhine-Westphalia, the daughter of an employee in a publishing house. After her parents' divorce in 1960 she stayed with her mother. She took her abitur in 1967 in Bruchsal, and later that year enrolled with the philosophy department at the University of Munich. She was married to Rolf Heissler from 1968–1970. While in Munich, she joined the local commune scene, where she met core figures of the 1960s student movement such as Rainer Langhans, Fritz Teufel and Uschi Obermaier. In 1969, she participated in a demonstration in the USA cultural centre in Munich (Amerikahaus) to protest against the Vietnam War. She was reportedly influenced by Carlos Marighella's Manual of the Urban Guerilla. Activities as a member of the RAF Mohnhaupt was first a member of the Socialist Patients' Collective, known by its German acronym, SPK. Together with fellow commune member Irmgard Möller, she joined the Red Army Faction (RAF) around 1971 after the SPK dissolved, and helped with organization, logistics, and weapon procurement. Below is a timeline of Mohnhaupt's major acts as a member of the RAF. *9 June 1972: Mohnhaupt was arrested in Berlin in connection with the RAF and sentenced to prison for involvement with a criminal organization, identity document forgery, and illegal weapon possession. *Shortly after Ulrike Meinhof's death in prison in 1976, Mohnhaupt was, on her own request, transferred to Stammheim Prison where the majority of other RAF prisoners were held captive. In Stammheim Prison she met Gudrun Ensslin, Andreas Baader, and Jan-Carl Raspe, and was reportedly trained by them to become a leader of the RAF. * She was released on 8 February 1977, and immediately went underground and continued her work with the RAF. *Mohnhaupt was a major player in the German Autumn: she was involved in the 1977 assassinations of chief federal prosecutor Siegfried Buback in Karlsruhe and banker Jürgen Ponto, chairman of the Dresdner Bank board of directors, in Oberursel, Taunus. She was also involved in the kidnapping and murder of employer representative Hanns Martin Schleyer. *11 May 1978 Mohnhaupt, Sieglinde Hofmann, Rolf Clemens Wagner, and Peter-Jürgen Boock were arrested in Zagreb, Yugoslavia. *17 November 1978 – Mohnhaupt and three other RAF members were allowed to leave Yugoslavia for a country of their choice because West Germany turned down an offer from Yugoslavia to extradite them in exchange for eight Croatian political fugitives in West Germany. *15 September 1981 Mohnhaupt took part in an assassination attempt on U.S. General Frederick Kroesen using an RPG-7 anti-tank rocket. Arrest and imprisonment On 11 November 1982 Mohnhaupt, along with Adelheid Schulz, was caught entering an RAF arms cache in the woods near Frankfurt which had been staked out by GSG 9 men. Mohnhaupt was detained and sentenced to five terms of life in prison with a minimum 24-year mandatory sentence by the appellate court of Stuttgart. She was given this sentence because of the significant role she played during the German Autumn and for her part in the attempted assassination of NATO General Kroesen. The court considered her a leading figure of the RAF, but could not determine whether she had personally been involved in any of the murders. After her conviction, Mohnhaupt declared that the RAF would continue to fight. Her arrest was a massive blow to the RAF (as she had become almost as important to her RAF 'generation' as Gudrun Ensslin and Andreas Baader had been to theirs).Germany may grant parole to terrorists, UPI on The Washington Times website — URL accessed on January 19, 2007 On 12 February 2007 amidst widespread media controversy, the appellate court of Stuttgart gave Mohnhaupt parole effective of 27 March 2007. She routinely qualified for early release after serving her mandatory sentence. Parole was granted since she was no longer a danger to society according to a psychological expert and the Federal Attorney General. Unlike other RAF members, Mohnhaupt had never applied for clemency. She was released from Aichach prison on 25 March 2007. Political debate surrounding her release Many German politicians were in favour of clemency towards Brigitte Mohnhaupt and Christian Klar. Former Justice minister Klaus Kinkel (FDP) had pleaded in favour of a \\"second chance\\"; former president of the Bundestag Wolfgang Thierse (SPD) declared that \\"expiation\\" has taken place, and Green member Antje Vollmer stated that they \\"have been longer in prison than any Nazi criminal.\\" . The statement is partially incorrect: Rudolf Hess served over 40 years in prison in the post World War II Allied system, but he was not convicted by a German court and did not serve time in a German prison. Most of the Nazis judged after the war were amnestied in the mid-1950s. On the other hand, Konrad Freiberg, president of the police union, who had seen ten of his officers killed by the RAF, and Bavarian Interior Minister Günther Beckstein were more than reluctant to see her released. However, Gerhart Baum (FDP), Federal Interior Minister from 1978 to 1982, was in favor of Brigitte Mohnhaupt's release, as it showed that she was treated no worse nor better than any other prisoner, being released after having served all 24 years of her mandatory sentence. According to weekly Die Zeit, keeping her in prison would signify that the state was confirming the terrorists' view of themselves as political prisoners. On March 25, 2007 she was released from prison Une ancienne de la bande à Baader bientôt libérée, Le Figaro, February 13, 2007 ReferencesBibliography *Becker, Jillian.

In 1961, Nakayama was promoted to 8th dan—a remarkable progression, in part made possible by the consensus-based system of higher dan promotion in Japan at the time, according to Pat Zalewski. Nakayama established kata (patterns) and kumite (sparring) as tournament disciplines. Students of the large JKA dojo (training halls) subsequently achieved an unmatched series of tournament successes in the 1950s and 1960s. Nakayama is widely known for having worked to spread Shotokan karate throughout the world.Rosenthal, J.

Together with other senior instructors, he formed the JKA instructor trainee program. Many of this program's graduates were sent throughout the world to form new Shotokan subgroups and increase membership. Nakayama also held positions in the Physical Education department of Takushoku University, beginning in 1952, and eventually becoming head of that department. He also headed the ski team at the university. Later life In 1972, Nakayama, with some help from one of his students, Hirokazu Kanazawa, set up a personal dojo in the basement of his apartment building, naming it \\"Hoitsugan.\\"Hoitsugan: Dojo, Book, Way of Life Retrieved on February 13, 2010.Cheetham, J.

After Nakayama's death in 1987, the JKA divided into two factions, which subsequently led to a further splintering within the organization. Many senior JKA instructors left to form their own associations, which include the International Shotokan Karate Federation (Teruyuki Okazaki), Japan Karate Shotokai (Tetsuhiko Asai), Japan Shotokan Karate Association (Keigo Abe), Shotokan Karate International Federation (Hirokazu Kanazawa), Japan Karate Association / World Federation America (Shojiro Koyama) and America and Karatenomichi World Federation (Mikio Yahara).

The Spray was lost with Captain Slocum aboard sometime on or after November 14, 1909, after sailing from Vineyard Haven, Massachusetts, bound for South America. Joshua Slocum and His Travels Joshua Slocum Society International Inc. History In 1892, a friend, Captain Eben Pierce, offered Slocum a ship that \\"wants some repairs\\". Slocum went to Fairhaven, Massachusetts, to find that the \\"ship\\" was a rotting old oyster sloop named Spray, propped-up in a field. Despite the major overhaul of the ship, Slocum kept her name Spray, noting, \\"Now, it is a law in Lloyd's that the Jane repaired all out of the old until she is entirely new is still the Jane.\\"Slocum, 1900, p. 7 Its days as a fishing boat, probably as a Chesapeake Bay oysterman, had come to an end by 1885, and it was a derelict, a slowly deteriorating hulk sitting in a makeshift ship's-cradle in a seaside meadow on Poverty Point in Fairhaven, Massachusetts, when Captain Eben Pierce of that town offered it to Joshua Slocum as a gift. Slocum came to Fairhaven to look at the Spray (sorry sight that it was), and he undertook to repair and refit it over the next thirteen months. The materials used for the repairs cost $553.62, . After setting off round the world in 1895 the boom was shortened after it broke and in 1896 Slocum reduced the height of the mast by 7 feet and the length of bowsprit by 5 feet while in Buenos Aires. In Port Angosto, Strait of Magellan, the Spray was re-rigged as a yawl by adding a jigger. \\"I also mended the sloop's sails and rigging, and fitted a jigger, which changed the rig to a yawl [...]\\" In 1901 the Spray was an attraction at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York. Seaworthiness \\"Yachtsmen pleasuring in the 'lilies of the sea' will not think favourably of my craft,\\" warned Joshua Slocum, anticipating the criticism of those who juggle with coefficients. \\"They have a right to their opinion, while I stick to mine.\\"Captain Joshua Slocum. Sailing Alone Around the World, The Reprint Society, 1949. It is worth reading the Appendix of Sailing Alone Around the World for Slocum's candid explanation of the Spray design and its seaworthiness. An analysis by Howard I. Chapelle, curator of maritime history at the Smithsonian Institution and a noted expert on small sailing craft, demonstrated that the Spray was stable under most circumstances but could easily capsize if heeled beyond a relatively shallow angle. He felt that Slocum was merely lucky that his unstable vessel had not killed him earlier. One of the many theories for the boat's disappearance suggested that her internal ballast may have shifted in a severe knock-down and thus unbalanced her. Only exact replica Sprays today would retain internal ballast. Frenchman Guy Bernardin is attempting a circumnavigation in a Spray replica Spray of Briac. With no weighted keel, the boat carries 1.4 tonnes of iron ingots as ballast – jig-sawed into position in the bilge, just like Slocum’s Spray. Would they fall out if he rolled? \\"They might...\\" For stability analysis by author see Chapter 5. For stability analysis by Andrade see Appendix II. In his book Captain Joshua Slocum, Joshua's son Victor Slocum stated that \\"the ballast was concrete cement, stanchioned down securely to ensure it against shifting should the vessel be hove on her beam-ends. There was no outside ballast whatever. The Spray could have been self-righting if hove on her beam- ends, a fact that was proven, since, by an experiment on an exact duplicate of the original boat and ballasted just like her. The test boat was hove down with mast flat to the water and when released righted herself.\\"Victor Slocum. Captain Joshua Slocum - The Adventures of America's Best Known Sailor, Sheridan house, 1950 When commodore John Pflieger pointed out in 'Spray', the journal of The Slocum Society, that a long keel is harder to tack or go about in and that a boat similar to Spray foundered on a lee shore on this account, Peter Tangvald, competent ocean sailor who circumnavigated in his 32-foot cutter Dorothea I, promptly replied, \\"How much more should Slocum have done to demonstrate that the boat was seaworthy? I would not hesitate to claim that if one Spray was wrecked on a lee shore it was because her crew needed a few more hours of sailing lessons.\\"Charles A. Borden. Sea Quest - Global Blue-Water Adventuring in Small Craft, 1967. PP 111–114. Bound from Samoa to Australia, Slocum encountered gales and heavy seas that foundered the American clipper ship Patrician running a course south of Spray. A French mail steamer blown off course reported seeing Spray at the height of the storm and wondered what sad fate had befallen the little ship. Slocum's log records that, at the time that passengers of the steamer were up to their knees in water in the big ship's saloon, Spray was laying snug under a goose-winged mainsail. Joshua Slocum, a classic sailor and a forthright, honest man, not being concerned by the controversy over the seaworthiness capabilities, said simply, \\"I have given in the plans of the Spray the dimensions of such a ship as I should call seaworthy in all conditions of weather and on all seas.\\" He also stated: \\"I may some day see reason to modify the model of the dear old Spray, but out of my limited experience I strongly recommend her wholesome lines over those of pleasure-fliers for safety.\\" Self-steering ability One of the most remarkable things about Spray was her ability to run before the wind under her regular fore-and-aft rig with the helm lashed, and hold her course for hours or days on end. If Spray had not had this ability, Slocum's performance would have been a physical impossibility. On nearing the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Slocum noted \\"I didn't touch the helm, for with the current and heave of the sea the sloop found herself at the end of the run absolutely in the fairway of the channel. ... Then I trimmed her sails by the wind, took the helm, and flogged her up the couple of miles or so abreast the harbour landing, where I cast anchor at 3.30 pm, July 17, 1897, twenty-three days from Thursday Island. The distance run was twenty-seven hundred miles as the crow flies. ... During those twenty-three days I had not spent altogether more than three hours at the helm, including the time occupied in beating into Keeling harbour. I just lashed the helm and let her go; whether the wind was abeam or dead aft, it was all the same: she always stayed on her course.\\" Sailboat designer John G. Hanna said of Spray, \\"I hold that her peculiar merit as a single-hander was in her remarkable balance of all effective centres of effort and resistance on her midship section line.\\" Hanna nevertheless felt it necessary to warn prospective circumnavigators looking for a suitable vessel that \\"Spray is the worst possible boat for anyone lacking the experience and resourcefulness of Slocum to take offshore.\\" Cipriano Andrade, Jr., engineer and yacht designer, said of Spray: “After a thorough analysis of Spray's lines, I found her to have a theoretically perfect balance. Her balance is marvelous — almost uncanny. Try as I would — one element after another — they all swung into the same identical line. I attacked her with proportional dividers, planimeter, rotameter, Simpson's rule, Froude's coefficients, Dixon Kemp's formulae, series, curves, differentials, and all the appliances of modern yacht designing, and she emerged from the ordeal a theoretically perfect boat. For when she is underway every element of resistance, stability, weight, heeling effort, and propulsive force is in one transverse plane, and that plane is the boat's midship section. I know of no similar case in the whole field of naval architecture, ancient or modern.” Slocum himself said \\"I did not know the center of effort in her sails, except as it hit me in practice at sea, nor did I care a rope yarn about it. Mathematical calculations, however, are all right in a good boat, and Spray could have stood them. She was easily balanced and easily kept in trim.\\" Replicas There are several replicas of the Spray.

The Wasp grew out of the 1975 WAAM (Wide-Area Anti-Armour Munitions) program initiated by the US Air Force in order to develop a series of new air-to-ground anti-armour weapons for close-support aircraft. The three-pronged program led to the CBU-92/B ERAM (Extended Range Anti-Armour Munition), the CBU-90/B ACM (Anti- Armour Cluster Munition), and the Wasp anti-armour missile. The Wasp is regarded as the most advanced of these weapons. Development began in 1979, with Boeing and Hughes Aircraft as the primary contractors. The specification called for a small missile which could be carried in large numbers by attack aircraft in multiple dispensers - the A-10 was able to carry several 12 round launcher pods. The Boeing design was unsuccessful, and the USAF selected the Hughes Wasp missile. The AGM-124A was a small weapon with folding wings and fins to reduce storage space within the launcher. It was intended to be launched in large numbers - 10 or more missiles launched nearly simultaneously was envisaged for a typical attack; the name Wasp derived from this \\"swarm\\" tactic. The missiles would follow a pre-programmed path to the target area before activating a millimeter wave active radar homing to identify and home on a specific target. This high resolution radar was able to distinguish targets even against enemy jamming and high background clutter from the ground. Testing of the radar system began in 1981, and the first prototype AGM-124 took place in 1983. Production was planned for 1987, but in October 1983 the program was cancelled. Most of the other components of the WAAM program were also less than successful, with only the BLU-108/B Skeet submunition in use today.

On successful completion of coursework and thesis, students are awarded the relevant degrees. Since 1990, the Centre also offers short-term Summer Research Fellowship programme, Project Oriented Chemical Education, and Project Oriented Biological Education programmes to students at the undergraduate levels. Research The Centre’s primary objective is research and development, with emphasis on high quality as well as interdisciplinary research. Research at the CentreResearch units at JNCASR is divided into following nine units: Chemistry and Physics of Materials Unit (CPMU) - CPMU was the first research unit established at JNCASR with an aim to carry out research in materials science using an interdisciplinary approach. Based on an international review in December 2017, wherein the contribution of CPMU was highly appreciated, the School of Advanced Materials Science (SAMat) was set up for enhancing the visibility of CPMU at the international level. Evolutionary and Integrative Biology Unit (EIBU) - Researchers at EIBU aim to address conceptually fundamental questions in biology, with a strong emphasis on evolutionary biology. The Unit’s faculty are among the top ecologists and geneticists in India and have been addressing fundamental questions in areas of ecology, evolution, and behaviour as well as assessing genetic diversity in wild populations in India. Engineering Mechanics Unit (EMU) - The EMU is focused on fundamental as well as application-based research in various topics related to transport processes in simple and complex fluids over a range of length and time scales. Geodynamics Unit (GDU) – Research at GDU is focused on characterizing the main thrust belts in central and western Himalaya to gauge their role in Himalayan seismicity. Additionally, researchers also investigate tsunami hazard areas of the Indian Coasts and climate evolution in the Himalayan region. International Centre of Materials Sciences (ICMS) – ICMS was established on December 3, 2011 and inaugurated by the then Prime Minister of India, Dr. Manmohan Singh. ICMS is financially supported by the DST, and directed by Prof. C.N.R. Rao. ICMS is a member of several international forums like EICOON, WMRIF, and IUSSTF. Molecular Biology and Genetics Unit (MBGU) – Researchers at MBGU investigate various concepts in biology, including those related to health and medicine. It has immensely contributed to the ranking of JNCASR as fourth in the Life Science category in the Nature index normalized ranking. New Chemistry Unit (NCU) - The NCU was established in 2010 as part of the 11th Five Year Plan. The Unit works on interdisciplinary aspects of chemical science, with emphasis on research areas at the interface of Chemical Biology, Chemical Science, and Materials Science. Neuroscience Unit (NSU) - Research at NSU focuses on clinically-relevant neurological phenotypes as well as normal neurobiological traits using model organisms such as Drosophila, mice, and human patients. Theoretical Sciences Unit (TSU) – Research at TSU uses an interdisciplinary approach to problems in very diverse areas such as evolutionary biology and materials science, with an aim to predict and identify new phenomena and circumstances that modify observed patterns in nature. Specifically, the research aims to search and identify universality and pattern formation, and explore any deviation from an observed pattern. In addition to the above, Thematic Unit of Excellence in Computational Materials Science (TUE-CMS) was established in April 2006 and is supported by DST, through its Nano Science and Technology Initiative. This research Unit aims to explore materials sciences, glass, and other computation-intensive research areas using numerical simulations. The Centre has taken initiatives to create, develop, protect, and manage commercially exploitable intellectual property assets created by its researchers. As of 2020, the Centre has filed 296 National Phase and International Phase Patent Applications under Patent Cooperation Treaty and obtained 94 patent grants. Through its Technical Research Center (TRC), JNCASR facilitates the commercialization of ‘high risk– high potential’ technologies for global markets. TRC was established in 2016 with support from DST, and is a multifaceted platform that provides technical, legal-commercial and financial support to scientists, entrepreneurs, and the business fraternity to achieve translation of research into products. As of 2020, TRC has supported more than 30 R&D; projects, including patenting, setting up collaborations with industrial partners, and initiating start-up companies. Outreach According to one of its primary objectives, the Centre actively carries out outreach events and fellowship programmes to improve scientific awareness among the public and facilitate excellent science education at the school and college levels in the country.

Noted for his pace and his accuracy, Brett was a leading wicket-taker in the 1770s and was lauded by John Nyren in The Cricketers of my Time. Writing half a century later, Nyren described Brett as \\"beyond all comparison, the fastest as well as straitest bowler that ever was known\\".Nyren, p. 56. Career Brett was born at Catherington in Hampshire. An unusual feature of his career at a time when players freely swapped sides as \\"given men\\" was that he always played for Hampshire. As he lived at Catherington, he was ineligible to represent Hambledon's Parish XI and so played only for the county team. Brett featured in the Monster Bat Incident 1771 as the bowler who led the protest and it is almost certain that he wrote out the formal objection to Thomas White's huge bat. This document, which has been preserved, was countersigned by his captain Richard Nyren and Hampshire's senior batsman John Small. The protest resulted in the maximum width of the bat being set at four and one quarter inches in the Laws of Cricket. Brett is known to have made 38 appearances for Hampshire from 1769 to 1778.Haygarth, pp. 3–39. He is first recorded in the match against Caterham at Guildford Bason on Monday, 31 July 1769.Waghorn, Dawn of Cricket, p. 32.Wilson, pp. 51–52. His known career wicket tally was over 100, but the bowling details in every game are either unknown or incomplete. It is known, for example, that he took 29 wickets (all bowled) in just five matches in the 1777 season but, with catches, the true figure for wickets taken is almost certainly higher.. Brett's last recorded match was for Hampshire against Surrey at Laleham Burway in October 1778 when he was still only 31. It seems he went to live in Portsmouth so a change of occupation may have been the reason for his apparently early retirement.Haygarth, p. 39. He died at Kingston Cross, Portsmouth.

History  Newry's town hall was designed by William Batt. It was built on a three-arched bridge over the Clanrye River in 1893 by the old Newry Town Commissioners. The Clanrye River, which runs through the heart of Newry, forms the border in Newry between County Armagh and County Down, hence the Town Hall was built over it to meet the needs of the people from both sides of the growing town.

Nineteenth-century writers on psychology such as William James used the words \\"suggest\\" and \\"suggestion\\" in the context of a particular idea which was said to suggest another when it brought that other idea to mind. Early scientific studies of hypnosis by Clark Leonard Hull and others extended the meaning of these words in a special and technical sense (Hull, 1933). The original neuropsychological theory of hypnotic suggestion was based upon the ideomotor reflex response that William B. Carpenter declared, in 1852,Carpenter, W.B., \\"On the Influence of Suggestion in Modifying and directing Muscular Movement, independently of Volition\\", Royal Institution of Great Britain, (Proceedings), 1852, (12 March 1852), pp. 147–153. was the principle through which James Braid's hypnotic phenomena were produced.  Émile Coué  Émile Coué (1857–1926) was a significant pioneer in the development of an understanding of the application of therapeutic suggestion;See Yeates, 2016a, 2016b, and 2016c. and, according to Cheek and LeCron, most of our current knowledge of suggestion \\"stems from Coué\\" (1968, p.60). With the intention of \\"saturating the cognitive microenvironment of the mind\\", Coué's therapeutic method approach was based on four non-controversial principles: :(1) suggestion can produce somatic phenomena; :(2) specific suggestions generate specific somatic outcomes; :(3) suggestions are just as efficacious in the treatment of physical or organic conditions as they are for functional or emotional conditions; and :(4) a successful suggestion-based intervention for a physical condition does not indicate that the original complaint was in any way imaginary.Yeates (2016b), p.48. HypnosisTrance and suggestion= Modern scientific study of hypnosis, which follows the pattern of Hull's work, separates two essential factors: \\"trance\\" and suggestion.Heap, M. (1996). \\"The nature of hypnosis.\\" The Psychologist. 9 (11): 498–501. The state of mind induced by \\"trance\\" is said to come about via the process of a hypnotic induction—essentially instructing and suggesting to the subject that they will enter a hypnotic state. Once a subject enters hypnosis, the hypnotist gives suggestions that can produce sought effects. Commonly used suggestions on measures of \\"suggestibility\\" or \\"susceptibility\\" (or for those with a different theoretical orientation, \\"hypnotic talent\\") include suggestions that one's arm is getting lighter and floating up in the air, or that a fly is buzzing around one's head. The \\"classic\\" response to an accepted suggestion that one's arm is beginning to float in the air is that the subject perceives the intended effect as happening involuntarily.Wetizenhoffer, A. M. (1980). \\"Hypnotic susceptibility revisited.\\" American Journal of Clinical Hypnosis. (3):130-46. =Scientific hypnotism= Consistent with the views of Pierre Janet—who noted (1920, pp.284–285) that the critical feature is not the making of a 'suggestion', but, instead, is the taking of the 'suggestion'—Weitzenhoffer (2000, passim), argued that scientific hypnotism centres on the delivery of \\"suggestions\\" to hypnotized subjects; and, according to Yeates (2016b, p.35), these suggestions are delivered with the intention of eliciting: :(1) the further stimulation of partially active mental states and/or physiological processes; :(2) the awakening of dormant mental states and/or physiological processes; :(3) the activation of latent mental states and/or physiological processes; :(4) alterations in existing perceptions, thoughts, feelings, and/or behaviours; and/or :(5) entirely new perceptions, thoughts, feelings, and/or behaviours. =Temporal dimensions= Furthermore, according to Yeates (2016b, pp.35–36), 'suggestions' have four temporal dimensions: :(1) pre- hypnotic suggestions, delivered prior to the formal induction; :(2) suggestions for within-hypnotic influence, to elicit specific within-session outcomes; :(3) suggestions for post-hypnotic influence, to elicit specific post-session outcomes: ::(i) immediate influence (\\"and, on leaving here today, you'll…\\"); ::(ii) shorter-term influence (\\"and, each time you're…\\"); ::(iii) longer-term influence (\\"and, as time passes, you'll increasingly…\\"); or ::(iv) specific-moment influence (Bernheim's suggestions à longue échéance, 'suggestions to be realised after a long interval'), which are (i) intended \\"to produce a particular effect at a designated later hour\\", (ii) have \\"no influence before the appointed hour\\", (iii) nor \\"after it had expired\\" (Barrows, 1896, pp.22–23), or :(4) post-hypnotic suggestions, delivered to dehypnotised-but-not-yet-completely-reoriented subjects.Yeates notes (p.36) that \\"there is a strong tradition that these suggestions are the most efficacious\\". Waking suggestion Suggestions, however, can also have an effect in the absence of a hypnosis. These so-called \\"waking suggestions\\" are given in precisely the same way as \\"hypnotic suggestions\\" (i.e., suggestions given within hypnosis) and can produce strong changes in perceptual experience. Experiments on suggestion, in the absence of hypnosis, were conducted by early researchers such as Hull (1933).Hull, C. L. (1933/2002). \\"Hypnosis and suggestibility: an experimental approach.\\" Crown House Publishing. More recently, researchers such as Nicholas Spanos and Irving Kirsch have conducted experiments investigating such non-hypnotic- suggestibility and found a strong correlation between people's responses to suggestion both in- and outside hypnosis.Kirsch, I., Braffman, W. (2001). \\"Imaginative suggestibility and hypnotizability.\\" Current Directions in Psychological Science. 4 (2): 57–61. Other forms In addition to the kinds of suggestion typically delivered by researchers interested in hypnosis there are other forms of suggestibility, though not all are considered interrelated. These include: primary and secondary suggestibility (older terms for non- hypnotic and hypnotic suggestibility respectively), hypnotic suggestibility (i.e., the response to suggestion measured within hypnosis), and interrogative suggestibility (yielding to interrogative questions, and shifting responses when interrogative pressure is applied: see Gudjonsson suggestibility scale. Metaphors and imagery can also be used to deliver suggestion.

He is noted amongst guitarists for his prolific use of hybrid picking at high speeds. Early life Firkins was born in 1967, in Omaha, Nebraska, to musician parents; his father was a lap steel guitarist and his mother a pianist. He started playing acoustic guitar at age eight. Though mostly self-taught, he also took lessons at a local Omaha music store. Learning the songs of the times, Michael was heavily influenced by the guitar stylings of Lynyrd Skynyrd, Led Zeppelin, AC/DC, and Black Sabbath. Career By 1979, Michael had a Gibson SG and a Fender Princeton Reverb. Now wielding an electrified tone, he played in local bands and in church from the age of 12 until 18. In 1985, Michael started touring the country in cover bands. Unsatisfied with only playing other artists' songs, he eventually went back to Omaha and began teaching guitar. For the next few years, Michael's musical influences were expanding. Virtuosos like Jerry Reed, Chet Atkins, Albert Lee and Danny Gatton were among the list of new favorites. As Michael continued to enhance his chops, he recorded a five-song demo [recorded at rainbow recording Studios Omaha ] of instrumental guitar tunes that showcased his guitar playing. The demo was sent to Shrapnel Records, resulting in a record contract and subsequent release of his first album. In 1990, Michael released his self- titled debut album. This release showcased Michael's encyclopedic knowledge of bluegrass and country licks. With the strength of this album and the help of an international advertising campaign from Yamaha guitars to promote the company's Pacifica models, Michael's first release sold more than 100,000 copies. This well-received album also landed Michael the top spot in the category of “Best New Talent” in a readers' poll in Guitar Player magazine that year. He was also hailed as “One of the Most Influential Players of the Next Ten Years” by Guitar for the Practicing Musician. Michael's music was also popular in Europe, as Firkins won the Edison Award, which is the equivalent of a Grammy in the Netherlands. Michael went on to release three more records for the Shrapnel label. His sound would go on to incorporate even more diverse music styles, specifically jazz, as shown in a cover of Duke Ellington's “The Mooche” on Firkins' third album, Chapter Eleven. Cactus Cruz was his last recording for Shrapnel in 1996. In 1997, Firkins recorded Decomposition for Nuerra Records. An album composed of covers, Firkins pays tribute to some of his earlier influences, such as Lynyrd Skynyrd, Johnny Winter, and Jimi Hendrix. In the early 2000s, Michael teamed up with fellow virtuoso guitarist Gabriel Moses for a side project titled \\"Dose Amigos\\" which has been most frequently compared to the likes of Tenacious D. Both guitarists incorporated elements of bluegrass and heavy metal at extremely high speeds, with humorous themes. The project showcased Michael and Gabriel's original technique of emulating a slide guitar with the use of the tremolo arm.

A genuine all-rounder and the earliest known left-hander of note, Nyren was the captain of Hampshire (aka Hambledon) when its team included players like John Small, Thomas Brett and Tom Sueter. Although the records of many matches in which he almost certainly played have been lost, he made 51 known appearances between 1764 and 1784. He was known as the team's \\"general\\" on the field and, for a time, acted as the club secretary as well as taking care of matchday catering for many years. Cricket careerEarly mentions= Nylan was living in Sussex in 1758, as he married that year at Slindon, and was not definitely resident at Hambledon until 1762.Underdown, p. 108. The first confirmed mention of him as a cricketer was in 1764 when he was named as captain of the Hambledon team that defeated Chertsey by 4 wickets at Laleham Burway on 10–11 September.Mote (GDC), p. 164. A number of Hambledon matches were played from 1764 to 1771 but team and performance information has been lost. Nyren was certainly active through this period but there are only two more definite mentions of him before the 1772 season, when the keeping of match scorecards became habitual. On 31 July and 1 August 1769, he captained Hambledon at Guildford Bason against Caterham, Hambledon winning by 4 wickets, \\"particularly (by) the batting of Messrs Small and Bayton\\", before an estimated crowd of 20,000.Waghorn, p. 32.Wilson, p. 51.. This reference explains the dating discrepancy between the other two sources. On 23 and 24 September 1771, Nyren captained Hambledon against Chertsey at Laleham Burway in what has become known as the \\"big bat match\\". When Thomas Brett objected to the wide bat used by Chertsey's Thomas White, Nyren supported him and the Hambledon players effected a change in the Laws of Cricket, formally recognised in the 1774 code, to limit the width of the bat to four and one quarter inches.Buckley, p. 56.Nyren, p. 156.Underdown, p. 117. =1772 to 1774= An unusual feature of Nyren's career is that, in an age when \\"given men\\" were the norm rather than the exception in cricket teams, he was never recorded as playing for anyone other than Hambledon/Hampshire. The same applied to his bowling partner Thomas Brett. Scorecards began to be kept habitually from the 1772 season and Nyren was recorded in 48 first-class matches, plus some single wicket matches, from then until he retired in 1784.Haygarth, pp. 3–61.Ashley-Cooper, p. 177-180. The strength of the Hambledon/Hampshire team during Nyren's captaincy can be seen in its being rated the (unofficial) Champion County in 10 seasons: 1766–1771 inclusive, 1776–1777 inclusive, 1779 and 1783. In 1772, Nyren played for Hampshire at the Artillery Ground in a single wicket \\"fives\\" match against Kent, Kent winning by one wicket after Nyren had made the highest score in the match with 29.Haygarth, p. 3. Hampshire then played three first-class matches which have surviving scorecards. Under Nyren's leadership, Hampshire won the first two of these against All-England at Broadhalfpenny DownAshley-Cooper, p. 177. and Guildford BasonAshley-Cooper, p. 178. but then, without Nyren, they lost the third match against Kent at Bourne Paddock by 2 wickets.Haygarth, p. 4. 1773 was Hambledon's worst season. They played nine known matches in first-class cricket (i.e., 8 first-class and 1 single wicket) and lost all of them, some by wide margins including two innings defeats. Nyren led the team in most of the matches, two of which have no surviving scorecard, but he missed the first-class game against Surrey at Laleham Burway in September.Haygarth, pp. 6–16. Hampshire had better results in 1774 and twice defeated an All-England Eleven but were themselves beaten twice by Kent, a very strong team in the early 1770s. Nyren captained the team in all the games that have surviving scorecards, making 5 known appearances in all.Haygarth, pp. 17–21. =1775 to 1777= Nyren made 4 known first-class appearances in 1775, but did not take part in one of the most famous matches in history. This was the single wicket \\"fives\\" game at the Artillery Ground when a Hambledon Five defeated a Kent Five by one wicket, the not out batsman being John Small who was beaten three times by Lumpy Stevens, only for the ball to go through the two-stump wicket without disturbing the bail. As a result of Lumpy's protests, the middle stump was legalised, though its introduction was gradual.Haygarth, p. 21-22. However, Nyren did play against Surrey at Broadhalfpenny Down on 13 July and made his highest known score of 98, sharing a century partnership with Small for the 5th wicket and turning the match in Hampshire's favour. Small went on to make 136, the earliest definitely recorded century in the history of first- class cricket, and Hampshire eventually won by 296 runs having looked certain to lose before Nyren and Small came together.Haygarth, p. 25. When Nyren was out, he was confronted by Hambledon stewards Charles Powlett and Philip Dehaney who had bet heavily against Hampshire when the match looked lost. They remonstrated that they would lose their money because of Nyren and Small, but Nyren told them he was glad and said: \\"Another time, don't bet your money against such men as we are\\".Mote, p. 88. It may be added that Powlett was a Reverend and that both he and Dehaney had been on the committee which revised the Laws of Cricket only the previous year. In 1776, Hampshire finally turned the tables on Kent, winning three and losing one of their four fixtures. Nyren took part in all 7 known first-class matches that Hampshire played this season. In the first game, he scored 70 and 19 against Kent at Sevenoaks Vine, Hampshire winning by 75 runs in a low-scoring match, so his runs made all the difference; he also bowled well, taking at least 3 wickets.Haygarth, p. 27. Later in the season, in another match at Sevenoaks against All-England, Nyren and George Leer shared an unbeaten 5th wicket partnership of at least 50 to steer Hampshire to a six wicket victory.Haygarth, p. 29. When Hampshire beat Surrey by 198 runs at Broadhalfpenny Down on 26 August, it was largely due to Nyren's bowling as he took 5 wickets (all bowled) in the first innings.Haygarth, p. 30. 1777 was another great year for Hambledon with Hampshire playing All-England six times and winning four of them.Haygarth, pp. 31–36. At Sevenoaks Vine on 18, 19 and 20 June, Hampshire defeated All-England by an innings and 168 runs. James Aylward made the then record score in an individual innings with 167 as Hampshire amassed 403, a massive total in 18th century conditions. Among several sizeable partnerships he had was one with Nyren, who scored 37, for the 7th wicket.Haygarth, p. 31. In August, Nyren had a good game with the ball, taking 4 wickets in the first innings, as Hampshire beat All-England by 1 wicket at Guildford Bason.Haygarth, p. 34. =1778 to 1784= Nyren was about 44 when the 1778 season began and his appearances now decreased as he played in only 19 more matches from June 1778 until his last in June 1784.Haygarth, pp. 37–61. He was still capable of producing good performances, especially with the ball and took 4 All-England wickets in one innings at Itchin Stoke Down in July 1778.Haygarth, pp. 37–38. He bowled especially well in 1779, one of Hambledon's best seasons, when they won all four of their first-class matches, Nyren taking at least 16 wickets in the four matches (the scorecards of two games are incomplete). He had by now accepted that he was no longer an all-rounder and was batting at number 10 or 11 in every innings.Haygarth, pp. 39–43. He made only two known appearances in 1780 but continued to bowl well and took 5 wickets in one innings against Kent at Itchin Stoke Down.Haygarth, p. 46. He was again taking good wickets in 1781 and 1782, especially in the low-scoring match against Kent at Bourne Paddock in August 1781 when he and Lamborn bowled Hampshire to an eight-run victory.Haygarth, p. 50. Nyren bowed out of cricket in 1784 just as, ominously for Hambledon, the White Conduit Club made its debut in first-class matches.G. B. Buckley, Fresh Light on Pre-Victorian Cricket, Cotterell, 1937, p .18. The Hambledon membership was now in decline as the nobility began to seek a London venue for their cricketing activities and White Conduit was their initial attempt at establishing a metropolitan presence. Richard Nyren's final recorded appearance was in the All-England v Hampshire match at Sevenoaks Vine on 1 and 2 June 1784. All-England won convincingly by 7 wickets. Nyren scored 0 and 8, took one catch and no wickets.Haygarth, p. 61. Style and technique Nyren was left-handed as both batsman and bowler.Nyren, p. 56. He is the earliest of the left-handers listed in Scores & Biographies, others of his time being James Aylward, Tom Sueter, Noah Mann, Robert Clifford, Francis Booker, William Brazier and David Harris, although the latter bowled right- handed.Haygarth, p. xxiv. Nyren was a bowling all-rounder who was, with Thomas Brett, one of \\"the two principal bowlers\\" in the early Hambledon team.Nyren, p. 55. He bowled underarm at a fast-medium pace and \\"had a high delivery, always to the length, and his balls were provokingly deceitful\\". Ashley-Cooper commented: \\"Perhaps of all the players who appeared for Hambledon (sic) only William Beldham surpassed him in excellence as an all-round performer – apart, that is, from captaincy\\".Ashley-Cooper, p. 170. Nyren was widely considered to be the expert in all cricketing matters and at Hambledon he was \\"the chosen general of all the matches, ordering and directing the whole\\". He was \\"uniformly consulted on all questions of (cricket) law or precedent\\" and his decision was always accepted. A significant example of this level of influence occurred in 1771, as described above, following the \\"big bat\\" controversy when Nyren, Brett and Small effectively changed the Laws of Cricket by setting the maximum bat width. Nyren was a successful coach who worked with the young David Harris on his line and length, helping to make Harris into the most successful bowler of the 1780s.Altham, p. 45. Harris had begun as a \\"raw countryman, deplorably addicted to bowling full tosses\\". So Nyren took him in hand and \\"preached to him the great principle of three-quarter (sic) or length bowling\\". Character Often referred to as \\"The General\\" on the cricket field, Nyren seems to have been known among his familiars as Dick.Ashley- Cooper, p. 42. He was \\"a very stout man\\" who was about five feet nine inches tall, but was \\"uncommonly active\\".Nyren, p. 57. He kept himself fit during the winter by \\"(devoting) much time to hunting, shooting and fishing\\". Writing of his father, John Nyren says he \\"never saw a finer specimen of the thoroughbred old English yeoman than Richard Nyren\\", who was \\"a good face-to-face, unflinching, uncompromising, independent man\\". Nyren's response to Powlett and Dehaney in 1775 is consistent with this description. He would stand his ground even when disagreement arose with such luminaries as the major patrons John Frederick Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset, and Sir Horatio Mann. On one occasion, when Nyren had been proved right, Mann \\"crossed the ground and (shook) him heartily by the hand\\". Although, as Underdown points out, the Duke perhaps did not. Family and personal life Nyren was a nephew of the noted Slindon players Richard, John and Adam Newland who coached him as a boy.Ashley-Cooper, p. 169. Nyren was still living at Eartham in 1758 when he married Frances Pennicud at Slindon. He had moved to Hambledon from Sussex by 1762, when he became the landlord of a pub which was then called The Hut. Later, its name was changed to the Bat and Ball Inn; it is arguably the most famous pub with a cricketing connection and is still open for business immediately next to the Hambledon Club's ground at Broadhalfpenny Down. In 1772, Nyren took over the \\"more upmarket\\" George InnUnderdown, p.115. which was in Hambledon village close to the church, his Hambledon colleague William Barber taking over at the Bat and Ball for the next 12 years.Ashley-Cooper, p. 163. Nyren also maintained a small farm just outside Hambledon. For many years, Nyren and Barber took charge of match day catering at both Broadhalfpenny Down and Windmill Down and Ashley-Cooper's Hambledon Cricket Chronicle reproduces an advertisement that appeared in the Hampshire Chronicle of 28 July 1777: > ‘’Ladies and Gentlemen will find an excellent cold collation every day on > the Down, at Nyren and Barber's booths‘’. This advertisement must have been placed for a match that is now unknown as surviving records do not include any match on Broadhalfpenny Down in 1777 until September. On 22 June 1778, the Hampshire Chronicle advertised: > ‘’NYREN (sic) has laid in a stock of excellent wines and cold provisions, > and hopes the air of Stoke Down will, with the Ladies at least, stand in the > place of Marbres, Aspiques, Blanc Manges, &c.; For good appetite there will > be a sufficient quantity of beef, ham, chicken and tarts‘’. This advertisement was placed ahead of the Hampshire v All-England match at Itchin Stoke Down on 6 and 7 July 1778. Nyren took 4 wickets in the match but Hampshire lost by 45 runs.Haygarth, p. 37. Nyren was Secretary of the Hambledon Club for a time and one of his duties, apparently a thankless task, was to collect from members their subscriptions in arrears. Nyren's son John (1764–1837) was the author of The Cricketers of My Time.John Nyren, The Cricketers of my Time (ed. Ashley Mote), Robson, 1998. Legacy The success of Hambledon owed much to the co-operation of its subscribing members on one hand and the players on the other. Just as Nyren, supported by Small and others, was the principal figure in the team, the mainstays among the membership were the Reverend Charles Powlett, Philip Dehany and John Richards.Ashley-Cooper, pp. 148–156. After Nyren finished playing he became the Club Secretary, working closely with Richards who was the Treasurer.Ashley-Cooper, p. 156. They tried to keep things going in rural Hampshire but, as Ashley-Cooper points out in respect of Powlett, \\"found destiny too strong\\".Ashley-Cooper, p. 21. The end was in sight when Lord's was opened at Marylebone and several key patrons, including many Hambledon members, founded Marylebone Cricket Club. MCC immediately usurped Hambledon's position as the sport's lawgiver and became the principal club, while Lord's became the new focal point and feature venue within easy reach of the metropolis. Hambledon carried on for a few more seasons and Hampshire could still put a strong team in the field but \\"when Richard Nyren left Hambleton (sic) the club broke up, and never resumed from that day (for) the head and right arm were gone\\". This is a somewhat romantic view, written by Nyren's son. It is true that Richard Nyren left Hambledon for a time in 1791 and there was a party in his honour at the Bat and Ball in September of that year, but the club continued to function after that and Nyren still lived in Hambledon until 1796, the year in which the club's final minute read \\"No Gentlemen\\".Underdown, p. 175. The end came about not because Nyren left the club but because the membership moved to Marylebone.Underdown, p. 176. Richard Nyren moved to Bromley-by-Bow in 1796 and died there on 25 April 1797.

It was presented by Adam Hart-Davis and produced by Leeds UK-based Screenhouse Productions. The series set out to answer science questions by performing experiments. In the first series, topics included: 'Can you walk on the ceiling?' for which the team held an inverted walking competition, with Australians taking part; 'What will we do when the oil runs out?' with the shack in Cornwall and powered by alternative energy sources; and 'Why did the millennium bridge wobble?', in which the team built a working model of the footbridge near the Tate Modern. The second series included a greater role for Hart-Davis's backup team of Marty Jopson, Jem Stansfield, Sim Oakley, Janet Sumner and Alom Shaha. Challenges this time included: * Tall Buildings - in which the team try to make the world's biggest paper tower, complete with a lift, in the Millennium Dome * Can I walk on water? - in which the team tries to build machines to allow people to walk on water, and for a few seconds hold the Guinness world record * How high can I jump? - which sees Alom Shaha, athletes and others trying to jump over a model of the shack using only human powered devices * Can you make someone invisible? - in which the team build a mirrored suit for hiding in a forest, and an 'invisible' (but noisy) car * Can a human fly like a bird? - (i.e. powered by flapping wings rather than propellor), culminating in Hart-Davis being suspended from a one-man helium balloon and attempting to flap his wings * Could you build an underwater house? - in which a submerged house was made from two skips welded together, with a CO2 scrubber and various other survival gadgets.

As part of his cooperation, he served just five years in prison, and later authored a book about the mob. Early life Leonetti was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to Pasquale Leonetti and Annunziata Scarfo. Having been abandoned by his father at an early age, he was brought up by his mother. He moved to Ducktown, the Little Italy of Atlantic City, New Jersey shortly after, where he was protected and supervised by his uncle and other Scarfo members. He appeared to be the opposite of his uncle, a quiet and laid back personality. Leonetti has alleged that at 8 years old, he was used as a decoy by Scarfo to dispose of a dead body, explaining to the young Leonetti that he brutally stabbed a man in a New Jersey bar with an ice pick for disrespecting him. He attended Holy Spirit High School, where he played on the school's basketball team. It was in 1978 that he gained the moniker \\"Crazy Phil\\" from a local radio talk show host. Leonetti did not like the nickname and was not referred to as such by his mob peers.http://www.state.nj.us/sci/pdf/ocbars2.pdf Mob career In 1979, Nicky Scarfo ordered Leonetti to murder Vincent Falcone, a criminal associate who had been underestimating Scarfo's power within the crime family; he shot him twice. This would not be his last murder for Scarfo. A year later, he would be initiated as a made man. By the early 1980s, Leonetti was already a millionaire and controlled a lucrative trade of racketeering, illegal gambling, loan sharking, extortion and skimming from the Atlantic City casinos. A war within the family was also brewing as short reigned boss Philip Testa was killed by a nail bomb at his home in 1981, and so Scarfo began the war as he secured the top position for himself and eventually promoting Leonetti as his underboss In 1989, Leonetti received 45 years in prison for racketeering charges, while Scarfo was given 55 years. Shortly after, he agreed to testify against Scarfo and the family, also admitting to participating in 10 murders; this allowed for his release after only five years, subsequently going into hiding.https://www.phillyvoice.com/paying- respects-when-mob-said-their-good-byes-kellyanne-conways-grandfather/ Later life Shortly after Leonetti was released from prison, he married the former girlfriend of Vincent Falcone, whom he had murdered in 1979. In 2013, he published a book about his criminal life, Mafia Prince: Inside America's Most Violent Crime Family and The Bloody Fall of La Cosa Nostra, which details accounts of the Five Families, the American Mafia Commission and other crime families across the United States.

In Japan it also makes and sells other products such as brush pen tips. It is the owner of AlphaTheta Corporation which owns the Pioneer DJ brand. Products The first minilab, the QSS-1 (Quick Service System 1) was introduced by Noritsu in 1976. In 1979 Noritsu released the QSS-2, which for the first time allowed for photo processing, from film development to color printing in just 45 minutes. In 2002 Noritsu introduced the first dry minilab, using Epson's seven color inkjet piezoelectric printing head. It was significantly cheaper than its \\"wet\\" silver halide counterparts. Noritsu printer-paper processors (called minilabs) are typically designated a model number beginning with \\"QSS\\" followed by a number which increases with each new model. As of August, 2019, the newest Noritsu minilab are the wet silver halide QSS 39 series, introduced in 2018. Noritsu film processors for both C-41 negative and E-6 slide films are typically designated QSF, followed by a letter/number combination. Noritsu does not produce consumer photographic products such as film, photographic paper, and chemicals. Because of this, Noritsu works with Eastman Kodak, which produces film, photographic paper and chemicals, but not photofinishing equipment. Some Noritsu models have been re-branded and sold by Kodak as their own equipment. More recently, Noritsu has sold their digital minilabs under their own name, but with Kodak's software (called DLS for Digital Lab System) providing image processing and a user interface, rather than Noritsu's own software. Noritsu sold and supported Kodak's \\"Picture Maker\\" kiosks when they were first introduced in the mid-1990s. Noritsu equipment works with different brands paper and chemicals including Kodak, Fujifilm, and Trebla. Noritsu printer-paper processors are designed for color photographic prints but can be modified to print black and white. Although Noritsu has typically produced minilabs that utilize traditional silver halide papers and photographic exposure systems, inkjet printing systems in partnership with Epson have been added to the product line since 2003. Noritsu refers to them as \\"digital dry printers\\". In March 2006, Noritsu and Fuji announced a strategic alliance for Noritsu to manufactures all of Fuji's photofinishing hardware.

It is based in Batchelor, Northern Territory in Australia. Batchelor Institute is classified as a 'Table A' tertiary education provider. Like an increasing number of universities, Batchelor Institute is a dual- sector institution, providing Higher Education and Vocational Education and Training courses. The Institute is the first Indigenous-controlled higher education institution in Australia. It is also unusual in that most of its students are over 30 years of age, and a high proportion of its students are female. History Batchelor Institute began in the mid-1960s as an annex of Kormilda College, a residential school for Aboriginal students on the outskirts of Darwin, Northern Territory. Short training programs were provided for Aboriginal teacher aides and assistants in community schools. In 1974, the college moved to Batchelor (100 kilometres south of Darwin). It has been at its present site since 1982. A second campus of the college was established in Alice Springs in 1990 to address the educational needs of Aboriginal people from Central Australia. Other annexes were opened in Darwin, Nhulunbuy, Katherine and Tennant Creek. The Commonwealth Government recognised Batchelor College as an accredited independent higher education institution through the Higher Education Funding Act 1988. This meant that BIITE could issue its own degrees and other tertiary qualifications without outside involvement, in the same way as universities, and also be funded like them. The college was granted autonomy as a public sector agency in 1995. It became independent under Northern Territory legislation on 1 July 1999.

The party was led by John Davis, and campaigned on a platform similar to that of the much bigger National Front (NF) on anti-immigration, anti-European Economic Community, anti-communism themes.Peter Barberis, John McHugh, Mike Tyldesley, Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations: Parties, Groups and Movements of the 20th Century, Continuum International Publishing Group, 2000, p. 188 Development The party was found by John Davis who had been an ally of Andrew Fountaine before establishing his own group in the late 1960s.Martin Walker, The National Front, Glasgow: Fontana Collins, 1977, p. 100 Davis was a well-established friend of John O'Brien. When the latter became NF chairman in 1970, co-operation between the two parties increased, as was evidenced by the role Davis played in convincing the National Democratic Party to drop its candidate for the St Marylebone by-election and instead to campaign on behalf of the NF's Malcolm Skeggs. The close work between the NIP and NF came to an end when John Tyndall took charge of the latter. However, the struggle to gain the leadership had proven divisive and the NIP's ranks were swollen by the defection of O'Brien and his supporters away from the NF.Walker, The National Front, p. 133 The overall impact was not great, however, as Tyndall and Martin Webster were able to use Spearhead to portray O'Brien as merely a tool of an establishment determined to smash the NF whilst the NIP was little known in comparison to the NF, meaning that some NF members who sympathised with O'Brien were nevertheless not prepared to switch sides.Walker, The National Front, pp. 133-134 Nonetheless, Air Vice Marshal Don Bennett, a leading opponent of the Common Market, was among the figures to at least temporarily make the NIP the focus of his patronage following O'Brien's defection.Walker, The National Front, p. 135 Elections The party tested its electoral fortunes in the 1972 Uxbridge by-election but performed poorly. Although it finished ahead of one other fringe right-wing candidate, the \\"Democratic Conservative against the Common Market\\" candidate Reginald Simmerson, its 1.64% vote share put it behind the Union Movement's Dennis \\"Big Dan\\" Harmston (2.6%) and way behind the NF's John Clifton, whose 8.71% vote share was a very good result for the NF at the time.Walker, The National Front, p. 138 Its best performance came in the February 1974 general election when Michael Coney, standing as \\"National Independence - Anti-Common Market\\" captured 4.4% of the vote in Tottenham, finishing ahead of the NF's Roy Painter. This came despite Painter, a former member of the Conservative Party, being a well-known local figure and receiving widespread coverage in the area's press.Walker, The National Front, p. 151 By this time the relationship between the two parties had deteriorated so much that the NIP was \\"despised\\" by the NF. Haringey Despite being a minor party, the NIP registered one of the few occurrences of a far-right party securing electoral office in Britain before the 1990s. In 1974, Michael Coney, a local sub-post office manager, stood as NIP candidate for the South Tottenham ward of Haringey London Borough Council and as part of his campaign he appealed to the area's Jewish population not to vote on religious lines due to the Labour Party candidate, Aaron Weichselbaum, being Jewish. Leaders in the local Jewish community interpreted this as an attempt by Coney to whip up anti-Semitic feelings against Weichselbaum and, whilst another Labour candidate was elected in what was a safe seat, Weichselbaum was defeated by Coney.Ivor Crewe, The Politics of Race, p. 211 Coney was independent by the 1978 elections (the NIP having been wound up in the interim) and later served the Conservative Party but his example of building a strong local base in a single area, which included a 20.3% vote share in the 1973 Greater London Council election, was later lauded by elements within the British National Party who supported Nick Griffin against John Tyndall due to their support for a similar localist strategy.Jack Truman, \\"60 Years of Nationalism: Strategies Analysed\\", The Patriot, No. 1, Spring 1997, p. 25 Disappearance The support enjoyed by Coney in Haringey was not replicated elsewhere, however, and the NIP never became more than a minor force. The party, which was closely associated with a group calling itself the Political Independence Movement, failed to challenge the hegemony of the National Front on the far right and had disappeared before the decade was out. Many of its members returned to the NF.

Developed in 1984, it is effectively a rocket-boosted version of the GBU-15 bomb. It first entered operational service on 11 January 1999, and was retired in 2013. 502 were produced. Overview The AGM-130 is a powered air-to-surface missile designed for strikes at long range against various targets. It is essentially a rocket-boosted version of the GBU-15 bomb, with the rocket motor increasing the launch range and so giving the launch aircraft protection from whatever defenses may protect the target. Two can be carried by the F-111 and F-15E. In 1991 the development of some significant upgrades began; these included a new CCD seeker and a GPS/INS (GPS-aided Inertial Navigation System) mid-course guidance. This combined enhancement provided the system with an adverse weather capability. It can be retargeted in flight; the guidance head of the weapon provides a visual image of the target to the launch aircraft via the AXQ-14 data link, allowing the controller to steer it to the target (command guidance). The weapon can be retargeted in flight by simply steering it to a new target. Control can be released at any point, allowing the missile to home in on the target by itself. The AGM-130 is highly accurate, and is intended for use against high- value targets which are either slow moving or of fixed location. The GBU-15 is a modular weapon, and the AGM-130 continues this concept. It consists of a CCD TV or focal plane array imaging infrared seeker head, a radar altimeter, wings, strakes, a Mark 84 or BLU-109 warhead, a control section, and a rocket motor and data link unit. The AGM-130 needs little support on the ground, and can be based in remote \\"bare base\\" sites. What support and maintenance is required can be provided by mobile support equipment and intermediate level maintenance capability. Development of the AGM-130A began in 1984 as an improvement to the GBU-15. The first unit became operational in 1994. Precise numbers are classified, but the US Air Force planned to buy 4,000+ originally. This was reduced to 2,300 units, and in 1995 further reduced to 502. Development of the AGM-130 cost $192 million, not including a further $11 million for the AGM-130C. Variants The upgraded AGM-130 Mid-Course Guidance (MCG) weapon, employs an improved global positioning and inertial navigation system. This allows the weapon to be used with less input from the launch aircraft, freeing the pilot and weapon systems officer for other tasks. The weapon became operational in 1999 when two F-15Es from the 335th and 336th Fighter Squadrons at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, North Carolina, fired one weapon each. The AGM-130LW [lightweight] is designed to be used by single-seat aircraft such as the F-16C. It also has an enhanced global positioning and inertial navigation system capability. The smaller, less powerful warhead used on this weapon allows better control over collateral damage. The AGM-130C employed a 900 kg (2,000 lbs) BLU-109 penetrating warhead for use against hardened targets. It was developed, but not put into service. The Autonomous AGM-130 is a proposed weapon that would incorporate a laser radar (LADAR) seeker, removing any need for the weapon to be steered to the target. The aircraft interface would be based on the JDAM interface; use of the autonomous seeker would greatly reduce the mission planning requirements and aircrew workload. Elimination of the datalink would also reduce the susceptibility to countermeasures. Combat history The AGM-130 saw its first operational service on 11 January 1999 during Operation Northern Watch, when a pair of AGM-130s were used by F-15Es to destroy two Iraqi SAM sites.Michael Knights, Cradle of Conflict: Iraq and the Birth of Modern U.S. Military Power, 2005, p.225 The AGM-130 was also the weapon used in the April 1999 NATO strike on a railway bridge in Grdelica, Serbia.

After a traumatic difficulty in finding a family to foster them, they stay with a shopkeeper, Mr. Evans, who dominates his gentle but weak younger sister, whom they call \\"Auntie Lou\\". Another evacuee whom Carrie has befriended, Albert Sandwich, is staying at a dilapidated country house called Druid's Bottom with Mr. Evans's older sister, the dying Mrs. Dilys Gotobed, and her disabled cousin, Mr. Johnny Gotobed.Johnny seems to have cerebral palsy, but his disability is not named in the novel. Their English housekeeper, Hepzibah Green, is reputed to be a wise woman. Carrie and Nick become friends with Albert and Johnny and spend a lot of time there. The housekeeper tells the children many tales, including one about a curse on Druid's Bottom, which will be activated if a mysterious skull is removed from the house. It is revealed that Mr. Evans has been estranged from his older sister, Mrs. Gotobed, after she married a wealthy Englishman whose family owned the mines where their father was killed in an accident. Carrie is caught in the rift between the brother and sister. Despite almost universal contempt for Mr. Evans, Carrie gives him a chance and sees that, beneath his rough exterior, he genuinely is a well-meaning man, who became embittered with the world due to his hard life and the feud with his older sister, to whom he was once very close. When Mrs. Willow comes to visit them, they say nothing about their dislike of Mr. Evans, as they do not want to leave. Mrs. Gotobed assures Hepzibah and Mr. Johnny that they can continue to live in her house once she has died, and that she has made a will saying so. Carrie only meets Mrs. Gotobed twice before she dies, and Mrs. Gotobed asks Carrie to tell Mr. Evans that she has never forgotten him, despite their feud. Hepzibah and Albert tell Carrie that despite Mr. Evans's firm belief that Hepzibah is cheating Mrs. Gotobed out of money, she is in fact penniless. On Carrie's birthday, Albert kisses her as a present and she is delighted. Auntie Lou, meanwhile, becomes friendly with Major Cass Harper, an American soldier, keeping this secret from her brother, who would not approve. When Mrs. Gotobed dies, Albert is sure that Mr. Evans has stolen her will so that he can turn Hepzibah and Mr Johnny out of his deceased sister's house, despite there being plenty of evidence that Mrs. Gotobed had made no will – only mental deterioration led her to believe she had made one. Johnny and Hepzibah will be homeless after a month's notice, as the house has become Mr. Evans's property. Carrie does not want to believe this of Mr. Evans, seeing him as an honest man. Albert, on the other hand, is convinced that Mr. Evans has destroyed the will, and becomes even more adamant after he realises that a ring which Mr. Evans gives Carrie as a present had in fact belonged to Mrs. Gotobed. However, Carrie changes her mind about Mr. Evans after Albert vaguely recalls seeing an envelope in Mrs. Gotobed's jewellery box that disappeared after Mr. Evans visited the house to take an inventory of his late sister's belongings. This envelope, Carrie believes, was Mrs. Gotobed's will, and she too thinks Mr. Evans stole it to ensure that he would inherit everything. To prevent this from happening, she throws the cursed skull into the horse pond. Mrs. Willow arranges a new home for her family near Glasgow, and so the children prepare to leave, with mixed feelings. At the same time, Auntie Lou departs to marry Major Harper, leaving Mr. Evans alone. Carrie later learns that Mr. Evans is innocent after all: the envelope in fact contained nothing more than a childhood photograph of Mr. Evans and Mrs. Gotobed, which she had left him. Mr. Evans bought the ring he gave Carrie as a present for Mrs Gotobed in their youth. As the children leave by train, they see that Druid's Bottom is on fire. Carrie is guilt-stricken, believing it is her fault for casting out the skull. Thirty years later, Carrie's children discover that Hepzibah and Mr. Johnny are living in a converted barn at Druid's Bottom, having escaped the fire. Albert Sandwich still visits them. Mr. Evans, grieving and lonely, died long ago.

It is situated six miles from Cavan, near the N3 road between Cavan and Virginia. Stradone is identified in the Cavan County Council Development Plan 2003–2009 as a smaller urban community. Location Stradone is a small village approximately directly east of Cavan. It is located just off the National Route N3, Dublin to Cavan, where the Regional road R165 and Local Road (L-6046) converge. It is situated in the Stradone Local Electoral Area (part of the Cavan Rural Electoral Area).  Social and community facilities  The County Council estimates a population of approximately 60 persons living within the proposed development boundary. The main focus of the village is Duke Park football pitch (home to Laragh United Gaelic Football Club) and the Stradone Community Centre, which contains a playschool, gym and shop. There is no school or church within the village (these are located in the nearby Laragh area) and convenience retail is provided by the Post Office which is located beside The Cross’ public house outside the proposed village boundary. The village provides mainly social and community services to the surrounding community. Stradone benefited from an urban renewal scheme in 2004 and this has resulted in a well maintained village core with street furniture and planting. The bridge over the Stradone River is a feature in the village, as are the village's two water pumps, and Stradone House and Gate Lodge to the north of the village. The Stradone River contains a Brown Trout Fishery.  Services and infrastructure  The proposed sewage treatment system is planned cater for a population equivalent of 400. The village is currently serviced by Clifferna Private Group Water Scheme. The Stradone Local Exchange is also broadband enabled. The local Garda station closed at the end of January 2013.http://garda.ie/Controller.aspx?Page=10607  Transport  The village is only served on a Tuesday and Thursday by the Bus Éireann Dundalk to Cavan route 166 at 11.22am to Cavan and 1.45pm to Dundalk via Bailieboro. Stradone was previously served by the Bus Éireann Cavan to Dublin bus.  Land zoning and development  Circa 9 hectares have been identified within the Development Boundary for Stradone as being suitable for residential development, with a maximum density of 8-10 units per hectare, which would give an estimated maximum population growth of 255 persons. The proposed developments will also have to contribute to the provision of additional infrastructural services when the capacity of the treatment systems are exceeded. The plan aims to ensure that the future development of Stradone village occurs in a way that is consistent with the economic, social and physical sustainability of the village.

Description  The overall appearance depends on its habitat: sometimes it forms upright clumps of flowers; at other times, it sends prostrate leafy runners over a wide area; sometimes it distributes itself as single flowers. The flowers are small, yellow or sometimes orange/red (becoming yellow as they mature), and of typical shape for the family Fabaceae: these appear for a period of two weeks around May..  Propagation  The rate of seed production is variable: relatively low and sometimes negligible seed production. Seedlings remain the predominant method of extending its range. It has a low germination rate in the wild, although this can be improved in nurseries.  Distribution  Hippocrepis comosa is found in the UK, predominantly in the south..  Habitat  Hippocrepis comosa is a calciole (found only on chalk and limestone). It is a hardy plant that survives long periods of cold winters and dry summers years after year. Colonies are not harmed by sheep grazing, and are resistant to moderate trampling; they do not thrive after heavy ploughing or disturbance of the ground. In areas grazed by cattle they disappear, sometimes after several years (depending on grazing intensity.)  Ecology and butterflies  Hippocrepis comosa is the exclusive food plant of the caterpillars of chalkhill blue (Polyommatus coridon) and Adonis blue (Polyommatus bellargus) butterflies. Hippocrepis comosa Populations that support such butterflies occur on longstanding ungrazed meadows, quarries, edges of paths and wasteland; outside of southern England and the Midlands (e.g. the Gower and Yorkshire populations) the climate is unsuitable for the butterflies. Re-establishment of a colony of H. comosa is best attempted by planting individual plants: direct sowing has poor rates of success. Even this however offers no guarantee of a permanent colony (within a period as long as 20 years) and even less likelihood that the new plants will be used by significant populations of chalkhill blue butterflies within another 50 years.

The relations are often used to compute the real part from the imaginary part (or vice versa) of response functions in physical systems, because for stable systems, causality implies the condition of analyticity, and conversely, analyticity implies causality of the corresponding stable physical system. The relation is named in honor of Ralph Kronig and Hans Kramers. In mathematics, these relations are known by the names Sokhotski–Plemelj theorem and Hilbert transform. Formulation Illustration for one of the Kramers-Kronig relations. Search for the real part of the susceptibility with the known imaginary one. Let \\\\chi(\\\\omega) = \\\\chi_1(\\\\omega) + i \\\\chi_2(\\\\omega) be a complex function of the complex variable \\\\omega , where \\\\chi_1(\\\\omega) and \\\\chi_2(\\\\omega) are real. Suppose this function is analytic in the closed upper half-plane of \\\\omega and vanishes like 1/\\\\omega or faster as \\\\omega \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty. Slightly weaker conditions are also possible. The Kramers–Kronig relations are given by :\\\\chi_1(\\\\omega) = {1 \\\\over \\\\pi} \\\\mathcal{P}\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\int \\\\limits_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty {\\\\chi_2(\\\\omega') \\\\over \\\\omega' - \\\\omega}\\\\,d\\\\omega' and :\\\\chi_2(\\\\omega) = - {1 \\\\over \\\\pi} \\\\mathcal{P}\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\int \\\\limits_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty {\\\\chi_1(\\\\omega') \\\\over \\\\omega' - \\\\omega}\\\\,d\\\\omega', where \\\\mathcal{P} denotes the Cauchy principal value. So the real and imaginary parts of such a function are not independent, and the full function can be reconstructed given just one of its parts. Derivation The proof begins with an application of Cauchy's residue theorem for complex integration. Given any analytic function \\\\chi in the closed upper half plane, the function \\\\omega' \\\\rightarrow \\\\chi(\\\\omega') /( \\\\omega'-\\\\omega) where \\\\omega is real will also be analytic in the upper half of the plane. The residue theorem consequently states that : \\\\oint {\\\\chi(\\\\omega') \\\\over \\\\omega'-\\\\omega}\\\\,d\\\\omega' = 0 Integral contour for deriving Kramers–Kronig relations. for any closed contour within this region. We choose the contour to trace the real axis, a hump over the pole at \\\\omega' = \\\\omega, and a large semicircle in the upper half plane. We then decompose the integral into its contributions along each of these three contour segments and pass them to limits. The length of the semicircular segment increases proportionally to \\\\omega', but the integral over it vanishes in the limit because \\\\chi(\\\\omega') vanishes at least as fast as 1/\\\\omega'. We are left with the segments along the real axis and the half-circle around the pole. We pass the size of the half-circle to zero and obtain :0=\\\\oint {\\\\chi(\\\\omega') \\\\over \\\\omega'-\\\\omega}\\\\,d\\\\omega' = \\\\mathcal{P} \\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\int \\\\limits_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty {\\\\chi(\\\\omega') \\\\over \\\\omega'-\\\\omega}\\\\,d\\\\omega' - i \\\\pi \\\\chi(\\\\omega). The second term in the last expression is obtained using the theory of residues, more specifically the Sokhotski–Plemelj theorem. Rearranging, we arrive at the compact form of the Kramers–Kronig relations, :\\\\chi(\\\\omega) = {1 \\\\over i \\\\pi} \\\\mathcal{P} \\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\int \\\\limits_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty {\\\\chi(\\\\omega') \\\\over \\\\omega'-\\\\omega}\\\\,d\\\\omega'. The single i in the denominator will effectuate the connection between the real and imaginary components. Finally, split \\\\chi(\\\\omega) and the equation into their real and imaginary parts to obtain the forms quoted above. Physical interpretation and alternate form We can apply the Kramers–Kronig formalism to response functions. In certain linear physical systems, or in engineering fields such as signal processing, the response function \\\\chi(t-t')\\\\\\\\! describes how some time-dependent property P(t)\\\\\\\\! of a physical system responds to an impulse force F(t')\\\\\\\\! at time t'. For example, P(t)\\\\\\\\! could be the angle of a pendulum and F(t) the applied force of a motor driving the pendulum motion. The response \\\\chi(t-t') must be zero for t since a system cannot respond to a force before it is applied. It can be shown (for instance, by invoking Titchmarsh's theorem) that this causality condition implies that the Fourier transform \\\\chi(\\\\omega)\\\\\\\\! of \\\\chi(t)\\\\\\\\! is analytic in the upper half plane. Additionally, if we subject the system to an oscillatory force with a frequency much higher than its highest resonant frequency, there will be almost no time for the system to respond before the forcing has switched direction, and so the frequency response \\\\chi(\\\\omega)\\\\\\\\! will converge to zero as \\\\omega becomes very large. From these physical considerations, we see that \\\\chi(\\\\omega)\\\\\\\\! will typically satisfy the conditions needed for the Kramers–Kronig relations to apply. The imaginary part of a response function describes how a system dissipates energy, since it is in phase with the driving force. The Kramers–Kronig relations imply that observing the dissipative response of a system is sufficient to determine its out of phase (reactive) response, and vice versa. The integrals run from -\\\\infty to \\\\infty, implying we know the response at negative frequencies. Fortunately, in most physical systems, the positive frequency-response determines the negative-frequency response because \\\\chi(\\\\omega) is the Fourier transform of a real-valued response \\\\chi(t). We will make this assumption henceforth. As a consequence, \\\\chi(-\\\\omega) = \\\\chi^*(\\\\omega). This means \\\\chi_1(\\\\omega) is an even function of frequency and \\\\chi_2(\\\\omega) is odd. Using these properties, we can collapse the integration ranges to [0,\\\\infty). Consider the first relation, which gives the real part \\\\chi_1(\\\\omega). We transform the integral into one of definite parity by multiplying the numerator and denominator of the integrand by \\\\omega' + \\\\omega and separating: : \\\\chi_1(\\\\omega) = {1 \\\\over \\\\pi} \\\\mathcal{P}\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\! \\\\int \\\\limits_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty {\\\\omega' \\\\chi_2(\\\\omega') \\\\over \\\\omega'^2 - \\\\omega^2}\\\\, d\\\\omega' + {\\\\omega \\\\over \\\\pi} \\\\mathcal{P}\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\! \\\\int \\\\limits_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty {\\\\chi_2(\\\\omega') \\\\over \\\\omega'^2 - \\\\omega^2}\\\\,d\\\\omega'. Since \\\\chi_2(\\\\omega) is odd, the second integral vanishes, and we are left with :\\\\chi_1(\\\\omega) = {2 \\\\over \\\\pi} \\\\mathcal{P}\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\! \\\\int \\\\limits_{0}^{\\\\infty} {\\\\omega' \\\\chi_2(\\\\omega') \\\\over \\\\omega'^2 - \\\\omega^2}\\\\,d\\\\omega'. The same derivation for the imaginary part gives :\\\\chi_2(\\\\omega) = -{2 \\\\over \\\\pi} \\\\mathcal{P}\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\! \\\\int \\\\limits_{0}^{\\\\infty} {\\\\omega \\\\chi_1(\\\\omega') \\\\over \\\\omega'^2 - \\\\omega^2}\\\\,d\\\\omega' = -{2 \\\\omega \\\\over \\\\pi} \\\\mathcal{P}\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\! \\\\int \\\\limits_{0}^{\\\\infty} {\\\\chi_1(\\\\omega') \\\\over \\\\omega'^2 - \\\\omega^2}\\\\,d\\\\omega'. These are the Kramers–Kronig relations in a form that is useful for physically realistic response functions. Related proof from the time domain Hu and Hall and Heck give a related and possibly more intuitive proof that avoids contour integration. It is based on the facts that: * A causal impulse response can be expressed as the sum of an even function and an odd function, where the odd function is the even function multiplied by the signum function. * The even and odd parts of a time domain waveform correspond to the real and imaginary parts of its Fourier integral, respectively. * Multiplication by the signum function in the time domain corresponds to the Hilbert transform (i.e. convolution by the Hilbert kernel 1/\\\\pi \\\\omega) in the frequency domain. center Combining the formulas provided by these facts yields the Kramers–Kronig relations. This proof covers slightly different ground from the previous one in that it relates the real and imaginary parts in the frequency domain of any function that is causal in the time domain, offering an approach somewhat different from the condition of analyticity in the upper half plane of the frequency domain. An article with an informal, pictorial version of this proof is also available. Magnitude (gain)–phase relation The conventional form of Kramers–Kronig above relates the real and imaginary part of a complex response function. A related goal is to find a relation between the magnitude and phase of a complex response function. In general, unfortunately, the phase cannot be uniquely predicted from the magnitude. A simple example of this is a pure time delay of time T, which has amplitude 1 at any frequency regardless of T, but has a phase dependent on T (specifically, phase = 2π × T × frequency). There is, however, a unique amplitude-vs-phase relation in the special case of a minimum phase system, sometimes called the Bode gain-phase relation. The terms Bayard-Bode relations and Bayard-Bode theorem, after the works of Marcel Bayard (1936) and Hendrik Wade Bode (1945) are also used for either the Kramers–Kronig relations in general or the amplitude–phase relation in particular, particularly in the fields of telecommunication and control theory. Applications in physicsComplex refractive index= The Kramers–Kronig relations are used to relate the real and imaginary portions for the complex refractive index \\\\tilde{n}=n+i\\\\kappa of a medium, where \\\\kappa is the extinction coefficient. Hence, in effect, this also applies for the complex relative permittivity and electric susceptibility. =Optical activity= The Kramers–Kronig relations establish a connection between optical rotary dispersion and circular dichroism. =Magneto-optics= Kramers–Kronig relations enable exact solutions of nontrivial scattering problems, which find applications in magneto-optics. =Electron spectroscopy= In electron energy loss spectroscopy, Kramers–Kronig analysis allows one to calculate the energy dependence of both real and imaginary parts of a specimen's light optical permittivity, together with other optical properties such as the absorption coefficient and reflectivity. In short, by measuring the number of high energy (e.g. 200 keV) electrons which lose a given amount of energy in traversing a very thin specimen (single scattering approximation), one can calculate the imaginary part of permittivity at that energy. Using this data with Kramers–Kronig analysis, one can calculate the real part of permittivity (as a function of energy) as well. This measurement is made with electrons, rather than with light, and can be done with very high spatial resolution. One might thereby, for example, look for ultraviolet (UV) absorption bands in a laboratory specimen of interstellar dust less than a 100 nm across, i.e. too small for UV spectroscopy. Although electron spectroscopy has poorer energy resolution than light spectroscopy, data on properties in visible, ultraviolet and soft x-ray spectral ranges may be recorded in the same experiment. In angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy the Kramers–Kronig relations can be used to link the real and imaginary parts of the electrons self-energy. This is characteristic of the many body interaction the electron experiences in the material. Notable examples are in the high temperature superconductors, where kinks corresponding to the real part of the self-energy are observed in the band dispersion and changes in the MDC width are also observed corresponding to the imaginary part of the self-energy. =Hadronic scattering= The Kramers–Kronig relations are also used under the name \\"integral dispersion relations\\" with reference to hadronic scattering. In this case, the function is the scattering amplitude. Through the use of the optical theorem the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is then related to the total cross section, which is a physically measurable quantity. =Geophysics= For seismic wave propagation, the Kramer–Kronig relation helps to find right form for the quality factor in an attenuating media.

It serves as the border between the Carytown/Museum District to the west and the Fan district to the east. Attempts were made to rename the street after Arthur Ashe, a tennis star and social activist who was born and grew up in Richmond, but previous attempts failed until February 2019 when Richmond City Council voted in favor of changing the name to Arthur Ashe Boulevard. Near the south end is Richmond's Boulevard Bridge (commonly called the \\"Nickel Bridge\\", in reference to its historical initial toll) across the James River. Arthur Ashe Boulevard intersects with main arteries Cary Street, Main Street, Monument Avenue, Broad Street (where the Historic District ends), Leigh Street, and Interstate 64/95, and terminates at Hermitage Road. The Diamond is located on Arthur Ashe Boulevard. The intersection of Arthur Ashe Boulevard and Monument Avenue featured a statue of Stonewall Jackson. Arthur Ashe Boulevard is designated as State Route 161, a route promoted in the 1940s and 1950s as an alternate bypass route before the Richmond-Petersburg Turnpike and Interstate 95 were built, connecting with U.S. Route 1 north and south of downtown Richmond. In 2019 American artist Kehinde Wiley's outdoor sculpture Rumors of War was erected adjacent to Arthur Ashe Boulevard. It is part of the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts permanent art collection.

The lake is elongated, orientated southwest to northeast, and lies in the Eyasi-Wembere branch of the Great Rift Valley. A screenshot of Lake Eyasi taken from World Wind. The principal inflow is the Sibiti River, which enters the southwestern end. The river may continue to flow somewhat year round, at least in wetter years; the other inflows are all seasonal. The second largest inflow is the Baray, at the northeast. The water carried by the Baray has increased in recent years due to deforestation of the Crater Highlands. The southwest flank of Mount Oldeani, one of the Ngorongoro volcanos, drains directly into the northeast end of the lake. Flow from the Budahaya / Udahaya River, which drains into the Yaeda Swamp to the southeast of the lake, was once second, but has decreased due to water diversion in the Mbulu Highlands. Water flow from the Serengeti is minor; the largest stream is the Sayu. Seasonal water level fluctuations in the lake are dramatic, though the northwestern shore is constrained by the cliffs of the Serengeti Plateau. During the dry season the lake may dry up almost entirely, especially in drier years, so that Datooga herders and Hadza foragers will cross the lake on foot, but in El Niño years it may flood its banks and attract hippopotamus from the Serengeti. It is a seasonal stop for migrating flamingos. The lake supports minor local fishing in wet years, but more often catfish and lungfish are taken from the streams and springs that feed the lake. Even during wet periods, lake depths typically remain less than one metre. The Hadza are the indigenous inhabitants of the lake. They are found along most of the perimeter, though camps are few along most of the Serengeti, which is Maasai territory. The Datooga inhabit the Yaeda Valley to the southeast, the Isanzu the south, and the Sukuma across the Sibiti River in the southwest. The Iraqw traditionally lived on the other side of Yaeda, but have come in increasing numbers to the Baray, which is now the primary onion-growing region of East Africa.

Since the 1992 boundary changes, the parish has included the whole of Roke and Rokemarsh (previously largely in the parish of Benson) and Berrick Prior (previously part of the parish of Newington). The 2011 Census recorded the parish's population as 326. In 1965, Reginald Ernest Moreau (1897–1970), an eminent ornithologist, and a Berrick Salome resident from 1947, realized that he could build up a picture of the village as it had been in the decades before the First World War, based on the recollections of elderly villagers. His study, which was published in 1968 as The Departed Village: Berrick Salome at the Turn of the Century, also included an introduction to local history. This provided much of the information for \\"A Village History\\" which appeared in The Berrick and Roke Millennium BookMillenniumBook 1999, pp. 9–12. (S Radice) and is the major source for this article. Toponym Berewic is Old English for \\"barley farm\\" and Salome is from the surname \\"Sulham\\". In the 13th century, Aymar de Sulham held the manor; There is a Britwell Salome about to the east, and Sulham is a parish in Berkshire on the River Thames near Reading. Liam Tiller gives early versions of the name as Berewiche (1086) and Berewick (1210, 1258). Moreau quotes later versions found in The Place-names of Oxfordshire, as Berrick Sullame (1571), Berwick Sallome (1737, 1797), and, by the time of the 1863 Inclosure Award, Berrick Salome. In fact, the modern spelling can be found much earlier: the 1830 OS one inch map, reproduced in Ditmas, shows Berwick Salome [sic], though in a smaller typeface than Berwick Prior. Prior: Berrick Prior is the corn farm belonging to the Prior of Canterbury (see below: 'Middle Ages'). Geography Berrick seems to have been first settled because it had a reliable source of water. Springs rise to the north-east of the parish at the junction of the Upper Greensand and Gault clay. The most significant of these springs rises near Grove Barn, and is the source of the brook which enters the village along Hollandtide Bottom and flows, culverted in places, past the village pond (which it does not feed) before turning south to run under the forecourt of the Chequers Inn, under the road and across fields, passing east of Lower Berrick Farm and then turning west toward the Thames. Until mains water was connected in the village, people in the northern part of Berrick drew their water from this brook, outside what is now the Chequers car park, leaning over a railing to scoop the water using what Moreau refers to as a \\"big dipper\\" which was kept on the bank there. He also notes that, as late as the 1960s, a resident of Berrick Littleworth could be seen crossing Back Street to draw water from a roadside brook flowing from Hillpit Spring. Parish Church The west end of St Helen's nave, showing the Romanesque font and 17th century west gallery Decorated Gothic piscina and credence shelf =Church history= St. Helen's parish church is about east of the Chequers, well away from any houses, and at the dead end of a lane which is the surviving part of Keame's Hedge Way, an ancient track closed in the 19th century as part of the Inclosure process, which joined the east–west route along Hollandtide Bottom just north of the church. Christine Holmes, in Benson: A Village Through its History identifies a \\"straight Roman road running east from Dorchester along which the churches of Shirburn, Pyrton, Cuxham, Brightwell Baldwin, Berrick Salome and Warborough all lie\\".Holmes, C, in This road would have run through Hollandtide Bottom from Berrick to Brightwell. It has been suggested that, when St Helen's was built, there may have been houses grouped around the church, and that the village centre may have moved later to the junction where the track along Hollandtide Bottom meets routes to Chalgrove, Newington, Warborough, and Benson. It is uncertain when the church was first established in Berrick but the fact that it is dedicated to Saint Helen suggests that it may have been founded (or refounded) in the late eighth century when King Offa of Mercia recaptured the Benson area from Wessex. Holmes writes \\"St. Helen – an unusual dedication for Oxfordshire but allegedly a favourite of Offa\\".Holmes, C, in Apart from Berrick and Benson churches, there is only one in the county dedicated to St Helen, at Albury (near Thame). There is a view, not universally accepted, that parts of the present building, and, in particular, the font, predate the Norman conquest of England. The font has interlacing ornament of a style originating in Northumbria in the early days of English Christianity. The architectural historians, Jennifer Sherwood and Nikolaus Pevsner describe the font as Norman, while Liam Tiller comments, \\"It is surprising that such a high quality font should be found in such a small rural chapel\\", and suggests that it may have been brought to Berrick from a larger church, perhaps Chalgrove, at a later date. Also, Moreau observes that Berrick church is not included in the Taylors' comprehensive work on Anglo-Saxon architecture. St. Helen's, Berrick has long been a chapelry of St Mary's, Chalgrove, and identical lists of incumbents displayed in both churches show that, at least from the 11th century, the two parishes have always had the same priest, although they have had no common boundary since Berrick Prior was transferred to Newington parish in the reign of King Canute (as explained below). Moreau drew attention to another ecclesiastical oddity in the relationship; the incumbent is Vicar of Chalgrove but Rector of Berrick. He/she lives in the vicarage in Chalgrove, more than from Berrick church, and has no rectory in Berrick. The arrangement of boundaries (See below: '18th and 19th centuries') seems to have caused some uncertainty about parish responsibilities so that, in the middle of the 19th century, \\"Berrick Salome and Roke had been linked under the ministry of an assistant curate from Benson\\". At that time, as will be seen below, most of the houses in Roke, but only two in Berrick, fell within Benson parish, and in the same period, as Moreau records, there was an unusual protest against the 'discontinuance and stopping', under the Inclosure Award 1853, of Keame's Hedge Way which provided a short cut for the residents of Roke going to Berrick church. Also unusual is the story Moreau had from the Treasurer of Christ Church, Oxford, about the intervention, in 1853, by the vicar of Beckley, some away, who persuaded Christ Church to buy a plot of land to build a new church at Berrick Littleworth because \\"the present church at Berwick [sic] is very badly situated for the people at Berwick and very far from Roke\\". No new church for Berrick was built and control of the land, in Berrick parish, was given to the incumbent of Benson until it was sold over a century later. Perhaps the college preferred not to give control to the then Rector of Berrick, the radical Robert French Laurence, for fear that he would use the land to house the poor (see below: '18th and 19th centuries'). =Church building= The church is long and, as will be seen from the photograph, the top of the tower is only about above the roof of the nave. In 1615, an earlier nave roof was replaced by \\"one of typical queen-post type with a complex timber truss\\", In 1676, a wooden gallery was added with dormer windows, one of which can be seen in the photograph. \\"The circular stairway to the gallery at the west end of the central aisle appears to have blocked the doorway to the tower.\\" As there were only 80 'conformists' in Berrick in 1676, the gallery probably provided accommodation for the church choir and band. The names of the churchwardens responsible for both these improvements are recorded on now- faded signs. Sherwood and Pevsner commend the medieval tiles found in the chancel as one of the more notable collections in the county, along with those at Nuffield and Somerton. St. Helen's has a timber-framed tower, much like that at Drayton St Leonard where there is a \\"low [west] tower with a pyramid roof and entirely timber-framed, unusual in Oxfordshire.\\" Waterperry also has a timber-framed tower while Lyford parish church has a wooden bell turret.Lyford, Oxfordshire, photograph of church, Accessed 24 May 2013 \\"A photograph [of St Helen's] taken just before the restoration in 1890 shows it had then merely been faced with simple weather-boarding carried nearly to the top, where, as now, horizontal apertures were contrived to release the sound of the bells.\\" The tower has a ring of six bells. Henry I Knight of Reading, Berkshire cast the second and fourth bells in 1621. Alexander Rigby of Stamford, Lincolnshire cast the third, fifth and tenor bells in 1692. W. & J. Taylor of Loughborough, Leicestershire cast the treble bell in 1836, presumably at their then foundry in Oxford. In 1890, the church was restored under the direction of the architect A. Mardon Mowbray. The Builder magazine criticised the restoration, saying that it \\"exceeded real necessity\\", and it was condemned by Sherwood and Pevsner as \\"a hideous application of all the trappings of fashionable late [19th century] domestic architecture to a church.\\" Economic and social historyMiddle Ages= The Domesday Book values Berewiche (Berrick) at £5 a year, compared with £30 and £15 respectively for the neighbouring parishes of Bensingtone (Benson) and Neutone (Newington). The survey enumerates 4 serfs, 10 villeins and 6 bordars; the total population, including wives and children, was probably between 50 and 70. None of the men in the categories listed are freemen; all are within the hierarchy of serfdom, a modified form of slavery. \\"Villeins typically held land of their own in the village fields, but conditional on payment of dues and provision of labour to the lord of the Manor, while bordari [bordars or cottars] usually held smaller holdings, or cottages and surrounding plots only and owed heavy labour services obliging them to work on the lord's demesne\\",Holmes, C, in and serfs, the lowest category, although they could not be sold as individuals, could be transferred with the land which they worked. The village boundaries seem to have developed haphazardly from the earliest times and remained complicated even after the Divided Parishes and Poor Law Amendment Act 1882 which, locally, resolved only the position of some distant water meadows and invasive parts of Benson (see below). A county-wide rationalisation in 1931First General Review of County Districts and Parishes by the Oxfordshire County Council, 1931 sorted out 'amongst others a patchwork of detached elements east of the village (see below). Finally, in 1993, the four hamlets were unified within simple boundaries. The northern boundary was set in the early 11th century when a manor, bounded to the south by Hollandtide Bottom, was forfeited to King Canute. He gave it to his wife, Emma of Normandy, who passed it to the Prior of Canterbury. Ditmas shows this transfer as occurring in 997, five years before Emma's first marriage, to Æthelred the Unready. As Newington parish was a peculiarChambers Concise 20th Century Dictionary (1985) defines a 'peculiar' as a parish exempt from the jurisdiction of the diocesan bishop of the Archbishop of Canterbury, the manor, which came to be called Berrick Prior, was taken into that parish, as was Britwell Prior, which seems to have been part of the same gift. With its ecclesiastical connection came exemption from the jurisdiction of the Sheriff of Oxfordshire, and, even into the 20th century, it was still referred to, in some directories, as 'the Liberty of Berrick Prior', although 'liberties' had been abolished in the 19th century. The transfer resulted in the northern boundary of Berrick Salome passing through the centre of the village and taking both the village pub and the village pond into Newington parish. Outside its eastern boundary, Berrick Salome parish included five exclaves, all beyond the Ewelme-Chalgrove road, in an area where there were also detached parts of both Benson and Ewelme parishes, while the southern boundary used to wind around the houses in Roke and Rokemarsh so that most of the residents were in Benson. Only the western boundary was relatively simple, but even there, the parish had once included water meadows on the River Thame, south-west of Newington and about from Berrick. Within the boundaries, there were, in the centre of Berrick, midway between the Chequers and the southern fork, two houses and some plots of land which were detached parts of Benson parish. =18th and 19th centuries= St Helen's parish church is the only significant building and, as the Rev George Villiers A.M., rector from 1722 to 1748, reported to a diocesan visitation in 1738, \\"there is no family of note\\". Until the Berrick Salome Inclosure Award was made by the Inclosure Commissioners in 1863, most of the land in the village was still worked on the open field system and there were few enclosed fields. Thomas Newton, who acquired Crowmarsh Battle Farm in 1792, started the move towards enclosure in Berrick. The farm name does not commemorate a local battle; it was recorded in the Domesday Survey \\"as land of the church of Labatailge [Battle Abbey]\\". Newton made \\"his first documented attempt to promote enclosure at Benson in 1807\\". Newton persisted for decades and, in 1827, promoted a Parliamentary Bill which other farmers opposed. The opposition was led by three substantial farmers: John Franklin of Ewelme, Edward Shrubb of Benson and John Hutchings of Berrick Salome; who were all concerned because \\"the common fields of Benson were so intermixed with those of Berrick and Ewelme that no measure could succeed unless it dealt with all three parishes.\\" The opposition was successful, largely thanks to the work of their lawyer, George Eyre, of another Ewelme farming family. However the Bill was presented again every November at the start of each new parliamentary session, opposed on each occasion, and in November 1830, local farm workers took part in the Swing Riots which, though directed against enclosures, involved Luddite-style machine breaking. Some of the rioters were punished with transportation. It was not until 1852, after the death of Thomas Newton, that the Inclosure Act for Benson, Berrick Salome and Ewelme was finally passed,Act 16 Vic. c 3 and the Inclosure Commissioners then took another 11 years to make their Award. This must have affected nearly half the households in Berrick Salome, but Moreau found no impression that the change had disrupted village life. And the Inclosure Award did provide two great benefits to the villagers. The first was the allotment of 3 acres, 2 roods and 25 poles (about 1.5 hectares) \\"unto the Churchwardens and Overseers of the Poor\\" of Berrick Salome \\"to be held by them and their successors in trust as a place for exercise and recreation for the inhabitants.\\"Inclosure Commissioners, Berrick Salome Inclosure Award, 1863 In Moreau's day the annual cricket match was still held on this field. In the 19th century and early 20th century when every Saturday afternoon in the cricket season there was a match and Berrick Salome 'never got beat' (according to one old man interviewed by Moreau in the 1960s). The second was the allocation of 2 acres and 10 perches (about 0.84 hectares) to \\"the Churchwardens and Overseers of the Poor\\" of Berrick Salome \\"to be held by them and their successors in trust as an allotment for the labouring poor of the said parish.\\" If his family were not to go hungry, the now landless peasant needed his pig, his garden and his allotment. Until well into the 20th century, few of the rural poor had any employment opportunities other than as farm labourers. Another, and less welcome, feature of the Award was the declaration of several dozen traditional roads, ways and tracks (mainly crossing common land) as 'discontinued and stopped'. Writing a century after the Award, Moreau found that resentment of the closure of Keame's Hedge Way was still remembered, and he records that there had been an unsuccessful attempt to keep it open by the curious device of carrying a corpse along the track. It ran south-east from a junction with Hollandtide Bottom, near Church Cottage, past the church, crossing the surviving road to Roke at Berrick Littleworth and emerging in Roke opposite Chapel Lane.Richard Davis, Oxfordshire [2 inch map], 1797 While it survived, Keame's Hedge Way provided a more direct and shorter route to church for the residents of Roke. The stretch onwards from Berrick Littleworth remains as a public footpath. Moreau could find no explanation of the name. Rev. Robert French Laurence (1807–85), who was vicar of Chalgrove and Berrick Salome for the last 53 years of his life, was secretary of the local agricultural workers' trades union. He was a social reformer who campaigned for better housing for agricultural workers and had new thatched cottages built for them in 'the parish' of Chalgrove, presumably, as the vicarage is in that parish. By the end of the 19th century, rural roads were in poor condition, being poorly maintained by casual labourers who scattered broken stone from local quarries or collected from fields. At that time, steam rollers were not used on rural roads so the loose stones were not compacted into a stable surface. This neglect had a tragic consequence in 1894 when a woman traveller, passing through Berrick, was \\"killed by falling from a tricycle in consequence of its coming into contact with a large flint.\\" The coroner referred the case to the Watlington Highway Board, with some disapproval. Moreau recorded five licensed premises selling mainly beer to a local population of about 300 at the turn of the century. Four were within the parish boundaries: The Chequers in Berrick Prior and the Home Sweet Home in Roke were public houses, while the Plough and Harrow in Berrick Salome and The Welcome in Roke were off-licences. The fifth was the Horse and Harrow pub which, although in the centre of Rokemarsh, stood just outside the Berrick parish boundary. There were several small shops and post offices at different times; Moreau records that between 1890 and 1910 four different cottages hosted the Berrick post office. His book includes photos of three of them, one of which is still known as The Old Post Office. There was, for nearly 30 years, an infant school at Roke, funded by Christ Church, Oxford which held the advowson to the Chalgrove-cum-Berrick living. The school had closed by 1884, after which the infants joined the older children walking to Benson School. Moreau records that boots for that purpose were provided out of Mary White's bequest, a small charitable income left in 1729, to teach reading to the children of the poor in Berrick. Within living memory infant classes were held in the Band Hut. =20th century= Moreau reported that, at the turn of the century, an adult 'day man' [full-time adult worker] was paid about 12 shillings a week (60p). He commented that this figure that had not increased much for a long time, but it seems possible that his informants understated the rates of pay. Contemporary sources indicate a significantly higher figure. \\"Around this time agricultural wages in Oxfordshire were some of the lowest in the country, on average 14s 6d (72p) a week in 1902\\".Parliamentary Papers 1905, xcvii, p. 348. cited in However, the rapid spread of mechanisation, beginning with the appearance of the first tractors shortly before the First World War, brought about a steady decline in the number of farm labourers. As farms became more mechanised, young men sought other employment. Alison Reid writes \\"By 1930, the Morris car factories at Cowley, reached by bicycle and later by works bus, attracted workers from places as distant as Benson\\".Reid, A, in By 1938 five residents of Berrick were working at Morris Motors. In 1930, the average weekly pay in the motor industry was £3.16s (£3.80), whereas the base rate of pay for agricultural workers set by the Agricultural Wages (Regulation) Act 1924 was £1 11s 8d (£1.58). Some rode motorcycles and bought their petrol from the shop next to the Chequers which at that time met most of the needs of the villagers. The village is still surrounded by farmland but, by the end of the century, there was only one working farm left in Berrick – Manor Farm – and that was run by the farmer and his wife. There are six other properties which still bear the names of the little farms which used to occupy their sites. Today the cottages of Berrick Salome are likely to be owned and inhabited by business people or independent professionals. By 1999, none was occupied by a farm worker.: by reference to the stated occupations of residents of old cottages Other local trades also declined in the 20th century. As noted above, there were five licensed premises in 1900. The Plough and Harrow (now Plough Cottage) and The Welcome closed early in the century, and the Horse and Harrow closed in 1988 after the death of its last landlord, Jim Austin, only a few years before the parish boundary change moved it into Berrick parish. The building is now a private house but retains the name Horse and Harrow. As Moreau mentions, there was a long series of post offices, and other small shops. The last, which closed in the 1980s, was a combined shop and post office in the annexe of the Chequers. Moreau includes a photo of The Chequers showing the shop fascia board, and a drawing of the same view, by David Gentleman, appears as the heading to Moreau's chapter 12. The former shop and post office is now the pub toilets. Another casualty of the same era was the garage at Woodbine Cottage in Roke, generally remembered only for a single derelict petrol pump that was removed in the 1980s. Janette Baker, now living in Rokemarsh, grew up in Roke, in the bungalow next door to Woodbine Cottage, and recalls passing \\"the garage\\" on her way home from the school bus. After the Second World War, indoor plumbing was introduced. Queen Emma's gift (recorded above) had the incidental result of putting the Berrick village pond into Newington parish. In the 1930s, according to Moreau, \\"the person who had acquired the little properties to the north-east of the pond enclosed it [the pond]\\" and, although the Berrick villagers objected strongly, only Newington had the right to challenge the enclosure under the Commons Act 1876. Newington apparently took no action. In The Berrick and Roke Millennium Book, the owners of the house provide another view of the event. The three little properties had been combined into one by Alan Franklin in the mid-1930s and were sold to a Mrs Hills in 1936. \\"Rumour has it that she fenced in the drover's [sic] pond. However the Title Deeds quite clearly show the pond was included in the land transferred to her.\\" Berrick Salome's population increased towards the end of the 20th century. The 1901 Census recorded 103 inhabitants, the 1971 Census recorded 99,1971 Census County Report for Oxfordshire (Part 1); Bullingdon RD; Berrick Salome but the 1981 Census recorded 1521981 Census: Ward and Civil Parish Monitor – Oxfordshire, pp. 18, 19 and the 1991 Census recorded 163.1991 Census: Ward and Civil Parish Monitor – Oxfordshire, p. 10 These census figures for both population and household numbers relate only to Berrick Salome parish within its pre-1993 boundaries. Moreau reckoned that \\"around 1900 there were about 75 households in the whole group of hamlets, 35 of them within the boundaries of Berrick Salome parish\\" and \\"when I came to live in Berrick Salome in 1947 there were 28 households strictly within the boundaries of the parish, another 8 just outside them to the north in Berrick Prior, about 11 more in the Benson part of Roke, and 14 in Rokemarsh... 61 altogether\\". He adds that \\"one block of three [one-up and one-down] cottages, now [in 1968] occupied by one old lady, is said to have at one time housed twenty people\\". The number of households increased from 36 in the 1971 Census to 52 in the 1981 Census and in 56 in the 1991 Census. At the turn of the Millennium, according to The Berrick and Roke Millennium Book, there were 18 houses in Berrick Prior, 46 in Berrick Salome, 40 in Roke, and 24 in Rokemarsh: numbers of houses shown on the maps, with The Chequers and Hollandtide Cottage counted as Berrick Prior, and Roke Farm Cottages as Rokemarsh The increase in population may be related to the building of the M40 motorway. The M40 was built from London to Stokenchurch in 1967, and extended through the Vale of Oxford in 1974.M40 motorway, accessed 21 May 2013 Thereafter, London was about an hour's journey away.

The NDP sought to position itself as an early rival to the National Front although ultimately it failed to challenge the position of this group.1958-1968 Rivers of blood - Fascists begin to unite Background The NDP had existed on paper since the early 1960s as the title was used by Dr David Brown in both the 1964 and 1966 general elections to contest the Ipswich constituency, securing 0.6% and 1.3% of the vote in the respective elections. However this NDP had no existence beyond Brown and it was not until 1966 that a process of formalisation as a proper political party took place. Formation In 1966, Brown, who was also the chairman of the Racial Preservation Society, proposed to form the NDP by merging the RPS with John Bean's British National Party.Martin Walker, The National Front, Glasgow: Fontana Collins, 1977, p. 63 However this did not occur as Bean was put off by Brown insisting that the Greater Britain Movement should be excluded from any alliance and that Brown should be sole leader of the new party. Following this Brown entered negotiations with A.K. Chesterton about using the League of Empire Loyalists as the basis for the NDP but this plan was rejected by Chesterton as once again Brown insisted that leadership should lie with him alone.Walker,The National Front, p. 64 The National Front, effectively a merger between the BNP, LEL and elements of the RPS under Robin Beauclaire followed soon afterwards, with Brown excluded. Despite this set back the NDP was established officially in 1966 before the NF although critics, particularly from within the NF, argued that Brown only did so as he could not stand the prospect of serving under A. K. Chesterton. Amongst the leading members of the party upon formation was Leslie Eric 'Lutz' Vaughan who had been associated with the National Socialist Movement's Spearhead paramilitary wing and Column 88. 1970 election In its early years, the Party expanded through mergers with a number of smaller movements, including the British Defence League, a small group based around ex-Conservative John O'Brien.Walker, The National Front, p. 95 Another group to join was the Association of British People, a 200 strong group from Birmingham that opted for the NDP after turning down the overtures of the National Front's Martin Webster. This group took the lead in the campaign in the Birmingham Stechford seat where the party won 3.% of the vote in the 1970 general election.Walker, The National Front, pp. 99-100 In the same election the NDP had managed the largest vote share of any far-right group competing in Southampton Itchen, where it won 21.8% of the votes. Southampton was the seat of the Speaker of the House of Commons however, and traditionally, re-election of the Speaker is unopposed by other major parties. Dr. Brown, meanwhile, won an improved 3.7% vote share in Ipswich, a seat he continued to contest until his final election in February 1974.David Boothroyd, Politico's Guide to the History of British Political Parties, 2001, p. 182 With only 2.5% of the vote secured for its candidate in Leicester North West, and although the party had attracted some disaffected Conservatives who supported Enoch Powell, there was a general feeling within the NDP that the election had been disappointing for them.Walker, The National Front, p. 100-101 Relationship with NF O'Brien had already left the NDP to join the NF before the election, although he maintained close links with Anthony Baron, whose East Anglia Forum was affiliated to the NDP.Walker, The National Front, p. 99 Chesterton had long hoped to merge the NF with the NDP, a party that he believed contained less of a loutish element than his own NF, and he felt that O'Brien's appointment as NF chairman would hasten this aim due to O'Brien's good standing with NDP activists.Walker, The National Front, p. 100 The party had held informal discussions with the NF about a merger in early 1970, although these came to nothing as the NF fell into upheaval resulting in the removal of Chesterton from the leadership. The issue came back on the agenda with O'Brien as NF leader and certainly the two groups grew closer and the NDP was persuaded to withdraw its proposed candidate from the St Marylebone by-election in 1970 and instead campaign on behalf of the NF's Malcolm Skeggs. A merger was discussed and O'Brien presented such a proposal to the NF Directorate but they refused to endorse the idea.Walker, The National Front, p. 101 Nonetheless the two groups were able to continue with a closer working relationship and in 1971 leading NDP member Eddie Bray even brought a coachload of party members to Bristol where they joined an NF march in the city. The relationship was not always beneficial, however, such as when the important Manchester branch left en bloc, under the direction of organiser Walter Barton, to join the NF after a particularly rousing speech by O'Brien.Walker, The National Front, pp. 102-103 In May 1971 Eddie Bray stood as a candidate in the Southampton Itchen by-election. In the seat where the party had performed well in the previous general election the NDP once again made a good showing with Bray winning over 7.5% of the vote and finishing ahead of the Liberal Party candidate.Southampton Itchen by-election Final years The NDP was weakened when O'Brien left the NF and joined the National Independence Party rather than bringing his followers back to the NDP. O'Brien left the NF because of John Tyndall and Martin Webster's neo-Nazi links Martin Walker, The National Front, Glasgow: Fontana Collins, 1977, pages 106-107. The party tried to carry on but it became less and less significant. The emergence of other outlets for the populist tendency of the far right, such as the National Party, meant that support for the NDP disappeared. Towards the end of its life the NDP attempted to forge links with rightist groups associated with the Conservative Party such as the Conservative Monday Club and the Anglo-Rhodesia Society, although the party was gone by the late 1970s. Around this time future Tory MP Piers Merchant was a member of the party.Peter Barberis, John McHugh, Mike Tyldesley, Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations, 2002, p. 186 The NDP was not connected to the National Democrats, which was an attempt by the NF to change its name. This resulted in a split in the NF. Election resultsHouse of Commons= { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" ! Election year ! # of total votes ! % of overall vote ! # of seats won !

As one of the leaders of the Fighting Organisation of the Socialist Revolutionary Party, he became involved in the assassinations of several high-ranking imperial officials in 1904 and 1905. After the February Revolution of 1917, he became Assistant War Minister (in office from July to August 1917) in the Provisional Government. After the October Revolution of the same year he organized armed resistance against the ruling Bolsheviks. Savinkov emigrated from Soviet Russia in 1920, but in 1924 the OGPU lured him back to the Soviet Union and arrested him. He was either killed in prison or committed suicide. Young years Savinkov was born in Kharkov (Kharkiv), the son of a judge in Warsaw. In 1897 he entered the law department of St. Petersburg University but was expelled in 1899 because of participation in students' riots. Later he studied in Berlin and Heidelberg. From 1898 he was a member of various socialist organizations. In 1901 he was arrested and sent to exile to Vologda. He served the exile with some prominent Russian intellectuals including Nikolai Berdyaev and Anatoly Lunacharsky. However, he became disappointed with Marxism and shifted to terrorism. In 1903 Savinkov escaped abroad and joined the Socialist Revolutionary Party, where he soon became Deputy Head of its Combat Organization under Yevno Azef. Socialist Revolutionary Party In 1906, he was arrested and sentenced to death for his assassination of Vyacheslav von Plehve, the Russian Minister of Interior, and participation in the assassination of Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich of Russia. However, he escaped from his prison cell in Odessa and exiled himself to avoid recapture. When Azef was revealed as an agent of the Okhrana in 1908, Savinkov was appointed leader of the Fighting Organization, but by now was not strong enough to conduct any serious operations. While in France Savinkov volunteered in the French Army during World War I. In April 1917, several months after the February Revolution, he returned to Russia, and in July became Deputy War Minister under Alexander Kerensky. On 30 August, however, he resigned from his post and was expelled from the Socialist Revolutionary Party due to his role in the coup of General Lavr Kornilov.  Civil war  Savinkov remained in Russia after the October revolution and organised a new counter-revolutionary organisation called the Society for the Defence of the Motherland and Freedom, whose headquarters were at 4 Molochny Alley in Moscow, where his deputy Dr. Grigoriev maintained a medical establishment as a façade. Savinkov, a leader of the Society for Defence of Motherland and Freedom, managed the organisation of several armed uprisings against the Bolsheviks, the most notable being in Yaroslavl, Rybinsk, and Murom in July 1918. Savinkov returned to France after these uprisings were crushed by the Red Army. There, he held various posts in the Russian emigre societies and was Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak's main representative in Paris. During the Polish-Bolshevik War of 1919–1920, he moved to Poland, where he formed a Russian political organisation responsible for the formation of several infantry and cavalry units out of former Red Army POWs. Together with Merezhkovsky, he published in Warsaw a newspaper entitled «За свободу!» ('For Freedom!). Once the Polish-Bolshevik War concluded in October 1921, Polish authorities sent Savinkov out of the country in order not to cause further friction with the Soviets. Trust Operation and death Boris Savinkov in the Military Collegium of the Supreme Tribunal of the Soviet Union. 1924 He was an acquaintance of Sidney Reilly, the legendary renegade British agent, and was involved in a number of counter-revolutionary plots against the Bolsheviks, sometimes collaborating with the British Secret Intelligence Service (SIS). These efforts were effectively undermined by the Trust Operation implemented by the Soviet security agency OGPU. Savinkov was lured into the USSR to meet with false conspirators and consequently arrested. The USSR Supreme Court sentenced him to death but the Presidium of VTsIK converted the sentence to 10 years imprisonment. During his trial, Savinkov declared that he recognized the Bolsheviks and assumed his defeat. While imprisoned, he wrote satirical stories about white émigrés and was allowed to see them published in Moscow. According to the NKVD, he committed suicide by jumping from a window in the Lubyanka prison, in Moscow. However, according to modern publications by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and others, Savinkov was killed in prison by OGPU officers.

In 1921, while she worked at the dormitory, she was visited by her brother Adolf who she said appeared as if he had \\"fallen from heaven\\".Philippe Sand, \\"East West Street - On the Origins of 'Genocide' and 'Crimes Against Humanity'\\", New York, 2016 p. 96 (kepub edition) Later, she worked as a secretary. For the most part, she had no other contact with her brother during his difficult years as a painter in Vienna and later Munich, military service during World War I and early political activities back in Munich. She was delighted to meet him again in Vienna during the early 1930s.\\"The Mind of Adolf Hitler\\", Walter C. Langer, New York 1972, pp. 122–123. Paula used the surname \\"Hiedler\\", the original spelling of \\"Hitler\\". By her own account, after losing a job with a Viennese insurance company in 1930 when her employers found out who she was, Paula received financial support from her brother, lived under the assumed family name Wolff at Adolf's request (this was a childhood nickname of his which he had also used during the 1920s for security purposes), and worked sporadically. Adolf appears to have had a low opinion of her intelligence, referring to both Paula and their half-sister Angela as \\"stupid geese\\".Fritz Redlich, Hitler:Diagnosis of a Destructive Prophet, Oxford University Press, New York, 1999, p.10 She later claimed to have seen her brother about once a year during the 1930s and early 1940s. She worked as a secretary in a military hospital for much of World War II. Post-war life There is some evidence Paula shared her brother's strong German nationalist beliefs, but she was not politically active and never joined the Nazi Party. During the closing days of the war, at the age of 49, she was driven to Berchtesgaden, Germany, apparently on the orders of Martin Bormann. She was arrested by US intelligence officers in May 1945 and debriefed later that year. A transcript shows one of the agents remarking she bore a physical resemblance to her brother. She told them that the Soviets had confiscated her house in Austria, that the Americans had expropriated her Vienna apartment, and that she was taking English lessons. She characterized her childhood relationship with her brother as one of both constant bickering and strong affection. Paula said that she could not bring herself to believe that her brother had been responsible for the Holocaust. She had also told them that she had met Eva Braun only once. Paula was released from American custody and returned to Vienna, where she lived on her savings for a time, then worked in an arts and crafts shop. In 1952, she moved to Berchtesgaden in Germany, reportedly living \\"in seclusion\\" in a two-room flat as Paula Wolff. During this time, she was looked after by former members of the SS and survivors of her brother's inner circle. In February 1959, she agreed to be interviewed by Peter Morley, a documentary producer for Associated-Rediffusion, an ITV commercial station in Great Britain. The conversation was the only filmed interview she ever gave and was broadcast as part of a programme called Tyranny: The Years of Adolf Hitler. She talked mostly about Hitler's childhood and refused to be drawn on political questions. Footage from this and a contemporary interview with Peter Morley was included in the 2005 television documentary The Hitler Family (original German title Familie Hitler. Im Schatten des Diktators), directed by Oliver Halmburger and Thomas Staehler.  Death and burial  Paula died on 1 June 1960, at the age of 64, the last surviving member of Hitler's immediate family. She was buried in the Bergfriedhof in Berchtesgaden/Schönau under the name Paula Hitler. In June 2005, the wooden grave marker and remains were reportedly removed and replaced with another burial, a common practice in German cemeteries after two or more decades have elapsed. In May 2006, however, it was reported the grave marker had been returned to Paula's grave and a second marker had been added, indicating another more recent burial in the same spot.Berchtesgaden (the second burial is Cornelia Reif, 2 February 1925 – 3 June 2005).

It was re-released in 1998 on Bitzcore Records in Germany and on Get Hip Records in the US, and in 2003 on Epitaph Records in the US and Burning Heart Records in Sweden.

Music Ass Cobra featured a move towards mid-'70s punk and glam territory, in the style of the Dictators, Ramones and late the Stooges. Critical reception Patrick Kennedy of AllMusic wrote that the album \\"paves the way [for Apocalypse Dudes] harshly, with a sinister wash of cymbals, loud guitars and articulate riffs — think Poison Idea meets Alice Cooper. It is here also where Turbonegro developed their signature look: sailor caps, denim from head to toe, mustaches all around, and decidedly butch homoerotic accoutrements.

Goldfrank, \\"Recentering Nil Sorskii: The Evidence from the Sources,\\" Russian Review 66, No. 3 (2007): 359–376. The Russian Orthodox Church venerates Nil Sorsky as a saint, marking his feast day on the anniversary of his repose on May 7. Ὁ Ὅσιος Νεῖλος ἐκ Ρωσίας. 7 Μαΐου. ΜΕΓΑΣ ΣΥΝΑΞΑΡΙΣΤΗΣ. Early life Nilus of Sora, a great ascetic of the Russian Church, was descended from the Maikov nobility.\\"Repose of the Venerable Nilus the Abbot of Sora\\", Orthodox Church in America Before becoming a monk, Nil Sorsky worked as a scribe and was engaged in book copying. He also journeyed to Palestine and Greece early in his life and was acquainted there with the Hesychast movement. Later in his life, he took monastic vows at the Kirillo-Belozersky Monastery, which had been known for its hostile stance towards monastic landownership. The founder of the monastery – Saint Kirill of Beloozero – was himself known for rejecting villages that had been offered to him by devout nobles. Kirill’s followers adopted his ways and would later become known as the startsy from out the Volga with Nil Sorsky as their leader. Soon, he went on a journey to the Holy Land and visited Palestine, Constantinople, and Mount Athos, acquainting himself with a mystical doctrine of Hesychasm and reading patristic literature. Upon his return to Russia (between 1473 and 1489), Nil Sorsky founded a cloister on the Sora River (hence, Nil Sorsky, or Nil of Sora) not far from the Kirillo-Belozersky Monastery, where he would settle down with his followers. He wrote extensively.Nil Sorsky: The Complete Writings. George Maloney, ed. and trans.(Mahwah, NJ: Paulist Press, 2003). This travelling to the holy places made a great impression upon him and changed all his individuality. Solitude, isolation, oblivion of the world became the main features of his character.(in Russian)Великий старец Нил Сорский (the great elder Nilus of Sora) Retrieved on 25 Jan 2018 The Novgorod heresy affair Nil Sorsky was involved in the Novgorod heresy affair (see Sect of Skhariya the Jew for details), which had stirred a lot of minds in the Tsardom of Russia at that time.(In Russian) Русская историческая библиотека, Жидовствующие, ересь (Russian historical library, Judaize, heresy) Retrieved on 25 Jan 2018 It appears that Sorsky and his closest associate Paisiy Yaroslavov were much more tolerant towards the heretics than most of the Russian clergy, led by Gennady (Archbishop of Novgorod) and Joseph Volotsky. In 1489, Archbishop Gennady embarked on the path of fighting the heretics and asked Archbishop of Rostov to consult with the elders Nil Sorsky and Paisiy Yaroslavov (who had been living in his eparchy) and seek their assistance in this matter. Historical accounts of that period do not shed any light on the outcome of these \\"negotiations\\", but from that time on there seems to have been no interaction between Sorsky and Yaroslavov on one side and Gennady and Joseph Volotsky on the other. The two elders, however, did not treat heresy with indifference. They were both present at the Synod of 1490, which dealt with heresy, and exerted their influence upon its final decision. Initially, the clergy unanimously spoke in support of burning all the heretics at the stake. At the conclusion of the synod, however, only a few priests were condemned and then defrocked without being executed. Later in the decade, however, several heretics were burned in both Novgorod and Moscow.David M Goldfrank, \\"Burn, Baby, Burn: Popular Culture and Heresy in Late Medieval Russia,\\" The Journal of Popular Culture 31, no. 4 (1998): 17–32; Andrei Pliguzov, \\"Archbishop Gennadii and the Heresy of the 'Judaizers'\\" Harvard Ukrainian Studies 16(3/4) December 1992: 269-288; George Vernadsky, \\"The Heresy of the Judaizers and the Policies of Ivan III of Moscow,\\" Speculum, Vol. 8, No. 4 (Oct., 1933): 436-454. Teaching and influence Nil Sorsky was opposed to formality in Orthodoxy faith which were widely spread in the midst of 16th century Russia. It was so deeply crystallized in church life of that period that such persons as Maximus the Greek and the elder Artemiy, who had tried to show the deep basics of Orthodoxy, were considered as Heretics. His wish was to disclose the deep understanding of Orthodoxy devoting more attention to spiritual life of a soul rather than to religious rituals. He was not a bookworm but a speculator-philosopher or speculator-theorist and an uncommon spiritual freedom marked his personality. The whole life of a person - the path of incessant self-perfection and self-improvement - is based on the Holy Gospel. And the Elder showed a lot of psychological understanding of the spiritual struggle and outlined clear ways of \\"graceful struggle\\". He deeply believed that moral, inner, spiritual perfection was the ideal foundation of the active, productive life of the believer. In his teachings, he developed mystical and ascetical ideas along the lines of Gregory Sinaite's hesychasm, asking the believers to concentrate on their inner world and personal emotional experiences of faith as means for achieving unity with God. Nil Sorsky demanded that monks participate in productive labor and spoke in support of monastic reforms on a basis of a secluded and modest lifestyle. Nil Sorsky dedicated his efforts towards fighting against monastic landownership rights at the Synod of 1503 in Moscow. There, he raised a question about monastic estates, which comprised about one third of the territory of the whole Russian state at that time and which, in his view, had been responsible for demoralization of the Russian monastic communities. Nil Sorsky was supported by the elders of the Kirillo-Belozersky Monastery and his disciple Vassian Patrikeyev. Although he spoke in favor of Ivan III’s policy of secularization of monastic lands,Prokurat, Michael. \\"Joseph of Volokolamsk, St.\\", Encyclopedia of Monasticism, (William M. Johnston, ed.), Routledge, 2013, Sorsky did not live long enough to see the end of this struggle. Patrikeyev and Artemius of the Trinity were Nil Sorsky’s successors.

Blackwater can contain feces, urine, semen, water and toilet paper from flush toilets. Blackwater is distinguished from greywater, which comes from sinks, baths, washing machines, and other kitchen appliances apart from toilets. Greywater results from washing food, clothing, dishes, as well as from showering or bathing. Blackwater and greywater are separated in \\"ecological buildings\\", such as autonomous buildings. Recreational vehicles often have separate holding tanks for greywater from showers and sinks, and blackwater from the toilet. Definition According to one source: Water coming from domestic equipment other than toilets (e.g., bathtubs, showers, sinks, washing machines) is called greywater. In some sanitation systems, it is preferred to keep the greywater separate from blackwater to reduce the amount of water that gets heavily polluted and to simplify treatment methods for the greywater.  Terminology  Blackwater is a term dating to at least the 1970s.US Patent 3915857, issued in October 1975 In Hong Kong regional usage, an alternative term for blackwater is \\"soil water\\".Drainage - Designing Buildings Wiki Treatment processes Blackwater contains pathogens that must decompose before they can be released safely into the environment. It is difficult to process blackwater if it contains a large quantity of excess water, or if it must be processed quickly, because of the high concentrations of organic material. = Composting = However, if blackwater does not contain excess water, or if it receives primary treatment to de-water, then it is easily processed through composting. The heat produced by naturally occurring thermophilic microorganisms will heat the compost to over , and destroy potential pathogens. Blackwater generation can be avoided by making use of composting toilets and vermifilter toilets. In certain autonomous buildings, such as earthships, this is almost always present and allows the water requirements of the building (which, with earthships, are self-generated) to be heavily reduced. Besides saving water, composting toilets allow the user to reuse the nutrients found therein (e.g., for growing crops/trees).

Young (director). Robert William Young (born 16 March 1933) is a British television and film director. Young was born in Cheltenham, and in the 1980s and early 1990s, established himself as a leading director of British TV drama. In the 1970s, he directed Vampire Circus (1972), Soldier's Home (1977) and Hammer House of Horror. He directed several episodes of Minder and Bergerac in the early 1980s, and the acclaimed TV serial The Mad Death which centred on a rabies outbreak. Perhaps his best remembered television work was on Robin of Sherwood, for which he directed many of the best-regarded episodes. Young moved towards black comedy in the early 1990s, directing Jeeves and Wooster based on the stories written by P.G. Wodehouse, and G.B.H., for which he was nominated for a BAFTA award. It was partly on the strength of GBH that he was assigned to direct Fierce Creatures, John Cleese's 1997 follow-up to A Fish Called Wanda, which featured many of the same cast as GBH. However, the production ran into problems and Fred Schepisi was brought in to finalise the movie. Young did, however, direct Splitting Heirs, which starred Cleese and Eric Idle. Young has continued to work on television drama since then.

In 2000, he founded Zoonami, a video game development company based in Cambridge. Early life Martin Hollis grew up playing BBC Micro video games such as Chuckie Egg and Elite. He also used to develop his own games for the system, including a Pac-Man clone and a similar Easter- themed one \\"with rabbits going around the maze.\\" Before turning 16, he ended up creating between 20 and 40 BBC Micro games, some of which were published in magazines. Career Martin Hollis studied computer science at the University of Cambridge. He first worked in a small engineering company for a year, developing tools for tracking boats and submarines. In December 1993, when he was 22 years old, he applied for a job at Rare and became the company's first computer science graduate. Due to his knowledge of Unix, he was tasked with setting up the networks of the expensive Silicon Graphics systems Rare had recently acquired at the time. He then worked as a second programmer on the coin-op version of Killer Instinct with Rare's technical director Chris Stamper, who designed the hardware. Hollis programmed the machine's operating system. Both Stamper and Hollis also went to Silicon Graphics in Mountain View, California, where they got the chance to write and test code that would run on the first chips of the then-upcoming Nintendo 64 console. Panel at 2005 game event in Cambridge. From left to right: Aleks Krotoski, David Braben, Martin Hollis, Alice Taylor. After his work on Killer Instinct, Hollis was interested in leading a team to produce a Nintendo 64 video game based on the 1995 James Bond film GoldenEye, an idea that had been proposed to Rare at the highest level. The resulting game, GoldenEye 007, was inspired by Virtua Cop and released in 1997 to considerable critical and commercial success. Hollis remarked that he worked non-stop on the game, \\"[averaging] an 80 hour week over the 2 and a half years of the project\\", and that the team he recruited was very talented and dedicated even though most of it was composed of people who had never worked on video games. GoldenEye 007 designer Duncan Botwood described both Hollis and programmer Mark Edmonds, who created the GoldenEye 007 engine, as some of the smartest people he has ever known. Hollis and his team were then offered to produce a game based on the GoldenEye sequel Tomorrow Never Dies, but they turned it down without hesitation. He explained that they were all \\"pretty sick\\" of the James Bond universe by the time GoldenEye 007 was released, and that their next game needed to be different enough for him to be interesting. In late 1998, after becoming head of software at Rare and having worked for 14 months on Perfect Dark, a spiritual successor to GoldenEye 007, he left the company, partially because he wanted to pursue other interests and did not want to renew another four-year contract with Rare. Although Perfect Dark was released 18 months later, his contributions to the game were significant and the game's protagonist, Joanna Dark, was his creation. After leaving Rare, Hollis took some time off and spent six months in Southeast Asia. According to him, \\"I couldn't see myself staying in Twycross [the small village where Rare is based]. I wanted to see more of the world—wanderlust I suppose.\\" Following a recommendation by Chris Stamper, Hollis then worked as a consultant on the development of the GameCube at Nintendo of America in Redmond, Washington. One of his responsibilities was to ensure that the GameCube hardware was game developer friendly. In 2000, he founded Zoonami, a video game development company based in Cambridge. The company's philosophy was to conceive innovative ideas and develop them further. At Zoonami, he worked on Zendoku, a Sudoku-based game released in 2007, and on Bonsai Barber, a hairdressing game released in 2009. Hollis is a regular contributor to the GameCity event in Nottingham, where he talks about the cultural importance of video games.

Folklore elements figure heavily in his subject matter and his style is reminiscent of Primitivism. His twin brother, Paul, also became a well-known painter.  Biography  He and his brother spent their early years in Meriküla, where their father was a field ranger. After his early death, they were enrolled at the Parish school in Rakvere, where they were taught in German. Later, he went to the teacher's college in Tartu, and taught in the local schools there for several years. In 1892, dissatisfied with his career, he moved to Saint Petersburg, where his drawings came to the attention of Johann Köler. He thought that Raud had some potential and advised him to enroll at the Imperial Academy of Arts. Four years later, after completing his studies, he went to Germany to polish his skills; spending time in Düsseldorf with Peter Janssen, then moving on to Munich, where he took private lessons from Anton Ažbe and classes at the Academy of Fine Arts.Brief biography and appreciation @ Eesti Kunst. Kalev Proposes Marriage, from the Kalevipoeg When he returned to Tartu, he organized a school for young artists, wrote articles for the local newspapers, and taught at the gymnasium. After the death of Jakob Hurt in 1907, he became an advocate for the establishment of a museum devoted to folklore. Two years later, he became one of the founders and organizers of the Estonian National Museum. The following year, he provided illustrations for the collected poems of Juhan Liiv. At the beginning of World War I, he moved to Tallinn to live with his brother. Once again, he became a teacher while continuing to paint. In 1919, he completed The Maiden of the Grave, was elected Chairman of the Estonian Museum Society and began working for the Ministry of Education. The high point of his career came in 1935, when the Estonian Literary Society issued a new edition of Kalevipoeg, the Estonian national epic, with his paintings as illustrations. The first printing ran to 10,000 copies; a very large number at the time. In 1938, he was awarded the Order of the Estonian Red Cross. His commitment to painting was such that, even on his death bed in the hospital, he continued to paint. He died during the German occupation so, despite his fame, his funeral was very modest. In the Spring of 1940, shortly before the Soviet occupation, a major exhibition of his works was held and the government declared it to be \\"Kristjan Raud Year\\".\\"Kristjan Raud, the Last National Romantic Artist of the Nordic Countries\\" by Juta Kivimee @ the Estonian Institute. A monument to him was erected under the Soviet government in 1969. Four years later, the \\"Kristjan Raud Art Award\\" () was established by the Estonian Artists' Association in conjunction with the city of Tallinn. As of 2012, the prize was worth 2,240 Euros. From 1992 to 2011, when Estonia adopted the Euro, Raud's likeness was on the one kroon banknote.

However, as well as maintaining those provided by other manufacturers, it built one locomotive. Locomotive production The railway's engineer James McConnell obtained the directors' permission in March 1844 to build a new locomotive for the Lickey Incline. This followed a series of accidents on the incline. One involved a demonstration locomotive by William Church, called, unfortunately \\"Surprise\\". Its experimental boiler blew up, killing the enginemen, Thomas Scaife and Joseph Rutherford. Their decorative monuments are in St. Johns churchyard Bromsgrove (and have been restored in 2014), though the depiction of a locomotive on the tombstone is of one of the Norris Locomotives. Then a further boiler explosion on another loco killed William Creuze. The company had been using American Norris s, which in fact lasted until 1856. The Americans made much of the fact that they were showing the British how to build engines, but they were expensive to import. Edward Bury had tried one of his London and Birmingham Railway engines in 1841 but its performance up the bank was less successful than that of an American engine because of the latter's undisclosed but much higher boiler pressure. Another locomotive that had been tried was Ysabel a built by Isaac Dodds. McConnell carried out a number of innovations, culminating in his locomotive built at Bromsgrove specifically for the incline, the \\"Great Britain\\", reputed to be the first saddle tank. It was completed in June 1845. It was a six-coupled loco, weighing 30 tonnes, with outside cylinders and an oval boiler. Initially number 38, it was later renumbered 276, then rebuilt as a well tank in 1853, renumbered again as 300 and withdrawn in October 1861. McConnell continued to seek higher standards in railway engineering. In 1846 he met with George Stephenson and Archibald Slate at Bromsgrove. It was at this meeting that the idea of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers came about. In March 1847 McConnell transferred to the London and North Western Railway as superintendent of its southern headquarters at Wolverton. Later history The works built only one locomotive and after the merger with the Midland Railway, such work was concentrated at Derby. However it became a well- respected wagon works, using components from Derby, apart from laminated springs which it fabricated itself. It became part of the LMS and, during World War II the Works Manager initiated a scheme for recovering timber and metal fittings for re-use as spares. After nationalisation in 1949 it remained busy with one of the highest productivity rates, but following a reorganisation of railway workshops, it closed in 1964, with the work being transferred to Derby.

Artistic merit is the artistic quality or value of any given work of art, music, film, literature, sculpture or painting. Is the measurement of one's ability Obscenity and literary merit The 1921 US trial of James Joyce's novel Ulysses concerned the publication of the Nausicaa episode by the literary magazine The Little Review, which was serializing the novel. Though not required to do so by law, John Quinn, the lawyer for the defence, decided to produce three literary experts to attest to the literary merits of Ulysses, as well as The Little Review’s broader reputation. The first expert witness was Philip Moeller, of the Theatre Guild, who interpreted Ulysses using the Freudian method of unveiling the subconscious mind, which prompted one of the judges to ask him to \\"speak in a language that the court could understand\\". The next witness was Scofield Thayer, editor of The Dial, another literary magazine of the time, who \\"was forced to admit that if he had had the desire to publish Ulysses he would have consulted a lawyer first—and not published it\\". The final witness was English novelist, lecturer, and critic John Cowper Powys, who declared that Ulysses was a \\"beautiful piece of work in no way capable of corrupting the minds of young girls\\". The editors were found guilty under laws associated with the Comstock Act of 1873, which made it illegal to circulate materials deemed obscene in the U.S. mail, incurred a $100 fine, and were forced to cease publishing Ulysses in The Little Review. It was not until the 1933 case United States v. One Book Called Ulysses that the novel could be published in the United States without fear of prosecution. Another important obscenity trial occurred 1960 in Britain, when the full unexpurgated edition of D. H. Lawrence's Lady Chatterley's Lover was published by Penguin Books. The trial of Penguin under the Obscene Publications Act 1959 was a major public event and a test of the new obscenity law. The 1959 act (introduced by Roy Jenkins) had made it possible for publishers to escape conviction if they could show that a work was of literary merit. Several academic critics and experts of diverse kinds, including E. M. Forster, Helen Gardner, Richard Hoggart, Raymond Williams, Norman St John-Stevas and Dr John Robinson, Anglican bishop of Woolwich, were called as witnesses for the defence, and the verdict, delivered on 2 November 1960, was \\"not guilty\\".Feather, John.

Description thumb Growing to tall, it is an evergreen shrub. The young stems are green, with the shoots and leaves modified into green spines, long. Young seedlings produce normal leaves for the first few months; these are trifoliate, resembling a small clover leaf. The solitary flowers are yellow, long, with the pea-flower structure typical of the Fabaceae; they are produced throughout the year, but mainly over a long period in spring. They are coconut-scented. The fruit is a legume (pod) long, dark purplish-brown, partly enclosed by the pale brown remnants of the flower; the pod contains 2–3 small blackish, shiny, hard seeds, which are ejected when the pod splits open in hot weather. Seeds remain viable for 30 years. Like many species of gorse, it is often a fire-climax plant, which readily catches fire but re-grows from the roots after the fire; the seeds are also adapted to germinate after slight scorching by fire. It has a tap root, lateral and adventious roots. An extremely tough and hardy plant, it survives temperatures down to . It can live for about thirty years. Invasive species The species has been introduced to other areas of Europe, and also to the Americas, New Zealand, South Africa, and Australia, where it is often considered a weed and is a serious problem invasive species in some areas (notably the western United States, Chile and New Zealand). It was introduced to New Zealand from Scotland as a type of hedge, but became a major blight to farmers as the climate suited its growth better than its native habitat and many of its natural predators were absent. Common gorse is also an invasive species in the montane grasslands of Horton Plains National Park in Sri Lanka. It outcompetes native, endemic species and is a fire hazard.Lalith Gunasekera, Invasive Plants: A guide to the identification of the most invasive plants of Sri Lanka, Colombo 2009, p. 88–89. Biological pest control is used on this plant in many areas. The gorse spider mite (Tetranychus lintearius) and the gorse seed weevil (Exapion ulicis) reduce the spread of the plant. Cultivation This plant is used for hedging, boundary definition and groundcover in suitably sunny, open locations. Cultivars include 'Strictus' (Irish gorse), a dwarf form, and the double-flowered, non-fruiting 'Flore Pleno', which has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Other uses Bruised gorse was used in some areas for feeding to horses and other livestock.Aiton, William (1811).

He was a minor when his father died, but the date of his accession cannot be determined. It seems probable that it must have taken place well before 240 BC, as Memnon tells us that he was a child at his father's death, and he had a daughter of marriageable age in 222 BC. Shortly after his accession, his kingdom was invaded by the Gauls, who were eventually repulsed. After Mithridates attained manhood, he married Laodice, a sister of Antiochus Hierax and Seleucus II Callinicus, with whom he is said to have received the province of Phrygia as a dowry. The political context of Mithridates II's marriage: In 145 BCE Antiochus Hierax, supported by his mother Laodice I who held influence in AnatoliaJustin, Epitome of the Phillipic History of Pompeius Trogus, XXVII, demands the possession of Anatolia (Asia Minor) from his brother Seleucus II Callinicus and quickly declares his independence in order to expand his territory and his authority. Seleucus, struggling against the Ptolemaic forces in the south, has no choice but to tolerate. Mithridates II fought with his mother-in-law and Hierax and their allies, against his other brother-in-law Seleucus during a war between Seleucus and Antiochus Hierax. Eventually, Mithridates defeated Seleucus in a great battle at Ancyra in 235 BC whereby Seleucus lost twenty thousand of his troops and narrowly escaped with his own life. Hierax died in 226 BCE. In 222 BCE, Mithridates II gave his daughter Laodice in marriage to the Seleucid king Antiochus III. Another of his daughters, also named Laodice, was married about the same time to Achaeus, the cousin of Antiochus. In 220 BC, Mithridates declared war upon the wealthy and powerful city of Sinope. However, he was unable to weaken it and the city did not come under the control of the kings of Pontus until 183 BC. Earlier in his rule, Mithridates II vied with the other monarchs of Asia in sending magnificent presents to the Rhodians, after the destruction of their city by an earthquake in 227 BC. The date of his death is unknown. He was succeeded by Mithridates III, his son with Laodice. NotesReferences *Hazel, John.

The work tells a story of romance backstage at a long-running musical: assistant stage manager Larry woos chorus girl Jeanie behind the back of her electrician boyfriend, Bob. Me and Juliet premiered in 1953 and was considered a modest success — it ran for much of a year on Broadway and had a limited run in Chicago (altogether nearly 500 performances), and returned a small profit to its backers.Bill Hayes Autobiography Like Sands Through the Hourglass 2005 Rodgers had long wanted to write a musical comedy about the cast and crew backstage at a theatre. After Rodgers and Hammerstein had another hit with The King and I in 1951, Rodgers proposed the backstage project to his partner. Hammerstein was unenthusiastic, thinking the subject matter trivial, but agreed to do the project. The play required complex machinery, designed by Jo Mielziner, so that the audience could view action not only on the stage of the theatre where the show-within-the-show (also named Me and Juliet) takes place, but in the wings and on the light bridge (high above the stage, from which the lighting technicians train spotlights) as well. When Me and Juliet began tryout performances in Cleveland, the duo realized the show had problems with plot and staging. Extensive revisions during the remaining Cleveland and Boston tryouts failed to fix the difficulties with the plot, which the critics considered weak and uninteresting. The show was met with poor reviews, though Mielziner's staging won praise from audience and critics. The show closed once it had exhausted its advance sales. Bill Hayes, the show's star, states in his autobiography Like Sands Through the Hourglass (2005): \\"We played nearly five hundred performances, all to full houses. Production costs were paid off and substantial profits went into the R&H; till. So, though not in the same category as the storied five that were made into films - Oklahoma!, Carousel, South Pacific, The King and I and The Sound of Music - our show must be considered a success\\". With the exception of a short run in Chicago, there was no national tour, and the show has seldom been seen. A small-scale production was presented by London's Finborough Theatre in 2010.  Inception  Oscar Hammerstein II The origins of Me and Juliet can be traced to the early days of the relationship between Rodgers and Hammerstein. The musical Oklahoma! opened in 1943; it was Rodgers and Hammerstein's first work together and a massive hit. Soon after Oklahoma! opened, Rodgers began considering the idea of a musical set backstage at a theatre staging a musical. The production could explore different areas of the backstage world. Rodgers also saw it as the opportunity to write a pure musical comedy, without the serious themes which had marked their early works—such as the attacks on racism in South Pacific, and the cultural tolerance in The King and I. Hammerstein was initially unenthusiastic, thinking the subject matter trivial, but Rodgers pressed the matter. It was Hammerstein's turn to give in to his partner; Rodgers had agreed to the project that became the 1947 musical Allegro, their initial failure, under pressure from Hammerstein, who had long dreamed of doing a serious musical about an ordinary man. According to Stephen Sondheim, a protégé of Hammerstein, \\"Oscar was able to keep the partnership together by taking Dick's suggestion [for a backstage musical], which he did not want to take.\\" As the two discussed the backstage idea, Hammerstein became more enthusiastic, suggesting that the show start with the stage entirely bare, as if the audience had come in not at performance time but at another time during the day. Such effects are today well known following the success of other \\"backstagers\\" such as A Chorus Line; in the early 1950s they were unrealized and novel. The two discussed the matter at a meeting in early 1952 in Palm Beach, Florida, where Rodgers was vacationing as he worked on melodic sketches for the television documentary Victory at Sea. Rodgers suggested dispensing with the overture, reserving that for the overture of the show-within-the- show. Following another meeting in mid-1952, they called in long-time Rodgers and Hammerstein stage designer Jo Mielziner and hired him to design the sets. Mielziner confirmed that a scene could be played part onstage and part in the backstage world, but that this would be expensive. In August 1952, Hammerstein began a sketch of the plot; by early October he had a near-complete first draft. As the show was to be musical comedy, the pair hired one of the top musical comedy directors, George Abbott, who accepted the position without reading the script. He regretted the haste of this decision as soon as he read the script, finding it sentimental and melodramatic. He confided his concerns to the pair; in response, Hammerstein told him to make whatever changes in the script he thought best. With Hammerstein's permission, Abbott made major changes to the plot. Hammerstein had only briefly described the show-within- the-show. Fearing the show would be uninteresting, Abbott hoped that some highlights would be furnished when the show-within-the-show, as yet only briefly described by Hammerstein, was fleshed out. According to author and composer Ethan Mordden in his book about the duo's works, Hammerstein thought the show-within-the-show was to be: Hammerstein included an incident he had seen when he was a neophyte assistant stage manager: a chorus boy came up to a chorus girl and asked to use some of her mascara—to disguise a hole in the boy's black socks. Hammerstein stated, \\"we were religious in keeping away from the trite things—the kindly old stage door man named Pop, the pretty little understudy who replaces the star on opening night. We steered clear, too, of the backstage story of a company putting on a new show, with all the anxieties of the actors and producers ... It seemed right to focus on a show which is already running because we wanted to tell a story about a community, the backstage community, and this community becomes settled and established after a show opens.\\" In addition to Abbott, the duo recruited other professionals experienced in musical comedy. Choreographer Robert Alton had worked in such hits as Panama Hattie and in movie musicals. Don Walker was hired to do the orchestrations; his would be simpler than those of Robert Russell Bennett, who usually performed that function in the pair's musicals but who was not available. Irene Sharaff was engaged to design the more than 300 costumes which would be needed. The show was originally named Hercules and Juliet, but they soon changed it to Me and Juliet. The Majestic Theatre, which Rodgers and Hammerstein desired to have for Me and Juliet, was currently occupied by their South Pacific, four years into its run. Arrangements were made to shift South Pacific to the Broadway Theatre though, due to schedule conflicts, this meant moving that show to Boston for five weeks.  Plot  : For theatrical terminology, see Stage (theatre). The entire action of the show takes place in and close to a Broadway theatre in which the long-running musical Me and Juliet (the \\"show-within-the-show\\") is playing. The setting is the early 1950s. = Act 1 = A half-hour remains before the show is to begin. Electrician Sidney and chorus girl Jeanie are irritated at Sidney's fellow electrician, Bob, for not being there. Sidney needs Bob's help; Jeanie, Bob's girlfriend, is annoyed at being stood up. Sidney warns Jeanie that Bob may not be the right man for her; these are doubts she has too (Musical numbers: \\"A Very Special Day\\"/\\"That's the Way it Happens\\"). Jeanie leaves, and Bob appears. Bob tells Sidney he likes dating Jeanie, but does not plan to marry her. When Sidney jokes that Jeanie can do better than Bob, the larger man momentarily chokes him. Jeanie sees this, adding to her doubts about Bob. Larry, the assistant stage manager, is also attracted to Jeanie (reprise of \\"That's the Way it Happens\\"). George S. Irving, as Dario the conductor Stage manager Mac sees to the final preparations, and the overture to the internal show is played by the orchestra, led by Dario, the conductor (\\"Overture to Me and Juliet\\"). The internal show's curtain rises (\\"Marriage Type Love\\"): the main male character, \\"Me\\" (performed by Charlie, a singer), tells the audience about the girl he wants to marry, Juliet (Lily, a singer). He also tells the audience of the girl he is determined not to marry, Carmen, who scares him. \\"Me\\" feels Carmen (the lead female dancing role) is better suited to his boss, Don Juan (the lead male dancer). As the internal show continues, Bob and Sidney are on the light bridge. Bob identifies with Don Juan for his reluctance to marry (\\"Keep It Gay\\"). Another day at Me and Juliet, and the dancers are practicing under Mac's supervision (conclusion of \\"Keep It Gay\\"). At Larry's urging, Jeanie decides to audition for the position of second understudy for the role of Juliet. On learning this, Mac takes Larry aside and warns him never to get involved with a cast member of a show while in charge of it. No sooner has Mac said this than his girlfriend Betty (currently in the show across the street) auditions for the role of Carmen. The producer gives her the role. As Larry looks on with amusement, Mac accepts this professionally, then stamps off in disgust. Bill Hayes (as Larry) and Mark Dawson (Bob) exchange hostile stares as Edwin Phillips (Sidney) looks on. From the original production. Jeanie practices for her own audition (\\"No Other Love\\"), and Larry tells her that the audience will accept her if she's \\"a real kid\\" like Juliet, but reject her if she's a \\"phony\\" (\\"The Big Black Giant\\"). Larry desires a romance with Jeannie, but fears the larger and stronger Bob. Several months pass, during which Jeanie gets the job as second understudy. Larry and Jeanie are meeting secretly and keeping their budding romance from Bob. The rest of the cast is aware of their dates—one dancer spotted them in a chili restaurant on Eighth Avenue. Mac, true to his principles, has dumped Betty, but the two are still attracted to each other. Betty enjoys acting (\\"It's Me\\"). As she performs in the internal show, Bob and Sidney are on the light bridge again. Bob has been fooled by Jeanie's lies about why they are not going out, and is enlightened when Sidney lets slip that Larry and Jeanie are seeing each other. Bob demands proof, and Sidney tells Bob to watch what happens in the wings during the upcoming Act 1 finale to Me and Juliet. Bob sees Larry and Jeanie kiss after she comes offstage with a tray of flowers, an action caught by Bob's spotlight. Mac enters, grasps the situation, sends Larry away, then puts the tray back in Jeanie's hands and pushes her onstage. She is pursued by Bob's spotlight, which relentlessly follows her around the stage as more and more of the dancers become aware something has gone badly wrong. Bob drops a sandbag from the light bridge; it knocks the tray Jeanie is holding to the ground. Mac orders the curtain lowered in front of a stage in panic. = Act 2 = Dance scene from the show-within-the-show. Original production, 1953. In the downstairs lounge, a few minutes before the Act 2 curtain for Me and Juliet rises, the ushers comment on the remarkable conclusion to Act 1—although the audience has noticed nothing unusual (\\"Intermission Talk\\"). As Act 2 of the internal show starts, an enraged Bob is searching the theatre for Jeannie and Larry. Unable to find them, he takes up position at a bar across the street where he can watch the theatre doors (\\"It Feels Good\\"). The perspective shifts to the onstage action in Me and Juliet, where Don Juan and Carmen are on a date (\\"We Deserve Each Other\\"), before moving to the manager's office where Larry and Jeanie are hiding out (\\"I'm Your Girl\\"). Mac has only just begun his lecture to them when Bob enters through the window, having heard familiar voices. In the ensuing fight, Bob knocks out Mac, but when the electrician grabs for Jeannie, Larry strongly defends her. The fight ends when Bob accidentally hits his head on a radiator and is knocked out as well. Ruby, the company manager, sends Larry and Jeannie down to the stage to continue the play. After Bob and Mac recover, Ruby informs Bob that Larry and Jeanie had secretly married earlier that day, and the surprised electrician leaves. Mac, fearful of more mayhem, goes in search of him. As Mac exits, the phone rings, and Ruby takes the call. It is the producer, calling for Mac to transfer him to another show, thereby setting him free to resume his romance with Betty. Onstage, Me and Juliet is concluding. After the internal show finishes (\\"Finale to Me and Juliet\\"), Larry, who will be the new stage manager, insists on rehearsing a scene from the show. Seeing Bob enter with a scowl, Larry orders him and Sidney to be present the next morning to re-angle the lights. Taken aback, and rather sheepishly, Bob says \\"I didn't know you were married\\" before quietly leaving, after stating, \\"I'll be here, I guess.\\" Jeanie is congratulated by her showmates, but Larry, all business, waves them to their places to rehearse the scene. As Lily has had to leave, Jeanie stands in for her as Juliet, while Larry sings the part of Me in the scene, as the curtain falls (\\"Finale of Our Play\\").  Rehearsals and tryouts  The cast consisted mostly of unknowns, though Isabel Bigley, who had just originated Sister Sarah Brown in Guys and Dolls, was given the leading role of chorus girl Jeanie. For Larry, the assistant stage manager who falls in love with Jeanie, they cast Bill Hayes, a well-known stage and television actor. William Tabbert, the original Lt. Joe Cable in South Pacific was considered for the part of Larry, but lost out because he was thought to be too tall to be afraid of Mark Dawson, hired as the towering bully Bob. Richard Rodgers Chorus auditions began March 10, 1953 at Broadway's Majestic Theatre; Rodgers, Hammerstein, and Abbott listened to more than 1,000 people. Rehearsals opened at the Majestic for principals and the Alvin Theatre for dancers. According to Saul Pett, a freelance reporter who was allowed to observe the rehearsals, \\"everyone seems relaxed except Hammerstein.\\" The lyricist's son James served as second assistant stage manager. James Hammerstein remembered having a difficult relationship with Rodgers; the composer suggested James do his work from front of house, rather than from backstage. \\"I think he thought it was his show and his bailiwick. Why should a Hammerstein be back there?\\" James Hammerstein found the lead female dancer attractive, and asked her out. Just before the date, Rodgers fired her, telling James Hammerstein to break the news. Pett recorded the technical problems which had to be solved to accomplish the complex staging: During the rehearsals, the duo took out two production numbers, \\"Wake Up, Little Theatre\\" and \\"Dance\\", concerned that the show was running long. The actress playing Juliet in the internal play proved to be a fine singer but a poor actress; she was replaced by Helena Scott. Abbott had few negative comments after the final New York run-through, and the company entrained for Cleveland, site of the first tryouts, in high spirits, sleeping little on the train ride. RCA Records put up the $350,000 cost of the production in exchange for a fifty-percent interest and rights to the original cast recording. The tryouts in Cleveland were at the Hanna Theatre. The dress rehearsal the night before the initial performance revealed a number of problems with the show; during the first act alone, Hammerstein dictated eight pages of notes. The sandbag which falls from the light bridge near the end of Act 1 dropped off-cue, nearly striking Isabel Bigley, who played Jeanie. Pett remembered that the rehearsal was stopped often, as Rodgers sought to work out each problem as it arose, and the rehearsal, which began at 8 p.m. lasted until 2 a.m. The Cleveland premiere on the evening of April 20, 1953 saw a distinguished crowd turn out. When the stage backdrop failed to come down on time, Hammerstein was heard to mutter, \\"Damn and damn and damn! This is a new way: they saved it for the performance!\\" Nevertheless, the crowd gave the show a rousing welcome. The Cleveland critics thought well of the show, but were concerned about the weak story. After the Cleveland reactions and problems, according to Rodgers biographer Meryle Secrest, \\"what had seemed to be a show needing minor adjustments became a musical in serious trouble\\". Bigley remembered that she had just come from a hit and \\"there just wasn't the same energy\\". Hammerstein had intended to omit the overture, with the audience to watch, after the curtain rose, a blank stage on which the play-within-the-play performers and crew drifted in and began their preparations. Expecting the orchestra to begin the evening, the audience talked throughout the initial scenes before being quieted by the internal show's overture; in response, the duo abandoned Hammerstein's concept and opened with an overture. In contrast to the levity on their first train ride, the company was downcast and exhausted en route from Cleveland to Boston for the final tryouts. The show opened previews in Boston on May 6. A majority of the Boston critics liked the show, and expressed confidence that Rodgers and Hammerstein could fix the problems with the plot. The pair took out one song, \\"Meat and Potatoes\\", which was felt to be too raunchy. After watching it performed by Joan McCracken, who played Betty (Carmen in the play-within-the-play), the pair decided it had too many double entendres and cut it. It was replaced by \\"We Deserve Each Other\\", which the pair had written in a Cleveland hotel room. Another cut song, \\"You Never Had It So Good\\", included lyrics which satirized the duo's own earlier efforts. Its lyrics, \\"I'll sew, I'll bake / I'll try to make your evenings all enchanted. / My honeycake, / I'm yours to take, but don't take me for granted\\", alluded to two songs from South Pacific, \\"Some Enchanted Evening\\" and \\"Honey Bun\\". Audiences continued to greet the show warmly. During the Boston previews, the duo heard the audience praise the sets, a reaction which usually augured ill for the show itself. Hammerstein wrote to The King and I director John van Druten:  Production  First credits from Me and Juliet 's playbill The musical opened on Broadway on May 28, 1953 at the Majestic Theatre. Large advance sales guaranteed a considerable run; by the start of November, it had paid back its advance, and closed after 358 performances, paying a small profit to RCA. Thomas Hischak, in his The Rodgers and Hammerstein Encyclopedia, suggests that business fell off after the advance sales were exhausted \\"because audiences had come to expect more from a Rodgers and Hammerstein musical\\". According to Frederick W. Nolan in his book about the duo's works, \\"despite a $500,000 advance sale, despite a ten-month run (which, for anyone except Rodgers and Hammerstein, would have represented a major success), and despite an eventual profit in excess of $100,000, Me and Juliet has to be classed as a failure\\". The backstage drama portrayed in the musical was matched by actual difficulties among the cast. McCracken, who played Betty, was the wife of choreographer Bob Fosse and became pregnant during the run. Bill Hayes later wrote that she lost her baby through miscarriage about the same time she lost her husband to Gwen Verdon. The baby was in fact aborted, because the pregnancy would have endangered McCracken's health as a result of her diabetes. Hayes noted that in the fifteen months he played Larry, he did not recall ever having a conversation with Isabel Bigley, who was supposedly his love interest and wife: \\"I doubt that the audience ever believed we were deeply in love.\\" The show received no Tony Award nominations. During the run, Hammerstein followed his usual practice of visiting the theatre now and again to ensure that the performers were not taking liberties with his book. Upon his return, Hammerstein's secretary asked him how the show was going. The lyricist thought for a second, then said \\"I hate that show.\\" According to Bill Hayes in his autobiography Like Sands Through the Hourglass published in 2005 he states We played nearly five hundred performances, however, all to full houses. Production costs were paid off and substantial profits went into the R&H; till. So, though not in the same category as the storied five that were made into films - Oklahoma!, Carousel, South Pacific, The King and I and The Sound of Music - our show must be considered a success. No national tour was attempted, but the show did have a six-week run at the Shubert Theatre in Chicago in spring 1954. Rodgers & Hammerstein, with their spouses, attended the opening night performance.Cass, Judith. \\"Fashions and Fancy.\\" Chicago Tribune, 18 April 1954. Among those who played in the chorus during the New York run was future star Shirley MacLaine; Shirley Jones was a chorus girl in the Chicago performances, and she at least once substituted for an indisposed Isabel Bigby, \\"downed with a virus.\\"Cassidy, Claudia. \\"On the Aisle,\\" Chicago Tribune, 20 May 1954. Subsequent productions include one by Kansas City's Starlight Theatre in 1955. Equity Library Theatre produced it in New York in 1970; it returned to that city, though not to Broadway, in 2002 with the York Theatre. A London production was presented by the Finborough Theatre in 2010 in a fifty-seat theatre; the production was billed as the show's European premiere.

At the time Rodgers wrote the score, a Latin dance craze had swept the United States, and its influence found its way into the music for Me and Juliet. Rodgers put an onstage jazz trio in the production and encouraged the members to improvise. Among the trio was jazz artist Barbara Carroll as Chris, rehearsal pianist. \\"Intermission Talk\\", the chatter among audience members early in the second act, is given a bouncy melody and sly references to a number of shows then on Broadway—including the duo's own The King and I. According to author and composer Ethan Mordden, Rodgers's score \\"found [Rodgers & Hammerstein] going for impish, nimble, the sound of the Hit Parade as reimagined by [them]\\". Rodgers borrowed the music for \\"No Other Love,\\" a tango, from his award-winning score for Victory at Sea. RCA, which had those rights, arranged for Perry Como to record the song, and it was rushed onto the market to coincide with the show's Broadway opening. The record became a number-one hit for Como on the Disc Jockey chart, though #2 as a best seller, remaining on the charts for 22 weeks. Hischak described the original cast album as \\"surprisingly lively and mostly enjoyable for a musical that was considered so dull on stage.\\" He pointed to \\"Intermission Talk\\" as a number which probably works better in a recording than on stage and states that \\"there is no mistaking the hypnotic power of 'No Other Love'\\". The original cast recording was released on compact disc in 1993.  Critical reception and assessment  Critics' views were neutral to unfavorable. The New York Times critic Brooks Atkinson praised the acting and choreography, but stated, \\"This is their Valentine to show business, expressed in the form of a show-within-a- show; and it has just about everything except an intelligible story.\\" Herald- Tribune critic Walter Kerr noted that \\"Rodgers and Hammerstein have come perilously close to writing a show-without-a-show.\\" George Jean Nathan of the Journal American stated that \\"Hammerstein's book has the effect of hanging idly around waiting for an idea to come to him.\\" Robert Coleman of the Daily Mirror noted, \\"Having set new high standards for musicals throughout the world, Rodgers and Hammerstein dipped into the lower drawer of their desk for Me and Juliet. It proved a big disappointment for this dyed-in-the-wool R. & H. fan.\\" John Chapman of the Daily News commented, \\"It is at its most interesting when Jo Mielziner's sets are in motion\\". According to Steven Suskin in his compilation of Broadway opening night reviews, the seven major New York critics allotted the production no raves, one favorable review, one mixed, four unfavorable, and one pan. One well-received number was \\"Keep It Gay\\", a song which in rehearsal had been assigned to several different performers before ending with Bob. The song was liked in part due to the novelty of its setting: it begins with Bob singing from the light bridge high above the stage; following a blackout the internal play performers take it up on the stage below, and following another blackout, the performers are seen in their workout clothes, at a rehearsal some weeks later. Hammerstein gave credit for the scene to Mielziner, and suggested that it demonstrated one way in which the book had affected the music. Abbott stated that there were two reasons for what he considered to be the show's failure. The first was Rodgers and Hammerstein's overconfidence; they thought of themselves as Broadway's \\"Golden Boys\\" who could do no wrong. The other was the play-within-the-play, which had not been thoroughly thought out by anyone. According to Abbott, Hammerstein remained \\"positively Sphinx-like\\" on the subject. At a loss to understand the characters of the play-within-the play, Alton came up with nothing more than routine song-and-dance numbers. During the run, the duo approached choreographer Jerome Robbins and asked him if he could fix the dances. Robbins said that he could, but he would not, as \\"it would kill Bob Alton\\". According to Hammerstein biographer Hugh Fordin, \\"[the] intended contrast between onstage and backstage life was never achieved because the onstage show was so tepid and confusing.\\" \\"That's the Way it Happens\\" was included in the 1996 stage version of Rodgers and Hammerstein's 1945 movie musical, State Fair. According to David Lewis in his history of the Broadway musical, \\"The Rodgers and Hammerstein office has, it would appear, given up on [later R&H; musical] Pipe Dream and [Me and] Juliet ever finding an audience ... so these songs are up for grabs.\\" Composer and author Ethan Mordden, in his book on the duo's works, wrote of the conceptual difficulties which Rodgers and Hammerstein had with the musical:  Characters and opening night cast  Principal characters: * Jeanie, chorus singer — Isabel Bigley * Bob, electrician — Mark Dawson * Larry, assistant stage manager — Bill Hayes * Mac, stage manager — Ray Walston * Dario, conductor — George S.

They played at Queen's Terrace in Ossett, in West Yorkshire, more commonly known as Dimplewells, the area of Ossett the ground is situated in. History The club was formed in 1944 as a junior club, eventually they became a senior club and played in the West Riding County Amateur League and the West Yorkshire League, winning numerous honours before joining the Yorkshire League in 1957. Albion won promotion from Division 2 in 1959 and were runner up to League champions Farsley Celtic in 1960. Albion were runners up again in 1962 to champions Stocksbridge Works. Albion continued to get regular top 4 places for several years afterwards but in 1972 they were relegated to Division 2. Albion won promotion in 1974 and finally won the Yorkshire League title in 1975. However, Albion went down again in 1978, but bounced back as Division 2 champions in 1979. Albion suffered yet another relegation in 1980, but again won the Division 2 title in 1981. In 1982, the Yorkshire League joined up with the Midland League to form the Northern Counties East Football League. Ossett Albion were placed in Division 1 East, league re-organisations moved them into Division 1 Central in 1984 and Division 1 in 1985. Albion were Division 1 champions in 1987 and were promoted to the Premier Division. They finished bottom the first two seasons, but avoided relegation and eventually they began to climb the table. Albion, with Gerry Quinn as manager, were League champions in 1999, but were denied promotion to the Northern Premier League Division One due to one of their changing rooms not being big enough. In 2001, with Eric Gilchrist in charge, Albion finished 2nd to Brigg Town but were promoted to the Northern Premier League Division One instead of Brigg. Ossett Albion finished bottom of the division in 2002 and they were relegated back to the Northern Counties East League but in 2004 Albion were champions again on a dramatic final day of the season, they pipped Eastwood Town to the Northern Counties East Premier Division title by virtue of scoring the more goals with the two clubs locked on the same number of points and also with the same goal difference, returning to the Northern Premier Division One. 2016–17 was Albion's 13th in the Northern Premier League Division One and their fortunes in recent campaigns fluctuated considerably. Twice the club finished just outside the play-off positions, they also had a few seasons struggling against relegation and in 2013–14 only a late reprieve rescued their status at this level. Albion first entered the FA Cup in 1962–63, winning their first game 5–1 at Selby Town. They have reached the 4th Qualifying Round on three occasions, in 1965–66 they defeated Bridlington Town, Harrogate Town and Bridlington Trinity before losing 3–0 to South Liverpool away. In 2003–04, Albion beat Alnwick Town, Alsager Town, Ossett Town, Pickering Town and Newcastle Town before losing 1–0 at home to Stalybridge Celtic. In 2012–13, Albion beat Hebburn Town, Farsley, North Ferriby United, and Hinckley United before losing 4–1 away to Bradford Park Avenue. In the FA Trophy, Albion have reached the 1st round twice, in 2002 and 2005. In the FA Vase, Albion reached the 4th round in 1982, 1995 and 2000. Albion first entered the FA Amateur Cup in 1952, beating Hull Old Grammarians 2–0. Their best performances, to get to the 1st round proper, were in 1962 (losing to Crook 1–0), 1968 (losing to North Shields 3–0) and 1973 (losing to Oldbury United 1–0). Albion's biggest win was 10–2 over Reckitts and Sons. Albion's last game in the Amateur Cup was a 3–1 defeat at North Ferriby United. The FA Amateur Cup was discontinued in 1974 and replaced by the FA Vase. Albion have won the West Riding County Cup in 1965, 1966, 1968 and 1999, the Yorkshire League Cup in 1976 and 1977 and the Northern Counties East Football League Cup in 1984, beating Ilkeston 2-1, and 2003, beating Sheffield 3–0. Albion's all-time record appearances holder is Peter Eaton, who made over 800 appearances during the 1970s and 1980s. Albion's record goalscorer is John Balmer, who hit over 40 goals in consecutive seasons during Jimmy Martin's reign in the early 1990s. A number of former Ossett Albion players progressed into the Football League including Ian Ironside who went to Middlesbrough, Gary Brook who joined Newport County in 1987, Chris Cornelly who joined Lincoln City, Steve Downes who joined Grimbsy Town, Barry Holmes who went to Halifax Town, Shane Killock who joined Huddersfield Town and Dave Syers, who began his career with Ossett Albion, turned professional two seasons later with Bradford City. Players who represented Ossett Albion after their professional careers ended include ex- Cambridge United striker Micky Norbury, John Balmer who also played for Cambridge United, Fulham midfielder Robert Wilson, former Swansea City player Paul Raynor and former Huddersfield Town defender Rob Edwards. Current Albion defender, Dominic Riordan, was appointed chairman on 25 June 2014. Ex-Everton and England U18 youth player George Green signed for Ossett Albion in November 2015 after voluntarily terminating his contract at Oldham Athletic. He made 4 league appearances for the club before signing for Championship team Burnley in January 2016. In September 2017, the founders and directors of Unita, a local based facilities management company, took the reins at Ossett Albion in a move which sees the club inherit a ready-made football academy with 150 players currently enrolled. This saw Huddersfield Town's former head of youth development Dave Haley take over as first team manager and Andy Welsh former Sunderland midfielder become head coach. Phil Smith (ex Sheffield Wednesday Academy coach) will provide support and oversee the running of the academy. In 2018, it was announced that Ossett Albion and Ossett Town would merge to form Ossett United.Further details announced on the merger – Ossett, united Ossett Town Honours *Yorkshire League Division One **Champions: 1974–75 *Yorkshire League Division Two **Champions: 1978–79, 1980–81 **Promoted: 1958–59, 1973–74 *Yorkshire League Cup **Champions: 1975–76, 1976–77 **Runners-Up: 1960–61, 1962–63 *Northern Counties East Football League Premier Division **Champions: 1998–99, 2003–04 **Promoted: 2000–01 *Northern Counties East Football League Division One **Champions: 1986–87 *Northern Counties East Football League Cup **Champions: 1983-4, 2002–03 **Runners-Up: 1995–96 *West Riding County Cup **Champions: 1965, 1966, 1968, 1999.

Following the vastness of his world tour recently captured on Tripping the Live Fantastic, McCartney relished the opportunity to strip back his songs and appear on the newly launched acoustic- only show MTV Unplugged. Consequently, McCartney was the first in a long line of artists to release an unplugged album.http://www.history.com/this-day-in- history/mtv-unplugged-premieres Performance Unlike other artists who appeared on the acclaimed show with acoustic instruments plugged into amplifiers (producing the sound heard), McCartney's instruments were 100 percent unplugged. Microphones were carefully placed close to guitars, pianos, etc. to pick up the sound (this can be seen on the album cover, where a large rectangular microphone is pictured in front of McCartney's acoustic guitar). Using the same line-up that had recently backed him (save for Blair Cunningham who had replaced Chris Whitten), McCartney used the opportunity to dust off some of his rarer tracks, including three from his 1970 debut album McCartney, alongside several covers and amid a helping of familiar Beatles hits. Songs This recording was one of the first in the famed MTV Unplugged series. Several tracks performed in the show were not included on the album, as follows: \\"Things We Said Today\\", \\"Midnight Special\\", \\"Matchbox\\", \\"Mean Woman Blues\\" and \\"The Fool\\". Numbers rehearsed by the band but not performed at all include: \\"Mother Nature's Son\\", \\"Figure of Eight\\", \\"Cut Across Shorty\\", \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\", \\"Heart of the Country\\", \\"She's My Baby\\", and \\"Mrs. Vandebilt\\". \\"Things We Said Today\\" and \\"Midnight Special\\" would see official release two years later in 1993 as B-sides to the \\"Biker Like an Icon\\" single.

Initially released in a limited edition, individually numbered run in 1991, Unplugged (The Official Bootleg)—with artwork that recalls Снова в СССР's—was reissued in a more permanent fashion in the late 1990s.

Following the victory at the Battle of Trenton early in the morning of December 26, 1776, General George Washington of the Continental Army and his council of war expected a strong British counterattack. Washington and the council decided to meet this attack in Trenton and established a defensive position south of the Assunpink Creek. Lieutenant General Charles Cornwallis led the British forces southward in the aftermath of the December 26 battle. Leaving 1,400 men under Lieutenant Colonel Charles Mawhood in Princeton, Cornwallis advanced on Trenton with about 5,000 men on January 2\\\\. His advance was significantly slowed by defensive skirmishing by American riflemen under the command of Edward Hand, and the advance guard did not reach Trenton until twilight. After assaulting the American positions three times and being repulsed each time, Cornwallis decided to wait and finish the battle the next day. Washington moved his army around Cornwallis's camp that night and attacked Mawhood at Princeton the next day. That defeat prompted the British to withdraw from most of New Jersey for the winter. Background On the night of December 25–26, 1776, George Washington, Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army, crossed the Delaware River with his army, and attacked the Hessian garrison at the Battle of Trenton on the morning of December 26.McCullough p. 277 The Hessian garrison was surrounded and quickly defeated. Washington crossed the river again and returned to his camp in Pennsylvania that afternoon.McCullough p. 284 On December 30, Washington moved his army back to Trenton and stationed his men on the south side of the Assunpink Creek.Ketchum p. 276 PreludeWashington's appeal= At Trenton, Washington faced a dilemma. All but a handful of his men's enlistments were expiring on December 31, and he knew that the army would collapse unless he convinced them to stay.Ketchum p. 277 So, on December 30, Washington appealed to his men to stay one month longer for a bounty of ten dollars.McCullough p. 285 He asked any men who wanted to volunteer to poise their firelocks, but not a man turned out.Lengel p. 196 Washington then wheeled his horse around and rode in front of the troops, saying \\"My brave fellows, you have done all I asked you to do, and more than could be reasonably expected; but your country is at stake, your wives, your houses and all that you hold dear. You have worn yourselves out with fatigues and hardships, but we know not how to spare you. If you will consent to stay only one month longer, you will render that service to the cause of liberty and to your country which you probably never can do under any other circumstances.\\" At first no one stepped forward, but then one soldier stepped forward, and he was followed by most of the others, leaving only a few in the original line.Ketchum p. 278 =Preparations= On January 1, 1777, money from the Continental Congress arrived in Trenton and the men were paid.Ketchum p. 280 Washington also received a series of resolves from Congress including one that gave Washington powers similar to those of a military dictator. Washington decided that he would stand and fight at Trenton and ordered General John Cadwalader, who was at Crosswicks with 1,800 militia, to join him in Trenton.Ketchum p. 282 On December 31 Washington learned that an army of 8,000 men under the command of General Cornwallis was moving to attack him at Trenton.Ketchum p. 284 Washington ordered his men to build earthworks that were parallel to the south bank of the Assunpink Creek southeast of Trenton proper (near the modern location of the Trenton Transit Center). The lines extended about three miles (4.8 km) down the south end of the stream. However, one of Washington's aides, Joseph Reed, pointed out that there were fords upstream that the British could cross, and then they would be in position to drive in Washington's right flank. Washington could not escape across the Delaware because all of his boats were a few miles upstream. Washington told his officers that he planned to move the army and that their current position was only temporary. =British movement= Charles, Earl Cornwallis, portrait by Thomas Gainsborough Cornwallis, who had been planning to return to Britain, had his leave canceled.Lengel p. 199 He rode to Princeton to catch up with General James Grant, who had moved with 1,000 troops to reinforce Princeton. Cornwallis arrived, and was convinced by Grant and Carl von Donop to attack Trenton with their combined forces. By January 1, 1777, Cornwallis and his army had reached Princeton.Ketchum p. 286 On January 2, Cornwallis left part of his force there under the command of Charles Mawhood, and with 5,500 men, set off down the road to Trenton, away. Cornwallis's army had 28 cannon and marched in three columns. When Cornwallis reached Maidenhead (now Lawrenceville), he detached Colonel Alexander Leslie with 1,500 men and ordered them to remain there until the following morning. BattleDelaying actions= Out in front of his army, Cornwallis placed a skirmish line of Hessian jägers and British light infantry.Ketchum p. 288 Two days before, Washington had troops under the command of Matthias Alexis Roche de Fermoy place an outer defensive line halfway between Trenton and Princeton, with the goal of delaying the British advance.Lengel p. 200 As the British approached, Fermoy returned to Trenton, drunk. Colonel Edward Hand took over his command. As the British came within range, the American riflemen opened fire.Ketchum p. 289 The American riflemen took cover in the woods, ravines and even in bends in the road, and each time the British would line up in a battle line, the riflemen would fall back and fire from cover. After Hand was forced to abandon the American position along Five Mile Run, he took up a new position, a heavily wooded area on the south bank of Shabakunk Creek. Hand deployed his men in the trees where they were so well protected from view that the British could not see them as they crossed the bridge over the stream. The riflemen fired at them from point-blank range. The intense fire confused the British into thinking that the entire American army was up against them, and they formed into battle lines, bringing up their cannon. The British searched the woods for a half an hour looking for the Americans, but Hand had already withdrawn to a new position. By three in the afternoon, the British had reached a ravine known as Stockton Hollow, about a half a mile (0.8 km) from Trenton where the Americans were forming another line of defense. Washington wanted to hold the British off until nightfall, when darkness would prevent the British from attacking his defenses on the south side of Assunpink Creek. The British, with artillery in position, attacked Hand's new position, and he gave way, slowly falling back into Trenton. Along the way, Hand had his troops fire from behind houses.Ketchum p. 290 As Hand's troops came to the creek, the Hessians charged at them with bayonets fixed, causing chaos among the Americans. Washington, seeing the chaos, rode out through the crowd of men crossing the bridge and shouted that Hand's rear guard pull back and regroup under the cover of the American artillery.Lengel p. 201 =British assault= As the British prepared to attack the American defenses, cannon and musket fire were exchanged between the opposing sides. The British moved across the bridge, advancing in solid columns, and the Americans all fired together. The British fell back, but only for a moment. The British charged the bridge again but were driven back by cannon fire. The British charged one final time, but the Americans fired canister shot this time, and the British lines were raked with fire. One soldier said, \\"The bridge looked red as blood, with their killed and wounded and their red coats.\\" American withdrawalCornwallis' decision= When Cornwallis arrived in Trenton with the main army, he called a council of war to determine whether he should continue to attack.Ketchum p. 291 Cornwallis' quartermaster general, William Erskine, urged Cornwallis to strike right away, saying \\"If Washington is the General I take him to be, his army will not be found there in the morning.\\" But James Grant disagreed and argued that there was no way for the Americans to retreat, and that the British troops were worn out, and that it would be better for them to attack in the morning after they had rested. Cornwallis did not want to wait until morning, but he decided that it would be better than sending his troops out to attack in the dark. Cornwallis said, \\"We've got the old fox safe now. We'll go over and bag him in the morning.\\" Cornwallis then moved his army to a hill north of Trenton for the night. =Washington's decision= During the night, the American artillery, under the command of Henry Knox, occasionally fired shells into Trenton to keep the British on edge. As Cornwallis had, Washington also called for a council of war. He would take the road leading to Princeton, and his council of war agreed to make an attempt against the British garrison there.Ketchum p. 294 By 2 am on January 3, the army was on its way to Princeton. Washington left behind 500 men and two cannon to keep the fires burning and to make noise with picks and shovels to make the British think they were digging in. By morning, these men too had evacuated, and when the British came to attack, all of the American troops were gone.Ketchum p. 296 Casualties Casualty estimates are widely divergent. Howard Peckham records the fighting on January 2 as two separate engagements, both of which he categorizes as \\"skirmishes\\". In the first, at Five Mile Run, he gives no American losses. In the second, at Stockton Hollow, he gives the American casualties as 6 killed, 10 wounded and 1 deserted. William S. Stryker, on the other hand, gives the entire American loss on January 2 as 1 killed and 6 wounded, while David Hackett Fischer says that they had 100 killed and wounded. Peckham gives the British losses at Five Mile Run as 1 Hessian killed and those for Stockton Hollow as \\"at least\\" 10 killed, 20 wounded and 25 captured. Edward J. Lowell gives the Hessian losses on January 2 as 4 killed and 11 wounded.Lowell, p. 301 David Hackett Fischer gives the British casualties as 365 killed, wounded or captured. Aftermath By morning of January 3, Washington had reached Princeton.McCullough p. 288 After a brief battle, the British there were decisively defeated, and a substantial number of the garrison under command of Mawhood was captured. With their third defeat in ten days, Cornwallis' superior, General William Howe, ordered the army to withdraw from southern New Jersey and most of the way back to New York. This they did, leaving forward positions at New Brunswick. Washington moved his army to Morristown for winter quarters.McCullough p. 290 Legacy The battle was commemorated on April 21, 1789 with a triumphal arch erected on the bridge over the Assunpink Creek during George Washington's reception at Trenton on his way to his first inauguration. In 1792, American artist, John Trumbull, painted the full-length portrait of Washington, General George Washington at Trenton, showing him after the day's battle standing south of the bridge over the Assunpink Creek.

Hazlehurst composed the theme tunes for many well-known British sitcoms and gameshows of the 1970s and the 1980s, including Yes Minister, Are You Being Served?, I Didn't Know You Cared and Last of the Summer Wine. Early life Ronald Hazlehurst was born in Dukinfield, Cheshire, in 1928, to a railway worker father and a piano teacher mother. Having attended Hyde County Grammar School, he left at the age of 14 and became a clerk in a cotton mill for £1 a week. From 1947 to 1949 he did his National Service as a bandsman in the 4th/7th Royal Dragoon Guards. During his spare time, he played in a band, and soon became a professional musician earning £4 a week. The band appeared on the BBC Light Programme, but Hazlehurst left when he was refused a pay rise. Moving to Manchester, he became a freelance musician until he was offered a place in another band at a nightclub in London. Ronnie Hazlehurst worked at Granada for about a year in 1955 and, after he left there, worked on a market stall in Watford to make ends meet. BBC career Hazlehurst joined the BBC in 1961 and became a staff arranger; his early works included the incidental music for The Likely Lads, The Liver Birds and It's a Knockout. In 1968 he became the Light Entertainment Musical Director and, during his tenure, he composed the theme tunes of many sitcoms, including Are You Being Served?; Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em; Last of the Summer Wine (where he also wrote all the instrumental music for the show); I Didn't Know You Cared; The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin; To the Manor Born; Yes, Minister; Yes, Prime Minister; and Three Up, Two Down. He also arranged the themes for Butterflies, Sorry! and the first series of Only Fools and Horses. In addition, he wrote the theme tunes for the sketch show The Two Ronnies, the game shows Blankety Blank, Odd One Out and Bruce Forsyth's The Generation Game and the chat show Wogan. His theme tunes often included elements designed to fit the programmes, such as a cash till in Are You Being Served?, rises and falls in The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin and the Big Ben chimes for Yes Minister. For Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em, Hazlehurst used Morse code to spell out the programme's title. During his BBC career he composed the music for the opening of the BBC's coverage of the 1976 Olympics. He left the BBC in the 1990s. Other work Hazlehurst was also involved with the Eurovision Song Contest and was the musical director when the event was hosted by the United Kingdom in 1974, 1977 and 1982. He also conducted the British entry on seven occasions, in 1977, 1982, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1991 and 1992. In 1977, as well as conducting the British entry, he also conducted the German entry. To conduct the British entry that year, Lynsey de Paul and Mike Moran, he used a closed umbrella instead of a baton and wore a bowler hat. He also arranged and conducted two singers' performances of their voice-overs for opening credits, Clare Torry for Butterflies (\\"Love Is like a Butterfly\\") and Paul Nicholas for Just Good Friends. He also recorded some LPs and CDs with his orchestra including a 2-CD box set of Laurel and Hardy film music; his orchestra also backed singer Marti Caine on an album that was released on CD. Later years Hazlehurst moved from Hendon, North London, to Guernsey in about 1997. In 1999, he was awarded a Gold Badge from the British Academy of Composers and Songwriters. Music was Hazlehurst's life and passion as well as his work and he continued to work right up to his heart bypass operation in October 2006. On 27 September 2007 he suffered a stroke and, without regaining consciousness, died on 1 October in Princess Elizabeth Hospital, St Martin, Guernsey. Having been married twice, with two sons from his second marriage, at the time of his death his partner was Jean Fitzgerald.

It is the first chapter of the Moves Trilogy and it was followed by Navy Moves in 1987 and Arctic Moves in 1995. It was first released in 1986 and published by Dinamic in Spain and by Imagine Software. Dinamic Software also developed a MS-DOS version of the game, published in 1989 in Spain. Gameplay The game contains seven levels that are divided into two main sections. The first four levels make up the first section, where the player has to drive an army unit (jeep or helicopter) through a terrain, steering clear of hostile vehicles. In the last three levels that comprise the second main section, one plays as a soldier who shoots enemies along his way. In level 5 the soldier must jump from rock to rock in a river, shooting hostile birds. Thereafter, the soldier makes his way into the enemy headquarters with the goal of retrieving secret documents. Army Moves was regarded as a rather bad game on the Amiga -- \\"Almost non-existent gameplay makes this very poor value for money\\", according to a review in Zzap!. However, it received mixed reviews from ZX Spectrum magazines and was successful enough in Spain to spawn two follow-ups, Navy Moves in 1988 and Arctic Moves in 1995. The latter appeared only for the PC platform, and it included the first two chapters of the series, playable through a ZX Spectrum emulator, as an extra. A fourth entry in the series, Desert Moves was announced at the end of the game Arctic Moves, but never appeared. The game music in non-Spanish versions is based on the Colonel Bogey March.

He served as Member of Parliament for Epsom for 23 years, from 1955 to 1978, and held the offices of Solicitor General (1962–1964) and Attorney General for England and Wales (1970–1974) and for Northern Ireland (1972–1974). Had he been appointed Lord Chancellor, as seemed likely during the mid-1970s, he would have been the first Roman Catholic to hold that position since Thomas More in 1532. Early life Rawlinson was born in Iping, West SussexObituary, The Independent, 30 June 2006 or Birkenhead, Cheshire.Obituary, The Guardian, 30 June 2006 on 26 June 1919. He was the son of Lieutenant-Colonel A. R. Rawlinson OBE, a figure in military intelligence and a screenwriter. He was educated by Benedictine monks at Downside, near Bath, Somerset. He read Law at Christ's College, Cambridge, where he joined the Cambridge Footlights. He was later elected as an Honorary Fellow of his college in 1981. However, he only completed one year at the university, moving on to the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, on the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939. He joined the Irish Guards in 1940. In 1943, he was wounded in battle while serving in North Africa and mentioned in dispatches. He was demobilized as a Major in 1946. Legal career Rawlinson was called to the bar at Inner Temple in 1946, just before he left the Army. He later became a Bencher in 1962 and was Treasurer in 1984. He joined the chambers of Walter Monckton. The first of his cases that came to public attention was that of Alfred Charles Whiteway, in the Towpath murder case in 1953, in which he was junior counsel. He subjected the leading police murder squad detective, Herbert Hannam, to a searching cross- examination over 2 days, which exposed substantial gaps in Hannam's account of a confession by Whiteway. Whiteway was convicted and hanged, but Rawlinson was instructed in other well-known cases. He was also a junior counsel in the unsuccessful defence of Peter Wildeblood, tried with Edward Montagu and Michael Pitt-Rivers for gross indecency in 1954. A year later in 1955, he was junior counsel for Melford Stevenson in the defence of Ruth Ellis, who was hanged. He also acted in defence of General Anders in a libel case. He took silk in 1959. He was Recorder of Salisbury from 1961 to 1962, and Recorder of Kingston upon Thames from 1975 to 2002. He was Leader of the Western Circuit from 1975 to 1982. In 1965, he defended the Daily Express in an action relating to D-Notices. Political career A member of the Conservative Party, he stood as a Parliamentary candidate for Hackney South in the 1951 general election, losing in a landslide to the Labour incumbent, Herbert Butler. He was elected in the 1955 general election for the safe Conservative seat of Epsom, and held the seat until it was abolished at the February 1974 general election. He was re-elected for the new Epsom and Ewell seat, which he held until his ennoblement in 1978. He was appointed Solicitor-General by Harold Macmillan in June 1962, following the Night of the Long Knives, receiving the customary knighthood, and served through the prosecution of the spy John Vassall (and subsequent resignation of a junior minister, Tam Galbraith) and the Profumo affair, in which his offer to resign was declined. He was sworn of the Privy Council in the 1964 New Year Honours, and remained on the front benches in opposition, after the government lost the 1964 general election, but returned to the back benches after unsuccessfully supporting Reginald Maudling as new party leader. From the back benches, he led the opposition to the abolition of the death penalty. He served as Attorney General during the government of Edward Heath, from 1970 to 1974. Unusually, he conducted many prosecutions in person, including that of the Hosein brothers for kidnapping and murdering Muriel McKay (whom they had mistaken for Rupert Murdoch's wife). He appeared before the House of Lords, arguing that The Times was in contempt of court in publishing details of the cases involving thalidomide, which drew the ire, in particular, of Bernard Levin, who wrote that he appeared to want the law to be administered in private. He also prosecuted IRA members for bombings in London and Aldershot. In 1972, when the Stormont Parliament was suspended, he also became Attorney General for Northern Ireland, and so was called to the bar and became a QC in Northern Ireland that year. He was a target of the Angry Brigade, which attempted to bomb his house several times.  Retirement  He retired from the House of Commons in 1978, and was created a life peer on 17 April 1978 as Baron Rawlinson of Ewell, of Ewell in the County of Surrey. He harboured hopes of being appointed Lord Chancellor or Lord Chief Justice (the law having been changed in 1974 to permit a Roman Catholic to take the former position, widely seen at the time as a measure to permit Rawlinson to take the job) but his politics diverged from those of the new Conservative leader, Margaret Thatcher, and he was never offered either position. In the Lords, he supported restrictions on abortion and divorce, and resisted the introduction of conditional fees in legal cases. After retiring he defended the Daily Mail in a libel action brought by the Unification Church in 1980, and retired from practice at the bar in 1985, but was President of the Senate of Inns of Court and the Bar from 1986 to 1987. He was also an Honorary Member of the American Bar Association, and an Honorary Fellow of the American College Trial Lawyers. Other interests He was also an author, having published a book of poetry in 1943, his autobiography in 1989, books on themes inspired by his Catholic faith, and several novels on legal themes; one, Hatred and Contempt, won the Rumpole Award. He also enjoyed landscape painting and the theatre. He was a member of White's and the Marylebone Cricket Club, the Vice-President of the Royal Automobile Club, and President of the Friends of London Oratory from 1980 to 1995. He was also a director of Daily Telegraph plc. Family He was married twice: # Haidee Kavanagh (1940–1954) (three daughters); (marriage dissolved and annulled by Sacred Rota, Rome 1954) # Elaine Dominguez (1954–2006) (two sons and one daughter) His second wife was his first cousin, their mothers being daughters of Sir Henry Grayson.Burkes Peerage 106th edition pp 1212-3 ArmsPublications * War Poems and Poetry 1943 * Public Duty and Personal Faith - the example of Thomas More 1978 * A Price Too High (autobiography) 1989 * The Jesuit Factor 1990 * The Colombia Syndicate (novel) 1991 * Hatred and Contempt (novel) 1992 * His Brother's Keeper (novel) 1993 * Indictment for Murder (novel) 1994 * The Caverel Claim (novel) 1998 * The Richmond Diary (novel) 2001 * A Relic of War (novel) 2004 References *Burke's Peerage, Debrett's Peerage, Who's Who *Obituary, The Daily Telegraph, 29 June 2006 *Obituary, The Guardian, 30 June 2006 *Obituary, The Independent, 30 June 2006 *Obituary, The Times, 30 June 2006  External links  * Category:1919 births Category:2006 deaths Category:English barristers Category:Irish Guards officers Category:British Army personnel of World War II Category:English Queen's Counsel Category:Queen's Counsel 1901–2000 Category:Members of the Inner Temple Category:Conservative Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies Category:English writers Category:Epsom and Ewell Rawlinson of Ewell Category:Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom Category:English Roman Catholics Category:Graduates of the Royal Military College, Sandhurst Category:People educated at Downside School Category:Alumni of Christ's College, Cambridge Category:Fellows of Christ's College, Cambridge Category:UK MPs 1955–1959 Category:UK MPs 1959–1964 Category:UK MPs 1964–1966 Category:UK MPs 1966–1970 Category:UK MPs 1970–1974 Category:UK MPs 1974 Category:UK MPs 1974–1979 Category:UK MPs who were granted peerages Category:Solicitors General for England and Wales Category:Attorneys General for England and Wales Category:Attorneys General for Northern Ireland Category:Northern Ireland Government ministers Category:English male writers Category:Politicians awarded knighthoods Category:Ministers in the Macmillan and Douglas-Home governments, 1957–1964 ","title":"Peter Rawlinson, Baron Rawlinson of Ewell"},{"id":"2482186","text":"The Rolls-Royce Buzzard was a British piston aero engine of capacity that produced about .

It gained notoriety due to its violent rhetoric and because of several exposés regarding the group's stockpiling of weapons and its plans for armed attacks. Origins The NSAP was the brainchild of Tony Malski, who had been an organiser for the British Movement in London and who during the struggle for leadership of that group between Michael McLaughlin and Ray Hill had sided with Hill.Hill & Bell, p. 141 Malski had been involved with the Campaign for Nationalist Unity, a John Tyndall-led initiative that involved elements of the British Movement along with his own New National Front and groups such as the Constitutional Movement and British Democratic Party. This group formed the basis of the British National Party in 1982, although Malski did not join that party.Hill & Bell, p. 163 From early on, Malski supported the use of force, and in 1981 at a meeting of far right activists he claimed that he had a stockpile of weapons hidden near his home in South Oxhey, Watford which he had seized during a raid on a nearby Territorial Army (TA) base. Malski himself had been a TA member and his house was searched for weapons on a number of occasions by Special Branch.Hill & Bell, pp. 207-208 Feeling that the British Movement did not match up to his militancy, Malski broke from them in mid 1982 and, along with his deputy Phil Kersey, established the NSAP. Development The programme of the NSAP was based entirely on Nazism. The new party had a military-style structure with fifteen separate ranks awarded to party members at various levels, as well as four sub movements, the \\"Black Wolves\\", youth, women and \\"workforce\\". Malski's devotion to militarism earned him the mocking nickname of \\"the Field Marshal\\" amongst far right activists not associated with his fringe party.Hill & Bell, pp. 272-273 Given that the NSAP had less than a hundred members, these military-style ranks seemed somewhat spurious. However, the NSAP did enjoy a close relationship with the influential League of St George, which published the NSAP's glossy magazine The European,Hill & Bell, p. 273 and Malski maintained that it was committed to direct action. An early letter sent to all party members stated that they should \\"support any action of paramilitary groups which come to the rescue of our so much corrupt and infested country\\". The European similarly endorsed paramilitarism and claimed that an \\"effective paramilitary army\\" was being trained by the NSAP. The militancy of the NSAP attracted press attention, and on more than one occasion articles appeared after undercover reporters claimed to have spoken to Malski. For example, a reporter for Searchlight wrote that Malski had told him that he intended to send NSAP fighters into riot-hit cities to foment discontent, and that he had links to the Edelweiss Group, a paramilitary training operation run by Column 88 founder Ian Souter Clarence. This report was followed by one in the News of the World in which Malski was quoted as having told their undercover reporter that the NSAP had a number of arms and ammunitions dumps.Hill & Bell, p. 274 Such revelations led to Labour Party MP Joan Lestor calling for the Department of Public Prosecutions to investigate the activities of the NSAP, although ultimately they decided not to do so. Exposure Ray Hill, with whom Malski was long acquainted, had become a \\"mole\\" within the far right and had agreed to co-operate with Dutch-Israeli film-maker Ludi Boeken on a documentary for Channel 4, part of which was to include an exposé on the activities of the NSAP. To this end Hill arranged to meet Malski and Kersey in a London pub in October 1983, ostensibly to discuss a meeting Hill had earlier held with Yann Tran Long, a French-Vietnamese arms dealer who maintained a wide circle of contacts within the far right across Europe. This meeting was filmed with a hidden cameraHill & Bell, p. 276 and during it Malski claimed that the NSAP had around 1000 members and that members were regularly undertaking military-style training in a local gun club.Hill & Bell, p. 277 Malski also discussed his arrest by Special Branch in 1981 when he was preparing to travel to France to pick up detonators for explosive devices. This had been as part of an earlier plot that Malski had been involved with, along with Yann Tran Long and Alex Oumow of the Faisceaux Nationalistes Européens, and which was to plant a bomb at that year's Notting Hill Carnival. Hill had been privy to the discussions about this initial plot and had informed Searchlight about it before it could be carried out.Hill & Bell, pp. 218-220 Malski was filmed telling Hill that he believed the plot had been disrupted by a high-ranking informer within the British far right, although he pointed the finger at Anthony Hancock rather than at Hill.Hill & Bell, pp. 278-279 Malski also told Hill that he had discovered the secret offices of Searchlight and published their address in The European (although the address published had actually been London Transport offices) as well as the details of the News of the World journalist who had written about the party. He further claimed that nine of the leading members of the NSAP were Oxbridge graduates and that an NSAP attack squad had cleared the way for a recent BNP march by attacking and defeating all the protesters.Hill & Bell, p. 279 Hill subsequently rejected most of this as fantasy, but vouched for some other claims, notably that the NSAP was working closely with Ian Souter Clarence and that he and Oumow were receiving funding from the wealthy Spanish group CEDADE.Hill & Bell, pp. 279-280 The footage of Malski and Kersey formed a significant part of the documentary, which aired in March 1984, during which Hill revealed himself as the mole.Hill & Bell, p. 281 Disappearance Following the screening of the documentary, the NSAP ceased to operate and the name has not been used sinceHill & Bell, p. 291 although the party was publicly mentioned in 1986 when member Graham Paton was convicted of sending propaganda and a concealed razor blade to an anti-apartheid activist.Peter Barberis, John McHugh, Mike Tyldesley, Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations, 2002, p. 189 Malski, who was dismissed by many on the far right in Britain as something of a Walter Mitty character,Hill & Bell, pp. 207-209 has occasionally surfaced at meetings, including speeches by David Irving.

Like some other such kits, its use could produce a strong odour of chemicals in the hair that some found unpleasant. The fashion for home perming subsequently ended and the brand has long since ceased being produced.

The battle took place near Szentgotthárd and Mogersdorf in Western Hungary, near the present-day Austro-Hungarian border and is known as the Battle of Mogersdorf in Austria. The Turks were militarily defeated but were able to negotiate the Peace of Vasvár, which was highly favorable to them.Cross and Crescent Preparations Ottoman dominance in Hungary began with the Battle of Mohács in 1526, which resulted in the conquest of most of Hungary by Suleiman the Magnificent. Meanwhile, the parts of Hungary that remained under Austrian control became known as Royal Hungary. Although the Ottomans had been in relative decline since the death of Suleiman I, Ottoman power saw a resurgence under the extremely capable Köprülü family who sought to destroy the Austrian Habsburgs once and for all. They found their casus belli when the Habsburgs supported a Transylvanian rebellion against Ottoman rule. Transylvania had escaped Ottoman conquest during the invasion of Hungary and retained its independence by playing off of their powerful neighbors: Poland, Austria and the Ottomans. They recognized Ottoman suzerainty and paid a tribute to the Porte but were given political and religious autonomy in return. In 1658, seeking new land for his principality, Prince George Rákóczy II invaded Poland with his Swedish allies in the Second Northern War. After initial success, he was defeated by the Poles and fled back to Transylvania. On hearing about Rákóczy's unauthorized war, the Ottomans declared war on their vassal. It was not long before Grand Vizier Köprülü Mehmed Pasha (Vizier 1656-1661) defeated Rákóczy and conquered Transylvania. The new Transylvanian prince, János Kemény, fled to Vienna, seeking Austrian support. Emperor Leopold I, not wishing to see Transylvania fall under direct Ottoman control, sent Montecuccoli into Hungary with his small army. Montecuccoli gave no direct support as he was severely outnumbered by the Ottomans. The Ottomans, meanwhile, completed the conquest of Transylvania and built up their forces in Ottoman Hungary. Leopold I, not wishing to face the Turks alone, summoned the Imperial Diet in January 1663. The Turks failed to conquer the fortress of Nové Zámky six times, but managed to do so in 1663. It was made the center of an Ottoman province, the Uyvar eyalet in present-day southern Slovakia. Turks and Tatars crossed the Danube in strength in 1663, ravaging Slovakia, Moravia, and Silesia. They took 12,000 slaves in Moravia. Several Turkish divisions reached as far as Olomouc.Olomouc History Vas County - Hungary Diplomatic efforts Although Leopold personally objected to Protestantism, he had to rely on his Protestant German princes to provide military aid. Even worse was the military aid from France, which was (and continued to be until the Diplomatic Revolution of 1756) Austria's nemesis. Despite numerous objections from some Protestant princes, help was not withheld. The League of the Rhine - a French dominated group of German princes - agreed to send a corps of 6,000 men independently commanded by Count Coligny of France and Prince Johann Philipp of Mainz. By September 1663, Brandenburg and Saxony had also agreed to contingents of their own. In January 1664, the Imperial Diet agreed to raise 21,000 men, although this army did not yet exist other than on paper. The Turks had declared war in April 1663, but were slow in executing their invasion plans. Battle Köprülü's army, which might have numbered 120-150,000, probably included some 60,000 Janissaries and sipahis, 60-90,000 azaps, akıncıs, silidars, Tatars and vassals and allegedly 360 guns. Raimondo Montecuccoli Montecuccoli's army consisted of Habsburg forces (including Czech infantry and a few hundred Hungarians, approx. 2,000 Croatians) and forces from the German principalities, French brigades, a Piedmontese regiment . The Habsburg forces: 5,000 infantry (10 Battalions), 5,900 cavalry (27 escadrons), 10 guns The Imperial forces: 6,200 infantry (6 Battalions), 1,200 cavalry (9 escadrons), 14 guns The Rhine forces: 600 infantry (2 Battalions), 300 cavalry (4 escadrons) The French forces: 3,500 infantry (4 Battalions), 1,750 cavalry (10 escadrons) Other forces: 2,000 Croat cavalry (out of this a regiment), Hungarian foot soldiers in Szentgotthárd, and Esterházy, Batthyány and Nádasdy regiment's, Czech musketeers and the Italian (Piedmontish) infantry regiment (commander Marchese Pio de Savoya). The Turks renewed their invasion in the spring of 1664. They besieged, conquered and destroyed Novi Zrin Fortress on the Mura river in northern Croatia at the very beginning of July. Montecuccoli was still waiting for help to arrive, and this delay was key to the defense of Austria. In July 1664 the Imperial forces were assembled and set out for the River Rába, which separated the Ottoman forces from the Austrian duchy itself. If the Turks were allowed to cross, they would threaten both Vienna and Graz. Montecuccoli intercepted the Turks before they crossed the river but the division of command made effective deployment of troops impossible. On 1 August 1664, Ottoman forces crossed the river near the monastery of Saint Gotthard and beat the Austrians back. Although initially plagued by disunity, Montecuccoli was finally able to convince Coligny and Leopold Wilhelm of Baden-Baden (commander of the Imperial detachment) to mass their forces and attack the Ottoman troops, who were reorganizing in a nearby forest. The attack surprised the Turks, who fled in confusion back to the river, a large number drowning. The confusion caused by the fleeing troops prevented Ahmed Köprülü (Vizier 1661-1676) from sending the rest of his army across the river and he instead retired from the field. The Battle in an engraving of the era. Ottoman casualties were heavy, significantly falling mostly on the elite corps of the army. Köprülü was left with an army of ill-trained irregulars and auxiliaries while Montecuccoli's casualties were light and mostly in the Imperial contingent. Stonecross of Schösslberg, over Mogersdorf; monument of the Battle of Saint Gotthard (1664). Aftermath Although many in Europe, especially the Croats and Hungarian nobility, expected the Austrian Habsburgs to finally liberate Hungary once and for all, Leopold abandoned the campaign. Many have criticized him for this decision (both in the past and the present). Although Montecuccoli's army was largely intact, there was no interest among the allies to liberate Hungary. Any invasion of Hungary would undoubtedly have to be done without the help of the French and German troops. Leopold noticed that the French officers had begun to fraternize with the Magyar nobles and encouraged them to rebel against Austrian rule. In addition, Leopold had always been a member of the \\"Spanish faction\\" in Vienna. With the last Spanish Habsburg, Carlos II, about to die at any given moment, Leopold wanted to ensure that his hands were free for the inevitable struggle against Louis XIV of France. Although the liberation of Hungary was a strategic interest of the Habsburgs, it would have to wait until later. Throughout his reign, Leopold had always been more interested in the struggle against France rather than the Ottomans. Therefore, he signed the rather unfavourable Peace of Vasvár, which did not take into account the Battle of Saint Gotthard. The Battle of Saint Gotthard is still significant, however, for it stopped any Ottoman invasion of Austria, which certainly would have prolonged the war and led to a disastrous resolution. The Austrians would also use the twenty-year truce to build up their forces and begin the liberation of Hungary in 1683. In literature The battle of Mogersdorf/Szentgotthárd provided Rainer Maria Rilke with the inspiration for his poetic short story, \\"Lay of the Love and Death of Cornet Christopher Rilke\\", which was very popular among German and Austrian soldiers during the first half of the 20th century.

It is used to create an additional name (alias) for another data type, but does not create a new type, except in the obscure case of a qualified typedef of an array type where the typedef qualifiers are transferred to the array element type. As such, it is often used to simplify the syntax of declaring complex data structures consisting of struct and union types, but is just as common in providing specific descriptive type names for integer data types of varying lengths. Syntax The syntax of the typedef declaration is: ; type- declaration; The name of the new type alias follows the same syntax as declaring any other C identifier, therefore, in more detailed form: ; type- definition identifier In the C standard library and in POSIX specifications the identifier for the typedef definition is often suffixed with , such as in size_t and time_t. This is practiced in other coding systems, although POSIX explicitly reserves this practice for POSIX data types. Examples typedef int length; This creates the type as a synonym of the type . =Documentation use= A typedef declaration may be used as documentation by indicating the meaning of a variable within the programming context, e.g., it may include the expression of a unit of measurement or counts. The generic declarations, int current_speed; int high_score; void congratulate(int your_score) { if (your_score > high_score) { // ... } } may be expressed by declaring context specific types: typedef int km_per_hour; typedef int points; // \`km_per_hour\` is synonymous with \`int\` here, and thus, the compiler treats // our new variables as integers. km_per_hour current_speed; points high_score; void congratulate(points your_score) { if (your_score > high_score) { // ... } } Both sections of code execute identically. However, the use of typedef declarations in the second code block make it clear that the two variables, while representing the same data type , store different or incompatible data. The definition in of indicates to the programmer that (or any other variable not declared as a ) should not be passed as an argument. This would not be as apparent if both were declared as variables of datatype. However, the indication is for the programmer only; the C/C++ compiler considers both variables to be of type and does not flag type mismatch warnings or errors for \\"wrong\\" argument types for in the code snippet below: void foo() { km_per_hour km100 = 100; congratulate(km100); } =Type simplification= A typedef may be used to simplify the declaration of a compound type (struct, union) or pointer type. For example, struct MyStruct { int data1; char data2; }; This defines the data type . A variable declaration of this type in C also requires the keyword , but it may be omitted in C++: struct MyStruct a; A typedef declaration eliminates the requirement of specifying in C. For example, the declaration typedef struct MyStruct newtype; is reduced to: newtype a; The structure declaration and typedef may also be combined into a single statement: typedef struct MyStruct { int data1; char data2; } newtype; Or it may be used as follows: typedef struct { int data1; char data2; } newtype; In C++, in contrast to C, the keywords , , and are optional in variable declarations that are separate from the definitions, as long as there is no ambiguity to another identifier: struct MyStruct x; MyStruct y; As such, can be used wherever can be used. However, the reverse is not true; for instance, the constructor methods for cannot be named . A notorious example where even C++ needs the keyword is the POSIX stat system call that uses a struct of the same name in its arguments: int stat(const char *filename, struct stat *buf) { // ... } Here both C as well as C++ need the keyword in the parameter definition. =Pointers= The typedef may be used to define a new pointer type. typedef int *intptr; intptr ptr; // Same as: // int *ptr; is a new alias with the pointer type . The definition, , defines a variable with the type . So, is a pointer which can point to a variable of type . Using typedef to define a new pointer type may sometimes lead to confusion. For example: typedef int *intptr; // Both 'cliff' and 'allen' are of type int*. intptr cliff, allen; // 'cliff2' is of type int*, but 'allen2' is of type int**. intptr cliff2, *allen2; // Same as: // intptr cliff2; // intptr *allen2; Above, means defining 2 variables with type for both. This is because a type defined by typedef is a type, not an expansion. In other words, , which is the type, decorates both and . For , the type decorates the and . So, is equivalent to 2 separate definitions, and . means that is a pointer pointing to a memory with type. Shortly, has the type, . =Structures and structure pointers= Typedefs can also simplify definitions or declarations for structure pointer types. Consider this: struct Node { int data; struct Node *nextptr; }; Using typedef, the above code can be rewritten like this: typedef struct Node Node; struct Node { int data; Node *nextptr; }; In C, one can declare multiple variables of the same type in a single statement, even mixing structure with pointer or non-pointers. However, one would need to prefix an asterisk to each variable to designate it as a pointer. In the following, a programmer might assume that was indeed a , but a typographical error means that is a . This can lead to subtle syntax errors. struct Node *startptr, *endptr, *curptr, *prevptr, errptr, *refptr; By defining the typedef , it is assured that all variables are structure pointer types, or say, that each variable is a pointer type pointing to a structure type. typedef struct Node* NodePtr; NodePtr startptr, endptr, curptr, prevptr, errptr, refptr; =Function pointers= int do_math(float arg1, int arg2) { return arg2; } int call_a_func(int (*call_this)(float, int)) { int output = call_this(5.5, 7); return output; } int final_result = call_a_func(&do;_math); The preceding code may be rewritten with typedef specifications: typedef int (*MathFunc)(float, int); int do_math(float arg1, int arg2) { return arg2; } int call_a_func(MathFunc call_this) { int output = call_this(5.5, 7); return output; } int final_result = call_a_func(&do;_math); Here, is the new alias for the type. A is a pointer to a function that returns an integer and takes as arguments a float followed by an integer. When a function returns a function pointer, it can be even more confusing without typedef. The following is the function prototype of signal(3) from FreeBSD: void (*signal(int sig, void (*func)(int)))(int); The function declaration above is cryptic as it does not clearly show what the function accepts as arguments, or the type that it returns. A novice programmer may even assume that the function accepts a single as its argument and returns nothing, but in reality it also needs a function pointer and returns another function pointer. It can be written more cleanly: typedef void (*sighandler_t)(int); sighandler_t signal(int sig, sighandler_t func); =Arrays= A typedef can also be used to simplify the definition of array types. For example, typedef char arrType[6]; arrType arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}; arrType *pArr; // Same as: // char arr[6] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}; // char (*pArr)[6]; Here, is the new alias for the type, which is an array type with 6 elements. For , is a pointer pointing to the memory of the type. Type casts A typedef is created using type definition syntax but can be used as if it were created using type cast syntax. (Type casting changes a data type.) For instance, in each line after the first line of: // \`funcptr\` is a pointer to a function which takes a \`double\` and returns an \`int\`. typedef int (*funcptr)(double); // Valid in C or C++. funcptr x = (funcptr) NULL; // Only valid in C++. funcptr y = funcptr(NULL); funcptr z = static_cast(NULL); is used on the left-hand side to declare a variable and is used on the right-hand side to cast a value. Thus, the typedef can be used by programmers who do not wish to figure out how to convert definition syntax to type cast syntax. Without the typedef, it is generally not possible to use definition syntax and cast syntax interchangeably. For example: void *p = NULL; // This is legal. int (*x)(double) = (int (*)(double)) p; // Left-hand side is not legal. int (*)(double) y = (int (*)(double)) p; // Right-hand side is not legal. int (*z)(double) = (int (*p)(double)); Usage in C++ In C++ type names can be complex, and typedef provides a mechanism to assign a simple name to the type. std::vector> values; for (std::vector>::const_iterator i = values.begin(); i != values.end(); ++i) { std::pair const & t = *i; // ... } and typedef std::pair value_t; typedef std::vector values_t; values_t values; for (values_t::const_iterator i = values.begin(); i != values.end(); ++i) { value_t const & t = *i; // ... } =Use with templates= C++03 does not provide templated typedefs. For instance, to have represent for every type one cannot use: template typedef std::pair stringpair; // Doesn't work However, if one is willing to accept in lieu of , then it is possible to achieve the desired result via a typedef within an otherwise unused templated class or struct: template class stringpair { private: // Prevent instantiation of \`stringpair\`. stringpair(); public: // Make \`stringpair::type\` represent \`std::pair\`. typedef std::pair type; }; // Declare a variable of type \`std::pair\`. stringpair::type my_pair_of_string_and_int; In C++11, templated typedefs are added with the following syntax, which requires the keyword rather than the keyword. (See template aliases.) template using stringpair = std::pair; // Declare a variable of type \`std::pair\`. stringpair my_pair_of_string_and_int; Other languages In SystemVerilog, typedef behaves exactly the way it does in C and C++. In many statically typed functional languages, like Haskell, Miranda, OCaml, etc., one can define type synonyms, which are the same as typedefs in C. An example in Haskell: type PairOfInts = (Int, Int) This example has defined a type synonym as an integer type. In Seed7 the definition of a constant type is used to introduce a synonym for a type: const type: myVector is array integer; In Swift, one uses the keyword to create a typedef: typealias PairOfInts = (Int, Int) C# contains a feature which is similar to the typedef or the syntax of C++.http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa664765(VS.71).aspx using newType = global::System.Runtime.Interop.Marshal; using otherType = Enums.MyEnumType; using StringListMap = System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary>; In D the keyword allows to create type or partial type synonyms. struct Foo(T){} alias FooInt = Foo!int; alias Fun = int delegate(int); Usage concerns Kernighan and Ritchie stated two reasons for using a typedef. First, it provides a means to make a program more portable or easier to maintain. Instead of having to change a type in every appearance throughout the program's source files, only a single typedef statement needs to be changed. size_t and ptrdiff_t in are such typedef names. Second, a typedef can make a complex definition or declaration easier to understand. Some programmers are opposed to the extensive use of typedefs. Most arguments center on the idea that typedefs simply hide the actual data type of a variable. For example, Greg Kroah-Hartman, a Linux kernel hacker and documenter, discourages their use for anything except function prototype declarations. He argues that this practice not only unnecessarily obfuscates code, it can also cause programmers to accidentally misuse large structures thinking them to be simple types.

Side of a phoropter that faces the patient A phoropter or refractor is an ophthalmic testing device. It is commonly used by eye care professionals during an eye examination, and contains different lenses used for refraction of the eye during sight testing, to measure an individual's refractive error and determine his or her eyeglass prescription.Dictionary.com, Definition of \\"phoropter\\", American Heritage Stedman's Medical Dictionary. Retrieved 10-10-10. It also is used to measure the patients' phorias and ductions, which are characteristics of binocularity. Typically, the patient sits behind the phoropter, and looks through it at an eye chart placed at optical infinity (20 feet or 6 metres), then at near (16 inches or 40 centimetres) for individuals needing reading glasses. The eye care professional then changes lenses and other settings, while asking the patient for subjective feedback on which settings gave the best vision. The patient's habitual prescription or an automated refractor may be used to provide initial settings for the phoropter. Sometimes a retinoscope is used through the phoropter to measure the vision without the patient having to speak, which is useful for infants and people who don't speak the language of the practitioner. Phoropters can also measure Heterophorias (natural resting position of the eyes), accommodative amplitudes, accommodative leads/lags, accommodative posture, horizontal and vertical vergences, and more. The American Optical Ultramatic RxMaster of 1967The major components of the phoropter are the battery of spherical and cylindrical lenses, auxiliary devices such as Maddox rods, filtered lenses, prisms, and the JCC (Jackson Cross-Cylinder) used for astigmatism measurement. The prismatic lenses are used to analyze binocular vision and treat orthoptic problems. From the measurements taken, the specialist will write an eyeglass prescription that contains at least 3 numerical specifications for each eye: sphere, cylinder, and axis, as well as pupillary distance (distance between eyes), and, rarely, prism for one or both eyes. The lenses within a phoropter refract light in order to focus images on the patient's retina. The optical power of these lenses is measured in 0.25 diopter increments. By changing these lenses, the examiner is able to determine the spherical power, cylindrical power, and cylindrical axis necessary to correct a person's refractive error. The presence of cylindrical power indicates the presence of astigmatism, which has an axis measured from 0 to 180 degrees away from being aligned horizontally. Phoropters are made with either plus or minus cylinders. Traditionally, ophthalmologists and orthoptists use plus cylinder phoropters and optometrists use minus cylinder phoropters. One can mathematically convert figures obtained from either type of phoropter to the other.  Trademark and origin of the term  Phoroptor is a registered trademark currently owned by Reichert Technologies, filed Apr 25, 1921 by DeZeng Standard of New Jersey, with the USPTO, serial number 71146698. The word was coined at that time for the newest version of their phoro-optometer. DeZeng was purchased in 1925 by American Optical of Massachusetts, which continued to market the product, but the term, often spelled phoropter, has become a genericised trademark for all brands of modern vision testers, especially since AO's main competitor, Bausch and Lomb, stopped making their Greens' Refractor in 1970s. Reichert bought AO's refracting equipment division in 1980s, and their current version is named \\"Ultramatic Rx Master Phoroptor\\".  History  The first phoropters. Top, the 1917 Woolf Ski-Optometer of New York City, with cylinder.; bottom, the 1917 DeZeng Phoro-Optometer model 570, Camden, NJ. The mounting arms on both devices attached at the bottom.The history of the phoropter, as a binocular refracting device which can also measure phorias, ductions, and other traits of binocularity, as distinct from the monocular optometer, which cannot, starts in the mid-1910s, with the introduction of the Ski-optometer by Nathan Shigon, and the Phoro-optometer by Henry DeZeng. These two inventions, as they continued to improve, were accompanied by a third device, the Greens' Refractor, which entered the market in 1934. European manufacturers were working on similar devices as well.\\"Phoroptors, Early American Instruments of Refraction, and Those Who Used Them\\", Gary L. Campbell O.D., 2008, Wheaton, Illinois. = Shigon/Woolf/Genothalmic/Shuron/BRU = In 1909, Nathan Shigon of New York City inventedUS Patent 979,578 Applied 1909 Patented 1910 a monocular optometer with a range of +0.25 to +6.00 diopters, consisting of a mechanism where a disc of low-powered lenses advanced a second disc of higher power lenses automatically with each rotation, as in a modern phoropter. There is no evidence this was ever manufactured, but in 1915 he filed for a patent for a binocular version of this same optometer,US Patent 1,270,336 Applied 1915 Patented 1918 and called it the Ski-Optometer, so named for its usefulness in doing skiascopy. This was manufactured by Wm. F. Reimold of Philadelphia. It included a Stevens Phorometer for measuring phorias, and a disc of auxiliary spherical lenses on the back, giving it a range of -12.00 to +12.00. To extend the range, there were clips on the front of each eye hole for the insertion of hand held sphere or cylinder trial lenses, with a mechanism to rotate the axis with the thumb. It weighed 2 lb. 3 oz. Around 1916 Michael Woolf, also of New York City, bought him out and added his own invention,US Patent 1,240,289 Applied 1916 Patented 1917 an innovative battery of cylinder lenses, ranging from -0.25 to -2.00, to the device, as well as Risley prisms for each eye. Maddox rods were optional. It weighed 3 lb. 13 oz. Around 1924 the patents and rights were transferred to General Optical Company of Mount Vernon, NY, which had been making a much larger, heavier and more solidly encased instrument, called the Genothalmic Refractor, since around 1920, using Woolf's 1917 patent number, and with a user's manual dated 1921. This instrument had a range of +17.75 to - 22.50, and up to -3.75 cylinder, Maddox rods, Risley prisms, and a Steven's phorometer. It weighed 7 pounds 5 ounces, and unlike all earlier devices of this kind, it hung from a horizontal mounting bar instead of being supported from the bottom. Like the Woolf, it had no Jackson cross-cylinders (JCC) at first, so a separate hand-held one was required. Late models of the Genothalmic were fitted with JCCs. General Optical sold out to Shuron Optical of Geneva, NY in 1927, which sold the refractor until the late 1930s. A refined and improved version of the Genothalmic Refractor was manufactured in London starting around 1932, and sold in the UK by S. R. Stearman, S. Pulzer & Son Ltd., and others, as the British Refracting Unit (B.R.U.). = DeZeng/American Optical/Reichert = The early DeZeng/AO lineage. Top row: Model No. 570, 1917 or earlier, No. 584, 1922. Bottom row: No. 589, 1934, No. 590, 1948.Also in 1909, Henry DeZeng got a patent for what looks remarkably like a modern phoropter,Patent 941,766, applied 1908, patented 1909 but the patent illustrations look nothing like the manufactured product, which was introduced around 1915--the DeZeng Phoro- Optometer model 570. This was a device produced in Camden, New Jersey, which contained a battery of convex lenses for each eye, a battery of concave lenses for each eye, and auxiliary lenses which gave it a total power range of +15.75 to -19.75, as well as a Maddox rod and Risley prism for each eye, and a Steven's phorometer. There were no cylindrical lenses, so testing for astigmatism required the use of manual trial-lenses, for which there were rotating holders on the front of each eye hole, and there were stationary ones on the backs as well. Cross-cylinders were optional, but they did not flip like a Jackson cross cylinder, they rotated in the same plane, so they were probably meant for the near point cross-cylinder test for reading.Meyrowitz Catalogue of Ophthalmic Equipment, 6th edition, New York City, 1920 It weighed 3 lb. 2 oz. Around 1920 an improved model, No. 574, was introduced, reduced in size but with the same range (lenses reduced from 1 inch to ¾ inch). The forehead rest was removed, and the rear trial lens clips were replaced with rubber eye guards. It weighed 2 lbs. 12 oz. In 1922, DeZeng replaced No. 574 with No. 584, and shortened the name to Phoroptor. This device became so popular that its name became genericized, though often spelled phoropter. The Phoroptor was smaller (lenses reduced again, to 9/16 inch diameter) and more precisely made than the 574, but with a similar power range, and the front clips for hand-held trial lenses were removed and replaced with batteries of cylinder lenses ranging from -0.25 to -4.75. The Steven's phorometer was dropped, and there were no Jackson cross cylinders. It weighed 2 lb. 8 oz. In 1925, American Optical bought DeZeng, and in 1927 introduced No. 588, the AO Wellsworth DeZeng Phoroptor, which was slightly larger; the lenses were increased to 11/16 inch and it weighed 3 lb. 2 oz. This was the first in the DeZeng/AO line to hang from a horizontal mounting bar, the earlier ones were supported from a bar below it. This phoroptor was unique in that it was calibrated in 1/8 diopter steps throughout its whole range. In 1934, AO introduced No. 589, the Additive Effective Power Phoroptor, once again enlarged and improved. The lenses were increased to ¾ inch diameter, the permanent size, and the unit was much more massive, with a weight of 7 lb. 9 oz., and with a range of +16.87 to -19.12 and -6.00 cylinder, with auxiliary lenses to increase these to +18.87/-21.12/-8.00. All these models resembled the original DeZeng model in design, but No. 590 of 1948 was a completely re- designed device, much larger and heavier, and more modern. It weighed 10 lbs. 7 oz. This was followed by another complete re-design in 1956, the RxMaster, which became the prototype of all modern phoropters, and was updated to the Ultramatic RxMaster in 1967, which is the current model. AO sold their phoroptor division to Reichert in 1982, who still makes the Ultramatic. = Greens'/Bausch and Lomb = What was available in 1934. Top left, the Genothalmic Refractor; top right, the AO 589 Phoroptor; bottom, the B&L; Greens' Refractor, still much in use today.In the early 20th century, ophthalmologists A. S. Green, L. D. Green, and M. I. Green, of San Francisco, CA, designed an optometer,Bauch and Lomb Greens' Refractor Reference Manual, date uncertain which they developed slowly over many years. The Greens teamed up with inventor Clyde L. Hunsicker of San Francisco, who applied for a patent on October 25, 1926. The title of their invention was simply an \\"optometrist instrument\\", and the text described it as an optometer. Patent 1,804,690 was granted to the Greens and Hunsicker in 1931, and sold to Bausch & Lomb (B&L;), which had them redesign it (patent 1,873,356, granted 1932). B&L; trademarked it as \\"Greens' Refractor\\" and introduced it in 1934. It was far more advanced than the competition in many ways. The power could be read right off the dial without having to do mental calculations, the range was far higher, from +19.75 to -28.00 and with cylinders up to -7.50, the battery of cylinders was much more intuitive and easy to use, and it was the first to have Jackson cross cylinders affixed, (the first AO Phoroptors with JCC's were late models of the Additive, and very late Genothalmic Refractors also had them). It weighed 13 lbs. 1 oz. The Greens' Refractor soon became the gold standard among eyecare professionals. It helped put the Woolf/Genothalmic/Shuron line out of the market and forced AO to completely redesign their phoroptor from scratch, not once, but twice, (the 590 failed to compete). The Greens' Refractor remained unchanged for over 4 decades, but sales slipped when AO introduced the Ultramatic RxMaster with its revolutionary yoked JCC in 1967, and production of the Greens' Refractor finally ended in the late 1970s. In 1978, B&L; introduced the Greens' II refractor with yoked JCC, but due to patent dispute lost it to AO, which discontinued it. As for the original Greens' Refractor, in spite of the fact that production stopped decades ago, many are still being used today, as they are virtually indestructible, and have a devoted rank of optometrists who swear by them.

The film stars Roger Duchesne as Bob. It is often considered a film noir and precursor to the French New Wave because of its use of handheld camera and a single jump cut. Plot Bob, a former bank robber and convict who has gone straight for 20 years, lives on his own as a gambler in the Montmartre district of Paris. He is well liked by the demi-monde community there, but has hit a run of bad luck and is nearly broke. Ever the gentleman, he lets an attractive young drifter called Anne stay in his flat in order to keep her from the attentions of Marc, a pimp he hates, and encourages his young protégé Paolo to become involved with her. Marc is arrested for beating up his wife, and accused of being a pump, but is released on condition he becomes an informer. Ledru, the police inspector who does this, owes an unrepayable debt of gratitude to Bob, who once saved his life. Through an ex-con who is now a croupier in the casino at Deauville, Bob and his safecracker friend Roger learn that by 5.00 in the morning at the height of the season the casino safe can hold 800 million in cash. Forming a plan to lift it, they find a backer to finance their preparations and recruit a team of professional criminals. The croupier gets them detailed floor plans, together with the specification of the safe. Paid in cash for this valuable information, he uses some of it to buy jewellery for his avaricious wife. In bed with Anne, the immature Paolo brags about the upcoming raid, news which she passes on to Marc, who tips off Ledru that he has valuable info to share. When Anne confesses what she has done, Paolo shoots Marc dead before he can get to Ledru. Meanwhile, the croupier's wife has wormed out the secret of her husband's new riches and decides to blackmail Bob but, unable to find him, tells the police. Ledru finds it hard to believe, as he thinks Bob is truly reformed, and after checking with the casino mounts a fruitless search for Bob, who is already on his way to Deauville. Ledru follows with a convoy of armed police. Bob's plan is to spend the time until 5:00 as a customer inside the casino, keeping an eye on things until the rest of the gang burst in with guns. After wandering around the tables for a while, he can't resist placing a bet. There follows the most incredible run of luck, in which he wins millions. Just before 5:00 he orders the staff to cash his huge pile of chips and bring the money to the front door. Arriving there on time, his gang are ambushed by the police and Paolo is killed in the ensuing gun battle. The handcuffed Bob is put into Ledru's car and the casino staff put his winnings in the trunk. It is strongly implied that his lucky streak will hold and he will get off with little or no jail time. Indeed, he quips, he may sue the police for damages – while the beautiful Anne waits for him at his apartment.

According to an interview the film cost 17.5 million French francs while CNC Censorship file indicates an estimate of 32 million French francs. Release Bob le flambeur was released in Paris on 24 April 1956. The film was Melville's lowest grossing at this point in his career. In Paris, the film took in 221,659 admissions and 716,920 admissions in France as a whole. Critical reception Vincent Canby, writing for The New York Times in 1981, noted \\"Melville's affection for American gangster movies may have never been as engagingly and wittily demonstrated as in Bob le Flambeur, which was only the director's fourth film, made before he had access to the bigger budgets and the bigger stars (Jean-Paul Belmondo, Alain Delon) of his later pictures. The film received positive reviews when re-released by Rialto Pictures in U.S. cinemas in 2001. It holds an approval rating of 97% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 30 reviews, with an average rating of 8.1/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \\"Majorly stylish, Bob le Flambeur is a cool homage to American gangster films and the presage to French New Wave mode of seeing.\\" Roger Ebert added the film to his Great Movies list in 2003. Remake Bob le flambeur influenced the two versions of the American film Ocean's Eleven (1960 and 2001) as well as Paul Thomas Anderson's Hard Eight, and was remade by Neil Jordan as The Good Thief in 2002.

Beppo marks Byron's first attempt at writing using the Italian ottava rima metre, which emphasized satiric digression. It is the precursor to Byron's most famous and generally considered best poem, Don Juan. Narrative The poem tells the story of a Venetian lady, Laura, whose husband, Giuseppe (or \\"Beppo\\" for short), has been lost at sea for the past three years. According to Venetian customs she takes on a Cavalier Servente, simply called \\"the Count\\". When the two of them attend the Venetian Carnival, she is closely observed by a Turk who turns out to be her missing husband. Beppo explains that he has been captured and enslaved, and was freed by a band of pirates that he subsequently joined. Having accumulated enough money he left piracy and returned to reclaim his wife and be re-baptized. Laura rejoins Beppo and befriends the Count. Analysis and allusions The poem's main merit lies in its comparison of English and Italian morals, arguing that the English aversion to adultery is mere hypocrisy in light of the probably shocking, but more honest, custom of the Cavalier Servente in Italy. In comparison to Byron's Oriental Tales of 1813, it suggests that a looser attitude towards morals may be more pragmatic. The poem manifests a number of typical Byronic qualities, like the digressive structure and the use of satirical jabs at targets familiar to Byron's readership, such as literate women and as well as other poets (including Robert Southey, who appears as \\"Botherby\\"). As he does in major poems like Childe Harold's Pilgrimage and Don Juan, in Beppo Byron mixes fictional elements with autobiographical ones.

These types of stelae were used to protect the ancient Egyptian people from dangerous animals such as crocodiles and snakes. The Magical Stela is one of the largest and most complete of this kind. It is theorized that in the reign of Nectanebo II, a priest named Esatum traveled to the burial place of the Mnevis bulls at Heliopolis. There he noticed certain inscriptions that he thought were interesting and ordered them to be copied onto a large block of stone. There the stela was created and stood for many years until Alexander the Great conquered the Persians in Egypt and it was brought to Alexandria. For over two thousand years, the stela was missing until it was discovered in a wall that was excavated in a Franciscan monastery. The stela was then presented to Austrian statesman, Prince Metternich in 1828 by Muhammad Ali Pasha, the ruler of Egypt, and Metternich had stored it in his Kynžvart Castle (in Bohemia) where the stela remained until 1950, being then purchased by the Metropolitan Museum of Art (where it was known for many years as the Metternich Stela). Construction The stela is a large block below, (a plinth) connected to a thinner block with a curved top. The dimensions are a height of 35 12/16 inch and a width of 13 ¼ inch. The piece was made from one huge block of fine grained, hard, gray-green stone made from greywacke. The stela is well preserved with only a few small visible chips. It seems to have been created with exact precision and care therefore making it a most intriguing and valuable addition to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The top portion of the stela portrays a disk of the sun that identifies Ra, the sun god of the ancient Egyptian religion. On each side of Ra are four baboons. On the far left of the baboons is the messenger god Thoth. On the far right of the baboons is the reigning pharaoh Nectanebo II bowing towards Ra. The main portion of the relief is separated from the top portion with five lines of hieroglyphs. The center of the stela portrays Horus as a child standing on crocodiles. Above his head is the face of the god Bes, who is the guardian of the newborn and childbirth. Horus is holding in each hand a serpent and scorpion, along with a lion and oryx in either hand. On the near left of Horus is the god Ra-Horakhty, which is the combination of the two sky gods Horus and Ra, standing on a serpent, and surrounding both of them are two divine symbols. On the far left of the relief is Horus's mother Isis standing upon a serpent, and on her left is the standard of the vulture goddess Nekhbet, patron of the south. On the far right is again the god Thoth standing on a serpent and on his right is the standard of the serpent goddess Wadjet, patron of the north. Above the gods are the eyes of Horus, the sun and the moon. The rest of the stela is covered with hieroglyphs from top to bottom and also on both sides. These hieroglyphs document the stories of the gods and their experiences with poisonous animals. There are also many curses and spells for different types of sickness caused by these animals. Another point of interest with the stela is on the upper portion of the reverse side. There is a winged man who represents the demonic solar god Harmeti. He is standing upon his enemies, which are evil animals enclosed in a circle to prevent their escape. Mythology The main function of the Metternich Stela was for the magical healing of poisons, mostly caused by animals. Water was poured over the Stela and collected. The water from the Stela was then drunk by the person suffering from the poisonous ailment. That person would identify with the child Horus who had also suffered such tragedies. During the entire process religious rites from the Stela were recited by local priests. The first few spells on the stela are related to reptiles and other harmful creatures. The most prominent was the serpent demon Apophis who was the enemy of Ra for he is the equivalent of the devil. The spell forced the serpent to decapitate and burn into pieces. The second half of the spell would force the serpent to vomit and while the priest recited this spell the person inflicted would also vomit freeing their body of the poison. The next spell was directed towards a cat. The cat contained a bit of a god or goddess and would be able to destroy any sort of poison. The spell asks for Ra to aid the cat in her time of need. Most of the Stela has inscriptions that describe stories such as the ones above in relation to being poisoned and spells to be cured. The most famous is the story of Isis and the Seven Scorpions. The story takes up the majority of the stela and is most referenced when it came to ailments dealing with poisons. Isis was the mother of Horus, along with his father Osiris who was the ruler of the living world. Osiris was killed by his brother Set who was incredibly jealous of his power. When Isis and Nephthys discovered this, they brought Osiris back to life with the use of magic. Set was enraged and so he killed Osiris once again, but this time he chopped up his body into many parts and scattered them throughout Egypt. Osiris then became the pharaoh of the dead and the underworld, while the land of the living was ruled by no one. Set was content thinking he would become the pharaoh of the living, but what he didn't know was that Isis was pregnant with Osiris's child. He would become pharaoh of the living because of his birthright. After Isis gave birth to Horus, it was thought that he would become the new pharaoh of the living, but once Set found out he became very angry. At this point the actual spell starts on the Magical Stela. Set had the child poisoned by a scorpion, which is often associated with the serpent demon, Apophis. Isis was outraged with grief at the death of her child. She called out to Ra and asked him for his aid. He sent Thoth who restored the child to life. From that point Ra would act as an advocate to Horus, just as his father Osiris would've done if alive. Horus lived but later fought Set to see who would become the pharaoh of the living. During the fight Set ripped out Horus's eye and won the battle. This is where the symbol 'the Eye of Horus' is from. Set then became the pharaoh of the living once again. Isis could not stand by and let this happen because her son was the rightful ruler. She went into the underworld disguised and sought out Set. She told him how an evil man took something from her son that was rightfully his. Set ordered to have this corrected, not knowing who she was referring to. Isis revealed herself to Set and he tried to recant, but Ra witnessed the event and made Horus the pharaoh of the living. The majority of the stela relates to how Horus was poisoned and cured. The ancient Egyptians would also use this cure for their own people who suffered from poisons. The sick would have the spirit of Horus within them and they would be cured just as Horus was. (Egyptian Art) The stories inscribed on this stela, especially the one regarding Isis and Horus are the most comprehensive found on any monument.

It held for about 20 years, until 1683, during which border skirmishing escalated to a full-scale war and culminated with the Ottoman's siege of Vienna for the second time. At the time of signing, the military of the Habsburgs was in a better position than that of the Ottomans. Instead of maintaining initiative and momentum, negotiations began and fighting stopped. In fact, Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor wanted peace to be signed so that he could be better prepared against France.Die Habsburger, Eine Europäische Familiengeschichte, Brigitte Vacha, Sonderausgabe 1996, p245 However, factions within the monarchy insisted on further operations, particularly Croats and Hungarians, mainly because most of their territory was in Ottoman hands, and they wanted to use the opportunity to reclaim their land. Noble Croatian families, the Zrinski and the Frankopan, viewed the treaty as particularly supplicating to the Ottomans, as they actually having to give up territories that had just been liberated back to the Ottomans as terms of the treaty. Some of the territories had belonged to them before the occupation. The treaty caused internal strife and instability in the monarchy, which would eventually culminate with the rebellion of the two Croatian noble families and Hungarian nobles led by Ferenc Rákóczi I against the king of Hungary (also Emperor to the German states in the monarchy). With the treaty, Ottoman control of Transylvania and Uyvar (administered as the Uyvar Eyalet of the Empire) was recognized, as well as both empires paying a financial tribute (presented as a \\"gift\\") to the other.The enemy at the gate, Andrew Wheatcroft That was the only time the French king, a traditional ally of the Ottomans since Francis I, fought against them. It was also one of the major factors in the Habsburgs' decision, as the much more valuable estates in the Holy Roman Empire and Italy were threatened by France. The concessions were very minor for the Austrians, as their emperor could now turn to western affairs. The Habsburgs also got some economic rights in the Ottoman realm.

It houses a museum, gallery and a number of memorial structures. The garden site of the massacre is located in the vicinity of the Golden Temple complex, the holiest shrine of Sikhism and is managed by the Jallianwala Bagh National Memorial Trust, which was established as per the 'Jallianwala Bagh National Memorial Act, 1951'.Jallianwala Bagh National Memorial Act. ACT NO. 25 OF 1951. 1st May, 1951. History Jallianwala Bagh or \\"the garden of the Jallah-man\\", with its well, implies that it was once green and flowering. Over the years it had become popular as a recreation ground and an area of rest for those visiting the nearby Golden temple. In 1919, it was a dried out plot stretched to seven acres and was surrounded by tightly packed multi-occupancy buildings divided by some narrow gullies and holding only one narrow entrance and exit route.Anand, Anita The Patient Assassin (2019). pp.99 It was unoccupied and surrounded by a wall. The place derives its name from that of the owner of this piece of land during the rule of the Sikh Empire. It was then the property of the family of Himmat Singh, who originally came from the village of Jalla district of the Punjab in India. The family were collectively known as Jallewalle. Background In 1919, in response to excluding Mahatma Gandhi from visiting Punjab, the secret deportation of Saifuddin Kitchlew and Satyapal on 10 April and the reactions to the Rowlatt Act, Punjab had witnessed attempts of Indians to gather and protest. On the morning of Vaisakhi, 13 April 1919, to the beat of military drums by the cities town criers, 19 locations around the city were read out Brigadier General R.E.H. Dyer's new rules. He had placed restrictions on leaving the city without a permit, banned all \\"processions of any kind\\"Anand, Anita The Patient Assassin (2019). pp.97-98 and any congregation of more than four people, and announced that \\"any person found in the streets after 8 pm will be shot\\". However, the announcements came on a background of noise and unusual heat, missing key locations around the city, meaning that the notice was not widely disseminated. Dyer was subsequently informed at 12.40 pm that day, that a political gathering was to be held at Jallianwala Bagh. One of the organisers was Hans Raj, who had accompanied Satyapal and Kitchlew just shy of their arrest and who later gave evidence in court as an approver.Wagner, Kim. Amritsar 1919 p.203 By 3.30 pm, 15 000 people had gathered, a mix of speakers, listeners, picnic makers and of men, women and children of all ages, including Sikhs, Hindus, Muslims and Christians. Dyer went with ninety Sikh, Gurkha, Baloch, Rajput troops from 2-9th Gurkhas, the 54th Sikhs and the 59th Sind Rifles and ordered them to fire towards the crowds. More than 1500 were wounded or killed. As a result, in 1920, a Trust was formed with the aim of creating a memorial at the massacre site. A number of the surrounding buildings were destroyed in the troubles of 1947. In 1951, the government of India established the site as a ‘memorial of national importance’. The entrance The entrance to Jallianwala Bagh is via a narrow passage, the same passage that was the only entry and exit point at the time of the massacre and the same route that General Dyer and his troops took to reach the grounds. At the entrance is a statue of Udham Singh. Once entered, some old trees can be seen in the garden with some buildings at the back. With the words 'Vande Mataram', a flame titled 'Amar Jyoti' is seen burning to the right under a domed meditation area. The portico pillars, just inside the garden, represent Dyer's soldiers. Memorials During the massacre, there were no escape routes. The narrow passage was blocked by the army and people either ran towards the walls or jumped in the well. The 'Martyrs Well' is surrounded by a large structure the Martyr's memorial, with a sign giving a figure of \\"120\\" as the number of bodies that were recovered from the well. It was designed by American architect Benjamin Polk and inaugurated in 1961. A number of the bullet holes in the walls are preserved. One of the walls with a number of bullet holes has a plaque reading: > The wall has its own historic significance as it has thirty-six bullet marks > which can be easily seen at present and these were fired into the crowd by > the order of General Dyer. Moreover, no warning was given to disperse before > Dyer opened fire which [sic] was gathered here against the Rowlatt Act. One > Thousand Six Hundred and Fifty Rounds were fired A number of other plaques are seen inside the garden, one of which reads: > This site is saturated with the blood of thousands of Indian patriots who > were martyred in a nonviolent struggle to free India from British > domination. General Dyer of the British army opened fire here on unarmed > people. Jallianwala Bagh is thus an everlasting symbol of non-violent & > peaceful struggle for the freedom of India The Flame of Liberty is represented by a central pylon. It is white and shaped like a flame. Engraved are faces of 'martyrs' and below are given their names. The Martyr's gallery and museum The Martyr's gallery contains a number of paintings including some of political leaders and a painting of the inside of Jallianwala Bagh, showing a number of people dead on the ground. The addition to the painting of the Gurkha's was painted in at a later date.Wagner, Kim. Amritsar 1919 p.264 A portrait of Udham Singh is on display in the gallery and his ashes are kept in the museum. Using newspaper clippings and letters from Mahatma Gandhi, Rabindranath Tagore and others, 45 panels depicting the Amritsar massacre are displayed. The Trust The initial Trustees of the Jallianwala Bagh National Memorial were named as *Jawaharlal Nehru *Saifuddin Kitchlew *Maulana Abul Kalam Azad *President of the Indian National Congress *Governor of the State of Punjab *Chief Minister of the State of Punjab *Three people nominated by the Central Government. In November 2019, The Jallianwala Bagh National Memorial (Amendment) Bill was passed by Parliament in an attempt to seek the removal of the President of the Indian National Congress as a trustee. Site visits Since the massacre, Jallianwala Bagh has been the site of a number of official and publicized visits. One of the earliest was during the public enquiry by the Indian Congress, when Jawaharlal Nehru visited the site in the immediate aftermath of the massacre. His investigation revealed 64 bullets in one part of the wall.Tharoor, Shashi. Nehru: The Invention of India. Arcade Publishing (2003). New York. First edition. p. 33. The site was visited by the Queen Elizabeth II in 1961, 1983 and 1997, and British Prime Minister David Cameron visited in 2013. During Prince William and Kate's official visit to India, Jallianwala Bagh was not on their itinerary. Others from Britain include Sadiq Khan, the Mayor of London in 2017, and Dominic Asquith and the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby in 2019. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the grounds in 2015 and politician Kiren Rijiju visited in 2016 as part of an Indo-Pak border visit. Proposed renovations to Jallianwala Bagh were presented to India’s vice president Venkaiah Naidu, the governor of Punjab V.P. Singh Badnore and other officials when they visited the site in April 2019 to attend a commemoration ceremony organised by the Ministry of Culture.Vice President Venkaiah Naidu remembers martyrs at Jallianwala Bagh memorial on 100th anniversary.

It was directed by Ron Shelton, written by Shelton and Robert Souza, and produced by Lou Pitt. The film is based on the true experiences of Souza, who was a homicide detective in the LAPD Hollywood Division and moonlighted as a real estate broker in his final ten years on the job. The film’s title sequence is done by Wayne Fitzgerald, which marks it as his final time doing a title sequence before his death in September 2019. Plot Sergeant Joe Gavilan is a financially strapped homicide detective with the Hollywood Division of the LAPD. He has been moonlighting as a real estate agent for seven years. His current partner is K. C. Calden, a much younger detective who teaches yoga on the side and wants to be an actor. The partners are investigating the murders of the four members of rap group \\"H2OClick\\", who were gunned down in a nightclub by two unidentified assailants. The detectives discover there was a witness who fled, and they work to track him down. They are distracted, failing to bond as partners, as Gavilan has to deal with a looming real estate deal that may be the key to getting out of debt, while Calden further pursues his dreams of acting by trying to be scouted by talent agents. Meanwhile, the manager of H2OClick, Antoine Sartain, has his head of security eliminate the two hitmen, who he had hired to kill H2OClick, and earlier a rapper named Klepto that Sartain also managed. Gavilan and Calden believe the murders are gang-related, but when Calden happens to see the bodies of the hitmen at the morgue, they conclude that the murders were orchestrated. The detectives also notice similarities that tie the H2OClick and Klepto homicides together. Gavilan learns from an undercover officer that the songwriter for H2OClick, a man named K-Ro, has gone missing, leading Gavilan to believe he is their murder witness. They struggle to track down K-Ro until they finally learn his real name, Oliver Robideaux, the son of former Motown singer Olivia Robideaux. Meanwhile, Internal Affairs Lieutenant Bernard \\"Bennie\\" Macko arrives at the station. Macko and Gavilan have a bad history, as Gavilan embarrassed Macko after proving him wrong on a case years ago. The animosity is compounded by the fact that Gavilan's latest love interest, a psychic named Ruby, used to date Macko. Macko is intent on ruining Gavilan, going so far as to try to frame him and place both detectives in interrogation. Instead, it only serves to help Gavilan and Calden strengthen their partnership. Gavilan offers to help Calden with the case of his father's death; Officer Danny Calden had been gunned down during a sting operation gone wrong, with his partner, Officer Leroy Wasley, being implicated but eventually released due to lack of evidence. The partners track down K-Ro to his home, where Olivia professes her son's innocence and that manager Sartain was the real culprit. Sartain had been embezzling money from Klepto, H2OClick and other clients for years. Klepto and H2OClick discovered this and threatened to hire lawyers to nullify their contracts, which led Sartain to have his head of security hire the hitmen as a \\"lesson\\" to all his clients. It also turns out that Wasley is Sartain's security chief, and that Macko is also in league with him. When the partners can't locate Sartain and Wasley, Gavilan enlists the help of Ruby. She uses her psychic power to lead the two detectives to a clothing store. Just then, Sartain and Wasley happened to drive by, and Gavilan and Calden follow in a wild car chase. The chase ends with the four men on foot, with the two partners chasing the two culprits in different directions. When Gavilan struggles with Sartain, Sartain ends up falling from the top of a building to his death. Wasley has drawn a gun on Calden and loudly brags about having killed his father. Calden utilizes his acting skills to distract Wasley, incapacitate him, and reveals he had a tape recorder on the whole time. Gavilan and Calden reunite as LAPD officers swarm the scene, but Macko appears and calls for the arrests of the two officers. Instead, Macko is arrested for his part in helping to cover up Sartain and Wasley's crimes. Gavilan and Ruby are seen attending a production of A Streetcar Named Desire, in which Calden is playing a lead role. It is implied that Gavilan successfully brokered the real estate deal, and Calden is giving his all in the pursuit of his acting dream. However, both of them receive calls from police headquarters and leave in the middle of the play, now solid partners. CastProduction The roles of Gavilan and Calden were previously given to John Travolta and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, respectively, before Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett eventually signed on. Throughout filming, Ford and Hartnett reportedly did not get along. Things apparently got so tense that the two wouldn't look each other in the eye when they're sharing scenes together with Ford calling Hartnett a \\"punk\\" while Hartnett responded by calling Ford an \\"old fart\\". They reportedly carried over the feud into the promotional tour for the film. Reception On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 30% based on 163 reviews, and an average rating of 4.71/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Hollywood Homicide suffers from too many subplots and not enough laughs.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 47 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews.\\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B\\" on an A+ to F scale. Michael O'Sullivan of the Washington Post wrote, \\"Hollywood Homicide is a buddy film starring two people who, even as the closing credits roll, appear to have just met\\" and added \\"every scene between them, and that's most every scene, feels like a screen test or, at best, a rehearsal.\\" One of the few major critics to give it a positive notice was Roger Ebert, who awarded the film 3 out of 4 stars and wrote \\"that it's more interested in its two goofy cops than in the murder plot; their dialogue redeems otherwise standard scenes.\\" =Box office= The film did not perform well at the box office as it ended up losing its $75 million budget. It opened at #5 and grossed $11,112,632 in the opening weekend, where it was led by Finding Nemo, which was in first place in its third weekend. The film wrapped up its box office run after 12 weeks, grossing $30,940,691 in Canada and the United States and $20,201,968 in other markets for a worldwide total of $51,142,659. Home media The film was released on VHS and DVD October 7, 2003. The DVD edition included a director's commentary and a theatrical trailer. In 2013, Mill Creek Entertainment released the film for the first time on Blu-ray in a 2 pack set with Hudson Hawk, without any extra features.

He has been called \\"one of the finest mathematicians of the nineteenth century\\".Lederman, p. 69. He was the father of Emmy Noether. Biography Max Noether was born in Mannheim in 1844, to a Jewish family of wealthy wholesale hardware dealers. His grandfather, Elias Samuel, had started the business in Bruchsal in 1797. In 1809 the Grand Duchy of Baden established a \\"Tolerance Edict\\", which assigned a hereditary surname to the male head of every Jewish family which did not already possess one. Thus the Samuels became the Noether family, and as part of this Christianization of names, their son Hertz (Max's father) became Hermann. Max was the third of five children Hermann had with his wife Amalia Würzburger.Dick, pp. 4–7. At 14, Max contracted polio and was afflicted by its effects for the rest of his life. Through self-study, he learned advanced mathematics and entered the University of Heidelberg in 1865. He served on the faculty there for several years, then moved to the University of Erlangen in 1888. While there, he helped to found the field of algebraic geometry.Lederman, pp. 69–71. In 1880 he married Ida Amalia Kaufmann, the daughter of another wealthy Jewish merchant family. Two years later they had their first child, named Amalia (\\"Emmy\\") after her mother. Emmy Noether went on to become a central figure in abstract algebra. In 1883 they had a son named Alfred, who later studied chemistry before dying in 1918. Their third child, Fritz, was born in 1884. Like Emmy, Fritz Noether also found prominence as a mathematician. Little is known about their fourth child, Gustav Robert, born in 1889. He suffered from continual illness and died in 1928.Dick, pp. 9–45. Noether served as an Ordinarius (full professor) at Erlangen for many years, and died there on 13 December 1921. Work on algebraic geometry Brill and Max Noether developed alternative proofs using algebraic methods for much of Riemann's work on Riemann surfaces. Brill–Noether theory went further by estimating the dimension of the space of maps of given degree d from an algebraic curve to projective space Pn. In birational geometry, Noether introduced the fundamental technique of blowing up in order to prove resolution of singularities for plane curves. Noether made major contributions to the theory of algebraic surfaces. Noether's formula is the first case of the Riemann-Roch theorem for surfaces. The Noether inequality is one of the main restrictions on the possible discrete invariants of a surface. The Noether-Lefschetz theorem (proved by Lefschetz) says that the Picard group of a very general surface of degree at least 4 in P3 is generated by the restriction of the line bundle O(1). Noether and Castelnuovo showed that the Cremona group of birational automorphisms of the complex projective plane is generated by the \\"quadratic transformation\\" : [x,y,z] ↦ [1/x, 1/y, 1/z] together with the group PGL(3,C) of automorphisms of P2. Even today, no explicit generators are known for the group of birational automorphisms of P3.

History  Venice High School was built in the late 1940s in Nokomis, a short distance north of Venice. The high school (grades 6–8) opened in 1956 with John E. Davis as its first principal. Venice Junior High (grades 7–9) opened sometime in 1959 when the student body outgrew the high school. Guy Rose served as the first Vice Principal under Davis and was in charge of the Junior High. The original buildings remained mostly unchanged until 2012 when the high school and junior high were demolished (the original gymnasium and Powell–Davis Stadium remained) to build the facility that exists today. The campus was completed in 2014 including a new music suite housing the chorus and band and a city-mandated performing arts center. In 2006, Venice High School was named an \\"A\\" school by the Florida Department of Education. In 2007, the school missed the 525 points needed for an \\"A\\" grade by 4 points receiving a score of 521 to earn a \\"B\\" grade. The school has increased its graduation rate from 63.9% in 1999 to 84.7% in 2007. Its dropout rate is 1.6%. Venice is known for its athletics programs, including state championships in volleyball (1998, 2005, 2012, 2014, 2018) and baseball (2007, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2018, 2019). Venice's football program, coached by John Peacock, has been recognized as one of the best teams in the state, making several state championship appearances since their first in 2000 (7th in nation) and winning a second in 2017. Venice High School has more than 2000 students located on the island of Venice.  Programs  Featured programs include Career Technical Education: PC Support, Health Options, Digital Design, Early Childhood, Culinary Arts, Engineering and Business Entrepreneurial pathways. Venice High School offers the International Baccalaureate (IB) Program which is an academically focused curriculum for students ages sixteen to eighteen (grades 11 and 12) preparing to enter university. Unique to Venice High School is the Rotary Futures Program which assists students with postsecondary planning, college applications, and scholarship acquisition. This program has obtained millions of scholarship dollars for Venice High School seniors.

Student body  As of 2016, the school principal is Eric Jackson, a former administrator at Riverview High School. Venice High School enrolls over 2,000 students annually, in contrast to the state average of 750 for K12 schools. Of those in attendance in 2005, 95% of the student body is Caucasian, 2% Hispanic, and 1% Asian and 1% African American. The school also has a significantly lower percentage of students eligible for the free or reduced lunch program compared to the state, 18% compared to 45.4%.

Their name is derived from the expression \\"a diamond in the rough\\" (meaning a valuable find in an unexpected location), as the members of the stable are wrestlers who Diamond regards as having unlocked potential. Though Simon Diamond constantly claimed that he would lead the Diamonds to success, they had a poor win/loss ratio. History The Diamonds were formed at TNA Slammiversary on June 19, 2005 when Simon Diamond returned to TNA after a several month absence, introducing Trytan as his \\"insurance policy\\". Diamond and Trytan then defeated Apolo and Sonny Siaki in a tag match. The Diamonds next appeared on the July 1 episode of TNA Impact!, where Diamond boasted that, as he had recruited a \\"wrecking machine\\", he had \\"all of the answers\\". Diamond and Trytan lost to America's Most Wanted after they were outmaneuvered by the veteran tag team. On July 15 they defeated Apolo and Siaki in a Slammiversary rematch. Trytan left TNA in July 2005 after he could not agree on a new contract with TNA, and at TNA No Surrender 2005 on July 17, Diamond introduced his new protégé, David Young. Citing Young's ability to \\"bench press \\", Diamond insisted that Young's two year losing streak was due to a lack of direction and leadership, which Diamond would provide. This is where the name of the stable originated, as Diamond hailed David Young as a \\"diamond in the rough\\". Diamond and Young then faced Apolo and Sonny Siaki in a near-rematch from Slammiversary, with Young losing to Apolo following a TKO. In the main event of the August 5 episode of Impact!, Diamond and Young faced NWA World Heavyweight Champion Raven and Sabu. Young was pinned after receiving a Raven Effect DDT from Raven and a splash from Sabu, while Diamond watched from outside the ring, disgruntled at Young's inability to kick out. The Diamonds faced America's Most Wanted once more on August 12, and defeated them after Team Canada interfered. At the outset of Sacrifice on August 10, Diamond came to the ring and talked about the career of Elix Skipper, claiming that he had been \\"a star\\" as one-third of Triple X, but that he had been \\"a lost soul\\" since XXX disbanded. Diamond then promised to make Skipper \\"a star again\\". Diamond, Young and Skipper then faced Chris Sabin, Sonjay Dutt and Shark Boy in a six man tag match. The Diamonds lost after Skipper was rolled- up by Sabin, and Diamond berated his team as a result. Diamond teamed with Mikey Batts on the August 19 episode of Impact!, facing Shocker and Chris Sabin in the first round of the Chris Candido Cup. During the match, commentators Mike Tenay and Don West speculated that Batts was \\"auditioning\\" for membership in the Diamonds in the Rough. Diamond and Batts lost the match after Sabin pinned Batts, and he did not join the Diamonds. On the August 26 episode of Impact!, Diamond and Young defeated the regular tag team of Mikey Batts and Jerrelle Clark, with Young pinning Clark following a spinebuster. Later in the program, Diamond accompanied Skipper to ringside, and watched in disappointment as his protégé lost to Apolo. On the September 9 episode of Impact!, Skipper defeated Sonjay Dutt following interference from Young. At Unbreakable on September 11, the Diamonds lost to the 3Live Kru in a six man tag team match. The stable was inactive throughout the remainder of September and early October as Diamond toured India to promote the debut of Impact! on ESPN Star Sports, but reconvened on October 23 at TNA Bound for Glory, where they defeated Siaki, Apolo and Shark Boy. On a special two-hour episode of Impact! on November 3, the Diamonds lost to Sabu, Lance Hoyt and Jeff Hardy in a six man tag team match. At Genesis on November 13 they defeated Hoyt and The Naturals, with Skipper pinning Chase Stevens. On the December 4 episode of Impact!, all three members of the Diamonds were announced as Raven's opponents in a handicap Raven's House of Fun match booked by Director of Authority Larry Zbyszko to encourage Raven to resign from TNA. Despite interference on his behalf by Cassidy Riley, Raven was decisively beaten after the Diamonds drove him through a table and then pinned him. On a prime time episode of Impact! on December 8, 2005, the Diamonds interrupted a ceremony in which Chicago White Sox catcher A. J. Pierzynski and strength trainer Dale Torborg presented TNA wrestlers A.J. Styles, Chris Sabin and Sonjay Dutt with memorabilia from the 2005 World Series. Diamond, himself a former baseball player, mocked Pierzynski's .256 batting average, telling him that he needed a designated hitter. Diamond then slapped Torborg, leading to a brawl. As a result, Torborg, Sabin and Dutt, with Pierzynski in their corner, faced the Diamonds at TNA Turning Point 2005 on December 11. The Diamonds lost following interference from then-Boston Red Sox outfielder Johnny Damon. In the main event of the December 17 episode of Impact!, Young and Skipper were defeated by Team 3D. At TNA Final Resolution 2006 on January 15 they were defeated by The James Gang. At TNA Against All Odds 2006 on February 12, 2006, Skipper and Young teamed with Shannon Moore, losing to Lance Hoyt, Cassidy Riley and Shark Boy in a six man tag team match. At TNA Destination X 2006 on March 12, 2006, Skipper and Young defeated Norman Smiley and Shark Boy. On the March 11, 2006 episode of Impact!, Diamond, providing commentary during an eight man tag team bout featuring Skipper and Young, complained about Pierzynski having been presented with a replica belt by TNA. One week later, Diamond, accompanied by Alex Shelley and his \\"ShelleyCam\\", attended the White Sox spring training in order to confront Pierzynski. Pierzynski challenged Diamond to a fight, but he was struck from behind with a chair by manager Ozzie Guillén before he could give his response. On April 23, 2006 at TNA Lockdown 2006, Skipper took part in a six man \\"Xscape\\" match that was won by Chris Sabin. On July 16, 2006 at TNA Victory Road 2006, the team returned to action (after a month-long hiatus from TNA) losing to The Naturals in a tag match. In late February 2007, David Young and \\"Primetime\\" Elix Skipper were both released from their TNA Contracts. Simon Diamond remained with the company as a road agent until his release on November 2, 2008. Young went on to revive the Diamonds in the Rough team name in 2010, while teaming with Sigmon on the Midwest independent circuit.

He had played in the requisite number of matches to qualify for a medal, as had Joe McBride and Charlie Gallagher. Celtic reached the European Cup final for the second time in 1970, after they defeated English champions Leeds United in both legs of the semi-final. In the first leg, Celtic beat Leeds 1–0 at Elland Road with a goal from George Connelly. The second leg, which was played at Hampden Park in front of almost 140,000 people, was won 2–1 by Celtic.

It is part of the Barony of Raphoe. It is situated on the Burn Dale (also known as the Burn Deele), and is located on the R236 road to Raphoe. Convoy had a total population of 1,526 according to the 2016 census. Like many other villages in the vicinity, it has its origins in the Plantation of Ulster. Convoy is home to a mixed religious community which is reflected in the schools and churches in the village. There is a Catholic and a mixed primary school in the village. There is also a Catholic church (popularly known as 'the Chapel'), a Church of Ireland church and a Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster church or 'kirk' (which was opened by the Church's founder, The Rev. Ian Paisley) in the village. There are no secondary schools in Convoy and local children tend to travel to Raphoe or Stranorlar for second-level education. The Burn Dale (Irish: An Daoil; also spelt in English as the Burn Deele) is a burn (a small river) that flows along the southern edge of Convoy. Convoy Woollen Mill Convoy once had a woollen mill located on the banks of the Burn Dale (also spelt as the Burn Deele), but this closed in the early 1980s with the resultant loss of many local jobs. The woollen mill is now host to a business area that was promoted and assisted by the Republic of Ireland's former state development body FÁS. Convoy House The Montgomery family of Convoy is descended from Alexander Montgomery, Prebendary of Doe, who died about 1658. He was brought over from Scotland by his kinsman, George Montgomery, who became the first Protestant Bishop of Raphoe in 1604. Alexander Montgomery of Croaghan, near Lifford, bought the Convoy estate from the Nesbitt family in 1719. Boyton House was first occupied in November 1807 by the family of Robert Montgomery of Brandrim who had inherited the estate from his cousin, Sandy Montgomery of Convoy. Sandy represented Donegal in Grattan's Parliament for thirty-two years. He spent part of his youth in America and was noted for his duelling. His brothers were John of Lisbon and Richard, a general in Washington’s army who fell at the siege of Quebec in 1775. Sandy was a friend of Lord Edward Fitzgerald and a secret supporter of the United Irishmen. He voted against the Act of Union in 1800. Boyton House used to contain the letter which Washington wrote to the family on Richard’s death and receipts for meat bought by thehundred-weight in Raphoe by the Montgomery family for free distribution in Convoy during the Famine. The house passed through marriage to the Boyton family in the nineteenth century. Transport There are daily Bus Éireann buses serving Convoy which go to such places as Derry, Letterkenny and Strabane several times a day. Convoy railway station opened on 1 January 1909, and closed on 1 January 1960. The nearest railway station is operated by Northern Ireland Railways and runs from Waterside Station in Derry, via Coleraine, to Belfast Central railway station and Belfast Great Victoria Street railway station. The strategically important Belfast-Derry railway line is to be upgraded to facilitate more frequent trains and improvements to the permanent way such as track and signalling to enable faster services. Sport Convoy is to be the proposed site of the Donegal GAA centre of excellence, it is set to be completed by the end of 2013. Seán Dunnion, chairman of the county board said of the centre: “The benefits that can be accrued out of it will be huge to our footballers, our hurlers, our ladies, our camogie players, our schools…the benefits to everyone will be immense.” Naomh Mhuire Conmhaigh is the local GAA club. Founded in 1928 the club caters for players both male and female at all age levels in football. The players come from the villages of Convoy, Drumkeen and Raphoe with the pitch located in Convoy. They have a long and distinguished history having won many junior titles. Convoy has a local amateur soccer team, Convoy Arsenal. The club were Donegal Junior League winners in 2003, won the Division One title in 2004 and were runners-up in the Premier Division in 2005. On the back of that success, Convoy Arsenal joined the Ulster Senior League in 2005. As well as catering for the more senior players from the area, they presently have teams in the Donegal Saturday League in the under-8, under-10, under-12, under-14 and under-16 grades.

Photochromism is the reversible transformation of a chemical species between two forms by the absorption of electromagnetic radiation (photoisomerization), where the two forms have different absorption spectra.Heinz Durr and Henri Bouas-Laurent Photochromism: Molecules and Systems, In plain language, this can be described as a reversible change of colour upon exposure to light. ApplicationsSunglasses= One of the most famous reversible photochromic applications is color changing lenses for sunglasses, as found in eyeglasses. The largest limitation in using photochromic technology is that the materials cannot be made stable enough to withstand thousands of hours of outdoor exposure so long-term outdoor applications are not appropriate at this time. The switching speed of photochromic dyes is highly sensitive to the rigidity of the environment around the dye. As a result, they switch most rapidly in solution and slowest in the rigid environment like a polymer lens. In 2005 it was reported that attaching flexible polymers with low glass transition temperature (for example siloxanes or poly(butyl acrylate)) to the dyes allows them to switch much more rapidly in a rigid lens. Some spirooxazines with siloxane polymers attached switch at near solution-like speeds even though they are in a rigid lens matrix. =Supramolecular chemistry= Photochromic units have been employed extensively in supramolecular chemistry. Their ability to give a light- controlled reversible shape change means that they can be used to make or break molecular recognition motifs, or to cause a consequent shape change in their surroundings. Thus, photochromic units have been demonstrated as components of molecular switches. The coupling of photochromic units to enzymes or enzyme cofactors even provides the ability to reversibly turn enzymes \\"on\\" and \\"off\\", by altering their shape or orientation in such a way that their functions are either \\"working\\" or \\"broken\\". =Data storage= The possibility of using photochromic compounds for data storage was first suggested in 1956 by Yehuda Hirshberg. Since that time, there have been many investigations by various academic and commercial groups, particularly in the area of 3D optical data storage which promises discs that can hold a terabyte of data. Initially, issues with thermal back-reactions and destructive reading dogged these studies, but more recently more-stable systems have been developed. =Novelty items= Reversible photochromics are also found in applications such as toys, cosmetics, clothing and industrial applications. If necessary, they can be made to change between desired colors by combination with a permanent pigment. =Solar energy storage= Researchers at the Center for Exploitation of Solar Energy at the University of Copenhagen Department of Chemistry are studying, the Photochromic Dihydroazulene–Vinylheptafulvene System, for possible application to harvest solar energy and store it for significant amounts of time. Although storage lifetimes are attractive, for a real device it must of course be possible to trigger the back-reaction, which calls for further iterations in the future. History Photochromism was discovered in the late 1880s, including work by Markwald, who studied the reversible change of color of 2,3,4,4-tetrachloronaphthalen-1(4H)-one in the solid state. He labeled this phenomenon \\"phototropy\\", and this name was used until the 1950s when Yehuda Hirshberg, of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel proposed the term \\"photochromism\\".Prof. Mordechai Folman 1923 - 2004 Photochromism can take place in both organic and inorganic compounds, and also has its place in biological systems (for example retinal in the vision process). Overview Photochromism does not have a rigorous definition, but is usually used to describe compounds that undergo a reversible photochemical reaction where an absorption band in the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum changes dramatically in strength or wavelength. In many cases, an absorbance band is present in only one form. The degree of change required for a photochemical reaction to be dubbed \\"photochromic\\" is that which appears dramatic by eye, but in essence there is no dividing line between photochromic reactions and other photochemistry. Therefore, while the trans-cis isomerization of azobenzene is considered a photochromic reaction, the analogous reaction of stilbene is not. Since photochromism is just a special case of a photochemical reaction, almost any photochemical reaction type may be used to produce photochromism with appropriate molecular design. Some of the most common processes involved in photochromism are pericyclic reactions, cis-trans isomerizations, intramolecular hydrogen transfer, intramolecular group transfers, dissociation processes and electron transfers (oxidation- reduction). Another requirement of photochromism is two states of the molecule should be thermally stable under ambient conditions for a reasonable time. All the same, nitrospiropyran (which back-isomerizes in the dark over ~10 minutes at room temperature) is considered photochromic. All photochromic molecules back-isomerize to their more stable form at some rate, and this back- isomerization is accelerated by heating. There is therefore a close relationship between photochromic and thermochromic compounds. The timescale of thermal back-isomerization is important for applications, and may be molecularly engineered. Photochromic compounds considered to be \\"thermally stable\\" include some diarylethenes, which do not back isomerize even after heating at 80 C for 3 months. Since photochromic chromophores are dyes, and operate according to well-known reactions, their molecular engineering to fine-tune their properties can be achieved relatively easily using known design models, quantum mechanics calculations, and experimentation. In particular, the tuning of absorbance bands to particular parts of the spectrum and the engineering of thermal stability have received much attention. Sometimes, and particularly in the dye industry, the term \\"irreversible photochromic\\" is used to describe materials that undergo a permanent color change upon exposure to ultraviolet or visible light radiation. Because by definition photochromics are reversible, there is technically no such thing as an \\"irreversible photochromic\\"—this is loose usage, and these compounds are better referred to as \\"photochangable\\" or \\"photoreactive\\" dyes. Apart from the qualities already mentioned, several other properties of photochromics are important for their use. These include quantum yield, fatigue resistance, photostationary state, and polarity and solubility. The quantum yield of the photochemical reaction determines the efficiency of the photochromic change with respect to the amount of light absorbed. The quantum yield of isomerization can be strongly dependent on conditions. In photochromic materials, fatigue refers to the loss of reversibility by processes such as photodegradation, photobleaching, photooxidation, and other side reactions. All photochromics suffer fatigue to some extent, and its rate is strongly dependent on the activating light and the conditions of the sample. Photochromic materials have two states, and their interconversion can be controlled using different wavelengths of light. Excitation with any given wavelength of light will result in a mixture of the two states at a particular ratio, called the photostationary state. In a perfect system, there would exist wavelengths that can be used to provide 1:0 and 0:1 ratios of the isomers, but in real systems this is not possible, since the active absorbance bands always overlap to some extent. In order to incorporate photochromics in working systems, they suffer the same issues as other dyes. They are often charged in one or more state, leading to very high polarity and possible large changes in polarity. They also often contain large conjugated systems that limit their solubility. =Photochromic complexes= A photochromic complex is a kind of chemical compound that has photoresponsive parts on its ligand. These complexes have a specific structure: photoswitchable organic compounds are attached to metal complexes. For the photocontrollable parts, thermally and photochemically stable chromophores (azobenzene, diarylethene, spiropyran, etc.) are usually used. And for the metal complexes, a wide variety of compounds that have various functions (redox response, luminescence, magnetism, etc.) are applied. The photochromic parts and metal parts are so close that they can affect each other's molecular orbitals. The physical properties of these compounds shown by parts of them (i.e., chromophores or metals) thus can be controlled by switching their other sites by external stimuli. For example, photoisomerization behaviors of some complexes can be switched by oxidation and reduction of their metal parts. Some other compounds can be changed in their luminescence behavior, magnetic interaction of metal sites, or stability of metal-to-ligand coordination by photoisomerization of their photochromic parts. Classes of photochromic materials Photochromic molecules can belong to various classes: triarylmethanes, stilbenes, azastilbenes, nitrones, fulgides, spiropyrans, naphthopyrans, spiro-oxazines, quinones and others. =Spiropyrans and spirooxazines= Spiro-mero photochromism. One of the oldest, and perhaps the most studied, families of photochromes are the spiropyrans. Very closely related to these are the spirooxazines. For example, the spiro form of an oxazine is a colorless leuco dye; the conjugated system of the oxazine and another aromatic part of the molecule is separated by a sp³-hybridized \\"spiro\\" carbon. After irradiation with UV light, the bond between the spiro-carbon and the oxazine breaks, the ring opens, the spiro carbon achieves sp² hybridization and becomes planar, the aromatic group rotates, aligns its π-orbitals with the rest of the molecule, and a conjugated system forms with ability to absorb photons of visible light, and therefore appear colorful. When the UV source is removed, the molecules gradually relax to their ground state, the carbon-oxygen bond reforms, the spiro-carbon becomes sp³ hybridized again, and the molecule returns to its colorless state. This class of photochromes in particular are thermodynamically unstable in one form and revert to the stable form in the dark unless cooled to low temperatures. Their lifetime can also be affected by exposure to UV light. Like most organic dyes they are susceptible to degradation by oxygen and free radicals. Incorporation of the dyes into a polymer matrix, adding a stabilizer, or providing a barrier to oxygen and chemicals by other means prolongs their lifetime.G. Baillet, G. Giusti et R.

Guglielmetti, Study of the fatigue process and the yellowing of polymeric films containing spirooxazine photochromic compounds, Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn., 68 (1995) 1220-1225 =Diarylethenes= Dithienylethene photochemistry. The \\"diarylethenes\\" were first introduced by Irie and have since gained widespread interest, largely on account of their high thermodynamic stability. They operate by means of a 6-pi electrocyclic reaction, the thermal analog of which is impossible due to steric hindrance. Pure photochromic dyes usually have the appearance of a crystalline powder, and in order to achieve the color change, they usually have to be dissolved in a solvent or dispersed in a suitable matrix. However, some diarylethenes have so little shape change upon isomerization that they can be converted while remaining in crystalline form. =Azobenzenes= Azobenzene photoisomerization. The photochromic trans-cis isomerization of azobenzenes has been used extensively in molecular switches, often taking advantage of its shape change upon isomerization to produce a supramolecular result. In particular, azobenzenes incorporated into crown ethers give switchable receptors and azobenzenes in monolayers can provide light-controlled changes in surface properties. =Photochromic quinones= Some quinones, and phenoxynaphthacene quinone in particular, have photochromicity resulting from the ability of the phenyl group to migrate from one oxygen atom to another. Quinones with good thermal stability have been prepared, and they also have the additional feature of redox activity, leading to the construction of many- state molecular switches that operate by a mixture of photonic and electronic stimuli. =Inorganic photochromics= Many inorganic substances also exhibit photochromic properties, often with much better resistance to fatigue than organic photochromics. In particular, silver chloride is extensively used in the manufacture of photochromic lenses. Other silver and zinc halides are also photochromic. Yttrium oxyhydride is another inorganic material with photochromic properties. =Photochromic coordination compounds= Photochromic coordination complexes are relatively rare in comparison to the organic compounds listed above. There are two major classes of photochromic coordination compounds. Those based on sodium nitroprusside and the ruthenium sulfoxide compounds. The ruthenium sulfoxide complexes were created and developed by Rack and coworkers. The mode of action is an excited state isomerization of a sulfoxide ligand on a ruthenium polypyridine fragment from S to O or O to S. The difference in bonding from between Ru and S or O leads to the dramatic color change and change in Ru(III/II) reduction potential. The ground state is always S-bonded and the metastable state is always O-bonded.Typically, absorption maxima changes of nearly 100 nm are observed. The metastable states (O-bonded isomers) of this class often revert thermally to their respective ground states (S-bonded isomers), although a number of examples exhibit two-color reversible photochromism. Ultrafast spectroscopy of these compounds has revealed exceptionally fast isomerization lifetimes ranging from 1.5 nanoseconds to 48 picoseconds.

Pre-Columbian art thrived throughout the Americas from at least 13,000 BCE to the European conquests, and sometimes continued for a time afterwards. Many Pre-Columbian cultures did not have writing systems, so visual art expressed cosmologies, world views, religion, and philosophy of these cultures, as well as serving as mnemonic devices. These cultures produced a wide variety of visual arts, including painting on textiles, hides, rock and cave surfaces, bodies especially faces, ceramics, architectural features including interior murals, wood panels, and other available surfaces.  Overall Themes Among Pre- Columbian Art  For many of these cultures, the visual arts went beyond physical appearance and served as active extensions of their owners and indices of the divine. As spirituality was very prevalent among pre-columbian cultures, themes of the deities and ritual worship were often the subjects of artwork. Artisans of the Ancient Americas drew upon a wide range of materials (obsidian, gold, spondylus shells), creating objects that included the meanings held to be inherent to the materials. These cultures often derived value from the physical qualities, rather than the imagery, of artworks, prizing aural and tactile features, the quality of workmanship, and the rarity of materials. Various works of art have been discovered large distances from their location of production, indicating that many Pre-Columbian civilizations interacted amongst each other. Moreover, many societies used raw materials not available in the geographic location in which they were situated, suggesting difficulty of acquisition as a source of value. Unfortunately, many of the perishable surfaces, such as woven textiles, typically have not been preserved, but Precolumbian painting on ceramics, walls, and rocks have survived more frequently. Mesoamerica and Central America The Mesoamerican cultures are generally divided into three periods (see Mesoamerican chronology): *Pre-classic (up to 200 CE) *Classic (ca. 200–900 CE) *Post- classic (ca. 900 to 1580 CE). The Pre-classic period was dominated by the highly developed Olmec civilization, which flourished around 1200–400 BCE. The Olmecs produced jade figurines, and created heavy-featured, colossal heads, up to high, that still stand mysteriously in the landscape. The Mesoamerican tradition of building large ceremonial centres appears to have begun under the Olmecs. During the Classic period the dominant Civilization was the Maya. Maya royalty commissioned artwork that commemorated their achievements and secured their place in time. Scenes depicting various rituals and historical events are embedded with hieroglyphic text to enable the viewer to identify the important figures, times and places instead of relying upon physical features that could be forgotten over time. The interpretation of the actions represented in the artwork goes hand in hand with understanding the decorative text that is woven into the picture. Unlocking this hieroglyphic text is vital as it removes anonymity and mystery from the scenes and reveals detailed records of those who held power throughout the timeline of the civilization. Like the Mississippian peoples of North America such as the Choctaw and Natchez, the Maya organized themselves into large, agricultural communities. They practised their own forms of hieroglyphic writing and even advanced astronomy. Mayan art consequently focuses on rain, agriculture, and fertility, expressing these images mainly in relief and surface decoration, as well as some sculpture. Glyphs and stylized figures were used to decorate architecture such as the pyramid temple of Chichén Itzá. Murals dating from about 750 CE were discovered when the city of Bonampak was excavated in 1946. The Post- classic period (10th–12th centuries) was dominated by the Toltecs who made colossal, block-like sculptures such as those employed as free-standing columns at Tula, Mexico. The Mixtecs developed a style of painting known as Mixtec-Puebla, as seen in their murals and codices (manuscripts), in which all available space is covered by flat figures in geometric designs. The Aztec culture in Mexico produced some dramatically expressive artworks, such as the decorated skulls of captives and stone sculpture, of which Tlazolteotl (Woods Bliss Collection, Washington), a goddess in childbirth, is a good example. Aztec art, similar to other Mesoamerican cultures also focused on deity worship and portraying values in their society. In creating their art, Aztecs also were interested in naturalism, as making something life-like better conveyed their message through the artwork. For example, the Eagle Warrior statues are life-sized ceramic sculptures that show this sense of naturalism. The Aztecs believed these eagle warriors showed the value of youthful beauty, this can be seen in the sculpture with the Warriors young and soft features of his face. Miller, Mary Ellen (2019).

The Chavín produced small-scale pottery, often human in shape but with animal features such as bird feet, reptilian eyes, or feline fangs. Representations of jaguar are a common theme in Chavín art. The Chavin culture is also noted for the spectacular murals and carvings found its main religious site of Chavín de Huantar; these works include the Raimondi Stele, the Lanzón, and the Tello Obelisk. Contemporary with the Chavín was the Paracas culture of the southern coast of Peru, most noted today for their elaborate textiles. These amazing productions, some of which could measure ninety feet long, were primarily used for as burial wraps for Paracas mummy bundles. Paracas art was greatly influenced by the Chavín cult, and the two styles share many common motifs. On the south coast, the Paracas were immediately succeeded by a flowering of artistic production around the Nazca river valley. The Nazca period is divided into eight ceramic phases, each one depicting increasingly abstract animal and human motifs. These period range from Phase 1, beginning around 200 CE, to Phase 8, which declined in the middle of the eighth century. The Nasca people are most famous for the Nazca Lines, though they are usually regarded as making some of the most beautiful polychrome ceramics in the Andes. On the north coast, the Moche succeeded the Chavín. The Moche flourished about 100–800 CE, and were among the best artisans of the Pre-Columbian world, producing delightful portrait vases (Moche ware), which, while realistic, are steeped in religious references, the significance of which is now lost. For the Moche, ceramics functioned as a primary way of disseminating information and cultural ideas. The Moche made ceramic vessels that depicted and re-created a plethora of objects: fruits, plants, animals, human portraits, gods, demons, as well as graphic depictions of sexual acts. The Moche are also noted for their metallurgy (such as that found in the tomb of the Lord of Sipán), as well as their architectural prowess, such as the Huaca de la Luna and the Huaca del Sol in the Moche River valley. Following the decline of the Moche, two large co-existing empires emerged in the Andes region. In the north, the Wari (or Huari) Empire, based in their capital city of the same name. The Wari are noted for their stone architecture and sculpture accomplishments, but their greatest proficiency was ceramic. The Wari produced magnificent large ceramics, many of which depicted images of the Staff God, an important deity in the Andes which during the Wari period had become specifically associated with the Lake Titicaca region on the modern Peru-Bolivia border. Similarly, the Wari's contemporaries of the Tiwanaku empire, also centered around a capital city of the same name, held the Staff God in similar esteem. Tiwanaku's empire began to expand out of Titicaca around 400 BCE, but its \\"Classic Period\\" of artistic production and political power occurred between 375 and 700 CE. Tiwanaku is currently known for its magnificent imperial city on the southern side of Lake Titicaca, now in modern-day Bolivia. Especially famous is the Gate of the Sun, which depicts a large image of the Staff God flanked by other religious symbols which may have functioned as a calendar. Following the decline of the Wari Empire in the late first millennium, the Chimú people, centered out of their capital city of Chimor began to build their empire on the north and central coasts of Peru. The Chimú were preceded by a simple ceramic style known as Sicán (700–900 CE) which became increasingly decorative until it became recognizable as Chimú in the early second millennium. The Chimú produced excellent portrait and decorative works in metal, notably gold but especially silver. The Chimú also are noted for their featherwork, having produced many standards and headdresses made of a variety of tropical feathers which were fashioned into bired and fish designs, both of which were held in high esteem by the Chimú. The Chimú are best known for their magnificent palatial complex of Chan Chan just south of modern-day Trujillo, Peru; now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Chimú went into decline very quickly due to outside pressures and conquest from the expanding Inca Empire in the mid-15th century. At the time of the Spanish conquest, the Inca Empire (Tawantinsuyu in Quechua, the \\"Land of the Four Quarters\\") was the largest and wealthiest empire in the world, and this was depicted in their art. Most Inca sculpture was melted down by the invading Spanish, so most of what remains today is in the form of architecture, textiles, and ceramics. The Inca valued gold among all other metals, and equated it with the sun god Inti. Some Inca buildings in the capital of Cusco were literally covered in gold, and most contained many gold and silver sculptures. Most Inca art, however, was abstract in nature. Inca ceramics were primarily large vessels covered in geometric designs. Inca tunics and textiles contained similar motifs, often checkerboard patterns reserved for the Inca elite and the Inca army. Today, due to the unpopularity of abstract art and the lack of Inca gold and silver sculpture, the Inca are best known for the architecture – specifically the complex of Machu Picchu just northwest of Cusco. Inca architecture makes use of large stone blocks, each one cut specifically to fit around the other blocks in a wall. These stones were cut with such precision that the Incas did not need to make use of mortar to hold their buildings together. Even without mortar, Inca buildings still stand today; they form many of the foundations for even modern-day buildings in Cusco and the surrounding area. The Incas produced thousand of large stone structures, among them forts, temples, and palaces, even though the Inca Empire lasted for only 95 years.

The station is staffed, with ticket sales, vending machines, telephones, washrooms, and wheelchair access to the station and trains. History1856 Grand Trunk station= Front view of the station in 1989. Built from bluish-grey Trenton limestone in 1856 by Thomas Brassey for Canadian National Railway predecessor Grand Trunk Railway, the station was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1973Belleville Railway Station (Grand Trunk), Directory of Designations of National Historic Significance of CanadaBelleville Railway Station (Grand Trunk) , Canadian Register of Historic Places and protected under the Heritage Railway Stations Protection Act since 1992. It is the oldest of multiple buildings which were once part of Belleville's GTR station yard, a facility which employed 100 by 1864 and included one of the first three GTR locomotive shops. A new locomotive shop was built in 1867, increasing capacity to 24 engines. GTR cutbacks in December 1876 led to a violent labour dispute on December 29 which stopped all trains; the Queen's Own Rifles militia deployed from Toronto on January 2, 1877 to end the strike. A new round house was built in 1912 to accommodate 42 engines, with a wheel shed and machine shop adjacent. With over a thousand people at its peak, the railway became Belleville's largest local employer. The 220 Station Street waiting room, a mid-size \\"Second Class Wayside Station\\" at the October 27, 1856 inception of the Grand Trunk mainline, served until the adjacent modern station building opened on March 20, 2012. While this building has always served only passengers, with telegraphy and freight located in other buildings, much of the original interior was lost due to 1987 and earlier renovations. Just east of the main station building, a freight shed stored VIA's baggage carts; its basement was home to The Belleville Model Railroad ClubThe Belleville Model Railroad Club: About Us While three original stations from the 1850s Grand Trunk line remain in active use at Georgetown, Port Hope and Napanee, all are small single-storey \\"Type C\\" stations (typically five curved arches for windows and doors on the sides and two at each end). Belleville is a larger station (\\"Type B\\", six arches) and the last intact original station on the line to have been expanded with a second storey. A similar Outer Station existed at Kingston, but was abandoned in the 1970s and is now in ruins. =1911 Canadian Northern / Canadian Pacific station= CN's historic Grand Trunk station was once one of two active passenger terminals in the city. The Canadian Pacific Railway used a former 1911 Canadian Northern Railway station on Church Street to handle Ottawa- Toronto traffic until 1966; that building was demolished in 1976. =2012 Via Rail station= On November 10, 2010, Via Rail unveiled a design for a modern $18 million station building which would be wheelchair accessible with space to accommodate expanded track lines.Government of Canada and Via Rail Unveil New Belleville Station Design Press Release Built at 250 Station Street, adjacent to the historic station, the new facility accepted its first passengers on March 20, 2012. MP Daryl Kramp officially opened the station on September 12, 2012. The original station is marked with a Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada plaque; as of 2012, the city and local groups are looking for new uses for the old station.

It was set up in 1983 by Butch Vig and Steve Marker to produce local bands. The studio produced bands such as Killdozer, The Smashing Pumpkins, L7, Tad, and Nirvana. After initial production and remix successes, the building became the focus of operations for Vig and Marker's own group, Garbage, who released their debut album in 1995. The studio survived various mishaps, including flooding, and in 2003, a backhoe crashing through the walls of the downstairs studio.https://www.nme.com/news/music/garbage-75-1383829 On May 1, 2010, the studio closed its doors because of financial difficulties. Following the closure, Madison filmmaker Wendy Schneider made a documentary on Smart Studios, The Smart Studios Story (2016), in which she interviewed artists, record producers, and engineers who worked in the facility. Schneider's Madison-based production company, Coney Island Studios, produced the film. In 2012, the Wisconsin Historical Museum assembled an exhibit on the studio, Smart Sounds, Alt Music, Mad Scenes.

Founded in 1877, it grew aggressively and stayed relatively strong throughout the Great Depression and two World Wars before finally being purchased by the Missouri Pacific Railroad (MP or MoPac) and the Louisville and Nashville Railroad (L&N;). Missouri Pacific merged with the C&EI; corporate entity in 1976, and was later acquired itself by the Union Pacific Railroad. History The Chicago and Eastern Illinois Railroad was organized in 1877 as a consolidation of three others: the Chicago, Danville and Vincennes Railroad (Chicago- Danville, November 1871), the Evansville, Terre Haute and Chicago Railroad (Danville-Terre Haute, October 1871) and the Evansville and Terre Haute Railroad (Terre Haute-Evansville, November 1854). Intended to merge or purchase railroads that had built lines between the southern suburbs of Chicago and Terre Haute, Indiana through Danville, Illinois, the C&EI; constructed a new line from Chicago to a Mississippi River connection in extreme southern Illinois at Thebes. The Egyptian Zipper, 1937 The management of the Chicago and Eastern Illinois and the Chicago and Indiana Coal Railway (\\"the Coal Road\\" or C&IC;) became intertwined and eventually a connection was built between the two railroads between Goodland, Indiana (on the C&IC;) and Momence (on the C&EI;). By 1894 the Eastern had merged the C&IC.; The C&EI; continued this vigorous growth into the next decade. The Danville - Chicago Flyer at Steger, Illinois on November 26, 1965 In 1902, the Frisco purchased a controlling interest in the Chicago and Eastern Illinois and continued building; first a connection between the two railroads at Pana, Illinois, next extending the line in Indiana to Evansville and a connection with the Ohio River. However, in 1913 financial problems led to the collapse of the Frisco, and the Eastern was once again on its own by 1920. The C&EI; spun off a variety of their lines, including the \\"Coal Road\\" (which became the Chicago, Attica and Southern Railroad). The C&EI; did not survive the Great Depression intact, entering bankruptcy in 1933, re-emerging just before World War II in 1940. The railroad continued its brisk growth once again, gaining access to St. Louis, Missouri in 1954. the Hummingbird and the Georgian on March 31, 1964 The Missouri Pacific Railroad began to quietly purchase C&EI; stock in 1961. After approval was gained from the Interstate Commerce Commission, Mopac assumed control of the C&EI; in May 1967. One of the stipulations of the merger required sale of part of the railroad to the Louisville and Nashville Railroad. The line directly south of Chicago to near Danville was actually purchased by both railroads (and continues to be owned and operated jointly by MoPac and L&N;'s successors, Union Pacific Railroad and CSX Transportation). The C&EI; was maintained as a separate subsidiary for a few years, but Missouri Pacific merged it in 1976. The route from Woodland Junction, Illinois through Danville into Indiana became part of L&N; and its successors (now CSX), while the western fork toward Thebes and St. Louis became MoPac/UP. The railroad also built many of its own cars, such as this combination cafe-lounge car. The Chicago terminal for the C&EI; passenger trains was Dearborn Station, sometimes known as 'Polk Station.' The C&EI; operated many streamliners. Its own trains, the Chicago to Cypress Meadowlark, and the Chicago to Evansville Whippoorwill were short lived. The C&EI; ran the Chicago to Evansville portion of the L&N;'s Humming Bird, and Georgian. The railroad also participated in the Chicago to Florida passenger service on the \\"Dixie Route\\", with trains such as the Dixie Limited, the Dixie Flyer, the Dixie Mail, the Dixie Flagler, and the Dixiana. It handled the trains from Chicago to Evansville, which then passed to the Louisville and Nashville, Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis, Central of Georgia, Atlantic Coast Line and Florida East Coast. Miles of road operated at year end: 945 in 1925, 863 in 1967, 643 in 1970 after L&N; took over its piece. Track-miles operated: 1928 in 1925, 1435 in 1967, 1067 in 1970. In 1967 it reported 3173 million ton-miles of revenue freight and 41 million passenger-miles.

Carnacki was the protagonist of a series of six short stories published between 1910 and 1912 in The Idler magazine and The New Magazine. These stories were printed together as Carnacki, the Ghost- Finder in 1913. A 1948 Arkham House edition of Carnacki, the Ghost-Finder edited by August Derleth added three stories: \\"The Haunted Jarvee\\", published posthumously in The Premier Magazine in 1929; \\"The Hog\\", published in Weird Tales in 1947; and \\"The Find\\", a previously unpublished story.  Notes on the series  The stories are inspired by the tradition of fictional detectives such as Sherlock Holmes. Carnacki lives in a bachelor flat in No 472 Cheyne Walk, Chelsea; the stories are told from a first-person perspective by Dodgson, a member of Carnacki's \\"strictly limited circle of friends\\", much as Holmes' adventures were told from Watson's point of view (his other friends are Jessop, Arkwright and Taylor). Whereas the Holmes stories never made use of the supernatural except as a red herring, this is the central theme of the Carnacki stories, though several of the stories have non-supernatural endings. The character of Carnacki was inspired in part by Dr. Hesselius, a supernaturally inclined scientist who appeared in short stories by the Irish fantasy writer Sheridan Le Fanu, notably the early and influential vampire story \\"Carmilla\\". Carnacki is also highly reminiscent of Algernon Blackwood's John Silence. = General structure = The stories are presented using a framework story: Carnacki periodically sends notes of invitation to four friends, asking them to come to dinner and hear his latest tale. One of the men, Dodgson, is the actual narrator of the story, who comprises an extremely minimal part of each Carnacki story. Carnacki forbids discussion of the case in question over dinner. After dinner, Carnacki lights his pipe, everyone settles into their favourite chairs, and he tells the tale without interruption. Each of Carnacki's tales tells of an investigation into an unusual haunting, which Carnacki is charged to identify and to end. He employs a variety of scientific methods in his investigations, as well as resorting to more traditional folklore. He employs technologies such as photography and his own fictional invention, the Electric Pentacle. He is not presumptuous, and always uses evidence to draw his final conclusions, so that in some stories he decides the haunting is real, while in others it is staged or faked by an adversary for various reasons. This variety makes the stories suspenseful, as the audience is never sure if the ghosts are real or not: of the nine Carnacki stories, one has no supernatural component, four feature authentic paranormal activity, two have the appearance of the supernatural as a disguise for mundane human activity, and two contain manmade hoaxes in parallel with an actual haunting. After the tale is complete, Carnacki usually answers a few questions from his guests and may hand around a relevant memento, but does not discuss the case at great length. He usually dismisses his guests with the genial phrase \\"Out you go!\\". = Inventions = In addition to the trademark electric pentacle, Hodgson invented several rituals and ancient texts that feature in the Carnacki stories. Carnacki uses a fictional ancient text, the \\"Sigsand Manuscript\\", as a resource to protect himself against supernatural influences. Carnacki refers to \\"Aeiirii\\" and \\"Saiitii\\" manifestations, the latter being more dangerous and capable of overcoming Carnacki's protective devices, and several rituals, including the \\"Saaamaaa Ritual\\", with its mysterious \\"eight signs\\" and \\"unknown last line\\" that is invoked in \\"The Whistling Room\\" by a mysterious power. There are references to even more arcane fictional works, including the \\"Incantation of Raaaee\\", but no further information is provided in the stories. = Influence = The stories influenced later horror and fantasy writers, notably Seabury Quinn and Algernon Blackwood, both of whom had their own supernatural detective characters (Jules de Grandin and John Silence respectively). Simon R. Green pays homage to Hodgson with his Ghost Finders series, where the protagonists work for the mysterious Carnacki Institute. Judas Ghost, a film based on Green's series, was released November 2013. = Critical opinion = Unlike some of Hodgson's work, the Carnacki stories remain very accessible to a modern audience. A. F. Kidd and Rick Kennett in their introduction to No. 472 Cheyne Walk: Carnacki, the Untold Stories pose the question: \\"What is it about Thomas Carnacki that fascinates so many people?\\" According to Kidd and Kennett, the series' enduring attraction comes more from Hodgson's capacity for world-building than any special appeal of Carnacki himself: > It certainly isn't his dynamic personality. Not much character is evident in > Hodgson's creation: he is your generic stiff upper-lip Edwardian Englishman > ... but the exotic landscapes he inhabits are supernatural... it's his > exploits, and the carefully constructed milieu in which they take place, > that continue to intrigue. They are quite timeless. Although a self-proclaimed fan of Hodgson's work, H. P. Lovecraft considered Carnacki, the Ghost-Finder \\"vastly inferior\\" to his earlier novels, calling it \\"his poorest work\\" and Carnacki himself \\"very weak, artificial and stereotyped\\", \\"surely only a mediocre echo of John Silence\\".  Summaries of Hodgson's Carnacki stories  The first six stories are covered here in sequence of their original publication, five in 1910 monthly issues of The Idler and \\"The Thing Invisible\\" in The New Magazine, January 1912. \\"The Thing Invisible\\" is first as the stories were collected in 1913, and again as collected in 1947. Most if not all collections follow that sequence, prior to Project Gutenberg Ebook #10832 (2004), which contains the first six stories alone, in their magazine sequence.\\"Carnacki, the Ghost Finder by William Hope Hodgson\\". Project Gutenberg Ebook #10832. 2004, last updated 2012. Retrieved 24 June 2019. \\"The Thing Invisible\\" was revised, and expanded by about half, presumably for the 1913 or 1947 collection. The collection as presented by Forgotten Futures contains both versions of \\"The Thing Invisible\\" and publishing history notes that identify some minor differences in the other stories.Carnacki the Ghost Finder. Marcus Rowland. ForgottenFutures.com. Copyright © 1996, revised 1998. Retrieved 24 June 2019. = \\"The Gateway of the Monster\\" = In an ancient mansion, the bedroom known as the Grey Room was the site of a grisly murder generations ago. Carnacki is summoned to investigate a noisy spirit that tears off the bedclothes and slams the door(s). The manifestation is far more powerful than he expects, and he spends a miserable, terrified night in his electric pentacle while a horrible apparition in the form of a giant human hand pounds at his defences. The next day, Carnacki finds the fabled \\"luck ring\\", and he brings it with him into the pentacle. This proves unwise, as when night falls the vicious entity pours from the ring itself and Carnacki is inside the pentacle with it. He barely escapes with his life, while the entity is trapped. He ends the haunting by melting down the ring into a lump of slag within his protective barrier. = \\"The House Among the Laurels\\" = A deserted mansion in Ireland displays signs of haunting, including what appears to be blood dripping from the ceiling, and several men have been found dead in the house. Is it a prank or a haunting? Carnacki recruits a group of burly local men to investigate, along with several dogs, and they attempt to stay the night within the mansion. During their ordeal doors slam, the fire goes out, a dog is killed, and the entire group bolts from the house in terror. Upon studying his photograph, Carnacki realises that he and the men have been played for fools. His photograph shows a wire, too fine to see in the dark, lowered from the ceiling to remove the hook holding the door open. The \\"blood drip\\" is coloured water, and the \\"ghosts\\" are actually a criminal gang living in secret rooms in the mansion and playing a trick on him, taking advantage of the local legends to frighten away interlopers. = \\"The Whistling Room\\" = When a chamber in a mansion manifests a loud, eerie whistling, Carnacki is called to investigate. He makes an exceedingly thorough search of the room, but can find no explanation. He is still not convinced of the supernatural nature of the sound until he climbs a ladder outside and peers into the room through the window: the floor of the room itself is puckering like a pair of grotesque, blistered lips. He hears Tassoc, the mansion's owner, calling for help, and enters the room via the window. But Tassoc is not in the room—only an extraordinarily dangerous supernatural entity. Carnacki is saved only by the intervention of an unknown, second being, which utters the unknown last line of the Saamaa ritual, temporarily rendering the whistling entity powerless. With that, Carnacki throws himself through the window to escape. He then has the room demolished, and all parts burned in a blast furnace within a protective pentacle including an ancient inscription in Celtic. According to legend, a court jester was once killed in the room's fireplace, and whistled as he was roasted to death. = \\"The Horse of the Invisible\\" = According to Hisgins family tradition, any first-born female will be haunted by a ghostly horse during her courtship. This story has been long considered a legend, but now for the first time in seven generations there is a first-born female, and her fiancée has just suffered a broken arm after an attack by a mysterious assailant. Carnacki is summoned to investigate. He and the woman, Mary, and her fiancée, Beaumont, hear hoofbeats in the night, but no horse is seen. Many people present hear the hoofbeats, but no one can find an explanation; Carnacki sets up the electric pentacle around Mary's bed. The hoofbeats are heard again during the night, but nothing else happens. No marks of hooves can be found around the grounds the next morning. The following evening, hoofbeats and neighing are heard on the grounds, and Mary is heard screaming. Carnacki rushes out with his camera, and snaps a picture, but sees nothing after the blinding flash. Beaumont is struck in the head, but not badly injured; he claims that he has seen an enormous horse's head. The hoofbeats are again heard during the night. The decision is made to accelerate the wedding plans, in the hopes that the haunting will disappear with the successful conclusion of the courtship. The next day, Carnacki takes Mary around the house, snapping photographs to see if any manifestation can be seen on film. In the cellar a horrible neighing is heard, but nothing is seen. In one of the developed photographs, however, an enormous hoof can be seen. The night again passes uneventfully. The next morning, though, hoofbeats and neighing can be heard almost immediately, in what seems a direct assault by the invisible horse; Carnacki fires his weapon and Mary's father attacks with his sword. As a light is brought they discover a rejected suitor, Parsket, wearing an enormous costume horse head and hooves. As they interrogate Parsket, hoofbeats are again heard in the house, and this time it is not a trick; Parsket dies of fright. The marriage goes on as planned, and the manifestation is never heard again. = \\"The Searcher of the End House\\" = Carnacki discovers \\"a queer, soft, flabby, spreading imprint, that gave me a feeling of extraordinary horror\\" Carnacki investigates a haunting in his own mother's house. The first indication that something is amiss comes when Carnacki, up late reading, hears his mother knocking, so he thinks, on the banister to tell him to go to his bed. She does not remember doing so the next day, and it happens again the following night. When Carnacki looks in on her, he finds her door open, but she is sound asleep. A strange mildew smell is in the bedroom. Carnacki investigates the house, including the three cellars, but can find no explanation. The opening of the door happens again the following night, and this time while Carnacki is speaking to his mother the two of them hear a door slam twice downstairs. The smell of mildew is powerful as Carnacki investigates the house. More doors are heard slamming in the night, but Carnacki can find nothing. The next day, he consults the landlord, and learns something of the house's mysterious history, which includes a former tenant named Captain Tobias, and rumours of a ghostly woman. Several previous tenants had left upon seeing this apparition. The landlord agrees to spend the night in the house as well. In the dead of night, they see a ghostly, naked child running through the house. They have little doubt that it is a supernatural manifestation. The landlord claims to see a woman, apparently searching for the child, although Carnacki cannot see it. All of the seals on the doors are unbroken. As they debate what they have seen, the mildew smell returns, more powerful than ever. The downstairs passages are wet with grotesquely shaped footprints. In his nervousness, the landlord accidentally fires his revolver. No one is hit, but the police arrive to investigate. The physical evidence convinces the officer that an investigation is in order. As they wind up their tour, a second officer sees the ghostly woman. The men follow the wet footprints and smell into the cellars; on the top step, they find a wriggling maggot. Through their investigation of the third cellar, they find that the prints stop at a disused well, filled with water. They watch the well for the rest of the night, but nothing more happens. The next evening, the men reconvene in the basement with lamps, a tripwire, and a wire cage to suspend over the well. Carnacki locks and seals the doors. As they keep watch, the ghostly child again manifests, apparently fleeing from an unseen pursuer. All present but Carnacki claim to see a woman, although he does see all the metal objects in the basement shining strangely. While they watch, something is heard to emerge from the well, giving off the horrible smell; Carnacki lowers the cage, and when the men uncover the lanterns they discover that they have caught Captain Tobias, carrying a leg of spoiled mutton. He came in through a secret passage at the bottom of the well. We learn that Captain Tobias is wanted for smuggling, after being released from prison only a few weeks earlier. He is trying to drive out the tenants of his old home so that he can retrieve smuggled goods; the sounds were produced when he entered a hidden passage in Carnacki's mother's bedroom. The wooden panels have warped with age, and so make a clicking sound. As for the ghost, Captain Tobias also reports that he has seen the woman and child. Carnacki believes that \\"...the Woman and the Child were not only two complete and different entities; but even they were each not in quite the same planes of existence.\\" He thinks the men may have witnessed the ghost of a wayward unborn child that refused to accept birth into the natural world and which was thus pulled back by what Sigsand called \\"thee Haggs\\". Carnacki goes on to say \\"it leaves us with the conception of a child's soul adrift half-way between two lives, and running through Eternity from Something incredible and inconceivable (because not understood) to our senses.\\" = \\"The Thing Invisible\\" = A chapel attached to an Edwardian manor house contains an ancient, cursed dagger that has just apparently almost murdered someone of its own accord, and naturally, Carnacki is called in to investigate. He spends the night in the chapel wearing armour with his camera ready to photograph any mysterious phenomena. All night he hears mysterious noises. As he approaches the altar, the dagger nearly kills him. The photographic evidence settles it, though—there is a rational explanation. The somewhat demented elderly gentleman of the manor house has armed an ancient trap that guards the altar: a spring mechanism designed to fling the dagger when the altar gate is opened. Carnacki uncovers the truth because of a subtle difference between the \\"before\\" and \\"after\\" photographs of the altar's cast iron metalwork. = \\"The Hog\\" = This story was first printed in Weird Tales (Jan 1947). Carnacki faces perhaps his most powerful adversary: a disturbing hog spirit of giant proportions which is trying to enter our world, manifesting as a series of horrifying nightmares. He is equipped with a new variant on the electric pentacle involving rainbow-coloured tubes. When connected to the head of the dreamer these tubes fluctuate in color and light intensity. Carnacki photographs the tubes on a slowly moving strip of paper which he specially develops to create raised images. When the paper is run under the reproducer of a specially modified phonograph the sounds heard by the dreamer are reproduced- in this instance the sounds of evil swine. = \\"The Haunted Jarvee\\" = Carnacki decides to go for a voyage aboard the Jarvee, his old friend Captain Thompson's antique sailing ship, for purposes of rejuvenation, but also to investigate the ambiguous complaints of ghosts his friend had been making for some time. Carnacki performs his standard methods of exhaustively and completely searching the designated area to eliminate obvious physical causes of a haunting. Finding nothing, Carnacki is left to wait. After four days, whilst performing his usual patrol along the ship's poop deck with the Captain, his old friend suddenly points out to him a shadow of some sort on the ocean's surface, speeding towards the ship. He notices similar shadows converging on the ship from all of the cardinal directions. The closer they get to the Jarvee, the harder it is to see them, and eventually they disappear from sight. Carnacki, the Captain and the rest of the crew retire, and the night goes normally, until about eleven o'clock, when a furious storm bursts upon the ship without a hint of warning. Refusing to send men up above to lower the sails and masts because of previous experiences in which he did just that, and his men were hurled to their death, Captain Thompson forces them to sit out the storm completely unprepared, and the Jarvee suffers tremendous damage. Observing all this, Carnacki guesses that the phenomenon is caused by vibrations, so when he observes the shadows converging on the ship again the next day, he sets up a device to emit repellent vibrations. The ship is then struck by a furious squall, which tears one of the sails right off of the ropes. It is not until 2 A.M that the squall passes, followed by an entire week of calm seas, with a furious wind storm every night. During this week of calm, however, Carnacki is left to experiment with his repellent vibrations, until finally, he is given the distinct impression that his experiments are producing results, and he finally convinces Captain Thompson to allow him to set up his machine to emit the vibrations at full power, without stopping, starting at sunset. Afraid for their lives, Carnacki orders the crew to stay below decks, padlocking the doors and making the first and eighth signs of the Saaamaaa Ritual, connected with triple lines crossed at every seventh inch. The Captain and the three mates demand to accompany him during the night, and Carnacki reluctantly agrees. He draws a pentacle with chalk around the machine emitting the vibrations, and around the Captain and his mates. He then erects the Electric Pentacle and turns the vibration machine on. Soon after, he and the Captain witness the mysterious shadows racing towards the ship. Strange, purple lightning is then witnessed, but it is not accompanied by thunder. Soon after, the ship undergoes a series of strange \\"shudderings\\" before it starts to tip onto its side, sending the Electric Pentacle sliding, and forcing Carnacki, Captain Thompson and his three mates to hold on for dear life. Carnacki is forced to shut his machine off. Predictably, there is a booming of thunder, and a furious storm starts raging. Towards morning, the storm calms, and soon after, the Jarvee is running before a strong wind—but a leak has been sprung, and two days after, they are forced to abandon ship and take to the boats. The Jarvee sinks to the bottom of the ocean. After he finishes his tale, Dodgson, the narrator asks what caused the haunting. Carnacki then explains his theory of \\"focuses\\", saying that the Jarvee, for whatever reason, be it the particular mood a builder was in as he hammered a nail home, or the tree that makes up a certain board, was a focal point for \\"attractive vibrations\\". He summarises by saying that it is impossible for him to know fully why the Jarvee was being haunted, and he could only make suppositions. = \\"The Find\\" = Carnacki investigates a seemingly impossible book forgery. It is the only Carnacki story without any hint of the supernatural.  Adaptations Television= \\"The Horse of the Invisible\\" was adapted as an episode of the 1970s British TV series, The Rivals of Sherlock Holmes. Cast * Donald Pleasence as Carnacki * Tony Steedman as Captain Hisgins * Michele Dotrice as Mary Hisgins * Michael Johnson as Charles Beaumont * Geoffrey Whitehead as Harry Parsket * Aimée Delamain as Miss Hisgins * Arthur White as March =Audio= Big Finish Productions has recorded six of the stories in unabridged audiobook format.

The adventures of Thomas Carnacki will be told in short story format steeped in weird fiction, folklore, ghost stories, mythology and symbolism. The graphic novel is written and illustrated by M. S. Corley who regularly shares his working process on his project's page \\"Carnacki: Recorder of Things Strange\\" = 472 Cheyne Walk = The book No. 472 Cheyne Walk: Carnacki, the Untold Stories by A. F. Kidd and Rick Kennett collects twelve stories written about the further adventures of Carnacki. Four of these stories were originally published as a 32-page booklet of the same title in 1992. The book version was printed in a limited edition of 500 copies. Many of these stories are inspired by off-hand references to other cases of hauntings that Carnacki makes in his stories, which were never explained further in the original story series. In their introduction to the 1992 booklet the authors describe these stories as pastiche, in the sense of respectful imitation or homage, as opposed to parody, which mocks the original (either with respectful humour, or more viciously). The authors suggest that Hodgson, by having Carnacki casually drop references to other cases which he himself did not write about, \\"invited\\" his readers to enter the \\"shared universe\\" and pick up where he left off. Readers may decide for themselves whether to consider these stories \\"canon\\" or a legitimate part of the Carnacki story arc; they closely follow not only the basic framework structure of the Carnacki original stories but also Hodgson's style and vocabulary.  \\"The Darkness\\"  In \\"The Gateway of the Monster\\" and \\"The Horse of the Invisible\\", Carnacki makes passing references to the \\"Black Veil case\\", in which a man named Aster died because he did not accept the necessity of staying inside the protective pentacle. In \\"The Darkness\\", Aster is a reporter who accompanies Hodgson on his investigation of a haunted room. An apparition of a mysterious woman can be seen in the window and a rotting black veil is found inside a secret compartment in a window-seat. Carnacki burns the veil inside a pentacle in the hopes of ending the haunting. However, as night falls, Aster will not enter the pentacle, believing this to be superstitious nonsense. Both men lose the power of sight as the apparition manifests, and Carnacki must listen helplessly from inside the pentacle as Aster is driven into screaming madness and death. No option remains to end the haunting but to destroy the house itself.  \\"Matheson's Inheritance\\"  In \\"The Gateway of the Monster\\" Carnacki makes reference to the \\"Noving Fur\\" case. It is unclear if this is a typographical error and Hodgson intended \\"Moving Fur\\" instead; the Collected Fiction edition and the Project Gutenberg electronic text show this correction. \\"Matheson's Inheritance\\" covers both bases by including moving fur and placing the haunting in Noving House in Wales. Matheson has inherited a baroque mansion. Local legend says the house was once occupied by a dewi (wizard) and his familiar an afanc. One room in the house emanates dread. Carnacki and Matheson can find no natural explanation, and so Carnacki spends the night in the room, inside his protective pentacle. In the middle of his vigil his candle flames suddenly turn black, and the floor becomes a heaving carpet of fur, as if the pentacle was upon the back of a giant animal. It is clear that the protective barrier has failed utterly. As in \\"The Whistling Room\\", a second powerful entity intervenes and the candle flames turn blue; Carnacki is given a moment to escape the room, and does so, although his pantlegs are torn and his legs covered with cuts. In daylight, strange, ancient bones are found under the floorboards of the room; before the room can be demolished, that wing of the mansion burns. The blue candle flames point Carnacki back to references to the protective powers of colours in the Sigsand manuscript, suggesting the origin of the coloured tubes that appear in Hodgson's Carnacki story \\"The Hog\\". The afanc is described as having a horse-like head; this description does not match the Welsh myth, and so may be a reference to \\"The Horse of the Invisible\\". Motifs: a legend; a protective pentacle; a supernatural manifestation; protection from one supernatural entity by another, more powerful one; a creature or creatures unknown to science; a vigil. = \\"Doctor Who: Foreign Devils\\" = In 2002, an Andrew Cartmel novella appeared as one of a series based upon Doctor Who. Foreign Devils featured Carnacki alongside the Second Doctor as his companion. = The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen = In 2007 a graphic novel entitled The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Black Dossier was released, written by Alan Moore and illustrated by Kevin O'Neill. It is part of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen series, and is the first to feature Thomas Carnacki. Carnacki is a member of the 1910s League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, with Wilhelmina Murray, Allan Quatermain, Orlando, and A. J. Raffles. The Black Dossier is filled with non-comic pieces, taking the form of prose stories, letters, maps, guidebooks, magazines and even a lost Shakespeare folio. Carnacki features most prominently in a short story \\"What Ho, Gods of the Abyss\\" and concerns a visit by Jeeves and Bertie Wooster (by P. G. Wodehouse) to Wooster's Aunt Dahlia wherein they encounter an Elder Thing, along with a Mi-go and a Cthulhu cult. Carnacki is described as being \\"an older man...who seemed to be regarded by the others as an expert on the sort of business going on within my aunt's estate.\\" After questioning Wooster closely he performs a ritual banishing of the Elder Thing with the help of his team. In another section of the Black Dossier entitled \\"The Sincerest Form of Flattery\\" it is mentioned that Carnacki \\"had encounters with some form of spirit that allowed him brief, fragmentary visions of the future\\" regarding an attempt to derail the coronation of King George V. Due to ill health following his visions of World War I, Carnacki did not participate in the League's battle with Les Hommes Mysterieux, and had by 1937 retired from active duty. Released in 2009, Part I of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume III: Century entitled \\"What Keeps Mankind Alive\\" features Carnacki as a main character. Set in 1910, following his visions of a black cabal, Carnacki brings Mina Harker, Allan Quatermain, Orlando, and A.J. Raffles to an occult club which is populated by a range of fictional occult detectives looking for clues as to the cabal. This leads them to investigate and confront the cabal led by W. Somerset Maugham's Aleister Crowley analogue, Oliver Haddo. Carnacki suspects that they are trying to end the world by creating a Moonchild. = Audience with the Ghost Finder = Audience with the Ghost Finder, a stage play by M. J. Starling, features Carnacki and Dodgson as main characters. Though the story is original, the play is an explicit homage to Hodgson's stories, several of which are directly referenced by the characters - most notably The Horse of the Invisible, the events of which form part of the backstory. The play also borrows imagery from H. P. Lovecraft's story The Dreams in the Witch-House. Audience with the Ghost Finder was first performed by Blackshaw Theatre in May 2013, at the Wandsworth Arts Festival and Fringe. It was revived in October 2013 as part of the London Horror Festival. = The Diogenes Club = Kim Newman has written a number of short stories about the Diogenes Club, as originally from the Sherlock Holmes stories of Arthur Conan Doyle. In Newman's setting, the Club investigates paranormal and occult matters for British intelligence and police agencies. In the stories \\"The Man Who Got Off The Ghost Train\\" and \\"Swellhead\\", it is mentioned that Carnacki was a member of the Diogenes Club as a special occult investigator; when he retired, his position was taken by Newman's character Richard Jeperson. Carnacki is also mentioned as having investigated several cases alongside Sherlock Holmes. = Carnacki in the Cthulhu Mythos = Barbara Hambly's short story \\"The Adventure of the Antiquarian's Niece\\" (from Shadows Over Baker Street) and A. F. Kidd's short story \\"The Grantchester Grimoire\\" (from Gaslight Grimoire) both also feature Carnacki aiding Sherlock Holmes in an investigation of an occult matter. = \\"A Forgotten Caudetan Incident\\" = Spanish author Alberto López Aroca wrote the short story \\"Un olvidado episodio caudetano\\" (\\"A Forgotten Caudetan Incident\\"), included in the book Los Espectros Conjurados (), featuring Carnacki in a Spanish village, Caudete; and by the same author, \\"Algunos derivados del alquitrán\\" (\\"Some Coal-tar Derivatives\\"), included in the volume Sherlock Holmes y lo Outré -Publisher: Academia de Mitología Creativa Jules Verne de Albacete, 2007-, with Carnacki visiting a retired Sherlock Holmes in Fulworth. Carnacki appears as an old man in another work by López Aroca, Necronomicón Z (Ediciones Dolmen, 2012; ), a Cthulhu Mythos novel. = Gravel = In 2008, the comic publisher Avatar started serialising Gravel, the ongoing adventures of Warren Ellis' and Mike Wolfer's combat magician William Gravel (previously told in the Strange Kisses, Stranger Kisses and the Strange Killings mini-series). In the first storyline of the ongoing Gravel comic, Ellis and Wolfer had the \\"Sigsand manuscript\\", split in parts for each of the \\"Minor Seven\\" (Britain's occult detectives). In his quest for revenge for having been ousted from the group, Gravel must collect each magician's piece of the manuscript, but spends most of the third issue hearing about Thomas Carnacki (including an extended homage to \\"The Whistling Room\\" and the particular writing style Hodgson used when writing the Carnacki stories). Previously, Warren Ellis had included the Sigsand Manuscript in the 13th issue of his ongoing Planetary series. It is picked up by Elijah Snow from Sherlock Holmes' book shelf. = Sherlock Holmes: The Breath of God = In 2012, a Sherlock Holmes pastiche novel by Guy Adams was published that featured Carnacki. = Parodies = David Langford's 1988 parody collection The Dragonhiker's Guide to Battlefield Covenant at Dune's Edge: Odyssey Two contains a parody of \\"The Gateway of the Monster\\", in which the creature manifests not as a human hand, but as another body part entirely. Rick Kennett has also written a parody of \\"The Whistling Room\\" called \\"The Sniffling Room\\", published in The Goblin Muse, April 2000. In this brief story, rather than receiving an invitation and then eagerly attending Carnacki's storytelling evenings, the attending gentlemen are instead kidnapped, dragged to Carnacki's home, and forced to listen against their will to a tale told by a man they consider to be a raving lunatic. It thus mocks primarily the common framework of the Carnacki stories, rather than Carnacki's actual investigation. The French writer Gérard Dôle has published a volume of parodies of Carnacki, in which he encounters the likes of Sherlock Holmes and Sâr Dubnotal while two other French writers, Fabrice Colin and André-François Ruaud have given to Thomas Carnacki a nephew, William Carnacki, reporting to his uncle the life in a parallel world where most monsters do exist (children book Le Livre des monstres—Chroniques du monde noir, 2008). Anton LaVey, founder and High Priest of the Church of Satan, named his son \\"Satan Xerxes Carnacki LaVey\\". =The Adventure of the Haunted Library= August Derleth, whose Arkham House publishing firm issued the first American (and first expanded edition) of Carnacki, the Ghost-Finder, pays affectionate tribute to the character in one of his Solar Pons stories. While Carnacki does not actually appear in the story, it is mentioned several times in \\"The Adventure of the Haunted Library\\" (which appears in The Casebook of Solar Pons (1965)) that Carnacki was called in to investigate the case, but having been unable to solve it, thereafter referred it to Solar Pons.

The Tilst area is marked by big city blocks and large traditional suburban areas. In the surrounding area are several superstores, which mainly serve the inner city population of Aarhus. The area is most commonly known for the Bilka warehouse, the largest in Denmark and the only one of its kind in the Aarhus area. The area is divided by the intercity Viborgvej road, with Tilst on the northern side, and the True and Skjoldhøj area situated to the south, bordering Brabrand and Hasle. Tilst has a relatively high density of immigrants compared to the rest of Aarhus, and the suburb is home to many ethnic groups. Tilst is divided into several neighbourhoods, each one usually identified by its location or street names. One area for example, a residential one near the lake of Geding Sø in the western parts, is known as Blomsterkvarteret (The Flower Quarter) since all the streets are named after flowers. There is a relatively large industrial park, with mostly light industry, in the eastern outskirts of Tilst. The local public school is Tilst Skole, and the local gymnasium is called Langkær Gymnasium og HF. The local church, Tilst Kirke, founded in the 1100s is among the oldest churches in Scandinavia, but with several additions from the 15th century.

Upstream and northwest of the Whilkut along the Lower Redwood Creek lived the Chilula; they established their more than 20 villages only along the eastern shore, because there the mountains were broken by valleys irrigated by small streams, while the western shore was difficult to access. The Chilula (together with Whilkut) were called by the neighboring Hupa-speaking peoples Xwiy¬q'it-xwe / Xwe:yłq'it-xwe (\\"Redwood Ridge / Bald Hills People\\"), the Karuk also called them Vitkirik'áraar (\\"People of Viitkírik/Viitkírak (Bald Hills)\\"), therefore they were also known as Bald Hills Indians or Lower Redwood Indians. Because of their close Hupa kin they are also called Lower Redwood Creek Hupa or Downstream Redwood Creek Hupa.

Biography Cachoo Sneezing Powder He was born Søren Adam Sørensen in Koldind, Randers County, Denmark in 1879 to Hans Sørensen, a clog maker, and his wife Sofia. They moved to the US when Soren was two, and settled in the Scandinavian community of Perth Amboy, New Jersey where his father operated a saloon.Zolotow, Maurice. \\"S. S. Adams – mischief, incorporated\\" from It Takes All Kinds, at CSAdams.com. Accessed September 17, 2015. \\"The future Ford of foolery was born Soren Sorenson Adams in Aarhus, Denmark, in 1869. His father was a sabot maker, who removed to Perth Amboy, N.J., when Sam—as he has always been called—was two years old.\\" In 1904 Adams found himself employed as a salesman for a dye company. One of the products he sold caused workers to sneeze, and Sam found a way to extract this derivative from the dye and called this new powder Cachoo. He was inundated by requests for this product from his friends and so, he decided to sell his interest in a hotel in York, Pennsylvania, and used the money to launch the Cachoo Sneezing Powder Company in Plainfield, New Jersey. Within a few years, the sneezing powder craze that swept the country had subsided, and Sam set out to innovating new products. He also changed the name of the company to S.S. Adams Co. to reflect that it was no longer a one product company. The Exploding Cigarette Box, the snake nut can, itching powder, the stink bomb, and the dribble glass all entered the Adams line in the next decade. In 1928, Sam invented the prototype of what was to become the joy buzzer, a mechanical device placed in the hand, which emitted a loud vibrating buzz, when a button on the buzzer was depressed. This would usually occur when two people shook hands. He took the prototype to Dresden, Germany, where a tool and die maker created the tooling to make small parts for the item, which was now just 3.2 cm (1-1/4 inches) in diameter and 1.8 cm (3/4 inch) thick. The final item was patented in 1932. The success of the item allowed him to greatly increase his staff and purchase the former Symphonion music box factory building (constructed in 1893, demolished 2017) in Neptune, New Jersey, all during the Great Depression. In the 1940s, the owner of JEM Rubber Co. of Toronto Canada, approached Sam with a newly invented item, it was the precursor to what would become then as the whoopee cushion. Sam said that the item was \\"too vulgar\\" and would never sell. JEM Rubber then went and offered the idea to the Johnson Smith Company which ended up selling it with great success. S.S. Adams Co. later released its own version, but called it the \\"Razzberry Cushion.\\" Later life and death  Sam and S.S. Adams went on to create many more successful novelties: The Bar Bug in Ice Cube, The Money Maker, The Squirting Nickel, The Jumping Coin, Laughing Tissue as well as an extensive line of novelty-based magic tricks and puzzles. He claimed to have devised over 600 different items, and patented about 40 of them. He continued to lead S.S. Adams Company until his death in Asbury Park, New Jersey in 1963 at age 84.

Stone Memorial Zoo, following his death in 1968. The zoo continued to operate through the 1970s and 1980s and began breeding endangered species, including orangutans, kinkajous, siamang, and kudus. A polar bear named \\"Major\\" arrived in July 1979, and soon became the zoo's main attraction. On November 12, 1990, state budget cuts caused the Stone Zoo to cease operation. Following public outcry, the state senate established a private, non-profit corporation to manage the zoo, with the help of fund-raising and donations, and the zoo reopened on June 6, 1992. During this transition period, the zoo fell into disrepair and lost all of its large animals, with the exception of Major who remained until his death in 2000. The zoo rapidly declined in quality and attendance. Old facilities were repurposed including using the former giraffe house as an animal education center. =Recent developments= In the early 2000s, Zoo New England began a fund- raising campaign to reinvigorate both the Stone Zoo and the Franklin Park Zoo. On September 24, 2005, Stone Zoo celebrated its 100th anniversary. The zoo layout was modified to make the grounds interesting and educational, despite the lack of large animals. Many new exhibits were created and existing ones expanded or upgraded. These improvements have been credited with increasing zoo attendance. A Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) bus stop is expected to be added to improve access by public transportation. Exhibit areas The major exhibits and animals on display are: * Alfred Huang North American Crane Exhibit (): Home to American alligators, barrow's goldeneyes, hooded mergansers, sandhill cranes, tundra swans, and whooping cranes ().https://www.zoonewengland.org/stone-zoo/our-animals/?sort=exhibit * Animal Discovery Center (): Home to Arizona blond tarantulas, Blanding's turtles, California king snakes, Chilean rose tarantulas, corn snakes, dyeing poison dart frogs, eastern box turtles, green and black poison dart frogs, honey bees, leopard geckos, magnificent tree frogs, Panamanian golden frogs, rosy boas, tonkin bug-eyed frogs, and vinegaroons. * Barnyard: Home to Guinea hogs, Nigerian dwarf goats, pygmy zebus, and various chicken breeds.

Twelve men including British Army officers, Royal Irish Constabulary officers and a civilian informant were killed on the morning of 21 November 1920 by the Irish Republican Army in a planned series of simultaneous early-morning strikes engineered by Michael Collins. The events were the first killings of Bloody Sunday. Some Irish historians (such as Tim Pat Coogan and Conor Cruise O'Brien) dispute assertions of a common history of service in the Middle East as the reason for the unit's nom de guerre. It has been suggested that they received the name because they often held meetings at Cafe Cairo at 59 Grafton Street in Dublin. Earlier books on the 1919–1923 period do not refer to the Cairo Gang by that name. Background By 1920, the IRA's Dublin headquarters, under the direction of Michael Collins, had effectively eliminated, through targeted assassination and intelligence penetration, the G Division of the Dublin Metropolitan Police, previously the mainstay of the Crown's intelligence operations against Irish Republicans. In response the Dublin Castle administration, the then headquarters of the British government in Ireland were forced to look for external intelligence support. In January 1920, the British Army Intelligence Centre in Ireland stood up a special plainclothes unit of 18–20 demobilized ex-army officers and some active-duty officers to conduct clandestine operations against the IRA. The officers received training at a school of instruction in London, most likely under the supervision of Special Branch, which had been part of Britain's Directorate of Home Intelligence since February 1919. They may also have received some training from MI5 officers and former officers working for Special Branch. Army Centre, Dublin, hoped these officers could eventually be divided up and deployed to the provinces to support its 5th and 6th Division intelligence staffs, but it decided to keep it in Dublin under the command of the Dublin District Division, General Gerald Boyd, commanding. It was known officially as the Dublin District Special Branch (DDSB) and also as \\"D Branch\\". In May 1920, Lieutenant Colonel Walter Wilson arrived in Dublin to take command of D Branch. Following the events of Bloody Sunday, 21 November 1920, when twelve D Branch officers were assassinated by the Irish Republican Army under the command of Michael Collins, D Branch was transferred to the command of Brigadier-General Sir Ormonde Winter in January 1921. Winter had been placed in charge of a new police intelligence unit, the Combined Intelligence Service, in May 1920, and his charter was to set up a central intelligence clearing house to more effectively collate and coordinate army and police intelligence. Those members of D Branch who survived Bloody Sunday were very unhappy to be transferred from army command to CIS command, and for the next six months, until the Truce of July 1921, D Branch continued to maintain regular contact with Army Intelligence Centre while undertaking missions for Winter's CIS.Imperial War Museum, General Hugh Jeudwine Papers, A Record of the Rebellion in Ireland, 1919–1921 and of the part played by the Army in it. Volume IICaroline Woodcock, Experiences of an Officer's Wife in Ireland(London and Edinburgh: Blackwood and Sons, 1921).Charles Townsend, The British Campaign in Ireland 1919–1921 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1975) A photo purportedly of the Cairo Gang, but more probably the Igoe Gang The famous photograph that is widely accepted as showing members of the Cairo Gang is lodged in the National Library of Ireland photographic archive Piaras Béaslaí collection (five copies). An inscription describes the men as \\"the special gang F company Auxiliaries\\". There are no names or details on the back of the photos. Three other photos in the collection show Auxiliaries posing on vehicles in the grounds of Dublin Castle. These three photos are similarly numbered. The Cairo Gang members lived unobtrusively at nice addresses, in boarding houses and hotels across Dublin while preparing a hit list of known Republicans. However, the IRA Intelligence Department (IRAID) was one step ahead of them and was receiving information from numerous well-placed sources, including Lily Mernin, who was the confidential code clerk for British Army Intelligence Centre in Parkgate Street, and Sergeant Jerry Mannix, stationed in Donnybrook. Mannix provided the IRAID with a list of names and addresses for all the members of the Cairo Gang. In addition, Michael Collins's case officers on the intelligence staff—Liam Tobin, Tom Cullen and Frank Thornton—were meeting with several D Branch officers nightly, pretending to be informers. Another IRA penetration source participating in the nightly repartee with the D Branch men at Cafe Cairo, Rabiatti's Saloon and Kidds Back Pub was Detective Constable David Neligan, one of Michael Collins's penetrations of G-Division, the secret detectives of the Dublin Metropolitan Police. Additionally, the IRA had co-opted most of the Irish servants who worked in the rooming houses where the D Branch officers lived, and all of their comings and goings were meticulously recorded by servants and reported to Collins's staff. All the members of the gang were kept under surveillance for several weeks, and intelligence was gathered from sympathisers (for example, concerning people who were coming home at strange hours, which would indicate that they were being allowed through the military curfew). The IRA Dublin Brigade and the IRAID then pooled their resources and intelligence to draw up their own hit list of suspected gang members and set the date for the assassinations to be carried out on 21 November 1920 at 9:00 am. Assassinations The operation was planned by several senior IRA members, including Michael Collins, Dick McKee, Liam Tobin, Peadar Clancy, Tom Cullen, Frank Thornton and Oscar Traynor. The killings were planned to coincide with a Gaelic football match between Dublin and Tipperary, because the large crowds around Dublin would allow easier movement for the Volunteers and make it more difficult for the British to detect Collins's Squad members as they carried out the assassinations. Clancy and McKee were picked up by Crown forces on the evening of Saturday, 20 November. They were tortured and later shot dead \\"while trying to escape\\". Tortured and killed with them was Conor Clune (the nephew of Archbishop Clune of Perth, who had been senior chaplain to the Catholic members of the Australian Imperial Force in World War I).The Irish War of Independence by Michael Hopkinson (), page 91 Clune was manager of the seed and plant nursery owned by Edward MacLysaght near Quin, and Clune and MacLysaght travelled to Dublin on the morning of Saturday, 20 November 1920, bringing with him the books of the Raheen Co-op for its annual audit. Clune was arrested in a raid on Vaughan's Hotel in Dublin, where he was a registered guest. =28 Pembroke Street Upper= The operation began at 9:00 am, when members of the Squad entered 28 Pembroke Street. The first British agents to die were Major Charles Milne Cholmeley Dowling and Captain Leonard Price. Andy Cooney of the Dublin Brigade removed documents from their rooms. Three more members of the Gang were shot in the same house: Captain Brian Christopher Headlam Keenlyside, Colonel Wilfrid Woodcock, and Lieutenant-Colonel Hugh Montgomery. Woodcock was not connected with intelligence and had walked into a confrontation on the first floor of the Pembroke Street house as he was preparing to leave to command a regimental parade at army headquarters. He was in his military uniform, and, when he shouted to warn the other five British officers living in the house, he was shot in the shoulder and back, but survived. As Keenlyside was about to be shot, a struggle ensued between his wife and Mick O'Hanlon. The leader of the unit, Mick Flanagan, arrived, pushed Mrs Keenlyside out of the way and shot her husband. =117 Morehampton Road= At 117 Morehampton Road, Donnybrook, 2.3 km from the scene of the first shootings, another member of the Cairo Gang, Lieutenant Donald Lewis MacLean, along with suspected informer TH Smith and MacLean's brother-in-law, John Caldow, were taken into the hallway and about to be shot, when MacLean asked that they not be shot in front of his wife. The three were taken to an unused bedroom and shot. Caldow survived his wounds and fled to his home in Scotland. =92 Lower Baggot Street= Just 800 metres away, at 92 Lower Baggot Street, another member, Captain William Frederick Newberry, and his wife heard their front door come crashing down and blockaded themselves into their bedroom. Newberry rushed for his window to try to escape but was shot while climbing out by Bill Stapleton and Joe Leonard after they finally broke the door down. =38 Upper Mount Street= Two key members of the Gang, Lieutenant Peter Ashmun Ames and Captain George Bennett, were made to stand facing the wall on a bed in a downstairs rear bedroom and shot by Vinny Byrne and others in his squad. A maid had let the attackers into 38 Upper Mount Street and indicated, at gunpoint, the rooms occupied by the two targeted men. Despite many accounts to the contrary, Byrne was not involved in the killings in Morehampton Road that morning. =28 Earlsfort Terrace= Sergeant John J Fitzgerald, of the Royal Irish Constabulary, also known as \\"Captain Fitzgerald\\" or \\"Captain Fitzpatrick\\", whose father was from County Tipperary, was killed a kilometre away at 28 Earlsfort Terrace. He had survived a previous assassination attempt when a bullet grazed his head. This time he was shot twice in the head. The documents found in his house detailed the movements of senior IRA members. =22 Lower Mount Street= An IRA unit led by Tom Keogh entered 22 Lower Mount Street to kill Lieutenant Henry Angliss, alias Patrick Mahon, and Lieutenant Charles Ratsch Peel. The two intelligence specialists in the Gang, Angliss and Peel, had been recalled from Russia to organise British intelligence operations in the South Dublin area. Angliss had survived a previous assassination attempt when he had been shot at in a billiard hall. He was targeted for killing Sinn Féin fundraiser John Lynch, mistaken for General Liam Lynch, Divisional Commandant of the 1st Southern Division, IRA. Angliss was shot as he reached for his gun. Peel, hearing the shots, managed to block his bedroom door and survived even though more than a dozen bullets were fired into his room. When members of Fianna Éireann on lookout reported that the Auxiliary Division were approaching the house, the unit of eleven men split up into two groups, the first leaving by the front door, the second through the laneway at the back of the house. =119 Baggot Street= At 119 Baggot Street, a three-man unit killed Captain Geoffrey Thomas Baggallay,Casualty Details: Baggallay, Geoffrey Thomas.

The IRA unit gained access to their rooms by pretending to be British soldiers with important dispatches. When the men opened their doors they were shot and killed. A Times listing for McCormack and Wilde does not list any rank for the latter-in fact he was a discharged army officer who had been a british ex-consul in Spain. Leonard Wilde accessed June 11,2019McCormack's killing was a mistake. He was a member of the Royal Army Veterinary Corps and was in Ireland to buy horses for the British Army. He was shot in bed and Collins himself later acknowledged the error. Unlike the other British officers, McCormack, a Catholic from Castlebar, was buried in Ireland, at Glasnevin Cemetery, Dublin.The Times, Murdered Officers' Last Journey 25 November 1920 =Fitzwilliam Square= Captain John Scott Crawford, in charge of motor repair of the British Army Service Corps, narrowly escaped death after the IRA entered a guesthouse in Fitzwilliam Square where he was staying, looking for a Major Callaghan. On not finding their target, they debated whether or not to shoot Crawford. They decided not to shoot him as he was not on their list; instead they gave him 24 hours to leave Ireland, although the major left Ireland in no hurry following this close call. =Eastwood Hotel= In the Eastwood Hotel at 91 Lower Leeson Street the IRA failed to find their target, Captain Thomas Jennings. Other targets who escaped were Captain Jocelyn HardyTim Pat Coogan, Michael Collins: The Man Who Made Ireland, p.160 and Major William Lorraine King, a colleague of Hardy who was missing when Joe Dolan burst into King's room. According to the prim Todd Andrews, Dolan took revenge by giving King's half-naked mistress \\"a right scourging with a sword scabbard\\", and setting fire to the room afterwards.Todd Andrews, Dublin Made Me, Mercier Press, 1979, p. 153 Major Frank Murray Maxwell Hallowell Carew, an intelligence officer who with Captain Price had almost cornered 3rd Tipperary Brigade commander Seán Treacy a month before, was on the list. (Treacy had been killed by G men as he tried to shoot his way out of a trap on 14 October, a week before the day of the Cairo Gang assassinations.) When the IRA came calling for Murray, he had moved to an apartment across the street. He heard the gunfire at his former lodging and fired his revolver at an IRA sentry outside. The sentry was hit and took cover inside the house. The Volunteers moved on. Several IRA men carried sledgehammers with them the morning of 21 November, as they expected to encounter bolted doors. They did not find any, but T Ryle Dwyer claims that they used them to smash the skulls and faces of some of the officers they had shot.T Ryle Dwyer, The Squad and the Intelligence Operations of Michael Collins (Cork: Mercier, 2005). Two members of the Auxiliary Cadet Division, Temporary Cadets Frank Garniss, aged 34,Cadet Garness and Cecil Augustus Morris, aged 24,Cadet Morris were among a patrol of Auxiliaries who responded to the scene of one of the attacks, armed with .45 calibre Webley revolvers and a carbine. Garniss and Morris were shot and killed as they sought to cordon off the rear of one of the scenes of assassination.James Mackay, Michael Collins, A Life (Edinburgh and London: Mainstream Publishers, 1996).Michael Hopkinson, The Irish War of Independence (Montreal: McGill Queens University Press, 2002) A Times listing of killed and wounded reports that in addition to Caldow, Captain Brian Keenlyside, Colonel Hugh Montgomery, Major (Wilfrid) Woodcock, and Lieutenant Randolph Murray were wounded, but not killed. Montgomery died 10 December 1920 of the wounds he received on Bloody Sunday. Fatalities Nineteen men were shot. Fourteen were killed on 21 November; Montgomery died later, making fifteen in all. Five were wounded (including King's mistress). Ames, Angliss, Baggallay, Bennet, Dowling, Fitzgerald, McCormack, MacLean, Montgomery, Newberry, Price, Wilde, Smith, Morris and Garniss were killed. Keenlyside, Woodcock, Murray and Caldow were wounded. Peel and others escaped. The dead included members of the \\"Cairo Gang\\", British Army Courts-Martial officers, the two Auxiliaries and a civilian informant. Aftermath Of the IRA men involved, only Frank Teeling was captured during the operation. He was court-martialled and sentenced to hang, but escaped from Kilmainham Gaol before the sentence could be carried out. Patrick Moran and Thomas Whelan were arrested later and, despite their protestations of innocence and witnesses attesting to alibis, were hanged for murder in connection with the killings on 14 March 1921. The remaining Cairo Gang members, along with many other spies, fled to either Dublin Castle or England, fearing they were next on the IRA's hit list. Another member committed suicide in Dublin Castle. The deaths and flights dealt a severe blow to British intelligence gathering in Ireland. Igoe Gang Eventually another group of intelligence operatives led by Head Constable Eugene Igoe from Mayo took the fight to the IRA. Officially known as the Identification Branch of the Combined Intelligence Service (CIS), Igoe reported to Colonel Ormonde Winter. The Igoe Gang consisted of RIC personnel drawn from different parts of Ireland who patrolled the streets of Dublin in plain clothes, looking for wanted men.Tim Pat Coogan, Michael Collins: The Man Who Made Ireland. The Igoe Gang posed a serious threat to Collins's apparatus and in fact caught a Volunteer whom Collins had brought to Dublin to identify Igoe.William Henry [2012] Blood For Blood: The Black and Tan War in Galway. Mercier Press, Cork p.178–181 They were never penetrated by the IRA. Igoe later conducted secret service operations for Special Branch over many years in other countries, but never returned to his farm in Mayo out of fear of reprisal. Brigadier General Winter appeared on Igoe's behalf to obtain an increase in his pension in view of his many services to the Crown in Ireland and elsewhere.Ormonde Winter, A Report of the Intelligence Branch of the Chief Police Commissioner 1921, Public Record Office (PRO).

Directed by Italian filmmaker Mario Bava, the film stars John Saxon as Dr. Marcello Bassi and Letícia Román as Nora Davis. The plot revolves around a young woman named Nora, who travels to Rome and witnesses a murder. The police and Dr. Bassi don't believe her since a corpse can't be found. Several more murders follow, tied to a decade-long string of killings of victims chosen in alphabetical order. The Girl Who Knew Too Much is considered to be the first giallo film, a film genre with a mixture of thriller, sexploitation and horror conventions. An alternative cut titled Evil Eye was released in the United States by American International Pictures; this version features a score by Les Baxter, deletes several scenes, and adds others which place a greater emphasis on comedy compared to the Italian release.  Plot  The Spanish Steps, where Davis believes she has witnessed a murder On vacation, Nora Davis (Letícia Román) arrives by plane in Rome to visit her elderly ailing aunt. Nora's aunt is being treated by Dr. Marcello Bassi (John Saxon). Nora's aunt passes away on the first night of Nora's visit and she walks to the nearby hospital to notify Dr. Bassi. On the way, she is mugged and knocked out in Piazza di Spagna. When she wakes up, she sees the body of a dead woman lying on the ground near her; a bearded man pulls a knife out of the woman's back. Nora reports this to the police in the hospital, who don't believe her when they find no evidence and think that she is hallucinating. Later, at a cemetery, Nora meets a close friend of her aunt's, Laura Torrani (Valentina Cortese), who lives in the Piazza di Spagna. Laura plans to vacation soon and allows Nora to stay in her house for the remaining time of the vacation. Nora explores Laura's closet and drawers and comes across newspaper clippings of articles on a serial killer dubbed the \\"Alphabet Killer\\" due to his having alphabetically killed people according to their surnames. The killer has already murdered victims whose last names begin with \\"A,\\" \\"B,\\" and \\"C\\". Nora also finds that the last victim is Laura's sister, whom Nora had seen in a vision. According to the reports in the paper, this murder took place ten years ago. Nora then receives a telephone call, in which an anonymous voice tells her that \\"'D' is for death,\\" and informs her that she will be the killer's next victim. Nora receives help from Dr. Marcello, who takes her on a trip to various Roman tourist sites to calm her down as they become more romantically interested in each other. When they return to the Craven house, she receives a call from a person who orders her to go to a particular address. Nora goes there, and she is guided to a vacant room. With Dr. Marcello, she discovers that the voice that guided her to this spot is tape recorded, and the voice warns Nora to leave Rome before it is too late. Nora and Marcello discover that the room is leased to Landini. After several unsuccessful attempts to locate Landini, Nora and Marcello go to the beach to relax. Upon their return to the Craven house, they find Landini, who has been told that they were inquiring about him. Investigative reporter Landini (Dante DiPaolo) has secretly been following them since he spotted Nora in the square. The reporter wrote about the murder story when it first broke, but he believes that the police would catch the wrong person if he reported the details of the crime. Landini's refusal to publish a report of the murder has put him in financial need. Nora decides to help Landini, but, as they tour Rome, they find no clues. Nora visits Landini's apartment the next day, finding clues that lead her to think that he is the murderer and that she is his next intended victim, but Landini appears to have committed suicide. The same day, Laura returns to Rome from her vacation while Nora and Marcello plan to go to America the following morning. From reading the newspaper, Nora learns that the body of a young woman was found, and she recognizes it as the murdered woman she saw on the night of her arrival in Italy. After identifying the victim's corpse at the morgue, Nora believes that she has witnessed the murder. Alone in the house that night, Nora notices that the study door is open. On entering, she sees a man rising uncomfortably from his chair. Nora recognizes him as the man who had stood over the dead body she had seen after awakening from having been knocked unconscious upon her arrival in Italy. The man walks towards Nora but collapses to the floor, a knife in his back. Nora is then confronted by Laura who, enraged, confesses to the killings and explains that she stabbed her husband because of his attempts to turn her over to the police. Laura reveals that her desire to steal her sister's money compelled her to murder. Laura attempts to attack Nora, but Laura is suddenly shot dead by her husband. Nora finds that the bearded man she had seen in a daze actually was disposing of the body for his murdering wife. Nora then leaves Italy, happily reunited with Marcello. Cast Letícia Román in 1961. The Girl Who Knew Too Much was Román's first leading role. * Letícia Román as Nora Davis (Nora Drowson in Evil Eye) * John Saxon as Dr. Marcello Bassi * Valentina Cortese as Laura Craven-Toranni * Dante DiPaolo as Andrea Landini * Titti Tomaino as the Inspector * Luigi Bonos as the Hotel Clerk * Milo Quesada as De Vico * Robert Buchanan as Dr. Alessi * Marta Melocco as the murder victim Production Prior to working on The Girl Who Knew Too Much, Bava had taken a six-month break after filming the last of the special effects shots for his previous film Erik the Conqueror. Bava spent this extended period reading mystery and horror magazines. He pondered retiring from directing and thought he might only return to work on special effects for film. Bava was convinced to return to directing by Samuel Arkoff and Jim Nicholson, who had begun co-producing Italian films for release in the United States. The Girl Who Knew Too Much was the first film in this venture for Arkoff and Nicholson's company American International Pictures. The opening credits credit Enzo Corbucci, Ennio de Concini and Eliana de Sabata and the writers of the film, while crediting Mario Bava, Mino Guerrini and Franco Prosperi as collaborators. Sergio Corbucci is credited as Enzo Corbucci in this film. Italian screenwriter Luigi Cozzi has said that the original script was more of a romantic comedy but the film became more of a thriller as it went into production. Letícia Román was cast in The Girl Who Knew Too Much; her first leading role. Román knew actor John Saxon prior to production on the film. Saxon has stated that he was invited by Roman to work on the film by asking if he would be interested in an art film in Rome. Saxon agreed, but on receiving the script he found that he misunderstood her as she said horror film instead. Dante DiPaolo stated that Bava initially thought DiPaolo was too young for his role in the film, but after seeing his screen test he felt DiPaolo understood his part well and cast him in this film and later again in Blood and Black Lace. John Saxon was a Hollywood star who had just made Agostino in Italy. The Girl Who Knew Too Much began shooting on May 2, 1962. Director Mario Bava thought the plot was silly, and focused more on the technical aspects of the film.Shipka, 2011. p. 106 This included shooting the film in black and white, Bava's last film shot in this style. Bava had made earlier films in color, but films in the horror and thriller genre made in Italy were generally shot in black and white in this period. Location shooting in Rome took place at various locations including the Leonardo da Vinci–Fiumicino Airport and the Trinità dei Monti. Some set pieces were borrowed from other Italian films, such as the painting in Nora's aunt's house, which is from Divorce Italian Style. Saxon stated that he had initially gotten along with Bava during production. Later Saxon would be practicing judo on the beach which would upset Bava who felt as if Saxon was showing off. Saxon stated that later in a conversation with a producer for the film, that the producer said that Román convinced Saxon to enter the film as she said Saxon was in love with her. Saxon felt that Bava was perhaps initially annoyed at him as he felt his action might have interpreted from Bava as trying to usurp attention from Román. Filming finished in July 1962. Bava biographer Tim Lucas said that some re-shoots were apparently done towards the end of 1962. The theme song of the film is sung by Adriano Celentano. The film's score was by Roberto Nicolosi, who had previously worked with Bava on Black Sunday (1960) and Erik the Conqueror (1961). Release The Girl Who Knew Too Much was first released on February 10, 1963. The film grossed less than $27,000 on its opening and only weekend and failed to cover its own production cost. The film was the least commercially successful picture in Bava's directorial career. The giallo films were not popular among the Italian film audiences on its initial theatrical release as the genre never gained popularity in its home country until the release of Dario Argento's The Bird with the Crystal Plumage (1970) and The Cat o' Nine Tails (1971). The Girl Who Knew Too Much was released by American International Pictures in the United States on May 6, 1964, where it was shown on a double bill with Bava's Black Sabbath; this release of the film retitled it as Evil Eye.Curti, 2015. p. 79Heffernan, 2004. p. 151 Alterations between the two versions include the deletion of several scenes, including all references to marijuana, the addition of more comical scenes, and Roberto Nicolosi's jazz score being replaced with one performed by Les Baxter. The two versions also have different endings. When Bava's films were being released on DVD and Blu-ray, the Evil Eye edit of the film became more difficult to find as Bava's original Italian version of the film was used. This led to audiences knowing the film under its translated Italian title, The Girl Who Knew Too Much. Reception In a contemporary review, the Monthly Film Bulletin described the film as \\"a tolerably silly but quite enjoyable thriller\\". The reviewer praised the camerawork and acting by Valentina Cortese who he compared to Joan Crawford. The reviewer noted the plot, stating that \\"Bava, always a better cameraman than director hasn't Riccardo Freda's ability to make a merit of cliches, and often seems rather unhappy with his complicated plot, which is packed to the brim with red herrings, lurking shadows and sinister happenings known to thrillerdom.\\" Director Mario Bava did not look back positively on the film, claiming that he \\"thought [the film] was too preposterous. Perhaps it could have worked with James Stewart and Kim Novak, whereas I had... oh, well, I can't even remember their names.\\" The film has received a score of 71% on review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, with seven reviews posted, which note the stylish look to the film, but negatively point out its story. Sight & Sound stated that \\"Although certainly pioneering, The Girl Who Knew Too Much is a low-key, modest film. It would be Bava's subsequent production, the violent, striking Blood and Black Lace, that would announce the genre's arrival in bold primary colours.\\"  References FootnotesSources=    * *  External links   Category:1963 films Category:1963 comedy films Category:1960s mystery films Category:1960s psychological thriller films Category:1960s comedy thriller films Category:Italian films Category:Italian- language films Category:American International Pictures films Category:Italian black-and-white films Category:Films directed by Mario Bava Category:Films set in Rome Category:Giallo films Category:Italian thriller films Category:Films about cannabis Category:Films shot in Rome ","title":"The Girl Who Knew Too Much (1963 film)"},{"id":"2482605","title":"Port Hope station"},{"id":"2482611","text":"Aaron Keith Holbert (born January 9, 1973, in Torrance, California) is an American former professional baseball infielder for the St. Louis Cardinals and Cincinnati Reds of the Major League Baseball (MLB).

She was regent for her first born son, Antiochus, during the Anabase expedition of her husband, Antiochus III the Great, between 212 and 206 BC. Antiochus created a royal cult dedicated to her in 193 BC. In 192 BC she was pushed out of political life due to her husband's remarriage. Her last known activities are documented in 177–176 BC and relate to the court of her son, Seleucus IV.Beilman, A. Femmes en public dans le monde hellénistique, Malesherbes, Sedes, 2002, pg 45. Biography She was a daughter of King Mithridates II of Pontus and his wife Laodice. Her sister was Laodice of Pontus and her brother was Mithridates III of Pontus. = Queen = Laodice married Antiochus III around 221 BC in a ceremony at Zeugma and named queen at Antioch. Polybius states that she was promised to Antiochus III as “a virgin and aforenamed as wife to the king”.G. Ramsey, “The Queen and the City: Royal Female Intervention and Patronage in Hellenistic Civic Communities,” Gender & History, Vol 23, No. 3, 2011: 517. The fact that her parents named her ‘Laodice’ in the Seleucid female tradition suggests that her parents intended this marriage from her birth, and named her accordingly.Ramsey, “The Queen and the City,” 517. Like her sisters, her marriage was part of a diplomatic strategy to strengthen relations between the Seleucids and Pontus. Laodice gave birth to her eldest child, Antiochus, while her husband Antiochus III set out his expedition against Molon.Polybius, v. 43 During her marriage, it is believed that Laodice and her children sometimes followed Antiochus during his expeditions throughout his empire.P. Gauthier, Nouvelles Inscriptions de Sardes II, Hautes études du Monde Gréco-Romain, Droz, Genève, 1989, 65. J. Ma, Antiochos III et les Cités de l’Asie Mineure Occidentale, trad. S. Bardet, Paris, Les Belles Lettres, 2004, 49, 55. Laodice III bore Antiochus III eight children who were: Antiochus, Seleucus IV Philopator, Ardys, an unnamed daughter who was engaged to Demetrius I of Bactria, Laodice IV, Cleopatra I Syra, Antiochis and Antiochus IV Epiphanes (birth name Mithridates). Many inscriptions refer to Laodice as the “sister” or “sister-queen” of Antiochus III, and Laodice often referred to Antiochus as “brother”, despite the fact that the couple were only maternal first cousins.A. Beilman, Femmes en public dans le monde hellénistique, Malesherbes, Sedes, 2002, 44. Ramsey, “The Queen and the City,” 519. This was not an official title, but used for multiple reasons; it played up to attributions of loyalty and devoted like-mindedness of the couple, as well as affirming Laodice's position as a member of the dynasty, and her position as being an equal to her husband.Ramsey, \\"The Queen and the City,\\" 519, 520. Towns could use the term “sister-queen” to further praise Laodice as a faithful consort.Ramsey, \\"The Queen and the City,\\" 519. Furthermore, Laodice's position as ‘sister’ to Antiochus mimicked the traditions of the previous Hecatomnid dynasty that ruled Caria during the 4th century BC, integrating the Seleucids into that territory's traditions. This practice was also borrowed from the Greek world, were Ptolemy II's marriage to his full sister was likened to the divine union of Zeus and Hera, and started a tradition of representing wives as sisters in the Ptolemaic dynasty.J. Rowlandson, R. Takahashi, “Brother-Sister Marriage and Inheritance Strategies in Greco-Roman Egypt,” Journal of Roman Studies, vol. 99 (2009): 112. Laodice and Antiochus furthered the tradition of brother-sister rulers by arranging the marriage of two of their own children, Antiochus and Laodice, in 195 BC. In 192 BC Antiochus took a second wife, Euboea of Chalcis, which led to Laodice being pushed to the periphery of Antiochus' court.Beilman, Femmes en public, 44.https://www.livius.org/am-ao/antiochus/antiochus_iii.html It has been suggested that Laodice was repudiated by Antiochus in favour of his new wife, but there is no evidence for this. Although Antiochus' second wife did not have the political influence of Laodice, Laodice disappears from the public record until after the death of Antiochus.  Political power  Regency = In 210 BC, Antiochus, the king's eldest son, was made co-ruler with his father, at the age of 10 or 11 years old, in order to keep the throne secure while Antiochus III went on campaign in the east.Ramsey, “The Queen and the City,” 521. During this time Laodice most probably acted as regent. A clay seal impression is thought to show Antiochus the son in the foreground, with Laodice in the background, suggesting that she overtly displayed her power as ruler during her regency.P. Iossif, C. Lober, “Laodikai and the Goddess Nikephoros,” L’antiquité classique, Tome 76, 2007 : 65. The royal cult that Antiochus III initiated in 195 BC may have been a way for Antiochus to acknowledge Laodice for her good management of the kingdom during his absences.L. Capdetrey, Le pouvoir séleucide: Territoire, administration, finances d’un royaume hellénistique (312-129 avant J.-C.), Rennes : Presses Universitaires de Rennes, 2007, 351. = Benefactor = During and after her regency, Laodice continued to assert her political power by acting as a benefactor, or philanthropist. Philanthropic action was typical of Hellenistic queens as a way to further their power and assert their position, particularly in the religious sphere, but Laodice was unusually active and her donations addressed political problems and targeted depopulation and poverty by focusing on food and marriage.P. Gauthier, Les Cités Grecques et leurs Bienfaiteurs (Ive-Ier siècle avant J.-C.), Paris, École Français d’Athènes, 1985, 74. Ramsey, “The Queen and the City,” 511. Laodice's donations are evidenced in inscriptions of her honours, and her letters to the towns. In Sardis, Antiochus had imposed a tax of 5%, attached a billeted garrison and confiscated the gymnasium after the citizens of Sardis' resistance to him in 214 BC.Ramsey, \\"The Queen and the City,\\" 515. Ma, Antiochos III,49. However, in 213 BC, these punishments were greatly lessened, with a 3-year tax exemption, the donation of wood from the royal forest, the restoration of the gymnasium and a donation of 8000 litres of oil for the youths at the gymnasium. Some historians suggest that these actions may have been thanks to the influence of Laodice, as she is particularly honoured in the inscriptions following the donations.Ramsey, \\"The Queen and the City,\\" 515, 516. MA, Antiochos III, 153. In Teos in 203 BC, Laodice was thanked for helping the city, alongside her husband. The similarity of honours accorded to Laodice at Teos and at Iasos suggest that she acted as a benefactor in a similar manner.Gauthier, Nouvelles Inscriptions, 76. In Iasos, the city had suffered the loss of its traditional laws, its freedom, depopulation and poverty as well as an earthquake.Ramsey, \\"The Queen and the City,\\" 513. In 196 BC Laodice donated 1000 medimnus of wheat, the profits of which were to be used to ensure each woman getting married a dowry of three hundred Antiochian drachmai.Beilman, Femmes en public, 162. Ramsey, \\"The Queen and the City,\\" 512, 513. The funding for this came from land that belonged to Laodice, but her use of Strouthiôn, a royal administrator, suggests she did this acting as part of the royal administration rather than as a separate body.Beilman, Femmes en public, 162. Capdetrey, Le pouvoir séleucide, 314.  Honors  Civic Honors = For her help, Laodice received multiple honours, which often focused on honouring her symbolically as a mother.Ramsey, \\"The Queen and the City,\\" 518. It is not always clear if these honors were given before or after her benefaction of the city. The cities could have given them after in order to honour and thank the queen (probable in Sardis) or it could have been given before, in order to encourage the queen to act generously towards the city (possible in Teos).Ma, Antiochos III, 512. The giving of honours was the point of depart for a diplomatic exchange, in which the queen would be obliged by laws of exchange to accept the honours and act as a sort of patron to the city. As she received more honours, the cities honoured her in increasingly elaborate manners.Beilman, Femmes en Public, 46. In Sardis, an altar was made and dedicated to Laodice, and there was an annual festival with a sacrifice for the queen, king and children. These festivities were related to Zeus. In Teos, statues were built of both the king and the queen in the temple of Dionysos. There were sacrifices made to the king and queen during an annual celebration, Antiocheia Kai Laodikeia, with a banquet dedicated to the royal couple.Gauthier, Les Cités Grecques, 76. Foreign residents were also expected to hold their own sacrifice at home. An agora was built in the port with a fountain dedicated to Laodice, the water of which was to be used for civic sacrifices, funeral rituals, and bathwater for brides to be.Beilman, Femmes en Public, 46. Gauthier, Les Cités Grecques, 76. In order to draw the water, one would need to dress all in white and wear a crown.Ramsey, \\"The Queen and the City,\\" 514. The honours were meant to be “for the rest of time” but stopped after 189 BC when Antiochus was defeated by the Romans leading to the Treaty of Apamea. In Iasos Laodice was linked to Aphrodite, who represented sex, maternity and marriage. There was a religious festival on the birthday of the queen, in the month of Aphrodision, during which there would be a procession of the betrothed, dressed in white. Annually, a virgin girl was elected from a high status family, and named priestess of Laodice.Beilman, Femmes en public, 46. Ramsey, \\"The Queen and the City,\\" 518, 534. Later, these honours included funds that were dedicated to female education, connecting Laodice with education and the introduction of female citizens into public life.Ramsey, \\"The Queen and the City,\\" 523. These honours were to continue for 10 years, but ceased after 189 BC. = Royal Cult = In 192 BC, more than 10 years after his return from conquest, Antiochus III declared a cult dedicated to Laodice. He had already created a cult for himself in 209 BC, and this new cult was envisioned as a parallel to his own cult, with priestesses which mirrored his priests.Chaniotis, “The Divinity of Hellenistic Rulers,” in A Companion to the Hellenistic World, ed. A. Erskin, Oxford, Blackwell Publishing, 2003: 41. Beilman, Femmes en public, 44. Although the existence of previous honours helped in the development of the royal cult, they could not compete with the glamour of royal administrative festivities.Chaniotis, “The Divinity of Hellenistic Rulers,” 438. Ma, Antiochos III, 178. A royal cult was modelled on the worship of the gods, with a sacrifice, a procession of citizens wearing wreaths and their best clothes, and then competitions.Chaniotis, “The Divinity of Hellenistic Rulers,” 438. A priestess of the cult of Laodice was named in each city. In Nehavend, Laodice, daughter of Antiochus III and Laodice III was named the priestess of the cult of Laodice III, in order to help introduce her into her public role, and advance her position as consort and co-ruler with their son Antiochus.Beilman, Femmes en public, 45, 47. Capdetrey, Le pouvoir séleucide, 324. Ramsey, “The Queen and the City,” 520. In Caria, Berenice, of the Telmessus dynasty was named high priestess in order to further relations between the Seleucids and local dynasties, and unify the kingdom.Beilman, Femmes en public, 45. Capdetrey, Le pouvoir séleucide, 324. Other priestesses also came primarily from local dynasties and the royal family, though some historians theorise that the use of local dynasties may have been somewhat due to the fact that most Seleucid women were not available to be high priestesses, as they were involved in state marriages to neighbouring kings.Iossif, Lober, “Laodikai and the Goddess Nikephoros,” 65. Although the cult came quite a bit later than Laodice's regency, Antiochus claimed he started the cult in order to celebrate the virtue of Laodice and her piety.Gauthier, Nouvelles Inscriptions, 75. This has led historians to interpret the cult as a way of recognising Laodice for her management of the kingdom during the absence of the king.Capdetrey, Le pouvoir séleucide, 315. An alternative view is that the cult was started at a moment of weakness in the Seleucid Empire, and was useful in promoting unity throughout the empire.Capdetrey, Le pouvoir séleucide, 324. Rather than include the cult in legal acts, or writing to local governors (satraps) to spread the cult, Antiochus III wrote directly to the satraps to spread the cult, such as Anaximbrotos in Phrygia and Menedemos in the east.Iossif, Lober, “Laodikai and the Goddess Nikephoros,” 65. Ma, Antiochos III, 96. Some historians have interpreted this as a lack of interest on the part of Antiochus III. After Antiochos’ remarriage, Antiochus ceased his efforts to further the official cult of Laodice.Beilman, Femmes en public, 45. Seleucus IV may have perpetuated further honours related to Laodice by associating her with the goddess Nikephoros-Aphrodite around 177 BCE, due to the relationship of Aphrodite to queens and the appearance of bronzes depicting the goddess around the possible time of Laodice's death.Iossif, Lober, “Laodikai and the Goddess Nikephoros,” 76, 87. The royal children may have been moved to assert the sacredness of Laodice and her position as queen due to the second marriage by Antiochus.Iossif, Lober, “Laodikai and the Goddess Nikephoros,” 83.

It was released in 1990 and published by Micro Style as a sequel to Rick Dangerous.  Plot  At the end of Rick Dangerous 1, we learn that an alien invasion is imminent. As Rick Dangerous 2 starts, UFOs land in London. The image shift in the character of Rick Dangerous is evident from the start: The coat is nowhere to be found and the Indiana Jones-style hat from the previous episode is almost symbolically blown off by a laser beam coming from one of the spaceships in the introduction sequence. One UFO lands in Hyde Park, and Rick goes there to settle the score with the aliens.  Gameplay  There are a number of changes to the game play that make the Rick Dangerous 2 more complex and more challenging than its predecessor. For a start, Rick is now armed with a laser gun and bombs that can not only be placed but slid, making way for strategic bomb-placement. The pogo stick is replaced by a punch attack. Rick can also employ a special flying vehicle in certain areas of the game that allows for faster movement, but this may also become a danger factor. Also, while there is a linear story to the game, the first four levels may be played in any order. Completing these four levels (Hyde Park, the ice caverns on the planet Freezia, the deep forest of Vegetablia and the \\"atomic mud mines\\") unlocks the fifth and final level, the Fat Guy's Headquarters, which ends in a boss fight. This level can then be played as often as desired, until the player quits the game, but the endgame movie only plays if the player completes all five levels in order.  Unclosed ending  The end of Rick Dangerous 2 does not complete the story. The game finishes with a cliffhanger, with the Fat Guy escaping at the final moment via a teleporter device, and Rick following him with the familiar captions \\"What will Rick do next?\\". Though this may have hinted another sequel to the story, Rick Dangerous 3 was never made. Although a Rick Dangerous II½ was given away by The One Amiga on a cover disk, this was only a few additional levels and more of a demo than an actual sequel. Many of the concepts featured in these levels were later used in a Super Nintendo Entertainment System game titled Danger Dan, which was also unfinished. Both games were re-released under the budget label Kixx.  Reception  The ZX Spectrum version fared well amongst its respective magazines.

It is the largest city by the lake and one of the more important cultural, educational and economic hubs in the region. Due to its favorable location and accessibility by both road and rail, Keszthely and the surrounding area is a preferred holiday destination. Though settled since at least Roman times (the Keszthely culture of Romance pannonian language), the first historical evidence of the town Keszthely dates from a 1247 document. Since 1421, Keszthely has been a market town. The Faculty for Agriculture of University of Pannonia is located in Keszthely. George Fejer, Hungarian author and librarian at the University of Pest, was born in Keszthely in 1766. Etymology The name comes from Slavic *Kostel, see also the etymology of Kesztölc. Hungarian hely: a site, a location. The Hungarian part of the name could be potentially formed by a phonetic similarity and folk etymology Kesztely→Keszthely. 1247 Kesztel.  Location  The city of Keszthely is located at the northwest corner of Lake Balaton, on the shore of one of the biggest lakes in Central Europe. The city is surrounded by forests and rolling hills to the north, plains to the south east and the lake. South from the city lies Kis-Balaton (Little Balaton), a swamp which is a part of the Zala river delta and which acts as a natural water purifier for Lake Balaton. The swamp is particularly known as a water fowl habitat and enjoys international recognition and protection as a natural reserve. The city also enjoys the proximity of Hévíz, a town famous for its spa and health services. Keszthely is very close to some northern Balaton wine regions which are known to produce high quality white wines from locally cultivated varieties. Keszthely is easily and rather quickly accessible by car from both Budapest, the capital of Hungary, and Vienna, the capital of Austria. Direct bus services between Keszthely and Budapest run several times a day. Museum Balaton Museum The Balaton Museum Association was established in 1898 for among all Sandor Lovassy\`s initiation. The starting of the museum building in Keszthely was in 1925 with the help of count Taszilo Festetics, on the basis of Györgyi Denes\`s design in Neo-baroque style. With the building of the first museum in Zala county, the stones from pulled down stables next to Festetics Mannsion were used as well. The collection shows the archeological, ethnographical, historical and natural scientific values of the Balaton area.

MSTP uses BPDUs to exchange information between spanning-tree compatible devices, to prevent loops in each MSTI (Multiple Spanning Tree Instances) and in the CIST (Common and Internal Spanning Tree), by selecting active and blocked paths. This is done as well as in STP without the need of manually enabling backup links and getting rid of bridge loops danger. Moreover, MSTP allows frames/packets assigned to different VLANs to follow separate paths, each based on an independent MSTI, within MST Regions composed of LANs and or MST Bridges. These Regions and the other Bridges and LANs are connected into a single Common Spanning Tree (CST).  History and motivation  It was originally defined in IEEE 802.1s as an amendment to 802.1Q, 1998 edition and later merged into IEEE 802.1Q-2005 Standard, clearly defines an extension or an evolution of Radia Perlman's Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) and the Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP). It has some similarities with Cisco Systems' Multiple Instances Spanning Tree Protocol (MISTP), but there are some differences. The original STP and RSTP work on the physical link level, preventing bridge loops when redundant paths are present. However, when a LAN is virtualized using VLAN trunking, each physical link represents multiple logical connections. Blocking a physical link blocks all its logical links and forces all traffic through the remaining physical links within the spanning tree. Redundant links cannot be utilized at all. Moreover, without careful network design, seemingly redundant links on the physical level may be used to connect different VLANs and blocking any of them may disconnect one or more VLANs, causing bad paths. Instead, MSTP provides a potentially better utilization of alternate paths by enabling the use of alternate spanning trees for different VLANs or groups of VLANs.  Main Entities  Multiple Spanning Tree Instances (MSTI) = Different Spanning trees created by different MSTIs on the same physical layout. As MSTP enables grouping and mapping VLANs into different spanning tree instances, there's an urge of determining a group or set of VLANs, which are all using the same spanning tree, this is what we come to know as a MSTI. Each instance defines a single forwarding topology for an exclusive set of VLANs, by contrast, STP or RSTP networks contains only a single spanning tree instance for the entire network, which contains all the VLANs. A region can include: * Internal Spanning-Tree Instance (IST): Default spanning tree instance in any MST region. All VLANs in this IST instance conform a single spanning tree topology, allowing only one forwarding path between any two nodes. It also provides the root switch for any VLAN configured switches which are not specifically assigned to a MSTI. * Multiple Spanning Tree Instance (MSTI): Unlike IST, this kind of instance comprises all static VLANs specifically assigned to it and at least, must include one VLAN. While each MSTI can have multiple VLANs, each VLAN can be associated with only one MSTI.. = MSTP Regions = MSTIs in different regions. A set of interconnected switches that must have configured the same VLANs and MSTIs, also have the same following parameters: * MST Configuration Name * Revision Level * Configuration Digest: Mapping of which VLAN are mapped to which MST instances. An MSTI is unable to span across MST regions because of its inherent locality to a single MST region. This is done by an identifying number for each MSTI. For achieving the task of assigning each bridge to a region, each switch/bridge must compare their MST Configuration Identifiers (Format Selector, Region Name, Revision Level and Configuration Digest), either of them represents VLAN to MSTIs mapping for each bridge. = Common and Internal Spanning Tree (CST/CIST) = CIST operates links between regions and to SST devices. We can differentiate two kinds of conformated Spanning Trees into the different networks created by MSTP, these are: * Common Spanning Tree (CST): Administers the connectivity among MST regions, STP LANs and RSTP LANs in a bridged network. * Common Internal Spanning Tree (CIST): Identifies regions in a network and administers the CIST root bridge for the network, for each region and for each spanning tree instance in each region. It's also the default spanning tree instance of MSTP so that any VLAN which isn't a member of a particular MSTI, will be a member of the CIST. Furthermore, works as well as the spanning tree that runs between regions and between MST regions and Single Spanning Tree (SST) entities. The role of the Common Spanning Tree (CST) in a network, and the Common and Internal Spanning Tree (CIST) configured on each device, is to prevent loops within a wider network that may span more than one MSTP Region and parts of the network running in legacy STP or RSTP mode. = MSTP Bridge Protocol Data Units (BPDU) = Its main function is enabling MSTP to select its root bridges for the proper CIST and each MSTI. MSTP includes all its spanning tree information in a single BPDU format. Not only does reduce the number of BPDUs required on a LANs to communicate spanning tree information for each VLAN, but it also ensures backward compatibility with RSTP (and in effect, classic STP too). BPDUs' general format comprises a common generic portion -octets 1 to 36- that are based on those defined in IEEE Standard 802.1D,2004, followed by components that are specific to CIST -octets 37 to 102. Components specific to each MSTI are added to this BPDUs data block. BPDU table info and STP BPDUs show a deeper resume of the MSTP BPDU format and, besides, some additional information about how was this object structured in older or different versions of this protocol as STP and RSTP, maintaining its compatibility. = MSTP Configuration Identification = In case there is an allocation of VIDs (VLAN IDs) into a MST Region which differs within the different bridges that compound it, frames for some VIDs might be duplicated or even not delivered to some LANs at all. To avoid this, MST Bridges check that they are allocating VIDs to the same spanning trees as their neighboring MST Bridges in the same Region by transmitting and receiving MST Configuration Identifiers along with the spanning tree information. These MST Configuration Identifiers, while compact, are designed so that two matching identifiers have a very high probability of denoting the same configuration even in the absence of any supporting management practice for identifier allocation. Either one of this \\"objects\\" contains the following: * Configuration Identifier Format Selector: Indicates the use which is going to be given to the following components. * Configuration Name * Revision Level and the Configuration Digest: A 16B signature HMAC-MD5 Algorithms created from the MST Configuration Table. This object is specific and unique of MSTP, neither STP or RSTP use it.  Protocol Operation  MSTP configures for every VLAN a single spanning tree active topology in a manner that there's at least one data route between any two end stations, eliminating data loops. It specifies various \\"objects\\" allowing out the algorithm to operate in a proper way. The different bridges in the various VLANs start advertising their own configuration to other bridges using the MST Configuration Identifier in order to allocate frames with given VIDs (VLAN ID) to any of the different MSTI. A priority vector is utilized to construct the CIST, it connects all the bridges and LANs in a Bridged LAN and ensures that paths within each region are always preferred to paths outside the Region. Besides, there is a MSTI priority vector, this one compromises the necessary information to build up a deterministic and independently manageable active topology for any given MSTI within each region. Additionally, comparisons and calculations done by each bridge select a CIST priority vector for each Port (based on priority vectors, MST Configuration Identifiers and on an incremental Path Cost associated to each receiving port). This leads to one bridge been selected as the CIST Root of the Bridged LAN; then, a minimum cost path to the root is shifted out for each Bridge and LANs (thus preventing loops and ensuring full connectivity between VLANs). Subsequently, in each region, the bridge whose minimum cost path to the root doesn't pass through another bridge with the same MST Conf.ID will be identified as its Region's CIST Regional Root. Conversely, each Bridge whose minimum cost path to the Root is through a Bridge using the same MST Configuration Identifier is identified as being in the same MST Region as that Bridge. In summary, MSTP encodes some additional information in its BPDU regarding region information and configuration, each of these messages conveys the spanning tree information for each instance. Each instance can be assigned several configured VLANs, frames (packets) assigned to these VLANs operate in this spanning tree instance whenever they are inside the MST region. To avoid conveying their entire VLAN to spanning tree mapping in each BPDU, bridges encode an MD5 digest of their VLAN to instance table in the MSTP BPDU. This digest is then used by other MSTP bridges, along with other administratively configured values, to determine if the neighboring bridge is in the same MST region as itself.  Port Roles  Common Internal Spanning Tree Ports = * Root: Provides the minimum cost path from the Bridge to the CIST Root through the Regional Root. * Designated: Provides the least cost path from the attached LAN through the Bridge to the CIST Root. * Alternate or Backup: Provides connectivity if other Bridges, Bridges Ports or LANs fail or are erased. = Multiple Spanning Tree Instance Ports = * Root: Provides the minimum cost path from the Bridge to the MSTI Regional Root. * Designated: Provides the least cost path from the attached LANs through the Bridge to the Regional Root. * Master: Provides connectivity from the Region to a CIST Root that lies outside the Region. The Bridge Port that is the CIST Root port for the CIST Regional Root is the Master port for all MSTI. * Alternate or Backup: Provides connectivity if other Bridges, Bridges ports or LANs fail or are erased.  RSTP compatibility  MSTP is designed to be STP and RSTP compatible and interoperable without additional operational management practice, this is due to a set of measurements based on RSTP (Clause 17 of IEEE Std 802.1D, 2004 Edition) intending to provide the capability for frames assigned to different VLANs, to be transmitted along different paths within MST Regions. Both protocols have in common various issues such as: the selection of the CIST Root Bridge (it uses the same fundamental algorithm, 17.3.1 of IEEE Std 802.1D, 2004 Edition, but with extended priority vector components within MST Regions), the selection of the MSTI Root Bridge and computation of port roles for each MSTI, the port roles used by the CIST are the same as those of STP and RSTP (with the exception of the Master Port), and the state variables associated with each port. Into the bargain, they also share some problems as, for instance: MSTP can't protect against temporary loops caused by the inter-connection of two LANs segments by devices other than the Bridges that operate invisibly with respect to support of the Bridges' MAC Internal Sublayer Service. For all the above, it can be concluded that MSTP is fully compatible with RSTP bridges, an MSTP BPDU can be interpreted by an RSTP bridge as an RSTP BPDU. This not only allows compatibility with RSTP bridges without configuration changes, but also causes any RSTP bridges outside of an MSTP Region to see the region as a single RSTP bridge, regardless of the number of MSTP bridges inside the region itself.  Protocol configuration  This section is mainly oriented to provide any user a proper manner of configuring a MSTP network over Cisco devices. = Before configuring MSTP = Be sure of having configured VLANs and having associated them with switch ports, afterwards determine: MSTP Regions, revision level and instances; which VLANs and switch ports will belong to which MSTIs and, finally, which devices do you want to be root bridges for each MSTI. = Configuration guidelines for MSTP = Simple network topology for MSTP trials. # Switches must have the same MST configuration identification elements (region name, revision level and VLAN to MSTI mapping) to be in the same MST region. When configuring multiple MST regions for MSTP, MSTIs are locally significant within an MST region. MSTIs will not span from one region to another region. # Common and Internal Spanning Tree (CIST) is the default spanning tree instance for MSTP. This means that all VLANs that are not explicitly configured into another MSTI are members of the CIST. # The software supports a single instance of the MSTP Algorithm consisting of the CIST and up to 15 MSTIs. A VLAN can only be mapped to one MSTI or to the CIST. One VLAN mapped to multiple spanning trees is not allowed. All the VLANs are mapped to the CIST by default. Once a VLAN is mapped to a specified MSTI, it is removed from the CIST.To avoid unnecessary STP processing, a port that is attached to a LAN with no other bridges/switches attached, can be configured as an edge port. An example of how to configure a simple, three switch MSTP topology wherein a layer-two access switch carries four VLANs and has two uplinks to two distribution switches, can be found here: MSTP Configuration Guide A good configuration view, from the above-mentioned example shall be: S3# show spanning-tree mst ##### MST0 vlans mapped: 1-19,21-39,41-4094 Bridge address 000e.8316.f500 priority 32768 (32768 sysid 0) Root address 0013.c412.0f00 priority 0 (0 sysid 0) port Fa0/13 path cost 0 Regional Root address 0013.c412.0f00 priority 0 (0 sysid 0) internal cost 200000 rem hops 19 Operational hello time 2, forward delay 15, max age 20, txholdcount 6 Configured hello time 2, forward delay 15, max age 20, max hops 20 Interface Role Sts Cost Prio.Nbr Type \\\\---------------- ---- --- --------- -------- -------------------------------- Fa0/13 Root FWD 200000 128.13 P2p Fa0/16 Altn BLK 200000 128.16 P2p ##### MST1 vlans mapped: 20,40 Bridge address 000e.8316.f500 priority 32769 (32768 sysid 1) Root address 000f.345f.1680 priority 1 (0 sysid 1) port Fa0/16 cost 200000 rem hops 19 Interface Role Sts Cost Prio.Nbr Type \\\\---------------- ---- --- --------- -------- -------------------------------- Fa0/13 Altn BLK 200000 128.13 P2p Fa0/16 Root FWD 200000 128.16 P2p  Extensions  Alternative Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol (AMSTP) = The first skel of this protocol was proposed in. AMSTP is a simplified one tree instance rooted at each edge bridge in the core to forward frames.  Protocol operation  To set up these trees, AMSTP relies in one basic tree which will be used to obtain instances (named Alternate Multiple Spanning Tree Instances – AMSTI), until one of them is built per switch for the network. The process applied to build up the main/basic tree is the same as in RSTP. In summary, firstly a bridge must be elected as the Root Bridge (this is done by the emission of BPDUs from each switch on the network periodically, every \\"Hello Time\\", and selecting the lowest Bridge ID). Then, every switch will compute and calculate its cost to the Root Bridge and, afterwards, the root ports must be elected by selecting the one which receives the best BPDU, this is, the one that announces minimum path cost to root bridge.  BPDUs  AMSTP BPDUs use the same local multicast protocol addresses than STP and have a structure that resembles MSTP BPDUs since both are comprised essentially of a basic BPDU and several AM- Records, allowing full-backwards compatibility with RSTP and STP standard protocols. Each of the AM-Records contains the data used to negotiate a specific tree instance (AMSTI). Every ABridge, except for the elected root bridge, creates an AM-Record for its own spanning tree instances. They are used by connected ports of neighboring switches to negotiate the transitions of each tree instance with a proposal/agreement mechanism. = ABRIDGES = This protocol, developed in emphasizes in the terms of efficiency in network usage and path length. That's the main cause why it uses AMSTP, a simplified and self-configuring version of MSTP protocol. Abridges can be described as a two-tiered hierarchy of layer-two switches in which network islands running independent rapid spanning tree protocols communicate through a core formed by island root bridges (ABridges). As it has been mentioned, it is focused in terms of efficiency, this is due to the ability of AMSTP to provide optimum paths in the core mesh and the usage of RSTP to aggregate efficiently the traffic at islands networks. Its convergence speed is as fast as RSTP and MSTP.  Architecture  Two-layer network proposal for ABridges. With the objective of enhancing the properties of Abridges protocol, a two-level hierarchical link layer infrastructure in which segmentation is performed at link layer is proposed. The core will be composed, primarily, by Abridges (Bridges using an implementation of AMSTP) and will oversee connecting the leaf access networks that are referred to as \\"access layer\\". Besides, each of this access networks, also called islands, will be a layer-two sub-network using STP connected to one or more Abridges.  Protocol operation  Inside every island or access network a bridge is automatically elected to behave as the Root Bridge, this one bridge will behave as a gateway, allowing the forwarding of frames from the core to an island and conversely. Just one Abridge is going to perform these gateway functions, although many could be connected. Communication among 802.1D bridges and between standard 802.1D bridges and ABridges does not require point-to-point connections. The ABridge receiving an ARP frame from an island host obtains the island in which the destination is located by asking an ARP server where the host was previously registered by its island ABridge. This server stores the IP to MAC mapping and the island ABridge ID. The ARP servers distribute its load based on equal result of short hashing of the IP addresses served. The core self-configures and the operation is transparent to all hosts and standard switches at islands.  ABridges functionality  ABridges is composed by three basic functional modules, which could be resumed in: * STD Bridge: Performs standard bridging functions with the nodes of its island. The access functionality resides on the access ports of this module, which has an equivalent behavior to a standard bridge acting as a root bridge. * AMSTP Routing: Routes frames between Abridges and the Gateway. It has core ports, either of them interconnect ABridges, which learn root bridge IDs from the AMSTP BPDUs received and store this information in a database, known as \\"Forwarding Database\\". * GateWay: Interconnects the above-mentioned modules. Abridges will configure each of their ports to be part either of the core or of an island, this port self-configuration is done with very simple stipulations: if a port is not connected to another Abridge using a point-to- point link, it will turn itself an access port; on the other hand, ports directly connected to another Abridge are configured as core ports. This auto- configuration mechanism is pretty like the one used in RSTP.  ARP and ABridge resolution  As any layer-two based protocol, ABridges uses ARP broadcasts to obtain the link layer address associated to an IP address at the same LAN or VLAN. That is the main cause why avoiding overflooding is a matter of paramount priority; to limit this broadcast traffic, is recommended the use of distributed load ARP servers, although its use is not compulsory.

The phrase is ascribed to the Roman emperor Vespasian (ruled AD 69–79). History Vespasienne\\" in Montreal, Canada, 1930 A tax on the disposal of urine was first imposed by Emperor Nero under the name of “vectigal urinae” in the 1st century AD. The tax was removed after a while, but it was re-enacted by Vespasian around 70 AD in order to fill the treasury. Vespasian imposed a Urine Tax () on the distribution of urine from Rome's public urinals (the Roman lower classes urinated into pots, which were later emptied into cesspools). The urine collected from these public urinals was sold as an ingredient for several chemical processes. It was used in tanning, wool production, and also by launderers as a source of ammonia to clean and whiten woollen togas. The buyers of the urine paid the tax. The Roman historian Suetonius reports that when Vespasian's son Titus complained about the disgusting nature of the tax, his father held up a gold coin and asked whether he felt offended by its smell (sciscitans num odore offenderetur). When Titus said \\"No,\\" Vespasian replied, \\"Yet it comes from urine\\" (Atqui ex lotio est).Suetonius, Vespasian 23. English, Latin. Cf. Dio Cassius, Roman History, bk. 65, ch. 14.5 English, Greek/French (66, 14) The phrase pecunia non olet is still used today to say that the value of money is not tainted by its origins. Vespasian's name still attaches to public urinals in France (vespasienne) and Italy (vespasiano). In literature In his description of money and the circulation of commodities generally, Karl Marx refers to this phrase when he observes \\"since every commodity disappears when it becomes money it is impossible to tell from the money itself how it got into the hands of its possessor, or what article has been changed into it. 'Non olet', from whatever source it may come.\\"Marx, Karl (1990) \\"Capital Volume 1\\", Penguin Books, London, p. 205 \\"Vespasian's axiom\\" is also referred to in passing in the Balzac short story Sarrasine in connection with the mysterious origins of the wealth of a Parisian family.

Unlike many other Red-Green coalitions, the \\"green\\" here was the colour of a centrist eurosceptic Nordic agrarian party rather than an actual green political movement. It governed from 2005 until Labour Party leader Jens Stoltenberg resigned his cabinet on 16 October 2013 following the coalition's defeat in the 2013 elections. Opponents of the Red-Green Coalition sometimes referred to the coalition by other names. The Norwegian centre-right parties, comprising Conservatives, Progress Party, Christian Democrats and Liberal Party usually called it a \\"socialist coalition\\". The Red Electoral Alliance feels that \\"red\\" is not a descriptive colour for this coalition and therefore uses \\"pale red\\". Similarly, the Green Party and the Liberal Party, which also use green as their color, claim that the three parties do not deserve the green color. After the 2013 election defeat, the \\"red-green parties\\" has continued to be used informally as a moniker for the former coalition partners, although the alliance between the parties has been formally dissolved.  History  The coalition was established in 2005 to constitute an alternative to the centre-right government of Kjell Magne Bondevik, and won the 2005 Norwegian parliamentary election with a slight majority. The Labour- led centre-left government formed was the first majority government in Norway since 1985. It replaced the Bondevik government on 17 October 2005. However, different views between the three parties taking part in the coalition on several important issues led to tough negotiations at Soria Moria in Oslo to put their differences aside in order to reach a common platform. The victory was a historical landmark for a number of reasons. The Labour Party had never been a member of a coalition government, except for a short interim at the end of World War II. The Socialist Left Party had never participated in any government, and historically had been unwilling to co-operate with Labour. In addition, the Centre Party is co-operating with the centre-left of Norwegian politics for the first time, having previously formed governments with both the Conservatives and the Christian Democratic Party on several occasions. A good relationship between the leader of Labour Party, Jens Stoltenberg, and of the Socialist Left, Kristin Halvorsen, has been considered a major factor in forming the alliance. Halvorsen was considered more pragmatic and moderate than some of her old-guard party colleagues; the Socialist People's Party, one of SV's predecessors, was established in the early 1960s as an ideological opponent to Labour's foreign policy, and it was the main opponent to NATO membership. After the September 2005 election, some old members criticised Halvorsen for being too benign towards Labour. The 2009 parliamentary elections resulted in a renewed majority for the Red-Green coalition, with 86 seats out of 169. The Socialist Left Party lost four seats in parliament, while the Labour Party gained three. The successful re-election of a sitting government is a rare event in Norway, and had not happened since 1993.

Animal Planet. Accessed 03/11/03 at http://animal.discovery.com/fansites/jeffcorwin/carnival/crawler/leafant.html. They are absent from Chile. They cut leaves to provide a substrate for the fungus farms which are their principal source of food. Their societies are among the most complex found in social insects. A. sexdens is an ecologically important species, but also an agricultural pest. Other Atta species, such as Atta texana, Atta cephalotes and others, have similar behavior and ecology.  Description  Colony architecture = A. sexdens colonies are primarily subterranean with a mound of excavated material on the surface. The diameter of the colony may reach 10 m with a depth of 6 m. The colonies contain up to 2000 chambers with a combined volume of more than 20 m3. The two basic types of chambers are fungus farms and waste chambers. The farms contain the fungal culture which sustains the colony and hosts larvae and pupae. The waste chambers are located at the rim of the colony and are significantly larger. They are used to dispose used fungal culture and dead ants. A mature colony contains 5–8 million workers. The colony often forms the centerpiece of a large jungle clearing. At the top of the mound are structures resembling sand castles surrounding hundreds of openings to the colony. Positioning the openings on top of these structures minimises the amount of rainwater flowing into the colony. The openings also have an important role in air conditioning. As the ant activity and fungal metabolism heat up the colony, hot air rises through the central passageways. Simultaneously, fresh air is drawn in from the openings at the rim of the colony. = Anatomy = A. sexdens follows the basic body plan of ants fairly closely. They have sharp spikes or hooks rising from their heads and midsections to deter predators. Another distinguishing feature is a relatively large, two-lobed head. Its purpose is to accommodate the large muscles moving the well-developed mandibles. In addition to the queen, the colony contains four castes of sterile female workers, and seasonally some winged virgin queens and males:EnchantedLearning.com. 2003. \\"Ant\\" (On-line ). Accessed 03/18/03 at http://www.enchantedlearning.com/subjects/insects/ant/Antcoloringpage.shtml. *Soldiers are the physically largest worker caste, with a head width of 3 mm and well-developed sharp mandibles. They are completely dedicated to defence, and do not participate in the running of the colony. In the event of attack by a predator, the soldiers storm out of the nest and attempt to overpower the aggressor. Their bite can easily penetrate human skin. The soldier caste is expensive to maintain, so they are absent from young colonies with less than 100,000 workers. *Forager-excavators are the second-largest caste, with an average head width of 2.2 mm. They are responsible for venturing out to cut pieces of leaves and carry them back to the colony to feed the fungus. They also excavate new chambers to the colony. *Within-nest specialists have an average head width of 1.4 mm. They usually remain inside the colony, where they process the leaf material brought in by the foragers to a smaller form. They also dispose of waste, help the gardener-nurse caste to take care of larger larvae, and attend to the queen. *Gardener-nurses have an average head width of 1 mm. They are the physically smallest caste, less massive than the larger, more robust soldiers by a factor of several hundred. Their tasks are to attend to the fungal culture and to the developing eggs, larvae, and pupae. *The queen is the largest ant in the colony, outweighing the smaller worker by a factor of 700. She is also the only member of the colony capable of reproducing. The queen resides in a special chamber, where she is continually fed, cleaned, and protected by workers. The queens have a lifespan of 10–20 years. Considerable variation in size occurs within the castes, some of which may be related to the division of labour. Some researchers separate seven castes, while others dismiss the idea of caste altogether. The division of labour also depends on the age of the worker. Foraging expeditions are hazardous, so are handled by older, thus more expendable, members of the caste. = Development = A. sexdens, like all ants, has four stages of development: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Their developmental larval stages are observed associated with fungal hyphae, and possess unique morphological features, compared to other ants. They are, like all hymenopterans, haplodiploid, meaning males are haploid (one of each chromosome) and females, including workers, are diploid (a pair of each chromosome). Sex is determined by the type of egg laid. Unfertilized eggs will turn out to be males, which are strictly used for mating and are short-lived. Fertilized eggs produce females. The caste of the resulting adult depends on environmental cues. Three to four weeks after being laid, the egg hatches and a larva emerges. In Atta ants, the larvae are fed by secretions from gardener-nurse ants and trophic eggs (unfertilized eggs used as food). The larvae, after an additional three to four weeks pupate. Their pupae are cocoonless, as are all of the subfamily Myrmicinae. After three to four more weeks, the pupae hatch into adult workers. A. sexdens larvae grow embedded in the fungal garden. Despite being surrounded by food, they are incapable of feeding themselves. Their adult sisters constantly feed and clean them. This is not a primitive feature. On the contrary, only the most advanced ant societies can expend such lavish care to their offspring as required by Atta larvae. All female eggs are identical when laid. The caste of the resulting worker is determined by the conditions, which are in turn regulated by adult workers. The most important factor is the quantity of food. The largest amount of food results in virgin queens, while slightly less food creates soldiers. A shortage of one caste causes the workers to produce more ants of that caste. A drastic reduction in the work force may cause the colony to revert to the caste structure of a young colony, which does not have soldiers.  Behavior  Foraging = A. sexdens workers forage leaves up to a range of 60 m from the colony. The scouting workers leave behind a trail of pheromones after they discover a source of suitable plant material. Other workers follow this trail to the leaves. They cut the plant material to pieces suitable for an individual ant to carry back to the colony. Smaller workers sometimes ride on the leaf pieces while the foragers carry them. The purpose of this behavior is not known for certain, but may be to protect the exposed foragers from attacks by parasitic insects. These insects include flies of the family Phoridae which lay their eggs on foragers. The resulting larvae eat the ants alive. = Fungus cultivation = A. sexdens, like all leafcutter ants, is mycophagic. They live in a symbiotic relationship with a fungus belonging to the subphylum Basidiomycota. Leaves and other soft plant material brought into the nest by the foragers is chewed into a pulp and fertilized with faeces. A small piece of fungus is placed on this substrate. The gardener-nurse caste takes care of the cultivation, transplanting fungus onto fresh substrate and weeding out wrong species of fungus, such as a parasitic Escovopsis, which sometimes can contaminate nests. They also use secretions from their salivary glands and help form antibiotic- producing Streptomyces bacteria to keep their fungal gardens a strict monoculture.Poulsen, M. 2002. \\"Leaf-cutting ants and their fungus\\" (On-line ). Accessed 03/19/2003 at http://www.webspawner.com/users/michaelpoulsen2003/index.html. The gardener- nurses also cut pieces of mycelium for the other castes to eat. In addition to the fungus, the A. sexdens adults feed on plant sap. They are the only source of nutrition for the ants, apart from the trophic eggs laid by the queen when the colony is young. The identity of the fungus remains a mystery. It is known that they are a species of the basidiomycete family Lepiotaceae. Some researchers believe all fungus-growing ants cultivate just one species, Leucocoprinus gongylophorus. The fungus produces special structures, called gongylidia, which have evolved to be eaten by ants.Wirth, R., H. Herz, R. Ryel, W. Beyschlag, B. Holldobler. 2003. Herbivory of Leaf-cutting Ants. New York: Springer. = Cleaning = A. sexdens workers spend a considerable time cleaning each other and the queen. They also spread antibiotic secretions from their metapleural glands on their bodies. Dirt collected by licking is stored in the workers' infrabuccal cavities, which are special recesses in their mouths. The purpose of these activities is to avoid infections, especially by parasitic fungi. Several fungus species, such as Cordyceps, specially infect and kill ants. All waste in the nest, including infrabuccal pellets, spent substrate from the gardens, and dead ants are carried in the waste chambers to avoid contamination. Feces, however, are not carried away, but used to fertilise the fungal gardens. The waste chambers are larger than the human head and located at the rim of the colony. There, the waste can decompose without endangering the ants. Due to the high concentration of various nutrients in the decomposing waste, a thick net of plant roots usually permeates the compost. = Reproduction = From late October to mid-December, the A. sexdens colonies produce winged virgin queens and males. Before the nuptial flight, young queens visit the colony's fungal gardens and place a small piece of fungal mycelium in their infrabuccal cavities. During their nuptial flights, the queens mate with several males, which die shortly after. The queen retains the sperm in a special organ for the rest of her life. It is estimated that each queen is inseminated by 3-8 males and that the number of fathers per colony is between 1 and 5. The mated queen lands on the ground and tears off her now-unnecessary wings. Then she digs a vertical tunnel to a depth of about 30 cm. At the end of the tunnel, she excavates a small chamber. The queen then starts a fungal garden using the piece brought from her birth colony. Usually, the garden is fertilized only with feces, but sometimes it is necessary for the queen to forage a small quantity of plant material. The queen also lays a few eggs. The queen then tends to the fungal garden and the developing larvae, feeding them fungus and trophic eggs. The queen herself eats nothing during this period, sustaining herself on fat deposits and her shrinking flight muscles. After the first brood of workers is ready, they take over the running of the fledgling colony and the queen becomes strictly an egg-laying machine. This process takes 40–60 days. At first, the colony grows slowly, but after two to three years, the growth becomes faster. One possible reason for this is, before the colony is established enough to sustain any large soldier-caste workers, it is useful to remain unnoticed. Soldiers usually appear when the colony has a population of about 100,000. After the number of workers reaches 5–8 million, the colony stops expanding and diverts resources into producing queens and males. The virgin queens are very rarely successful. Assuming the number of colonies in an area remains constant over time, on average only one queen among the many thousands sent out by a colony successfully founds a new one. However, a mature colony of several million workers faces very few dangers. No known predator, except the mostly subterranean army ant Nomamyrmex esenbeckii, actively attacks the nests, and even other highly aggressive army ants show a healthy respect for an A. sexdens colony. If spared from floods and human activity, the colony is usually destroyed only when the queen dies of old age, giving a successful colony a lifespan of 10–20 years. In that time, the colony will have sent out numerous males and virgin queens to found new colonies.  Significance  Ecological impact = At the end of its lifespan, an A. sexdens colony has moved up to 40,000 kg of soil. This has two important results: The soil becomes aerated with the excavation of tunnels and chambers, and enriched with nutrients as the ants bury their waste products. This represents a major way in which nutrients are recycled in their environment. A. sexdens and other leafcutter ants are also important herbivores, consuming 12–17% of the leaf mass-produced in neotropical rainforests. One colony's consumption of plant material is comparable to that of a large mammalian herbivore, such as a cow. A. sexdens and the related species, A. cephalotes are the principal insect pests where they are found, destroying billions of dollars worth of crops with their ability to quickly defoliate and strip crops of anything useful to the ants. In fact, Atta ants are considered the primary herbivorous pest in many areas where they are found.Wilson, E., B. Holldobler. 1994. Journey to the Ants. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Kelknap Press of Harvard University Press. If A. sexdens were to spread into tropical Africa, the results are speculated to be devastating. As the local plants have not developed defensive compounds against leafcutters and Africa does not have parasites evolved to infect them, the results for both the ecosystem and agriculture would be disastrous.

In a 10-year career, spent primarily as a pitcher, King played for the Kansas City Cowboys (1886), St. Louis Browns (1887–89), Chicago Pirates (1890), Pittsburgh Pirates (1891), New York Giants (1892–93), Cincinnati Reds (1893), and Washington Senators (1896–97). The first part of King's nickname was a reference to the color of his hair, while the latter part was a translation of his German surname. King was an unusual pitcher for his time. Gripping the ball with unusually large hands, he delivered the ball without a windup. He was also one of the first pitchers in major league history to employ a sidearm delivery. The unconventional methods worked, as he went on to pitch 3,190 innings, winning 203 games with 1229 strikeouts and a 3.18 earned run average in 397 games. His strong fastball enabled him to become a notable strikeout artist; he finished among the league's top 10 in that category six times. King's best season came in 1888, when he led the Browns to their fourth consecutive American Association championship. That year, King led the league with 585 innings pitched in 66 games, 45 wins, and a 1.64 ERA. In 1890, he jumped to Chicago of the Players' League and added another ERA title while winning 30 games. On June 21, 1890, King threw a no-hitter for Chicago, the only one in the league's one-year history. (King lost 1–0, and pitched only eight innings in the loss, so this game is not officially recognized by MLB as a no-hitter.) After baseball, King returned to his native St. Louis. He died in 1938, at age 70, and was buried at New St. Marcus Cemetery in St. Louis.

The story is set in 2007, when Professor Takuma Nekasa uncovers a gene code that will unlock the human body's greatest mystery and expose mankind to its greatest threat. As a result, Gawl, Koji, and Ryo—three young scientists from a future period—have traveled back in time to undo this mistake. Though the trio intended to arrive one year before the calamity, they are instead transported three months prior to the event. In their effort to save the world, they are opposed by the mysterious and cunning Ryuko Saito, a scientist who prefers the future as it is. Saito is assisted by Generators, unearthly assassins posing as humans. As Ryo and Koji try to complete their mission, Gawl himself must \\"generate\\"—becoming like his enemies to fight on their terms. Characters ; :Nobutoshi Canna (Japanese), Vic Mignogna (English) The hero and main character of the story, Gawl is a Generator with vast power. Though he appears somewhat dim-witted, Gawl shows loyalty and protectiveness for his friends, even if it means putting his life on the line. Even when out of his Generator form Gawl is able to display superhuman feats of athletics, strength, and endurance, such as jumping several meters in the air, and surviving an otherwise crushing blow from falling construction equipment. Despite this, he appears to be very lax and lazy, as he is almost always asleep during classes and car rides, as his transformations and brawls tend to be highly taxing, thus requiring large amounts of sleep and relaxation to compensate. This also implies that he is not as dim-witted as he lets on. ; :Shin-ichiro Miki (Japanese), Jay Hickman (English) Koji is the level-headed one of the trio and a true intellectual. He rarely displays much emotion at all and only laughs one time in the series. ; :Tsutomu Kashiwakura (Japanese), Matt Kelley (English) Ryo is the more sensitive of the three, but he is also quite brilliant. He was head of Kubere's Project Achilles to create Gawl and feels intense guilt for his experiments on Gawl. ; :Satsuki Yukino (Japanese), Rozie Curtis (English) A girl who met up with the three early on in the series. Masami constantly fights with Gawl due to a poor first impression. Though this may be, it is quite obvious that she has somewhat of a romantic interest in him. ; :Konami Yoshida (Japanese), Monica Rial (English) A pink-haired girl who is extremely shy and Masami's best friend. She constantly attempts to calm Gawl and Masami down when they get in a heated conflict but never succeeds. ; :Yuriko Yamaguchi (Japanese), Kaytha Coker (English) The antagonist of the story, Saito is a mysterious scientist and time-traveler who attempts to thwart Gawl, Koji, and Ryo. She uses Dr. Tekuma Nekasa's desire to recover his past to bend him to her will. She is constantly calling Generators to do her dirty work and often tries to kill or capture Gawl and his friends. ; :Yoku Shioya (Japanese), John Swasey (English) A professor that uncovers a gene code that will unlock our body's greatest mystery and expose mankind to its greatest threat. ; :Hideyuki Hori (Japanese), Jason Douglas (English) A scientist and Ryuko Saito's assistant. Episode listGenerators ;Generator: A being with the ability to transform into a metalloid (metallic/organic) warrior with powers far beyond those of humans. There are many types of Generator, such as Gawl (\\"Razor?\\"), Cyclops, Manta, and many more. All of which have their own abilities that were either designed for weaponry or for the Reconstruction when they were \\"officially\\" introduced. There are also multiple \\"phases\\" of Generator, which refers to the power output of a Generator and the stage of development, Gawl likely being Phase 4 and Ryuko Saito being a Phase 5. There is also a \\"Control\\" level to Generators. The First level is completely based on hardwired connections; the Second and Third are semi-autonomous levels with preset commands which the subject is free to use in whatever parameters that are set. Third-level generators, however, are capable of reverting to human form. The Fourth level is where the subject is completely self-aware, capable of full physical control and is able to revert to human form, but is not capable of vocal communication; for example, in the series Gawl's generated form is unable to speak (can only grunt expressions and perhaps yell/scream). The Fifth and final level is where the generator has complete control, can fully communicate, and is capable of using its immense power in any way. ;Exogenerate: Also known in the American dub as \\"generate,\\" this is the ability to transform into Generator Form through the mental trigger of activating the transformation gene. Surprisingly, in one of the later episodes, Koji and Ryo generate; they, however, are less powerful than Gawl, being Phase 1. This is because they activated their Include Cells as they are, not like Gawl who was activated before he was born. According to Gawl after an individual's first time generating their body will undergo certain changes, although these changes are never explained in detail. ;Core: The heart of a Generator, all relays of power and life functions are processed in here. The core is crystalline in hardness and can only be destroyed by another Generator. Once it is shattered, the Generator dies and turns into either energy or dust. It is often exposed on the chest, but in certain designs, such as Sound and Cyclops, it may be hidden within the body (Sound) or exposed on the back (Cyclops). It is revealed later in the series that Natsume is working for Ryuko, and knew who and what Gawl, Koji, and Ryo were since she first saw Generator Gawl and the Sound type outside the fast-food restaurant Masami works at. She is used as a spy to track them and, in one episode, used as a human bomb. However, at this point Natsumi rebels and leaves a recorded message for the trio and Masami and goes off into the forest so that the bomb inside her body won't destroy the others. Koji and Ryo are Phase 1 Generators who aren't as powerful as Gawl. It is known that Koji, Ryo, and Gawl were grown either by in-vitro fertilization or in some form of growth tube. Either way, it is fact that their genetic mother is Natsume, as evidenced later in the series when Ryuko's assistant, who is in fact an older Koji, notices the ID numbers for eggs that Ryuko removed from Natsume shortly before the suicide mission. The ID numbers directly coincided with Gawl, Ryo and Koji's IDs back in their own time, which identify who they were cloned from. Professor Tekuma Nekasa is Ryo. At the end of the series, Gawl and the others confront Ryuko, only for her to rip out Gawl's core. As a result, two things happen. First is that Ryo and Koji are thrown backwards in time, with Ryo losing his memories of everything except the include cells that allow exogeneration. The second is Gawl speaking to an image of Natsume in his head, and using his desires to control the temporal energies and successfully stop Ryuko's plans by \\"recreating the world.\\" However, he was unable to bring Natsume back. Natsume's death drove Gawl into a blind rage, triggering a Rage form. Rage Gawl stands 3 meters tall (according to an on-scene news reporter, however he appears much larger, likely around ten to fifteen meters) and makes quick work out of all others but not without injuries, except Generator Ryuko, who makes quick work out of the now-weakened Gawl.

He is best known as the bassist in Norwegian alternative rock band Seigmen and industrial band Zeromancer. He also appeared as guest vocalist on SubGud's Time Machine.  Early career  Kim Ljung started his musical career as bass player and songsmith in the band Klisne Seigmenn in 1989. In addition to Kim, the band consisted of his kindergarten buddy Marius Roth Christensen on guitar, singer Alex Møklebust, drummer Noralf Ronthi and guitarist Sverre Økshoff. In the beginning, the band viewed it more as fun than as a serious outlet for their musical and artistic inspirations, playing a punkish style of rock but that changed rapidly.  Seigmen  In 1992, the band changed its name to Seigmen and released its first official album – the dark and unpolished Pluto – which took both the musical underground and many journalists by storm. On it they combined dark progressive rock elements with punk rock, grunge, heavy metal and perhaps a little Gothic rock. During the summer and fall, the CD was reissued in several editions to satisfy the growing number of fans. Combined with a powerful and memorable stage act, the band soon turned into a household name in the underground music scene. In the mid-1990s, with albums such as Ameneon (1993) and Total (1994), the band cemented its position as one of the most important and innovative in Norwegian music history and the number of fans swelled well beyond underground status. The apex of commercial success was reached with the album Metropolis in 1995. It made its debut, in week 44, at the number 1 spot on the VG Album Charts. Within a few days it sold to Gold (25,000 copies) and didn't stop until it had passed 50,000. This is a good figure for any artist in a small country like Norway. The second half of the decade saw the band move in a more electronic direction with Radiowaves, their last proper studio album, in 1997. In 1999, by the time their greatest hits album, Monument 1989–1999, was released, Sverre had decided to leave the band to focus on his family. An old agreement among the members was that if one of them left, they should disband Seigmen. And that is what happened after their final concert at Rockefeller concert hall in Oslo on March 6, 1999. Seigmen played live at the 2012 Slottsfjell festival in Tønsberg, which was a celebrating its 10th anniversary. In 2015 Seigmen released a new album \\"Enola\\".  Zeromancer  With the departure of Sverre the other members were free to form new constellations. Somehow, Marius got left out so he went on to take an education in classical music and has since appeared on both TV and radio as lead singer for choirs. The remaining three - Kim, Alex and Noralf - formed the industrial group Zeromancer with former Vampire State Building keyboard-player Erik Lunggren and the American Chris Schleyer. Zeromancer never managed to reach the same heights, neither with respect to musical innovation nor in popularity, as Seigmen had. But they've toured extensively both in Europe and America, and they seem to have grown fairly popular in Germany with their take on industrial metal. So far the band has released six albums, Clone Your Lover in 2000, Eurotrash in 2001, ZZYZX in 2003, Sinners International in 2009, The Death Of Romance in 2010 and Bye-Bye Borderline in 2013.  Ljungblut  Kim Ljung has also been active on his own. Over the years material that didn't fit in with Zeromancer has gathered weight until at some point in 2004 he felt compelled to collect some of the songs and release his first solo album. And due to the number of songs it turned out to be a double album! The double CD, The other side of all things, was released on Pleasuredisc Records on February 26, 2005 under the alias Ljungblut. The sound is a lot more acoustic and melancholic than what we ever heard from Seigmen, but the melodies and lyrics are strong and personal and this is certainly a contender for the title Best Norwegian Album of the Year.  The future  Ljungblut and Zeromancer are both scheduled for new releases next year. As well as a Seigmen DVD containing the reunion show, videos, interviews, and a documentary with unreleased material. Different members are actively pursuing their own side projects; Alex has been working as producer for a few Norwegian artists - such as Gåte and Don Juan Dracula, Erik has lent his keyboard and computer skills out to such various artists as the Swiss electro band Undergod and Norwegian black metal acts Satyricon. Even Seigmen may still have a future, though all the members deny it, because they agreed to do \\"one last\\" concert during the UKA-festival in Trondheim on October 20, 2005. Six years after disbanding the band they stood on stage together again, in front of an audience of more than 5000 people. After this success they went on a small tour in Norway in the summer of 2006.

Professor Cohen was a staunch opponent of the so-called Linear no-threshold model (LNT) which postulates there exists no safe threshold for radiation exposure. His view, considered in the 1980s and 1990s a self-marginalizing posture, had gained, within 20 years, support from a strong minority. He died in March 2012. No- threshold and plutonium toxicity debates Cohen claimed: \\"All estimates of the cancer risk from low level radiation are based on the linear-no threshold theory (LNT) which is based solely on largely discredited concepts of radiation carcinogenesis, with no experimental verification in the low dose region of the most important applications. These risk estimates are now leading to the expenditure of tens of billions of dollars to protect against dangers whose existence is highly questionable. It is therefore of utmost importance to test the validity of this theory.\\"Introduction, Standard Handbook of Environmental Science, Health, and Technology, J.H. Lehr (Editor), McGraw-Hill (New York); 2000, Chapter 20.2 . A conclusion, with an update to the landmark study published 1995, continues: \\"Since no other plausible explanation has been found after years of effort by myself and others, I conclude that the most plausible explanation for our discrepancy is that the linear-no threshold theory fails, grossly over-estimating the cancer risk in the low dose, low dose rate region. There are no other data capable of testing the theory in that region. An easy answer to the credibility of this conclusion would be for someone to suggest a potential not implausible explanation based on some selected variables. I (or he) will then calculate what values of those variables are required to explain our discrepancy. We can then make a judgement on the plausibility of that explanation. To show that this procedure is not unreasonable, I offer to provide a not-implausible explanation for any finding of any other published ecological study. This alone demonstrates that our work is very different from any other ecological study, and therefore deserves separate consideration.\\"Conclusion, Standard Handbook of Environmental Science, Health, and Technology, Lehr, . Cohen's debates in academic periodicals and published correspondence with R. William Field, Brian J. Smith (assistant professor of biostatistics, University of Iowa), Jerry Puskin (from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency), Sarah Darby, and Sir Richard Doll and others regarding his radon-related ecologic studies are well known.Cohen's fallacy University of Iowa published correspondence.

Among other expert panels, the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer discussed at length Cohen's results then concluded: \\"The weight of evidence is that the ecological analyses of Cohen can be rejected.\\" In March, 2011, Professor Cohen stated, reflecting on his study and its controversial results, that low levels of radiation can have beneficial health effects and reduce the risks of cancer, \\"There is evidence on both sides. Whether low-level radiation is protective against cancer, a theory called radiation hormesis, is debated in the scientific community. Furthermore, ...[on his viewpoint, and its support found in his exhaustive studies] it could go further and say that no confounding factors (like socio-economic, geography, ethnicity, medical care access, and beyond 500 explored in the analysis) can explain the results. However, my study was designed to test the assumption that the danger of radiation is simply proportional to the radiation dose, which is the only evidence that low-level radiation may be harmful. My conclusion was that that assumption is false.\\"'Claim of radiation benefits barely passes X-ray test for truth', referring to comments made by commentator Ann Coulter; March 23, 2011; The Oregonian (daily)p.A2;Portland, Oregon; email reply by B.L.

A testimony to his conviction on the human safety of background low-level radiation was his offering rewards of up to $10,000 if people provided evidence that the inverse association he found between radon (county averages) and lung cancer (county averages) was due to some factor other than failure of the linear-no threshold theory. Puskin, Smith, Field and others have claimed that his findings are due in part to his inability to control for the inverse association between smoking and radon.Puskin, JL.

Nader did not accept the challenge. Publications Professor Cohen has written six books, including Heart of the Atom (1967) with translations in French, German, Italian, and Japanese, Concepts of Nuclear Physics (1970) with translation in Arabic, Nuclear Science and Society (1974), Before It's Too Late: A Scientist's Case for Nuclear Power (1983), and The Nuclear Energy Option, Alternative for the Nineties, (1990) in translation for Japanese and Spanish. He has written about 135 research papers on basic nuclear physics, about 300 scientific papers on energy and environment (e.g. nuclear power, health effects of radiation, radioactive waste, risks in our society), and about 80 articles in popular magazines such as Physics and Society, National Review, Oui, Science Digest, Catholic Digest, and Scientific American. He has authored scientific studies and editorial contributions on a vast array of subjects in nuclear industry trade journals such as Public Utilities Fortnightly, Reviews of Modern Physics, Nuclear Engineering International, and American Journal of Physics. Awards and honors Dr. Cohen received in 1981 the Tom W. Bonner Prize in Nuclear Physics from the American Physical Society. He was also elected Chairman of the American Physical Society, Division of Nuclear Physics (1974–75). Dr. Cohen received the 1992 Distinguished Scientific Achievement Award from the Health Physics Society, and the 1996 Walter H. Zinn Award from the American Nuclear Society (ANS), for his \\"notable and sustained contribution to the nuclear power industry that has not been widely recognized.\\" The ANS also granted Cohen its 1985 \\"Public Information Award\\", and its 1996 \\"Special Award\\", for his \\"meritorious contributions in research\\" on Linear Dose Model [Versus] Other Models for Critical Dose Values. He was elected to member of the National Academy of Engineering in 2003, \\"for fundamental contributions to our understanding of low-level radiation\\" and Chairman of the American Nuclear Society Division of Environmental Sciences (1980–81).

It is split between the Arboretum and Normanton electoral wards. Neighbouring areas include Litchurch, Normanton and Osmaston. The area became urbanised in the late 19th century and is characterised by terraced housing originally built for industrial workers.  History  The suburb derives its name from Pear Tree Farm which formerly existed in the area, and was owned by the Peach family from the 18th century. Much of the farmland was sold off for development in the 1860s and 1870s, and the farmhouse demolished. Streets of terraced housing were built up to accommodate workers, industry having been encouraged to develop by the opening of the Birmingham and Derby Junction Railway, which skirts the eastern side of Pear Tree, in 1839. Local businessman Francis Ley opened his Vulcan Iron Works on a site next to the railway line in 1874. It expanded massively in subsequent decades and was a major employer in the area until it was closed and demolished in 1986. Although the demise of Ley's has allowed for some modern redevelopment, much of the original terraced housing typical of the area is of a good quality and has survived. Like neighbouring Normanton, Pear Tree now has a large multicultural community, with a particularly high number of residents of Asian origin. Government Pear Tree has no formally defined boundaries. The area is split between the Arboretum and Normanton wards, two of the seventeen electoral wards which make up Derby. Each ward elects three councillors to Derby City Council. As of the 2015 local elections, all three councillors for both wards represent the Labour Party. In the 19th century, much of Pear Tree was part of the township and civil parish of Litchurch, which existed independently of Derby between 1860 and 1888 before being integrated into the newly created civil parish and county borough of Derby. In the Parliament of the United Kingdom, Arboretum and Normanton are two of the wards that make up the constituency of Derby South. Geography Pear Tree is an inner city suburb located about south of Derby city centre and about south-west of the River Derwent. The area is approximately above sea level.  Landmarks  Until 1997, Pear Tree's most famous landmark was the Baseball Ground, home of Derby's professional football club, Derby County F.C., for most of the twentieth century. However, the stadium was demolished in 2004 having been largely unused since the club's departure to Pride Park some seven years earlier. The site is now being developed to provide private housing and some social with landscaped grounds and a memorial to the site's historic past.  Famous residents  Peace activist Alice Wheeldon lived on Pear Tree Road, where her family home sheltered conscientious objectors avoiding conscription during the First World War. She was convicted of plotting to assassinate Prime Minister David Lloyd George. Steve Bloomer was a footballer for Derby County, Midlesbrough and England. Born in Cradley, Worcestershire, he moved to Derby as a child, living at a number of addresses in Pear Tree and Normanton and attending the Pear Tree and St James' Road schools. The Bloomer family lived at 35 Portland Street in Pear Tree towards the end of his playing days. Another footballer was Jack Bowers, who played for Derby County between 1928 and 1936 and during this time appeared three times for England. He lived on Pear Tree Road with his wife (born Edith Mason) where they kept a china shop. Where their home was is now a park. They had two children, John and Susan. The son, John, also played for Derby County. http://www.dcfc.co.uk/page/125News/0,,10270~1597537,00.html) Transport View towards Peartree railway station The main railway line from Derby to Birmingham, part of the Cross Country Route, forms the eastern boundary of the area. Peartree railway station, located to the south-east of Pear Tree on Osmaston Park Road, is located on the line but is only served by a limited number of stopping trains on the Crewe to Derby route. The station, which originally opened in 1839, is managed by East Midlands Railway. North of Peartree on the line is Ramsline Halt, which was briefly used in the 1990s for Football Specials serving the Baseball Ground but is now disused.

Most such calls are generated by a cold call telemarketing operation's predictive dialer which makes many calls, and sometimes does not have an agent immediately available to handle an answered call; the called party hears silence (\\"dead air\\"), followed by the call being disconnected. This differs from a ghost call, which is not dialled intentionally, and is due to technical issues or pocket dialling. In the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) uses the term \\"abandoned call\\" instead of silent call in its regulations applying to telemarketing. \\"Abandoned call\\" in non-FTC contexts may refer to a caller who hangs up when the call is not answered promptly. For more information on why the technology makes silent calls, see predictive dialer. Other reasons for silent calls People using telecommunications devices for the deaf (TDDs) and calling public agencies might expect the agency being called to answer with a TTY. The caller waits for \\"TTY tones\\" to be generated over the phone line. The answerer should place the phone receiver into the TTY coupler and type anything (\\"Hello, Go Ahead\\") so the caller knows it is connected. It is inappropriate for public agencies that have a TTY to hang up on a silent call. Many silent calls are a result of process known as pinging. This is very similar to an Internet Protocol (IP) ping, where the intention is to see if there is life at the destination. This is often used by data cleaning companies as a method of removing dead telephone numbers from old lists. Each number is dialed and immediately dropped if the call appears to be going through; if it is not dropped quickly enough, it may make the telephone ring briefly. Telemarketing and the UK DMA It is believed that most, although not all, silent calls are made by telemarketing agencies. Around 10% of dialler users in the UK are members of the Direct Marketing Association (DMA) which is an industry interest group for telemarketing in the UK. The DMA code of conduct rules that no more than 5% of the calls made per day should be silent. Many consumer groups consider this too high, and initially campaigned for this to be lowered to 3%. The legal position in the UK There is no law that declares silent calls illegal, although the Communications Act 2003OPSI.gov.uk states: > \\"127.2 A person is guilty of an offence if, for the purpose of causing > annoyance, inconvenience or needless anxiety to another, he- .../cut/... (c) > persistently makes use of a public electronic communications network.\\" In 2003, OFCOM investigated two separate companies who were believed to be making silent calls. They were investigated under this section of the legislation because it was believed that they were \\"causing annoyance, inconvenience or needless anxiety\\". Unofficial warnings were issued, but OFCOM did not use powers given to it under the act until 3 May 2005, when it issued a \\"notification\\" (an official written warning) to one of the companies. The terms of the notification imposed a maximum proportion of 5% silent calls. On 1 March 2006, OFCOM published their revised policyOFCOM.org.uk requiring that * Abandoned calls must carry a recorded message about the company calling. * Calling line identification must be presented on all outbound calls from call centres using automated calling systems. * Telephone calls abandoned should not be re-dialled for at least 72 hours, unless a dedicated person is available. * Abandoned call rates must be less than 3% in any 24-hour period. * Suitable records must be kept. OFCOM also announced that it had completed an investigation into seven companies in relation to silent calls. Notifications were issued to four of these, imposing a new limit of 3% abandoned calls. An undertaking (without official notification) was secured from another company for the same performance. The sixth company's actions did not constitute persistent misuse. The final company has stopped accepting contracts to send unsolicited fax communications. On 3 November 2006, Ofcom published a statement indicating that it was taking action against 4 companies. * Carphone Warehouse plc; * Brakenbay Kitchens Ltd; * Space Kitchens Ltd; and * IDT Direct Ltd (trading as Toucan). The full notification is at \`OFCOM.org.uk\`.OFCOM.org.uk In 2008, Barclaycard was fined the maximum penalty at the time of £50,000. A government consultation was started with a view to increasing the maximum penalty, with suggestions from £250,000 to £2,000,000. On 1 February 2011, new legislation came into force, with a maximum penalty of £2,000,000 for companies that issue silent calls more than once a day to the same customer. Unfortunately, a large proportion of nuisance telemarketing calls to the UK originate outside the UK, so are not subject to OFCOM regulation. The No Agent Available (NAA) message One solution to silent calls is for marketing organizations to play a recorded message to the consumer explaining why the call was silent and why no agent was available. The industry, led by the DMA, resisted this for a long time because it was assumed that it would be termed illegal under article 19 of the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 (PERC): > \\"Use of automated calling systems 19\\\\. - (1) A person shall neither > transmit, nor instigate the transmission of, communications comprising > recorded matter for direct marketing purposes by means of an automated > calling system except in the circumstances referred to in paragraph (2).\\" (Further guidanceInformationcommissioner.gov.uk on the PERC 2003) However, after extensive campaigning from a consumer called David HicksonUsers.waitrose.com the industry reviewed its position and started to further investigate the matter. A private consulting firm contacted the information commissioner on 13 July 2005 and got confirmation that a NAA message is acceptable,Darrylbeckford.co.uk on the condition that the message itself does not contain any marketing information. On 25 July 2005, this consulting firm then released a framework to help call centres implement the NAA message, entitled Voluntary Dialing Code.Darrylbeckford.co.uk However, many believed that even if an NAA message was legal in terms of the PERC, OFCOM could still find that it was persistent misuse. On 17 August 2005, MP John Hemming received confirmation from OFCOM that usage of the NAA message would not be termed a persistent misuse, and there was no widespread belief that OFCOM would conclude that the six companies it was investigating should stop making silent calls and use the information message instead. OFCOM did not indicate what quantity of NAA is acceptable. On 18 August 2005, the DMA pledged to update its code.

It was formed at the 2015 local government reform by the merger of the former municipalities Kozare, Kuçovë, Lumas and Perondi, that became municipal units. The seat of the municipality is the town Kuçovë.Law nr. 115/2014 The total population is 31,262 (2011 census), in a total area of 160.33 km2. The population of the former municipality at the 2011 census was 12,654. History F6 Fighter jets in Kucove =Ancient = Archaeologists found in the village of Katundas near Kuçovë six phases of inhabitation dating to the Neolithic, Chalcolithic, Bronze Age, Iron Age, urban Illyrian and the Late Antiquity era. = Modern = Kuçova has been an industrial city since the Italian influence in the early 1920s. In 1928 in “Dikater” was drilled the first oil hole in Albania. From this moment onwards the city has been on oil drilling maps. Since 1928, the Italian company AIPA had an agreement with the Zog I government that if the oil extraction would surpass 50,000 tonnes per year, this company would build a refinery in Albania. In 1939 Albania was occupied by Italians and therefore, though the oil extracted was more than 170,000 ton, the refinery was never built and the oil was transported to Italy. =Qyteti Stalin= During Communist Albania the city was renamed to Stalin City () and was a closed military district. The city was extensively developed in the 1950s and is of interest to students of communist architecture, although following the collapse of communism there has been much unauthorised building and modification to the original buildings. It is home to one airbase of the Albanian Air Force, although since 2005 the country's air force has ceased flying the aged MiG fighters provided by the Soviet Union and China and has been reduced to rotary wing aircraft only. Economy Kuçova is one of Albania's cities known for its oil industry along with Patos and Ballsh. The Oil industry was originally developed by the Italians during the King Zog period, and much of the infrastructure is dated. Following the end of the communist period the town suffered a severe industrial decline, with the closure of many factories and the destruction of the towns power plan in the riots following the failure of the pyramid banks. Today there is some evidence of a recovery with a large number of micro-businesses operating from former state run factories, although unemployment remains high. There are also a number of foreign owned banks and a small number of ATMs. Like many towns in Albania many young people leave for Italy and Greece. Population Currently the Kuçova district has a population of around 50,000. Of this population around 31,000 live in the city of Kuçova, classifying it as 12th of 65 municipalities on a national scale. Population density is 567 inhabitants/km2, which ranks the Kuçova district as the most heavily populated on a national scale. Another feature of this district compared with others in Albania is that city dwellers comprise 63% of the general population, the remainder living in villages nearby. The city of Kuçova has 5 neighborhoods (), Lgj. \\"11 Janari\\", Lgj. \\"Llukan Prifti\\", Lgj.\\"11 Shkurti\\", Lgj. \\"Tafil Skendo\\", and \\"1 Maji\\". One of the largest parks in Kuçovë is called \\"Pishat\\" (The Pines). Like many other Albanian cities, Kuçova has a lot of coffee bars, restaurants and some hotels. Education There are two public high schools in the city, General High School (Shkolla e Mesme e Pergjithshme) \\"Myrteza Kepi\\" and General High School Kuçove (Shkolla e Mesme e Pergjithshme Kucove) and one non public high school. There are also five 1st to 9th grade schools; \\"18 Tetori\\", \\"28 Nentori\\", \\"Gaqi Karakashi\\", \\"23 Nentori\\" and \\"Deshmoret e Kombit\\". High school graduates who want to pursue a higher education go to other Albanian cities or outside the country. Sports The football club is KF Naftëtari Kuçovë.

Byrne's exact height is of some conjecture. Some accounts refer to him as being to tall, but skeletal evidence places him at just over . Biography Byrne's family lived in a remote part of County Londonderry called Littlebridge, not far from the shores of Lough Neagh. It is said that Byrne had been conceived on top of a haystack, and that this was the cause of his great height. Little is known of Byrne's family other than that his parents were ordinary people, and that they were not unusually tall. By his late teens Byrne had decided to set off for Britain in pursuit of fame and fortune. Landing first in Scotland, he became an instant success. As Eric Cubbage has recounted, Edinburgh's \\"night watchmen were amazed at the sight of him lighting his pipe from one of the streetlamps on North Bridge without even standing on tiptoe.\\"Muinzer, Thomas: \\"The Giant\\", Freckle Magazine, Issue 1, Winter 2015 His celebrity spread as he made his way down northern England, arriving in London in early 1782, aged 21. Here he entertained paying audiences at rooms in Spring Garden-gate, then Piccadilly, and lastly Charing Cross. He was the toast of the town; a 6 May 1782 newspaper report bears out: \\"However striking a curiosity may be, there is generally some difficulty in engaging the attention of the public; but even this was not the case with the modern living Colossus, or wonderful Irish Giant.\\" His gentle, likeable nature inspired an immense public fondness, and his celebrity life was constantly splashed across the newspapers of the day. \\"The wonderful Irish Giant...is the most extraordinary curiosity ever known, or ever heard of in history; and the curious in all countries where he has been shewn, pronounce him to be the finest display of Human nature they ever saw\\".Morning Herald Newspaper, London, 17 July 1782 By mid-1782 he had inspired a hit London stage show called Harlequin Teague, or the Giant's Causeway. Byrne's great height was the result of a then-undiscovered growth disorder (known today as acromegaly or acromegalic gigantism), and his health declined sharply in his twenty-second year. He was also pickpocketed in this period while drinking in his local pub, the Black Horse; Byrne's worldly earnings were on his person in the form of banknotes, and were stolen. The loss of his earnings interacted with his failing health, and two months later Byrne died, at his lodgings, in June 1783, aged 22. After death The skeleton of Charles Byrne Byrne was living in London at the same time as the pre-eminent surgeon and anatomist John Hunter. Hunter had a reputation for collecting unusual specimens for his private museum, and Hunter had offered to pay Byrne for his corpse. As Byrne's health deteriorated, and knowing that Hunter wanted his body for dissection (a fate reserved at that time for executed criminals) and probable display, Byrne devised a plan. He made express arrangements with friends that when he died his body would be sealed in a lead coffin and taken to the coastal town of Margate and then to a ship for burial at sea. Byrne's wishes were thwarted and his worst fears realised when Hunter arranged for the cadaver to be snatched on its way to Margate.https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/why-skeleton- irish-giant-could-be-buried-sea-180969443/, Why the Skeleton of the “Irish Giant” Could Be Buried at Sea Hunter then reduced Byrne's corpse to its skeleton and four years later put Byrne's skeleton on display in his Hunterian Museum. His 2.31-m (7 ft 7 in) skeleton was purchased in 1799 by the Hunterian Museum at the Royal College of Surgeons in London and it was then displayed for nearly two centuries.https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/why- skeleton-irish-giant-could-be-buried-sea-180969443/, Why the Skeleton of the “Irish Giant” Could Be Buried at Sea In 2011 calls were made in the British Medical Journal by Len Doyal, Emeritus Professor of Medical Ethics at Queen Mary, University of London, and law lecturer Thomas Muinzer to put an end to the unethical display of Byrne's skeleton at the museum and for it to be buried at sea \\"as Byrne intended for himself\\". The article argued that Byrne's DNA had been taken and could be used in further research, but that it was now time to respect Byrne's burial wishes and attempt to morally rectify what happened. A public poll conducted on the BMJ's website over December 2011—January 2012 in response to the article \\"Should the Skeleton of 'the Irish Giant' Be Buried at Sea?\\" by Doyal and Muinzer offered people the chance to vote on what they thought should happen to Byrne's remains. Doyal and Muinzer reported: \\"On the last count that we saw before voting ceased, 55.6% (310) voted for burial at sea; 13.17% (74) for removal from display and being kept for research; and 31.55% (176) for the status quo.\\" The BMJ article was widely reported and the resulting swell of public support for the campaign forced The Royal College of Surgeons to formally consider whether it should release Byrne's skeleton, the showpiece of their Hunterian museum, in February 2012. They decided to continue the exhibit.Royal College of Surgeons reject call to bury skeleton of Irish giant. The Guardian, 22 December 2011 Since then, a further academic article has been published in the International Journal of Culture and Property Law which deals with the legal issues raised by the display of Byrne's skeleton and contains new fieldwork carried out in Byrne's native townland of Littlebridge. The article again calls for the release of Byrne's skeleton from his captor's museum on moral grounds and for a burial to be carried out in Byrne's homeland at, or as near as possible to, the Giant's Grave, a local site where folk tradition suggests Byrne wished to be buried. The article explains that as the legal system stands, people have no legal power to direct what will happen to their remains following death, and so rely on their loved ones to carry out their burial wishes so that they are buried with respect and dignity. In May 2015, the then Mayor of Derry Martin Reilly wrote to the Museum's trustees advocating for \\"the importance of respecting the wishes of Mr Byrne in relation to his burial\\". In March 2017, Dr. Thomas Muinzer appeared in an interview on the NPR program All Things Considered for a piece entitled \\"The saga of the Irish Giant's Bones dismays Medical Ethicists.\\" A Change.org petition started by Richard Mckee of Oregon in the United States to honour the dying wishes of Charles Byrne to be buried at sea has so far garnered 456 signatures. On 6 June 2018, speaking on behalf of the campaign, Dr Thomas Muinzer published an article in The Conversation entitled \\"Why a London museum should return the stolen bones of an Irish giant\\" as a result of recent developments with the case. Following renewed pressure from campaigners, The Guardian reported in an article entitled \\"'Irish giant' may finally get respectful burial after 200 years on display\\" that the Trustees of the Hunterian Museum have confirmed that they will consider whether to release the skeleton of Charles Byrne for burial; a spokesperson for the Royal College of Surgeons said “The Hunterian Museum will be closed [from late 2016] until 2021 and Charles Byrne’s skeleton is not currently on display. The board of trustees of the Hunterian collection will be discussing the matter during the period of closure of the museum.” Carla Valentine, technical curator of the Pathology Museum at Queen Mary University, London has said: “Now that it’s out there that they’re considering this, I think it will be difficult to go back from that.” Medical condition The American surgeon Harvey Cushing studied Byrne's bones in 1909 and found that Byrne had had a pituitary tumour based on an enlarged pituitary fossa. In 2011, British and German researchers determined the cause of Byrne's gigantism. They extracted DNA from Byrne's teeth and found that he had a rare mutation in his AIP gene that is involved in pituitary tumours. The researchers also found that four contemporary families living in Northern Ireland which have a history of related pituitary disorders also carried this mutation. The researchers inferred that Byrne and these families had a common ancestor about 57 to 66 generations ago (1425 to 1650 years ago). Legacy Author Hilary Mantel wrote a fictionalised novel of his life in The Giant, O'Brien. The plot of the novel focused on the battle between the revolution of science and the ways of poem and song. O'Brien (Byrne) was portrayed as a man whose faith was in tales of kings and the little people, while his polar opposite John Hunter was portrayed as at the dawn of the scientific age, destroying all that is old and cherished. It also mentions that O'Brien (Byrne) was related to another Irish giant in Patrick Cotter O'Brien of Cork, who exhibited himself shortly after the death of Byrne, stating that he was 8'7\\" in height. An exhumation of his bones in 1972 showed that his true height was 8'1\\". The book also mentions a sort of kinship with two other Irish giants known simply as 'The Brothers Knipe' who both stood 7'2\\" each. They were recognised by the Guinness Book of World Records as the tallest identical twins in history. In 2010, poet Moyra Donaldson from Northern Ireland published the anthology Miracle Fruit which featured a poem inspired by Charles Byrne called 'The Skeleton of the Great Irish Giant'. Author Tessa Harris also made him one of the main characters in her novel The Dead Shall Not Rest, which examines the beginnings of forensic science, anatomy and surgery. The book, which is well referenced, emphasises the difficulties that anatomists of the time had in gaining access to bodies to dissect, and the resulting illegal trade in dead bodies.https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-7582-6699-6, The Dead Shall Not Rest: A Dr. Thomas Silkstone Mystery He is mentioned in chapter 32 of Charles Dickens' novel David Copperfield, to illustrate the enormousness of an umbrella: \\"But her face, as she turned it up to mine, was so earnest; and when I relieved her of the umbrella (which would have been an inconvenient one for the Irish Giant), she wrung her little hands in such an afflicted manner; that I rather inclined towards her.\\" Irish Songwriter Seamus Fogarty wrote a song about Charles Bryne - A Short Ballad for a Long Man References Category:People with gigantism Category:People from County Londonderry Category:1761 births Category:1783 deaths Category:Sideshow performers Category:Irish entertainers ","title":"Charles Byrne (giant)"},{"id":"2482836","text":"Argiope spider sitting on the stabilimentum at the center of the web. A web decoration or stabilimentum (plural: stabilimenta) is a conspicuous silk structure included in the webs of some species of orb-web spider. Its function is a subject of debate. Origin It is likely that the use of stabilimenta evolved independently at least nine different times. Araneus and Gasteracantha make silk stabilimenta, while Cyclosa and the closely related Allocyclosa bifurca make stabilimenta of silk, detritus, and their egg sacs. All those evolved independently from those of Argiope, although some decorations of Allocyclosa bifurca closely resemble those of Argiope.Eberhard 2006 Form Although web decorations are common in a number of spider species in the families Araneidae, Tetragnathidae and Uloboridae, they are probably best known from spiders of the genus Argiope. This genus includes a number of species known as the Saint Andrew's Cross spiders, so named for their habit of resting in their webs with their legs outstretched in the shape of an X, the traditional shape of the cross of Saint Andrew. Spiders in this genus also construct web decorations as a vertical line, and juveniles commonly construct disc-shaped decorations.Bruce & Herberstein 2005 Other spiders construct round structures covering the entire hub of the web. Azilia vachoni construct conspicuous stabilimenta with attached detritus such as egg sacs and insect carcasses (mostly their prey), and also hang debris such as dried leaves from their webs.

Function There is much controversy surrounding the function of these structures, and it is likely that different species use them for different purposes. Originally the decorations were thought to stabilize the web (hence the term stabilimentum),Robinson & Robinson 1970 though this hypothesis has since been dismissed because it was found that the decoration is only loosely attached to the web so that the actual influence on the stability could be minor.Stark 2002 Notable is the fact that stabilimentum-building spiders are largely diurnal. It has been suggested that stabilimenta could provide protection to the spider by either camouflaging it (by breaking up its outline), or making it appear larger (by extending its outline).Schoener & Spiller 1999 Another hypothesis is that they make the web visible and therefore animals such as birds are less likely to damage the spider's web.Herberstein et al. 2000; Bruce 2006; Eisner & Nowicki 1983 More recent work (2016) has leaned toward this latter hypothesis, further finding that food capture was reduced by their presence. The authors note that regardless of function, there is a high cost to building a stabilimentum, and therefore the benefit must be equally large. The other dominating hypothesis is that web decorations attract prey by reflecting ultraviolet light.Craig & Bernard 1990 Light in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum is known to be attractive to many species of insects. Another hypothesis is that the purpose of the stabilimentum is to attract the male of the species to the web when the female is ready to reproduce. A limited study carried out in the Calahonda area of Spain in the summer of 1992 showed that there was a positive correlation between the presence of a male in the webs of Argiope lobata and the presence of a stabilimentum.Tickner 1992 (unpublished) Many other hypotheses have also been proposed, such as thermoregulation,Humphreys 1992 stress, or regulation of excess silk.Tso 2004 At least one species has been observed to vibrate the web, while positioned in the stabilimentum, when approached by a body the size of a human. While many Uloborus species construct stabilimenta, Uloborus gibbosus does not; it usually rests at an edge of its orb and drops to the ground if disturbed. This is thought to support the web camouflage hypothesis. In contrast, the strongly UV-reflecting stabilimentum of the uloborid Octonoba sybotides was found to be attractive to Drosophila flies. Several evolutionary models were proposed for the inconsistency in function across species. StarkStark (2002) argued that although these hypotheses seemingly conflict, they might not be mutually exclusive, and suggested that we could take a hierarchical approach to model this problem: the predominant factor leading to stabilimentum production (i.e., the main function of the decoration) in each population might be different depending on the prey-and-predating context of that population. For example, in an environment where the food is abundant but predation pressure is high, the food resources are less important than prey avoidance. Therefore, it might appear that the stabilimentum has little to no effect on attracting prey but functions well as a distraction of predators. WalterWalter (2018) offered a similar but more specific solution. He stated that the function of stabilimenta might not even be pattern or species specific. Instead, he hypothesized that the visual signaling effect of stabilimenta might be derived from some non-signaling trait that is connected to other aspects of web- building behavior, such as silk disposition; this behavior was then selected preferentially to the specific ecological environment, and therefore would be displayed through different patterns and functions among various habitats. Materials While the most conspicuous and well-studied decorations are constructed entirely of silk (for example in Argiope), some spiders combine silk with other items such as egg sacs and debris (for example in Cyclosa). It seems likely that these decorations camouflage the spider, thus providing protection against predators.Eberhard 2003 Something different occurs in some species of the golden orb spiders in the genus Nephila. These spiders commonly attach lines of uneaten prey items to their webs. Recent studies have shown that these items help the spider to attract more prey.Bjorkman-Chiswell et al. 2004 In popular culture It is claimed that E. B.

George Augustus Polgreen Bridgetower (11 October 1778 - 29 February 1860) was an Afro-European musician. He was a virtuoso violinist, who lived in England for much of his life. His playing impressed Beethoven, who made Bridgetower the original dedicatee of his Kreutzer Sonata after they presented its premiere performance. Early career George Augustus Polgreen Bridgetower was born on 11 October 1778, in Biała Podlaska, Poland,George Grove and Simon McVeigh. \\"Bridgetower, George Polgreen.\\" In Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online where his father worked for Prince Hieronim Wincenty Radziwiłł. He was baptised Hieronimo Hyppolito de Augusto on 11 October 1778. His father, John Frederick Bridgetower, was probably a West Indian (possibly from Barbados), although he also claimed to be an African prince, as stated in George's baptismal record. From 1779 John Frederick was a servant of the Hungarian Prince Esterházy, thé patron of Joseph Haydn. George’s mother was from Germany, and was probably a domestic worker in the household of Sophie von Thurn und Taxis, who married Prince Hieronim Wincenty Radziwiłł in 1775. George moved to London at an early age and was performing as a violin soloist at the Drury Lane Theatre by the age of ten.London Docklands Museum, artefact notes He exhibited considerable talent while still a child and gave successful violin concerts in Paris, London, Bath and Bristol in 1789. In 1791, the British Prince Regent, the future King George IV, took an interest in him and oversaw his musical education. At the Prince's direction, he studied under François-Hippolyte Barthélémon, the leader of the Royal Opera, with Croatian-Italian composer Giovanni Giornovichi, and with Thomas Attwood, organist at St Paul's Cathedral and professor at the Royal Academy of Music. Bridgetower performed in around 50 concerts in London theatres, including Covent Garden, Drury Lane and the Haymarket Theatre, between 1789 and 1799, and he was employed by the Prince to perform in his orchestra in Brighton and London. In the spring of 1789, Bridgetower performed to great acclaim at the Abbaye de Panthemont in Paris, with Thomas Jefferson and his family in attendance. Relations with Beethoven He was given leave to visit his mother and brother, Friedrich Joseph Bridgetower, (a cellist) in Dresden, in 1802 and he gave concerts there as well. He visited Vienna later in 1803, where he performed with Ludwig van Beethoven. Beethoven was impressed with his talent and dedicated his Violin Sonata No. 9 in A major (Op.47) to Bridgetower, with the jocular dedication \\"\\" (\\"Mulatto sonata composed for the mulatto Bridgetower, great lunatic and mulatto composer\\"). Though Beethoven had barely completed the composition, the piece received its first public performance at a concert in the Augarten on 24 May 1803, with Beethoven on pianoforte and Bridgetower on violin. Bridgetower had to read the violin part of the second movement from Beethoven's copy, over his shoulder. He made a slight amendment to his part, which Beethoven gratefully accepted, jumping up to say \\"\\" (\\"Once more, my dear fellow!\\"). Beethoven also presented Bridgetower with his tuning fork, now held by the British Library. The pair fell out soon afterwards, after Bridgetower insulted a woman who turned out to be Beethoven's friend; Beethoven broke off all relations with Bridgetower and changed the dedication of the new violin sonata to the violin virtuoso Rudolphe Kreutzer, who never played it, saying that it had already been performed once and was too difficult. The piece is now known as the Kreutzer Sonata. Return to England Bridgetower returned to England, where he married Mary Leech Leeke in 1816 and continued his musical career, teaching and performing. He was elected to the Royal Society of Musicians on 4 October 1807, and attended Trinity Hall, Cambridge where he earned the degree of Bachelor of Music in June 1811. He performed in the Philharmonic Society (later to become the Royal Philharmonic Society) of London's first season in 1813, leading the performance of Beethoven's Quintet. He later travelled abroad, particularly to Italy, where his daughter lived. He died in Peckham in south London, leaving his estate of £1,000 to his deceased wife's sister. The house was demolished in 1970. He is buried in Kensal Green Cemetery. Trivia Bridgetower's great-great-nephew, John Frederick Wood (1879-1955), founded the first purpose-built cinema in Liverpool, the Bedford Hall, in 1908.The Bioscope, 3 October 1928, p27 One of Wood's companies was known as Bridgetower Cinema Supplies Ltd. Wood was the great-grandson of Friedrich Joseph Bridgetower (1782-1813), George Bridgetower's younger brother.The Bioscope, 27 January 1916, p55 Compositions Bridgetower's own compositions include Diatonica armonica for piano (London, 1812) and Henry: A ballad for medium voice and piano (London). A list of his compositions may be found in Black Music Research Journal, Vol. 10, No. 2, Fall 1990, in an article by Dominique-Rene de Lerma. Legacy Bridgetower appears as a character in the 1994 film Immortal Beloved, where he is shown playing the Kreutzer Sonata while Beethoven watches. The character of Bridgetower, played by Black violinist Everton Nelson, was described in the film as being of African heritage. In the British film A Mulatto Song (1996), directed by Topher Campbell, Colin McFarlane was cast as Frederick DeAugust (Bridgetower’s father), Cole Mejias as the young Bridgetower, and Everton Nelson as the adult Bridgetower. A book, Sonata Mulattica by Rita Dove, the Pulitzer Prize-winning former United States poet laureate, was published in 2009. A short animation, Bridgetower, directed by Jason Young, features Chris Rochester as George Bridgetower and Stefano Leonardi as Beethoven.

Service historySpanish–American War, 1898–1899= After acceptance trials on 7–25 July 1898 off Delaware Bay, Princeton got underway for Key West where she joined the North Atlantic Fleet on 27 July at the beginning of the Spanish–American War. She was immediately sent (on 2 August) to patrol the area from the northern tip of the Yucatán Peninsula to Livingston, Guatemala. After completing this mission on 13 August, she returned to Key West and the Dry Tortugas and remained on this station until departing on 11 January 1899 for New York City. =Asiatic Fleet, 1899–1903= Princeton sailed for the Pacific in early 1899 She passed through the Straits of Gibraltar on 2 February and the Suez Canal from 13–17 February, joining the Asiatic Fleet on 16 April at Cavite, Philippines. Princeton cruised throughout the Philippines from 4–15 May with the gunboat , distributing the proclamation of peace with Spain. Later, she carried Senator Albert J. Beveridge on a tour of the newly acquired Philippine Territory. USS Princeton in Manila Bay, about 1903 In late May, Princeton commenced blockading the Lingayen Gulf ports of St. Vincent and Musa and extended the blockade to the entire Gulf from 18–26 June. During the various local disturbances on Luzon, she landed troops at San Fabian on 2–7 November, transported cavalrymen from Vigan to Lingayen, conveyed dispatches, received surrendered arms and carried stores to the Marines at Subic Bay. She met the expedition led by Col. Luther Hare and Col. Robert Howze on 2 Jan. 1900 at Abulug, which rescued American prisoners, including Lt. Gillmore's men from the Siege of Baler.Westfall, M., 2012, The Devil's Causeway, Guilford: Lyons Press, Princeton took formal possession of the Babuyan and the Batan Islands on 10–13 January 1900 and continued to patrol off Luzon on 10 February. Princeton was later station ship at Iloilo and Cebu from 5 March until 21 June. At the time of the Boxer Rebellion, Princeton cruised in Chinese waters (26 June–29 November) between Hong Kong and Woosung where she received a draft of men from the auxiliary cruiser on 9 August. She returned on 4 December to operations in the Philippine-American War, principally in the Sulu Archipelago, and remained on duty there until 20 July 1902. Princeton was stationed at Cavite beginning 23 July and called at Uraga, Japan (9 October–18 December).

Afterwards, Princeton acted as a survey ship (13 February–5 April) at Malabug Bay, Zamboanga and Dumanquilas Bay until she departed on 13 April for California. Princeton decommissioned on 12 June 1903 at Mare Island Navy Yard. =Pacific Squadron, 1905–1907= Princeton recommissioned on 12 May 1905 at Mare Island Navy Yard and was attached to the Pacific Squadron. She left on 4 June for duty as station ship at Panama City, where she remained until 24 October. On 2 December 1905, Princeton returned to Mare Island Navy Yard and began cruising off the Pacific coast from San Diego, California to Esquimalt, British Columbia. She escorted Rear Admiral C. J. Train's remains from Vancouver to Seattle (22–24 August), assisted the protected cruiser (6–9 December) which was aground off Bellingham, Washington, and accompanied the armored cruiser on her sea trials off Washington from 10–22 September. On 7 November, 1906 she was in a minor collision when struck by , under tow by the tugs and , receiving minor damage at Port Townsend, Washington. Princeton remained on station off the West coast until directed to rejoin the Pacific Squadron on 3 January 1907 at Magdalena Bay, Mexico. Princeton proceeded to Corinto, Nicaragua, arriving 17 March for the purpose of protecting American interests there. She transported troops from Ampala, Honduras, to La Unión, (12 April) and brought General Bonilla back to Salina Cruz, Mexico (13 April). She returned to San Diego on 30 May and decommissioned on 3 July 1907 at Bremerton, Washington. =Nicaraguan Expedition, 1909–1911= A bell presented to USS Princeton by the alumni of Princeton University in December 1898. Princeton recommissioned on 5 November 1909 at Bremerton and sailed on 28 November for Central America for duty with the Nicaraguan Expeditionary Squadron.

Black, 538 U.S. 343 (2003), is a First Amendment case decided in the Supreme Court of the United States. Three defendants were convicted in two separate cases of violating a Virginia statute against cross burning. In this case, the Court struck down that statute to the extent that it considered cross burning as prima facie evidence of intent to intimidate. Such a provision, the Court argued, blurs the distinction between proscribable \\"threats of intimidation\\" and the Ku Klux Klan's protected \\"messages of shared ideology.\\" However, cross-burning can be a criminal offense if the intent to intimidate is proven. It was argued by former Solicitor General of Virginia, William Hurd.  Background  In cases such as Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, , New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, , R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul (1992) and others, the Supreme Court has addressed various areas of controversial speech. The Court has frequently sided with the speakers, but occasionally the Court has sided with the government and acknowledged its (limited) power to pass laws protecting citizens from specific types of harmful speech. On May 2, 1998 Richard Elliot and Jonathan O'Mara attempted to light a cross on the property of Elliot's neighbor (who was black) in Virginia Beach, Virginia. On August 22, 1998 Barry Black held a Ku Klux Klan rally on private property and with the consent of the owner in Carroll County, Virginia. A neighbor and the county sheriff witnessed the event and heard attendees make many negative comments concerning black people. During the rally a cross was lit. Black was arrested and charged with violating a Virginia statute outlawing cross burnings. All defendants were found guilty. Black's and Elliot/O'Mara's cases were combined upon appeal and reached the U.S. Supreme Court during the Fall 2002 session..  Majority  Justice Sandra Day O'Connor delivered the opinion stating, \\"a state, consistent with the First Amendment, may ban cross burning carried out with the intent to intimidate.\\" In so doing, the Court considered the speech to be constitutionally unprotected \\"true threats.\\" Under that carve-out, \\"a State may choose to prohibit only those forms of intimidation that are most likely to inspire fear of bodily harm.\\" In Virginia v. Black the Court found that Virginia's statute against cross burning is unconstitutional with respect to the text in the statute that states \\"Any such burning of a cross shall be prima facie evidence of an intent to intimidate a person or group of persons.\\" This text in particular was found to be unconstitutional as it violates the Fourteenth Amendment insofar as it provides the presumption, that the act of cross burning is evidence of the intent to intimidate. In Sandstrom v. Montana, 442 U.S. 510, 99 S. Ct. 2450, 61 L. Ed. 2d 39 (1979), the Court held when a jury is instructed in such a manner where; > the law presumes a person intends the ordinary consequences of his voluntary > acts, [the jury] may have interpreted the presumption as conclusive or as > shifting the burden of persuasion, and because either interpretation would > have violated the Fourteenth Amendment's requirement that the state prove > every element of a criminal offense beyond a reasonable doubt, the > instruction given was unconstitutional. In essence, the Fourteenth Amendment prevents a jury instruction when that instruction includes: a presumption, that shifts the burden of proof with regards to an essential element of the crime away from the state and onto the defendant, in a criminal trial. Thus, the Fourteenth Amendment was violated by the text of the statute where the intent to intimidate was presumed from the action of cross burning. However, the Court found the statute constitutional with regards to the language limiting cross burning with the intent to intimidate as a valid conduct restriction as the regulation was: within the constitutional power of the government, where the conduct regulation furthers an important government interest and such government interest is unrelated to the suppression of speech, and the incidental burden (secondary effect) on speech is no greater than necessary. By structuring the language of the statute to restrict conduct only with the intent to intimidate, the Virginia legislature satisfied all three prongs of the O'Brien test (see United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367 (1968)). The limitation of the conduct was within the constitutional power of the government based on the First Amendment exception known as the \\"true threats\\" doctrine. The conduct restriction furthered an important government interest that was unrelated to the suppression of speech, because, \\"cross burning done with the intent to intimidate has a long and pernicious history as a signal of impending violence.\\" Virginia v. Black, 538 U.S. 343, 123 S. Ct. 1536, 1539, 155 L. Ed. 2d 535 (2003). Finally, the secondary effect on speech was no greater than necessary as it restricted the conduct only when accompanied by the intent to intimidate. It is important to distinguish the Virginia statute from a similar statute which was held facially unconstitutional for overbreadth in R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, Minn., 505 U.S. 377, 112 S. Ct. 2538, 120 L. Ed. 2d 305 (1992).  Dissents  Justice Clarence Thomas argued that cross-burning itself should be a First Amendment exception, as others have argued regarding flag-burning (see Chief Justice William Rehnquist’s dissenting opinion in Texas v. Johnson), due to the historical association of cross-burning with terrorism. \\"[T]his statute,\\" Thomas wrote, \\"prohibits only conduct, not expression. And, just as one cannot burn down someone's house to make a political point and then seek refuge in the First Amendment, those who hate cannot terrorize and intimidate to make their point.\\" Justice David Souter argued that cross-burning, even with the proven intent to intimidate, should not be a crime under the R.A.V. v.

Hay was born in Jefferson County, Indiana, to Robert and Margaret Hay. In 1870, Hay graduated with a bachelor of arts from Eureka College in Illinois. He taught at the college as a sciences professor from 1870–1873. He married Mary E. Howsmon of Eureka, Illinois, in 1870. He was a professor at Oskaloosa College in Iowa from 1874–1876. He was a student at Yale University from 1876–1877. Seventeen years after earning his bachelors, he earned his PhD from Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana. From 1877–1879, he taught at Abingdon College just before it was incorporated into his alma mater, Eureka College. His longest professorship was at Butler University from 1879–1892. From 1894 to 1895, he worked at the Field Museum of Natural History as assistant curator of zoology, where despite his specialty in ichthyology, he worked in all nonornithological fields of zoology. In 1912, Hay was appointed as a research associate at the Carnegie Institution for Science, and was given office space at the United States National Museum. There, he did much work with the USNM's collections in vertebrate paleontology. He published extensively on fossil turtles and Pleistocene mammals. The catalogs that he constructed were a great aid in recording existing knowledge and became standard references. His papers from 1911 to 1930 are stored at the Smithsonian Institution. Oliver and Mary had four children together. Their son, William Perry Hay, was also a zoologist.

The plot follows two British nurses on a cycling holiday in rural France; during their trip, one of them vanishes, and the other struggles to search for her in a rural community. It was the first movie made under Bryan Forbes at EMI Films to be released (Hoffman had been made first but was released later). Plot Jane and Cathy are two young nurses from Nottingham who are taking a cycling holiday through rural France. While having lunch at a busy restaurant, Cathy notices a handsome man drinking alone at an adjacent table. Shortly after the women depart, the man also leaves the cafe on a Lambretta scooter. On a country road surrounded by farmland, the women are passed by the man on his scooter. Several minutes later, the women pass by him as he rests by a cemetery. As the women pass through a small village, they encounter the man again. Cathy, who has grown tired of cycling, decides she wants to sunbathe, and stops at a wooded area along the road. Jane agrees to rest momentarily, but the two women get into an argument over the trip itinerary, and Jane decides to continue on alone. Jane soon arrives at a rural roadside cafe, where the proprietor, Madame Lassal, warns her that the area is dangerous and that she should not be travelling alone. Meanwhile, Cathy, still sunbathing, becomes unnerved and senses she is being watched. Upon trying to leave, she finds that someone has destroyed the wheel of her bicycle. Moments later, she is confronted by an unseen assailant. Feeling guilty over leaving Cathy behind, Jane returns to the spot where she was sunbathing. She finds no sign of Cathy, apart from her camera lying in the grass. Moments later, the man the women saw earlier at the restaurant stops along the road on his scooter. He introduces himself as Paul, and Jane explains to him that she is looking for Cathy. Paul offers Jane a ride back to the village, where she believes Cathy may have gone. While questioning locals in town, Jane learns of an unsolved rape and murder of a young woman that occurred in the town the year before. Meanwhile, Paul rides into the woods on his scooter to search for Cathy. Jane encounters a British schoolmistress in town who drives her part-way to meet the gendarme and report Cathy's disappearance. En route, the schoolmistress tells Jane the unsolved murder occurred in the same wooded area from which Cathy vanished. Unable to locate the gendarme, Jane returns to the roadside cafe and asks Madam Lassal for help, but she again urges Jane to leave the area. Jane again encounters Paul, who reveals he is a private investigator who researched the case of the murdered woman. The two get into an argument when Jane discovers Paul has taken the film from Cathy's camera as evidence. Convinced he has hurt Cathy, Jane parts ways with him. Running through the town on foot, Jane finally locates the residence of the gendarme, and explains what has occurred. The gendarme goes to investigate the scene, leaving Jane alone at his residence. Paul arrives at the house, but Jane refuses to open the door. When he breaks into the gendarme's home, Jane flees into the woods, where she stumbles upon an abandoned trailer park. While hiding in a camper, Jane finds Cathy's corpse. Paul manages to corner Jane in the woods, but she beats him in the face with a rock. At the edge of the abandoned trailer park, Jane finds the gendarme. As she embraces him, the gendarme begins to fondle her sexually. He begins to attack her, revealing himself to be the perpetrator. Jane attempts to fend him off, and is rescued by an injured Paul, who hits the gendarme with a large branch.

The screenplay was written by Brian Clemens and Terry Nation, both of whom had contributed to The Avengers, as well as to several ITC crime series made in Britain. It was also scored by Avengers theme composer Laurie Johnson. It was one of the first films made under Bryan Forbes at EMI Films.AND SOON THE DARKNESS Monthly Film Bulletin; London Vol. 37, Iss. 432, (Jan 1, 1970): 162. It was shot entirely in France.

Clemens was involved in producing and storyboarding the film, and said it inspired him to try directing. He later commented, \\"My business partner (Albert Fennell) said 'You should have directed it' and suddenly I thought 'Yeah, perhaps I should have done'. I knew I could have directed it better.\\" He went on to write what became See No Evil for Forbes at EMI; after Forbes left the company the film was made at Columbia. Clemens eventually turned director with Captain Kronos, Vampire Hunter. =Critical= The film was also not received particularly well critically. Time Out called it \\"nasty\\",Time Out website review and The New York Times said it displayed \\"poverty of imagination\\". The British film critic Leslie Halliwell noted that it had \\"some pretension to style\\".Halliwell's Film Guide entry =DVD= The film was released as a DVD in the US with an audio commentary by Fuest and Clemens, and released in the UK as a region 2 DVD at the end of January 2008.

From its beginning as a sparsely populated trading port to today's cosmopolitan international financial centre and world city of over seven million people, the territory has attracted refugees, immigrants and expatriates alike searching for a new life. Citizenship matters were complicated by the fact that British nationality law treated those born in :Hong Kong as British subjects (although they did not enjoy full rights and citizenship), while the People's Republic of China did not recognise Hong Kongers with Chinese ancestry as British. The main legal rationale for the Chinese position was that recognising these people as British could be seen as tacit acceptance of a series of treaties which China considers \\"unequal\\" – including the ones which ceded the Hong Kong Island, the Kowloon Peninsula and the land between the Kowloon Peninsula and the Sham Chun River and neighbouring islands (i.e. the New Territories) to the UK. The main political reason was to prevent the vast majority of Hong Kong residents from having any recourse to British assistance (e.g. by claiming consular assistance or protection under an external treaty) after the handover of Hong Kong. Early colonial era English common law has the rationale of natural-born citizenship, following the principle of jus soli, in the theory that people born within the dominion of The Crown, which included self- governing dominions and Crown colonies, would have a \\"natural allegiance\\" to the Crown as a \\"debt of gratitude\\" to the Crown for protecting them through infancy. As the dominion of the British Empire expanded, British subjects included not only persons within the United Kingdom but also those throughout the rest of the British Empire. By this definition, anyone born in Hong Kong after it became a British colony in 1842 was a British subject. The Naturalisation of Aliens Act 1847 expanded what had been covered in the Naturalisation Act 1844, which applied only to people within the United Kingdom, to all its dominions and colonies. The Act made provisions for naturalisation as well as allowing for acquisition of British subject status by marriage between a foreign woman and a man with British subject status. =British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act 1914= The British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act 1914 (now renamed as \\"Status of Aliens Act 1914\\") came into force on 1 January 1915, codifying for the first time the law relating to British nationality. No major change was introduced but it set into law how people associated with Hong Kong – as part of \\"His Majesty's dominions\\" – would acquire British subject status. =British Nationality Act 1948= The Commonwealth of Nations' heads of government decided in 1948 to embark on a major change in the law of nationality throughout the Commonwealth. It was decided at the conference that the United Kingdom and the self-governing dominions would each adopt separate national citizenship, but retain the common imperial status of British subject. The British Nationality Act 1948 provided for a new status of Citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies (CUKC), consisting of British subjects who had a close relationship (either through birth or descent) with the United Kingdom and its remaining colonies. The Act also provided that British subjects could be known by the alternative title Commonwealth citizen. The Act came into force on 1 January 1949 and stipulated that anyone born in \\"United Kingdom or a colony\\" on or after that date was a CUKC. Those who were British subjects on 31 December 1948 were entitled to acquire CUKC status by declaration. The deadline for this was originally 31 December 1949, but the deadline was extended to 31 December 1962 by the British Nationality Act 1958. British Nationality Acts were passed in 1958, 1964 and 1965, which mainly fine-tuned special provisions about CUKC status acquisition. =Commonwealth Immigrants Acts= Until 1962, all Commonwealth citizens could enter and stay in the United Kingdom without any restriction. Anticipating immigration waves from former and current colonies in Africa and Asia with the decolonisation of the 1960s, the United Kingdom passed the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962 and Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1968 to tighten immigration control for CUKCs into the United Kingdom. As such, CUKCs connected with Hong Kong were subject to immigration control after 1962. Finally, under the Immigration Act 1971, the concept of patriality or right of abode was created. CUKCs and other Commonwealth citizens had the right of abode in the UK only if they, their husband (if female), their parents or their grandparents were connected with the United Kingdom. This placed the UK in the rare position of denying some of its nationals entry into their country of nationality. However, the concept of patriality was only a temporary solution to halt a sudden wave of migration. The British government later reformed the law, resulting in the British Nationality Act 1981. These acts shaped an increasingly restrictive immigration policy into the UK for Hong Kong residents even before the Sino- British Joint Declaration of 1984. = British Nationality Act 1981 and British Dependent Territories Citizenship = A British passport for a BDTC with connection with Hong Kong The British Nationality Act 1981 created new categories of British nationality and renamed British colonial territories. After implementation, all British Crown colonies became British Dependent Territories. The Act abolished the status of CUKC, and replaced it with three new categories of nationality on 1 January 1983: * British Citizen (for residents of the UK and the Crown dependencies) * British Dependent Territories Citizen (BDTC) (for the Crown colonies), and * British Overseas Citizen (BOC) (a class of non-inheritable nationality for those who are unable to become a British Citizen, a BDTC or a national of another country) The law stated that those who have CUKC status by connection with Hong Kong and those born in Hong Kong on or after 1983 to a parent settled in Hong Kong are BDTCs. The law also stated that British Citizens or BDTCs by descent could not automatically pass on British nationality to a child born outside the United Kingdom or the dependent territories concerned unless a parent acquired citizenship otherwise than by descent. After the Sino-British Joint Declaration 100px 100px 100px Negotiation concerning the future of Hong Kong started in the late 1970s between Britain and China. With the signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration on 19 December 1984, the future of Hong Kong was set, with China to assume sovereignty of the entire territory of Hong Kong on 1 July 1997. At that time, there were some 3.5 million residents of Hong Kong with BDTC status by virtue of their connection with Hong Kong. Another 2 million were believed to have been eligible to apply to become BDTCs. After the handover, they would have lost this status and became solely Chinese nationals. At the time, Hong Kong was the largest of the remaining British dependent territories with over 5 million inhabitants. =Creation of the British National (Overseas) status= The Hong Kong Act 1985 created an additional category of British nationality known as British National (Overseas) or BN(O). This new category was available only to Hong Kong BDTCs, and any Hong Kong BDTC who wished to do so would be able to acquire the status of BN(O). The status was non-transferable and available only by application, and the deadline to apply was 30 June 1997. British Overseas Citizen status for those who are 'otherwise stateless' Any Hong Kong BDTCs who failed to register as a BN(O) by 1 July 1997 and would thereby be rendered stateless (generally because they were a non-ethnic Chinese and therefore could not automatically acquire Chinese nationality), automatically became a British Overseas Citizen under the Hong Kong (British Nationality) Order 1986. =British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act 1990: British citizenship for 50,000 Hong Kong families= After the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989, many people in Hong Kong began to fear for their future post-1997. Emigration was rampant and a brain-drain was beginning to affect the economy of Hong Kong. To stem the drain, people urged the British government to grant full British citizenship to all Hong Kong BDTCs – but this request was never accepted. However, the British did agree to creating the British Nationality Selection Scheme, which granted to a select 50,000 people and their families the ability to obtain full British citizenship without having to fulfill the ordinary requirements, under the British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act 1990. Under the Act, the Home Secretary was required to register any person recommended by the Governor of Hong Kong (as well as the applicant's spouse and minor children) as a British Citizen. Any person who was registered under the act automatically ceased to be a BDTC upon registration as a British Citizen. No person could be registered under the act after 30 June 1997. =Hong Kong (War Wives and Widows) Act 1996: British citizenship for Hong Kong war wives and widows= Women who had received assurance from the Secretary of State that they would be eligible for settlement in the United Kingdom on the basis of their husband's war service in the defence of Hong Kong may be registered as British Citizens if they were resident in Hong Kong and had not remarried. There is no requirement for the woman to hold (or have held) any form of British nationality. Women registered as British Citizens under this act acquire British citizenship \\"otherwise than by descent\\" and thus also their children would be British Citizens. =British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act 1997: British citizenship for British Nationals (Overseas) without Chinese ancestry= Another special group of solely Hong Kong British nationals were the non-Chinese ethnic minorities of Hong Kong. They are primarily immigrants or children of immigrants from Nepal, India and Pakistan. After the handover to China, they would not be accepted as inherently being citizens of the People's Republic. They would be left effectively stateless – they would have British nationality and permanent residency and right of abode in Hong Kong, but no right of abode in the UK, nor a right to claim Chinese nationality. The ethnic minorities petitioned to be granted full British citizenship,A Pasage to Nowhere (Prism Nov 1995) accessed 1 Aug 2010 and were backed by several politicians Jack Straw, then the Shadow Home Secretary said in a letter to the then Home Secretary Michael Howard dated 30 January 1997 that \\"common sense and common humanity demand that we give these people full British citizenship. The limbo in which they will find themselves in July arises directly from the agreements which Britain made with China\\". He further stated that a claim that BN(O) status amounts to British nationality \\"is pure sophistry\\". and media.The Economist also said that \\"the failure to offer citizenship to most of Hong Kong's residents was shameful\\", and \\"it was the height of cynicism to hand 6 million people over to a regime of proven brutality without allowing them any means to move elsewhere.\\" The article also stated that the real reason that the new Labour government still refused to give full British citizenship to other BDTCs was because if the UK waited until Hong Kong had been disposed of it \\"would be seen as highly cynical\\", as The Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean, a Foreign Office minister, conceded. (\\"Britain's colonial obligations\\", 3 July 1997, The Economist) The subsequently enacted British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act 1997 gives them an entitlement to acquire full British citizenship by making an application to register for that status after 1 July 1997. =Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002: British Overseas Territories Citizen status is not applicable to Hong Kong= In light of the passing of the British Overseas Territories Act 2002, which made provision to substitute the wording of \\"British Dependent Territories\\" with \\"British Overseas Territories\\" in the British Nationality Act 1981 among other new provisions, further clarification was made even though this act did not even apply to Hong Kong. Section 14 of the subsequent Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 stated specifically that a person may not be registered as a British Overseas Territories Citizen (BOTC) by virtue of a connection with Hong Kong. =Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009: British citizenship for British Nationals (Overseas) who do not have another nationality or citizenship= A small group of Hong Kong ethnic minorities had not been eligible for acquiring British citizenship under the British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act 1997 because they were not ordinarily resident in Hong Kong before 4 February 1997 or they were under 18 / 21 years of age, had dual nationality through their parents on or after 4 February 1997, but had lost it upon turning 18/21. These BN(O)s lost their second nationality due to changes in the nationality laws of certain countries and had, therefore, become de facto stateless. They could register to become British citizens under section 4B of the British Nationality Act 1981 as amended by Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 to \\"remedy the limbo status of probably the last remaining group of solely British nationals who have no other nationality or citizenship, who have not recently and deliberately given up another nationality or citizenship\\".Lord Avebury in the House of Lords To be eligible for registration, they must demonstrate that they had not lost, through action or inaction, any other nationality on and after 19 March 2009. Registration under s4B confers British citizenship by descent. Chinese view on nationality of Hong Kong residents The Chinese government stated in its memorandum of the Sino-British Joint Declaration on December 19, 1984 that under the Chinese nationality law, \\"all Hong Kong Chinese compatriots, whether they are holders of the 'British Dependent Territories Citizens' Passport' or not, are Chinese nationals\\". In 1990, when the Gulf War started, the Chinese embassy provided a proof of Chinese citizenship to a Hong Kong Chinese businessman in Kuwait holding a BDTC passport and helped him evacuate. Chinese nationality law has applied in Hong Kong since the handover on 1 July 1997. Hong Kong BDTC status ceased to exist and cannot be regained. An interpretation for implementing Chinese nationality law for Hong Kong was presented at the Nineteenth Session of the Standing Committee of the Eighth National People's Congress on 15 May 1996, a year prior to the Hong Kong handover and came into effect on 1 July 1997. The explanations concerning the implementation of the nationality of Hong Kong citizens is that Hong Kong citizens of Chinese descent are Chinese nationals whether or not they have acquired other foreign citizenship(s). Where such Chinese nationals resident in Hong Kong undergo a change of citizenship (e.g. in accordance with Article 9 of the Nationality Law, which provides that a person who becomes settled in a foreign country and acquires foreign citizenship loses his or her Chinese citizenship - Hong Kong is not recognised as foreign territory, before or after 1 July 1997), this must be declared to immigration authorities to be recognised under Chinese nationality law. British nationality acquired in Hong Kong - including BN(O) and under the British Nationality Selection Scheme - are specifically not recognised as a change of nationality because they did not occur after the person became settled in a foreign country. Therefore, a Hong Kong resident who had acquired non-Chinese citizenship would still be recognised as a Chinese citizen after 1 July 1997 (effectively becoming a dual national), but if that person declares the change of nationality to immigration authorities, they would effectively cease to be a Chinese national. This is reflected in the position the Hong Kong Immigration Department has on Hong Kong permanent residents of Chinese nationality who were Hong Kong permanent residents immediately before 1 July 1997 and hold non-Chinese nationality or citizenship. Those who were permanent residents before the Handover continue to enjoy right of abode in Hong Kong whether they have remained overseas for long time or hold foreign nationality. They however, will not enjoy foreign consular protection in Hong Kong as long as they do not declare a change of nationality to the Immigration Department. Recent groups eligible for a form of British nationalityBritish citizenship for non-ethnic Chinese which were wrongfully denied= In February 2006, in response to representations made by Lord Avebury and Tameem Ebrahim, British authorities announced that six hundred British citizenship applications of ethnic minority children of Indian descent from Hong Kong were wrongly refused. The applications dated from the period July 1997 onwards. Where the applicant in such cases confirms that he or she still wishes to receive British citizenship the decision will be reconsidered on request. =British Overseas Citizen status/British citizenship for certain ethnic Indians (new Indian law)= Recent changes to India's Citizenship Act, 1955 (see Indian nationality law) provide that Indian citizenship by descent can no longer be acquired automatically at the time of birth. This amendment will also allow some children of Indian origin born in Hong Kong after 3 December 2004 who have a BN(O) or BOC parent to automatically acquire BOC status at birth under the provisions for reducing statelessness in articles 6(2) and 6(3) of the Hong Kong (British Nationality) Order, 1986. If they have acquired no other nationality after birth, they will be entitled to register for full British citizenship. https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds04/text/41220w04.htm#column_WA123 =British Overseas Citizen status/British citizenship for certain ethnic Nepalese (reinterpretation of Nepalese law)= Recent clarification of Nepal citizenship law has meant a number of persons born in Hong Kong who failed to renounce their British nationality before the age of 21 and were previously thought to be citizens of Nepal are in fact solely British. The British Government has recently accepted that certain Nepalese passport holders born in Hong Kong before 30 June 1976 are BOCs, and can register for British citizenship if they wish to do so. =British citizenship for British Nationals (Overseas) who are otherwise stateless= The passage of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 provides a path for British Nationals (Overseas) who had no other citizenship before 19 March 2009 to apply for British citizenship under s. 4B of the British Nationality Act 1981. To qualify, they must demonstrate that they had not lost or renounced any other nationalities, through action or inaction, on or after 19 March 2009. Future of the British National (Overseas) status: Lord Goldsmith's citizenship review in 2008 Lord Goldsmith discussed the BN(O) issue in his citizenship review in 2008. He regarded the BN(O) status as \\"anomalous\\" in the history of British nationality law, but saw no alternative to preserving this status.\\"Nonetheless to remove this status without putting something significant in its place would be seen as the British reneging on their promise to the people of Hong Kong. The only option which would be characterized as fair would be to offer existing BN(O) holders the right to gain full British citizenship. It is likely that many would not take this up as the prospects economic and fiscal of moving to the UK are not favourable to those well-established in Hong Kong. However, I am advised that this would be a breach of the commitments made between China and the UK in the 1984 Joint Declaration on the future of Hong Kong, an international treaty between the two countries; and that to secure Chinese agreement to vary the terms of that treaty would not be possible. On that basis, I see no alternative but to preserve this one anomalous category of citizenship\\": Chapter 4, paragraph 12. However, Goldsmith stated in February 2020: “I want to make it clear: I never intended my report on citizenship to be a statement on any opinion by me that there would be a breach of the arrangements with China if the UK were to offer greater rights,” he said. “I do not see why the UK government would be in breach of any obligation undertaken in the joint declaration were it to resolve to extend full right of abode to BN(O) passport holders while continuing to honour their side of the Sino-British Joint Declaration.” See also *British passport *British National (Overseas) passport *History of British nationality law *Hong Kong Special Administrative Region passport *Exit & Entry Permit – issued by the Republic of China (Taiwan) to Hong Kong and Macao residents for entry to Taiwan *Right of abode in Hong Kong =Government documents= *Lord Goldsmith QC Citizenship Review Citizenship: Our Common Bond *British citizenship information for persons from Hong Kong of Indian origin *British citizenship information for persons from Hong Kong of Nepalese origin *Home Office letter to Lord Avebury, confirming that more than 600 applications for British citizenship from Hong Kong were wrongly refused *British government statement confirming which persons born in Hong Kong before 1949 acquired British nationality *British government statement confirming which persons born in Hong Kong between 1949 and 1982 acquired British nationality *British government statement confirming which persons born in Hong Kong between 1983 and 1997 acquired British nationality *SUPPORTING BRITISH NATIONALS ABROAD: A GUIDE TO CONSULAR ASSISTANCE *Reciprocity Schedule (United Kingdom), United States *Reciprocity Schedule (Hong Kong), United States *BN(O) passport TV advertisement in 1994 =Legislations= *British Nationality Acts: 1981, 1965, 1964, 1958, 1948, 1772, 1730 *Hong Kong (British Nationality) Order 1986 *Provisions for reducing statelessness in Article 6 of the Hong Kong (British Nationality) Order 1986 =Newspapers/Commentaries= *The Transition of Hong Kong People's Nationality after World War II by Michiko Ai *Nationality of the Chief Executive of the SAR, Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong *數字話當年 450萬人持特區護照, Apple Daily *BNO逐漸走進香港歷史, Wen Wei Po *BNO護照≠英籍, Mingpao *SUBMISSION TO LORD GOLDSMITH FOR THE CITIZENSHIP REVIEW: THE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES OF BRITISH NATIONALITY, Immigration Law Practitioners' Association ReferencesExternal links *張勇、陳玉田：《香港居民的國籍問題》（出版社：三聯書店（香港）） (Chinese) *《修改英國國籍法的深刻教訓》, Leung Chun Ying, Mingpao, 16 March 2007 *《人心尚未回歸國人仍需努力》, Leung Chun Ying, Mingpao, 1 June 2007 * Ng Chi-sum, Jane C.Y.

Life  Friedländer settled in Berlin in 1771. As the son-in-law of the rich banker Daniel Itzig, and a friend, pupil, and subsequently intellectual successor of Moses Mendelssohn, he occupied a prominent position in both Jewish and non-Jewish circles of Berlin. His endeavors on behalf of the Jews and Judaism included the emancipation of the Jews of Berlin and the various reforms connected therewith. Frederick William II, on his accession, called a committee whose duty was to acquaint him with the grievances of the Jews, Friedländer and Itzig being chosen as general delegates. But the results of the conference were such that the Jews declared themselves unable to accept the reforms proposed, and not until after the French Revolution, with the edict of March 11, 1812, did the Jews then living on Prussian territory succeed in obtaining equal rights from Frederick William III. Friedländer and his friends in the community of Berlin now turned their attention to the reform of worship in harmony with modern ideas and the changed social position of the Jews. The proposition in itself was unjustified, and the propositions of Friedländer, who had meanwhile been called (1813) to the conferences on the reorganization of the Jewish cult held in the Israelite Consistory of Westphalia () at Cassel, were unacceptable to even the most radical members, as they tended to reduce Judaism to a mere colorless code of ethics. Friedländer was more successful in his educational endeavors. He was one of the founders of a Jewish free school (1778), which he directed in association with his brother-in-law, Isaac Daniel Itzig. In this school, however, exclusively Jewish subjects were soon crowded out. Friedländer also wrote text-books, and was one of the first to translate the Hebrew prayer-book into German. The \\"dry baptism\\" initiative Friedländer was concerned with endeavors to facilitate for himself and other Jews entry into Christian circles. This disposition was evidenced in 1799 by his radical proposal to a leading Protestant provost in Berlin (Oberconsistorialrat) Wilhelm Teller. Friedländer's open letter (Sendschreiben) \\"in the name of some Jewish heads of families,\\" stated that Jews would be ready to undergo \\"dry baptism\\": join the Lutheran Church on the basis of shared moral values if they were not required to believe in the divinity of Jesus and might evade certain Christian ceremonies. Much of the Open Letter was a polemic arguing that the Mosaic rituals were largely obsolete. So Judaism would thereby in return abandon many of its ceremonial features. The proposal \\"envisioned the establishment of a confederated unitarian church-synagogue.\\"Amos Elon: The Pity of It All: A History of the Jews in Germany, 1743-1933 (Metropolitan Books, 2002) pp.73-75 This \\"Sendschreiben an Seine Hochwürden Herrn Oberconsistorialrath und Probst Teller zu Berlin, von einigen Hausvätern Jüdischer Religion\\" (Berlin, 1799), elicited over a score of responses in pamphlets and the popular press, including ones from Abraham Teller and Friedrich Schleiermacher. Both rejected the notion of a sham conversion to Christianity as harmful to Christianity and the State, though, in line with Enlightenment values, neither precluded the idea of more civil rights for unconverted Jews. Jewish reaction to Friedländer's initiative was overwhelmingly hostile - it was called \\"a dishonorable act\\" and \\"desertion\\". Heinrich Graetz called him an \\"ape\\". In 1816, when the Prussian government decided to improve the situation of the Polish Jews, Franciszek Malczewski (Malziewsky), Bishop of Kujawy, consulted Friedländer. Friedländer gave the bishop a circumstantial account of the material and intellectual condition of the Jews, and indicated the means by which it might be ameliorated. Literary career Friedländer displayed great activity in literary work. Induced by Moses Mendelssohn, he began the translation into German of some parts of the Bible according to Mendelssohn's commentary. He translated Mendelssohn's \\"Sefer ha-Nefesh,\\" Berlin, 1787, and \\"Ḳohelet,\\" 1788. He wrote a Hebrew commentary to Abot and also translated it, Vienna, 1791; \\"Reden der Erbauung gebildeten Israeliten gewidmet,\\" Berlin, 1815-17; \\"Moses Mendelssohn, von ihm und über ihn,\\" ib. 1819; \\"Ueber die Verbesserung der Israeliten im Königreich Polen,\\" ib. 1819, this being the answer which he wrote to the Bishop of Kujawia; \\"Beiträge zur Geschichte der Judenverfolgung im XIX. Jahrhundert durch Schriftsteller,\\" ib. 1820. Friedländer was assessor of the Royal College of Manufacture and Commerce of Berlin, and the first Jew to sit in the municipal council of that city. His wealth enabled him to be a patron of science and art, among those he encouraged being the brothers Alexander and Wilhelm von Humboldt.  Works  * Lesebuch für jüdische Kinder, Nachdr. d. Ausg.

Left side: Phragmoplast forms and cell plate starts to assemble in the center of the cell. Towards the right: Phragmoplast enlarges in a donut-shape towards the outside of the cell, leaving behind mature cell plate in the center. The cell plate will transform into the new cell wall once cytokinesis is complete. Cytokinesis in terrestrial plants occurs by cell plate formation. This process entails the delivery of Golgi-derived and endosomal vesicles carrying cell wall and cell membrane components to the plane of cell division and the subsequent fusion of these vesicles within this plate. After formation of an early tubulo-vesicular network at the center of the cell, the initially labile cell plate consolidates into a tubular network and eventually a fenestrated sheet. The cell plate grows outward from the center of the cell to the parental plasma membrane with which it will fuse, thus completing cell division. Formation and growth of the cell plate is dependent upon the phragmoplast, which is required for proper targeting of Golgi-derived vesicles to the cell plate. As the cell plate matures in the central part of the cell, the phragmoplast disassembles in this region and new elements are added on its outside. This process leads to a steady expansion of the phragmoplast and, concomitantly, to a continuous retargeting of Golgi-derived vesicles to the growing edge of the cell plate. Once the cell plate reaches and fuses with the plasma membrane the phragmoplast disappears. This event not only marks the separation of the two daughter cells, but also initiates a range of biochemical modifications that transform the callose-rich, flexible cell plate into a cellulose-rich, stiff primary cell wall. The heavy dependence of cell plate formation on active Golgi stacks explains why plant cells, unlike animal cells, do not disassemble their secretion machinery during cell division.

He made his first appearance during the episode broadcast on 10 November 2003 and last appearance on 15 January 2007. During his time on the programme, Charlie gradually became the show's third antagonist after being transpired to have a narcissistic, manipulative and despicable streak. This became evident during most of the character's story arc, which saw Charlie spark a relationship local landlady Shelley Unwin (Sally Lindsay) - whom he ends up mistreating, up to the point where he clashes with her interfering mother Bev (Susie Blake), before she eventually jilts him at their wedding. He then went on to proceed in forming a close friendship with his colleague Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas); instigate a feud with Shelley's ex-husband Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne) after assaulting him; embark on an affair with Jason's girlfriend Maria Sutherland (Samia Smith); attempt to drown local teenager David Platt (Jack P. Shepherd) in retribution for the latter trying to blackmail him; and repeatedly clashes with Maria's best friend Claire Peacock (Julia Haworth) over his antagonistic nature. In his exit storyline, Charlie recoups his once-broken romance with Peter's stepsister Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford) - who, unbeknownst to him, is plotting to exact revenge on the character after discovering the extent of his affairs and deceit. This ultimately results in Tracy attacking Charlie with an ornament, which consequently results in Charlie being hospitalised and later dying of his injuries. Storylines Charlie Stubbs first arrived in Weatherfield along with one of his fellow builders. Upon arrival, they become outraged when local factory owner Mike Baldwin (Johnny Briggs) refuses to move his car so they could park their vehicle. In retaliation, they used a bulldozer to move Mike’s car and it was narrowly saved from being smashed up. Charlie later began dating Shelley Unwin (Sally Lindsay), which further escalated into a relationship. However, Charlie was unfaithful. When arsonist Maya Sharma (Sasha Behar) set fire to the Corner Shop on Coronation Street, Charlie and Ciaran McCarthy (Keith Duffy) broke in and rescued Dev (Jimmi Harkishin) and Sunita Alahan (Shobna Gulati). Charlie eventually began harassing Shelley at every opportunity. At one point, he tried to make her choose between him and her mother, Bev (Susie Blake). On one occasion he ripped out Shelley’s earrings in a fit of rage. When he asked his colleague Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas) for a sealant gun, Betty Williams (Betty Driver) overheard their conversation on the phone and thought Charlie wanted a genuine firearm. She phoned the police and he was arrested. When he was released, however, he became less violent. He accidentally opened a door which hit Shelley in the face. This caused him to lock her in her bedroom to stop people seeing her face as he knew people would think he was abusing her. Charlie later began to abuse Shelley mentally rather than physically, which caused her to develop agoraphobia. However, she received treatment and Charlie proposed to her, but she jilted him on their wedding day. Despite begging for forgiveness, Shelley refused reconciliation. In 2005, Charlie began a relationship with Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford). He convinced her to move in with him and later in February 2006, manipulated her into having her daughter Amy (Madison Hampson/Amber Chadwick) move in with her parents. In turn, Tracy began to manipulate Charlie. She pretended to be pregnant and used the money he gave her for an abortion to buy expensive shoes and used her \\"grief\\" to have him allow Amy to move back in. When Shelley visited before her mother’s marriage to Fred Elliott (John Savident), she and Charlie had a one-night stand. She told Tracy about their night of passion, who accused her of lying. Shelley later revealed that she was pregnant with Charlie’s baby but didn’t allow Charlie to have anything to do with the baby, and left. He and Tracy briefly split but reconciled. Charlie later began an affair with Maria Sutherland (Samia Smith), who was renting his flat. When David Platt (Jack P. Shepherd) discovered the affair he tried to blackmail Charlie, threatening to reveal the affair to Tracy. Charlie retaliated by trying to drown David in the bath. When Tracy eventually found out about the affair, they split once more. Tracy began to plot revenge against Charlie and pretended to make amends with Charlie. She pretended he was abusing her to the point of burning herself with an iron to make it look like Charlie was responsible for her injuries. Charlie eventually realised his partner was seeking revenge and when he was about to tell her their relationship was over, she insisted on performing a lap dance for him. She hit him round the head with a heavy ornament, and he later died in hospital. She claimed she’d killed him in self-defence but the court found her guilty and she was given a life sentence. In December 2010, Tracy returned to the cobbles after being released on legal technicalities. Creation and development Actor Bill Ward was cast in the role of Charlie. Bill Ward signed a new contract with the British soap opera in early 2005 because the producers planned \\"to build Charlie's narcissistic and sadistic behavior towards Shelley (Sally Lindsay)\\" throughout the year. Upon the announcement that the character would begin a romance with Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford), a Coronation Street insider revealed that it was \\"a piece of genius by the writers pairing the show's biggest bitch with the vilest villain\\", and that \\"the antics they will get up to will obviously cause misery and heartache for many people.\\" It was also revealed that \\"it was decided that the two characters of Charlie and Tracy were very much part of the programmes long- term future\\", and that it \\"therefore made sense to cement them together as a couple and to give them storylines guaranteed to make them two of Weatherfield's 'most hated'.\\" Charlie’s character was expected to become \\"the most hated man on telly\\" when it was announced that he would embark on an affair and manipulate Maria Sutherland (Samia Smith). Bill Ward \\"shocked\\" Coronation Street producers by deciding to leave the serial a few months into his then-current contract, since they had \\"expected him to stay on after giving him another top storyline\\". The producers claimed that Bill was \\"an asset to the show\\", and that they \\"would have been developing further storylines for the character.\\" Reception In 2005, actor Bill Ward claimed that people approached him regarding the abuse his character gave to Shelley Unwin (Sally Lindsay). He said that \\"every now and then, after a couple of beers, somebody will come up and say 'She deserves it, doesn't she?'\\", and that \\"they think Charlie is a hero and that it's all legitimate and acceptable behaviour, which it isn't.\\" He also revealed that he \\"had to be more wary\\" about where he went since his character started his \\"reign of terror\\", and that he’d had notes left on his car, which he found \\"worrying and unnerving\\". Despite claiming some people condoned his behaviour, he also said that some people told him to \\"be nicer to that Shelley\\". Bill thought that his character was \\"a shocking man who behaves abysmally\\", but that as an actor he had to \\"justify everything he does\\". Grace Dent, an editor of The Guardian, described the character of Charlie as \\"a brilliant soap baddie\\", as a \\"philanderer and a mysoginist [sic]\\", and a \\"violent bully and a relentless liar.\\" She opined that Charlie \\"ended almost every scene with a solitary moment spent smirking to himself about his latest huge fib\\", and that \\"by the time Charlie died, he was having so many smirks behind so many backs he spent many scenes pulling a face like he had a raspberry pip stuck in his dentures.\\" Charlie has also been described as \\"a bona fide Coronation Street villain\\" and as \\"Greater Manchester's very own JR Ewing\\". The character has been opined to be \\"arguably the most graphic soap death\\". The episode which featured the character's murder was listed as the second-most watched for any programme on TV in 2007, having been watched by 13.1 million viewers. Bill Ward received the \\"Best Exit\\" award in British Soap Awards 2007 for his role in the character of Charlie. The same year, the storyline which saw Charlie murdered by Tracy Barlow received the \\"Best Storyline\\" award. He was also nominated for the Inside Soap \\"Best Bad Boy\\" award.

Following a muted response to his previous album, A New Day at Midnight, the album was seen by some as a return to the form that brought Gray international acclaim with White Ladder; it was also the last album recorded with longtime collaborator Craig McClune. Gray cited Sigur Rós, Sparklehorse, Lucinda Williams, Björk and Mercury Rev as inspirations for the album. The album was also Gray's first to use a cello player. The original choice to produce the album was Daniel Lanois, but he was booked, so Gray ended up using Marius de Vries, who'd produced Gray's hit single \\"Sail Away.\\" The three singles from the album were \\"The One I Love,\\" \\"Hospital Food,\\" and \\"Alibi.\\" The album was also released on DualDisc format, which included a documentary of the making of the album, a photo gallery, and complete lyrics on the DVD side of the disc. The non-DualDisc CD of the album was one of many titles released with the infamous MediaMax CD-3 copyright protection system.

Staircase Falls in Yosemite National Park only flows after heavy rainfall or snowmelt. Home Reef has repeatedly breached the surface and been subsequently eroded by wave action. Badwater within Death Valley National Park during the unusually wet winter and spring of 2005 Ephemerality (from the Greek word , , meaning 'lasting only one day'Ephemeros, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, \\"A Greek-English Lexicon\\", at Perseus) is the concept of things being transitory, existing only briefly. Typically the term ephemeral is used to describe objects found in nature, although it can describe a wide range of things, including human artifacts intentionally made to last for only a temporary period, in order to increase their perceived aesthetic value. With respect to unique performances, for example, it has been noted that \\"[e]phemerality is a quality caused by the ebb and flow of the crowd's concentration on the performance and a reflection of the nostalgic character of specific performances\\".Will Straw, Alexandra Boutros, Circulation and the City: Essays on Urban Culture (2010), p. 148. Because different people may value the passage of time differently, \\"the concept of ephemerality is a relative one\\".Ronald Beiner, Political Philosophy: What It Is and Why It Matters (2014), p. 10. Natural examplesGeographical features= An ephemeral waterbody is a wetland, spring, stream, river, pond or lake that only exists for a short period following precipitation or snowmelt. They are not the same as intermittent or seasonal waterbodies, which exist for longer periods, but not all year round. Examples of ephemeral streams are the Luni river in Rajasthan, India, Ugab River in Southern Africa, and a number of small ephemeral watercourses that drain Talak in northern Niger. Other notable ephemeral rivers include the Todd River and Sandover River in Central Australia as well as the Son River, Batha River and the Trabancos River. Any endorheic basin, or closed basin, that contains a playa (dry lake) at its drainage lowpoint can become an ephemeral lake. Examples include Lake Carnegie in Western Australia, Lake Cowal in New South Wales, Mystic Lake and Rogers Lake in California, and Sevier Lake in Utah. Even the driest and lowest place in North America, Death Valley (more specifically Badwater Basin), became flooded with a short-lived ephemeral lake in the spring of 2005.\\"Death Valley Alive With Wildflowers\\", MSNBC (March 14, 2005). There are also ephemeral islands such as Banua Wuhu and Home Reef. These islands appear when volcanic activity increases their height above sea level, but disappear over several years due to wave erosion. Bassas da India, on the other hand, is a near-sea level island that appears only at low tide. =Biological processes= Many plants are adapted to an ephemeral lifestyle, in which they spend most of the year or longer as seeds before conditions are right for a brief period of growth and reproduction. The spring ephemeral plant mouse-ear cress is a well-known example. Animals can be ephemeral, with brine shrimp and the mayfly being examples. The placenta is considered an ephemeral organ present during gestation and pregnancy. Ephemeral artifacts Ephemeral can also be used as an adjective to refer to a fast- deteriorating importance or temporary nature of an object to a person. Brands are notoriously ephemeral assets, and magazine publishing was once much more ephemeral than it is today, as was television programming. A film made by a particular sponsor for a specific purpose other than as a work of art may be called an ephemeral film, because the film itself can continue to exist after the social or commercial context for its creation has disappeared. A number of art forms can be considered ephemeral because of their temporary nature. Early land art and all sand sculptures, ice sculptures and chalk drawings on footpaths are examples of ephemeral art. G. Augustine Lynas and Duthain Dealbh create ephemeral sculptures. In addition, temporary wall drawing artists such as Linn Meyers create ephemeral art within museums and galleries. During the Baroque period, wealthy patrons would commission ephemeral creations from well-known artists of the time. These creations, often very expensive and time-consuming, were typically only used during one event before being dismantled or destroyed. One such work was the temporary volcano, created by Gianlorenzo Bernini for the Barberini family. The volcano, placed on the predecessor to the Spanish Steps, took three months to create and was destroyed in a firework display over the course of an hour.

Recurring Voyager characters Seska and Lt. Carey star, along with the show's main cast, in an episode that sees the return of the Kazon aliens previously introduced in \\"Caretaker\\". Plot The crew of Voyager are foraging for food on a planet, when the ship detects a cloaked Kazon vessel and they are ordered to return. Chakotay is left behind to search for Seska. As soon as he finds her, he is fired on by two Kazons, who are stunned by return phaser fire, allowing Chakotay and Seska to escape. Back on Voyager, Seska serves Chakotay mushroom soup and tells him that she and other Maquis raided Neelix's kitchen to make the soup. Chakotay is furious and threatens harsh disciplinary measures. Seska, having once been romantically involved with Chakotay, attempts to placate him, but Chakotay rebuffs her and leaves. Moments later, Voyager detects a distress call from a Kazon ship. On investigation, they discover that a piece of equipment on the Kazon ship has caused a catastrophic failure on board, killing all but one of the crew, who is comatose. Because the equipment bears similarities to Starfleet technology, the crew realize that the technology Kazon must have obtained it from someone on Voyager, and Seska falls under suspicion. Seska takes matters into her own hands and beams over to the Kazon ship, explaining that she must retrieve the equipment to prove her innocence. While on the ship, Seska is injured and is reprimanded by her superiors when she returns. Captain Janeway realizes that the comatose Kazon might be the only chance of finding out how the technology came into the Kazon's possession. Another Kazon ship arrives, whose captain, Culluh, demands to see his comrade. Culluh and his bodyguard arrive in sickbay where the Doctor is treating their compatriot. Suddenly, Culluh's bodyguard kills the patient. Disgusted, Janeway orders both Kazons off Voyager. Kes finds Seska has Cardassian blood, which Seska claims was the result of a bone marrow transplant from a friendly Cardassian woman. Investigations reveal that a message was sent to the Kazon from Engineering, and from the time of the message the two most likely suspects are Seska and Lt. Carey. The senior crew set a trap to identify the traitor, and Seska falls for it.

He became the leading theologian of the Reformed Protestant movement of the Palatinate, serving both at the University of Heidelberg and the College of Wisdom (Collegium Sapientiae). He is best known as the principal author and interpreter of the Heidelberg Catechism.Fred H. Klooster, \\"The Priority of Ursinus in the Composition of the Heidelberg Catechism,\\" Controversy and Conciliation: The Reformation of the Palatinate 1559-1583, ed. Derk Visser (Allison Park, Penn.: Pickwick, 1986), 73-100. Origins and early education At age fifteen he enrolled at the University of Wittenberg, boarding for the next seven years with Philipp Melanchthon, the erudite successor of Martin Luther. Like many young scholars of that era he gave himself a Latin name, in his case one that was based on his German name, Baer, stemming from Latin ursus, meaning bear. Melanchthon admired young Ursinus for his intellectual gifts and his spiritual maturity, commending him to mentors throughout Europe. He was a lifelong protégé of the prominent imperial physician Johannes Crato von Krafftheim, who likewise hailed from Wrocław. Subsequently, Ursinus studied under Reformation scholars at Strasbourg, Basel, Lausanne, and Geneva. Sojourns in Lyon and Orléans gave him expertise in Hebrew, as well as studying under Jean Mercier in Paris. Returning to Wrocław he published a pamphlet on the sacraments, which aroused the ire of Lutherans who charged him with being more Reformed than Lutheran. The Wrocław opponents’ vitriolic reaction succeeded in driving him out of the city to Zürich, where he became friends with Zwingli's successor Heinrich Bullinger and the Italian Reformer Peter Martyr Vermigli. In Heidelberg and Neustadt In 1561, upon Vermigli's recommendation, Frederick III, Elector Palatine, appointed him professor in the Collegium Sapientiae at Heidelberg, where in 1562/63, having been commissioned by the Prince elector, he supplied the preliminary drafts for the Heidelberg Catechism and participated in the final revision of the document alongside other theologians and church leaders. Caspar Olevianus (1536–1587) was formerly asserted as a co-author of the document, though this theory has been largely discarded by modern scholarship. Lyle Bierma, \\"The Purpose and Authorship of the Heidelberg Catechism,\\" in An Introduction to the Heidelberg Catechism: Sources, History, and Theology (Grand Rapids: Baker, 2005), 67. The death of the Elector Frederick and the accession of the Lutheran Ludwig IV in 1576, led to the removal of Ursinus, who occupied a professorial chair at the Casmirianum a Reformed academy at Neustadt an der Weinstraße from 1578 until his death. He died, aged 48, in Neustadt an der Weinstraße. Impact His Works were published in 1587-1589, and a more complete edition by his son and two of his pupils, David Pareus and Quirinius Reuter, in 1612. Ursinus's collected catechical lectures (Het Schatboeck der verclaringhen over de Catechismus) was one of the most prominent theological handbooks among seventeenth century Reformed Christians and was especially popular in the Netherlands. Reformed German and Dutch immigrants to North America celebrated his legacy—especially his role in the creation of the Heidelberg Catechism. Ursinus College in Collegeville, Pennsylvania, is a liberal arts college founded in 1869 in his name. ReferencesExternal links Biography *  Further reading   Dirk Visser.

It is written using Moose, a modern object system for Perl. Its design is heavily inspired by such frameworks as Ruby on Rails, Maypole, and Spring. A web application developer would use Catalyst to deal with code common to all web applications: it provides interfaces to web servers and receiving page requests, dispatching these into developer-written code to process and return the requests, and provides a standardised interface for data models, authentication, session management and other common web application elements. All of these elements are implemented as plugins to a set of common interfaces, allowing the developer to change the specific method used (e.g. a session storing in shared memory versus as a database table, or using FastCGI versus operating as an within Apache's mod_perl) by changing the configuration of Catalyst to use a different plugin without altering the application code. Catalyst is primarily distributed through the CPAN, which is the official distribution channel for Perl libraries and applications.  History  Maypole was one of the first web application frameworks for the Perl programming language that was based on the MVC pattern; its principal author was Simon Cozens. Catalyst started as a fork of Maypole, intended to become Maypole 3.0. Development ceased on Maypole, however, with its most recent release in April 2008, and Catalyst became its modern supported equivalent. The first development release of Catalyst took place on 28 January 2005. The first official version was placed in CPAN on 16 February 2005. As of June 2011, Catalyst had 201 registered contributors.  Philosophy  Catalyst is based on a \\"don't repeat yourself\\" (DRY) principle, which means that definitions should only have to be made once. Catalyst can be used with automatic class loading from the database through one of the many loader modules, thus requiring no code for the database layer. But, if you require the flexibility of manually doing everything, it's also an option. Another guiding principle of Catalyst is flexibility. Catalyst promotes the re-use of existing Perl modules that already handle common web application concerns well. * The Model part is handled through DBIx::Class, Plucene, Net::LDAP and other model classes. * The View layer is usually handled by Template Toolkit, Mason, or HTML::Template, among others. * The Controller layer is of course written by each application author. Large chunks of Controller functionality can usually be deferred to one of the many Catalyst plugins (e.g., Catalyst::Plugin::FormValidator, Catalyst::Plugin::Prototype, Catalyst::Plugin::Account::AutoDiscovery, etc.). * Finally, Catalyst offers a set of helpers to simplify flow control and mapping URLs to controller methods. Catalyst has a large selection of plugins. For example, it has JavaScript generation for Ajax and RIAs using the Catalyst::Plugin::Prototype module (prototype is an Ajax framework). Plugins cover many areas, for example authentication, session management, HTTP negotiation and REST. Catalyst can also be used with other Ajax frameworks such as jQuery or YUI, the Yahoo! User Interface Library.  Web server support  For development and testing, Catalyst has a built-in simple HTTP server. For production use, Apache, lighttpd, Hiawatha, Cherokee or Nginx with FastCGI or mod_perl support is recommended, but any web server with CGI or FastCGI support will work. On Apache, mod_perl can help with performance considerably, though its use might be an issue because it can be unsafe to share multiple applications under mod_perl. Since early 2008, Catalyst applications can also be deployed using the HTTP::Prefork engine which provides for the deployment of high performance Catalyst applications without a separate web server. Starting with the release of Catalyst 5.9, Catalyst also outputs to the PSGI spec thus it can be run on any Plack server and along with any server or protocol that supports the PSGI spec, including Mongrel2.  Database support  Catalyst can run using any database supported by Perl's DBI (this means almost anything, even a CSV file), but a proper RDBMS or ODBMS is recommended. The database access is entirely abstracted from the programmer's point of view and Catalyst, through one of its model classes, handles access to all databases automatically – though, if needed, using direct SQL queries is possible. This enables database-neutrality, application portability over different database systems, and usability of pre-existing databases for Catalyst application development as much as possible, though due to different feature sets of the RDBMSes, it is not completely guaranteed by the framework alone. Several different RDBMS systems are supported, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, IBM DB2, Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server. For ODBMSes, there is explicit support for KiokuDB via Catalyst::Model::KiokuDB. The Model abstraction allows databases of any nature to be accessed via Catalyst::Model::Adaptor. Many Catalyst-based projects use DBIx::Class as the ORM layer, which provides further abstraction of SQL queries, using a resultset-based API with transparent support for arbitrary joins and other features.  Uses  Websites powered by Catalyst include Magazines.com, bbc.co.uk iPlayer backend, DuckDuckGo's Community Platform, http://flexibase.io and Tripwolf.com. The MojoMojo wiki engine is written using Catalyst. YouPorn was powered by Catalyst until 2012.

Old\\". The film is about Kurt Menliff (Christopher Lee) who is ostracized by his father for his relationship with a servant girl and her eventual suicide. He later returns to reclaim his title and his former fiancée Nevenka (Daliah Lavi) who is now his brother's wife. Menliff is later found murdered, but the locals believe his ghost has returned to haunt the castle for revenge. Italian censors removed the film from cinemas due to its sadomasochistic themes. The international cut features some significant changes, and runs for 77 minutes. It was released theatrically as What! and Night Is the Phantom in the United States and United Kingdom, respectively.  Plot  An isolated castle on the Eastern European coast. Kurt (Christopher Lee), the older son of Count Menliff (Gustavo De Nardo), was in marriage preparations with Nevenka (Daliah Lavi). However, Kurt had an affair with Tania, the daughter of Menliffs' servant Giorgia (Harriet Medin), and Tania committed suicide because of Kurt's prospective marriage. Count Menliff rejected Kurt and he left the castle. Meanwhile, Nevenka married Cristiano (Tony Kendall), Kurt's younger brother. One day, Kurt arrives at the castle, superficially to celebrate Cristiano and Nevenka but in fact he is to reclaim his title and fortune, which supposedly also includes Nevenka. During an evening on the beach and following a session of flogging and sex, masochistic Nevenka understands that she is still in love with Kurt. Frustrated, she does not return to the castle and is eventually found unconscious by the butler Losat (Luciano Pigozzi). On the same night, Kurt is killed under curious circumstances, with the same dagger Tania had committed suicide with. Now, Kurt is dead but a series of events hints that his ghost has started to haunt the castle for revenge.  Cast  * Daliah Lavi as Nevenka Menliff * Christopher Lee as Kurt Menliff * Tony Kendall as Christian Menliff * Ida Galli (as Isil Oberon) as Katia * Harriet Medin (as Harriet White) as Giorgia * Gustavo De Nardo (as Dean Ardow) as Count Menliff * Luciano Pigozzi (as Alan Collins) as Losat * Jacques Herlin as the Priest Sources:  Production  The credited writers are Ernesto Gastaldi (as Julian Berry), Ugo Guerra (as Robert Hugo) and Luciano Martino (as Martin Hardy). Ernesto Gastaldi has stated that he had written the script himself with Ugo Guerra possibly contributing to some of the story early on, whilst Luciano Martino had no contribution to the script. Gastaldi was shown an Italian print of The Pit and the Pendulum (1961) by the producers who requested a similar film to be made. Gastaldi is credited as an assistant director in the film's credits, but has stated he was never even on the set of the film. Mario Bava was brought in to direct the film through Ugo Guerra's suggestion as he could both direct the film and photograph the film. Bava took care of the cinematography for the film while his regular camera man Ubaldo Terzano is credited as the cinematographer. The film was shot for under ₤159 million Italian lire for six week shooting schedule with one more week for special effects. The film was shot in both Anzio and Castel Sant'Angelo in Rome.  Release  The film's sadomasochistic theme caused trouble with censors in Italy. The board of censors demanded no cuts to the film, but gave it a V.M. 18 rating meaning that it was forbidden to minors. This was appealed by the production companies for the film who cut parts of the film on their own and later earned a V.M. 14 rating. The Whip and the Body was released in Italy on 29 August 1963 through Titanus. The film was seized on 12 October 1963, with charges of obscenity. The film was declared that it contained \\"several sequences that refer to degenerations and anomalies of sexual life.\\" The film was then later re-released in January 1964. The law court of Rome ordered the confiscation of several scenes that were described as \\"contrary to morality\\". The film poster was to be destroyed and condemned the chief press officer at Titanus to three months on probation. The film grossed a total of 72 million Italian lire. The Whip and the Body received a release in France under the title Le Corps et le fouet on 26 January 1966. A 77-minute version titled What! was released in the United States in 1965. This version was dubbed in English with none of the actors dubbing their own voices. The 77 minute version was nearly identical to the British edit of the film released under the title Night is the Phantom. Both the American and English versions of the films were heavily edited, in particular having all the whipping scenes removed, causing the film to be incomprehensible. =Home video= A Region 1 DVD of The Whip and the Body was released by VCI on 31 October 2000 with an 88-minute running time. The DVD was sourced from a 35mm print of the film. The disc included an audio commentary with Tim Lucas, isolated soundtrack, photo gallery, cast and crew biographies and filmographies. A Blu-ray of the film was released by Kino on December 17, 2013. The Blu-ray contained a Tim Lucas audio commentary and theatrical trailers.  Reception  In contemporary reviews, The Monthly Film Bulletin reviewed the 77-minutes English-dubbed version titled Night is the Phantom in 1965. The review referred to the film as \\"slow, repetitive, verging on parody\\" and that either \\"censor or distributor cuts have rendered much of the plot incomprehensible, thought one doubts if it ever made sense entirely.\\" The review compared the film to other genre films of the era, calling it \\"another of Italy's prankish simulations of British horror movie\\" as well as stating that \\"Mario Bava copies [Riccardo] Freda almost slavishly\\" but \\"still pulls off some arresting pictorial compositions\\". \\"Hogg.\\" of Variety noted that \\"for sophisitcated audiences, the gothic-novel atmosphere and trappings of secret passages, muddy footprints from the crypt and ghost lover, probably will draw more laughs than gasps. But genuine suspense is maintained throughout.\\" The review commented on the technical elements of the film, stating \\"superb\\" cinematography but that the script had \\"many preposterous lines, and is far to cluttered with cliches such as screams in the night, hurried chases and mystery lights in the crypt.\\" In 1970, screenwriter Ernesto Gastaldi stated that the film disappointed him. Gastaldi described that he felt about the story “in terms of a psychological nightmare, in the style of Clouzot's films, but Bava saw in it a baroque and decadent drama, and emphasized such tones beyond belief.” From retrospective reviews, Slant Magazine gave the film four and a half stars out of five, stating that the film found \\"Bava at the peak of his visual prowess\\" Online film database AllMovie found that Bava's \\"exceptional visual style helps to lift an otherwise gloomy picture\\". The review noted that the film contained a \\"strong, witty script and one of the finest casts the Italian director ever worked with\\" resulting in \\"a solid horror film that works on multiple levels.\\" See also * Christopher Lee filmography * List of French films of 1963 * List of horror films of 1963 * List of Italian films of 1963  References FootnotesSources=   External links  * Category:Films directed by Mario Bava Category:Films scored by Carlo Rustichelli Category:1963 films Category:Italian horror films Category:French horror films Category:Italian- language films Category:1963 horror films Category:Titanus films Category:Gothic horror films Category:Italian films Category:French films Category:BDSM in films Category:Films set in the 19th century Category:Films shot in Rome Category:Films with screenplays by Ernesto Gastaldi ","title":"The Whip and the Body"},{"id":"2483125","text":"Bernard Cohen may refer to: * Bernard Cohen (physicist) (1924–2012), American physicist at the University of Pittsburgh * I.

At room temperature the solid is stable to air, although it does have a high vapor pressure and sublimes readily. Cr(CO)6 is zerovalent, meaning that Cr has an oxidation state of zero, and it is a homoleptic complex, which means that all the ligands are identical. The complex is octahedral with Cr–C and C–O distances of 1.91 and 1.14 Å, respectively. Reactions When heated or UV-irradiated in tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution, Cr(CO)6 converts to Cr(CO)5(THF) with loss of one CO ligand. Similarly, heating a solution of Cr(CO)6 in an aromatic solvent results in replacement of three CO ligands: :Cr(CO)6 \\\\+ C6H5R → Cr(CO)3(C6H5R) + 3 CO UV- irradiation of frozen solutions of chromium hexacarbonyl affords a variety of labile adducts. Such reactions proceed well with electron-rich arenes such as anisole. The products adopt a \\"piano-stool\\" structure. These species are typically yellow solids. Alkyl and aryl organolithium reagents (RLi) add to a carbonyl ligand to give anionic acyl complexes. These species in turn react with alkylating agents such as Me3O+ to form (OC)5Cr=C(OMe)R, Treatment of chromium hexacarbonyl with sodium cyclopentadienide gives NaCr(CO)3(C5H5). Oxidation of this salt affords cyclopentadienylchromium tricarbonyl dimer (Cp2Cr2(CO)6). This complex is distinctive because it exists in measureable equilibrium with the monometallic Cr(I) radical CpCr(CO)3. Safety In common with many of the other homoleptic metal carbonyls (e.g. nickel carbonyl and iron carbonyl), chromium hexacarbonyl is toxic and thought to be carcinogenic. Its vapor pressure is relatively high for a metal complex, at 36 °C).

The term uses the \\"homo-\\" prefix to indicate that something is the same for all. Some compounds with names that suggest that they are homoleptic are in fact heteroleptic, because they have ligands in them which are not featured in the name. For instance dialkyl magnesium complexes which are found in the equilibrium which exists in a solution of a Grignard reagent in an ether, have two ether ligands attached to each magnesium centre. Another example is a solution of trimethyl aluminium in an ether solvent (such as THF), similar chemistry should be expected for a triaryl or trialkyl borane. Any metal species which has more than one type of ligand is heteroleptic. It is possible for some ligands such as DMSO to bind with two or more different coordination modes. It would still be reasonable to consider a complex which has only one type of ligand but with different coordination modes to be homoleptic. For the complex dichlorotetrakis(dimethyl sulfoxide)ruthenium(II), DMSO coordinates via both sulfur and oxygen atoms.

It lies in the parish of Rosskeen. History The town is well known for the Invergordon Mutiny of 1931. More recently it has also become known for the repair of oil rigs which line up in the Cromarty Firth on which the town is situated. In the 1970s and 1980s nearby Nigg was known for the construction of these rigs. The yard used for this is now attempting to re-establish itself as a fabricator of large offshore wind turbines and oil rig refurbishment since being purchased by Global Energy Group. For a number of years Invergordon was the site of an aluminium smelter until 1981 when British Aluminium closed it down. The pipeline that covered the conveyor belt from the smelter to the BA pier was not dismantled until the early 2000s and the two large tanks still stand today as well as a water tower. It still has a grain whisky distillery, operated by Philippines-owned whisky giant Whyte and Mackay, the output of which contributes to many blended whiskies. Connected to the distillery was the Invergordon Distillery Pipe Band. At present the port is visited by many large cruise liners each year, as the deep water port allows disembarkation for coach tours in the northern Highlands. Since the 1970s some would perceive the town as a 'Glasgow colony', since many workers were recruited from southern Scotland to work in the oil rig fabrication and aluminium smelting industries. As a result, the residents' accents often show more influence from Glasgow, than the surrounding Easter Ross dialect of Highland English although this has changed in recent years. In recent years Global Energy Group have been expanding, with the purchase of the Nigg fabrication yard it has also brought much appreciated work to Invergordon's Docks with the town again full of oil company workers through the day. Naval Base A naval base in the early 20th century, evidence of which remains in the tank farm lying behind the town centre, the port used to contain fuel oil and water supplies for Admiralty ships, and the Admiralty Pier, where once warships docked and which is now used for cruise ships in the summer and oil- field support vessels through the year (see Inchindown oil tanks). One German bomb hit one of the tanks during the Second World War when a large flying boat base occupied much of the northerly coast of the Cromarty Firth, the result of this being that the fuel oil flowed onto the railway tracks. According to town history the bomb did not explode. On 27–28 May 1957 the Royal Navy held a fleet review in the waters off the town. The port renewed its military connections in the summer of 2017, when it was visited by the new aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth during her sea trials. Culture Invergordon is now the premier mural town of the Highlands and hopes to emulate the success of her mentor in Chemainus, British Columbia. Currently the town is adorned with a series of 17 murals. The paintwork created by a selection of artists tells the stories of the local community and the area. This trail is a result of a community project which was initially designed to integrate local community groups (17 in total took part). The trail, which was opened by the Princess Royal, now acts as a major tourist draw. Infrastructure Panorama of Invergordon The town is served by Invergordon railway station which lies on the Far North Line, and is in close proximity to the A9 trunk road. As of 2012, there is a controversial scheme for a waste incinerator at the Cromarty Firth Industrial Park in Invergordon, which the Scottish government are now reviewing following protests by the local community. The £43 million plant would be built by Combined Power and Heat (Highlands) Ltd.Scotsman article by Frank Urquart, 1 December 2012 Education Invergordon has one secondary school, Invergordon Academy, which is fed by four primary schools, Newmore Primary School, Park Primary School, South Lodge Primary School and Milton Primary School. In 2013 the Highland Council announced plans for a new \\"super school\\" to serve Ross-shire with the preferred option being that it be built in Invergordon. This has seen much protest by locals and is currently under review. If it went ahead Alness and Tain academies would close and there would also be a change to the local primary schools.

Geography The park has an area of about 187 ha, of which 74 ha is the lake. Initially, the area was full of marshes, but these were drained between 1930 and 1935, and the park was opened in 1936. The park is divided into two zones: a rustic or natural zone (the Village Museum), which is left more or less undisturbed, and a public/'active' domain with open areas for recreation activities. Small boats are allowed on the lake. Name The park was initially intended to be called National Park (Parcul Național), but it was renamed Parcul Carol II during the period of the Carol II of Romania's cult of personality. Following World War II, it was renamed Parcul I. V. Stalin, featuring a statue of Stalin at its entrance. In 1956, during the de-Stalinization period, Stalin's statue was torn down and the name of the park was changed to \\"Herăstrău\\". The name Herăstrău referred to the Herăstrău lake, and has its origin in a dialectal version of the word ferăstrău in standard Romanian, meaning saw or sawmill, referring to the water-powered sawmills that were once found on the Colentina river which flowed through it. On 19 December 2017, by a decision of the Bucharest General Council, the park was renamed to \\"King Michael I Park\\" to honor the former King of Romania after Michael I had died on 5 December 2017. History The area of the park has been inhabited since the Paleolithic, traces of settlements being found at the Herăstrău sand quarry,Giurescu, p.25 including flint tools made by the Mousterian culture,Georgescu et al., p. 21-22 a culture generally associated with the Neanderthals. During the quaternary glaciation, the area was inhabited by large mammals such as the woolly rhinoceros and the mammoth, bones of the latter being found in the Herăstrău sand quarry.Giurescu, p.26 During the Iron Age, a settlement of the first part of the Hallstatt era belonging to a pastoral population was located in Bordei-Herăstrău (the area between Herăstrău and Floreasca lakes, today part of the Herăstrău ParkGeorgescu et al., p. 37), which gives the name of the culture (Bordei- Herăstrău culture). In the Dacian settlements of Herăstrău, which has been dated, with the help of the coins, to the 1st century BC,Georgescu et al., p. 44 archeologists found a treasure containing silver fibulae, silver spiral bracelets, a silver bowl, as well as Ancient Greek coins (from Tomis and Dyrrachium) along with Dacian imitations.Giurescu, p.33 Prince of Wallachia Alexander Ypsilantis built an Ottoman-style pavilion on the banks of the Herăstrău Lake.Giurescu, p.104 The plain along the lake was used in 1831, during the Russian occupation, for military exercises by a joint force of the Wallachian and Russian militaries.Giurescu, p.124 By the mid-19th century, Herăstrău was the main promenade area used by the Romanian élite for walks.Georgescu et al., p. 298 In 1936, the work began for the creation of the National Park (Parcul Național) in Herăstrău. For this, several dozen squalid houses, as well as an industrial plant were expropriated and torn down, being replaced with alleys and trees, being finally open for the public in May 1939, becoming Bucharest's largest park.Giurescu, p.199 Buildings and facilities Elisabeta Palace, the current residence of the Romanian Royal Family, is located in the park, as an \\"island\\" inside the Village Museum, near Arcul de Triumf. The Dimitrie Gusti National Village Museum, an open-air museum showcasing traditional life of the Romanian peasant and having hundreds of houses from across Romania, is also one of the main attractions in the park. Scattered across the park are an open-air theatre, a yacht club, a sports club, the Herăstrău Hotel and, adjunct to the park, the Diplomatic Club, featuring a golf course. There is also Berăria H, the largest beer hall in southeastern Europe (formerly Pavilion H, a Soviet-style building); its capacity is of 2,000 places inside and 1,000 on an outside terace.

The suit is stuffed with straw, giving the Gille a hunched back. The Gilles also wear wooden clogs and have bells attached to their belts. In the morning, they wear a mask of a particular design. After reaching the town hall, they remove these masks—they are not worn in the afternoon.

It opened on 2 December 2005. It was first located on what was initially King George V branch, and was, until the extension to Woolwich Arsenal was completed, the reason for this branch. It continues to be an important station on the DLR. Trains run westbound to Bank in the City of London, northbound to Stratford International and eastbound to Woolwich Arsenal. The station is in the London Borough of Newham and is located in Travelcard Zone 3. History Prior to December 2005, Docklands Light Railway trains would arrive at Canning Town and would only be able to continue in a southeasterly direction towards Royal Victoria. In December 2005, however, the new King George V branch was opened. Before the station was built the land was home to Drew Primary School; the school was over 100 years old and consisted of three floors with classrooms also on the roof. The new Drew Primary can be found just down the road.London City Airport Consultative Committee – DLR Extension Design The station (like many Docklands Light Railway stations) is elevated. It is also fully enclosed. There are two entrances to the station and the platforms are connected by escalators and lifts to an intermediate level with a direct link into the airport concourse. Main access to the station for local passengers and mobility impaired customers is by a lower level subway. It has a direct covered connection with the adjacent airport terminal building. Although the station maintains the DLR philosophy of design, it makes concessions to cater for airport passengers, including a fully enclosed waiting room on the central island platform and, unusually for the DLR, a manned ticket office. There is a crossover west of the station which allows trains from Poplar and Woolwich Arsenal to reverse here during periods of disruption. Location The station is situated to the west side of London City Airport in Silvertown. Services Trains run westbound about every 10 minutes to Bank in the City of London and every 10 minutes to Stratford International, adjacent to the Olympic Park. Journey time is 7 minutes to Canning Town to interchange with the Beckton branch of the DLR and with the Jubilee line; 12 minutes to Poplar to interchange with the Stratford and Lewisham branches of the DLR; and 22 minutes to Bank in the City of London. Trains run eastbound every 10 minutes to Woolwich Arsenal. The journey time is 6 minutes to the terminus. In peak hours, the frequency increases to one train every eight minutes on both the Bank–Woolwich Arsenal and Stratford–Woolwich Arsenal lines, providing a service every four minutes between Canning Town and Woolwich Arsenal.

It was Bava's official directorial debut, although he had completed several previous feature films without receiving an onscreen credit. Based very loosely on Nikolai Gogol's short story \\"Viy\\", the narrative concerns a witch who is put to death by her own brother, only to return 200 years later to seek revenge on her descendants. By the social standards of the 1960s, Black Sunday was considered unusually gruesome, and was banned in the UK until 1968 because of its violence. In the US, some of the gore was censored in- house by distributor American International Pictures before its theatrical release to the country's cinemas, where it was shown as a double feature with Roger Corman's The Little Shop of Horrors. Black Sunday was a worldwide critical and box office success, and launched the careers of Bava and Steele. In 2004, one of its sequences was voted number 40 among the \\"100 Scariest Movie Moments\\" by the Bravo TV network.  Plot  In 1630 Moldavia, Asa Vajda, a witch, and her paramour, Javutich, are sentenced to death for sorcery by Asa's brother. Asa vows revenge and puts a curse on her brother's descendants. Metal masks with sharp spikes on the inside are placed over Asa and Javutich's faces and hammered into their flesh, but a sudden storm prevents the villagers from burning them at the stake. Two centuries later, Dr. Choma Kruvajan and his assistant, Dr. Andrej Gorobec, are traveling through Moldavia en route to a medical conference when one of the wheels of their carriage is broken. While waiting for their coachman to fix it, the two wander into a nearby ancient crypt and discover Asa's tomb. Observing her death mask through a glass panel, Kruvajan breaks the panel (and the cross above it) by accident while striking a bat. He then removes Asa's death mask, revealing a partially preserved corpse. He cuts his hand on the broken glass. Some of his blood drips onto Asa. Returning outside, Kruvajan and Gorobec meet Katia Vajda. She tells them that she lives with her father and brother Constantine in a nearby castle that the villagers believe is haunted. Struck by her haunting beauty and sadness, Gorobec becomes smitten with Katia. The two men leave her and drive to an inn. Meanwhile Asa is brought back to life by Kruvajan's blood. She contacts Javutich telepathically. He rises from his grave and goes to Prince Vajda's castle, where Vajda holds up a crucifix to ward the reanimated corpse away. However, Vajda is so terrified by the visit that he becomes paralyzed with fear. Constantine sends a servant to fetch Dr. Kruvajan, but the servant is killed before he can reach the inn. Javutich brings Kruvajan to the castle under the pretext that his services are needed. Javutich leads Kruvajan to Asa's crypt. The witch hypnotizes Kruvajan and says she needs the rest of his blood. Asa then kisses him, turning him into her servant. By Asa's command, Kruvajan follows up on the request to tend to Vajda. He orders the crucifix removed from the room, ostensibly so it won't upset Vajda; this allows Javutich to return later and murder him. Asa's plan is to revive herself by draining Katia of her life, since Katia is physically Asa reincarnated. Puzzled to hear that Kruvajan abandoned his patient shortly before he died, Gorobec questions a little girl who saw Javutich take Kruvajan to the castle. She identifies Kruvajan's escort with a painting of Javutich. A priest and Gorobec go to Javutich's grave and find Kruvajan's body inside the coffin. Realizing he is now one of the undead, they kill him by ramming a small piece of wood through one of his eye sockets. Javutich throws Constantine into a death pit and takes Katia to Asa. Asa drains Katia of her youth. When the witch goes to take her blood, she is thwarted by the crucifix around Katia's neck. Gorobec enters the crypt to save Katia but is attacked by Javutich, who pushes him to the edge of the death pit. Constantine uses the last of his strength to pull Javutich into the pit and push Gorobec to safety. Gorobec finds Asa and Katia. Asa pretends to be Katia and tells Gorobec that Katia is the witch. He accordingly goes to kill Katia but notices the crucifix she is wearing has no effect on her. He turns to Asa and opens her robe, revealing a fleshless skeletal frame. The priest then arrives with numerous torch-carrying villagers, and they burn Asa to death. Katia awakens from her stupor, her life and beauty restored, and is reunited with Gorobec.

Bava, who had been that film's cinematographer, completed the film quickly and efficiently. This was not the first time Bava had been able to save a troubled movie for Marathon's production company, Galatea Film. During that same year, Bava had performed a similar salvage job on Caltiki – The Immortal Monster (1959), replacing Riccardo Freda as director after he had abandoned the picture in the middle of production. Even earlier, he had assumed the directorial role for I Vampiri (1957) after the temperamental Freda had also walked off the set of that film after only a few days. Bava did not receive director screen credit for any of his work on the three troubled Galatea films. After Bava completed Marathon, Nello Santi, the head of Galatea Film, subsequently offered him his choice of any property for his first directorial effort.Lucas, Tim Fangoria Magazine, #42, pgs. 20-24, \\"Terror Pioneer\\", article on Bava's career =Writing= As a lover of Ukrainian fantasy and horror, Bava decided to adapt Nikolai Gogol's 1835 horror story \\"Viy\\" into a feature film. However, the resultant screenplay (by Bava, Ennio De Concini and Mario Serandrei) in fact owed very little to Gogol at all, and seemed to be more a tribute to the atmospheric black-and-white gothic horror films of the 1930s, especially those produced by Universal Studios. The script takes only the most rudimentary elements from the story—the Ukrainian settings (Myrhorod) and the idea of a witch coming back to life—and has a completely different narrative. =Casting= For the role of the evil Asa and her innocent descendant Katia, Bava noted: \\"A strange type was needed, and we chose Steele from pictures.\\" Bava reportedly found Steele difficult to work with. According to Bava, the actress \\"was somewhat irrational, afraid of Italians. One day she refused to come to the set, because somebody told her I was using a special film-stock that made people appear naked.\\" Steele recalled: \\"Lord alone knows I was difficult enough. I didn't like my fangs – I had them changed three times. I loathed my wig – I changed that four times. I couldn't understand Italian. I certainly didn't want to allow them to tear open my dress and expose my breasts, so they got a double that I didn't like at all, so I ended up doing it myself – drunk, barely over eighteen, embarrassed and not very easy to be around.\\"McGee, Mark Thomas Faster and Furiouser: The Revised and Fattened Fable of American International Pictures, McFarland & Company, Inc., 1996. =Filming= The production of La Maschera del Demonio began on 28 March 1960 at the studios of Scalera Film. The exteriors, as well as a few interiors, were shot at a rented castle in Arsoli. The final day of production was 7 May.Lucas, Tim Mario Bava All the Colors of the Dark, Video Watchdog, 2007. Steele never saw a complete screenplay for the film. Instead, she was simply handed the scenes she would play, and her dialogue, every morning of the production.Lucas, Tim Black Sunday DVD, Image Entertainment, 1999, audio commentary. ASIN: B00002NDM3 According to Steele, \\"We were given the pages day to day. We had hardly any idea what was going down on that film. We had no idea of the end, or the beginning, either, not at all.\\"Dietrich, Christopher and Beckman, Peter Video Watchdog Magazine, Issue #7 (Sept/Oct 1991) pg. 50, \\"Karma, Catsup and Caskets: The Barbara Steele Interview\\" Both Steele and Dominici were originally fitted to wear sharp vampire fangs, but after only a few days of shooting, the fangs were discarded. The film's Production Manager, Armando Govoni, recalled, \\"[W]hen we saw the rushes, especially in the close- ups, they looked too fake so editor Mario Serandrei cut around them.\\" = Soundtrack = The original Italian score by Roberto Nicolosi was issued by Digitmovies AE in 2005, together with another Nicolosi score for The Girl Who Knew Too Much. A complete version has been released on vinyl for the first time ever by Spikerot Records in 2019, with exclusive liner notes by Lamberto Bava. A suite from Les Baxter's score was originally released on a promotional LP by the composer, whose contents made an authorized CD debut on a 1992 release by Bay Cities. Citadel Records reissued the same material in 1997 and just like the previous release, this CD also contained a suite of music from Baron Blood, another Bava film which also received a new score by Baxter for its American version. Baxter's complete score to Black Sunday was released in 2011 by Kritzerland, whose CD contains the music in chronological order.  Release  The film premiered in Italy on 11 August 1960. In 1961 it was distributed in the US, France, Japan, Mexico, and West Germany. In 1962 it was shown for the first time in Austria and Denmark. The film was then seen in Sweden (1963) and Finland (1964). But it was banned in the UK until June 1968 due to its violent content. =American version = Samuel Z. Arkoff and James H. Nicholson, of American International Pictures, screened the Italian- language version of the film when they were visiting Rome in search of viable, inexpensive European made films to act as second features for their double- bills. They immediately recognized the film as a potential hit and bought the US rights for $100,000, reportedly more than the film's budget. In order to make the film more accessible to American audiences, AIP trimmed over three minutes' worth of violence and \\"objectionable\\" content. Sequences excised or shortened included the burning \\"S\\" branded into Asa's flesh, the blood spewing from the mask after it was hammered into her face, the moist eyeball impalement of Kruvajan, and the flesh peeling off Vajda's face as he burned to death in the fireplace. In the original version of the film, Asa and Javutich were brother and sister; in the AIP version, Javutich (renamed Javuto) became Asa's servant. In addition, some dialogue was \\"softened,\\" including Asa's line, \\"You, too, can find the joy and happiness of Hades!\\" AIP modified it to \\"You, too, can find the joy and happiness of hating!\\" Roberto Nicolosi's musical score was replaced by an effective but more generic \\"horror\\"-sounding one by Les Baxter,Hughes, Howard Cinema Italiano - The Complete Guide From Classics To Cult, pg. 79, I.B.Tauris, 2011. and the dialogue was completely redubbed into English. As the entire cast, with the exception of Checchi and Dominici, had spoken their lines in English, this was a relatively easy task. Galatea had provided AIP with their own English-language version, which had been completed by the Language Dubbers Association in Rome. However, Arkoff and Nicholson felt this version was stilted and \\"technically unacceptable\\", so a newly recorded English version was commissioned and produced by Titra Sound Corporation in New York City. Barbara Steele and John Richardson's voices were not heard in any version. AIP tested several titles for the film, including Witchcraft, The House of Fright, The Curse, Vengeance and Demoniaque, before finally entitling their shortened version Black Sunday. The film premièred in the United States on 15 February 1961; it was presented as the A movie in a double feature that also included Roger Corman's The Little Shop of Horrors. Even in its truncated state, '\\"Black Sunday\\" was considered to contain strong material for its time. In the US, the AIP publicity campaign indicated that the film was suitable only for audiences over 12 (although it is doubtful that this was enforced). In England, with the title '\\"The Mask of Satan,\\" the film was officially banned by government censors until 1968, when a distributor submitted the full version under a new title, Revenge of the Vampire. The British censor made cuts to most of the scenes of violence, and the film was not released uncut in Britain until 1992. Despite being censored, the film still had moments of very graphic (for its time) scenes of horror and violence. With bloody scenes featuring a wooden stake being rammed into a vampire's eyeball (Bava's variation on the more traditional stake through the heart), a metal mask hammered into a beautiful woman's face, and other mayhem—the film was \\"far more graphic in its depiction of murder and death than audiences had previously seen.\\" =Home video= Black Sunday was released on VHS by Image Entertainment unedited on December 14, 1999. This was the first time the European edit of the film was released on home video in the United States.  Reception  La Maschera del Demonio premiered in Rome during August 1960. The film was a modest success, grossing 140 million lire (approximately US $87,000), earning back nearly all of the production cost. It performed much better outside of Italy, and was particularly successful in France and the U.S. Upon its theatrical release in the United States, critics generally responded with enthusiasm to Bava's film, many of whom recognized the director as a potential master of the horror genre. Variety noted, \\"There is sufficient cinematography ingenuity and production flair [...] to keep an audience pleasantly unnerved.\\" Time said the film was \\"a piece of fine Italian handiwork that atones for its ludicrous lapses with brilliant intuitions of the spectral.\\" The Motion Picture Herald stated that \\"A classic quality permeates this gruesome, shocking, horrifying story of a vengeful, bloodthirsty vampire.\\" Castle of Frankenstein described the film as \\"one of the best horror thrillers of recent years.\\"Unknown Reviewer. Castle of Frankenstein Magazine, issue #4 (May 1964), pg 32. David Pirie, in The Time Out Film Guide, called the movie, \\"A classic horror film [...] The exquisitely realized expressionist images of cruelty and sexual suggestion shocked audiences in the early '60s and occasioned a long-standing ban by the British censor. The visual style still impresses...\\" Carlos Clarens felt that \\"the quality of the visual narrative was superb—the best black-and-white photography to enhance a horror movie in the past two decades. Bava also showed himself as a director of a certain promise...\\"Clarens, Carlos. An Illustrated History of the Horror Film, Capricorn Books, 1967. Reissued as An Illustrated History of Horror and Science-Fiction Films, Da Capo Press, 1997. Eugene Archer in The New York Times, however, hated the film, noting that \\"Barbara Steele, a blank-eyed manikin with an earthbound figure and a voice from outer space, is appropriately cast as a vampire: not the Theda Bara kind, but the genuine blood-drinking variety. Mario Bava, ostensibly the director of this nonsense, allows this female Bela Lugosi to quench her thirst four times before she burns, screaming, at the stake [...] As a setting for unadulterated horror, it will leave its audiences yearning for that quiet, sunny little motel in Psycho.\\" Ivan Butler opined that the film \\"appears to offer horror, beauty and the ludicrous in about equal proportions.\\"Butler, Ivan. Horror in the Cinema, A. S. Barnes & Co., 1967 (revised 1970). Decades after its original release, Black Sunday has continued to maintain a positive critical reputation. Pauline Kael described it as \\"a rich draught of vampire's blood. With its crypts and cobwebs and eerie old castles set in batty, steamy forests, its sumptuous enough to have acquired a considerable reputation.\\"Kael, Pauline 5001 Nights At The Movies, pg. 78, Henry Holt and Company, 1991 edition. In The Penguin Encyclopedia of Horror and the Supernatural (1986), Timothy Sullivan wrote, \\"A supremely atmospheric horror film, Black Sunday was Mario Bava's first and best directorial job, and the first of the 1960s cycle of Italian Gothic cinema [...] [The film] remains [Bava's] greatest achievement, without a doubt one of the best horror films ever made.\\"Sullivan, Timothy \\"Black Sunday\\", in Jack Sullivan (ed) The Penguin Encyclopedia of Horror and the Supernatural, 1986, Viking, p37. (Reprinted by Random House Value Publishing, 1989, ) Phil Hardy's The Aurum Film Encyclopedia: Horror observed, \\"Bava's first (and best) film as a solo director [...] The movie derives its lyrical force and indeed its sense of horror from the knowledge that a woman's sexuality cannot be eliminated and will return, bearing the scars of the violence with which it was repressed, to challenge the order of things.\\"Hardy, Phil (editor) The Aurum Film Encyclopedia: Horror, 1984, Aurum Press. (Reprinted as The Overlook Film Encyclopedia: Horror, Overlook Press, 1995, ) Danny Peary, in his Cult Movies book, wrote, \\"Black Sunday is as impressive as it is because it reveals Bava's background – almost everything is conveyed visually...It is with his camera that Bava [...] creates an atmosphere where the living and dead coexist (but not harmoniously) [...] Black Sunday convinced many of us that Mario Bava would be a force to be reckoned with in the horror field for many years to come. Unfortunately, he never made another picture half as good.\\"Peary, Danny Cult Movies, Delta Books, 1981. Allmovie has noted, \\"Generally considered to be the foremost example of Italian gothic horror, this darkly atmospheric black-and-white chiller put director Mario Bava on the international map ... The atmosphere is so heavy and the imagery so dense that the film becomes nearly too rich in texture, but the sheer, ghastly beauty of it all is entrancing.\\" Glenn Erickson, in reviewing the Anchor Bay DVD release of the film, wrote, \\"Mario Bava's first credited feature is still the number one film of the Italian horror renaissance, startlingly original and genuinely creepy [...] The budget may have been low, but Black Sunday is more atmospheric and cinematically active than any of Hollywood's classic horror films.\\" The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 86% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 21 reviews, with an average rating of 7.51/10. The site's critics consensus reads, \\"Mario Bava's official narrative debut is a witchy nightmare steeped in gothic splendor, shot in chiaroscuro black and white and punctuated with startling gore.\\" When released in the US during 1961, the film was a commercial success for AIP, becoming the distributor's greatest financial success to that time. It also brought Barbara Steele to the attention of genre fans and was the first of a series of horror movies she starred in over the next several years. Although she would next star in Roger Corman's The Pit and the Pendulum (1961), she returned to Italy the next year and made all of her subsequent horror titles there. While all of her genre titles have their fans, none of the films have had the same effect as Black Sunday.  Legacy  According to Tim Lucas, Black Sunday has had an \\"almost incalculable influence\\" on artists and filmmakers. The film's opening Inquisition sequence was a strong inspiration for many similar scenes appearing in such movies as The Brainiac (1961), Terror in the Crypt (1963), Bloody Pit of Horror (1965), and Michael Reeves' The She Beast (1966). Francis Ford Coppola's 1992 film Bram Stoker's Dracula recreates several scenes from Black Sunday nearly exactly as they were filmed, in homage to Bava's film.Bram Stoker's Dracula Collector's Edition DVD, 2007, Sony Pictures Roman Coppola has cited Black Sunday as an influence on his father's film.Coppolla, Roman. Interviewed in the documentary \\"Method and Madness: Visualizing 'Dracula'\\", Dracula Collector's Edition DVD, 2007, Sony Pictures Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow (1999) \\"borrowed\\" some of the film's imagery, particularly in a scene in which Lisa Marie's face is punctured by an iron maiden. Burton has explicitly cited Bava's film as an inspiration, noting, \\"One of the movies that remain with me probably stronger than anything is Black Sunday..There's a lot of old films – [Bava's] in particular – where the vibe and the feeling is what it's about... [t]he feeling's a mixture of eroticism, of sex, of horror and starkness of image, and to me, that is more real than what most people would consider realism in films...\\"Burton, Tim. Interviewed in the documentary Mario Bava: Maestro of the Macabre, 2000, Image Entertainment In 1989, Bava's son, Lamberto Bava, made a quasi-remake of the film. While the new Black Sunday has a very similar mask torture sequence to the original, it features a completely different storyline. It was released in the US as Demons 5: The Devil's Veil, although there is no connection between this and the rest of the Demons series.  Home media  The film was released by Image Entertainment on DVD on December 14, 1999, with an aspect ratio of 1.66:1 widescreen (anamorphic), with the following edition details: an audio commentary by Tim Lucas, a photo and poster gallery, and filmographies of Bava and Steele. It was re-released on April 3, 2007 by Anchor Bay, with the same features as the earlier release. On September 18, 2012, Kino Lorber released the film in the Blu-ray format, once again repeating the same special features that were included in the previous DVD releases. The UK Blu-ray (region B) release by Arrow Films also features the above release’s extras plus the US version of the film entitled Black Sunday and a print of I Vampiri (1956) (in standard definition) which Bava also worked on.

The design is heavily inspired by the Vim text editor, and the authors try to maintain consistency with it wherever possible.  Features  Once activated, Pentadactyl removes all Firefox's default user interface chrome (except for the tab bar) and adds a Vim-inspired command line at the bottom of the window. The key bindings and dialog invocation are also changed to those familiar to Vim users. Apart from Vim-like features, Pentadactyl includes the Lynx-like links hinting mode, allowing user to enter links manipulation commands referring to the links by labels or numbers. As the key mappings of the Pentadactyl differ significantly from those typically expected by web application developers, occasional conflicts of browser- and site-defined key mapping occur. Pentadactyl deals with such cases by providing a special \\"pass- through\\" mode, which passes all the key press events (except for Esc key) directly to the site. This mode can either be activated manually or enforced on a per domain basis with a configuration file.  Development  Pentadactyl was forked from the Vimperator Firefox extension after the disagreement over the project directions and governance. After the split Pentadactyl differentiated itself with improved start timing, ability to use the extension without restarting Firefox after installation and some changes for consistency with Vim.

Acid Red 2, is an indicator dye that turns red in acidic solutions. It is an azo dye, and is a dark red crystalline powder. Methyl red is a pH indicator; it is red in pH under 4.4, yellow in pH over 6.2, and orange in between, with a pKa of 5.1.IB chemistry Higher Level: Murexide and methyl red are investigated as promising enhancers of sonochemical destruction of chlorinated hydrocarbon pollutants. Methyl red is classed by the IARC in group 3 - unclassified as to carcinogenic potential in humans. Color transition of methyl red solution under different acid–base conditions. Left: acidic, middle: about pH 5.1 (the pKa), right: alkaline Preparation As an azo dye, methyl red may be prepared by diazotization of anthranilic acid, followed by reaction with dimethylaniline: :600px Properties Methyl red displays pH dependent photochromism, with protonation causing it to adopt a hydrazone/quinone structure. :500px Methyl Red has a special use in histopathology for showing acidic nature of tissue and presence of organisms with acidic natured cell walls. Methyl Red is detectably fluorescent in 1:1 water:methanol (pH 7.0), with an emission maximum at 375 nm (UVA) upon excitation with 310 nm light (UVB). Methyl red test Methyl red test: Escherichia coli (left side) showing a 'positive' result, and Enterobacter cloacae (right side) showing a 'negative' result In microbiology, methyl red is used in the methyl red test (MR test), used to identify bacteria producing stable acids by mechanisms of mixed acid fermentation of glucose (cf. Voges–Proskauer test). The MR test, the \\"M\\" portion of the four IMViC tests, is used to identify enteric bacteria based on their pattern of glucose metabolism. All enterics initially produce pyruvic acid from glucose metabolism. Some enterics subsequently use the mixed acid pathway to metabolize pyruvic acid to other acids, such as lactic, acetic, and formic acids. These bacteria are called methyl-red positive and include Escherichia coli and Proteus vulgaris. Other enterics subsequently use the butylene glycol pathway to metabolize pyruvic acid to neutral end products. These bacteria are called methyl-red-negative and include Serratia marcescens and Enterobacter aerogenes. =Process= An isolate is inoculated into a tube with a sterile transfer loop. The tube is incubated at for 2–5 days. After incubation, 2.5 ml of the medium are transferred to another tube. Five drops of the pH indicator methyl red is added to this tube. The tube is gently rolled between the palms to disperse the methyl red. =Expected results= Enterics that subsequently metabolize pyruvic acid to other acids lower the pH of the medium to 4.2. At this pH, methyl red turns red, a positive test. Enterics that subsequently metabolize pyruvic acid to neutral end products lower the pH of the medium to only 6.0. At this pH, methyl red is yellow, a negative test.

Archaeological excavations started in 1953, and now the site is operated by the Muzeul Municipiului București in the historic centre of Bucharest, Romania. Palatul Voievodal Vlad the Impaler's reign was dominated by conflicts with the Ottoman Empire, hence the necessity to permanently watch over and protect the southern border, the Danube, made him stay in the fortified town on the Dâmbovița banks. He issued a Latin document on 13 June 1458 from the area of current Bucharest. Then, on 20 September 1459, he issued a document in Slavonic, specifically referring to the \\"fortress\\" in Bucharest, his \\"princely residence\\". Other documents were issued in 1460 and 1461. Vlad would have been accompanied by his family, courtiers, and an army corps. During his reign, Mircea Ciobanul repaired the palace, and defined the limits of the city. His palace became the economic nucleus of Bucharest, surrounded by the houses of traders and craftsmen known as the Lipscani. Matei Basarab repaired the palace during his own reign, so that it was \\"completely rebuilt...amazingly elegant\\" with a \\"charming aspect, much finer and gayer\\". Constantin Brâncoveanu rebuilt and extended the palace using stone, including a great marble staircase at the entrance. Alexander Ypsilantis built a new princely court in 1775 at Dealul Spirii. The old court was auctioned in 1798 by Constantine Hangerli.

He is also known for his time with WWE under the ring name Tye Dillinger. Having begun his career on the independent circuit as Shawn Spears, Arneill initially joined WWE in 2006 and worked for the company between 2006 and 2009, performing in the developmental territories Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) and Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW) as well as briefly on the main roster brand ECW under the slightly modified ring name Gavin Spears. After being released from WWE in 2009, he returned to the independent scene, before rejoining WWE in 2013 where he was assigned to NXT under the new gimmick of Tye Dillinger. After a rise in popularity, Dillinger was promoted to the main roster in 2017, working on the SmackDown brand until his second release from the company in 2019. Shortly after leaving WWE, he signed with the newly founded promotion All Elite Wrestling in May 2019, reverting back to his Shawn Spears name. Early life Born and raised in St. Catharines, Ontario, Arneill attended Laura Secord Secondary School. He played hockey for over ten years until he decided to leave the sport and enter professional wrestling. During his childhood, he was a fan of Rick Rude, Rick Martel, and Mr. Perfect. Professional wrestling careerEarly career (2002–2006)= Arneill trained at the Hart Wrestling School in Cambridge Ontario with Smith Hart, Ike Shaw and Waldo Von Erich and then with Eric Young at the WrestlePlex school before receiving further training from Derek Wylde and Cody Deaner. Upon wrestling his debut match in March 2002 as Shawn Spears, he began wrestling for some of the biggest independent wrestling promotions throughout Ontario and the United States, including Border City Wrestling, World Xtreme Wrestling, and Blood Sweat and Ears. On February 27, 2005, Arneill made an appearance on an edition of WWE Heat, unsuccessfully teaming with Mikael Yamaha to face The Hurricane and Rosey. After sending a tape to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) officials, Arneill was called for a try-out in Buffalo, New York. He was signed to a developmental contract by WWE following the tryout, on January 21, 2006. He made a cameo appearance at Cyber Sunday as an employee called \\"Stan\\", who gets superkicked by Shawn Michaels of D-Generation X when Michaels is told that he doesn't understand the meaning of the word \\"controversial\\". =World Wrestling Entertainment/WWE (2006-2009)=Developmental territories (2006–2008) Spears with the OVW Southern Tag Team Championship in December 2007 After signing his WWE contract, Arneill was assigned to the company's developmental territory, Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW). He made his OVW television debut as \\"The Canadian Sensation\\" Shawn Spears, where he defeated then-SmackDown! superstar Simon Dean. After his victory, Dean attacked Spears until Spears was saved by Al Snow, who fended off Dean with a chair. After his debut, Spears quickly made an impact in OVW with a short undefeated streak that was soon ended by Aaron \\"The Idol\\" Stevens when Stevens made Spears submit. After this, Spears formed a tag team with Cody Runnels and they feuded with The Throwbacks for the Southern Tag Team Championship. On December 15, 2006, Spears and Runnels won the title from The Throwbacks. On March 17, 2007, Spears won the Television Championship from Boris Alexiev, his first singles title in OVW. Soon after winning the title, he became more focused on championships and even began trying to steal Runnels' Heavyweight Championship opportunity. During Runnels' Heavyweight Title match, Spears interfered and performed a piledriver to Runnels, preventing him from winning the Heavyweight Championship and thus solidifying his heel turn. Spears then began feuding with Runnels and eventually lost the Television Championship to him on July 6, 2007 before winning it back one week later. He once again lost the title on September 19 to the debuting Ted \\"Manbeast\\" McNailer. Spears later regained the Television Title, only to lose it to Colt Cabana. Spears then began feuding with Cabana and the pair would go on to win the vacant Tag Team Title with on November 7 after defeating Paul Burchill and Stu Sanders. On December 19, Cabana and Spears' feud culminated in a ladder match in which the winner would claim the Tag Team titles for themselves and choose a new partner. Spears lost to Cabana, who then chose Charles \\"The Hammer\\" Evans as his new tag team partner. After OVW split with WWE, Spears debuted in WWE's new development territory, Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW), and teamed up with Nic Nemeth to defeat The Puerto Rican Nightmares for the Florida Tag Team Championship on August 17. Nearly a month later, Nemeth and Spears lost the title to Joe Hennig and Heath Miller on September 11. ECW (2008–2009) On the August 19 episode of ECW, Spears made his WWE television debut as a heel under the name Gavin Spears as part of Theodore Long's \\"New Superstar Initiative\\" in a losing effort to Ricky Ortiz. After his ECW debut, Spears began splitting time between ECW and FCW. On the September 2 edition of ECW, Spears was defeated by Super Crazy. After a three-month absence due to competing in FCW, Spears returned to television on the December 16 episode of ECW, where he lost to Finlay in what turned out to be his final match for the company. On January 9, 2009, Arneill was released from his contract. =Independent circuit (2009–2013)= Spears in 2011 The day before he had been released from WWE, Arneill had broken his hand, and was unable to wrestle for 12 weeks following his release as a result. On May 27, 2009, Spears wrestled and lost to fellow WWE alumnus Elijah Burke in a tryout dark match for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling at their Impact! television tapings. On June 12, Spears made an appearance for Ring of Honor (ROH), where he defeated Alex Payne. On May 16, 2010, Arneill, under his Gavin Spears ring name, teamed up with El Hijo de L.A. Park in a losing effort to Dr. Wagner III and Gigante Extassis on an Extreme Air Wrestle show in Mexico, marking his first tour of Mexico. On May 28 and 29, Arneill made appearances at the 2010 Anime North convention. On August 15, he teamed up with Idol Stevens to capture the WWC World Tag Team Championship after defeating Thunder and Lightning. On October 31, Spears and Stevens lost the World Tag Team Title back to Thunder and Lightning. =Return to WWE (2013-2019)=NXT (2013–2017) On September 15, 2013, it was reported that Spears had re-signed with WWE, and he was assigned to WWE's developmental territory NXT under the ring name Tye Dillinger. He made his televised NXT debut in a losing effort against Mojo Rawley. In early 2014, Dillinger formed a tag team with Jason Jordan, with the two described as a pair of blue chip athletes. The team of Dillinger and Jordan got their first televised win on the April 17 episode of NXT, defeating Baron Corbin and Sawyer Fulton. On the June 5 episode of NXT, Dillinger and Jordan defeated local competitors. On the August 7 episode of NXT, Dillinger and Jordan lost in the first round of a NXT Tag Team Championship tournament to Enzo Amore and Colin Cassady. Dillinger and Jordan then appeared infrequently together, with Dillinger mostly being used as enhancement talent. On the February 25, 2015 episode of NXT, Dillinger's partnership with Jordan officially ended when Jordan unhappy with his partner not initially tagging him in, jumped off the apron and walked out on Dillinger just as he went to make the tag. After the match, an enraged Dillinger called out his old partner but instead was met with a quick loss to Baron Corbin. On the August 12 episode of NXT, Dillinger debuted a new gimmick as the \\"Perfect 10\\" and defeated Solomon Crowe. At NXT TakeOver: Brooklyn, Dillinger faced the debuting Apollo Crews in a losing effort. On the April 27, 2016 episode of NXT, he defeated Buddy Murphy. He faced the debuting Andrade \\"Cien\\" Almas at NXT TakeOver: The End, where Dillinger was defeated, although he received praise for his performance. On the September 28 episode of NXT, after defeating Angelo Dawkins, Dillinger was approached by Bobby Roode, who proposed the two team up for the 2016 Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic, which Dillinger accepted. The following week, Dillinger and Roode took on SAnitY (Alexander Wolfe and Sawyer Fulton). During the match, Roode walked out on Dillinger, resulting in the team losing in the first round. The following week on October 19, Dillinger called out Roode for a match at NXT TakeOver: Toronto, which Roode won. On the December 14 episode of NXT, Dillinger defeated Eric Young by disqualification in a #1 contender Fatal 4-Way qualifying match. At NXT TakeOver: San Antonio, Dillinger was defeated by Young following a distraction from Alexander Wolfe and Killian Dain. At NXT TakeOver: Orlando, Dillinger teamed up with Roderick Strong, Kassius Ohno and Ruby Riot to take on SAnitY in an 8-person mixed tag team match in a losing effort. Dillinger made his last NXT appearance on the April 5 tapings, closing out the event by winning a Steel Cage match against Eric Young. SmackDown (2017–2019) On January 29, 2017, at Royal Rumble, Dillinger was a surprise entrant in the Royal Rumble match, entering at number 10 but was eliminated by Braun Strowman. On the April 4 episode of SmackDown Live, Dillinger would make his main roster debut, defeating Curt Hawkins. Dillinger would enter a short feud with Aiden English, defeating him on various episodes of SmackDown Live, leading to a match at Backlash, where Dillinger once again defeated English to end their feud. On the July 4 episode of SmackDown Live, Dillinger would compete in an Independence Day Battle Royal to determine the number one contender to the United States Championship, lasting until the final three before being eliminated by Sami Zayn. At Battleground, Dillinger briefly reignited his feud with English, with Dillinger facing him in a losing effort. On the August 29 episode of SmackDown Live, Dillinger would confront and brawl with Baron Corbin, who was about to answer an open challenge set by AJ Styles for the United States Championship. After Dillinger would fight off Corbin, he would take on Styles' challenge in a losing effort. On the September 12 episode of SmackDown Live, Dillinger would get another shot at the title against Styles, once again in a losing effort. After trading victories with Corbin on various episodes of SmackDown Live, both Dillinger and Corbin would challenge Styles for the United States Championship at Hell in a Cell in a triple threat match, where Corbin would win the title. On the December 26 episode of SmackDown Live, Dillinger would compete in a United States Championship tournament, after former champion Dolph Ziggler vacated the title the week before, where Dillinger would be defeated by Jinder Mahal in the first round. At Royal Rumble, Dillinger was to be the number 10 entrant in the Royal Rumble match but was attacked backstage by Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn, with Zayn taking his spot. At Fastlane, Dillinger would team with Breezango (Fandango and Tyler Breeze), defeating the team of Chad Gable, Shelton Benjamin and Mojo Rawley. At WrestleMania 34, Dillinger would compete in the André the Giant Memorial Battle Royal, where he was eliminated by Matt Hardy. In his final pay-per-view appearance, Dillinger competed in the Greatest Royal Rumble, where he entered at number 42, but was eliminated by Braun Strowman. On the July 10 episode of SmackDown Live, Dillinger was scheduled to face Samoa Joe, however, Joe attacked him after the match, this led to the next week Dillinger to challenge Joe in a losing effort. At a WWE live event on August 13, Dillinger was injured in a match with Shelton Benjamin. The referee called for the end of the match, giving Benjamin the win via count out. Dillinger was promptly escorted backstage by officials. Dillinger returned on the September 25 episode of SmackDown Live, challenging Shinsuke Nakamura for the WWE United States Championship; however, he was attacked during the match by Randy Orton, in what was Dillinger's last televised match with the company. Dillinger suffered a hand injury in October 2018 which kept him out of action for several months. He returned to in-ring competition at a house show on February 9, 2019; however, he was still not used on television. On February 19, 2019, Dillinger announced in a Twitter statement that he had requested his release from WWE and was granted on February 22, 2019. = Return to independent circuit (2019)= After his release from WWE, Arnell reverted to using the ring name, Shawn Spears once again. On March 1, 2019, he announced on Twitter that he will be accepting bookings on the independent circuit starting May 31. On the June 5 episode of Beyond Wrestling's weekly show, Spears debuted for the promotion defeating Orange Cassidy in the main event. = All Elite Wrestling (2019–present)= Arnell, under his previous name of Shawn Spears, debuted for All Elite Wrestling (AEW) at their inaugural pay-per-view event Double or Nothing, competing in the pre-show Casino Battle Royale. He would fail to win, however, as the match was won by Adam Page. In an interview with Sports Illustrated, Spears stated he would be appearing with the promotion going forward. His signing would officially be announced on June 12. At Fyter Fest in June, Spears established himself as a heel after hitting Cody with a steel chair shot to the top of the head. Going forward he would begin calling himself \\"The Chairman of AEW\\". At All Out on August 31, Spears unsuccessfully faced Cody in a singles match. Leading to All Out, Spears aligned with Tully Blanchard, who began acting as his manager. Spears would then start a feud with Joey Janela, after Janela had disrespected Blanchard. At Full Gear on November 9, Spears defeated Janela. In February 2020, Blanchard and Spears began a campaign to recruit a new tag team partner for Spears. However, the angle was soon dropped due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Shortly after, Spears was used primarily in a comedic role as he mocked Dustin Rhodes and the Rhodes family in a news report parody segment and challenged Dustin Rhodes to a match at Double or Nothing. At the event, Spears had his clothes ripped off and was defeated by Dustin Rhodes. On the June 3 episode of Dynamite, Blanchard returned and berated Spears for making a joke out of himself at Double or Nothing. He then presented him with a black glove, similar to the one worn by Blackjack Mulligan and Ted DiBiase, that can be illegally loaded with a metal slug. Spears made his in-ring return on the June 16th edition of Dark wearing the black glove, scoring a submission victory over Lee Johnson after applying the Sharpshooter on Johnson. Over the months, Spears has claimed victories over various competitors, then knocked them out with his loaded black glove. Other media Arneill, as Tye Dillinger, appears in the video games WWE 2K17 (as downloadable content), WWE 2K18 and WWE 2K19 as a playable character. Personal life Arneill married fellow wrestler Cassandra McIntosh, better known by her ring name Peyton Royce in August 2019. He along with fellow wrestler Mattias Clement (who wrestles in WWE as Tyler Breeze) run a wrestling school in Apopka, Florida called Flatbacks Wrestling.

Lovecraftian horror is a subgenre of horror fiction that emphasizes the cosmic horror of the unknown (or unknowable) more than gore or other elements of shock. It is named after American author H. P. Lovecraft (1890–1937). His work emphasizes a philosophy of cosmicism, the idea that the reality underlying the veneer of normality is so alien that seeing it would be harmful. Some scholars use \\"Lovecraftian horror\\" and \\"cosmic horror\\" interchangeably. Cosmic horror has been characterized as: * The \\"fear and awe we feel when confronted by phenomena beyond our comprehension, whose scope extends beyond the narrow field of human affairs and boasts of cosmic significance\\".Ralickas, Vivian. \\"'Cosmic Horror' and the Question of the Sublime in Lovecraft.\\" Journal of the Fantastic in the Arts 18, no. 3 (2008): 364. * A \\"contemplation of mankind's place in the vast, comfortless universe revealed by modern science\\" in which the horror springs from \\"the discovery of appalling truth\\". * A naturalistic fusion of horror and science fiction in which presumptions about the nature of reality are \\"eroded\\".  Origin  Lovecraft refined this style of storytelling into his own mythos that involved a set of supernatural, pre- human, and extraterrestrial elements. His work was inspired by and similar to previous authors such as Edgar Allan Poe, Algernon Blackwood and Lord Dunsany. The hallmark of Lovecraft's work is cosmicism: the sense that ordinary life is a thin shell over a reality that is so alien and abstract in comparison that merely contemplating it would damage the sanity of the ordinary person. Lovecraft's work is also steeped in the insular feel of rural New England, and much of the genre continues to maintain this sense that \\"that which man was not meant to know\\" might be closer to the surface of ordinary life outside of the crowded cities of modern civilization. However, Lovecraftian horror is not restricted to the countryside; \\"The Horror at Red Hook\\", for instance, is set in a crowded ethnic ghetto. = Themes of Lovecraftian horror = Several themes found in Lovecraft's writings are considered to be components of a \\"Lovecraftian\\" work: * Anti-anthropocentrism, misanthropy in general. Lovecraft's works tend not to focus on characterization of humans, in line with his view of humanity's insignificant place in the universe, and the general modernist trend of literature at the time of his writings. * Preoccupation with viscerate texture. The horror features of Lovecraft's stories tend to involve protean semi-gelatinous substances, such as slime, as opposed to standard horror elements such as blood, bones, or corpses. * Antiquarian writing style. Even when dealing with up-to-date technology, Lovecraft tended to use anachronisms as well as old-fashioned words when dealing with such things. For example, he used the term \\"man of science\\" rather than the modern word \\"scientist\\" and often spelled \\"show\\" as \\"shew\\" and \\"lantern\\" as \\"lanthorne.\\" Lovecraft was an Anglophile, and frequently used British spelling, as in the title of \\"The Colour Out of Space\\". * Detachment. Lovecraftian heroes (both in original writings and in more modern adaptations) tend to be socially isolated, reclusive individuals, usually with an academic or scholarly intent to compensate for social shortcomings. * Questionable parentage. Relatives of characters are typically depicted as paranormal, dysfunctional or abnormal, whereas intimate relations in general are often represented as foreboding, mysterious, and sinister. * Helplessness and hopelessness. Although Lovecraftian heroes may occasionally deal a \\"setback\\" to malignant forces, their victories are temporary, and they usually pay a price for it. Otherwise, subjects often find themselves completely unable to simply run away, instead driven by some other force to their desperate end. * Unanswered questions. Characters in Lovecraft's stories rarely if ever fully understand what is happening to them, and often go insane if they try to do so. * Sanity's fragility and vulnerability. Characters in many of Lovecraft's stories are unable to cope mentally with the extraordinary and almost incomprehensible truths they witness, hear or discover. The strain of trying to cope, as Lovecraft often illustrates, is impossible to bear and insanity takes hold.  Collaborators and followers  Much of Lovecraft's influence is secondary, as he was a friend, inspiration, and correspondent to many authors who developed their own notable works. Many of these writers also worked with Lovecraft on jointly-written stories. His more famous friends and collaborators include Robert Bloch, author of Psycho; Robert E. Howard, creator of Conan the Barbarian; and August Derleth, who codified and added to the Cthulhu Mythos. Subsequent horror writers also heavily drew on Lovecraft's work. While many made direct references to elements of Lovecraft's mythos, either to draw on its associations or to acknowledge his influence, many others drew on the feel and tone of his work without specifically referring to mythos elements. Some have said that Lovecraft, along with Edgar Allan Poe, is the most influential author on modern horror. Author Stephen King has said: \\"Now that time has given us some perspective on his work, I think it is beyond doubt that H. P. Lovecraft has yet to be surpassed as the Twentieth Century's greatest practitioner of the classic horror tale.\\" By the late 20th century, Lovecraft had become something of a pop-culture icon, resulting in countless reinterpretations of and references to his work. Many of these fall outside the sphere of Lovecraftian horror, but represent Cthulhu Mythos in popular culture. = Literature and art = Lovecraft's work, mostly published in pulp magazines, never had the same sort of influence on literature as his high- modernist literary contemporaries such as Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald. However, his impact is still broadly and deeply felt in some of the most celebrated authors of contemporary fiction. The fantasias of Jorge Luis Borges display a marked resemblance to some of Lovecraft's more dream influenced work. Borges also dedicated his story, \\"There Are More Things\\" to Lovecraft, though he also considered Lovecraft \\"an involuntary parodist of Poe.\\" The controversial French novelist Michel Houellebecq has also cited Lovecraft as an influence and has written a lengthy essay on Lovecraft entitled H. P. Lovecraft: Against the World, Against Life in which he refers to the Cthulhu cycle as \\"the great texts\\". Lovecraft's penchant for dreamscapes and for the biologically macabre has also profoundly influenced visual artists such as Jean \\"Moebius\\" Giraud and H. R. Giger. Giger's book of paintings which led directly to many of the designs for the film Alien was named Necronomicon, the name of a fictional book in several of Lovecraft's mythos stories. Dan O'Bannon, the original writer of the Alien screenplay, has also mentioned Lovecraft as a major influence on the film. With Ronald Shusett, he would later write Dead & Buried and Hemoglobin, both of which were admitted pastiches of Lovecraft.  Comics  Lovecraft has cast a long shadow across the comic world. This has included not only adaptations of his stories, such as H. P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu: The Whisperer in Darkness, Graphic Classics: H. P. LovecraftGraphic Classics: H. P. Lovecraft and MAX's Haunt of Horror, but also the incorporation of the Mythos into new stories. Alan Moore has touched on Lovecraftian themes, in particular in his The Courtyard and Yuggoth Cultures and Other Growths (and Antony Johnston's spin-off Yuggoth Creatures), but also in his Black Dossier where the story \\"What Ho, Gods of the Abyss?\\" mixed Lovecraftian horror with Bertie Wooster. Neonomicon and 'Providence' posit a world where the Mythos, while existing as fiction written by Lovecraft, is also very real. Gordon Rennie not only used various Lovecraft creations, like the Tcho-Tcho, in his Necronauts, but he also included Lovecraft himself as a character, teaming up with an influence of his, Charles Fort, a combination that would occur again in Fort: Prophet of the Unexplained. Necronauts was not the first appearance of Lovecraftian horror in 2000 AD as Grant Morrison's Zenith involved the eponymous hero trying to stop the Lloigor, known as the Many-Angled Ones. Entities also called Many-Angled Ones appear in the Marvel Universe in the storyline \\"Realm of Kings\\" where they rule an alternate reality. This story line was in their Guardians of the Galaxy comic, where an alternate universe invades the main Marvel Universe. The invading universe, dubbed the \\"Cancerverse\\" in the comics, is a universe where Lovecraft's Elder Gods triumph over death and conquer the universe. The inspiration for the universe is clearly Lovecraftian, as even the words are taken directly from Lovecraft's writings. The most obvious example of this is the word \\"fhtagn\\". Unlike a tale of Lovecraftian horror, however, the forces of good triumph; this is achieved only by releasing a galactic mass murderer loose on both universes, providing some lasting horror. The Marvel Universe also contains a range of Cthulhu Mythos comics, including the Elder Gods. As well as appearing with Fort in two comics stories, Lovecraft has appeared as a character in a number of Lovecraftian comics. He appears in Mac Carter's and Tony Salmons's limited series The Strange Adventures of H. P. Lovecraft from Image and in the Arcana children's graphic novel Howard and the Frozen Kingdom from Bruce Brown. A webcomic, Lovecraft is Missing, debuted in 2008 and takes place in 1926, before the publication of \\"The Call of Cthulhu\\", and weaves in elements of Lovecraft's earlier stories. Boom! Studios have also run a number of series based on Cthulhu and other characters from the Mythos, including Cthulhu Tales and Fall of Cthulhu. The creator of Hellboy, Mike Mignola, has described the books as being influenced primarily by the works of Lovecraft, in addition to those of Robert E. Howard and the legend of Dracula. This was adapted into the 2004 film Hellboy. His Elseworlds mini-series The Doom That Came to Gotham reimagines Batman in a confrontation with Lovecraftian monsters. The manga artist Junji Ito was heavily influenced by Lovecraft. Gou Tanabe has adapted some of Lovecraft's tales into manga. The third volume of the comic series Atomic Robo, named \\"Atomic Robo and the Shadow from Beyond Time\\" features a Lovecraftian monster as the antagonist, and indeed has an appearance from H. P. Lovecraft himself. Issue #32 of The Brave and the Bold was heavily influenced by the works and style of Lovecraft. In addition to using pastiches of Cthulhu, the Deep Ones, and R'lyeh, writer J. Michael Straczynski also wrote the story in a distinctly Lovecraftian style. Written entirely from the perspective of a traumatized sailor, the story makes use of several of Lovecraft's trademarks, including the ultimate feeling of insignificance in the face of the supernatural. The magazine Illustrated Ape features a Lovecraft-related web comic on its site in the gallery section. The strip is written and illustrated by Charles Cutting and uses The Dream Quest of Unknown Kadath as its basis.  Film and television  From the 1950s onwards, in the era following Lovecraft's death, Lovecraftian horror truly became a subgenre, not only fueling direct cinematic adaptations of Poe and Lovecraft, but providing the foundation upon which many of the horror films of the 1950s and 1960s were constructed. =1960s= One notable filmmaker to dip into the Lovecraftian well was 1960s B-filmmaker Roger Corman, with his The Haunted Palace (1963) being very loosely based on The Case of Charles Dexter Ward , and his X: The Man with the X-ray Eyes featuring a protagonist driven to insanity by heightened vision that allows him to see God at the heart of the universe. Though not direct adaptations, the episodes of the well-known series The Outer Limits often had Lovecraftian themes, such as human futility and insignificance and the limits of sanity and understanding. Amongst the other well-known adaptations of this era are Dark Intruder (1965) which has some passing references to the Cthulhu Mythos; 1965 also saw Boris Karloff and Nick Adams in Die, Monster, Die! based on Lovecraft's short story \\"The Colour Out of Space\\"; The Shuttered Room (1967), based on an August Derleth \\"posthumous collaboration\\" with Lovecraft, and Curse of the Crimson Altar (U.S. title: The Crimson Cult) (1968), based on \\"The Dreams in the Witch House\\". =1970s= The Dunwich Horror (1970) was based directly on Lovecraft's story of the same name, though with such plot diversions as introducing a female love interest for the character of Wilbur Whateley. Rod Serling's 1969–73 series Night Gallery adapted at least two Lovecraft stories, \\"Pickman's Model\\" and \\"Cool Air\\". The episode \\"Professor Peabody's Last Lecture\\", concerning the fate of a man who read the Necronomicon, included a student named \\"Mr. Lovecraft\\", along with other students sharing names of authors in the Lovecraft Circle (another five-minute short, called \\"Ms. Lovecraft Sent Me\\", about a babysitter and her strange client, has no relevance to anything written by Lovecraft, but was probably an affectionate tip of the hat from Jack Laird, who had scripted the other Lovecraft-based episodes). The 1979 science-fiction horror film Alien, directed by Ridley Scott and written by Dan O'Bannon, has been described as Lovecraftian. =1980s= In 1981, The Evil Dead comedy horror film franchise was created by Sam Raimi after studying H. P. Lovecraft. It consists of the films The Evil Dead (1981), Evil Dead II (1987), and Army of Darkness (1992). The Necronomicon Ex-Mortis, or simply The Book of the Dead, is depicted in each of the three films. John Carpenter's \\"Apocalypse Trilogy\\" (The Thing, Prince of Darkness and In the Mouth of Madness) feature Lovecraftian elements, which become more noticeable in each film. The 1984 blockbuster Ghostbusters (which novelist/screenwriter Barbara Hambly has called \\"marvelously Lovecraftian\\") is noticeably reminiscent of Lovecraft's style.H. P. Lovecraft (October 1996) \\"The Transition of H. P. Lovecraft\\", p. ix. Three episodes of the animated spin-off series (\\"The Collect Call of Cathulhu\\", \\"The Hole in the Wall Gang\\" and \\"Russian About\\") are directly inspired by the Cthulhu Mythos. The blackly comedic Re-Animator (1985), was based on Lovecraft's novella Herbert West- Reanimator. Re-Animator spawned two sequel films. 1986's From Beyond was loosely based on Lovecraft's short story of the same name. 1987's film The Curse was an effective adaptation of Lovecraft's \\"The Colour Out of Space\\". However, its sequel, Curse II: The Bite, had no Lovecraftian relevance. 1988's The Unnamable was a loose adaptation of Lovecraft's short story of the same name. =1990s= The 1991 HBO film Cast a Deadly Spell starred Fred Ward as Harry Phillip Lovecraft, a noir detective investigating the theft of the Necronomicon in an alternate universe 1948 Los Angeles where magic was commonplace. The sequel Witch Hunt had Dennis Hopper as H. Phillip Lovecraft in a story set two years later. 1992's The Resurrected, directed by Dan O'Bannon, is an adaptation of Lovecraft's novel The Case of Charles Dexter Ward. It contains numerous elements faithful to Lovecraft's story, though the studio made major cuts to the film. The self-referential Necronomicon (1993), featured Lovecraft himself as a character, played by Jeffrey Combs. The three stories in Necronomicon are based on two H. P. Lovecraft short stories and one Lovecraft novella: \\"The Drowned\\" is based on \\"The Rats in the Walls\\", \\"The Cold\\" is based on \\"Cool Air\\", and \\"Whispers\\" is based on The Whisperer in Darkness. 1994's The Lurking Fear is an adaptation of Lovecraft's story \\"The Lurking Fear\\". It has some elements faithful to Lovecraft's story, while being hijacked by a crime caper subplot. As stated, 1994's In the Mouth of Madness contains plot elements and settings/themes reminiscent of Lovecraft's writings. 1995's Castle Freak is loosely inspired by Lovecraft's story \\"The Outsider\\". =2000s= 2001's Dagon is a Spanish-made horror film directed by Stuart Gordon. Though titled after Lovecraft's story \\"Dagon\\", the film is actually an effective adaptation of his story The Shadow over Innsmouth. 2005's The Call of Cthulhu, made by the H. P. Lovecraft Historical Society, is a largely successful cinematic version of Lovecraft's story, using silent film techniques to mimic the feel of a film that might have been made at the time that Lovecraft's story was written (1926). 2007's The Mist, Frank Darabont's movie adaptation of Stephen King's 1985 novella by the same name, featuring otherworldly Lovecraftian monsters emerging from a thick blanket of mist to terrify a small New England town. 2008's Syfy film The Dunwich Horror (originally known as The Darkest Evil) features Jeffrey Combs and Dean Stockwell.The Dunwich Horror (2009) at imdb.com The action is transplanted from Lovecraft's New England town Dunwich to a town in Louisiana. 2009's The Last Lovecraft: Relic of Cthulhu plays Lovecraftian themes for laughs. Lovecraft's last relative must help save the world from Cthulhu's return. =2010s= The 2010 film Beyond the Black Rainbow takes several elements from Lovecraft's cosmic horror ideals and blends them with psychedelic and new age themes of science and introspection. The television series Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated incorporated several themes and motifs of Lovecraftian horror. This included a character named H.P. Hatecraft as an obvious parody of the famed writer, who was voiced by Jeffrey Combs, the actor who played the character of Herbert West in the film adaptation of the Lovecraft story Herbert West Reanimator. The 2011 film The Whisperer in Darkness is based on an H. P. Lovecraft short story of the same name. It was produced by Andrew Leman, who directed The Call of Cthulhu in 2005. It was shot in black and white like The Call of Cthulhu, but it is not a silent film. Instead, it mimics the feel of a 1930s-era horror film. Drew Goddard directed the 2012 film The Cabin in the Woods. The film, scripted by Goddard and Joss Whedon features an organization known as the Facility that sacrifices five young people in the theme of a horror film in order to placate the Ancient Ones, who once dominated the earth and now live below, so that they will not rise again. Ridley Scott's 2012 science-fiction horror epic Prometheus has been described as Lovecraftian. 2013's Evil Dead, directed by Fede Alvarez, has the Necronomicon play a key role in the plot just as the original The Evil Dead did. 2013's Haiyore! Nyaruko-san, an anime series, is about the human descendants of several of the Lovecraft Cthulhu Mythos deities being directly mentioned as main characters, such as the Crawling Chaos \\"Nyarlathotep/Nyaruko\\", The Living Flame \\"Kyuko/Kuuko\\", and the Wind Deity \\"Hastur/Hasuta\\", along with other incantations and references to Lovecraft's works. Gore Verbinski's 2016 film A Cure for Wellness has been noted for its Lovecraftian elements. The works of Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead Resolution (2012), Spring (2014) and The Endless (2017) have been noted for containing Lovecraftian elements and themes of cosmic horror. The 2017 Finnish short film Sound from the Deep incorporates elements from At the Mountains of Madness in a modern day setting. Alex Garland's 2018 movie Annihilation (based on the 2014 novel of the same name by Jeff VanderMeer) contains similarities with The Colour Out of Space, as it revolves around an alien entity that crash lands on Earth and begins to expand mutating nearby plant and animal life. Featuring Nicolas Cage and directed by Richard Stanley, Colour Out of Space was released in 2019 based on the short story of the same name. Robert Egger's 2019 movie The Lighthouse has been compared to Lovecraft's works due to the dreary atmosphere, deep sea horror imagery and the otherworldly and maddening power of the titular lighthouse that drives the protagonists to insanity. =2020s= William Eubank, director of the 2020 film Underwater, has confirmed that the creatures of his film are tied to the Cthulhu Mythos.  Games  Although Lovecraft despised games,from the HPL Archive \\"As much as Lovecraft hated games, it is ironic that many Lovecraft games exist.\\" http://www.hplovecraft.com/popcult/ his characters and settings have appeared in many video games and role-playing games. Some of these used Lovecraft's creations chiefly for name value (see Cthulhu Mythos in popular culture), but others have embraced Lovecraft's characteristic mood and themes. = Role- playing = In the early 1970s, Dungeons & Dragons drew from many of the most popular fantasy settings of the pulp era and weird fiction, including those of Lovecraft, whom Gygax has cited as an influence from the beginning. However, direct reference to Lovecraft's creations by name would wait until Dragon magazine issue #12 in 1978 with Robert J. Kuntz's, \\"The Lovecraftian Mythos in Dungeons & Dragons\\". In the AD&D; First Edition Dungeon Masters Guide in 1979, Lovecraft was listed among the recommended authors, which named authors and stories that influenced the feel and setting of the game. In 1980, a hardcover collection of the various fantasy and historical pantheons available for the game was published under the title Deities & Demigods. The first and second printings contained a version of the Cthulhu Mythos. Another gaming company, Chaosium, owned the rights to use Lovecraft's creations in games, and a deal was struck between TSR and Chaosium that allowed TSR to use the Cthulhu Mythos in Deities & Demigods for the rights to use elements of TSR copyrights in one of Chaosium's future books. The Cthulhu Mythos section was removed in the third and subsequent printings, and collectors prize early printings that contain it. shows contents of different printings. As the game has evolved, many of the oldest creatures (e.g. the Mind Flayers, or illithid) and even gods (e.g. Tharizdun) of the game have their inspirations in Lovecraft, as well as newer elements, such as the Far Realm, an entire plane of insanity inspired by Lovecraft's works, and in October, 2004, Dragon magazine published a lengthy article titled \\"The Shadow over D&D;: H. P. Lovecraft's Influence on Dungeons & Dragons\\" discussing these influences. Dungeons & Dragons was not the only role-playing game to incorporate Lovecraftian horror. The most overt example was published in 1980 by Chaosium. Call of Cthulhu is directly based on the Cthulhu Mythos. In keeping with its source material, and unlike most other role-playing games, characters who attempt to confront its monsters directly are likely to die or be driven insane rather than succeed. This is reinforced by the game's best-known feature, a mechanism by which knowledge about Mythos entities can only be gained at a permanent cost to one's sanity. The Call of Cthulhu rules and source material have been adapted and included in a number of subsequent science fiction and fantasy role-playing games and rules supplements. Steve Jackson Games' GURPS, a genre-neutral game system, was first published in 1986 and brought diverse elements of fiction and non- fiction together across their lengthy list of published supplements which included Cthulhupunk, a licensed adaptation of Cthulhu into a cyberpunk setting among many other Lovecraft-inspired works in role-playing, card and board games. The Magic: The Gathering creatures known as the Eldrazi appear to share many characteristics with Lovecraftian monsters. The sets Shadows Over Innistrad and Eldritch Moon incorporated a goth setting while also adding creatures who were changed into mutations with various tentacles and other Lovecraft inspired characteristics. = Video games = Video games, like films, have a rich history of Lovecraftian elements and adaptations. In 1987, The Lurking Horror was the first to bring the Lovecraftian horror subgenre to computer platforms. This was a text-based adventure game, released by Infocom, who are best known for the Zork series. The seminal Lovecraftian role-playing game Call of Cthulhu has lent its name and other material to several video games in the adventure and RPG genre for platforms as diverse as the PC, consoles and mobile devices. Shadow of the Comet, a game which takes place in the 19th century, is strongly inspired by the myth of Cthulhu. The 1996 first- person shooter Quake contains Lovecraftian elements and references. The 1998 text adventure game Anchorhead is heavily inspired by Lovecraftian Horror and features many elements of the Cthulhu mythos, as well as quotes from Lovecraft. The games Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem and Hellgate: London draw inspiration from H. P. Lovecraft. The 2005 Russian game Pathologic features many themes common in Lovecraftian works: The three main characters are all in some way outsiders to the city. The game centers around an unstoppable plague which leaves gelatinous bloody slime in contaminated areas; the player character is completely helpless in stopping the plague. Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth for PC and Xbox is a first person shooter with strong survival horror elements. The 2007 Ukrainian game S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl is set after a fictitious second Chernobyl disaster, which further contaminated the surrounding area with radiation, and caused strange otherworldly changes in local fauna, flora, and the laws of physics. The Scribblenauts series features monsters from the Cthulhu Mythos. League of Legends, a popular MOBA, has characters that come from the Void, a dark and entropic space beyond the world of Runeterra. These characters (distinguished by their grotesque purple forms and always having an apostrophe in their name) strongly resemble Lovecraftian monsters. The Xel'naga are an ancient interdimensional race from the fictional universe of the StarCraft. The originated in the Void, a space or dimension that is separate from the material universe. Every time a new universe was born they took physical form and entered that universe. The Xel'naga created both the Protoss and the Zerg. The game Amnesia: The Dark Descent is heavily inspired by Lovecraft's works, both in visual design as well as in plot device. The Last Door is a point-and- click adventure game which has many Lovecraftian elements. Isolation and the unknown are prominent features of the series. While other media have portrayed Lovecraftian elements in humorous ways as diverse as the Illuminati: New World Order card game and a plethora of plush Cthulhu dolls, video games such as Cthulhu Saves the World (2010) have been less common. The indie game Terraria contains many references to Lovecraft's work, examples include Celestial beings interfering with the world after the Lunatic Cultist is defeated (referencing the cult of Cthulhu) and the many creatures referencing Cthulhu such as the Eye of Cthulhu, Brain of Cthulhu, Servants of Cthulhu, True Eye of Cthulhu, and the Moon Lord. Though Lovecraftian elements have appeared in MMORPGs such as World of Warcraft and Age of Conan since EverQuest, the 2012 game The Secret World was the first to feature Lovecraftian elements as one of its primary inspirations. The Binding of Isaac and its sequel The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth are roguelike games based on many biblical themes. Both games feature an item called Necronomicon, a direct reference to Lovecraft's Necronomicon. The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth also contains the ability for the player to transform into the Leviathan, whose design is inspired by Lovecraftian horror. The From Software game Bloodborne includes many references to Lovecraftian elements, especially cosmicism, putting in familiar terms from Lovecraft, such as the inclusion of \\"The Great Ones\\" or \\"Outer Gods\\" as the main driver of the game's events. The game also uses the Lovecraftian theme of insanity as a driving point for its plot. The Nexus, a setting of MOBA game Heroes of the Storm, and the Dark Nexus realm contain elements of the cosmic horror of the unknown. Sunless Sea is heavily inspired by Lovecraftian horror, with themes like the fear of the unknown. Darkest Dungeon is a role-playing game that displays many themes of Lovecraft's writing such as forbidden knowledge, non-human influences on humanity, inherited guilt, fate, civilization under threat and more. Darkest Dungeon's developer, Red Hook Studios Inc., incorporates elements of H. P. Lovecraft's writing in the aesthetic of the company's branding: the name alluding to his story \\"The Horror at Red Hook,\\" and the company's logo which features a prominent tentacle, alluding to Lovecraft's iconic cosmic entity, Cthulhu. On April 26, 2016 Hearthstone, a free-to-play digital collectible card game, released a 134 card expansion called \\"Whispers of the Old Gods\\" which is based on a theme which revolves around Lovecraftian horror. Whispers of the Old Gods: Everything we know about Hearthstone's Next Expansion Polygon, March 11, 2016 Edge of Nowhere is a 2016 Lovecraftian action-adventure virtual reality game from Insomniac Games. Sundered is a 2017 metroidvania video game that makes heavy use of Lovecraftian elements. The main character, Eshe, is guided through an ever-shifting underworld by an eldritch being known as the \\"Shining Trapezohedron\\". The game involves fighting off monsters and gathering Elder Shards, which allow the Shining Trapezohedron to grant Eshe new abilities at the cost of her humanity. The Sinking City is an open-world horror game in which the player character is a tormented private investigator in the '20s who explores the fishing town of Okamont (located not too far from Innsmouth), cut off from mainland by a mysterious flood, and progressively finds clues about the madness-inducing entity of Cthylla, a star-spawn of Cthulhu. The Flood of the video game Halo franchise contains Lovecraftian horror elements, particularly its leader the Gravemind. These elements are even more prominent in Halo's expanded universe such as the Forerunner Saga books, where the Flood is revealed to be the reanimated remains of an ancient race known as the Precursors who themselves are inspired by Lovecraftian deities. The Precursors were higher-dimensional beings that existed for at least 100 billion years, could assume any form they desired, physical or incorporeal and created most if not all life in the universe and potentially the universe itself.

History The Kato lived farthest south of all the Athapascans in California, occupying Cahto Valley and Long Valley, and in general the country south of Blue Rock and between the headwaters of the two main branches of Eel River. This region comprises rolling hills and oak savannas and is veined with streams. Most of these are nearly dry during the dry summers but are torrential during the rainy winters.

The primitive costume for both men and women was a tanned deer-skin, wrapped about the waist, and a close-fitting knitted cap, which kept in place the knot of hair at the back of the head. At a later period, the Cahto garment included a shirt made of two deer-skins, laced down the front and reaching to the knees. Both men and women generally had tattoos on their faces and the chest: designs consisted largely of upright lines, both broken and straight. In constructing a Cahto house, a circular excavation about two feet deep was prepared, and in it, at the corners of a square were erected four forked posts. The front pair were a little taller than the other, so that the roof would have a slight pitch to the rear. The roof was so small that it was of much less importance in determining the final shape of the house than was the circularity of the base. The space between the posts were stuffed with bunches of long grasses, and slabs of wood and bark. An opening in the roof served to carry off smoke, and the doorway was a narrow opening in front from ground to roof. As many as three families occupied one of these little houses, with all persons cooking at the same fire. For summer camps, brush lean-tos were set up. The dog was the only domesticated animal. A favorite pastime for the females was to assemble early in the evening for singing in chorus. One of the best singers would lead, and two others kept time by striking one bone with another. The men took no part but hung around and listened. =Social organization= Each village had its chief, dog sled, and some villages, a second chief. Generally, the chief’s son succeeded to the office, but if a headman died without sons, the people, by common consent and without formal voting, selected from among themselves the man whom they regarded as best fitted for the place. The duty of a chief was to be the adviser of his people. When anything of great importance was to be decided, the village chief summoned the council, which comprised all the elder men. Each expressed his opinion, and the chief would go along with the consensus. =Social practices= Many of the social practices of the Kato tribe show how strongly they were influenced by the culture of northern-central California. Children of both sexes were required to observe certain rites at the age of puberty. Annually in midsummer, a group of boys, ranging from 12 to perhaps 16 years old, were led out to a solitary place by two men, one of whom was the teacher. Here, they received instructions in mythology and the supposed origin of customs, such as the mortuary rites, shamanistic practices and puberty observances. In the winter, these boys assembled again in the ceremonial house and remained there during the four winter months for instructions on tribal folklore. At puberty, a girl began to live a very quiet and abstemious life for five months, remaining always in or near the house, abstaining from meat, and drinking little water. She was not permitted to work, lest she catch a cold. Marriage was arranged between the two persons concerned, without consulting anybody else. Having secured a girl’s consent, her lover would sleep with her clandestinely at night, and at dawn steal away. The secret was preserved as long as possible, perhaps for several days, and the news of the match transpired without formal announcement, even to the girl’s parents, who would learn of their daughter’s marriage in this same, indirect fashion. His marriage no longer a secret, the young man might erect a house of his own. The bond was as easily loosened, for either could leave the other for any reason, the man retaining any male children and the woman the female children. Children were not regarded as belonging any more to the paternal than to the maternal side. When adultery was discovered, the only result was a little bickering and perhaps an invitation to the offender to take up permanent relations with the new love. =Funerals= In preparation for burial, a corpse was washed, clothed in good garments, and wrapped in deer skins. A pit was excavated on a dry hillside. The bottom was laid with a floor of poles, covered with bark and several deer skins. On this was deposited the corpse, which was covered with bark before the attendees covered it with earth. The entire population accompanied the bearers to the grave and wailed loudly. Women, and occasionally men, cut their hair short as a symbol of grief. For persons of prominence, a mourning ceremony would be held in the year following their death. This ceremony marked the end of the mourning period, and those who had hitherto wept became immediately cheerful and smiling. =Religion= The religious conceptions of the Kato tribe are grouped around two deities: Chénĕśh or T'cenes, the creator, who is identified with thunder and lightning, and his companion, Nághai-cho or Nagaicho, the Great Traveler.Pritzker 117 The latter is a somewhat mischievous personage, who in the myth, constantly urges Chénĕśh to acts of creation, while pretending that he has the knowledge and power to perform them, if only he has the desire to do so. In mythology, as in other phases of their culture, the Kato tribe showed their susceptibility to the double influence to which they had been exposed. With a creation story of the type prevailing in central California, they preceded it with an account of a race of animal-people who were swept from the earth by the deluge -- a theme characteristic of North Pacific Coast mythology. The creator, Chénĕśh, who is identified with lightning, dwelt in the sky. Below was an expanse of water, with a rim of land in the north. With his companion, Nághai-cho, he descended and turned a monstrous deer into land. Chénĕśh created the people, but Nághai- cho made the mountains and the streams. In everything, the latter tried to outdo Chénĕśh, playing the role (usually assigned to coyote) of the buffoon and trickster. Cahto people also belonged to the Kuksu religion. =Shamans= The shamans of the Kato tribe were of three classes: * 'ŭtiyíņ', who removed, by sucking, the foreign object that caused disease; * 'náchǔlna', who cured illness caused by woodland creatures; and * 'chģhályiśh', who were not healers at all but the restored victims of the diminutive \\"outside people\\", possessing the faculty of foreseeing the future in dreams. The ŭtiyíņ became medicine men by instruction, not by supernatural agencies. The two other classes acquired their power solely through dreams. When the old men of a village deemed it advisable to have a new ŭtiyíņ or \\"sucking doctor\\", either because of the death of some of the shamans or because of their waning power, the active and the retired shamans selected a promising young man. With his consent, they took him away from the village to a solitary place in the hills. The one who had been selected to be his instructor and \\"father\\" would pray and instruct the young man in the secrets of the medicine men. When a medicine man was summoned, any others of that profession who happened to be nearby could come and observe. If the medicine man first called upon could not effect a cure, he would ask the assistance of another. While engaged in his work, a shaman would beseech the unnamed powers for help, naming the various mountains of the region and asking the spirits resident there to assist him. He would also call on Nághai-cho, and occasionally on Chénĕśh. Population Estimates for the pre-contact populations of most native groups in California have varied substantially. Alfred L. Kroeber put the 1770 population of the Kato at 500.Kroeber, p.883 Sherburne F. Cook estimated the pre-contact populations of the Kato at 1,100.Cook, p.103 James E.

The title is also the name of the demonic entity central to the plot, now generally considered to be a figment of the novelist's invention. Plot summary Students at Bratsky Monastery in Kiev (Kyiv) break for summer vacation. The impoverished students must find food and lodging along their journey home. They stray from the high road at the sight of a farmstead, hoping its cottagers would provide them. A group of three, the kleptomaniac theologian Khalyava, the merry-making philosopher Khoma Brut, and the younger- aged rhetorician Tiberiy Gorobets, attracted by a false target, must walk extra distance before finally reaching a farm with two cottages, as night drew near. The old woman begrudgingly lodges the three travelers separately. At night, the woman calls on Khoma, and begins grabbing at him. This is no amorous embrace; the flashy-eyed woman leaps on his back and rides him like a horse. When she brom-whips him, his legs begin to move beyond his control. He sees the black forest part before them, amd realizes she is a witch ((, ved'ma). He is strangely envisioning himself galloping over the surface of a glass-mirror like sea: he sees his own reflection in it, and the grass grows deep underneath. He bears witness to a sensually naked water-nymph (a rusalka).: \\"\\"the mirror motif\\", etc. By chanting prayers and exorcisms, he slows himself down, and his vision is back to seeing ordinary grass over earth. He now throws off the witch, and rides on her back instead. He picks up a piece of log, and beats her. The older woman collapses, and transforms into a beautiful girl. Later, a rumour had circulated that the daughter of a Cossack chief (a sotnik in Gogol's original text, designated \\"sotnik\\" by , etc.) was found crawling home from a walk, badly beaten and near death, her last wish being for Khoma the seminary student to come pray for her at her deathbead, and for three successive nights after she has died. Sketch for the French edition of Viy, by Constantin Kousnetzoff Khoma learns of this from the seminary's rector who orders him to go. Khoma wants to flee, but he witnesses the bribed rector advising the Cossack henchmen to tie the student up, and resigns to go when he sees the kibitka wagon transport escorted by stalwart Cossacks. When he is shown the corpse, however, he finds it is the witch he overcame earlier in the story. Rumors among the Cossacks are that the daughter was in league with the Devil, and they tell horror stories about her evil ways, such as previously riding on another person, drinking blood, and cutting off the braids of village girls and Khoma is reluctant to say prayers over her body at night. On the first night, when the Cossacks take her body to a ruined church, he is somewhat frightened but calms himself when he lights more candles in the church to eliminate most of the darkness. As he begins to say prayers, he imagines to himself that the corpse is getting up, but it never does. Suddenly, however, he looks up and finds that the witch is sitting up in her coffin. She begins to walk around, reaching out for someone, and begins to approach Khoma, but he draws a circle of protection around himself that she cannot cross. The next night similar events occur but more horrible than before, and the witch calls upon unseen, winged demons and monsters to fly about outside the church, but Khoma is invisible for them. When the cossacks find the philosopher in the morning, he tries to escape but is captured and brought back to finish. On the third night, the witch's corpse is even more terrifying, and she calls the demons and monsters around her to bring into the church the Viy, the one who can see everything. Khoma realizes that he should not look at the creature when they draw his long eyelids up from the floor so he can see, but he does anyway and sees a horrible, iron face staring at him. Viy points in his direction, and the monsters leap upon him. Khoma dies from horror. However, the monsters miss the first crowing of the rooster and fail to escape the church before the light of dawn. The priest arrives the next day to find the monsters frozen in the windows as they tried to flee the church. The temple is forsaken forever, eventually overgrown by weeds and trees. The story ends with Khoma's other two friends commenting on his death and how it was his lot in life to die in such a way, agreeing that if he had not looked into Viy's eyes, he could have still survived.  Analysis  Scholars attempting to identify elements from folklore tradition represents perhaps the largest group. Others seek to reconstruct how Gogol may have put together the pieces from (Russian translations of) European literary works. There is also a contingent of religious interpretation present, but also considerable number of scholars delving in psychology-based interpretation, Freudian and Jungian.  Folkloric sources  Among scholars delving into the folkloristic aspects of the novella, Viktor P. Petrov tries to match individual motifs in the plot with folktales from Afanasyev's collection or elsewhere. Viacheslav V. Ivanov's studies concentrates on the Viy creature named in the title, and the themes of death and vision associated around it; Ivanov also undertakes a broader comparative analysis which references non-Slavic traditions as well. = The witch = The witch (, ved'ma or pannochka) who attempts to ride her would-be husband is echoed in Ukrainian (or Russian) folktale. The Ukrainian folktale translated as \\"The Soldier's Midnight Watch\\", set in Kiev, was identified as a parallel in this respect by its translator, W. R. S. Ralston (1873); it was taken from Afanasyev's collection and the Russian original bore no special title, except \\"Stories about Witches\\", variant c., tr., \\"The Soldier's Midnight Watch\\", pp. 273–282.Cited by Ralston as Vol. VII, No. 36c: Cf. The \\"Vid'ma ta vid'mak\\" (), another tale or version from the Ukraine, also features a \\"ride\\" of similar nature according to (1893)'s study of Gogol; this tale was edited by Drahomanov.Cited by as exhibiting a \\"similar ride\\": A listing of a number of folktales exhibiting parallels on this, as well as other motifs, was given by Viktor Petrov (pen names V. Domontovych)Petrov. PSS 2: 735–743 apud . and paraphrase of it can be found in Frederik C. Driessen's study (avail. in English translation). apud . = Viy = Viy, was the name given to the \\"chief of the gnomes\\" ( nachal'nik gnomov) by the \\"Little Russians\\", i.e., in Ukrainian folklore, or so Gogol has insisted in his author's note.; PSS 2: 175 , apud. However, given that the gnome is not a part of native Ukrainian lore, or of Eastern Slavonic lore in general, the viy has come to be considered a product Golgol's own imagination rather than folklore. : \\"However, Viy is unknown in Ukrainian folklore; so, in fact are gnomes.. Viy therefore is the creation not of the imagination of 'the folk' but rather of Golgol himself\\", requoted by The fact that viy itself shows little sign of existing in the region's folklore record is an additional plain reason for the skepticism. Thus Golgol's contrivance of the viy is the consensus opinion of other modern commentators also, who refer to the viy as a literary device,: \\"There is, evidently, no \\"Vij\\" known to exist in 'Little Russian' folklore2 nor are there any 'gnomes' in Slavic folklore in general. The footnote is thus likely to be a pseudo-documentary device..\\" and so forth. In the past, the viy creature had been an assumed part of genuine Malorussian (Ukrainian) lore; for instance, Scottish folklorist Charlotte Dempster mentions the \\"vie\\" of Little Russia in passing, and floats the idea of the phonetic similarity to the vough or vaugh of the Scottish Highlands.  Heavy eyebrow motif  The witch's husband in the Russian folk tale \\"Ivan Bykovich (Ivan the Bull's Son)\\", needed to have his eyebrows and eyelashes lifted with a \\"pitchfork\\" (). The aforementioned Viacheslav V. Ivanov (1971) is credited, in modern times, with drawing the parallel between Gogol's viy and the witch's husband, called the \\"old, old man\\" or \\"Old Oldster\\" (; staryĭ starik). apud and , the latter quoting a passage from the Russian tale. However this was perhaps anticipated by Ralston, who stated that the witch- husband (\\"Aged One\\") bore physical resemblance to what, he claimed, the Serbians called a \\"Vy\\",, p. 72 though he did not address resemblance with Gogol's viy directly. There also exists an old folk tradition surrounding St. Cassian the Unmerciful, who was said in some tales to have eyebrows that descended to his knees and which were raised only on Leap Year.Ivantis, Linda. Russian Folk Belief pp. 35–36  Psychological interpretations  Due to the \\"perverse\\"ly sexual nature of the central plot, namely Khoma's killing of the witch and her subsequent transformation into a beautiful girl, the novella has become open to various psychoanalytical (Freudian) interpretations, thus the attempt by some, to interpret Khoma's strife with the witch in terms of Oedipal desires and carnal relations with the mother.e.g. and apud Viy was proclaimed \\"the image of an inexorable father who comes to avenge his son's incest\\", in a comment near the end given without underlying reasoning, by Driessen (1965), citing This was modified to \\"a condensation of the [witch] who was ravished by [Khoma] Brut and the sotnik/father who has vowed to take revenge against the ravisher of his daughter\\".  Non-psychoanalitic interpretations  Leon Stilman has stayed clear of such psychoanalytic interpretations, and opted to take the eye motif as symbolic of Gogol's own quest for gaining visionary power (an \\"absolute vision\\" or \\"all-seeing eye\\"). = Related folklore creatures = The demons summoned into the church come from the Slavic superstitions of \\"midnight dead\\". Evil people, it was believed, automatically became Devil's subjects upon death. Earth would not hold them so that every night they would crawl out of their graves and torment the living. In the story, the demons have \\"black earth\\" clung to them, as if they crawled out of the ground. The water sprite (rusalka) seen by Khoma during his night ride bears relation to the \\"midnight dead\\". It was widely believed, in Russian and Ukraine, that rusalki were spirits of unbaptized children or drowned maidens, who were in league with the Devil. They were known to drown their victims or tickle them to death. They were described as beautiful, and deadly, and bear relation to the young version of the witch, and Gogol's frequent portrayal of women as beautiful yet evil. Incantations, exorcism, and the magic circle come from Ukrainian beliefs of protection from evil forces. The circle relates to \\"chur\\", a magical boundary that evil cannot cross. Even though Khoma died from fear, the creatures could not touch him. Additionally, the final notion that Khoma died only because he let fear win over him appears to stem from John of Damascus, who said \\"... all evil and impure passions have been conceived by [evil spirits] and they have been permitted to visit attacks upon man. But they are unable to force anyone, for it is in our power either to accept the visitation or not.\\" Film adaptations * Viy (1909 film), silent film adaptation by Vasily Goncharov.

Early English and British nationality law  British nationality law has its origins in medieval England. There has always been a distinction in English law between the subjects of the monarch and aliens: the monarch's subjects owed him allegiance, and included those born in his dominions (natural-born subjects) and those who later gave him their allegiance (naturalised subjects or denizens). A summary of early English common law is provided by Sir William Blackstone, who wrote about the law in 1765–69. Natural-born subjects were originally those born within the dominion of the crown (jus soli). Blackstone describes how various statutes extended the rights of the children of subjects born abroad, until \\"all children, born out of the king's ligeance, whose fathers were natural-born subjects, are now natural-born subjects themselves, to all intents and purposes, without any exception; unless their said fathers were attainted, or banished beyond sea, for high treason; or were then in the service of a prince at enmity with Great Britain.\\" In 1603 the crowns of England and Scotland were united in the individual of James VI and I, in what is known as the Union of the Crowns. In 1701, following some disagreement about the rules of succession to the crown, the English parliament passed the Alien Act 1705, providing that Scottish nationals would have alien status in the realm of England. However, this was superseded by the Act of Union 1707, which united the realms of England and Scotland. When the British Empire came into existence, the dominion of the crown expanded. British subjects included not only persons within the United Kingdom but also those throughout the British Empire (the British Dominion). This included both the colonies and the self-governing dominions, including Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Canada and Newfoundland. Note that the \\"dominions\\" of the Crown include not only Dominions but also colonies. Individuals born in the dominion were citizens regardless of the status of their parents: children born to visitors or foreigners acquired citizenship (see Jus soli). This reflects the rationale of natural-born citizenship: that citizenship was acquired because British- born subjects would have a ‘natural allegiance’ to the crown as a ‘debt of gratitude’ to the crown for protecting them through infancy. Therefore, citizenship by birth was perpetual and could not be, at common law, removed or revoked regardless of residency. By the same reasoning, an ‘alien’, or foreign born resident, was seen as unable to revoke their relationship with their place of birth. Therefore, at English common law foreign-born individuals could not become citizens through any procedure or ceremony. Some exceptions to this general principle existed in the common law, to recognise the situation of children born on foreign soil to English (or British after the Act of Union 1707) subjects. The earliest exception was the children of the King's ambassadors, who acquired English citizenship even if not born in England. A later, broader, exception was enacted by the Status of Children Born Abroad Act 1350 (25 Edw. 3 Stat. 1) to allow children born abroad to two English parents to be English. Later, the British Nationality Act 1772 (13 Geo. 3 c. 21), made general provision allowing natural-born allegiance (citizenship) to be assumed if the father alone were British. Generally then, there was no process by which a 'foreigner' not of British parents could become a British citizen. However, two procedures existed by which the individual could become a British subject with some of the rights of citizenship. Firstly, 'naturalisation' granted all the legal rights of citizenship except political rights (e.g. holding office). Naturalisation required an act of parliament be passed. Alternatively, denization allowed a person to gain the rights of citizenship other than political rights. Denization was granted by letters patent, and was granted by the monarch as an exercise of royal prerogative. Denization was therefore an exercise of executive power, whereas naturalisation was an exercise of legislative power. An example of the latter is the granting of English nationality to the Electress Sophia of Hanover, the heir to the throne under the Act of Settlement 1701. Naturalisation occurred by the passing, in 1705, of the Sophia Naturalization Act. This act granted English nationality to the Electress and to the Protestant \\"issue of her body\\", allowing all her future descendants a claim to English nationality. In 1957 Prince Ernest Augustus of Hanover successfully claimed citizenship of the UK & Colonies under this Act. Although the Act was repealed from 1 January 1949 by the British Nationality Act 1948, some descendants can still claim citizenship based on their parent's rights under the law as it existed prior to 1949. However, the Home Office believes that the Act does not generally give claimants a right of abode in the United Kingdom. Successful claims will normally be granted to only British Overseas Citizen status unless entitled to a right of abode in the UK under the Immigration Act 1971 as in force prior to 1983. Denization remained the usual form by which foreign-born subjects swore allegiance to the crown until general naturalisation acts were passed. Naturalisation Acts were passed in 1844, 1847 and 1870. The 1870 act preserved the process of denization. However, by introducing administrative procedures for naturalising non-British subjects naturalisation became the preferred process. The 1870 legislation also introduced the concept of renunciation of British nationality, and provided for the first time that British women who married foreign men should lose their British nationality. This was a radical break from the common law doctrine that citizenship could not be removed, renounced, or revoked. The loss of nationality at marriage was changed with the adoption of the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act 1914. This codified for the first time the law relating to British nationality. However, it did not mark a major change in the substantive content of the law. This was to wait until 1948. British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act 1914 This legislation came into force on 1 January 1915 as 4&5 Geo. c.17.legislation.gov.uk: \\"British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act 1914\\" (original as printed) British subject status was acquired as follows: * birth within His Majesty's dominions * naturalisation in the United Kingdom or a part of His Majesty's dominions which had adopted Imperial naturalisation criteria * descent through the legitimate male line (child born outside His Majesty's dominions to a British subject father). This was limited to one generation although further legislation in 1922 allowed subsequent generations born overseas to be registered as British subjects within one year of birth. * foreign women who married British subject men * former British subjects who had lost British subject status on marriage or through a parent's loss of status could resume it in specific circumstances (e.g. if a woman became widowed, or children immediately upon turning 21). British subject status was normally lost by: * naturalisation in a foreign state, such as the United States of America or France * in the case of a woman, upon marriage to a foreign man. Prior to 1933, British subject status was lost even if the woman did not acquire her husband's nationality. * a child of a father who lost British subject status, provided the child also had the father's new nationality. * renunciation.  British Nationality Act 1948  The Commonwealth Heads of Government decided in 1948 to embark on a major change in the law of nationality throughout the Commonwealth, following Canada's decision to enact its own citizenship law in 1946. Until then all Commonwealth countries, with the exception of the Irish Free State (see Irish nationality law), had a single nationality status: British subject status. It was decided at that conference that the United Kingdom and the self-governing dominions would each adopt separate national citizenships, but retain the common status of British subject. The British Nationality Act 1948 marked the first time that married British women gained independent nationality, regardless of the citizenship of their spouses. It provided for a new status of Citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies (CUKC), consisting of all those British subjects who had a close relationship (either through birth or descent) with the United Kingdom and its remaining colonies. Each other Commonwealth country did likewise, and also established its own citizenship (with the exception of Newfoundland which became part of Canada on 1 April 1949, Newfoundlanders hence becoming Canadian citizens). The Act also provided that British subjects could be known by the alternative title Commonwealth citizen. It was originally envisaged that all British subjects would get one (or more) of the national citizenships being drawn up under the Act, and that the remainder would be absorbed as CUKCs by the British Government. Until they acquired one or other of the national citizenships, these people continued to be British subjects without citizenship. However, some British subjects never became citizens of any Commonwealth country. Because the nationality laws of India and Pakistan did not provide for citizenship for everyone who was born in their countries (see Indian nationality law), the British Government refused to \\"declare\\" their nationality laws for the purposes of the Act, and therefore those British subjects from these countries who did not become Indian or Pakistani citizens were never absorbed as CUKCs by the British Government. They remained British subjects without citizenship. Due to the imminent withdrawal of the Republic of Ireland from the Commonwealth (which took effect 18 April 1949), special arrangements were made in s.2 of the Act to allow British subjects from Ireland to apply to continue to hold British subject status independently of the citizenship of any Commonwealth country. Until 1983 the status of British subjects without citizenship was not affected by the acquisition of the citizenship of a non-Commonwealth country. = Acquisition of Citizenship of the UK and Colonies = Under the 1948 Act, CUKC status was acquired by: * birth in the UK or a colony (which does not include birth in the Dominions or children of 'enemy aliens' and diplomats). The immigration status of the parents was irrelevant. * naturalisation or registration in the UK or a colony or protectorate * legitimate descent from a CUKC father for children born elsewhere. Only the first generation acquired British nationality automatically. Second and subsequent generations could do so only if born outside the Commonwealth (or Ireland) and registered within 12 months of birth or if the father was in Crown Service. * incorporation of territory (no persons ever acquired CUKC this way from 1949) * declaration * marriage Provisions for acquisition of CUKC by adoption were not included in the 1948 Act itself but were added soon after.  Requirements for Naturalisation or Registration  Citizens of Commonwealth countries, British subjects and Irish citizens were entitled to register as citizens of the UK and Colonies after one year's residence in the UK & Colonies. This period was increased to five years in 1962. Other persons were required to apply for naturalisation after five years residence.  Citizenship by Descent  Prior to 1983, as a general rule, British nationality could be transmitted from only the father, and parents were required to be married. Children born in Commonwealth countries or the Republic of Ireland could not normally access British nationality if the father was British by descent. Those born in non- Commonwealth countries of second and subsequent generations born overseas could be registered as British within 12 months of birth. However, many such children did not acquire a UK Right of Abode before 1983 and hence became British Overseas citizens in 1983 rather than British citizens. In the face of various concerns over gender equality, human rights, and treaty obligations, Parliament moved to act on these situations. On 8 February 1979 the Home Office announced that overseas-born children of British mothers would generally be eligible for registration as UK citizens provided application was made before the child reached age 18. Many eligible children were not registered before their 18th birthday due to the fact this policy concession was poorly publicised. Hence it was effectively reintroduced by the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 for those aged under 18 on the date of the original announcement, with the law adding a new section 4C to the British Nationality Act 1981. The Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 then expanded the earliest date of birth covered from 1961 to 1 January 1949, and elaborated in \\"a dense and at times impenetrable piece of drafting\\" http://www.bailii.org/scot/cases/ScotCS/2016/[2016CSIH24.html] on the section's approach, while also covering numerous additional and less common situations, and adding a good character requirement. Registration through this method is performed with Form UKM. After approval, the registrant must attend a citizenship ceremony. Since 2010, there is no longer an application fee (of £540). Applicants do however still have to pay £80 for the citizenship ceremony. From 6 April 2015, a child born out of wedlock before 1 July 2006 to a British father is entitled to register as a British citizen by descent under the Immigration Act 2014 using form UKF. Such child must also meet character requirements, pay relevant processing fees and attend a citizenship ceremony. However, if the applicant has a claim to register as a British citizen under other clauses of the British Nationality Act 1981, or has already acquired British citizenship after being legitimised, the application will be refused. Those with permanent resident status in the UK, or entitled to Right of Abode, may instead prefer to seek naturalisation as a British citizen which gives transmissible British citizenship otherwise than by descent.  Citizenship by Declaration  A person who was a British Subject on 31 December 1948, of United Kingdom & Colonies descent in the male line, and was resident in the UK & Colonies (or intending to be so resident) was entitled to acquire CUKC by declaration under s12(6) of the Act. The deadline for this was originally 31 December 1949, but was extended to 31 December 1962 by the British Nationality Act 1958.  Citizenship by Marriage  Women married to CUKCs had the right to register as CUKCs under section 6(2) of the 1948 Act.  Citizenship by Adoption  Before 1950 there was generally no provision to acquire UK citizenship by adoption: * between 1 January 1950 and 31 December 1982, a person adopted in the UK by a citizen of the UK & Colonies (CUKC) acquired CUKC automatically if the adopter, or in the case of a joint adoption, the male adopter, was a CUKC. * children adopted in the Channel Islands and Isle of Man on or after 1 April 1959 acquired CUKC on the same basis as UK adoptees on 16 July 1964, or the date of the adoption order, if later. In general a person acquiring CUKC by virtue of adoption in the UK, Channel Islands or Isle of Man, became a British citizen on 1 January 1983 Ireland Act 1949 The Ireland Act 1949 clarified the citizenship status of the British subjects and citizens and former subjects on the island of Ireland, and the application of the British Nationality Act 1948 to people born there. In addition, under section 5 of the act, a person who was born in the territory of the future Republic of Ireland as a British subject, but who did not receive Irish citizenship under the Ireland Act's interpretation of either the 1922 Irish constitution or the 1935 Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act (because he or she was no longer domiciled in the Republic on the day the constitution came into force and was not permanently resident there on the day of the 1935 law's enactment and was not otherwise registered as an Irish citizen) was deemed to be a Citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies. As such, the act has important implications for many of those emigrants who left Ireland before 1922 and some of their descendants in the Irish diaspora, some of whom may both be registrable for Irish citizenship and have a claim to British citizenship, through either automatic citizenship or citizenship by registration. In some cases, their descendants may have a claim to UK citizenship when the right to Irish citizenship has been lost because of the failure of previous generations to register births at the local Irish consulate.  Independence Acts  Many colonies became independent between 1949 and 1982. Under the independence legislation passed in the United Kingdom, a person connected with a particular colony generally lost CUKC on a specified date (which was normally that particular colony's date of attaining independence) if: * they had acquired, or would acquire, citizenship of that country upon or after independence; and * they did not have specified bloodline connections to the UK itself or a place which remained a colony (e.g., having a parent or a grandparent born in the UK or a place that remained a colony) Therefore, it was possible for CUKCs to lose the status even if they had migrated to the UK and acquired the right of abode. Only through naturalisation or registration could they regain CUKC (and the right of abode in some cases). Specific exceptions to the loss of CUKC on independence included: * persons from the Malayan states of Penang and Malacca who, because of the wording of Federation of Malaya Independence Act 1957, did not lose CUKC at independence on 31 August 1957, as the law only provided for \\"the Malay States\\" for nationality purposes, whereas Penang and Malacca, at the time, were parts of the Straits Settlement. These persons, together with those born between 31 August 1957 and 31 December 1982 with a CUKC father, form the largest group of British Overseas citizens today. Most also hold Malaysian citizenship. * CUKCs connected with South Yemen normally lost their CUKC status on 14 August 1968. However, those ordinarily residing in the UK, a colony or another protectorate on or before that date were exempted from the loss. * CUKCs from Cyprus retained CUKC if habitually resident elsewhere in the Commonwealth (except Cyprus) immediately before 16 August 1960. These people would become British Overseas Citizens after 1983 if they did not acquire the right of abode. * In 1981 the Independence Acts dealing with Belize and Antigua/Barbuda exempted persons who had acquired a Right of abode in the UK from loss of CUKC. Such persons would have become British citizens in 1983 due to their Right of abode status. The only British dependent territory that gained independence after 1982 is Saint Kitts and Nevis, which became an independent Commonwealth country on 19 September 1983. British Dependent Territories citizenship was withdrawn unless there was a connection with a remaining dependent territory. Those that had acquired British citizenship before independence and became also Saint Kitts and Nevis citizens upon independence, however, would no longer lose their British citizenship. In some cases (Singapore and the Federation of Malaya), citizenship statuses were created before independence was achieved. This resulted in unusual endorsements like \\"British subject: citizen of the State of Singapore\\" in British passports.. Indeed, treaties signed by the United Kingdom around this time reveal the existence of at least the following citizenship statuses: * British Subject * British Subject, Citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies * British Subject, Citizen of the United Kingdom, Islands and Colonies * British Subject, Citizen of the United Kingdom, Associated States and Colonies * British Subject, Citizen of the State of Singapore * British Subject, Citizen of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland * British Protected Person British Nationality Acts of 1958, 1964 and 1965 British Nationality Acts were passed in 1958, 1964 (twice) and 1965: * The British Nationality Act 1958 legislation dealt with Rhodesia, Ghana independence and reinstating temporarily some lapsed transitional registration entitlements * The British Nationality Act 1964 provided for resumption of CUKC where it was renounced to obtain another Commonwealth citizenship. It was no longer possible for a renunciation of CUKC to take effect if the person did not have another nationality. * The British Nationality (No 2) Act 1964 provided for British mothers to transmit CUKC status in cases of statelessness of an overseas born child. It also repealed section 20(4) of the 1948 legislation which allowed naturalised CUKCs resident for more than seven years outside the UK & Colonies to be deprived of CUKC in certain circumstances. * The British Nationality Act 1965 made provision for women married to British subjects without citizenship to acquire British subject status by registration  Commonwealth Immigrants Acts  Until the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962, all Commonwealth citizens could enter and stay in the United Kingdom without any restriction. The Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962 made Citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies (CUKCs) whose passports were not directly issued by the United Kingdom Government (i.e. passports issued by the Governor of a colony or by the Commander of a British protectorate) subject to immigration control. Those with passports issued at a British High Commission in an independent Commonwealth country or British Consulate remained free from immigration control. The 1962 Act also increased the residence period for Commonwealth citizens (plus British subjects and Irish citizens) applying for registration as Citizens of the UK and Colonies from one year to five years. The Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1968 sharpened the distinction between citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies (CUKCs) who had close ties with the United Kingdom and were free to enter, and those citizens who had no such ties and were therefore subject to immigration control. Particularly in the newly independent Commonwealth countries of East Africa, the result was that there were now citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies who had no right of residence anywhere. Immigration Act 1971 The Immigration Act 1971 developed this distinction by creating the concept of patriality or right of abode. CUKCs and other Commonwealth citizens had the right of abode in the UK only if they, their husband (if female), their parents, or their grandparents were connected to the United Kingdom and Islands (the UK, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man). This placed the UK in the rare position of denying some of its nationals entry into their country of nationality. (One consequence of this has been the inability of the United Kingdom to ratify the Fourth Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights, which guarantees the right of abode for nationals, a right which is widely recognised in international law.) Prior to 1983. the following people had the right of abode under the Act: * A citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies who was born, adopted, naturalised or registered in the United Kingdom. * A citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies who was born to, or legally adopted by, a parent who, at the time of the birth or adoption, was a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies born, adopted, naturalised or registered in the United Kingdom. * A citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies who was born to, or legally adopted by, a parent who, at the time of the birth, was a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies. That parent must have a parent who was a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies by birth, adoption, naturalisation or registration in the United Kingdom. * A citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies who by 1 January 1983 had been ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom for five years or more (all conditions of stay must have been removed prior to the end of the 5-year period). * A Commonwealth citizen who was born to, or legally adopted by, a parent who, at the time of the birth or adoption, was a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies by birth in the United Kingdom. * A female Commonwealth citizen or citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies who was, or had been, the wife of a man with the right of abode. * A citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies who was registered in an independent Commonwealth country by the British High Commissioner. The Act did not specifically mention the status of former CUKCs who were holding right of abode in the UK and who lost their CUKC status solely because their own country's independence, although it was implied that if the person had no claim to right of abode as a Commonwealth citizen, then these persons would no longer have right of abode unless they have reacquired their CUKC status. The following people did not have the right of abode simply by virtue of registration as a CUKC (but could hold it through United Kingdom descent or residence, or if a woman, marriage to a man with Right of Abode): * A woman who was registered under section 6(2) of the British Nationality Act 1948 on or after 28 October 1971, unless she got married before that date and her husband has the right of abode. * A minor child who was registered under section 7 of the British Nationality Act 1948 in an independent Commonwealth country by the British High Commissioner on or after 28 October 1971. The reason for these limitations is that under the 1948 Act, High Commissioners in independent Commonwealth nations had the right to register persons as CUKC. This was treated for the purpose of the 1971 Act as \\"registration in the United Kingdom\\" and hence without the special limitations on Right of Abode, that status would have been held by some CUKCs with no other qualifying ties to the United Kingdom. The most notable group over whom control was sought were the Ugandan Indians who were expelled from Uganda by Idi Amin between 1968 and 1972. As CUKCs who had passports issued by a British High Commissioner they were arriving in the United Kingdom in large numbers. A number of 'resettlement' options were looked at, including settling Indians on a suitable island in the dependent territories such as the Falkland Islands or Solomon Islands. Lord Lester of Herne Hill, QC, has written a detailed paper, \\"East African Asians versus The United Kingdom: The Inside Story\\", setting out the difficulties faced by the group. However, the concept of patriality was recognised as only a temporary solution, so the British government embarked on a major reform of the law, resulting in the British Nationality Act 1981.  British Nationality Act 1981  The British Nationality Act 1981 abolished the status of CUKC, and replaced it with three new categories of citizenship on 1 January 1983: *British citizenship, *British Dependent Territories citizenship (BDTC), which was renamed British Overseas Territories citizenship (BOTC) by the British Overseas Territories Act 2002 (see below) and *British Overseas citizenship (BOC). British Citizens are those former CUKCs who had a close relation with the United Kingdom and Islands (i.e. those who possessed right of abode under the Immigration Act 1971); BOTCs are those former CUKCs with a close relationship with one of the remaining colonies, renamed Overseas Territories; while BOCs are those former CUKCs who did not qualify for either British citizenship or British Dependent Territories citizenship. The law distinguishes between British citizen or British Overseas Territories citizen by descent and those who hold those statuses otherwise than by descent. Citizens by descent cannot automatically pass on British nationality to a child born outside the United Kingdom or its Overseas Territories (though in some situations the child can be registered as a citizen). British Overseas citizens cannot generally pass on British Overseas citizenship, except in limited cases to avoid statelessness or other hardship. It is possible to hold more than one of these citizenships simultaneously. In fact, since the British Overseas Territories Act 2002 granted British citizenship to all the Overseas Territories (except the Cyprus Sovereign Base Areas), most British overseas territories citizens also hold British citizenship. Additionally, a British Overseas citizen who acquires British citizenship will not lose British Overseas citizenship, although there is generally no added benefit from retaining this status. Those Commonwealth citizens and British subject already entitled to Right of Abode under the Immigration Act 1971 retained this status provided they did not cease to be Commonwealth citizens or British subjects after 1983. However, countries that joined the Commonwealth after 1 January 1983 are exempt from this scheme. These are South Africa, Pakistan, Namibia, Cameroon and Mozambique. Those who come to the UK under this scheme may claim state benefits if they can show that they intend to make the UK their permanent home. Commonwealth citizens who have the right of abode need to apply for a certificate of entitlement if they want to enter the UK. The certificate is a sticker which is placed inside a non-British passport. After five years living in the UK, a person who has moved to the UK under the Right of Abode can apply to naturalise as British citizen and obtain a British passport. = British Subject and British Protected Person = The 1981 Act retained the category of British subject without citizenship as British subject. British subjects are mainly people from the Indian sub-continent and Ireland. It ended the use of the term for those British subjects who had one of the various national citizenships, though the term Commonwealth citizen continues to be used in that regard. Persons who held British subject status based on connections with what is now the Republic of Ireland before 1949 remain entitled to resume that status if they wish. The status of British subject under the 1981 Act cannot be transmitted to children, although the Home Secretary has discretion to register a child as a British subject. This discretion is very rarely exercised. British subject status can be renounced, but cannot be resumed for any reason. British subjects (except those connected with Ireland) lose their British subject status automatically if they acquire any other nationality. For further information on the present use of the term \\"British subject\\", see British subject. The 1981 Act also retained another category, that of British protected person (BPP), which is not a form of nationality as such (BPPs were never British subjects), but a status conferred on citizens of states under British protection. It has been argued that since BPPs are not considered stateless, they must hold some form of nationality, and that nationality must be a form of British nationality. British Protected Persons are those who had a connection with a former British Protectorate, Protected State, League of Nations mandate or United Nations trust territory. These were mainly in Asia and Africa. British Overseas Citizens, by contrast, are those who have such a relationship with former British colonies. (Protectorates, Protected States, Mandates and Trust Territories were never, legally speaking, British colonies.) A British Protected Person will lose that status upon acquiring any other nationality or citizenship. = British National (Overseas) = The Hong Kong handover resulted in yet another nationality: British National (Overseas) or BN(O). There were some 3.5 million residents of Hong Kong who held British Dependent Territories citizen (BDTC) status by virtue of their connection with Hong Kong. Another 2 million other Hong Kong residents are believed to have been eligible to apply to become BDTCs. Upon handover, they would lose this status and became solely Chinese nationals. Uncertainty about the future of Hong Kong under Chinese rule led to the United Kingdom creating a new category of nationality for which Hong Kong BDTCs could apply. Any Hong Kong BDTC who wished to do so was able to acquire the (non-transmissible) status of British National (Overseas). = British Citizenship Legislation for Hong Kong = The handover of Hong Kong also resulted in: * the British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act 1990 and the associated British Nationality Selection Scheme; and * the Hong Kong (War Wives and Widows) Act 1996 which gave certain women in Hong Kong the right to register as British citizens based on their husband's or former husband's war service in defence of Hong Kong during the Second World War; and * the British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act 1997 which gave non-Chinese ethnic minorities in Hong Kong access to British citizenship In February 2006, British authorities announced that 600 British citizenship applications of ethnic minority children of Indian descent from Hong Kong were wrongly refused. The applications dated from the period July 1997 onwards. Where the applicant in such cases confirms that he or she still wishes to receive British citizenship the decision will be reconsidered on request. No additional fee will be payable by the applicant in such cases. Recent changes to India's Citizenship Act 1955 (see Indian nationality law) provide that Indian citizenship by descent can no longer be acquired automatically at the time of birth. This amendment will also allow some children of Indian origin born in Hong Kong after 3 December 2004 who have a British National (Overseas) or British Overseas citizen parent to automatically acquire British Overseas citizenship at birth under the provisions for reducing statelessness in article 6(2) or 6(3) of the Hong Kong (British Nationality) Order 1986. If they have acquired no other nationality after birth, they will be entitled to register for full British citizenship with right of abode in the UK.  British Overseas Territories Act 2002  The British Overseas Territories Act 2002 changes the British Dependent Territories to British Overseas Territories, and British Dependent Territories Citizenship to British Overseas Territories Citizenship. This change is supposed to reflect the no longer \\"dependent\\" status of these territories, but may create confusion due to the close similarity between the terms \\"British Overseas Citizen\\" and \\"British Overseas Territories Citizen\\". The Act also extends British citizenship to all British Overseas Territories Citizens the right to register as British Citizens, and thus acquire the right of abode, except those whose connection is solely with the military outposts known as the Sovereign Base Areas in Cyprus. A distinction of terminology is made between British Overseas Territories Citizens born before 1 January 1983, introduction of British Dependent Territories, Citizenship, who would previously have been Citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies, and those born after, and therefore who had not ever held right to freely enter and remain in the UK before 2002 (unless they also separately qualified as British Citizens or had \\"right to remain\\" stamped into their passports, to which they were entitled after five years legal residence in the UK). * Those persons who held British Overseas Territories citizenship (BOTC) on 21 May 2002 (except those solely connected with the Sovereign Base Areas) automatically acquired British citizenship on that date if they did not already possess it. Most people from Gibraltar and the Falkland Islands already held full British citizenship under earlier legislation, or had the right to register as British. * Persons who acquire BOTC after 21 May 2002 and do not already have British citizenship (mainly those naturalised as BOTCs after that date) may register as British citizens if they wish under s4A of the 1981 Act. Until their successful claim against the British Government in the High Court over their eviction from their Territory, those connected to the British Indian Ocean Territory which houses the United States military base of Diego Garcia were to be excluded as well, but are now included. The accession of the whole island of Cyprus to the European Union would possibly have made the sole exclusion of the Sovereign Base Areas untenable, as they would become the only Cypriots (as well as the only British Overseas Territories citizens) not to have the right to live and work in the United Kingdom. However, in 2004, only the Greek part of the island was admitted, and the issue has not surfaced.  Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002  This Act created a number of changes to the law including: = British Nationals with no other citizenship = The Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 has also granted British Overseas Citizens, British Subjects and British Protected Persons the right to register as British citizens if they have no other citizenship or nationality and have not after 4 July 2002 renounced, voluntarily relinquished or lost through action or inaction any citizenship or nationality. Previously such persons would have not had the right of abode in any country, and would have thus been de facto stateless. Despite strong resistance from Senior Officials at the Home Office, the then Home Secretary, David Blunkett, said on 3 July 2002 that this would \\"right a historic wrong\\" which had left stateless tens of thousands of Asian people who had worked closely with British colonial administrations. The Government of India has also issued clarifications in respect of people with these citizenships to assist with consideration of applications under the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. Sanjay Shah, a British Overseas citizen passport holder, spent 13 months living in the duty-free section of Nairobi's Jomo Kenyatta airport, petitioning for full British citizenship. This was granted on the grounds that he had already given up his former Kenyan citizenship. = Overseas born children of British mothers = The Act has also conferred a right to registration as a British citizen on persons born between 8 February 1961 and 31 December 1982 who, but for the inability (at that time) of women to pass on their citizenship, would have acquired British citizenship automatically when the British Nationality Act 1981 came into force. In adding a section 4C to the British Nationality Act 1981, a person is entitled to registration if: *the person was born after 7 February 1961 but before 1 January 1983; *the person was born to a mother who was a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies at the time and the person would have been a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies by descent if it had been possible for women to pass on citizenship of the United Kingdom and Colonies to their children in the same way as men could; and *had the person been a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies, they would have had the right of abode in the United Kingdom under the Immigration Act 1971 and would have become a British citizen on 1 January 1983. Registration under both these categories confers British citizenship by descent and hence those with permanent residence in the United Kingdom, or those with the right to take up permanent residence in the United Kingdom, may prefer to apply for naturalisation or section 4 registration instead. Both of these registration categories give British citizenship otherwise than by descent. (This right to registration under this measure was later amended by the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009, which moved the earliest date of birth covered from 1961 to 1 January 1949, and elaborated in \\"a dense and at times impenetrable piece of drafting\\" on the section 4C approach, while also covering numerous additional and less common situations, and adding a good character requirement. In 2018, the UK Supreme Court held that section 4C should be interpreted broadly.Under the UK Supreme Court's 2018 Romein interpretation of section 4C of the British Nationality Act 1981. ) =Deprivation of British nationality= Under amendments made by the Act, British nationals can be deprived of their citizenship if the Secretary of State is satisfied they are responsible for acts seriously prejudicial to the vital interests of the United Kingdom or an Overseas Territory. This provision applied to only dual nationals-—it is not applicable if deprivation would result in a person's statelessness. Prior to this law, British nationals who acquired that status by birth or descent (as opposed to registration or naturalisation) could not be deprived of British nationality. = Citizenship ceremonies = All new applicants for British citizenship from 1 January 2004 who are aged 18 or over must attend a citizenship ceremony and take an Oath of Allegiance and a Pledge to the United Kingdom before their grant of British citizenship can take effect * the requirement for a citizenship ceremony applies to applicants for registration as well as naturalisation * prior to 1 January 2004, British overseas territories citizens, British Overseas citizens, British subjects and British Nationals (Overseas), as well of citizens of countries sharing the Queen as Head of State (such as Australia and Canada) were exempt from taking the oath of allegiance. This exemption was abolished. Similar requirements are imposed on applicants for British overseas territories citizenship, with the exception that the Pledge is based on the relevant territory rather than the United Kingdom. It is unusual for adults to acquire British Overseas citizenship or British subject status (application must be made before age 18 and is very rarely granted); however, in such a case only an Oath of Allegiance would be required. = English language requirements = From 28 July 2004, English (or Welsh or Scottish Gaelic) language requirements for naturalisation applicants were increased: * the language competency requirement was extended to those applying for naturalisation as the spouse of a British citizen * evidentiary requirements were increased. = Life in the United Kingdom test = From 1 November 2005, all new applicants for naturalisation as a British citizen must (unless exempted) prove they have passed the Life in the United Kingdom test. * The test must be passed before application is made to the Home Office * Those who pass the test do not need to provide separate evidence of language competency * Those aged 65 or over may be able to claim exemption * Those who attend combined citizenship and English (or Welsh) classes may be exempted from the test Neither the language nor Life in the UK test requirements apply to those seeking registration (as opposed to naturalisation) as a British citizen. Note that passing the test is also required for anyone wishing to remain indefinitely in the UK, whether or not they apply for citizenship. E.g., a husband or wife of a British citizen will be deported if they do not pass the test in time. = Children of unmarried British fathers= With effect from 1 July 2006, children may acquire British citizenship automatically from an unmarried British father (or a British permanent resident if the child is born in the United Kingdom). Proof of paternity must be shown. Children born to unmarried British fathers before 1 July 2006 are not included in this provision. However they can be registered as British citizens upon application to the Home Office (if not British some other way), provided the child is aged under 18 and would have been British had the father been married to the mother. However, the agreement of the mother is needed. If the mother refuses then policy is for the home office to enquire of her reasons for refusal. If her reasons are deemed unreasonable registration may still be granted. Also, the minor can apply in his own right on reaching the age of 17. (As of 6 April 2015, a person over 18 years of age who was born out of wedlock before 1 July 2006 to a British father is entitled to register as a British citizen by descent under the Immigration Act 2014 using form UKF. Such child must also meet character requirements, pay relevant processing fees and attend a citizenship ceremony. However, if the applicant has a claim to register as a British citizen under other clauses of the British Nationality Act 1981, or has already acquired British citizenship after being legitimised, the application will be refused.) Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006 The Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006 made a number of changes to the law including: * allowing the Secretary of State to deprive a British national of his or her nationality on the basis of it being \\"conducive to the public good\\". This is a less stringent test than the requirement of the 2002 Act and came into force on 16 June 2006. * allowing Right of Abode to be revoked on the same basis * introducing a good character requirements for all acquisitions of British citizenship, with the exception of section 4B registration, registration on the grounds of statelessness and cases where the applicant is under 10 years old. This came into force on 4 December 2006.

Þorsteinn distinguished himself in Icelandic public life with his writings in newspapers, journals and publications.  His life and accomplishments  Early life = Þorsteinn was born and raised in Reykjavík, the capital of Iceland. His parents were Guðrún Vilmundardóttir and Gylfi Þorsteinsson Gíslason, a university professor and government minister. He was the brother of Vilmundur Gylfason, a politician, and Þorvaldur Gylfason, an economist. Þorsteinn graduated from the Menntaskólinn í Reykjavík gymnasium in 1961 and subsequently received a grant to study at Harvard University. He left Harvard with a B.A. degree in philosophy, having studied under the tutelage of Willard Van Orman Quine. He returned home for graduate studies in Icelandic, and later attended the University of Munich and Magdalen College, Oxford from 1965 to 1971. At Oxford, he studied under Gilbert Ryle and befriended well-known characters from philosophical circles, such as Alfred Jules Ayer. This influence affected his work in philosophy to a considerable extent. = Career = Þorsteinn worked as an assistant professor at the University of Iceland from 1971, and was made full professor in 1989. He was visiting professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the London School of Economics. Þorsteinn received a number of awards and acknowledgements for his works, amongst them the Þórbergur Þórðarson and National Icelandic Literature Prizes in 1997. In 1994, he was awarded the Knights Cross of the Icelandic Falcon by Icelandic president Vigdís Finnbogadóttir for his contributions to Icelandic culture and academia. = Works = Þorsteinn wrote 12 books on philosophy and philology, including An Essay on Man (1970), An Essay on the World (1992), Thinking in Icelandic (1996) and Justice and Injustice (1998). He also published over 37 academic papers in various philosophical journals and composed poetry and lyrics, either with musical composer Atli Heimir Sveinsson or to the music of Kurt Weill and Richard Wagner. His translations to Icelandic included On Liberty by John Stuart Mill, Søren Kierkegaard's Repetitions, Plato's Phaedo, Descartes' Meditations, all of whom were published by the Icelandic Literature Society, for which he served as a series chief editor for almost two decades. = Philosophy = Þorsteinn's philosophical work was mostly in the philosophy of language and mind and political philosophy. His method and style of philosophy was very much rooted in the analytic tradition, through influence from men such as W.V.O. Quine and Gilbert Ryle. He also found inspiration in the continental philosophers, especially from existentialism in the style of Søren Kierkegaard and Martin Heidegger, whose works he translated into Icelandic. Later on, his focus was on contemporary work by Elizabeth Anscombe, Donald Davidson, Saul Kripke, John Rawls, Philippa Foot, Charles Taylor and Richard Rorty. Þorsteinn's early works (An Essay on Man in particular) are in the style of 20th century logical positivism—highly suspicious of esoteric Hegelian metaphysics. He later turned away from comprehensive theories to focus on specific problems. He considered himself an analytic philosopher insofar as \\"the ideas that have proven to be the most fruitful and inspiring, have been those of scholars generally considered to be 'analytic philosophers'.\\" He usually said he was not much of a utilitarian neither in personal thinking nor politics and favoured deontology and virtue ethics. His final words when describing himself as a philosopher were: \\"I believe that no philosophical theory can avoid paying the utmost heed to the natural sciences.\\" = Death = Þorsteinn was diagnosed with terminal cancer of the stomach on 12 August 2005 and died four days later. His funeral took place in Reykjavík Cathedral.  Publications  Books = * Tilraun um manninn [An Essay on Man], Reykjavík 1970. * Þrætubókarkorn [Dialectic] (with P.T.

Patten, 244 F. 535 (S.D.N.Y. 1917), was a decision by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, that addressed advocacy of illegal activity under the First Amendment. Background In cases such as Abrams v. United States, 250 U.S. 616 (1919) and Gitlow v. New York, 268 U.S. 652 (1925) and others, the United States Supreme Court struggled to draw the line between politically unpopular speech and actual threats to national security. Masses Publishing Co. v. Patten greatly influenced the Supreme Court's eventual adoption in Brandenburg v. Ohio of the \\"incitement test\\" for advocacy of illegal activity. At issue in Masses Publishing Co. v. Patten was the federal Espionage Act of 1917, which prohibited citizens from counseling or advising violation of the law. The Court found that the New York postmaster's refusal to allow circulation of the antiwar journal The Masses under the statute violated the First Amendment. =Opinion= Learned Hand wrote the opinion: > To assimilate agitation, legitimate as such, with direct incitement to > violent resistance, is to disregard the tolerance of all methods of > political agitation which in normal times is a safeguard of free government. Judge Hand affirmed that if a citizen \\"stops short of urging upon others that it is their duty or their interest to resist the law,\\" then he or she is protected by the First Amendment. One may, for example, \\"admire\\" resistors of the draft, but may not, under the \\"incitement\\" test, \\"counsel or advise\\" someone to violate the law at a specific time and place.

He trained at the Paris Opera Ballet school, and became well known for his creative ballets. Life and work The son of shoe designer Rose Repetto, Petit was born in Villemomble, near Paris. He trained at the Paris Opéra Ballet school under Gustave Ricaux and Serge Lifar and began to dance with the corps de ballet in 1940. He founded the Ballets des Champs-Élysées in 1945 and the Ballets de Paris in 1948, at Théâtre Marigny, with Zizi Jeanmaire as star dancer. Petit collaborated with Henri Dutilleux (Le Loup - 1953), Serge Gainsbourg, Yves Saint-Laurent and César Baldaccini and participated in several French and American films. He returned to the Paris Opéra in 1965 to mount a production of Notre Dame de Paris (with music by Maurice Jarre). He continued to direct ballets for the largest theatres of France, Italy, Germany, Great Britain, Canada and Cuba. In 1968, his ballet Turangalîla provoked a small revolution within the Paris Opéra. Four years later, in 1972, he founded the Ballet National de Marseille with the piece “Pink Floyd Ballet”. He directed the Ballet National de Marseille for the next 26 years. For the décor of his ballets, he would work in close collaboration with the painter Jean Carzou (1907–2000), but also with other artists such as Max Ernst. The creator of more than 50 ballets across all genres, he choreographed for a plethora of famed international dancers. He refused the free technical effects; he did not stop reinventing his style, language, and became a master in the arts of pas de deux and of narrative ballet, but he succeeded also in abstract ballets. He collaborated also with the nouveaux réalistes including Martial Raysse, Niki de Saint Phalle and Jean Tinguely. Le jeune homme et la mort (“The Young Man and Death”) of 1946 (libretto by Jean Cocteau) is considered his magnum opus and it is also his most well-known work; the choreography and the costumes are of astonishing modernity. In his 1949 ballet Carmen, he made an unusual use of the en dedans, while he gave a non-figurative treatment to Turangalîla. Among the films to which he contributed are Symphonie en blanc by René Chanas and François Ardoin (1942 short film on history of dance) in which he appeared as a dancer; the choreography for the 1948 film Alice in Wonderland, The Glass Slipper in 1954, Anything Goes (with others)in 1956,Bfi archives> Roland Petit, accessed 3 April 2013 and Black Tights as choreographer, writer, and dancerBlack Tights at IMDB accessed 16 March 2015 in 1960. Honours  In 1994, he was awarded the Prix Benois de la Danse as choreographer. Personal life In 1954, Petit married the dancer Zizi Jeanmaire, who performed in a number of his works. His memoirs were published in 1993 under the title J'ai dansé sur les flots (English: I Danced on the Waves). He and Jeanmaire had one daughter, Valentine Petit, a dancer and actress.Photo of Zizi Jeanmaire with daughter Petit died in Geneva, Switzerland, aged 87, of leukemia.

Some time during ancient history, he formed a \\"triad\\" with Aramazd and Anahit. Vahagn was identified with the Greek deity Heracles. The priests of Vahévahian temple, who claimed Vahagn as their own ancestor, placed a statue of the Greek hero in their sanctuary. In the Armenian translation of the Bible, \\"Heracles, worshipped at Tyr\\" is renamed \\"Vahagn\\". All the gods, according to the Euhemerist belief, had been living men; Vahagn likewise was introduced within the ranks of the Armenian kings, as a son of the Orontid Dynasty (or Yervanduni dynasty, 6th century B.C.), together with his brothers — Bab and Tiran. Historian Movses Khorenatsi's report of an ancient song gives a clue to his nature and origin: : Ancient Armenian origin of Vahagn's birth song :In travail were heaven and earth, :In travail, too, the purple sea! :The travail held in the sea the small red reed. :Through the hollow of the stalk came forth smoke, :Through the hollow of the stalk came forth flame, :And out of the flame a youth ran! :Fiery hair had he, :Ay, too, he had flaming beard, :And his eyes, they were as suns! Other parts of the song, now lost, said that Vahagn fought and conquered dragons, hence his title Vishabakagh, \\"dragon reaper\\", where dragons in Armenian lore are identified as \\"Vishaps\\". He was invoked as a god of courage, later identified with Heracles. The Vahagnian song was sung to the accompaniment of the lyre by the bards of Goghten (modern Akulis), long after the conversion of Armenia to Christianity. The stalk or reed, key to the situation, is an important word in Indo-European mythology, in connection with fire in its three forms. Vahagn was linked to Verethragna, the hypostasis of victory in the texts of the Avesta; the name turned into Vahagn (Avestan \\"th\\" becoming \\"h\\" in Middle Persian), later on to take the form of Vahagn. See Վահագն for more on the origin of the name. The name of the Armenian princely house of Vahevunis is believed to derive from Vahagn. The Vahevunis were ranked high in the Royal Register of Armenia, recorded by King Valarshak. In pre-Christian Armenia, the Vahevunis hereditarily possessed the temple town of Ashtishat on the left bank of the Aratzani river and most likely also held the post of the Sparapet, i.e., the Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Armenian Army.

It is situated on the Ashford side of the city, and is in the North Downs area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, south west of Canterbury, England. The Great Stour Way path passes through the village. A paper mill in the village has specialised in the production of tracing paper since 1938. There are numerous arable farms and orchards in the parish. The village has an unmanned station, Chartham, and a manned level crossing. It has an outlying locality sharing in many of the community resources, Chartham Hatch. Nearby communities are Harbledown and Rough Common, Blean, and to the north Wincheap. HistoryToponymy= The earliest recorded form of the name is Certham. The name Chartham literally means 'Village on rough ground', and the word \\"Chart\\" is also found in other villages in Kent with this meaning. The Stone Street part of the name comes from Stone Street, a road and small hamlet that runs parallel to the A28 on the other side of the villages. =Modern day= The river provided power for the paper mills until some point before 1955. Paper making has been a major occupation for the last 625 years; the mill dates from the late eighteenth century. The dovecote at Burnt House Farm is not only notable for its building's architectural merit but is also a Scheduled Ancient Monument for its importance in sending homing birds to and from important envoys such as the Archbishop of Canterbury. Geography and economy Chartham is located on the Great Stour river scattered along the Ashford Road in Canterbury and on the vale of the Kent Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Its paper mill specialises in the production of tracing paper. There are numerous arable farms and orchards in the parish. The village is served by Chartham railway station which is one stop westbound from Canterbury West station on the high speed line to London, although high speed services do not stop here. Chartham is also on the western end of the 3-mile Great Stour Way cycle path to Canterbury City Centre. Being in such close proximity to the city, the village's economy is closely tied to Canterbury. Aside from this, there are several village stores, two pubs, a small venue and a vineyard. Governance At the national level Chartham is in the parliamentary constituency of Canterbury for which Rosie Duffield (Labour) has been MP since 2017. For European elections Chartham is in the South East England constituency. Chartham is also part of the electoral ward called Chartham and Stone Street. The population of this ward at the 2011 Census was 5,878. Demography In the census of 1801 the number of people present in the parish of Chartham, enclosing an area of about and including the settlement of Chartham Hatch, was given as 776, and this figure remained roughly stable until the late 19th century when a dramatic increase was recorded: in the census of 1881, the number was given as 2,473. LandmarksChurch= The Church of St Mary is located next to the village green and contains six bells, five of which were made by Joseph Hatch in 1605, which makes them the oldest complete set by the same bellfounder in Kent.Chartham Parish Design Statement, Canterbury City Council & Chartham Society, March 2005 It was built in approximately 1294 and features a number of brasses, including that of Sir Robert de Setvans (d 1306). The stonework of its chancel windows exhibit a form of tracery, known as Kentish or split cusp tracery, which originates here. The tower is 14th century and the renovation was in 1875 by Oxford University architect George Edmund Street. =Railway Station= The Chartham railway station lies one stop west of Canterbury West and has regular trains to London stations including London Victoria station and London Charing Cross railway station. The HS1 trains also pass through the station but do not stop here. Outlying areasShalmsford Street= The village is contiguous with the smaller Shalmsford Street to the west, and was until recently the location of St Augustine's Mental Hospital, formerly known as the East Kent Lunatic Asylum. The site on which St Augustine's stood has now become a housing estate. The village's Post Office used to lie on 105 Shalmsford Street but is now located at 14B Godfrey Gardens in the Chartham Downs housing area. In Shalmsford Street is also Chartham Primary School, in which Chartham Parish meetings are held.Chartham Parish Council website =Chartham Hatch= Chartham Hatch is the northern upper part of the village, also known as a hamlet, of around 200 houses. It is surrounded by small woods and its orchards of apples and pears. Village Hall, formerly the school, is in the centre. The famous North Downs Way passes through the village. =Horton= Horton or Horton Manor is a tiny hamlet northeast by the Great Stour Way with its weir, Grade II listed manor house, and scheduled ancient monument manor chapel remains, later which became an oast house and agricultural storage area. In 844 King Æthelwulf of Wessex granted land at Horton to Ealdorman Eadred. A translation of the text of Charter S 319 reads: \\"Bounds of Horton. On the east: the wood which is called down-grove. On the west: the [arch]bishop and Lulla jointly. On the southern side: the land of Lulla at Chartham. On the north: the land of Beornwulf, which he possesses in eternity.\\"The Electronic Sawyer: Online Catalogue of Anglo-Saxon Charters. S319 dated 844 Mystole House =Mystole and Thruxted= These hamlets are south west along the Great Stour and to the south east. Mystole is rich in heritage due to its focal point, Mystole House, a 16th-century historic building, with architectural Grade II* status and former appurtenances/outbuildings: Grade II* listed Mystole Coach House; its Park; listed orangery; tennis court; Archway Lodge; The Tetherings and Stable House. Thruxted itself has a large working farmhouse. = Chartham Downs = Built on the ground of the former mental asylum hospital, and sharing the name of the hospital, Chartham Downs is a large housing area to the north-east of the village. It encompasses the village post office and a local shop, a village hairdresser and salon, and 3 children's play parks. It lies on the North Downs Way, and is closer to Street End, Nackington and Thanington than to the opposite end of Chartham. This fact means that the estate whilst being part of Chartham in a political aspect, is in many ways cut off from the village. In 1997 development of the site for housing was begun. A few of the hospital buildings, including the administration block, the water tower, and the chapel, were retained but the rest were demolished. Although Canterbury City Council suggested that \\"a change of name would help in creating a new sense of identity\\", the site is known as St Augustine's Estate, however signs refer to the area as ‘Chartham Downs’.

Story as told in The Queen of the Damned  Maharet and Mekare were twin sisters and powerful witches living in a beautiful valley not far from Egypt six thousand years ago. They had curly red hair and green eyes. They were hereditary witches who could communicate with spirits. This attracted the attention of Akasha, the young queen of Kemet (now known as Egypt), who sent them an invitation to visit her when they were sixteen years old. They refused, sensing something ominous about the request. Akasha's next request came in the form of violence, when the twins were performing cannibalistic funeral rites for their mother. The queen, who had made a policy of stamping out ritual cannibalism, sent soldiers to their village, killing everyone in their path and dragging the sisters away. When the twins arrived in Kemet, they were looked on in awe and fear by all who saw them. These people had never seen red hair, and twins were taboo in the country. They answered with truth all the questions about spirits and gods put to them by the Queen. However, as their answers did not fit with Akasha's beliefs, they were labelled as blasphemers and were thrown into jail. The next morning, the Queen sent and put the same questions to them. Mekare called on a mischievous spirit named Amel, against the wishes of her sister, to display her power. This terrified the queen and her husband, King Enkil, and the twins were thrown into jail again for three nights and days before they received their punishment. Their punishment was to be raped by the King's steward, Khayman, in front of the whole court. Khayman was not one to accept violence and hated to do the task, but nonetheless had to obey his sovereigns' orders. The sisters were allowed to go home after the rape. After a difficult time, Maharet and Mekare eventually returned to their homeland, and there Maharet bore a child, Miriam, from Khayman's rape. The sisters put their trials behind them, and settled in to rebuild their life in the valley. But their peace was shattered a year later when Khayman arrived with an army. He took them back to Kemet, and on the journey there told them what had happened since their departure. The spirit Amel, furious at the humiliation of the twins, had run amok. He pestered the king and queen day and night, throwing and knocking things over, driving the pair mad. It had also been tormenting Khayman for his part in the rape, ripping his house apart and unearthing his father's body from its tomb. The nobles were displeased with their monarchs for bringing this trouble on them, and had plotted to kill them. The nobles had followed the royal couple to Khayman's house, where they were pleading with the spirit to let them be, and attacked them. But somehow Akasha and Enkil had survived, and all the nobles had been killed. Since then, the King and Queen had only been seen at night, and would not leave their palace. People were disappearing, and Khayman had resolved to bring the twins back in hopes that they could put an end to all these troubles. Upon reaching Kemet, the twins learn what has happened. Amel had developed a taste for blood, and one of his favorite torments was pricking people and causing them to bleed. Akasha and Enkil had been stabbed, and as they lay bleeding to death, the spirit of Amel could be seen in the form of droplets of blood. The spirit was seen to dive into Akasha's body, and she was somehow regenerated in a new form. Akasha fell upon Enkil, draining him of the blood that was left, and then feeding him her own. They were the first blood-drinkers. Akasha and Enkil had summoned the twins in the hope that the witches could enlighten them on the form that they had taken, and how they could satisfy their endless thirst for blood. Mekare grows angry after taunts from the Queen and King and curses the Queen, also labeling her the Queen of the Damned, promising her that when the time was right, she would return to destroy the Queen one day. The twins are thrown into jail to be put to death the next evening, but not before Mekare's tongue and Maharet's eyes were cut out. Three hours before dawn, Khayman came to them in despair. He had been betrayed by his king and queen, who had turned on him and made him one of them to test their new abilities. He made Mekare into a blood-drinker, and in turn she made Maharet into one. They escaped the prison and made more blood-drinkers as they went, hoping to create an army to defeat the evil king and queen. These later became known as the First Brood. Several weeks later, they were captured in Saqqara. The twins were put into stone coffins, and set adrift in the ocean, Mekare to the west, Maharet to the east. Maharet landed on the southern coast of Africa, and wandered for the next six millennia, tracking the bloodline of her daughter Miriam and searching for Mekare. It is not known for sure what became of Mekare, but cave paintings were found thousands of years later in South America of a red-haired woman. Similar evidence had been found in Africa. Maharet and others suspected that Mekare had gone wild and spent all that time in the jungles, avoiding civilization. Khayman wandered throughout Europe, losing his memory every few centuries. He did not see the twins again until The Queen of the Damned (1988), when Akasha brings them together in California. There, the vampires defeated Akasha. Mekare consumed Akasha's heart and brain, replacing her as the new Queen of the Damned.Rice, Anne (1988): The Queen Of The Damned. The third book in the chronicle of the Vampires. Warner Books, Clayton.  Further appearances  Maharet makes a brief appearance at the end of Memnoch the Devil, when she chains Lestat in a monastery after he goes mad from his latest adventure. She also appears briefly in Merrick, when she is said to have offered Louis her powerful blood only to be turned down. She appears again in Blood and Gold, where she receives new eyes at the end, and one more time through the use of email in Blood Canticle, offering her assistance to Lestat and Mona Mayfair in tracking down the Taltos. In the 2002 film Queen of the Damned, only Maharet makes an appearance, while her sister is never seen or even mentioned, and can be assumed to not exist in the film version of the story. Also, Maharet is portrayed with bleeding eyes in one scene with the young Jesse.

In order for RUDP to gain higher quality of service, RUDP implements features that are similar to TCP with less overhead. Implementations In order to ensure quality, it extends UDP by means of adding the following features: # Acknowledgment of received packets # Windowing and flow control # Retransmission of lost packets # Over buffering (Faster than real-time streaming) RUDP is not currently a formal standard, however it was described in an IETF internet-draft in 1999. It has not been proposed for standardization. Cisco RUDP Cisco in its Signalling Link Terminals (either standalone or integrated in another gateway) uses RUDP for backhauling of SS7 MTP3 or ISDN signaling. # RUDP v0 (no checksums) is used for SS7 MTP3 backhaul. # RUDP v1 (with checksum) is used for ISDN PRI backhaul. The versions are mutually incompatible and differ slightly from the IETF draft. The structure of the Cisco Session Manager used on top of RUDP is also different.

He is best known for having raised strenuous objections to the launch of the Space Shuttle Challenger months before the loss of the spacecraft and its crew in January 1986. Boisjoly correctly predicted, based on earlier flight data, that the O-rings on the rocket boosters would fail if the shuttle launched in cold weather. Morton Thiokol's managers decided to launch the shuttle despite his warnings. He is thus considered a whistleblower. Early life and education Boisjoly was born on April 25, 1938 in Lowell, Massachusetts. He grew up in the neighborhood of Belvedere as the son of a mill worker and one of three brothers. During high-school he played tennis. Boisjoly studied mechanical engineering at the University of Massachusetts Lowell.  Career  Boisjoly started his career at a used-aircraft company in western Massachusetts, before moving to California for work. He subsequently worked for companies in California on lunar module life-support systems and the moon vehicle. He later worked for Morton Thiokol, the manufacturer of the solid rocket boosters (SRBs) for the Space Shuttle program. =O-ring safety concerns= Boisjoly wrote a memo in July 1985 to his superiors concerning the faulty design of the solid rocket boosters that, if left unaddressed, could lead to a catastrophic event during launch of a Space Shuttle. Such a catastrophic event occurred less than a year later resulting in the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster. This memo followed his investigation of a solid rocket booster (SRB) from a shuttle flight in January 1985. During his investigation, he discovered that the first of a system of two O-rings had failed completely and that damage had been caused to the second O-ring. The O-rings were two rubber rings that formed a seal between two sections of the SRBs. The sections of the boosters were joined using tang and clevis joints and the rings were intended to seal the joint while allowing for the inevitable movement between the sections under flight conditions. By design, pressure from within the booster was to push a fillet of putty into the joint, forcing the O-ring into its seat. The system never functioned as designed. The rings were supposed to sit in a groove and seal the joint between the sections of the booster. It was found, however, that flight dynamics caused the joints in the SRBs to flex during launch, opening a gap through which rocket exhaust could escape. As the joints flexed, the rings would come out of their grooves and move to a new position in the joint, a process called extrusion. The extruded ring would form a seal in this new position, but during the time it took for the ring to shift, the joint was unsealed and hot gases could escape, a process called blow-by. These hot gases damaged the rings until the seal was achieved. Boisjoly's investigation showed that the amount of damage to the O-ring depended on the length of time it took for the ring to move out of its groove and make the seal, and that the amount of time depended on the temperature of the rings. Cold weather made the rubber hard and less flexible, meaning that extrusion took more time and more blow-by took place. He determined that if the O-rings were damaged enough they could fail. If the second O-ring had failed, the results would almost certainly have been catastrophic with the complete loss of the shuttle and crew seemingly the only outcome. His investigation found that the first O-ring failed because the low temperatures on the night before the flight had compromised the flexibility of the O-ring, reducing its ability to form a seal. The temperature at launch had been only , the coldest on record (until January 28, 1986). The first rubber O-ring had formed a partial seal, but not a complete one, but the second O-ring had held. Boisjoly sent a memo describing the problem to his managers, but was apparently ignored. Following several further memos, a task force was convened to investigate the matter, but after a month Boisjoly realized that the task force had no power, no resources, and no management support. In late 1985 Boisjoly advised his managers that if the problem was not fixed, there was a distinct chance that a shuttle mission would end in disaster. No action was taken. =Challenger disaster= Following the announcement that the Challenger mission was confirmed for January 28, 1986, Boisjoly and his colleagues tried to stop the flight. Temperatures were due to fall to overnight. Boisjoly felt that this would severely compromise the safety of the O-ring and potentially the flight. The matter was discussed with Morton Thiokol managers, who agreed that the issue was serious enough to recommend delaying the flight. NASA protocols required all shuttle sub-contractors to sign off on each flight. During the go/no-go telephone conference with NASA management the night before the launch, Morton Thiokol notified NASA of their recommendation to postpone. NASA officials strongly questioned the recommendations, and asked (some say pressured) Morton Thiokol to reverse their decision. The Morton Thiokol managers asked for a few minutes off the phone to discuss their final position again. The management team held a meeting from which the engineering team, including Boisjoly and others, were deliberately excluded. The Morton Thiokol managers advised NASA that their data was inconclusive. NASA asked if there were objections. Hearing none, NASA decided to launch the STS-51-L Challenger mission. Historians have noted that this was the first time NASA had ever launched a mission after having received an explicit no-go recommendation from a major contractor, and that questioning the recommendation and asking for a reconsideration was highly unusual. Many have also noted that the sharp questioning of the no-go recommendation stands out in contrast to the immediate and unquestioning acceptance when the recommendation was changed to a go. The concerns of Boisjoly proved correct. Initially, Boisjoly was relieved when the flight lifted off, as he had predicted that the SRB would explode before lift-off. Upon ignition, the O-ring was burned to ash, which formed a weak seal in the joint. At 58 seconds after launch, the shuttle was buffeted by high-altitude winds, the ash seal collapsed, and hot gases streamed out of the joint in a visible blowtorch-like plume that burned into the external hydrogen tank. At about 73 seconds, the adjacent SRB strut gave way and the vehicle quickly disintegrated. Later career After President Ronald Reagan ordered a presidential commission to review the disaster, Boisjoly was one of the witnesses called. He gave accounts of how and why he felt the O-rings had failed, and argued that the caucus called by Morton Thiokol managers, which resulted in a recommendation to launch, was an \\"unethical decision-making forum resulting from intense customer intimidation.\\" After the commission gave its findings, Boisjoly found himself shunned by colleagues and managers and resigned from the company. Boisjoly became a speaker on workplace ethics. For his honesty and integrity both leading up to and directly following the shuttle disaster, Boisjoly received the Award for Scientific Freedom and Responsibility by the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1988. When Boisjoly left Morton Thiokol, he took 14 boxes containing every note and paper he received or sent in seven years. On May 13, 2010, he donated his personal memoranda—six boxes of personal papers, including memos and notes from his congressional testimony—to Chapman University in Orange, California. Rand Boyd, the special- collections and archival librarian at Chapman's Leatherby Libraries, said the materials will be catalogued and archived. They can now be viewed by library visitors.Fields, Eugene W., \\"Chapman receives papers from Challenger disaster\\", The Orange County Register, May 13, 2010 9:37 p.m.http://www1.chapman.edu/library/archives/boisjoly.html After leaving Morton Thiokol, Boisjoly founded a forensic engineering firm and was frequently invited to speak on leadership ethics.  Personal life  Boisjoly married his wife Roberta in 1963. The couple had two daughters and at the time of his death eight grandchildren. Boisjoly died of cancer of the colon, kidneys, and liver on January 6, 2012 in Nephi, Utah. Depiction in media In the 1990 made-for-television film Challenger, Boisjoly was portrayed by actor Peter Boyle.

His grandfather Ivan Antonovych Dragomirecki-Mockewicz after being granted a noble title in 1786, soon requested to change his name to a Russified one as Dragomirov. Army careerTraining and staff positions= Dragomirov entered the Guard infantry in 1849, becoming second lieutenant in 1852 and lieutenant in 1854. In the latter year he was selected to study at the Nicholas Academy (a staff college), and here he distinguished himself so much that he received a gold medal, an honor which, it is stated, was paid to a student of the academy only twice in the 19th century. In 1856, Dragomirov was promoted to staff-captain and in 1858 to full captain, being sent in the latter year to study the military methods in vogue in other countries. He visited France, England, and Belgium, and wrote voluminous reports on the instructional and maneuvre camps of these countries at Châlons, Aldershot, and Beverloo. In 1859, he was attached to the headquarters of the King of Sardinia Victor Emmanuel II during the campaign of Magenta and Solferino, and immediately upon his return to Russia he was sent to the Nicholas Academy as professor of tactics. Dragomirov played a leading part in the reorganization of the educational system of the army, and acted also as instructor to several princes of the imperial family. This post he held until 1863, when, as a lieutenant colonel, he took part in the suppression of the Polish insurrection of 1863-1864, returning to St. Petersburg in the latter year as colonel and chief of staff to one of the Guard divisions. During the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, Dragomirov was attached to the headquarters of the Second Prussian army. He was present at the battles on the upper Elbe and at Königgrätz, and his comments on the operations which he witnessed are of the greatest value to the student of tactics and of the war of 1866. =Active service= The crossing of the Danube at Zimnitza, circa 1877 In 1868, he was made a major general, and in the following year became chief of staff in the Kiev military circumscription. In 1873, Dragomirov was appointed to command the 4th division, and in this command he distinguished himself very greatly in the Russo-Turkish War, 1877–1878. The 4th division led the way at the crossing of the Danube at Zimnitza; Dragomirov being in charge of the delicate and difficult operation of crossing and landing under fire, and fulfilling his mission with complete success. Later, after the reverses before Plevna, he, with the cesarevich and Generals Eduard Totleben and Dmitry Milyutin, strenuously opposed the suggestion of the Grand Duke Nicholas that the Russian army should retreat into Romania, and the demoralization of the greater part of the army was not permitted to spread to Dragomirov's division, which retained its discipline unimpaired and gave a splendid example to the rest. He was wounded at the Shipka Pass, and, though promoted lieutenant general soon after this, was not able to see further active service. He was also made adjutant general to the tsar and chief of the 53rd Volhynia regiment of his old division. For eleven years thereafter General Dragomirov was chief of the Nicholas Academy, and it was during this period that he collated and introduced into the Russian army all the best military literature of Europe, and in many other ways was active in improving the moral and technical efficiency of the Russian officer-corps, especially of the staff officer. In 1889, Dragomirov became commander-in-chief of the Kiev military district, and governor general of Kiev, Podolsk, and Volhynia, retaining this post until 1903. He was promoted to the rank of general of infantry in 1891. His advanced age and failing health prevented his employment at the front during the Russo- Japanese War of 1904–1905, but his advice was continually solicited by the general headquarters at St. Petersburg, and while he disagreed with General Kuropatkin in many important questions of strategy and military policy, they both recommended a repetition of the strategy of 1812, even though the total abandonment of Port Arthur was involved therein. Dragomirov died at Konotop on 28 October 1905. In addition to the orders which he already possessed, he received in 1901 the Order of St. Andrew. The portrait of Dragomirov's daughter Sofia, by Ilya Repin Works on military organization His larger military works were mostly translated into French, and his occasional papers, extending over a period of nearly fifty years, appeared chiefly in the Voienni Sbornik and the Razvedschik; his later articles in the last-named paper were, like the general orders he issued to his own troops, attentively studied throughout the Russian army. His critique of Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace attracted even wider attention. Dragomirov was, in formal tactics, the head of the orthodox school. His conservatism was not, however, the result of habit and early training, but of deliberate reasoning and choice. His model was, as he admitted in the war of 1866, the British infantry of the Peninsular War, but he sought to reach the ideal, not through the methods of repression against which the advanced tacticians revolted, but by means of thorough efficiency in the individual soldier and in the smaller units. He inculcated the offensive at all costs, and the combination of crushing short range fire and the bayonet charge. He carried out the ideas of Suvorov to the fullest extent, and many thought that he pressed them to a theoretical extreme unattainable in practice. His critics, however, did not always realize that Dragomirov depended, for the efficiency his unit required, on the capacity of the leader, and that an essential part of the self-sacrificing discipline he exacted from his officers was the power of assuming responsibility. The details of his brilliant achievement of Zimnitza suffice to give a clear idea of Dragomirov's personality and of the way in which his methods of training conduced to success. Family He had two sons who entered the military: * Lieutenant-General Vladimir Mikhailovich Dragomirov (1867—1928) * General of Infantry Abraham Mikhailovich Dragomirov (1868—1955) He also had a daughter, Sofia.

Riggs was originally played by Mel Gibson in all four films from 1987 to 1998, and later by Clayne Crawford in the Fox television series from 2016 to 2018. Originally a member of the Los Angeles Police Department's Narcotics Division, upon being reassigned to the Homicide Division, Riggs is partnered up with strait-laced sergeant Roger Murtaugh. Riggs and Murtaugh remain partners and best friends throughout the film series.  Career  Military career = Riggs joined the U.S. Army at age 19, eventually becoming a member of the U.S. Army Special Forces, receiving specialized training in weaponry and hand-to- hand combat. These skills would later serve him well when he became a police officer. Most of Riggs's time in special forces was in Vietnam, where he served as an assassin under the CIA's \\"Phoenix Project\\". The first time he became a killer when he shot a man to death with a sniper rifle from a long distance (1000 yards) in Laos; while his ability as a trained killer would later affect his mental health, he thought of it as \\"the only thing I was ever really good at\\". = Family = In 1984, Riggs's wife, Victoria Lynn, dies in a car accident, sending him into a deep depression. Driven by grief to the brink of suicide, he regularly puts himself (and anyone else near him) in danger, hoping someone will kill him. This total disregard for his own life makes him completely fearless, turning him into a \\"Lethal Weapon\\". By the end of the first movie, however, he has vowed to move on with his life. In the second film, it is revealed that Victoria was actually murdered during an attempt on Riggs's life. = In the films = In Lethal Weapon, Riggs is transferred from the narcotics division to the homicide division after a shooting incident. He is partnered with Detective Sergeant Roger Murtaugh in hopes that the older, more mature veteran will keep him in line. After a rough start, the two become best friends, even though Riggs always gets on Murtaugh's nerves. By the end of the first film, the two have worked together to rescue Murtaugh's daughter, who had been kidnapped by drug lords and mercenaries. In Lethal Weapon 2, Riggs discovers that South African crime lord Arjen Rudd, whom he and Murtaugh are pursuing, ordered Riggs's death in 1984. Rudd's enforcer, Pieter Vorstedt, killed Victoria Riggs by mistake and made the murder look like an automobile accident to cover up their involvement. After avenging the deaths of his wife and Rika van den Haas (whom Riggs had become involved with romantically before she, too, was murdered by Rudd and his minions), he is able to move on with his life. Meanwhile, Riggs and Murtaugh are assigned to protect a comical federal witness, Leo Getz, (played by Joe Pesci) whom they ultimately become close friends with. He meets Sgt. Lorna Cole (played by Rene Russo), an internal affairs officer, in Lethal Weapon 3 during an investigation into the disappearance of weapons from LAPD impound. The two make an immediate connection and work closely together to clear Murtaugh's name after he is forced to kill his son's friend in self- defense. Riggs and Cole become romantically involved and move in together after the end of the film. In Lethal Weapon 4, Riggs and Cole are still living together, and she is pregnant with their child, but they have dodged the issue of marriage. Both Riggs and Murtaugh are promoted to captain by the fourth film in order to keep them out of trouble, but are demoted back to sergeants at the end of the film. Leo helps Riggs finally make peace with his wife's death; Riggs marries Cole while she is giving birth to their son.  Television series  In a March 10, 2016 newspaper article, the plot for the television pilot is as follows: \\"when Texas cop and former Navy SEAL Martin Riggs...suffers the loss of his wife and baby, he moves to Los Angeles to start anew. There, he gets partnered with LAPD detective Roger Murtaugh...who, having recently suffered a \\"minor\\" heart attack, must avoid any stress in his life.\\" Riggs is ultimately killed at the end of Season 2, when he is shot in the chest by his half-brother, Garrett, while visiting his wife's grave.

Composed in collaboration with Carl Davis to commemorate The Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra's 150th anniversary, the project received a large amount of media attention upon its unveiling in June 1991. Recording This recording was captured at the oratorio's dress rehearsal and premiere at Liverpool Cathedral with McCartney in attendance and features noted professional classical singers Kiri Te Kanawa, Jerry Hadley, Sally Burgess and Willard White re-enacting the roles in the oratorio. The recording was engineered by John Timperley. Led Zeppelin: Achilles Last Stand, 1996 - 2015 Music and story Consisting of eight movements, the story of the oratorio loosely follows McCartney's own lifeline, with the main character, Shanty, who is born in 1942 in Liverpool, raised to believe that \\"being born where you are born carries with it certain responsibilities\\". After his school days where he often \\"sagged off\\" (Liverpool slang for skipping class), Shanty began working and meets his future bride, Mary Dee. Following the death of his father, Shanty and Mary Dee are married and are forced to deal with the rigours of balancing a happy marriage and their careers. Amid a quarrel, Mary Dee reveals that she is pregnant and after surviving a nearly fatal accident, gives birth to their son. Thus, the cycle of life in Liverpool carries on. Reception The commercial reaction for the work was strong, with the oratorio spending many weeks atop the classical charts worldwide, and even charting at number 177 in regular album chart in the US. Critical reaction was less positive, the virtually unanimous verdict being that the work, while attractive, was simplistic, overlong and, given its aspirations, insubstantial.New York Times ReviewThe Guardian ReviewGramophone review of recording Track listing All pieces by Paul McCartney and Carl Davis.

While technically an adoption is disrupted only when it is abandoned by the adopting parent or parents before it is legally completed (an adoption that is reversed after that point is instead referred to in the law as having been dissolved), in practice the term is used for all adoptions that are ended (more recently, among families disrupting, the euphemism \\"re-homing\\" has become current). It is usually initiated by the parents via a court petition, much like a divorce, to which it is analogous. While rarely discussed in public, even within the adoption community, the practice has become far more widespread in recent years, especially among those parents who have adopted from Eastern European countries, particularly Russia and Romania, where some children have suffered far more from their institutionalization than their parents were led to believe. Reasons for disruption Despite the intense and careful screening that most who wish to adopt children must go through, sometimes the adoption does not succeed. The child may have developmental or psychological issues that the parents cannot handle, had not been informed of prior to the adoption, or both. Or the parents may have had unrealistic expectations of the child, and they just may not get along. The adoptive parents themselves may have psychological or family issues themselves that led them down the path to adopt. These adoptive parents adopt thinking that the new child in their life will somehow enhance their life. Aftermath of disruption A child who is disrupted is usually put first into foster care, pending placement with a new family, unless they reach the age of 18 and legally become adults before this happens. In more and more recent disruptions, however, the disrupting adopters have been in direct contact with a family wishing to adopt and the child can be directly adopted by the new family. Some adoption agencies and facilitators have even begun specializing in post-disruption placements. If the child was placed privately, either through a lawyer or an adoption agency, that party is usually required by law to ensure a second placement of the child. However, that requirement is not always enforced, and many parents of Eastern European adoptees in particular have found their agencies to be of no help in finding a new home for their children. Some don't find state social-services agencies to be much help either, since they're already so overwhelmed and they would have to pay child support. An underground, possibly illegal, network has arisen in the U.S. over the past decade to help these parents disrupt their adoptions, authorities believe. Some of the people in this have taken in large numbers of children at the same time and have sometimes been arrested for child abuse and neglect. Attitudes toward disruption Few parents who have disrupted adoptions have been willing to talk about the process, since it carries a strong social stigma. It is seen by many as essentially legally sanctioned abandonment, especially since there is no corresponding legal procedure available for biological parents who find their children beyond their ability to handle, apart from giving their children up for adoption. Those who do disrupt and discuss it describe the experience as, unsurprisingly, extremely painful, almost like a death in the family, and shameful but ultimately worth it for both the parent and the child. This resolution, however, usually cannot be reached without undergoing extensive counseling and therapy. High-profile disruptions One of the rare public accounts of a disruption took place in 2000 when the CBS News program 48 Hours told the story of Jesse and Crystal Money, an Atlanta-area couple who ultimately decided to disrupt the adoption of their nine-year-old Russian-born daughter and return her to the orphanage in Moscow she had previously lived in. The girl had severe reactive attachment disorder and the family feared for their physical safety due to her increasing violence. Since the girl had not acquired U.S. citizenship, her treatment options for that were more limited than they might have been for a domestically-born child. An Indonesian boy adopted by an Irish man, Joe Dowse, and his Azerbaijani wife, Lala. Tristan Dowse was abandoned at the Indonesian orphanage from where he had been obtained and adopted, when, according to the Dowses, the adoption \\"hadn't worked out.\\" At that stage, his adoption had been recognised by the Irish Adoption Board and he had been granted Irish citizenship. He could only speak English. In 2005, investigative journalist Ann McElhinney and Irish Production Company Esras Films reunited the young boy with his natural mother, Suryani. The resulting documentary “The Search for Tristan's Mum” was broadcast by Irish television station RTÉ. In 2006, an Irish court ordered the Dowses to pay an immediate lump sum of €20,000 to Tristan, maintenance of €350 per month until he is 18 years of age, and a further lump sum of €25,000 when he reaches the age of 18. In addition, Tristan would remain an Irish citizen and enjoy all the rights to the Dowses’ estate. Tristan’s adoption was struck off the Register of Foreign Adoptions held by the Irish Adoption Board and Suryani was appointed his sole legal guardian. In 2010, seven-year-old Artyom Savelyev/Justin Hansen's adoptive mother, Torry Ann Hansen, sent him back to Moscow alone with a note explaining why she no longer wanted him. After this incident, Russian Children's Ombudsman, Pavel Astakhov, said: \\"We must, as much as possible, keep our children in our country\\" and urged for more restrictions on international adoptions in Russia. The Chairwoman of the Russian parliamentary committee on family and children, Yelena Mizulina, pointed out that 30,000 children were sent back to institutions by their Russian adoptive, foster, or guardianship families in the last three years. She added: “Specialists call such a boom in returns a humanitarian catastrophe.” In 2020, it emerged that YouTubers Myka Stauffer and her husband had decided to \\"rehome\\" their child, Huxley, who was adopted by the couple from China in 2017. The Ohio-based couple had made popular videos on YouTube featuring their son, Huxley, which attracted millions of views. 27 of these videos were related to their \\"adoption journey\\", with one video titled \\"Huxley's EMOTIONAL Adoption VIDEO!! GOTCHA DAY China Adoption\\" having been viewed more than 5.5 million times. The couple was aware the child has mental disabilities before the adoption but had decided to proceed after \\"God softened [their] hearts\\". After medical professionals determined these disabilities specifically include autism and a brain cyst, the couple proceeded with rehoming when told \\"he needed a different fit\\". Statistics Since no records are kept or required to be kept of how many disruptions occur beyond those filed in court, which are confidential, there is no way to be sure how many are occurring. Anecdotal evidence, however, has suggested that while they may have decreased as a whole through 1997 (when the Adoption and Safe Families Act was passed), for adoptions of Eastern-European born children they may well have increased, and thus the rate may have stabilized. A U.S. Department of Health and Human Services review of what was known as of 2004 suggests that overall, 10-25% of adoptions are disrupted or dissolved, and that the rate tends to rise with the age of the child at adoption. It admitted that much data remains to be collected before any clear policies to prevent disruptions can be formulated and implemented.https://web.archive.org/web/20051018033838/http://naic.acf.hhs.gov/pubs/s_disrup.cfm A similar review in 2002 by the British Department for Education and Skills, done to lobby for changes in data collection procedures, also reported the lack of any centrally collected data https://web.archive.org/web/20050802073925/http://www.dfes.gov.uk/adoption/adoptionreforms/consult.shtml ReferencesExternal links *Disrupted Placement Cases *Disruption at nurtureadopt.com. *Directory of disruption-related resources *Explanation of disruption process *.PDF on after care for disrupting parents and disrupted adoptees Category:Adoption law Category:Family disruption ","title":"Disruption (adoption)"},{"id":"2483440","text":"Darrell L.

He has served as a corresponding editor for Christianity Today, and he has published articles in the Los Angeles Times and The Dallas Morning News. Bock is known for his work concerning The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown. In a response to the theological implications of the novel, Bock wrote Breaking the Da Vinci Code, his best-selling work to date. The book challenges the historicity of various extra-biblical ideas expressed in The Da Vinci Code, most notably the supposed marriage of Jesus to Mary Magdalene. He also has written many pieces for beliefnet.com and ChristianityToday.com. Bock also wrote The Missing Gospels, which argues for the existence and legitimate primacy of early Christian orthodoxy over non-canonical gospels and beliefs. On May 17, 2006, immediately before the film The Da Vinci Code opened, Bock appeared on the TV show Nightline, talking about his book and about the movie. Bock has debated agnostic biblical scholar Bart Ehrman on whether certain epistles in the New Testament have been forged. In 2012, Darrell Bock became the executive director of cultural engagement at the Hendricks Center at DTS. He is also a host of The Table Podcast, Dallas Theological Seminary's weekly cultural engagement show. The other hosts of the podcast are Mikel Del Rosario, Bill Hendricks, and Kymberli Cook.

He exhibited his work in avant-garde circles internationally and in New York City during the early twentieth century. Highly respected today, his work met with little critical or commercial success in his lifetime, and he died, a suicide, at the age of sixty-four. Biography Carousel, c. 1901-1902, Brooklyn Museum \\"An Arrangement\\". 1901; oil on cardboard Landscape of Provence, c. 1912-1922, Reynolda House Museum of American Art Maurer was born in New York City. He was the son of German-born Louis Maurer, a lithographer with a pronounced disdain for modern art. At age sixteen, Maurer had to quit school to work at his father's lithographic firm. In 1897, after studying with the sculptor John Quincy Adams Ward and painter William Merritt Chase, Maurer left for Paris, where he stayed the next four years, joining a circle of American and French artists. Finding the instruction at the Academie Julian too limited, he spent most of his time copying in the Louvre. His self-portrait from that time expresses the 'youthful optimism\\" of that period of his life.Deeds, p. 70. At the time, Maurer worked in a conventional but self-assured realist style.Biographical information for this entry is taken from Elizabeth McCausland, A.H. Maurer (New York: Wyn, 1951). Maurer's An Arrangement, which was compared to the work of Whistler in its color sense and fluid handling of paint, made his reputation in the American art world. Comparisons were made to Chase and Sargent.Loughery, p. 121. The painting received first prize at the 1901 Carnegie International Exhibition, whose jurors included Thomas Eakins and Winslow Homer. It was an honor that promised a bright future, and Maurer hoped it would convince his demanding and skeptical father that he could, in fact, paint. Other awards received by Maurer included the Inness Jr. Prize of the Salmagundi Club in 1900 and a bronze medal at the Pan-American Exposition at Buffalo, New York in 1901. In 1905, he won the third medal at the Liege (Belgium) Exposition and a gold medal at the International Exposition in Munich. A successful future beckoned. Yet, at age thirty-six, in Paris, deviating from what everyone (including himself, at times) called \\"acceptable\\" painting styles, Maurer changed his methods sharply and from that point on painted only in a cubist and fauvist manner. His break from realism and new commitment to modernism, fostered by exposure to the art collected by his friends Gertrude and Leo Stein, subsequently cost him his international reputation and any hope of paternal regard. He had a two-man exhibition with John Marin in New York City at Alfred Stieglitz's 291 gallery, and four of his paintings were included in the legendary Armory Show of 1913. He acquired esteem in avant-garde circles. He did not, however, find the popular following he needed to make a living. Leaving Paris on the eve of World War I, he returned to his father's house only to be denied support. It was the beginning, as art critic Robert Hughes wrote, of \\"a banishment to a hell of Oedipal conflict.\\"Hughes, p. 340. For the next seventeen, increasingly depressed years, Maurer painted in a garret in his father's house on the West Side of Manhattan and gained only limited critical acclaim. He was friends with respected avant-garde American artists like Arthur Dove, Marsden Hartley, and John Marin, almost all of whom were better known than he was. He participated in prestigious exhibitions, such as \\"The Forum Exhibition of Modern American Painters\\" in 1916, a New York show which featured seventeen of the most significant native modernists of the time. He also exhibited regularly at the New York-based Society of Independent Artists and was elected their director in 1919. In 1924, the New York dealer Erhard Weyhe bought the contents of Maurer's studio and represented the artist for the remainder of his career. The death of his mother in 1917, however, intensified his gradual withdrawal from the world.Elizabeth McCausland, A.H. Maurer (1968-1932) (Minneapolis: Walker Art Center, exhibition catalogue, November 6-December 11, 1949), p. 15. The artist Jerome Myers wrote poignantly of him in his autobiography, Artist In Manhattan: About his approach to painting after abandoning realism, Maurer commented, \\"My main concern in painting is the beautiful arrangement of color values -- that is, harmonized masses of pigment, more or less pure. For this reason, it is impossible to present an exact transcription of nature....It is necessary for art to differ from nature....Perhaps art should be an intensification of nature; at least it should express an inherent feeling which cannot be obtained from nature except through a process of association....The artist must be free to paint his effects. Nature must not bind him.\\"Anne Harrell, \\"The Forum Exhibition: Selections and Additions\\" (Whitney Museum of American Art, exhibition catalogue, May 81-June 22, 1983), p. 25. As the art historian Sheldon Reich observed, had Maurer been a European or remained in Europe in 1914, he would probably be discussed today in the same terms applied to Vlaminck or Derain.Loughery, p. 124. Instead, he became a citizen of a country with very limited interest in bold artistic experimentation and took his place as part of that \\"tragic fraternity of artists who during their lifetimes have suffered the tortures of neglect.\\"Brown, p. 133. He enjoys a marginal status in most American art history textbooks. It is also extremely difficult to encounter Maurer's paintings in public collections as most of his work is still privately owned. Maurer took his own life by hanging several weeks after his father's death at the age of 100.New York Times, \\"Artist, Death by Suicide,\\" August 5, 1932. Alfred Stieglitz wanted to arrange a posthumous exhibition of his work at his gallery, An American Place, but was unable to do so.Sue Davidson Lowe, Stieglitz: A Memoir/Biography (New York: Farrar, Straus, Giroux, 1983), p. 321. Five years after Maurer's death, the art critic Henry McBride, reviewing a show of his work at the Hudson Walker Gallery in New York, wrote: \\"He lived exclusively for his art and in sharp contrast to most painters of today who never lift a paint brush to canvas without thought of the box office results....he had the courage of his principles.\\" Daniel Catton Rich (ed.), The Flow of Art: Essays and Criticisms of Henry McBride (New York: Atheneum, 1975), pp. 352-353. Maurer's works are included in the collections of the Barnes Foundation, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; the Brooklyn Museum, New York; the Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; the Art Institute of Chicago, Illinois; the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art, Bentonville, Arkansas; the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; the Philadelphia Museum of Art, Pennsylvania; the Phillips Collection, Washington, D.C.; the Reynolda House Museum of American Art, Winston-Salem, North Carolina; the Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington, D.C.; the Weisman Art Museum, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis; and the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, among others.

According to the Rig-Veda, Revanta is the youngest son of the sun-god Surya, and his wife Saranyu. Revanta is chief of the Guhyakas (गुह्यक), semi-divine and demonic class entities – like the Yakshas – who are believed to live as forest dwellers in the Himalayas.Monier-Williams Dictionary: RevantaMonier- Williams Dictionary:Guhyaka Images and sculptures of Revanta often show him as a huntsman on a horse, with a bow and arrow. Origins Revanta is the brother of the Ashvins or the Ashwini Kumaaras, the twin Gods of healing, vision, and sunrise and sunset. Legends The tale of Revanta's birth is narrated in scriptures like Vishnu Purana and Markandeya Purana. Once, Sanjna, the daughter of celestial architect Vishvakarma and wife of Surya, unable to take the fervour of the Sun-god, repaired to the forests to engage in devout austerities in the form of a mare. She placed her shadow Chhaya, who looked just like Sanjna in her position as Surya's wife. When Surya realised that Chhaya was not the real Sanjna, he searched for Sanjna and finally found her in the forests of Uttar Kuru. There, Surya approached Sanjna disguised as a horse. Their union produced the twin-Ashvins and Revanta. In Kurma Purana and Matsya Purana, the mother of Revanta is named Ratri, another wife of Surya. While in another chapter of Markandeya Purana, he is son of Chhaya and his brothers are the Saturn-god Shani, Tapati and Bhadra.. Markandeya Purna further adds he was assigned the duty as chief of Guhyakas by Surya and to protect mortals \\"amid the terrors of forests and other lonely places, of great conflagration, of enemies and robbers.\\" Sometimes, Revanta is depicted as combating robbers in reliefs.. Another tale from the Devi Bhagavata Purana has a passing reference to Revanta. Once when Revanta – riding on the seven headed horse Uchaishravas – went to Vishnu's abode, Vishnu's wife goddess Lakshmi was mesmerized with the horse and ignored a question asked by the Lord. Thus, she was cursed by her husband to become a mare.. Iconography Markandeya Purana describes Revanta as \\"holding a sword and bow, clad in an armour, riding on horseback, and carrying arrows and a quiver\\". Kalika Purana describes him carrying a sword in right hand and a whip in his left, seated on a white horse. Thus he is called Haya-Vahana, one who rides a horse. Varahamihira describes him as accompanied by attendants for hunting. In sculpture, Revanta is often depicted with the Guhyakas, whose chief he is, in scenes of hunting. Apart from the attributes described in texts like the sword, bow; he sometimes also carries a cup of wine in his hand. Revanta is often depicted wearing long boots reaching up to the calves, unlike other Hindu divinities – except Surya – who are depicted barefoot.. Revanta is depicted seated on a horse and accompanied by a hunting dog. Revanta's attendants are depicted with various hunting weapons like lances and swords. Some of them are shown blowing a conch or beaming drums or holding an umbrella over the head of their lord, the umbrella being the symbol of royalty.A History of Zoroastrianism by Mary Boyce, Frantz Grenet, Roger Beck pp.485-6 Also, some of them are depicted as flying or holding wine or water jars. Sometimes, an attendant carries a dead boar in his shoulder or the dog chasing a boar. Worship Revanta was worshipped as guardian deity of warriors and horses, protector from the dangers of forests and the patron god of hunting. The worship of Revanta is closely associated with Saura, cult of Surya. Often, scriptures like Vishnudharmottara Purana and Kalika Purana recommend worship of Revanta alongside Surya or according to the rituals of Sun worship. Shabha-kalpa-druma records Revanta's worship after Surya's, in the Hindu month of Ashvin by warriors. Nakula, the fourth Pandava, is believed to have written Ashavashastram on horses. He suggests worship of Raivata to protect horses from ghosts. The worship of Revanta was popular in the early-mediaeval period, particularly in Rajasthan. Revanta is mostly depicted in Vaishnava and Surya temples. There is a stone inscription that talks about a temple to Revanta, as the principal deity, in Vikranapur (modern Kotgaph, Madhya Pradesh) built by the Kalachuri king Ratnadeva II. NotesReferences * .

Kaituozhe-1  Kaituozhe-1 (KT-1) was small, solid fueled launch vehicle based on the road mobile DF-21 IRBM with an additional upper stage (in total 4 stages). It was 13.6 meters in length and 1.4 meters in diameter, with launch mass of 20t. It was possible to launch KT-1 both from a truck-based platform or from airborne platform. It had a 100 kg to LEO payload capacity. It was possibly the launch vehicle for a Chinese ASAT system that was tested against an old Chinese weather satellite in 2007. The vehicle has performed two flights, the first in 15 September 2002 and the second 16 September 2003. The first flight failed to place a 50 kg satellite into polar orbit due to a second stage malfunction. The second flight was also a failure, however Chinese officials declared some success citing the guidance systems, fairing separation and satellite-launcher separation as successful. The second launch sent the payload, PS-2 microsatellite (40 kg) into wrong orbit. The satellite completed barely one orbit before re-entering the atmosphere. The Kaituozhe-1 launcher appears to have been cancelled after two unsuccessful launches. A third (in 2004) and fourth launch have been rumored, but are not confirmed.

The process is deliberately carried out in a variety of settings, such as in many single-parent households and military boot camps through an intense social process that may take place in a total institution. An important thing to note about socialization is that what can be learned can be unlearned. That forms the basis of resocialization: to unlearn and to relearn. Resocialization can be defined also as a process by which individuals, defined as inadequate according to the norms of a dominant institution, are subjected to a dynamic redistribution of those values, attitudes and abilities to allow them to function according to the norms of the said dominant institutions. That definition relates more to a jail sentence. If individuals exhibit deviance, society delivers the offenders to a total institution, where they can be rehabilitated. Resocialization varies in its severity. A mild resocialization might be involved in moving to a different country. One who does so may need to learn new social customs and norms such as language, eating, dress, and talking customs. A more drastic example of resocialization is joining a military or a cult, and the most severe example would be if one suffers from a loss of all memories and so would have to relearn all of society's norms. The first stage of resocialization is the destruction of an individual's former beliefs and confidence. Institutions A prison cell The goal of total institutions is resocialization, which radically alters residents' personalities by deliberate manipulation of their environment. A total institution refers to an institution in which one is totally immersed and controls all of one's day-to-day life. All activity occurs in a single place under a single authority. Examples of a total institution include prisons, fraternity houses, and the military. Resocialization is a two-part process. First, the institutional staff try to erode the residents' identities and independence. Strategies to erode identities include forcing individuals to surrender all personal possessions, get uniform haircuts and wear standardized clothing. Independence is eroded by subjecting residents to humiliating and degrading procedures. Examples are strip searches, fingerprinting, and assigning serial numbers or code names to replace the residents' given names. The second part of resocialization process involves the systematic attempt to build a different personality or self. That is generally done through a system of rewards and punishments. The privilege of being allowed to read a book, watch television, or make a phone call can be a powerful motivator for conformity. Conformity occurs when individuals change their behavior to fit in with the expectations of an authority figure or the expectations of the larger group. No two people respond to resocialization programs in the same manner. Some residents are found to be \\"rehabilitated,\\" but others might become bitter and hostile. As well, over a long period of time, a strictly-controlled environment can destroy a person's ability to make decisions and live independently, which is known as institutionalisation, a negative outcome of total institution that prevents an individual from ever functioning effectively in the outside world again. (Sproule, 154-155) Resocialization is also evident in individuals who have never been \\"socialized\\" in the first place or have not been required to behave socially for an extended period of time. Examples include feral children (never socialized) or inmates who have been in solitary confinement. Socialization is a lifelong process. Adult socialization often includes learning new norms and values that are very different from those associated with the culture in which the person was raised. The process can be voluntary. Currently, joining a volunteer military qualifies as an example of voluntary resocialization. The norms and values associated with military life are different from those associated with civilian life (Riehm, 2000). The sociologist Erving Goffman studied resocialization in mental institutions. He characterized the mental institution as a total institution, one in which virtually every aspect of the inmates' lives is controlled by the institution and calculated to serve the institution's goals. For example, the institution requires patients to comply with certain regulations, even when that is not necessarily in the best interest of individuals.  In military  Those who join the military enter a new social realm in which they become socialized as military members. Resocialization is defined as a \\"process wherein an individual, defined as inadequate according to the norms of a dominant institution(s), is subjected to a dynamic program of behavior intervention aimed at instilling and/or rejuvenating those values, attitudes, and abilities which would allow... to function according to the norms of said dominant institution(s).\\" Boot camp serves as an example for understanding how military members are resocialized within the total institution of the military. According to Fox and Pease (2012) , the purpose of military training, like boot camp, is to \\"promote the willing and systematic subordination of one’s own individual desires and interests to those of one’s unit and, ultimately, country.\\" To accomplish it, all aspects of military members' lives exist within the same military institution and are controlled by the same \\"institutional authorities\\" (drill instructors) and are done to accomplish the goals of the total institution. The individual’s \\"civil[ian] identity, with its built-in restraints is eradicated, or at least undermined and set aside in favor of the warrior identity and its central focus upon killing.\\" Military training prepares individuals for combat by promoting traditional ideas of masculinity, like training individuals to disregard their bodies' natural reactions to run from fear, have pain or show emotions. Although resocialization through military training can create a sense of purpose in military members, it can also create mental and emotional distress when members are unable to achieve set standards and expectations. Military members, in part, find purpose and meaning through resocialization because the institution provides access to symbolic and material resources, helping military members construct meaningful identities. Fox and Pease state, \\"like any social identity, military identity is always an achievement, something dependent upon conformity to others' expectations and their acknowledgment. The centrality of performance testing in the military, and the need to 'measure up,' heightens this dependence. Although resocialization through military training can create a sense of purpose in military members, it also has the likelihood to create mental and emotional distress when members are unable to achieve set standards and expectations.\\" In the first couple of days, the most important aspect of basic training is the surrender of their identity. Recruits shed their clothes and hair, which are the physical representation of their old identities. The processes happen very quickly and allows no time for recruits to think over the loss of their identity and so the recruits have no chance to regret their decisions. Drill sergeants then give the young men and women a romanticized view on what it is to be a soldier and how manly it is. When the training starts, it is physically demanding and gets harder every week. The recruits are constantly insulted and put down to break down their pride and destroy their ability to resist the change that they are undergoing. Drill sergeants put up a facade that tells their recruits that finishing out basic training sets them apart from all of the others who fail. However, almost all recruits succeed and graduate from basic training. The training is also set up with roles. There are three younger drill sergeants closer to the recruits in age and one senior drill sergeant, who becomes a father figure to the new recruits. The company commander plays a god-like role, which the recruits look up to. The people in the roles will become role models and authority figures but also help to create a sense of loyalty to the entire organization. Recruits are made to march in a formation in which every person moves the same way at the same time, which causes a sense of unity. It makes the recruits feel less like individuals and more like parts of a group. They sing in cadence to boost morale and to make the group feel important. Drill sergeants also feed the group small doses of triumphs to keep the soldiers proud and feeling accomplished. The troop also undergoes group punishment, which unifies the unit. Generally, the similar hatred of something will bring everyone together. In this case, group punishment allows all the recruits to hate the drill sergeants and the punishment but to find unity within their unit. They will encourage others to push themselves and create shared hardships.  In prisons  Prisons have two different types of resocialization. The first type is that prisoners must learn the new normal behaviors that apply to their new environment. The second type is the prisoners must partake in rehabilitation measures to help fix their deviant ways. When the individual violates the dominant society’s norms, the criminal system subjects them to a form of resocialization called criminal rehabilitation. Rehabilitation aims to bring an inmate's real behavior closer to that of most individuals, who make up the dominant society. The ideal societal behaviour is highly valued in many societies, mainly because it serves to protect and promote the well-being of most of the society's members. In rehabilitation, the system strips the criminal of his prior socialization of criminal behavior, including the techniques of committing a crime and the specific motives, drives, rationalizations, and attitudes. Criminal behavior is learned behavior and so can be unlearned. The first step towards rehabilitation is the choice of milieu. That is the type of interactions the deviant has with the people around him in custody. Usually, that is determined after psychological and sociological screenings are performed on the criminal. The second step is diagnosis, a continual process influenced by feedback from the individual’s behavior. The next stage is treatment, which is dependent on the diagnosis. Whether it is treating an addiction or redefining the values of a person, the treatment is what resocializes the criminal back to societal norms. References * Conley, Dalton.

Structure Thalamocortical (TC) fibers have been referred to as one of the two constituents of the isothalamus, the other being micro neurons. Thalamocortical fibers have a bush or tree-like appearance as they extend into the internal capsule and project to the layers of the cortex. The main thalamocortical fibers extend from different nuclei of the thalamus and project to the visual cortex, somatosensory (and associated sensori-motor) cortex, and the auditory cortex in the brain. Thalamocortical radiations also innervate gustatory and olfactory pathways, as well as pre-frontal motor areas. Visual input from the optic tract is processed by the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus, auditory input in the medial geniculate nucleus, and somatosensory input in the ventral posterior nucleus of the thalamus. Thalamic nuclei project to cortical areas of distinct architectural organization and relay the processed information back to the area of original activity in the thalamus via corticothalamic (CT) fibers. The thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) receives incoming signals via corticothalamic pathways and regulates activity within the thalamus accordingly. Cortico-thalamic feedback neurons are mostly found in layer VI of the cortex. Reciprocal CT projections to the thalamus are of a higher order than, and synapse with, the TRN in much greater number than do thalamocortical projections to cortex. This suggests that the cortex has a much bigger role in top down processing and regulation of thalamic activity than do the processes originating in thalamic interneurons. Large-scale frequency oscillations and electrical rhythms have also been shown to regulate TC activity for long periods of time, as is evident during the sleep cycle. Other evidence suggests CT modulation of TC rhythms can occur over different time scales, adding even more complexity to their function. =Relay cells= Thalamic interneurons process sensory information and signal different regions of the thalamic nuclei. These nuclei extend to relay cells, which in turn innervate distinct areas of the cortex via thalamocortical fibers. Either specifically or nonspecifically, TC relay cells project specifically to organized areas of the cortex directly and nonspecifically project to large areas of cortex through the innervation of many interconnected collateral axons. According to Jones (2001) there are two primary types of relay neurons in the thalamus of primates–core cells and matrix cells–each creating distinct pathways to various parts and layers throughout the cerebral cortex. Matrix cells of the thalamus, or calbindin- immuno-reactive neurons (CIR neurons), are widely distributed and diffusely dispersed in each of the nuclei of the dorsal thalamus. In comparison, parvalbumin immuno-reactive neurons (PIR neurons) can be found only in principal sensory and motor relay nuclei, and in the pulvinar nuclei as well as the intralaminar nuclei. The PIR neurons cluster together creating \\"densely terminating afferent fibers…forming a core imposed on a diffuse background matrix of PIR cells\\" (Jones 2001). PIR cells tend to project upon the cerebral cortex and terminate in an organized topographic manner in specifically localized zones (in deep layer III and in the middle layer IV). In contrast, CIR cells have dispersed projections wherein various adjacent cells connect to non-specific different cortical areas. CIR axons seem to terminate primarily in the superficial layers of the cortex: layers I, II, and upper III. Function Thalamocortical signaling is primarily excitatory, causing the activation of corresponding areas of the cortex, but is mainly regulated by inhibitory mechanisms. The specific excitatory signaling is based upon glutamatergic signaling, and is dependent on the nature of the sensory information being processed. Recurrent oscillations in thalamocortical circuits also provide large-scale regulatory feedback inputs to the thalamus via GABAergic neurons that synapse in the TRN. In a study done by Gibbs, Zhang, Shumate, and Coulter (1998) it was found that endogenously released zinc blocked GABA responses within the TC system specifically by interrupting communication between the thalamus and the connected TRN. Computational neuroscientists are particularly interested in thalamocortical circuits because they represent a structure that is disproportionally larger and more complex in humans than other mammals (when body size is taken into account), which may contribute to humans' special cognitive abilities. Evidence from one study (Arcelli et al. 1996) offers partial support to this claim by suggesting that thalamic GABAergic local circuit neurons in mammalian brains relate more to processing ability compared to sensorimotor ability, as they reflect an increasing complexity of local information processing in the thalamus. It is proposed that core relay cells and matrix cells projecting from the dorsal thalamus allow for synchronization of cortical and thalamic cells during \\"high-frequency oscillations that underlie discrete conscious events\\", though this is a heavily debated area of research. =Projections= The majority of thalamocortical fibers project to layer IV of the cortex, wherein sensory information is directed to other layers where they either terminate or connect with axons collaterally depending on type of projection and type of initial activation. Activation of the thalamocortical neurons relies heavily on the direct and indirect effects of Glutamate, which causes EPSP’s at terminal branches in the primary sensory cortices. =Somatosensory areas= Primarily, thalamocortical somatosensory radiation from the VPL, VPM and LP nuclei extends to the primary and secondary somatosensory areas, terminating in cortical layers of the lateral postcentral gyrus. S1 receives parallel thalamocortical radiations from the posterior medial nucleus and the VPN. Projections from the VPN to the postcentral gyrus account for the transfer of sensory information concerning touch and pain. Several studies indicate that parallel innervations to S1 and also S2 via thalamocortical pathways result in the processing of nociceptive and non-nociceptive information. Non-specific projections to sensori-motor areas of the cortex may in part have to do with the relationship between non-noci-receptive processing and motor functions. Past research shows a link between S1 and M1, creating a thalamocortical sensori-motor circuit. When this circuit becomes disrupted symptoms are produced similar to those that accompany Multiple sclerosis, suggesting thalamocortical rhythms are involved in regulating sensori-motor pathways in a highly specialized manner. TC-CT rhythms evident during sleep act to inhibit these thalamocortical fibers so as to maintain the tonic cycling of low frequency waves and the subsequent suppression of motor activity. =Visual areas= The Lateral geniculate and pulvinar nuclei project to and terminate in V1, and carry motor information from the brain stem as well as other sensory input from the optic tract. The visual cortex connects with other sensory areas which allows for the integration of cognitive tasks such as selective and directed attention, and pre-motor planning, in relation to the processing of incoming visual stimuli. Models of the pulvinar projections to the visual cortex have been proposed by several imaging studies, though the mapping of pulvinar projections has been a difficult task due to the fact that pulvinar subdivisions are not conventionally organized and have been difficult to visualize using structural MRI. Evidence from several studies supports the idea that the Pulvinar nuclei and superior colliculus receive descending projections from CT fibers while TC fibers extending from the LGN carry visual information to the various areas of the visual cortex near the calcarine fissure. =Auditory areas= Thalamocortical axons project primarily from the medial geniculate nucleus via the sublenticular region of the internal capsule, and terminate in an organized topographic manner in the transverse temporal gyri. MMGN radiations terminate in specific locations while thalamocortical fibers from the VMGN terminate in nonspecific clusters of cells and form collateral connections to neighboring cells. Research done by staining the brains of macaque monkeys reveals projections from the ventral nucleus mainly terminating in layers IV and IIIB, with some nonspecific clusters of PIR cells terminating in layers I, II, IIIA, and VI. Fibers from the dorsal nuclei were found to project more directly to the primary auditory area, with most axons terminating in layer IIIB. The magnocellular nucleus projected a small amount of PIR cells with axons mainly terminating in layer 1, though large regions of the middle cortical layers were innervated through collaterally connected CIR neurons. Past research suggests that the thalamocortical-auditory pathway may be the only neural correlate that can explain a direct translation of frequency information to the cortex via specific pathways. =Motor areas= The primary motor cortex receives terminating thalamocortical fibers from the VL nucleus of the thalamus. This is the primary pathway involved in the transference of cerebellar input to the primary motor cortex. The VA projects widely across the inferior parietal and premotor cortex. Other Non-specific thalamocortical projections, those that originate in the dorsal-medial nuclei of the thalamus, terminate in the prefrontal cortex and have subsequent projections to associative premotor areas via collateral connections. The Cortico-basal ganglia-thalamocortical loop has been traditionally associated with reward-learning and though has also been noted by some researchers to have a modulatory effect on thalamocortical network functioning–this is due to inherent activation of the premotor areas connecting the VA nucleus with the cortex. Clinical significanceAbsence seizures= Thalamocortical radiations have been researched extensively in the past due to their relationship with attention, wakefulness, and arousal. Past research has shown how an increase in spike- and-wave activity within the TC network can disrupt normal rhythms involved with the sleep-wakefulness cycle, ultimately causing absence seizures and other forms of epileptic behavior. Burst firing within a part of the TC network stimulates GABA receptors within the thalamus causing moments of increased inhibition, leading to frequency spikes, which offset oscillation patterns. Another study done on rats suggests during spike-and-wave seizures, thalamic rhythms are mediated by local thalamic connections, while the cortex controls the synchronization of these rhythms over extended periods of time. Thalamocortical dysrhythmia is a term associated with spontaneously reoccurring low frequency spike-and-wave activity in the thalamus, which causes symptoms normally associated with impulse control disorders such as obsessive compulsive disorder, Parkinson's disease, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and other forms of chronic psychosis. Other evidence has shown how reductions in the distribution of connections of nonspecific thalamocortical systems is heavily associated with loss of consciousness, as can be seen with individuals in a vegetative state, or coma. =Prefrontal lobotomy= The bilateral interruption or severing of the connection between thalamocortical radiations the medial and anterior thalamic nuclei results in a prefrontal lobotomy, which causes a drastic personality change and a subdued behavioral disposition without cortical injury. ResearchEvolutionary theories of consciousness= Theories of consciousness have been linked to thalamocortical rhythm oscillations in TC-CT pathway activity. One such theory, the dynamic core theory of conscious experience, proposes four main pillars in support of conscious awareness as a consequence of dorsal thalamic activity: # the results of cortical computations underlay consciousness # vegetative states and general anesthetics work primarily to disrupt normal thalamic functioning # the anatomy and physiology of the thalamus implies consciousness # neural synchronization accounts for the neural basis of consciousness. This area of research is still developing, and most current theories are either partial or incomplete.

Located in Irpinia historical district, the town is part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Ariano Irpino-Lacedonia, and it is awarded I borghi più belli d'Italia (\\"the most beautiful villages of Italy\\") quality mark. Geography Savignano Irpino lies towards the north- east of the province up in the Cervaro Valley, near the border of the province of Foggia. Located in the Apennines along Daunian Mountains, its territory is bordered by the municipalities of Ariano Irpino, Greci, Montaguto, Monteleone di Puglia and Panni. The village is split into two areas, Scalo is the bottom part where there is a railway station and a commercial area. The upper part is mostly residential and this is where the Piazza is located. History Savignano has historical archaeological remains from the pre-Roman and Roman era. In the Ferrara district the ruins of a Norman fort can be seen. In 1416 it was a fiefdom of Francesco Sforza and, from the 17th century, it belonged to the Guevara family. The name Savignano derives from the Latin word 'Sabinianum, Sabinus'. Savignano Irpino was previously known as Savignano Di Puglia; this was updated in the mid-20th century as part of boundary changes. In June 2006, Savignano Irpino held a referendum to leave Campania and become part of Apulia again, but failed to achieve a quorum.

Music career Mounsey was born in Berea, Ohio, and grew up in Seattle, Washington, spending a few years each in Findlay and Granville, Ohio. At the age of 17, he was awarded a 1970 BMI Student Composer Award for his orchestral work Ilium, New York, Is Divided into Three Parts. He attended Berklee College of Music in Boston from 1971 to 1975. In 1976, he moved to New York City to become a studio musician, arranger, and producer for a wide range of well-known artists, including Aaron Neville, Aztec Camera, Brian Wilson, Carly Simon, Chaka Khan, Chromeo, Diana Krall, Diana Ross, Donald Fagen, Eric Clapton, James Taylor, Karen Carpenter, Madonna, Michael Franks, Natalie Cole, Paul Simon, Rihanna, Steely Dan, and others. He performed on keyboards in 1981 for Simon and Garfunkel's Concert in the Park. In 1985, he played keyboards in a New-York-based group called Joe Cool with Will Lee, Jeff Mironov and Christopher Parker. They released one album, Party Animals, on the Pony Canyon label in Japan, followed by a Japanese tour. Mounsey released three solo albums as a recording artist: Dig (Sona Gaia, 1990), and two self-released albums on his own Monkeyville label, Back in the Pool and Mango Theory. He toured as musical director and pianist for Idina Menzel in her Pops Symphony tour, for which he created nearly all of the arrangements. He has composed for film and television, including the 1988 Mike Nichols film Working Girl (with Carly Simon), the film Bright Lights, Big City (with Donald Fagen) and the HBO hit series Sex and the City. Mounsey wrote two long-running Emmy-winning themes for the television show Guiding Light. He is a six-time Grammy Award nominee, and a winner of two Emmy Awards.

Called respectively right and left residuals, these operations coincide when the monoid is commutative. The general concept was introduced by Morgan Ward and Robert P. Dilworth in 1939. Examples, some of which existed prior to the general concept, include Boolean algebras, Heyting algebras, residuated Boolean algebras, relation algebras, and MV-algebras. Residuated semilattices omit the meet operation ∧, for example Kleene algebras and action algebras. Definition In mathematics, a residuated lattice is an algebraic structure L = (L, ≤, •, I) such that : (i) (L, ≤) is a lattice. : (ii) (L, •, I) is a monoid. :(iii) For all z there exists for every x a greatest y, and for every y a greatest x, such that x•y ≤ z (the residuation properties). In (iii), the \\"greatest y\\", being a function of z and x, is denoted x\\\\z and called the right residual of z by x. Think of it as what remains of z on the right after \\"dividing\\" z on the left by x. Dually, the \\"greatest x\\" is denoted z/y and called the left residual of z by y. An equivalent, more formal statement of (iii) that uses these operations to name these greatest values is (iii)' for all x, y, z in L, y ≤ x\\\\z ⇔ x•y ≤ z ⇔ x ≤ z/y. As suggested by the notation, the residuals are a form of quotient. More precisely, for a given x in L, the unary operations x• and x\\\\ are respectively the lower and upper adjoints of a Galois connection on L, and dually for the two functions •y and /y. By the same reasoning that applies to any Galois connection, we have yet another definition of the residuals, namely, :x•(x\\\\y) ≤ y ≤ x\\\\\\\\(x•y), and :(y/x)•x ≤ y ≤ (y•x)/x, together with the requirement that x•y be monotone in x and y. (When axiomatized using (iii) or (iii)' monotonicity becomes a theorem and hence not required in the axiomatization.) These give a sense in which the functions x• and x\\\\ are pseudoinverses or adjoints of each other, and likewise for •x and /x. This last definition is purely in terms of inequalities, noting that monotonicity can be axiomatized as x•y ≤ (x∨z)•y and similarly for the other operations and their arguments. Moreover, any inequality x ≤ y can be expressed equivalently as an equation, either x∧y = x or x∨y = y. This along with the equations axiomatizing lattices and monoids then yields a purely equational definition of residuated lattices, provided the requisite operations are adjoined to the signature (L, ≤, •, I) thereby expanding it to (L, ∧, ∨, •, I, /, \\\\\\\\). When thus organized, residuated lattices form an equational class or variety, whose homomorphisms respect the residuals as well as the lattice and monoid operations. Note that distributivity x•(y ∨ z) = (x•y) ∨ (x•z) and x•0 = 0 are consequences of these axioms and so do not need to be made part of the definition. This necessary distributivity of • over ∨ does not in general entail distributivity of ∧ over ∨, that is, a residuated lattice need not be a distributive lattice. However distributivity of ∧ over ∨ is entailed when • and ∧ are the same operation, a special case of residuated lattices called a Heyting algebra. Alternative notations for x•y include x◦y, x;y (relation algebra), and x⊗y (linear logic). Alternatives for I include e and 1'. Alternative notations for the residuals are x → y for x\\\\y and y ← x for y/x, suggested by the similarity between residuation and implication in logic, with the multiplication of the monoid understood as a form of conjunction that need not be commutative. When the monoid is commutative the two residuals coincide. When not commutative, the intuitive meaning of the monoid as conjunction and the residuals as implications can be understood as having a temporal quality: x•y means x and then y, x → y means had x (in the past) then y (now), and y ← x means if-ever x (in the future) then y (at that time), as illustrated by the natural language example at the end of the examples.  Examples  One of the original motivations for the study of residuated lattices was the lattice of (two-sided) ideals of a ring. Given a ring R, the ideals of R, denoted Id(R), forms a complete lattice with set intersection acting as the meet operation and \\"ideal addition\\" acting as the join operation. The monoid operation • is given by \\"ideal multiplication\\", and the element R of Id(R) acts as the identity for this operation. Given two ideals A and B in Id(R), the residuals are given by :A/B:= \\\\\\\\{r \\\\in R \\\\mid rB \\\\subseteq A \\\\\\\\} :B\\\\setminus A:=\\\\\\\\{ r \\\\in R \\\\mid Br \\\\subseteq A \\\\\\\\} It is worth noting that {0}/B and B\\\\\\\\{0} are respectively the left and right annihilators of B. This residuation is related to the conductor (or transporter) in commutative algebra written as (A:B)=A/B. One difference in usage is that B need not be an ideal of R: it may just be a subset. Boolean algebras and Heyting algebras are commutative residuated lattices in which x•y = x∧y (whence the unit I is the top element 1 of the algebra) and both residuals x\\\\y and y/x are the same operation, namely implication x → y. The second example is quite general since Heyting algebras include all finite distributive lattices, as well as all chains or total orders forming a complete lattice, for example the unit interval [0,1] in the real line, or the integers and ±\\\\infty. The structure (Z, min, max, +, 0, −, −) (the integers with subtraction for both residuals) is a commutative residuated lattice such that the unit of the monoid is not the greatest element (indeed there is no least or greatest integer), and the multiplication of the monoid is not the meet operation of the lattice. In this example the inequalities are equalities because − (subtraction) is not merely the adjoint or pseudoinverse of + but the true inverse. Any totally ordered group under addition such as the rationals or the reals can be substituted for the integers in this example. The nonnegative portion of any of these examples is an example provided min and max are interchanged and − is replaced by monus, defined (in this case) so that x-y = 0 when x ≤ y and otherwise is ordinary subtraction. A more general class of examples is given by the Boolean algebra of all binary relations on a set X, namely the power set of X2, made a residuated lattice by taking the monoid multiplication • to be composition of relations and the monoid unit to be the identity relation I on X consisting of all pairs (x,x) for x in X. Given two relations R and S on X, the right residual R\\\\S of S by R is the binary relation such that x(R\\\\S)y holds just when for all z in X, zRx implies zSy (notice the connection with implication). The left residual is the mirror image of this: y(S/R)x holds just when for all z in X, xRz implies ySz. This can be illustrated with the binary relations < and > on {0,1} in which 0 < 1 and 1 > 0 are the only relationships that hold. Then x(>\\\\<)y holds just when x = 1, while x()y holds just when y = 0, showing that residuation of < by > is different depending on whether we residuate on the right or the left. This difference is a consequence of the difference between <•> and >•<, where the only relationships that hold are 0(<•>)0 (since 0<1>0) and 1(>•<)1 (since 1>0<1). Had we chosen ≤ and ≥ instead of < and >, ≥\\\\≤ and ≤/≥ would have been the same because ≤•≥ = ≥•≤, both of which always hold between all x and y (since x≤1≥y and x≥0≤y). The Boolean algebra 2Σ* of all formal languages over an alphabet (set) Σ forms a residuated lattice whose monoid multiplication is language concatenation LM and whose monoid unit I is the language {ε} consisting of just the empty string ε. The right residual M\\\\L consists of all words w over Σ such that Mw ⊆ L. The left residual L/M is the same with wM in place of Mw. The residuated lattice of all binary relations on X is finite just when X is finite, and commutative just when X has at most one element. When X is empty the algebra is the degenerate Boolean algebra in which 0 = 1 = I. The residuated lattice of all languages on Σ is commutative just when Σ has at most one letter. It is finite just when Σ is empty, consisting of the two languages 0 (the empty language {}) and the monoid unit I = {ε} = 1. The examples forming a Boolean algebra have special properties treated in the article on residuated Boolean algebras. In natural language residuated lattices formalize the logic of \\"and\\" when used with its noncommutative meaning of \\"and then.\\" Setting x = bet, y = win, z = rich, we can read x•y ≤ z as \\"bet and then win entails rich.\\" By the axioms this is equivalent to y ≤ x→z meaning \\"win entails had bet then rich\\", and also to x ≤ z←y meaning \\"bet entails if-ever win then rich.\\" Humans readily detect such non-sequiturs as \\"bet entails had win then rich\\" and \\"win entails if-ever bet then rich\\" as both being equivalent to the wishful thinking \\"win and then bet entails rich.\\" Humans do not so readily detect that Peirce's law ((P→Q)→P)→P is a classical tautology, an interesting situation where humans exhibit more proficiency with non-classical reasoning than classical (for example, in relevance logic, Peirce's law is not a tautology). Residuated semilattice A residuated semilattice is defined almost identically for residuated lattices, omitting just the meet operation ∧. Thus it is an algebraic structure L = (L, ∨, •, 1, /, \\\\\\\\) satisfying all the residuated lattice equations as specified above except those containing an occurrence of the symbol ∧. The option of defining x ≤ y as x∧y = x is then not available, leaving only the other option x∨y = y (or any equivalent thereof). Any residuated lattice can be made a residuated semilattice simply by omitting ∧. Residuated semilattices arise in connection with action algebras, which are residuated semilattices that are also Kleene algebras, for which ∧ is ordinarily not required.

He sat in the House of Commons first for the Liberal Party and then for the Conservatives between 1880 and 1905 when he was raised to the peerage. He was President of the Thames Conservancy Board for thirty-two years. Background and education Grenfell was the son of Charles William Grenfell, former MP for Sandwich, and Georgiana Lascelles, daughter of William Saunders Lascelles, MP. He was the nephew of Henry Riversdale Grenfell, the banker and politician, and the first cousin of Edward Grenfell, 1st Baron St Just. Grenfell was educated at Harrow School and Balliol College, Oxford. Athletic career Grenfell rowed for Oxford in the Boat Race, in the only dead heat race, in 1877, and Oxford's win of 1878.

It was the friendship of one local founder member, Dr G E Moore, with Grenfell which really got the project off the ground. Grenfell was the Mayor of Maidenhead in 1895 and 1896 and an extremely wealthy and competent businessman who owned more than 10,000 acres of land around the town. Grenfell offered to lease some of his acreage near to Maidenhead Railway Station, which was to become Maidenhead Golf Club and remains so well into a second century. Grenfell became one of the earliest 63 members of the club, and its first president and agreed to present “a challenge cup for competition”. This was the Grenfell Cup which is still in yearly competition. Political career In the 1880 general election, Grenfell was elected the Member of Parliament for Salisbury; he lost the seat in a ministerial by-election in 1882 but returned in 1885–1886. He was elected MP for Hereford in 1892. Politically he was a Gladstonian (loyal) Liberal who resigned in 1893 rather than support Gladstone's Second Irish Home Rule Bill. He returned to the House of Commons in 1900 as a Conservative. On 30 December 1905, Grenfell was raised to the peerage as Baron Desborough, of Taplow in the County of Buckingham, a title that combined the defunct hundred of Desborough and the riverside village in which he lived in Buckinghamshire. Other public appointments Desborough Cut from one of the bridges During a long career dedicated to public service, he was President of the Thames Conservancy Board from 1904 to 1937, the London Chamber of Commerce, and the Royal Agricultural Society, amongst many others. He was High Steward of Maidenhead, the nearest town to his home at Taplow Court, Taplow. His good deeds for Maidenhead included the donation of an old chalk pit, converted for use as a park, to celebrate the diamond jubilee of Queen Victoria: this park, Grenfell Park, contains many unusual trees, the seeds of which were collected by Lord Desborough as he travelled the world. He was also an active Freemason. He became a steward of Henley Royal Regatta. He was a J.P. for Buckinghamshire and a Deputy Lieutenant for Tower Hamlets. He was appointed High Sheriff of Buckinghamshire in 1889. On 3 Jun 1915, he was appointed a deputy lieutenant of Buckinghamshire. In 1919, he presided over the Desborough Committee which investigated the conditions that led to the crippling London Police Strike of August 1918. Its recommendations resulted in the enactment of the influential Police Act of 1919 which changed the working conditions of the police in London, Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham and elsewhere. Desborough was appointed CVO in 1907 and advanced to KCVO in 1908 and GCVO (Knight Grand Cross) in 1925; and in 1928 he was admitted as a Knight of the Order of the Garter. He was a Major of the 1st Battalion, Buckinghamshire Rifle Volunteers from February 1900. In November 1914, he was appointed President of the Central Association of Volunteer Training Corps, a voluntary home defence militia, until it was disbanded in 1920. From 1924 to 1929 he was Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard. Between 1919 and 1929 he was chairman of the Pilgrims of Great Britain. He planned and oversaw the construction the Desborough Cut a navigation channel between nearby stretches of the Thames at Walton-on-Thames and Weybridge which was opened in 1935. The large island created thereby was named Desborough Island. Desborough had the unfortunate distinction of having an obituary prematurely published on 2 December 1920 by The Times which confused the event with the death of Lord Bessborough – Desborough died 25 years later at the age of 89. Family Taplow Court front view Lord Desborough married Ethel Fane (27 June 1867 – 28 May 1952), daughter of the Hon. Julian Fane and granddaughter of John Fane, 11th Earl of Westmorland, in 1887. They had three sons and two daughters. His eldest son was the poet Julian Grenfell, who was killed in action in 1915. His second son, Gerald William Grenfell, was also killed about two months after his elder brother. His third son, Ivo George Grenfell, died in 1926 as the result of a car accident. As all his sons predeceased him, the barony became extinct. They lived at Taplow Court where he and his wife hosted gatherings of the elite and aristocratic group, the 'Souls', adjacent on the riverside to Cliveden, which is a slightly grander country estate, but which saw its social heyday immediately after, from 1920 to 1965. Lady Desborough was a well-known celebrity in her day. Margot Asquith, whose husband would later be politically aligned against Desborough, said of her, She tells enough white lies to ice a wedding cake. In 1892, he built a stické court at the house. He was the owner of Whiteslea Lodge on the Hickling Estate in Norfolk, close to the Hickling Broad. This was the former shooting lodge of Whiteslea Estate and was extensively improved and added to by Lord Desborough in the 1930s. Its interior featured enormous friezes by bird artist Roland Green.

He published language studies in both English and German, and an 1880 work in German was reprinted in 2010. He also published several annotated scholarly editions of important German-language and Spanish-language dramas from the 18th and 19th centuries. He taught for more than 20 years at the University of Texas at Austin, where he also headed the Romance language department as well as a new German-language department. Primer grew up in western New York state and served with its units in the American Civil War. After the war, he completed preparatory studies, followed by his undergraduate degree at Harvard University. He did graduate studies in linguistics in Germany, where he received his PhD at the University of Strasbourg. He taught first at Brown University, then a decade at the College of Charleston, and briefly at Colorado College before joining the faculty in Texas. Early life and education Born in Geneva, Wisconsin on December 14, 1842, as the son of Archibald and Eleanor (Jacoby) Primer, Sylvester moved in 1850 as a child with his family to New York.Lura N. Rouse, \\"Primer, Sylvester\\", Handbook of Texas Online, accessed November 5, 2014. Uploaded on June 15, 2010. Published by the Texas State Historical Association They settled in the western part of the state in Genesee County. He attended local schools as a child. His higher education was interrupted by his serving in the American Civil War. Afterward Primer completed studies at Leroy (N.Y.) Academy until 1868 and the Phillips Exeter Academy until 1871. He went to college, studying languages at Harvard University, where he earned a bachelor's degree in 1874 and was Phi Beta Kappa. He went to Europe to study with scholars there and worked at Leipzig, Göttingen, and Strasbourg, where he received his PhD in 1880. Civil War Primer served in the American Civil War, first in Company E of the 105th Regiment New York Volunteer Infantry from Genesee County, New York. He was with them when wounded during the Battle of Antietam. After his recovery, Primer later enlisted in and served with the Fifteenth New York Cavalry. Academic career as linguist After completing his graduate work, Primer returned to the United States, teaching first at Brown University (1880–1881). He taught at the College of Charleston in South Carolina from 1881 to 1890. During this period, he first directed scholarly attention toward the unique dialect of the city of Charleston in a paper he delivered at the Modern Language Association of America in 1887.\\"Charleston Provincialisms\\" (1887), Internet Archive and Early Journal Content on JSTOR, accessed 5 November 2014 This pioneering work, \\"Charleston Provincialisms\\" (1887), is one of the first attempts by a scholar to describe the speech of an American community. It was published as part of the Transactions of the Modern Language Association, vol. III, 1888, p. 84–99; it was also published in Europe in Phonetische Studien, vol. i, 1888, p. 227; and in the American Journal of Philology, IX (1888), p. 198–213. Primer also wrote \\"The Huguenot Element in Charleston's Provincialisms;\\" it was published in Phonetische Studien, vol. iii, 1891, p. 139\\\\. In 1891, Primer joined the faculty of the University of Texas at Austin, where he served for more than 20 years. He first served as adjunct professor of Teutonic languages, eventually becoming an associate professor. He became chairman of the School of Romance language and in time, chair of a separate German department established at the university. There had been strong German immigration to the state during the mid- and late 19th century. Primer died at his home in Austin on August 13, 1912, survived by his wife and son. In Texas, his wife Lula Primer worked at the university after his death, retiring in 1941. She wrote her memoirs in the 1940s, which reflected her life in Texas. She had long been active in the University Methodist Church, the University Ladies Club, the Austin's Women's Club, and the Travis County Council of Women.

It was published in 1985 to commercial and critical success, winning a number of awards and being short-listed for the Booker Prize. Considered metafiction or magical realism, the novel is narrated by liar, trickster, and confidence man Herbert Badgery, the \\"illywhacker\\" of the title, and tells the story of his picaresque life in Australia between 1919 and the 1980s. Plot summary The novel is related in broad chronological order by the main protagonist, Herbert Badgery, but with frequent digressions that relate the circumstances and life history of Badgery himself, and of many of the characters he meets. The story begins in 1919 when the thirty-three-year-old Herbert lands his aeroplane in a field close to the wealthy former bullock-herder Jack McGrath. Herbert befriends Jack and persuades him to invest in the construction of an aeroplane factory. Herbert also becomes the lover of Jack's teenage daughter Phoebe, who had previously been involved in a lesbian relationship with a teacher, Annette Davidson. Jack commits suicide following a violent argument between Herbert and some other potential investors. Herbert marries Phoebe and they bear two children, Charles and Sonia. After learning to fly Herbert's aeroplane, Phoebe steals it, abandoning her husband and children to live with Annette. Herbert briefly becomes the lover of Jack's widow, Molly, but goes out on the road to scrape a living, often as a confidence trickster, accompanied by his two children. He meets Leah Goldstein, a former medical student turned dancer who is married to the Communist agitator Izzie Kaletsky. She and Herbert become lovers and develop a variety act, but Leah returns to care for Izzie after he has both legs amputated following an accident. Sonia dies, and Herbert is subsequently jailed for an assault on a Chinese man who had been his childhood mentor, Goon Tse Ying, whose finger is torn off. In prison, Herbert is presented with the preserved finger in a jar, and finds that looking into the jar presents the viewer with curious visions. Herbert, who for much of his life had been illiterate, begins studying, and eventually obtains a degree in Australian history. Charles becomes a dealer in animals, and meets Emma Underhill when required to rescue her from the clutches of a frightened goanna. Charles falls in love with and weds Emma, despite warnings from her father about her fragile mental state. Charles builds a successful business selling animals and moves into larger and larger premises. Upon the outbreak of World War Two, he considers enlisting, but is rejected because of his hearing. Traumatised by his decision, Emma retreats into the goanna's cage and continues living in an adapted cage for the rest of her life. Leah returns to help Charles, but also begins living in a cage, as part of Charles' extended household. After his release from prison, Herbert goes to live with Charles at the pet emporium. He attempts to rebuild part of Charles' shop, but the attempt ends in disaster. Herbert befriends Charles' youngest son, Hissao, who dreams of becoming an architect. Herbert suffers a stroke, and Charles is obliged to consider how his shop can continue to maintain the support of his American backers, who wish to export animals illegally against Charles' wishes. Emma comes into possession of the jar of Herbert's that contains Ying's finger and claims that she sees a reptile in the bottle that she also claims is Hissao's half- brother. Distraught by the claim, Charles shoots Emma's goanna, and turns the gun on himself. Hissao claims he will not give up architecture in order to preserve the family business by becoming an animal smuggler, but does so, and becomes wealthy and much-travelled. He accidentally kills a rare bird he is smuggling, whereupon he sells much of his share in the business to Japanese investors and commences rebuilding the emporium to his own design, according to which it becomes a bizarre and controversial museum of the Australian nation. Reception Illywhacker was well-received by critics and won a number of awards. Reviewing the book in the New York Times, Howard Jacobson called it \\"a big, garrulous, funny novel, touching, farcical and passionately bad-tempered...

The Nahua are one of the main cultural groups of Mesoamerica. History The Cuyuteco people also known as Cuyuteca, was a tribe of the Nahua culture. The Nahua are one the main culture groups in Mesoamerica. The Cuyuteca were a Late Postclassic period group, with estimated 12th century arrival in the Xalisco region. From the migration period, and the Cuyuteco language a Uto-Aztecan Nahuatl language, they appear descended from ancient Nahua peoples that originated in Aridoamerica, in the deserts of present-day northwestern Mexico and the southwestern United States. From the 10th to the 16th centuries, many nomadic tribes hunted game in Jalisco’s central valley. The Cuyuteco Indians lived near the present-day towns of Cuyutlán and Mixtlán, and the Coca occupied the vicinity of Guadalajara. The region extending from Guadalajara northeast to Lagos de Moreno was home to the Tecuexes. It is believed that the Cuyuteco tribe became extinct due to cultural suppression from the Spanish. Present day Archaeological sites are in and around the present day towns of Tecolotlán, Tenamaxtlán, Juchitlán, Atengo, and Atenguillo in Jalisco; and Valle de Banderas in Nayarit.

They primarily live in the Afar Region of Ethiopia and in northern Djibouti, as well as the entire southern coast of Eritrea. The Afar speak the Afar language, which is part of the Cushitic branch of the Afroasiatic family. Afars are the only Horners whose traditional territories borders both the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden and like the Issa clan they do not trace ancestry to Arabia.Fairhead, J. D., and R. W. Girdler. \\"A discussion on the structure and evolution of the Red Sea and the nature of the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden and Ethiopia rift junction-The seismicity of the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden and Afar triangle.\\" Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series A, Mathematical and Physical Sciences 267.1181 (1970): 49–74. HistoryOrigins= The Afar traditions include conversion to Islam from the 7th century onwards. For example, genealogies trace lineages back to ancestors from Arabian Peninsula. Mixtures and circulations between the two shores of the Red Sea and inside the Horn are certain even if we are not able to specify them. According to linguistic analyzes, the Afars and the Saho are the first peoples published in this horn of Africa. Bones and traces of prehistoric peoples can be found in the Afar Region. Their language forms a distinct whole within the Cushitic languages which then split. The Afars are described by Herodotus as being Ethiopian troglodytes living along the Red Sea that the Garamantes hunted. The troglodytes live in caves, the word \\"Afar\\" undoubtedly has a Berber origin, because this word means \\"inhabitant of caves\\" which translates well the troglodyte habitat that Herodotus attributes to them. This word is not attested in the Afar language (referred to as \\"Adal\\") according to some theories on the etymology of this word. This name may have been given by the Garamante Berbers who named them so because of their troglodyte habitat. =Early history= Territory of the Adal Sultanate and its vassal states (ca. 1500). The earliest surviving written mention of the Afar is from the 13th- century Andalusian writer Ibn Sa'id, who reported that they inhabited the area around the port of Suakin, as far south as Mandeb, near Zeila.Richard Pankhurst, The Ethiopian Borderlands (Lawrenceville: Red Sea Press, 1997), p. 60 They are mentioned intermittently in Ethiopian records, first as helping Emperor Amda Seyon in a campaign beyond the Awash River, then over a century later when they assisted Emperor Baeda Maryam when he campaigned against their neighbors the Dobe'a.Pankhurst, Borderlands, pp. 61-67, 106f. Along with the closely related Somali and other adjacent Afro-Asiatic-speaking Muslim peoples, the Afar are also associated with the medieval Adal Sultanate that controlled large parts of the northern Horn of Africa. After the death of the Adal leader Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi, Afar settlements were overtaken in Hararghe by the result of the Oromo migrations. The Issa Somali also took advantage of the crippled Afar and occupied large swaths of their territory in the north west of East Africa. =Aussa States= State flag of the Aussa Sultanate. Afar society has traditionally been organized into independent kingdoms, each ruled by its own Sultan. Among these were the Sultanate of Aussa, Sultanate of Girrifo, Sultanate of Dawe, Sultanate of Tadjourah, Sultanate of Rahaito, and Sultanate of Goobad.Matt Phillips, Jean-Bernard Carillet, Lonely Planet Ethiopia and Eritrea, (Lonely Planet: 2006), p. 301. In 1577, the Adal leader Imam Muhammed Jasa moved his capital from Harar to Aussa in modern Afar region. In 1647, the rulers of the Emirate of Harar broke away to form their own polity. Harari imams continued to have a presence in the southern Afar Region until they were overthrown in the eighteenth century by the Mudaito dynasty of Afar who later established the Sultanate of Aussa. The primary symbol of the Sultan was a silver baton, which was considered to have magical properties.Trimingham, p. 262. =Pre-19th century= From the 1840s, some Afar's help Europeans by providing, for a fee, the security of Western caravans that circulated between the southern coast of the Red Sea and central Ethiopia. Towards the end of the 19th century, the sultanates of Raheita and Tadjoura on the coasts of the Red Sea are then colonized between European powers: Italy forms Italian Eritrea with Assab and Massawa, and France the French Somaliland in Djibouti, but the inland Aussa in the south was able to maintain its independence for longer. Even comparatively fertile and located on the Awash River, it was demarcated from the outside by surrounding desert areas. It was not until 1895 that Ethiopia, under Emperor Menelik II of Ethiopia, sent an army from Shewa against Aussa on the grounds that the Sultan had allied himself with the Italian colonizers. As a result, the sultanate paid tribute to Ethiopia, but retained extensive autonomy. =Afar Liberation Front= Official flag of the Afar Revolutionary Democratic Unity Front. When a modern administrative system was introduced in Ethiopia after the Second World War, the Afar areas controlled by Ethiopia were divided into the provinces of Eritrea, Tigray, Wollo, Shewa and Hararge. Tribal leaders, elders and religious and other dignitaries of the Afar tried unsuccessfully in the government from 1961 to end this division. Following an unsuccessful rebellion led by the Afar Sultan, Alimirah Hanfare, the Afar Liberation Front was founded in 1975 to promote the interests of the Afar people. Sultan Hanfadhe was shortly afterwards exiled to Saudi Arabia. Ethiopia's then-ruling communist Derg regime later established the Autonomous Region of Assab (now called Aseb and located in Eritrea), although low level insurrection continued until the early 1990s. In Djibouti, a similar movement simmered throughout the 1980s, eventually culminating in the Afar Insurgency in 1991. After the fall of the Derg that same year, Sultan Hanfadhe returned from exile. In March 1993, the Afar Revolutionary Democratic Front (ARDUF) was established. It constituted a coalition of three Afar organizations: the Afar Revolutionary Democratic Unity Union (ARDUU), founded in 1991 and led by Mohamooda Gaas (or Gaaz); the Afar Ummatah Demokrasiyyoh Focca (AUDF); and the Afar Revolutionary Forces (ARF). A political party, it aims to protect Afar interests. As of 2012, the ARDUF is part of the United Ethiopian Democratic Forces (UEDF) coalition opposition party.Ethiopia - Political Parties, Accessed: 1-07-2006. DemographicsGeographical distribution= Approximate area inhabited by the Afar ethnic group. The Afar principally reside in the Danakil Desert in the Afar Region of Ethiopia, as well as in Eritrea and Djibouti. They number 2,276,867 people in Ethiopia (or 2.73% of the total population), of whom 105,551 are urban inhabitants, according to the most recent census (2007).\\"Country level\\" , Table 3.1, p.73. The Afar make up over a third of the population of Djibouti, and are one of the nine recognized ethnic divisions (kililoch) of Ethiopia. =Language= ISO 639 icon for the Afar language Afars speak the Afar language as a mother tongue. It is part of the Cushitic branch of the Afroasiatic language family. The Afar language is spoken by ethnic Afars in the Afar Region of Ethiopia, as well as in southern Eritrea and northern Djibouti. However, since the Afar are traditionally nomadic herders, Afar speakers may be found further afield. Together, with the Saho language, Afar constitutes the Saho–Afar dialect cluster. =Religion= Afar people are predominantly Muslim. They have a long association with Islam through the various local Muslim polities and practice the Sunni form of Islam, or non-denominational Islam. The Afar mainly follow the Shafi'i school of Sunni Islam. Sufi orders like the Qadiriyya are also widespread among the Afar. Afar religious life is somewhat syncretic with a blend of Islamic concepts and pre-Islamic ones such as rain sacrifices on sacred locations, divination, and folk healing. Another strand or self-identification adopted by the Afar is that of the non-denominational Muslim.Brugnatelli, Vermondo. \\"Arab-Berber contacts in the Middle Ages and Ancient Arabic dialects: new evidence from an old Ibadite religious text.\\" African Arabic: approaches to dialectology. Berlin: de Gruyter (2013): 271–291. = Culture = Socially, they are organized into clan families led by elders and two main classes: the asaimara ('reds') who are the dominant class politically, and the adoimara ('whites') who are a working class and are found in the Mabla Mountains. Clans can be fluid and even include outsiders like the (Issa clan). Portrait of a young Afar man in traditional attire along the Awash. In addition, the Afar are reputed for their martial prowess. Men traditionally sport the jile, a famous curved knife. They also have an extensive repertoire of battle songs. The Afar are mainly livestock holders. They mostly raise camels but also tend to goats, sheep, and cattle. However, shrinking pastures for their livestock and environmental degradation have made some Afar instead turn to cultivation, migrant labor, and trade. The Ethiopian Afar have traditionally engaged in salt trading but recently Tigrayans have taken much of this occupation.

The name is derived from either TjiKalanga and Tshivenda. The name might mean \\"Hill of Jackals\\".http://www.sahistory.org.za/article/mapungubwe The kingdom was the first stage in a development that would culminate in the creation of the Kingdom of Zimbabwe in the 13th century, and with gold trading links to Rhapta and Kilwa Kisiwani on the African east coast. The Kingdom of Mapungubwe lasted about 80 years, and at its height the capital's population was about 5000 people.Huffman, page 376 This archaeological site can be attributed to the BuKalanga Kingdom, which comprises the Bakalanga people from northeast Botswana, the Kalanga from Western Zimbabwe, the Nambya on the Zambezi Valley, and the Vha Venda in the northeast of South Africa. They crossed the Limpopo River to the south, and established their kingdom where the Shashe and Limpopo conjoined (Sha-limpo). The Mapungubwe Collection is a museum collection of artifacts found at the archaeological site and is housed in the Mapungubwe Museum in Pretoria. Origin The largest settlement from what has been dubbed the Leopard's Kopje culture is known as the K2 culture and was the immediate predecessor to the settlement of Mapungubwe.Hrbek, page 322 The people of the K2 culture, probably derived from the ancestors of the Shona people of southern Africahttps://www.sahistory.org.za/article/kingdoms- southern-africa-mapungubwe, was attracted to the Shashi-Limpopo area, likely because it provided mixed agricultural possibilities.Hrbek, page 323 The area was also prime elephant country, providing access to valuable ivory. The control of the gold and ivory trade greatly increased the political power of the K2 culture.Hrbek, page 326 By 1075, the population of K2 had outgrown the area and relocated to Mapungubwe Hill.Hrbek, page 324 Stone masonry Spatial organisation in the kingdom of Mapungubwe involved the use of stone walls to demarcate important areas for the first time. There was a stone- walled residence likely occupied by the principal councillor.Hrbek, page 325 Stone and wood were used together. There would have also been a wooden palisade surrounding Mapungubwe Hill. Most of the capital's population would have lived inside the western wall. Origins of the name The name may derive from the Shona word for Bateleur eagle The capital of the kingdom was called Mapungubwe, which is where the kingdom gets its name. The site of the city is now a World Heritage Site, South African National Heritage Site, national park, and archaeological site. There is controversy regarding the origin and meaning of the name Mapungubwe. Conventional wisdom has it that Mapungubwe means \\"place of jackals,\\" or alternatively, \\"place where jackals eat\\", thavha ya dzi phunguhwe, or, according to Fouché—one of the earliest excavators of Mapungubwe—\\"hill of the jackals\\" (Fouché, 1937 p. 1). It also means \\"place of wisdom\\" and \\"the place where the rock turns into liquid\\"—from various ethnicities in the region including the Pedi, Sotho, Venda and Kalanga. Culture and society Mapungubwean society is thought by archaeologists to be the first class-based social system in southern Africa; that is, its leaders were separated from and higher in rank than its inhabitants. Mapungubwe's architecture and spatial arrangement also provide \\"the earliest evidence for sacred leadership in southern Africa\\". Life in Mapungubwe was centred on family and farming. Special sites were created for initiation ceremonies, household activities, and other social functions. Cattle lived in kraals located close to the residents' houses, signifying their value. Most speculation about society continues to be based upon the remains of buildings, since the Mapungubweans left no written record. The kingdom was likely divided into a three-tiered hierarchy with the commoners inhabiting low-lying sites, district leaders occupying small hilltops, and the capital at Mapungubwe hill as the supreme authority. Elites within the kingdom were buried in hills. Royal wives lived in their own area away from the king. Important men maintained prestigious homes on the outskirts of the capital. This type of spatial division occurred first at Mapungubwe but would be replicated in later Butua and Rozwi states. The growth in population at Mapungubwe may have led to full-time specialists in ceramics, specifically pottery. Gold objects were uncovered in elite burials on the royal hill (Mapungubwe Hill). Re-discovery On New Year's Eve 1932, ESJ van Graan, a local farmer and prospector, and his son, a former student of the University of Pretoria, set out to follow up on a legend he had heard about. According to an article published in 1985, translated from the Afrikaans text: Remains of a Rock Fort located on top of the hill were under investigation, dated back to the 11th century. The Archeological site is closed to the public, except for supervised visits and tours. However some of the items discovered were on display at the Department of Archeology, at the University of Pretoria. Mapungubwe Hill and K2 were declared national monuments in the 1980s by the government. Mapungubwe was added to the South African grade 6 curriculum in 2003. Burials at Mapungubwe Hill At least twenty four skeletons were unearthed on Mapungubwe hill but only eleven were available for analysis, with the rest disintegrating upon touch or as soon as they were exposed to light and air. Most of the skeletal remains were buried with few or no accessories, with most adults buried with glass beads. Two adult burials (labeled numbers 10 and 14 by the early excavators) as well as one unlabelled skeleton (referred to as the original gold burial)A. Duffey 2012. Mapungubwe: Interpretation of the Gold Content of the Original Gold Burial M1, A620. Journal of African Archaeology 10 (2), 2012, pages 175–187. were associated with gold artefacts and were unearthed from the so-called grave area upon Mapungubwe Hill. Recent genetic studies found these first two skeletons to be of Khoi/San descent and thought to be a king and queen of Mapungubwe. Despite this latest information the remains were all buried in the traditional Bantu burial position (sitting with legs drawn to the chest, arms folded round the front of the knees) and they were facing west. The skeleton numbered 10, a male, was buried with his hand grasping a golden scepter. The skeleton labelled number 14 (female) was buried with at least 100 gold wire bangles around her ankles and there were at least one thousand gold beads in her grave. The last gold burial (male), who was most probably the king, was buried with a headrest and three objects made of gold foil tacked onto a wooden core, depicting a bowl, scepter and rhino. At least two more rhinos were in the sample, but their association with a specific grave is unknown. In 2007, the South African Government gave the green light for the skeletal remains that were excavated in 1933 to be reburied on Mapungubwe Hill in a ceremony that took place on 20 November 2007. The Mapungubwe Landscape was declared a World Heritage Site on 3 July 2003. Mapungubwe National Park The area is now part of Mapungubwe National Park, which in turn is part of the Greater Mapungubwe Transfrontier Conservation Area. South Africa's contribution to the trans-frontier conservation area consists of the Mapungubwe National Park, Venetia Limpopo Nature Reserve, Limpopo Valley Conservancy, Mapesu Private Game Reserve, the proposed Mogalakwena Game Reserve, the Vhembe Game Reserve as well as a number of smaller private farms. The total proposed area will be 256,100 hectares or 53% of the entire Greater Mapungubwe Transfrontier Conservation Area. Botswana's contribution to the Conservation Area consists of the Northern Tuli Game Reserve, covering an area of 71,173ha. In phase two the area is expected to increase in size with the inclusion of the Central Tuli Farms and the proposed Shashe CCA. In addition, the area roughly extending from the town of Mathathane North to Kobojango and onwards to the Shashe River will also form part of the GMTFCA. In total Botswana's contribution to the TFCA is expected to be 135,000ha, roughly 28% of the total area of the Greater Mapungubwe Transfrontier Conservation Area. Sentinel Ranch, Nottingham Estate and the Tuli Circle Safari Area make up Zimbabwe's contribution to the GMTFCA. In phase two the Maramani, Machuchuta as well as Hwali Wildlife Management Areas may also be included extending the size of Zimbabwe's contribution to the Greater Mapungubwe Transfrontier Conservation Area to 96,000 hectares or roughly 19%.

The castle is known for its gardens, described by Historic Environment Scotland as \\"the best example of formal terraced gardens in Scotland.\\" It is situated in Muthill parish, south of Crieff. The castle comprises a tower house built in the late 15th century, and a 17th-century mansion, both of which were rebuilt in Victorian times. The gardens date to the 1630s, although they too were restructured in the 19th century. The formal gardens are protected as a category A listed building, and are included on the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland. The tower house and mansion are both category B listed. History The lands of Drummond were the property of the Drummond family from the 14th century, and the original tower house was built over several years by John Drummond, 1st Lord Drummond of Cargill, from about 1490. In 1605 the 4th Lord Drummond was created Earl of Perth, and added to the castle. The 2nd Earl of Perth laid out the first terraced garden around the castle in the 1630s. The castle was sacked by the army of Oliver Cromwell in 1653, during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. The 4th Earl of Perth was Lord Chancellor of Scotland under King James VII. He began the mansion house in 1689, before being imprisoned following the deposition of King James by William of Orange. He later fled to the exiled Jacobite court in France. The Drummonds continued to support the Jacobite cause in the Jacobite uprisings of 1715 and 1745. The family retained control of the estate until 1750 when the Drummond properties were declared forfeit and seized by the state. The estate was managed by the Commissioners for Forfeited Estates until 1784, when it was sold to Captain James Drummond (later created 1st Baron Perth). He began a number of improvements that were continued by his daughter Sarah and her husband, The 22nd Baron Willoughby de Eresby (1782–1865). These included the formal gardens and terraces in the 1830s. Queen Victoria visited the gardens in 1842. Drummond Castle passed to The 24th Baroness Willoughby de Eresby (1809–1888), and then to her son, The 1st Earl of Ancaster (1830–1910). The upper stories of the tower house were rebuilt and heightened in pseudo-medieval style in 1842–53. The mansion was renovated in 1878, to designs by George Turnbull Ewing. The 3rd Earl of Ancaster and his wife, Nancy Astor (1909–1975; she was the daughter of The 2nd Viscount Astor and The Viscountess Astor), replanted the gardens in the 1950s. The castle is now the seat of The Rt Hon. The 28th Baroness Willoughby de Eresby, the daughter and heir of The 3rd Lord Ancaster. Description The castle is set on part of a prominent spine of rock known as the Gask Ridge, a geographical feature that stretches several kilometres across Perthshire, but is particularly prominent and steep-sided at the site of the castle. The tower house, or keep, is no longer used as a dwelling. It is adjoined by a later, but better preserved, gatehouse (built 1629–30). Stretching between the tower house and the edge of the ridge, it was originally intended to control access to the courtyard behind, which has a fine view over the formal gardens. To the south of the castle on its rocky outcrop are the formal gardens. The buildings and gardens of Drummond Castle featured as backdrops in the 1995 film Rob Roy.

It was formed at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 1997 (CHOGM) in Edinburgh, United Kingdom, and replaced in July 2014 by the Commonwealth Enterprise and Investment Council (CWEIC).Policy & Resources Committee report, City of London Corporation, 19 February 2015 The CBC acted as a bridge for cooperation between business and government, concentrating efforts on these specific areas: *Enhancing Trade *Mobilising Investment *Promoting Corporate Citizenship *Facilitating ICT for Development *Public Private Partnerships Commonwealth countries are major stakeholders in the process and success of the Doha Development Agenda. Together the Commonwealth’s 53 member countries account for 30 per cent of the world’s population and about 25 per cent of its international trade and investment. Commonwealth countries account for 40 per cent of WTO membership. CBC’s trade development objectives include encouraging trade facilitation and further liberalisation of services; encouraging developing countries to play an active role in the World Trade Organization, and in new trade rounds, by maximising their negotiating strength through cooperative action. The CBC helps to mobilise investment into Commonwealth countries through measures including ensuring access to international capital markets; strengthening 26 domestic capital markets; encouraging regional integration; committing the private sector to work together with governments to help achieve a successful market economy for generating investment. A key feature of CBC was its global membership, comprising corporate members from both developed and developing countries. This gave CBC the capacity to make a special contribution to the debate on corporate citizenship, dominated by developed countries. The CBC worked to involve private sector engagement in facilitating the implementation of an Information Communications Technologies for Development programme. The CBC programme enhanced collaborative partnerships between the various stakeholders including governments, private sector, donor agencies and civil society. Major goals included: *Bridge the digital divide for both social and economic development. *Promote ICT for Development in Commonwealth countries. *Promote an experience exchange among stakeholders in Commonwealth countries. *Promote business and government cooperation for development. *Create awareness and enhance the knowledge of policy makers regarding economic, technical and legal aspects of implementation of ICT for development. *Provide and facilitate training and capacity building. CBC believed that there was a significant gap for independent support to emerging market governments in the structuring and transacting of ICT infrastructure opportunities. The key CBC objectives were: *Examine how support from highly experienced individuals can assist through the creation of an infrastructure technical advisory unit. *Provide senior-level government support to provide focused advice. *Provide mechanisms that will help governments leverage the huge capacity of the private sector to address the demand for better infrastructure.

She is a voodoo priestess who utilizes magic potions, and the occasional lover and partner of Kraven the Hunter. Publication history Calypso first appeared in Amazing Spider-Man #209 and was created by Denny O'Neil and Alan Weiss. Calypso initially appeared as a minor character The Amazing Spider-Man #209 and Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man #65, where she was an ally of Spider-Man's enemy Kraven the Hunter. After Kraven's death, Calypso bewitched the Lizard into helping her attack Spider-Man in Spider-Man Vol. 1, #1-5, then made guest appearances in Daredevil Vol. 1, #310-311 and Daredevil Annual Vol. 1, #9. Calypso next appeared in Web of Spider-Man Vol. 1, #109-110 and Spider-Man Annual 1997, and was killed off in a storyline that spanned The Spectacular Spider-Man Vol. 1, #249-253. Fictional character biography Calypso is a nameless voodoo priestess of Haitian nationality. She was a psychopathic woman who was associated with Kraven the Hunter. Calypso seemed to enjoy driving Kraven into fits of rage and furthering his hatred of Spider- Man which ultimately led to Kraven's suicide in the \\"Kraven's Last Hunt\\" storyline. When artist Todd McFarlane started writing the new Spider-Man comic in 1990, his opening five-issue story arc \\"Torment\\" featured Calypso as the main antagonist, whom McFarlane transformed into a dangerous threat for Spider-Man. The explanation for Calypso's supernatural powers was the sacrifice of her younger sister. She used her abilities to hold Lizard in her grasp and the two nearly succeeded in murdering Spider-Man. However, the webslinger managed to beat them both and Calypso is apparently killed. Calypso resurfaces abducting Haitian refugees, turning some into zombie slaves and selling the rest back to her homeland's government. Her actions bring her into conflict with Daredevil and his Infinity War doppelganger, Hellspawn. Calypso briefly enthralls Daredevil, but he is able to break free of her control, and she seemingly dies yet again when the spirits of those she turned into zombies overwhelm her. Cheating death once more, Calypso flees to New Orleans, where her obsession with necromancy leads her to the resting place of Simon Garth, a self-aware zombie. Reviving Garth, Calypso tests his abilities and pits him against Hellspawn, though he eventually breaks free of her control and wanders off, leaving one of his Amulets of Damballah with Calypso. Calypso subsequently breaks into the Vault and attempts to make the incarcerated Lizard her servant again, but he resists and mauls her. The Amulet of Damballah, which Calypso transferred her soul into while dying, ends up in the possession of Glory Grant, who Calypso possesses. Despite interference from Spider-Man, Garth, and Shotgun, Calypso is successfully able to exhume her own corpse and revive herself with the Amulet of Damballah. Commanding a squad of savages, she later attacks Spider-Man and Alyosha Kravinoff, the son of the original Kraven the Hunter. Desiring revenge for losing Sergei, she uses her powers to drive Spider-Man and Alyosha into fighting each other. Spider-Man and Alyosha fight off her spell, and shared a handshake. Alyosha says that he will hold Calypso at his mansion, so the villainess can tell him about his long-lost father. However, Alyosha kills Calypso instead. Powers and abilities Calypso was well-versed in the religion and practice of voodoo. She often used voodoo drums, potions, and charms. Calypso used mind control, resurrection, and poisons. Other versions An issue of What If? which asked the question \\"What If Spider-Man Killed the Lizard?\\" had Calypso in it. When Spider-Man is forced to kill the Lizard in an alternate version of the \\"Torment\\" story-arc, Calypso approaches the Lizard's distraught son Billy Connors and offers him the chance to get revenge on Spider-Man via a potion that will make him \\"just like daddy\\". In other mediaTelevision= *In the 1990s Spider-Man: The Animated Series, Calypso was initially introduced as a research scientist named Dr. Mariah Crawford (voiced by Susan Beaubian) who was engaged to Sergei Kravinoff before his mystic serum transformed him into Kraven the Hunter, who affectionately calls her \\"Calypso\\". She assisted Spider-Man in several episodes, most notably helping him develop a cure for the Man-Spider mutation. During a confrontation with Man-Spider, Dr. Crawford was shown to be familiar with the Punisher's backstory and persuaded him to help Kraven subdue the Man-Spider, allowing her to restore him back to normal. In the episode \\"The Return of Kraven\\", Mariah contacted an African plague and, in an effort to save her, Kraven injected her with the same serum that she used on him some time ago. However, upon their return to New York, this caused Mariah to mutate into a feral monster, with claws, green eyes, and lion-like ears, prompting Kraven to use the serum on himself to track her down. While Spider-Man initially mistakes Kraven for the one attacking people in Central Park, he learns the truth after subduing him, and Spider-Man and Black Cat ultimately help Kraven capture Calypso and administer a cure made by Dr. Curt Connors, which restores Mariah back to normal.

Chart Attack, September 18, By: Debbie Bento and Paul Gangadeen and it was not until the follow-up album, 2 a.m. Wakeup Call, that Clint Walsh was announced as a permanent fixture to the band. While Vrenna and Walsh supply most instruments and electronics, many other musicians contributed to Tweaker's performances and recordings, including Robert Smith, David Sylvian, Burton C. Bell, Craig Wedren, Will Oldham, Hamilton Leithauser, Buzz Osborne, Jonathan Bates and Johnny Marr. The subsequent albums followed a preset central theme. Tweaker wrote and performed the theme music to Doom 3, of which the theme song was released via the band's website. The rest of the soundtrack is accessible from the game's files. Tweaker also composed the theme music for the animated television show Xiaolin Showdown. Unlike the band's usual synthpop, shoegaze, modern jazz, Dark Ambient and industrial sound, the Doom 3 theme was mainly heavy metal. In 2004, Tweaker opened for Skinny Puppy on select dates with a full live band, consisting of Chris Vrenna (drums, percussion and keyboard), Clint Walsh (guitar and keyboard), William Faith (bass guitar) and Nick Young (vocals). They performed everything live (i.e., no pre-recorded tape), although they did have to alter some of their songs to fit the live format — the most extreme case being a completely revamped rock version of \\"Microsize Boy\\".

The program went through a protracted development stage but was never adopted by the United States Navy, due to the ending of the Cold War and the reduction in threat of its perceived primary target, Soviet supersonic bombers. Development was cancelled in 1992. Overview The AIM-152 originated in a U.S. Navy requirement for an advanced air-to-air missile to replace the AIM-54 Phoenix. By the mid-1980s the Phoenix was seen to be no longer cutting edge, and the Navy wanted a long range missile to counter the Soviet Tu-22M Backfire and Tu-160 Blackjack long-range supersonic bombers. The goal was to produce a weapon which was smaller and lighter than the Phoenix, with equal or better range and a flight speed of Mach 3 or more. An ACIMD demonstrator on an F-14 at the NWC China Lake. Some of the systems considered for the missile had already been evaluated by the China Lake Naval Weapons Center in the early 1980s as part of the Advanced Common Intercept Missile Demonstration (ACIMD) program. ACIMD missiles had been built but none had flown by the time the project was cancelled. In 1987, Hughes/Raytheon and General Dynamics/Westinghouse were selected to produce competing designs for the AIM-152. The Hughes/Raytheon design was largely based on the ACIMD missile, with a hybrid ramjet/solid rocket engine which offered high speeds. The missile would use an inertial guidance system with terminal guidance provided by active radar homing - a mode of flight that would later be employed in the AIM-120 AMRAAM. An infrared terminal homing seeker was also planned, which would allow the missile to engage without any emissions which would alert the target. The GD/Westinghouse design was even smaller, with a multiple-pulse pure solid rocket motor. It also had an inertial guidance system, but midcourse updating was provided via a dual-band semi-active radar. Terminal guidance was via an electro-optical sensor, with a backup infrared seeker also included. One flaw of semi-active radar homing is that the launch aircraft must illuminate the target with its radar during flight, meaning that it must fly towards the enemy and so expose itself to greater danger. GD/Westinghouse planned to avoid this by equipping the launching aircraft with a radar pod which could illuminate the target from both forward and aft, allowing it to turn and escape whilst still providing a target for the missile. With the fall of the Soviet Union the threat from Russian bombers effectively ended, and since no other nation could match the previous threat the AAAM was left without an enemy to defend against. The project was cancelled in 1992, shortly after the YAIM-152A designation had been given to the two prototypes. With the phasing out of the Phoenix missile the US Navy lost its long range AAM capability, relying instead on the medium range AIM-120 AMRAAM. Longer range versions of the AMRAAM are in development to restore some of this capability.

In the process, he named what is now Plymouth Harbor 'Whitson Bay' and a nearby hill 'Mount Aldworth' after the two Bristol merchants who provided him with ships and supplies. The harbour was later renamed by the Pilgrim fathers. He and his crew were the first known Europeans to ascend the Piscataqua River. It is thought that Italian explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano explored this part of the New England coast in 1524-25 looking for a route to the Far East but did not make landfall until he reached the St. Lawrence River. In 1606 Pring returned to America and mapped the Maine coast. Later he became a ship's master, sailing for the East India Company (EIC) and explored in East Asia, as well as preventing other nations from trading in the area. By 1619 he commanded all the Company's naval forces. Returning to England in 1621, he was made a member of the Virginia Company and granted land. After leaving the EIC in 1623, Pring served as a privateer for England, capturing several French and Spanish ships as prizes. Early life and education Martin Pring was born and raised in Feniton, Devonshire. The parish registers record his baptism in the church on 23 Apr 1580, son of John PRINGE of Thorne, (b. 1540bfr. – bur. 6 Feb 1630 Feniton) who married (30 Jun 1561 Feniton) Mary Clarke. Historians have not discovered details about his early life, but he apparently learned early about sailing out of Bristol. He started working on ships. Career In 1603, under patronage of the mayor, aldermen and merchants of Bristol, including Richard Hakluyt, Pring at the age of 23 was appointed as captain to command a ship and bark to explore the northern parts of the territory known as Virginia in North America and assess its commercial potential, financing it against a return cargo of sassafras.Martin Pring, \\"The Voyage of Martin Pring, 1603\\", Summary of his life and expeditions at American Journeys website, 2012, Wisconsin Historical Society His flagship, the Speedwell, was of 60 tons and 30 men. (A different Speedwell was one of those used by members of the Plymouth Colony 17 years later for their 1620 trip to America.) It was escorted by a barque, the Explorer (also known as Discoverer), of 26 tons and 13 men. The expedition was licensed by Sir Walter Raleigh and departed 10 April 1603. The two ships first made landfall about two months later at the entrance of Penobscot Bay in what is now the state of Maine. Heading west, they visited the mouths of the Saco, Kennebunk and York rivers, all of which Pring found \\"to pierce not far into the land.\\"Martin Pring, \\"The Voyage of Martin Pring, 1603\\", in Burrage, Henry S. (editor). Early English and French Voyages, Chiefly from Hakluyt, 1534–1608, New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1906, pp. 343–352, text online at American Journeys website, 2012, Wisconsin Historical Society In June, they arrived at the Piscataqua River, a tidal estuary, which he described as the westernmost and best river. Pring explored 10–12 miles into the interior by means of the Piscataqua, the center of which now forms part of the border between Maine and New Hampshire. He and his crew are the first Europeans known to have done so. Anchoring the Speedwell at the lower harbour, Pring boarded the smaller Explorer and, aided by oarsmen, ascended the Piscataqua. They sounded its depth, which they found impressive, and explored its banks. Pring admired the area's \\"goodly groves and woods.\\"Pring (1906), The Voyage They encountered the native Abenaki people and Pring's description of them provides significant details of pre-colonial Native American life. At that time of year, the Abenaki would likely have been upriver at the Piscataqua's tributaries, where fish and game were plentiful around the numerous falls. Pring must have been anticipating hostile (or unwanted) Native activity because they brought with them \\"two excellent Mastives\\", one of which \\"would carrie a halfe-Pike in his mouth\\". Of the use of these dogs Pring wrote: \\"when we would be rid of the Savages company wee would let loose the Mastives, and suddenly without cry they would flee away.\\" reprinted in and The Explorer sailed into Great Bay, where the crew sought the sassafras (or \\"ague tree\\"), then considered an elixir of life with great medicinal value in treating fevers. Finding none, they returned to meet the Speedwell, together continuing down the coast. They found sassafras in sufficient quantity in a bay, and immediately built a barricado for defense against the inhabitants. reprinted in and . Pring insisted that they were constantly visited by groups of Natives as large as \\"one hundred and twentie at once\\". reprinted in and . He does not explain, however, how relations with the locals deteriorated from harmony to the day when the settlers fired their cannon and set the mastiffs on 140 of them, reprinted in and . but it probably had to do with the abrupt conduct of the English, insensitivity to local customs (which they used only when convenient), and their brutal use of the dogs. Engraved illustration of Pring's barricade in 1706 Dutch translation of the account in Purchas. The expedition spent two months ashore at the mouth of the Pamet River on Cape Cod, in what is now Truro, Massachusetts. The explorers erected a small stockade below Cornhill, which would be noted by the Pilgrims on their subsequent journey to the New World. Subsisting on a variety of fish and game, Captain Pring's men harvested sassafras trees for export to England. The Explorer departed first with a load of sassafras. Pring's ship Speedwell was attacked by a large force of Wampanoag, but the ship's two mastiffs had woken the guard and held off the warriors. As the ship departed, warriors burned the woods on shore and more than 200 shouted at the sailors. The natives had earlier fled the area where the expedition camped. Pring's men had found one of their birch bark canoes, which he brought to England. He departed 8 or 9 August, and reached England on 2 October. Later career Pring continued to participate in commercial expeditions that created important trade networks and laid the base for colonisation: in 1606 he returned to Maine and mapped the coast. He started to work for the East India Company, where by 1613 he served as ship's master. He helped exclude the Spanish and Portuguese from East Indies markets. By 1619, he commanded all of the naval forces for the Company. In 1618; sailing with the 1000 tonne flagship Royal James (launched 1617) and the fleet of the Royal Anne, the Gift, the Bull and the Bee; Pring travelled to Sumatra for the EIC, onto Jakarta in September 1618 to war with the Dutch, after they attacked English merchants in the Moluccas. Pring was joined by Thomas Dale with another fleet of 6 English ships to fight the Dutch in Banten Bay. Pring captured a wealthy Dutch merchant ship having left Japan, then sailing to Coromandel Coast for repairs. Pring then took over the fleet in August 1619 when Dale died in Machilipatnam. In the Sunda Strait near to the Sumatra coastline, he met 3 more English ships of another fleet who had being pursued by the Dutch from Java at having set anchor there. Pring decided to send 3 ships north and to proceed on to Japan himself on the basis of repair and provisions for the fleet. With another 2 English ships, the Elizabeth and the Bull, he sailed to Japan on 23 July 1620, docking at Hirado Island, making contact with the factor Richard Cocks and departing Japan with the will of the recently bereaved EIC employee, William Adams on 26 December 1620.https://www.british-history.ac.uk/cal-state-papers/colonial/east-indies- china-japan/vol3/pp395-408Japan as it was and is, Richard Hildreth, 1855, pp. 182 - 185 In 1621 Pring returned to England, where he was made a freeman of the Virginia Company. He was granted 200 acres. Although he resigned from the Dutch East Indies Company in 1623, he soon returned to sea, serving as a privateer for England. He took many prizes in French and Spanish trading ships. Pring's short account of his first expedition to America was published in 1625 and is included in the fourth volume of Samuel Purchas' Pilgrimes. It provides valuable material about the lives of the pre-colonial Abenaki and Wampanoag, as well as Pring's descriptions of geography, plants and animals. The explorer died in 1626 at the age of 46 and was buried in Bristol. Legacy * His tomb survives in St Stephen's Church, Bristol. =Notes=ReferencesFurther reading *Axtell, James.

Sidran began his career in music early. Having learned to play the drums from funk-jazz percussionist Clyde Stubblefield, he toured as a teenager with veteran rock star Steve Miller. Early life and education Sidran grew up in Madison, Wisconsin. His father, Ben Sidran, is a jazz musician, producer and historian. His mother is a weaver. Leo attended the University of Wisconsin, graduating in 1999 with a degree in history and integrated liberal studies. While still in high school, he developed a fascination with Spain and the Spanish language, and moved to Seville for a year in college. He relocated from Madison to Brooklyn in 2005 and has lived there since. Early music career Sidran began playing and writing music at a young age. He wrote his first song, \\"Pushing and Shoving\\", when he was six years old, and recorded a demo of the song with his father. The vocal from that demo was later used on the Sidrans' father-son children's music album El Elefante. His first instrument was the drums, and his first teacher was Clyde Stubblefield. Sidran would later produce Stubblefield's solo record The Original. As a drummer, Sidran has recorded on many of his father's records, including Nick's Bump, Don't Cry For No Hipster, and the Grammy-nominated Concert for Garcia Lorca. The Steve Miller Band recorded Sidran's songs before he had graduated from high school. Miller, a longtime friend and collaborator with his father, taught Sidran to play the guitar. Also while still in high school, Sidran began performing regularly as a jazz drummer with his father. His earliest performances included shows with bassist Richard Davis, saxophonists Frank Morgan and Richie Cole, and guitarist Phil Upchurch. Solo recordings Sidran released his first solo record, Leo and the Depleting Moral Legacy, while he was in college. The album was a collection of songs he had written mostly in high school, including two songs that had already been recorded by Steve Miller. He played many of the instruments and mixed the record; Paul Peterson, Ricky Peterson, and Steve Marker also contributed. After returning from Spain, Sidran recorded two bilingual solo albums. In 1998 he recorded L. Sid in Minneapolis with a studio band including Anthony Cox, Gordy Knudtson and Bob Malach. In 2003 he released Bohemia, an album recorded in Madison and Madrid, and featuring appearances by Spanish artists including Jorge Drexler, Ana Laan, and Tino di Geraldo, and American collaborators including Freedy Johnston, Holly Brook, and Howard Levy. Sidran's fourth solo record, Mucho Leo, was scheduled for release in October 2014. Productions During the process of recording Bohemia, Sidran became friendly with Jorge Drexler and Ana Laan, and would eventually go on to produce and perform regularly with both. He co-produced Laan's Oregano and Chocolate and Roses' albums, as well as Drexler's Oscar-winning song, \\"Al Otro Lado Del Rio\\". In 2003 Sidran started Nardis Records with his father. The name \\"Nardis\\" comes from a Miles Davis composition, but is also Sidran's name spelled backwards. The label was set up as a vehicle to release projects by both father and son, and both have released their recent solo projects as well as other artist productions on the label. A chance encounter at a jam session in Madison with singer-songwriter Joy Dragland would ultimately lead to the creation of Joy and the Boy; primarily a studio project, the duo released three albums. Their cover of Marvin Gaye's \\"Let's Get It On\\" debuted in the Top 40 pop radio charts in Spain. After moving to New York in 2005, Sidran developed his career as a composer for film and television commercials. He has scored over 100 national television commercials, and six feature-length documentaries including At The Death House Door and No Crossover: The Trial of Allen Iverson, directed by Steve James. The Third Story In 2014 Leo Sidran started a podcast called The Third Story, in which he interviews musicians, artists, and writers. His first guest was Will Lee, and subsequent interviews included scientist Daniel Levitin, pianist Jon Batiste, singer Madeleine Peyroux, arranger/producer Rob Mounsey and record producer Tommy LiPuma.

Biography Joi is the daughter of NFL Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Joe Gilliam and granddaughter of Tennessee State Tigers football coach Joe Gilliam, Sr. Music careerThe Pendulum Vibe (1994)= In 1994, Joi released her debut album, The Pendulum Vibe, on EMI with Dallas Austin as the executive producer. While the lead single \\"Sunshine & the Rain\\" received heavy airplay on video outlets such as VH1 and MTV, the single failed to become a hit and album sales were disappointing, selling only 76,000 copies in the U.S. Even though album sales were low, Joi received widespread praise from critics, some calling her the new \\"Madonna\\". Madonna herself was so impressed with Pendulum Vibe that she changed the direction of her 1994 album Bedtime Stories. Madonna was also responsible for assisting Joi in becoming the first black model in a major Calvin Klein print ad campaign. While Joi was receiving heavy media attention she released two more singles: \\"I Found My Niche\\" and \\"Freedom\\". During this time, Joi's personal and musical style was the first to be dubbed as \\"neo soul\\". The track \\"Freedom\\" from Pendulum Vibe was later used for the Mario Van Peebles film Panther in a re-record featuring Aaliyah, Mary J. Blige, En Vogue, Me'shell Ndegeocello, TLC, Queen Latifah, Vanessa Williams, SWV, Brownstone and many more. =Amoeba Cleansing Syndrome (1997)= In 1997, Joi prepared for the release of her second album, Amoeba Cleansing Syndrome on Dallas Austin's FreeWorld label. Joi and creative partner Austin brought in the assistance of Fishbone to be her backing band. The song \\"I Believe\\" was originally picked to be the first single, a video, which featured a then pregnant Joi was shot, but weeks before its release EMI wanted more \\"Radio Friendly\\" tracks for the album, and the video's release was canceled and the album's release was put on hold. Before returning to the studio, Joi gave birth to a healthy baby girl Keypsiia \\"Blue-Daydreamer\\" Gipp and took a short hiatus. After almost a year delay, Joi returned with a new single \\"Ghetto Superstar\\" which featured her then husband rapper Big Gipp, the song, written for her father Joe Gilliam, coined the term \\"Ghetto Superstar\\". A video was shot and released, it featured both Big Gipp and their 1-year-old daughter Keypsiia. Yet, despite its MTV buzz status, when her label Rowdy/EMI folded, so did the release of the album. Even though the album never saw the light of day commercially, months after its cancellation, the album began circulating due to heavy boot-legging, several media outlets were able to obtain copies of the album, giving the project 4 to 5 Star Reviews, calling it \\"Ahead of its time\\". But in spite of the positive feedback received for the album, Joi was disappointed about its cancellation and decided to take a hiatus to take care of her family. =Lucy Pearl (2000)= In 2000, Joi joined Raphael Saadiq's group, Lucy Pearl, replacing Dawn Robinson (of En Vogue). the group made their first public appearance with Joi on January 25, 2001 on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno performing \\"You\\" which was also featured on the Save the Last Dance soundtrack. Even though Joi performed and shot two videos with the group, they never released a follow-up studio album together and the group later disbanded. =Star Kitty's Revenge (2002)= In 2002. Joi released her third album Star Kitty's Revenge, on Universal Records. The lead single \\"Missing You\\" was produced by Dallas Austin with whom she had not worked since doing background vocals on TLC's \\"Silly Ho\\". While the first single failed to become a hit, the second single \\"Lick\\" which featured fellow Dungeon Family member Sleepy Brown was included in the film XXX received a large amount of attention from Andrew Soeder courtesy of the film's soundtrack, with no video and little airplay from radio stations across the country, sales for the single soared becoming Joi's most successful single to date, the song would later be sampled by fellow ATL recording artist Gucci Mane on his 2007 hit \\"Freaky Gurl\\". The following year, she was released from Universal after the sales of Star Kitty's Revenge failed to impress label executives. In spite of the widespread attention received from \\"Lick,\\" the album sold only 101,217 copies in the U.S. according to Nielsen SoundScan. =Tennessee Slim Is The Bomb (2006)= After leaving Universal, she signed with Raphael Saadiq's Pookie Entertainment label preparing for the release of her fourth album, but due to distribution issues with the boutique label, the album's release was canceled. To avoid having another project shelved, Joi decided to release the project independently. In late 2004, Joi developed her own independent label \\"Joilicious Records\\" and put finishing touches to her album. The album was set to be released in 2005, but was eventually released on March 28, 2006 as her fourth album under the title Tennessee Slim Is the Bomb. The first single, \\"I'm So Famous\\", was released commercially in late 2006. In spite of moderate airplay from commercial radio, the single received widespread popularity courtesy of online, satellite, and college radio stations across the globe; by late 2006 sales increased dramatically, making physical copies of the album scarce and raising digital sales. A second single \\"Dance With Yesterday\\" was also released. =Collaborations= Throughout the years, as a member of Atlanta's famous Dungeon Family, Joi has been featured on tracks by many different artists such as Outkast, Goodie Mob, TLC, Robbie Williams, Big Tymers, George Clinton, Curtis Mayfield, Queen Latifah, Too Short, Fishbone, Jim Crow, Shaquille O'Neal, Joss Stone, Run The Jewels and the D.O.C..

Along with Henry M. Morris, he wrote The Genesis Flood, which influenced many conservative American Christians to adopt flood geology. Biography Whitcomb was born in Washington, D.C., the son of Salome Josephine (Fuller) and John Clement Whitcomb, an army officer. He lived in northern China between the ages of 3 and 6, and later attended The McCallie School in Chattanooga, Tennessee.Dr. Whitcomb's Biosketch, WhitcombMinistries.org. Accessed 2012-01-23. His education at Princeton University was interrupted in 1943 when he was drafted into the United States Army and served in Europe during World War II. While at Princeton, he converted to evangelical Christianity through the ministry of Donald B. Fullerton and the Princeton Christian Fellowship. He studied historical geology and paleontology for a year and graduated in 1948 with honors in ancient and European history. Thereafter he enrolled at Grace Theological Seminary in Winona Lake, Indiana, where he earned a B.D. degree in 1951, and remained at the seminary, teaching Old Testament and Hebrew, along with Young Earth Creationism. In 1953, the American Scientific Affiliation (ASA) held its annual conference at Grace. Whitcomb was especially impressed by Dr. Henry M. Morris' presentation defending Flood geology against day-age, ruin-restoration and pictorial-day views. The two found that they shared a belief in a literal six-day creation and a global Flood. Bernard Ramm's book The Christian View of Science and Scripture, which was published in 1954 and led to ASA rejection of Flood geology, impelled Whitcomb to devote his doctoral dissertation to rebutting Ramm and defending a literal interpretation of Genesis 6–9. Whitcomb polled Old Testament, archeology and apologetics scholars at evangelical schools, but although he found a wide range of viewpoints, he found little support for Flood geology. Whitcomb completed his dissertation on 'The Genesis Flood' in 1957 and successfully defended it at Grace Theological Seminary.Numbers (2006) p. 212–217 Whitcomb set about preparing his dissertation for publication, and sought somebody with a PhD in science to check or write the chapters on the scientific aspects of the Flood, but found himself unable to find any \\"Ph.D.s in geology today who take Genesis 6–9 seriously.\\" His work was viewed with disfavour even by Douglas A. Block, reputedly the only scientist at Wheaton College who held to the idea of a global Flood, who stated: Whitcomb accepted this criticism, being already aware that his inability to deal effectively with objections raised to Flood geology by ASA scientists was his \\"greatest weakness\\". He agreed to put off publication of the book to allow Morris to co-author chapters on scientific issues (including radioactivity, stratification and uniformitarianism). The Genesis Flood, published by Whitcomb and Morris in 1961, \\"became a best-seller in the Fundamentalist world and polarized Evangelical opinion\\", though it was ignored by all university scientists and liberal Christians.Arthur McCalla, The Creationist Debate: The Encounter Between the Bible and the Historical Mind (London: Continuum International, 2006), 172. It was followed by the launch of the Creation Research Society in 1963 and of Morris' Institute for Creation Research in 1972. Ken Ham, the founder of Answers in Genesis and the Creation Museum near Cincinnati, credited The Genesis Flood for \\"really launch[ing] the modern creationist movement around the world.\\" Henry Morris obituary, Baptist Press News Whitcomb taught at Grace Theological Seminary's Old Testament and Christian Theology departments from 1951 to 1990. He was dismissed amid several theological controversies. Whitcomb attributes his dismissal to Dave Plaster prohibiting him attending a meeting of Conservative Grace Brethren Association (of which Whitcomb was a member) in Orrville, Ohio, in January 1990. Whitcomb went, and upon his return was fired. He had shared concerns about theological drifts within the Seminary, especially in regards to Genesis 1).Personal interview with Dr. John C. Whitcomb in Indianapolis, IN on April 18, 2013 by Dr. Daniel J. Pritchett In 1992, he was part of a split from the Fellowship of Grace Brethren Churches, the denominational home both of himself and Grace Seminary, forming the Conservative Grace Brethren Churches, International. This occurred after the Conservative Grace Brethren Association (CGBA) had been denied a request to be a recognized as a Cooperating Agency with the FGBC at National Conference. Whitcomb held no official title within the organization. Whitcomb and his wife Norma resided in Indianapolis. He served as President Emeritus of Whitcomb Ministries, Inc., and as a speaker for Answers in Genesis. Whitcomb died at his home on February 5, 2020.

He is known particularly for his impassioned opposition to apartheid, and for his advocacy on behalf of Haitian immigrants and Haitian president Jean-Bertrand Aristide.Randall Robinson website. Early life and education Robinson was born in Richmond, Virginia to Maxie Cleveland Robinson and Doris Robinson Griffin, both teachers. The late ABC News anchorman, Max Robinson, was his elder brother. Randall Robinson graduated from Virginia Union University, and earned a J.D. degree at Harvard Law School.African American Registry: TransAfrica founder, Randall Robinson He also has an older sister, actress Jewel Robinson, and a younger sister, Pastor Jean Robinson. Both sisters live and work in the Washington, D.C. area. He and his former wife had a daughter, Anike Robinson, and a son, Jabari Robinson. He is married to Hazel Ross-Robinson and they have one daughter, Khalea Ross Robinson. Career Robinson was a civil rights attorney in Boston (1971–75) before he worked for U.S. Congressman Bill Clay (1975) and as administrative assistant to Congressman Charles Diggs (1976). He was a Ford fellow. Robinson founded the TransAfrica Forum in 1977, which- according to its mission statement-serves as a \\"major research, educational and organizing institution for the African-American community, offering constructive analysis concerning U.S. policy as it affects Africa and the African Diaspora (African-Americans and West Indians who can trace their heritage back to the dispersion of Africans that occurred as a result of the Transatlantic slave trade) in the Caribbean and Latin America.\\"TransAfrica Forum Mission He served in the capacity as TransAfrica's president until 2001.Randall Robinson Interview During that period he gained visibility for his political activism, organizing sit-ins at the South African embassy in order to protest the Afrikaner government's racial policy of discrimination against black South Africans, a personal hunger strike aimed at pressuring the United States government into restoring Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power after the short-lived coup by General Raoul Cédras, and dumping crates filled with bananas onto the steps of the United States Trade Representative in order to protest what he views as discriminatory trade policies aimed at Caribbean nations, such as protective tariffs and import quotas. In 2001, he authored a book \\"The Debt: What America Owes To Blacks\\", which presented an in-depth outline regarding his belief that wide-scale reparations should be offered to African-Americans as a means of redressing centuries of de jure and de facto discrimination and oppression directed at the group. The book argues for the enactment of race-based reparation programs as restitution for the continued social and economic issues in the African-American community, such as a high proportion of incarcerated black citizens and the differential in cumulative wealth between white and black Americans.Randall Robinson, Author of An Unbroken Agony: Haiti, from Revolution to the Kidnapping of a President Although some reviewers praised Robinson for delving into a controversial topic that had not been addressed in the mainstream media, others criticized him for reverse racism, and asserted that his own personal success contradicted the dire portrait he portrayed of the conditions faced by African-Americans living in the United States. In 2003 Robinson turned down an honorary degree from Georgetown University Law Center. Robinson began teaching at The Pennsylvania State University — Dickinson School of Law in the fall of 2008. Exile In 2001, Robinson quit his position as head of TransAfrica and decided to emigrate to St. Kitts - where his wife, who is a member of a prominent Kittitian family, was born - a decision chronicled in his book, \\"Quitting America: The Departure of a Black Man from his Native Land.\\" Robinson's self-imposed exile was caused by what he describes as his antipathy towards America's domestic policies and foreign policy, both of which he believes exploit minorities and the poor.  Post exile work  Robinson is currently serving as Distinguished Scholar in Residence at the Pennsylvania State University Dickinson School of Law.

He was the brother of King Sancho I Garcés and son of García Jiménez by his second wife, Dadildis of Pallars. When his brother died, Sancho's only son, García Sánchez, was still a child and Jimeno succeeded his brother, becoming the second ruler of the Jiménez dynasty. By 928 at the latest Jimeno's nephew García was \\"formally associated ... as joint ruler\\". A document in the archives of the monastery of San Juan de la Peña confirming a boundary settlement reached under King Fortún Garcés was issued when \\"[the aforementioned King] Jimeno Garcés was ruling with his ward the Lord García in Pamplona and in [Deyo].\\" In 927, Jimeno took an army south to support Muhammad ibn Lubb ibn Muhammad of the Banu Qasi against the Córdoba-allied Banu Tujib, and Jimeno's presence there forced Abd-ar-Rahman III, Emir of Córdoba to retreat without offering battle. On his death in 932 or 933 his nephew, now García Sánchez I of Pamplona, ruled alone under the tutelage of his mother Toda, who was doubly Jimeno's sister-in-law. Jimeno married Sancha Aznárez, daughter of Aznar Sánchez of Larraun and granddaughter of king Fortún Garcés, and thus a sister of Sancho's queen, Toda Aznárez. As such, she was a close kinswoman of Abd-ar-Rahman III. Sancha and Jimeno had three children: García, who went with his mother to Gascony; Sancho, who married Quissilo, daughter of García, count in Bailo; and Dadildis, wife of Muza Aznar, son of the wali of Huesca, al-Tawil, and grandson of Aznar Galíndez II of Aragon.

The film stars Barbara Steele and Robert Flemyng. Plot The story is set in 1885 and concerns Dr. Bernard Hichcock (Robert Flemyng), a necrophiliac whose \\"horrible secret\\" of the title involves drugging his wife, Margaretha (Maria Teresa Vianello), for sexual funeral games. One day he accidentally administers an overdose of a new drug which slows the heartrate and thinks he has killed her. After burying her in a crypt, he leaves London. 12 years later, he remarries and returns to his old home. His new wife, Cynthia (Barbara Steele), starts to believe that she is seeing Margaretha around the house. After Cynthia falls victim to Dr. Hichcock's old parlour games, she suspects that he is trying to kill her, but she finds out that the truth is much worse. Having realised that Margaretha is still alive, but looking haggard from her ordeal, Dr. Hichcock plans to kill Cynthia and use her blood to restore Margaretha's beauty. Cast * Barbara Steele as Cynthia Hichcock * Robert Flemyng as Dr. Bernard Hichcock * Silvano Tranquilli (credited as Montgomery Glenn) as Dr. Kurt Lowe * Maria Teresa Vianello (credited as Teresa Fitzgerald) as Margaretha Hichcock * Harriet Medin (credited as Harriet White) as Martha - The Housekeeper * Spencer Williams * Al Christianson * Evar Simpson (credited as Evar Simpsom) * Nat Harley * Neil Robinson (uncredited) as Hospital Assistant * Howard Nelson Rubien (uncredited) as Laboratory Specialist Production Unlike director Riccardo Freda's previous Gothic-styled film I vampiri, The Horrible Dr. Hichcock was made in a climate where there were more Gothic horror films being produced in Italy. The film began when Luigi Carpentieri phoned screenwriter Ernesto Gastaldi to write a giallo story that he liked, titled Spectral. Gastaldi wrote his own treatment under the title Raptus. The original script did not contain the necrophilia that is in the film, which Gastaldi commented that he did not remember why he added it, suggesting that \\"perhaps one of the associates asked for something harder, more macabre\\". Freda later claimed that the story was his idea, proclaiming that \\"It is entirely my idea. I nurtured it for a long time but it is Ernesto Gastaldi, a very good scenarist, who shaped it into form.\\" Gastaldi commented on this, saying that when he met Freda, they did not discuss the film with him and that producer Ermanno Donati gave Freda the script, saying \\"Let's see if you have the balls to shoot this stuff, it's about corpses!\\" Gastaldi stated that Freda did not even read the script and replied \\"As long as I get paid, I'm shooting even the phone book.\\" The film's co-star Barbara Steele took 10 days off the set of Federico Fellini's 8½ to perform her role in the film. Co-star Robert Flemyng, who was predominantly working in television at the time, took the script, as he wanted to go to Rome. After reading the script, titled Raptus, he only later found the film involved necrophilia and attempted to get out of the film. His agent stated it was too late, as he had signed the contract, so he went forward with making the film. The actress Harriet Medin had been working in Italy since the end of World War II. She received a call from Flemyng before shooting, suggesting that they act so badly that the film would not be released. She is listed in the film credits under her maiden name, Harriet White. The Italian cast and crew hid their names under British-sounding names; this included Freda being credited as Robert Hampton, while set designer Franco Fumagalli became Frank Smokecocks, a literal translation of his last name. Each cast member spoke his or her own language when filming. The film was shot at Villa Perucchetti in Via Pietro Paolo Rubens 21 in Rome. There are different recollections as to how long the film took to make; the schedule was from April 9 to May 5, 1962 with a 96 million lire budget. Freda stated the film was finished in two weeks, while film historians Alan Upchurch and Tim Lucas state that it was shot in 14 days. Marcello Avallone, who worked on the film with Gastaldi, stated that it took three weeks. Steele recalled that production had long 18-hour days \\"thanks to the massive doses of Sambuca and coffee. If a dolly collapsed, Freda would just pull the camera on a carpet. Nothing would stop that man.\\" To film everything, Freda sped up proceedings by having three small crews work on the film at once. One of the crews was entrusted to Avallone, who Freda had bonded over through their mutual love of horse racing. Avallone stated that he shot things like close-ups and cutaways to save time. Avallone mentioned that two versions of some sequences were shot: the original Italian, which was more suggestive and chaste, and another for foreign markets that was more risque, as Freda did not want to shoot the more explicit scenes. As of 2017, those versions have not been found. The assistant cameraman, Giuseppe Maccari, played down the second units, stating that multiple cameras were used only on some scenes, such as the climax with the fire in Hichock's villa. The film's make-up artist, Euclide Santoli, recalled the grotesque scenes where Hichcock's face swells and deforms right before the camera. To do the effect, Santoli used a double mask, with the first being thick and identical to the actor's face; it would be applied first, then a second mask that was thin was stuck to the other along the edges with tubes used to blow air through them. Freda later stated that the producers ruined the scenes with this special effect. Freda stated the producers had them split the nightmare scene into several pieces, instead of having it done as one long take. Release The Horrible Dr. Hichcock was submitted to the board of censors in June 1962 where it was given the V.M.18 rating, becoming the first horror film to receive this rating after the new rating system was made in April 1962. Despite the directors' and other sources' claims, the board of censors did not demand that there be any cuts to the film. It was released in Italy on June 30, 1962 and was distributed by Warner Bros. The film grossed a total of 142 million Italian lira on its theatrical run. Box office returns in Italy were considered strong enough that, when Ricardo Blasco's Spanish film Autopsy of a Criminal (1963) was released in Italy, it was promoted as a follow-up, titled L'assassino del dott. Hitchkok. The film was initially retitled Raptus: The Secret of Dr. Hichcock and offered to American International Pictures by Donati and Carpentieri. The company turned it down, as they could not have it toned down for general audiences in the United States. It was released in October 1964 in the United States, where it was distributed by Sigma III Corporation. The American version was cut to 76 minutes, which re-arranged scenes, added dissolves and was not always faithful to Gastaldi's original script. British audiences saw it the next year, where it was retitled The Terror of Dr. Hichcock. In 2015, a novelization of the film by Michael R. Hudson was published in the United States by Raven Head Press as part of a series of adaptations of several of Gastaldi's scripts, including My Name is Nobody and The Case of the Bloody Iris. Reception From a contemporary review, The New York Times reviewed both The Horrible Dr. Hichcock and The Awful Dr. Orloff and stated \\"For once, the adjectives in the titles were not only descriptive but also accurate.\\" In France, Positif described the film as to \\"seem a hymn to necrophilia [...] the storms, the excesses, the veneer of a modern chirurgical décor to cover a stylised rococo background, even the photography dominated by fascinating and artificial flashes of color\\". The Monthly Film Bulletin declared the film \\"consistently gripping and enjoyable\\", despite numerous borrowing from numerous sources, including Vampyr, Jane Eyre, Rebecca and Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde; the \\"guiding hands of director Riccardo Freda and cameraman Raffaelle Masciocchi are unmistakable\\" noting the use of colour, light, editing and \\"visually striking compositions.\\" Glenn Erickson wrote an essay called \\"The Horrible Dr. Hichcock: Women on the Verge of a Gothic Breakdown\\" and stated \\"The outrageous central concern of The Horrible Dr. Hichcock has never been considered appropriate for any film openly advertised and exhibited to the public, horror or otherwise. That a film about the frustrated passions of a necrophiliac could even be released in 1962 is a censorial mystery in its own right -- or, perhaps, a clear testament to the way horror films were officially ignored on every cultural level back then.\\"Erickson, Glenn. The Horrible Dr. Hichcock: Women on the Verge of a Gothic Breakdown, dvdtalk.com Meanwhile, the film has been praised as \\"a unique Italian gothic\\" with authentic sets, particularly artful acting by Flemyng and Barbara Steele at her best.

Typical of his style are experimental, noisy breaks in his songs and strong gothic (in the sense of dark and gloomy) elements in the lyrics as well as in the music. There is also a strong undercurrent of black humor and the absurd in his work. Although his early albums were most celebrated in the alternative country community, he has never quite fit into any particular genre. As a singer-songwriter, his music is most often compared to that of Tom Waits, Nick Cave and Captain Beefheart. Early life Born in Fort Worth, Texas in 1948, Dowd's family moved to Memphis, Tennessee in 1950, and then to his father's hometown of Pauls Valley, Oklahoma in 1953. He received a record player for Christmas in 1956 and began buying records at a local appliance store. Although the first LP he owned was by the Ray Conniff Singers, it was the music of Hank Williams, Elvis Presley, Ray Charles and James Brown, that changed his life. He cites James Brown's Live at the Apollo as his lifelong favorite album. In 1965, along with his mother and sisters, Johnny returned to Memphis after his parents' divorce. After serving in the U.S. Army and living in California he drove across the United States in the early 1970s with longtime friend Dave Hinkle and settled permanently in Ithaca, New York where his mother and sisters had also relocated. Dowd and Hinkle began moving furniture for a living, later naming their business the Zolar Moving Company. Band history Dowd formed a band in the 1970s named The Jokers, which included Johnny (guitar), his sister Jennifer Edmondson (drums) and Dave Hinkle (bass). By 1988, the band had become Neon Baptist, who in addition to Dowd included Cally Arthur, Dave Hinkle, Mike Edmondson and Jennifer Edmondson, with Max Ormond and Kim Sherwood-Caso joining the band in later lineups. Neon Baptist was one of the founding acts of the GrassRoots Festival, where Dowd has performed annually since 1991. By the time Neon Baptist disbanded in 1995, Dowd was recording songs alone in the office of his moving company. These songs first appeared in 1995 on a home-made demo cassette as Wrong Side of Memphis, which credited Dowd as a solo artist and featured Kim Sherwood-Caso on background vocals on two songs. Most of these tracks were either re-mixed or completely re-recorded for the CD version of the same album, which was initially pressed as a self- released CD and then officially released on Chicago's Checkered Past label in 1997. The album was also released on Koch Records in early 1998 and then in Europe on Munich Records. Favorable reviews led to some of his first European appearances in 1998. In the wake of the critical acclaim for Wrong Side of Memphis, Dowd released his second album, Pictures From Life's Other Side, in 1999, also to positive reviews. That year also saw the first of Dowd's US and European tours. After the self-released, experimental Down In The Valley in 2000 came Temporary Shelter. A Dutch TV documentary on Dowd was filmed in 2000, and in early 2001, the New York Times highlighted him as one of four \\"Country Singers Who Still Display a Country Heart\\". Dowd's The Pawnbroker's Wife album was released in 2002, followed by Wire Flowers: More Songs from the Wrong Side of Memphis in 2003. That same year, he was handpicked by The Simpsons' creator Matt Groening, a self-described fan of Dowd's music, to perform in the All Tomorrow's Parties festival. He also made his major film appearance in 2003 with Searching for the Wrong-Eyed Jesus. The album Cemetery Shoes was released in 2004. Cruel Words, released in 2006, went on to win the Alt Country award in the 7th Annual Independent Music Awards the following year. In 2006, Dowd, drummer Brian Wilson (aka Willie B) and Jim White formed the band Hellwood. Their album, Chainsaw of Life, was recorded in a cabin in New York, the walls of which were covered in musician obituaries. Hellwood toured the album in Europe. In April 2007, Dowd joined Beukorkest, a collaboration of various Dutch musicians and artists, for a nine-show tour of the Netherlands. In 2008, after an album of tracks from the tour was released, Beukorkest re-formed with a new team of musicians. Dowd released A Drunkard's Masterpiece in early 2008 in the U.S., Canada and Europe, followed by a European tour in April and May. In October, he formed the trio Black Elastic with former band mates Kim Sherwood-Caso on guitar and vocals and Mike Edmondson on guitar. After several shows in the Ithaca, New York area, an expanded Johnny Dowd band was formed, composed of Sherwood-Caso, Mike Stark (keyboards), Matt Saccuccimorano (drums) and Willie B (baritone guitar). The group released its debut album Wake Up the Snakes in 2010. Willie B plays drums and bass pedals on Dowd's Do the Gargon released in 2013. Dowd's solo- album That's your wife on the back of my horse was released in 2015 and featured on several tracks the singer/songwriter Anna Coogan from Ithaca. She is also a guest vocalist on Dowd's next album, 2016's Execute American Folklore. The album contains fourteen self-written tracks. All instruments on this album are played by Dowd and it showcases his ability to create an electronic sound.https://www.herecomestheflood.com/2018/01/johnny-dowd- twinkle-twinkle.html On June 5, 2018 Dowd announced on his website that he is working on yet another new album, after the release of \\"Twinkle Twinkle\\" in January of the same year. According to Dowd the record sounds like 'a grungy garage rock thing, circa 1965'. Kim Sherwood-Caso will, again, provide vocals on the album. On August 14, 2018 he wrote on his website that the new album will be released on March 1, 2019, titled \\"Family Picnic\\".http://www.johnnydowd.com/news/ \\"Twinkle Twinkle\\" contains jazz and blues covers as well as new versions of traditionals.

Intended to portray the time period of the Vietnam War, the title character was loosely based on Diana Oughton of the Weather Underground, who died in the 1970 Greenwich Village townhouse explosion when a bomb she was building accidentally exploded. Reviewers have also noted that Katherine also \\"borrowed from the then-current headlines involving Patty Hearst, another heiress whose exact level of voluntary involvement with the Symbionese Liberation Army remained hazy in 1975. Through a series of flashbacks, the film, told in semi-documentary fashion, retraces the main characters' lives through the years 1964-1972. Production and cast notes Katherine was originally telecast in a two-hour time slot on October 5, 1975 and was later syndicated in a 78-minute version. Art Carney, who plays Katherine's father, Thornton Allman, in the film, won an Oscar this same year for the film Harry and Tonto. Julie Kavner, who plays Katherine's college roommate, Margot Weiss Goldman, in the film, was at the time of this film also playing Rhoda Morgenstern's kid sister Brenda on the TV show Rhoda and would later find fame as a voice actor on The Simpsons.

Lakshmi is believed to be residing in Chottanikkara along with the supreme deity lord Maha Vishnu. The temple is located at Chottanikkara, a southern suburb of the city of Kochi in the state of Kerala, India and is one of the most popular temples in the state. In terms of temple architecture, Chottanikkara temple stands out to be an ultimate testimonial for the ancient vishwakarma sthapathis (wooden sculpture) along with Sabarimala temple. Sree Mahamaya Bhagavati (Adi Parashakti), the goddess of saraswati, Lakshmi and Parvati is one of the most popular deities in Kerala and the supreme mother goddess in Hinduism. Chottanikkara Devi (Melekavu Bhagavathi) is worshipped at the temple, in three different forms: as Mahasaraswati in the morning, draped in white; Mahalakshmi at noon, draped in crimson; and as Mahakali in the evening, decked in blue. Goddess 'Keezhkkaavu bhagavathi' is believed to be Bhadrakali, in her fierce form or Ugra form. Bhadrakali, is a form of mother Kali, supposed to be born from the third eye of lord Shiva, to kill the demon king Darika. People suffering from mental illnesses and commonly visit the temple, as Chottanikkara devi is said to cure her devotees. Guruthi pooja is a ritual done at late evening to invoke goddess Mahakali. Earlier 'Guruthi Pooja' was done only on Fridays. But nowadays, it is performed every day. Legend The area in which the temple is situated was once a dense jungle that is to said to be infested by yakshis and raktharakshas. A tribesman named Kannappan used to live in this forest. He was a devout worshipper of Kali, and would ritually sacrifice a cow to her every Friday (the day of the Goddess). One day, he found a beautiful black calf near the forest. He kidnapped the calf and took her to his altar. Just before he sacrificed the calf, tribesman's daughter Manimanga stepped in and pleaded to him to stop the sacrifice. The man loved his daughter and thus let her keep the calf as a pet. Unfortunately, Manimanga died some days later, possibly due to a snake bite. Kannappan broke into tears and decided to cremate her body. To his surprise, his daughter's corpse disappeared. A nearby priest told him the reason for such an occurrence; Kannappan used to forcibly take young calves from their mothers and sacrificed them. As punishment, he met the same fate when his daughter died. However, when the tribes man looked for the calf, he found two divine stones in its place. The priest again tells him that the stones were actually divine and that they represented the divine couple, Vishnu and Lakshmi, and to pray before these stones everyday and he would be forgiven for what he had done in the past. Since Kannappan's death, the stones were forgotten. One day, a grass-cutter came to the forest to cut some wild grass. Since her knife was blunt, she sharpened it on what she thought was a big stone. Only it was a stone, but then it started bleeding. Horrified at what she saw, she brought the matter to the public's attention. A nearby priest was called to solve the problem. After devaprasnam, it was concluded that the stones were divine. Another legend associated to the temple was that of the spiritual leader Shankaracharya. During the time where he lived, Adi Shankara realised that there wasn't a single temple in Kerala that signified the worship of goddess Lakshmi. As a result, he himself went to the Kodachadri hills in Karnataka and meditated for many days for the goddess to appear before him. His meditation bore fruit and before him stood the stunningly beautiful goddess, clad in red. On enquiry, he said that he would like to bring the goddess to Kerala and establish a temple dedicated to her worship. This way the people from Kerala would not have to go such far off distances to worship her, as in the case for those who were old and aged. After a lot of persuasion, the goddess agreed; she would follow him by foot wherever he went, but only on one condition. If he trusts her, then he was not allowed to look back to see if she followed him or not. If he did, then wouldn't go any further. He agrees and they proceed walking. They were walking down the Kodachadri hills, with Shankara leading the way and goddess' anklets tinkling and letting him know that she was with him. After walking some distance, the tinkling stopped all of a sudden. Shankara waited a few moments and stole a quick look backwards to find the goddess still with him, watching him with reproach. In keeping with the condition, the goddess stopped right there. This is the spot which would turn out to be the Mookambika temple. Shankara, however, was not one to give up. He apologized profusely for breaking the condition and repeatedly begged and pleaded with the goddess to go with him to Kerala. After many pleas, the goddess agrees to a compromise and came to Chottanikara in Kerala, where the Chottanikara temple stood. From early hours of morning, goddess would come and appear before the devotees at the Chottanikkara temple. Then in the afternoon, she would return to the Mookambika temple (spot where she stopped). Since then, the sanctum doors of the Chottanikkara temple were opened during early morning hours in honour of worshipping goddess Saraswati before the doors of the main sanctum in Mookambika temple were opened. =Legend behind Keezhkavu= The idol at Keezhkavu didn't come until after the temple was built. One night, a Brahmin was walking along a moonlit trail. Suddenly, he saw a beautiful woman, standing all alone. He offered to escort her home, and she agreed. On the way, he had to stop by a priest's house to whom he had to return a holy manuscript. Reluctantly, the woman agreed to wait for him outside the house. But when the priest enquired the Brahmin as to who had accompanied him at such odd hours of night, he tells the priest that a woman followed him. Sensing danger, the priest warns him that the woman could be a Yakshi. The helpless Brahmin asks the priest for help, to which the priest gives some holy stones and says that whenever he felt that the woman was near him, he had to throw the stone at the woman without turning back. This would slow her down and further increase the distance from him. Using these stones the Brahmin had to reach the chottanikkara temple lest the yakshi would not harm him. The Brahmin does so accordingly, but as he reached the steps of the temple's sanctum, the woman held him down and transformed into her true form; a blood thirsty vampire. The Brahmin calls for help, to which goddess Parvati appeared and transformed into Mahakali, an aspect representing her anger. She subdues the vampire and kills her. The goddess then went to wash herself in the pond, where the Kali idol was found hundreds of years later by Vilwamangalam of Guruvayoor. Makam Thozhal Temple Pond The annual Chottanikkara Makam Thozhal is the major festival in Chottanikara temple. It is believed that it was on this day (mithuna lagna on Makam) that the Vilvumangala Swamiyar saw the goddess at the temple and the devotees worship the goddess at this time. On the Makam Thozhal day, the ritualistic bath of godess in the morning at the sacred pond Calli Onakkuttichira far on the northern side of the temple. After that the goddess is brought to the temple accompanied by Lord Sastha on the back of seven caparisoned elephants march towards the \\"Pooraparambhu\\" the traditional vantage point where they remain till 11 a.m. At the mid-day the door of Sanctum Sanctorum closes for Ucha pooja. And re-opens at 2 p.m for the \\"Makam Darsanam\\", the time at which Vilvumangala Swamiyar saw the goddess at the temple. At that time Devi who appears in her sacred full-fledged splendour and glory decked in her sacred gold ornaments, precious jewellery and innumerable garlands. This is exactly the form of vision which Villwamangalam Swamiyar was believed to have had when he faced westward after the \\"Prathishta\\" (installation) of Kizhukkavu Bhagavathy, Chottanikkara Devi appears at this moment clad in glittering clothes brilliant ornaments and fine jewellery with her four arms bearing varam, Abhayam, Shank and Chakram (Offering gift and refuge) to her ardent devotees. It is fervently believed that Darsanam at this moment will result in the fulfillment of all prayers and cherished desires. It is fervently believed that those who gain Darsanam at this crucial Mithuna Lagna, will be blessed with the fulfillment of their long standing desire and prayers. Worship practises Parvati, Lakshmi and Saraswati The presiding deity is known by various names like Rajarajeswari, Mahalakshmi, Durga, Bhagavati and Amman. Bhagavati is worshipped as Mahasaraswati in the morning, Mahalakshmi in the noon and Kali in the evening. The temple is known for curing mental illness and disorders due to evil spirits. The patients are brought to the priest, who engages with them in some conversation. He nails a part of the hair of the patient in the temple tree, indicating that evil spirit is captured in the tree and the patients are cured off their illness. Neem leaves, lime and chillies are taken home from the temple, which are believed to ward off evil spirits.

It is located at Yakubu Gowon Crescent, The Three Arms Zone, Asokoro, Abuja, FCT, Nigeria. Several names that are used for Aso Villa include: State House, The Rock and The Villa. The Aso Rock villa is the most protected presidential state house in Africa. History Buhari meets with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson at the Presidential Villa, March 2018 The beautiful palatial residence was completed in 1991, the same year the military junta of Ibrahim Babangida relocated the national capital from Lagos to Abuja. Aso Villa encompasses the 400 meter monolith Aso Rock, located within the Three Arms Zone of Abuja metropolis. In 1976 the Military Government of Murtala Mohammed took the decision to relocate the Federal Capital from Lagos by a committee under the leadership of Justice Akinola Aguda which recommended the creation of a Federal Capital Territory (FCT) in the center of the country and its proclamation to this effect was issued on February 3, 1976. Akinola Aguda House (formally named on October 1, 1983) was originally conceived as a Presidential Lodge & Guest House Complex and hosted the first ever formal Cabinet Meeting held outside Lagos, only days after Abuja hosted Nigeria's Independence Anniversary celebrations for the first time, in October 1982. President Ibrahim Babangida, who took office in 1985, commenced construction of a new Presidential residence and in 1991 the Aso Rock Presidential Villa was completed and President Babangida became the first Head of State to occupy it, in on December 12, 1991. Upon completion of the Aso Rock Presidential Villa the Aguda House became the Vice Presidential Complex, and has remained so till date — apart from the period between 1999 and 2007 when the Vice President lived in a Residence that has since been transferred to the Judiciary as Official Quarters for the Chief Justice of Nigeria. In 2010, construction of a new Vice Presidential Residence commenced. The Residence has yet to be completed the Buhari administration has said it is not a priority. Today the Presidential Complex, located in the Three Arms Zone of the Federal Capital Territory, consists of the Main Presidential Villa (Office and Residence of the President, and Offices of the Vice President and Wife of the President), the State House Conference Center, State House Annexe, and the Akinola Aguda House. The old Presidential Lodge in Marina, Lagos, was handed over to the Lagos State Government in 2017. The villa is currently under the protection of the Presidential Guard Brigade which perform ceremonial and protective duties for the president. The brigade performs public duties in a weekly changing of the guard ceremony outside the villa.

Recorded between September 1970 and January 1971, Frida was produced by her then-fiancé, Benny Andersson. Frida was her only album recorded for EMI during her contract, not counting her eponymous compilation album from 1972, before being signed to Polar and form with the Swedish pop group ABBA, a year later. The album received positive receptions from critics, both retrospectively and at the time of the album's release, but did not chart, with the exception of her non-album single from the same year, Min Egen Stad, until Frida charted in Sweden, on April 2017 with a limited edition reissue, reaching No. 28 on Sverigetopplistan's album charts. Frida has since been reissued several times by EMI and Parlophone since the original issue of the album. BackgroundRecording session= The recording session of Frida took place at EMI Studios, Stockholm, now known as X-Level Studios, on 8 September 1970 and was completed in 15 January 1971. Claes Rosendahl and Bengt Palmers both directed the conduction of the orchestra for the respective tracks for Frida. Min Egen Stad was recorded on 12 July 1971 with Andersson, Björn Ulvaeus and Agnetha Fältskog on uncredited backing vocals, and was completed 11 days later. Lyngstad's cover version of The Beatles' \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" from the recording session of Frida remained unreleased, until it was leaked by British-based YouTube channel, 'ABBAtalk' in December 2013. =Aftermath= By the time of the album's release, Lyngstad had been signed to EMI, for four years, since she won a song contest titled 'New Faces' and appeared on a Swedish television show, 'Hylands Hörna' (Hyland's Corner), in September 1967. Not long after the release of the album, in 1972, Lyngstad did not renew her contract with EMI, and was signed to Polar Music to record her first single for the independent Swedish record label, and eventually team up with Andersson, Ulvaeus, and Fältskog to form ABBA. As a result, it is the only album Lyngstad has recorded, under her contract with EMI, as she has made non-album singles between 1967 and 1972. Reception and re-release Upon its original release, Frida, as an album, did not chart, but the album received unanimously generous praise from the critics, who noted the precision and versatility of Lyngstad, as a vocalist. For example, Sweden's biggest morning paper Dagens Nyheter (Daily News) wrote: \\"Professional, sure and certain LP-debut... low key but self-sure personality with sprinkles of both temperament, humor and tenderness. And she sings in this way that you understand she's got something between her ears - she sings with others words in a very intelligent way\\". The album was also re-released the following year as she had her first No. 1 non-album single, \\"Min Egen Stad\\", in the Swedish weekly record chart, Svensktoppen on 24 October 1971, consequently adding this song as the opening track of side two of Frida. The Svensktoppen version of Frida, was given a second release in 1974 as a compilation under the name EMI:s Stjärnserie Vol. 7 (EMI's Star Series). Frida was out of print until EMI released a compilation album, Frida 1967–1972 in 1997, which includes all tracks from this album. As the reissue were met with positive receptions again, Critic Bruce Eder of AllMusic has described Lyngstad's vocals as \\"a distinctly expressive and pure instrument\\" with \\"Andersson's lean yet creative accompaniments\\", while noting that \\"one can begin to hear the attributes that would emerge on the early ABBA recordings.\\" Frida was reissued as a limited edition 180-gram vinyl, pressed between 1500 and 3000 copies in 22 April 2017, under the label, Parlophone, who currently holds the rights to Lyngstad's recordings with EMI, coinciding the tenth anniversary of Record Store Day. Frida reached No. 28 on Sverigetopplistan's album charts, a few days after the reissue of this album.

Her graphic and controversial descriptions of a poor Afrikaner family in Johannesburg in Triomf brought her to the forefront of a post-apartheid society still struggling to come to terms with all the changes in South Africa. This novel was made into an award-winning film, likewise called Triomf, in 2008, directed by Michael Raeburn. She explains that the portraying the separation of the sexes in her work is the result of being \\"outside the main arena\\" as an Afrikaner lesbian. Biography Marlene van Niekerk was born on 10 November 1954 on the farm Tygerhoek near Caledon in the Western Cape, South Africa. She attended school in Riviersonderend and Stellenbosch, where she matriculated from Hoërskool Bloemhof. She studied languages and philosophy at Stellenbosch University and obtained an MA with the thesis: \\"Die Aard en Belang van die Literêre Vormgewing in 'Also sprach Zarathustra'\\" (The Nature and Significance of Literary Shaping in Also sprach Zarathustra) in 1978. While at university, she wrote three plays for amateur theatre. In 1979 she moved to Germany to join theatres in Stuttgart and Mainz to study directing. From 1980 to 1985, she continued her study of philosophy in the Netherlands and obtained a Dutch doctorandus with a thesis on the works of Claude Lévi-Strauss and Paul Ricoeur: \\"Taal en Mythe: Een Structuralistische en Een Hermeneutische Benadering\\" (Language and Myth: A Structuralist and Hermeneutic Approach) from the University of Amsterdam. Back in South Africa, she lectured in philosophy at the University of Zululand, and later at Unisa. During the 1990s, she was a lecturer in Afrikaans and Dutch at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg.

It was produced by her then-fiancé, Benny Andersson, both members of the pop group ABBA, and was first released by Polar Music in 1975. It has since been re-released several times, most significantly in remastered form in 2005 with bonus tracks. The lead song was Frida's solo version of \\"Fernando\\" (written and produced by Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus). All lyrics are in Swedish. The album was a huge success in Sweden, and Lyngstad was awarded with a platinum disc. The album is included in the box set, Frida – 4xCD 1xDVD. Background Frida ensam was recorded in KMH Studio and mixed at Metronome Studio, Stockholm. Benny Andersson plays all the pianos and keyboards, while the rest of the musicians are very much the same team who played on ABBA's records. First recordings and preparations started in 1974 but, due to the rising popularity of ABBA, the album took over 18 months to complete and was recorded between sessions and promotion for the ABBA albums Waterloo and ABBA. =Content= Frida ensam opens with Lyngstad's Swedish solo version of \\"Fernando\\" which was not released as a single in Sweden, so that those who wanted it had to buy the album. (It was however released by Polar as a single in Norway but did not reach the charts there). The song was written so that the album would contain something unique and new. This was a song with a great hit potential (being practically a new ABBA song) and this clever decision led to the album selling 130,000 copies. The song became the most popular track on the album and it spent nine weeks at #1 on Svensktoppen (a chart of Swedish songs on Sveriges radio not based on sales). The English version became one of ABBA's biggest hits. ABBA's version, is technically a \\"cover\\" since it was released after the Swedish version. The English version, with completely different lyrics by Björn Ulvaeus, presents a vision of nostalgia for two veterans reminiscing in old age about a lost battle in which they participated. \\"I wrote all the songs as little stories. \\"Fernando\\" was about two old freedom-fighters from the war between Texas and Mexico. I was lying outside one summer night, looking at the stars and it suddenly came to me\\". This quote indicates that an English version was always foreseen as the summer referred to must be the summer of 1975. With the exception of \\"Fernando\\", all the other songs are cover versions, showing Lyngstad's and Andersson's fairly eclectic taste in music. Besides dramatic Italian ballads like \\"Anima Mia\\" and \\"Vado Via\\", the album includes Lyngstad's interpretations of 10cc's \\"The Wall Street Shuffle\\" and David Bowie's \\"Life on Mars\\", sixties hits like The Beach Boys' \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\\" and Gary Puckett & The Union Gap's \\"Young Girl\\", the country and western ballad \\"The Most Beautiful Girl\\", \\"Send in the Clowns\\" from Stephen Sondheim's musical A Little Night Music as well as the Greek folk song \\"Siko Chorepse Syrtaki\\" and \\"Som en sparv\\" (with lyrics by Swedish poet Barbro Hörberg) originally recorded by Swedish band Wasa. The album received positive reviews both in Sweden and other countries. For example, British Melody Maker wrote: \\"The album portrays Frida as a very strong and emotive singer and shows the true value of the music, that if sung properly and with enough feeling it transcends all language barriers\\". Lyrically, most of the tracks have a common theme, that of a strong and independent woman, hence the album title. The ironic lyrics of \\"Vill du låna en man\\" show a particularly emancipated Lyngstad: \\"Hi, would you like to borrow a man? He's one hell of a guy. His umbrella and slippers are included. -- You'll have to be patient though, remember that he owns you - plus the three other women he sees on the side. -- Are you ready to become the mother of someone who measures 2.02 in the buff? -- When he's had his say, that's the way it is. When he's wrong he's right anyway. -- Before you answer just make sure you can handle these children also known as men.\\" The hand-painted sleeve was deemed by one journalist to be \\"so sensual, it could make the Leaning Tower of Pisa stand to attention.\\" Reception Frida ensam was a huge success in Sweden topping the album charts for six weeks and spending a total of 38 weeks in the charts.

Status The title Chartered IT Professional is aligned with Skills Framework for the Information Age (SFIA), the UK Government backed competency framework, CITP is the benchmark of IT excellence and is terminal (final/top most) qualification in IT. Criteria and requirements for chartered status in the UK have to be approved by the Privy Council and as such the CITP designation is on par with other chartered qualifications in other fields (such as the Chartered Accountant qualification awarded by the ICAEW). CITP status is gaining increasing national and international recognition as the benchmark of excellence for IT professionals. It provides evidence of an individual’s commitment to their profession and endorsement of their experience and knowledge. Eligibility In order to qualify for this award a person normally needs to have at least 8 to 10 years professional experience in IT, with evidence of experience at a senior level (5) in the Skills Framework for the Information Age (SFIA), have passed a professional competency examination and successfully completed a skills assessment interview with two BCS assessors. A fast track scheme exists for holders of Certified Architect and Certified IT Specialist certifications from The Open Group, which exempts applicants from the initial review and interview elements of the application process. In order to maintain a certificate of current competence, demonstrable CPD must be undertaken. Designatory lettering Chartered IT Professionals are entitled to use the suffix CITP after their names. This is written after honours, decorations and university degrees and after letters denoting membership of professional engineering institutions - for example: BSc (Hons), MBCS CITP. The BCS maintains an online register of members with CITP status. Licensing Other Professional membership bodies apply to the BCS for a licence that enables them to award CITP to their eligible members. =United Kingdom= The Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET) was the first membership body licensed to award CITP, but the agreement ended on 22 February 2020. =Ireland= The Irish Computer Society is the awarding body of CITP status in Ireland.

Puppis) is a yellow dwarf star located approximately 41 light-years away in the constellation of Puppis. In 2005, the Spitzer Space Telescope discovered a narrow ring of warm debris orbiting the star. The debris ring contains substantially more dust than the Solar System's asteroid belt. In 2006, three extrasolar planets with minimum masses comparable to Neptune were confirmed in orbit around the star, located interior to the debris ring.  Distance and visibility  HD 69830 is a main sequence star of spectral type G8V. It has about 86% of the Sun's mass, 90% of its radius, 62% of its luminosity, and 89% of its iron abundance. The star's age has been estimated at about 10.6 ± 4 billion years. HD 69830 is located about 40.7 light-years from the Sun, lying in the northeastern part of the constellation of Puppis (the Poop Deck). It can be seen east of Sirius, southwest of Procyon, northeast of Delta Canis Majoris, and north of Zeta Puppis.  Planetary system  Planets = On May 17, 2006, a team of astronomers using the European Southern Observatory's (ESO) HARPS spectrograph on the 3.6-metre La Silla telescope in the Atacama desert, Chile, announced the discovery of three extrasolar planets orbiting the star. With minimum masses between 10 and 18 times that of the Earth, all three planets are presumed to be similar to the planets Neptune or Uranus. , no planet with more than half the mass of Jupiter had been detected within three astronomical units of HD 69830. The star rotates at an inclination of 13 degrees relative to Earth. It has been assumed that the planets share that inclination. However b and c are \\"hot Neptunes\\", and outside this system several are now known to be oblique relative to the stellar axis. The outermost planet discovered appears to be within the system's habitable zone, where liquid water would remain stable (more accurate data on the primary star's luminosity will be required to know for sure where the habitable zone is). HD 69830 is the first extrasolar planetary system around a Sun-like star without any known planets comparable to Jupiter or Saturn in mass. = Debris disk = In 2005, the Spitzer Space Telescope detected a debris disk in the HD 69830 system consistent with being produced by an asteroid belt twenty times more massive than that in our own system. The belt was originally thought to be located inside an orbit equivalent to that of Venus in the Solar System, which would place it between the orbits of the second and third planets. The disk contains sufficient quantities of dust that the nights on any nearby planets would be lit up by zodiacal light 1000 times brighter than that seen on Earth, easily outshining the Milky Way. Further analysis of the spectrum of the dust revealed that it is composed of highly processed material, likely derived from a disrupted C-type asteroid of at least 30 km radius which contained many small olivine- rich (rocky) and once-wet grains which would not survive at close distances to the star. Instead, it seems more likely that the asteroid belt producing the dust is located outside the orbit of the outermost planet, around 1 AU from the star. This region contains the 2:1 and 5:2 mean motion resonances with HD 69830 d.

Bardhan played a key role in the formation of the United Progressive Alliance government which was supported by the Communist Party of India. Bardhan was also among those who supported the candidature of Pratibha Patil, then Governor of Rajasthan, to the coveted post of the President of India. Personal life Bardhan married Padma, who was a teacher in Saraswati Vidyalaya Higher Secondary School, Shankar Nagar, Nagpur. They got a son Ashok and a daughter Alka Barua. Padma died in 1986.

The county board regulates Gaelic games in County Kildare and is also responsible for the inter-county teams. History The old Kildare GAA crest, showing oak trees, acorns and lily flower was replaced by the current crest in 2005. Gaelic games predate recorded sporting history in Kildare. Hurling on Lyons Hill was featured in the Book of Leinster. The Curragh of Kildare was the venue for the fairs and festivals of ancient Ireland called the Aonach Colmáin. Local references to football go back to medieval times. An English traveller, John Dundon, described a hurling match in Naas in 1699. A handball alley near Rathangan bears the date 1790, though the oldest known alley is located near Moone. A match at Timolin in February 1792, resulted in a riot that was reported in local newspapers. There is also a reference to an inter-county match between Kildare and Meath GAA in 1797 which was attended by Lord Edward Fitzgerald. Valentine Lawless, Lord of Cloncurry, describes how Wogan Browne, an 18th-century grandee, lost his Justice of the Peace status for kicking off a football match in the Clane area, also in 1797. Summer athletics meetings in Kildare predate the GAA. John Wyse Power, then editor of local newspaper The Leinster Leader, attended the foundation meeting of the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) in Thurles in 1884. In February 1885, Sallins GAA, Straffan GAA, Naas GAA and the Suncroft GAA played in the first four football matches governed under new GAA rules. A county committee was established in 1887. Kildare entered the second championships in 1888 and was represented by Clane GAA. Tommy Conneff from Clane, who went on to hold the world record for the mile, was among the first GAA athletic champions. County board structure The Kildare County Board, which meets once a month in St Conleth's Park, is the highest authority within the county. It is responsible for running all adult football competitions, the Under 21 championships, and minor leagues and championships. Every club sends one delegate. There is a separate board responsible for hurling, which is a subsidiary board to the county board. Juvenile hurling and football is administered by Bord na nÓg which runs Under 14, 15 and 16 competitions. Under 13 and younger grades are separated into a North Board and South Board. The current Kildare county board is structured as follows: Chairman: Vice-Chair: John McMahon (Naas) Full-time secretary: Kathleen O'Neill (Rathcoffey) PRO: Mary Donnelly (Round Towers) Treasurer: Martin Whyte (Kilcullen) Oifigeach Gaeilge: Peadar O Murchu (St. Laurence's) Hurling Chairman: Eddie Lawlor (Athy) FootballClubs= Kildare is very much a footballing county, with 105 teams from 45 clubs competing in the Senior and Junior Football Leagues. The highest-achieving club is Sarsfields (Newbridge) with 25 (9 as their former name Roseberry). Clane won 17 titles. Raheens won 10; Carbury, 11; Round Towers from Kildare Town, 10 (counting three won as Kildare Town and one as St Patrick's); Naas, 8; Moorefield (Newbridge), 8; Athy, 5; Kilcock, 5; Ellistown, 4 (counting 2 won as Mountrice); Johnstownbridge, 3; Caragh, 3; Monasterevin, 3; Maynooth, 2; and Allenwood, Ardclough, Ballymore, Celbridge, Curragh, Eadestown, Military College, Rathangan, Newbridge CYMS club St Conleth's (on objection) and St Laurence's won one each. Raheens and Moorefield are the only Kildare sides to win a Leinster club title (in 1981 and 2006).

All-Ireland Senior Football Championship in Jim McGuinness's first season in charge. Kildare first entered the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship in 1888, and lost to Dublin by a score of 2–7 to 0–1. Kildare made a major contribution towards the evolution of rules and tactics in Gaelic football. The county was the first to abandon the tradition of playing 21 people on each team, using 16 on each team for a period. Kildare players invented the hand pass: a polished team tactic since 1903; The toe-to-hand was pioneered by the Roseberry (now Newbridge Sarsfields) club. A team made up of players from the two strongest clubs in the county, Roseberry and Clane, played Kerry three times for the All-Ireland Championship of 1903; the matches drew the first mass interest in a field sport in the country, had an aggregate attendance of 50,000, and were regarded as the games which \\"made the GAA.\\" Kildare's four All-Ireland titles were won between 1905 and 1928: over Kerry in 1905, Galway in 1919, and Kerry again in the 1927 and 1928 finals. Kildare became the first team to win the Sam Maguire Cup in 1928. They haven't won it since. Tactics such as the hand pass were perfected by those early Kildare teams, but they also developed what became traditional catch-and-kick football. Olympic high jumper Larry Stanley was regarded as one of the greatest fielders in the history of the game, and first winner of the all-time All Star award. Despite winning a Leinster Senior Football Championship in 1956, reaching the National League final in 1958 and 1968, and winning the All-Ireland Under-21 Football Championship in 1965, Kildare footballers seemed to have difficulty maintaining their proud tradition. The county lost six Leinster finals in the twelve years between 1966 and 1978. Although the Raheens club won a Leinster Senior Club Football Championship title in 1983. In 1991, former Kerry manager Mick O'Dwyer took charge of the county football team. Kildare lost two more Leinster finals to Dublin in 1992 and 1993, as well as the National League final of 1991. When Dublin came back for a draw in 1994 and won the replay, O'Dwyer was succeeded by Dermot Earley for two years. He returned in 1997, and guided the county to victory over Laois with 13 players and a dramatic, twice replayed series of matches with Meath (which they lost) that captured the imagination of the public and steeled the side for further honors. In 1998, the Kildare team became the only team in 110 years of championship football to beat the previous three champions, Dublin, Meath and Kerry in turn only to lose to Galway in the All-Ireland final; despite leading by three points at half time. Another Leinster followed in 2000, but Galway defeated them in the semi-final. Leinster Final defeats followed in 2002 and 2003, against Dublin and a Laois side back-boned by their All-Ireland MFC winning sides of the late 1990s. In (2005), Kildare enjoyed mixed success and finished in the top six in the National Football League, but was knocked out of the championship by Sligo.http://www.rte.ie/sport In 2008 under the new management of Kieran McGeeney Kildare made a bit of unfortunate history by becoming the first team ever to lose a championship game to Wicklow in Croke Park, losing in the first round by 0–13 to 0–9. However Kildares season took a turn for the better after that by beating Cavan, Limerick and Fermanagh in the all- Ireland qualifiers to reach their first ever all-Ireland quarter-final. To date in 2009, an improved Kildare side reached the Leinster Final only to suffer a defeat to Dublin. Kildare advanced to the All-Ireland quarter-final to play then All- Ireland champions Tyrone after beating Wicklow only to be knocked out by Tyrone. 2010 saw Kildare lose to Louth in the 2nd round. However Kildare had a great run through the qualifiers beating teams like Antrim, Leitrim, Derry and Monaghan to once again reach the All-Ireland Quarter-final to face Leinster champions Meath which they got a slow start but enjoyed the 2nd half as they ran out winning 2–17 to 1–12. to reach the All-Semi-final for the first time since 2000. On 29 August 2010 Kildare faced Down for the first time ever in the championship which turned out to be a very tense game but Down ran out winners 1–16 to 1–14 after a very frantic finish. 2011 saw Kildare advance to the Leinster semi-final after defeating Meath in the Leinster quarter-final only to be defeated by Dublin. Kildare had a good run in the qualifiers beating teams like Laois, Meath & Derry to advance to the All-Ireland quarter- final to face Ulster champions Donegal which turned to be a very poor performance but the 2nd half was a real contest from both sides with the sides finishing level to drag the game into extra-time only to be defeated by a single point by Donegal. Then in 2015 Cian O'Neill became manager after being with kerry gaa backroom . In 2017 kildare reached their first leinster final in 10 years . Only losing to dublin gaa by 9 points (Dublin 2-23 Kildare 1-17) . . RTE. 30 July 2011. Hurling Kildare participated in the Christy Ring Cup at the inter-county level, reaching the final in 2007 where they were defeated by Westmeath. In recent years, the leading clubs have been Coill Dubh, Éire Óg/Corra Coill, Ardclough and Celbridge. Kildare's youngest club, Confey, became the reigning Senior Hurling Championship in 2007, winning over Coill Dubh in the final. Kildare hurlers came within minutes of reaching a Leinster senior hurling final in 1976, holding a four-point lead over eventual All Ireland finalists Wexford until the closing stages of the semi-final. That performance earned Johnny Walsh a replacement all-star award. His club, Ardclough, beat Buffer's Alley in the 1976 Leinster club championship. The county's major hurling successes were four All Ireland Senior B titles (last in 2004), an intermediate All Ireland (1969), and two junior All-Irelands (1962 and 1966). The closest they came to playing in the top division of the hurling league was when they lost a four-point lead in the last ten minutes of a Division 1B promotion play-off against Clare in 1971. Kildare beat Waterford in the league in two successive years, were tied at half-time against Tipperary in the 1971 National League Quarter-final, and lost to the same team by six points in the quarter-final of 1976. They also lost a promotion play- off against Waterford in 1974. In 2014, Kildare won the Christy Ring Cup for the first time in their history beating Kerry 4–18 to 2–22 in the final.

Athy Ladies Hurling Club advertised a members reunion in July 1909. Newbridge, Naas, Blacktrench, Prosperous and Ballymore applied unsuccessfully for affiliation to Kildare GAA board in 1921. Kildare sent delegates to the camogie congress of 1932, and a county board was formed in 1934 with Fr Byrne CC of Caragh as president, Mrs B McCarthy as vice- president, William Fisher of Newbridge as secretary, and Polly Smyth of Newbridge as treasurer. Camogie was reorganized at a county convention in 1954, and has been played in Kildare continuously since. Kildare's contested the All-Ireland Senior Camogie Championship semi-final in 1933 and contested the Leinster Senior final in 1939 (which was hosted in Kill), and 1947 at Inchicore. They last competed in the senior championship in 1992 and 1993. After a series of successes at the junior level, Kildare was defeated by Cork in the National League semi-final of 1992, despite their best performance at senior level. Kildare teams played in navy and white (1930s), brown and white (1955–60) and blue and white (sporadically since the 1960s). White was adopted as the county color in April 1963.

It is named after the necropolis of Rössen (part of Leuna, in the Saalekreis district, Saxony-Anhalt). The Rössen culture has been identified in 11 of the 16 states of Germany (it is only absent from the Northern part of the North German Plain), but also in the southeast Low Countries, northeast France, northern Switzerland and a small part of Austria. The Rössen culture is important as it marks the transition from a broad and widely distributed tradition going back to Central Europe's earliest Neolithic LBK towards the more diversified Middle and Late Neolithic situation characterised by the appearance of complexes like Michelsberg and Funnel Beaker Culture. Pottery Pottery Rössen vessels are characteristically decorated with double incisions (\\"goat's foot incision\\" or German '\\"Geißfußstich\\"') with incrustation of white paste. Grooved or stamped incisions are also common. Over time, the extent of the decorated areas appears to decrease so that on later vessels it is mostly restricted to the neck or entirely absent. Typical shapes include tall footed bowls, globular cups, rectangular sheet-made bowls and boat-shaped vessels. The surfaces of vessels are usually burnished; their colours range from brown via reddish brown and dark brown to grey-black. Stone tools The Rössen repertoire of flint tools is broadly similar to that of the Linear Pottery (LBK) tradition (blades with pyramid-shaped cores), but there is a marked change as regards the raw materials used. Dutch Rijkholt flint, which dominated the LBK tradition, is being replaced with veined 'Plattenhornstein' (Abensberg- Arnhofen type) of Bavarian origin. The most typical solid rock tool is a pierced tall cleaver, but unpierced axes and adzes are also common. Domestic architecture and settlement patterns Only a few Rössen settlements have been excavated. Prominent examples are the sites of Deiringsen-Ruploh und Schöningen/Esbeck. The predominant structure is a trapezoidal or boat-shaped long house, up to 65 m in length. The ground plans suggest a sloping roofline. Multiple internal partitions are a frequent feature, probably indicating that several smaller (family?) units inhabited a house. Lüning suggests that Rössen settlements, unlike the earlier LBK ones, are true village communities. Some settlements were surrounded by earthwork enclosures. The majority of settlements is located in areas with Chernozem soils; compared to LBK the area of settlement has decreased. Burial rites Grave The dead were mostly buried in a crouched position, lying on their right side and facing East. Graves were dug to a depth of 40 to 160 cm, occasionally they were covered with stone slabs. The exact shapes and sizes of graves are not well understood. Even less is known about possible cremation burials whose identification as belonging to Rössen is sometimes disputed. Cremated remains and pyre ashes were collected together and accompanied by unburnt grave goods. Ceramic grave offerings include pedestalled cups, globular cups, lugged cups, bowls, flasks, amphoras, jugs and basins. Limestone rings, stone axes, flint blades and animal bones also occur. Economy Mixed agriculture was practiced, and cattle, sheep, goats and pigs were kept. Origin of British/Irish Neolithic? It is suggested the late Rössen culture may be ancestral to the Neolithic cultures of Britain and Ireland (a group of cultures previously known as Windmill Hill culture), but there is no great similarity in the form of houses or pottery. According to alternative theories, the British Neolithic culture(s) came from Brittany.Culture de Windmill-Hill Kurgan hypothesis In the context of the Kurgan hypothesis, certain intrusive elements are pointed to as some of the earliest evidence for penetration by Kurgan culture-based Indo-European elements, but Mallory indicates this idea has failed to gain any real acceptance. Older, now largely discarded theories attempted to make this a very early Indo-European culture; the presently prevailing view assigns it to indigenous non-Indo-European- speaking people. Chronologically and geographically adjacent cultures Rössen followed LBK. In its western distribution, the Hinkelstein, Großgartach and Planig-Friedberg complexes intervene between LBK and Rössen. Rössen is partially contemporaneous with the Southeast Bavarian Middle Neolithic ('Südostbayerisches Mittelneolithikum' or SOB, formally also known as Oberlauterbach Group). In the North, Rössen precedes the early Funnel beaker culture of Baalberge; in the South it is followed by the so-called post-Rössen groups (Wauwil, Bischoffingen-Leiselheim/Strasbourg, Bischheim, Goldberg, Aichbühl, Gatersleben) and Lengyel (Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Austria), and the Münchshöfen Culture (Bavaria). Genetics In a 2017 genetic study published in Nature, the remains of a female ascribed to the Rössen culture was analyzed. She was found to be carrying V1a. LiteratureGeneral= *J. P.

This star has a magnitude of about 11, making it invisible to the unaided eye even though it is one of the stars nearest to the Sun. This system is among the closest to the Sun at an estimated distance of about 13.3 light years. Because this star is so close to the Earth it is often the subject of study, hence the large number of designations by which it is known. Binary star system This binary star system consists of two closely spaced low-mass red dwarfs. The secondary star is a dim magnitude 14 lost in the glare of the nearby primary star. The most recent determination of the system orbital elements comes from a study by George Gatewood using older sources along with data from the Hipparcos satellite. This study yielded an orbital period of about 16.6 years and a semi-major axis separation of about 1.1 arc seconds (2.4–5.3 AU). History The primary star was discovered in 1927 by F. E. Ross using the refractor telescope at the Yerkes Observatory. He noticed the high proper motion of this dim 11th magnitude star in his second-epoch plates that were part of an astronomical survey started by E. E. Barnard, his predecessor at the observatory. Ross then included this new star in his eponymous catalog along with many others he discovered. The first detection of a binary system was in 1936 by Dirk Reuyl using the 26-in refractor telescope of the McCormick Observatory at the University of Virginia using astrometric analysis of photographic plates. In 1951 Sarah L. Lippincott made the first reasonably accurate predictions of the position of the secondary star using the refractor telescope of the Sproul Observatory. These calculations were used by Walter Baade to find and optically resolve this binary system for the first time using the then new Hale Telescope at the Palomar Observatory in California.

The exchange of dissolved substances between the porewater and overlying seawater that results is an important process in the context of the biogeochemistry of the oceans. Coastal aquatic environments often have organisms that destabilize sediment. They change the physical state of the sediment. Thus improving the conditions for other organisms and themselves. These organisms often also cause Bioturbation, which is commonly used interchangeably or in reference with bioirrigation. Bioirrigation works as two different processes. These processes are known as particle reworking and ventilation, which is the work of benthic macro- invertebrates (usually ones that burrow). This particle reworking and ventilation is caused by the organisms when they feed (faunal feeding), defecate, burrow, and respire. Bioirrigation is responsible for a large amount of oxidative transport and has a large impact on biogeochemical cycles.  Bioirrigation's Role in Elemental Cycling  Coastal environment Bioirrigation is a main component in element cycling. Some of these elements include: Magnesium, Nitrogen, Calcium, Strontium, Molybdenum, and Uranium. Other elements are only displaced at certain steps in the bioirrigation process. Aluminium, Iron, Cobalt, Copper, Zinc, and Cerium are all affected at the start of the process, when the larvae begins to dig into the sediment. While Manganese, Nickel, Arsenic, Cadmium and Caesium were all mobilized slightly after the burrowing process.  Challenges to Studying Bioirrigation  When trying to describe this biologically driven dynamic process, scientists have not been able to develop a 3D image of the process yet.  New Mechanisms to Study Bioirrigation  4D tracing of bioirrigation in marine sediment There is a hybrid medical imaging technique using a position emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) to measure the ventilation and visualize the pore water advection that is caused by the organisms in 4D imaging.4D tracing of bioirrigation in marine sediment  Ecological Importance of Bioirrigation  When coastal ecosystems do not have bioirrigating organisms, like lugworms, it results in a lot of sedimentary problems. Some of these problems include clogging of the sediment with organic-rich fine particles and a drastic decrease in sediment permeability. It also makes it so the oxygen cannot penetrate deeply into the sediment and there is accumulation of reduced mineralized products in pore water. These problems disrupt the foundations of a coastal ecosystem.  Economic Impacts  Two organisms that contribute to the bioturbation of soil are Nephtys caeca (Fabricius) and Nereis virens (Sars) annelidae. They dig, bioirrigate, and feed in the sediment and they homogenize the particles found in the sediment when they partake in these activities because of their erratic movements. The bioirrigation generated by these organisms modifies the distribution of dinoflagellate cysts in the sedimentary column. They either bury them or raise them back to the surface, keeping them rotating. One of the most important dinoflagellates that these organisms help distribute is called noxious microalgae and it is responsible for the formation of toxic red tides. These red tides poison mollusks and crustaceans which results in very important economic losses in the fishing industry.245x245px  Case Study: Boston Harbor  The sediments of marine environments are important sites of methylmercury (MMHg) production. This production provides important sources of this MMHg to near-shore and off-shore water columns and food webs. Scientists have measured the flux in production across 4 different stations in the Boston Harbor which had different bioirrigation site densities. There is a strong linear relationship between the amount of MMHg exchange and the infaunal burrow density. In the Boston Harbor, it was shown that bioirrigation stimulates the production of methylmercury and water column flux.

He became the chief minister in the state when the AGP came to power in 1985, becoming the youngest Chief Minister of an Indian state.Mahanta takes on Congress heavyweight He served as the chief minister of the state for two terms, 1985–1990 and 1996–2001. He is a former president of the All Assam Students Union, an organization that spearheaded the Assam Movement between 1979–1985. In August 2005, his membership in the AGP was terminated. He floated a new political party, Asom Gana Parishad (Progressive) on 15 September 2005. Despite allegations of secret killings he organized against families of ULFA members, documented in the report by the Saikia Commission to the Assam Assembly, Mahanta was missed from political leadership in the state. He was reinducted into the AGP after the AGP (Progressive) was dissolved during the Presidency of Chandra Mohan Patowary, and regained a prominent position in the party. In a 2010 interview on NDTV's Walk the Talk with Shekhar Gupta, editor-in-chief of The Indian Express, Mahanta said: > \\"For the sake of the integrity and security of India, we are ready to take > any blame. If the insurgent groups attack our forces, then they (the > security forces) must have the right to respond. However, the charge against > me on extra judicial killings of the ULFA sympathisers is to malign my > image.\\" In the same interview, he said that unknown agencies of the Congress Party had conspired in massacres during the Assam Movement in the early eighties. On 4 September 2010 he was unanimously elected as the Leader of Opposition in the Assam Legislative Assembly. Aside from the current chief minister of the state, Mahanta is regarded as the most powerful and influential politician of Assam. On 21 October 2013, representatives from eleven political parties of the North-east region met to form a new political front, the North-East Regional Political Front (NERPF), to protect the interests of the region's people. Mahanta was appointed the front's chief adviser. On 14 July 2014 he resigned as president of Asom Gana Parishad after its debacle in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections.

He initially became one of the Fauve painters and a lifelong friend of Henri Matisse. Marquet subsequently painted in a more naturalistic style, primarily landscapes, but also several portraits and, between 1910 and 1914, several female nude paintings. Life and work Marquet was born in 1875 in Bordeaux. In 1890 he moved to Paris to attend the École des Arts Decoratifs, where he met Henri Matisse. They were roommates for a time, and they influenced each other's work. Marquet began studies in 1892 at the École des Beaux-Arts under Gustave Moreau, a symbolist artist who was a follower of the Romantic tradition of Eugène Delacroix. In these years, Marquet exhibited paintings at the Salon des Indépendants. Although he did not sell many paintings, the artistic community of Paris became aware of his work. His early compositions were characterised by a clear and painterly Fauvist approach, in which he had a fine control of the drawing and responded to light, not only by intensifying the strongest tones, but also by seeing the weaker ones in coloristic terms. Marquet and Matisse were already painting together in pure colors, as far back as 1898 in the Arcueil and at the Luxembourg Gardens, in what was later to be called the Fauve style.Marquet quoted by J. E. Müller, Le Fauvisme, Paris, Hazan, 1956, p. 18 and quoted by J. P. Crespelle, The Fauves, Oldbourne Press, London 1962, p. 66 In 1905 he exhibited at the Salon d'AutomneCatalogue des ouvrages de peinture, sculpture, dessin, gravure, architecture et art décoratif, Société du Salon d'automne 1905, p.120, №1044-1048; archive.org where his paintings were put together with those of Henri Matisse, Maurice de Vlaminck, André Derain, Othon Friesz, Georges Rouault, Raoul Dufy, Henri Manguin, Georges Braque, Louis Valtat, Georges Dufrénoy and Jean Puy. He became a lifelong friend of Matisse.Ian Chilvers, Harold Osborne (Eds.), The Oxford Dictionary of Art, OUP (1988), p. 351, Dismayed by the intense coloration in these paintings, critics reacted by naming the artists the \\"Fauves\\", i.e. the wild beasts. Although Marquet painted with the fauves for years, he used less bright and violent colours than the others, and emphasized less intense tones made by mixing complementaries, thus always as colors and never as grays. Marquet subsequently painted in a more naturalistic style, primarily landscapes. At the end of 1907 he stayed in Paris and dedicated himself, together with Matisse, to a series of city views. The fundamental difference between the two is that while Matisse used strong colours, Marquet favored grayed yellows, greyed violets or blues. Black was usually used as a violent contrast to light colors for such forms as bare tree trunks or calligraphically drawn people contrasted with very light, often yellow or orange streets and sidewalks. Another difference is that Marquet used an approximation of traditional perspective, although his colors and compositions constantly referred to the rectangle and cut its plane with their calligraphy. From 1907 to his death, Marquet alternated between working in his studio in Paris and many parts of the European coast and in North Africa. He was most involved with Algeria and Algiers and with Tunisia. In his voyages he painted the sea and ships, but also the lights and animated life of the city, especially cities on the waterfront, like Algiers. Among European cities Marquet remained impressed particularly with Naples and Venice where he painted the sea and boats, accenting the light over water. He adopted a technique nothing like the Impressionists', painting water as a large area of simple tone which held the plane of the water surface without illusionistic perspective, from which the ships arise into a different plane. His views of the lagoon in Venice do this very economically. The water stays at a right angle to the picture plane and the large ships float with ease, with their reflections exactly the correct tone to project the required space. His color is much like Matisse of the 1920s, here. His contrasts of vivid colors describe the waves of the sea with simple drawing which accompany the exactly observed color tones, giving a scene of placid movement. The human figures are much simplified, calligraphically drawn in a way related to Japanese Shijo style work. Matisse said, \\"When I look at Hokusai, I think of Marquet—and vice versa ... I don't mean imitation of Hokusai, I mean similarity with him\\".Spurling, Hilary (2001) Unknown Matisse. University of California Press. p. 224. During his voyages to Germany and Sweden he painted the subjects he usually preferred: river and sea views, ports and ships, but also cityscapes. Over the course of his career he often returned to the same subjects, even years later, recording subtle differences in the light. He painted a few portraits, and between 1910 and 1914 he painted a series of nudes in whorehouses, and prepared the illustration of a work on lesbian lovers. But he is best known for his many landscapes.Gazette des beaux-arts, 1912/01 (A54,T7)-1912/06., p.359 Gallica BnFGazette des beaux-arts, 1913/01 (A55,T9)-1913/06, p.261 (p.361) Gallica BnF Unlike Matisse, there are no obvious periods of change in his work. As one of Matisse's closest friends, they discussed each other's work with the greatest openness. Marquet's death was unexpected and sudden, from a gall bladder attack and subsequently discovered cancer, for which at that time there was no therapy. He died in La Frette-sur-Seine, on 14 June 1947. Legacy Although he notes that Marquet is conventionally regarded as a minor painter, the English painter John McLean is among those who consider that \\"his feeling for colour, the lightness or darkness and saturation of it, its weight, is nothing less than astounding.\\"McLean, John, introductory essay to exhibition catalogue: Euan Uglow, December 2–31, 1993, New York, Salander-O'Reilly Galleries, Inc. Marquet was particularly revered by the American painters Leland Bell and his wife Louisa Matthiasdottir. He was also revered by Bell's contemporaries Al Kresch and Gabriel Laderman. Since both Bell and Laderman were teachers in several American art schools, they have had an influence on younger American figurative artists and their appreciation of Marquet.Laderman, G. \\"Expressionists, Concentric and Eccentric\\", Artforum, Feb. 1969.

The modern development started in the early 1980s but the area has an ancient past associated with that of Old Basing. The name derives from a wooded dell that still exists at the western end of Little Basing. Lych or Lich being the Old English name for a corpse, it is assumed that the pit was therefore some kind of mass burial ground, local tradition associating it with the Danish victory over Alfred's Saxons at the Battle of Basing in 871. Another possibility is that it was used to bury casualties of the Battle of Basing House, where Oliver Cromwell's troops laid siege to and eventually sacked this large private house. Several of the local roads bear the names of Cromwell's officers e.g. Norton Ride and Gage Close. Next to the Lychpit is a public house and restaurant making use of an old water mill on the River Loddon, a tributary of the River Thames. The river is well-stocked with trout and visitors to the pub can sometimes see kingfishers that hunt along the river banks, despite the roar of frequent trains overhead on the London line. Daneshill, which comprises rising and still wooded ground overlooking Lychpit has a reasonable example of Lutyens architecture in Daneshill House, formerly home to the Hoare family. Immediately before the first modern houses were built Hampshire County Council which had bought much of the land, commissioned an archaeological survey. The soil was stripped revealing the underlying chalk and with the help of RAF helicopters from nearby RAF Odiham they were able to spot and photograph the staining caused by timber building post holes dating from the Bronze Age. Armed with this invaluable knowledge of where to look the survey revealed several ancient timber building sites, artifacts, and a few skeletons of similar vintage. There are also visible remains of a Park Pale near Pyotts Hill, which surrounded a hunting park in the area during the middle ages.http://www.hants.gov.uk/hampshiretreasures/vol02/page012.html  accessdate = 2007-05-23 Park Pale is also said to be the line of part of a Roman road connecting the fort at Silchester with Chichester, another important Roman garrison on the South Coast.

It never entered production. Overview The Big Q began life in 1963 as a replacement for the AIR-2 Genie rocket. The Genie was unguided, and had generally poor flight performance characteristics. The Big Q was to be a much more capable weapon, intended to engage Soviet bombers. Big Q is actually a nickname only. The right to name the missile was given to the initial designer, 1st Lt John McMasters, who chose the name of the Aztec serpent god Quetzalcoatl. This led to a tremendous number of pronunciation and spelling errors until virtually everybody associated with the project referred to it as Big Q for short. In 1965 the ZAIM-68A designation was assigned to the missile. A 20% model was successfully tested in a wind tunnel during that year and in June a contract was awarded to National Tapered Wing Engineering Company to produce 20 fuselage sections for prototype missiles. The AIM-68 was designed with a dual- thrust solid-propellant rocket and was capable of reaching speeds of Mach 4 over its range. The prototypes were fitted with infrared guidance systems from GAR-2A/B (AIM-4C/D) Falcon missiles; the rocket motor from the AGM-12 Bullpup was used for propulsion. The warhead was a W30 0.5 kiloton nuclear warhead, smaller than the 1.5 kiloton model used on the Genie. The guidance system allowed the missile to be used against maneuvering targets, including single bombers, rather than whole formations as was the case for the Genie. The reduced yield and greater range also made using the weapon a far less hazardous prospect for the launching aircraft. Potential users of the Big Q included the F-101B, F-102A, F-106A, F-4C. The size of the missile was dictated by these choices, as some of the aircraft carried weapons in an internal bay. As part of the effort to keep the size down, the missile was fitted with fold-out sections on the main wings. There have been attempts to reuse the -68 designation; notably the U.S. Navy wanted their new Standard Block V missile to be known as the RIM-68A. This failed (the designation RIM-156A was used instead). In 1995, the Navy tried to change it again—apparently wanting an operational missile to have a continuous run with the RIM-66 Standard MR and RIM-67 Standard ER designations. The request was refused again.

Using denial, misdirection, contradiction, and misinformation, gaslighting involves attempts to destabilize the victim and delegitimize the victim's beliefs. Instances can range from the denial by an abuser that previous abusive incidents occurred, to belittling the victim's emotions and feelings, to the staging of bizarre events by the abuser with the intention of disorienting the victim. The term originated from the British play Gas Light (1938), performed as Angel Street in the United States, and its 1940 and 1944 film adaptations (both titled Gaslight). The term has now been used in clinical psychological literature, as well as in political commentary and philosophy.  Etymology  Ingrid Bergman and Joseph Cotten in the 1944 film Gaslight The term originates in the systematic psychological manipulation of a victim by her husband in Patrick Hamilton’s 1938 stage play Gas Light, and the film adaptations released in 1940 and 1944. In the story, the husband attempts to convince his wife and others that she is insane by manipulating small elements of their environment and insisting that she is mistaken, remembering things incorrectly, or delusional when she points out these changes. The play's title alludes to how the abusive husband slowly dims the gas lights in their home, while pretending nothing has changed, in an effort to make his wife doubt her own perceptions. He further uses the lights in the sealed-off attic to secretly search for jewels belonging to a woman whom he has murdered. He makes loud noises as he searches, including talking to himself. The wife repeatedly asks her husband to confirm her perceptions about the dimming lights, noises and voices, but in defiance of reality, he keeps insisting that the lights are the same and instead it is she who is going insane. He intends on having her assessed and committed to a mental institution, after which he will be able to gain power of attorney over her and search more effectively. The term \\"gaslighting\\" has been used colloquially since the 1960s 1969 S. C. Plog Changing Perspectives in Mental Illness 83 It is also popularly believed to be possible to 'gaslight' a perfectly healthy person into psychosis by interpreting his own behavior to him as symptomatic of serious mental illness. to describe efforts to manipulate someone's perception of reality. The term has been used to describe such behaviour in psychoanalytic literature since the 1970s. In a 1980 book on child sexual abuse, Florence Rush summarized George Cukor's Gaslight (1944) based on the play and wrote, \\"even today the word [gaslighting] is used to describe an attempt to destroy another's perception of reality.\\"  Characteristics  Gaslighting involves a person, or a group of persons, the mental abuser or the victimizer, and a second person, the victim. It can be either conscious or unconscious, and is carried out covertly such, that the resulting emotional abuse is not overtly abusive. Gaslighting depends on \\"first convincing the victim that [the victim's] thinking is distorted and secondly persuading [the victim] that the victimizer's ideas are the correct and true ones\\". Gaslighting induces cognitive dissonance in the victim, \\"often quite emotionally charged cognitive dissonance\\", and makes the victim question their own thinking, perception, and reality testing, and thereby tends to evoke in them low self-esteem and disturbing ideas and affects, and may facilitate development of confusion, anxiety, depression, and in some extreme cases, even psychosis. After the victim loses confidence in their mental capacities and develops a sense of learned helplessness, they become more susceptible to the victimizer's control. Victims tend to be people with less power and authority. The role of either victimizer or victim can oscillate within a given relationship, and often each of the participants is convinced that they are the victim. When a group of people acts as the victimizer, gaslighting does its damage through the group members' \\"small, often invisible actions that have power through their accumulation and reinforcement\\". Gaslighting has been used by individuals and groups for \\"attaining interpersonal and social control over the psychic functioning of other individuals and groups\\". The illusory truth effect, a phenomenon in which a listener comes to believe something primarily because it has been repeated so often, may occur to a victim during gaslighting. = Psychoanalytic explanation = In a 1981 article, psychoanalysts Victor Calef and Edward Weinshel argued that gaslighting involves the projection and introjection (the \\"transfer\\") of psychic contents from the victimizer to the victim. The psychic contents include affects, perceptions, impulses, resistances, fantasies, delusions, conflicts. The authors explored a variety of reasons why the victims may have \\"a tendency to incorporate and assimilate what others externalize and project onto them\\", and concluded that gaslighting may be \\"a very complex highly structured configuration which encompasses contributions from many elements of the psychic apparatus\\". Later, psychiatrist Theodore Dorpat described this \\"transfer\\" of the victimizer's unconscious psychic contents as an example of projective identification. For projective identification to be most effective, the victim would be unaware of being gaslighted. It becomes destructive when the victim as well identifies with the contents of the \\"transfer\\" (what has been projected). These effects however are cancelled when the victim becomes capable of disbelieving and disidentifying with the negative introjects that result from projective identification.  In personality disorders  Sociopaths and narcissists frequently use gaslighting tactics to abuse and undermine their victims. Sociopaths consistently transgress social mores, break laws and exploit others, but typically also are convincing liars, sometimes charming ones, who consistently deny wrongdoing. Thus, some who have been victimized by sociopaths may doubt their own perceptions. Some physically abusive spouses may gaslight their partners by flatly denying that they have been violent. Gaslighting may occur in parent–child relationships, with either parent, child, or both lying to the other and attempting to undermine perceptions.  In psychiatry  Gaslighting has been observed between patients and staff in inpatient psychiatric facilities. In a 1996 book, Dorpat claimed that \\"gaslighting and other methods of interpersonal control are widely used by mental health professionals as well as other people\\" because they are effective methods for shaping the behavior of other individuals. He noted that covert methods of interpersonal control such as gaslighting are used by clinicians with authoritarian attitudes, and he recommended instead more non-directive and egalitarian attitudes and methods on the part of clinicians, \\"treating patients as active collaborators and equal partners\\".  In romantic relationships  In interpersonal relationships, the victimizer \\"needs to be right\\" in order to \\"preserve [their] own sense of self\\", and \\"[their] sense of having power in the world\\"; and the victim allows the victimizer to \\"define [their] sense of reality\\" inasmuch as the victim \\"idealizes [them]\\" and \\"seeks [their] approval\\". The psychological manipulation may include making the victim question their own memory, perception, and sanity. The abuser may invalidate the victim's experiences using dismissive language: \\"You're crazy. Don't be so sensitive. Don't be paranoid. I was just joking! ... I'm worried; I think you're not well.\\" Psychologists Jill Rogers and Diane Follingstad said that such dismissals can be detrimental to mental health outcomes. They described psychological abuse as \\"a range of aversive behaviors that are intended to harm an individual through coercion, control, verbal abuse, monitoring, isolation, threatening, jealousy, humiliation, manipulation, treating one as an inferior, creating a hostile environment, wounding a person regarding their sexuality and/or fidelity, withholding from a partner emotionally and/or physically\\". Gaslighting has been observed in some cases of marital infidelity: \\"Therapists may contribute to the victim's distress through mislabeling the [victim's] reactions. [...] The gaslighting behaviors of the spouse provide a recipe for the so-called 'nervous breakdown' for some [victims] [and] suicide in some of the worst situations.\\" In their 1988 article \\"Gaslighting: A Marital Syndrome\\", psychologists Gertrude Zemon Gass and William Nichols studied men's extramarital affairs and their consequences on their wives. They described how a man may try to convince his wife that she is imagining things rather than admitting to an affair: \\"a wife picks up a telephone extension in her own home and accidentally overhears her husband and his girlfriend planning a tryst while he is on a business trip.\\" His denial challenges the evidence of her senses: \\"I wasn't on the telephone with any girlfriend. You must have been dreaming.\\" Rogers and Follingstad examined women's experiences with psychological abuse as a predictor of symptoms and clinical levels of depression, anxiety, and somatization, as well as suicidal ideation and life functioning. They concluded that psychological abuse affects women's mental health outcomes, but the perceived negative changes in one's traits, problematic relationship schemas, and response styles were stronger indicators of mental health outcomes than the actual abuse. Psychotherapist Stephanie Moulton Sarkis explained that it takes \\"a certain amount of cognitive dissonance to remain connected to a gaslighter\\" and that \\"the healthiest way to resolve cognitive dissonance\\" in such situations involves \\"leaving or distancing yourself from the gaslighter\\". = Signs and methods = As described by Patricia Evans, seven \\"warning signs\\" of gaslighting are the observed abuser's: # Withholding information from the victim; # Countering information to fit the abuser's perspective; #Discounting information; # Using verbal abuse, usually in the form of jokes; # Blocking and diverting the victim's attention from outside sources; #Trivializing (\\"minimising\\") the victim's worth; and, #Undermining the victim by gradually weakening them and their thought processes. Evans considers it necessary to understand the warning signs in order to begin the process of healing from it. The psychologist Elinor Greenberg has described three common methods of gaslighting: #Hiding. The abuser may hide things from the victim and cover up what they have done. Instead of feeling ashamed, the abuser may convince the victim to doubt their own beliefs about the situation and turn the blame on themselves. #Changing. The abuser feels the need to change something about the victim. Whether it be the way the victim dresses or acts, they want the victim to mold into their fantasy. If the victim does not comply, the abuser may convince the victim that he or she is in fact not good enough. #Control. The abuser may want to fully control and have power over the victim. In doing so, the abuser will try to seclude them from other friends and family so only they can influence the victim's thoughts and actions. The abuser gets pleasure from knowing the victim is being fully controlled by them. An abuser's ultimate goal, as described by the divorce process coach Lindsey Ellison, is to make their victim second-guess their choices and to question their sanity, making them more dependent on the abuser. One tactic used to degrade a victim's self- esteem is the abuser alternating between ignoring and attending to the victim, so that the victim lowers their expectation of what constitutes affection, and perceives themselves as less worthy of affection. = Role of gender = Sociologist Paige Sweet, in the context of the social inequalities and power- laden intimate relationships of domestic violence, has studied gaslighting tactics that \\"are gendered in that they rely on the association of femininity with irrationality\\". According to philosophy professor Kate Abramson, the act of gaslighting is not specifically tied to being sexist, although women tend to be frequent targets of gaslighting compared to men who more often engage in gaslighting. Abramson explained this as a result of social conditioning, and said \\"it's part of the structure of sexism that women are supposed to be less confident, to doubt our views, beliefs, reactions, and perceptions, more than men. And gaslighting is aimed at undermining someone's views, beliefs, reactions, and perceptions. The sexist norm of self-doubt, in all its forms, prepares us for just that.\\" Abramson said that the final \\"stage\\" of gaslighting is severe, major, clinical depression. With respect to women in particular, philosophy professor Hilde Lindemann said that in such cases, the victim's ability to resist the manipulation depends on \\"her ability to trust her own judgements\\". Establishment of \\"counterstories\\" may help the victim reacquire \\"ordinary levels of free agency\\". Psychotherapist Stephanie Moulton Sarkis, who observed gaslighting to be present in about 30–40% of the couples she treats, says that \\"Gaslighting is as likely to be done by men as women\\" and that \\"as far as we know, the genders are represented equally\\". She explains further that we tend to think gaslighters to be mostly men because \\"men are often more reluctant (perhaps embarrassed) to talk to someone about a female partner who is being emotionally abusive\\".  In parent-child relationships  Children at the hands of unloving parents may become victims of gaslighting. Maternal gaslighting of daughters has received particular attention. In a section titled “Lying, Gaslighting, and Denial” in her best- seller Mothers Who Can’t Love: A Healing Guide for Daughters, therapist and author Susan Forward writes: “A severely narcissistic mother’s anger, criticism, and thoughtless dismissal of her daughter’s feelings are painful and destructive. And every daughter clings to the belief that if only her mother could see that behavior and its effects, she’d stop. Daughters try again and again to hold up a mirror, hoping that this time, things will be different. But severe narcissists stay true to form, responding to any confrontation with drama followed by deflection and a focus on your shortcomings. When that doesn’t produce the desired results, they turn to what may be their most frustrating and infuriating tool: denial. Confrontation makes them feel cornered, and when that happens, they can’t and won’t validate your experience or acknowledge their part in it. Rather, they rewrite reality and tell you that what you saw, you didn’t see, what you experienced didn’t happen, and what you call real is actually a figment of your imagination.” But both mothers and fathers may gaslight children. Psychologically abusive parents often put on a “good parent” face in public yet withhold love and care in private, leading children to question their own perceptions of reality and to wonder whether their parent is the good person everyone else sees or the much darker person that comes out when child and parent are alone. Manipulative parents may also “pit children against each other; ... play favorites but persuade the unloved child it’s all his or her fault for not being more gifted, prettier, and otherwise more lovable.”  In politics  Columnist Maureen Dowd was one of the first to use the term in the political context. She described the Bill Clinton administration's use of the technique in subjecting Newt Gingrich to small indignities intended to provoke him to make public complaints that \\"came across as hysterical\\". In his 2008 book State of Confusion: Political Manipulation and the Assault on the American Mind, psychologist Bryant Welch described the prevalence of the technique in American politics beginning in the age of modern communications, stating: Journalist Frida Ghitis used the term \\"gaslighting\\" to describe Russia's global relations. While Russian operatives were active in Crimea, Russian officials continually denied their presence and manipulated the distrust of political groups in their favor. Journalists at The New York Times Magazine, BBC and Teen Vogue, as well as psychologists Bryant Welch, Robert Feldman and Leah McElrath, have described some of the actions of Donald Trump during the 2016 US presidential election and his term as president as examples of gaslighting.From 'alternative facts' to rewriting history in Trump's White House, BBC, Jon Sopel, 26 July 2018 Journalism professor Ben Yagoda wrote in The Chronicle of Higher Education in January 2017 that the term gaslighting had become topical again as the result of Trump's behavior, saying that Trump's \\"habitual tendency to say 'X', and then, at some later date, indignantly declare, 'I did not say \\"X\\". In fact, I would never dream of saying \\"X\\"' had brought new notability to the term. Gaslighting is utilized by leaders and followers of sectarian groups to ensure conformity of any potentially deviating members.  In the workplace  Gaslighting in the workplace is when people do things that cause colleagues to question themselves and their actions in a way that is detrimental to their careers. The victim may be excluded, made the subject of gossip, persistently discredited or questioned to destroy their confidence. The perpetrator may divert conversations to perceived faults or wrongs. Gaslighting can be committed by anyone and can be especially detrimental when the perpetrator has a position of power.  In popular culture  The 2016 mystery and psychological thriller film The Girl on the Train explored the direct effects gaslighting had on the protagonist (Rachel). During her marriage, Rachel's ex- husband Tom was a violent abuser and victimizer. Rachel suffered from severe depression and alcoholism. When Rachel would black out drunk, he consistently told her that she had done terrible things that she was incapable of remembering. Gaslighting was the main theme of a 2016 plotline in BBC's radio soap opera, The Archers. The story concerned the emotional abuse of Helen Archer by her partner and later husband, Rob Titchener, over the course of two years, and caused much public discussion about the phenomenon. For several months during 2018, gaslighting was a main plotline in NBC's soap opera Days of Our Lives, as character Gabi Hernandez was caught gaslighting her best friend Abigail Deveroux after Gabi was framed for a murder Abigail had committed in the series. In March 2020, The Chicks released a song titled \\"Gaslighter\\", the title track from their album Gaslighter, a reference to gaslighting inspired by lead singer Natalie Maines' divorce from actor Adrian Pasdar.

He studied at Yale University, where he was an editor of campus humor magazine The Yale Record\\"Grosvenor Atterbury\\". The twelfth general catalogue of the Psi Upsilon Fraternity. New York: Psi Upsilon. May, 1917. p. 158. After travelling in Europe, he studied architecture at Columbia University and worked in the offices of McKim, Mead & White. Much of Atterbury's early work consisted of weekend houses for wealthy industrialists. Atterbury was given the commission for the model housing community of Forest Hills Gardens which began in 1909 under the sponsorship of the Russell Sage Foundation. For Forest Hills, Atterbury developed an innovative construction method: each house was built from approximately 170 standardized precast concrete panels, fabricated off- site and assembled by crane. The system was sophisticated even by modern standards: panels were cast with integral hollow insulation chambers; casting formwork incorporated an internal sleeve, allowing molds to be \\"broken\\" before concrete had completely set; and panels were moved to the site in only two operations (formwork to truck and truck to crane). Atterbury's system influenced the work of mid-1920s European modern architects like Ernst May, who used panelized prefab concrete systems in a number of celebrated experimental housing projects in Frankfurt. In this way Atterbury can be considered a progenitor of the Modern Movement. Atterbury was elected to the National Academy of Design in 1918 as an Associate member, and became a full member in 1940. Atterbury worked on various projects with John D. Rockefeller, Jr., in the 1930s, including what today is Stone Barns Food and Agriculture Center, and the Gatehouse and Entrance Wall to Kykuit Estate, as well as the six stucco houses built for estate employees. The six houses were designed as the core of Pocantico Village that Rockefeller was building as Kykuit was being completed, and to complement the style of the Union Church and Pocantico Hills Central School, which he had completed.Pennoyer, Peter (2009).

The two married in 1921 after a courtship of less than a year, and moved to Paris within months of being married. In Paris, Hemingway pursued a writing career, and through him Hadley met other expatriate British and American writers. In 1925, Hadley learned of Hemingway's affair with Pauline Pfeiffer. Pfeiffer had been Hadley's best friend and had lived and traveled with the Hemingways. Hadley divorced Hemingway in 1927. In 1933, Hadley married a second time, to journalist Paul Mowrer, whom she met in Paris.  Early life  Elizabeth Hadley Richardson was born on November 9, 1891 in St. Louis, Missouri, the youngest of five children. Hadley's mother, Florence Wyman-Richardson, was an accomplished musician and singer, and her father James Richardson Jr., worked for a family- owned pharmaceutical company. As a child, Hadley fell out of a second-story window and consequently was bed-ridden for a year. After the accident, her mother became overly protective, not allowing Hadley to learn how to swim or engage in other physical activities. Hadley's father was less protective, but in 1903 he committed suicide in response to financial difficulties. As a teenager, Hadley became painfully shy and reclusive. She attended Mary Institute in St. Louis, and then attended college at Bryn Mawr. However, when her mother decided Hadley was \\"too delicate, both physically and emotionally,\\" she left college. The death of her sister Dorothea in an apartment fire earlier that year may have contributed to Hadley's decision to leave college. Hemingway scholar Jamie Barlowe believes Hadley represented a \\"True Woman\\" as opposed to a \\"New Woman\\" of the early 20th century. The \\"True Woman\\" was \\"emotional, dependent, gentle—a true follower.\\" After her return from college, Hadley lived a restricted life—her sister and her mother continued to worry about her health—with little opportunity for physical activity or much of a social life. Her mother did allow Hadley to visit her former Bryn Mawr roommate Edna Rapallo in Vermont one summer. While visiting her friend, she enjoyed playing tennis, and she met Maxfield Parrish, but when her mother became worried over her well-being, she was forced to return home. While her mother became reclusive and immersed herself in spiritualism, Hadley spent some years attempting to attain a career as a pianist, until she abandoned music, believing she lacked talent. She later did perform weekly in a church. When her mother developed Bright's Disease, Hadley nursed her until her death. Ernest Hemingway Hadley and Ernest Hemingway in Switzerland, 1922 Shortly after her mother's death, in December 1920, Hadley visited her old roommate Kate Smith (who later married John Dos Passos) in Chicago, and through her met Hemingway, who was living with Smith's brother and was employed as an associate editor of the monthly journal Cooperative Commonwealth.Meyers pp 56–59. When Hadley returned to St. Louis, Hemingway, who became infatuated with her, wrote \\"I knew she was the girl I was going to marry.\\" Hadley, eight years older than Hemingway, was red-haired, with a \\"nurturing instinct.\\" Bernice Kert, author of The Hemingway Women, claims Hadley was \\"evocative\\" of the woman whom Hemingway met and fell in love with during his recuperation from injuries during World War I, Agnes von Kurowsky, but in Hadley, Hemingway saw a childishness Agnes lacked. During the winter of 1921, Hadley took up her music again and indulged in outdoor activities. She and Hemingway corresponded during the winter. When she expressed misgivings about their age difference, he \\"protested that it made no difference at all.\\" Hemingway visited her in St. Louis in March 1921, and two weeks later she visited him in Chicago. Then, they did not see each other for two months until he returned to St. Louis in May. In their correspondence, she promised to buy him a Corona typewriter for his birthday. In June, she announced her engagement despite objections to the marriage from his friends and her sister. Hadley believed she knew what she was doing, and more importantly, she had an inheritance with which to support herself and a husband. She believed in Hemingway's talent and believed \\"she was right for him.\\" They were married on September 3, 1921 in Bay Township, Michigan and spent their honeymoon at the Hemingway family summer cottage on Walloon Lake. The weather was miserable, and both Hadley and Hemingway came down with fever, sore throat, and cough. The couple returned to Chicago after their honeymoon, where they lived in a small apartment on North Dearborn Street. The death of a hated uncle gave Hadley another inheritance and additional financial independence for the couple. Initially, they intended to visit Rome, but Sherwood Anderson convinced them to visit Paris instead. Anderson's advice to live in Paris interested her, and when two months later Hemingway was hired as foreign correspondent for the Toronto Star, the couple left for Paris. Of Hemingway's marriage to Hadley, Hemingway biographer Jeffrey Meyers claims: \\"With Hadley, Hemingway achieved everything he had hoped for with Agnes: the love of a beautiful woman, a comfortable income, a life in Europe.\\" = Paris = In Paris, Hadley and Hemingway lived in a small apartment at 74, rue du Cardinal Lemoine in the Latin Quarter. That winter, he discovered the Shakespeare and Company bookshop, which also functioned as a lending library, and was run by American expatriate Sylvia Beach. Hadley went there to buy James Joyce's works, which she liked, because Beach had published Joyce's Ulysses. The Hemingways first met Joyce at the book shop in March 1922. Ernest Hemingway (left), with Harold Loeb, Lady Duff Twysden (in hat), Hadley Richardson Hemingway, Donald Ogden Stewart (obscured), and Pat Guthrie (far right) in Pamplona, Spain, July 1925. Through Anderson's letters of introduction, Hemingway met Ezra Pound, who invited the couple for tea, and they were invited to Gertrude Stein's salon. Stein in turn visited the young couple in their apartment. Hemingway's and Stein's relationship turned hostile after Hemingway gained fame (see Hemingway's Boat, Paul Hendrickson, 2011, and Hemingway, Kenneth Lynn, 1987). That spring, Hadley and Hemingway traveled to Italy and, in the summer, to Germany. Hadley went alone to Geneva in December 1922 to meet Hemingway who was covering a peace conference. It was during this trip, while waiting for a train at the Gare de Lyon, that Hadley misplaced and lost a suitcase filled with Hemingway's manuscripts. Devastated and angry at the loss of his work, he blamed her. A few months later, when they learned Hadley was pregnant, the couple decided to move to Toronto for the child's birth. Before they left, the couple went for the first time to watch the bullfighting and the running of the bulls at the Festival of San Fermín in Pamplona. Their son John Hadley Nicanor Hemingway was born on October 10, 1923 in Toronto. He was named for his mother Hadley and for the young Spanish matador Nicanor Villalta, who had impressed Hemingway the previous summer. The baby was healthy, and the birth quick; Hemingway missed it, as he had been sent to New York on assignment, and was returning on a train when his wife went into labor. Hadley nicknamed the infant Bumby. In Toronto, the family lived in a small apartment on Bathurst Street with \\"wall space enough to hang their collection of paintings.\\" Hadley called the assignments given to her husband at the Toronto Star \\"absurd.\\" Hemingway considered Toronto boring and wanted to return to Paris to the life of a writer rather than live the life of a Toronto journalist. When Bumby was only a few months old, they returned to Paris, and in January 1924 moved into a new apartment on Rue Notre Dame des Champs. Hadley hired a woman to help with housework and with Bumby, and borrowed a pram to take the baby on walks in the Luxembourg Gardens. Bumby's christening was held at St. Luke's Episcopal Church in March with \\"Chink\\" Dorman-Smith and Gertrude Stein as godparents. A few months later, mismanagement of her funds left Hadley with a financial loss, and at the same time, Hemingway started work as an editor for Ezra Pound and Ford Madox Ford's small modernist magazine the Transatlantic Review. In June, Hadley and Hemingway went again to Pamplona, leaving Bumby in Paris,, and that winter, they went for the first time to Austria to vacation in Schruns. Sometime after their return to Paris from Canada, Hemingway met the Pfeiffer sisters. When in June 1925 Hemingway and Hadley left Paris for their annual visit to Pamplona—the third year they had done so—they were accompanied by a group of American and British expatriates, including Pauline Pfeiffer. The trip inspired Hemingway's first novel The Sun Also Rises, which he began to write immediately after the fiesta, finishing it in September. In November, as a birthday present for Hadley, Hemingway bought Joan Miró's painting The Farm. = Divorce = Their marriage disintegrated as Hemingway was writing and revising The Sun Also Rises, although he dedicated the novel to \\"Hadley and ...John Hadley Nicanor.\\" For the second year, they went to Schruns for Christmas, but that year they were joined by Pauline Pfeiffer. Hemingway returned with Pfeiffer to Paris, leaving Hadley with Bumby in Austria. While Hadley was in Austria, Hemingway sailed to New York then returned to Paris in March, at which time he may have begun his affair with Pauline. In the spring of 1926, Hadley became aware of the affair, although she endured Pauline's presence in Pamplona that July. On their return to Paris, Hadley and Hemingway decided to separate, and Hadley formally requested a divorce in the fall. By November they had split their possessions, and Hadley accepted Hemingway's offer of the royalties from The Sun Also Rises. The couple divorced in January 1927, and Hemingway married Pauline Pfeiffer in May the same year.  Paul Mowrer  Hadley stayed in France until 1934. Among her many friends in Paris was Paul Mowrer, foreign correspondent for the Chicago Daily News, whom she had met in the spring of 1927, not long after her divorce was finalized. A journalist and political writer, in 1929 Mowrer won the Pulitzer Prize. On July 3, 1933, after a five-year courtship, Hadley and Paul Mowrer were married in London. Hadley was especially grateful for Mowrer's warm relationship with Bumby. Not long after the two married, they moved back to the U.S. to a suburb of Chicago, where they lived during World War II. She continued to receive royalties from The Sun Also Rises,, which included the royalties for the 1957 film.  A Moveable Feast  Hemingway's memoir A Moveable Feast, not published until 1964, three years after Hemingway's death, captures Hemingway's marriage to Hadley and their life together in Paris during the early to mid-1920s.  Later years and death  When Hadley left her marriage to Hemingway, she left the limelight. She reportedly saw Hemingway only twice after their divorce. In July 1939, she and Mowrer ran into him while vacationing in Wyoming, and, according to A.E. Hotchner, the last time Hemingway reported seeing Hadley was after a brief and spontaneous meeting in Paris.Hotchner, A. E. (2015). \\"Hemingway in Love\\", Smithsonian, October 2015, p. 80. Hadley died on January 22, 1979 in Lakeland, Florida at the age of 87. She is buried in New Hampshire at Chocorua Cemetery in Tamworth. In 1992, Hadley by Gioia Diliberto, a biography of Hadley Richardson, was published. The book, which is based on extensive research, including the author's exclusive access to a series of taped conversations with Richardson, was reissued in 2011 as Paris Without End: The True Story of Hemingway's First Wife. In 2011, a book titled The Paris Wife: A Novel was published, telling the entire story of Hadley Richardson's relationship with Hemingway in \\"her voice.\\" Although a work of fiction, its narrative is faithful to the known facts.

Life Born at Haverhill, Massachusetts, he graduated from Harvard College in 1852, where he established the overcoat fund for needy undergraduates. In 1856 he graduated from Harvard Law School, was admitted to the bar of Suffolk County and began to practice law in Boston. From 1873 to 1883 he was Royall professor of law at Harvard. In 1883 he was transferred to the professorship which after 1893 was known as the Weld professorship and which he held until his death on February 14, 1902. He took a special interest in the historical evolution of law. He wrote: The Origin and Scope of the American Doctrine of Constitutional Law (1893); Cases on Evidence (1892); Cases on Constitutional Law (1895); The Development of Trial by Jury (1896); A Preliminary Treatise on Evidence at the Common Law (1898), and a short life of John Marshall (1901); and edited the twelfth edition of Kent's Commentaries and the Letters of Chauncey Wright (1877), and A Westward Journey with Mr. Emerson (1884). Rational basis review The concept of rational basis review can be traced to an influential 1893 article, \\"The Origin and Scope of American Constitutional Law,\\" by Thayer. Thayer argued that statutes should be invalidated only if their unconstitutionality is \\"so clear that it is not open to rational question.\\" Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., a student of Thayer's, articulated a version of what would become rational basis review in his canonical dissent in Lochner v. New York, arguing that \\"the word 'liberty,' in the 14th Amendment, is perverted when it is held to prevent the natural outcome of a dominant opinion, unless it can be said that a rational and fair man necessarily would admit that the statute proposed would infringe fundamental principles as they have been understood by the traditions of our people and our law.\\" Works *Legal Essays BiblioBazaar, 2010, *A Preliminary Treatise on Evidence at the Common Law, BiblioLife, 2015, NotesReferences * External links  * Category:1831 births Category:1902 deaths Category:People from Haverhill, Massachusetts Category:American legal scholars Category:Harvard Law School alumni Category:Massachusetts lawyers Category:Harvard Law School faculty Category:Harvard College alumni ","title":"James Bradley Thayer"},{"id":"2484355","text":"Frank Joseph Augustyn, (born January 27, 1953) is a Canadian ballet dancer and artistic director.

As a boy, Augustyn's interests were in gymnastics and acrobatics; he once appeared on the variety series Tiny Talent Time as a gymnast.\\"Next Generation\\". The Globe and Mail, October 7, 2000. During a summer course at Canada's National Ballet School (often called The National) intended to help improve movement and his control for his gymnastic acrobatic training, his abilities for ballet were recognized by Betty Oliphant, founder and director of the school. Although Augustyn's parents were reluctant to have their son pursue ballet as a career, Augustyn continued in the school until at seventeen he joined the professional company National Ballet of Canada.Dalring, Christopher, text, John Fraser. MacMillan, Canada,1977. Professional career Augustyn joined the National Ballet of Canada in 1970. He was the National Ballet's principal dancer from 1972 to 1989. From 1980 to 1981, he was principal dancer at the Berlin Opera Ballet. From 1985 to 1986, he was the principal guest artist at the Boston Ballet. From 1989 to 1994, he was the artistic director of the Ottawa Ballet. He was a founding member of Ballet Revue (dancing his own piece, Personal Essay) and has appeared frequently on international television. Television viewers are familiar with Mr. Augustyn's series on ballet, Footnotes, seen on Bravo U.S. and Bravo Canada. In this series, which he co-wrote, co-produced and hosted, Mr. Augustyn outlines the history and techniques of classical ballet. He published Footnotes--Dancing the World's Best Loved Ballets, which was based on the television production, as well as his memoir, Dancing from the Heart. Augustyn often danced with Karen Kain. They won the award for best pas de deux at the 1973 Moscow International Ballet Competition, dancing the extremely difficult Blue Bird pas de deux from Sleeping Beauty.

Its hull is of a small-waterplane-area twin-hull (SWATH) design, provides exceptional stability, even on rough seas. The ship can operate in both blue and littoral waters. For power, it can use either its dual gas-turbine engines for speed or its dual diesel engines for efficient cruising. It can be easily reconfigured through the use of interchangeable mission modules. Helicopters can land and launch on its deck. Smaller water craft can be carried and launched from its stern. The vessel is being developed under the program title Littoral Surface Craft-Experimental (LSC(X)) with a hull type designation Fast Sea Frame. The first vessel has been assigned the hull classification symbol FSF 1 and also has been referred to as the X-Craft. The vessel was designed by British company BMT Nigel Gee Ltd (formerly BMT Nigel Gee and Associates Ltd) who continue with a role in the development of the vessel.BMT Technical paper on the project. http://media.bmt.org/bmt_media/resources/29/Paper49-TheX- Crafta73mExperimentalPlatformfortheUSNavy.pdfDesign specifications, plans and images. http://media.bmt.org/bmt_media/resources/29/NG427-SeaFighterFSF1.pdf  Description  A helicopter lands on Sea Fighter underway Sea Fighters hull is a small-waterplane-area twin hull (SWATH) design, constructed out of aluminum. With twin gas turbine engines, quad water jets, and streamlined hulls, Sea Fighter is capable of speeds of and greater. It is designed to be a sea frame that can carry interchangeable mission modules resembling shipping containers. These modules allow it to be easily reconfigured to meet a variety of mission requirements, including mine warfare, anti-submarine operations, amphibious assault support, surface warfare, transport and logistical missions, cruise-missile launch, and special-forces interdiction operations. The mission modules are easily loaded and stored on Sea Fighters inner deck. The vessel has the capability of launching small craft up to in length from the stern, including assault craft and submersibles by means of a custom dual- purpose ramp that also enables RORO operations for HMMWV and other vehicles. The vessel also has a twin-pad helicopter deck capable of operating aircraft up to the size of an H-60 type, including unmanned aerial vehicles, and landing helicopters while travelling at speeds of up to . A special deck- lighting system has been developed for Sea Fighter using low-intensity green lighting around the vessel's edges and helipads. This lighting is particularly effective when using night-vision goggles, making landings on the vessel easier than on conventional warships, even at the higher speeds in which Sea Fighter operates. The basic design has a displacement of 1,100 tons while measuring long at waterline and broad. Power is provided by a CODOG arrangement comprising two MTU 595 diesel engines and two LM2500 gas turbines. Diesel power is used for cruising while the turbines provide high-power output for high-speed operation. The two gas turbines power the vessel's four water jets, drawing water from the bottom stern of each hull and powering it through large water turbines, which are responsible for the vessel's high operating speed. Each water jet has thrust vectoring and thrust reversers making it possible to move sideways while docking, or even travelling in astern. Thrust vectoring also makes it possible for Sea Fighter to make evasive maneuvers while travelling at high speed. This would prevent the craft from being forced to shore or into the path of enemy vessels. Sea Fighters forward superstructure consists of a bridge on the lower deck, and a flight operations station on top. The bridge is relatively small, and generally manned by a crew of three. The bridge control stations incorporate glass displays using the modern navigational aids to assist Sea Fighter in patrolling coastal areas while operating at high speed. Above the bridge is a small flight-operations station with room for only one operator. This glass-enclosed station provides an unobstructed view of the entire flight deck and allows the operator to coordinate the approach and landing of helicopters, and loading of the vessel's mission containers, as well as providing visual aid for navigation. The ship has a computer system to control its systems and for navigation. Steering and throttle control are done by wire rather than mechanical linkage. The first vessel of the type (FSF 1) was constructed at the Nichols Bros. Boat Builders shipyard at Freeland, Washington, under contract to Titan Corporation, a subsidiary of L-3 Communications. Nichols Shipyard was selected because of their previous experience in the construction of aluminium-hulled high-speed ferries. Role Sea Fighter is destined for employment by the Office of Naval Research as a testbed for technologies related to the Navy's littoral combat ship effort, as well as direct testing of the hull design. Once trials are completed, the Navy will have the option of outfitting the vessel for operational deployment. Future development Sea Fighter in San Diego with The Navy and Coast Guard are jointly exploring the possibility of further development of Sea Fighter–type vessels for use in patrolling U.S. coastal waters. With an effective range of unrefueled, the type could also be deployed quickly overseas. Sea Fighter is expected to pave the way for a future line of fast, long-range destroyers capable of travelling fast enough to avoid or outmaneuver most of the current generation of torpedoes. Such vessels would be capable of crossing the Atlantic Ocean unrefueled, and have a very low radar signature, making detection difficult. They would be able to respond quickly to targets located by air or satellite and aggressively attack surface and submerged vessels using their speed to evade torpedo and missile attack. Concerns Some concern has been raised with regard to the use of aluminium alloys almost exclusively in the construction of Sea Fighters hull, as well as future vessels based on the design. While aluminum alloys have a high specific strength, they melt at a lower temperature than steel. Some lay concern has been expressed about aluminum hulls actually burning, but only aluminum dust or powder is considered flammable.. Additionally galvanic corrosion may result between the aluminum hull and steel fittings, as happened to the littoral combat ship USS Independence.

Early life McCafferty was born in Derry, Northern Ireland, to Hugh and Lily McCafferty, and spent her early years in the Bogside area of Derry. She was admitted to Queen's University Belfast (QUB), where she took a degree in Arts. After a brief spell as a substitute English teacher in Northern Ireland and a stint on an Israeli kibbutz, she took up a post with The Irish Times. Career McCafferty was a founding member of the Irish Women's Liberation Movement.Stopper, Anne. Monday At Gaj's: The Story of the Irish Women's Liberation Movement. \\"Introduction\\", p. 3. Her journalistic writing on women and women's rights reflected her beliefs on the status of women in Irish society. In 1970, she wrote a piece for the Irish Times on what women's liberation meant to her: In 1971, she travelled to Belfast with other members of the Irish Women's Liberation Movement in order to protest the prohibition of the importation and sale of contraceptives in the Republic of Ireland. The incident, which attracted extensive publicity, became known as the Contraceptive Train.http://www.rte.ie/archives/exhibitions/1666-women-and- society/370226-contraceptive-train/ After the disintegration of the Irish Women's Liberation Movement, McCafferty remained active in other women's rights groups, as well as focusing her journalism on women's rights. Her most notable work is her coverage of the Kerry Babies case, which is recorded in her book, A Woman to Blame.A Woman to Blame Irish author Colm Tóibín commended Nell McCafferty's impact on Ireland as a journalist and a feminist: McCafferty contributed the piece \\"Coping with the womb and the border\\" to the 1984 anthology Sisterhood Is Global: The International Women's Movement Anthology, edited by Robin Morgan. In 1990, McCafferty won a Jacob's Award for her reports on the 1990 World Cup for RTÉ Radio 1's The Pat Kenny Show. McCafferty lives in Ranelagh, an area of Dublin. McCafferty published her autobiography, Nell, in 2004. In it, she explores her upbringing in Derry, her relationship with her parents, her fears about being gay, the joy of finding a domestic haven with the love of her life, the Irish writer Nuala O'Faolain, and the pain of losing it. In 2009, after the publication of the Murphy Report into the abuse of children in the Dublin archdiocese, McCafferty confronted Archbishop Diarmuid Martin asking him why the Catholic Church had not, as a \\"gesture of redemption\\", relinquished titles such as \\"Your Eminence\\" and \\"Your Grace.\\" McCafferty caused a controversy in 2010 with a declaration in a live Newstalk radio interview that the then Minister for Health, Mary Harney, was an alcoholic. This allegation led to a court case in which Harney was awarded €450,000 the following year. McCafferty has very rarely featured on live radio or television in Ireland as a commentator since the incident, despite being ever present in those media from 1990 onwards.

The company was headquartered in Washington, DC and maintained technology and operations centers in Largo, Maryland. History InPhonic was founded in 1999 by David A. Steinberg who resigned in 2007 due to poor debt management and decreasing revenues. Its board of directors included former Vice-Presidential candidate Jack Kemp and technology/marketing guru John Sculley (of PepsiCo and Apple Computer fame). The company was modeled after sites like Expedia, gathering information from companies into a single site to help customers find deals by comparing services and prices. Wireless carriers did business with InPhonic because acquiring a customer through the company can be less expensive than traditional marketing approaches designed to generate sales at a brick-and- mortar store. InPhonic, in turn, received a commission from carriers for each new account generated, once the customer met a number of criteria. InPhonic helped grow this market for third-party activations to nearly 50% of all newly acquired cell phone subscribers in the U.S. The company's central online storefront, Wirefly.com, received a number of Internet awards, including Forbes magazine's \\"Best of the Web\\" for 2004 and Keynote System's \\"Best In Overall Customer Experience\\" in 2005. In addition to operating Wirefly.com, InPhonic powered the technology platform and fulfillment system of 6,000 other private label cell phone sales Web sites. In early 2006, the firm claimed that it was the largest third-party online cell phone retailer in the US, accounting for one-third of the market, and that it sold 850,000 cell phones in 2005 alone. In June 2006 the company said that it had completed more than 2.5 million cellphone activations in the past three years. On November 8, 2007, InPhonic filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The filings were made in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. The company's stock was later delisted by NASDAQ. Many of the assets of Inphonic, including its electronic commerce operations and its Wirefly.com web site, were subsequently sold to private investors who used those assets to launch the company Simplexity in January 2008. Financials In September 2001, the company closed a $19 million Series D round of capital financing headed by Core Capital Partners. The investment also included new investors McAndrews & Forbes, First Analysis, Spring Capital and Wynnefield Capital. All previous investors—including Sculley Brothers Investments, CMS Financial Services, and Mid Atlantic Venture Funds—participated as well. In 2003, Technology Crossover Ventures invested an additional $56 million in the company. The company went public in November 2004. The company raised $108.9 million through its initial public offering. The IPO was InPhonic's second attempt to tap the public markets; the company filed to go public in 2002 but canceled the offering because of stock market conditions at the time. In November 2006, Goldman Sachs—one of InPhonic’s largest shareholders—made the company a proposal to provide it with $100 million in debt financing, part of which InPhonic used for a large stock buy- back. In November 2007 InPhonic filed a Chapter 11 petition in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. InPhonic, along with its co-debtors, requested that their cases be jointly administered under case number 07-11166. Related to the Chapter 11 petition, InPhonic agreed to sell substantially all of its assets to an affiliate of Philadelphia-based private equity firm Versa Capital. In December 2007 the company's stock was delisted by NASDAQ. InPhonic attributed its bankruptcy filing, in part, to a recent default under a prepetition credit agreement, as well as illiquidity and declining revenues caused by unprofitable marketing activities and an inability to maintain adequate inventory of the most popular wireless devices. InPhonic’s top creditor list reads like a who’s who of the nation’s top technology companies. MSN, Yahoo!, Google, America Online and Verizon all rank among the debtor’s top ten creditors. In January 2008, Versa Capital announced that InPhonic's assets and infrastructure were being used to launch a new company named Simplexity. This new company is based in Reston, VA and led by CEO Andy Zeinfeld. Some cell phone sites which InPhonic operated Cell phone sites operated by InPhonic included: A1 Wireless, ACN Wireless, Cellular Buys, Cellular Choices, Corporate Wireless, FonCentral, INTELENET Wireless, Liberty Wireless, lowcostcells.com, Mobile Pro, Phone Deals, Simplexity, Talking on Air, Wirefly, Wireless Marketplace, WorldPerks Wireless Service, Mylan Cellular. Rebates InPhonic maintained an unsatisfactory rating with the Better Business Bureau serving Washington DC and Eastern Pennsylvania. Over the 36 months preceding October 2007 the BBB had processed 126 unresolved consumer complaints regarding selling practices, advertising issues, service issues among other areas of concern. In April 2007, the FCC settled rebate related charges against InPhonic. The Commission alleged that InPhonic, in connection with its advertised rebate offers, failed to provide promised documents needed to obtain rebates, to send out rebate checks, and to adequately disclose material terms and conditions prior to consumers purchases. The FCC further alleged that InPhonic misled some consumers about the number of wireless bills that had to be submitted with their rebate application and misrepresented that consumers would have a reasonable opportunity to resubmit rebate applications that were deemed incomplete. InPhonic was ordered to pay consumers who applied for a rebate with the company but were denied a check based on the company’s deceptive and unfair practices. InPhonic earlier settled similar charges leveled by the District of Columbia attorney general. A large number of InPhonic's customers complained about the non-fulfillment of rebates that were promised to customers. Many of these customers were listed as non-secured creditors in the company's Chapter 11 filing in 2007.  Partnerships and affiliates  InPhonic had established relationships with a range of e-commerce partners to provide wireless activation services. Its partners included high-profile brands such as Radio Shack, Best Buy, Overstock.com, Buy.com and AOL; industry players like Cognigen Networks and Intelisys; and major U.S. carriers Verizon Wireless, Cingular, Sprint, T-Mobile, Alltel and others. InPhonic also ran fulfillment for original equipment manufacturers like the Motorola and LG brands. A deal signed with Disney in April 2006 was the first deal for the company's mobile virtual network enabler (MVNE) division after the company shed its own mobile virtual network operator (MVNO), Liberty Wireless, in 2005. In April 2006, InPhonic finalized a partnership with Amazon.com to become Amazon's first third-party provider of wireless products.

Englewood Station also served passenger trains of the New York, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad (Nickel Plate), which operated over the New York Central via trackage rights. History Englewood Station stood at the intersection of several rail lines: *The New York Central (NYC) and the Rock Island shared trackage from Englewood to the north into LaSalle Street Station. At Englewood, they split: the Rock Island headed southwest, the New York Central east into Indiana. *The Pennsylvania Railroad's (PRR) Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railway crossed the Rock Island at this junction. To the north, its trackage headed into Union Station. The PRR then closely paralleled the NYC for several miles into Indiana. *The Erie Railroad, Monon Railroad, Wabash Railroad, Chicago and Eastern Illinois Railroad, and Chicago and Western Indiana Railroad had a stop at 63rd Street and Wallace Street—west of this station. Nicknamed \\"Little Englewood\\" the platforms and canopies still exist, although the station building is long gone.Little Englewood sign The station itself stood near the corner of 63rd and State Streets. Probably most famous for hosting the two most spectacular streamlined passenger trains, Englewood was the second stop eastbound, and pentultimate such westbound, for both PRR's Broadway Limited and NYC's 20th Century Limited. In fact, both would leave their respective terminals in Chicago, stop to embark passengers at Englewood, and leave the station simultaneously, each racing the other for several miles before they diverged. No less important (although less famous) were the westbound Rockets of the Rock Island which stopped at Englewood. Connections could be made at Englewood between any of the railroads at that intersection. Upon the decline of intercity passenger traffic, and PRR and NYC's merger into Penn Central (and that railroad's bankruptcy and reorganization into Conrail), much of the trackage has been removed, and the commuter trains on the Metra Rock Island District no longer stop at the station, which was closed in the late 1970s. The former tracks of the Pennsylvania are now owned by the Norfolk Southern Railway and still carry freight and intercity Amtrak passengers to Union Station. The station has for the most part disappeared, but some scattered remnants are visible around the railroad overpass near 63rd Street and State Street.

As a painter of portraits, figures, animals and landscapes, he enjoyed a certain prominence during his lifetime, and his paintings are represented in the major American art collections. He is perhaps best known for his 'angel' paintings, some of which use his children as models. During the last third of his life, he worked together with his son, Gerald Handerson Thayer, on a book about protective coloration in nature, titled Concealing-Coloration in the Animal Kingdom. First published by Macmillan in 1909, then reissued in 1918, it may have had an effect on military camouflage during World War I. However it was roundly mocked by Theodore Roosevelt and others for its assumption that all animal coloration is cryptic. Thayer also influenced American art through his efforts as a teacher, training apprentices in his New Hampshire studio. Early life A Virgin (1892–93), painted allusion to Winged Victory of Samothrace Thayer was born in Boston to William Henry Thayer and Ellen Handerson.New Hampshire, Birth Records, 1659–1900 The son of a country doctor, he spent his childhood in rural New Hampshire, near Keene, at the foot of Mount Monadnock. In that rural setting, he became an amateur naturalistAnderson 1982, p. 12. (in his own words, he was \\"bird crazy\\"), a hunter and a trapper. Thayer closely studied Audubon's Birds of America, experimented with taxidermy, and made his first artworks: watercolor paintings of animals. At the age of fifteen he was sent to the Chauncy Hall School in Boston, where he met Henry D. Morse, an amateur artist who painted animals. With guidance from Morse, Abbott developed and improved his painting skills, focusing on depictions of birds and other wildlife, and soon began painting animal portraits on commission. He also taught his sister, Ellen Thayer Fisher, techniques that he was learning. At age 18, he relocated to Brooklyn, New York, to study painting at the Brooklyn Art School and the National Academy of Design. studying under Lemuel Wilmarth. He met many emerging and progressive artists during this period in New York, including his future wife, Kate Bloede and his close friend, Daniel Chester French. He showed work at the newly formed Society of American Artists, and continued refining his skills as an animal and landscape painter. In 1875, after having married Kate Bloede, he moved to Paris, where he studied for four years at the École des Beaux-Arts, with Henri Lehmann and Jean-Léon Gérôme, and where his closest friend became the American artist George de Forest Brush. Returning to New York, he established his own portrait studio (which he shared with Daniel Chester French), became active in the Society of American Painters, and began to take in apprentices. Return to New Hampshire Monadnock in Winter, 1904, oil on canvas Life became all but unbearable for Thayer and his wife during the early 1880s, when two of their small children died unexpectedly, one year apart.Anderson 1982, p. 16. Emotionally devastated, they spent the next several years relocating from place to place. Although he was not yet secure financially, Thayer's growing reputation resulted in more portrait commissions than he could accept.Anderson 1982, p. 19. Among his sitters were George Washington Cable, Mark Twain, and Henry James. He also made numerous portraits of the three remaining Thayer children, Mary, Gerald, and Gladys, and used them as models for symbolic compositions such as Angel (1887) and Virgin Enthroned (1891).Anderson 1982, pp. 60–63. After her father died, Thayer's wife lapsed into an irreversible melancholia, which led to her confinement in an asylum, the decline of her health, and her eventual death on May 3, 1891, from a lung infection. Soon after, Thayer married their long-time friend, Emmeline \\"Emma\\" Buckingham Beach, whose father Moses Yale Beach owned The New York Sun. He and his second wife spent their remaining years in rural New Hampshire, living simply and working productively. In 1901, they settled permanently in Dublin, New Hampshire, where Thayer had grown up. Eccentric and opinionated, Thayer grew more so as he aged, and his family's manner of living reflected his strong beliefs: the Thayers typically slept outdoors year-round in order to enjoy the benefits of fresh air,Anderson 1982, p. 28. and the three children were never enrolled in a school.Anderson 1982, p. 20. The younger two, Gerald and Gladys, shared their father's enthusiasms, and became painters.Anderson 1982, pp. 31–32. In 1898, Thayer visited St Ives, Cornwall and, with an introductory letter from C. Hart Merrian, the Chief of the US Biological Survey in Washington, D.C., applied to the lord of the Manor of St Ives and Treloyhan, Henry Arthur Mornington Wellesley, the 3rd Earl Cowley, for permission to collect specimens of birds from the cliffs at St Ives. During this latter part of his life, among Thayer's neighbors was George de Forest Brush, with whom (when they were not quarreling) he collaborated on camouflage. Artistic achievements Angel, 1887, oil on canvas. Smithsonian American Art Museum The Sisters, 1884, oil on canvas. Brooklyn Museum It is difficult to categorize Thayer simply as an artist. He was often described in first-person accounts as eccentric and mercurial, and there is a parallel contradictory mixture of academic tradition, spontaneity and improvisation in his artistic methods. For example, he is largely known as a painter of \\"ideal figures\\", in which he portrayed women as embodiments of virtue, adorned in flowing white tunics and equipped with feathered angel's wings. At the same time, he did this using methods that were surprisingly unorthodox, such as purposely mixing dirt into the paint, or (in one instance at least, according to Rockwell Kent) using a broom instead of a brush to lessen the sense of rigidity in a newly finished, still-wet painting.Anderson 1982, p. 71. Thayer was largely surrounded by women, be they his family, housekeepers, models or students. Biographer Ross Anderson believed that in his mind \\"feminine virtue and aesthetic grandeur were inextricably linked\\"; Thayer felt that the press and even other artists contributed to the degradation of women by emphasizing their sexuality, rather than exalting their moral attributes.Thayer exclaimed in a letter that patrons unwittingly commissioned fashionable portrait artists, \\"whore-painters\\", who were \\"stone blind to any attribute except fuckableness!\\" Anderson 1982, p. 22. When he began to add wings to his figures in the late 1880s, he was making more obvious the transcendent qualities he saw in the female subject: > Doubtless my lifelong passion for birds has helped to incline me to work > wings into my pictures; but primarily I have put on wings probably more to > symbolize an exalted atmosphere (above the realm of genre painting) where > one need not explain the action of the figures.\\"Anderson 1982, p. 60. Thayer's first use of the theme was the painting Angel. The wings were nailed into a board, in front of which his daughter Mary stood. The poignancy of Thayer's imagery was found wanting by art critic Clarence King, who suggested the use of buckets \\"to catch the dripping sentiment\\", yet other critics like Mariana Van Rensselaer were impressed by the serenity of Thayer's vision, and saw a \\"distinctly modern\\" approach in his traditional compositions.Prelinger 2000, p. 98. He survived with the help of his patrons, among them the industrialist Charles Lang Freer. Some of his finest works are in the collections of the Freer Gallery of Art, Metropolitan Museum of Art, National Academy of Design, Smithsonian American Art Museum, and Art Institute of Chicago. Teaching Thayer was resourceful in his teaching, which he saw as a useful, inseparable part of his own studio work. Among his devoted apprentices were Rockwell Kent, Louis Agassiz Fuertes, Richard Meryman, Barry Faulkner (Thayer's cousin), Alexander and William James (the sons of Harvard philosopher William James), and Thayer's own son and daughter, Gerald and Gladys. He also had a profound influence on Dennis Miller Bunker, who, while not a formal pupil, was invited to paint alongside the older artist in 1886, and wrote \\"Thayer's the first great man I ever knew, and I can't quite get used to it.\\"Hirshler, pp. 42–44. In a letter to Thomas Wilmer Dewing (, in the collection of the Archives of American Art,Archives of American Art Smithsonian Institution), Thayer reveals that his method was to work on a new painting for only three days. If he worked longer on it, he said, he would either accomplish nothing or would ruin it. So on the fourth day, he would instead take a break, getting as far from the work as possible, but meanwhile instruct each student to make an exact copy of that three-day painting. Then, when he did return to his studio, he would (in his words) \\"pounce on a copy and give it a three-day shove again\\".Anderson 1982, p. 27. As a result, he would end up with alternate versions of the same painting, in substantially different finished states. Camouflage contributions :Further information: Concealing-Coloration in the Animal Kingdom A photograph of a countershading study conducted by Thayer. The model on the left is camouflaged and visible whereas another on the right is countershaded and invisible. Thayer is sometimes referred to as the \\"father of camouflage\\".Behrens 1988. While he did not invent camouflage, he was one of the first to write about disruptive patterning to break up an object's outlines, about distractive markings, about masquerade, as when a butterfly mimics a leaf (though here he was anticipated by Bates, Wallace, and Poulton), and especially about countershading. Beginning in 1892, he wrote about the function of countershading in nature, by which forms appear less round and less solid through inverted shading, by which he accounted for the white undersides of animals. This finding is still accepted widely, and is sometimes now called Thayer’s Law. However, he became obsessed with the idea that all animals are camouflaged, spoiling his case by arguing that conspicuous birds like peacocks and flamingoes were in fact cryptically colored. He was vigorously attacked for this in a long paper by Theodore Roosevelt. \\"Thayer straining the theory to a fantastic extreme\\": White Flamingoes, Red Flamingoes and The Skies They Simulate (dawn or dusk), painted by Thayer Thayer first became involved in military camouflage in 1898, during the Spanish–American War, when he and his friend George de Forest Brush proposed the use of protective coloration on American ships, using countershading. The two artists did obtain a patent for their idea in 1902, titled \\"Process of Treating the Outsides of Ships, etc., for Making Them Less Visible\\", in which their method is described as having been modeled on the coloration of a seagull. Thayer and Brush's experiments with camouflage continued into World War I, both collaboratively and separately. Early during that war, for example, Brush developed a transparent airplane, while Thayer continued his interest in disruptive or high-difference camouflage, which was not unlike what British ship camouflage designer Norman Wilkinson would call dazzle camouflage (a term that may have been inspired by Thayer's writings, which referred to disruptive patterns in nature as \\"razzle dazzle\\".) Gradually, Thayer and Brush entrusted their camouflage work to the responsibility of their sons. Concealing-Coloration in the Animal Kingdom (1909), which had taken seven years to prepare, was credited to Thayer's son, Gerald. At about the same time, Thayer once again proposed ship camouflage to the U.S. Navy (and was again unsuccessful), this time working not with Brush, but with Brush's son, Gerome (named in honor of his father's teacher). In 1915, during World War I, Thayer made proposals to the British War Office, trying unsuccessfully to persuade them to adopt a disruptively patterned battledress, in place of monochrome khaki, though he was too anxious to attend the meeting in person. Meanwhile, Thayer and Gerome Brush's proposal for the use of countershading in ship camouflage was approved for use on American ships, and a handful of Thayer enthusiasts (among them Barry Faulkner) recruited hundreds of artists to join the American Camouflage Corps. Later years My Children, –1910. Oil on canvas. Brooklyn Museum Despite rapid changes in the art world in the early 20th century, Thayer's reputation remained strong. Yale University offered him an honorary degree in 1916, and the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh mounted an exhibition of his work in 1919 that included over fifty paintings.Anderson 1982, p. 54. The view from his home of Mt. Monadnock became a favorite subject, and when the area was threatened with development Thayer campaigned successfully for its preservation.Anderson 1982, p. 37. By his own admission, Thayer often suffered from a condition that is now known as bipolar disorder.Behrens 2009. Behrens wrote \\"Thayer outlived World War I, and died in 1921. Impaired by bipolar disorder, or in his words, 'the Abbott pendulum', that swung between the two extremes of ‘allwellity’ and ‘sick disgust’ (Meryman 1999), at the end he had grown suicidal.\\"Meryman 1999. In his letters, he described it as \\"the Abbott pendulum\\", by which his emotions alternated between the two extremes of (in his words) \\"all-wellity\\" and \\"sick disgust\\". This condition apparently worsened as the controversy grew about his camouflage findings, most notably when they were denounced by former U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt. As he aged, he suffered increasingly from panic attacks (which he termed \\"fright- fits\\"), nervous exhaustion, and suicidal thoughts, so much so that he was no longer allowed to go out in his boat alone on Dublin Pond.Behrens 2009. Thayer continued to paint, but was compelled to stop working for weeks at a time due to nervous exhaustion. In an effort to avert suicidal thoughts, he sought help at a sanatorium in Wellesley, Massachusetts. At age 71, Thayer, disabled by a series of strokes, died quietly at home on May 29, 1921. Legacy In October 2008, a documentary film about Thayer's life and work premiered at the Smithsonian American Art Museum. Titled Invisible: Abbott Thayer and the Art of Camouflage, it featured a wide selection of his drawings and paintings, archival photographs, historic documents, and interviews with humorist P. J. O'Rourke, Richard Meryman, Jr. (whose father was Thayer's student), camouflage scholar Roy R. Behrens, Smithsonian curator Richard Murray, Thayer's friends and relatives, and others.

Âli Pasha was widely regarded as a deft and able statesman, and often credited with preventing an early break-up of the empire. Âli Pasha advocated for a western style of reform to modernize the empire, including secularization of the state and improvements to civil liberties. He worked to pacify nationalist movements while at the same time fend off foreign aggressors that were trying to weaken Ottoman control. He advocated for an Ottoman nationalism that would replace diverse ethnic and religious loyalties. From humble origins as the son of a doorkeeper, Âli Pasha rose through the ranks of the Ottoman state and became the Minister of Foreign Affairs for a short time in 1840, and again in 1846. He became Grand Vizier for a few months in 1852, then again Foreign Minister in 1854. Between 1855 and 1871 he alternated between the two jobs, ultimately holding the position of Foreign Minister seven times and Grand Vizier five times in his lifetime. He was awarded the Order of the Red Eagle, 1st Class (for non-Christians) in 1851. Early life Mehmed Emin Âli Pasha was born on March 5, 1815, in Constantinople into a home of modest means. He was born the son of a shopkeeper, with no formal education except three years of primary school. It was in primary school that Ali Pasha learned to read and write in addition to memorizing some suras of the Koran. Nonetheless, Âli Pasha did continue to educate himself, including teaching himself French. He started his lengthy public serve career at the age of 14 as a clerk in the imperial council. The next year Âli Pasha was transferred to the records department of the Imperial Council. Once again Âli Pasha was transferred a year later, this time to the Translation Office. Translation Office Portrait of Mehmed Emin Âli Pasha. The Translation Office (, known in English as the office of the \\"dragoman\\" from the Turkish tercüme, \\"translation\\") was set up in response to Greek independence. This was due to the fact that, prior to Greek independence, many Greeks had acted as translators in government business. Consequently, the Greek uprising for independence resulted in an exodus of the Greek translators working for the government and left a demand for translators. In addition, internal affairs including, the defeat of Ottoman armies at the hand of the Egyptians and the Treaty of Hünkâr İskelesi with the Russians, diplomacy became more important. Such developments not only led to growth within the Translation office, but also to higher scrutiny of the Translation Office and it increased salaries. The job, however, didn't just improve Ali Paha's lot in life; it also impacted his future policies. For instance, Âli Pasha and others in the Translation Office, such as Âli Pasha's future partner in reform, Mehmed Fuad Pasha, got needed experience in the world of diplomacy through the work of translation in that very field. This exposure to the diplomatic realm distanced Mehmed Emin Âli Pasha from the values of traditional Ottoman society while at the same time developed within him the values of a rational bureaucrat. Mustafa Reşid Pasha In 1835 Âli Pasha was appointed second secretary to the Embassy in Vienna, where he studied the organization of the Austrian Empire. A few years later Âli Pasha found himself as counselor to Mustafa Reşid Pasha. Although, Mustafa Reşid Pasha was only ambassador to the Court of Saint James, better known as the royal court of Britain, he would be appointed Grand Vizier in 1839 and began a period of reform in the Ottoman Empire, known as the Tenzimat Reform. Mustafa left Ali Pasha in charge while he headed back to the Ottoman Empire to take his position as Grand Vizier. This development eventually would lead to Âli Pasha being made the official ambassador and he would continue to rise higher and higher in political office. The Crimean War In 1854 during the Crimean War Âli Pasha was recalled from retirement in order to take the portfolio of foreign affairs for a second time under Reshid Pasha and in this capacity took part in 1855 in the conference of Vienna. In 1855 he again became the Grand Vizier for one year, an office he filled no less than five times; in that role he represented the Porte at the Congress of Paris in 1856 and signed the peace treaty that ended the Crimean War. Âli Pasha as an Ambassador Mehmed Emin Âli Pasha (on the far right) at the Congress of Paris (1856) In 1846 Mehmed Emin Âli Pasha was made Minister of Foreign Affairs under Mustafa Pasha which is no surprise given his well honed skill in diplomacy. Sultan Abdülaziz, who often clashed with Âli Pasha over the powers of the Grand Vizier, admitted that he couldn't replace such a man so recognized in Europe. It was during his role as ambassador that Âli Pasha promoted friendship with England and France as well as incorporating western practices into the Ottoman Empire. For example, based on his experience of the education system of France, Âli Pasha laid the foundation of the prestigious Galatasaray High School in its modern form, where children of minority religions would be taught amongst Muslim students. This was done so that people of other religions would cease to see the Turks, as enemies. Âli Pasha's responsibilities and recognition increased further when he was chosen as lead delegate for the peace talks, while being appointed Grand Vizier again in the 1855 Congress of Vienna, following the Crimean war. It was there that he formatted a peace settlement that included the Ottoman Empire into the Concert of Europe, a balance of power among European nations, and that the other powers of the Concert of Europe would respect the territories of the Ottoman Empire and its independence. Subsequently, it was altered somewhat and incorporated into Article seven of the 1856 treaty of Paris. Edict of 1856 Participants of the Congress of Paris, 1856 Although the intervention of England, France, and Sardinia in the Crimean War, in addition to the Treaty of Paris in 1856, saved the Ottoman Empire from Russia, the Ottoman Empire was now facing external pressure from its saviors to treat all their citizens equally regardless of religion. In response, Grand Vizier Âli Pasha formulated the Hatt-i Humayun reform edict of 1856. This promised equality to everyone in front of the law, opened civil offices to all subjects, guaranteed the security of life and property of non- Muslims and promised no one would be forced to change their religion. As a result, there was an increase of Christian missionaries in the Ottoman Empire. This created a concern that Muslims would convert to Christianity and get out of military service. In response to this fear, the Ottoman Empire ended up making a policy that conversion would not be allowed. In short, converts to Christianity could be arrested and punished. The new freedoms also were unpopular with some non-Muslim members of the Ottoman population. Christian subjects, for instance, were angry for being put on the same level as Jews. Âli Pasha versus the opposition Âli Pasha constantly battled the sultan on the powers of the Grand Vezir during his time in office. He not only insisted that the sultan defer to him for ministerial appointments, but also secretaries and even attendants. Âli Pasha was also known to remove those with whom he disagreed politically, such as, the Young Ottomans. The Young Ottomans disagreed vehemently with the Tanzimat reform and saw it as pandering to the demands of Europe at the expense of sharia law. Ali Pasha, on the other hand, wanted the fusion of all subjects by providing equal opportunities in education and public office, with the end result being that Christians no longer would see themselves as oppressed by the Ottoman state, therefore leading to a more stable empire. This idea of fusion of Ottoman citizens was known as Ottomanism and the Young Ottomans didn't share this view, expressing their views through media like newspapers. Although, the opposition tactics of the Young Ottomans were within the boundaries of Istanbul censorship, Âli Pasha nonetheless closed down their newspapers and banished them. Death and legacy Islâhat Fermânı. His close friend and fellow Tanzimat reformer was Fu'ad Pasha, who died in 1869 as the acting foreign minister. Upon his death, Âli Pasha took on the roles of both foreign minister and prime minister (grand vizier). Grieving over the death of Fu'ad Pasha, and with the added stress of enacting reforms by himself, Âli Pasha's health began to deteriorate. He was stricken with tuberculosis and died on 7 September 1871 after three months of illness, at the age of 56. In response to his death, the Young Ottomans returned from exile, hoping to find a government more in line with their ideals. The Tanzimat period was terminated. The new Vezir, Mahmud Nedim Pasha, was an advocate of sultan absolutism, and the only thing he shared at all with the Young Ottomans was the belief of an Islamic character of the Ottoman Empire. In 1910, a political testament of the deceased Âli Pasha was published. The document was written in 1871, just before his death, and was addressed to Sultan Abdülaziz. In it, he recounts his accomplishments such as keeping the Ottoman Empire intact, improving the bureaucracy, dealing with revolts with minor concessions, starting railroad construction and appeasement of European powers. He also mentions some failures on his part, such as the inadequate tax system, and goes on to give the sultan advice for the future. Such advice includes maintaining religious freedom, accepting non-Muslims into the armed forces and civil service, and improving the tax system by employing controlled companies to collect taxes. Although, some doubt exists as to the accuracy or authenticity of this document.

It was developed on the site of the former Belvoir plantation, seat of the prominent Fairfax family for whom Fairfax County was named. It was known as Camp A. A. Humphreys from 1917-1935 and Fort Belvoir afterward. Fort Belvoir is home to a number of significant United States military organizations. With nearly twice as many workers as The Pentagon, Fort Belvoir is the largest employer in Fairfax County. Fort Belvoir comprises three geographically distinct areas: main base, Davison Army Airfield, and Fort Belvoir North.  History  Plantation = The Fort Belvoir site was originally the home of William Fairfax, the cousin and land agent of Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron the proprietor of the Northern Neck, which stood on land now part of the base. William Fairfax purchased the property in 1738 when his cousin arranged for him to be appointed customs agent (tax collector) for the Potomac River, and William erected an elegant brick mansion overlooking the river, moving in with his family in 1740. Lord Fairfax came to America in 1747 and stayed less than a year at the Belvoir estate before moving to Greenway Court. The Fairfax family lived at Belvoir for over 30 years, but eldest son (and heir) George William Fairfax sailed to England on business in 1773, never to return. The manor home was destroyed by fire in 1783. The ruins of the Belvoir Mansion and the nearby Fairfax family grave site are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. = Fort = An infantryman in training at Fort Belvoir (November 1942). The post was founded during World War I as Camp A. A. Humphreys, named for American Civil War Union Army general Andrew A. Humphreys, who was also Chief of Engineers. The post was renamed Fort Belvoir in the 1930s at the request of Howard W. Smith, a Congressman from Virginia, in recognition of the Belvoir plantation that once occupied the site. The adjacent United States Army Corps of Engineers Humphreys Engineer Center retains part of the original name. Camp Humphreys was established in World War I as the U.S. Army Engineers Training School.

S. army bases with names related to the Confederacy, it was proposed that the fort be renamed as well. While not named after a Confederate officer, it was renamed after a slave plantation run by a British loyalist. Representative Howard W. Smith, who requested the renaming, was an old-school Southern Democrat who was sympathetic to the then-popular Dunning school of history that revered the Confederacy, and resented a base in Virginia being named after a Union general (A. A. Humphrey). Thus, the name of the base has been criticized as improperly nostalgic for slavery and the antebellum era.

Biography Cousin of Franco Delli Colli, Antonio (Tonino) Delli Colli was born in Rome, and began work at Rome's Cinecittà studio in 1938, at the age of sixteen. By the mid-1940s he was working as a cinematographer and in 1952 shot the first Italian film in colour, Totò a colori. He went on to work with a number of acclaimed and diverse directors including, Sergio Leone (The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, Once Upon a Time in the West and Once Upon a Time in America), Roman Polanski (Death and the Maiden and Bitter Moon), Louis Malle (Lacombe, Lucien), Jean-Jacques Annaud (The Name of the Rose), and Federico Fellini, whose last three films he photographed. His collaboration with Pier Paolo Pasolini was especially fruitful: they made twelve films together, including Pasolini's debut Accattone (1961), Mamma Roma (1962), The Gospel According to St. Matthew (1964), The Decameron (1971), The Canterbury Tales (1972) and Salò o le 120 giornate di Sodoma (1976). His last film was Roberto Benigni's Life Is Beautiful (1997), for which he won his fourth David di Donatello for Best Cinematography. In 2005 he was awarded the American Society of Cinematographers' International Achievement Award. In August of the same year, he died at home in Rome. Tonino Delli Colli died from a heart attack in 2005 at the age of 81 in Rome, Italy.

Based in Cleveland, Ohio, the label has had a long association with the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra and the Cleveland Orchestra, as well as with the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra. Although it started as a classical music label, Telarc has released jazz, blues and country music recordings. In 1996, Telarc merged with another independent label, Heads Up, now a Telarc subsidiary. In late 2005 both Telarc and Heads Up were bought by Concord Records. Today both labels operate as semi-autonomous units in the Concord Music Group.  The Telarc Sound  Telarc is noted for the high quality of its recordings, encapsulated in the slogan \\"The Telarc Sound\\". Its 1979 high-definition digital recording of Tchaikovsk'y 1812 Overture (the first ever) became a popular way for people to test the quality of their record-playing equipment and audio setups, as only high-quality and properly-tuned systems could play the hifi digital cannon shots properly. The record ultimately became their best-selling ever and established them as a company. Its audio engineers are highly regarded in the recording business and have led Telarc to over 50 Grammy Awards on its own label and two others it distributes, Heads Up and MCG. In 2004 it received the \\"Label of the Year\\" award from Gramophone magazine. Telarc was one of the first labels to record music with a 20-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC) in the late 1980s and has used 24-bit formats since 1996. Currently, the majority of Telarc's releases are (generally hybrid) Super Audio CDs (SACDs) based on Direct Stream Digital (DSD) recordings. Staff reduction In February 2009, due to corporate restructuring at Concord Music Group, Telarc announced it would cut twenty-six jobs and that it would also stop producing its own recordings. These job cuts included the highly regarded, multi-award-winning production team. Telarc's founder and former president Robert Woods resigned in March 2009 and was replaced by Heads Up president Dave Love. Love was subsequently let go the following month. Five/Four Productions was formed by four members of the Telarc production team: Grammy award-winning engineers Michael Bishop and Robert Friedrich, Grammy award-winning producer Thomas Moore, and chief technician Bill McKinney. Keeping the Blues Alive In 2013, the Blues Foundation honored Telarc with its 2013 Keeping the Blues Alive (KBA) Award. Every year the Blues Foundation presents the KBA Awards to individuals and organizations that have made significant contributions to blues music. The KBA ceremony was held in conjunction with the 29th International Blues Challenge (IBC). The KBAs are awarded on the basis of merit by a select panel of blues professionals to those working to actively promote and document the music.

Local Councils are a concept around the lowest political-administrative unit based at the village level. The District: A district is made up of several counties and any municipalities in that area. A district is led by an elected local council V (LCV) chairperson and his executive. There is also an elected LCV Council, with representatives from the sub-counties and technical staff in the district. The council debates budgets, decisions, and bylaws. On the technical side, the district is led by a Chief Administrative Officer (CAO), appointed by the central government. The district also has heads of various departments such as education, health, environment, and planning, which are responsible for relevant matters in the whole district. Currently, Uganda has about 121 districts that have grown from 30 districts in 1986. The County: A county is made up of several sub-counties. Each county is represented at the national level in parliament in Kampala by an elected member of Parliament (an MP). In major towns, the equivalent of a county is a municipality (which is a set of divisions). LCIII executive committee members of all the sub-counties constitute the local council IV (LCIV). They then elect an LCIV executive committee from among themselves. These committees have limited powers, except in municipalities, which they run. The sub-county: The sub-county is made up of a number of parishes and is run by the sub-county chief on the technical side and by an elected local council III (LCIII) chairperson and his/her executive committee, a kind of parliament at that level, complete with a speaker and deputy speaker. The council consists of elected councilors representing the parishes, other government officials involved in health, development and education, and NGO officials in the sub-county. In towns, a sub-county is called a division. The parish: The parish is the next level up from the village. A parish is made up of a number of villages which could range from five to about ten. Each parish has a Local Council II (LCII) Committee, made up of all the chairpersons from the LCIs in the parish. Each LCII will elect, from among themselves, an executive committee. Today, LCIIs are largely involved in settling land disputes and mobilising the community for various activities. The parish is largely run by a parish chief – a government employee who provides technical leadership to the LCII. The village: A village usually consists of between 50 and 70 households and may be home to anywhere between 250 and 1,000 people. Each village will be run by a local council – local council I (LCI) - and is governed by a chairperson (LCI chairperson) and nine other executive committee members . Uganda has not held any Local Council elections since 2001(a period of fifteen years, 2001-2017) The 1995 Constitution of the Republic of Uganda, Article 181(4) states that local government elections will be held after every five years. The Electoral Commission had not been able to hold the LC elections when Uganda was still passing off as a one-party system of governance, because it was challenged in the case of Rtd Rubaramira Ruranga Vs Electoral Commission and another in the Constitutional Petition No. 21 of 2006 as inappropriate in a multi-party dispensation. The delay in holding the election was stated to be due to the high cost involved in holding the election through a secret ballot. Uganda currently has over 60,800 villages, initial budgets indicated that this election would cost over 505bn if it were to be held by secret ballot. Various amendments to section 111 cap 140 of the Local Government Act reduced the cost to 15.9bn through providing for lining behind preferred candidates. The LC1 elections were eventually conducted on the 10th of July 2018 throughout Uganda which was declared a public holiday to allow voters the opportunity to express themselves. This was after 17 years of not holding the local council elections. As stated in the Local Government Act, A chairperson of a lower government council is among other duties; to be the political head at that level, Preside over the council and executive committee meetings, Monitor the general administration of the area under his or her jurisdiction, oversee the performance of persons employed by the Government to provide services in the council’s area of jurisdiction and to monitor the provision of Government services or implementation of projects in the area under the council’s jurisdiction and also to Perform other functions that may be necessary for the better functioning of the council, or which may be incidental to the functions of the chairperson or imposed on the chairperson by any law. There are six levels of Local Councils. The lowest level is the Local Council I (LC 1 or LC I) and is responsible for a village or, in the case of towns or cities, a neighborhood. The area covered by Local Councils II through IV incorporates several of the next lowest levels, while a Local Council V (LC5) is responsible for the entire district. In theory, a problem at a local level is relayed up through the various levels until it reaches an LC with sufficient authority or power to resolve it, while centrally planned directives are relayed downward until they are implemented at the local level. Each Local Council has a certain number of identical positions, such as Chairman, Vice- Chairman, etc. The Local Council does not transfer nationally. Instead, the national government appoints Resident District Commissioners (RDCs) to represent its interests at the district level. https://www.theguardian.com/katine/2009/dec/14/local-government-explainer See also * Uganda Local Governments Association References Category:Government of Uganda ","title":"Local Council (Uganda)"},{"id":"2484503","text":"In computing, \`tee\` is a command in command-line interpreters (shells) using standard streams which reads standard input and writes it to both standard output and one or more files, effectively duplicating its input. It is primarily used in conjunction with pipes and filters. The command is named after the T-splitter used in plumbing. Overview ls -l\` is redirected to tee which copies them to the file file.txt and to the pager \`less\`. The name tee comes from this scheme - it looks like the capital letter T The \`tee\` command is normally used to split the output of a program so that it can be both displayed and saved in a file. The command can be used to capture intermediate output before the data is altered by another command or program. The tee command reads standard input, then writes its content to standard output. It simultaneously copies the data into the specified file(s) or variables. The syntax differs depending on the command's implementation. Implementations The command is available for Unix and Unix-like operating systems, Microware OS-9, DOS (e.g. 4DOS, FreeDOS), Microsoft Windows (e.g. 4NT, Windows PowerShell), and ReactOS. The Linux \`tee\` command was written by Mike Parker, Richard Stallman, and David MacKenzie. The FreeDOS version was developed by Jim Hall and is licensed under the GPL. The command has also been ported to the IBM i operating system. Additionally the \`sponge\` command offers similar capabilities. =Unix and Unix-like= tee [ -a ] [ -i ] [ File ... ] Arguments: *\`File ...\` A list of files, each of which receives the output. Flags: *\`-a\` Appends the output to each file, rather than overwriting it. *\`-i\` Ignores interrupts. The command returns the following exit values (exit status): *0 The standard input was successfully copied to all output files. *>0 An error occurred. Using process substitution lets more than one process read the standard output of the originating process. Read this example from GNU Coreutils, tee invocation. Note: If a write to any successfully opened File operand is not successful, writes to other successfully opened File operands and standard output will continue, but the exit value will be >0. =4DOS and 4NT= TEE [/A] file... Arguments: *\`file\` One or more files that will receive the \\"tee'd\\" output. Flags: *\`/A\` Append the pipeline content to the output file(s) rather than overwriting them. Note: When tee is used with a pipe, the output of the previous command is written to a temporary file. When that command finishes, tee reads the temporary file, displays the output, and writes it to the file(s) given as command-line argument. =Windows PowerShell= tee [-FilePath] [-InputObject ] tee -Variable [-InputObject ] Arguments: *\`-InputObject \` Specifies the object input to the cmdlet. The parameter accepts variables that contain the objects and commands or expression that return the objects. *\`-FilePath \` Specifies the file where the cmdlet stores the object. The parameter accepts wildcard characters that resolve to a single file. *\`-Variable \` A reference to the input objects will be assigned to the specified variable. Note: tee is implemented as a \`ReadOnly\` command alias. The internal cmdlet name is \`Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility\\\\Tee-Object\`. ExamplesUnix and Unix- like= * To view and save the output from a command (lint) at the same time: lint program.c  tee program.lint This displays the standard output of the command \`lint program.c\` at the computer, and at the same time saves a copy of it in the file \`program.lint\`. If a file named \`program.lint\` already exists, it is deleted and replaced. Similarly, both the stdout and stderr output streams can be redirected to standard output and the \`program.lint\` using stream redirection: lint program.c 2>&1  tee program.lint * To view and append the output from a command to an existing file: lint program.c  tee -a program.lint This displays the standard output of the \`lint program.c\` command at the computer and at the same time appends a copy of it to the end of the \`program.lint\` file. If the \`program.lint\` file does not exist, it is created. * To allow escalation of permissions: cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub  ssh admin@server \\"sudo tee -a /root/.ssh/authorized_keys2 > /dev/null\\" This example shows tee being used to bypass an inherent limitation in the sudo command. sudo is unable to pipe the standard output to a file. By dumping its stdout stream into \`/dev/null\`, we also suppress the mirrored output in the console. The command above gives the current user root access to a server over ssh, by installing the user's public key to the server's key authorization list. In Bash, the output can be filtered before being written to the file—without affecting the output displayed—by using process substitution. For example, ls --color=always  tee >(sed \\"s/\\\\x1b[^m]*m//g\\" > ls.txt) removes common ANSI escape codes before writing to \`ls.txt\`, but retains them for display. =4DOS and 4NT= This example searches the file \`wikipedia.txt\` for any lines containing the string \\"4DOS\\", makes a copy of the matching lines in \`4DOS.txt\`, sorts the lines, and writes them to the output file \`4DOSsorted.txt\`: find \\"4DOS\\" wikipedia.txt  tee 4DOS.txt  sort > 4DOSsorted.txt =Windows PowerShell= * To view and save the output from a command at the same time: ipconfig  tee OutputFile.txt This displays the standard output of the command \`ipconfig\` at the console window, and simultaneously saves a copy of it in the file \`OutputFile.txt\`. * To display and save all running processes, filtered so that only programs starting with svc and owning more than 1000 handles are output: Get-Process  Where-Object { $_.Name -like \\"svc*\\" }  Tee-Object ABC.txt  Where-Object { $_.Handles -gt 1000 } This example shows that the piped input for tee can be filtered and that tee is used to display that output, which is filtered again so that only processes owning more than 1000 handles are displayed, and writes the unfiltered output to the file \`ABC.txt\`.

Vehicles such as pickup trucks, flat bed trucks, vans, off-road vehicles, trailers and others can easily be fitted with a proper size skid unit for a variety of fire fighting operations. There is virtually no limit to size or performance capabilities. Fire operations can include rural field operations, forest fires, brush fires and other situations in which a small, highly mobile vehicle is necessary to reach the location of the fire ground operations in rough or otherwise inaccessible terrain. Skid units in their simplest form consist of a tank, pump and hose mounted on a self-contained platform. Most skid units are designed to fit in the bed area of a standard pickup truck. Skid units can be configured to hold as little as to over of water. For specialized applications, foam cells of various capacities can be included as well as foam injection systems integrated to deliver Class \\"A\\" and / or \\"B\\" foam concentrates. Twin Agent skid mounted units are also used in high hazard class B areas in industrial sites. The compact and self-contained design makes a skid unit a very versatile and cost effective tool which fire departments, the forest service, parks and private corporations can utilize for fire suppression. The latest evolution for skid units utilized for public safety in the past few years has seen them become more compact in size so they will fit onto the relatively small cargo bed area of an ATV/UTV off-road vehicle. These vehicles like the Polaris Ranger 4x4 or 6x6 chassis, along with the Kawasaki Mule 4x4, the Kubota RTV 900 and many other makes and models are gaining popularity among fire dept and ambulance services across the country. These smaller off-road vehicles can get into places where much larger fire and ambulance apparatus cannot. Also, the ATV/UTV vehicles can maneuver over much rougher terrain. There are now fire skid units made specifically for these vehicles. There is also a number of fire/rescue skid units allowing double duty of fighting fires and allowing rescuers to place a medical victim onto the unit for transport out of the woods. Another skid unit, the medical skid unit is specifically targeted to be placed into the cargo bed of ATV/UTV vehicles which are completely focused on providing medical transport, like a mini-ambulance, into the back country or woods for victim retrievals. These medical bed units can carry a trained medical attendant to be with the patient at all times, a full complement of medical gear in an enclosed storage area and other fixtures like 02 holders and IV poles to hold IV bags up above the patient. Skid units can also comprise self-contained pieces of machinery incorporated in others. Examples of this might be agricultural tractors without wheels incorporated in harvesting machinery, or compressors on frames installed in oil rigs.

First flight on 14 April 2010 A prime difference between the Hermes 450 and Watchkeeper is that the 450 is fitted only with an electro-optical/infrared sensor, while the WK450 has in addition a dual-mode synthetic aperture radar and ground moving target indication system that allows it to see through all weather conditions.British Army praises performance of Watchkeeper during debut deployment - Flightglobal.com, 17 November 2014 The British Army will receive 30 Watchkeepers and a further 24 due to go into store to be deployed as needed.http://www.defensenews.com/article/20140618/DEFREG01/306180015/UK-s- Watchkeeper-Fleet-Completed-by-End-Year?odyssey=nav%7Chead Currently, the 47th Regiment Royal Artillery is the only unit operating the Watchkeeper. History On 15 July 2007, the UK MoD revealed that 54 Watchkeepers will be delivered to the British Army. The average cost to the taxpayer is therefore £800m divided by 54 aircraft, approximately £15m per platform. However, this figure includes construction of new basing facilities at Boscombe Down airfield, ground training facilities and simulators at the School of Artillery, ground control stations, development and testing of extensive aircraft modifications including automatic take-off and landing and the integration and provision of new sensors including radars. Watchkeeper's first UK flight took place on Wednesday 14 April 2010 from ParcAberporth in Wales, but due to numerous delays the delivery date slipped. By 2014 Watchkeeper had gained certification from the Military Aviation Authority, had its Release to Service granted was cleared for military flight training with the Royal Artillery, operating out of Boscombe Down in Wiltshire.

In June 2018 a Watchkeeper crashed on land near the trials base at West Wales Airport, increasing the number of Watchkeepers lost in crashes to five. Costs of the programme to March 2018 were £1.08 billion, more than £200 million above the original budget. The original order was for 54 Watchkeepers, though it has not been confirmed that more than 45 had been delivered at that date. Watchkeeper was declared fully operational capability (FOC) on 30 November 2018, though without achieving formal release to service (RTS) certification.

The forum court will have already decided that it has jurisdiction to hear the case (resolving any issue relating to forum shopping) and will be working through the next two stages of the conflict process, namely: characterisation and choice of law. For example, the court may classify the cause as \\"succession\\", but it notes that the plaintiff brings the claim for relief as the deceased's widow. Before the court can adjudicate on the main issue, it must first decide whether the plaintiff actually has the status claimed, i.e. the incidental question would be the validity of the claimed marriage. The inconvenient reality is that many lawsuits involve a number of interdependent legal issues. In purely domestic cases, this poses no difficulty because a judge will freely move from one domestic law to another to resolve the dispute. But in a conflict case, the question is whether the incidental question is resolved by reference either to its own choice of law rules, or to the same law that governs the main issue (the lex causae). States have not formulated a consistent answer to this question. For an incidental question to arise, the forum court must have applied its characterisation rules to determine that: *the main cause of action is governed by a foreign law; *as a precondition to the main cause of action, there is a subsidiary question which has its own choice of law rule pointing to a different lex causae; *there will be a different result depending on which foreign law is applied. Suppose that a French court hears the case of an American national who dies domiciled in California leaving movables in England. The French choice of law rule would refer the distribution of personal property to California law which has community property provisions entitling his widow to share in his estate. The marriage was in England and, as both the lex loci celebrationis and the lex situs, English law declares it valid even though it is void ab initio under California law because it is considered bigamous (see nullity): a divorce decree granted by the Arcadian courts was recognised as valid in England, but not in California. Should the widow's claim be determined by the English or California law? There are different views: *the widow's claim should be dismissed because otherwise the French conflict rule that succession to movables is governed by California law would be undermined; *the widow should be entitled to share in her husband's estate because otherwise the French conflict rule that the validity of the marriage is governed by English law would be undermined. One of the more interesting cases on this topic is the Canadian Supreme Court case of Schwebel v Ungar [1964] 48 DLR (2d) 644 in which a Jewish husband and wife, domiciled in Hungary, married in Hungary. While they were emigrating to Israel, they found themselves in Italy and the husband divorced his wife by get. Under the laws of Hungary (their lex domicilii) and Italy, the religious form of divorce was invalid, but it was recognised as effective by the law of Israel where they acquired a domicile of choice. Subsequently, the wife moved to Canada and, without abandoning her Israeli domicile, went through a second ceremony of marriage. The second husband petitioned for nullity alleging that the marriage was bigamous. The Supreme Court held the marriage to be valid. The main question was the wife's capacity to marry which, under Canadian law, is determined by her lex domicilii, i.e. the law of Israel at the time of the second ceremony. The incidental question was the validity of the divorce which was to be determined either by their lex domicilii at the relevant time or by Italian law as the lex loci actus. The judgment seems to suggest that the court decided both questions by reference to the law of Israel as the law governing the main question. In Lawrence v Lawrence [1985] Fam 106 the English Court of Appeal was asked by the second husband to rule on the validity of another potentially bigamous marriage. The wife first married in Brazil and then divorced the husband in Nevada (this was not recognised in Brazil) and immediately married the second husband in Nevada. The two laws were the wife's lex domicilii to which English choice of law rules referred her capacity to marry (under Brazilian law she lacked capacity to marry the second husband) and the validity of the second marriage which was determined under the lex loci celebrationis. The case was decided by characterising the case as one of divorce recognition rather than capacity to marry. The outcome suggests that the same law will be applied to both the main and the incidental questions on the understanding that the forum court is probably making a policy decision on which outcome is the more desirablein both cases, the courts seem to have been interested in upholding the validity of the second marriage reflecting a rebuttable presumption in both jurisdictions to recognise marriages valid under their lex loci celebrationis in default of any strong policy reason to the contrary.

While posing as an addict, he is approached by Boyd Aviation executive vice president Alan Stanwyk, who assumes Fletch is a real junkie. Stanwyk claims to have bone cancer, with only months left to live, and wishes to avoid the suffering. Stanwyk offers $50,000 for Fletch to kill him at his mansion in a few days' time, stage the scene as a burglary, then flee to Rio de Janeiro. Fletch, not completely convinced on the truth of Stanwyk's story, agrees to the plan. Along with his colleague Larry, he begins investigating Stanwyk instead of completing his drug exposé, much to the anger of his authoritarian editor Frank Walker. Disguised as a doctor, Fletch accesses Stanwyk's file at the hospital and learns he does not have cancer. Fletch visits Stanwyk's wife Gail at her tennis club. Pretending to be a tennis instructor and Alan's friend, he flirts with her during a tennis lesson. Looking into Stanwyk's finances, Fletch finds that Gail recently converted $3 million of her personal stock in Boyd Aviation into cash for her husband, to buy a ranch in Provo, Utah. Fletch breaks into the realtor's office and discovers the sale price was only $3,000. Meanwhile, LAPD Chief Jerry Karlin learns of Fletch's drug report. He warns Fletch that the article will jeopardize his undercover operation on the beach. Karlin threatens to kill Fletch unless he agrees to drop the investigation. At the tennis club, Fletch witnesses arrogant club member Mr. Underhill, shouting at a waiter and decides as revenge to use Underhill's tab to treat Gail to an expensive lunch in her private cabana. Fletch reveals Alan's murder scheme to her and tells her the true price of the ranch. Fletch watches Stanwyk making a suspicious briefcase exchange with Chief Karlin, but is unable to deduce the nature of their meeting. When he is chased by LAPD officers lying in wait at his apartment, Fletch goes into hiding, returning to Provo. Posing as an insurance investigator, he interviews Stanwyk's parents, learning that Stanwyk has been married to another woman for eight years; his bigamous marriage to Gail allowed him access to her vast wealth. Fletch arrives at Stanwyk's mansion on the night of the planned murder, but finds Stanwyk waiting to kill him instead. Fletch reveals his discovery of Stanwyk's real plan to fake his own death by killing Fletch and burning his body beyond recognition, then escape to Brazil with his first wife and Gail's $3 million. Stanwyk was also using his private jet to smuggle drugs from South America to supply Chief Karlin, who blackmailed ex-convicts Fat Sam and Gummy to distribute it on the beaches. Karlin arrives unexpectedly; learning of Stanwyk's intention to flee with nearly $1 million of the Chief's drug money, he kills Stanwyk. Karlin and Fletch fight over the gun until Gail strikes Karlin from behind, rendering him unconscious. Karlin is indicted after Fletch's article, with testimony from Fat Sam and Gummy. Fletch begins dating Gail, taking her to Rio on Stanwyk's tickets and using Underhill's tab.

ProductionDevelopment= Following the publication of Gregory Mcdonald's Fletch in 1974, King-Hitzig Productions acquired the novel's film rights. After multiple attempts to get cameras rolling at Columbia Pictures, production on the film stalled and the rights were eventually acquired by producer Jonathan Burrows in 1976. After Columbia Pictures passed on the film, Burrows shopped the film around at every studio in Hollywood. Trying a new tactic, Burrows submitted the script with a different title and put it in a different colored binder. Despite these efforts, there were still no takers – even Universal Studios, the company who would eventually go on to produce and distribute it. Burrows credits Michael Douglas (who much earlier was considered for the lead) for having the foresight and wherewithal to get the film made. When Mcdonald's Fletch books were optioned, the author retained the right to veto casting choices. He rejected both Burt Reynolds and Mick Jagger as Fletch. When the studio mentioned Chevy Chase as Fletch, Mcdonald agreed, although he had never seen Chase perform. Throughout the early stages of development, Jeff Bridges, Charles Grodin and Barry Bostwick were among those considered to play Fletch. George Segal was at one point considered but turned it down. Burrows also wanted Richard Dreyfuss, after Chase initially rejected the part. Years later, Chase told Burrows that he never knew about the original offer and that it was his then manager who rejected it. In a 2004 interview with Entertainment Weekly, Chase confirmed this was his favorite and most successful part. Chase didn't officially agree to take the role until after producer Alan Greisman and screenwriter Andrew Bergman got involved. Mcdonald sent Chase a telegram saying, \\"I am delighted to abdicate the role of Fletch to you.\\" Bergman remembers that he wrote the screenplay very fast. \\"I did the first draft in four weeks ... Then there was a certain amount of improv, and something that we used to call dial-a-joke,\\" said Bergman. Phil Alden Robinson also did some uncredited work on the script.London, Michael. 'Rhinestone' Controversy: The Rocky Road to A Hollywood Flop 'Rhinestone' Tiff. Los Angeles Times. July 20, 1984 Mcdonald read the script and was angered by the deviations from his original text. He wrote to the studio and listed his many objections. Director Ritchie invited Mcdonald to the set of the film, and took him out to dinner where, according to Mcdonald, \\"Point by point, he showed me where I was wrong. I was beautifully chewed out.\\" =Filming= Principal photography for Fletch began in May 1984.London, Michael. Film Clips: Studios Eye Openings for June Stampede, Los Angeles Times. May 28, 1984. Parts of the film were shot in Salt Lake City International Airport, Provo and Orem, Utah. According to actor Tim Matheson, Fletch was Chase's first film performance after cleaning up his drug problem. However, the studio hired director Michael Ritchie to keep Chase in check. During principal photography, Ritchie would do one take sticking close to the script and then another take allowing Chase to ad-lib. Chase enjoyed the role, because it allowed him to play a wide variety of different characters. He said in an interview, \\"I love props, like wigs and buck-teeth and glasses. At one point I wear an Afro and play basketball with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. There were some scenes where I didn't recognize myself.\\" The comedian enjoyed working with director Ritchie, because he gave him the freedom to improvise: \\"It all began when [costar] Tim Matheson asked me what my name was. Right away, with a straight face: 'Ted Nugent'.\\" Chase recalls Ritchie as \\"Very intelligent. Very Tall (6'7\\"?) Trusting; allowing me so much freedom. Fine filmmaker!\\" =Post-production= \\"Chevy was very hot,\\" recalled Bergman. \\"And the great thing was that Universal always thought Fletch was a hit movie, and they treated it like a hit, even when the first previews weren't that good. They never got frightened. They just said this is a hit, they were selling it like a hit, and then it was a hit. That was a very fun project.\\" The narration was added during post-production.

Release and reception Fletch was released on May 31, 1985, in 1,225 theaters, debuting at second place behind Rambo: First Blood Part II with a gross of $7 million. It went on to make $50.6 million in North America and $9 million in the rest of the world for a worldwide total of $59.6 million. The film performed well on home video, earning $24.4 million in rentals. Fletch received generally positive reviews and has a 77% rating on Rotten Tomatoes from 30 critics with the consensus: \\"Quotably funny – and fast-paced enough to smooth over the jokes that don't land – Fletch is one of the best big-screen vehicles for Chevy Chase's brand of smug silliness\\".https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/fletch/ Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote, \\"The problem is, Chase's performance tends to reduce all the scenes to the same level, at least as far as he is concerned. He projects such an inflexible mask of cool detachment, of ironic running commentary, that we're prevented from identifying with him ... Fletch needed an actor more interested in playing the character than in playing himself.\\" Vincent Canby in his review for The New York Times praised Chase's performance, writing, \\"He manages simultaneously to act the material with a good deal of nonchalance and to float above it, as if he wanted us to know that he knows that the whole enterprise is somewhat less than transcendental.\\" Time magazine's Richard Schickel wrote, \\"In Fletch, the quick, smartly paced, gags somehow read as signs of vulnerability. Incidentally, they add greatly to the movie's suspense. Every minute you expect the hero's loose lip to be turned into a fat one.\\" In his review for the Chicago Reader, Dave Kehr wrote, \\"Chase and Ritchie make a strong, natural combination: the union of their two flip, sarcastic personalities produces a fairly definitive example of the comic style of the 80s, grounded in detachment, underreaction, and cool contempt for rhetorically overblown authority figures.\\" =Home media= Fletch was originally released on DVD in 1998, but that release quickly went out of print. Universal Home Video re- released a special edition of Fletch — the \\"Jane Doe\\" Edition on May 1, 2007. The film is presented in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen, along with an English Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround track and includes the retrospective featurettes, \\"Just Charge It to the Underhills: Making and Remembering Fletch,\\" \\"From John Coctoastan To Harry S. Truman: The Disguises\\" and \\"Favorite Fletch Moments.\\" IGN felt that this version was a decent replacement for anyone who still owned the film on VHS but for \\"anyone seeking more than that will be sadly disappointed by the ill-executed extras and slap-dash sound upgrade.\\" Additionally, the film was also the next-to-last to be released by Universal on the HD DVD format, March 11, 2008, and later released on Blu-ray disc on June 2, 2009. Legacy Fletch became a cult film. In an interview for the New York Post, Bergman tried to explain its appeal: \\"It's so bizarre, but Fletch strikes a chord. There's a group of movies like that in the '80s, like Caddyshack, too, that captured a certain wise-ass thing.\\" In particular, the film appeals to college students who have asked Chase to talk about it at film classes. The actor has said that the appeal of the character is \\"the cheekiness of the guy ... everybody at that age would like to be as quick- witted as Fletch, and as uncaring about what others think.\\" Chase has said that this film is his favorite to date because \\"it allowed me to be myself. Fletch was the first one with me really winging it. Even though there was a script, the director allowed me to just go, and in many ways, I was directing the comedy.\\" Perhaps the most meaningful praise comes from Mcdonald himself: \\"I watched it recently, and I think Chevy and Michael Ritchie did a good job with it.\\" The film was voted as the 23rd best film set in Los Angeles in the last 25 years by a group of Los Angeles Times writers and editors with two criteria: \\"The movie had to communicate some inherent truth about the L.A. experience, and only one film per director was allowed on the list.\\" The 2005 animated feature Hoodwinked! depicted the Big Bad Wolf (from Little Red Riding Hood) as a sarcastic investigative reporter in a direct parody of Fletch, right up to the Lakers shirt, disguises, and a version of Fletch's theme playing during his scenes. Sequel and reboot The film was followed by a 1989 sequel, Fletch Lives. A follow-up to Fletch Lives had been discussed in the 1990s at Universal Studios. During his association with Universal after the production of Mallrats (this was because Gramercy Pictures, which released Mallrats, was co-owned by Universal), Kevin Smith expressed interest in doing a third \\"Fletch\\" film as a sequel starring Chevy Chase but it never came to fruition. In June 2000, it was announced that Kevin Smith was set to write and direct a Fletch film at Miramax Films, after the rights to the books, which Universal Studios had owned, reverted. At the time, Miramax co-head Harvey Weinstein expressed the hope that a new Fletch series would be \\"Miramax Films' first-ever series.\\" After a disagreement between Chase and Smith in regard to differing levels of priority for the sequel project, Smith settled on adapting Fletch Won, which follows Fletch in his early years as newspaper junior reporter. Smith intended to follow the novel's plot and characters much more closely than earlier Fletch films had. Filming the prequel/origin story would have allowed Smith to make the movie without Chase while still leaving the door open for him to appear in a cameo role in framing scenes and/or as narrator. Around this time, Smith mentioned Jason Lee and Ben Affleck as possible choices to play Fletch. In August 2003, it was reported that the film was set to start shooting in January, with Smith still at the helm. Though Smith insisted on casting Lee in the lead role, Miramax head Harvey Weinstein refused to take a chance on Lee, citing the general inability of his films to gross more than $30 million at the box office. The role of Fletch remained uncast, with Smith considering a list of actors including Affleck, Brad Pitt, and Jimmy Fallon. Though Smith considered compromising and casting Zach Braff in the role, he eventually left the project in October 2005. Smith was replaced as writer/director by Scrubs creator Bill Lawrence, in what would have been his directorial debut. He had enthused, \\"Not only can I recite the original Fletch movie line for line, I actually read all the Greg Mcdonald books as a kid. Consider me obsessed — I'm going to try as hard as I can not to screw this up.\\" Lawrence was signed to direct both Fletch Won and a sequel. Scrubs star Zach Braff was rumored to be in talks for the lead role, and in January 2007, Braff posted on his web site that \\"Bill Lawrence is writing and directing Fletch in the spring and he wants me to play young Fletch, but no firm plans are in place yet. He is still writing the script.\\" In April 2007, Braff announced that he had dropped out of the film to work on his own film, a remake of Open Hearts. In June 2007, it was announced that Lawrence was off the project and had been replaced by Steve Pink. In 2011, rights to the project were purchased by Warner Brothers, who requested screenplays from several writers that turned out to be unsuitable. In 2013, David List, who represents the Mcdonald estate, stepped in with his own draft which proved attractive enough to engage Jason Sudeikis in the title role. The studio signed off on the screenplay, described as more of a \\"gritty action comedy with heart\\", and has begun looking for a director. In April 2015, the purposed film moved to Relativity Studios after Warner Bros. passed on the idea. However, Relativity Media went bankrupt later that year and again in 2018. In July 2020, it was announced that the a reboot is back on at Miramax. Actor Jon Hamm is spearheading the project as both star and producer, with Greg Mottola set to direct. Zev Borow is writing the film, which will be based on the second book in the Fletch series, Confess, Fletch.

Piping yes to a command with many user-confirmation prompts will automatically answer all of those prompts with \\"yes\\" (typing 'y' and pressing return). The following commands $ yes  sudo apt install foobar will answer the prompts for confirmation with y, effectively installing foobar with sudo apt without any prompts. This usage may be obsolete today, as most commands that would request response from the user have either a 'force' option (e.g., \`rm -f\`) or an 'assume-yes' option (for example,\`apt -y\`). As an example, the following: $ rm -f *.txt is functionally equivalent to $ yes  rm *.txt The \`yes\` command in conjunction with the head command can be used to generate large volume files for means of testing. For example, executing $ yes 1234567  head -1000 > file results in a file consisting of 1000 lines each consisting of eight characters (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and newline). \`yes\` can be used as an easy way of generating CPU load, for example in 2006, the \`yes\` command received publicity for being a means to test whether or not a user's MacBook is affected by the \\"Intermittent Shutdown Syndrome\\" bug, where a MacBook would randomly shut off without any user input. By running the \`yes\` command indefinitely twice via Terminal under Mac OS X, users were able to max out their computer's CPU, and thus see if the failure was heat related.  Implementation and performance  \`yes\` has been implemented with small differences between operating systems and different OS implementations perform different ranging from some MiB/s to dozens of GiB/s.https://matthias- endler.de/2017/yes/ ReferencesFurther reading * External links *Manpage for \`yes\` (GNU version) *GNU coreutils yes.c implementation *FreeBSD yes.c implementation *NetBSD yes.c implementation *OpenBSD yes.c implementation Category:Unix software ","title":"Yes (Unix)"},{"id":"2484577","text":"thumb The Schottky effect or field enhanced thermionic emission is a phenomenon in condensed matter physics named after Walter H. Schottky. In electron emission devices, especially electron guns, the thermionic electron emitter will be biased negative relative to its surroundings. This creates an electric field of magnitude F at the emitter surface. Without the field, the surface barrier seen by an escaping Fermi-level electron has height W equal to the local work-function. The electric field lowers the surface barrier by an amount ΔW, and increases the emission current. It can be modeled by a simple modification of the Richardson equation, by replacing W by (W − ΔW). This gives the equation :J (F,T,W) = A_{\\\\mathrm{G}} T^2 e^{ - (W - \\\\Delta W) \\\\over k T} :\\\\Delta W = \\\\sqrt{{q_e}^3 F \\\\over 4\\\\pi \\\\epsilon_0}, where J is the emission current density, T is the temperature of the metal, W is the work function of the metal, k is the Boltzmann constant, qe is the Elementary charge, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, and AG is the product of a universal constant A0 multiplied by a material-specific correction factor λR which is typically of order 0.5. Electron emission that takes place in the field-and- temperature-regime where this modified equation applies is often called Schottky emission. This equation is relatively accurate for electric field strengths lower than about 108 V m−1. For electric field strengths higher than 108 V m−1, so-called Fowler–Nordheim (FN) tunneling begins to contribute significant emission current. In this regime, the combined effects of field- enhanced thermionic and field emission can be modeled by the Murphy–Good equation for thermo-field (T-F) emission. At even higher fields, FN tunneling becomes the dominant electron emission mechanism, and the emitter operates in the so-called \\"cold field electron emission (CFE)\\" regime. Thermionic emission can also be enhanced by interaction with other forms of excitation such as light. For example, excited Cs-vapours in thermionic converters form clusters of Cs-Rydberg matter which yield a decrease of collector emitting work function from 1.5 eV to 1.0–0.7 eV. Due to long-lived nature of Rydberg matter this low work function remains low which essentially increases the low- temperature converter’s efficiency.

Fast atom bombardment (FAB) is an ionization technique used in mass spectrometry in which a beam of high energy atoms strikes a surface to create ions. It was developed by Michael Barber at the University of Manchester in 1980. When a beam of high energy ions is used instead of atoms (as in secondary ion mass spectrometry), the method is known as liquid secondary ion mass spectrometry (LSIMS). In FAB and LSIMS, the material to be analyzed is mixed with a non- volatile chemical protection environment, called a matrix, and is bombarded under vacuum with a high energy (4000 to 10,000 electron volts) beam of atoms. The atoms are typically from an inert gas such as argon or xenon. Common matrices include glycerol, thioglycerol, 3-nitrobenzyl alcohol (3-NBA), 18-crown-6 ether, 2-nitrophenyloctyl ether, sulfolane, diethanolamine, and triethanolamine. This technique is similar to secondary ion mass spectrometry and plasma desorption mass spectrometry.  Ionization mechanism  Schematic of the fast atom bombardment process. FAB is a relatively low fragmentation (soft) ionization technique and produces primarily intact protonated molecules denoted as [M + H]+ and deprotonated molecules such as [M - H]−. Radical cations can also be observed in a FAB spectrum in rare cases. FAB was designed as an improved version of SIMS that allowed for the primary beam to no longer cause damaging effects to the sample. The major difference between the two techniques is the difference in the nature of the primary beam used; ions vs atoms. For LSIMS, Cesium, Cs+ ions make up the primary beam and for FAB the primary beam is made up of Xe or Ar atoms. Xe atoms are used because they tend to be more sensitive than Argon atoms due to their larger masses and more momentum. For the molecules to be ionized by FAB, first the slow moving atoms (Xe or Ar) are ionized by colliding electrons. Those slow moving atoms are then ionized and accelerated to a certain potential where they develop into fast moving ions that become neutral in a dense cloud of excess natural gas atoms that make a flowing stream of high translational energy atoms. Although the exact mechanism of how the samples are ionized have not been fully discovered, the nature of its ionization mechanism is similar to matrix- assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) and chemical ionization.  Matrices and sample introduction  As previously stated, in FAB the samples are mixed with a non-volatile environment (matrix) in order to be analyzed. FAB uses a liquid matrix that is mixed with the sample in order to provide a sample ion current that is sustained, reduces damages made to the sample by absorbing the impact of the primary beam, and keeps the sample molecules form aggregating. The liquid matrix, like any other matrix, most importantly provides a medium that promotes sample ionization. The most widely accepted matrix for this type of ionization is glycerol. Choosing the appropriate matrix for the sample is crucial because the matrix can also influence the degree of fragmentation of the sample (analyte) ions. The sample can then be introduced to FAB analysis. The normal method of introducing the sample-matrix mixture is through an insertion probe. The sample-matrix mixture is loaded on a stainless steel sample target on the probe, which is then placed in the ion source via a vacuum lock. The alternative method of introducing the sample is by using a device called continuous flow fast atom bombardment (CF)-FAB.  Continuous flow fast atom bombardment  In continuous flow fast atom bombardment (CF-FAB), the sample is introduced into the mass spectrometer insertion probe through a small diameter capillary. (CF)-FAB was developed to minimize the problem of poor detection sensitivity that is caused by an excess of the matrix background that results in a high matrix-to-sample ratio. When a metal frit is used to disperse the liquid on the probe, the technique is known as frit FAB. Samples can be introduced by flow injection, microdialysis, or by coupling with liquid chromatography. Flow rates are typically between 1 and 20 μL/min. CF-FAB has a higher sensitivity compared to static FAB  Applications  ThermoQuest AvantGarde MS with quadrupole detector and FAB/EI source. The first example of the practical application of this FAB was the elucidation of the amino acid sequence of the oligopeptide efrapeptin D. This contained a variety of very unusual amino acid residues.Bullough,D.A., Jackson C.G.,Henderson, P.J.F., Cottee, F.H.,Beechey,R.B. and Linnett, P.E. Biochemistry International (1981) 4, 543-549 The sequence was shown to be: N-acetyl-L-pip-AIB-L-pip-AIB-AIB-L-leu-beta-ala-gly-AIB-AIB-L-pip-AIB-gly-L- leu-L-iva-AIB-X. PIP = pipecolic acid, AIB = alpha-amino-isobutyric acid, leu = leucine, iva = isovaline, gly = glycine. This is a potent inhibitor of mitochondrial ATPase activity. Another application of FAB includes its original use for the analysis of condensed-phase samples. FAB can be use for measurements of the molecular weight of samples below 5000 Da, as well as their structural characteristics. FAB can be paired with various mass spectrometers for data analysis, such as with a quadrupole mass analyzer, liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry, and more.  Inorganic analysis  In 1983 a paper was published describing the use of fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry (FAB-MS) to analyze isotopes of calcium. Glycerol was not used; samples in aqueous solution were deposited on the sample target and dried prior to analysis. The technique was effectively secondary ion mass spectrometry using a neutral primary beam. This was a welcomed development for biomedical researchers studying the nutrition and metabolism of essential minerals but lacking access to inorganic mass spectrometry instrumentation such as thermal ionization mass spectrometry or inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). In contrast, FAB mass spectrometers were widely found in biomedical research institutions. Multiple laboratories adopted this technique, using FAB-MS to measure isotope ratios in isotope tracer studies of calcium, iron, magnesium and zinc. The analysis of metals required minimal modification of the mass spectrometers, e.g.replacing the stainless steel sample targets with pure silver ones to eliminate background from ionization of stainless steel components. Signal acquisition systems were sometimes modified to perform peak jumping instead of scanning and to do ion counting detection. While satisfactory precision and accuracy were attained with FAB- MS, the technique was labor-intensive with a very low sample through-put rate due in part to the absence of auto-sampling options. By the early 2000's this severe sampling rate limitation had motivated users of FAB-MS for mineral isotope analysis to switch to conventional inorganic mass spectrometers, usually ICP-MS which also exhibited improved affordability and isotope ratio analysis performance by that time.

Biography Twigg-Smith was a fifth-generation descendant of missionary settlers in Hawaii. He was born in 1921 in Honolulu, Hawaii, the son of William and Margaret Thurston Twigg-Smith (1895–1931). He was the great great-grandson of two missionary couples: Asa and Lucy Goodale Thurston and Lorrin Andrews and his wife. He was the grandson of an American lawyer, politician, and businessman born and raised in the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi, Lorrin A. Thurston, who played a key role in the 1893 overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom. His father William was an artist and a musician, who supported his family as an illustrator at the Hawaiian Sugar Planters' Association. Twigg-Smith grew up in the lower Nuuanu Valley on Bates Street, in a house his father built. At the time, L.A. Thurston was publisher of the Honolulu Advertiser. Twigg-Smith, his brother David, and sister Barbara attended Lincoln and Kapalama elementary schools. Twigg-Smith went on to President Theodore Roosevelt High School for junior high and entered Punahou School in the 10th grade on a scholarship. He graduated from Punahou School in 1938 and earned a mechanical engineering degree from Yale University in 1942. Twigg-Smith served in the armed forces during World War II in Europe in five campaigns. He attained the rank of captain in the field artillery and was awarded the Bronze Star. Returning to Hawaii in December 1945, he started work at the Honolulu Advertiser in February 1946. As a major, he started the 483rd Field Artillery battalion in the Hawaii National Guard. He left the guard in 1954 as a lieutenant colonel to concentrate on his duties as managing editor of the newspaper. In 1961 Twigg-Smith took control of the financially ailing paper with the help of outside investors. It became financially profitable. In 1993 it was bought by a regional subsidiary of the Gannett Company for $250 million. Twigg-Smith founded the Persis Corporation in 1967, originally named \\"Asa Corporation (Hawaii)\\" after his ancestor.

He graduated at the University of Virginia in 1856, and studied at the University of Berlin from 1866 to 1868. From 1869 to 1879 he was professor of Hebrew in the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary (first in Greenville, South Carolina, and after 1877 in Louisville, Kentucky), and in 1880 he became professor of Hebrew and Oriental languages at Harvard University, where until 1903 he was also Dexter lecturer on biblical literature.  Controversy  While Professor Toy was a professor at The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky, he was embroiled in one of the earliest theological controversies of the Southern Baptist Convention, which was founded in 1845. Influenced by European higher criticism of the Bible and advances in science, Toy began intellectual pursuits that would ultimately cost him his tenure at Southern. Toy began to see Darwin's theories as truth revealed by God \\"in the form proper to his time.\\" Shaped by the historical-critical method of studying scripture that had been popularized in Europe by Julius Wellhausen, Toy came to believe that the writers of the New Testament—using a rabbinical hermeneutic of their day—misunderstood the original meaning of several Old Testament passages (e.g., Psalm 16:10, Isaiah 53) when they placed a Christological emphasis on them.Phyllis R. Tippit, W.H. Bellinger, Jr., \\"Repeating History: Crawford Howell Toy,\\" Baptist History and Heritage, Winter 2003 The founding president of Southern, Dr. James P. Boyce, asked Toy to refrain from teaching contrary to the school's Abstract of Principles on the doctrine of biblical inspiration. Toy, however, insisted on answering questions by students pertinent to his modernist understanding of the Old Testament. It was an April 1879 article in The Sunday School Times on his views of Isaiah 53:1–12 that would lead to his resignation in May of the same year. Soon after Toy went to be the professor of Hebrew and Semitic languages at Harvard, he broke his ties with Southern Baptists and became a practising Unitarian. The effects of Toy's dismissal continued to rumble through Southern Baptist life. Two young missionaries appointed by the Foreign Mission Board (SBC) were ultimately dismissed because of holding views similar to those of Professor Toy.Catherine B. Allen 1997, The New Lottie Moon Story, 2d ed. Birmingham, AL: Women's Missionary Union 136–39.  Relationship with Lottie Moon  In addition to his controversy at Southern Seminary, Toy is also famous for teaching and once being engaged to Lottie Moon, for whom the SBC annual Christmas offering for international missions is named. Toy first encountered Lottie Moon at the Albemarle Female Institute, founded by Southern Seminary founder John Broadus. Lottie was a capable student in languages, becoming one of the first women in the south to earn a master's degree in the field. Lottie—who previously learned Latin, Greek, French, Italian, and Spanish—would learn Hebrew and English grammar under Toy's tutelage. Toy wrote of Moon, \\"She writes the best English I have ever been privileged to read.\\" Lottie Moon went on to become a missionary in Tengchow, China. In her 1881 correspondence with Southern Baptist Foreign Mission Board secretary H. A. Tupper, Moon expressed her plans to marry Toy, who was now a professor at Harvard. Ultimately, Toy and Moon's relationship was broken before their marriage plans were realized. Moon cited religious reasons for calling off the wedding—his controversial new beliefs regarding the Bible and her commitment to remain in China doing mission work for Southern Baptists.

The station was the first in the industry to introduce a \\"visitor information\\" format since the format signed on during the Memorial Day weekend of 2004. Its approach emphasises tips and suggestions to help visitors make the best of their vacation time in the popular resort region, even to the point of actually encouraging visitors to come into the studios on Broadway in Downtown Wisconsin Dells and relate their experiences. The station's musical playlist is broad, extending to oldies, 1970s and 1980s hits, country standards and soft hits. Since its audio stream went online in Spring 2005, it became the #1 online radio station in the world of its type. In September 2007, the station returned to its original format of classic country. History The station was founded in 1969 by Obed S. Borgen and originally went on the air as WWDA on 990 kHz (the call sign stood for \\"Wonderful Wisconsin Dells Area\\"). An FM sister station, at 106.9 FM, was added four years later, with John Taylor as the general manager. Taylor Electric Company acquired WWDA and the FM station, WQRH) and relaunched the station as WNNO-AM- FM, call letters the AM station would use from the 1970s (during which time it was a Mutual Broadcasting System affiliate) into the 1990s. The station was sold to Voss Radio, Inc. in 1978, and it continued to simulcast Top 40 music. WNNO-AM-FM split its simulcast and programmed Country Hits in 1982, and broadcast Chicago Cubs baseball from 1983-1985. It was during this time period that the frequency moved from the original AM 990 to the current AM 900 dial position. Voss sold the station in 1985 to Armada Broadcasting. At this time, WNNO AM returned to simulcasting Top 40 hits with WNNO-FM. One of the principal owners of Armada Broadcasting is the nephew of radio legend Gary Owens, and Gary's liners for WNNO could be heard on the station during this time period. During the early-mid 90s its format alternated between sports and a simulcast of sister Top-40 station WNNO-FM (106.9), or was otherwise off the air, usually after sunset. WNNO and WNNO-FM had studios together on Superior Street in Wisconsin Dells and would usually be on the air from 6 a.m. to midnight. In the late 1990s WNNO-AM-FM were purchased by Magnum Radio Group; the studios were moved to Church Street, Wisconsin Dells, using the call of WBKY-FM (95.9) Portage. By this time, WNNO-AM had become nothing but a simulcast of WIBU-AM (1240) Poynette/Portage, which aired Jones Radio Networks' Classic Hit Country format at the time. The calls were subsequently changed to WDLS; concurrently, WNNO-FM became Jones Hot AC under the name \\"Mix 106\\". By 2000, WIBU and WDLS had become adult standards simulcasting Jones' Music of Your Life format. WIBU was later sold off and WDLS became WIBU while continuing to air the adult standards format. The format of Tourist Info on AM 900 was launched on Memorial Day weekend of 2004, along with the return of the WDLS calls and opening of the current studios on Broadway. As of September 2007, the station returned to its original roots of broadcasting classic country music to the four county region. =The online feed of the Tourist Station era= In March 2005, the online audio stream of WDLS-AM, as powered by Warp Radio, went live on its website to further increase its potential audience across the Internet. Within weeks of its launch, its audio stream became the #1 online streaming radio station for its genre, attracting listeners (and subsequent e-mail inquiries about the Wisconsin Dells area) from around the world. In December 2006, hosting for the online stream was moved to Surfer Network.

Moshe \\"Miki\\" Berkovich, or Mickey Berkowitz (; born 17 February 1954), is a retired Israeli professional basketball player. A 6'4\\" shooting guard, he is considered by many to be the greatest Israeli basketball player of all time. Berkovich was named one of FIBA's 50 Greatest Players in 1991. In 1998, he was named Israel's Top Sportsmen of the 50 Year Jubilee (1948–1998).ISRAEL'S TOP SPORTSMAN: MIKI BERKOWITZ.HALL OF FAMERS Mickey Berkowitz (Israel). He was named one of the 50 Greatest EuroLeague Contributors, by a select panel in February 2008, and was then honored at the 2008 EuroLeague Final Four, in Madrid. He became a FIBA Hall of Fame player in 2017.Dream Team, Shaq and Kukoc headline 2017 Class of FIBA Hall of Fame Inductees. Early years Born in Kfar Saba, Israel, Berkovich began his long and distinguished career with Maccabi Tel Aviv, at the age of 11, when he joined the youth club. At the age of 15, he was playing for the junior squad. In 1971, at the age of 17, he made his debut with the senior men's team in Israel's top professional league. College playing career In 1975, he played college basketball at UNLV, in the United States. During the 1975–76 season, he played in 11 games and averaged 2.5 points per game, as the Runnin' Rebels finished 28–1, and were the No. 1 seed in the Western Region of the NCAA tournament. They defeated Boise State, 103–78, in the first round, although Berkovich registered no points and only one rebound. UNLV then lost to Arizona, 114–109, in the second round; Berkovich did not play in the game. He returned to Maccabi, after just one year. Club playing career Berkovich returned to Israel following the 1975–76 season, and played a considerable role in Maccabi Tel Aviv's fortunes during the late 1970s and early 1980s. In 1977, Berkovich helped Maccabi Tel Aviv to win its first FIBA European Champions Cup (EuroLeague) championship, by defeating Mobilgirgi Varese, by a score of 78:77 in the final, held in Pionir Hall, Belgrade, and CSKA Moscow 91:79 in the semifinals game held in Virton, Belgium. An achievement that led to Tal Brody's famous statement of, \\"We are on the map, not only in basketball\\". In 1981, the second FIBA European Champions Cup title came for Maccabi, against another Italian team, Sinudyne Bologna. Berkovich scored the winning basket from an assist by Moti Aroesti, setting the score at 80:77. There were no three point shots back then, so the Italians could only score a two-point basket in return, and Maccabi won the game, by a score of 80:79. Berkovich's career in Maccabi came to an end in 1988, when he and Aroesti joined Maccabi Rishon LeZion. Later, he played with Hapoel Jerusalem and Hapoel Tel Aviv. During his playing years with Maccabi, he won 16 Israeli national league championship titles, and 13 Israeli national cups. =NBA offers= After the EuroBasket 1979, Berkovich had contract offers from the New Jersey Nets and the Atlanta Hawks, from the NBA, but a contract with Maccabi Tel Aviv stood in the way. Maccabi's management insisted that he stay in the team, so they had to settle the case in civil court. National team career In 1972, Berkovich took the Israeli under-18 national team to a fourth-place finish at the 1972 FIBA Europe Under-18 Championship, and he was the leading scorer of the tournament. The same year, Berkovich also won a gold medal at the 1974 Asian Games, in Tehran. In 1979, Berkovich was a part of the senior Israeli national basketball team that finished second (behind the Soviet national team) at the 1979 EuroBasket, in Turin. Berkovich was named the tournament MVP. Upon his retirement, he was second all-time in appearances (165), and points scored (2,842), among members of the senior men's Israeli national basketball team. Post-playing career Berkovich retired from basketball in 1995, after which he wrote an autobiography called Born to Win. He went on to become the owner of the A.S. Ramat HaSharon basketball team. Both of his sons, Roi and Niv Berkovich, played for the team at the time. He later became the Director of Basketball Operations of Ironi Nahariya, but left the team after just one year.

HAF is involved in the areas of human rights, civil rights and education among others. About The Hindu American Foundation (HAF) was founded in September 2003 by Mihir Meghani, an emergency care physician, Aseem Shukla, an associate professor in urologic surgery, Suhag Shukla, an attorney, Nikhil Joshi, a labor law attorney, and Adeeti Joshi, a speech therapist. The organization describes itself as a human rights and advocacy group, providing \\"a voice for the 2 million strong Hindu American community\\", that aims to educate the government and the public about Hinduism and the issues concerning the Hindus globally. It emphasizes the \\"Hindu and American ideals of understanding, tolerance and pluralism.\\" According to Harvard professor Diana L. Eck, the foundation has emerged as \\"the first major national advocacy group looking at Hindu identity.\\" Scholar Vinay Lal has noted that the organization draws on the claims of Hinduism being unique in its tolerance and religious pluralism as well as the enormous goodwill created by Gandhi in the West. Activism During 2004-05, the organization held events to educate legislators about issues of concern to Hindu Americans. These included the abuse of Hindus in the Muslim majority regions of South Asia, including Kashmir, Bangladesh and Pakistan. During the visit of Pervez Musharraf to the US in 2006, the organization issued a press release holding the Musharraf regime complicit in the \\"forced religious conversions, temple destructions and intimidation of Hindus\\" in Pakistan. In 2004, HAF challenged the public display of the Ten Commandments in Texas, where it appeared as amici curiae (friend of the Court) in Van Orden v. Perry in the United States Supreme Court. It argued that the display represented an \\"inherent government preference\\" for Judeo-Christian religions over others and the state must be reminded of its obligation to maintain religious neutrality. In 2005, HAF, along with the Buddhist Peace Fellowship, the Association on American Indian Affairs and the Interfaith Alliance, was involved in the Simpson v. Chesterfield County case regarding legislative prayer. In 2008, HAF along with a coalition of other religious groups, filed suit and blocked the issuance of Christian themed license plates in South Carolina. The organization supports strong ties between India, Israel and the US to create an axis of countries aiming to fight Islamic terrorism. In 2005, it joined the American Jewish Committee (AJC) to jointly sponsor a program at Stanford University on \\"countering biases against Hindus and Jews on the College campus.\\" In 2010, the Foundation launched a Take Yoga Back campaign as a reaction to the cultural appropriation and secularization of yoga. It contended that Raja Yoga is an integral part of Hinduism and cannot not be practiced independently, inviting criticism from Deepak Chopra and Meera Nanda. In 2013, HAF joined a coalition of Christian, Jewish, Hindu, Sikh, and Muslim organizations urging the Justice Department investigate the New York City Police Department for discriminatory surveillance of American Muslims. The organization also joined the National Religious Campaign Against Torture in expressing concern over the existence of and hunger strikes by detainees at Guantanamo Bay, and the torture of suspected Muslim terrorists. In 2014, HAF held joint protests for the genocide of Yazidis under the Islamic State in Iraq. In 2015, as a part of the Hate Crimes Coalition, HAF participated in the drafting and submission of the edits to an FBI manual to specifically track hate crimes against Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims. In 2016, HAF along with Indiaspora and other organizations successfully convinced the United States Postal Service to issue a stamp commemorating the Hindu festival of Diwali. In 2018, the organization launched the Shakti Initiative, a website highlighting Hindu teachings about and by women, the contributions of Hindu women throughout history, and how Hindu women can address critical contemporary issues. In 2019, the HAF along with the American Civil Liberties Union and various Jewish religious and civil rights organizations filed a friend-of-the-court brief with the United States Supreme Court in support of a constitutional challenge to a government-sponsored 40-foot cross as a war memorial in Bladensburg, Maryland in the American Legion v. American Humanist Association case. HAF also joined a coalition of interfaith and civil rights groups opposing Project Blitz, a coordinated national effort to enshrine Christian nationalism in state laws in the United States, which could undermine civil rights protections and healthcare access for women, LGBTQ people, those of minority faiths, and the nonreligious. On May 12 2019, HAF along with the AJC, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, and other interfaith groups held a solidarity vigil for the 2019 Easter Sunday terrorist bombings in Sri Lanka. In September 2019, the HAF published a letter, co- signed by \\"a record number of 230 Indian-American organisations\\", asking congressman Ro Khanna to withdraw from the Congressional Caucus on Pakistan and criticizing him for a tweet where he had stated that \\"it is the duty of every American politician of Hindu faith to stand for pluralism, reject Hindutva, and speak for equal rights for Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Buddhist and Christians.\\" Human rights Since 2005, the Hindu American Foundation has published annual reports entitled Hindus in South Asia & The Diaspora: A Survey of Human Rights on the status of human rights of Hindus worldwide. Past reports have covered the status of Hindus living in Afghanistan, Australia, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Fiji, the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka, and Trinidad and Tobago, as well as expatriated refugees from those regions. The reports provide detailed accounts of human rights violations such as violence against women, murder, ethnic cleansing, temple destruction, socio-political ostracization, disenfranchisement, discrimination, and forced conversions perpetrated against Hindus because of their religious identity. The incidents are documented, sourced from first hand accounts, media reports, and international and regional human rights agencies. The reports have received endorsements and praise from various U.S. elected officials, religious leaders, human rights groups, and academics. In 2010, the organization issued a report on the caste system, asking Hindus to acknowledge that caste is not an intrinsic part of Hinduism even though it is a feature of the Hindu society and labeling caste-based discrimination as a major human rights problem. The report declares that only Hindus, through reform movements and education, can rid Hindu society of caste-based discrimination. It also castigates organizations like evangelical Dignity Freedom Network for arguing that Dalits are not Hindus. Ramesh Rao, Recasting Hinduism for the 21st Century, Guardian, 21 December 2010, retrieved 2015-10-21. The Hindu activist scholar Rajiv Malhotra has called the report flawed and pointed out that the jatis (birth groups) that have been relabeled \\"castes\\" in modern times are an integral part of the Indian social structure and that jatis have enabled collective bargaining of rights.Rajiv Malhotra, Critique of Hindu American Foundation's Report on 'Caste' , Medha Journal, 10 December 2013. HAF has spoken at or hosted congressional briefings related to human rights of Hindus in South Asia in 2007, human rights of Kashmiri Hindus in 2009and 2011, minorities in Malaysia in 2008 and 2011, the persecution of minority women in Pakistan in 2013, Pakistani Hindu refugees in India in 2013, religious violence in Bangladesh in 2015, and India’s diversity and democracy in 2018. The organization also briefed the UK House of Lords on the human rights of Malaysian Hindus in 2008. HAF has organized film screenings and talks related to the human rights of Hindus including Refugees of Shangri-La: The Untold Story of Bhutanese Refugees, The Human Boundaries, A Day in the Life of a Pakistani Hindu by activists from the Pakistan Hindu Seva Welfare Trust, Thrust into Heaven, and Plight of Hindus in Malaysia by Malaysian HINDRAF activist Waytha Moorthy. HAF also provides direct assistance to Hindu refugees such funds for the resettlement of Bhutanese Hindus in America, medical care for Bhutanese refugees in Nepal, and physical and mental care and aid for Pakistani Hindu refugees in India. Education In 2006, HAF was actively involved in the Californian Hindu textbook controversy. On March 16, 2006, it filed a lawsuit contesting the California's Curriculum Commission's decision to reject many of the Vedic Foundation and Hindu Education Foundation's suggested edits to California's textbook curriculum on Hinduism and India. The proposed changes had been publicly opposed by Indologists organized by Michael Witzel, who renounced them as \\"politically and religiously motivated\\", as well as by various Hindu groups.New Battleground In Textbook Wars: Religion in History Hindu, Islamic, Jewish Groups Fault Portrayals of Events And Often Win Changes, The Wall Street Journal (January 25, 2006) The court ruled to retain the textbooks, noting the significant expense associated with reissuing the textbooks. In 2014, the Texas State Board of Education voted to adopt new textbooks that incorporated over 100 corrections submitted by HAF working in conjunction with scholars and historians. Some of the changes in the textbooks include coverage of Hinduism and Hindus in contemporary world history and geography, greater context in the explanation of caste, and the first-ever K-12 textbook mention of Hindu saint Adi Shankara. In 2015, the Virginia Board of Education approved new standards regarding the teaching of Hinduism and ancient India after working with HAF and other Hindu American parents in the state. In 2016, the Foundation released a report on the representation of Hinduism in classrooms and the bullying of Hindu American students. Among other findings, the report said that one in three Hindu American students had been bullied for their religious beliefs, and that one in eight students reported that their teachers made sarcastic remarks about Hinduism in front of a class. In 2016, the HAF lobbied against the replacement of the word “Indian” with “South Asian” in middle school history textbooks in California, arguing that the change was essentially an erasure of India itself. These efforts were protested by South Asian academics and activists belonging to India’s minority groups, who said that those on the side of the HAF sought to whitewash California’s history textbooks to present a nativist, blemish-free view of how the Hindu caste system was enforced in India. They also argued that the term “South Asia” correctly represents India’s collective history with countries like Pakistan and Bangladesh. A letter to the California State Board of Education about this issue, which garnered thousands of signatures, was spearheaded by the HAF. As of 2018, HAF reported having trained over 3,000 educators to date on how to teaching Hinduism in what they term an accurate and engaging manner. Criticism The Coalition Against Genocide (CAG) and others have alleged that the organization has links to Hindu nationalist organizations, namely the Vishva Hindu Parishad America (VHPA) and Hindu Swayamsevak Sangh (HSS), the overseas wing of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. Specifically, these critics cited that one of the organization’s founders, Mihir Meghani, also founded the University of Michigan's chapter of the Hindu Students Council (HSC), a nationwide network of student societies affiliated with the VHPA, in 1991. He is also known to have been a member of the HSS. CAG also alleged that he and several other members of the HAF were previously affiliated with other organizations associated with the Sangh Parivar. : \\"Thus Rishi Bhutada came out of the HSC at University of Pennsylvania, Sheetal Shah served as the Southeast Regional Coordinator for the HSC, Suhag Shukla was active with organizing HSC's regional conferences in the same region, Kavitha Pallod out of the VHP-A’s American Hindu Youth Camp, Padma Kuppa with the VHP-A's Hindu Temple Executive Council, and Ramesh Rao with the India Development and Relief Fund (IDRF), a fund-raising arm of the VHP-A.\\" CAG also alleges that while the HAF aims to expose maltreatment of Hindu minorities in countries such as Bangladesh and Pakistan in its annual report “Hindus in South Asia & The Diaspora: A Survey of Human Rights”, it also systematically downplays the maltreatment of non-Hindu minorities in India, and further labels such concerns about Indian religious minorities as “anti- Hindu bias.” HAF has denied these allegations terming them as defamatory and blatantly false. In response to the allegations, the HAF labeled the Coalition Against Genocide as an “extreme Leftist” organization with a “radical, violent and confrontational agenda built on a revolutionary, Marxist paradigm” and published a report claiming that their research revealed that CAG is an \\"unregistered group primarily composed of defunct or unregistered entities, many sharing the same leadership and IP addresses for their websites, whose focus is to malign Hindu advocacy groups while promoting radical revolution in India along narrow ideological grounds.\\" Nikhil Joshi, a former board member of the foundation, stated that, \\"HAF has absolutely no links to any Hindu nationalist social, political or religious groups in the United States or India. HAF does not advocate for Hindutva, Maoism, Communism or any other political ideology. None of HAF’s founders or leaders is a member of any nationalist organization.\\" Nicholas O’Connell, a member of HAF's Executive Council, defended the group saying that a few of its leaders had participated in VHPA-affiliated student groups in high school and college along with “thousands of teens” in the 1970s and 1980s when the vast majority of Hindu student groups were organized by the VHPA. Sheetal Shah, Coalition Against Reality: Deconstructing an Attack on the Hindu American Foundation, Belief Net, January 2014 In 2018, Suhag Shukla, the Executive Director, denounced these and similar allegations stating that, \\"Ascribing a sinister agenda or affiliations when Hindus enter the public square, advocate for their rights, support charitable causes in India, or host conferences to gather and celebrate among faithful, must be called out as anti-Hindu and repudiated.\\" The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) credited Meghani as the author of an essay on their website titled Hindutva: The Great Nationalist Ideology, which claims that Hindus and Hinduism were denigrated by the Indian National Congress and that Hindus rose up to demand a \\"true secularism.\\" The essay drew a parallel between the Hindu experience and that of Jews, African Americans and colonized groups, and defended the demolition of the Babri Masjid, terming it as the release of \\"thousands of years of anger and shame.\\" In 2006, in a letter printed in India Abroad, Meghani denied authoring the essay on the BJP website, though he did author similar essay as a teenager in the early 1990s and stated that he does “not stand by what is written.” As of 2006, the BJP removed Meghani’s name from the essay upon his request, and subsequently removed the essay from the website altogether.

He is currently a news anchor for WCBS Newsradio 880 and a business correspondent for CBS News. Life and career Guida began his career working as a reporter for WSAV-TV, Savannah, GA, and then for G.E.’s WRGB Television in Albany/ Schenectady, NY. Guida's career in New York City began in 1970 at New York television station WOR-TV (now WWOR-TV) as a reporter and later in 1971 as co-anchor of that station's former 7pm newscast. In 1972, Guida went to WNBC as a weekend co-anchor, later becoming Chief Political Reporter for the station. In 1981, Guida joined WCBS-TV as Chief Political Reporter. In 1986, Guida re-joined WNBC-TV as Chief Political Reporter, and in 1989, Guida was promoted to co-anchor of Live at Five. In 1991 when the Live at Five moniker was briefly dropped from WNBC-TV, Guida was made co-anchor of Today in New York. Guida was unhappy with his move; when his contract with the station expired in 1992, Guida was offered a job to anchor a new noon newscast which did not start until 1995. Guida would also be responsible for keeping his co-hosting duties on Today In New York. Guida turned this offer down when he accepted WCBS-TV's offer as a senior reporter. In 1993, Guida added 5pm co-anchor to his reporting duties. In 1994, Guida was switched from 5pm to 6pm co-anchor. In 1995, Guida replaced Jim Jensen as co- anchor of WCBS-TV's Sunday morning public affairs program, Sunday Edition. That same year, Guida was made co-anchor of the 5pm and 11pm newscasts for a short period of time after John Roberts left to join CBS News and before John Johnson joined from WABC-TV. Guida kept his other WCBS-TV duties during this short period of time. In 1996, Guida, along with Johnson, Michele Marsh and other WCBS-TV anchors were fired from the station. Guida was later hired as lead anchor for a new station launched by Dow Jones & Company, WBIS+. When that station was sold to Paxson Communications in 1997, Guida joined CNNfn as a daytime anchor. During that period of time, Guida filled in for Lou Dobbs on Moneyline, a business news show that aired on both CNN and CNNfn and is now known as Lou Dobbs Tonight. In 2001, Guida was yet again a part of a mass firing, this time at CNN. Later that year, Guida joined WCBS-AM as an anchor where he anchored coverage of the September 11, 2001 attacks throughout that day. Guida remains there today. In the past few years, Guida has filed reports for the Saturday Edition of the CBS Evening News, and for MSNBC where he has served as a backup anchor for Countdown with Keith Olbermann. In 2005 Guida supplied the voice of the Newsreader in the Activision PC video game The Movies.

First released in Europe in 1995 on the EastWest label, it was released the following year in the United States on the Discovery label. It was recorded in Los Angeles and produced by John Philip Shenale, who also produced DeVille’s Backstreets of Desire album. Duet with Brenda Lee Loup Garou includes a duet with Brenda Lee (“You’ll Never Know”). DeVille said about recording with Lee: > She’s amazing, and so professional.

Reviews Allmusic's 2008 capsule review says, “With Loup Garou, Willie DeVille explored new rhythmic and melodic territory, experimenting with cajun and mariachi music. Not all of the songs work--frequently, Deville sounds too nervous and studied to really break free and have fun with the material--but it nevertheless is enjoyable, with enough strong songs (especially ‘You’ll Never Know,’ a duet with Brenda Lee) to make it worthwhile for longtime DeVille followers.”Owens, Thom (2007) [ “Review: Loup Garou.”] Allmusic. (Retrieved 3-9-08.) The album received at least two favorable reviews at the time of its release. Musician said, “Loup Garou is subtle in nuance but staggering in scope; it connects the dots between all of the artist’s sacrosanct influences, often within the framework of a single song … All of it is on the money, performed from the heart.”Editors (September 1996) “Review of Loup Garou.” Musician magazine, p. 90. The Independent said, “(Deville’s) voice has, if anything, improved with the husky patina of age. Loup Garou builds on his trademark sub-Springsteen style, adding a few Louisiana voodoo touches where appropriate, particularly on the title track, and blending in other, more unusual textures, like the fairground sound of the Optigan keyboard on ‘Still (I Love You Still).’ He comes close to poignancy-overload on ‘Angels Don't Lie,’ where wistful uilleann pipes and penny-whistle are combined with the haunting string-pad sound from ‘Streets of Philadelphia,’ but there's enough skill and sensitivity elsewhere to render this a more than capable comeback.”Gill, Andy (January 12, 1996) \\"Albums.\\" The Independent. (Retrieved June 2, 2009.) Other information While DeVille wrote most of Loup Garou in his native English, some songs have lyrics in Cajun French, and “Asi Te Amo” is a Spanish language reprise of the track “Still (I Love You Still).” \\"No Such Pain as Love\\" presents a rare country music offering by DeVille.

As of 2013, it is reportedly Australia's richest literary prize with the top winner receiving 125,000 and category winners 25,000 each. They were established in 1985 by John Cain, the Premier of Victoria at that time, to mark the centenary of the births of Vance and Nettie Palmer, two of Australia's best-known writers and critics who both made significant contributions to Victorian and Australian literary culture. From 1986 through till 1997 they were presented as part of the Melbourne Writers Festival. In 1997 the administration of the awards was transferred to the State Library of Victoria.http://www.slv.vic.gov.au By 2004 the award's total prize money was 180,000. In 2011 stewardship was taken over by the Wheeler Centre. Winners 2011–present Beginning in 2011, the awards were restructured into 5 categories: Fiction, Nonfiction, Poetry, Drama and Young People's. The winner of each receives $25,000. Of those 5 winners, one is chosen as the overall winner of the Victorian Prize for Literature and receives an additional $100,000.

It was spoken by the Scottish Red River Métis in present-day Manitoba, Canada. Bungi has been categorized as a post-creole, with the distinctive features of the language gradually abandoned by successive generations of speakers in favour of standard Canadian English. In 1870, about 5,000 Métis were native speakers of Bungi, but by the late 1980s, only a handful of elderly speakers were known. Today, Bungi has very few if any speakers and is potentially extinct. Bungi was spoken in the Lower Red River Colony in the area from The Forks (where the Red River and Assiniboine River meet in what is now downtown Winnipeg) to the mouth of the Red River at Lake Winnipeg. This is the area where the English/Scottish retired HBC servants generally settled. Name of communication systemSpelling= Over the years, Bungi has been spelled many different ways by many different people, and was often referred to simply as the Red River Dialect. Expanded scholarship has preferred \\"Bungi\\" as the preferred spelling over \\"Bungee\\" and other spellings. =Dialect= The name derives from either , or , both words meaning a little bit. In these colloquial uses the term may have mildly pejorative connotations, even when used by speakers to describe themselves. Bungi is unusual as a dialect in that for the Scottish immigrants and the First Nations who developed the dialect, English was often a second language. =Language= Others, such as Brian Orvis, a Bungi-speaker from Selkirk, Manitoba, argued that Bungi is a language unto its own. He asserted that Bungee-speakers do not like to be recorded speaking the language because the First Nations values are that one should not call attention to oneself. It is because of this, he argues, that it is difficult to document Bungi, and the speakers will often deny knowledge of the language. Name of a people In addition to the being the name of a dialect, the word Bungi might have referred to a specific group of Métis of Scottish ancestry. The earliest records report that the name \\"Bungee\\" was used by the British, and especially Hudson's Bay Company employees to refer to the Saulteaux. Sometime around the turn of 20th Century, the word Bungi began to be used to refer to people of Scottish and First Nations ancestry. Description The major difference with other dialects is in the phonology (sound system and pronunciation). Voice quality differences are noticeably apparent. The lexicon is mostly English with words from Gaelic, Cree, Ojibwa, and other languages interspersed throughout. Several researchers have studied Bungi. Margaret Stobie studied Bungi and visited several communities where Bungi was spoken. In her 1971 article, The Dialect Called Bungi, Stobie reported that Bungi was the English dialect spoken by the descendants of Gaelic-speaking Highlanders. Blain conducted one of the most thorough academic studies of Bungi in her thesis and other publications, The Bungee Dialect of the Red River Settlement (1989). Unfortunately, due to the small number of speakers who participated in her research, the value of Blain's thesis is limited, and was a salvage effort to study what was left of the dialect. Bungi was spoken with a distinctive rhythm with a Gaelic fall, including the way that syllables are stressed, repetition of both nouns and pronouns in a sentence (e.g. \\"My brother is coming, him.\\"), changes in the pronunciation of phonemes (e.g. the phonemic distinction between [s] and [š] in not present in Western Cree dialects, and were reversed in Bungi from the standard English), etc. The third-person pronouns in Cree do not distinguish between masculine and feminine, which resulted in the interchangeable use of he and she in Bungi without regard for gender (e.g. \\"My wife he is going to the store.\\"). Bungee borrowed words and structures from the parent languages (e.g. the standard Bungee greeting of \\"I'm well, you but?\\" came directly from Cree). Bungi speakers also reported that Bungi uses Cree vowels and Scots consonants. It often uses Cree syntax. Social context and extinction of Bungi as a spoken dialect Prior 1938, people were already expressing concerns about the potential loss of Bungi. Mr. J. J. Moncrief, writing under the nom de plume \\"Old Timer,\\" and Osborne Scott expressed their concerns about the survival of the Red River dialect. Others wrote in letters to the editor in 1938 that Bungi would be gone in a generation. In her thesis, The Bungee Dialect of the Red River Settlement (1989), Blain discusses the ways in which Bungi-speaking families were excluded (whether this was intentional discrimination by the community or because of reluctance on the part of the family is not known), including not having their family history included in local history books, being assigned to wash an enormous amount dishes away from the festivities at events, people trying to hide their Indigneous ancestry, shame about how they sound when they spoke Bungi, etc. Blain also notes that Bungi was in a constant state of change that was evolving towards the local stand English. Swan also reports the prejudice towards Bungi speakers in her thesis, Ethnicity and the Canadianization of Red River Politics (1991). She suggests that Anglo-Métis Manitoba Premier John Norquay, who was born near St. Andrews in what was the Red River Colony and would have spoken Bungi, had dropped his accent by the time that he had entered politics. The social prejudice towards Bungi speakers and the very sensitive linguistic environment ultimately led to the extinction of this dialect. Scholarship The main linguistic documentation of this dialect were conducted by Eleanor M. Blain (1987, 1989), Francis \\"Frank\\" J. Walters (1969–1970, ), Margaret Stobie (1967–68, 1970, 1971) and Elaine Gold (2007, 2009). Osborne Scott also contributed to the understanding of Bungi (1937, 1951). Examples of BungiExample from J. J. Moncrieef article= In an article titled Red River Dialectpublished in 1936 under the pseudonym Old Timer (a nom de plume commonly used by J. J. Moncrieef who was from the Shetland Islands), the author provided an excerpt from a letter that had some Bungi. =Examples from Osborne Scott's Red River Dialect article= Osborne Scott gave a talk on the radio at CKY on Dec. 7, 1937 about Bungi (the talk was later published in The Winnipeg Evening Tribune on Dec. 12, 1937 with the title Red River Dialect and again as a slightly longer article in 1951 in The Beaver, also with the title of Red River Dialect). Another story was recounted in the same article. Scott also recounted a discussion that he had overheard. Scott also recounted a discussion that he had been a part of. In the same article, Scott provided a few more examples and definitions of words: * \\" 'Bye me I kakatch [nearly] killed it two ducks with wan sot.' \\" * \\" 'Keeyam' meaning never mind, let it go. 'Girl Keeyam if you take my neechimos (sweetheart) I'll get me another whatefer!' \\" * \\" 'Chimmuck,\\" one of those words whose sound suits the sense, represents the sound a stone makes when falling perpendicular into water, for instance, 'he fell off the rock chimmuck in lake.' \\" * \\" 'The canoe went apeechequanee and they went chimmuck,' apeechequanee meaning head over heels.\\" * \\" 'I know by where there is a fine bus of neepinnans (high bush cranberries).' \\" * \\"Paper and pepper were pronounced 'pepper,' and you indicated whether it was eating or writing that you wanted.\\" * \\"Some French words were incorporated in the dialect, as for instance, a trunk or box was a 'cassette.' \\" * \\"The Scots word 'byre' was always used instead of stable or cowshead.\\" * \\"They never put out a fire or candle, it was always 'slocked.' \\" * \\" 'Mooneas' was one Cree word which was used to great effect by the native. It means greenhorn or newcomer.\\" Scott said that First Nations words were used in Bungi most often as \\"picturesque short words, generally exclamatory\\". In addition, the names of birds, animals, and plants were commonly First Nations words, as these things were new to the immigrants. In a later, updated version of the article in 1951 that included parts of the original radio broadcast that were not in The Winnipeg Evening Tribune article, Osborne also told of a young Canon M. Sanderson learing to pronounce [s] and [š] under the tutelage of Rev. S. P. Matheson. When Sanderson was working with Rev. J. J. Anderson as his assistant, Anderson reported to Matheson that he had overdone it—instead of paying \\"God save the Queen,\\" Sanderson had said \\"God shave the Queen.\\" However, Sanderson would discredit this idea in a letter to the editor, called Canon Sanderson Drops into Red River Dialect in response to Osborne's 1937 article ad radio address, and also included some examples of words in Bungi. =Examples from letters in support of Osborne Scott= In a letter to the editor titled Aw, My Fer You, Osborne Scott!, an anonymous person using the psuedonym Bung-gay (a nom de plume for Islay Mary (Charles) Sinclair, who was said could not speak Bungi but rather imitate it from having lived in the community for a long time) wrote a letter to the editor in Bungi that Blain named the McBean Letter. The letter was in response to an irate letter titled Not Offensive to Red River Descendants about Scott's article submitted by Mrs. A. Kipling on January 7, 1938. Kipling felt that Scott had belittled and insulted the Bungi speakers of the Red River, when in fact Osborne and another contributor (likely Mr. J. J. Moncrieff under the pseudonym An Old Timer) were saddened by the vanishing of Bungi and that their children would not know the accents and dialect, and wanted to remember the humour as well. In another letters to the editor in support of Scott, called Oldtimer Appreciates Osborne Scott's Article, Mary I. Kennedy contributed examples of Bungi: * \\" 'I'll not can do it me, whatever but.' Expressive of utter impossibility.\\" * \\" A man of the country was in the hospital for some time, and a friends called to see him. 'You got a garden, bye?' 'Eh! Eh! A fine garden and suts fine celery. Bye, you never seen suts fine celery. My faather's buried somewhere about here.' \\" * \\"Then John exclaimed 'Tgh high! (pronounced as in light) I nuvvur see such a what fur a ox.\\" She also included a few stories of nicknames, such as a family by the name of Johnstone who were christened with \\"Teapot\\" for their addiction to tea, which was more familiar and seen as a distinguishing mark for them. =Example from discussion of Victoria Cottage (Bunn House)= Another example of Bungi with a standard English translation is provided through Red River North Heritage as a part of their geocache work (this is for Site 1: Bunn's Road). This is Rachel Bunn telling the story of how her husband, Thomas Bunn, built a stone house known as Victoria Cottage (which is now a historic site). A modern recording of this being spoken is also available on the Red River North Heritage website. The exact origin of this text is not provided. =The Shtory of Little Red Ridin Hood= D. A. Mulligan wrote the story of Little Red Riding Hood as it would have been told in Bungi, titled The Shtory of Little Red Ridin Hood. =Blain's thesis The Bungee Dialect of the Red River Settlement= In her thesis, The Bungee Dialect of the Red River Settlement, Eleanor Blain provides an extensive discussion on Bungi, with examples of words and phrases used in Bungi, as well as a transcription of Walters' story This is What I'm Thinkin as part of an appendix (both a linguistic version and a reading version). =Walters' Bungi audio collection= Frank Walters was a historian that was interested in perserving Bungi heritage. He conducted a study of Bungi, and made a series of recordings known as the Bungee Collection (also known as the Walters Collection).

They also provide MOT, service and repairs in the United Kingdom, through Halfords Autocentre. Halfords Group is listed on the London Stock Exchange. A similar retail company, also called Halfords, exists in the Netherlands and Belgium. This only has historical ties to the British Halfords Group (it was formed by Halfords, then sold). History A Halfords in Kirkstall, Leeds (2006) The company was founded by Frederick Rushbrooke, in Birmingham in 1892, as a wholesale ironmongery. Rushbrooke moved to a new store on Halford Street in Leicester, in 1902, and the company was named after this street, and started selling cycling goods. It opened its two hundredth store in 1931, and purchased the Birmingham Bicycle Company in 1945. It opened its three hundredth store in 1968. The company became a part of Burmah Oil in 1965, following a takeover battle between Burmah and Smiths Industries. During this time, Denis Thatcher, husband of the future Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, was a non executive director.Halfords cleans up in bid to woo women drivers Daily Mail, 21 September 2006 The company was acquired by the Ward White Group in 1983, and subsequently acquired by the Boots Group in 1989, whom demerged from the company in April 2002. Openings for Halfords in Colne, as well as Great Mills, were planned by February 1997, but never happened for unknown reasons. It was then taken over by CVC Capital Partners in July 2003, and in June 2004, it was floated on the London Stock Exchange. Halfords dropped the blue, white and red branding in February 2003, in favour of a new, black and orange logo. However, the 'new' logo had been used since the previous year, but it did not come into effect until 2003. Halfords entered into a Collaboration Agreement with Autobacs Seven Co. on 11 July 2005, a Japan based car accessory retailer with chains of stores all over the world and who is best known in other countries that do not have an Autobacs store for being the title sponsorship of Super GT and D1 Grand Prix. Autobacs acquired 5% (11,400,000 shares) of the company on 13 December 2005, at approximately ¥7.5 billion. Halfords opened its first shop in Central Europe in June 2007, in a village near Prague. In the next two years, it opened five more stores in the Czech Republic and one in Poland (Wrocław, 2008). Expansion into Central Europe was seen as an opportunity, because the cars on the road tend to be slightly older there, so people would be more adept at car maintenance. However, in March 2010, it terminated these activities already, after the losses made in the initial years were deemed too high, and a new management wanted to focus on the domestic market. See also links on the bottom of that article; see also The company announced a new deal, to purchase the chain Nationwide Autocentre MOT on 18 February 2010, from the private equity firm, Phoenix. The plan was to rebrand the centres under the name Halfords, and open another two hundred. As of , there are over 250 garages branded Halfords Autocentre, dealing with MOTs, car repairs and servicing.Halfords buys car servicing firm Nationwide Autocentres BBC News Online. 18 February 2010 In June 2014, Halfords acquired the British bicycle manufacturer Boardman Bikes Ltd. (founded by the professional cyclist Chris Boardman, Sarah Mooney and Alan Ingarfield) for undisclosed sum. In March 2015, it was announced that on 11 May 2015, Jill McDonald, head of McDonald's UK since September 2010, would replace Matt Davies (who was leaving to join Tesco), as CEO. Halfords acquired Swansea based Tredz Bikes, an online retailer of premium bikes and cycling accessories, and Wheelies, the largest provider of bicycle replacement for insurance companies in the United Kingdom, for £18.4m, from founders Keith and Michael Jones, on 24 May 2016. The group turned over around £32m, in the year to 29 February 2016, making a profit, before financial charges of £2.4m. Halfords announced on 3 May 2017 that Jill McDonald, CEO, had resigned from the business, to take up the position of Managing Director: Clothing, Home & Beauty at Marks & Spencer. She remained as CEO of Halfords until the end of her notice period, in October 2017. Halfords made an announcement on 13 September 2017, that executive of Dixons Carphone, Graham Stapleton, would be its new CEO, with effect from January 2018. Operations Since 2010, Halfords Retail has operated around 465 stores, of which about twenty two are in the Republic of Ireland, and the others in the United Kingdom.According to the Annual Report 2009, there were 466 stores including six in Central Europe, and twenty two in Ireland. In 2010, there were 462 shops left, all in the British islands (Halfords Annual Report 2010 ). This number had grown to 466 in 2013, according to the Annual Report of that year. Sponsorship In 1987, Halfords sponsored the team of Professional Road Cycling, ANC Halfords, and that year, entered the Tour de France. However, the team ran out of money, at the end of the season, and officially disbanded. The team won the overall BTCC Drivers Championship, in 2005 and 2006, with driver Matt Neal.BTCC action: Matt Neal In March 2007, Halfords sponsored the Team Dynamics BTCC racing team, under the name of Team Halfords,Team Halfords field pair of Honda Civics BTCC, 13 March 2007 and in January 2008, Halfords started sponsoring a mixed professional bike team, Team Halfords Bikehut, headed by Nicole Cooke.Halfords backs Cooke for Glory Cycling Weekly, 8 January 2008 Cycle Republic In November 2014, Halfords announced it was going to revive its Cycle Republic chain of specialist bicycle stores, primarily focused on urban cycling and commuting, which is reflected in the brand's styling. The first store was opened in London, on 12 December 2014. The company's shop estate twenty two shops, and an ecommerce website operation offering an extended product range, as well as financing options. The company's flagship store in Canary Wharf was opened by Olympian, Victoria Pendleton, in January 2018. Cycle Republic sponsored the racing team, Morvélo Basso, for 2018. The company also provides event support at cyclo sportives around the country, including Etape Loch Ness, Palace2Palace and Velo Birmingham.

Players attempt to mine the fictitious metal \\"rubium\\" on a moon far off in space. Each player uses rubium to recruit units to mine and fight for the player. Players can employ humans, as well as fungoids, crystallines, rock striders, lava leapers, and rubium dragons. Each creature has a different attack value, and some of them have special abilities. The goal is to get 12 victory points, which are obtained by winning battles and accomplishing secret missions. The number of victory points can be changed to make for a longer or shorter game. The board consists of three homebase hexes for each player, in addition to nineteen hexes outside of the players' homebases. The hex in the center of the board is always the \\"monolith\\" (an elevated cardboard structure) which can give a player bonuses and serves to give the game something of a king-of-the-hill flavor. The modular board (along with randomly placed exploration tiles) serves to give the game a somewhat randomized feel, although the composition of the board tiles restricts their placement in some manners.

The Welsh Government says that it gives broader experiences than traditional learning programmes, developing transferable skills useful for education and employment. The Welsh Bacc is offered at Advanced (level 3), National (level 2) Foundation (level 1) and National/Foundation level, and is studied alongside a range of academic and vocational qualifications. The new Welsh Baccalaureate was introduced for teaching from September 2015 and was designed and developed in response to the findings of the 2012 Review of Qualifications for 14 to 19 year-olds in Wales. The primary aim is to enable learners to develop and demonstrate an understanding of, and proficiency in, essential and employability skills: Communication, Numeracy, Digital Literacy, Planning and Organisation, Creativity and Innovation, Critical Thinking and Problem Solving, and Personal Effectiveness. The new Welsh Baccalaureate differs from the legacy Baccalaureate (first made available across Wales in 2007 and last awarded in 2016) in both content and structure, most noticeably with the inclusion of the Skill Certificate Challenge qualification which can also be awarded independently of the WB. WJEC is the awarding body for the Welsh Baccalaureate. Award from 2015  Structure for the Post 16 Foundation Welsh Baccalaureate The Welsh Bacc is awarded at the following levels: *National/Foundation (levels 1 & 2) A two-year course delivered at key stage 4 to provide a vehicle for 14-16 year-olds to consolidate and develop essential and employability skills. Should the supporting General Certificates of Secondary Education (GCSEs) be graded A*-C the students will awarded the National level, if the supporting GCSES are graded A-G, students will be awarded the Welsh Bacc at Foundation level. *Foundation – Level 1 A one-year course delivered at post-16 stage in the context and level of the chosen learning programme. *National – Level 2 A one-year course delivered at post-16 stage for Level 2 learners. *Advanced - Level 3 A two year course delivered at post-16 stage for Level 3 learners. Legacy structure and requirements The legacy Welsh Baccalaureate Qualification, which was last awarded in 2016, consists of two parts – a compulsory Core and a choice of Options, which are made up of optional subjects or qualifications which the student may be following. Together, the Core and Options make up the Welsh Baccalaureate Qualification. Options are the courses/programmes currently studied by the student alongside the Core e.g. General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE), Advanced Subsidiary/Advanced (AS / A levels), BTec, Principal Learning. The Options requirements depend on the level of the Welsh Baccalaureate being followed. The Welsh Baccalaureate Advanced Diploma attracts 120 UCAS (university entry) points, the same as an A grade in an A Level subject. The awarding organisation for the Welsh Baccalaureate Qualification is WJEC. The structure of the Welsh Baccalaureate Core is the same at all three levels and consists of: *Essential Skills Wales/Key Skills qualifications (Exact requirements depend on the level followed) *Wales, Europe and the World (WEW) *Personal and Social Education (PSE) *Work-related Education (WRE)- work experience and a team enterprise activity *Community Participation *Language Module *Individual Investigation (Exact requirements depend on the level followed)  Developments  The Welsh Baccalaureate began in September 2003 as a pilot scheme involving 18 schools and colleges in Wales. The qualification was rolled out to centres across Wales in September 2007. By September 2012, 75,000 learners in 240 schools, colleges and work based learning centres were registered for the Welsh Baccalaureate courses. The Welsh Bac has become a familiar part of the educational landscape in Wales with all colleges and only a small minority of schools not delivering at least one level of the qualification. =Review of Qualifications for 14- to 19-year-olds in Wales= In the Review of Qualifications consultation document, published on 31 May 2012, the Review Board considered that the Welsh Bac was making an important contribution to the education of over 73,000 learners in Wales. The consultation document noted that 'The Board is currently of the view that the Welsh Baccalaureate has both relevance and value, that it should be further developed and promoted, and that eventually it should be universally adopted at 14–19 across Wales. The consultation went on to say \\"Feedback to the Review has been largely positive about the Welsh Baccalaureate. Stakeholders like its use of established qualifications in its options, the development of skills (including testing aspects of literacy and numeracy) in its Core, together with elements valued by employers and universities such as work experience, community participation and independent research.\\" =Grading = The Qualifications Review Board has proposed that the Welsh Baccalaureate should be graded at the Advanced level to maintain its currency for higher education admission and to ensure that learners' differing achievements are properly recognised. The Review Board indicated that further views would be canvassed about whether the Intermediate and Foundation levels should be graded. =Current levels of achievement= Figures released by the awarding organisation WJEC in August 2012 reported that a total of 8,259 candidates were awarded the Advanced Diploma, compared with 6,948 in 2011, the highest entry to date for this qualification. This represented 83% of those who completed the course. The successful candidates achieved at least two A levels or equivalent academic or vocational qualifications, as well as meeting the requirements of the Welsh Baccalaureate Core, including gaining Essential Skills Wales (ESW, and Key Skills (KS) and personal development modules. Having met the full range of requirements of the Core components, 8,747 or 88% of the candidates who completed the course achieved the Welsh Baccalaureate Advanced Core Certificate. In 2012, a record 7,210 or 73% of candidates achieved the Welsh Baccalaureate Intermediate Diploma, compared with 67% in 2011. The number of candidates completing the programme also rose to 9,940, an increase of 3,937 or 66% on 2011. A further 990 candidates achieved the Welsh Baccalaureate Core Certificate. At Foundation level, 3,521 candidates completed the programme, an increase of 23% compared with 2,858 last year. Of these, 2,236 or 64% achieved the Foundation Diploma, compared with 1,873 or 66% last year. A further 279 candidates achieved the Core Certificate at the Foundation level.  Research and evaluation Academic research= Research on the Welsh Baccalaureate has been generally positive. The University of Bath were the internal evaluators and produced a number of reports evaluating the development of the Welsh Baccalaureate. A Final Report of the External Evaluation of the Welsh Baccalaureate Qualification (WBQ) Pilot was also carried out by the University of Nottingham. Both internal and external evaluations were largely positive, emphasising the positive impact of the Welsh Bac in broadening the learner experience. Estyn reports on the Advanced Level (2012) and the Welsh Bac in Key Stage 4 in schools (2008, were generally positive about the impact of the qualification, although there were some concerns about the differences in quality of delivery in Welsh Bac centres. In 2009, the Nuffield Foundation funded a Review of 14–19 Education and Training in which the Welsh Bac was praised. The report calls for a baccalaureate system for secondary schools; asks why many young people drop out of education and training in their late teens; and offers contrasts between England's approach to school reform and that which has operated in Wales since Devolution. Among the Review's recommendations was that \\"England should learn from the Welsh attempts to incorporate in its 'Learning Pathways' a broader and more flexible vision of progression.\\" The Review supports the continued development of the Welsh Baccalaureate so that it becomes the organising framework for all 14 – 19 learners in Wales. The current affairs programme 'Dragon's Eye' broadcast 1 May 2012, reported on work published by Dr Chris Taylor and colleagues at Wales Institute of Social & Economic Research, Data & Methods (WISERD) based at Cardiff University. Dr Taylor's work suggested that the performance of Welsh Bac qualified students did not match their apparent A level points score. One explanation is that since the Welsh Bac is ungraded, students who pass it cover a wide range of abilities and ability is known to be a strong predictor of success at university. Dr Taylor commented \\"This suggests that the WBQ would benefit from being graded.\\" He added \\"Our findings also raise a concern about the overall quality of the WBQ and whether there are any apparent benefits of this qualification on university progress and outcomes.\\" The conclusions in the Report were however qualified by a recognition of the limitations of the analysis. Dr Taylor added \\"We would not want to argue that the WBQ is systematically worth less than an A grade at A Level. And indeed, rejecting the use of the WBQ in helping to determine entry and conditional offers ignores the 'opportunity cost' for a student of not having taken another qualification or A Level.\\" Following the publication of the Report, Cardiff University clarified their position regarding Welsh Baccalaureate applicants. The 2012–13 prospectus states that \\"Cardiff University accepts the Welsh Baccalaureate Advanced Diploma for admission to all its undergraduate degree programmes. If you are taking the Welsh Baccalaureate Advanced Diploma, and the University decides to make you an offer for study on any of its programme, the offer will be based on a pass in the Core plus specified grades and subjects, where applicable, in the Options.\\" In 2004, UCAS confirmed that the Advanced Level would attract 120 UCAS points. The 2009 Expert Group Report for Review of Award in the UCAS Tariff confirmed the award of 120 UCAS tariff points for the Welsh Baccalaureate Advanced Diploma. In 2018, Welsh exams watchdog Qualifications Wales said the skills at the heart of the qualification were highly relevant for future study and employment, but that the Welsh Baccalaureate is too complex and a number of pupils, teachers and parents do not understand it. =Debate= In 2002, Colin Jenkins and John David, who developed the original Welsh Baccalaureate proposal for the Institute of Welsh Affairs (IWA), criticised the Welsh Bac because it did not follow their model, based on the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme. They said they were disappointed and considered the Welsh Bac to be \\"missing a huge opportunity.\\"Disappointment over the Welsh bac TES, 11 May 2008 They considered the WBQ to be a \\"feeble quick fix\\", \\"not a baccalaureate\\", and as \\"Curriculum 2000 with a bit of icing\\".

Jones added that the WBQ was \\"really an A level with a load of nonsense added on\\" and added: “It isn’t a proper Bac where students at 18 would still be required to study maths, English, a science and a language, not meaningless Mickey Mouse additions.

If that’s what he thought at the time, he should hang his head in shame for putting in a bid from the WJEC to run the Welsh Bac.

She made her first appearance on 18 September 2000. Zoe arrives in Walford along with her father, Charlie (Derek Martin), sisters Kat (Jessie Wallace), Lynne (Elaine Lordan) and Little Mo (Kacey Ainsworth), and grandmother Mo (Laila Morse). It later emerges that Zoe is in fact Kat's daughter, born after Kat was raped by her uncle Harry (Michael Elphick), and was adopted by Kat's parents, Charlie and Viv. This was nominated for \\"Best Storyline\\" at the British Soap Awards as well as winning \\"Best Single Episode\\" in 2002. Another highly proclaimed storyline was Zoe's friendship with Kelly Taylor (Brooke Kinsella). In 2003, Zoe and Kelly made headlines in the UK, in a New Year's Eve episode that was filmed on-location in Scotland. In the storyline, Zoe, Kelly and others, travel from London to Scotland but their minibus crashes, leaving them stranded and injured on the freezing cold Scottish moors. While stranded, Kelly cares for an injured Zoe and they become overemotional – and kiss. The episode featuring their kiss attracted 9.5 million viewers, and the precise moment that they kissed was watched by 44% of the available viewing audience. One of Zoe's subsequent major storylines was when she became romantically involved with local hardman Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman), which soon ended after Zoe ended up being entrapped in an affair with Dennis' father Den Watts (Leslie Grantham) – though not before he pressured her into claiming that she is pregnant with Dennis' baby, as part of his last- ditch attempt to stop his devoted adopted daughter Sharon (Letitia Dean) from leaving Albert Square; Dennis and Sharon had embarked on a forbidden romance during the former's relationship with Zoe. When Zoe starts to worry that Dennis will discover her secret, Den persuades Zoe to sleep with him so she can get pregnant – up to the point where he blackmails her with the threat of exposing her secret to Dennis. Although Zoe is forced to relent to Den's blackmail, Dennis ends up seeing them in bed together and ends their relationship. Her final storyline revolved around Den's murder on the show's 18th anniversary episode, after Zoe conspired with his estranged wife Chrissie (Tracy-Ann Oberman) and their best-friend Sam Mitchell (Kim Medcalf) to get revenge on Den for the way how he victimized them during his antics. Their plan resulted in Zoe seemingly killing Den in The Queen Victoria public house after he attacked Chrissie; however, when Zoe left his corpse behind, Den regained consciousness until Chrissie ultimately killed him for good – shortly before Zoe reappeared in the room where he was murdered. Soon afterwards, Zoe leaves Walford for Ibiza after making amends with Kat and Dennis. Storylines Zoe Slater first arrived in Walford in September 2000 with her family, which consists of her sisters Kat (Jessie Wallace), Lynne (Elaine Lordan) and Little Mo (Kacey Ainsworth); their father Charlie (Derek Martin), and grandmother Mo (Laila Morse) Over a year later, Zoe and Kat argue about Zoe's decision to move away from Walford to live with her uncle Harry (Michael Elphick). Kat tells Zoe she cannot go but Zoe walks out. Kat follows and blurts out that she is Zoe's real mother. She then explains that she fell pregnant at 13 after Harry raped her, thus revealing that Harry is her father. Zoe is shell-shocked, and Kat slashes her wrists in despair. Zoe runs away, unable to take in all the recent revelations. While away, Zoe contacts Little Mo – the only other member of the family who did not know about Zoe's parentage – who persuades Zoe to come home, but after another argument with Kat, Zoe leaves again. She ends up living on the streets where she is discovered sick and penniless by Roxy Drake (Tracy Brabin), a pimp determined to recruit Zoe. Roxy provides Zoe with meals and cigarettes, finds her a flat and forces her to prostitute herself. Roxy and fellow prostitute Kelly Taylor (Brooke Kinsella) dress and make-up Zoe, but she gets drunk and vomits on her client. Kat arrives the next day to take Zoe home, but Roxy tries to prevent her taking Zoe, so Kat headbutts her. Zoe gets engaged to Anthony Trueman (Nicholas Bailey), but leaves yet again, returning several months later, this time with Kelly in tow, and her engagement to Anthony is broken off. She briefly dates Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman), but he is secretly in love with his adoptive half-sister Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean), and they eventually reveal their relationship. Sharon and Dennis' father Den Watts (Leslie Grantham) suggests that to keep Dennis, Zoe should claim she is pregnant, since Sharon is infertile. The plan works but Zoe worries Dennis will realise she is not pregnant, and he refuses to sleep with her. Den offers to sleep with her so she can get pregnant and pretend the baby is Dennis's. Dennis catches them in bed together and leaves, but not before telling Den's wife, Chrissie Watts (Tracy Ann Oberman). Chrissie persuades Zoe to abort the baby and tells her they should team up for revenge on Den. They get together with Sam Mitchell (Kim Medcalf) to do this, meeting up in The Queen Victoria pub. Chrissie sends for Sharon, claiming Den is on his deathbed. She finds out that it isn't true and, upon learning what her father did to Dennis and Zoe, disowns Den before leaving Walford once more; Chrissie had planned this to rid Den of Sharon as payback for cheating on her for Zoe. Right after Sharon leaves, Den realizes what Chrissie did and proceeds to attack her – smashing her head against the jukebox. Zoe stops him by attacking him with a metal doorstop, supposedly killing him. She runs off and Sam goes after her to calm her down. However, he is not dead, and he grabs Chrissie. She hits him again with the doorstop, finally killing Den. Following his murder, Zoe is led to believe that she killed Den – though Sam sees Chrissie kill Den and eventually tells Zoe, who punches Chrissie. Zoe leaves for Ibiza after having an emotional goodbye from Kat while Chrissie is eventually caught out and charged with Den's murder, and Sam subsequently goes on the run. In 2015, Kat reveals that Zoe has moved to Spain and announces to Mo and Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner) that she will start saving up to visit Zoe. However, Mo tells Stacey that Zoe does not want to see Kat. Mo attempts to contact Zoe to get her to reconsider, but Kat finds out two days later from a text from Zoe that she cannot see her because of her new job and boyfriend and she feels she needs to move on with her life. In May 2015, Kat visits the convent where she give birth to Zoe and it is revealed to the viewers that Kat had twins – meaning Zoe has a twin brother. Kat moves to Spain and visits Zoe, who rejects her mother, leaving Kat devastated. Kat also reveals that Zoe is now engaged. Creation and characterisation The character of Zoe and the rest of the Slater family were created during workshops with Tony Jordan and John Yorke. London actors were invited to improvise in groups, and the characters were created during these improvisations.EastEnders Revealed: The Slaters Special. Michelle Ryan was cast as Zoe, and made her first on-screen appearance on 18 September 2000. The family consisted of, grandmother Mo Harris (Laila Morse), father Charlie (Derek Martin), his five children, Lynne (Elaine Lordan), Kat (Jessie Wallace), Little Mo (Kacey Ainsworth), Zoe (Ryan), Belinda (Leanne Lakey), who was to be introduced to EastEnders at a later date, as well as Lynne's boyfriend Garry Hobbs (Ricky Groves). It later transpired that Kat was the mother of Zoe, after being raped by her uncle Harry Slater (Michael Elphick). According to the BBC's head of drama series, Mal Young, the family was brought in as the serial did not \\"have enough solid families in the soap, there were a lot of fractured families and people who were alone.\\" Ryan was cast in the role of Zoe after the character was developed at an improvisation session for thirty actors and actresses earlier in the year. He choose Lordan, Wallace, Ainsworth, Ryan and Lakey as the five sisters as they got on so well at the sessions. The actors performed a Nolan Sister's routine at the session, which was \\"later included on EastEnders as part of one of the Queen Vic's karaoke nights\\". The character is described as bolshy, defiant and a vivacious teenager who makes an impression on the men of Walford. Development In 2001, an upcoming storyline, involving Zoe and Kat, when Zoe asks if she can live with Harry. The News of the World reported that Kat would tell Zoe that she was actually her mother and that Harry had raped her when she was 13. An EastEnders source said, \\"Zoe thinks her mother is dead—but the truth is very different.\\" In 2002, a story where Zoe runs away with Anthony to get married in secret was announced. That year, Ryan was rested from the soap on doctor's orders, by agreement from Louise Berridge, the executive producer, Ryan and her parents. Plans for character developments between Zoe and Anthony were delayed and plans for their on-screen marriage were pushed back, with the wedding storyline being re-written. In September that year, Ryan said she would return and was looking forward to it, and Berridge said she was \\"delighted\\" and hoped viewers would look forward to Zoe being reunited with the rest of her family. =Notable relationships=Kelly Taylor The friendship between Zoe and Kelly Taylor (Brooke Kinsella) was a recurring storyline for both characters. In the British press, Kelly and Zoe were compared to two former popular characters, who also shared a close screen friendship, Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer) and Tiffany Mitchell (Martine McCutcheon). Kinsella has commented, \\"It is nice to be compared because they were great [characters] but, hopefully, [Michelle Ryan] and I will bring our own characters to light and show what we can do. We have so much in common and we balance each other out – when she's crazy I'll calm her down and vice- versa. It's worked well, which is why Kelly has been kept on, which is great for me but also for Michelle because she's got somebody to have fun with. Kelly's been one of the slowest developing characters and that's been good for me. I wasn't thrown into it and having Michelle has been great for me.\\" A storyline featuring a kiss between Kelly and Zoe was featured in a New Year's Eve episode that was filmed on-location in Scotland. In the storyline, a group of teenagers travel from London to Scotland for New Year's Eve, but their minibus crashes, leaving them stranded and injured on the freezing cold Scottish moors. While stranded, Kelly cares for an injured Zoe, they become overemotional, and kiss. Kinsella explained the reasons behind the kiss: \\"They're stuck in the hills, thinking they're going to die—it's a way of saying goodbye and also of showing how much they love each other as friends. Which is quite sweet really.\\" She claimed that the kiss was made easier due to the fact that she was kissing her off-screen best friend: \\"That made it so much easier. We thought we were just going to be laughing and giggling the whole way through, but we were very professional. It was so cold that we just wanted to get it over with. We were shaking from cold—not from nerves—and it was raining, so we just thought, 'Let's do it and get it done with'. [...] We laugh about it now. When it came down to it, the truth was that it was just like any other screen kiss.\\" The episode featuring their kiss attracted 9.5 million viewers, and the precise moment that they kissed was watched by 44% of the available viewing audience. Dennis Rickman and Den Watts In September 2004, a Christmas storyline created by Berridge that was to show Zoe fall pregnant with Dennis Rickman's (Nigel Harman) baby was axed by Berridge's successor, Kathleen Hutchison. Instead, Zoe was to be seduced by Dennis's father, Den (Leslie Grantham). An EastEnders insider revealed: \\"Dirty Den lives up to his name by seducing Zoe. He makes his move when she comments how handsome he looks for his age. But they are caught in the act by Dennis who is shocked and disgusted to see his dad snogging his girlfriend.\\" Hutchison decided that Den would be killed off in a storyline involving three people plotting to kill him. The storyline saw Zoe, Chrissie and Sam plot his death, and a source said, \\"The three girls team up after deciding they have to get rid of Den but viewers will be left wondering who the actual killer is. They plot and scheme to give themselves alibis and exact their revenge for what Den has done to them.\\" =Departure= Michelle Ryan, pictured here in 2009, decided to leave her role as Zoe in 2005. It was thought that Ryan was going to quit the soap after several reports of her leaving EastEnders. One of her friends who spoke in September 2004 revealed, \\"Without sounding arrogant, Michelle believes she has the looks and talent to succeed at the highest level. She has been in EastEnders for four years but sees her future very much in films and modelling. She realises the show has put her on the map but doesn't want to be typecast. \\"Because of her soap commitments she's had to turn down dozens of great modelling offers and feels her soap role is now holding her back. Michelle's happy to honour her contract but then will make the jump.\\" On 29 January 2005 it was announced after a lot of speculation that Ryan, along with Kim Medcalf (Sam), would be leaving. A source for the show said, \\"Michelle [Ryan] has made no secret of her plans to leave the soap in recent months. Despite her character being at the centre of some of the show's biggest storylines, the actress is now considering a modelling career.\\" The source added, \\"Michelle is hot property and has been inundated with offers of other acting work. She's also had several offers of lucrative modelling projects.\\" Speaking about her decision to quit she told The Sun, Everyone knew it was time for me to go and I knew it was time for me to move on.\\"Then Jessie [Wallace], who plays my screen mum Kat, said, 'You're young, so get out there. Now's the time to go for it. You're only young once and you can't stay here forever.' \\"I've grown up in EastEnders. I've been here for four years, so I will miss everybody. But you get that feeling and when you know it's time to spread your wings and fly, you need to do that. Everyone says I'm doing the right thing.\\" Her exit storyline was revealed saying,\\"She leaves because she can't stand everyone knowing what she did in order to persuade Dennis not to leave her,\\" an insider told the newspaper. \\"It is truly gripping stuff and there won't be a dry eye in the house on the night.\\" Since her departure she told the Bristol Evening Post that she has no plans to return saying,\\"I just got quite bored in the end, to be honest. Doing the same thing day in, day out. It's just so boring. I like to jump from different things.\\" \\"I always saw EastEnders as an apprenticeship,\\" she told the Daily Record. \\"I always wanted to go on and do different things. I have some really good friends from that show but the door is closed.\\" She said: \\"I've always taken chances. I think that's how you progress – by stepping out and doing different things. I really do like my freedom and jumping from job to job. I just want to work with people I admire and respect, wherever that be – big budget, low budget, leading role, supporting role.\\" Speculated returns The press reported on 18 April 2010 that Ryan was approached by the producers of \\"EastEnders\\" to return for a month around the Christmas period that year, coinciding with the return of Zoe's on-screen mother Kat Slater and her husband Alfie Moon. A BBC spokeswoman denied this, saying, \\"Speculation is rife about returning characters but this is not true. However, as with all characters, we would never say never.\\" Talking about these rumours she replied,\\"No, [it's] not for me.\\" It was again reported in August 2011, that Ryan was returning, for a Christmas special. They reported that she was \\"excited\\" over possible storylines with Wallace and Richie. A BBC spokesperson dismissed the rumours, telling Digital Spy that there are no plans for Zoe to return. In April 2017, Ryan called for Zoe to be recast. In popular culture The character of Zoe Slater has been spoofed in the cartoon sketch show 2DTV. Reception In 2002, Zoe and Kat's storyline was nominated for 'Best Storyline' at the British Soap Awards, but lost out to the bullying plot in Brookside. The episode where the truth about Kat being Zoe's mother won 'Best Single Episode'. For her portrayal of Zoe, Ryan was nominated in the category of \\"Best Actress\\" at the 2005 British Soap Awards. For EastEnders 25th anniversary in 2010, Zoe finding out about her mother was voted the greatest EastEnders moment by What's on TV. Also the EastEnders website named the moment where Kat told Zoe that she was her mother one of the most 'dramatic endings'. The kiss between Zoe and Kelly received criticism. Lesbian news site AfterEllen.com branded it a \\"gratuitous ratings-stunt\\" and said \\"The writers bottled out and the two young women dismissed it as a one-off, assuring each other that neither of them was 'like that,' leaving lesbian and bisexual viewers feeling cheated. This was a wasted opportunity, a chance to explore an emotionally complex situation between best friends that became just another exploitive TV moment instead.\\" In an interview about homosexual television characters in The Guardian, scriptwriter Daran Little criticised lesbians in British soaps: \\"Most lesbian characters are so lipstick. They start off straight and, lo and behold, they just can't resist it. You can see the straight fantasy at work behind the character\\". Journalist Paul Flynn stated that Zoe was an example of this, describing her as a \\"tabloid-friendly 18-year-old—who [...] brushed with lesbianism for all of five minutes.\\" Kinsella defended the kiss in an interview, commenting, \\"It's not a gratuitous ratings getting move, it's not some kind of big lesbian kiss. It's the way two best friends who have a lot of love for each other show their emotions.\\" See also * List of EastEnders characters (2000) ReferencesExternal links * Category:EastEnders characters Category:Teenage characters in television Category:Fictional market stallholders Category:Fictional offspring of incestuous relationships Category:Fictional offspring of rape Category:Fictional twins Category:Television characters introduced in 2000 Category:Female characters in television ","title":"Zoe Slater"},{"id":"2484709","text":"Flattop Jones, Sr. is a fictional villain created by Chester Gould for the Dick Tracy comic strip. His nickname comes from his large head that is perfectly flat on the top.  Background of fictional character  FBI files. Gould revealed little about Flattop's personal life in the comic strip, but the background references that he did give the character share similarities to real-life Depression-era gangster Pretty Boy Floyd. For example, Flattop claims in the strip to be a freelance hitman from \\"Crookston Hills\\", a parody version of Floyd's hometown of Cookson Hills in Oklahoma. The comic strip also references Flattop's involvement in the \\"Kansas City Massacre,\\" a 1933 incident in which Floyd was alleged to have been involved.Wallis, Michael. \\"Floyd, Charles Arthur (1904-1934)\\" , Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture (accessed March 4, 2010). Flattop was based on Pretty Boy Floyd.  Appearances in the comic strip  Gould's character leads a gang of three hoods and is known as an \\"ace killer\\" in one newspaper headline shown in the comic strip (having committed five murders). In the storyline in which Flattop is the featured villain, black marketeers hire him to eliminate Dick Tracy for a fee of $5000: five times his regular rate. Flattop proves his value by quickly orchestrating a successful setup involving an argument over money to capture Tracy in the killer's car, to be transported somewhere where he can be murdered undisturbed. Fortunately for Tracy, Flattop stops just short of doing the deed when he realizes that if his employers are willing to pay such a high price for Tracy's death, then they would surely be desperate enough to pay much more. As such, Flattop decides to blackmail his employers for an additional $50,000, lest he release the detective with the information Tracy needs to arrest them. Hiding in a boarding room while the transaction is completed, Tracy learns that a resident living with her mother downstairs is a WAC who is learning Morse code. Taking advantage of an available piano in the room, he plays it and stamps on the floor in code as if keeping time to his music, hoping that the WAC below, Margie Elong, will recognize the call for help. Sure enough, Elong and her mother get the message and alert the police. However, even as Tracy's partner, Pat Patton, is preparing for a rescue; Flattop, having closed his blackmail deal, prepares to shoot Tracy while he is surrounded by his henchmen. On Flattop's count of three, Tracy interrupts the assassination by lunging at the killer and wrestles for his gun. In the struggle, Tracy manages to kill a henchman, \\"Machine Gun\\" Eddie, with a Tommy gun, using it to kill the rest of Flattop's gang even as the police were storming the hideout. While the police tend to Tracy, the detective suggests that it be publicly announced that he was found dead, anticipating that Flattop's employers would contact the killer soon afterward. The black marketeers take the bait, call Flattop's number to invite him for a celebration and the police quickly arrive to arrest the lot of them. However, Flattop escapes and becomes a hunted fugitive hampered by his extremely distinctive appearance. This leads to a long chase, during which Flattop stays in a boarding house while being extorted by the crooked child, Bud Jenkins, who is hiding him. The child drowns in a lake while skating with expensive new skates he buys with the blackmail money. This leads Tracy to the boarding house, forcing Flattop to flee. In a comic relief episode Flattop decides to hide his $50,000 in an old family album that he has hollowed out, as he is afraid that if he goes out with this much money he might be mugged; when Tracy visits the boarding house to question the dead boy's mother about her son flashing $50 bills around town, a reporter in need of a good picture of the deceased finds the money in the album. When questioned, the mother realizes that the money could only have come from her roomer, forcing Flattop to flee the scene just as Tracy storms the room. This begins a chase sequence that lasts for six months beginning at the end of 1943. First, Flattop hides in a chimney and is stung by bees in a hive that he disturbs there. Then, slipping away stung and covered in honey, Flattop forces a street hawker selling gasoline as fraudulent cleaning fluid to use it to clean him, then murders the hawker to fake his own death and to steal his victim's war bonds. Eventually, Flattop hides out in a hotel, but the war bonds blow out a window and betray his location. In desperation as the police officer reports this to headquarters, he hides in the room of Vitamin Flintheart, an aging ham actor. After attempting to explain his trespass, Flattop assaults Flintheart and uses his makeup supplies for a disguise. Tracy, Patton and Flintheart continue the search and battle Flattop after almost being fooled by a child to whom Flattop had passed off his disguise in hopes of making him a decoy. Flattop is severely wounded, but is successfully treated in custody. Loath to let Flattop slip into oblivion, Gould managed to find a way to continue the story. The comic strip details Flattop's escape from custody, the taking of Flintheart hostage, and his hiding in the harbor area. Eventually, on May 14, 1944, Flattop is drowned attempting to flee Tracy, after getting trapped between two struts of a replica of the Santa Maria.\\"Big Deals: Comics’ Highest-Profile Moments\\" , Hogan's Alley #7 In the original story, comic relief is afforded by Vitamin Flintheart, who cons Officer Murphy and then Flattop into buying him vitamin pills and, when asked to repay, always answers, \\"Charge it\\". More relief is afforded by Flintheart who, while trapped on the Santa Maria replica, claims he cannot swim since he fell into his aunt's lily pond at a tender age. In a 1986 storyline, reporter Wendy Wichel approaches Dick Tracy with new information concerning Flattop and an incident in World War II which was kept secret and in which Tracy was involved. Before Flattop encountered Tracy in 1944, Flattop was hired by the Nazi spy Boche, a.k.a. Pruneface, to kidnap FBI Agent Jim Trailer, a close friend of Dick Tracy's, and a scientist Trailer and Tracy were protecting: Professor Roloc Bard. Flattop's instructions were to kill Trailer and hand the professor over to Pruneface. Bard warned Flattop that he will be shipped overseas to make deadly weapons for the Axis cause, which caused Flattop to double-cross Pruneface and auction Bard and Trailer off to the highest bidder. Authorities in Washington, DC, ostensibly participating in the auction, authorized Tracy to negotiate while they traced Flattop's call. Tracy and his partner, Pat Patton, broke into Flattop's hideout and freed Trailer, while Flattop escaped with the Professor. Flattop tied Bard up in the same replica of the Santa Maria where he would later drown. Flattop's last appearance in this storyline was his meeting with Pruneface to collect his $50,000 and tell him where to find Bard. Pruneface swore that he would kill Flattop if he ever dared to betray him again.  Characters created because of Flattop  As a response to Flattop's popularity, Gould created a large family for the character, most of whom were also equally bizarre hardened criminals. These included: *Flattop Jr. - The son of Flattop, an engineering genius who had customized his car into an arsenal of equipment designed to keep him ahead of the law. His accomplice during his crime wave was Joe Period, who Flattop Jr. left to be captured by Dick Tracy and partner Sam Catchem. Flattop Jr. was driven insane by the ghost of a girl he killed, to the point that his hair turned white. He was killed in self-defense by Tracy's new partner Lizz Worthington who was also the sister of the girl who was murdered by Flattop Jr. *Stilleta \\"Mrs. Flattop\\" Jones - The widow of Flattop Jones and the mother of Flattop Jr. and Angelica \\"Angeltop\\" Jones and a former circus performer bent on revenge for the deaths of her husband and children. She was recently killed while fighting with Sprocket Nitrate over trying to force her to be an accomplice on the planned kidnapping of Dick Tracy's grandson Dick \\"Trey\\" Tracy III, after which Sprocket killed her by throwing a 100-pound metal film can at her. *Unnamed sister- Looks exactly like Flattop and Sharptop (possible triplet), real name was never given, but was referred to by Tracy as \\"Auntie Flattop\\". Took care of her nephew Flattop Jr. after Flattop drowned and, like her other cousin Sharptop, seemed like a law-abiding person. She genuinely cared about her nephew and was heartbroken when he turned to crime. *Blowtop - A brother of Flattop whose distinctive feature was an explosive temper that caused him to rage at the slightest provocation, but only on trivialities; he took legitimate criticism on important matters without complaint. Blowtop was responsible for the kidnapping of Junior Tracy and the arson of Tracy's home. Like his brother Flattop, he has dealt with Vitamin Flintheart, who traded his shirt full of money for a shrunken head. He served 20 years in jail and later reformed. He rejected his niece Angeltop's plan to kill Tracy with the Brow's son and has not been seen since. He recently resurfaced by having his sister- in-law Stilleta living with him and was nearly murdered by her after an argument with her on a planned kidnapping of Dick Tracy's newborn grandson Dick \\"Trey\\" Tracy III. *Angeltop - Angelica \\"Angeltop\\" Jones, the daughter of Flattop who has a head of equivalent dimensions, not including her fuller hair, sought to murder Dick Tracy in revenge for the death of her father and Policewoman Lizz for killing her brother. Angelica had arrived to do a television interview about her book My Life as Flattop's Daughter. Junior Tracy and Vitamin Flintheart were in the same studio, and Angelica's boyfriend, the Brow's son, shot Vitamin Flintheart. After a fire on the Santa Maria replica in the lake (the same place where her father drowned under) nearly killed her after an attempt to murder Tracy, she had plastic surgery by crooked doctor Willis Carver, whom she later killed. She was arrested later and was killed in a shoot-out in an aftermath of an intense manhunt after the murder of her soon to be ex-husband. *Hi-Top - The son of Angeltop and an unnamed African-American jazz musician who was murdered by Angeltop after she found out that he was planning to divorce her and also planned to take sole custody of the infant Hi-Top. Hi-Top is, consequently, the grandson of Flattop. He is introduced as the leader of a black street gang, and is recruited by \\"Little Boy\\", the alleged grandson of Tracy's original arch-enemy \\"Big Boy\\" Caprice, alongside Restless Mahoney, the niece of another iconic Tracy villain; Breathless Mahoney. Together, the three form a brief triumvirate of legacies to Tracy's rogues gallery. *Sharptop - A third Jones brother (Flattop's identical twin) who grew up right, became a college professor, and was apparently possessed by the ghost of his brother during a seance held by Gravel Gertie's vegan, female chauvinistic, New Age enthusiast niece, Crystal. *Poptop - The beer-guzzling father of Flattop, Auntie Flattop, Blowtop, and Sharptop, the father-in-law of Stilleta, the grandfather of Flattop Jr. and Angeltop, the uncle of Frizzletop, and the great-grandfather of Hi-Top.

Life Born at Blackheath, he belonged to an old Caithness family, the Traills of Rattar, and his father, James Traill, was the stipendiary magistrate of Greenwich and Woolwich Police Court. He was sent to the Merchant Taylors' School, where he rose to be head of the school and obtained a scholarship at St. John's College, Oxford. Initially destined for the profession of medicine, Traill took his degree in natural sciences in 1865 but then he read for the bar and was called in 1869. In 1871 he received an appointment as an Inspector of Returns for the Board of Education, a position which left him leisure to cultivate his gift for literature. In 1873 he became a contributor to the Pall Mall Gazette, then under the editorship of Frederick Greenwood. He followed Greenwood to the St. James's Gazette when in 1880 the Pall Mall Gazette took for a time the Liberal side, and he continued to contribute to that paper up to 1895. In the meantime he had also joined the staff of the Saturday Review, to which he sent, among other writings, weekly verses upon subjects of the hour. Some of the best of these he republished in 1882 in a volume called Recaptured Rhymes, and others in a later collection of Saturday Songs (1890). He was also a leader-writer for the Daily Telegraph and edited The Observer from 1889 until 1891, which experienced an increase in circulation during his time there. In 1897, he became first editor of Literature, when that weekly paper (afterwards sold and incorporated with the Academy) was established by the proprietors of The Times, and directed its fortunes until his death. Traill's long connection with journalism must not obscure the fact that he was a man of letters rather than a journalist. He wrote best when he wrote with least sense of the burden of responsibility. His playful humour and his ready wit were only given full scope when he was writing to please himself. One of his most brilliant jeux d'esprit was a pamphlet which was published without his name soon after he had begun to write for the newspapers. It was called The Israelitish Question and the Comments of the Canaan Journals thereon (1876). This told the story of the Exodus in articles which parodied very cleverly the style of all the leading journals of the day, and was at once recognized as the work of a born humorist. Traill sustained this reputation with The New Lucian, which appeared in 1884 (2nd ed., with several new dialogues, 1900); but for the rest his labors were upon more serious lines. He directed the production of a vast work on Social England in 1893-1898; he wrote, for several series of biographies, studies of Coleridge (1884), Sterne (1882), William III (1888), Shaftesbury (1886), Strafford (1889), and Lord Salisbury (1891); he compiled a biography of Sir John Franklin, the Arctic explorer (1896); and after a visit to Egypt he published a volume on the country, and in 1897 appeared his book on Lord Cromer, the man who had done so much to bring it back to prosperity. Of these the literary studies are the best, for Traill possessed great critical insight. He published two collections of essays: Number Twenty (1892), and The New Fiction (1897). In 1865 his Glaucus, a tale of a Fish, was produced at the Olympic Theatre with Miss Nellie Farren in the part of Glaucus. In conjunction with Mr. Robert Hichens he wrote The Medicine Man, produced at the Lyceum in 1898. He died in London on 21 February 1900. He also edited the Centenary edition of the Works of Thomas Carlyle (30 volumes, Chapman and Hall, 1896-1907), writing introductions to the various works.

Biography Paul DeMayo was nicknamed \\"Quadzilla\\" for the size of his quadriceps. Born and raised in Malden, Massachusetts, United States, DeMayo first competed in bodybuilding when he placed 1st in the Teenage Massachusetts State championships. His first National Physique Committee (NPC) event was in 1988, where he took 7th place in the NPC Junior USA heavyweight class. He took 1st place in the NPC Nationals Championship event in 1994. His only Mr. Olympia was in 1995, when he placed 12th. DeMayo appeared in many fitness and magazine articles, including being featured on the cover of Iron Man. Death DeMayo died on June 2, 2005 in Boston from a heroin overdose. According to people close to him, DeMayo's problems started when his wife left him and he returned to Boston after he moved to California with her to train in Gold's Gym. He then was signed to an endorsement contract by sports nutritional supplement company Met-Rx and forced to compete in the 1995 Mr. Olympia against his wishes. He placed 12th and retired shortly afterwards. DeMayo spent two years in the Billerica House of Correction (Middlesex County Jail) for shooting his gun in the air after an argument with his girlfriend and possession of percodan. Some months before his death he told friends he was working at Gold's Gym on Lansdowne Street in Boston, but it was revealed later that he was fired several months earlier due to a substance abuse problem.

It was the sector regulator for health services in England. Its chief executive was Ian Dalton and it was chaired by Dido Harding. Monitor was merged with the NHS Trust Development Authority to form NHS Improvement on 1 April 2016. History The body was established in 2004 under the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003, which made it responsible for authorising, monitoring and regulating NHS foundation trusts. The Health and Social Care Act 2012 gave Monitor additional duties. In addition to assessing NHS trusts for foundation trust status and ensuring that foundation trusts are well led, in terms of quality and finances, Monitor had a duty to: * set prices for NHS-funded care in partnership with NHS England; * enable integrated care; * safeguard patient choice and prevent anti-competitive behaviour which is against the interests of patients; and * support commissioners to protect essential health care services for patients if a provider gets into financial difficulties. Monitor's main tool for carrying out these functions was the NHS provider licence, which contains obligations for providers of NHS services. The 2012 Act requires everyone who provides an NHS health care service to hold a licence unless they are exempt under regulations made by the Department of Health. Foundation trusts were licensed from 1 April 2013, and all other non- exempt providers were required to apply for a licence from April 2014. It was announced in June 2015 that the chief executive posts at Monitor and the NHS Trust Development Authority were to be merged, although there would not be a complete merger of the organisations. In April 2016 both organisations became part of NHS Improvement. Criticism In July 2014, Monitor was criticised by the Public Accounts Committee of the House of Commons (PAC) for the lack of clinical expertise and frontline NHS experience amongst its staff.House of Commons Public Accounts Committee (2014) “Public Accounts Committee - Fourth Report. Monitor: regulating NHS Foundation Trusts”, Conclusions and Recommendations (4). Prepared 4 July 2014. Retrieved 10 July 2014 The PAC noted that: “Only 21 of Monitor's 337 staff have an NHS operational background and only 7 have a clinical background, which damages Monitor's credibility in dealing with trusts and its effectiveness in diagnosing problems and developing solutions”.House of Commons Public Accounts Committee (2014) “Public Accounts Committee - Fourth Report. Monitor: regulating NHS Foundation Trusts”, Conclusions and Recommendations (4), Prepared 4 July 2014. Retrieved 10 July 2014 The PAC also criticised the proportion of Monitor’s budget spent on external consultants (£9 million of Monitor's £48 million budget in 2013-14) and found that “some NHS foundation trusts had been allowed to struggle for far too long in breach of their regulatory conditions. It has taken Monitor too long to help trusts in difficulty to improve, with three trusts having been in breach of their regulatory conditions since 2009”.House of Commons Public Accounts Committee (2014) “Public Accounts Committee - Fourth Report. Monitor: regulating NHS Foundation Trusts”, Conclusions and Recommendations (2), Prepared 4 July 2014. Retrieved 10 July 2014 At the time of the PAC’s hearing, of 147 foundation trusts 39(26%) were expected to be in deficit by the end of 2013-14 and on 31 December 2013 25 (17%) were in breach of the conditions attached to their status.House of Commons Public Accounts Committee (2014) “Public Accounts Committee - Fourth Report.

Retrieved 10 July 2014 The board of MONITOR has a majority representation from former or seconded employees of KPMG, PWC and Deloitte while still awarding contracts to these organisations worth millions of pounds.http://www.reasonandreality.org/?p=2400  Regulatory action  In July 2013 six NHS foundation trusts were placed in special measures as a result of the Keogh Review of patient safety: * Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust * Burton Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust * Medway NHS Foundation Trust * Northern Lincolnshire and Goole Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust * Sherwood Forest Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust * Tameside Hospital NHS Foundation Trust Subsequent trusts placed in special measures: * The Queen Elizabeth Hospital King’s Lynn NHS Foundation Trust October 2013 * East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust August 2014 Enforcement action has been taken on 21 occasions in the first 10 months of 2013/4, compared to just nine instances in the whole of 2012-13. Monitor's former chief executive David Bennett admitted the regulator’s “arm’s length” distance from foundation trusts had become “a little shorter” as it intervened more readily and that increased monitoring and intervention was explained by “a declined appetite for risk” among “Parliament, the government and the public”. Details of the regulatory action Monitor has taken at NHS foundation trusts are available on its website: http://www.monitor.gov.uk/about-your-local-nhs- foundation-trust/regulatory-action/nhs-foundation-trusts-special-measures-or- un. In August 2015 Monitor issued a letter to all Foundation Trusts telling them to fill vacancies “only where essential” and warning that current financial plans are “quite simply unaffordable” as NHS providers collectively forecast a deficit of £2bn in 2015-16.  Stafford Hospital investigation  In 2010 the Stafford Hospital scandal investigation recommended that Monitor de-authorise the Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust. In line with the investigation report recommendation, Secretary of State for Health, Andy Burnham, agreed to a further Independent Inquiry of the commissioning, supervisory and regulatory bodies for Foundation Trusts. Anti-competitive behaviour Spire Healthcare alleged in 2013 that a block contract agreed between Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and the clinical commissioning groups in Blackpool, and Fylde and Wyre offered a “clear incentive” for GPs to refer patients to the foundation trust and that this was anti-competitive behaviour. The contract provided the trust with a guaranteed income regardless of the number of patients that chose to use its services. Monitor conducted an investigation and decided In September 2014 that there was no evidence to support the claim though they did conclude that Blackpool CCG’s plans did not “go far enough” to ensure patients would be offered choice, or that the right to choice would be “publicised and promoted”. Blackpool CCG complained that not a single GP, practice manager or patient was spoken to by the investigating team, nor was a single practice visited. In September 2014 former chief executive David Bennett admitted that the organisation had yet to identify a strategy to counter those opposed to competition because it clashed with their personal ideologies. He claimed organisations were using competition regulations as an “easy excuse” for avoiding making necessary changes. In October 2014 after the publication of NHS England's ‘Five year forward view’ Bennett defended Choice and competition as \\"one of the ways in which we can drive change and improvement for patients, and we don’t see that that will cease to be the case” - though competition was not mentioned by NHS England. He also said that Monitor, the NHS Trust Development Authority and NHS England planned to develop “a whole system, geographically based intervention regime” which could, include a ‘special measures’ approach to areas facing serious problems with care.

Popular \\"algos\\" include Percentage of Volume, Pegged, VWAP, TWAP, Implementation shortfall and Target close. In the twenty-first century, algorithmic trading has been gaining traction with both retail and institutional traders. It is widely used by investment banks, pension funds, mutual funds, and hedge funds that may need to spread out the execution of a larger order or perform trades too fast for human traders to react to. A study in 2016 showed that over 80% of trading in the FOREX market was performed by trading algorithms rather than humans. The term algorithmic trading is often used synonymously with automated trading system. These encompass trading strategies such as black box trading and Quantitative, or Quant, trading that are heavily reliant on complex mathematical formulas and high-speed computer programs.The New Financial Industry, Alabama Law Review, available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2417988Lemke and Lins, \\"Soft Dollars and Other Trading Activities,\\" § 2:30 (Thomson West, 2015–2016 ed.). Such systems run strategies including market making, inter-market spreading, arbitrage, or pure speculation such as trend following. Many fall into the category of high- frequency trading (HFT), which is characterized by high turnover and high order-to-trade ratios.Lemke and Lins, \\"Soft Dollars and Other Trading Activities,\\" § 2:31 (Thomson West, 2015–2016 ed.). HFT strategies utilize computers that make elaborate decisions to initiate orders based on information that is received electronically, before human traders are capable of processing the information they observe. As a result, in February 2012, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) formed a special working group that included academics and industry experts to advise the CFTC on how best to define HFT.Futures Trading Commission Votes to Establish a New Subcommittee of the Technology Advisory Committee (TAC) to focus on High Frequency Trading, February 9, 2012, Commodity Futures Trading Commission Algorithmic trading and HFT have resulted in a dramatic change of the market microstructure, particularly in the way liquidity is provided.  History  Early developments = Computerization of the order flow in financial markets began in the early 1970s, when the New York Stock Exchange introduced the \\"designated order turnaround\\" system (DOT). SuperDOT was introduced in 1984 as an upgraded version of DOT. Both systems allowed for the routing of orders electronically to the proper trading post. The \\"opening automated reporting system\\" (OARS) aided the specialist in determining the market clearing opening price (SOR; Smart Order Routing). With the rise of fully electronic markets came the introduction of program trading, which is defined by the New York Stock Exchange as an order to buy or sell 15 or more stocks valued at over US$1 million total. In practice, program trades were pre-programmed to automatically enter or exit trades based on various factors. In the 1980s, program trading became widely used in trading between the S&P; 500 equity and futures markets in a strategy known as index arbitrage. At about the same time portfolio insurance was designed to create a synthetic put option on a stock portfolio by dynamically trading stock index futures according to a computer model based on the Black–Scholes option pricing model. Both strategies, often simply lumped together as \\"program trading\\", were blamed by many people (for example by the Brady report) for exacerbating or even starting the 1987 stock market crash. Yet the impact of computer driven trading on stock market crashes is unclear and widely discussed in the academic community. = Refinement and growth = The financial landscape was changed again with the emergence of electronic communication networks (ECNs) in the 1990s, which allowed for trading of stock and currencies outside of traditional exchanges. In the U.S., decimalization changed the minimum tick size from 1/16 of a dollar (US$0.0625) to US$0.01 per share in 2001, and may have encouraged algorithmic trading as it changed the market microstructure by permitting smaller differences between the bid and offer prices, decreasing the market- makers' trading advantage, thus increasing market liquidity. This increased market liquidity led to institutional traders splitting up orders according to computer algorithms so they could execute orders at a better average price. These average price benchmarks are measured and calculated by computers by applying the time-weighted average price or more usually by the volume- weighted average price. A further encouragement for the adoption of algorithmic trading in the financial markets came in 2001 when a team of IBM researchers published a paper at the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence where they showed that in experimental laboratory versions of the electronic auctions used in the financial markets, two algorithmic strategies (IBM's own MGD, and Hewlett-Packard's ZIP) could consistently out-perform human traders. MGD was a modified version of the \\"GD\\" algorithm invented by Steven Gjerstad & John Dickhaut in 1996/7; the ZIP algorithm had been invented at HP by Dave Cliff (professor) in 1996. In their paper, the IBM team wrote that the financial impact of their results showing MGD and ZIP outperforming human traders \\"...might be measured in billions of dollars annually\\"; the IBM paper generated international media coverage. In 2005, the Regulation National Market System was put in place by the SEC to strengthen the equity market. This changed the way firms traded with rules such as the Trade Through Rule, which mandates that market orders must be posted and executed electronically at the best available price, thus preventing brokerages from profiting from the price differences when matching buy and sell orders. As more electronic markets opened, other algorithmic trading strategies were introduced. These strategies are more easily implemented by computers, because machines can react more rapidly to temporary mispricing and examine prices from several markets simultaneously. Chameleon (developed by BNP Paribas), Stealth (developed by the Deutsche Bank), Sniper and Guerilla (developed by Credit Suisse), arbitrage, statistical arbitrage, trend following, and mean reversion are examples of algorithmic trading strategies.  Emblematic examples  Profitability projections by the TABB Group, a financial services industry research firm, for the US equities HFT industry were US$1.3 billion before expenses for 2014, significantly down on the maximum of US$21 billion that the 300 securities firms and hedge funds that then specialized in this type of trading took in profits in 2008, which the authors had then called \\"relatively small\\" and \\"surprisingly modest\\" when compared to the market's overall trading volume.

A third of all European Union and United States stock trades in 2006 were driven by automatic programs, or algorithms. As of 2009, studies suggested HFT firms accounted for 60–73% of all US equity trading volume, with that number falling to approximately 50% in 2012.Rob Iati, The Real Story of Trading Software Espionage , AdvancedTrading.com, July 10, 2009Times Topics: High- Frequency Trading, The New York Times, December 20, 2012 In 2006, at the London Stock Exchange, over 40% of all orders were entered by algorithmic traders, with 60% predicted for 2007. American markets and European markets generally have a higher proportion of algorithmic trades than other markets, and estimates for 2008 range as high as an 80% proportion in some markets. Foreign exchange markets also have active algorithmic trading, measured at about 80% of orders in 2016 (up from about 25% of orders in 2006).A London Hedge Fund That Opts for Engineers, Not M.B.A.'s by Heather Timmons, August 18, 2006 Futures markets are considered fairly easy to integrate into algorithmic trading, with about 20% of options volume expected to be computer- generated by 2010. Bond markets are moving toward more access to algorithmic traders. Algorithmic trading and HFT have been the subject of much public debate since the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said in reports that an algorithmic trade entered by a mutual fund company triggered a wave of selling that led to the 2010 Flash Crash. The same reports found HFT strategies may have contributed to subsequent volatility by rapidly pulling liquidity from the market. As a result of these events, the Dow Jones Industrial Average suffered its second largest intraday point swing ever to that date, though prices quickly recovered. (See List of largest daily changes in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.) A July 2011 report by the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), an international body of securities regulators, concluded that while \\"algorithms and HFT technology have been used by market participants to manage their trading and risk, their usage was also clearly a contributing factor in the flash crash event of May 6, 2010.\\" However, other researchers have reached a different conclusion. One 2010 study found that HFT did not significantly alter trading inventory during the Flash Crash. Some algorithmic trading ahead of index fund rebalancing transfers profits from investors.  Strategies  Trading ahead of index fund rebalancing = Most retirement savings, such as private pension funds or 401(k) and individual retirement accounts in the US, are invested in mutual funds, the most popular of which are index funds which must periodically \\"rebalance\\" or adjust their portfolio to match the new prices and market capitalization of the underlying securities in the stock or other index that they track. Profits are transferred from passive index investors to active investors, some of whom are algorithmic traders specifically exploiting the index rebalance effect. The magnitude of these losses incurred by passive investors has been estimated at 21–28bp per year for the S&P; 500 and 38–77bp per year for the Russell 2000. John Montgomery of Bridgeway Capital Management says that the resulting \\"poor investor returns\\" from trading ahead of mutual funds is \\"the elephant in the room\\" that \\"shockingly, people are not talking about\\". = Pairs trading = Pairs trading or pair trading is a long-short, ideally market-neutral strategy enabling traders to profit from transient discrepancies in relative value of close substitutes. Unlike in the case of classic arbitrage, in case of pairs trading, the law of one price cannot guarantee convergence of prices. This is especially true when the strategy is applied to individual stocks – these imperfect substitutes can in fact diverge indefinitely. In theory the long-short nature of the strategy should make it work regardless of the stock market direction. In practice, execution risk, persistent and large divergences, as well as a decline in volatility can make this strategy unprofitable for long periods of time (e.g. 2004-2007). It belongs to wider categories of statistical arbitrage, convergence trading, and relative value strategies. = Delta-neutral strategies = In finance, delta-neutral describes a portfolio of related financial securities, in which the portfolio value remains unchanged due to small changes in the value of the underlying security. Such a portfolio typically contains options and their corresponding underlying securities such that positive and negative delta components offset, resulting in the portfolio's value being relatively insensitive to changes in the value of the underlying security. = Arbitrage = In economics and finance, arbitrage is the practice of taking advantage of a price difference between two or more markets: striking a combination of matching deals that capitalize upon the imbalance, the profit being the difference between the market prices. When used by academics, an arbitrage is a transaction that involves no negative cash flow at any probabilistic or temporal state and a positive cash flow in at least one state; in simple terms, it is the possibility of a risk-free profit at zero cost. Example: One of the most popular Arbitrage trading opportunities is played with the S&P; futures and the S&P; 500 stocks. During most trading days these two will develop disparity in the pricing between the two of them. This happens when the price of the stocks which are mostly traded on the NYSE and NASDAQ markets either get ahead or behind the S&P; Futures which are traded in the CME market.  Conditions for arbitrage  Arbitrage is possible when one of three conditions is met: * The same asset does not trade at the same price on all markets (the \\"law of one price\\" is temporarily violated). * Two assets with identical cash flows do not trade at the same price. * An asset with a known price in the future does not today trade at its future price discounted at the risk-free interest rate (or, the asset does not have negligible costs of storage; as such, for example, this condition holds for grain but not for securities). Arbitrage is not simply the act of buying a product in one market and selling it in another for a higher price at some later time. The long and short transactions should ideally occur simultaneously to minimize the exposure to market risk, or the risk that prices may change on one market before both transactions are complete. In practical terms, this is generally only possible with securities and financial products which can be traded electronically, and even then, when first leg(s) of the trade is executed, the prices in the other legs may have worsened, locking in a guaranteed loss. Missing one of the legs of the trade (and subsequently having to open it at a worse price) is called 'execution risk' or more specifically 'leg-in and leg-out risk'. In the simplest example, any good sold in one market should sell for the same price in another. Traders may, for example, find that the price of wheat is lower in agricultural regions than in cities, purchase the good, and transport it to another region to sell at a higher price. This type of price arbitrage is the most common, but this simple example ignores the cost of transport, storage, risk, and other factors. \\"True\\" arbitrage requires that there be no market risk involved. Where securities are traded on more than one exchange, arbitrage occurs by simultaneously buying in one and selling on the other. Such simultaneous execution, if perfect substitutes are involved, minimizes capital requirements, but in practice never creates a \\"self-financing\\" (free) position, as many sources incorrectly assume following the theory. As long as there is some difference in the market value and riskiness of the two legs, capital would have to be put up in order to carry the long-short arbitrage position. = Mean reversion = Mean reversion is a mathematical methodology sometimes used for stock investing, but it can be applied to other processes. In general terms the idea is that both a stock's high and low prices are temporary, and that a stock's price tends to have an average price over time. An example of a mean-reverting process is the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic equation. Mean reversion involves first identifying the trading range for a stock, and then computing the average price using analytical techniques as it relates to assets, earnings, etc. When the current market price is less than the average price, the stock is considered attractive for purchase, with the expectation that the price will rise. When the current market price is above the average price, the market price is expected to fall. In other words, deviations from the average price are expected to revert to the average. The standard deviation of the most recent prices (e.g., the last 20) is often used as a buy or sell indicator. Stock reporting services (such as Yahoo! Finance, MS Investor, Morningstar, etc.), commonly offer moving averages for periods such as 50 and 100 days. While reporting services provide the averages, identifying the high and low prices for the study period is still necessary. = Scalping = Scalping is liquidity provision by non-traditional market makers, whereby traders attempt to earn (or make) the bid-ask spread. This procedure allows for profit for so long as price moves are less than this spread and normally involves establishing and liquidating a position quickly, usually within minutes or less. A market maker is basically a specialized scalper. The volume a market maker trades is many times more than the average individual scalper and would make use of more sophisticated trading systems and technology. However, registered market makers are bound by exchange rules stipulating their minimum quote obligations. For instance, NASDAQ requires each market maker to post at least one bid and one ask at some price level, so as to maintain a two-sided market for each stock represented. = Transaction cost reduction = Most strategies referred to as algorithmic trading (as well as algorithmic liquidity-seeking) fall into the cost-reduction category. The basic idea is to break down a large order into small orders and place them in the market over time. The choice of algorithm depends on various factors, with the most important being volatility and liquidity of the stock. For example, for a highly liquid stock, matching a certain percentage of the overall orders of stock (called volume inline algorithms) is usually a good strategy, but for a highly illiquid stock, algorithms try to match every order that has a favorable price (called liquidity-seeking algorithms). The success of these strategies is usually measured by comparing the average price at which the entire order was executed with the average price achieved through a benchmark execution for the same duration. Usually, the volume-weighted average price is used as the benchmark. At times, the execution price is also compared with the price of the instrument at the time of placing the order. A special class of these algorithms attempts to detect algorithmic or iceberg orders on the other side (i.e. if you are trying to buy, the algorithm will try to detect orders for the sell side). These algorithms are called sniffing algorithms. A typical example is \\"Stealth\\". Some examples of algorithms are VWAP, TWAP, Implementation shortfall, POV, Display size, Liquidity seeker, and Stealth. Modern algorithms are often optimally constructed via either static or dynamic programming .Jackie Shen (2013), A Pre-Trade Algorithmic Trading Model under Given Volume Measures and Generic Price Dynamics (GVM-GPD), available at SSRN or DOI. Jackie Shen and Yingjie Yu (2014), Styled Algorithmic Trading and the MV-MVP Style, available at SSRN. Jackie (Jianhong) Shen (2017), Hybrid IS-VWAP Dynamic Algorithmic Trading via LQR, available at SSRN. = Strategies that only pertain to dark pools = Recently, HFT, which comprises a broad set of buy-side as well as market making sell side traders, has become more prominent and controversial. These algorithms or techniques are commonly given names such as \\"Stealth\\" (developed by the Deutsche Bank), \\"Iceberg\\", \\"Dagger\\", \\"Guerrilla\\", \\"Sniper\\", \\"BASOR\\" (developed by Quod Financial) and \\"Sniffer\\". Dark pools are alternative trading systems that are private in nature—and thus do not interact with public order flow—and seek instead to provide undisplayed liquidity to large blocks of securities.Lemke and Lins, \\"Soft Dollars and Other Trading Activities,\\" § 2:29 (Thomson West, 2015–2016 ed.). In dark pools trading takes place anonymously, with most orders hidden or \\"iceberged\\".Rob Curren, Watch Out for Sharks in Dark Pools, The Wall Street Journal, August 19, 2008, p. c5. Available at WSJ Blogs retrieved August 19, 2008 Gamers or \\"sharks\\" sniff out large orders by \\"pinging\\" small market orders to buy and sell. When several small orders are filled the sharks may have discovered the presence of a large iceberged order. \\"Now it's an arms race,\\" said Andrew Lo, director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Laboratory for Financial Engineering. \\"Everyone is building more sophisticated algorithms, and the more competition exists, the smaller the profits.\\"Artificial intelligence applied heavily to picking stocks by Charles Duhigg, November 23, 2006 = Market timing = Strategies designed to generate alpha are considered market timing strategies. These types of strategies are designed using a methodology that includes backtesting, forward testing and live testing. Market timing algorithms will typically use technical indicators such as moving averages but can also include pattern recognition logic implemented using Finite State Machines. Backtesting the algorithm is typically the first stage and involves simulating the hypothetical trades through an in-sample data period. Optimization is performed in order to determine the most optimal inputs. Steps taken to reduce the chance of over optimization can include modifying the inputs +/- 10%, schmooing the inputs in large steps, running monte carlo simulations and ensuring slippage and commission is accounted for. Forward testing the algorithm is the next stage and involves running the algorithm through an out of sample data set to ensure the algorithm performs within backtested expectations. Live testing is the final stage of development and requires the developer to compare actual live trades with both the backtested and forward tested models. Metrics compared include percent profitable, profit factor, maximum drawdown and average gain per trade.  High-frequency trading  As noted above, high-frequency trading (HFT) is a form of algorithmic trading characterized by high turnover and high order-to- trade ratios. Although there is no single definition of HFT, among its key attributes are highly sophisticated algorithms, specialized order types, co- location, very short-term investment horizons, and high cancellation rates for orders. In the U.S., high-frequency trading (HFT) firms represent 2% of the approximately 20,000 firms operating today, but account for 73% of all equity trading volume. As of the first quarter in 2009, total assets under management for hedge funds with HFT strategies were US$141 billion, down about 21% from their high.Geoffrey Rogow, Rise of the (Market) Machines, The Wall Street Journal, June 19, 2009 The HFT strategy was first made successful by Renaissance Technologies. High-frequency funds started to become especially popular in 2007 and 2008. Many HFT firms are market makers and provide liquidity to the market, which has lowered volatility and helped narrow Bid- offer spreads making trading and investing cheaper for other market participants. HFT has been a subject of intense public focus since the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission stated that both algorithmic trading and HFT contributed to volatility in the 2010 Flash Crash. Among the major U.S. high frequency trading firms are Chicago Trading Company, Optiver, Virtu Financial, DRW, Jump Trading, Two Sigma Securities, GTS, IMC Financial and Citadel LLC. There are four key categories of HFT strategies: market-making based on order flow, market-making based on tick data information, event arbitrage and statistical arbitrage. All portfolio-allocation decisions are made by computerized quantitative models. The success of computerized strategies is largely driven by their ability to simultaneously process volumes of information, something ordinary human traders cannot do. = Market making = Market making involves placing a limit order to sell (or offer) above the current market price or a buy limit order (or bid) below the current price on a regular and continuous basis to capture the bid-ask spread. Automated Trading Desk, which was bought by Citigroup in July 2007, has been an active market maker, accounting for about 6% of total volume on both NASDAQ and the New York Stock Exchange. = Statistical arbitrage = Another set of HFT strategies in classical arbitrage strategy might involve several securities such as covered interest rate parity in the foreign exchange market which gives a relation between the prices of a domestic bond, a bond denominated in a foreign currency, the spot price of the currency, and the price of a forward contract on the currency. If the market prices are different enough from those implied in the model to cover transaction cost then four transactions can be made to guarantee a risk-free profit. HFT allows similar arbitrages using models of greater complexity involving many more than 4 securities. The TABB Group estimates that annual aggregate profits of low latency arbitrage strategies currently exceed US$21 billion. A wide range of statistical arbitrage strategies have been developed whereby trading decisions are made on the basis of deviations from statistically significant relationships. Like market-making strategies, statistical arbitrage can be applied in all asset classes. = Event arbitrage = A subset of risk, merger, convertible, or distressed securities arbitrage that counts on a specific event, such as a contract signing, regulatory approval, judicial decision, etc., to change the price or rate relationship of two or more financial instruments and permit the arbitrageur to earn a profit.Event Arb Definition Amex.com, September 4, 2010 Merger arbitrage also called risk arbitrage would be an example of this. Merger arbitrage generally consists of buying the stock of a company that is the target of a takeover while shorting the stock of the acquiring company. Usually the market price of the target company is less than the price offered by the acquiring company. The spread between these two prices depends mainly on the probability and the timing of the takeover being completed as well as the prevailing level of interest rates. The bet in a merger arbitrage is that such a spread will eventually be zero, if and when the takeover is completed. The risk is that the deal \\"breaks\\" and the spread massively widens. = Spoofing = One strategy that some traders have employed, which has been proscribed yet likely continues, is called spoofing. It is the act of placing orders to give the impression of wanting to buy or sell shares, without ever having the intention of letting the order execute to temporarily manipulate the market to buy or sell shares at a more favorable price. This is done by creating limit orders outside the current bid or ask price to change the reported price to other market participants. The trader can subsequently place trades based on the artificial change in price, then canceling the limit orders before they are executed. Suppose a trader desires to sell shares of a company with a current bid of $20 and a current ask of $20.20. The trader would place a buy order at $20.10, still some distance from the ask so it will not be executed, and the $20.10 bid is reported as the National Best Bid and Offer best bid price. The trader then executes a market order for the sale of the shares they wished to sell. Because the best bid price is the investor's artificial bid, a market maker fills the sale order at $20.10, allowing for a $.10 higher sale price per share. The trader subsequently cancels their limit order on the purchase he never had the intention of completing. = Quote stuffing = Quote stuffing is a tactic employed by malicious traders that involves quickly entering and withdrawing large quantities of orders in an attempt to flood the market, thereby gaining an advantage over slower market participants. The rapidly placed and canceled orders cause market data feeds that ordinary investors rely on to delay price quotes while the stuffing is occurring. HFT firms benefit from proprietary, higher-capacity feeds and the most capable, lowest latency infrastructure. Researchers showed high-frequency traders are able to profit by the artificially induced latencies and arbitrage opportunities that result from quote stuffing.  Low latency trading systems  Network-induced latency, a synonym for delay, measured in one-way delay or round-trip time, is normally defined as how much time it takes for a data packet to travel from one point to another.High-Speed Devices and Circuits with THz Applications by Jung Han Choi Low latency trading refers to the algorithmic trading systems and network routes used by financial institutions connecting to stock exchanges and electronic communication networks (ECNs) to rapidly execute financial transactions. Most HFT firms depend on low latency execution of their trading strategies. Joel Hasbrouck and Gideon Saar (2013) measure latency based on three components: the time it takes for (1) information to reach the trader, (2) the trader's algorithms to analyze the information, and (3) the generated action to reach the exchange and get implemented. In a contemporary electronic market (circa 2009), low latency trade processing time was qualified as under 10 milliseconds, and ultra-low latency as under 1 millisecond. Low-latency traders depend on ultra-low latency networks. They profit by providing information, such as competing bids and offers, to their algorithms microseconds faster than their competitors. The revolutionary advance in speed has led to the need for firms to have a real-time, colocated trading platform to benefit from implementing high- frequency strategies. Strategies are constantly altered to reflect the subtle changes in the market as well as to combat the threat of the strategy being reverse engineered by competitors. This is due to the evolutionary nature of algorithmic trading strategies – they must be able to adapt and trade intelligently, regardless of market conditions, which involves being flexible enough to withstand a vast array of market scenarios. As a result, a significant proportion of net revenue from firms is spent on the R&D; of these autonomous trading systems.  Strategy implementation  Most of the algorithmic strategies are implemented using modern programming languages, although some still implement strategies designed in spreadsheets. Increasingly, the algorithms used by large brokerages and asset managers are written to the FIX Protocol's Algorithmic Trading Definition Language (FIXatdl), which allows firms receiving orders to specify exactly how their electronic orders should be expressed. Orders built using FIXatdl can then be transmitted from traders' systems via the FIX Protocol.FIXatdl – An Emerging Standard, FIXGlobal, December 2009 Basic models can rely on as little as a linear regression, while more complex game-theoretic and pattern recognition or predictive models can also be used to initiate trading. More complex methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo have been used to create these models.  Issues and developments  Algorithmic trading has been shown to substantially improve market liquidity among other benefits. However, improvements in productivity brought by algorithmic trading have been opposed by human brokers and traders facing stiff competition from computers. = Cyborg finance = Technological advances in finance, particularly those relating to algorithmic trading, has increased financial speed, connectivity, reach, and complexity while simultaneously reducing its humanity. Computers running software based on complex algorithms have replaced humans in many functions in the financial industry. Finance is essentially becoming an industry where machines and humans share the dominant roles – transforming modern finance into what one scholar has called, \\"cyborg finance\\".Lin, Tom C.W., The New Investor, 60 UCLA 678 (2013), available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2227498 = Concerns = While many experts laud the benefits of innovation in computerized algorithmic trading, other analysts have expressed concern with specific aspects of computerized trading. > \\"The downside with these systems is their black box-ness,\\" Mr. Williams > said. \\"Traders have intuitive senses of how the world works.

Algorithmic and high-frequency trading were shown to have contributed to volatility during the May 6, 2010 Flash Crash, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged about 600 points only to recover those losses within minutes. At the time, it was the second largest point swing, 1,010.14 points, and the biggest one-day point decline, 998.5 points, on an intraday basis in Dow Jones Industrial Average history.

In July 2007, Citigroup, which had already developed its own trading algorithms, paid $680 million for Automated Trading Desk, a 19-year- old firm that trades about 200 million shares a day.Siemon's Case Study Automated Trading Desk, accessed July 4, 2007 Citigroup had previously bought Lava Trading and OnTrade Inc. In late 2010, The UK Government Office for Science initiated a Foresight project investigating the future of computer trading in the financial markets, led by Dame Clara Furse, ex-CEO of the London Stock Exchange and in September 2011 the project published its initial findings in the form of a three-chapter working paper available in three languages, along with 16 additional papers that provide supporting evidence. All of these findings are authored or co-authored by leading academics and practitioners, and were subjected to anonymous peer-review. Released in 2012, the Foresight study acknowledged issues related to periodic illiquidity, new forms of manipulation and potential threats to market stability due to errant algorithms or excessive message traffic. However, the report was also criticized for adopting \\"standard pro-HFT arguments\\" and advisory panel members being linked to the HFT industry.  System architecture  A traditional trading system consists primarily of two blocks – one that receives the market data while the other that sends the order request to the exchange. However, an algorithmic trading system can be broken down into three parts: # Exchange # The server # Application Exchange(s) provide data to the system, which typically consists of the latest order book, traded volumes, and last traded price (LTP) of scrip. The server in turn receives the data simultaneously acting as a store for historical database. The data is analyzed at the application side, where trading strategies are fed from the user and can be viewed on the GUI. Once the order is generated, it is sent to the order management system (OMS), which in turn transmits it to the exchange. Gradually, old-school, high latency architecture of algorithmic systems is being replaced by newer, state-of-the-art, high infrastructure, low-latency networks. The complex event processing engine (CEP), which is the heart of decision making in algo-based trading systems, is used for order routing and risk management. With the emergence of the FIX (Financial Information Exchange) protocol, the connection to different destinations has become easier and the go-to market time has reduced, when it comes to connecting with a new destination. With the standard protocol in place, integration of third-party vendors for data feeds is not cumbersome anymore.  Effects  Though its development may have been prompted by decreasing trade sizes caused by decimalization, algorithmic trading has reduced trade sizes further. Jobs once done by human traders are being switched to computers. The speeds of computer connections, measured in milliseconds and even microseconds, have become very important. More fully automated markets such as NASDAQ, Direct Edge and BATS (formerly an acronym for Better Alternative Trading System) in the US, have gained market share from less automated markets such as the NYSE. Economies of scale in electronic trading have contributed to lowering commissions and trade processing fees, and contributed to international mergers and consolidation of financial exchanges. Competition is developing among exchanges for the fastest processing times for completing trades. For example, in June 2007, the London Stock Exchange launched a new system called TradElect that promises an average 10 millisecond turnaround time from placing an order to final confirmation and can process 3,000 orders per second.\\"LSE leads race for quicker trades\\" by Alistair MacDonald The Wall Street Journal Europe, June 19, 2007, p.3 Since then, competitive exchanges have continued to reduce latency with turnaround times of 3 milliseconds available. This is of great importance to high- frequency traders, because they have to attempt to pinpoint the consistent and probable performance ranges of given financial instruments. These professionals are often dealing in versions of stock index funds like the E-mini S&Ps;, because they seek consistency and risk-mitigation along with top performance. They must filter market data to work into their software programming so that there is the lowest latency and highest liquidity at the time for placing stop-losses and/or taking profits. With high volatility in these markets, this becomes a complex and potentially nerve-wracking endeavor, where a small mistake can lead to a large loss. Absolute frequency data play into the development of the trader's pre-programmed instructions. In the U.S., spending on computers and software in the financial industry increased to $26.4 billion in 2005. Algorithmic trading has caused a shift in the types of employees working in the financial industry. For example, many physicists have entered the financial industry as quantitative analysts. Some physicists have even begun to do research in economics as part of doctoral research. This interdisciplinary movement is sometimes called econophysics. Some researchers also cite a \\"cultural divide\\" between employees of firms primarily engaged in algorithmic trading and traditional investment managers. Algorithmic trading has encouraged an increased focus on data and had decreased emphasis on sell- side research.  Communication standards  Algorithmic trades require communicating considerably more parameters than traditional market and limit orders. A trader on one end (the \\"buy side\\") must enable their trading system (often called an \\"order management system\\" or \\"execution management system\\") to understand a constantly proliferating flow of new algorithmic order types. The R&D; and other costs to construct complex new algorithmic orders types, along with the execution infrastructure, and marketing costs to distribute them, are fairly substantial. What was needed was a way that marketers (the \\"sell side\\") could express algo orders electronically such that buy-side traders could just drop the new order types into their system and be ready to trade them without constant coding custom new order entry screens each time. FIX Protocol is a trade association that publishes free, open standards in the securities trading area. The FIX language was originally created by Fidelity Investments, and the association Members include virtually all large and many midsized and smaller broker dealers, money center banks, institutional investors, mutual funds, etc. This institution dominates standard setting in the pretrade and trade areas of security transactions. In 2006–2007 several members got together and published a draft XML standard for expressing algorithmic order types. The standard is called FIX Algorithmic Trading Definition Language (FIXatdl).

Albert Vannice The catalytic cycle is the main method for describing the role of catalysts in biochemistry, organometallic chemistry, bioinorganic chemistry, materials science, etc. Since catalysts are regenerated, catalytic cycles are usually written as a sequence of chemical reactions in the form of a loop. In such loops, the initial step entails binding of one or more reactants by the catalyst, and the final step is the release of the product and regeneration of the catalyst. Articles on the Monsanto process, the Wacker process, and the Heck reaction show catalytic cycles. Catalytic cycle for conversion of A and B into C. A catalytic cycle is not necessarily a full reaction mechanism. For example, it may be that the intermediates have been detected, but it is not known by which mechanisms the actual elementary reactions occur. Precatalysts Precatalysts are not catalysts but are precursors to catalysts. Precatalysts are converted in the reactor to the actual catalytic species. The identification of catalysts vs precatalysts is an important theme in catalysis research. The conversion of a precatalyst to a catalyst is often called catalyst activation. Many metal halides are precatalysts for olefin polymerization, see Kaminsky catalyst and Ziegler-Natta catalysis. The precatalysts, e.g. titanium trichloride, are activated by organoaluminium compounds, which function as catalyst activators. Metal oxides are often classified as catalysts, but in fact are almost always precatalysts. Applications include olefin metathesis and hydrogenation. The metal oxides require some activating reagent, usually a reducing agent, to enter the catalytic cycle. Often catalytic cycles show the conversion of a precatalyst to the catalyst. Sacrificial catalysts Often a so-called sacrificial catalyst is also part of the reaction system with the purpose of regenerating the true catalyst in each cycle. As the name implies, the sacrificial catalyst is not regenerated and is irreversibly consumed, thereby not a catalyst at all. This sacrificial compound is also known as a stoichiometric catalyst when added in stoichiometric quantities compared to the main reactant. Usually the true catalyst is an expensive and complex molecule and added in quantities as small as possible. The stoichiometric catalyst on the other hand should be cheap and abundant. \\"Sacrificial catalysts\\" are more accurately referred to by their actual role in the catalytic cycle, for example as a reductant, a terminal oxidant, or an initiator.

Written by series creator Seth MacFarlane and directed by Peter Shin, a rough-cut version of this episode originally aired on December 20, 1998, on the Fox network in the United States; a final version was later aired as a sneak peek of the show on January 31, 1999, following Super Bowl XXXIII. In the episode, Peter loses his job after drinking too much at a stag party and falls asleep at work. He signs up for welfare to keep his wife Lois from finding out, but gets much more money than he expected. After spending his money foolishly Lois finds out and Peter decides to dump it from a blimp at the Super Bowl. He is arrested for welfare fraud and must await his family's rescue, as well as various performers who would later serve as frequent recurring and guest voices on the series. It was the first overall episode to be animated by Film Roman, Inc. and Sunwoo Digital International, through its animation division Grimsaem Animation Co. The basis for \\"Death Has a Shadow\\", as well as Family Guy a whole, was MacFarlane's thesis film The Life of Larry, created in 1995 while he was a student at the Rhode Island School of Design. A sequel was conceived in 1996 called Larry & Steve, which aired in 1997 as a segment of Cartoon Network's World Premiere Toons. Both shorts caught the attention of Fox, who contacted MacFarlane in 1998 to develop a series based on the films. A hand-drawn pilot was created by MacFarlane with a budget of $50,000, which led to the series being accepted for production and the pilot being remade and extended into its broadcast form. Critical responses to the episode were mostly positive. According to Nielsen ratings, it was viewed by 22 million viewers during its original airing in the United States. In the tenth season episode \\"Back to the Pilot\\", which premiered on November 13, 2011, Brian and Stewie go back in time to the events of \\"Death Has a Shadow\\".SO NOVEMBER, SO FOX Plot As Lois prepares dinner, Stewie puts the final touches on his mind-control device, only for it to be taken away from him by Lois, who won't allow 'toys' at the table. Later, Peter asks Lois for permission to attend an upcoming stag party. After he promises he won't drink, Lois lets him go. Unfortunately, Peter forgets his promise to Lois and plays such drinking games as \\"Drink the beer\\". He goes to work the next day with a hangover, and falls asleep on the job as a safety inspector in a toy factory. Peter misses dangerous objects such as a butcher knife, a surge protector, a gasoline can, razor blades, a porcupine, a toaster with forks inside and a plug in water. The company receives bad press after releasing unsafe toy products, and Peter is promptly fired by Mr. Weed. At dinner, Peter breaks the news to his children, but decides to keep it from Lois. He tries different jobs, such as cereal mascot and sneeze guard, but fails miserably. Brian pressures him to tell her the truth, but all he manages to do is to tell Lois how fat she is. Brian insists that Peter must look out for his family's welfare. With the word \\"welfare\\" in his mind, Peter soon applies for government assistance at a welfare office. But a processing error creates a weekly check for $150,000, which is based on a remark former President Ronald Reagan made of a women called Linda Taylor from Chicago, Illinois, calling her a \\"welfare queen\\" by making assumptions of earning such proportions from government benefits in 1974. Telling Lois he received a big raise, Peter spends his money on many foolish and extravagant things, such as renting the Statue of David, treating Meg to cosmetic surgery and even going so far as to surround his house with a moat to protect them from the Black Knight. Unfortunately, Lois is given the welfare check by the mail lady and storms at Peter for lying to her. Peter decides to return the money to the taxpayers by dumping it from a blimp during Super Bowl XXXIII while Brian accompanies him. After the commotion they cause, they are immediately shot down. Eventually, Lois receives the bad news and goes to court, still angry at Peter for lying to her in the first place. After Peter apologizes for lying to Lois and accepting the money instead of reporting the welfare error, the judge sentences him to 24 months in prison for welfare fraud. Lois, Brian, Chris and Meg exclaim, \\"Oh no!\\" but the Kool Aid Man bursts through the courthouse wall and exclaims, \\"Oh yeah!\\" Lois tries to explain he's not that bad and she loves him, and insists that, no matter what, she will always stand by her husband. The judge agrees, and sends her to jail with him. Stewie, being a baby, must have his parents by his side, regardless of his burning hate for them, especially Lois. He then whips out his mind control device and forces the judge into letting his father go free and get his job back. Peter states that he has learned his lesson and will never do it again. Instead he is going to try for such things as a minority scholarship, a sexual harassment suit, and a disability claim. Background MacFarlane initially conceived Family Guy in 1995 while studying animation under the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD). During college, he created his thesis film entitled The Life of Larry, which was later submitted by his professor at RISD to Hanna-Barbera, which led to MacFarlane being hired by the company.\\"\\"Family Guy\\" Seth MacFarlane to speak at Class Day: Creator and executive producer of 'Family Guy' will headline undergraduate celebration . Harvard Gazette. Retrieved 2007-12-21. In 1996, MacFarlane created a sequel to The Life of Larry entitled Larry and Steve, which featured a middle-aged character named Larry and an intellectual dog, Steve. The short was broadcast in 1997 as one of Cartoon Network's World Premiere Toons. In 1997, while writing for Carol, MacFarlane planned to develop the Larry shorts into a short film series for MADtv; however, the project was abandoned because the show did not possess a large enough budget to make any kind of animation. As development continued, the genre gradually shifted to a prime-time series, while the characters of Larry and Steve formed the basis for Peter and Brian, respectively. During the year, a Hanna-Barbera development executive introduced MacFarlane to alternative comedians Mike Darnell and Leslie Collins in an attempt to get Hanna-Barbera back into the prime-time business. The executives were unimpressed; a year later, MacFarlane contacted Collins at Fox; she arranged a meeting with him and the company executives to create a series based on the characters entitled Family Guy. Fox proposed MacFarlane complete a 15-minute short, and gave him a budget of $50,000. After the pilot aired, the series was greenlighted. Premises were drawn from several 1980s Saturday morning cartoons MacFarlane had watched as a child, such as The Fonz and the Happy Days Gang and Rubik, the Amazing Cube. Production Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane wrote the episode. Production of the pilot for Family Guy began in 1998, and took six months. Recalling the experience in an interview with The New York Times, MacFarlane stated, Upon completion of the pilot, the series went on the air. \\"Death Has a Shadow\\" was the first episode of Family Guy to be aired. It was written by creator MacFarlane, and was the first episode to be directed by Peter Shin. The episode guest starred Lori Alan as Diane Simmons, Carlos Alazraqui as Mr. Weed, Mike Henry as Cleveland Brown, Billy West, Fred Tatasciore, Joey Slotnick, Phil LaMarr, Wally Wingert, and fellow cartoonist Butch Hartman as various characters. The episode aired after Super Bowl XXXIII on January 31, 1999. For \\"Death Has a Shadow\\", several changes were made from the original pilot pitch. For the series, Lois was a redhead, as opposed to the original pilot, where she was a blonde. In the original pilot, Lois discovered that Peter lost his job, and by the end of the episode, he fails to get a new one nor does he apply for welfare. The idea for Peter to apply for welfare and unintentionally become wealthy was suggested by executive producer David Zuckerman, who suggested the idea in order to add a larger amount of plot to the episode. Several sequences and gags were integrated into the episode from creator MacFarlane's 1995 thesis film The Life of Larry, including the sequence where the Griffin family sees Philadelphia, and a brief cutaway where Peter farts for the first time at the age of 30. MacFarlane was cast as four of the show's main characters: Peter Griffin, Brian Griffin, Stewie Griffin, and Glenn Quagmire. MacFarlane chose to voice these characters himself, believing it would be easier to portray the voices he already envisioned than for someone else to attempt it. MacFarlane drew inspiration for the voice of Peter from a security guard he overheard talking while attending the Rhode Island School of Design. Stewie's voice was based on the voice of English actor Rex Harrison, especially his performance in the 1964 musical My Fair Lady. MacFarlane uses his regular speaking voice when playing Brian. The voice of Quagmire was inspired by fast-speaking radio advertising spokesmen from the 1950s. MacFarlane also provides voices for various other recurring and one- time characters, including news anchor Tom Tucker and Lois' father Carter Pewterschmidt. Alex Borstein was cast as Lois Griffin, Tricia Takanawa, Loretta Brown, and Lois' mother Barbara Pewterschmidt. Borstein was asked to provide a voice for the original pilot while she was working on MADtv. She had not met MacFarlane or seen any of his artwork and said it was \\"really sight unseen\\". At the time, Borstein performed in a stage show in Los Angeles, in which she played a redheaded mother whose voice she had based on one of her cousins. The voice was originally slower, but when MacFarlane heard it, he replied \\"Make it a little less annoying...and speed it up, or every episode will last four hours\\". Seth Green was chosen to play Chris Griffin and Neil Goldman. Green stated that he did an impression of the \\"Buffalo Bill\\" character from the thriller film The Silence of the Lambs during his audition. His main inspiration for Chris' voice came from envisioning how \\"Buffalo Bill\\" would sound if he were speaking through a public address system at a McDonald's. Lacey Chabert was cast as Meg Griffin. Chabert voiced Meg Griffin for the first production season (15 episodes), but due to a contractual agreement was never credited. Chabert left the series because of time conflicts with schoolwork and her role on Party of Five, and was replaced by Mila Kunis. Cultural references In the final scenes of the episode, the Griffin family is seen watching a television program called TV's Bloopers, a reference to the 1984 ABC and NBC television series TV's Bloopers and Practical Jokes. Towards the end of the courtroom scene, the Kool-Aid Man is seen breaking through a wall, which later became a running gag in the series involving a certain character or breaking through a wall and Peter's job as a Mascot is a parody of the Cocoa Puffs commercial. During Peter's recount of his job search to Brian, the talent show flashback mirrors the setting from The Sound of Music and makes a reference to the characters of the film, the von Trapp family.  Reception  The episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. In a 2008 review, Ahsan Haque of IGN rated the episode an 8.9/10, praising the integration of humor into the episode's storyline. Haque noted that the episode was \\"a very strong start to this long running classic series, and revisiting it serves as a reminder that unlike many other television shows, there are very few awkward moments, and much of the show's brilliance is immediately apparent.\\" In 2009, the site singled out \\"Death Has a Shadow\\" as a \\"strong start [to Family Guy]\\". Robin Pierson of The TV Critic gave the episode a mixed review, rating the episode a 67/100, calling it one of the most densely packed pilots on television. He mentioned that it was entertaining but said that there were many jokes that followed the quality-does-not-win-out-over-quantity saying. He compared Peter to Homer Simpson and he compared the show to The Simpsons and King of the Hill. He criticized the amount of unfunny jokes while he praised the surreal moments. At the end of his review he stated that Family Guy was a different kind of animated comedy which set out to do jokes that other cartoons couldn't do, also mentioning that the show had promise to become really funny. A more negative review came from EW.com's Ken Tucker, who called the animation clunky, which he said made Hanna-Barbera's animation look like state-of-the- art. Tucker also said in his review that he hoped that smart people would use the Family Guy half-hour to turn off the television set and start a debate over the air strikes in Kosovo. He also called the show \\"The Simpsons as conceived by a singularly sophomoric mind that lacks any reference point beyond other TV shows\\". Even before it aired the pilot had received some criticism from the Parents Television Council, a watchdog; the creator of this website L. Brent Bozell III wrote that he initially speculated that Family Guy would be \\"pushing the envelope\\". The was watched by 22.01 million of people after the Super Bowl.

It is also a Nature Conservation Review site, Grade 1, and an area of is a National Nature Reverse The site contains a long barrow dating to the Neolithic period, which is a Scheduled Monument In past centuries the forest covered a much larger area, since cleared in favour of agriculture, villages and towns. However, the forest's area has fluctuated. Parts cleared for agriculture during Britain's centuries under Roman rule later reverted to forest. The existence of the ancient Wychwood is recognised by the authoritative Victoria County History, but the planned Volume XIX has yet to be completed. Etymology Wychwood is derived from an Old English name Huiccewudu meaning 'wood of a tribe called the Hwicce. The Hwicce were the Anglo-Saxon people living in the area from some time in the 6th century until the assimilation of the Old English peoples into the wider Middle English society. Toponymy Three villages take part of their name from Wychwood Forest: Milton-under-Wychwood, Shipton-under-Wychwood and Ascott-under-Wychwood. These villages, commonly referred to as The Wychwoods, used to be part of the Royal Forest of Wychwood. History * Long barrows and later Bronze age round barrows show the area was settled from at least 3000 BC. 500BC to 40AD - increase in social organisation and construction of earthworks such as Knollbury Camp and Grim's Ditch.http://www.wychwoodproject.org/cms/content/history-wychwood-forest * During Roman times, the region was within a road network with Akeman Street crossing it. Remains of Roman villas have been found at North Leigh and Stonesfield. * After the decline of Roman control much of the open land reverted to woodland. Later Saxon settlements were restricted to the woodland edge or large clearings. * In the reign of Ethelred II (978-1016) a royal hunting lodge was established at Woodstock. * Wychwood was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086. The king had hunting rights over the whole area designated as Royal Forest, even though much of the land was held by various lords. Only the woodland at Woodstock (later Blenheim), Cornbury and a large area near Kingstanding Farm belonged directly to the king. * By 1300 Wychwood was divided into 3 portions, centered on the parks of Woodstock, Cornbury and a part which included the Bishop of Winchester's Witney estate. * In 1704 Woodstock Park was given by the Crown to the Duke of Marlborough. By then Cornbury was in private hands. * In 1778 the navy procured 500 trees from Wychwood yet by 1792 a report by the Crown Commissioners found only 173 oaks of ship building quality, with fences down, coppices full of deer, cattle and swine, and the locals helping themselves to firewood. * In 1857 the 10 sq. miles of Wychwood remaining as Royal Forest was taken out of Forest Law by a Parliamentary Act of Disafforestation. Ancient forest rights, granted to commoners, were ended and the commoners compensated. Within 2 years 2000 acres of woodland was converted to farmland and housing and 10 miles of new roads were built. Seven new farmsteads were built, including King's Standing Farm. The parish of Leafield and its church dates from this time. The remaining woodland was enclosed in 1867 and still exists. Foresters of Wychwood Arms of de Langley: Gules, two bars or in chief two buck's heads cabossed of the second, hereditary Foresters of Wychwood until 1361 While Wychwood was a designated Royal Forest, royalty entrusted the management of the forest to loyal servants. The men in charge of the forest were called Foresters of Wychwood and, in later years, Keepers of Wychwood. Foresters were tasked with supplying the king with deer, wood, timber and charcoal. They were also charged with upholding the king's law by protecting the forest with the assistance of under-foresters, riding foresters and walking foresters. Foresters, together with verderers (judicial officers) could hold court and try offenders for both minor and major offences. The office of Forester of Wychwood was until 1361 held by the family of de Langley, seated at the manor of Langley in the parish of Shipton-under-Wychwood.Macnamara, Francis Nottidge (1895). Memorials of the Danvers Family. London: Hardy and Page. p. 198 They were followed by the Earls of Warwick until 1499. Management was then given by the kings as favors to courtiers for life, among them were Robert Dudley (Earl of Leicester), Sir John Fortescue (Chancellor), Lord Clarendon (Chancellor) and George Spencer, the 4th Duke of Marlborough.Discovering Wychwood - Management of the forest - pages 22-23 Modern Wychwood Some of the land that had been cleared for agricultural use was purchased by the Woodland Trust, and re-planted with native English deciduous trees creating Shillbrook Wood, a site near Bampton, and Eynsham Wood, a site near Eynsham. Since the late 1990s there has been a resurgence of interest in the history and identity of the Wychwood, exemplified by the founding of the Wychwood Project. Since 2000 'Forest Fairs' have been held at a variety of locations within the old Wychwood boundary. These are a better-behaved revival of traditional Fairs that were closed down in 1856 because of rowdy behaviour. The modern Fairs are centred on rural communities and crafts. They attract a large number of visitors even in bad weather. Crowds at a Wychwood Fair The Oxford University Historical Re-Enactment Society, also known as the Wychwood Warriors, is a reenactment group that recreates aspects of Saxon life in Wychwood during the Dark Ages. The Wychwood has also given its name to a set of three villages in Oxfordshire, Milton-under-Wychwood, Shipton-under-Wychwood and Ascott-under- Wychwood. The villages together are known by locals as \\"The Wychwoods\\". Fragments of the ancient forest survive, one on the Cornbury Estate near Charlbury retaining the name 'Wychwood'.

History After the Assassination of Olof Palme in 1986, two state commissions were appointed to assess Swedens counter-terrorism capabilities. As a result, the government ordered the Swedish National Police Board to organize the \\"Standby Force Against Terrorism\\" (Beredskapsstyrkan mot terrorism) within the Stockholm County Police Authority in 1990. The group was soon renamed Nationella insatsstyrkan and became also a resource for the whole of Sweden. The right to make decisions about when they were used was delegated by the government to the Swedish National Police Board. After a parliamentary decision in 2002, the NTF was transferred from the Stockholm County Police Authority to the National Criminal Police (Rikskriminalpolisen). In connection with the reorganization of the police in 2015, the NTF was placed under the National Operations Department.  Tasks and operations  The NTF is meant to handle extraordinarily difficult or life-threatening criminal situations, such as terrorism and hostage situations. The main tasks of the unit includes: * Counter terrorism *Hostage rescue * Special reconnaissance * High risk arrests * Maritime operations * Negotiation in crisis situations * Reinforced close protection * Securing evidence in complex or high risk situations The unit also conducts intervention tasks in cities too remote for the reinforced regional task forces of Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö to reach, and too complex for the regional task forces of the non-metropolitan regions to handle. The NTF has participated in international operations in an advisory role. They regularly accompany the personal protection details of the Swedish Security Service abroad, providing a CAT (counter assault team) capability. They were also deployed aboard the Swedish Coast Guard vessels participating in the EU-led border security operation Triton, acting as a boarding party. The difference in the day-to-day intervention tasks between the NTF and the reinforced regional task forces is small and often blurs.  Organization  The NTF has one head of the unit with a number of subordinated coordinators, and a staff of experienced police officers from the unit. Under this management group the force is divided into 8 groups: *Alpha *Bravo *Charlie *Delta *Echo *Fox (snipers) *Golf (snipers) *Hotel (divers) The NTF is part of the National Intervention Concept (NIK). Launched in 2015, this concept standardized and regulated the employment, structure and capabilities of the Swedish police's tactical units. The NIK divides the various tactical units into three levels of capabilities: National capability: Provided by the NTF Reinforced regional capability: Provided by the RRTF (Piketen) in regions Stockholm, West and South. General regional capability: Provided by regional tactical teams dispersed throughout their respective region. This capability exists in regions North, East, Mid and Bergslagen. National Task Force during the 267x267px  Selection  The unit recruits operators bi-annually. To be eligible for service with the NTF the applicant is required to have completed either: * Police training: Two and a half year in length (including probationary service period) * Minimum of 4 years of continuous service in either the military, coast guard or customs Applicants who meet the basic requirements are then tested on their physical and psychological stamina during two 2 day periods. If successful they're invited to attend a grueling 10 day selection course in the field, At the end of the recruitment process an average of 6-10% of the candidates remain and progress to the roughly 6 months long operator training course. Candidates not already serving as police officers undergo a shorter, compressed police training roughly 18 months in length (including a 6 month probationary period) prior to attending the operator training course.  Service  Members of the NTF work full-time in the force. At the units inception the operators used to work two weeks on the unit followed by two weeks of regular police work, but as the need for them increased they changed it to full-time to cope with the demand and the need for more training. Most members have prior military service and as of recently direct application from the military to the unit is possible. The NTF has a close and active cooperation with the military, they have aviation support via the Air Force's UH-60 Black Hawks and regularly train with their military counterpart, the Special Operations Task Group. The NTF also has an active cooperation with several equivalent units in Europe in place via the ATLAS counter terrorism network, especially with other Nordic units such as the Danish AKS and the Norwegian Delta. For maritime operations the NTF is supported by the Coast Guard whose National boarding group operate Rigid- hulled inflatable boats. 268x268px  Armament & equipment  The NTF are issued a wide variety of weapons, namely being the MP5 submachine gun, assault rifles such as the G36, which have since been replaced by the LWRC M6http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2017/04/21/lwrci-swedish- police/http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2017/04/12/lwrc-ic-a5s-now-use- swedish-le/ as well as shotguns. In addition, all operators are equipped with the SIG Sauer P226 pistol as a sidearm, which is the standard sidearm used by all Swedish police officers. Snipers are equipped with the L96A1 AW sniper rifle, HK417, and according to pictures taken during US President Barack Obama's visit to Stockholm in September 2013, the new Sako TRG M10 Sniper Weapon System in .338 Lapua Magnum. The special equipment of the NTF is significantly different from that of the ordinary police. Operators are equipped with different radios, as wells as vest and uniforms from American manufacturer Crye Precision, ballistic Ops Core helmets and AN/PVS-31 night vision goggles. They distinguish themselves from other Swedish police by the green uniforms worn while operating in uniform.

History  Birmingham Conservation Trust was founded in 1977 by Birmingham City Council as a vehicle to preserve and restore the city's built heritage. The Trust's first ever project was the Georgian Brewmaster's House which was completed in 1984. The Trust continued to be affiliated to Birmingham City Council until a \\"Transition Grant\\" from the Heritage Lottery Fund in 2014/2015 made it possible for the Trust to become independent of the council. However, the Trust retains a good relationship with the council and over the last few years has seen it working on the Prefabulous project which focused on the council owned grade II listed prefabs on the Wake Green Road in the city. In 2004 the Trust completed the conservation and restoration of the last surviving court of Back to Back houses on Hurst Street in the city. These are now run as a visitor attraction by the National Trust. Perrott's Folly The Trust moved on to a short term project managing the protection of Perrott's Folly – a tower in the city which has close associations with J. R. R. Tolkien. Structural work was undertaken to ensure the stability of the tower which is now owned and managed by the ReFuture Collective. The Trust has also been instrumental in the formation of other charitable trusts set up to oversee single projects within the city. These include Highbury Hall, which is now maintained by the Chamberlain Highbury Trust and the Moseley Road Baths which are now run by the Moseley Road Baths CIO. The Trust's flagship project is Newman Brothers' Coffin Works: a grade II* listed Victorian factory situated in the Jewellery Quarter. Now run as a museum, the factory and its contents tells the story of Newman Brothers, Birmingham's last coffin- furniture firm, who operated from their Fleet Street premises for over 100 years until 1998 when workers laid down their equipment, and walked out of the building for the very last time, leaving everything, including personal belongings behind. The firm made some of the world's finest coffin furniture, including the fittings for the funerals of Winston Churchill, Joseph Chamberlain, Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother and Diana, Princess of Wales. Sections of the factory now comprise workshops and commercial units which house local businesses as well as the heritage hub which sees the Trust sharing offices with the Heritage Trust Network and Civic Voice.  Aims  Birmingham Conservation Trust believes in working with local people to find imaginative and sustainable solutions that address local needs. By doing this the Trust aims to: * create better places in which to live, work and play * enhance local distinctiveness and create a new identity for the City that integrates the best of the old with the new * form partnerships with local communities, with business, industry and the voluntary sector * empower communities within the City to help improve their environment for the better * act as a catalyst for urban regeneration in run down areas of the City * contribute to the local economy by drawing funds into the City and encouraging tourism and leisure * combine the best of modern design with the use of traditional construction skills It also seeks to actively encourage access and promote enjoyment of the city's historic buildings by: * taking part in the Heritage Open Days in the City * giving talks and lectures to local groups * staging exhibitions and events linked to our projects.

Her ambition was to change society with her authorship and to portray the conditions of the working class, and also the personal development of women. Her works were about motherhood, love, poverty, politics, religion, urbanization and the hard living conditions of the working-class woman.  Early life  Martinson was born on 2November 1890 in Vårdnäs, Linköping Municipality. Her mother was Kristina Swartz (sometimes spelt Christina Schwartz) who served as a maid wherever jobs were available. There are no legal records stating who her father was, but according to researchers Annika Johansson and Bonnie Festin, he was probably Anders Teodor Andersson, a farmhand who served at the Kärr farm in Motala at the same time as Swartz. Since she carried, what in those days was referred to as an illegitimate child, she had to go to her parents home for the birth. Swartz' father, Nils Peter Swartz, was a poor soldier who lived with his wife, Carin Olofsdotter, in a derelict croft in Vårdnäs. On 17February 1891, Swartz sued Andersson for child support at the Motala district court, where two witnesses testified that they had seen her and Andersson in the same bed around the time the child would have been conceived. Andersson failed to appear in court in February as well as on the two following hearings. Swartz finally said that he had gone to America and the proceedings were stayed. One of the textile mills in Norrköping, Förenade Yllefabrikerna, 1953 The identity of her father was unknown to Martinson her entire life, but her speculations about who it could be were an inspiration for her work. In her book Pigmamma (\\"Maid Mother\\") she portrays her mother's situation as pregnant with a married man's child. At one point she thought that her father was a married man, whom her mother had worked for. Her romantic view of her mysterious father decreased as time went by. In her book Mor gifter sig (My Mother Gets Married), written twelve years later, it became clear how much Martinson despised her absent father. In Fjäderbrevet (The Feather Letter), written another six years later, there is no mention of him at all. During the first years of her life, Martinson lived with her paternal grandparents and their youngest daughter Hulda while Swartz worked as a maid or in the textile mills in Norrköping. There are several discrepancies in the timeline of Martinson's early years between official records and her books. These are most likely due to that her stories built on the oral traditions of the family. In 1892, her grandfather became ill and died and her grandmother could no longer take care of Martinson so she went to live with her mother. There is no record of where they lived until 1894, when they moved to Norrköping. Swartz earned very little money. In 1894–1896, she worked at Norrköping's wool weaving mills, where working conditions were extremely bad and wages low. During her early school years, Martinson had a stepfather, Alfred Karlsson, who she described as an alcoholic. He was a sometime statare who worked odd jobs in the countryside outside Norrköping. He married Swartz on 11March 1896, and they had three more daughters, but they all died within days of being born. After the years at the textile mill, the family moved several times to different locations in Östergötland, settling down for a time wherever work was available. This affected Martinson's schooling since they only stayed in one place for a couple of months. Despite this, she left school with high marks after six years in 1903. She was confirmed in 1905 in Risinge Church, Finspång Municipality, after which she got her first job at a farm in Vikbolandet. In Martinson's book Kvinnor och äppleträd (Women and Apple Trees), which is set in Norrköping, she described the hard and ruthless situation that she and her mother was in during the 1890s. Because of the book, Martinson was accused for denigration by right- wing critics, but Martinson said that what she did was the opposite. The different run-down lodgings the family moved in and out of are described in the books Kyrkbröllop (Church wedding) and (My Mother Gets Married) as well as in a couple of the short stories in Jag möter en diktare (I meet a poet). = Kitchen maid and pantry chef = Moa Martinsson's Stairs in Sylten, Norrköping At the age of fifteen, she trained to become a pantry chef; at the time, she was the youngest in that profession in Sweden. During the summer of 1906, she worked as a kitchen maid in the main restaurant at the Norrköping Exhibition of Art and Industry. Situated at the top of Syltberget (\\"Sylt Hill\\"), the restaurant was accessed by an 80-steps stairway. In Kungens rosor (The King's Roses), Martinsson recounts her work in the restaurant and mentions the stairs. The novel got its name from a conversation that she had at the exhibition with King Oscar II of Sweden on 3July 1906. The conversation revolved around flowers, which the King said that he felt had souls. , the stairs remain and have been named \\"Moa Martinson's Stairs\\". In 1906, Martinson moved to Stockholm in the hope of getting a job, but this turned out to be harder than she expected. During the financial depression of 1907–1909, she had to move back to Norrköping. At this time, she followed events related to concerns about the labour market. This period of Martinson's life had a significant impact on her political engagement. She also wrote poems and sent a collection to a notary interested in literature, but her work was rejected. She later described the poems as \\"lofty\\", since that was how she thought such texts should be written.  First marriage  In 1908–1909, Martinson worked as a pantry chef at restaurants and hotels in Sweden. In the winter of 1909, she met Karl Johansson in Ösmo. He was nine years older than her, and was a stone worker who lived with his brother Valfrid and their father Johan Petter in a torp called Johannesdal, in the woods between Ösmo and Sorunda. She became pregnant in March 1909 and Johansson proposed, but Martinson was doubtful about marrying him. Despite this, she and Karl moved to Johannesdal and in her book Den osynlige älskaren (\\"The Invisible Lover\\") she wrote about her first year as mother and wife, the hard life in Johannesdal and how she desperately wanted to get away. In 1910, her first son Olof was born, and in 1922 she and Johansson were married. The reason she hesitated for such a long time to marry him, was partly due to Johansson's drinking and partly because she did not want to live in the dark forest. After the birth of Olof, the family soon expanded. In 1911, their second son Tore was born, followed by three more sons: Erik in 1913, Manfred in 1914 and Knut in 1916. The birth of Knut was especially hard, since she had to deliver him all alone on the kitchen floor in the torp. Martinson recounted the birth in Kvinnor och äppelträd, which has been called \\"one of Swedish literature's most powerful depictions of a childbirth\\". Life on Johannesdal was poor and hard but the upbringing of her sons was important to Martinson. She was opposed to spanking children and disliked the militant nationalistic romanticism taught in schools at the time.  Political involvement  Statue of Moa Martinsson in Norrköping, by Peter Linde Martinson's political interest started to develop in 1921, when unemployment in Sweden was higher than ever before, and in 1922 she and Johansson joined the Central Organisation of the Workers of Sweden where Martinson became very active. To further educate herself, she read the works of authors like Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Émile Zola, Maxim Gorky and Martin Andersen Nexø. Because of her political interest in better pay and conditions for workers and her ability to speak in any context, she was elected to the municipal council in Sorunda where she represented the labour party. She resigned from office in 1926. In November 1922, Martinsson wrote her first article for the syndicalist paper Arbetaren's (\\"The Worker's\\") page for women. She continued writing for the paper and in 1923 she had articles published weekly in Arbetaren. In her articles she wrote about how men and women should work together for a better world. She frequently engaged in debates, especially those involving women's issues. With her work for Arbetaren she developed her writing skills, but even though she often pushed the boundaries in her articles, she went too far in 1924, when she wrote that women and men should receive equal pay for equal work. Quarrels started at the magazine, resulting in Martinson resigning from the paper, but due to her contributions in Arbetaren she was now known to the public although mostly in syndicalistic circles. One author who had significant impact on Martinson was Martin Andersen Näxö. It was the first time she recognized her own experiences in a literary work. She wrote a letter to him, telling him about her own life and also sent an article she had written for Arbetaren. Näxö responded positively, telling her she should write a book about her life. Shortly afterwards Martinson started writing the book Pigmamman (\\"The Maid Mother\\"). In 1925, she worked for a new magazine called Vi kvinnor (\\"We women\\"), where she contributed with articles, novels and causeries.  Magazine articles  In April 1925, Martinson's two youngest sons, Manfred and Knut, went through the ice and drowned in the lake Styran by the torp and she was devastated. She worked incessantly to keep her grief at bay. In September 1925, Vi Kvinnor was discontinued and soon after Martinson started working for Arbetaren again. She also worked for the paper Brand in April 1925, and became part of the political circles in Stockholm. She wrote her first story Pigmamma (\\"Maid Mother\\") in 1924–25, and it was published as a serial in Brand in 1927. In June 1926, her first article for Arbetarekuriren was published and in 1927 her work was published in Templar-kuriren (\\"The Templars Courier\\"), Arbetaren and Nynäshamns-posten (\\"The Nynäshamn Post\\"). In October that year, she was also writing for Tidevarvet (The Epoch) which was a politically radical magazine for women published by the Fogelstad Citizen School for Women with Elin Wägner as editor. Her first contribution was an article about unemployed men's women. She wrote it under a new signature, Moa, because she did not want the syndicalistic circles she moved in to see that she worked for a liberal magazine. However, her work for Tidevarvet was mostly novels and stories and her political articles were still published in the syndicalistic press. She had found the name \\"Moa\\" in the novel Jökeln (Bræen) by Danish author Johannes V. Jensen, where the character \\"Moa\\" was described as the first mother of humanity. In November 1927, Martinson traveled to Gothenburg at the request of chief editor Welinder at the Arbetare-kuriren. She was hoping to be offered a job at the paper, but instead Welinder wanted her to work as a housemaid for him and do some writing for the magazine in exchange for food and shelter in his house. Martinson turned down the offer. While she was at the editorial office, she met Harry Martinson for the first time. He was a former sailor, now hobo writer who had been published in Brand and Arbetare-kuriren so she had heard of him and read some of his works.  Johansson's death  Shortly after Martinson's return to Johannesdal, her husband was afflicted by a nervous disorder. He started hallucinating and could not eat or sleep. She tried to get him to a doctor but he refused. On 14January 1928, Johansson committed suicide by putting a stick of dynamite in his mouth and lighting the fuse. By then, Martinson had considered divorcing him for a long time since theirs had not been an easy marriage. After Johansson's death her economic situation was difficult. Martinson's friends in Stockholm started a fund- raising and manage to collect SEK 3,300 to ease her financial situation. Having lost two sons and one husband, she became very depressed. In March 1928, she took a typing course at the Fogelstad Citizen School for Women and when she left the school it was as \\"Moa\\". During her stay at Fogelstad, she received a letter from Harry Martinson, who asked if he could come and stay for a while at the torp in Johannesdal so he could work. He arrived in the summer of 1928.  Second marriage  During the summer of 1928, Martinson and Harry fell in love. However, in 1928–1929 she became more depressed and in March 1929, she was hospitalized at Södertälje hospital. During Martinson's stay in the hospital, Harry lived at Johannesdal and they communicated through letters. On 3October 1929, they got married. Shortly thereafter, in May 1930, Harry was diagnosed with tuberculosis leaving Martinson devastated. Harry Martinson in 1943 The couple had very little money so in 1932, Martinson sent a draft called En man byggde (\\"A man built\\") to publisher Tor Bonnier. She continued to develop the draft during the following year and when it was finalized into a book, the title was changed to Kvinnor och Äppleträd. It was published in 1933, and the author was named as \\"Moa Martinson\\". Because of the timing and the theme, the book was categorized as \\"modernist literature\\". This became Martinson's literary debut and it gained a lot of attention. Simultaneously, Harry was diagnosed with neurosis and Martinson was deeply concerned for him. He was fourteen years younger than she, and their marriage had not been easy. As writers, they also had very different styles. While Martinson was characterized as an unpolished realist, Harry was a refined modernist. During the winter of 1933, their financial situation improved and they rented an apartment in Saltsjöbaden in the hope of solving their marriage problems. At the beginning of 1934 Harry suffered from depression. Up until then, he had never stayed in one place for such a long time as he had done with Martinson at Johannesdal. He started to leave the apartment now and then without any explanation of why or where he was going, and would be gone for days. Harry's friends blamed Martinson for his disappearance, and there were even those who believed that she was to blame for both his physical and mental pain. Not knowing where her husband was, Martinson soon became desperate with despair and jealousy. She even hired a private detective, but when this yielded nothing, she soon gave up. Unknown to Martinson, Harry had started to see a new woman during his time away from home. According to Engman, the name of the woman was Karin L., and another source, Söderberg, speaks of a love affair with poet Karin Boye and several other women. In the summer of 1934, Harry confessed that he had been seeing another woman but said that he had ended the affair. Martinson became furious, but she forgave him. However, Harry's affair with Karin was not over and the same summer they traveled to Tällberg in Dalarna. Harry told Martinson that he needed to be alone and that it would be good for them to be apart for a while. After a couple of weeks, Harry grew tired of Karin and returned to Johannesdal. During the last years of their marriage, he continued to wander off now and then from Martinson and Johannesdal. = Decline and divorce = On 6June 1934, Harry abruptly left Martinson and the house in Johannesdal and took to the road again, leaving behind the manuscript for Flowering Nettle (Nässlorna blomma). When he had been gone ten days, Martinson posted a personal telegram on the Swedish radio urging him to come home. With the announcement, Harry's flight became public and the story circulated in the newspapers. The couple kept in contact indirectly through their publishers and friends. On 2August, Martinsson wrote to Harry that she was going to commit suicide and that the manuscript was going to follow her to the grave. She had buried the manuscript in the woods. The letter reached Harry while he worked his passage aboard a ship to Rottedam. A week later, he was back home in Johannesdal and he, Martinson and one of their sons dug up the manuscript. In August 1934, the couple were invited to the first All Union Congress of Soviet Writers in Moscow as part of the Swedish delegation. Gorky became the first chairman of the congress during which the new doctrine of Socialist realism was formed. Martinson became fascinated by the communist society, while Harry was appalled by Stalin's cult of personality. In the autumn of 1935, the tension between Martinson and Harry seemed to have disappeared. She was working on Mor gifter sig. In 1937, she decided to leave the Bonnier publishing company. Instead she joined the Tidens publisher which was owned by the Swedish social democratic party. Martinson decided to leave because she had been having disagreements with Tor Bonnier since 1934. He was one of the Bonnier-founder's two grandsons who jointly ran the company at the time. Her choice of Tidens was also partly due to political reasons. Starting with a collection of poems called Motsols (\\"Counterclockwise\\"), Martinson's works were now published by Tidens. She had been working on Motsols for ten years. It consisted of poems about politics, love and nature. During the 1930s, Martinson experienced severe stomach pains. Despite several diagnoses made by different doctors, no remedy could be found and the pain continued. In June 1937, she was hospitalized at the Södertälje hospital where it was discovered that buckshots had accumulated in her appendix. She had an operation on 16June and during her stay at the hospital, she and Harry kept in contact through letters. Harry's were love letters, while Martinson still found it difficult to trust him after his extramarital affairs. Her letters were not as affectionate as his and their relationship was crumbling. On 8February 1939, Harry experienced pain in one of his knees and was hospitalized. He stayed in the hospital during spring and was discharged on 13June, after which he went to Stockholm and stayed with friends. He broke contact with Martinson and after Midsummer 1939, he filed for divorce and never returned to her or Johannesdal. They were granted legal separation on 4March 1940, and divorced in 1941. By then Harry was already engaged to his second wife Ingrid Lagercrantz. They were married until Harry committed suicide on 11February 1978 at the Karolinska University Hospital in Stockholm by cutting his stomach open with a pair of scissors in what has been described as a \\"hara-kiri-like manner\\", due to a depression following a controversy regarding the Nobel Prize in Literature he received in 1974. The marriage between Martinson and Harry is recounted in the memoirs Tröskeln (\\"The Threshold\\") (1982) by their friend Swedish writer Ivar Lo-Johansson. She also relied on Lo-Johansson to deliver messages to Harry when he was out on his wanderings and his whereabouts were unknown to her.  Later life and death  Moa Martinson in 1956 Over six years Martinson had published eight books and had gained most critics' respect. In September 1939, World War II broke out, which she saw as the biggest threat to the working class. In her opinion, the non-socialist ruling countries were sending out workers to fight for values they did not share. When it came to Soviet participation in the war, Martinson had a different opinion and believed that Russian workers were defending their revolution. In order to make more money and avoid loneliness Martinson entered a new area, the film industry. She had help from her friend, actress Naima Wifstrand. Martinson wrote a lengthy screenplay that she sent to director Per Lindberg, who became interested. She proposed that they would contact AB Svensk Filmindustri (SF). However, Martinson's ambitions were too big and when she demanded an advance and an answer straight away, SF showed no interest. In the autumn of 1942, she met Karl Gunnarsson, whom she had first encountered in 1910 when she worked as a pantry chef at the Elfkarleö Hotel, south of Gävle. Gunnarsson was a writer too and the meeting with him reminded Martinson of her youth during the 1910s and the move to Johannesdal. Her memories were given shape in a love novel called Den osynlige älskaren (\\"The Invisible Lover\\"). During the 1940s, Martinson became known in Sweden as \\"the Mother of the People\\". Her books were reaching a wide audience and she now had readers who could identify with the environment she was portraying, instead of people being shocked by her naturalistic scenes. She wrote diligently and had causerie and debate articles published in several daily and weekly papers. She was also frequently hired to give lectures and traveled the country on different tours. In 1944, she made her radio debut. Because of her strong personality, what she said and did caused attention, and she became a role model for many women in Sweden and most of all for women in the working class. In November 1954, Martinson's mother Kristina Swartz died at the age of 83. Their relationship had been very strong, and Martinson's mother had been a big influence and inspiration for her work. In My Mother Gets Married, she characterized Swartz as her best and most trusted friend. At that time, Martinson's literary reputation was low as it had decreased throughout the years. When her health became worse in the 60s, she stopped writing. However, despite her low reputation as a writer, Martinson still meant a lot to working class women. Even though her health was deteriorating, she still enjoyed debating and never stopped expressing her feelings. On 5August 1964, Martinson died at 73 years of age in Sorunda, Strängnäs. She is buried at Sorunda Church.  Legacy  During the 1970s, Martinson became a role model for female writers during the feminist movement in the Nordic countries. Earlier, during the 1960s, she had been labeled \\"the cheerful chronicler of misery\\" by Swedish author Erik Hjalmar Linder. In 1989, a literary award named after Martinson was instituted by the Workers' Educational Association (Arbetarnas bildningsförbund, ABF) and the Moa Martinson Society. The Moa Award (Moa- priset) is an annual prize awarded to a person who writes in the spirit of Martinson.

The breed is renowned for its hardiness and adaptability to extremes of climate. Its wool consists of a protective topcoat and soft undercoat. Some rams have four fully developed horns, a trait shared with few other breeds in the world. The Navajo-Churro has also gained popularity for its low-maintenance reputation, resistance to disease, and lean meat. Some say they are very personable. Ewes often birth twins. This breed is raised primarily for wool. History The Churra (renamed Churro by American frontiersmen) was first imported to North America in the 16th century and used to feed Spanish armies and settlers. By the 17th century Churros were popular with the Spanish settlers in the upper Rio Grande Valley. Flocks of Churros were also acquired by the Navajo through trading. The Churro soon became an important part of the Navajo economy and culture. A series of United States government-sponsored flock reductions and cross-breedings decimated the Navajo flocks until the Churro sheep nearly disappeared. Restoration of the breed began in the 1970s when breeders began acquiring Churro phenotypes with the purpose of preserving the breed and revitalizing Navajo and Hispanic flocks. Sacred Sheep Revive Navajo Tradition, For Now, Weekend Edition Saturday, National Public Radio, 2010-06-13, accessed 2010-06-13. While the Navajo- Churro breed is no longer in danger of extinction, it is still considered a rare breed. Horns The Navajo-Churro breed rams can have two, four, six, or more horns. This is because they possess the polycerate gene, which is also found in old heritage breeds like the Jacob Sheep. They also have the ability to have fused horns. Ewes also can have horns, or nubs called scurs. The color can be black, white, or striped. The growth of rams’ horns is slow. A full rack takes at least four to five years to grow out. A ewe's horns can also grow large, but not to the extent of the rams. The horns often curl around to the front, and should be away, and not close to the face. The horn quality is essential to getting good genetics in a flock; bad horns in the sire will continue down through his offspring. Horns can break, and as they are living at the base, they will bleed. Color This small flock of Navajo-Churros shows a common variety of colors. Churros come in a variety of colors, including reds, browns, black, white, and mixes, and color may change with age. The color is separated into fleece color, and the points color (legs and head). The sheep may also have different color patterns, such as eye patches and hip spots. Fleece The Navajo-Churros possess a dual coat, which has an inner and an outer layer. The fleece is composed of an inner coat (80% of fleece), and outer coat that is hair fibers (10-20% of fleece) and kemp (a coarse, opaque fiber, less than 5% of fleece). The fleece color is separated from the points color. The fleece can often change from lamb to adulthood. Blacks, for instance, often white out with age. The Navajo people have used Churro fleece in rugs and other weavings for some time. The wide range of natural colors makes it easy to have a variety of colors without the need for dyeing, although natural vegetable dyes are sometimes used to produce deeper colors and wider selection. A contemporary use for Navajo-Churro fleece has been disclosed by papermaking researcher Donald Farnsworth, whose quest to replicate paper identical to what was manufactured during the Renaissance era required woolen felts made from fleece with archaic characteristics.https://static1.squarespace.com/static/591cdecfa5790af910c1b4b9/t/599613e76b8f5b215eb545b2/1503007726996/QuestForTheGoldenFleece.pdf Listings Navajo-Churros are listed by The Livestock Conservancy as threatened and are part of the Slow Food Ark of heritage foods.

It is specified by MIL-DTL-83133 and British Defence Standard 91-87, and similar to commercial aviation's Jet A-1, but with the addition of corrosion inhibitor and anti-icing additives. A kerosene-based fuel, JP-8 is projected to remain in use at least until 2025. It was first introduced at NATO bases in 1978. Its NATO code is F-34. Usage It was specified in 1990 by the U.S. government as a replacement for government diesel fueled vehicles. The U.S. Air Force replaced JP-4 with JP-8 completely by the end of 1995, to use a less flammable, less hazardous fuel for better safety and combat survivability. The U.S. Navy uses a similar formula, JP-5. JP-5 has an even higher flash point of > 140 °F (60 °C), but also a higher cost, though the U.S. Navy Seabees still use JP-8 in their construction and tactical equipment. In addition to its use for powering aircraft, JP-8 is used as a fuel for heaters, stoves,Modern Burner Units , JP-8 is used by Army Food Service Specialists (cooks) to fuel MBUs, in accordance with U.S. Army Field Feeding Manual FM 10-23Babington Airtronic Burner burns JP-8 and other distillate fuels, and is the current common heat source for Marine Corps food service equipment. tanks,the M1 Abrams series of battle tanks uses JP fuel in its gas turbine engine by the U.S. military and its NATO allies as a replacement for diesel fuel in the engines of nearly all tactical ground vehicles and electrical generators, and as a coolant in engines and some other aircraft components. The use of a single fuel greatly simplifies logistics. JP-8 is formulated with an icing inhibitor, corrosion inhibitors, lubricants, and antistatic agents, and less benzene (a carcinogen) and less n-hexane (a neurotoxin) than JP-4. However, it also smells stronger than JP-4. JP-8 has an oily feel to the touch, while JP-4 feels more like a solvent. Problems and health concerns When used in highly supercharged diesel engines with the corresponding low compression ratio of about only 14:1 or below, JP-8 causes troubles during cold start and idling due to low compression temperatures and subsequent ignition delay because the cetane index is not specified in MIL- DTL-83133G to 40 or higher. Because lubricity to the BOCLE method is not specified in MIL-DTL-83133G, modern common-rail diesel engines can experience wear problems in high-pressure fuel pumps and injectors. Another problem in diesel engines can be increased wear to exhaust valve seats in the cylinder heads, because a minimum content of sulfur is not specified in MIL-DTL-83133G. Sulfur in fuel normally contributes to a build-up of soot layers on these valve seats. According to the notes in this standard, it is intended to include a cetane index value in one of the next releases. Workers have complained of smelling and tasting JP-8 for hours after exposure. As JP-8 is less volatile than standard diesel fuel, it remains on the contaminated surfaces for longer time, increasing the risk of exposure. JP-8 exposure has also been linked to hearing problems, but rather than being unable to hear sounds, the brain has a hard time deciphering the message. Dr. O'neil Guthrie, a research scientist and clinical audiologist with the United States Department of Veterans Affairs Loma Linda Healthcare System in California, has compared the central auditory processing disorder to dyslexia for the ears.https://www.research.va.gov/currents/spring2014/spring2014-11.cfm Variants JP-8+100 (F-37) is a version of JP-8 with an additive that increases its thermal stability by 100 °F (a difference of 56 °C). The additive is a combination of a surfactant, metal deactivator, and an antioxidant, and was introduced in 1994 to reduce choking and fouling in engine fuel systems. The additive is known as 8Q462, or Aeroshell Performance Additive 101, is manufactured by BetzDearborn (Now GE Betz), and used at the ratio of 256 ppm, at cost of about $1 per 1000 gallons of fuel. Commercially, this additive is used in police helicopters in Tampa, Florida. JP-8+100 is also used for Canadian Forces CP-140 Aurora, CC-130 Hercules and the CC-115 Buffalo. JP-8+100LT is a variant of JP-8+100, with additives to facilitate low-temperature performance. It is considered as a logistically friendly low- cost replacement of the JPTS fuel for the Lockheed U-2 airplane.

Its NATO code is F-40. It is also known as avtag. Usage JP-4 was a 50-50 kerosene-gasoline blend. It had a lower flash point than JP-1, but was preferred because of its greater availability. It was the primary U.S. Air Force jet fuel between 1951 and 1995. MC-77 is the Swedish military equivalent of JP-4. Mixture JP-4 was a mixture of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons. It was a flammable transparent liquid with clear or straw color, and a kerosene-like smell. It evaporated easily and floated on water. Although it had a low flash point (), a lit match dropped into JP-4 would not ignite the mixture. JP-4 froze at , and its maximum burning temperature was . JP-4 was a non-conductive liquid, prone to build up static electricity when being moved through pipes and tanks. As it is volatile and has a low flash point, the static discharge could cause a fire. Beginning in the mid-1980s an antistatic agent was added to the fuel to lower the charge buildup and decrease the corresponding risk of fires. Flow rates must be controlled, and all the equipment used must be electrically interconnected and well grounded. Commercial aviation uses a similar mixture under the name Jet-B, though without the additional corrosion inhibitors and icing inhibitors included in JP-4. Phase-out The desire for a less flammable, less hazardous fuel led the U.S. Air Force to phase out JP-4 in favor of JP-8; the transition for USAF operations in Great Britain was made in 1979, and the change was completed throughout the USAF by the end of 1995.

Two of his four sons Gordon Wenham and David Wenham are also noted theologians. Career Wenham was born in Sanderstead, Surrey and was educated at Uppingham School, Pembroke College, Cambridge, and Ridley Hall. After his ordination in 1938, he was curate at St Paul's Church, Hadley Wood and taught at St John's College, Highbury. He served as a Royal Air Force chaplain during World War II, followed by vicar of St Nicholas' Church, Durham between 1948–1953, and seventeen years as vice-principal of Tyndale Hall, Bristol. Theological views Wenham had the distinction of being a conservative theologian, a defender of biblical inerrancy, and one who held to the position of \\"conditional immortality\\" – or the belief that the human soul is not by default eternal in nature; this belief goes hand in hand with the notion that sinners, once cast into hell, are at some point burned up and essentially no longer exist. (This doctrine is also frequently referred to as annihilationism.) In his book Facing Hell, An Autobiography 1913–1996, Wenham writes, \\"I believe that endless torment is a hideous and unscriptural doctrine which has been a terrible burden on the mind of the church for many centuries and a terrible blot on her presentation of the Gospel. I should indeed be happy, if before I die, I could help in sweeping it away.\\" Facing Hell was published shortly after his death and is largely autobiographical, though also containing a paper Wenham published in regard to the doctrines of conditional immortality and the limited temporal nature of hell. Academic work Among New Testament Greek scholars, Wenham's work The Elements of New Testament Greek is well regarded, and was the successor to Nunn's introductory Koine Greek textbook. In 1992 John Wenham published Redating Matthew, Mark and Luke which discusses the dating of these gospels and the relationship of the gospels to one another (prior to Wenham's work, John A.T. Robinson, a liberal theologian, had written a widely known book titled Redating the New Testament which advocated an early date of the gospels). Wenham accepted the church father evidence of authorship, and inferred a very early date for each of the synoptic gospels. Wenham's work is well regarded by those who supported the Augustinian hypothesis which is the traditional view of gospel authorship. Scholars consider the two strongest defenders of the Augustinian Hypothesis in the twentieth century to be John Wenham and B.C. Butler. Wenham's work which gained him recognition among Bible scholars and lay persons was his work Easter Enigma which offered Bible exegesis that argued for the harmony of the gospel accounts. As a result of these two works Wenham is frequently cited in regard to these issues in the discipline of Christian apologetics. In his work Redating Matthew, Mark and Luke Wenham wrote regarding the book of Matthew the following: \\"The [Church] fathers are almost unanimous in asserting that Matthew the tax-collector was the author, writing first, for Hebrews in the Hebrew language: Papias (c. 60–130), Irenaeus (c. 130–200), Pantaenus (died c. 190), Origen (c. 185–254), Eusebius (c. 260–340), Epiphanius of Salamis (c. 315–403), Cyril of Jerusalem (c. 315-86) and others write in this vein. The Medieval Hebrew gospel of Matthew in Even Bohan could be a corrupted version of the original. Though unrivaled, the tradition has been discounted on various grounds, particularly on the alleged unreliability of Papias, from whom some would derive the whole tradition.\\" (John Wenham, Redating Matthew, Mark & Luke (1991), p. 116). Wenham also argued for the Gospel of Mark being the second gospel written which he claims is consistent both with internal evidence and with the testimony of the church fathers.Biblical Horizons Publications Rev. John Wenham's works include: *The Elements of New Testament Greek (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1965). *Christ & the Bible (London: The Tyndale Press, 1972). *The Goodness of God (London: Inter- Varsity Press, 1974) *Easter Enigma, originally, Easter Enigma: Are the Resurrection Accounts in Conflict?

At a height of 1.85 m (6'1\\") tall,Derrick Sharp 6-1 (185cm). he played at the point guard and shooting guard positions. He played with the Maccabi Tel Aviv basketball club for 15 years, spending part of the time as the team's captain, and also later served as the team's assistant coach under David Blatt. With Maccabi, he won a record 29 club titles. In July 2011, Sharp retired from playing professional basketball. After he retired from playing, he remained with Maccabi Tel Aviv, working as an assistant coach with the club, until August 2013. High school Sharp, who was born in Orlando, Florida, attended Evans High School, in Orlando. At Evans High, he played high school basketball. College career After high school, Sharp played college basketball at Brevard Community College, from 1989 to 1991. He then played college basketball at the University of South Florida, where he played with the South Florida Bulls, from 1991 to 1993. Professional playing career Sharp joined Maccabi Hadera, which was playing in the Israeli 2nd Division at the time, for the 1993–94 season. From 1994 to 1996, he played with Hapoel Migdal-HaEmek, which competed in the Israeli 2nd Division in the 1994–95 season, and in the Israeli 3rd Division, in the 1995–96 season. Sharp then made the big jump in his career, when he moved to the most well-known team in Israel – Maccabi Tel Aviv. With Maccabi Tel Aviv, Sharp won 13 Israeli national league championships, 11 Israeli State Cups, 2 Israeli League Cups, and 3 European- wide titles (the 2001 FIBA SuproLeague, the 2004 EuroLeague, and the 2005 EuroLeague). As a member of Maccabi Tel Aviv, Sharp quickly became a crowd favorite, due to his tough defense, three-point shooting, and clutch plays. The most memorable example of the latter came on April 8, 2004, in a EuroLeague game against the Lithuanian club Zalgiris Kaunas. With 2 seconds remaining in the game, and Maccabi Tel Aviv trailing by 3 points and facing elimination from the EuroLeague Top 16 phase, Sharp caught a long pass from Gur Shelef, turned to the basket, and fired up a game-tying three-pointer, forcing overtime. Maccabi Tel Aviv won that game, and advanced to the EuroLeague Final Four, which was held in Tel Aviv that year. The team eventually became the EuroLeague champions. In July 2011, Sharp retired from playing professional basketball, at the age of 39. In total, Sharp played professional basketball in Israel for 18 years, spending 15 of them with Maccabi Tel Aviv. He finished his career ranked seventh all-time on the Maccabi Tel Aviv's career scoring list in European-wide games, with 1,749 points scored, and seventh in the EuroLeague in career free throw accuracy, at 88.9%. National team playing career Sharp became a naturalized Israeli citizen. He then played with the senior Israeli national team, from 2000 to 2003. With Israel, he played at the 2001 EuroBasket and at the 2003 EuroBasket. Coaching career After he retired from playing professional basketball, Sharp continued to work with Maccabi Tel Aviv as an assistant coach, after he had taken a coaching course at Wingate Institute, in 2010. On August 2, 2013, Sharp resigned from his role as an assistant coach of Maccabi Tel-Aviv. Personal life In the mid-1990s, Sharp married an Israeli woman, and thus received Israeli citizenship, by virtue of that marriage. The couple have one son, who also played basketball in Israel. In 1999, he divorced his first wife, and married Canadian basketball player Justine Ellison. They have four children together, three sons and a daughter. Sharp lived with his family in Herzliya, Israel, until August 2013, when they moved to Orlando, Florida. His son from his first marriage later returned to Israel to pursue a basketball playing career.http://www.one.co.il/Article/17-18/2,620,1347,0/298368.html?ref=rss Sharp later moved to Tampa, Florida, where he formally worked as the head coach of the Blake High School boys' basketball team. Sharp is currently the Varsity Boys' Head Basketball Coach at Bishop McLaughlin Catholic High School in Pasco County, Florida.

It originally aired on Fox in the United States on April 11, 1999, stating in a promo that it is the official series premiere of the show. The episode follows Peter Griffin as he teaches his daughter Meg how to drive. Due to his horrible advice they crash into a satellite dish, knocking out the city's cable. Peter begins to suffer from television withdrawal but finds new life in outdoor activities, driving his family to exhaustion. Meanwhile, Stewie plots to destroy the world's supply of broccoli with a weather control device so Lois cannot force him to eat the vegetable. \\"I Never Met the Dead Man\\" was written by Chris Sheridan and directed by Michael Dante DiMartino, both firsts in the Family Guy series. Much of the episode's humor, in standard Family Guy fashion, is structured around cutaway sequences that parody popular culture, including those centered on Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner, Star Trek, Wizard of Oz, ALF, Gilligan's Island, Bewitched, and Beverly Hills, 90210. The title \\"I Never Met the Dead Man\\" was derived from 1930s and 1940s radio programs, particularly the radio thriller anthology Suspense, which featured several elements pertaining to death and murder. The episode featured guest performances by Erik Estrada, Butch Hartman, Aaron Lustig and Joey Slotnick, along with several recurring voice actors for the series. Critical responses to the episode were favorable; several television critics singled it out as among the \\"most memorable\\" episodes in the series. Plot Before the intro starts, Stewie plays with the Sesame Street telephone. As the telephone says to count to three, Stewie uses his laser gun to destroy the telephone three times. Annoyed that Peter spends more time watching television than with his own family, Lois suggests he teach Meg how to drive. Peter reluctantly agrees, and unwittingly gives Meg a series of bad driving tips, including instructing her to \\"rev\\" her engine twice at stop lights and challenge other drivers to a race, which causes her to ultimately fail her driving test. As Peter drives them home from the DMV he notices that a show he wanted to watch is on television in a nearby house. Distracted by the show, he crashes the car into the main cable television transmitter, knocking out reception for the whole entire town of Quahog. As Peter and Meg realize this angry citizens of Quahog approach. Panicking, Peter makes a promise to Meg so that if she takes the blame for knocking down the cable transmitter, she would get a new convertible when she finally gets her licence. Once they arrive home with the transmitter still attached to the car, Lois becomes furious with Peter for placing the blame on his own daughter. Meg, of course, is blamed, and is about to admit the truth, but then decides to keep quiet, reflecting with an inner voice, a reference to The Wonder Years, at school. This shows an incredible lack of good judgment and morals by Peter. Meanwhile, Stewie, (seeing the opportunity of the dish attached to the car), steals the satellite dish in a plan to create a weather control device capable of destroying the world's supply of broccoli, since Lois had forced him to eat the vegetable earlier that day. Suffering withdrawal syndrome from the lack of cable, Peter straps a television-sized cardboard cutout to himself, making it appear as though his whole world is actually a television program. When Meg can no longer deal with the public scorn, she reveals that her father is really responsible for Quahog's loss of television, causing the town to turn against him. In an attempt to save Peter from further scorn and verbal attacks, Lois gives a heartfelt speech to the community about how television has kept them all from enjoying one another. Inspired by the speech, Peter drags the family to one outdoor activity after another, which quickly exhausts them. Once the family can no longer keep up with him, Peter decides to go off with William Shatner, who has appeared on the Griffin family doorstep after experiencing a flat tire, to a nearby festival. Meanwhile, Stewie's weather machine creates a huge rainstorm. The storm's lightning strike destroys Stewie's weather machine and blows Stewie off the roof and on the ground. While Meg is practicing driving with Lois, the storm causes her to accidentally hit Shatner and Peter, killing Shatner and hospitalizing Peter. As her father recovers, in a full-body cast, he is forced to watch television, causing him to become addicted once again, much to his family's relief. During the credits, Stewie tries (and fails) to make believe he is eating his broccoli by pouring it onto Brian's plate. Production Michael Dante DiMartino directed the episode \\"I Never Met the Dead Man\\" was the first episode of Family Guy for both writer Chris Sheridan and director Michael Dante DiMartino. For the first months of production, the writers shared one office lent to them by the King of the Hill production crew. As with the remaining first four episodes of the season, the title of the episode was derived from 1930s and 1940s radio programs, particularly the radio thriller anthology \\"Suspense\\", which featured several elements pertaining to death and murder. This convention was later dropped following the fourth episode of the season. In addition to the regular cast, actor Erik Estrada, writer and animator Butch Hartman, actor Aaron Lustig, actor Joey Slotnick and voice actor Frank Welker guest starred in the episode. Recurring guest voice actress Lori Alan also made minor appearances. The episode originally aired on April 11, 1999, nearly three months after the series premiere. Cultural references An animated likeness of actor William Shatner was featured in the episode. When Meg asks her mother to help teach her how to drive, Lois suggests Peter take her driving instead. With Peter refusing in order to continue watching an episode of Star Trek, actor William Shatner, as portrayed by series creator Seth MacFarlane, then appears on the screen. Going on to suggest her father is not the best driver, Brian recalls a previous driving incident Peter had with Wile E. Coyote, in which he accidentally ran over the Road Runner in the middle of the desert. When Peter is concerned about the \\"Ostrich\\" he just hit Wiley tells him to keep going. In school, when Meg is about to confess that her dad was actually the one who crashed the car, she reflects with an inner voice, a reference to the 1990s hit TV show The Wonder Years. Continuing to suffer a withdrawal from not being able to watch television, Peter has a Wizard of Oz-inspired nightmare featuring Alf from the 1986 NBC sitcom ALF, Gilligan from the 1964 CBS series Gilligan's Island, The Robot from \\"Lost in Space\\", and Jeannie from \\"I Dream of Jeannie,\\" who promptly transforms into Samantha from the 1964 ABC series Bewitched. After creating a cardboard cutout in the shape of a television, Peter walks around town with the contraption strapped to his waist, perceiving the actions around him as television. Two women talking over lunch suggests that he is watching the television station Lifetime, two elderly people out walking reminds him of CBS, a group of African Americans playing basketball suggests UPN, and James Woods High School reminds him of Beverly Hills, 90210. After TV service is restored and most of the Griffin family is watching Star Trek, James T. Kirk tells his crew that there is a dangerous mission in that someone will surely be killed. He says the landing party will consist of himself, Mr. Spock, Dr. McCoy, and Ensign Ricky (a redshirt), who, upon being called, cynically says \\"Oh crap!\\", due to the television trope of oft-related instances of redshirt ensigns being killed on the show. At the end of the episode, after Meg accidentally hits and kills Shatner with the Griffin family car, the group of people looking over includes the actor who played Ensign Ricky stating \\"Wow, I did not see that one coming.\\" Reception Reviews for the episode were generally favorable. A 2008 review of the episode by Ahsan Haque of IGN was positive, calling the storyline involving Stewie \\"elaborate creative.\\" He gave the episode a perfect score of ten, calling it one of the most \\"memorable\\" episodes in the entire series. Haque went on to note that \\"the tightly woven and hilarious storyline, combined with a constant barrage of cleverly inserted random jokes, and some truly unique imagery help make this episode one of the finest in the series. This is Family Guy at its best, and definitely sets a very high bar for animated comedy.\\" Robin Pierson of The TV Critic rated the episode a 70 out of 100, making it the highest-rated episode of Family Guy on the site. Pierson described the episode as \\"A really fun twenty two minutes of television. There are so many jokes to enjoy and they are more focussed than the pilot,\\" in particular praising the Fast Animals, Slow Children sequence. In 2008, Haque later listed Stewie's plan to freeze broccoli crops as number one on his list of \\"Stewie's Top 10 Most Diabolical Evil Plans\\" and placed Peter's idea to pretend the world is a television program by attaching a cardboard cutout of a television set around his waist in sixth place on his list of \\"Peter Griffin's Top 10 Craziest Ideas\\".

It was to be the follow-up and companion work to his earlier and highly successful Infanterie greift an, which was published in 1937. Manuscript Panzer greift an exists only in the form of scattered manuscripts and notes, but due to the fame of its author, it has achieved legendary status as a work of military literature. It is believed Rommel started writing the text while commandant of the War Academy at Wiener Neustadt (Theresian Military Academy) in 1938, though he may have started earlier during his time as an instructor at the Potsdam War Academy (1935–37). His career as a military theorist and instructor, however, was preempted by his duties as a commander and soldier during World War II. Following the end of the North African Campaign in 1943, he again started work on it, drawing upon his, by then, extensive experience and notes. But once more the war, along with ill health, interfered as he was put in charge of the entire Atlantic wall in 1944. After his staff car was strafed by an RCAF Spitfire fighter on July 17 of that year, he again started on the work while recuperating from his injuries. However, he soon became implicated in the July 20 Plot against Adolf Hitler and was compelled to commit suicide on October 14, 1944. Fearful of the loss of Rommel's personal papers, then mostly stored in Wiener Neustadt, his wife and son collected and hid them from both the SS and advancing allied troops. According to Manfred Rommel, \\"My father's death made my mother all the more anxious to save his papers, not only for personal reasons but so that, when history came to be written, the truth might be told.\\"The Rommel Papers Retrieved 2017-08-22 In the chaos at the end of the war, some papers were lost or went missing, but most of them eventually ended up in the hands of the US Army. Publication Most of what was to be in the book can now be found in the 1953 book The Rommel Papers, which was developed from notes and diary entries by Rommel during the North African Campaign. The book was edited by the British journalist and historian B. H. Liddell Hart, with assistance of a former Wehrmacht general Fritz Bayerlein, who served on Rommel's staff in North Africa, and Rommel's widow and son. The volume contained an introduction and commentary by Liddell Hart. Popular culture In the film Patton, a book with this title is on the nightstand when he is awakened by his aides who inform him that Rommel is about to attack his army. When the tank battle is over, Patton exclaims \\"Rommel, you magnificent bastard, I read your book!\\" This, of course, never could have occurred, as Rommel never completed his tank book; although Patton may very well have read Rommel's earlier book on infantry.

He was the last duke from the House of Eppenstein. He was the son of Count Markwart of Eppenstein (d. 1076) and his wife Liutbirg of Plain, the younger brother of Liutold of Eppenstein, who was enfeoffed with the Carinthian duchy after the deposition of the Zähringen duke Berthold by King Henry IV of Germany in 1077. Both brothers had been loyal allies of the king during the fierce Investiture Controversy and the Walk to Canossa. When the princes elected Rudolf of Rheinfelden anti-king, the Eppensteins ensured King Henry's safe passage back to Germany. In or shortly after 1077, Henry IV granted the marches of Carniola and Istria to Henry of Eppenstein. When Duke Liutold died childless in 1090, Henry IV vested him with Carinthia and the Veronese march, but transferred Carniola to the Patriarchate of Aquileia and Istria to Poppo of Weimar- Orlamümde. Duke Henry served as Vogt (bailiff) of the patriarchate under his brother Patriarch Ulrich I. With Ulrich he backed King Henry V of Germany when he enforced the abdication of his father Emperor Henry IV in 1105. In the course of the ongoing Investiture Controversy he entered into an armed conflict with Prince-Archbishop Conrad I of Salzburg in 1121. With Henry's death in 1122, the Eppenstein line became extinct. The Carinthian duchy was taken over by his godson Henry from the rising House of Sponheim. References *Florin Curta.

Life and career Harry Greenbank was born Henry Harveston Greenbank in London, England and had an extraordinarily productive, but short, life. Greenbank first placed one of his works, Captain Billy, at the Savoy Theatre, set to music by the company's musical director François Cellier. The piece was staged as a curtain-raiser to The Nautch Girl beginning in 1891. He continued to write such small-scale pieces over the following couple of years, both for the Savoy (Mr. Jericho in 1893 and Old Sarah in 1897) and for the Lyric Theatre, where Horace Sedger asked him to supply the English lyrics to F. C. Burnand's adaptation of the French operetta Le coeur et la main (Incognita).Cover of the Vocal Score After that, George Edwardes put Greenbank together as lyricist with music director Sidney Jones and dramatist Owen Hall to create the hit musical comedy A Gaiety Girl in 1893. After the worldwide success of that piece, the three stayed together and subsequently formed the backbone of the team which produced the famous series of very successful series of Daly's Theatre musicals, including An Artist's Model (1895), The Geisha (1896), A Greek Slave (1898), and San Toy (1899). At the same time, Greenbank also provided lyrics for two of the most successful of the lighter shows produced by Edwardes at the Gaiety Theatre The Circus Girl (1896) and A Runaway Girl (1898). He also ventured twice as librettist-lyricist, once with an original musical, Monte Carlo, and once with an adaptation of Lecocq's La Petite Mademoiselle as The Scarlet Feather. He also contributed additional lyrics for The Bric à Brac Will (1895) and, posthumously, a song for the London production of A Chinese Honeymoon (1901), \\"Roses Red and White\\". Greenbank was often in ill health, and during the production of A Greek Slave, he moved with his wife and son to England's southern coast in an attempt to regain some strength. He died there while writing lyrics for San Toy, and the piece was completed by Adrian Ross, who, with Greenbank, was largely responsible for establishing the post of lyricist (as opposed to librettist, or co-writer) in the modern musical theatre. He died in Boscombe, Bournemouth, Hampshire at the age of 33.

It is named after the German surgeon Friedrich Trendelenburg. The Trendelenburg sign is said to be positive if, when standing on one leg (the 'stance leg'), the pelvis drops on the side opposite to the stance leg. The muscle weakness is present on the side of the stance leg. If the patient compensates for this weakness (by tilting their trunk/thorax to the affected side), then the pelvis will be raised, rather than dropped, on the side opposite to the stance leg. Ergo, in the same situation, the patient's hip may be dropped or raised, dependent upon whether the patient is actively compensating, as above, or not. Compensation shifts the centre of gravity to the affected side, and also decreases the angle between the hip adductor muscles and femur, both of which decrease the forces needing to be applied by the hip adductor muscles to maintain relevant posture. The gluteus medius is very important during the stance phase of the gait cycle to maintain both hips at the same level. Moreover, one leg stance accounts for about 60% of the gait cycle. Furthermore, during the stance phase of the gait cycle, there is approximately three times the body weight transmitted to the hip joint. The hip abductors' action accounts for two thirds of that body weight. A Trendelenburg sign can occur when there is presence of a muscular dysfunction (weakness of the gluteus medius or minimus) or when someone is experiencing pain.

These markets became a key phenomenon in the history of slavery, particularly in the Arab slave trade and the interregional slave trade of the United States. Slave markets in the Arab slave trade The Slave Market, by Jean-Léon Gérôme, 1866. This was a popular subject in 19th-century Orientalist painting, normally with a sexual element. Slave merchant in art In the Ottoman Empire during the mid-14th century, slaves were traded in special marketplaces called \\"Esir\\" or \\"Yesir\\" that were located in most towns and cities. It is said that Sultan Mehmed II \\"the Conqueror\\" established the first Ottoman slave market in Constantinople in the 1460s, probably where the former Byzantine slave market had stood. According to Nicolas de Nicolay, there were slaves of all ages and both sexes, they were displayed naked to be thoroughly checked by possible buyers. In Somalia, the inhabiting Bantus are descended from Bantu groups that had settled in Southeast Africa after the initial expansion from Nigeria/Cameroon, and whose members were later captured and sold into the Arab slave trade. Zanzibar slave market in 1860, by Edwin Stocqueler From 1800 to 1890, between 25,000–50,000 Bantu slaves are thought to have been sold from the slave market of Zanzibar to the Somali coast. Most of the slaves were from the Majindo, Makua, Nyasa, Yao, Zalama, Zaramo and Zigua ethnic groups of Tanzania, Mozambique and Malawi. Collectively, these Bantu groups are known as Mushunguli, which is a term taken from Mzigula, the Zigua tribe's word for \\"people\\" (the word holds multiple implied meanings including \\"worker\\", \\"foreigner\\", and \\"slave\\").Refugee Reports, November 2002, Volume 23, Number 8Gwyn Campbell, The Structure of Slavery in Indian Ocean Africa and Asia, 1 edition, (Routledge: 2003), p.ix Bantu adult and children slaves (referred to collectively as jareer by their Somali mastersCatherine Lowe Besteman, Unraveling Somalia: Race, Class, and the Legacy of Slavery, (University of Pennsylvania Press: 1999), pp. 83-84) were purchased in the slave market exclusively to do undesirable work on plantation grounds.Catherine Lowe Besteman, Unraveling Somalia: Race, Class, and the Legacy of Slavery, (University of Pennsylvania Press: 1999), pp. unknown. Enslaved Africans were sold in the towns of the Arab World. In 1416, al-Maqrizi told how pilgrims coming from Takrur (near the Senegal River) had brought 1,700 slaves with them to Mecca. In North Africa, the main slave markets were in Morocco, Algiers, Tripoli and Cairo. Sales were held in public places or in souks. Potential buyers made a careful examination of the \\"merchandise\\": they checked the state of health of a person who was often standing naked with wrists bound together. In Cairo, transactions involving eunuchs and concubines happened in private houses. Prices varied according to the slave's quality. Thomas Smee, the commander of the British research ship Ternate, visited such a market in Zanzibar in 1811 and gave a detailed description: Slave markets in Europe Among many other European slave markets, Genoa, and Venice were some well- known markets, their importance and demand growing after the great plague of the 14th century which decimated much of the European work force.Bales, Kevin. Understanding Global Slavery: A Reader The maritime town of Lagos, Portugal, was the first slave market created in Portugal for the sale of imported African slaves, the Mercado de Escravos, which opened in 1444.Goodman, Joan E.

Columbia University Press, , pp. 158–60, 362–70. In 1441, the first slaves were brought to Portugal from northern Mauritania. Prince Henry the Navigator, major sponsor of the Portuguese African expeditions, as of any other merchandise, taxed one fifth of the selling price of the slaves imported to Portugal. By the year 1552 African slaves made up 10 percent of the population of Lisbon.Thomas Foster Earle, K. J. P. Lowe \\"Black Africans in Renaissance Europe\\" p. 157 GoogleDavid Northrup, \\"Africa's Discovery of Europe\\" p. 8 (Google) In the second half of the 16th century, the Crown gave up the monopoly on slave trade and the focus of European trade in African slaves shifted from import to Europe to slave transports directly to tropical colonies in the Americas—in the case of Portugal, especially Brazil. In the 15th century, one third of the slaves were resold to the African market in exchange of gold.Klein, Herbert. The Atlantic Slave Trade (1970). In the early 18th century, the Crimean Khanate maintained a massive slave trade with the Ottoman Empire and the Middle East, exporting about 2 million slaves from Russia and Poland-Lithuania over the period 1500–1700.Darjusz Kołodziejczyk, as reported by Caffa (modern Feodosia) became one of the best-known and significant trading ports and slave markets. Slave markets in Africa Ancient Egyptian slave market, with Nubian slaves waiting to be sold The slave trade had existed in North Africa since antiquity, with a supply of African slaves arriving through trans-Saharan trade routes. The towns on the North African coast were recorded in Roman times for their slave markets, and this trend continued into the medieval age. The Barbary slave trade on the Barbary Coast increased in influence in the 15th century, when the Ottoman Empire took over as rulers of the area. Coupled with this was an influx of Sephardi Jews and Moorish refugees, newly expelled from Spain after the Reconquista. The Barbary slave trade encompassed both African slavery and White slavery. The Velekete Slave Market established in 1502 in Badagry, Lagos State, was significant during the Trans-Atlantic Slave trade in Badagry as it served as a business point where African middlemen sold slaves to European slave merchants thus making it one of the most populous slave markets in West Africa. Another historic slave market was Bono Manso Slave market around 16th century, which was centered at a giant Baobab tree to the west of the town played a major role in the Trans-Atlantic Slave trade. This was one of the oldest slave transitions points in the Gold Coast. Slave markets in North America The inspection and sale of a slave. White men pose, 104 Locust Street, St. Louis, Missouri in 1852 at Lynch's Slave Market In the United States, the domestic slave trade had become a major economic activity by 1815, and lasted until the 1860s.Marcyliena H. Morgan (2002). Language, Discourse and Power in African American Culture, p. 20. Cambridge University Press, 2002. Between 1830 and 1840 nearly 250,000 slaves were taken across state lines. In the 1850s more than 193,000 were transported, and historians estimate nearly one million in total took part in the forced migration of this new Middle Passage. By 1860 the slave population in the United States had reached 4 million. Old Slave Market, St. Augustine, Florida in 1886 In the 1840s, almost 300,000 slaves were transported, with Alabama and Mississippi receiving 100,000 each. During each decade between 1810 and 1860, at least 100,000 slaves were moved from their state of origin. In the final decade before the Civil War, 250,000 were moved. Historian Ira Berlin wrote: > The internal slave trade became the largest enterprise in the South outside > the plantation itself, and probably the most advanced in its employment of > modern transportation, finance, and publicity. The slave trade industry > developed its own unique language, with terms such as \\"prime hands, bucks, > breeding wenches, and \\"fancy girls\\" coming into common use.Berlin, > Generations of Captivity, pp. 166–69. The expansion of the interstate slave trade contributed to the \\"economic revival of once depressed seaboard states\\" as demand accelerated the value of slaves who were subject to sale.Kolchin, p. 98. United States Colored Troop, enlisted African-American soldier reading at 8 Whitehall Street, Slave trader's business in Atlanta, Georgia, Fall 1864. Some traders moved their \\"chattels\\" by sea, with Norfolk to New Orleans being the most common route, but most slaves were forced to walk overland. Others were shipped downriver from such markets as Louisville on the Ohio River, and Natchez on the Mississippi. Traders created regular migration routes served by a network of slave pens, yards, and warehouses needed as temporary housing for the slaves. In addition, other vendors provided clothes, food, and supplies for slaves. As the trek advanced, some slaves were sold and new ones purchased. Berlin concluded, \\"In all, the slave trade, with its hubs and regional centers, its spurs and circuits, reached into every cranny of southern society. Few southerners, black or white, were untouched\\".Berlin, Generations of Captivity, pp. 168–71. New Orleans, where French colonists had established sugar cane plantations and exported sugar as the chief commodity crop, became nationally important as a slave market and port, as slaves were shipped from there upriver by steamboat to plantations on the Mississippi River; it also sold slaves who had been shipped downriver from markets such as Louisville. By 1840, it had the largest slave market in North America. It became the wealthiest and the fourth-largest city in the nation, based chiefly on the slave trade and associated businesses.Walter Johnson, Soul by Soul: Life Inside the Antebellum Slave Market, Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1999. The trading season was from September to May, after the harvest.Johnson (1999), Soul by Soul, p. 2. One of the most famous remaining slave market buildings in the United States is the Old Slave Mart in Charleston, South Carolina. Throughout the first half of the 19th century, slaves brought into Charleston were sold at public auctions held on the north side of the Exchange and Provost building.National Conference of State Historic Preservation Officers, Old Slave Mart. Retrieved: 27 May 2010. After the city prohibited public slave auctions in 1856, enclosed slave markets sprang up along Chalmers, State, and Queen streets. One such market was Ryan's Mart, established by City Councilman and broker, Thomas Ryan and his business partner, James Marsh. Ryan's Mart originally consisted of a closed lot with three structures-- a four-story barracoon or slave jail, a kitchen, and a morgue or \\"dead house.\\"Nenie Dixon and Elias Bull, National Register of Historic Places Nomination Form for Old Slave Mart, 12 February 1975. Retrieved: 27 May 2010. In 1859, an auction master named Z. B. Oakes purchased Ryan's Mart, and built what is now the Old Slave Mart building for use as an auction gallery. The building's auction table was high and long and stood just inside the arched doorway. In addition to slaves, the market sold real estate and stock. Slave auctions at Ryan's Mart were advertised in broadsheets throughout the 1850s, some appearing as far away as Galveston, Texas.

The result was the hit of the West End theatre season, A Gaiety Girl (1893), with music by Sidney Jones and lyrics by Harry Greenbank. Hall's satirical book included lines that jabbed in the style of an upmarket gossip columnist.\\"Owen Hall\\". British Musical Theatre, accessed 26 July 2011His sister Eliza was engaged for part of her career as such a columnist. See Lowndes, Mrs. Belloc. The Merry Wives of Westminster, Macmillan (1946), p. 56 The smart society back-chat was very popular with audiences, and A Gaiety Girl has a claim to being the first true musical comedy. Hall's next libretto was for An Artist's Model (1895), another success for the same writing team. He repeated the snappy dialogue style of the previous work, but joined it with a romantic plot, which Hall added at the last minute after Edwardes hired the star Marie Tempest, for whom Hall quickly wrote a new role. The result established the formula for two further extraordinary successes by Hall and his collaborators at Daly's Theatre. The first of these was The Geisha (1896), which became the biggest international hit in musical theatre history, playing for 760 performances in its original London run and enjoying numerous international productions.Histories of Tourism: Representation, Identity and Conflict (ed. John K. Walton; 2005), p. 105, Multilingual Matters Limited. The next collaboration for Hall, Jones and Greenbank was another popular work for Daly's, A Greek Slave (1898). {align=right width=250px  Music from Leslie Stuart and Owen Hall's Florodora (1899) } Hall declared bankruptcy first at the age of 29, during his early career as a solicitor, having run up debts of more than £27,000. He was back in bankruptcy court six years later, in 1888. Even after his theatrical success and high salary from Edwardes, he was bankrupt again in 1898. His constant financial trouble stemmed from his gambling and extravagant entertaining of his friends. The pseudonym \\"Owen Hall\\" was an ironic nod (\\"owin' all\\") towards his extensive debts, as was another of his pseudonyms, \\"Payne Nunn\\" (\\"payin' none\\"). His sister Eliza recalled: \\"As a lawyer he gave advice freely to his friends; as a racehorse owner he indulged his prodigal proclivities in the world of hangers-on; during his editorial and play-writing epochs he was lavish in his hospitality ... and he voiced his belief that he 'had enjoyed every experience except death and solvency'.\\"Aria, pp. 19–20 She wrote that, during his bankruptcy proceedings, Hall quipped irreverently: \\"Now I know that my Receiver liveth\\".Aria, p. 20 His nephew Gilbert recalled that Hall said: \\"You can trust me with anything except a pretty girl or a sovereign.\\" =Florodora and later years= Hall wrote the musical Florodora (1899) for producer Tom Davis, which was set to music by Leslie Stuart, and the piece became another record-setting international hit, running for 455 performances in London, and then 552 performances in New York, followed by other international productions and revivals.Kenig, Marc. \\"Reviving a Legend of Musical Theatre\\", The Patter Post, Lyric Theatre, San Jose, California, May 2009, pp. 6–10 Hall wrote several more works in the new century, including two more musicals for Davis: The Silver Slipper (1901) with Stuart, and the unsuccessful The Medal and the Maid (1903) with Jones. For Edwardes, he wrote \\"perhaps the most delightful of all his libretti\\" and his last big success, The Girl from Kays (1902), and later The Little Cherub (1906). A 1904 piece was Sergeant Brue, written with Liza Lehmann. He died in Harrogate, one day short of his 54th birthday, and was buried in Highgate Cemetery, north London.\\"Funeral of Mr 'Owen Hall'\\", The Morning Post, 15 April 1907, p. 5, accessed 29 November 2017, via British Newspaper Archive NotesReferences  External links * *Kenrick, John.

He was the most important lyricist of the British stage during a career that spanned five decades. At a time when few shows had long runs, nineteen of his West End shows ran for over 400 performances. Starting out in the late 1880s, Ross wrote the lyrics for the earliest British musical theatre hits, including In Town (1892), The Shop Girl (1894) and The Circus Girl (1896). Ross next wrote the lyrics for a string of hit musicals, beginning with A Greek Slave (1898), San Toy (1899), The Messenger Boy (1900) and The Toreador (1901) and continuing without a break through World War I. He also wrote the English lyrics for a series of hit adaptations of European operettas beginning with The Merry Widow in 1907. During World War I, Ross was one of the founders of the Performing Rights Society. He continued writing until 1930, producing several more successes after the war. He also wrote the popular novel The Hole of the Pit and a number of short stories. Life and career Ross was born in Lewisham, London. He was the youngest son and fourth child of Ellen Harriet Ropes née Hall, of Scarborough, and William Hooper Ropes, a Russia merchant. Ross's parents lived in Normandy, France, but sent him to school in London at Priory House School in Clapton, Mill Hill School, and the City of London School. He later attended King's College, Cambridge, where, in 1881, he won the Chancellor's Medal for English verse for his poem \\"Temple Bar\\", and also won the Members' Prize for the English essay. In 1883 he graduated with a first- class degree, winning the Lightfoot scholarship for history and a Whewell scholarship for international law. He was elected a fellow of the College.Parker, J., rev. Katharine Chubbuck. \\"Ropes, Arthur Reed (1859–1933)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 14 October 2008 He was a Cambridge University graduate and don, teaching history and poetry from 1884 to 1890 and writing serious and comic verse of his own, the first volume of which was published in 1884. In 1889, he published \\"A Sketch of the History of Europe\\". He was also a translator of French and German literature under his own name. He created the fictitious name \\"Adrian Ross\\" due to a concern that writing musicals would compromise his academic career.Kenrick, John. \\"Who's Who in Musicals: Ross, Adrian\\", Musicals101.com: The Cyber Encyclopedia of Musical Theatre, TV and Film (2005) =Early career= A. C. Seymour and Letty Lind in Morocco Bound During a brief illness in 1883 after catching cold at the University Boat Race, Ross used the lonely time in bed to write the libretto of an entertainment entitled A Double Event. This was produced at St. George's Hall, London in 1884 with music by Arthur Law, and Ross used the name \\"Arthur Reed\\". His next work for the stage, also as Arthur Reed, was the book and lyrics for a musical burlesque, Faddimir (1889 at the Opera Comique), with music by fellow Cambridge graduate, F. Osmond Carr. The piece earned enough praise so that the impresario George Edwardes commissioned the two to write another burlesque, together with the comic actor John Lloyd Shine, called Joan of Arc. Songs from the piece included \\"I Went to Find Emin\\", \\"Round the Town\\", and \\"Jack the Dandy-O\\". Joan of Arc opened in 1891 at the Opera Comique starring Arthur Roberts and Marion Hood; he wrote under the pseudonym Adrian Ross, which he used for the rest of his career. The piece was a hit, lasting for almost eight hundred performances, and Ross resigned from Cambridge. To supplement his income from theatre writing, Ross became a contributor to such journals as Punch, Sketch, Sphere and The World, and he joined the staff of Ariel in 1891–1892. He wrote in The Tatler under the pseudonym Bran Pie and in 1893 published an edition of Lady Mary Wortley Montague's Letters. He also published numerous French texts for the Pitt Press series. Ross and Carr's next work, in collaboration with James T. Tanner, was In Town (1892), a smart, contemporary tale of backstage and society goings-on. This left behind the earlier Gaiety burlesques and helped set the new fashion for the series of modern-dress Gaiety Theatre shows that quickly spread to other theatres and dominated British musical theatre. For his next piece, Morocco Bound (1893, with the song \\"Marguerite from Monte Carlo\\"), Ross concentrated on writing lyrics, leaving the \\"book\\" mostly to Arthur Branscombe. This proved to be his most successful model through most of his career.\\"Adrian Ross\\" profile at the British Musical Theatre site of The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, 7 October 2004 The position of \\"lyricist\\" was relatively new, as previously the writers of libretti would invariably write the lyrics themselves. As the new Edwardes- produced \\"musical comedies\\" took the place of burlesque, comic opera and operetta on the stage, Ross and Harry Greenbank established the usefulness of a separate lyricist. Souvenir – 1st anniversary of the opening =Gaiety and Daly Theatre musicals= Ross contributed lyrics to almost all of the Gaiety Theatre's shows, beginning with The Shop Girl (1894, with his song \\"Brown of Colorado\\") and Go-Bang in 1895. He wrote over two thousand lyrics and produced lyrics for over sixty musicals thereafter, including most of the hit musicals through World War I. In 1896, he contributed to the Gaiety Theatre hit, The Circus Girl. He also wrote lyrics for the one-act comic opera, Weather or No (1896), which played as a companion piece to The Mikado at the Savoy Theatre, as well as several other Savoy operas, such as Mirette (1894), His Majesty, or The Court of Vignolia (1897), The Grand Duchess of Gerolstein (1897) and The Lucky Star (1899). Lily Elsie in The Dollar Princess Ross also wrote lyrics for the shows at Daly's Theatre. His lyrics to additional numbers for An Artist's Model (1895) and The Geisha (1896) were successful enough so that Edwardes asked him for major contributions to the rest, beginning with A Greek Slave (1898), especially after the death of the theatre's early chief lyricist, Harry Greenbank. These included a series of enormous successes, including San Toy (1899), The Messenger Boy (1900), Kitty Grey (1901), The Toreador (1901), A Country Girl (1902), The Girl from Kays (1903), The Orchid (1903), The Cingalee (1904), The Spring Chicken (1905) and The Girls of Gottenberg (1907). In 1901, Ross married Ethel Wood, an actress, and the couple produced a son and two daughters. The family resided in Church Street, Kensington. Also in 1901, he collaborated with his sister Mary Emily Ropes on the children's story, On Peter's Island. When Edwardes found success, beginning in 1907, in mounting English-language versions of the new generation of continental European operettas to the London stage, Ross wrote the English lyrics for the adaptations, often with libretti by Basil Hood. His words to the songs in The Merry Widow (1907) became the standard English version of that piece, performed throughout the world for many decades. Other Continental musicals that Ross anglicised included A Waltz Dream (1908), The Dollar Princess (1909), The Girl in the Train (1910), The Count of Luxembourg (1911), The Girl on the Film (1913) and The Marriage Market (1913), most of which had enduring success throughout the English-speaking world. Other successes from this period were the musicals King of Cadonia (1908), Havana (1908), Our Miss Gibbs (1909), The Quaker Girl (1911), and Betty in 1915. In addition, many of Ross's most successful pieces had additional successes on tour in Britain, in America and elsewhere. His biggest hits on Broadway included The Girl from Kays (1903), The Merry Widow (1907 and many revivals), Havana (1909), Madame Sherry (1911) and The Quaker Girl (1911). =Later career= Lilac Time In 1914, Ross was one of the founders of the Performing Rights Society. Ross continued, after Edwardes's death, to write lyrics for numerous shows at the Gaiety, Daly's, the Adelphi Theatre, and other London theatres. During World War I, he continued to produce hits, writing the lyrics for the musical adaptation of a French comedy, Theodore & Co (1916), the operetta Arlette (1917), the musical The Boy (1917), André Messager's adaptation of Booth Tarkington's Monsieur Beaucaire (1919, \\"Philomel\\") and contributed to A Southern Maid (1920). He also worked on the revues Three Cheers (1917) with Herman Darewski, Airs and Graces with Lionel Monckton, and, years later, Sky High for the Palladium Theatre, but these were only diversions from his chief focus of writing lyrics for musicals and operetta adaptations. In 1922, he wrote both the book and the lyrics for the popular English version of Das Dreimäderlhaus, the international hit based on Franz Schubert's music and life, produced in Britain as Lilac Time. In 1927, Ross and Dudley Glass, an Australian composer, collaborated on a musical based on The Beloved Vagabond by W. J. Locke. His last works were produced in 1930: the English adaptation of the operetta Friederike for the Palace Theatre,\\"Frederica\\", The Guide to Musical Theatre (NODA) and a musical based on The Toymaker of Nuremberg by Austin Strong, which was produced as a Kingsway Theatre Christmas entertainment. Ross collaborated extensively with the foremost British-based composers of musical theatre active during his productive period, including Carr, Ivan Caryll, Monckton, Leslie Stuart and Sidney Jones, and later Paul Rubens, Harold Fraser-Simson, Howard Talbot and Messager. Sixteen of his musicals ran for more than 400 performances. Ross tailored each song to fit the style required by the producer – songs for the Gaiety were different from those for Daly's. Many of his most popular shows, songs (both for the theatre and beyond it) and adaptations are still performed today. =Fiction and last years= Ross also wrote the popular horror novel The Hole of the Pit and a number of short stories. Set in 1645 during the English Civil War, the novel tells of a loathsome entity that inhabits a flooded pit amid the marshes surrounding a castle. The book is notable for its depth of characterisation – especially of the compassionate young narrator, a Puritan scholar who has refused to join Oliver Cromwell's army because of his objections to religious violence and who sees the good in everyone – and for its subtle depiction of the creature in the hole, which is never completely seen even as it overwhelms the castle. The novel was published in 1914 by Edward Arnold and never reprinted until Ramsey Campbell collected it in his 1992 anthology Uncanny Banquet. Brian Stableford called it \\"a minor classic of the genre\\".Stableford, Brian. \\"Ross, Adrian\\", in David Pringle (ed.), St. James Guide to Horror, Ghost & Gothic Writers. London: St. James Press, 1998, p. 486, Ross also wrote Short History of Europe, edited Lady Mary Wortley-Montagu's Letters (Selection and Life), and was a contributor to Punch magazine. Ross died of heart failure at his home in Kensington, London on 11 September 1933 at the age of 73. =List of stage works= Ross contributed lyrics to the following musicals and comic operas, often in collaboration with other lyricists: Ellaline Terriss in The Circus Girl *Faddimir, or The Triumph of Orthodoxy (1889) *Joan of Arc (1891) (400+ performances in total) *Don Juan (1892, starring Roberts) *The Young Recruit (1892) *In Town (1892) (292 performances) *Morocco Bound (1893) (295 performances) *Go-Bang (1894) (129 performances) *The Shop Girl (1894) (546 performances) *Mirette revised English version (1894) (total of 102 performances in both versions) *Bobbo (1895) *Biarritz (1896) (71 performances) *My Girl (1896) (183 performances) *Weather or No (1896) (209 performances) *The Circus Girl (1896) (497 performances) *His Majesty, or The Court of Vignolia (1897) (61 performances) *The Ballet Girl (1897) *The Grand Duchess (1897) (104 performances) Scene from The Orchid *The Transit of Venus (1898) *Billy (1898) *A Greek Slave (1898) (349 performances) *Milord Sir Smith (1898) (82 performances) *The Lucky Star (1899) (143 performances) *San Toy (1899) (768 performances) *The Messenger Boy (1900) (429 performances) *The Toreador (1901) (675 performances) *Kitty Grey (1901) (220 performances) *A Country Girl (1902) (729 performances) *The Girl from Kays (1903) (432 performances; 236 performances on Broadway) *The Orchid (1903) (559 performances) *The Cingalee (1904) (365 performances) *The Spring Chicken (1905) (401 performances) *The Little Cherub (1906) (114 performances) *Naughty Nero (1906) Millar and Evett in A Waltz Dream Cover of the Vocal Score The Count of Luxembourg Sheet music from A Southern Maid *The New Aladdin (1906) (203 performances) *See-See (1906) (152 performances).Dangerfield, Fred. \\"See-See\\" feature in The Play Pictorial, vol 8, pp. 85–88, Greening & Co., Ltd.

In addition, they are also involved in many biological processes in which large molecules bind specifically but transiently to one another (see the properties section of the DNA page). These interactions also heavily influence drug design, crystallinity and design of materials, particularly for self-assembly, and, in general, the synthesis of many organic molecules. Intermolecular forces are non-covalent interactions that occur between different molecules, rather than between different atoms of the same molecule.  Electrostatic interactions Ionic= Scheme 1. Process of NaF formation -- example of an electrostatic interaction Ionic interactions involve the attraction of ions or molecules with full permanent charges of opposite signs. For example, sodium fluoride involves the attraction of the positive charge on sodium (Na+) with the negative charge on fluoride (F−). However, this particular interaction is easily broken upon addition to water, or other highly polar solvents. In water ion pairing is mostly entropy driven; a single salt bridge usually amounts to an attraction value of about ΔG =5 kJ/mol at an intermediate ion strength I, at I close to zero the value increases to about 8 kJ/mol. The ΔG values are usually additive and largely independent of the nature of the participating ions, except for transition metal ions etc. These interactions can also be seen in molecules with a localized charge on a particular atom. For example, the full negative charge associated with ethoxide, the conjugate base of ethanol, is most commonly accompanied by the positive charge of an alkali metal salt such as the sodium cation (Na+). = Hydrogen bonding = 200px A hydrogen bond (H-bond), is a specific type of interaction that involves dipole–dipole attraction between a partially positive hydrogen atom and a highly electronegative, partially negative oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, or fluorine atom (not covalently bound to said hydrogen atom). It is not a covalent bond, but instead is classified as a strong non-covalent interaction. It is responsible for why water is a liquid at room temperature and not a gas (given water's low molecular weight). Most commonly, the strength of hydrogen bonds lies between 0–4 kcal/mol, but can sometimes be as strong as 40 kcal/mol In solvents such as chloroform or carbon tetrachloride one observes e.g. for the interaction between amides additive values of about 5 kJ/mol. According to Linus Pauling the strength of a hydrogen bond is essentially determined by the electrostatic charges. Measurements of thousands of complexes in chloroform or carbon tetrachloride have led to additive free energy increments for all kind of donor-acceptor combinations. = Halogen bonding = Figure 1. Anionic Lewis base forming a halogen bond with electron-withdrawn bromine (Lewis acid) Halogen bonding is a type of non-covalent interaction which does not involve the formation nor breaking of actual bonds, but rather is similar to the dipole–dipole interaction known as hydrogen bonding. In halogen bonding, a halogen atom acts as an electrophile, or electron-seeking species, and forms a weak electrostatic interaction with a nucleophile, or electron-rich species. The nucleophilic agent in these interactions tends to be highly electronegative (such as oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur), or may be anionic, bearing a negative formal charge. As compared to hydrogen bonding, the halogen atom takes the place of the partially positively charged hydrogen as the electrophile. Halogen bonding should not be confused with halogen–aromatic interactions, as the two are related but differ by definition. Halogen–aromatic interactions involve an electron-rich aromatic π-cloud as a nucleophile; halogen bonding is restricted to monatomic nucleophiles.  Van der Waals forces  Van der Waals forces are a subset of electrostatic interactions involving permanent or induced dipoles (or multipoles). These include the following: *permanent dipole–dipole interactions, alternatively called the Keesom force *dipole-induced dipole interactions, or the Debye force *induced dipole-induced dipole interactions, commonly referred to as London dispersion forces Hydrogen bonding and halogen bonding are typically not classified as Van der Waals forces. = Dipole–dipole = Figure 2. Dipole–dipole interactions between two acetone molecules, with the partially negative oxygen atom interacting with the partially positive carbon atom in the carbonyl. Dipole–dipole interactions are electrostatic interactions between permanent dipoles in molecules. These interactions tend to align the molecules to increase attraction (reducing potential energy). Normally, dipoles are associated with electronegative atoms, including oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and fluorine. For example, acetone, the active ingredient in some nail polish removers, has a net dipole associated with the carbonyl (see figure 2). Since oxygen is more electronegative than the carbon that is covalently bonded to it, the electrons associated with that bond will be closer to the oxygen than the carbon, creating a partial negative charge (δ−) on the oxygen, and a partial positive charge (δ+) on the carbon. They are not full charges because the electrons are still shared through a covalent bond between the oxygen and carbon. If the electrons were no longer being shared, then the oxygen-carbon bond would be an electrostatic interaction. : Often molecules contain dipolar groups, but have no overall dipole moment. This occurs if there is symmetry within the molecule that causes the dipoles to cancel each other out. This occurs in molecules such as tetrachloromethane. Note that the dipole-dipole interaction between two individual atoms is usually zero, since atoms rarely carry a permanent dipole. See atomic dipoles. = Dipole-induced dipole = A dipole-induced dipole interaction (Debye force) is due to the approach of a molecule with a permanent dipole to another non-polar molecule with no permanent dipole. This approach causes the electrons of the non-polar molecule to be polarized toward or away from the dipole (or \\"induce\\" a dipole) of the approaching molecule. Specifically, the dipole can cause electrostatic attraction or repulsion of the electrons from the non-polar molecule, depending on orientation of the incoming dipole. Atoms with larger atomic radii are considered more \\"polarizable\\" and therefore experience greater attractions as a result of the Debye force. = London dispersion forces= London dispersion forcesNon-covalent Interactions in Quantum Chemistry and Physics: Theory and Applications A.Otero de la Roza, G. A. DiLabio, (Eds), Elsevier; 2017, Non-covalent Interactions in the Synthesis and Design of New Compounds A M. Maharramov, K. T. Mahmudov, M. N. Kopylovich, A. J. L. Pombeiro Wiley; 2016, P. Hobza and K. Müller-Dethlefs Non-Covalent Interactions: Theory and Experiment (Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Series) Royal Society of Chemistry; 2009, are the weakest type of non-covalent interaction. In organic molecules, however, the multitude of contacts can lead to larger contributions, particularly in the presence of heteroatoms. They are also known as \\"induced dipole-induced dipole interactions\\" and present between all molecules, even those which inherently do not have permanent dipoles. Dispersive interactions increase with the polarizability of interacting groups, but are weakened by solvents of increased polarizability. They are caused by the temporary repulsion of electrons away from the electrons of a neighboring molecule, leading to a partially positive dipole on one molecule and a partially negative dipole on another molecule. Hexane is a good example of a molecule with no polarity or highly electronegative atoms, yet is a liquid at room temperature due mainly to London dispersion forces. In this example, when one hexane molecule approaches another, a temporary, weak partially negative dipole on the incoming hexane can polarize the electron cloud of another, causing a partially positive dipole on that hexane molecule.In absence of solvents hydrocarbons such as hexane form crystals due to dispersive forces ; the sublimation heat of crystals is a measure of the dispersive interaction.While these interactions are short-lived and very weak, they can be responsible for why certain non-polar molecules are liquids at room temperature.  π-effects π-effects can be broken down into numerous categories, including π-π interactions, cation-π & anion-π interactions, and polar-π interactions. In general, π-effects are associated with the interactions of molecules with the π-systems of conjugated molecules such as benzene. = π–π interaction = π–π interactions are associated with the interaction between the π-orbitals of a molecular system. The high polarizability of aromatic rings lead to dispersive interactions as major contribution to so-called stacking effects. These play a major role for interactions of nucleobases e.g. in DNA. For a simple example, a benzene ring, with its fully conjugated π cloud, will interact in two major ways (and one minor way) with a neighboring benzene ring through a π–π interaction (see figure 3). The two major ways that benzene stacks are edge-to-face, with an enthalpy of ~2 kcal/mol, and displaced (or slip stacked), with an enthalpy of ~2.3 kcal/mol. The sandwich configuration is not nearly as stable of an interaction as the previously two mentioned due to high electrostatic repulsion of the electrons in the π orbitals. Figure 3. Various ways that benzene can interact intermolecularly. Note, however, that the sandwich configuration is not a favorable interaction compared to displaced or edge-to- face = Cation–π and anion–π interaction = Figure 4 Cation–pi interactions involve the positive charge of a cation interacting with the electrons in a π-system of a molecule. This interaction is surprisingly strong (as strong or stronger than H-bonding in some contexts), and has many potential applications in chemical sensors. For example, the sodium ion can easily sit atop the π cloud of a benzene molecule, with C6 symmetry (See figure 4). Anion–π interactions are very similar to cation–π interactions, but reversed. In this case, an anion sits atop an electron-poor π-system, usually established by the placement of electron-withdrawing substituents on the conjugated molecule Figure 5. = Polar–π = Polar–π interactions involve molecules with permanent dipoles (such as water) interacting with the quadrupole moment of a π-system (such as that in benzene (see figure 5). While not as strong as a cation-π interaction, these interactions can be quite strong (~1-2 kcal/mol), and are commonly involved in protein folding and crystallinity of solids containing both hydrogen bonding and π-systems. In fact, any molecule with a hydrogen bond donor (hydrogen bound to a highly electronegative atom) will have favorable electrostatic interactions with the electron-rich π-system of a conjugated molecule. Hydrophobic effect The hydrophobic effect is the desire for non-polar molecules to aggregate in aqueous solutions in order to separate from water. This phenomenon leads to minimum exposed surface area of non-polar molecules to the polar water molecules (typically spherical droplets), and is commonly used in biochemistry to study protein folding and other various biological phenomenon. The effect is also commonly seen when mixing various oils (including cooking oil) and water. Over time, oil sitting on top of water will begin to aggregate into large flattened spheres from smaller droplets, eventually leading to a film of all oil sitting atop a pool of water. However the hydrophobic effect is not considered a non-covalent interaction as it is a function of entropy and not a specific interaction between two molecules, usually characterized by entropy.enthalpy compensation. An essentially enthalpic hydrophobic effect materializes if a limited number of water molecules are restricted within a cavity; displacement of such water molecules by a ligand frees the water molecules which then in the bulk water enjoy a maximum of hydrogen bonds close to four.  Examples  Drug design = Most pharmaceutical drugs are small molecules which elicit a physiological response by \\"binding\\" to enzymes or receptors, causing an increase or decrease in the enzyme's ability to function. The binding of a small molecule to a protein is governed by a combination of steric, or spatial considerations, in addition to various non-covalent interactions, although some drugs do covalently modify an active site (see irreversible inhibitors). Using the \\"lock and key model\\" of enzyme binding, a drug (key) must be of roughly the proper dimensions to fit the enzyme's binding site (lock). Using the appropriately sized molecular scaffold, drugs must also interact with the enzyme non-covalently in order to maximize binding affinity binding constant and reduce the ability of the drug to dissociate from the binding site. This is achieved by forming various non-covalent interactions between the small molecule and amino acids in the binding site, including: hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions, pi stacking, van der Waals interactions, and dipole–dipole interactions. Non-covalent metallo drugs have been developed. For example, dinuclear triple-helical compounds in which three ligand strands wrap around two metals, resulting in a roughly cylindrical tetracation have been prepared. These compounds bind to the less-common nucleic acid structures, such as duplex DNA, Y-shaped fork structures and 4-way junctions. = Protein folding and structure= Figure 7. Illustration of the main driving force behind protein structure formation. In the compact fold (to the right), the hydrophobic amino acids (shown as black spheres) are in general shielded from the solvent. The folding of most proteins from a primary (linear) sequence of amino acids to a three-dimensional structure is governed by many factors, including non-covalent interactions. The first ~5 milliseconds of folding are primarily dependent on van der Waals forces, whereby the protein folds so as to orient nonpolar amino acids in the interior of the globular protein, while more polar amino acid residues are exposed to aqueous solvent. This phase is known as the hydrophobic collapse, when nonpolar non-covalent interactions exclude water from the interior of the developing 3D protein structure. After this initial \\"burst phase,\\" more polar non-covalent interactions take over. Between 5 and 1000 milliseconds after protein folding initiation, three-dimensional structures of proteins, known as secondary and tertiary structures, are stabilized by formation of hydrogen bonds, in addition to disulfide bridges (covalent linkages). Through a series of small conformational changes, spatial orientations are modified so as to arrive at the most energetically minimized orientation achievable. The folding of proteins is often facilitated by enzymes known as molecular chaperones. Sterics, bond strain, and angle strain also play major roles in the folding of a protein from its primary sequence to its tertiary structure. Single tertiary protein structures can also assemble to form protein complexes composed of multiple independently folded subunits. As a whole, this is called a protein's quaternary structure. The quaternary structure is generated by the formation of relatively strong non-covalent interactions, such as hydrogen bonds, between different subunits to generate a functional polymeric enzyme. Some proteins also utilize non-covalent interactions to bind cofactors in the active site during catalysis, however a cofactor can also be covalently attached to an enzyme. Cofactors can be either organic or inorganic molecules which assist in the catalytic mechanism of the active enzyme. The strength with which a cofactor is bound to an enzyme may vary greatly; non-covalently bound cofactors are typically anchored by hydrogen bonds or electrostatic interactions. = Boiling points = Non-covalent interactions have a significant effect on the boiling point of a liquid. Boiling point is defined as the temperature at which the vapor pressure of a liquid is equal to the pressure surrounding the liquid. More simply, it is the temperature at which a liquid becomes a gas. As one might expect, the stronger the non-covalent interactions present for a substance, the higher its boiling point. For example, consider three compounds of similar chemical composition: sodium n-butoxide (C4H9ONa), diethyl ether (C4H10O), and n-butanol (C4H9OH). Figure 8. Boiling points of 4-carbon compounds The predominant non-covalent interactions associated with each species in solution are listed in the above figure. As previously discussed, ionic interactions require considerably more energy to break than hydrogen bonds, which in turn are require more energy than dipole–dipole interactions. The trends observed in their boiling points (figure 8) shows exactly the correlation expected, where sodium n-butoxide requires significantly more heat energy (higher temperature) to boil than n-butanol, which boils at a much higher temperature than diethyl ether. The heat energy required for a compound to change from liquid to gas is associated with the energy required to break the intermolecular forces each molecule experiences in its liquid state.

He was sent to schools in Normandy and Southampton, and completed his education at Pembroke College, Oxford. In 1777 he took orders. After holding a mastership at Bury, in 1781 he became head master of Reading Grammar School, a post which he held for fifty years. From 1787 he held also the rectory of Stradishall, Suffolk. During the early part of Valpy's long head-mastership the school flourished greatly. At least 120 boys attended it. He was the author of Greek and Latin grammars which enjoyed a large circulation. His Greek Delectus and Latin Delectus were long familiar to public school boys. He is said to have been a mighty flogger, and to have refused two bishoprics. In 1800 he was requested by his old pupils to sit for a full-length portrait and thirty years later, on the occasion of his jubilee, he was presented with a service of plate. Mary Russell Mitford has spoken of him as vainer than a peacock. The school was declining before Valpy's long reign closed. His successor was his son, Francis Valpy (1797-1882), appointed in 1830. Richard Valpy died in London. He is buried in an impressive mausoleum in front of the main chapel in Kensal Green Cemetery. A statue was erected in St. Lawrence's Church to commemorate him. He was also the father of printer and publisher Abraham John Valpy and of New Zealand pioneer William Henry Valpy.

JCShell  JCShell is a Java program, command line tool which also supports scripting. The JCShell scripting language is sophisticated to create test and verification scripts. JCShell has a plugin structure where existing base plugin (similar to Eclipse plugins) which supports the most basic on-card APDU commands such as raw send is extended with GlobalPlatform and crypto functionality. All the plugins are extendable by own functionality (in Java). There is a standalone JCShell version without the need to install Eclipse and an Eclipse-based version embedded in form of a View in the Debug perspective of JCOP Tools plugin.11 External links * Java Card technology page at Oracle * Java Card Forum * JavaCard development tools Category:Smart cards Category:Java platform Category:Embedded operating systems ","title":"Java Card OpenPlatform"},{"id":"2485042","text":"The Avoyel or Avoyelles were a small Native American tribe who at the time of European contact inhabited land near the mouth of the Red River at its confluence with the Atchafalaya River near present-day Marksville, Louisiana.

This is thought to either reflect their active trading of flint for tools from local sources on their land in the eponymously named modern Avoyelles Parish or more likely as their status as middlemen in trading flint from Caddoan peoples to their north to the stone deficit Atakapa and Chitimacha peoples of the Gulf Coast. The Avoyel were also known by the French as the petits Taensas (English: Little Taensa), who were mentioned in writings by explorer Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville in 1699.

LanguageHistory Described by some historians as being a Caddoan group, and by others as a Natchezan member of the Mary Haas' Gulf hypothesis Muskogean Language Macrofamily along with the Natchez and Taensa; their true linguistic and ethnic affiliation is somewhat uncertain because no written or spoken version of their language has survived. At the time of European contact they lived in a number of villages on the Red River in locations near present-day Alexandria and a palisaded village near Marksville. They controlled the river to its confluence with the lower Black River, Upper Atchafalaya River and the Mississippi. Never numerous, they are recorded by the French as numbering 280 in 1698, and with their population declining markedly after that. They were likely affected by the same drastic decimation as were other native groups, primarily due to new infectious diseases unwittingly carried by Europeans to which they had no acquired immunity. By 1805 the Avoyel were said to number only two or three women. The Avoyel survivors were believed to have been absorbed by marriage into the neighboring Tunica, Ofo, and Biloxi peoples who had moved to the area sometime in the late 1780s or 1790s because of encroachment by Euro-Americans at their previous locations.

The coast guard's responsibility are for fisheries inspection, customs enforcement, border control, law enforcement, shipping inspection, environmental protection, and search and rescue. It operates throughout Norway's exclusive economic zone (EEZ), internal waters and territorial waters. It is headquartered at Sortland Naval Base. In 2013 the Coast Guard had 370 employees, including conscripts, and a budget of 1.0 billion Norwegian krone. The force is subdivided into three main divisions. The Outer Coast Guard covers the EEZ and consists of three Nordkapp-class offshore patrol vessels, three Barentshav-class offshore patrol vessels as well as Ålesund, Svalbard and Harstad. The Inner Coast Guard consists of five Nornen-class patrol vessels. The Coast Guard has air support of the P-3 Orion patrol aircraft and Westland Lynx helicopters, both operated by the Royal Norwegian Air Force. The Westland Lynx is being phased out in Norwegian service, and replaced with the NH90. The Coast Guard has its basis in the defunct Fisheries Surveillance Service, which was established in 1908. It was a jointly military and civilian operation; it leased fishing vessels during the season to supplement larger navy vessels. This was converted into the Military Fisheries Surveillance in 1961. The Coast Guard was established on 1 April 1977, the same year as Norway delineated its EEZ. The restructuring led to the delivery of the Nordkapp-class and the Lynx helicopters. The Inner Coast Guard was established in 1996. The Coast Guard has participated in the 1990–91 Gulf War and the 2014 destruction of Syria's chemical weapons. Jurisdiction and capabilities The Coast Guard's main task is to assert and uphold Norwegian sovereignty over its inland waters, territorial waters and exclusive economic zone (EEZ). Its structure is centered around a peace-time role, with judicial basis in the Coast Guard Act (Kystvaktloven) of 1997. It states that the authority of the Coast Guard lies with the primary agency responsible for a situation and that the Coast Guard's powers supplement these. However, the Coast Guard also holds a series of independent capabilities in which it can take action without external instruction. The act also grants the Coast Guard law enforcement jurisdiction in given circumstances. NoCGV Nordkapp (W320) The Coast Guard is centered around providing services to a range of public agencies. These include the Coastal Administration, the Customs and Excise Authorities, the Directorate of Fisheries, the Environmental Agency, the Institute of Marine Research, the Mapping Authority, the Navy and the Police Service. This grants the Coast Guard a series of control rights including customs and border control for the Schengen Area. The most extensive work is carried out in relation to fisheries. This involves both inspection and assistance. Assistance duties to fishing vessels and other vessels at sea include firefighting, including the use of water cannons and smoke divers; removing foreign objects at sea; and mechanical help, diver assistance and towing for vessels which have experienced motor breakdown. Offshore vessels also feature equipment to contain oil spills. The Coast Guard is one of many agencies which can be called upon for search and rescue (SAR) missions. All such activity is either coordinated by the operations center of the respective police district, or by the Joint Rescue Coordination Centers in Southern Norway and Northern Norway, respectively.Ministry of Justice and the Police: 13 Structure The Norwegian Coast Guard is a formation within the Royal Norwegian Navy. It is led by the Inspector of the Norwegian Coast Guard, who is subordinate to the Inspector General of the Royal Norwegian Navy. The Coast Guard is one of two seaborne formations of the Navy, the other being the Norwegian Fleet. These share land-based support functions, such as naval bases and academies. Coast Guard vessels at Sortland Naval Base The Coast Guard had its command and operative headquarters at Sortland Naval Base in downtown Sortland. It has a secondary base at Haakonsvern in Bergen, which is the primary base of the Navy. The Coast Guard uses four shared naval schools, the Norwegian Naval Academy in Bergen, RNoMS Tordenskjold at Haakonsvern, RNoMS Harald Hårfagre in Stavanger and the Navy Officer Candidate Schools in Bergen. Unlike the rest of the Navy, the Coast Guard has some of its ships owned and partially operated by private contractors. Four vessels, those in the Barentshav-class and the Reine-class, are owned by Remøy Management. The Fosnavåg-based company leases the ships for a reported 160 million Norwegian krone per year to the Coast Guard. This includes all responsibility for maintenance and running of the galley and machine room. Ålesund is owned by Fosnavåg Shipping, while the Nornen-class is jointly owned by Remøy Management and Remøy Shipping. In 2012 the Coast Guard carried out about 1,700 inspections and issued warnings to about a quarter of these. It also participated in 171 search and rescue missions. In 2013 it had a revenue of NOK 1,027 million. It had 829 employees that year, consisting of 382 military, 18 civilian employees and 429 conscripts. It produced 3,812 patrol-days and flew 599 helicopter-hours. Coast Guard vessels have two crews, which alternate between being at sea and are on leave. This allows for high utilization of the fleet. Equipment The fleet consists of fourteen vessels; nine are part of the Outer Coast Guard and five are part of the Inner Coast Guard. The Coast Guard does not itself operate any aircraft; these are instead operated by the Royal Norwegian Air Force (RNoAF) or by private contractors. =Outer Coast Guard vessels= NoCGV Svalbard (W303) and Barentshav (W340) in Longyearbyen NoCGV Svalbard (W303) is the largest offshore patrol vessel and the only icebreaker in the fleet. As most of the Norwegian waters do not freeze there are no other vessels in need of this attribute. Svalbard has a displacement of 6,375 tonnes and an overall length of . It has a complement of 48, is armed with a Bofors 57 mm gun and can carry two helicopters. It predominantly serves Svalbard and the surrounding waters. The Coast Guard operates three Nordkapp- class offshore patrol vessels, Nordkapp (W320), Senja (W321) and Andenes (W322). They are predominantly used in the Barents Sea. They have a displacement of 3,200&tonnes; and an overall length of . They can operate at and have a crew of 50. They are armed with a Bofors 57 mm gun and four 20 mm guns. They have space for one helicopter and are equipped with two torpedo tubes. The Barentshav-class is made up of three vessels, Barentshav (W340), Bergen (W341) and Sortland (W342). Compared to older models they have been equipped with more extensive oil spill protection equipment. Supplemented with extensive firefighting and towing capabilities, they are built for expedient response for shipwrecking. They have a displacement of 4,000 tonnes, a length overall of and a speed of . Powered by liquefied natural gas, they have a crew of 40. NoCGV Ålesund (W312) dockside in Bergen NoCGV Harstad (W318) is primarily designed as a tow boat. It is well equipped to handle oil spills and is designed to handle both deep-submergence rescue vehicle and remotely controlled vehicles. It is equipped with a Bofors 40 mm gun. Harstad has a displacement of 3,130 tonnes, a length and a crew of 22. It has an exceptional range and is used to refuel the outposts on Jan Mayen, Bjørnøya and Hopen. NoCGV Ålesund (W312) is a general-purpose offshore patrol vessel. It operates in Southern Norway and is mostly used for fisheries inspection in the Norwegian Sea. It has a displacement of 1,357 tonnes, is long has a crew of 20 to 25. It is armed with a Bofors 40 mm gun. =Inner Coast Guard vessels= NoCGV Tor dockside in Bergen The Inner Coast Guard operates five Nornen-class patrol vessels, Nornen (W33), Farm (W331), Heimdal (W332), Njord (W333) and Tor (W334). They have a displacement of and a length overall of . They have a compartment of 20 crew and are armed with a 12.7 mm machine gun. Their diesel- electric engines provide a top speed of . =Aircraft= The 333 Squadron operates six Lockheed P-3N Orion anti-submarine and maritime patrol aircraft. During peacetime their main role is intelligence and surveillance through a range of data sensing equipment. The major advantage of the Orions is that they can cover a very large area; some missions allow it to monitor . During wartime they would be used for anti-submarine warfare and intelligence. The Orions have a range of and are based at Andøya Air Station. Lufttransport operates two Dornier Do 228 aircraft out of Svalbard Airport, Longyear. These fly a combined 400 hours per year for the Coast Guard for aerial surveillance of Svalbard. Westland Lynx helicopter landing on Senja (W321) The 337 Squadron operate six Westland Lynx Mk 86 helicopters for the Coast Guard. These can be stationed on the Nordkapp-class, the Barentshav-class and on Svalbard. They are used to extend the mobility and efficiency of the vessel's operation. At any given time at least two Coast Guard vessels have a Lynx on board, which remain on two-week cycles. They are predominantly used to patrol the coast off Troms, Finnmark and the Barents Sea, including the seas off Svalbard. The Lynxes have been plagued with technical problems causing them often to be out of service. The helicopters have a range of , are long and have a cruising speed of . Norway is in the process of replacing the Lynx with the NHIndustries NH90. Fourteen units have been ordered, of which eight are to be used with Coast Guard vessels. Six more will be used by the Fridtjof Nansen- class frigates. Operationally the helicopters are larger, with a length of , have a higher cruising speed of and have an improved range of . The Lynxes and NH90s are based at Bardufoss Air Station. HistoryPredecessors= HNoMS Heimdal in 1906 Following the dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905 there arose a debate concerning access to fishing in Norwegian territorial waters. The predominant concern was that Swedes were fishing in Norwegian waters. Norway declared a territorial water in 1906 and instructed the navy to take action against any foreign vessels fishing in those waters. The following year British fishing vessels started fishing along the coast of Finnmark. The fisheries inspection had an unarmed ship at the time, but asked for navy support. Eidsvold and Heimdal the following year was dispatched to aid. The first arrest of a foreign vessel took place in 1911 of a British trawler outside Varangerfjorden. The work was seasonal and was jointly financed by the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Fisheries. From 1914 it was entirely a military-funded operation. Later ships to participate were Farm and Valkyrje. HNoMS Nordkapp off Iceland between 1940 and 1945 From 1924 Michael Sars also participated in this work. The first dedicated coast guard vessel, Fridtjof Nansen, was commissioned in 1930. From 1937 it was supported by two smaller vessels, Nordkapp and Senja. Meanwhile, an espionage program was established to better locate illegal fisheries. All but Nordkapp were sunk in 1940 as part of the Second World War, although Senja was raised and repaired. After the end of the war, the fisheries surveillance services were reorganized. A number of whaling ships which had participated in the Arctic convoys were put into use as surveillance vessels while the navy focused on minesweeping. The surveillance was supplemented with Flower-class corvettes. Three used River-class frigates were taken into use in 1956, allowing Nordkapp to be decommissioned in 1956 and Senja two years later. The corvettes and later the frigates were used both for fisheries inspection and held in readiness for war. They, therefore, incurred high operational costs, were inefficient and had a large degree of conscripts. NoCGV Nysleppen was commissioned in 1967 The Ministry of Fisheries appointed a committee in 1958 to consider the organization, and it concluded that the inspections should be a military affair. This led to the establishment of the Military Fisheries Surveillance, which consisted of three squadrons. Two were subordinate to the Navy Commands in Northern and Western Norway, respectively, while the third, serving the Oslofjord, was subordinate to the Oslo office. Meanwhile, work started on planning a new class of patrol vessels, which resulted in the commissioning of the Farm-class patrol vessel in 1962 and 1963. They were supplemented in 1964 by the used civilian Andenes-class patrol vessels. =Establishment= Norway extended its fisheries zone to from 1 September 1961, although it kept the old definition of territorial waters. This followed Norway's participation in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, where there was a growing consensus for such an approach. Norway signed the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission in 1959, which took effect from 1970. This established common rules for fisheries within large parts of the European North Atlantic and standardized the inspection regimes. The surveillance ships carried out inspections during the fishing season and regularly caught foreign vessels using too small mesh size. However, few vessels were controlled due to the fleet's lack of suitability for the task. The issue was discussed in Parliament in 1973. After negotiations with the neighboring countries, a series of trawler-free zones were established. Norway continued to work towards international agreements to secure an EEZ, led by Jens Evensen. Norway's exclusive economic zone Parallel with this work the government started considering a new organization for the fisheries surveillance. The Stoltenberg Commission, led by Thorvald Stoltenberg, was appointed in April 1974 and published its report in June 1975. In Norway there has traditionally been a strong negative sentiment against allowing military forces to be used against civilians. The Military Fisheries Surveillance represented one of very few exceptions. Several organizational models were discarded, including a civilian agency, a continuation of an integrated model and a virtual coast guard made up of units from various branches. Instead the commission proposed that the coast guard be organized as a separate unit under the navy. An important argument was to avoid duplicating services, such as an operative headquarter and naval bases. Meanwhile, the coast guard could act as a military presence to assert sovereignty. The Coast Guard was originally organized with two squadrons. The location of the garrison for Northern Norway became a heated political debate. A commission led by Johan Jørgen Holst recommended either Ramsund, Sortland or Harstad, and the former received the majority vote in Parliament. The government followed up on the commission's report and established the Norwegian Coast Guard on 1 April 1977. At this time the Coast Guard had ten vessels in Northern Norway in addition to a seasonal fleet of up to thirty smaller, civilian vessels. Four vessels, all rented, were used in Southern Norway. The government funded the establishment with 1.4 billion Norwegian krone (NOK), of which 1.2 billion was to be used for new ships. Two new P-3B Orions were bought for the 333 Squadron and the Coast Guard paid an hourly lease for their use in maritime surveillance. The new agency received three new helicopter-capable offshore patrol vessels, the Nordkapp-class. These were delivered in 1981 and 1982. During the second half of the 1970s there was a discussion as two which helicopter should be procured. A government commission recommended the Sikorsky SH-60 Seahawk, but the Westland Lynx was eventually preferred due to faster delivery and lower price. To operate the six Lynxes, the 337 Squadron was established and became operational in 1983. The Andenes-class was retired, while the Farm-class vessels were rebuilt and remained in service. =Early operations= During the 1980s the Coast Guard's concentrated its work on fisheries surveillance. A major part of this involved inspection of the fisheries protection zones around Jan Mayen and Svalbard. Here Soviet and later Spanish fishing vessels were a major participant. The Coast Guard played a major role in assessing the amount of caught fish. In most cases where it found non-conformities the agency would issue warnings. In 1988 it carried out 1,273 inspections, of which 21 involved seizure and 16 were reported. However, written warnings were issued in 268 cases, and 106 oral warnings were given. Andenes carried out two research expeditions to the Antarctic, in 1984–85 and 1989–90 as part of the Pro Mare research program. It was also used to signal the territorial claim to Dronning Maud Land and the Weddell Sea. Andenes also participated in the Gulf War as Norway's participation. It acted as a support ship of the Royal Danish Navy's Olfert Fischer frigate. NoCGV Åhav, now retired Decreased fish stock during the 1990s resulted in more strict handling of violations. At the same time cooperation with neighboring countries improved. Greenlandic fishermen started fishing in the fisheries protection zones in 1991. In exchange for a Greenlandic acceptance of Norwegian and Russian management of the Barents Sea stocks, Greenland was issued quotas. This simply escalated the conflict, with Iceland joining fisheries from 1993. They claimed the protection zone was not valid in accordance with the Svalbard Treaty. The issue peaked on 5 August 1994, when Senja seized an Icelandic trawler. In 1997 the Coast Guard carried out 2,192 inspections, issued 566 warnings and seized 18 vessels. After whaling commenced in 1993, the Coast Guard was involved with in a series of skirmishes with vessels from Greenpeace and Sea Shepherd. The conflict with the latter peaked in 1994 with a collision between Andenes and Whales Forever. After this incident, the forceful threat from anti-whaling activists diminished. =Change of scope= Following the end of the Cold War there arose a debate regarding the Coast Guards scope. With a diminishing threat from Russia, the navy decided that it would downplay the military role of the Coast Guard. This would allow the Norwegian Fleet and the Coastal Artillery to focus on training while the Coast Guard would focus entirely on its core tasks. In line with the trend of new public management, the government was eager to introduce user payment for the Coast Guard. This would have involved the various civilian agencies, such as the JCRRs, having to pay for Coast Guard services. The Navy argued that a key role of the Coast Guard was a constant presence and that invoicing for use would decrease its efficiency since it had low marginal costs with participating in SAR missions. In the end user payment was abandoned. By the late 1980s the L-3B Orions were becoming obsolete. Five were therefore sold to the Spanish Air Force. Two were upgraded to the L-3N standard and four more new N-variants were bought. Most Coast Guard ships have been leased instead of owned. This was a continuation of the practice of the Military Fisheries Surveillance. At first, these were issued on short-term contracts, but from 1994 ten-year contracts were used instead. As part of this arrangement two new major ships were built, Ålesund and Tromsø. They were built based on specifications from the Coast Guard and included equipment for handling oil spills. NoCGV Tor (W334) near shore The Coast Guard underwent a major restructuring in the mid-1990s. The former services became the Outer Coast Guard (Ytre Kysvakt, YKV) while a new Inner Coast Guard (Indre Kystvakt, IKV) was established to patrol the territorial waters. The latter was based on seven patrol areas, each assigned one vessel. A new Coast Guard Act was passed in 1997 and took effect in 1999. This involved a clearer division of roles between the Norwegian Fleet and Coastal Artillery on the one hand, and the Coast Guard on the other. The goal was to allow for closer integration of the Coast Guard and other civilian search and rescue agencies. The relationship with Russia was complicated. In 1993 the Norwegian and Russian Coast Guard held a common conference in Sortland and since communication has eased and several top-level conferences have been held. Management in the Barents Sea is subordinate to the Joint Norwegian–Russian Fisheries Commission. Issues escalated in the early 2000s. In 2002 Russian inspectors boarded a Russian ship while it was being inspected by Norwegians. Three years later Elektron ran off with Norwegian inspectors on board. Njård assisting the Hurtigruten cruiseferry Richard With in Trondheim in 2009 Svalbard was commissioned in 2002 as the first icebreaking vessel of the Coast Guard. For the Inner Coast Guard, five Nornen-class patrol vessels were commissioned in 2007 and 2008. Harstad was commissioned in 2009 and was followed up with the tree vessels in the Barentshav-class for the Outer Coast Guard. Norway ordered fourteen NH90s in 2001. Eight of these were designated to the Coast Guard, while six will be used on the Fridtjof Nansen-class frigates. However, the first helicopter was not delivered until November 2011 and as of 2014 no Coast Guard variants have been completed. The Coast Guard was reorganized from 2012. After a controversy regarding the new location, the two squadrons were disbanded. The new structure has its head office at Sortland Naval Base. This allows all staff, previously with a command at Akershus Fortress in Oslo and the squadrons at Sortland and Haakonsvern to be co-located. All ships were subsequently re-registered with Sortland as their home port, although those based in Southern Norway retain use of Haakonsvern as their base. The Naval Home Guard commissioned two Reine-class patrol vessels in 2010. One of these were transferred to the Coast Guard in 2013. Andenes was dispatched to the Mediterranean Sea in May 2014 to participate in the destruction of Syria's chemical weapons. Replacing the frigate Helge Ingstad, Andenes was used to escort the freighter MV Taiko. Due to delays on the new replenishment oiler HNoMS Maud it was decided that both Reine-class patrol vessels would be transferred to the navy as auxiliary ships.

When the King's Guard returned to Edinburgh in 1972, Egelien arranged for the regiment to adopt a penguin. This penguin was named Nils Olav in honour of Nils Egelien and King Olav V of Norway. Sir Nils inspects troops of the King's Guard, of which he is colonel-in-chief, following his knighthood ceremony in 2008. Military insignia is attached to his right flipper. Nils Olav was initially given the rank of visekorporal (lance corporal) in the regiment. He has been promoted each time the King's Guard has returned to the zoo. In 1982 he was made a corporal, and promoted to sergeant in 1987. Nils Olav I died shortly after his promotion to sergeant in 1987, and his place was taken by Nils Olav II, a two-year-old near-double. He was promoted in 1993 to the rank of regimental sergeant major and in 2001 promoted to 'honourable regimental sergeant major'. On 18 August 2005, he was appointed as colonel-in-chief of the same regiment.Norwegian Consulate in Edinburgh.

During the ceremony a crowd of several hundred people watched the 130 guardsmen on parade at the zoo, and a citation from the King was read out, which described Nils as a penguin \\"in every way qualified to receive the honour and dignity of knighthood\\". The bronze statue of Nils Olav During the 2005 visit, a bronze statue of Nils Olav was presented to Edinburgh Zoo. The statue's inscription includes references to both the King's Guard and to the Military Tattoo. A statue also stands at the King's Guard compound at Huseby, Oslo. A third penguin, Nils Olav III, took over at some point between 2008 and 2016. On 22 August 2016 he was promoted to brigadier in a ceremony attended by over 50 members of the King's Guard.

Their traditional lands were along the Mattole and Bear Rivers near Cape Mendocino in Humboldt County, California. A notable difference between the Mattole and other indigenous peoples of California is that the men traditionally had facial tattoos (on the forehead), while other local groups traditionally restricted facial tattooing to women. Name The Wailaki name was Tul'bush (\\"foreigners\\"), the Cahto name was Diideeʾ-kiiyaahaangn (\\"The North Tribe\\"). The Bear River Indians called themselves and the Mattole Ni'ekeni'. Language The Mattole spoke the Mattole language, an Athapaskan language that may have been closely related to that of their Eel River neighbors to the east. According to linguist Victor Golla, the last surviving person who could speak the Mattole language died in the 1950s.Golla, Victor. 2011. California Indian Languages. University of California Press, 2011. Sociolinguistic description of aboriginal languages of California. Territory Historically, the Mattole lived along the Mattole River in the valley of Humboldt County, northwestern California. The Mattole lived in the area for a few centuries, but carbon dating revealed that many native tribes have inhabited the land for over 6000 years.Cooskey, Laura. \\"So... What Happened to the Natives Here?\\" Pdf. Accessed 18 May 2014. Earliest accounts say that the Mattole have been in the region of the Bear River tribe since the 16th century.Bussel, Gordon. \\"The Mattole.\\" Accessed February 16, 2014. From the mid-16th to the 19th centuries, the Mattole resided at the coast near the mouth of the river.California Coastal Commission. 1987. \\"California Coastal Resource Guide.\\" State of California. The Mattole were only permanent residents of a particular area through the winter months. For the most part, however, the Mattole people traveled in single family bands, traveling as necessary according to food abundance and better climate conditions—an easy feat with California's many microclimates. Aboriginal Bear River villages included Tcalko', Chilsheck, Chilenche, Selsche'ech, Tlanko, Estakana, and Sehtla. Way of Life The Mattole’s main food source has always been salmon. Salmon was a main food source because the Mattole were located along the Mattole river, which was abundant with Salmon. This also meant that the Mattole did not travel far from the river because that would mean abandoning their food source.Bussel, Gordon. n.d. The Mattole. (accessed February 16, 2014). From the beginning of the tribe’s 16th-century arrival in what is now Humboldt County, Mattole villages were essentially collective groups of families settling in close proximity over winter months. For the most part however, the Mattole people would travel in single family bands where necessary according to food abundance and better climate conditions, an easy feat with California’s many microclimates. As warmer seasons set in the Mattole Valley, the Mattole would separate into their primary familial groups, becoming gatherers of vegetation more—so than hunters as they would in colder months. As James Roscoe observed, \\"the simple family was by far the single most important social unit in Mattole society.\\" Tribes dealt with politics by electing tribesmen according to wealth and problem-solving skills rather than through bloodlines; These “chiefs,” as they were later named, weren’t complete rulers, but leaders of a democracy who made suggestions that would be taken into account by the rest of the tribe and decided upon through popular vote. Among the Mattole, conduct toward waves is prescribed: That water watches you and has a definite attitude, favorable or otherwise towards you. Do not speak just before a wave breaks. Do not speak to passing rough water in a stream. Do not look at water very long for any one time, unless you have been to this spot ten times or more. Then the water there is used to you and does not mind if you're looking at it. Older men can talk in the presence of the water because they have been about so long that the water knows them. Until the water at any spot does know you, however, it becomes very rough if you talk in its presence or look at it too long. Post-contact history In the mid- to late-19th century, tensions rose between white settlers and the Native Americans. In 1856 the Mendocino reservation was established for the Indian tribes. It ranged from Mendocino county to Bear River. When the white settlers began establishing their homes in the Mattole valley in 1857, there was much conflict among the Indian tribes. The white settlers argued that the reservation was claiming lands that it should not be. The Mattole felt threatened because the white settlers were moving into their area and taking their women. The white settlers and Indian tribes—including the Mattole, were ruthlessly killing each other. Prison camps housed many Mattole and other Native Americans. On September 4, 1858, amidst the constant fighting, the Mattole Valley Treaty of Peace was established.Bledsoe, Anthony Jennings. 1885. Indian Wars of the Northwest: A California Sketch. Bacon and Company. Print. Although the treaty seemed to be keeping the peace among both groups, it eventually became useless in 1859 when the reservation was no longer considered a reservation and more white settlers were coming in. Population Estimates for the pre-contact populations of most native groups in California have varied substantially. (See Population of Native California.) Alfred L.

Mississippi kites have narrow, pointed wings and are graceful in flight, often appearing to float in the air. It is not uncommon to see several circling in the same area. Description Adults are gray with darker gray on their tail feathers and outer wings and lighter gray on their heads and inner wings.http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Ictinia_mississippiensis.html Males and females look alike, but the males are slightly paler on the head and neck. Young kites have banded tails and streaked bodies. It is 12 to 15 inches (30–37 cm) beak to tail and has a wingspan averaging 3 feet (91 cm). Weight is from 214 to 388 grams (7.6-13.7 oz). Their call is a high-pitched squeak, sounding similar to that of a squeaky toy. Diet Their diet consists mostly of insects which they capture in flight. They eat cicada, grasshoppers, and other crop-damaging insects, making them economically important. They have also been known to eat small vertebrates, including birds, amphibians, reptiles, and small mammals. Breeding Mississippi kites breed across the central and southern United States. Breeding territory has expanded in recent years and Mississippi kites have been regularly recorded in the southern New England states and a pair has successfully raised young as far north as Newmarket, New Hampshire.\\"Bird Unseen in N.H. Spotted in Newmarket\\", WMUR-TV, [ They migrate to southern subtropical South America in the winter. Mississippi kites usually lay two white eggs (rarely one or three) in twig nests that rest in a variety of deciduous trees. In the past 75 years, they have undergone changes in nesting habitat from use of forest and savanna to include shelterbelts and are now very common nesters in urban area that are highly populated in the western south-central states. Mississippi kites nest in colonies and both parents (paired up before arriving at the nesting site) incubate the eggs and care for the young. They have one clutch a year which takes 30 to 32 days to hatch. The young birds leave the nest another 30 to 35 days after hatching. Only about half of kites successfully raise their young. Clutches fall victim to storms and predators such as raccoons and great horned owls. Because of the reduced amount of predators in urban areas, Mississippi kites produce more offspring in urban areas than rural areas. They have an average lifespan of 8 years. Conservation While the Mississippi kite is not an endangered species, it is protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, which protects the birds, their eggs, and their nests (occupied or empty) from being moved or tampered with without the proper permits. This can make the bird somewhat of a nuisance when it chooses to roost in populated urban spots such as golf courses or schools. The birds protect their nests by diving at perceived threats, including humans. Staying at least 50 yards from nests is the best way to avoid conflict with the birds. If unavoidable, wearing a hat or waving hands in the air should prevent contact from being made but will not prevent the diving behavior.

Biography  Armstrong was born in Huntley Township, Carleton County, Ontario, the son of Hugh Armstrong, and was educated at Manitoba public schools. He received a Bachelor of Laws degree from the University of Manitoba. He was called to the Manitoba bar in 1905 and practised law in Manitou.

He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1915 provincial election, defeating Conservative W.H. Sharpe by 84 votes in the constituency of Manitou. The Liberals won a landslide majority in this election, and Armstrong served as a backbench supporter of Tobias Norris's government for the next five years. He ran for re-election in the 1920 campaign but finished third against Conservative John Ridley, losing by 284 votes. In 1929, Armstrong was named county court judge for the southern judicial district of Manitoba. He died in Morden after an extended illness at the age of 60.

Similar reactions occur when tertiary phosphines are treated with alkyl halides. Menshutkin- reaction The reaction is the method of choice for the preparation quaternary ammonium salts. Some phase transfer catalysts (PTC) can be prepared according to the Menshutkin reaction, for instance the synthesis of triethyl benzyl ammonium chloride (TEBA) from triethylamine and benzyl chloride: Menshutkin reaction Scope Reactions are typically conducted in polar solvents such as alcohols. Alkyl iodides are superior alkylating agents relative to the bromides, which in turn are superior to chlorides. As is typical for an SN2 process, benzylic, allylic, and α-carbonylated alkyl halides are excellent reactants. Even though alkyl chlorides are poor alkylating agents (gem- dichlorides especially so), amines should not be handled in chlorinated solvents such as dichloromethane and dichloroethane, especially at high temperatures, due to the possibility of a Menshutkin reaction. (Sometimes, kinetically facile reactions like acylations are sometimes conducted in chlorinated solvents nonetheless.) Highly nucleophilic tertiary amines like DABCO will react with dichloromethane at room temperature overnight and at reflux (39-40 °C) over several hours to give the quaternized product (see the article on Selectfluor). Due to steric hindrance and unfavorable electronic properties, chloroform reacts very slowly with tertiary amines over a period of several weeks to months. Even pyridines, which are considerably less nucleophilic than typical tertiary amines, react with dichloromethane at room temperature over a period of several days to weeks to give bis(pyridinium)methane salts.Reaction of Dichlormethane with Pyridine Derivatives under Ambient Conditions Alexander B.

The building has a just under of floor space, making it the largest dorm not only on Cornell campus, but in the entire Ivy League. Dickson, as it is more commonly known, also has a notoriously awkward numbering system for rooms. Room numbers start with the floor the room is on, followed by a number indicating which side of the building they are on; rooms in the southwest are said to be on the \\"5\\" side and rooms in the northeast half are said to be on the \\"6\\" side. Furthermore, the basement (which is the building's ground floor at the back side due to its being on a hill) is labeled as the first floor. So, for example, a room on the first floor, on the far left side of the building (when looking at it from the front) would be said to be in \\"2-5\\". All room numbers are 4 digits, with the last two increasing as one moves toward the center of Dickson. For example, 2692 is the closest room to the middle on the 6 side.

It is the tenth-largest park in New York City and the third-largest in Queens. Created on August 9, 1895, it was originally referred to as Brooklyn Forest Park, as the area was part of Brooklyn at the time. The park contains of trees, including the largest continuous oak forest in Queens. Some trees are more than a century and a half old. The park sits on hills left behind by the Wisconsin glacier and is a haven for native plants and wildlife in the midst of the city's sprawl. In addition to the park's large full-time bird population, migratory birds pass through in the spring and fall. Several trails are available for area residents and urban day hikers. Other facilities include playgrounds, a carousel, a running track, two dog runs, a pond, tennis courts, basketball courts, baseball fields, and a golf course. The park is operated and maintained by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation.City of New York; The Green Book Official Directory of the City of New York 2005-2006 Edition; P.265. HistoryEarly development= Montauk Branch railroad tracks in the park The Wisconsinian glaciation molded this land between 20,000 and 10,000 years ago and left the Harbor Hill Moraine, a series of small hills known as “knob and kettle” terrain, including Forest Park. The land was inhabited by the Rockaway, Lenape, and Delaware Native Americans when the Dutch West India Company settled the area in 1635. The site of Forest Park was occupied by various landowners until the late 19th century, when City of Brooklyn officials looked for land for a large public park. In 1892, the New York State Legislature authorized the park search, and the Brooklyn Parks Department purchased the first parcel of this space on August 9, 1895, whereupon the name Brooklyn Forest Park was first used. Because of the numerous private landowners involved, the park had to be assembled in 124 parcels, finishing in 1898. James S. T. Stranahan, the onetime President of the Brooklyn Board of Park Commissioners, originally envisioned one large park extending eastward to Jamaica, Queens and westward to Park Slope, Brooklyn. However, the city's rapid development made this impossible, and today, the largest remnants of this proposed landscape are Forest Park and the Prospect Park in Brooklyn. Starting in 1896, the landscaping firm of Olmsted, Olmsted & Eliot was contracted to provide a plan for the park. Frederick Law Olmsted surveyed the park and designed Forest Park Drive. Existing residential buildings were auctioned and disassembled and removed. A nine-hole golf course opened in 1901. Its club house, which was designed in the Dutch Colonial Revival style by the firm of Helmle, Huberty & Hudswell (who also designed the Williamsburgh Savings Bank Tower), and which now houses the park's Administration Office, first opened in 1905. Carousels designed by Daniel Muller were added in 1918; one of them was destroyed by fire in 1966, and the other in 1972. Jackson Pond was used for fishing and ice skating, but was filled in for redevelopment. =Recent development= During the park's centennial celebration in 1995, 100 trees were planted as a part of Operation Pine Grove, funded by American Forests and the Texaco Global Re-leaf Program. Parks uses the greenhouse, built in 1910, to grow trees and plants for many other city parks. In addition, the kettle ponds in the forest provide a haven for bird watching. Forest Park Drive between the Bandshell and the entrance to the Jackie Robinson Parkway rides along the top of the glacial moraine. In the winter, when the trees are bare, people who walk or drive along the route can see a panoramic view of Southeast and Southwest Queens, JFK Airport, Southeast Brooklyn, and all the way to Rockaway Beach nearly away. A number of the parks' trees were destroyed in Hurricane Sandy and one fallen tree damaged the structure housing the Forest Park Carousel, but the damage was repaired and the carousel reopened in March 2013. The Forest Park Carousel was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. Features Recreation and events = Within Forest Park is \\"The Overlook\\", the administration building for Queens Parks, and \\"Oak Ridge\\", the former golf-course clubhouse and current administration building for Forest Park. Forest Park also offers a wide array of recreational facilities, the Carousel, playgrounds, a pond, a barbecue area, the George Seuffert, Sr. Bandshell, a nature center, and two dog runs. Dogs can run off leash here, and there is a separate area for small dogs. Therapeutic horseback riding for people with special needs is also available in the park. Annual events such as the Halloween Walk, the Victorian Christmas, Nature Trails Day, orienteering and battle re-enactments draw the participation of the surrounding neighborhoods of Kew Gardens, Woodhaven, Richmond Hill, Forest Hills, and Glendale. = Landscape features = Strack Pond is a glacial kettle pond located inside the park near Woodhaven Boulevard and Forest Park Drive. The pond, named after a local resident killed in the Vietnam War, was buried in 1966 and restored four decades later.  Wildlife and vegetation  Forest Park in early Spring Birds common to Forest Park include red-tailed hawks, woodpeckers, the great blue herons, mallards, northern orioles, American kestrels, ruby throated hummingbirds, ring-necked pheasants, common flickers, eastern pewees, the tufted titmouse, white- breasted nuthatches, wood thrushes, the red-eyed vireo, red-winged blackbirds, scarlet tanagers, the rufous-sided towhee, and sparrows. A great variety of warblers often pass through in the spring. According to the New York City Parks Department, more than 100 species of migratory birds visit the park each year. Forest Park Sunset in Winter Chipmunks become visibly active in spring, along with the squirrels, raccoons, and skunks that are more often seen year- round. Turtles sun themselves in Strack Pond on warm days. On summer nights, cicada song fills the area and surrounding neighborhoods. Toads also can be heard croaking in the evenings. In mid-summer, hatching butterflies begin to gravitate to the Joe Pye Weed, dogbane, milkweed, thistle, and other native plants. Fall brings spectacular color, as many varieties of trees prepare to drop their leaves. Several species of hawks pass through. Winter is quiet, featuring the occasional tracks of small mammals in snow. Forest Park's trees include the Northern red oak (Quercus rubra), Scarlet oak (Quercus coccinea), Tulip tree (Liriodendron tulipifera), Shagbark hickory (Carya ovata), White oak (Quercus alba), American beech (Fagus grandifolia), American sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), and Black cherry (Prunus serotina). Several trees in the park are more than 150 years old, and create a canopy with an under- layer of Dogwood (Cornus), Virginia creeper (Parthenocissus quinquefolia), Sassafras (Sassafras albidum), and Corktree (Genus Phellodendron). Wildflowers such as white wood aster cover the forest floor in spring, as the azaleas, dogwoods, forsythia, and other flowering plants begin to bloom. The park was ravaged in 1912 by the chestnut blight, and for a time was used for lumbering; about the same time, greenhouses were set up to grow plants for parks throughout the city. These have since been moved to the Brooklyn Botanic Garden and Bronx Park. Transportation Public transport = Forest Park is accessible by the IND Queens Boulevard Line () of the New York City Subway at Kew Gardens–Union Turnpike. The southern part of the park is accessible via the BMT Jamaica Line () at 75th Street–Elderts Lane, 85th Street–Forest Parkway, and Woodhaven Boulevard. The Q56 bus runs just south of the park along Jamaica Avenue and the Q11, Q21, Q52 SBS, and Q53 SBS routes run along Woodhaven Boulevard. The Q37 runs along Park Lane South in Kew Gardens and Richmond Hill, while the Q55 bus is straddled by the park along Myrtle Avenue. = Other = In 1895, Olmsted observed that two lines of the Long Island Rail Road—the Montauk Branch and the Rockaway Beach Branch—had run through the land before Forest Park was acquired. Of these, only the Montauk Branch still sees any train service. Forest Park is also divided by Woodhaven Boulevard and the Jackie Robinson Parkway (formerly Interboro Parkway), which was completed in 1935. Despite these thoroughfares, Forest Park is the third-largest park in Queens, and contains the largest continuous oak forest in Queens and a golf course. Forest Park is bounded by Myrtle Avenue, Union Turnpike, Park Lane, Park Lane South and Cypress Hills Cemetery. The Brooklyn-Queens Greenway bike path also runs through Forest Park, connecting westward to Ridgewood Reservoir and eastward to Kew Gardens.

He played number eight and captained the South African national team, the Springboks, between 1995 and 1999. Teichmann stands 1.95 metres tall and weighed about 100 kilograms for most of his career. His humility and fair play earned him wide respect throughout the rugby world. Early career Teichmann was born in Gwelo, Rhodesia. He moved to South Africa with his family when he was 11 years old. He was educated at Hilton College. Teichmann started his career playing club rugby for the University of Natal team in Pietermaritzburg before being spotted by the Natal Province's Currie Cup team in 1991. He was soon promoted to captain by then Natal coach Ian McIntosh and played for Natal in three Currie Cup victories in 1992, 1995 and 1996 (Captain in 1995 and 1996). The team under Teichmann also finished in second place in 1993 and 1999 and made it to the final of the Super 10 (the precursor to the Super 12 and Super 14) competition in 1994. The Natal Currie Cup team became the core of the team now known as the Sharks when the Super 12 competition began in 1996, and Teichmann also captained that side. After the team was renamed the Sharks in 1998 he led them to the final of the Super 12. In all, Teichmann represented Natal and the Sharks in 144 matches. Springbok captain In 1993 he was selected for the Springbok tour to Argentina, and in 1994 he was again selected as part of the squad that toured Wales and Scotland. It wasn't until 2 September 1995 that he played his first full international as a Springbok however. He scored a try in his debut test as the Springboks went on to defeat Wales 40–11 at Ellis Park. After playing only 6 test matches for the Springboks, Teichmann was appointed as captain of the squad in 1996, and went on to become one of South Africa's most successful captains ever. He captained the Springboks in 39 tests between 1996 and 1999 with 27 of those (72%) ending in victory. The Springboks, with Teichmann at the helm, were considered by many the greatest South African team in history. Between 1997 and 1998 the Springboks went on a record winning streak of 17 consecutive test matches. As part of their unbeaten run they won the 1998 Tri Nations Series undefeated, beating both Australia and New Zealand away from home. They kicked off the feat with a record dismantling of Australia to win 61–22 at Loftus Versfeld in Pretoria and ended with a defeat against England at Twickenham at the end of a long tour. A list of record victories during that period includes: * 23 July 1997: South Africa 61–22 Australia at Loftus Versfeld, Pretoria * 22 November 1997: South Africa 52–10 France at Parc des Princes, Paris * 6 December 1997: South Africa 68–10 Scotland at Murrayfield, Edinburgh * 27 July 1998: South Africa 96–13 Wales at Loftus Versfeld, Pretoria Although not records, they also beat Ireland 33–0 at Loftus and Italy 74–3 in Port Elizabeth. In all Teichmann played 42 tests for the Springboks, and held the record for the most consecutive test matches played for the Springboks with 39. This has since been surpassed by another Springbok captain, John Smit. Later years In 1999 coach Nick Mallett, who thought that Teichmann had lost most of his form, controversially dropped him from the squad shortly before the 1999 Rugby World Cup. The Springbok squad's performance suffered after Teichmann was dropped until 2000 when Mallett resigned as coach of the Springboks. Mallett has since admitted that with the benefit of hindsight, dropping Teichmann was a big mistake. Teichmann described himself as \\"gutted\\" after being left out of the squad. He moved to Wales where he played for the Newport club. He captained Newport to their first Principality Cup win in 24 years in 2001, announcing his retirement from rugby shortly after. He also wrote his autobiography, \\"For The Record\\", during this time. As of 2005 Teichmann serves in an advisory capacity on the board of The Sharks (Pty) Ltd. He lives in Durban and runs a successful earthmoving business. Has a beautiful older daughter, Danielle.

Roth, section titled \\"Charles McLean Andrews\\", pp 145–146 He wrote 102 major scholarly articles and books, as well as over 360 book reviews, newspaper articles, and short items.Kross, p 18 He is especially known as a leader of the \\"Imperial school\\" of historians who studied, and generally admired the efficiency of the British Empire in the 18th century. Kross argues: :His intangible legacy is twofold. First is his insistence that all history be based on facts and that the evidence be found, organized, and weighed. Second is his injunction that colonial America can never be understood without taking into account England. Life and recognition Born in Wethersfield, Connecticut, his father, William Watson Andrews, was a minister in the Catholic Apostolic Church. Andrews received his A.B. from Trinity College, Hartford, Conn., in 1884 and spent two years as principal of West Hartford High School before entering graduate school at Johns Hopkins University. At Johns Hopkins, Andrews studied under Herbert Baxter Adams and received the Ph.D. in 1889. He was a professor at Bryn Mawr College (1889–1907) and Johns Hopkins University (1907–1910) before going to Yale University. He was the Farnam Professor of American History at Yale from 1910 to his retirement in 1931. He served as acting president of the American Historical Association in 1924 after the death of Woodrow Wilson, and then president in his own right in 1925. He held various memberships including the American Philosophical Society, the Royal Historical Society, the American Academy of Arts and Letters, and Phi Beta Kappa. He was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1907,American Antiquarian Society Members Directory and elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1918. Andrews won the Pulitzer Prize in history in 1935 for the first volume of his four-volume work The Colonial Period of American History. He was awarded the gold medal, given once a decade, by the National Institute of Arts and Letters for his work in history, and he received honorary doctorates from Harvard, Yale, Johns Hopkins, and Lehigh University. He married Evangline Holcombe Walker; their daughter Ethel married John Marshall Harlan II, who became an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States in 1954. Andrews died in New Haven,CT. Approach to history His Yankee ancestors had been in Connecticut for seven generations, so his interest in American colonial history, including the history of Connecticut, is unsurprising (his first book, The River Towns of Connecticut, published in Baltimore in 1889, was about the settlement of Wethersfield, Hartford, and Windsor). Yet Andrews was not uncritical of early New England. Along with Herbert L. Osgood of Columbia University, Andrews led a new approach to American colonial history, which has been called the \\"imperial\\" interpretation. Andrews and Osgood emphasized the colonies' imperial ties to Great Britain, and both wrote seminal articles on the subject in the Annual Report of the American Historical Association for the Year 1898.Charles M. Andrews, \\"American Colonial History, 1690–1750,\\" Annual Report of the American Historical Association for the Year 1898 (1899): 47–60, in Internet Archive; Herbert L. Osgood, \\"Study of American Colonial History,\\" Annual Report of the American Historical Association for the Year 1898 (1899): 61–76, in Internet Archive Rather than emphasizing conscious British tyranny leading up to the American Revolution, in works such as The Colonial Period (New York, 1912), he saw the clash as the inevitable result of the inability of British statesmen to understand the changes in society in America. Andrews' thorough research into archival sources, and a demonstration of scholarship through many books and articles, set a standard that led his colleagues to praise him as the \\"dean\\" of colonial historians.Kross, p 9 Among his students at Yale who went on to become colonial historians and future leaders of the \\"imperial\\" school were Leonard Woods Labaree, Lawrence Henry Gipson, Isabel M. Calder, and Beverley W.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba as a Liberal for Rhineland from 1892 to 1900, and again from 1900 to 1920. Winkler was a cabinet minister in the government of Tobias Norris. His brother, Enoch Winkler, was also a member of the provincial legislature from 1888 to 1899. Winkler was born in Neustadt, Grey County, Canada West (now Ontario), and educated at public schools in the area. He moved to Manitoba in 1879 after the death of his father, and worked in his brother Enoch Winkler's lumberyard. In 1883, he began his own grain and lumber business in Morden. He began farming in 1888. After the incorporation of the Municipality of Stanley in 1890, Winkler was chosen as the community's first reeve. He served in this position until 1892. In the same year, the village of Winkler was established in Manitoba, named after him. He ran a grain elevator and lumber business in the community. Winkler was also an active freemason. He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1892 provincial election, defeating Conservative candidate N. Bowman by 186 votes to 74 in the constituency of Rhineland. The Liberals won a majority government in this election, and Winkler served as a backbench supporter of Thomas Greenway's government. He was re-elected over Bowman by an increased margin in the 1896 campaign. The Liberals were defeated in the 1899 provincial election, although Winkler retained his seat with a victory over Conservative candidate W.J. Potter. He resigned his seat in 1900 to run for the House of Commons of Canada in the 1900 federal election, as a candidate of the Liberal Party of Canada in the riding of Lisgar. He narrowly lost to independent candidate Robert Lorne Richardson, 3,392 votes to 3,143. Winkler's son later wrote that his father was not keen on entering federal politics, but ran at the behest of Clifford Sifton, a prominent cabinet minister from Manitoba. Twelve days after the federal election, Winkler was narrowly re-elected in a by-election to serve Rhineland again in the provincial legislature. He defeated Bowman again, 185 votes to 174. Winkler was re-elected by an increased margin in the 1903 provincial election, and again in the elections of 1907, 1910 and 1914. In 1914, he defeated future Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba William Johnston Tupper by 132 votes. The Conservative administration of Rodmond Roblin governed the province throughout this period, and Winkler served as a member of the opposition. In 1915, Roblin was forced to resign from office after the Lieutenant Governor found his ministry guilty of corruption in the tendering of contracts for new legislative buildings. Although the Liberals did not command a majority in the legislature, they were called upon to form a new administration. Tobias Norris became Premier of Manitoba on May 15, 1915, and appointed Winkler as his Minister of Agriculture and Immigration. A new election was called in 1915, which the Liberals won with a landslide majority. Winkler defeated Tupper a second time, and was retained as Agriculture and Immigration minister in Norris's government. Winkler was an activist Minister of Agriculture. He passed the Settlers Animal Purchase Act, which allowed new settlers in Interlake to purchase cattle on credit, and the Seed Grain Act, allowing municipalities to purchase seed on credit. He was also responsible for Manitoba's Farm Implements Act and Producer Dealers Act. Winkler died of diabetes while campaigning for re-election in the provincial campaign of 1920. It may be noted that insulin was not discovered until two years later. Winkler's son, Howard Winkler, was a federal Liberal Member of Parliament from 1935 to 1953.

Using an exact test provides a significance test that keeps the Type I error rate of the test (\\\\alpha) at the desired significance level of the test. For example an exact test at significance level of \\\\alpha = 5%, when repeating the test over many samples where the null hypotheses is true, will reject at most 5% of the time. This is opposed to an approximate test in which the desired type I error rate is only approximately kept (i.e.: the test might reject more than 5% of the time), while this approximation may be made as close to \\\\alpha as desired by making the sample size big enough. Exact tests that are based on discrete test statistic may be conservative tests, i.e. that its actual rejection rate is below the nominal significance level \\\\alpha. For example, this is the case for Fisher's exact test and also its more powerful alternative, Boschloo's test. If the test statistic is continuous, it will reach the significance level exactly . Parametric tests, such as those described in exact statistics, are exact tests when the parametric assumptions are fully met, but in practice the use of the term exact (significance) test is reserved for those tests that do not rest on parametric assumptions – non-parametric tests . However, in practice most implementations of non-parametric test software use asymptotical algorithms for obtaining the significance value, which makes the implementation of the test non-exact. So when the result of a statistical analysis is said to be an “exact test” or an “exact p-value”, it ought to imply that the test is defined without parametric assumptions and evaluated without using approximate algorithms. In principle however it could also mean that a parametric test has been employed in a situation where all parametric assumptions are fully met, but it is in most cases impossible to prove this completely in a real world situation. Exceptions when it is certain that parametric tests are exact include tests based on the binomial or Poisson distributions. Sometimes permutation test is used as a synonym for exact test, but although all permutation tests are exact tests, not all exact tests are permutation tests. Exact tests The basic equation underlying exact tests is :\\\\Pr(\\\\text{exact})=\\\\sum_{\\\\mathbf{y}\\\\,:\\\\,T(\\\\mathbf{y})\\\\ge T(\\\\mathbf{x)}} \\\\Pr(\\\\mathbf{y}) where: :*x is the outcome actually observed, :*Pr(y) is the probability under the null hypothesis of a potentially observed outcome y, :*T(y) is the value of the test statistic for an outcome y, with larger values of T representing cases which notionally represent greater departures from the null hypothesis, and where the sum ranges over all outcomes y (including the observed one) that have the same value of the test statistic obtained for the observed sample x, or a larger one .  Example: Pearson's chi-squared test versus an exact test  A simple example of the occasion for this concept may be seen by observing that Pearson's chi-squared test is an approximate test. Suppose Pearson's chi-squared test is used to ascertain whether a six-sided die is \\"fair\\", i.e. gives each of the six outcomes equally often. If the die is thrown n times, then one \\"expects\\" to see each outcome n/6 times. The test statistic is : \\\\sum \\\\frac{(\\\\text{observed}-\\\\text{expected})^2}{\\\\text{expected}} = \\\\sum_{k=1}^6 \\\\frac{(X_k - n/6)^2}{n/6}, where Xk is the number of times outcome k is observed. If the null hypothesis of \\"fairness\\" is true, then the probability distribution of the test statistic can be made as close as desired to the chi- squared distribution with 5 degrees of freedom by making the sample size n big enough. But if n is small, then the probabilities based on chi-squared distributions may not be very close approximations. Finding the exact probability that this test statistic exceeds a certain value then requires combinatorial enumeration of all outcomes of the experiment that result in such a large value of the test statistic. Moreover, it becomes questionable whether the same test statistic ought to be used. A likelihood-ratio test might be preferred as being more powerful, and the test statistic might not be a monotone function of the one above.  Example: Fisher's exact test  Fisher's exact test, based on the work of Ronald Fisher and E. J. G. Pitman in the 1930s, is exact because the sampling distribution (conditional on the marginals) is known exactly. Compare Pearson's chi-squared test, which (although it tests the same null) is not exact because the distribution of the test statistic is correct only asymptotically.

Of Choctaw heritage, she moved with her family to Kansas City, Missouri after her father took a new position with the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad. Hightower began her dance training in Kansas City under the instruction of Dorothy Perkins.Anderson, Jack. \\"Rosella Hightower, Prima Ballerina and School Founder, Is Dead at 88\\", The New York Times, November 4, 2008. Accessed November 5, 2008. After a 1937 appearance by Russian choreographer and ballet dancer Léonide Massine in Kansas City with Wassily de Basil's Ballets Russes, Massine invited Hightower to join a new ballet company he was forming in Monte Carlo. Hightower traveled to France at her own expense and discovered that she had been invited for further auditions and had been given no commitment of employment by the group. She was ultimately accepted into the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo where she was guided by Massine who recognized her hard work and ability to learn quickly. There she met André Eglevsky, her future partner at various dance companies. After the outbreak of World War II, Hightower followed the Ballet Russe to New York City, where she joined the Ballet Theater in 1941. She joined the de Basil Ballet in 1946, which was performing under the name Original Ballet Russe. Hightower received acclaim from John Martin of The New York Times after a March 1947 performance of Giselle by the Original Ballet Russe at the Metropolitan Opera House. After Alicia Markova, who had been scheduled to dance the title role, became sick, Hightower was called in as her replacement, and learned the part she had never danced before in some five hours of rehearsal with dancer/choreographer Anton Dolin. Martin's review stated that the \\"Original Ballet Russe had planned no novelty for the opening of its season... but there was a major one on its program nevertheless. This was the unscheduled first appearance of Rosella Hightower in the title role of Giselle\\", calling it \\"a thoroughly admirable achievement, which brought an ovation from the audience\\".Martin, John. \\"Rosella Hightower Scores in Giselle Role, Replacing Markova, as Ballet Russe Opens\\", The New York Times, March 21, 1947.

Three days later, Martin's review of Swan Lake called Hightower \\"the newest star on the ballet horizon\\" after her two performances with Dolin and then André Eglevsky as her partnerMartin, John. \\"THE BALLET RUSSE AT METROPOLITAN; Rosella Hightower Seen Twice in 'Swan Lake\\" – Monte Carlo Troupe at City Center\\", The New York Times, March 24, 1947. Accessed November 5, 2008. In 1947, she accepted an invitation from the Marquis George de Cuevas to join a new ballet company, which was variously called the Grand Ballet de Monte Carlo or the Grand Ballet du Marquis de Cuevas, but was most commonly called the de Cuevas Ballet by theatergoers. The presence there of choreographer Bronislava Nijinska was one of the major factors in Hightower's decision. Nijinska choreographed for Hightower the \\"glitteringly virtuosic\\" Rondo Capriccioso. In addition to classic dances, Hightower's performances included Piège de Lumière by John Taras, the troupe's choreographer and balletmaster, in which she danced the role of a butterfly in a tropical forest who enchants a group of escaped convicts. The company disbanded after the 1961 death of de Cuevas, and Hightower largely retired from the stage, though she gave a series of performances in 1962 with Sonia Arova, Erik Bruhn and Rudolf Nureyev. She opened the École supérieure de danse de Cannes in 1962 near her home in Cannes, which became one of Europe's leading ballet schools.

Loosely based on Boris Barnet's 1933 film Outskirts, it was directed and written by Pyotr Lutsik. Synopsis The film starts as parody of a Soviet-era socialist realist film-making of the 1930s (The title is taken from the classic 1933 film by the Soviet filmmaker Boris Barnet, in which the beginning of the farm collectivization era is depicted.) Peaceful life of farmers of remote Uralian village is interrupted when their former collective farm is sold. The toughest ones unite and track down the offenders one by one. Their quest for truth and justice is very violent, although almost all the violence occurs off screen, and often we are unsure of the victims fate. The movie was shot in black and white and the music is old Soviet movie music, so it is hard to determine when the events are happening – around World War II or maybe even today. Hence it could be interpreted as attack on modern capitalism in Russia. To clarify about the violence. An oil company and bureaucrats connive to steel ownership of farming village, 1 got dunked in ice water and talked, 2nd got beat and talked when his kids were put on the oven, 3rd talked after being bit in the dark but died from fear afterwards, 4th was stabbed and strangled then burned to death with two of his bodyguards as the entire oil company building burnt to the ground with all the oil land certificates.

It has a population of 179,797 (2002 census). In the past it was an important port city in its own right, but is now a suburb of Dakar. Rufisque is also the capital of the department of the same name and lies south-east of Dakar, the capital of Senegal.  History  Rufisque train station, 1910. Originally a Lebou fishing village called Tenguedj (), Rufisque became important in the 16th century as the principal port of the kingdom of Cayor, being frequented by Portuguese (who named it Rio Fresco, in which the name of the city originated from, meaning in English:\\"Freshwater River\\"), Dutch, French and English traders. A Euro-African Creole, or Métis, community of merchants grew up there, in close contact with similar communities in Saint Louis, Gorée and other places along the Petite Côte (Portudal, Joal) south to the Gambia River. Rufisque, on the Cap-Vert Peninsula, Senegal In 1840 a couple of Saint Louis merchants built warehouses on the waterfront to stock peanuts. Gorée merchants followed suit. There followed a period of commercial expansion as peanut production in Cayor boomed. In 1859 a fort was built by the French and Rufisque was annexed to the Colony of Senegal. The \\"Escale\\" commercial and administrative neighborhood along the waterfront was laid out in 1862—the African inhabitants being pushed out in the process. Rufisque became a \\"commune\\" in 1880 and its port was connected to the Dakar-Saint Louis railroad in 1885. In 1909 Galandou Diouf (died 1941) was elected to represent Rufisque in the General Council of the colony in Saint Louis, being the first African elected to that position.  Decline of port  Early in the 20th century the growth of neighboring Dakar, with its superior port facilities, signaled the decline of Rufisque. No longer an active port, Rufisque has experienced steep decline of industrial activities and is certainly the most neglected of Senegal's four historic \\"communes\\", with no tourism sector and a chronic lack of investment in public infrastructure.

Dromomania has also been referred to as travelling fugue. Non-clinically, the term has come to be used to describe a desire for frequent traveling or wanderlust.  Etymology  The term dromomania is derived from combining the Greek dromos, meaning \\"running\\" with the root mania. The term has sometimes been clinical and pathologizing, and other times been descriptive of unusual enthusiasm without negative or medicalizing connotations, reflecting the diverse uses of the term mania itself. In the 17th century, the term mania came to be used to describe any show of great enthusiasm for a specific activity or object. Later, it came to be used as a suffix for Greek words to refer to an irrational obsession, such as in the words guanaikomania, hippomania, and nymphomania. At the same time emerged the French , such as in , which was borrowed into English as bibliomania. The original sense of enthusiasm without the sense of irrationality continued, as can be seen in Coleridge's late (1772–1843) use of the term scribbleomania.  Clinical usage  19th and early 20th centuries = Dromomania was a historical psychiatric diagnosis whose primary symptom was an irresistible urge to aimlessly wander, travel, or walk.Medical dictionary, dromomania Dromomania has also been referred to as travelling fugue. Some authors describe patients with this diagnosis as being \\"in an automatic state\\" as they traveled, experiencing partial amnesia of the events of their journeys. Other symptoms included a \\"loss of sense of personal identity, ... and impulses to homicide and suicide.\\" Dromomania was regarded as a kind of impulse control disorder similar to kleptomania or pyromania. Dromomania was primarily described by French psychiatrists. The concept of dromomania was adapted in America into drapetomania, a mental disorder whose primary symptom was running away. This diagnosis was applied only to slaves. Modern bioethicist Henk A. M. J. ten Have regards dromomania as equivalent to the DSM IV diagnosis of dissociative fugue and the historical diagnoses of (German) and (French). =Example cases= Many cases of dromomania have been described. The most famous case was that of Jean-Albert Dadas, a gas-fitter from Bordeaux, France. Dadas would suddenly set out on foot and reach cities as far away as Prague, Vienna or Moscow with no memory of his travels. A medical student, Philippe Tissié, wrote about Dadas in his doctoral dissertation in 1887.Les aliénés voyageurs : essai médico-psychologique, Paris, O. Doin, 1887; réédité à L'Harmattan, 2005, introduction de Serge Nicolas, sous le titre Les aliénés voyageurs : Le cas Albert, Available at http://www2.biusante.parisdescartes.fr/livanc/?cote=TBOR1887x29&do;=chapitre Jean-Martin Charcot presented a similar case he called automatisme ambulatoire, French for \\"ambulatory automatism\\", or \\"walking around without being in control of one's own actions.\\"https://www.universalis.fr/encyclopedie/automate/8-l-automatisme- ambulatoire/ = Social context = Dromomania is one of a constellation of social constructs to describe contemporary nomadic lifestyles, along with bum, brodyaga, hobo, vagrant, divagate, itinerant, vagabond, transient, tramp, rogue, wanderer Within this constellation, dromomania is an extreme pathologizing term. In the early 20th century, dromomania was classified as one of a number of criminal manias, which were understood to involve irresistible compulsions to act without any motivation and sometimes against the preferences of the actor. Other such criminal manias were kleptomania, pyromania, and dipsomania. The American Prison Association described all of these criminal manias as common among people with psychopathic personalities, who were also described as lacking in purpose and ambition. Dromomania was sometimes equated with propensity to vagrancy. The construct has been involved in the regulation of homelessness. It associated with the belief that homeless travelers lose the capacity to live in homes and maintain stability. Travel writer Richard Grant has suggested that dromomania as a disorder is defined by sedentary cultures which pathologize a desire for travel that is present as an instinct in humans from their history as nomadic hunter-gathers. Frequent travelers such as Francis Xavier have been suspected of having dromomania. = 21st century = During the 20th century, this diagnosis fell into disuse. However, since 2000 articles have appeared describing dromomania as a potential consequence of Alzheimer's disease, dementia, and delirium. There have been attempts to treat dromomania with antipsychotic medications.  Nonclinical usage  More generally, the term is sometimes used to describe people who have a strong emotional or even physical need to be constantly traveling and experiencing new places, often at the expense of their normal family, work, and social lives. Some authors have negatively referred to the high prevalence and cultural value of frequent long-distance travel in contemporary Western culture as hypermobility or dromomania. In a 1977 book, cultural theorist Paul Virilio criticized modernity for acculturating people to become insanely addicted to pursuing the future and unable to stop, which he characterized as \\"dromomania\\". Virilio's analysis of contemporary culture has continued to be endorsed by other cultural theorists and regarded as even more accurate after the growth of finance capitalism and globalization.

History  SMASH first appeared in Tom Strong #11 (January 2001). In 1968, Tom discovers an alternate version of his Earth located on the far side of the galaxy, which he dubs \\"Terra Obscura.\\" Terra Obscura has the same cities as Earth, but different names for them. Most notably, the big East Coast city is New Lancaster. It also shares a similar history as Earth. On his visit to Terra Obscura, Tom meets his counterpart Tom \\"Doc\\" Strange, and the team of science- heroes known as the Society of Major American Science Heroes (SMASH). All the members of SMASH are based on characters previously published by Nedor Comics in the 1940s. With the original publisher's collapse, copyrights on the characters were not renewed upon 28 years of creation and so lapsed into the public domain. One of the Nedor's many titles was America's Best Comics, and when the coincidence of this was pointed out to Alan Moore, he decided to incorporate these characters into his Tom Strong series. For their 2000 debut, Moore created a backstory for them, covering the time periods during which they were not actually being published. The history of the characters (both from Nedor and ABC) follow the conventions established by DC Comics and Marvel Comics: the Golden Age of Comic Books, Silver Age of Comic Books, and Modern Age of Comic Books. =Golden Age (Nedor Comics era)= The Golden Age heroes were published in various Nedor Comics titles, including America's Best Comics, the inspiration for reviving the characters. In the updated chronology, Tom Strong reveals that the Golden Age adventures of the Terra Obscura characters are portrayed in comic books on his world, in an echo of the old DC Multiverse Earth-1/Earth-2 relationship. =Silver Age (Moore's Backstory)= In reality, the Nedor characters were not in print during the Silver Age, but flashback sequences in Terra Obscura reference the era. This includes sequences establishing Tom Strange and the Black Terror as the parallel of the Superman-Batman World's Finest team. This is the time period when Tom Strong made his first journey to Terra Obscura. After Tom returned to his own solar system, Terra Obscura came under attack when the moon landings of 1969 awakened a deadly alien. The lunar invader's power was so great that several members of SMASH were killed (the first time Terra Obscura science- heroes had ever died in battle): The Black Terror, Tom Strange's side-kick Mike Ellis and The Ghost. The rest of SMASH were encased in stasis fields orbiting the moon. Tom Strange was able to escape and ran through space for 30 years in order to reach his recent acquaintance and get help. =Modern Age (Terra Obscura)= The \\"Modern Age\\" stories begin when the two Toms return and free the remaining members of SMASH. After they had been freed, the remaining members of SMASH pooled their efforts for a final attack on the lunar alien, which had been building a giant construct in the Antarctic over the previous 30 years. Meanwhile, Tim Roland, the Black Terror's side-kick, initialized a system which Benton had been working on prior to his death: \\"Terror 2000\\", a computer generated version of Benton, able to combat crime using his complete integration into the world's computer networks. Also making a return from the grave was the Ghost. Using his supreme yogic powers he was able to stay in a state of limbo, between this world and the next, and appears when he can as \\"The Green Ghost\\". Together they fought and defeated the alien menace, which had been trying to turn the entire planet into a spaceship, with Terror 2000 delivering the final blow. But this final fight was not without its losses; Bruce Carter, the Fighting Yank, was killed in the melee. With the alien menace destroyed, the members of SMASH find it difficult adjusting to life in the 21st century, and decide to disband. But three years later, a new menace arises that draws the former teammates together. A mysterious \\"technology plague\\" sweeps through the nation, rendering technology useless and threatens to return Terra Incognita to the Stone Age. The source is traced to the Grand Canyon, where former SMASH member Mystico is using his mystical powers to fight the megalomaniacal Terror 2003, the computer intelligence based on the mind of the dead Black Terror. Mystico's plague also nullifies the science- based powers of the superheroes; only the Liberator and the Scarab, with their magic-based powers, are unaffected. Mystico is at first able to overpower the Liberator and Tom Strange, and reveals that he is possessed by the spirit of the Egyptian god Set. Meanwhile, Fighting Yank II (who has regained her mystical powers) and Ms. Masque are able to find the source of Mystico's powers and de-activate it. The Scarab asks the goddess Maat for help, and is bonded to the god Thoth in order to act as a guardian over Mystico/Set. The Grand Canyon is given over to Mystico/Set as the domain of \\"New Egypt\\", while the Terror 2003 program is confined to Invertica City. Tom Strange convinces his friends to join him in reforming SMASH. Several years later, SMASH is faced with a new challenge when former SMASH member Captain Future returns. His ship, the Thunderbolt, had been thrown through time after a battle with Dr. X in 1959, and is now causing the timelines to overlap. The Terror 2003, now upgraded to the Terror 2004, tries to use these timeslips as a way of taking over Terra Incognita. In the end, a time-traveling Black Terror from the past arrives and destroys the Terror 2004. Publishing history After the Nedor Comics characters appeared in Tom Strong, Moore and Peter Hogan co- plotted a spin-off series that Hogan penned himself.

He played professional football as a quarterback in the National Football League (NFL) for the Brooklyn Dodgers (1937–1941) and Boston Yanks (1945) and in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) for the New York Yankees. He was an All-American halfback at Duke University in 1936. Parker also played Major League Baseball during 1936 and 1937 with the Philadelphia Athletics. He served as the head baseball coach at Duke from 1953 to 1966. Parker was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1955 and the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1972. Early years Parker was the son of Ernest and Mabel Parker and grew up near Norfolk, Virginia. He attended Woodrow Wilson High School in Portsmouth, graduating with the class of 1933 and starring in five sports. He enrolled at Duke University as a freshman in 1933. Duke career At Duke, Parker competed in three sports: football, basketball and baseball. From 1934–1936, he starred at running back, doing most of the running and passing for Duke. He was second team All- American in 1935 and consensus All-American first team in 1936. He placed sixth in the Heisman Trophy voting in 1936. Parker was a great open-field runner and one of the best punters in college football at the time. His 105-yard kickoff return against North Carolina is still a Duke school record. Parker also stood out as a baseball player at Duke, playing in 1935–1936. In his senior season at Duke, he served as team captain for the Duke Blue Devils who went 9–1, captured the league title with a 7–0 record, and finished the season ranked 11th in the Associated Press national poll. He was elected into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1955. He was inducted into the North Carolina Sports Hall of Fame in 1963, the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame in 1972, and was an inaugural member of the Duke University Sports Hall of Fame, inducted in 1975. Early pro career Parker was drafted by the Brooklyn Dodgers as the third pick of the second round in the 1937 NFL draft. Sammy Baugh was the only passer drafted ahead of Parker. Parker, who played for the Philadelphia Athletics of Major League Baseball beginning in 1937, originally had no intention of playing in the NFL. Baseball was the glamour pro sport at the time and the NFL had a rough, vulgar reputation. But perhaps because of his .117 batting average that year, he asked for and received permission from the A's to play football. Parker thus became a true two-sport phenomenon, playing both Major League Baseball and NFL football in both 1937 and 1938. Parker, playing various infield positions, batted .179 over two seasons with the A's, scoring 20 runs with 25 RBI over 94 games. Parker was the first of only seven Major League Baseball players to hit a home run as a pinch-hitter in their first at bat. NFL stardom When Parker joined the Dodgers in 1937, Brooklyn had been a perennial NFL cellar-dweller in the East Conference since 1930. With his running, passing, and punting ability, he brought them instant credibility. He led the team in passing in 1937 and every year he played. In 1938, he led Brooklyn to a .500 record and led the NFL in passing yards with 865. When legendary coach Jock Sutherland joined the Dodgers in 1940, Parker's career took off. In 1940, he threw for 817 yards and 10 touchdowns, rushed for 306 yards, caught 3 passes, including 2 for touchdowns, and led the league in points after touchdowns. The Dodgers finished only one game out of first, with an 8–3 record, and Parker was named the NFL MVP. In 1941, Parker continued to shine, but the Dodgers again finished second to the New York Giants, despite beating their New York rivals twice during the season. Parker's NFL career went on hold in 1942, as he, like many NFL players, left football to enlist in the Armed Services. After serving for over two years, Parker returned to the NFL, this time with the short-lived Boston Yanks, but at age 33, he took on a minor role. He rejoined the former owner of the Dodgers, Dan Topping, in 1946 as part of the New York Yankees of the new All-America Football Conference (AAFC). Coached by former Washington Redskins coach Ray Flaherty and led by Parker, the Yankees won the AAFC East, giving Parker his only division title in pro football. The Yankees met the powerful Cleveland Browns in the championship game. The Yankees played well, but eventually succumbed to the Browns. Parker was 8 of 18 passing, for only 81 yards and an interception. Parker retired after the game, completing a fine career at age 34. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame and the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame in 1972. Later years After his playing days, Parker became the head baseball coach (1953–1966) and assistant football coach (1947–1965) at Duke University. He was manager of the Durham Bulls from 1949 to 1952, serving as player-manager for the first three seasons and finishing with a record of 303–266 (.533). He was Piedmont League manager of the year in 1949 and 1951. He was also a founding member of the Elizabeth Manor Golf and Country Club in Portsmouth, Virginia. On August 13, 2008, Parker was part of the inaugural class inducted into the Hampton Roads Sports Hall of Fame, honoring athletes, coaches and administrators who made contributions to sports in Southeastern Virginia. At the time of his death, Parker was the oldest living member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame, the oldest living former professional football player and the last living person to play on the same major league baseball field as Baseball Hall of Fame member Rogers Hornsby. On May 7, 1937, Parker appeared for the Philadelphia Athletics while Hornsby played one of his last games for the St. Louis Browns. Before his death, Parker and Hall of Famer Bobby Doerr were the last men to play on the same field as baseball immortal Lou Gehrig. Parker died the morning of November 6, 2013 at the age of 101. He is the first and so far only member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame to have lived past their hundredth birthday.

It was one of Norman Foster's earliest commissions after founding Foster Associates. The Willis building (originally the Willis Faber & Dumas regional headquarters) in Ipswich, England, is one of the earliest buildings designed by Norman Foster and Wendy Cheesman after establishing Foster Associates. Constructed between 1970 and 1975 for the insurance firm now known as Willis Towers Watson, it is now seen as a landmark in the development of the 'high tech' architectural style. The building houses some 1,300 office staff in open plan offices spread over three floors. Location The bulbous floorplan of the office block reflects the layout of the available site in the centre of Ipswich, which is sandwiched between several road junctions and the Grade I listed Unitarian Meeting House, one of Ipswich's oldest surviving buildings. Thus two of the town's Grade I listed buildings stand side by side. Design Window support detail. The centre of the building is constructed from a grid of concrete pillars, 14 m (46 ft) apart, supporting cantilevered concrete slab floors. The exterior is clad in 890 dark smoked glass curtain wall. The use of dark glass, a curtain wall and lack of right angle corners mirrors the art deco Express Building in Manchester - one of Norman Foster's favourite buildings. The central escalator well leads up to a rooftop staff restaurant surrounded by a rooftop garden (360 panorama). Originally there was also a swimming pool for employees to enjoy during their lunch break. This has now been covered up (not filled in due to it being a listed building) and the space is used for more offices. The swimming pool can be seen underneath the false floor.

It originally aired on Fox in the United States on December 26, 1999. The episode features the Griffin family after a nuclear holocaust occurs, due to Y2K on New Year's Eve. The family then travels in search of food, and eventually decide to establish a town around a Twinkie factory. Peter then takes over the town, establishing himself as mayor, but eventually becomes power hungry, and is overthrown. The episode was written by Neil Goldman and Garrett Donovan and directed by Bob Jaques. The episode featured guest performances by Patrick Duffy, Victoria Principal, Jack Perkins, Will Sasso, and Joey Slotnick along with several recurring voice actors for the series. This is the first episode that aired to feature Mila Kunis as the voice of Meg Griffin. Plot On December 31, 1999, Quahog prepares for New Year's Day and the new millennium, and the Griffins have been invited to Joe's millennium party. At a store, a man wearing a chicken suit asks Peter if he wants a coupon, but Peter refuses, recalling the time he got a bad coupon from Ernie the Giant Chicken and started a massive fistfight. The man then warns Peter that the world will end because of the Y2K problem, so Peter locks himself and the family in their basement in hazmat suits, despite Lois' objections. Just after midnight, the Y2K bug hits. This causes a worldwide nuclear attack, with vehicles crashing and missiles self- launching, destroying much of the world, and mutating, injuring, and killing many people. The Griffins remain safe, though their house has been severely damaged. The next week, Meg whines about Kevin getting vaporized, and the Griffins discover that Quagmire and Cleveland have been stitched together and are now called \\"Clevemire\\" (or \\"Quagland\\"), and Tom Tucker and Diane Simmons have cooked and eaten Tricia Takanawa. Starving, Peter immediately eats all the dehydrated meals, without adding water. Peter recalls that the snack food Twinkies are the only food that can survive a nuclear holocaust, so the family prepares to travel to Natick, Massachusetts, in hopes that the Twinkie factory has survived. While loading the car, Chris attempts to bring a tree (named \\"Woody\\") but Peter refuses and says no, Lois attempts to reason with him but he walks behind the house and shoots the plant. After Meg puts mousetraps for a mutated rat down to protect Joe (Who is somehow melted to his driveway), the family get underway in their heavily damaged car. Soon they are stopped by survivors, who were looking for food, but the Griffins do not have any food so they have to distract them. They continue their journey only to find that the car has run out of gas. The Griffins now have to walk to Natick just as they found a new home, where Randy Newman just sings about everyone he sees. Lois initially insists they stay there, but they leave because Newman starts annoying her with his literal song while trying to eat an apple. So they once again continue their journey after Lois knocks out Newman with her apple. They make it to Natick, but there is no factory. Stewie berates Peter for costing them their lives before tripping and getting covered in nuclear waste. Upon sunrise the factory is revealed to still be standing and in perfect condition. Expecting to be able to live off the snack food while Stewie mutates his arms into tentacles, they establish the town of New Quahog around the factory. Peter proclaims himself mayor, and Joe and Clevemire join him to form a ruling council. In time, New Quahog has become a fresh new community, complete with houses and wells. Peter has successfully reigned as mayor despite many mistakes, such as giving people jobs just picked out of a hat rather than based on the person's skills. However, when Brian points out how New Quahog is a peaceful place with no violence, Peter says that they are completely defenseless and finds metal to make guns. Meanwhile, Stewie's body has completely transformed into an octopus, and when Lois tries put on Stewie's pajamas with a trap door on the back, he sprays ink but misses. Then he tries to get on the ceiling and soon falls off, and Lois catches him then says that he is getting heavy. Stewie suddenly lays hundreds of eggs. Peter shows up and makes guns and other weapons using the pipes from the city's irrigation system, outraging the citizens. Despite Peter's insistence that he is fit to continue to be the leader of the new community, the townspeople throw him out of New Quahog, and his family follows him. The citizens proceed to burn the guns Peter had made with the pipes in the middle of the town square, but as the final gun is thrown onto the pile, hundreds of newly spawned Octopus- Stewies eggs hatch and they begin to destroy the city, with the townspeople unable to protect themselves from the mutants. As the family walks away, oblivious to the town's destruction, they decide to continue to a Carvel factory in Framingham. The episode ends with a live-action parody of Dallas, in which Pam Ewing (Victoria Principal), clad in a blue silk nightgown wakes up and tells her husband Bobby (Patrick Duffy) about a dream she had of a strange episode of Family Guy. Bobby comforts her, but pauses and then asks what it is and the two turn and look with confusion into the camera. Production This is the first episode to include the voice of Mila Kunis as Meg. \\"Da Boom\\" was the third episode of the second season of Family Guy, and the first for director Bob Jaques. It first aired on December 26, 1999. The episode was written by writing team Neil Goldman and Garrett Donovan, who had written episodes for the show in the first season including \\"Mind Over Murder\\". This was the first episode to have Mila Kunis providing the voice of Meg. Lacey Chabert, the original voice of Meg, left the series due to time constraints with her acting role in Party of Five, as well as schoolwork. Kunis won the role after auditions and a slight rewrite of the character, in part due to her performance on That '70s Show. Seth MacFarlane, the show's creator, called Kunis back after her first audition, instructing her to speak more slowly, and then told her to come back another time and enunciate more. Once she claimed that she had it under control, MacFarlane hired her. Ernie the Giant Chicken was introduced in this episode. He is an anthropomorphic chicken who serves as a rival to Peter. He has a long, unexpected fight with Peter, which interrupts the main storyline. This has become a running gag, having reappeared in episodes such as \\"Blind Ambition\\", \\"Internal Affairs\\", \\"No Chris Left Behind\\" and \\"Meet the Quagmires\\". He is voiced by regular show writer Danny Smith. In addition to the regular cast, actress Victoria Principal, comedian and actor Will Sasso, reporter, commentator, war correspondent, anchorman Jack Perkins, voice actor Joey Slotnick, and character actor Patrick Duffy guest starred in the episode. Recurring guest voice actress Lori Alan, writer Danny Smith, and actor Patrick Warburton also made minor appearances. Cultural references The live-action sequence in the episode is a reference to the episode of the CBS soap opera Dallas that erased the death of Bobby Ewing (Patrick Duffy), which turns out to be a dream of Pamela Ewing (Victoria Principal). Randy Newman appears singing everything he sees in a musical moment. The plot includes references to the Y2K bug. Peter takes away Trix from the Rabbit, which is a reference to commercials for Trix cereal. Chris tells E.T. to run when he thinks Peter is the government coming for him. When travelling to find food they are stopped and there's a reference to Family Feud. Stewie's line, \\"Game over man! Game over!\\" is a nod to the science fiction film Aliens. Arriving at the Twinkie factory, Peter uses the same words to describe what he sees that Dr. Ellie Arroway used in Contact when witnessing a celestial event in a foreign galaxy. Reception The episode received positive reviews. Ahsan Haque of IGN rated the episode a 10/10, saying \\"Overall, this episode easily ranks as one of the best episodes in the series. Almost every joke succeeds, and the far-fetched alternate reality storyline thoroughly entertains. Despite the fact that all of the events in the episode are revealed to be a dream, it doesn't take away from the high degree of amusement provided.\\" Tom Eames of entertainment website Digital Spy placed the episode at number sixteen on his listing of the best Family Guy episodes in order of \\"yukyukyuks\\" and described it as \\"classic bonkers Family Guy\\".

Professional careerCleveland Browns= Hanson was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Cleveland Browns following the 1999 NFL Draft. He was waived by the team following training camp. =Green Bay Packers= The Green Bay Packers signed Hanson on September 1, 1999. After punting for the Packers in their regular season opener, Hanson was released by the team and re-signed to the team's practice squad. He was waived from the Packers' practice squad on October 12, 1999. =Miami Dolphins= On December 29, 1999, Hanson was signed to the Miami Dolphins' practice squad, but released from it the next day. He was later re-signed to a future contract for the 2000 season. He was allocated to the Barcelona Dragons of NFL Europe for the spring. After suffering an injury in the Dragons' season finale, Hanson was placed on injured reserve by the Dolphins on August 22, 2000. He was released by the Dolphins on August 14, 2001. Hanson on the sidelines during a 2008 game. =Jacksonville Jaguars= Four days after being waived by the Dolphins, Hanson was signed by the Jacksonville Jaguars on August 18, 2001. He played in every game for the Jaguars in 2001, finishing sixth in the NFL in punt yard average. After being re-signed in the offseason, Hanson posted an NFL-best 44.2 gross punt average in 2002, earning his first Pro Bowl election. Hanson nearly matched his average during the first nine games of the 2003 season, posting a 43.5 yard average in that period. However, during the 2003 season Jaguars coach Jack Del Rio placed a wooden stump and axe in the Jaguars locker room as a symbol of his theme advising players to \\"keep choppin' wood\\". After his teammates had been taking swings at the wood with the axe, Hanson followed and ended up seriously wounding his non-kicking foot. He was placed on injured reserve on October 10, keeping him out the rest of the 2003 season. Hanson returned for the 2004 season, posting a 42.8 gross punting average over 16 games. Hanson was named AFC Special Teams Player of the Month in September 2005, with four punts downed inside the 20-yard line during that period. He helped the Jaguars to a 12-4 record, and a trip to the 2005 Wild-Card playoffs. However, Hanson's gross average dropped in 2006 to 40.6, and the Jaguars decided to draft a punter, Adam Podlesh, in the fourth round of the 2007 NFL Draft. Hanson was released by the Jaguars shortly after the draft, on May 1, 2007. =New Orleans Saints= Hanson was signed by the New Orleans Saints on May 7, 2007, but released by the team during cutdowns on August 28, 2007. =New England Patriots= In their 2007 training camp, the Patriots' punting competition appeared to be between veteran Josh Miller and first-year player Danny Baugher. By late August, the team had released Miller, leaving only Baugher on the roster. Baugher too was released days later, with the Patriots signing Hanson to replace him. Hanson had a 41.4 punting average for the Patriots in 2007. He helped lead the 2007 Patriots to a 16-0 regular season record, an AFC Championship, and a trip to Super Bowl XLII. In 2008, Hanson finished with a 43.7 punt average and was named AFC Special Teams Player of the Week in Week 17, averaging 45 yards a punt in wind gusts up to 60 mph. Hanson finished the 2009 season with a 39.7 punt average, helping the Patriots win the 2009 AFC East Division title. New England did not resign Hanson for the 2010 season, leaving him as a free agent. =Coaching = Hanson was named head football coach at Trinity Christian School (Sharpsburg, Georgia) in 2011 after spending one year as an assistant under his former high school coach, Danny Cronic.

Both appear on the oldest Roman calendars inscribed on stone.Wagenvoort, \\"The Origin of the Ludi Saeculares,\\" p. 225. The Equirria are part of what Michael Lipka calls \\"temporal focalization\\" in the Roman conception of deity. The festivals of Mars—the February 27 Equirria, a feria on the Kalends of March (a day sacred also to his mother Juno), Agonalia March 17, Tubilustrium March 23, the ritual of the October Horse October 15, and Armilustrium October 19—cluster at his namesake month (Latin Martius), except for festivals of Mars in October to close the military campaigning season.Michael Lipka, Roman Gods: A Conceptual Approach (Brill, 2009), p. 37. The views of Georg Wissowa on the festivals of Mars framing the military campaigning season are summarized by C. Bennett Pascal, \\"October Horse,\\" Harvard Studies in Classical Philology 85 (1981), p. 264, with bibliography. In the earliest form of the calendar, the year began with March, and thus the February 27 Equirria originally preceded New Year's Day, and was the last festival for Mars of the year. The March 14 Equirria occurs the day before the Ides, when the Roman people celebrated the feast of Anna Perenna, whose name expresses her role as a goddess of the year (Latin annus; cf. English \\"perennial\\"). The March 14 Equirria and the Regifugium (\\"King's Flight\\") are the only such festivals to fall on an even-numbered date. Despite scholarly efforts, no explanation for this displacement has found wide acceptance. Georg Wissowa thought the March Equirria had originally occurred on the Ides, and was moved up a day because of conflicts among religious events concentrated around this ritually fraught time; an alternate view is that it was placed \\"at some convenient day\\" between the Nones and the Ides. At any rate, the horse races framed the ritual turn of the year, and the difficulties of the placement of the two Equirria arise from changes made to the calendar, when January became the first month.Wagenvoort, \\"The Origin of the Ludi Saeculares,\\" pp. 224–227; Frank Bernstein, \\"Complex Rituals: Games and Processions in Republican Rome\\", in A Companion to Roman Religion (Blackwell, 2007), p. 223; C.

Fowler, The Religious Experience of the Roman People (London, 1922), p. 99, notes that about the peculiar even-date placement of the Regifugium and March Equirria \\"we know so little that it is almost useless to speculate as to the reason for their exception from the rule.\\" See also Bernstein, \\"Die römischen Ecurria / Equirria — kriegerische Feste?\\" Nikephoros 12 (1999) 149–169. See discussion throughout Rüpke, The Roman Calendar. Significance Originally, the Equirria may have featured races on horseback, like the archaic festivals of the ConsualiaTertullian, De spectaculis 5, says that Romulus had replaced the Consualia with the Equirria. and Taurian Games, rather than chariot races.Wagenvoort, \\"The Origin of the Ludi Saeculares,\\" p. 228. The gods of the underworld (di inferi) were characteristically propitiated by horse racing in the Campus Martius with \\"old and obscure\\" festivals such as the Consualia, at sites including the Tarentum and the Trigarium.Humphrey, Roman Circuses, pp. 544, 558; Auguste Bouché-Leclercq, Manuel des Institutions Romaines (Hachette, 1886), p. 549; \\"Purificazione,\\" in Thesaurus Cultus et Rituum Antiquorum (LIMC, 2004), p. 83. See also the Lusus Troiae. Hendrik Wagenvoort speculated that the archaic Mars \\"had been imagined as the god of death and the underworld in the shape of a horse.\\"Wagenvoort, \\"The Origin of the Ludi Saeculares,\\" p. 228. William Warde Fowler understood the Equirria as \\"lustrations of the horse\\" for the army.Fowler, Religious Experience, pp. 98, 217. They occur during what most scholars see as a general \\"war festival\\" for Mars.Hendrik Wagenvoort, \\"On the Magical Significance of the Tail,\\" in Pietas: Selected Studies in Roman Religion (Brill, 1980), p. 148; John Scheid, An Introduction to Roman Religion (Indiana University Press, 2003), p. 51. The end of the campaigning season was marked in October, with the ritual of the October Horse, which also involved chariot races, on the Ides, and the Armilustrium on October 19.Fowler, Roman Festivals, p. 249 et passim. The paucity of evidence on the Equirria, as with other archaic festivals, may indicate that they were preserved for the sake of religious tradition, but not attended by masses of people.Jörg Rüpke, \\"Communicating with the Gods,\\" in A Companion to the Roman Republic (Wiley-Blackwell, 2010), p. 224.

The word samul means \\"four objects\\", while nori means \\"play\\". Samul nori is performed with four traditional Korean musical instruments called pungmul. These are Kkwaenggwari (꽹과리), a small gong; Jing (징), a larger gong; Janggu (장구), an hourglass-shaped drum; and Buk (북), a barrel drum similar to the bass drum. Samul nori's roots are in Pungmul nori (풍물놀이), meaning \\"playing Korean traditional percussion instruments\\", which is a Korean folk genre comprising music, acrobatics, folk dance, and rituals. Samul nori was traditionally performed in rice-farming villages in order to ensure and to celebrate good harvests. Until modern times, nine-tenths of Korea's people were employed in agricultural work, and this genre defined Korean music. Pungmul nori is also called \\"Nong-ak nori\\" (농악놀이): \\"nong\\" meaning farm and \\"ak\\" meaning music. This name was instituted by the Japanese imperial government's cultural colonization policies regarding Korean culture. Samul nori is the formalized, more modern version of Pungmul nori. Samul nori started by adapting music from Utdari pungmul (the gut, or shaman ceremony rhythm of the Gyeonggi-do and Chungcheong provinces of South Korea), as well as the genres of Yeongnam folk music and Honam udo gut, combined with more contemporary improvisations, elaborations, and compositions. The original music of these local rhymes is steeped in traditional animism and shamanism but also shows influences from Korean military music and Korean Buddhism. While full Pungmul nori often features the use of wind instruments, Samul nori only features the four aforementioned percussion instruments. After seeing a Samul nori performance, a poet once described each of the four instruments as a different element of weather: the janggu represents rain; the kkwaenggwari, thunder; the jing, the sounds of the wind; and the buk, clouds. The Korean philosophy of Chun-Ji-In (\\"Chun\\" meaning heaven, \\"Ji\\" meaning Earth, and \\"In\\" meaning people) is also reflected in these instruments: the buk and janggu (leather) represent the sounds of the earth, while the jing and kkwaenggwari (metal) represent sounds of the heavens and the people playing. For this reason, Samul nori without the sound of people is considered incomplete. Although it is generally performed indoors as a staged genre, Samul nori depicts the traditional Korean culture, an agricultural society rooted in the natural environment. Samul nori is characterized by strong, accented rhythms, vibrant body movements, and an energetic spirit. Samul nori has gained international popularity, with many Samul nori bands and camps performing worldwide. Since the 1980s in South Korea, there has been a marked increase in the amount of fusion music, which combines Samul nori and Western instruments. Samul nori was also extensively used in the Korean musical Nanta. The most famous Samul nori ensemble is the internationally famous South Korean ensemble styled SamulNori, which is credited for bringing the music from a rural folk genre to the contemporary stage.Kbsㅎ The group was established in February 1978 by janggu player and former Namsadang star performer Kim Duk Soo (),http://www.nanjangcultures.com/english/biography.asp along with Kim Young Bae (kkwaenggwari), Choi Tae Hyun (jing), and Lee Jong Dae (buk). Following Kim Young Bae's death in 1985, he was replaced by Choi Jong Sil, and Lee Kwang Soo replaced Lee Jong Dae on the buk. The group has collaborated and recorded with a number of non-Korean ensembles, most notably in 1987 with the Red Sun jazz band, with one Samul Nori/Red Sun CD selling 70,000 copies. They have also performed in August 2000 at the Earth Celebration International Arts Festival on Sado Island in Japan with the Japanese taiko group Kodo.http://www.outdoorjapan.com/features/ojfeature-ec2000.html [] Regarding his choice to move from the more traditional outdoor performances to indoor venues, Kim Duk Soo states that at the time he established SamulNori, during the last years of the administration of former South Korean president Park Chung Hee, Korean traditional music was associated with the student movement, and anyone playing such instruments outdoors could be arrested. Thus, he developed the current version of the genre, which is generally presented indoors on concert hall stages.https://web.archive.org/web/20080315234056/http://english.seoul.go.kr/today/infocus/interview/1236715_5099.php In 1993, SamulNori expanded to include twenty performers and changed its name to SamulNori Hanullim, Inc. (\\"Hanullim\\" meaning \\"big bang\\"). Instrumental Honamudonongak (호남우도농악,湖南右道農樂), Binari(비나리), Seoljanggo play(설장고놀이), Pangut(판굿), Gilgunakchilchea(길군악칠채), and so on.

It is so named because of its superficial similarity to the limpet, a type of sea snail that clings tightly to rocks or other hard surfaces. A swimmer or diver may attach the mine, which is usually designed with hollow compartments to give the mine just slight negative buoyancy, making it easier to handle underwater. Usually limpet mines are set off by a time fuse. They may also have an anti-handling device. Types Usually, limpet mines are set off by a time fuse. They may also have an anti-handling device, making the mine explode if removed from the hull by enemy divers or by explosions. Sometimes limpet mines have been fitted with a small turbine which would detonate the mine after the ship had sailed a certain distance, so that it was likely to sink in navigable channels or deep water out of reach of easy salvage. Thus, determining the cause of the sinking is more difficult. Development Cecil Vandepeer Clarke wearing an early version of the limpet mine on a keeper plate in the position used by a swimmer. In December 1938, a new unit was created in the British military that soon became known as Military Intelligence (Research), which is sometimes abbreviated as MI(R) or occasionally as MIR. MI(R) absorbed a technical section that was at first known as MI(R)c. In April 1939, Joe Holland, the head of MIR, recruited his old friend Major Millis Rowland Jefferis as director of the technical section.Unattributed. Sir Millis Jefferis – New Weapons Of War (Obituary). The Times, 7 September 1963 p. 10 column E. Under his leadership, the team developed a wide range of innovative weapons.National Archive. T 166 – Hearing 16 November 1953 – Macrae. Document 320 One of Jefferis' earliest ideas was a type of mine that could be towed behind a rowboat, which would attach itself to the hull of a ship that it passed. Getting a heavy bomb to stick to a ship reliably was a problem. The obvious answer was to use magnets, which should be as powerful as possible. In July 1939, Jefferis read an issue of the popular magazine Armchair Science, which contained a small article on magnets: On 17 July 1939, Jefferis contacted magazine editor Stuart Macrae for more information about the magnets. During World War I, Macrae had briefly worked on a device for dropping hand grenades from aircraft, and he longed for a return to working on such challenges. When Jefferis' call came, Macrae promptly undertook to perform experiments and to produce prototypes. He contacted Cecil Vandepeer Clarke, managing director of the Low Loading Trailer Company. Macrae had met Clarke a couple of years previously when he was the editor of The Caravan & Trailer magazine. He had been impressed by Clarke's work, and now he wanted his expertise and the use of his workshops in Bedford.National Archive. T 166 — Hearing 16 November 1953 — Macrae. Document 328. Macrae and Clarke soon agreed to cooperate on the design of a new weapon, but they quickly abandoned a towed mine as impractical. Instead, they worked on a bomb that could be carried by a diver and attached directly to a ship.National Archive. T 166-21 Awards to Inventors — Macrae and others. The new weapon became known as a limpet mine. The first versions were assembled in a few weeks. Because of the time required to source the General Electric magnets from the United States, Macrae bought some toy horseshoe magnets from an ironmonger's shop, which were found to be adequate. The body of the prototype was a large metal kitchen bowl obtained from the Bedford branch of Woolworths and modified by a local tinsmith to retain the magnets around the rim. After much experimentation, it was found that the detonator could be actuated by a slowly dissolving aniseed ball sweet to provide the necessary time to escape.Unattributed. \\"Limpet Bomb Claim By Inventors — Use Of Aniseed Balls.\\" The Times 17 November 1953 p. 4 column F. The sweets, which had initially been left in the workshop by Clarke's children, were the only substance tested which dissolved at a predictable rate. To protect this mechanism from damp which might cause premature detonation, it was covered by a condom which had to be removed before use. The prototype was tested in the swimming pool at Bedford Public Baths, using a steel plate lowered into the deep end to simulate a ship's hull. Just before war was declared, Macrae's name was put forward to Holland, who arranged to meet him. Holland considered that Macrae would make a good second in command for Jefferis: He saw Macrae as a capable administrator who could keep his geniuses in order. Macrae joined the War Office as a civilian and Holland saw to it that Macrae got a commission in October 1939 (backdated to 1 September). Clarke joined the top secret Cultivator No. 6 project as a civilian and later joined the army. He served in the Special Operations Executive (SOE) with Colin Gubbins and was later Commandant of one of the Secret Intelligence Service's schools.National Archive. HS 9/321/8 – SOE Personnel File: Cecil Vandepeer Clarke. He eventually rejoined Macrae when he was transferred to MD1 in 1942. The \\"rigid limpets\\" used by the British during World War II contained only of explosive,; but placed below the water line they caused a wide hole in an unarmoured ship. SOE agents could be provided with a placing rod.; A smaller version named \\"Clam\\" was developed from the British limpet for use on land. It was intended for use against tanks. But before the British ever got a chance to deploy it, the Germans adopted Zimmerit coating on their tanks, which prevented magnetic mines from sticking to the armor. This was because the Germans were the largest user of magnetic mines during the war, such as the Hafthohlladung, a shaped-charge anti-tank grenade which attached magnetically to a target. They feared that the Soviets would easily reverse-engineer this weapon and use it against them. In the end, the Soviets didn't care for the idea of the magnetic mine, and the Germans stopped using Zimmerit for the last year of the war. The British limpet adaptation was not the first magnetic mine and was not the reason that Zimmerit coating was developed. However, the Clam was found to be useful for sabotage and was enthusiastically adopted by the Special Operations Executive. Using only an charge, it could easily be concealed in a coat pocket and was capable of destroying a vehicle or aircraft. Some 2.5 million Clams were manufactured by M.D.1, the successor to MI(R), during the war. Usage 3 views of a frogman with a Soviet-designed IDA71 rebreather breathing set, supplied with keeper plate to clip a limpet mine to his chest. =Second World War= One of the most dramatic examples of their use was during Operation Jaywick, a special operation undertaken in World War II. In September 1943, 14 Allied commandos from the Z Special Unit raided Japanese shipping in Singapore Harbour. They paddled into the harbour and placed limpet mines on several Japanese ships before returning to their hiding spot. In the resulting explosions, the limpet mines sank or seriously damaged seven Japanese ships, comprising over 39,000 tons among them. An example of the use of limpet mines by British special forces was in Operation Frankton which had the objective of disabling and sinking merchant shipping moored at Bordeaux, France in 1942. The operation was the subject of the film The Cockleshell Heroes. Another case was Raid on Alexandria (1941) by Italian Navy divers, who attacked and disabled two British Royal Navy battleships in the harbour of Alexandria, Egypt, using manned torpedoes. Limpet mines were also used by the Norwegian Independent Company 1 in 1944 to attack the MS Monte Rosa. On 16 January 1945, 10 limpet mines were placed along the port side of the SS Donau approximately beneath the waterline. These bombs were to detonate once Donau cleared Oslofjord and reached open sea, however, the departure time was delayed and the explosion occurred before Donau reached Drøbak. =1970s and 1980s= In the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971, limpets were used by liberation fighters in Operation Jackpot, in Mongla seaport, Naval Commandos damaged many Pakistani army support ships and gunboats. Egyptian limpets were modified by the CIA for use by the Mujaheddin in the 1979–89 Soviet Afghan war, and could be attached to Soviet trucks.Crile, George. Charlie Wilson's War: The Extraordinary Story of the Largest Covert Operation in History Grove/Atlantic, 2003. chapter 22: \\"Mohammed's Arms Bazar\\" p.318 (paperback) In 1980, a limpet mine was used to sink Sierra, a whaling vessel which docked in Portugal after a confrontation with the Sea Shepherd. Later that year, about half the legal Spanish whaling fleet was sunk in a similar fashion. No lives were lost. Limpet mines were to be used in the plan of Operation Algeciras in the context of the 1982 Falklands War. Argentinian frogmen were to place limpet mines in British ships in Gibraltar but they were discovered and the plan was foiled. Another use was the sinking of the Rainbow Warrior by French DGSE agents in the Port of Auckland on 10 July 1985, killing one person. =2019 Gulf of Oman incidents= An example Iranian limpet mine, seen in 2015. On 12 May 2019, four oil tankers in the Emirati port of Fujairah suffered damage from what appeared to be limpet mines or a similar explosive device. Preliminary findings of the investigation by the UAE, Norway, and Saudi Arabia concluded in June 2019, show that limpet mines were placed on oil tankers to explode as a part of a sabotage operation. On 13 June two subsequent blasts in the Straits of Hormuz damaged a Japanese and a Norwegian tanker, and were blamed on Iran by the U.S. military. A video was released which, according to the United States, purports to show an Iranian vessel removing an unexploded limpet mine from the starboard side of the Japanese vessel, several meters forward of the damaged area.https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle- east-48633016 The implications of an Iranian attack are disputed by the owner of the Japanese vessel and the Japanese government. It must be noticed, the mines seemed to have been placed many feet above the waterline.https://japantoday.com/category/national/japan-demands- more-u.s.-proof-that-iran-attacked-tankers The vessel's crew reported an unknown object flying towards them, then an explosion and a breach in the vessel.

It stars Jennifer Jason Leigh and Jason Patric as two cops in the 1970s who go undercover on a case. They become drug addicts themselves and, failing to get the evidence they need, use falsified evidence.  Plot  In 1975 Katterly, Texas, seasoned undercover narcotics police officer Jim Raynor is told by his superior Lt. Dodd to choose a partner from a group of recent police academy graduates for his undercover investigation, which has been ongoing for two years. His choice of Kristen Cates surprises Dodd, but Raynor is confident she is the right fit for what he needs. Raynor explains to Cates that all they will have is each other in this assignment. They are caught between the legal world and the illegal underworld, belonging to neither and able to trust only one another. Though initially startled by Raynor's intensity, Cates insists she is capable of doing whatever it takes to get the job done. Later at Raynor's apartment, he teaches Cates how to properly shoot up heroin. Cates informs Raynor that she was instructed how to fake drug use at the police academy, which prompts a strong rebuke from Raynor. He informs her in no uncertain terms that she will be put in situations where she will have to take the drugs they will be buying. The drug dealers they will be doing business with are not stupid, and if she tries to fake drug use in front of them, she will get both of them killed. Raynor and now Cates's main objective in their operation is to take down the cunning, mysterious, and powerful Will Gaines. While Raynor (and the police department) is certain Gaines is the main drug boss in the town, Gaines is an expert at avoiding detection, and deeply mistrustful of Raynor. Unable to secure access to him, Cates and Raynor buy large quantities of drugs from minor dealers in the town. These drugs are cataloged and given to Dodd, along with information detailing from whom they bought the drugs. Raynor and Cates quickly go from pretending to be lovers to the real thing. As Raynor predicted, Cates is soon put into a position where she is forced to inject drugs in front of a drug dealer. Raynor tries to intervene and tell the dealer that \\"his lady doesn't fix\\", but the dealer insists at gunpoint. Cates first tries nervously to talk her way out of the situation, then yanks off her jacket and with shaking hands begins to prepare a heroin shot as Raynor had taught her. Seeing her high level of anxiety, Raynor takes the prepared needle from her and injects it into her arm. While the dealer watches approvingly and laughs, Cates quietly vomits off screen. Soon enough, Cates is addicted to the drugs she has to use to maintain her cover, and Raynor arrives home one day to find Cates combing the carpet, desperately searching for any crumbs of drugs that may have fallen. Raynor nurses Cates through her withdrawal while appearing largely unaffected by his own drug use. However, over the course of the film he becomes even more addicted than she. Eventually, both are able to get clean, but remain traumatized and scarred by their drug experiences. Though they have successfully infiltrated the town's drug underworld, Raynor and Cates are no closer to obtaining evidence against Gaines. Under pressure from the department, they falsify evidence against Gaines in order to secure his arrest and indictment. They move into a small trailer awaiting the beginning of the trial. Cates is startled awake one evening by a double barrel shotgun caressing her face. A gunfight ensues in which Raynor is shot in the thigh, striking his femoral artery. Cates frantically goes for help, then returns to the trailer to find Raynor barely conscious. He dies in her arms. At Grand Jury, Cates is on the witness stand. During her testimony, she mentions that she has resigned from the police force. Her testimony sticks to the fabricated story Raynor and she concocted, and appears to earn the support of the grand jurors and officers present. Gaines is later indicted. However, at trial, Cates takes the stand to testify. When she looks directly at Gaines, he slides two fingers down the bridge of his nose, mimicking the movement of the shotgun that eventually killed Raynor. Stunned, Cates retracts her statements about Gaines's involvement in the drug trade, and testifies that they were ordered to fabricate evidence by the Chief of Police. This of course secures Gaines's acquittal. Freed from police custody, Gaines gets into his car a few nights later. As he drives down the road, he notices someone hiding in the backseat. Gaines pulls over, and as he turns to confront them, he is killed by a double barrel shotgun blast to the face. The killer is never shown, but it is implied that it is Cates.

Catherine had 22 male lovers throughout her life, some of whom would reap political benefits from their relationship with her, and many of whom were younger than she. In addition to her sexual relationships, her multiple illicit relationships with Russian nobles, and unfounded rumors that she liked to collect erotic furniture, and an atmosphere of palace intrigue cultivated by her son Paul I of Russia, led to negative portrayals of Catherine. Some called her the \\"Messalina of the Neva\\", while others termed her a nymphomaniac.Longworth, Philip. The Three Empresses: Catherine I, Anne and Elizabeth of Russia. Constable Limited, 1972. The rumors even extended into the circumstances surrounding her death, with one tale claiming she died while having sexual relations with a horse, when she actually died from a stroke.  Personal life narratives  Rumors of Catherine's private life had a large basis in the fact that she took many young lovers, even in old age. (Lord Byron's Don Juan, around the age of twenty-two, becomes her lover after the siege of Ismail (1790), in a fiction written only about twenty-five years after Catherine's death in 1796.)http://petercochran.files.wordpress.com/2009/03/don_juan_canto_9.pdf Lord Byron's Canto IX edited by Peter Cochran with his comments. This practice was not unusual by the court standards of the day, nor was it unusual to use rumour and innuendo of sexual excess politically. One of her early lovers, Stanisław August Poniatowski, was later supported by her to become a king of Poland. One unfavorable rumor was that Alexander Dmitriev-Mamonov and her later lovers were chosen by Prince Potemkin himself, after the end of the long relationship Catherine had with Potemkin, where he, perhaps, was her morganatic husband. After Mamonov eloped from the 60-year-old Empress with a 16-year-old maid of honour and married her, the embittered Catherine reputedly revenged herself of her rival \\"by secretly sending policemen disguised as women to whip her in her husband's presence\\".John T. Alexander. Catherine the Great: Life and Legend. Oxford University Press, 1989. p. 222. However, another account claims that there is no truth in this story.Alexander 222. According to some contemporaries close to Catherine, Countess Praskovya Bruce was prized by her as \\"L'éprouveuse\\", or \\"tester of male capacity.\\"Arthur Asa Berger. The Art of the Seductress.\\" iUniverse, 2001. p. 70. Every potential lover was to spend a night with Bruce before he was admitted into Catherine's personal apartments. Their friendship was cut short when Bruce was found \\"in an assignment\\" with Catherine's youthful lover, Rimsky-Korsakov, ancestor of the composer; they both later withdrew from the imperial court to Moscow. Zubov Wing of the Catherine Palace in Tsarskoye Selo was constructed between 1781 and 1783 and adorned with thin plates of milky white polished glass; contemporary drawing in the National Museum in Warsaw. In his memoirs Charles François Philibert Masson (1762-1807) wrote that Catherine had \\"two passions, which never left her but with her last breath: the love of man, which degenerated into licentiousness, and the love of glory, which sunk into vanity. By the first of these passions, she was never so far governed as to become a Messalina, but she often disgraced both her rank and sex: by the second, she was led to undertake many laudable projects, which were seldom completed, and to engage in unjust wars, from which she derived at least that kind of fame which never fails to accompany success\\".Secret Memoirs of the Court of St Petersburg by C.F.P. Masson (1800, translated from the French in 1895, I 88-9)  Death narratives  Several stories about the circumstances of her death at age 67 in 1796 originated in the years following her death. An urban legend claims that she died as a result of her attempting sexual intercourse with a stallion—the story holds that the harness holding the horse above her broke, and she was crushed.Raucous Royals The origin of this false account of her death is unknown. However, it most likely began due to unfounded bawdy tales. The fact that this particular urban legend did not even emerge until several decades after her death, and that the legend has no clear source, should make it clear that this is no more than an urban legend that managed to gain popularity. Another story claiming that she died on the toilet when her seat broke under her is true only in small part; she did collapse in a bathroom from a stroke, but after that she died while being cared for in her bed. This tale was widely circulated and even jokingly referred to by Aleksandr Pushkin in one of his untitled poems. (\\"Наказ писала, флоты жгла, / И умерла, садясь на судно.\\"—literal translation: \\"Decreed the orders, burned the fleets / And died boarding a vessel,\\" the last line can also be translated as \\"And died sitting down on the toilet.\\") There existed also a version on alleged assassination, by spring blades hidden in a toilet seat.Jan Larecki. Katarzyna Łóżkowa in: Polityka nr. 40 (2623)/2007, p. 85, The erotic cabinet An urban legend states that an erotic cabinet was ordered by Catherine the Great, and was adjacent to her suite of rooms in Gatchina. According to said urban legend; the furniture was highly eccentric with tables that had large penises for legs. Penises and vulvae were carved out on the furniture, the walls were covered in erotic art, statues of a naked man and woman inside, and some versions of the legend state that some erotic artifacts from Pompeii were even brought into Russia to augment this collection. There are unconfirmed reports of photographs of this cabinet. The rooms and the furniture were allegedly seen in 1940 by two Wehrmacht officers during the Nazi Invasion of The Soviet Union, but even if that were true, the rooms and furniture seem to have vanished since then. The account says the Wehrmacht officers filed a report, but no report has ever been found, nor are any other records from anyone from before, during, or after the Second World War; other than the aforementioned legend. Also, the account says the rooms and furniture were seen in 1940, during the Nazi Invasion of The Soviet Union, but the invasion of The Soviet Union by Nazi Germany did not start in 1940, but on 22 June 1941. For this reason, historical experts challenge the veracity of such claims. But as all of these stories did not even originate until some years after Catherine the Great's death, it is most likely the cabinet never existed, and the whole story was simply fabricated as another bawdy tale.  Other narratives  * A long-surviving story about the Potemkin villages was false, even though it became eponymous. It states that Potemkin built fake settlements with hollow facades to fool Empress Catherine II during her visit to Crimea and New Russia, the territories Russia conquered under her reign. Modern historians, however, consider this scenario at best an exaggeration, and quite possibly simply a malicious rumor spread by Potemkin's opponents. * Not a native speaker of Russian, Catherine misspelled eщё ( 'more'), written with three letters, as истчо (), consisting of five letters, and that allegedly gave rise to a popular Russian joke: how can five mistakes occur in a word of three letters? (The letter ё was not widely accepted until the 1940s). * After Catherine granted to Kazan's Muslims the right to build mosques, the city's Christian leadership decided that mosques were being built too high—higher than churches. They sent a petition to Catherine asking her to prohibit the construction of high minarets. As the legend goes, Catherine replied that she was the tsarina of the Russian land and that the sky was beyond her jurisdiction. * The Polish-Jewish religious leader Jacob Frank spread the rumour that his daughter Eve Frank was Catherine's illegitimate daughter.Frank, Eva article by Rachel Elior in the Encyclopedia Judaica.

It is commonly used in Legal English. An unborn fetus, which is thus still \\"en ventre sa mere\\", may be accepted to be a beneficiary for some purposes, provided it is subsequently born alive. Such a fetus is treated as born if it thereby takes a direct benefit.Re Salaman (1908) 1 Ch 4See also the class closing rules generally in Hawkins on the Construction of Wills 5th edition 2000 chap 14. The use of this concept in legal language can be traced to English cases in the nineteenth century. In Occleston v Fullalove (1873-74) L.R. 9 Ch. App. 147, a case heard in the Court of Appeal in Chancery it was argued for the Appellant that although the child in question was \\"en ventre sa mère\\" at the date of the will subject to the litigation, there was neither principle nor authority against such a child having a reputation of paternity. The Court allowed the after-born child to share with her sisters under the will. The concept is used in common law jurisdictions and has been extended beyond the law of wills and succession so that claims in the law of torts are also recognised. In the Australian case Watt v. Rama [1972] VR 353 it was deemed that a fetus is a person entitled, once born, to compensation as a plaintiff for injury caused while en ventre sa mère. Some U.S. cases have removed the requirement that the fetus actually be born. In Amadio v. Levin, 509 Pa. 199 (1985), the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania held that \\"it makes no difference in liability under the wrongful death and survival statutes whether the child dies of the injuries just prior to or just after birth.\\" In Farley v. Sartin Trucking, 195 W.Va. 671, the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia did away with a requirement that a tortiously killed fetus be viable outside the womb at the time the tort was committed. The deceased unborn child's personal representative may maintain an action pursuant to the state's wrongful death statute, the court held, cautioning that the cause of action does not extend against a woman who has a legal abortion. In current spoken French, the phrase would now be rendered as \\"dans le ventre de sa mère\\".

It airs an adult hits radio format branded as 99.9 Bob FM. The station broadcasts from 1445 Pembina Highway, in Winnipeg, with sister stations CKMM-FM and CFRW. The transmitter is located on Road 54 Northeast, off McGillivrey Boulevard, near Oak Bluff. HistoryAM Radio= The station signed on in 1928 as AM 600 CJRW. As with most early AM radio stations, it changed frequencies several times (see NARBA). It permanently settled at AM 630 in 1935 and adopting the call sign CKRC in 1943. The station was affiliated with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's Dominion Network from 1944 until the network dissolved in 1962. In 1993, CKRC was purchased by two of its employees, Sales Executive Terry O'Rourke and General Manager Bill Gorrie. They owned and ran the station for 3 years. =Switch to FM= O'Rourke and Gorrie got permission from the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to move CKRC to the FM band in 1996. The new FM station adopted the current call letters, CFWM-FM. They branded the new station as Magic 99.9, airing a soft adult contemporary format. In 1997, O'Rourke and Gorrie sold CFWM-FM to Standard Radio. Standard Radio later acquired CKMM-FM and CFQX-FM from Craig Media. (CKMM is now owned by Bell Media, while CFQX is now owned by the Jim Pattison Group.) CFWM had to be sold, as the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) would not let one company own more than two AM or FM stations in the same radio market. CFWM was sold to CHUM Limited in 2001 in exchange for CHOM-FM Montreal. =Bob FM (2002-present)= On March 4, 2002, CFWM became the first radio station in Canada to adopt an adult hits format and gave birth to the Bob FM brand (which has been credited as one of the inspirations behind the more famous Jack FM branding). The Bob-FM format was created by Howard Kroeger. The 'voice' of Bob-FM is Sean Caldwell. In 2007, CFWM, along with the other CHUM Ltd. stations, were sold to CTVglobemedia (now Bell Media). Longtime Winnipeg morning show hosts Beau & Tom (since 1989) moved from CHIQ-FM to CFWM. On August 31, 2009, Frazier, who previously hosted the morning show on CHIQ with Beau & Tom from 1995 to 2000, rejoined Beau & Tom on CFWM. On January 4, 2011, CFWM's morning show and CHIQ- FM's past morning show switched stations, putting Beau, Tom and Frazier back on CHIQ. =Past Personalities= Bob Washington, a personality on the station during the CKRC era, was well known outside of Winnipeg as the \\"voice\\" of K-tel, a Winnipeg-based direct response advertising company. Bill Walker, who later became one of the most recognizable television hosts of the 1950s and 60s, was morning man of CKRC from 1951 to 1955. Other notable personalities from the CKRC era include Doc Steen, Boyd Kozak, Jim Paulson, Scott Walker (Bill's son), Bernie Pascal, Billy Gorrie, Bryan Fustukian (as Vik Armen) and Buster Bodean.

Jonas Chickering was born in Mason Village, and raised in nearby New Ipswich, New Hampshire where his father Abner Chickering kept a farm and worked as a blacksmith. Chickering apprenticed three years as a cabinet maker with John Gould. In 1818 Chickering removed to Boston with Gould's permission, working for cabinet-maker James Baker, but one year later began working for pianomaker John Osborn at 12 Orange Street. In 1823, Chickering formed a partnership with pianomaker James Stewart; they produced 15 pianos the first year at workshops at 20 Common street and sold their first piano on June 23, 1823 for $275. Stewart & Chickering dissolved after four years, and in 1830 Chickering became associated with John Mackay, a merchant, as well as organ and pianomaker who had worked with Alpheus Babcock, doing business as Chickering & Co. at 416 Washington street. In 1837 Chickering & Mackays (with Mackay's son William H. Mackay) built a new five story factory, with warerooms and a small concert hall, at 334 Washington Street, and warehouse at Franklin square. John Mackay was lost at sea February 1841, and Chickering mortgaged the factory and bought out his and William H. Mackay's shares in installments. The Washington street factory burned December 1, 1852 putting out over 200 workmen and amounting to $250,000 loss, as well as all the tools and patterns, and a nearly completed prototype for a grand piano (later indicated as being overstrung). Chickering organized a temporary factory, and began construction of a new steam-powered factory started at 791 Tremont street, designed by Edward Payson to Chickering's specifications. 350px Chickering died before the factory's completion, on December 8, 1853. Over 800 people, including leading piano manufacturers and many of the societies of which Chickering had been a member, marched in his funeral procession and the mayor of Boston ordered the ringing of the city's church bells. 1853 advertisement At the time of his death, Chickering's company had built over 12,000 pianos and was producing about 1,500 a year worth $200,000, almost twice the sales of Timothy Gilbert, his largest competitor in Boston. His pianos at the London International Exhibition of 1851 earned a gold medal with special mention for the grand, which was noted for brilliancy and power as well as its great solidity. Chickering patented single piece iron frames combined with wrest plank bridges and damper guides in square pianos, and with massive wrest plank terminations in grands; Chickering & Mackays were assignees of an action patented by Alpheus Babcock, and licensed actions patented by Edwin Brown and George Howe. Chickering pioneered pronounced curved hammer strike lines in squares which permitted larger hammers, and is also credited encouraging Ichabod Washburn to develop the first music wire produced in the United States. Chickering, with Henry W. Pickering and Edward Frothingborn incorporated a charter to erect the Boston Music Hall, paid for by subscription and built in 1852. He served as president of the Handel and Haydn Society, and of the Massachusetts Charitable Mechanic Association, which he joined in 1829, until his death. Chickering married Elizabeth Sumner Harraden November 20, 1823. They had four children: Thomas E. Chickering, C. Frank Chickering, George H. Chickering, and Anna Chickering. Chickering's sons worked as pianomakers, and became partners in the company in 1853 forming Chickering and Sons.

He was known for portraying Grandad in Bread and Old Mr. Grace in Are You Being Served? Early life Kenneth Waller was born in Huddersfield, Yorkshire on 5 November 1927. In his childhood he moved to Southampton and was living there at the breakout of World War II. In 1949, he was a member of the Christ Church Woodhouse men's choir. After serving in the Royal Air Force, Waller worked for a firm of auctioneers. Career Experience in local rep at the Oxford Playhouse encouraged him to move to London, where he made his West End debut in Julian Slade and Dorothy Reynolds' 1957 musical Free as Air. He was later in the original cast of Give a Dog a Bone in 1964, and took over various roles in various other London productions such as Salad Days and Anne of Green Gables: The Musical. Waller was also associated the Open Air Theatre, Regent's Park, but always looked forward to the times when his work took him on location further afield, including Rome, India and Scandinavia. An excellent pianist and an ardent lover of classical and choral music, Waller was extremely knowledgeable on the subject of oratorio and sang with Anthony Bowles' Actors' choir and the BBC Chorus. He also appeared as the Narrator in Peter and the Wolf, and Carl Davis wrote a special concert piece, \\"Duck's Diary,\\" for him. From the fifties to the seventies, his career as an actor saw him appear on both television and film. On the big screen, he had modest roles in Room at the Top (1959), Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968), Scrooge (1970), Fiddler on the Roof (1971) and Carry On Behind (1975).

History The band began as Buba & The Shop Assistants, consisting of lead vocalist Aggi (Annabel Wright, later of The Pastels), guitarist David Keegan, bassist John Peutherer, and drummer Moray Crawford. This line-up released one single, the now highly collectible \\"Something to Do\\" on Villa21 Records, which was produced by Stephen Pastel. Pastel also contributed backing vocals. Peutherer and Crawford were credited on the sleeve as \\"Murray-John.\\" Aggi left to be replaced by Karen Parker, and later joined by second vocalist Alex Taylor.

The band's name was shortened to Shop Assistants, and the first release under their new name was the Shopping Parade EP in 1985 on The Subway Organization. The lead track, \\"All Day Long\\" was described by Morrissey as his favourite single of that year. Donald left in late 1985, and was briefly replaced on drums by Joan Bride.

Background Luis Vernet In 1765, Captain John Byron explored Saunders Island, which lies 1.5 miles (2.5 km) off the coast of West Falkland. He named the harbour Port Egmont, and claimed this and other islands for Britain, on the grounds of prior discovery. The next year Captain John MacBride established a British settlement at Port Egmont. The British presence in the west continued, until interrupted by Spain (who had acquired the French colony), during the Falkland Crisis from 10 July 1770 to 22 January 1771. Economic pressures led Britain to unilaterally withdraw from many overseas settlements in 1774. On 20 May 1776 the British forces under the command of Lieutenant Clayton formally took their leave of Port Egmont, leaving a plaque asserting Britain's continuing sovereignty over the islands.A brief history of the Falkland Islands Part 2 – Fort St. Louis and Port Egmont. , Accessed 19 July 2007 The Falkland Islands remained an important outpost for whalers and sealers who used the islands to shelter from the worst of the South Atlantic weather. By merit of their location, the Falkland Islands have often been the last refuge for ships damaged at sea. Most numerous among those using the islands were British and American sealers, where typically between 40 and 50 ships were engaged in hunting fur seals. In 1823, after its war of independence against Spain, the United Provinces granted land on East Falkland to Luis Vernet, who first travelled to the islands the following year. That first expedition failed almost as soon as it landed, and a second attempt, in 1826, sanctioned by the British (but delayed until winter by a Brazilian blockade), also failed after arrival in the islands. In 1828, the United Provinces government granted Vernet all of East Falkland, including all its resources, with exemption from taxation if a colony could be established within three years. He took settlers, some of them British, and before leaving once again sought permission first from the British Consulate in Buenos Aires. After receiving consent, Vernet agreed to provide regular reports to the British consul and expressed the desire for British protection for his settlement should they decide to re-establish their presence in the islands. Cawkell, 2001, p. 50.Shuttleworth, 1910, p. 345\\\\. In the course of the year 1829 the Consul- General first called the attention of the Foreign Office to the question of the Falkland Islands. Parish's attention was first called the question early in 1829, when the Buenos Ayreans proposed a scheme for detention of prisoners and convicts in the Islands. Parish at once communicated the intention of the Buenos Ayres Government to the Foreign Office, but before writing his next despatch a new development had arisen. A certain Mt. Louis Vernet had obtained permission from Rosas to colonise Solidad and Staten Island; he had done so with great success, finding the soil suitable for potatoes and other vegetables, the climate excellent, and the prospects for cattle-breeding most promising. Hearing that England claimed sovereignty of the islands, he now applied to Great Britain, through their Charge d'Affairs, for the protection of his colonists. On Vernet's return to the Falklands, Puerto Soledad was renamed Puerto Luis. The United Provinces proclaimed Luis Vernet as governor of the islands in 1829. British diplomatic protests at the appointment and declarations of sovereignty were ignored. The United Provinces also granted Vernet exclusive rights to seal hunting in the islands. This too was disputed by the British and US consulates at Buenos Aires but once again the diplomatic protests were ignored. Vernet continued to provide regular reports to the British consul throughout this period. In 1831, Luis Vernet with his newly created authority, used the services of a Captain Brisbane in the ship Betsy to capture three US vessels (Breakwater, Superior and Harriet) that were hunting seals in Falklands waters. The Breakwater escaped but the catch of the other two ships was confiscated and their crews were arrested. Vernet returned to the mainland, bringing senior officers of the US vessels to stand trial for violating restrictions on seal hunting. The US consul protested violently against the seizure of US ships and the USS Lexington sailed to the Falklands. The log of the Lexington reports only the destruction of arms and a powder store, though in his claim against the US government for compensation (rejected by the US government of President Grover Cleveland in 1885) Vernet stated that the settlement was destroyed. The Islands were declared free from all government, the seven senior members of the settlement were arrested for piracy and taken to Montevideo, where they were released without charge on the orders of Commodore Rogers.Tatham, 2008, pp. 117 This latter incident finally convinced the British Foreign Office to reassert its sovereignty claim over the islands. Throughout much of 1832, the United Provinces did not have a government representative in the islands. The Buenos Aires government commissioned Major Esteban Mestivier as the new governor of the islands, to set up a penal colony, but when he arrived at the settlement on 15 November 1832 his soldiers mutinied and killed him. The mutiny was put down by Major José María Pinedo, commander of the United Provinces schooner Sarandí. Order was restored just before the British arrived. Arrival of the squadron HMS Clio, by Cmdr. William Farrington, c. 1812 Under the command of Captain John James Onslow, the brig-sloop HMS Clio, previously stationed at Rio de Janeiro, reached Port Egmont on 20 December 1832. It was later joined by HMS Tyne. Their first actions were to repair the fort at Port Egmont and affix a notice of possession. Onslow arrived at Puerto Louis on 2 January 1833. Pinedo sent an officer to the British ship, where he was presented with the following written request to replace the Argentine flag with the British one, and leave the location. Pinedo entertained plans for resisting, but finally desisted because of his obvious numerical inferiority and the want of enough nationals among his crew (approximately 80% of his forces were British mercenaries who refused to fight their countrymen). The British forces disembarked on 3 January and switched the flags, delivering the Argentine one to Pinedo, who left on 5 January. Recognising Vernet's settlement had British permission, Onslow set about ensuring the continuation of that settlement for the replenishment of passing ships. The gauchos had not been paid since Vernet's departure and were anxious to return to the mainland. Onslow persuaded them to stay by paying them in silver for provisions and promising that in the absence of Vernet's authority they could earn their living from the feral cattle on the islands. The British vessels did not stay long and departed two days later, leaving William Dickson (Vernet's storekeeper) in charge of the settlement. Dixon was provided with a flagpole and instructed to fly the British flag whenever a vessel was in harbour. Argentina claims that the population of the islands was expelled in 1833;Secretaría de Relaciones Exteriores – the Malvinas Islands however, both British and Argentine sources from the time, including the log of the ARA Sarandí, suggest that the colonists were encouraged to remain under Vernet's deputy, Matthew Brisbane.Fitzroy, R., VOYAGES OF THE ADVENTURE AND BEAGLE. VOLUME II. Accessed 2 October 2007 Aftermath HMS Beagle HMS Beagle arrived on 15 March 1833. Vernet dispatched his deputy Matthew Brisbane to the islands to take charge of his settlement March 1833. Meeting with Captain Fitzroy of the Beagle, he was encouraged to continue with Vernet's enterprise provided there was no attempt to further the ambitions of the United Provinces. Like Onslow before him, Fitzroy was forced to use his powers of persuasion to encourage the gauchos to continue working in Vernet's establishment: Arriving in the Falklands, Fitzroy expected to find the thriving settlement reported by another British officer. Instead, he found the settlement in a derelict state, which Brisbane blamed upon the Lexington's raid. Fitzroy questioned several members of the settlement who corroborated Brisbane's account: On departing from the islands Fitzroy expressed his concern for the settlement with its lack of regular authority in a virtually lawless group of islands. On 26 August 1833, eight members of the settlement led by Antonio Rivero ran amok, killing the five senior members. In part this stemmed from the re-imposition of paying the wages of the gauchos in paper vouchers issued by Vernet. In 1834 on his second visit Charles Darwin commented that: Lieutenant Henry Smith was installed as the first British resident in January 1834; he immediately set about establishing British authority, arresting the murderers. The United Kingdom has held the territory ever since but for a two-month period after the 1982 invasion, during the Falklands War. In Buenos Aires, Vernet was effectively bankrupt and attempts to obtain compensation from the US Government for losses from the Lexington raid proved fruitless. The situation in Buenos Aires was chaotic and diplomatic relations with the US remained ruptured till 1839. He made several approaches to the British Government asking for support to re- establish his business at Port Louis, receiving support from Woodbine Parish (British chargé d'affaires in Buenos Aires from 1825 to 1832) as the best qualified person to develop the islands. Vernet wrote to Lieutenant Smith offering advice, which was gratefully received and acted upon. Smith repeatedly urged Vernet to return to Port Louis but as Vernet became increasingly involved in the territorial dispute with the Government in Buenos Aires all communications ceased and no more accounts were sent. An approach to Lieutenant Lowcay to retrieve his property was rebuffed but later he was requested to remove his property as the Government could not be responsible for it.

Historical precursors In Austria, congregational singing of sacred texts in Old High German at Easter Masses is attested by medieval manuscripts dating as early as the twelfth century. The hymn Christ ist erstanden, translated from the Easter sequence Victimae paschali laudes, became very popular, sung with processions and also sung before the Gospel at Mass, in alternation with the Latin text. With the success of that translation, vernacular versions of other feast-day sequences followed. In addition, vernacular adaptations of parts of the Ordinary of the Mass appeared as early as the 1260s, when a homily of Berthold of Regensburg describes a profession of faith which was sung after the Latin Credo: \\"I believe in the Father, I believe in the Son of my Lady Saint Mary, and in the Holy Spirit, Kyrie eleison.\\" By the time of the Council of Trent, vernacular singing was so well-established that the emperor Ferdinand I asked the Council in 1562 to preserve the existing practice and allow vernacular singing in the Mass. In 1581, a hymnal in Prague included metrical adaptations of the Kyrie, Gloria, Credo and the Lord's Prayer. Origin The German Singmesse, in its classic form, originated in efforts toward a German-language celebration of the Mass during the Enlightenment era, especially in southern Germany and in Austria, in areas influenced by Josephinism. Together with the Augustinian canon and musician Norbert Hauner, the dean of the Herrenchiemsee abbey, Franz Seraph von Kohlbrenner published his book of songs and prayers Der heilige Gesang zum Gottesdienste in der römisch-katholischen Kirche. Erster Theil, which presented the liturgy in the German language, at Landshut in 1777. In this book for the first time the service is conceived as a Singmesse, a form of Mass sung by the faithful. The still popular Advent hymn Tauet, Himmel, den Gerechten, for example, appears here as an offertory song during the Sundays of Advent. In 1795 Michael Haydn reworked Hauner's melodic settings and created his own Deutsches vollständiges Hoch-Amt from them. This series of songs for the individual parts of the Mass (which were still spoken softly by the priest in Latin) is usually named for the first lines of the opening song Hier liegt vor deiner Majestät or simply designated as the Haydn Mass. The text reflects the spirit of the Enlightenment and, through the Singmesse, it has become part of German Catholic heritage. This second setting is the best known Singmesse and appears to this day in several regional editions of the 1975 Catholic hymnal Gotteslobg. As a matter of liturgical history, the Singmesse varieties replaced the orchestral Masses previously used, which Kaiser Joseph II had forbidden in his domain. The most famous 19th-century Singmesse, the 1826 Deutsche Messe by Franz Schubert, is based on Haydn's exemplar. Like his, it is not a setting of the classic Mass Ordinary, but instead offers German-language songs whose sensibility is freely related to the expressions in the Ordinary, and that express the feelings of the worshippers in Romantic style. Other composers who wrote works in the form of the Singmesse include Leopold Mozart and Franz Xaver Gruber. The Betsingmesse Following the recommendations of Romano Guardini and the Benedictines of Maria Laach Abbey under Abbot Ildefons Herwegen, the Augustinian canon Pius Parsch of Klosterneuburg Monastery celebrated so-called \\"Community Masses\\" (Gemeinschaftsmessen) in the Church of St. Gertrude (Klosterneuburg) in 1922, in which parts of the Mass were sung by the people in the German language. By this, he wanted to develop active participation by the worshippers and a sense of relationship with early Christianity. These celebrations amounted to the birth of the liturgical movement in Austria and Germany. A groundbreaking event was the celebration of a Betsingmesse at the Vienna Catholic convention (Katholikentag) in 1933. In the Betsingmesse parts of the Mass propers (the variable parts of the Mass) were presented in the form of German songs. German sung forms or songs were also developed or appointed for the Mass Ordinary. At the same time, the texts were spoken in Latin by the priest, just as before, so the two-track structure of the priestly and congregational action was still present.Hans Bernhard Meyer: Eucharistie. Geschichte, Theologie, Pastoral Regensburg: Pustet 1989 (Der Gottesdienst der Kirche, Vol. 4), p. 283 Later developments The Betsingmesse became obsolete with the liturgical reform introduced after the Second Vatican Council and with the introduction of vernacular liturgy in the celebration of the Missa cum populo. The tradition of carrying out parts of the liturgy in the form of German songs that are not necessarily a German rendering of those parts of the liturgy: e.g., by a \\"Song at the Gloria\\" or a \\"Song at the Sanctus\\", however, has been retained in many parishes, even if it is regarded critically by liturgists and is not supported by the official documents as part of the modern Roman rite.

He was also a member of the Order of Saint John. Career Mondion was born in Paris, and he studied military engineering under Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban. He first arrived in Malta in 1715 during the magistracy of Grand Master Ramon Perellos y Roccaful of the Order of St. John. His early work was as deputy to the military engineer René Jacob de Tigné. One of his early works was the second Marsalforn Tower, which however no longer exists. Mondion was eventually admitted into the Order of St. John as a Cavaliere di Grazia, and he obtained permanent residency in Malta. Mondion is buried in the crypt of the Chapel of St. Anthony of Padua in Fort Manoel Grand Master António Manoel de Vilhena's accession in June 1722 created a significant opportunity for Mondion, as the new Prince of Malta decided to unleash an ambitious building programme. On 3 November 1722, Vilhena issued orders for the restoration of the former capital Mdina and its fortifications, and entrusted de Mondion with this renovation. Mondion designed a number of Baroque buildings in the city, including the Main Gate, the portal of Greeks Gate, the Torre dello Standardo, Palazzo Vilhena, the Banca Giuratale and the Corte Capitanale. Mondion was also involved in the construction or modifications of the Floriana Lines, Fort Manoel, the fortifications of Birgu and the Santa Margherita Lines. He designed several gates within these fortifications, including Porte des Bombes and St. Helen's Gate. His unexpected death in 1733 cut short a promising career. Mondion was buried in the crypt of the Chapel of St Anthony of Padua within Fort Manoel.

It is maintained by the County of Bucks, Department of Parks and Recreation. The museum was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972, and was later included in a National Historic Landmark District along with the Mercer Museum and Fonthill. These three structures are the only cast-in-place concrete structures built by Mercer. Sample work from the tile plant in Mercer Museum, the cement museum by Henry Mercer. Handmade tiles are still produced in a manner similar to that developed by the pottery's founder and builder, Henry Chapman Mercer. Tile designs are reissues of original designs. Mercer was a major proponent of the Arts and Crafts movement in America. He directed the work at the pottery from 1898 until his death in 1930. Mercer generally did not affix a potter's mark to tiles made while he directed the work at MPTW. Following his death, there were several marks used to indicate that a tile had originated at MPTW. When the Bucks County Department of Parks and Recreation took over the MPTW as a working museum, all tiles made by the museum were impressed on the obverse with a stylized \\"MOR,\\" the words \\"Bucks County\\" and the year of manufacture (see illustration). The reproduction tiles made today are made using Mercer's original molds, clay that is obtained locally and has properties similar to those of Mercer's original source, slips and glazes that follow Mercer's final formulations, although some have been modified to reduce the lead and heavy metal content to less toxic levels. The Tile Works is one of three cast-in- place concrete structures built by Mercer. The others include Fonthill, which is located on the same property and served as his home; and the Mercer Museum, located approximately one mile away. The Moravian Pottery and Tile Works offers workshops and an apprenticeship program to teach the art of handcrafting ceramic tiles and mosaics.

It was long (excluding the paddle wheel) and wide and weighed 959 tons (870 tonnes), excluding cargo. For a while the Montana's size allowed it to compete with the railroads, but the railroads continued to close the gap. On June 22, 1884, the Montana met its fate near Bridgeton, Missouri, when it collided with the Wabash Bridge and/or a submerged tree branch (a snag) by various accounts. To allow its cargo to be unloaded, it was beached on the Bridgeton side of the river, where in the following years its rotting hulk was repeatedly buried and uncovered as the banks of the river shifted. In the winter of 2001–2002, unusually low water levels in the Missouri exposed the remains of the Montana for the first time since the mid-1960s, and the State Historic Preservation Office of the Missouri Department of Natural Resources contracted SCI Engineering, Inc., of nearby St. Charles to monitor and photographically document the remains. The following autumn, at the invitation of Dr. Steve J. Dasovich, head of SCI's Archaeological Services Division, members of East Carolina University's Maritime History Program conducted an excavation and investigation of the wreckage. In 2012, low waters once again exposed the wreckage, and it was the subject of news reports. In these reports, Dr. Dasovich is quoted attributing the wreck to the boat's striking a submerged tree rather than its striking a bridge. The Montana was the subject of the History Channel's Deep Sea Detectives episode \\"Skeleton in the Sand: The Montana\\" in September 2003Deep Sea Detectives: Episodes.

It can be induced by an energetic particle stream injected in a plasma, or setting a current along the plasma so different species (ions and electrons) can have different drift velocities. The energy from the particles can lead to plasma wave excitation. Two-stream instability can arise from the case of two cold beams, in which no particles are resonant with the wave, or from two hot beams, in which there exist particles from one or both beams which are resonant with the wave. Two-stream instability is known in various limiting cases as beam-plasma instability, beam instability, or bump-on-tail instability.  Dispersion relation in cold-beam limit  Consider a cold, uniform, and unmagnetized plasma, where ions are stationary and the electrons have velocity \\\\mathbf{V}_0, that is, the reference frame is moving with the ion stream. Let the electrostatic waves be of the form: \\\\mathbf{E}_1 = \\\\xi_1 \\\\exp[i(kx - \\\\omega t)] \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{x}} Applying linearization techniques to the equation of motions for both species, to the equation of continuity, and Poisson's equation, and introducing the spatial and temporal harmonic operators \\\\partial_t \\\\rightarrow -i\\\\omega, abla \\\\rightarrow ik we can get the following expression: 1 = \\\\omega_{pe}^2 \\\\left[\\\\frac{m_e/m_i}{\\\\omega^2} + \\\\frac{1}{(\\\\omega - kv_0)^2} \\\\right], which represents the dispersion relation for longitudinal waves, and represents a quartic equation in \\\\omega. The roots can be expressed in the form: \\\\omega_j = \\\\omega_j^R + i\\\\gamma_j If the imaginary part (Im(\\\\omega_j)) is zero, then the solutions represent all the possible modes, and there is no temporal wave growth or damping at all: \\\\mathbf{E} = \\\\xi \\\\exp[i(kx - \\\\omega t)] \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{x}} If Im(\\\\omega_j) e 0, that is, any of the roots are complex, they will occur in complex conjugate pairs. Substituting in the expression for electrostatic waves leads to: \\\\mathbf{E} = \\\\xi \\\\exp[i(kx - \\\\omega_j^R t)] \\\\exp[\\\\gamma t] \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{x}} Because of the second exponential function at the right, the temporal dynamics of the wave amplitude depends strongly on the parameter \\\\gamma; if \\\\gamma < 0, then the waves will be exponentially damped; on the other hand, if \\\\gamma > 0, then the waves are unstable and will grow at an exponential rate.  Wave–particle interactions  right In the hot-beam case, the two-stream instability can be thought of as the inverse of Landau damping. There are particles which have the same velocity as the wave. The existence of a greater number of particles that move slower than the wave phase velocity v_{ph} as compared with those that move faster, leads to an energy transfer from the wave to the particles. In the case of the two-stream instability, when an electron stream is injected to the plasma, the particles' velocity distribution function has a \\"bump\\" on its \\"tail\\". If a wave has phase velocity in the region where the slope is positive, there is a greater number of faster particles (v > v_{ph}) than slower particles, and so there is a greater amount of energy being transferred from the fast particles to the wave, giving rise to exponential wave growth. In the cold-beam case, there are no particles which have the same velocity as the phase velocity of the wave (no particles are resonant). However, the wave can grow exponentially even so; this is the case discussed in the above section. In this case, the beam particles are bunched in space in a propagating wave in a self-reinforcing way even though no particles move with the propagation velocity. In both the hot-beam and cold-beam case, the instability grows until the beam particles are trapped in the electric field of the wave. This is when the instability is said to saturate.

Until 2017 Kistler's winemaking was supervised by Steve Kistler, who studied creative writing at Stanford University. Kistler also oversaw the vineyard work. Mark Bixler, who has a PhD in Chemistry from the University of California at Berkeley ran the business and sales side of the winery as well as helping in the lab. In 2008, Kistler sold his majority stake in the company to the owner of Durell Vineyard, Bill Price. At that time they brought the Vineyard Manager from Hudson Vineyards in Carneros, Jason Kesner, as Steve's assistant winemaker, with the intention of a long transitional period. That plan came to fruition at the end of 2017 with Jason now overseeing all production, farming, and day-to-day business. In 2014, Kistler opened its very first tasting facility at its Trenton Roadhouse property - a 60 acre vineyard that features a 100+ year old renovated farmhouse and barn. It has been lauded as, \\"the best wine tasting experience in Sonoma/Napa\\".

These compounds are used to study how chemical bonds in molecules adapt to strain. In-methylcyclophanes in particular have a methyl group in proximity to a benzene ring. This is only possible when both methyl group and ring are attached to the same rigid scaffold. In one In-methylcyclophane molecule this is accomplished with a triptycene frame.Sterically Congested in- Methylcyclophanes Qiuling Song, Douglas M. Ho, and Robert A. Pascal, Jr. J. Am. Chem. Soc.; 2005; 127(32) pp 11246 - 11247; (Communication) This particular compound is synthesed starting from anthracene with a methyl group added to each arene ring (1,8,9-trimethylanthracene). A triptycene compound is formed from a reaction of this anthracene compound with an aryne in a Diels- Alder reaction in isoamyl nitrite. In this synthesis the precursor to the reactive aryne is 2-amino-6-methylbenzoic acid. Next the methyl substituents are functionalized with bromine groups by the photochemical reaction with N-bromosuccinimide or NBS. The final cyclophane is put together by reaction with 1,3,5-tris(mercaptomethyl)benzene with nucleophilic sulfhydryl groups and electrophilic alkyl bromides in a nucleophilic aliphatic Substitution. X-ray crystallography of the tri-sulfone derivative of this cyclophane shows that the methyl group located 289.6 picometers from the center of the benzene ring. The carbon-to-carbon bond linking the methyl group to the triptycene frame is actually shortened and measures 147.5 to 149.5 pm. The similar bond in the triptycene precursor is 154 pm. Proton NMR analysis shows a chemical shift of 2.52 ppm for the methyl protons compared to that of 3.16 to 3.85 in the anthracene compound. The reason for this anomaly is that the methyl protons are in line with the aromatic ring current of the benzene ring and are therefore severely shielded, an effect similar to the nucleus-independent chemical shift method of analyzing aromaticity.

The show aired on NBC television from September 1967 to April 1969. Executive produced by Desi Arnaz, the series was created by Bob Carroll, Jr., and Madelyn Davis.  Premise  The parents, clockwise: Roger Buell, Herb Hubbard, Eve Hubbard, and Kaye Buell Eve (Eve Arden) and Herb Hubbard (Herbert Rudley) have lived next door to Kaye (Kaye Ballard) and Roger Buell (played first by Roger C. Carmel and later by Richard Deacon) for over 20 years. Herb is a successful lawyer, while Roger is a television writer who works at home. The Hubbards are very straitlaced, the Buells off-the-wall and fun-loving. Despite their differences, including an age disparity of about twenty years, they are best friends. In spite of their friendship, though, they do tend to get into more than their share of squabbles. The Buells' son Jerry (Jerry Fogel)Jerry Fogel; Aveleyman.com and the Hubbards' daughter Suzie (Deborah Walley) fall in love while in college, marry, and set up house in the Hubbards' garage apartment. The two sets of parents have different ideas of how their children should live their lives, and the constant meddling of the mothers-in-law provides the premise for the series. One of the differences between the two couples is that Kaye allowed Suzie to call her Mother Buell, but Eve would not allow Jerry to call her Mother Hubbard without objecting because of the name's association with the English nursery rhyme. During the second season, the young couple have a set of fraternal twins, a boy and a girl named Joey and Hildy (from the middle names of Kaye and Eve).  Episodes  Characters  * Eve Arden as Eve Hildegarde Hubbard (née Windsor), wife of attorney Herb Hubbard and mother of Suzie Hubbard Buell. A housewife, she and Kaye tend to meddle and interfere with the kids' marriage and lives, which serves as the premise of the show. When she got annoyed with her husband, or her male in-laws, she would utter coldly, \\"Beast!\\" She also had a tendency to sarcastically mock in a high voice when she is shown something that she is in disbelief of, namely when it comes from Herb or Kaye. The name of her granddaughter, Hildy, whom she spoils and dotes on, comes from her middle name. * Kaye Ballard as Katherine \\"Kaye\\" Josephina Buell (née Balotta), wife of Roger Buell and overprotective mother of Jerry Buell. She is known for not being too enthusiastic at being a housewife, for speaking in Italian, and for smacking her husband when she got annoyed with him, especially when they were in bed, and she would smack him the back. She had once had a career in show business, when she was a singer with various bands like Ozzie Snick and Charlie Banks and his Ten Tellers. She is also known for being overly emotional; her catch phrases included \\"Oh, Reeeeally?\\", \\"Good luck with your MOUTH!\\", \\"This, THIS, is the thanks I get!\\", \\"Rats!\\" (usually uttered when she and Eve are thwarted in their schemes) and \\"Yes, YES, I am!\\" (Ballard notes that the catchphrases were inspired by her mother and had used them in her performance shows before and after the series’ run). She is affectionately nicknamed \\"Cookie\\". The name of her grandson, Joey, whom she spoils and dotes on, as she does his father, comes from her middle name. * Herbert Rudley as Herb Hubbard, a successful attorney who tended to get very exasperated with the wives' constant meddling and interfering with the kids and their marriage. He tended to be very temperamental as well. When he and Eve argued, they would invariably repeat what the other was saying in anger. * Roger C. Carmel (season 1) and Richard Deacon (season 2) as Roger C. Buell, a bombastic television script writer who often worked from home. He, like Herb, got very exasperated with the wives' continual interference with the kids and their marriage and lives. When he got annoyed with Kaye, he would call her by her full given name, Katherine, and would also announce, \\"Now you hear this...\\". He is affectionately nicknamed \\"Cutes\\", is sometimes a target of Kaye's wrath, and is also known for being a miserly cheapskate. * Jerry Fogel as Jerome \\"Jerry\\" Buell, a college student married to Suzie Hubbard and father of twins, Hildy and Joey. Eve didn't think that Jerry was good enough for Suzie to marry, and she wanted her to marry someone who was more financially stable. Although she did like Jerry, she refused to let him call her \\"Mother Hubbard\\". He is overly protected by his doting mother, Kaye, who calls him her \\"darling baby boy\\". Jerry and Suzie had grown up together and had known one another all their lives. * Deborah Walley as Susan \\"Suzie\\" Buell (née Hubbard), a college student married to Jerry and mother of twins, Hildy and Joey. Kaye didn't think Suzie was good enough for Jerry to marry, and she wanted him to marry an Italian girl. Despite it all, she loved Suzie enough to allow her to call her Mother Buell. She, like her mother, would utter \\"Beast\\" at her husband when she was annoyed with him. She could also become overly emotional. (Actress Kay Cole portrayed the \\"Suzie\\" character in the unaired pilot episode only. In that episode, scenes with Cole were later reshot with Walley.) Desi Arnaz, who produced and directed the show, appeared in four episodes, using his Ricky Ricardo accent and trademark mispronunciation of words to full effect. He appeared as a matador named Raphael Delgado y de Acha III, whom the wives had called as a result of a wrong number, and became somewhat of a family friend. This is one of the rare occasions in which the characters had the same first names as the actors portraying them. In the first season, the notable exception was Deborah Walley who played Suzie. In the second season, Richard Deacon played Roger C. Buell replacing Roger C. Carmel and joined Deborah in that distinction.  Production  The majority of the episodes were written by series creators Madelyn Davis and Bob Carroll, Jr., who had worked with series producer Desi Arnaz on I Love Lucy. Unlike most sitcoms of the era, The Mothers-in-Law was filmed before a live audience; standard practice at the time was to film an episode on a closed set and add a laugh track during post-production. However, a laugh track was still used to “sweeten” audience reactions or fill in gaps of missed punchlines. When choosing the two lead roles, executive producer Desi Arnaz approached two longtime friends Eve Arden and Ann Sothern. Both actresses had been friends of Arnaz and his former wife Lucille Ball since the 1930s while working at RKO Pictures and MGM. Arden achieved television stardom in the hit CBS-TV sitcom Our Miss Brooks as high school teacher Connie Brooks from 1952 to 1956 and won an Emmy for Best Actress in a Comedy Series. The show was produced by Desilu. Sothern also had great success on television with her two popular sitcoms Private Secretary (as Susie MacNamara) from 1953 to 1956 and the Desilu-produced The Ann Sothern Show as (Katy O'Connor) from 1958 to 1961. She had also guest starred on the 1957 premiere episode of The Lucy- Desi Comedy Hour entitled \\"Lucy Takes a Cruise to Havana\\" (reprising her role of Susie MacNamara) and on seven episodes of The Lucy Show (as the Countess Framboise - née Rosie Harrigan). However, NBC found Sothern and Arden's comedic style too similar and passed on casting Sothern. Singer-comedienne Kaye Ballard, another old friend, auditioned for and got the part of the neighbor, Kaye Buell. Actress Kay Cole, who would later appear on Broadway in the original cast of A Chorus Line, portrayed the role of Suzie Hubbard in the unaired pilot; however, after the series was picked up, Cole was replaced by actress Deborah Walley who would remain with the series for its entire two- year run. The scenes featuring Cole were re-filmed for the aired version of the pilot, “On Again, Off Again, Lohengrin”. Cole can be briefly glimpsed in the final shot before the end credits. Home video release  MPI Home Video (under license from Desilu, Too) released the complete series of The Mothers- in-Law on DVD in Region 1 on July 27, 2010. This release includes a new introduction from Desi Arnaz, Jr., who appeared in two episodes as Tommy, a drum playing friend of Jerry and Suzie Buell; an interview with Kaye Ballard; the original unaired pilot episode (consists of the same footage as the first episode, \\"On Again, Off Again, Lohengrin,\\" except with Kay Cole as Suzie instead of Deborah Walley; only Suzie's scenes would be reshot for the aired version); original sponsor tags; cast commercials; scripts for unproduced episodes; The Carol Channing Show, a comedy pilot which starred Carol Channing, Jane Dulo and Richard Deacon; and Land's End, a dramatic pilot starring Rory Calhoun. The latter were two failed pilots from Desi Arnaz Productions.  Ratings  Despite being sandwiched between Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color and Bonanza, the show never garnered the ratings NBC had hoped for. The first season ranked 37th with an 18.8 rating http://www.thetvratingsguide.com/1991/08/1967-68-top-30-tv-ratings.html and the second season ranked 40th with a 19.4 rating.http://www.thetvratingsguide.com/1991/08/1968-69-top-30-tv-ratings.html The network considered canceling the show after the first season, but agreed to renew it for the same price as the first season (after sponsor Procter & Gamble had announced plans to move the series to another network). All cast members agreed to do the second season for the same money except for Carmel, who was replaced with Richard Deacon. (Officially, Carmel had a salary dispute with producer Desi Arnaz, although, according to rumors, he was fired because his drug use interfered with production.)“Roger (Over and Out)”, News From Me (Newsfromme.com). September 12, 2003. (Retrieved 2018-08-09.) Season 2 performed worse than Season 1, leading to its cancellation. On The Doris Day Show Season 4 DVD, Ballard remarked that the network and sponsor wanted The Bill Cosby Show to replace The Mothers-in-Law during the 1969–70 season.
