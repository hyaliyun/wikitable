However, in 1578, he was attacked in his castle at Otate by Uesugi Kagekatsu‚ÄîKagetora's respective brother-in-law‚Äîand was subsequently defeated. Kagetora committed suicide the following year. History Uesugi Kagetora was born in either 1552 or 1554, and during his lifetime was also known as H≈çj≈ç Ujihide (ÂåóÊù°Ê∞èÁßÄ), H≈çj≈ç Sabur≈ç (ÂåóÊù°‰∏âÈÉé), Sabur≈ç Kagetora (‰∏âÈÉéÊôØËôé). He was the seventh son (sixth to survive to adulthood) of H≈çj≈ç Ujiyasu, younger brother of H≈çj≈ç Ujimasa, H≈çj≈ç Ujiteru, H≈çj≈ç Ujikuni, H≈çj≈ç Ujinori, H≈çj≈ç Ujitada, and older brother of H≈çj≈ç Ujimitsu. His mother was the sister-in-law of Toyama Yasumitsu, a vassal of the H≈çj≈ç clan (other sources say Suikeiin, Ujiyasu's principle wife). It's likely that he and H≈çj≈ç Ujihide were two different people and that Ujihide was the son of H≈çj≈ç Tsunashige and living in Edo while Sabur≈ç was living in Echigo, so most historians refer to him as H≈çj≈ç Sabur≈ç when describing his early life. As a child, he was sent into the priesthood at S≈çun-ji in Hakone, then sent as hostage to Takeda Shingen of the Takeda clan in the three-way alliance between H≈çj≈ç, Takeda, and Imagawa formed in 1554. He was adopted by his uncle H≈çj≈ç Gen'an in 1569 and married his daughter. When the H≈çj≈ç and Uesugi clans formed an alliance in 1569, Sabur≈ç was sent to Uesugi Kenshin in an exchange of hostages with Kakizaki Haruie. At first, the hostage was set to be H≈çj≈ç Ujimasa's third son Kunimasumaru, but Ujimasa could not bring himself to send off his son, who was then still a baby. Sabur≈ç was sent to the Uesugi clan in early 1570. Kenshin, who never married, developed a liking for the handsome and intelligent Sabur≈ç. He married his niece Seienin, the daughter of Nagao Masakage and older sister of Nagao Akikage (Uesugi Kagekatsu) to Sabur≈ç, gave him the name Kagetora (a name that had once belonged to Kenshin himself), and adopted him into the Uesugi clan. When Kenshin died suddenly in 1578 without naming an heir, Kagetora and Kagekatsu, similarly adopted by Kenshin, fought for succession to the position of clan head. This episode became known as the Otate no Ran. Though Kagetora held the early advantage with the backing of Uesugi vassals such as Uesugi Kagenobu, H≈çj≈ç Hidetsuna, Kitaj≈ç Takahiro, and the H≈çj≈ç clan, the tide of the battle turned with Takeda Katsuyori's betrayal to Kagekatsu's side. When Otate Castle fell in 1579, Kagetora attempted to escape to Odawara Castle (the H≈çj≈ç clan stronghold, Kagetora's birth land) but was betrayed at Samegao Castle by Horie Munechika and committed suicide. Kagetora's wife committed suicide along with him, though there are also accounts that she remained behind at the Otate and committed suicide there when her brother Kagekatsu refused Kagetora's surrender. Kagetora's oldest son, Doumanmaru died at the hands of Kagekatsu's troops along with Uesugi Norimasa, and the rest of Kagetora's children were believed to have died along with their parents during the Otate power struggle. There are accounts that Kagetora was better to replace Kenshin as heir, as Kagetora once aided Kenshin in a battle using his intelligence and earned him Kenshin's name, while Kagekatsu was only popular at gaining support in Uesugi clan. Cultural references A modern-day reincarnation of Kagetora appears in the light novel and anime series, Mirage of Blaze. He is one of the two primary characters‚Äîmembers of the Uesugi Netherworld Force‚Äîresponsible for exorcising undead soldiers from the Japanese Feudal Era, which are taking part in a modern-day war, led by reincarnations of various feudal era warlords, including the spirit of Takeda Shingen.

Mega Morphs is based on a series of action figures made by Toy Biz. The comics feature Spider-Man, Ghost Rider, Captain America, Hulk and Wolverine. The comic was drawn by Lou Kang and written by Sean McKeever.  Plot  Spider-Man, Ghost Rider, Captain America, the Hulk, and Wolverine have been selected by Iron Man to command large robotic suits of armor to fight evil when a threat for a single superhero becomes too large. Doctor Octopus stole Iron Man's designs and made his own Mega Morph, and was out to create a device that would sap the world's superhumans of all their powers, and would allow Octavius and Doctor Doom to take over the Earth until the original Mega Morphs stopped him.  Publication history  The first issue premiered on August 10, 2005. The Mega Morph toys came with short minicomics that served as prequels to the Marvel four-issue series. Functions The Mega Morphs are powered by the super-powers of the superhuman piloting them, allowing the robot to use the abilities of their pilot, as shown in the beginnings of the mini-comics and the Wolverine mini-comic. In it, Octavius' Mega Morph breaks open Wolverine's robot in space, making it so that Wolverine would be unable to breathe, but Logan fought back, saying that due to his healing factor, the robot would repair itself. The statement was true, as the metal that had been shattered instantly started regenerating. Spider-Man's robot can also produce webbing thanks to Spider-Man's ability to create organic webbing. Also, if the superhuman inside has somehow been de-powered (like the Hulk is able to be) or is not currently using the Mega Morph, the robot will be useless and will not be able to do anything unless the superhuman comes back or their powers return. Transformations *Spider-Man's robot turns into the Arachno- Fighter, a vehicle resembling a spider. *Captain America's robot turns into the Warbird, a vehicle resembling a helicopter, but with legs (the \\"Warbird\\" name is unrelated to the alias that Carol Danvers used once). *Doctor Octopus's robot turns into the Octo-copter a vehicle resembling a cargo helicopter. *The Hulk's robot turns into the Rage Tank, a vehicle resembling a tank. *Wolverine's robot turns into the Aero-Slasher, a vehicle resembling a strangely shaped aircraft. *Ghost Rider's robot turns into the Street Blazer, a vehicle resembling a motorcycle which is actually scaled correctly for a humanoid-formed Mega Morph to ride. *Thing's robot turns into the Clobberin' Time Tank, a vehicle resembling an armored Humvee truck. *Iron Man's robot turns into the Sky-Fighter, a vehicle resembling a stealth jet aircraft. *Venom's robot turns into the Spider-Smasher, a vehicle that looks extremely similar to Spider-Man's Arachno-Fighter. (The toy is the same, with new colors.) Continuity Marvel did not originally reveal if Mega Morphs took place on Earth-616 (mainstream Marvel) or another Earth. However, in the Daily Bugle: Civil War Special, there was an article about Tony Stark denying any involvement in creating gigantic fighting machines, which seemed to indicate that it did take place in regular continuity. The comic also featured references to past events in mainstream continuity, including Spider-Man, Ghost Rider, the Hulk and Wolverine's brief tenure as the \\"New Fantastic Four\\", and an appearance of the Red Ronin, a giant robot of the Marvel universe. However the series was confirmed as taking place on an alternate Earth (Earth-50810) in the 2015 ongoing series Web Warriors, which had the Mega Morphs versions of Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus appearing among the myriad of characters who were displaced from their home dimensions by the Web of Life and Destiny. Future developments After the third series of toys was released, it became unclear if the toy line would be continued with a fourth. Hasbro acquired the rights to produce Marvel action figures and they subsequently made a similar collection, Transformers Crossovers, which includes giant transforming robots modelled after Marvel superheroes.

Background Born in London, he was the eldest son of William √† Beckett, also a solicitor. His younger brothers were Gilbert Abbott √† Beckett, one of the original staff of Punch and the author of 'Comic History of England', and Thomas Turner √† Beckett (13 September 1808 ‚Äì 1 July 1892). He was educated at Westminster School, publishing a youthful volume of verse, The Siege of Dumbarton Castle, in 1824. In 1829 he was called to the bar by Lincoln's Inn. Legal career In 1837, √† Beckett migrated to New South Wales and edited the 'Literary News', a short-lived newspaper. In 1838 √† Beckett, along with William Foster and Richard Windeyer, defended the 11 colonists charged with murder in relation to the Myall Creek massacre. He was appointed acting Solicitor General for the colony in March 1841, and Solicitor General in March 1843. In July 1844 he became an acting judge, and was made a full puisne judge of the Supreme Court of NSW. In January 1846, he was appointed to the Supreme Court of New South Wales for the District of Port Phillip as the resident judge. In 1851 he was created a knight bachelor. When in January 1852 the separate colony of Victoria was proclaimed he became its first Chief Justice. He returned to Melbourne in December 1854 in time to participate in the Eureka Stockade trials. Although often accused of the inflammatory comments at the trial of the arsonists of the Eureka Hotel, it was the actually the Acting Chief Justice Redmond Barry who sparked the Eureka uprising. √Ä Beckett retired as Chief Justice in 1857 due to poor health, and in 1863 he returned to England. Author Politically conservative, √† Beckett was strongly opposed to the social disruption caused by the Victorian Gold Rush and under the pseudonym 'Colonus' espoused his views in an influential pamphlet somewhat cumbersomely entitled Does the Discovery of Gold in Victoria Viewed in Relation to its Moral and Social Effects as Hitherto Developed Deserve to be Considered a National Blessing or a National Curse? late in 1852. He presided over a number of important trials including the robbers of gold from the barque Nelson in Hobson's Bay in 1852, but growing disillusion with the state of society in Victoria saw him leave for England with his family in February 1853. He wrote a number of books, including several volumes of his poetry, and a manual for magistrates of the Court of Petty Sessions, the predecessor of the Magistrates Court of Victoria.E. Morris Miller & Frederick T. Macartney, Australian Literature, Angus and Robertson, Sydney, 1956, p.28. Family √Ä Beckett married firstly Emily Hayley in 1832. She died on 1 June 1841 and he married secondly Matilda Hayley, her sister, in 1849. He had 13 children with his two wives. √Ä Beckett died in London on 27 June 1869 and was buried in West Norwood Cemetery. He was survived by four sons. One, William, (1833-1901) married Emma Mills (1838-1906), the daughter of John Mills, a freed convict from Tasmania who founded brewing in Melbourne. Their daughter Emma Minnie Boyd, whose pursuit was painting, married another of the same pursuit, Arthur Merric Boyd, and there began extended generations of artists in Australian cultural life, collectively the Boyd family. Sir William's nephew Thomas √† Beckett, son of his brother Thomas, was also a puisne judge in Australia.

In May 1979, he was found guilty and sentenced to 25 to 50 years' imprisonment for rape, and another 25 to 50 years for aggravated kidnapping, the terms to be served concurrently. This conviction was upheld by the appellate court in 1981. In 1985, the accusing witness recanted her testimony, which had been the main evidence against Dotson. He was not exonerated or pardoned at that time, but due to popular belief that he was a victim of a false rape accusation, Dotson went through a series of paroles and re-incarcerations until DNA evidence proved his innocence in 1988. Dotson was subsequently cleared of his conviction. Personal background Gary E.

After his first release from prison in 1985, Dotson married Camille Dardanes, a woman who had come to know him during the hearings following his conviction. In March 1986, under difficult financial circumstances, the couple moved in with Dotson's mother. In January, 1987, they had a daughter, Ashley.

Alleged crime At the time, sixteen-year-old Cathleen Crowell Webb made up a rape allegation to explain to her foster parents her pregnancy concerns so she could obtain contraception after having had consensual sex with her boyfriend the previous day. After her 1985 recantation, she described herself as an \\"emotionally disturbed\\" foster child and revealed that she had been sexually active since the age of 12.Shipp, E.R. \\"Forgive,\\" asks woman in rape disavowal, November 28, 1985, New York Times.

Crowell later admitted her fabrication was based on a scene from a 1974 best-selling bodice ripper romance novel, Sweet Savage Love.Rogers, Rosemary. Sweet Savage Love. Avon: 1974. ASIN B000CBMW4Y The hoax began the night of July 9, 1977, when a police officer happened upon her standing beside a road not far from the shopping mall in the Chicago suburb of Homewood, where she lived and where she worked in a Long John Silver's seafood restaurant. Her clothing was dirt- stained and in disarray. Crowell tearfully told the officer that, as she walked across the mall parking lot after work, a car with three young men in it ran towards her. Two of the men jumped out, grabbed her, and threw her into the backseat. One of them climbed in beside her, and the other joined the driver in the front. The man in the back tore her clothes, raped her, and scratched several letters onto her stomach with a broken beer bottle. Crowell was taken to South Suburban Hospital, where a rape examination was performed. She identified Gary Dotson, according to her, under pressure from police based on the resemblance of his mug shot in the mug book to the composite sketch of an assailant she described. Even though there was no sign on Dotson of the scratches Crowell claimed she inflicted on her assailant and, unlike the smooth-shaven assailant Crowell described, Dotson had a mature mustache, he was arrested. Recantation By 1981, Crowell Webb had become deeply religious. In 1982, Crowell married a high school classmate, David Webb, and they moved to New Hampshire. In 1985 she confessed to her pastor what she had done, but when she tried with his assistance to correct what she had done the prosecutors would not take action. Dotson sought post-judgment relief based on Crowell Webb's recantation, but the trial court found her recantation to be unbelievable and refused to free him. The lawyer next contacted the media (leading to the \\"How about a hug?\\" moment during CBS Morning Show from anchor Phyllis George). The resulting public sympathy caused the original trial judge Richard L. Samuels to release Dotson on $100,000 bond pending a hearing one week later. At that hearing, Judge Samuels rejected new evidence discrediting the forensic evidence given at the trial, called the recantation less credible than the original testimony and sent Dotson back to prison. Dotson's attorney also petitioned the Governor of Illinois, James R. Thompson, for clemency on April 19. \\"Big Jim\\" Thompson, formerly a federal prosecutor, responded to the media attention by declaring that he personally would oversee three days of public hearings on Crowell Webb's recantation. The hearings lasted three days, from May 10 through May 12, 1985. Twenty-four witnesses were called to testify at the just-opened new State of Illinois Center in Chicago which Thompson had built, and which is now named after him. The sexually graphic proceedings were televised, creating a nationwide crime drama at a time when cameras in the courtroom were unheard of. Viewers were shocked when a \\"gigantic\\" projection of Crowell Webb's stained underwear was projected onto a massive screen on the wall, and when she and her boyfriend recited details of their sexual activity.Roeper, Richard.

CBS News. Accessed October 12, 2009. Exoneration On August 15, 1988, Governor Thompson and the prosecutors were notified that DNA testing had positively excluded Dotson and positively included Crowell's then-boyfriend, David Bierne, as the source of the semen stain. Nevertheless, the governor stated he would not act without receiving a recommendation from the Prisoner Review Board, which then failed to consider it. The media took up Dotson's case. In May 1989, his lawyer filed a new petition for post-conviction relief, which was accepted for hearing on August 14, 1989. The prosecutors publicly vowed to oppose the petition but later joined the judge in dismissing the original conviction and dropping all charges at the August 14 hearing. Dotson was officially pardoned by Illinois Governor George Ryan in 2002.Quintanilla, Ray. CATHLEEN CROWELL WEBB: Figure in rape case helped free inmate. May 21, 2008, Chicago Tribune. Accessed via NewsBank Archives October 23, 2009. Aftermath In 1985 Crowell co-wrote a book about the incident called Forgive Me and gave Dotson more than $17,000 in proceeds from its sale, keeping nothing for herself except the taxes due on that payment. In return, Dotson promised not to sue her over her false accusation. Dotson used the money to finance the start of his post-prison life, including a trip to Las Vegas to marry Dardanes. In 1985, Dotson had planned to write his own book with New York City author Jeannie Ralston. If written, the book was not published. By April 1989, Dardanes filed for separation. By fall of 1989, Dotson was working part-time as a construction worker in Illinois and was hoping to register for college classes to become a counselor. Dotson underwent treatment for alcoholism after his release. After their 1989 divorce, Dardanes and their daughter moved to Las Vegas, near Dardanes' mother, Barbara Kritzalis. By the time Dotson was cleared in 1989, Dotson's accuser Cathleen Crowell Webb had four children and had permanently made her home in New Hampshire, where her husband then worked as a welder and ironworker. Crowell died of breast cancer on May 15, 2008, six years after diagnosis. She had been working part-time as a receptionist at a religious grammar school and as a helper at a local golf course.Cathleen Crowell Webb dies at 46 Chicago Tribune May 20, 2008 After her death, her husband David told the press how she felt about recanting: > Once she got saved [in 1981] and came to terms with what she had done to > Gary's life, she made the decision to come forward.

Using the slogan \\"Adventures in Fantasy Literature,\\" Black Gate primarily featured original short fiction up to novella length. In addition to fiction, Black Gate also featured reviews of fantasy novels, graphic novels, and role playing game products. This was supplemented by columns and articles reflecting on fantasy literature's past as well as the occasional interview. Every issue contained the comic Knights of the Dinner Table: Java Joint by Kenzer & Company of Knights of the Dinner Table fame. Much of the fiction was by lesser known or new authors, but noted contributors have included Michael Moorcock, Mike Resnick, Charles de Lint and Cory Doctorow. As a semi-regular feature, Black Gate reprinted rare adventure stories from earlier decades or work from more recent years that the editors feel has been neglected. For instance, issues featured serialized Tumithak novels from Charles R. Tanner. While officially a quarterly publication, it was never produced on a reliable schedule. Its 15th and (to date) final issue was published in 2011. Critical response On its debut, Black Gate received strong reviews in Locus and elsewhere, many citing the sheer size of the issues (usually 200+ pages) and the high production values. This has proved quite ambitious, though. Various production problems have led to publication less frequent than the intended quarterly schedule. While John O'Neill made a public commitment to readers and advertisers to get production back on track, the magazine never achieved a reliable quarterly release.

It also proposed for the Joint Electorates with reservation of seats for minorities in the legislatures. It was prepared by a committee of the All Parties Conference chaired by Motilal Nehru with his son Jawaharlal Nehru acting as a secretary. There were nine other members in this committee. The final report was signed by Motilal Nehru and Jawaharlal Nehru, Ali Imam, Tej Bahadur Sapru, Madhav Shrihari Aney, Mangal Singh, Shuaib Qureshi, Subhas Chandra Bose, and G. R. Pradhan. Background British policy, until almost the end of the Raj, was that the timing and nature of Indian constitutional development was to be decided exclusively by the British Parliament, but it was assumed that Indians would be consulted as appropriate. This was formally stated in the Government of India Act 1919. Britain did not acknowledge the right of Indians to frame their own constitution until the 1942 Cripps Declaration. A nonofficial effort to ... (to draft a new constitution was) made by Mrs. Besant and a few of her Indian friends. Most of the leaders were rather cool toward her project, but it was somewhat revised by a so-called All-Parties Conference which met at Delhi in January‚ÄìFebruary, 1925, and was formally approved by a convention held at Cawnpore in April. It was drafted as a statute and introduced in the House of Commons by Mr. George Lansbury, December 9, 1925, under the title, \\"The Commonwealth of India Bill.\\" The bill proposed to confer upon India at once the full status of a Dominion, subject to certain temporary reservations. The Viceroy, as the representative of the King-Emperor, was to have complete charge of military and naval forces and foreign relations until the Indian Parliament by its own act should signify its readiness to assume control. Any step taken by the Indian Parliament concerning the Indian States must have the previous approval of the Viceroy. There was a Bill of Rights which included, among other things, guarantees of personal liberty, freedom of conscience, freedom of speech, and equality of gender. this scheme did not arouse any popular enthusiasm, partly perhaps because it was not really an Indian product, but mainly because of the negative character of the Nationalist movement. The leaders were more interested in opposing the existing system than they were in preparing a constructive alternative. In November 1927, the British government appointed the Simon Commission to review the working of the Government of India Act 1919 and propose constitutional reforms for India. The Commission did not have a single Indian member which irked leaders of the nationalist movement. While the British acknowledged the discontent, it did not consider making changes to the composition of the Commission; it instead asked Indians to prove that they could draw up a constitution themselves. A similar challenge was made in 1925 by Lord Birkenhead, Secretary of State for India, in the House of Lords: Leaders of the nationalist movement responded to the challenge by drafting the Nehru Report. In December 1927, at its Madras session, the Indian National Congress, took two major decisions in response to the setting up the Simon Commission: first, it decided to not cooperate with the Commission; second, it set up an All Parties Conference to draft a Constitution for India. The Report The constitution outlined by the Nehru Report was for Indian enjoying dominion status within the British Commonwealth. Some of the important elements of the report: Element of Nehru report... * Unlike the eventual Government of India Act 1935 it contained a Bill of Rights. * All power of government and all authority - legislative, executive and judicial - are derived from the people and the same shall be exercised through organisations established by, or under, and in accord with, this Constitution. * There shall be no state religion; men and women shall have equal rights as citizens. * There should be federal form of government with residuary powers vested in the centre.(Some scholars, such as Moore 1988 considered the Nehru Report proposal as essentially unitary rather than federal); * It included a description of the machinery of government including a proposal for the creation of a Supreme Court and a suggestion that the provinces should be linguistically determined. * It did not provide for separate electorates for any community or weightage for minorities. Both of these were liberally provided in the eventual Government of India Act 1935. However, it did allow for the reservation of minority seats in provinces having a minorities of at least ten percent, but this was to be in strict proportion to the size of the community. * The language of the Union shall be Indian, which may be written either in Devanagari (Hindi/Sanskrit), Telugu, Kannada, Marathi, Gujarati, Bengali or Tamil in character. The use of the English language shall be permitted. The Nehru Report, along with that of the Simon Commission was available to participants in the three Indian Round Table Conferences (1930‚Äì1932). However, the Government of India Act 1935 owes much to the Simon Commission report and little, if anything to the Nehru Report. Muslim League's reaction to the Nehru Report With few exceptions League leaders rejected the Nehru proposals. In reaction Mohammad Ali Jinnah drafted his Fourteen Points in 1929 which became the core demands the Muslim community put forward as the price of their participating in an independent united India. Their main objections were: * Separate electorates and weightage ‚Äî the 1916 Congress-Muslim League agreement Lucknow Pact provided these to the Muslim community whereas they were rejected by the Nehru Report. * Residuary powers ‚Äî the Muslims realized that while they would be a majority in the provinces of the North-East and North-West of India, and hence would control their provincial legislatures, they would always be a minority at the Centre. Thus they demanded, contra the Nehru Report, that residuary powers go to the provinces. According to Mohammad Ali Jinnah, ‚ÄúThe Committee has adopted a narrow minded policy to ruin the political future of the Muslims. I regret to declare that the report is extremely ambiguous and does not deserve to be implemented.‚Äù  Reception  R. Coupland in The Constitutional Problem in India saw the Report as the \\"frankest attempt yet made by Indians to face squarely the difficulties of communalism...\\" and found its objective of claiming dominion status as remarkable. However, he argued that the Report \\"had little practical result\\". Granville Austin in India‚Äôs Constitution: Cornerstone of a Nation, highlighted that the fundamental rights section of the Nehru Report was \\"a close precursor of the Fundamental Rights of the Constitution [of India, 1950]‚Ä¶10 of the 19 subclauses re-appear, materially unchanged, and three of the Nehru rights are included in the Directive Principles\\". Neera Chandhoke‚Äôs in her chapter in The Indian Constituent Assembly (edited) argued that \\"the inclusion of social and cultural rights in a predominantly liberal constitution appears extraordinary\\". Niraja Jayal in Citizenship and Its Discontents suggested that the Nehru Report, in the context of the international discourse of rights around the late 1920s, was a \\"rather exceptional document in its early envisioning of social and economic rights\\".

The festival highlights traditional Swiss culture and features competitions of Steinstossen (stone throwing), Schwingen (wrestling) and yodeling. The stone throwing competition uses an stone known as the Unspunnenstein (\\"Unspunnen Stone\\"), made of Aare granite from the Hasli valley. History The history of the festival dates back to the 13th century, in the meadows of Unspunnen Castle, when local lord Burkard von Unspunnen and the founder of the city of Bern, Berchtold V von Z√§hringen were able to reconcile their differences. The first official festival was held on 17 August 1805, in a similar effort: Napoleon had just invaded Switzerland, and the event was seen as a way of unifying the nation. Furthermore, the people of the Bernese Oberland had formed a separate canton in the Helvetic Republic, leading the Mayor of Bern, Niklaus Friedrich von M√ºlinen and Interlaken's chief magistrate, Franz Ludwig Thormann (and others) to organize this festival in an effort to bring both sides together. It was, unfortunately, not very successful in that regard, and conflicts continue to exist between rural and urban dwellers today. Culturally and financially, however, the first two festivals were a great success. The Swiss Heritage Society and the Swiss Traditional Costume Association owe their origins to the Unspunnen Festival. A second competition was held in 1808, but the original stone was lost in the intervening years, and the 1808 festival used a stone. The third festival was not organized until the centenary in 1905, using the 1808 stone, now with the dates 1805 and 1905 carved into it. However, it wasn't until 1946 that the festival, then known as the Swiss Traditional Costume and Cowherd's Festival, was held at regular intervals. After 1946, the Unspunnenfest was staged at regular intervals: 1955, 1968, 1981 and 1993. Modern times In 1984, the 1808 stone was stolen by members of the Belier Group (Jura separatists) from Unterseen museum on Sunday 3 June 1984, and held as a \\"political hostage\\". A new stone was found, this one weighing , similar to the 1805 stone, and has been used in all competitions since. This stone can currently be found in the counter hall of Interlaken UBS Bank. In 1999, a photographer was led to a private residence in Brussels, where he was shown what was claimed to be the 1808 Unspunnenstein. He took photographs as evidence, which members of the Interlaken Gymnastic Club, who had commissioned the 1984 replacement stone, identified as authentic. The stone was delivered mysteriously to Shawne Fielding-Borer (American-born wife of the then Swiss ambassador to Berlin), packaged as confectionery, at a festival held in the village of Saignel√©gier, in the canton of Jura in August 2000. However, the stone had been damaged. Unhappy with the result of the Swiss national referendum in 1992, in which the Swiss population decided against participation to the European Economic Area (EEA), the Belier Group had engraved twelve stars in the stone, symbolising the European Union, as well as the date of the referendum, 6 December 1992, and their own emblem. As a result, the stone lost in weight, and could no longer be used for competitions. The 1808 stone was once again stolen on 20 August 2005 from a hotel in Interlaken. A small stone was left behind by the thieves bearing the emblem of Jura. The French-speaking separatists did not claim responsibility this time, but did issue a statement in support of the theft. Its whereabouts remain unknown. Excessive flooding caused the next installment of Unspunnenfest to be postponed by a full year; it was finally held in September 2006. The winner of the stone throwing competition threw the Unspunnenstein a distance of . The most recent competition took place in 2017, and the next is scheduled for 2029.

It is one of approximately 600 species in the family Burseraceae. Pili are native to maritime Southeast Asia, Papua New Guinea, and Northern Australia. They are commercially cultivated in the Philippines for their edible nuts. Description The pili tree is an attractive, symmetrically-shaped evergreen, averaging tall with resinous wood and resistance to strong winds. It is dioecious, with flowers borne on cymose inflorescence at the leaf axils of young shoots. As in papaya and rambutan, functional hermaphrodites exist in pili. Pollination is by insects. Flowering of pili is frequent and fruits ripen through a prolonged period of time. The ovary contains three locules, each with two ovules; most of the time only one ovule develops.Chandler, W. H. 1958. Evergreen orchards. Lea & Febiger, Philadelphia. The pili fruit is a drupe, long, in diameter, and weighs . The skin (exocarp) is smooth, thin, shiny, and turns purplish black when the fruit ripens; the pulp (mesocarp) is fibrous, fleshy, and greenish yellow in color, and the hard shell (endocarp) within protects a normally dicotyledonous embryo. The basal end of the shell (endocarp) is pointed and the apical end is more or less blunt; between the seed and the hard shell (endocarp) is a thin, brownish, fibrous seed coat developed from the inner layer of the endocarp. This thin coat usually adheres tightly to the shell and/or the seed. Much of the kernel weight is made up of the cotyledons, which are about 4.1 to 16.6% of the whole fruit; it is composed of approximately 8% carbohydrate, 11.5 to 13.9% protein, and 70% fat. Kernels from some trees may be bitter, fibrous or have a turpentine odor. Distribution and habitat Pili is native to regions which include maritime Southeast Asia (Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines), Papua New Guinea, and Northern Australia. Pili is a tropical tree preferring deep, fertile, well drained soil, warm temperatures, and well distributed rainfall. It cannot tolerate the slightest frost or low temperature. Refrigeration of seeds at resulted in loss of viability after 5 days. Seed germination is highly recalcitrant, reduced from 98 to 19% after 12 weeks of storage at room temperature; seeds stored for more than 137 days did not germinate. Asexual propagations using marcotting, budding, and grafting were too inconsistent to be used in commercial production. Young shoots of pili were believed to have functional internal phloems, which rendered bark ringing ineffective as a way of building up carbohydrate levels in the wood. Success in marcottage may be cultivar-dependent. The production standard for a mature pili tree is between of in-shell nut, with the harvest season from May to October and peaking between June and August. There are high variations in kernel qualities and production between seedling trees. Most pili kernels tend to stick to the shell when fresh, but come off easily after being dried to 3 to 5% moisture ( for 27 to 28 h). Shelled nuts, with a moisture content of 2.5 to 4.6%, can be stored in the shade for one year without deterioration of quality.Coronel, R. E., J. C. Zuno, and R. C. Sotto. 1983. Promising fruits of the Philippines, p. 325‚Äì350. Univ. Philippines at Los Banos, College of Agr., Laguna. Cultivation and uses Candied pili nuts from Camarines Sur province, Philippines Pili brittle, made from Canarium ovatum nuts, sugar, and margarine. Although they are grown as ornamental trees in many areas of the Old World tropics of Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines, Indonesia and the Philippines harvest and use it commercially. However, the latter's natives were believed to be the first to cultivate the aforesaid nut by boiling the pulp to make them edible. It is also sold commercially in the United States of America under the Pili Hunters Brand. In Indonesia, it's mostly produced in the East. In the Philippines, production centers are located in the Bicol region, provinces of Sorsogon, Albay, and Camarines Sur, southern Tagalog, and eastern Visayas. The species is considered a flagship commodity of the Bicol region, the primary location of the pili nut trade. There is almost no commercial planting of this crop; fruits are collected from natural stands in the mountains near these provinces. In 1977, the Philippines exported approximately 3.8 t of pili preparation to Guam and Australia. The most important product from pili is the kernel. When raw, its flavor resembles that of roasted pumpkin seed, and when roasted, its nutty flavor and waxy texture make it similar to the pine nut. Research from the Institute of Plant Breeding, University of the Philippines at Los Banos, describes pili nuts of high quality as large, round kernel, and a thin pulp and shell. The contents should have a white pulp, high in protein and oils with mild nutty flavor. In the Philippines, pili is used in candies and brittle. In Indonesia, especially in Minahasa and Moluccas islands, the kernels are used for making cake, bobengka in Minahasan or bubengka in Maluku. Pili kernel is also used in chocolate, ice cream, and baked goods. The largest buyers of pili nuts are in Hong Kong and Taiwan; the kernel is one of the major ingredients in one type of the famous Chinese festive desserts known as the \\"moon cake\\". Nutritionally, the kernel is high in manganese, calcium, phosphorus, and potassium, and rich in fats and protein. It yields a light yellowish oil, mainly of glycerides of oleic (44.4 to 59.6%) and palmitic acids (32.6 to 38.2%). The young shoots and the fruit pulp are edible. The shoots are used in salads, and the pulp is eaten after it is boiled and seasoned. Boiled pili pulp resembles the sweet potato in texture; it is oily (about 12%) and is considered to have food value similar to the avocado. Pulp oil can be extracted and used for cooking or as a substitute for cottonseed oil in the manufacture of soap and edible products. The stony shells are excellent as fuel or as porous, inert growth media for orchids and anthurium. The tree's sap is also used for igniting fire, substituting for gasoline. Fresh saps were gathered from slashed tree trunk or shallow cuts, then gathered before it dries up completely.  Propagation  Pili can be propagated by seed, marcotting, patch budding, cleft grafting, air layering, and inarching.Coronel, R. E. (2000, November). Collection, propagation and conservation of indigenous fruits in the Philippines. In International Symposium on Tropical and Subtropical Fruits 575 (pp. 211-219). Germination by seed takes about 30 to 80 days, and in about three to four years, the sapling can reach a juvenile height of about 2 meters.Coronel, R. E. (1994). History and current status of pili nut (Canarium ovatum) production in the Philippines. South Pacific Indigenous Nuts, 134. The trees are expected to start fruiting after 5 to 6 years from seedlings, reaching economic yield in the 10th year. Though propagation by seedlings is most common, asexual propagation is becoming preferred, for production of more female plants, removal of the juvenile period, and uniformity of the genetics,Coronel, R. E. (1996). Pili nut, Canarium ovatum Engl (Vol. 6). Bioversity International. though to preserve genetic variability, seedlings are still created by sexual reproduction. Marcotting and air layering are the simplest of asexual propagation methods for pili, though success can range from 0 to 100%. This issue comes from the branch unsuccessfully rooting after severing from the mother tree. Commercially, in the Philippines, cleft or wedge grafting with defoliated budsticks is used with rootstocks in large containers or directly in the field during the months between November and February, when the weather is cool and dry. This has an average success rate of 85%. Patch budding is found to be the most efficient for large-scale propagation work. Similarly to cleft or wedge grafting, the rootstocks are well watered and fertilized and the defoliated budwoods are cultivated from young, actively growing trees. This is also done in the months between November and February in the Philippines, having a success rate as high as 75 to 80%. =Future prospects= The immediate concern in pili production is the difficulty of propagation. The lack of an effective clonal propagation method not only hampers the collection of superior germplasm but also makes it almost impossible to conduct feasibility trials of this crop. Pili cultivars such as 'Red', 'Albay', and 'Katutubo' were selected in the Philippines. The Department of Agriculture has been working to synthesize a tree that is commercially viable. The National Clonal Germplasm Repository at Hilo, USDA- ARS, has initiated studies of in vitro and vegetative propagation for the multiplication and long-term preservation of pili. A recently released pili cultivar in Hawaii, 'Poamoho', may further stimulate the interest in this crop. Besides the desirable production and quality attributes, its kernels separate easily from the hard shell without the need of prior drying ( for 27 to 28 hours).

She was known as Elizabeth Zubilin while serving in the United States, and also known as Elizaveta Gorskaya. Born in Rzhavyntsi, in the Khotinsky Uyezd of the Bessarabia Governorate of the Russian Empire (present-day Ukraine) to a Jewish family (father Yoel, mother Ita). She studied history and philology at universities in Romania, France, and Austria, and spoke in English, French, German, Romanian, Russian and Yiddish. She was one of the most successful agent recruiters, establishing her own illegal network of Jewish migrants from Poland, and recruiting one of Le√≥ Szil√°rd's secretaries, who provided technical data. She was the wife of Soviet Intelligence Resident Vasily Zarubin. Zarubina was an active participant in the revolutionary movement in Bessarabia after World War I. In 1919, she became a member of the Komsomol of Bessarabia. Elizabeth became part of the Soviet intelligence system in 1924. In 1923, she joined the ranks of the Austrian Communist Party. From 1924 through 1925, she worked in the embassy and trade delegation of the USSR. From 1925 to 1928, she worked in the Vienna Rezidentura. In 1929, Elizabeth and Yakov Blumkin were posted as illegals in Turkey, where he sold Hasidic manuscripts from the Central Library in Moscow to support illegal operations in Turkey and the Middle East. Soviet intelligence officer Pavel Sudoplatov, who later organized Leon Trotsky's murder, claims in his autobiography that Blumkin gave part of the sale proceeds to Trotsky, who was then in exile in Turkey.Pavel Sudoplatov, Anatoli Sudoplatov, Jerrold L. Schecter, Leona P. Schecter, Special Tasks: The Memoirs of an Unwanted Witness -- A Soviet Spymaster (Little Brown, Boston, 1994), p. 189. According to his account, Elizabeth denounced Blumkin for this and that was the reason why he was recalled to Moscow and executed. Shortly thereafter (1929), Eizabeth married Vasily Zarubin, and they traveled and spied together for many years, using the cover of a Czechoslovakian and USA business couple for work in Denmark, Germany, France and the United States. In August 1942, Paul Massing notified NKVD that his friend, Franz Neumann, had recently joined the Office of Strategic Services (OSS). Massing reported to Moscow that Neumann had told him that he had produced a study of the Soviet economy for the OSS's Russian Department. In April 1943, Elizabeth Zarubina met with Neumann: \\"(Zarubina) met for the first time with (Neumann) who promised to pass us all the data coming through his hands. According to (Neumann), he is getting many copies of reports from American ambassadors... and has access to materials referring to Germany\\". According to Jerrold L. Schecter and Leona Schecter, Zarubina was \\"one of the most successful operators in stealing atomic bomb secrets from the United States\\". Together with Gregory Kheifetz (the Soviet vice-consul in San Francisco from 1941 to 1944), she supposedly set up a ring of young communist physicists around Robert Oppenheimer at Los Alamos to transmit nuclear weapon plans to Moscow.Schecter and Schecter (2002), p. 79 This part of Zarubina‚Äôs life as a spy is told in the 2015 video, ‚ÄúCold War Secrets: Stealing the Atomic Bomb,‚Äù directed by Gerard Puechmorel.

The river is joined by the Ghudara river just below Sarez Lake. From the junction the river is known as the Bartang. The Bartang traces a route down the western Pamir Mountains, flowing before becoming a tributary to the Panj at the border of Tajikistan and Afghanistan. Much of the river lies within the boundaries of Tajik National Park. The Bartang is fed mostly by glacier and snow melt. It is the only river to cross Gorno-Badakhshan from east to west. The Bartang- Murghab-Aksu crosses Gorno-Badikhstan from east to west The Bartang from space The Bartang enters the Panj just upstream from the town of Rushon. Access 'Bartang' means 'narrow passage'. Before the 20th century travel required fords, ladders and platforms set into the sides of cliffs. There were three paths, one along the river, usable only in autumn when the water was low, the second along the cliffs and the third, much longer, where pack animals could be led along the mountain ridges. The modern road can become impassable beyond Basid due to rockslides. Above Basid is the large village of Roshov. Above that the Ghudara River and the Murghab Rivers join to form the Bartang. The road follows the Ghudata northeast to its junction with the Tanimas which leads west to the Fedchenko Glacier. A road of sorts continues east to lake Karakul. The Murghab is generally not passable except as an adventure. There is a dirt road for the last 37 km to Murghab town. Above Murghab a jeep road, of decreasing quality, follows the river southeast to Tokhtamish and Shaimak. Sarez Lake On February 18, 1911, the 1911 Sarez earthquake, estimated at 7.4 on the Richter magnitude scale, caused a large landslide which completely blocked the flow of the Murghab and buried a local village. The landslide, estimated at two cubic kilometers of rock, formed a natural dam called the Usoi Dam. Over the following months the Murghab filled the space behind the Usoi to form Sarez Lake, which now fills about 60 kilometers in length of the Murghab river valley and contains 17 cubic kilometers of water. Geologists believe that the dam may be unstable and could collapse during a future strong earthquake, either from structural failure of the earthen dam itself or liquefaction of the soil & rock debris making up the dam.Bolt, B.A., W.L.

The river is in length with a catchment area of . The Queanbeyan River and the Cotter River meet the potable water supply needs of the Canberra and Queanbeyan region and whose water quality is specifically protected under Federal legislation. It is believed that the local Aboriginal Ngarigo people used a word that sounded like queanbeyan to describe the river, said to mean \\"clearwater\\". River course The headwaters of the Queanbeyan River rise east-southeast of Queanbeyan and about northeast of the township of Bredbo, near the village of Jerangle. Fourteen tributaries upstream of the Googong Dam contribute to the river flow including the Burra, Urialla, Tinderry, Ballinafad, Groggy, Woolpack, Sherlock, Lyons, Towneys and Mile Creeks. The major river crossings above Googong Dam are the Boolboolma causeway on the Tinderry Road and a road bridge on the Captain's Flat-Jerangle Road. Once inside the city precinct of Queanbeyan, the river is crossed by several bridges, including the Canberra-Goulburn railway, Morisset Street bridge, the Queens Bridge on Monaro Street (which becomes Bungendore Road or Kings Highway), and by a pedestrian footbridge near Isabella Street in East Queanbeyan. Queens Bridge was opened by Wal Fife MP, Minister for Transport and Highways on the 21 July 1975, according to a plaque on the bridge. The Queanbeyan River meets the Molonglo River at a confluence located in Oaks Estate, within the boundary of the Australian Capital Territory. The river descends over its course. The river's catchment area is , more than double that of the Cotter River. =Damming= Googong Dam spillway and dam wall The Queanbeyan Weir was constructed originally in 1901-2 which provided a pool in the Queanbeyan River near the centre of the town for the town's water supply. It is now a place for town beautification with several parks located along the river, such as Blundell Park, Queen Elizabeth Park, and Ray Morton Park. The weir also provides for minor irrigation requirements. A buttressed concrete gravity wall which was long, raised an extra to the height of in 1951-1952. The weir has had serious impacts on native fish migration in the Queanbeyan River. Googong Dam The Googong Dam is located upstream of the town of Queanbeyan. The dam was completed in 1979 and has a maximum carrying capacity of . The Commonwealth Government owns the dam, which is operated by ACTEW Corporation, the water utility provider, that is an ACT government-owned corporation. ACTEW also manages the dam foreshores. Lower flows in the river downstream of the dam since its construction, together with below average rainfall for the past decade, have modified the river channel and led to an increase in colonisation by willows and river plants which enjoy low flows. Management of the river includes eradication of these weeds. History The Queanbeyan region is the traditional home of the Ngunnawal and the Ngarigo peoples. The first Europeans visitors to the area were led by Charles Throsby. While searching for the Murrumbidgee River in 1820, his party followed the course of the Queanbeyan River into a valley at the eastern end of the Limestone Plains near present-day Canberra. The Queanbeyan River was the main water supply for the towns of Queanbeyan and during its early history it was an integral element to its economy. Wool scouring (cleaning) was carried out in the river near presentday Oaks Estate, formerly a part of Queanbeyan. =Flooding= The first significant flood after European settlement of the site of Queanbeyan City was in 1851: others followed twice in 1852, twice in 1861, twice in 1870, 1891, 1910, 1922, 1925, 1952, 1974, 1975 and 1976.Cross, R. ‚ÄòQueanbeyan Flood Record Over 106 Years‚Äô, Queanbeyan Age, 21 June 1978, p. 19 A timeline compiled by a member of the Queanbeyan and District Historical Museum Society gives similar dates, extending to 2012.https://queanbeyanmuseum.org.au/queanbeyans-timeline/ It is yet to be updated to record another 6-metre (19.7 feet) flood on 6 June 2016.T√ºndern- Smith, A. Canberra History News, December 2016, pp 1-2. During the 1976 flood the half completed Googong Dam was at risk of collapse under the weight of water behind it. In this eventuality low lying parts of Queanbeyan and Canberra would have been inundated. The Queanbeyan Cemetery was flooded, with scores of bodies washed downstream into Lake Burley Griffin. In December 2010 the Queanbeyan River peaked at and broke its banks, flooding the Queanbeyan Riverside tourist park. All schools in the area were closed and some local schools were used as shelter for evacuated residents of around 100 houses and businesses. Following extensive rains in the catchment, in March 2012 there were flooding alerts, however the river did not breach its banks. Fishing A quiet stretch of the Queanbeyan River near the suspension footbridge, Queanbeyan. The Queanbeyan River was renowned as a beautiful river abounding in native Murray Cod, which once extended to the vicinity of Googong Dam, and native Macquarie perch, which extended to at least the headwaters of Googong Dam. Due to this abundance of native fish, the Queanbeyan River, along with the Molonglo River, was often known as the \\"Fish River\\" in the early days of settlement. Sometimes the Queanbeyan River was further distinguished by being called the \\"South Fish River\\". On more than one occasion in the late 19th and early 20th centuries floods deposited live Murray Cod in the main streets of Queanbeyan. A variety of ills including introduction of exotic fish such as trout, overfishing, willow encroachment, siltation, and weirs blocking migration saw native fish populations in the Queanbeyan River close to extinction by the time Googong Dam was built. Water quality Under the , the Government of New South Wales guaranteed the Australian Capital Territory access to resources including water by protecting and not polluting the waters of the Queanbeyan River. The condition of the river as a native habitat below Googong Dam has been seen as unhealthy in recent years by the Queanbeyan City Council, with the river being overrun with carp and reeds. The Queanbeyan Council has put in place a resource development scheme to clean out the river, including a 'catch a carp' competition where the winners won $500 or fishing gear. European carp have not penetrated the river above Googong Dam, providing an excellent trout and native fish catchery in both the dam and the river upstream. Carp are present the entire length of the river, but in small quantities. Since construction of Googong Dam in 1979, the endangered Macquarie perch has been very occasionally reported in the reservoir, and rarely beyond the first waterfall upstream of Googong Dam, despite the introduction of 57 Macquarie perch in the 1980s. Other wildlife The Queanbeyan River has a range of native wildlife ranging from wombats and kangaroos which are often found grazing on the banks to the not commonly seen platypus. The area surrounding the Queanbeyan River supports a large population of Eastern grey Kangaroos. Platypus can be found during the evenings under the swing bridge.

The history of Washington includes thousands of years of Native American history before Europeans arrived and began to establish territorial claims. The region was part of Oregon Territory from 1848 to 1853, after which it was separated from Oregon and established as Washington Territory following the efforts at the Monticello Convention. In 1889, Washington became the 42nd state of the United States.  Prehistory and cultures  Archaeological evidence shows that the Pacific Northwest was one of the first populated areas in North America. Both animal and human bones dating back to 13,000 years old have been found across Washington and evidence of human habitation in the Olympic Peninsula dates back to approximately 9,000 BCE, 3,000 to 5,000 years after massive flooding of the Columbia River which carved the Columbia Gorge.Collier, Donald, Alfred Hudson, and Arlo Ford.. \\"Archaeology of the Upper Columbia Region\\". Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1942. Anthropologists estimate there were 125 distinct Northwest tribes and 50 languages and dialects in existence before the arrival of Euro- Americans in this region. Throughout the Puget Sound region, coastal tribes made use of the region's abundant natural resources, subsisting primarily on salmon, halibut, shellfish, and whale. Cedar was an important building material and was used by tribes to build both longhouses and large canoes. Clothing was also made from the bark of cedar trees. The Columbia River tribes became the richest of the Washington tribes through their control of Celilo Falls, historically the richest salmon fishing location in the Northwest. These falls on the Columbia River, east of present-day The Dalles, Oregon, were part of the path millions of salmon took to spawn. The presence of private wealth among the more aggressive coastal tribes encouraged gender divisions as women took on prominent roles as traders and men participated in warring and captive-taking with other tribes. The eastern tribes, called the Plateau tribes, survived through seasonal hunting, fishing, and gathering. Tribal work among the Plateau Indians was also gender-divided with both men and women responsible for equal parts of the food supply.Armitage, Susan. \\"Tied to Other Lives: Women in Pacific Northwest History.\\" Women in Pacific Northwest History. Ed. Karen J. Blair. Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1998. The principal tribes of the coastal areas include the Chinook, Lummi, Quinault, Makah, Quileute, and Snohomish. The Plateau tribes include the Klickitat, Cayuse, Nez Perc√©, Okanogan, Palouse, Spokane, Wenatchee, and Yakama. Today, Washington contains more than 20 Indian reservations, the largest of which is for the Yakama. At Ozette, in the northwest corner of the state, an ancient village was covered by a mud slide, perhaps triggered by an earthquake about 500 years ago. More than 50,000 well-preserved artifacts have been found and cataloged, many of which are now on display at the Makah Cultural and Research Center in Neah Bay. Other sites have also revealed how long people have been there. Thumbnail-sized quartz knife blades found at the Hoko River site near Clallam Bay are believed to be 2,500 years old. Colony =Early European and American exploration= The first European record of a landing on the Washington coast was in 1774 by Spaniard Juan P√©rez. One year later, Spanish Captain Don Bruna de Heceta on board the Santiago, part of a two-ship flotilla with the Sonora, landed near the mouth of the Quinault River and claimed the coastal lands up to the Russian possessions in the north. In 1778, the British explorer Captain James Cook sighted Cape Flattery, at the entrance to the Strait of Juan de Fuca. But the strait itself was not found until Charles William Barkley, captain of the Imperial Eagle, sighted it in 1787. Barkley named it for Juan de Fuca. The Spanish-British Nootka Conventions of the 1790s ended Spanish exclusivity and opened the Northwest Coast to explorers and traders from other nations, most important being Britain, Russia, and the United States. Further explorations of the straits were performed by Spanish explorers Manuel Quimper in 1790 and Francisco de Eliza in 1791 and then by British Captain George Vancouver in 1792. Captain Vancouver claimed the sound for Britain and named the waters south of the Tacoma Narrows Puget's Sound, in honor of Peter Puget, then a lieutenant accompanying him on the Vancouver Expedition. The name later came to be used for the waters north of Tacoma Narrows as well. Vancouver and his expedition mapped the coast of Washington from 1792 to 1794. Captain Robert Gray (for whom Grays Harbor County is named) discovered the mouth of the Columbia River in 1792, naming the river after his ship \\"Columbia\\" and later establishing a trade in sea otter pelts. The Lewis and Clark expedition, under the direction of President Thomas Jefferson, entered the state from the east on October 10, 1805. Meriwether Lewis and William Clark were surprised by the differences in Indian tribes in the Pacific Northwest from those they had encountered earlier in the expedition, noting, in particular, the increased status of women among both coastal and plateau tribes. Lewis hypothesized that the equality of women and the elderly with men was linked to more evenly distributed economic roles. Canadian explorer David Thompson extensively explored the Columbia River commencing in 1807. In 1811, he became the first European to navigate the entire length of the river to the Pacific. Along the way he posted a notice where it joins the Snake River claiming the land for Britain and stating the intention of the North West Company to build a fort there. Subsequently, Fort Nez Perces trading post, was established near present-day Walla Walla, Washington. Thompson's notice was found by Astorians looking to establish an inland fur post. It contributed to David Stuart's choice, on behalf of the American Pacific Fur Company, of a more northerly site for their operations at Fort Okanogan. Before settlement in the 1830s, when white women began moving to the territory, M√©tis women were sought after as wives for the traders. A population of M√©tis (mixed race) people grew as a result of centuries of sexual encounters between early European fur-traders and Indian women.Van Kirk, Sylvia. \\"The Role of Native Women in the Creation of Fur Trade Society in Western Canada, 1670-1830\\". Women in Pacific Northwest History. Ed. Karen J. Blair. Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1998. =American‚ÄìBritish occupation disputes= American interests in the region grew as part of the concept of manifest destiny. Spain ceded their rights north of the 42nd Parallel to the United States by the 1819 Adams-On√≠s Treaty, (but not possession, which was disallowed by the terms of the Nootka Conventions). Britain had long-standing commercial interests through the Hudson's Bay Company and a well-established network of fur trading forts along the Columbia River in what it called Columbia District. These were headquartered from Fort Vancouver in present-day Vancouver, Washington. By the Treaty of 1818, following from the War of 1812, Great Britain and the United States established the 49th parallel as the border west to the Continental Divide of the Rocky mountains; but agreed to joint control and occupancy of Oregon Country. In 1824, Russia signed an agreement with the U.S. acknowledging it had no claims south of 54-40 latitude north and Russia signed a similar treaty with Britain in 1825. Joint occupancy was renewed, but on a year-to-year basis in 1827. Eventually, increased tension between U.S. settlers arriving by the Oregon trail and fur traders led to the Oregon boundary dispute. On June 15, 1846, Britain ceded its claims to the lands south of the 49th parallel, and the U.S. ceded its claims to the north of the same line, in the present day Canada‚ÄìUS border, in the Oregon Treaty. In 1848, the Oregon Territory, composed of present-day Washington, Oregon, and Idaho as well as parts of Montana and Wyoming, was established. Washington Territory, which included Washington and pieces of Idaho and Montana, was formed from Oregon Territory in 1853. In 1872, An arbitration process settled the boundary dispute from the Pig War and established the US‚ÄìCanada border through the San Juan Islands and Gulf Islands. Early American Settlements =Eastern Washington= Settlements in the eastern part of the state were largely agricultural and focused around missionary establishments in the Walla Walla Valley. Missionaries attempted to 'civilize' the Indians, often in ways that disregarded or misunderstood native practices. When missionaries Dr. Marcus Whitman and Narcissa Whitman refused to leave their mission as racial tensions mounted in 1847, 13 American missionaries were killed by Cayuse and Umatilla Indians. Explanations of the 1847 Whitman massacre in Walla Walla include outbreaks of disease, resentment over harsh attempts at conversion of both religion and way of life, and contempt of the native Indians shown by the missionaries, particularly by Narcissa Whitman, the first white American woman in the Oregon Territory. This event triggered the Cayuse War against the Indians, followed by the Yakima War, together with continuing until 1858. The Provisional Legislature of Oregon in 1847 immediately raised companies of volunteers to go to war, if necessary, against the Cayuse, and, to the discontent of some of the militia leaders, also sent a peace commission. The United States Army later came to support the militia forces. These militia forces, eager for action, provoked both friendly and hostile Indians. In 1850, five Cayuse were convicted for murdering the Whitmans in 1847 and hanged. Sporadic bloodshed continued until 1855, when the Cayuse were decimated, defeated, bereft of their tribal lands, and placed on the Umatilla Indian Reservation in northeastern Oregon. The conflicts over the possession of land between the Indians and the 'American' settlers led the Americans in 1855, by the 'treaties' at the Walla Walla Council, to coerce not only the Cayuse, but also the Walla Walla and the Umatilla tribes, to the Umatilla Indian Reservation in northeastern Oregon; fourteen other tribal groups to the Yakama Indian Reservation in southern Washington State; and the Nez Perce to a reservation in the border region of Washington, Oregon and Idaho. That same year, gold was discovered in the newly established Yakama reservation and white miners encroached upon these lands. The tribes - first the Yakama, eventually joined by the Walla Walla and the Cayuse - united together to fight the Americans in what is called the Yakima War. The U.S. Army sent troops and a number of raids and battles took place. In 1858, the Americans, at the Battle of Four Lakes, defeated the Indians decisively. In a newly imposed 'treaty,' tribes were, again, confined to reservations. =Puget Sound= As American settlers moved west along the Oregon Trail, some traveled through the northern part of the Oregon Territory and settled in the Puget Sound area. The first settlement in the Puget Sound area in the west of what is now Washington State was Fort Nisqually, a farm and fur-trading post owned by the Puget's Sound Agricultural Company, a subsidiary of the Hudson's Bay Company. Washington's pioneer founder, Michael Simmons, along with the black pioneer George Washington Bush and his Caucasian wife, Isabella James Bush, from Missouri and Tennessee, respectively, led four white families into the territory and settled New Market, now known as Tumwater, in 1846. They settled in Washington to avoid Oregon's racist settlement laws. After them, many more settlers, migrating overland along the Oregon trail, wandered north to settle in the Puget Sound area. Contrasted with other American occupations of the West, there was comparatively little violence between settlers and Native Americans, though several exceptions, such as Territorial Governor Isaac Ingalls Stevens' extensive campaigns in 1853 to force Indians into ceding lands and rights, are notable:Ficken, Robert E. \\"Washington Territory.\\" Pullman: Washington State University Press, 2002. the Puget Sound War, Cayuse War, Yakima War, and Spokane War being the largest conflicts between the new American authorities and indigenous governments. Raids by Haida, Tlingit and other northern tribes from British and Russian territory terrorized Native Americans and settlers alike in Puget Sound in the 1850s (see Port Gamble). Miners bound for the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush in British Columbia in 1858 using the Okanagan Trail traveled underarms and there were many instances of violence along the route. Lumber industries drew settlers to the territory. Coastal cities, like Seattle (founded in 1851 and originally called \\"Duwamps\\"), were established. Unlike the wagon trains that had carried entire families to the Oregon Territory, these early trading settlements were populated primarily with single young men. Liquor, gambling, and prostitution were ubiquitous, supported in Seattle by one of the city's founders, David Swinson \\"Doc\\" Maynard, who believed that well-run prostitution could be a functional part of the economy. The Fraser Gold Rush in what would, as a result, become the Colony of British Columbia saw a flurry of settlement and merchant activity in northern Puget Sound which gave birth to Port Townsend and Whatcom (which became Bellingham) as commercial centres, at first attempting to rival Victoria as a disembarkation point of the goldfields until the colony's governor ordered that all access to the Fraser River go via Victoria. Despite the limitation on goldfield-related commerce, many men who left the \\"Fraser River Humbug\\", as the rush was for a while misunderstood to be, settled in Whatcom and Island counties. Some of these were settlers on San Juan Island during the Pig War of 1859. Upon the admission of the State of Oregon to the union in 1859, the eastern portions of the Oregon Territory, including southern Idaho, portions of Wyoming west of the continental divide (then Nebraska Territory), and a small portion of present-day Ravalli County, Montana were annexed to the Washington Territory. In 1863, the area of Washington Territory east of the Snake River and the 117th meridian west was reorganized as part of the newly created Idaho Territory, leaving that territory with only the lands within the current boundaries of the State of Washington. Statehood The Grand Coulee Dam was the largest dam in the world at the time of its construction After the passage of the Enabling Act of 1889, Washington became the 42nd state in the United States on November 11, 1889. The proposed state constitution, passed by a four-to-one ratio, originally included women's suffrage and prohibition, but both of these issues were defeated and removed from the accepted constitution. Women had previously been given the vote in 1883 by the Washington Territorial Legislature, but the right was rescinded in 1887 by the Washington Territorial Supreme Court as a response to female support of prohibition. Despite these initial defeats, women in the Pacific Northwest received the right to vote earlier than the rest of the country with Washington passing a suffrage amendment in 1910.Haarsager, Sandra. \\"Organized Womanhood: Cultural Politics in the Pacific Northwest, 1840-1920.\\" Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1997. Prohibition followed in 1916, two years before the rest of the nation. Early prominent industries in the state included agriculture, lumber, and mining. In eastern Washington, Spokane was a major hub of mining activity and the Yakima Valley was known for its apple orchards and wheat fields. The heavy rainfall to the west of the Cascade Range produced dense forests and the ports along Puget Sound prospered from the manufacturing and shipping of lumber products, particularly the Douglas fir. In 1905, Washington State became the largest producer of lumber in the nation.Kensel, W. Hudson. \\"The Early Spokane Lumber Industry, 1871-1910,\\" Idaho Yesterdays, Vol. 12, No. 1, Spring 1968. Seattle was the primary port for trade with Alaska and for a time possessed a large shipbuilding industry. Other industries that developed in Washington include fishing, salmon canning, and mining. For an extended period of time, Tacoma was known for its large smelters where gold, silver, copper and lead ores were treated. The region around eastern Puget Sound developed heavy industry during the period including World War I and World War II and the Boeing Company became an established icon in the area. Progressive Era The progressive force of the early 20th century in Washington stemmed partially from the women's club movement which offered opportunities for leadership and political power to tens of thousands of women in the Pacific Northwest region. 1920s Bertha Knight Landes was elected mayor of Seattle in 1926, the first woman mayor of a major city in the United States.Pieroth, Doris H. \\"The Woman Who Was Mayor.\\" Women in Pacific Northwest History. Ed. Karen J. Blair. Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1998. In 1924, Seattle's Sand Point Airfield was the endpoint of the first aerial circumnavigation of the world. Great Depression Vancouver became the endpoint for two ultra-long flights from Moscow, USSR over the North Pole. The first of these flights were performed by Valery Chkalov in 1937 on a Tupolev ANT-25RD airplane. Chkalov was originally scheduled to land at an airstrip in nearby Portland, Oregon but redirected at the last minute to Vancouver's Pearson Airfield. During the depression era, a series of hydroelectric dams were constructed along the Columbia River as part of a project to increase the production of electricity. This culminated in 1941 with the completion of the Grand Coulee Dam, the largest in the United States. World War II During World War II, the Puget Sound area became a focus for war industries with the Boeing Company producing many of the nation's heavy bombers and ports in Seattle, Bremerton, Vancouver, and Tacoma available for the manufacturing of ships for the war effort. As the demand for labor and the number of young men drafted increased simultaneously, women entered the workforce in great numbers, recruited by local media. One-fourth of the laborers in shipyards were women, resulting in the installation of one of the first government-funded child-care centers in the workplace.Skold, Karen Beck. \\"The Job He Left Behind: Women in the Shipyards During World War II.\\" Women in Pacific Northwest History. Ed. Karen J. Blair. Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1988. In eastern Washington, the Hanford Works nuclear power plant was opened in 1943 and played a major role in the construction of the nation's atomic bombs. One of the atomic bombs (nicknamed 'Fat Man' and dropped on Nagasaki, Japan on August 9, 1945) was fueled by Hanford plutonium and was transported in Boeing B-29s, also designed in Washington State. Contemporary Washington =Eruption of Mount St Helens= 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens On May 18, 1980, following a period of heavy tremors and eruptions, the northeast face of Mount St. Helens exploded outward, destroying a large part of the top of the volcano. This eruption flattened the forests for many miles, killed 57 people, flooded the Columbia River and its tributaries with ash and mud and blanketed large parts of Washington in ash, making day look like night. =Economy= Washington is well known for several prominent companies, the most notable of which are Microsoft, Amazon.com, Boeing, Nordstrom, The Bon March√©, Costco, and Starbucks. Monopolies have a long history in the state. Bill Boeing's namesake company grew from a small airplane company in 1916 to the national aircraft and airline conglomerate of Boeing and United Airlines, which was subsequently broken up by anti-trust regulators in 1934. =Politics= Politics in Washington have been generally Democratic since the 1950s and 60s and President John F. Kennedy's election. The state's system of blanket primaries, in which voters may vote for any candidate on the ballot and are not required to be affiliated with a particular political party, was ruled unconstitutional in 2003. The party-line primary system was instituted for the 2004 presidential and gubernatorial elections. In 2004, voters elected Governor Christine Gregoire into office, making Washington the first state to have a female governor and two female senators, Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell. Protests against the World Trade Organization (WTO) in Seattle, sometimes referred to as the \\"Battle of Seattle\\", took place in 1999 when the WTO convened to discuss trade negotiations. Massive protests of at least 40,000 people included organizations such as NGOs involved in environment issues, labor unions, student groups, religious groups, and anarchists. On January 30, 2006, Governor Christine Gregoire signed into law legislation making Washington the 17th state in the nation to protect gay and lesbian people from discrimination in housing, lending, and employment, and the 7th state in the nation to offer these protections to transgender people. Initiative activist Tim Eyman filed a referendum that same day, seeking to put the issue before the state's voters. In order to qualify for the November election, the measure required a minimum of 112,440 voter signatures by 5:00 p.m. June 6, 2006.

It is located on the southwestern fringe of the lagoon of North Mal√© Atoll. It was inhabited in the past by the community known as Giraavaru people (or Tivaru people). Historical and anthropological facts The Giraavaru islanders had certain customs of their own, the women, for example, used to wear distinctive white cloth patchwork bands on the neckpiece of their libaas dress (boavalhu) instead of the usual Maldivian golden or silvery thread designs. In 1968 the island was depopulated due to heavy erosion and reduction of the community to a few members. The Giravaru people were resettled in nearby Hulhule Island, at the eastern edge of the Male' Atoll lagoon. At the time of depopulation there were only a few coconut trees growing on Giraavaru and the water in the wells had become saline. When the airport at Hulhule was expanded they were relocated in the western end of Maafanu district in Mal√©. The Giravaru culture assimilated into the wider Mal√© society through inter-marriage after only about two generations. It is unlikely that the Giraavaru islanders were the only early settlers in the Maldives, as it is often claimed on the basis of myths and legends. From the anthropological point of view there were, and still are, other distinctive groups of people in the Maldives, like in Huvadhu Atoll for example, having their particular customs, manners and even speaking markedly different language forms. However, the Giraavaru islanders have attracted much more attention owing to their proximity to the capital. Mal√© islanders and the royal court were fascinated by the distinctiveness of the Giraavaru islanders for centuries and thus they became locally an iconic people group. References * H. C. P.

With a community (as of 2005) of more than 50 monks, with another five at Wechselburg, the Abbey is one of the largest Benedictine houses and is a major attraction for visitors. History =Middle Ages and Early Modern period= Church interior Ettal Abbey was founded on 28 April 1330, Saint Vitalis of Milan's day, by Emperor Ludwig the Bavarian in the Graswang valley, in fulfilment of an vow, on his return from his coronation in Rome, on a site of strategic importance on the primary trade route between Italy and Augsburg. The foundation legend is that Ludwig's horse genuflected three times on the site of the original church building, where a marble statuette of the Madonna and Child (\\"Frau Stifterin\\" or the \\"Ettal Madonna\\") now stands. The statuette was brought by Ludwig from Pisa as a gift for his new foundation. It soon became an object of pilgrimage. The church is dedicated to the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin. The foundation originally consisted of a Benedictine double monastery ‚Äì a community for men and another for women ‚Äì and also a house of the Teutonic Knights. The original Gothic abbey church, built between 1330 and 1370, was a modest structure in comparison to the great churches of medieval Bavaria. The abbey suffered great damage during the Reformation at the hands of the troops of Maurice of Saxony, but survived the troubles of the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648). =Baroque expansion= Frescos under the dome In 1709, under Abbot Placidus II Seiz, the golden age of Ettal began with the establishment of the \\"Knights' Academy\\" (\\"Ritterakademie\\"), which developed into a highly successful school and began the educational tradition of the abbey. In 1744, the abbey and the abbey church were largely destroyed in a fire. The subsequent spectacular re-building in the Baroque style, with a double-shelled dome, was to the plans of Enrico Zuccalli, a Swiss-Italian architect working in Munich, who had studied with Bernini. The decoration was primarily carried out by Josef Schmutzer of the Wessobrunn School of stuccoists and Johann Baptist Straub, who was responsible for the altars and the chancel. Ettal's importance as a place of pilgrimage grew with the new buildings and it became one of the most important monasteries in the Alpine region. =Secularization= The abbey was dissolved in 1803 during the secularization of church property in Bavaria. The site was acquired in 1809 by Josef von Elbing and sold by his descendants in 1856 to Count Pappenheim. Some small building works were completed during the 19th century, principally the renovation of the fa√ßade and the twin bell towers. =Second foundation= Statue on the pulpit In 1898, the buildings were acquired by Baron Theodor von Cramer-Klett and, in 1900, given to the Benedictines of Scheyern Abbey, who re-founded the monastery here. It has been a member of the Bavarian Congregation of the Benedictine Confederation since 1900. The abbey church of the Ascension was declared a basilica minor in 1920. During the winter of 1940‚Äì1941, the German pastor and theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer (1906‚Äì1945) spent some months at the monastery as the friend and guest of the Abbot. Like Bonhoeffer, a number of those in the Ettal community were involved in the conspiracy against Hitler. While at Ettal, Bonhoeffer also worked on his book Ethics. Catholic priest Rupert Mayer was kept at the Abbey under house arrest from 1939 to 1945 by the Nazis to prevent him from further anti-Nazi preaching. In 1993, Ettal re-founded the former Wechselburg Abbey in Saxony, an old monastery of the Augustinian Canons, as a Benedictine priory. Ettal maintains a Byzantine Institute. The abbot of Ettal, Joannes Hoeck, made a significant contribution on the role of Patriarchs in Church government at the Second Vatican Council. =Sex abuse scandal= In early 2010, ten priests at the Ettal Abbey boarding school were accused of sadistic beatings, molestation, or making sexual advances on boys as well as sadism. In March 2010, authorities raided the monastery as part of a probe into allegations that priests sexually abused children there. By an Apostolic Visitation and an independent investigation, these allegations have been surveyed and consequences have been drafted. The major part of the alleged abuses took place in the late 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s. Both the monastery‚Äôs Abbot Barnabas B√∂gle and the head of the school Maurus Kra√ü both resigned in February 2010 after being pressured to do so by Munich Archbishop Reinhard Marx.https://www.thelocal.de/20100227/25547 However, B√∂gle was re-elected Abbot in July 2010 and Kra√ü was later reinstated by the Bavarian Education Ministry.https://www.thelocal.de/20100713/28465 On September 6, 2011, the monastery agreed to pay ‚Ç¨700,000 to 70 former pupils who were victims of abuse, with each victim receiving between ‚Ç¨5,000 and ‚Ç¨20,000 each in compensation.https://www.thelocal.de/20110907/37437 Economy The monastery runs a brewery, a distillery, a bookstore, an art publishing house, a hotel, a cheese factory joint venture, and several smaller companies. The distillery produces Ettaler Kloster Liqueur, a herbal liqueur which, like that of the Carthusian monks, comes in sweeter yellow and more herbal green varieties. School In the tradition of the Ritterakademie, the abbey established a secondary school (\\"Gymnasium\\") specialising in the humanities and modern languages, with a boarding house. The boarding school and its clergy were charged with sexual and physical child abuse and have been under investigation since 2 March 2010 by the German Federal Prosecutor. The abbot has since resigned. Notable alumni include Karl Joseph von Firmian, Duarte Nuno, Duke of Braganza, Franz, Duke of Bavaria and diplomat Rupprecht von Keller. Abbots * Heinrich I.

He served as a director of the Bank of England from 1938 to 1952 and a director of the Bank for International Settlements from 1931 to 1965. An Oxford graduate, Niemeyer began working for HM Treasury in 1906 and rose rapidly through the ranks, finishing his time there as controller of finance (1922‚Äì1927). He was recruited to the Bank of England by Montagu Norman, and represented the bank at the League of Nations and on a number of missions overseas. His visit to Australia in 1930 contributed to a political crisis that resulted in the Australian Labor Party split of 1931 and the collapse of James Scullin's government. Personal life Niemeyer was born in Streatham, London, the eldest of three children born to Ethel (n√©e Rayner) and Ernst August Wilhelm Niemeyer. His mother was English. His father, originally from Hanover, Germany, arrived in Britain in 1870 and became a naturalised subject. Niemeyer attended St Paul's School, London before going on to Balliol College, Oxford. He married a distant cousin, Sophie Niemeyer, in 1910, and they had four children together. He retired to Lindfield, Sussex, dying there in 1971 at the age of 87. Career =Treasury= Niemeyer joined HM Treasury in 1906. He rose rapidly through the ranks, becoming deputy controller of finance in 1920 and controller of finance in 1922, succeeding Basil Blackett. He held that position until 1927, serving as the chief adviser to the Chancellor of the Exchequer on financial matters. He took Blackett's place on the financial committee of the League of Nations. According to Frederick Leith-Ross, Niemeyer was \\"the outstanding Treasury official of the post-war years\\". His advice was instrumental in the introduction of the British Gold Standard Act 1925, which saw the country return to the gold standard. He left the Treasury at the age of 44, feeling he could advance no further within the department. =Bank of England= Niemeyer was recruited to the Bank of England in 1927 by Montagu Norman, as an adviser to the governor. He represented the bank on the financial committee of the League of Nations until 1937 and on the Corporation of Foreign Bondholders from 1935 to 1965, including as vice-president from 1950 to 1955 and president from 1955 to 1965. Niemeyer was elected an executive director of the bank in 1938, alongside Cameron Cobbold, and was briefly mooted as successor to Norman in 1944; his candidacy was vetoed by Winston Churchill. He often filled a sort of diplomatic role for the bank, touring a number of different countries in order to provide advice to foreign governments and check up on the bank's debtors. In this capacity he toured Australia and New Zealand (1930), Brazil (1931), Argentina (1933), India (1936), and China (1941). Advice to Australia Australia had accrued substantial debt, mainly from Britain's independent banking sector, by the late 1920s ‚Äì partly as a result of Prime Minister Stanley Bruce's \\"Men, Money, Markets\\" economic strategy, and partly because of the large war debt established during World War I. After the Wall Street Crash, the United States called in many of its World War I loans, including many from the UK, which, in turn called in its own loans from Australia. Australia had accumulated such massive debt that it was unable to repay even the interest on its loans. To avert total bankruptcy with the onset of the Australia's Great Depression, Australia asked Britain for a deferment of payment on its war debts. To determine whether or not this was a viable financial option, the Bank of England sent Niemeyer to give an assessment of Australia and its financial situation. He came by arrangement with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia and agreement by Prime Minister James Scullin, who hoped to use Niemeyer's advice as an affirmation of his government's financial policy. Scullin announced the visit in Parliament on 19 June 1930: > \\"The Commonwealth representative in London has for some time been in close > consultation with the Bank of England and other financial authorities with a > view to finding a solution of the growing difficulties of providing exchange > to cover Australian payments oversea. At the same time the Australian Loan > Council has been in close consultation on the same subject with the > Commonwealth Bank and the associated banks in Australia. The Government and > the banks have already taken important corrective measures for adjusting the > trade balance, and the banks have materially assisted the Australian > governments to secure exchange on London. The Commonwealth Government is > determined that the necessary steps shall be taken to meet promptly all > Australian oversea obligations, and as the Bank of England has expressed its > willingness to assist Australia to find a solution of its present > difficulties the Government and the Bank have mutually agreed that there > should be consultation in Australia between a representative of the Bank of > England, the Commonwealth Government and the Commonwealth Bank Board. A > representative of the Bank of England, Sir Otto Niemeyer, will accordingly > visit Australia. He left London yesterday accompanied by an economist and an > officer of the Bank of England.\\"HofR Hansard 19 June 1930 Economic historian Alex Millmow has commented that, when Niemeyer, his adviser Professor Theodore Gregory, and assistant Raymond Kershaw (an Australian economist) arrived in July 1930 they were unaware of the political storm they were to cause, for Niemeyer would bring English orthodox economics down on Australia's head. The high point of Niemeyer's tour was his address at the Melbourne Conference of Commonwealth and State leaders, where he said that the 'cold facts must be faced' ... 'In short, Australia is off budget equilibrium, off exchange equilibrium, and faced by considerable unfunded and maturing debts both internally and externally, in addition to which she has on her hands a very large program of loan works for which no financial provision has been made'. He warned Australia had two years 'to get its house in order' before a tranche of external debt matured in 1932. He believed Australians were too optimistic about the country's prospects.Millmow, \\"Niemeyer, Scullin and the Australian Economists\\", Australian Economic History Review, vol 44 no 2, July 2004 p. 151. He was critical of Australia's overconfidence and essentially said that Australia was \\"living beyond its means\\" and had become prosperous through \\"mistakes\\"; that Australians would have to \\"accept a lower standard of living\\"; that Australia should continue to exist only as a means to supply Britain with goods; and that its protectionist attitude was deviating Australia from its true purpose. The federal and state heads of government gave mixed responses to Niemeyer's plan. The governments of Australia later met to negotiate a compromise in 1931, known as the Premiers' Plan. Populists like Jack Lang and former prime minister Billy Hughes decried Niemeyer's diagnosis and therapy. Anti-English and anti-German sentiment were both at play in the general public rejection of Niemeyer's advice, as well as anti-Semitism (it being wrongly assumed that he was Jewish). He was seen as promoting the interests of wealthy overseas bankers at the expense of the Australian people, who were struggling to cope with the Great Depression. =Other activities and honours= Outside the Bank of England, Niemeyer was a director of the Bank of International Settlements from 1931 to 1965, including as chairman from 1937 to 1940 and vice-chairman from 1940 to 1946. He helped set up the National Association for Mental Health, serving as provisional chairman from 1943 to 1946. He was a governor of St Paul's School, Marlborough College, and the London School of Economics, serving as chairman of LSE from 1941 to 1957. Niemeyer was appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in 1921, Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) in 1924, and Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (GBE) in 1927.

It relieves itching, redness, dryness, crusting, scaling, inflammation, and discomfort. The usual prescription concentration is 0.05% as a topical cream, ointment, solution, or gel. The application area should normally not be covered after application. In certain cases, the physician may recommend the use of an occlusive dressing after application to increase the rate and depth of absorption. The frequency of application depends on the condition being treated and the area affected, but most often it should be applied 2 to 4 times a day. Fluocinonide ranks as a \\"high-potency\\" (second-highest rank) topical corticosteroid. Minimal amounts should be used for a minimal length of time to avoid the occurrence of adverse effects. Fluocinonide should not be used if infection is present. It should not be applied to the eyes or to sensitive areas such as the genitals or anus. A common potential adverse effect is skin atrophy (thinning of the skin). Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) suppression, manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria in some patients.

Willstown was part of the Native American trade network in the region. The settlement The settlement of Willstown began at the southernmost perimeter of Lookout Mountain near the banks of Lookout or Little Wills Creek. Willstown sat in the present right-of-way of the Great Southern Railroad; bordered to the northwest by an ancient Indian trade path or trail. =Trading center= Willstown was one major trade center along the trade path. The trail, which coincides with the current route of US Highway Eleven since the 1920s, ran through what is now Attalla, Alabama, and continued north along the edge of the mountains through what is now Reece City, Crudup, Keener, Collinsville, Killian, and Fort Payne into Valley Head and the old mining settlement of Battelle. There are three known Indian trading sites along the stretch between Attalla and Collinsville, as well as numerous burial sites, home-sites and remnants of farms. Namesake town The site of Willstown is north of the present day city of Ft. Payne, close to the Valley Head area.Note: The former Fort Payne was built to intern Cherokees prior to their removal on the Trail of Tears. Its site is in downtown Ft. Payne.

It was commonly called \\"Willstown\\" after its headman, a red-headed man of mixed-race named Will Weber (also known as \\"RedHead Chief Will\\"), who was famous for his mane of thick red hair. The town, which had sometimes also been called Wattstown because Chickamauga leader, John Watts, had used it as his headquarters, was founded during the Cherokee‚ÄìAmerican wars, and served as the council seat of the Lower Cherokee well into the 19th century. According to Major John Norton, a more accurate transliteration would have been Titsohili.Note: The son of a mixed-blood Cherokee adoptee of the Mohawk, Norton grew up among Native Americans and traveled extensively in the region in the early 19th century. He had stayed at Willstown several times.History of DeKalb County ; on-line page at DeKalb County Tourist Association. Weber emigrated to the Arkansas country in 1796; and Watts died in 1802.

He is best known for his spells with Torquay United and Crewe Alexandra. He has also played internationally for Saint Vincent and the Grenadines national football team. Career Jack was spotted by Torquay United manager Don O'Riordan when playing for Lambada, a Caribbean select side. O'Riordan signed him for the Gulls on 10 October 1995. He joined Newcastle United on trial in September 1996, Kevin Keegan offering ¬£250,000 for him, but the deal fell through due to problems with his work permit. With the attention being placed on him from higher levels it was inevitable that Jack would move on at some point, and on 17 July 1998 he moved to Crewe Alexandra for a club record fee of ¬£650,000. He had played 110 times, scoring 30 goals for Torquay. He immediately settled into the Crewe side, scoring nine goals in his first season, but injuries and international call-ups hampered his progress. He played 188 times and scored 42 goals for Crewe before signing for Rushden & Diamonds in 2003 playing 49 games and scoring 13 goals before following manager Brian Talbot to Oldham Athletic in 2004. His time with Oldham was blighted by injuries and the club released him in 2005. He spent the summer on trial at newly relegated Division Two side Wrexham but failed to win a contract at the club and signed for Irish side Waterford United. In the summer of 2006 he rejoined Crewe Alexandra on a one-year contract, at the end of which he was released on a free transfer. In July 2007, he trialed for Conference North side Southport, playing in a friendly against Tranmere Rovers, in which he set up the only goal of the game. He was offered a contract by Southport manager, Peter Davenport, before returning to his home country to deal with \\"family commitments\\". On returning to England he trained with Southport and joined full-time until the end of the season. His experience shone through in the 5‚Äì1 thrashing of fellow promotion chasers AFC Telford United. He left Southport towards the end of the season, and joined Nantwich Town. He won the club's Player of the Year award for the 2010‚Äì11 season. He left Nantwich at the end of the 2011/12 season.

Since 1857, the manufacture has been based in Alessandria, Piedmont. The founder, Giuseppe Borsalino, is remembered for creating a particular model of felt hat characterized by the registered trademark Borsalino.http://www.gdli.ithttp://www.treccani.it/vocabolario/borsalino History On 4 April 1857, Giuseppe Borsalino started a workshop in Alessandria that specialized in the production of felt hats. The workshop eventually grew to industrial production, and in 1888 the company moved to a new factory designed by Arnaldo Gardella, located on Corso Cento Cannoni, Alessandria. In these years Borsalino produced 2,500 hats a day, but when the company won the Grand Prix, an important quality certificate, at the Paris Exposition Universelle in 1900, spread the brand's fame globally. The succession of Giuseppe Borsalino was complicated: the designated heir, Teresio Borsalino, was opposed to his cousin Giovanni Borsalino, son of Lazzaro, who inaugurated a new hat factory using the family name. Between Borsalino Antica Casa and Borsalino Fu Lazzaro were years of hard commercial battles but in the end the Teresio came out and the name Borsalino became one again. On the eve of the First World War Borsalino produced about 2,000,000 hats annually. The manufacture employed over 2,500 employees, representing a significant resource in the economy of the Piedmontese city. Abroad, the brand spread everywhere, conquering the most important markets: the British, but especially the US, where the hats produced in Alessandria were adopted by the Hollywood starsystem. The downsizing of the company occurred in 1950 in conjunction with the beginning of the fall into disuse of formal hats: Borsalino is thus transformed from mass product into a cult object. In 1987 the hat factory moved from the historic center in Alessandria to the current one of Spinetta Marengo, in the suburbs of the city, and the president Vittorio Vaccarino, the last descendant of the Borsalino family, sold the company to a group of Milanese entrepreneurs. In the nineties the company changed ownership several times to be finally bought by the entrepreneur Marco Marenco, involved in a ‚Ç¨3.5 billion financial crack. On 18 December 2017 the Court of Alessandria declared the bankruptcy of Borsalino Giuseppe and Fratello Spa. Haeres Equita, a private equity fund which manages the brand's activities since 2016, confirms the will to continue the production, the distribution and the promoting activities of the forthcoming collections, keeping all employments and maintaining the production site in Alessandria (Piedmont).http://www.lastampa.it/2017/12/18/edizioni/alessandria/borsalino- lattivit-continua-la-societ-di-philippe-camperio-conferma-la-volont-di-andare- avanti-qpQFTj5VypqKSPeFOWoSwL/pagina.html In 2017, on the occasion of the 160th anniversary of the company, the Italian Ministry of Economic Development recognized Borsalino as one of the 'Excellencies of the production system', dedicating it a stamp worth ‚Ç¨0.95.http://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion- scoops/borsalino-160th-anniversary-celebrated-postage-stamp-italy-10857782/ On 12 July 2018, the company was sold in a court auction for 6.4 million euros ($7.4 million) to Haeres Equita. Production Borsalino manufacturing has remained faithful to a production process that represents the cultural values of the company, handed down from generation to generation. The hats continue to be produced in Alessandria by combining industrial technology and the spirit craftsmanship. The felt models, created from fur fibers, require more than 50 manual steps and seven weeks of work to create; the straw models, which are hand twisted, can take up to 6 months for a single hat.https://maestrosacademy.samsung.it/Alice- Rapettihttp://www.borsalino.com/en/antica- casa/craftsmanshiphttp://www.ilpost.it/2015/12/04/come-si-fa-un-Borsalino/ Borsalino and Alessandria The Borsalino business dynasty has made an important contribution to the city of Alessandria, building the aqueduct, the sewerage network, hospital, sanatorium and retirement home.https://radiogold.it/tempo-libero/40790-nostalgica-fu-alessandria-miti- marchi-fatto-storia-citta-suo-territorio/ The historic headquarters of the company, currently located in Corso 100 Cannoni, now hosts the University of Eastern Piedmont Amedeo Avogadro and the Borsalino Hat Museum.http://www.cultural.it/musei/Borsalino.asphttp://www.museimpresa.com/associato/museo- cappello-Borsalino/http://www.beniculturali.it/mibac/opencms/MiBAC/sito- MiBAC/Luogo/MibacUnif/Luoghi-della- Cultura/visualizza_asset.html?id=152786&pagename;=57http://www.regione.piemonte.it/pinforma/cultura/1167-un- nuovo-museo-del-cappello-Borsalino.html In 2016, independent film director Enrica Viola dedicated a documentary to the relationship between Borsalino and Alessandria: Borsalino Cityhttp://www.Borsalinocity.it/index- it.htmlhttps://www.gqitalia.it/moda/trend/new/2016/04/26/tutto-quello-che-non- sai-sul-cappello-Borsalino/http://film.cinecitta.com/IT/it- it/news/70/2413/Borsalino-city.aspx was presented at film festivals in Turin, Barcelona and Melbourne. The Borsalino Hat Museum In the spring of 2006, the Borsalino Hat Museum opened in the company's historical headquarters in Corso 100 Cannoni, Alessandria. A joint initiative by Alessandria town council and the Borsalino company, the museum covers an exhibition area of 400 m¬≤ and houses about two thousand hats, displayed in the historic Chippendale style cabinets made in the 1920s by Arnaldo Gardella for the factory sample room. In 2018, the museum is planning to move to a larger venue with a completely renovated exhibition.http://www.lastampa.it/2017/10/05/edizioni/alessandria/finito-il- cantiere-per-il-museo-borsalino-ora-si-deve-riallestire-ci-vorranno-mesi- DZl3crV7CHCkfQILVjRJcI/pagina.html In Orthodox Jewish communities Among Orthodox Jewish men and boys, covering the head is an identifier of religiousity. Many men in strictly Orthodox Jewish communities wear a black, wide-brimmed Borsalino hat. This preference is so common that black hats of this style by other makers are called borsalino as a generic trademark. In popular culture =Borsalino and art= The relationship between Borsalino and the art world has ancient origins. Since the birth of advertising in Italy, at the turn of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, Borsalino has entrusted the realization of its posters to the most important artists of the time. This privileged relationship with art has been confirmed over time and has led the company to collaborate with Cesare Simonetti, Giorgio Muggiani, Giovanni Dradi, Franz Laskoff, Marcello Dudovich, winner in 1910 of a competition organized by Borsalino to publicize the Zenit hat, Giuseppe Minonzio, Gino Boccasile, Luigi Bompard, Jeanne Grignani, Luigi Veronesi, Max Huber and Armando Testa. Today the antique Borsalino advertising posters are collector items that have been beaten in the most important auction houses in the world. =Borsalino and theatre= In Arthur Miller‚Äôs play The Price, character Solomon regrets that his hat is not a Borsalino, in spite of looking so. =Borsalino and cinema= Borsalino has a long-running and special bond with the film industry. One picture stands out above all: Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman in the unforgettable final scene of Casablanca. The relationship with the cinema was destined to last: in addition to Bogart and Bergman in Casablanca, Marcello Mastroianni in 8 ¬Ω and Jean Paul Belmondo in Breathless both wore a Borsalino. Above all, the Alessandria factory granted the use of its name to two cult films of the 1970s: Borsalino and Borsalino & Co.. The idea was Alain Delon's, and Borsalino accepted on the condition that the company logo would appear on the posters. The Italian company was the first luxury brand to give its name to two films. Even Robert De Niro in Once upon a time in America(1984) wears Borsalino hats. In 2011, the Triennale Design Museum in Milan hosted an exhibition entitled \\"Il cinema con il cappello. Borsalino e altre storie\\".http://archive.panorama.com/culture/Al-cinema-col-cappello-i- Borsalino-piu-famosi-del-grande-schermo-in-mostra-alla-Triennale-di- Milanohttp://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/cultura/2011-01-18/bogart-alain-delon- triennale-182145.shtml?uuid=Aa2kju0C The actor Toni Servillo wears a Borsalino in the film The Great Beauty, which won Best Foreign Language Film at the 86th Academy Awards. In 2018, Borsalino celebrates its deep and lasting relationship with the world of cinema by introducing The Bogart by Borsalino, a special collection dedicated to Humphrey Bogart, the great Hollywood actor. The hats collection is created in collaboration with Humphrey Bogart Estate.https://robbreport.com/style/fashion/gallery/pictures-borsalino-bogart- fedora-2816205/ =Borsalino and design= In 2009, Borsalino was included by the Triennale Design Museum in Milan among quintessential Italian icons in the 'Serie Fuori Serie' exhibition.

History alt= Thilafushi originally was a lagoon called \\"Thilafalhu\\" with a length of 7 km and a width of 200 metres at the shallowest regions. It came into existence following a series of discussions and efforts to resolve Mal√©'s garbage predicament during the early 1990s. The decision to reclaim Thilafalhu as a landfill was made on December 5, 1991. Thilafushi received its first load of garbage from Mal√© on January 7, 1992. Operations started with just 1 landing craft, 4 heavyload trucks, 2 excavators and a single wheel loader. During its early years of waste disposal operations, pits (also known as cells) with a volume of 37,500 ft3 (1060 m3) were dug, after which the sand obtained from the excavation was used to construct walled enclosures around the internal perimeter of the cells. Waste received from Mal√© was deposited into the midst of the pit, which was topped off with a layer of construction debris and then uniformly levelled with white sand. Initially there was no segregation of the waste since it had to be disposed immediately due to mass accumulation. Industrialization Thilafushi-2, area with heaviest industrialization Today Thilafushi has a landmass of more than 4.6 million ft2 (0.43 km¬≤). The speedy terrestrial growth of Thilafushi was observed by the Government, and in November 1997, it was decided that land was to be leased to entrepreneurs interested in acquiring land for industrial purposes. Initially there were just 22 lease holders. Within the past 10 years, this number has doubled to 54 resulting in more than 1.2 million square feet (0.11 km¬≤ or 27.5 acres) of land being used currently, which generates an excess of 14 million Rufiyaa (about USD1,000,000.00) per annum. Soon after, an area of 0.2 km¬≤ (known as Thilafushi-2) was reclaimed using white sand as the filling material to provide terra firma for the more heavy industries. The current (major) industrial activities in the island are boat manufacturing, cement packing, methane gas bottling and various large scale warehousing. The government is also planning a 50-ton incinerator facility. In March 2015 the Maldivian government decided to relocate the central commercial port from Mal√© to Thilafushi.Government signs MoU with Dubai Ports World Minivan News, 23 March 2015. However the deal was not completed. Environmental issues Mountains of waste piled up on the \\"garbage island\\" of Thilafushi. Environmentalists say that more than 330 tonnes of rubbish is brought to Thilafushi a day, most of which comes from Mal√©. In 2005 it was estimated that 31,000 truckloads of garbage are transported to Thilafushi annually, where it is dumped in large piles and eventually used to reclaim land and increase the size of the island.Tsunami leaves garbage problems for atoll nation The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), 2 May 2005. So much is being deposited that the island is growing at a square metre a day.Paradise lost on Maldives' rubbish island Guardian, 3 January 2009. According to official statistics, a single tourist produces 3.5 kg of garbage a day, twice as much as someone from Mal√© and five times more than anyone from the rest of the Maldives archipelago. Altogether, that comes to \\"300 to 400 tons of trash\\" dumped on the island every day, according to Shina Ahmed, administration manager of the Thilafushi Corporation that runs the island.Maldives: Idyllic Archipelago's Unprecedented Floating Trash Dump Le Monde/Worldcrunch, 11 May 2012. Ali Rilwan, an environmentalist in Mal√©, said that \\"used batteries, asbestos, lead and other potentially hazardous waste mixed with the municipal solid wastes being put into the water.

Bluepeace, the main ecological movement of the Maldives, has described the island as a \\"toxic bomb\\". After reports of illegal dumping surfaced, management was transferred to Mal√© City Council to clear up confusion to who could be responsible for the waste. The council signed a contract in 2011 with the Indian-based company, Tatva Global Renewable Energy to rehabilitate the island and manage the waste problem. However, the deal was never implemented due to bureaucracy and political interference, ultimately cancelling it. In December 2011 the Mal√© City Council temporarily banned the transporting of waste to Thilafushi because of a surge in waste floating in the island's lagoon and drifting out to sea.Thilafushi closed for clean-up as ‚Äògarbage island‚Äô overflows Minivan News, 6 December 2011.Maldives 'Rubbish Island' is 'overwhelmed' by garbage BBC News Asia, 8 December 2011.Garbage floats off Thilafushi Haveeru Online, 6 September 2011.

This is sometimes known as the Kinross Incident, after Kinross Air Force Base, where Moncla was on temporary assignment when he disappeared. The U.S. Air Force reported that Moncla had crashed and that the object of the intercept was a Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) aircraft. According to the report, the pilot of the Canadian aircraft was later contacted and stated that he did not see the intercepting plane and did not know that he was the subject of an interception. However, on several occasions, the RCAF denied that any of their aircraft was involved in any incident on that day, in correspondence with members of the public asking for further details of the intercept. Biography Moncla was born in Mansura, Louisiana, on October 21, 1926, to Felix Sr. (1894‚Äì1957), a high school science teacher, principal, and veteran of World War I, and Yvonne Beridon Moncla (1900‚Äì1961), a seamstress. He also had two older sisters, Leonie and Muriel Ann. Not long after his father had been hospitalized, the family moved to Moreauville, Louisiana, to live with his uncle and great aunt. He attended high school in the area and after graduating accepted an athletic scholarship to Southwest Louisiana Institute (now University of Louisiana at Lafayette) where he played football and received his Bachelor of Science degree. After graduation, he enlisted in the U.S. Army and served during World War II in occupied Japan. After his service, he attended the University of New Orleans, but reenlisted in the military at the start of the Korean War in 1950 in the United States Air Force as an officer pilot trainee. After spending a few months at a desk job in Dallas, Texas, Moncla was sent to Connally Air Force Base in Waco, Texas, for basic pilot training where he met and married Bobbie Jean Coleman. He took his advanced pilot training at Reese Air Force Base in Lubbock, Texas, and further training on the F-89 Scorpion at Tyndall Air Force Base in Panama City, Florida. In Panama City, Bobbie Jean gave birth to their first son. In July, 1952, Moncla and his family moved to Madison, Wisconsin, and had a daughter born five months before Felix Moncla's disappearance. Disappearance On the evening of November 23, 1953, Air Defense Command Ground Intercept radar operators at Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan identified an unusual target near the Soo Locks. An F-89C Scorpion jet from Kinross Air Force Base was scrambled to investigate the radar return; the Scorpion was piloted by First Lieutenant Moncla with Second Lieutenant Robert L. Wilson acting as the Scorpion's radar operator. Wilson had a difficult time tracking the object on the Scorpion's radar, so ground radar operators gave Moncla directions towards the object as he flew. Moncla eventually closed in on the object at about 8000 feet in altitude. Ground Control tracked the Scorpion and the unidentified object as two \\"blips\\" on the radar screen. The two blips on the radar screen grew closer and closer, until they seemed to merge. Assuming that Moncla had flown either under or over the target, Ground Control anticipated that moments later, the Scorpion and the object would again appear as two separate blips. Donald Keyhoe reported that there was a fear that the two objects had struck one another,NUFORC Case Brief but the single blip continued on its previous course. Attempts were made to contact Moncla via radio, but without success. A search and rescue operation by both the USAF and the RCAF was quickly mounted, but failed to find a trace of the plane or the pilots. Weather conditions were a factor in hampering the search. USAF Accident Investigation Report Lt. Gene Moncla by T-33 at Truax Field in Madison, Wi. The official USAF Accident Investigation Report states the F-89 was sent to investigate an RCAF C-47 Skytrain which was travelling off course. The F-89 was flying at an elevation of 8000 feet when it merged with the other aircraft, as was expected in an interception. Its IFF signal also disappeared after the two returns merged on the radar scope. Although efforts to contact the crew on radio were unsuccessful, the pilot of another F-89 sent on the search stated in testimony to the accident board that he believed that he had heard a brief radio transmission from the pilot about forty minutes after the plane disappeared.Aircraft Accident Board, USAF Accident Investigation Report for F-89 51-5853A, December 1953, Sect. \\"Findings\\" Air Force investigators reported that Moncla may have experienced vertigo and crashed into the lake. The Air Force said that Moncla had been known to experience vertigo from time to time: \\"Additional leads uncovered during this later course of the investigation indicated that there might be a possibility that Lt. Moncla was subject to attacks of vertigo a little more than the normal degree. Upon pursuing these leads, it was discovered that statements had been made by former members of Lt. Moncla's organization but were not first hand evidence and were regarded as hearsay.\\" Pilot vertigo is not listed as a cause or possible cause in any of the USAF Accident Investigation Board's findings and conclusions.Aircraft Accident Board, USAF Accident Investigation Report for F-89 51-5853A, December 1953, Sect. \\"Testimony of Lt. William A. Mingenbach\\" The official accident report states that when the unknown return was first picked up on radar, it was believed to be RCAF aircraft \\"VC-912\\" but it was classified as \\"UNKNOWN\\" because it was off its flight plan course by about 30 miles.Aircraft Accident Board, USAF Accident Investigation Report for F-89 51-5853A, December 1953, Sect. \\"Statement by Douglas A. Stuart\\" This assertion was emphatically denied by the pilot of this RCAF flight, Gerald Fosberg, when he was interviewed for the David Cherniack documentary \\"The Moncla Memories\\" produced for Vision TV's Enigma series.Cherniack, David (2006) \\"The Moncla Memories\\" documentary film for Vision TV's \\"Enigma\\" series The USAF also provided an alternative explanation to UFO investigator Donald Keyhoe. In his 1955 book, The Flying Saucer Conspiracy, Keyhoe describes his investigation into the F-89's disappearance which began the night of the incident; when he received a phone call telling him of \\"a rumor out at Selfridge Field that an F-89 from Kinross (sic) was hit by a flying saucer\\".Keyhoe, Major Donald E. (1955) The Flying Saucer Conspiracy, published by Henry Holt and Company, Pg.15. A follow-up telephone call to Public Information Officer Lt. Robert C. White revealed that \\"the unknown in that case was a Canadian DC-3. It was over the locks by mistake\\".Keyhoe, Major Donald E. (1955) The Flying Saucer Conspiracy, published by Henry Holt and Company, Pg.18 The \\"locks\\" refers to the restricted air space over the locks at Sault Ste. Marie, on the U.S.‚ÄìCanada border at the southeast end of Lake Superior. Reports of parts found in 1968 Gene Moncla memorial in Sacred Heart Cemetery, Moreauville, LA. It is possible that aircraft parts found near the eastern shore of Lake Superior in late October 1968 were from the missing F-89. A U.S. Air Force officer confirmed the parts were from a military jet aircraft and news reports speculated these might be from the F-89 missing from Kinross AFB in 1953. The identity of the parts was never published and the Canadian government states they have no record of the find. 2006 \\"Great Lakes Dive Company\\" hoax In late August 2006, an email from a \\"Preston Miller\\" was sent to UFO researcher Francis Ridge which contained a quoted excerpt from an Associated Press story. The quoted \\"news story\\" claimed that a group of Michigan divers had discovered Moncla's F-89 that vanished in 1953. The location of the claimed discovery was at the bottom of Lake Superior in the approximate location where the F-89 had disappeared from radar. The email also contained a link to a website that had recently been created for the group of divers; they called themselves the \\"Great Lakes Dive Company\\". Francis Ridge forwarded the email to the Internet website \\"UFO Updates\\", a popular forum and message board for UFO researchers and writers. As a result, news of the purported discovery quickly spread through the UFO community and news media sources. Several reporters attempted to contact the \\"Great Lakes Dive Company\\" to obtain more information about the discovery. The reporters were placed in contact with a person who claimed to be the spokesman for the Great Lakes Company. He called himself \\"Adam Jimenez\\", and he discussed the \\"discovery\\" with several investigators and journalists. \\"Adam Jimenez\\" was even interviewed by UFO researcher Linda Moulton Howe on the nationally syndicated, late-night radio talk show, Coast to Coast AM. The company website initially presented two images of the claimed discovery, both images stated as being output from side-scan sonar. The fuzzy, high noise images depicted an almost completely intact aircraft resting on the lakebed, its nose in the silt, with one exposed wing, tip tank and the upswept tail characteristic of the F-89 \\"Scorpion\\" clearly displayed. The discovery initially caused excitement, as many felt that the discovery of the crashed jet would at last provide an answer as to what had happened to Felix Moncla in 1953. However, as journalists and ufologists delved deeper into the case, their suspicions were raised as the story became more and more elaborate. It was soon stated that an unexplained metallic object had been found near the F-89 and \\"sonar images\\" of this discovery were soon published on the website. It was speculated that the \\"teardrop-shaped\\" object was possibly the UFO that the F-89 had merged with on radar. Several factors about the alleged discovery led journalists to claim that the discovery was in fact a hoax. Several investigators began efforts to track down more information about the \\"Great Lakes Dive Company\\" and their spokesman, \\"Adam Jimenez\\". All efforts to find evidence of the existence of the \\"Great Lakes Dive Company\\" led to the conclusion that the company did not exist. Efforts to obtain any biographical data on \\"Adam Jimenez\\" also turned up nothing. The only contact information anyone obtained for Jimenez were an email address and cellphone. Only three weeks after the discovery, the company's website suddenly disappeared without explanation and \\"Adam Jimenez\\" stopped answering emails and cellphone calls. An investigation by James Carrion, at that time the International Director of MUFON, the largest UFO civilian research organization in the United States, revealed that there was no evidence the Associated Press had written the original \\"news story\\" that was quoted in the initial notice of the discovery to MUFON, nor any record of the existence of the \\"Great Lakes Dive Company\\" beyond its fleeting presence on a website; \\"Adam Jimenez\\" refused to provide any further information on the principals of the company, the type of vessel they used, or any other information which might help to establish the existence of the organization. Carrion's investigation showed that many of Adam Jimenez's statements about the discovery of the F-89 jet were untrue, including his suggestion that the Canadian government had withheld permission for site survey work to be resumed. It turned out no such permission had been requested. Brendon Baillod, who is active in Great Lakes shipwreck hunting and maritime history circles, and is a director of the Association for Great Lakes Maritime History, stated that he had never heard of Jimenez or his group and that nobody he knew associated with the history of the Great Lakes had heard of him either. Baillod said that the sidescan images taken seemed to be authentic, but dismissed Jimenez's claim that they had been made with a fishfinder, particularly in depth of water. He further said that the images could not have been made with a hull mounted transducer as was claimed by Jimenez, but would have required a towfish (a towed scanner). , the general consensus among journalists and UFO researchers who have investigated the purported discovery is that it is a hoax, and that Felix Moncla's F-89 jet remains undiscovered.

Around 1579 he began studies in London, at New Inn, one of the eight Inns of Chancery, and then at Middle Temple, one of the four Inns of Court.\\"Canfield, Benet of\\", Vincentian Encyclopedia A discussion with a Dissenter convinced him that all Reformed theology was flawed (including that of his own Anglican Church). Fitch came upon Robert Persons's \\"The first booke of the Christian exercise, appertayning to Resolution\\", an important devotional work of the time, and decided to convert to Catholicism, then illegal in England. He went to study at the English Catholic college at Douai in Belgium, a major centre for English Recusants, or Catholics in exile, during the Elizabethan period. He entered the Capuchin order as a Friar in 1587 and was given the religious name of Beno√Æt de Canfeld, \\"Beno√Æt\\" the French form of Benedict, but in English he used the older form, Benet. Completing his theological studies in Italy, he returned to Britain around 1599 and was immediately imprisoned, where he wrote his theological allegory, Le chevalier Chrestien. He was banished to France on an appeal by Henry IV of France in the spring of 1603. He became Master of Novices at Rouen in 1608, and was well known in the French Court. Benet was a teacher of Pierre de B√©rulle, founder of the French school of spirituality, and of many interested in the spiritual renewal of France.O'Donnell, Hugh C.M. (1995) \\"Apostolic Reflection,\\" Vincentian Heritage Journal: Vol. 16: Iss. 2, Article 2 Benet died in Paris on 21 November 1610. Works In 1609, towards the end of his life, Benet published his masterpiece, R√®gle de perfection r√©duite au seul point de la volont√© divine (Rule of Perfection). This work fell under the disapproval of the Church in the early 17th century, and is therefore less well-known than Holy Wisdom by his contemporary and associate Augustine Baker. Both authors deal with the subject of contemplative prayer, the deep form of prayer followed in monastic orders. Canfield was probably influenced by the Flemish mystic Jan Ruusbroec. His Way of Perfection began to circulate widely in manuscript and even more widely in unauthorised printed editions. A letter of approbation printed at the beginning of The Rule of Perfection is signed by a number of doctors of the Sorbonne, including Andr√© Duval, who introduced it to Vincent de Paul. Vincent's words, \\"Do not tread on the heels of Providence,\\" are taken from Canfield. This treatise \\"The Will of God\\" was translated into Latin in 1625 by order of the Minister General of the Order.Hess, Lawrence. \\"William Benedict Fytch.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 6. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 24 January 2016 Benet brought out official editions of the first two parts of his work, but unfortunately not of the third, because he sensed stirrings of criticism from orthodox theologians about the boldness of his teachings on the higher levels of prayer. As a result, this third part is known only in its French and Italian translations, in which Benet had incorporated more conventional devotional elements to ensure its acceptability as an ascetical handbook. In this he failed as it was put on the Index of the Catholic Church in 1689 on the grounds that it came too close to the ideas of the Quietists who were then the subject of a major controversy, although it was not considered to be actually heretical. The book was rediscovered by Aldous Huxley in the 1940s and summarised in his book Grey Eminence as an example of the common ground between Eastern and Western mysticism. In the 1950s he came back to the attention of Catholics with the republication of The Lives of Ange De Joyeuse and Benet Canfield (1623), given as by Jacques Brousse, but actually containing a large part of Father Benet's autobiography.

It is one of the largest areas of protected prairie in the Alberta park system, and serves as both a nature preserve and protection for many First Nations (indigenous) rock carvings and paintings. The park is sacred to the Blackfoot and many other aboriginal tribes. On 6 July 2019, Writing-on-Stone / √Å√≠s√≠nai‚Äôpi was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Its UNESCO application was filed under the name √Å√≠s√≠nai ºpi, a Blackfoot language word meaning \\"it is pictured / written\\".https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/1935/ The provincial park is synonymous with the √Å√≠s√≠nai ºpi National Historic Site of Canada.http://www.pc.gc.ca/docs/r/ab/sites/writing-on-stone_E.asp Resources Writing-on-Stone Park contains the greatest concentration of rock art on the North American Great Plains. There are over 50 petroglyph sites and thousands of works. The park also showcases a North-West Mounted Police (NWMP) outpost reconstructed on its original site. The original outpost was burned down by persons unknown after it was closed in 1918. The park features a visitor centre, campgrounds, picnic areas, group-use areas, and hiking trails, as well as canoeing and kayaking on the Milk River. Flora and fauna The park is located in the Milk River Valley. To the south are the volcanic Sweetgrass Hills of Montana. The park comprises of coulee and prairie habitat, and is home to a diverse variety of plants and animals. Bird species include prairie falcons, great horned owls, short-eared owls, American kestrels, and cliff swallows, as well as introduced ring-necked pheasants and grey partridges. The prairie surrounding the park is good habitat for pronghorn antelopes. Other animals found in the park area include mule deer, northern pocket gophers, skunks, raccoons, yellow-bellied marmots, and bobcats. Tiger salamanders, boreal chorus frogs, leopard frogs, and plains spadefoot toads represent the amphibians. Reptiles include garter snakes, bull snakes, and prairie rattlesnakes. The coulee environment is optimal for balsam poplars and narrow leaf cottonwoods. There are also peachleaf willows and plains cottonwoods in the park. Shrubs include chokecherry, juniper, saskatoon, sandbar willow, and two varieties of wild rose. Some of the northernmost species of cactus, including Opuntia (prickly pear) and Pediocactus (pincushion), are found in the park as well. Geologic setting A path winds through hoodoos in the park The sandstone outcrops in the park belong to the Milk River Formation, which was deposited along the edge of a large inland sea about 84 million years ago during the Late Cretaceous epoch.Payenberg, T.D.H., Braman, D.R., Davis, D.W. and Miall, A.D. 2002. Litho- and chronostratigraphic relationships of the Santonian-Campanian Milk River Formation in southern Alberta and the Eagle Formation in Montana utilising stratigraphy, U-Pb geochronology, and palynology, Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences, vol. 39, p. 1553-1577. Meltwater from the retreating glaciers at the end of the last Ice Age carved the present Milk River valley, and water, ice and wind eroded the sandstone to produce the hoodoos and cliffs that are part of the park today. History There is evidence that the Milk River Valley was inhabited by First Nations people as long ago as 9000 years. First Nations tribes such as the Blackfoot probably created many of the rock carvings (petroglyphs) and paintings (pictographs). Other First Nations groups such as the Shoshone also travelled through the valley and may have also created some of the art. These carvings and paintings tell of the lives and journeys of those who created them, and of the spirits they found here. The towering cliffs and hoodoos had a powerful impact on the native visitors, who believed these were the homes of powerful spirits. The shelter of the coulees and the abundance of game and berries made the area that is now the park an excellent location for these nomadic people to stop on their seasonal migrations. While the greatest use of the area was made by those in transit, there is some evidence, including tipi rings and a medicine wheel, that there was some permanent settlement here. Beginning about 1730, large numbers of horses, metal goods, and guns began to appear on the western plains. This signified not only a change in the First Nations lifestyle, but a change in the content of the rock art. Pictures of hunters on horseback, and warriors without body shields began to be created. In 1887 a North-West Mounted Police (the precursor to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police) camp was set up at Writing-on-Stone to attempt to curtail cross-border whisky smuggling, which was devastating the native population, and to put a stop to First Nations horse-raiding parties. But in fact neither problem ever became serious at this outpost, and the NWMP spent most of their time fighting summer grass fires, herding stray American cattle back across the border, and riding hundreds of uneventful kilometres on border patrol. In the period immediately preceding World War I, settlers began to arrive in the area, which helped to alleviate some of the boredom and isolation the NWMP officers faced. In 1918, the outpost was closed, as Canadian authorities felt little possibility of criminal activity along the border, and shortly thereafter, the outpost fell victim to arson by persons unknown. The park was created in 1957 and was designated an archaeological preserve in 1977. As part of the NWMP centennial celebrations, the outpost was reconstructed between 1973 and 1975, and is now one of the attractions in the park. Archaeologists from the Alberta Provincial Parks Department surveyed and catalogued numerous petroglyph and pictograph sites within the park in 1973. In 1981, a portion of the park was named a Provincial Historic Resource to protect this rock art from increasing impact from vandalism and graffiti. The most sensitive areas are now set aside in areas designated for guided tours only. In 1977, the park preserved the archaeology of the pictographs and petroglyphs. This protection makes the park one of the largest concentrations of rock art in the North American Plains.Writing-on-Stone Provincial Park, Park Research and Management Retrieved August 3, 2015 In 2004 Parks Canada added the park to Canada's tentative list of possible world heritage sites. The application indicated that the Blackfoot people would also like the Sweet Grass Hills of Montana included as part of the world heritage site. In March 2005, the park was designated a National Historic Site. On June 20, 2007, the park's new visitor centre, with views of the valley from the north rim, was officially opened.

Hasford served as a combat correspondent with the 1st Marine Division during the Tet Offensive of 1968. As a military journalist, he wrote stories for Leatherneck Magazine, Pacific Stars and Stripes, and Sea Tiger. The novel was later adapted into the film Full Metal Jacket (1987) by Hasford, Michael Herr, and Stanley Kubrick. In 1990, Hasford published the sequel The Phantom Blooper: A Novel of Vietnam. The two books were supposed to be part of a \\"Vietnam Trilogy\\", but Hasford died before writing the third installment.  Plot summary  The book is divided into three sections, written in completely different styles of prose, and follows James T. \\"Joker\\" Davis through his enlistment in the United States Marine Corps and deployment to Vietnam. Joker and his fellow Marines refer to military personnel in various ways. A \\"short\\" service-member, or \\"short-timer\\", is one who is approaching the end of his tour of duty in Vietnam, described in the novel as 385 days for Marines and 365 days for members of other armed services. \\"Lifers\\" are distinguished not necessarily by their length of time served, but rather by their attitude toward the lower ranks. (Joker describes the distinction as follows: \\"A lifer is anybody who abuses authority he doesn't deserve to have. There are plenty of civilian lifers.\\") Finally, the term \\"poges\\" (an alternative spelling for the slang term \\"pogues\\") is short for \\"Persons Other than Grunts\\"‚ÄîMarines who fill non-combat roles such as cooks, clerks, and mechanics. Poges are a favorite target of the front-line troops' derision, and vice versa. =\\"The Spirit of the Bayonet\\"= \\"The Spirit of the Bayonet\\" chronicles Joker's days in recruit training at Parris Island, where a drill instructor, Gunnery Sergeant Gerheim, breaks the men's spirits and then rebuilds them as brutal killers. Here, Joker befriends two recruits nicknamed \\"Cowboy\\" and \\"Gomer Pyle\\". The latter, whose real name is Leonard Pratt, earns the wrath of both Gerheim and the rest of the platoon through his ineptitude and weak character. Though he eventually shows great improvement and wins honors at graduation, the constant abuse unbalances his mind. In a final act of madness, he kills Gerheim and then himself in front of the whole platoon. =\\"Body Count\\"= \\"Body Count\\" shows some of Joker's life as a war correspondent for the Marines in 1968. While in Da Nang, he runs across Cowboy, who is now assistant squad leader in the Lusthog Squad. As the Tet Offensive begins, Joker is dispatched to Phu Bai with his photographer, Rafter Man. Here, Joker unwillingly accepts a promotion from corporal to sergeant, and the two journalists travel to Hu·∫ø to cover the enemy's wartime atrocities and reunite Joker with Cowboy. During a battle, Joker is knocked unconscious by a concussion blast and the book enters a psychedelic dream sequence. When Joker comes to several hours later, he learns that the platoon commander was killed by a friendly grenade, and the squad leader went insane and attacked an NVA position with a BB gun only to be shot down. Later, Joker and Rafter Man battle a sniper who killed another Lusthog Marine and an entire second squad; the battle ends with Rafter Man's first confirmed kill and Cowboy's being wounded slightly. As Joker and Rafter Man head back to their base, Rafter Man panics and dashes into the path of an oncoming tank, which fatally crushes him. Joker is reassigned to Cowboy's squad as a rifleman, as punishment for wearing an unauthorized peace button on his uniform. =\\"Grunts\\"= \\"Grunts\\" takes place on a mission through the jungle with Cowboy's squad, outside of Khe Sanh. They encounter another sniper here, who wounds three of the men multiple times. After the company commander goes crazy and begins babbling nonsense over the radio, Cowboy decides to pull the squad back and retreat, rather than sacrifice everyone trying to save the wounded men. Animal Mother, the squad's M60 machine gunner, threatens Cowboy's life and refuses to retreat. Promoting Joker to squad leader, Cowboy runs in with his pistol and kills each victim with a shot to the head. However, he is repeatedly wounded in the process, and before he can kill himself, the sniper shoots the gun out of his hand. Realizing his duty to Cowboy and the squad, Joker kills Cowboy and leads the rest of the men away. Film adaptation Hasford, Michael Herr, and Stanley Kubrick adapted the novel into the film Full Metal Jacket (1987). The film faithfully reproduces the first section of the novel, \\"The Spirit of the Bayonet\\", with only minor differences in events and names. The most profound difference is that, in the book, when Private Pyle kills Gunny (Gunnery Sergeant) Gerheim (renamed Hartman in the film), Gerheim tells Pyle, \\"I'm proud [of you]\\", before dying, finally satisfied that he transformed Pyle into a killer. The second part of the movie combines certain dialogue and plot elements of \\"Body Count\\" and \\"Grunts\\". For example, the combat in the film takes place in Hu·∫ø, and the platoon does take on a sniper, although the on-screen sequence more closely resembles the sniper battle in \\"Grunts\\". Several important sequences are omitted from the film adaptation, including: a previous meeting between Joker and his squad at the movies, the slaughtering of rats at the camp by Joker and his friends as Rafter Man watches, Rafter Man's lapse into cannibalism, a description of a tank running over a girl and a water buffalo, and a flashback revealing the origins of the nickname Rafter Man (actually named Lance Corporal Compton). In the book, Rafter Man is later run over and killed by the same tank that ran over the girl and water buffalo, and Joker is demoted to a \\"grunt\\" (Basic Rifleman) for wearing his peace symbol button. Additionally, the film adaptation changes some characters' names and omits certain other characters, i.e.: several \\"lifers\\" (Captain January, Major Lynch, and General Motors) have been left out or have been merged into one character; Private Leonard Pratt in the book is renamed Leonard Lawrence in the movie; Gunny Gerheim in the book becomes Gunny Hartman in the movie; and the character of Alice in the book seems to have been renamed and altered slightly to portray Eightball in the movie. In additional divergences from the book, in the film T.H.E. Rock does not die, and Crazy Earl is killed by a booby trap. The book characters Daytona Dave, Chili Vendor, and Mr. Payback appear in the movie, just prior to and during the Tet Offensive, but in the book Daytona Dave is described as a California surfer-type, while in the movie he is played by an African American. Availability According to the Gustav Hasford website maintained by Hasford's cousin Jason Aaron, The Short-Timers, The Phantom Blooper: A Novel of Vietnam, and Hasford's third and last completed book, a noir detective novel titled A Gypsy Good Time (1992), are currently out of print. The texts of the two war novels and an excerpt of A Gypsy Good Time were publicly available at the web-site for at least a decade, but the site has since been redesigned, and Aaron, who manages the site, has stated he \\"likely won't be reposting the novel\\" there as he does not own the rights.

The expedition was jointly led by Theodore Roosevelt, the former President of the United States, and Colonel C√¢ndido Rondon, the Brazilian explorer who had discovered its headwaters in 1909. Sponsored in part by the American Museum of Natural History, they also collected many new animal and insect specimens. The river was eventually named \\"Rio Roosevelt\\" for the former president, who nearly died during the voyage. The Adventure and challenge After losing a bid for a third presidential term in the 1912 election, Roosevelt had originally planned to go on a speaking tour of Argentina and Brazil, followed by a cruise of the Amazon River organized by his friend Father John Augustine Zahm. Instead, the government of Brazil suggested that Roosevelt accompany famous Brazilian explorer C√¢ndido Rondon on his exploration of the previously unknown River of Doubt, the headwaters of which had only recently been discovered. Roosevelt, seeking adventure and challenge after his recent electoral defeat, agreed. Kermit Roosevelt, Theodore's son, had recently become engaged and did not plan on joining the expedition but did on the insistence of his mother, in order to protect his father. The expedition started in C√°ceres, a small town on the Paraguay River, in December 1913. They traveled to Tapirapu√£, where Rondon had previously discovered the headwaters of the River of Doubt. From Tapirapu√£, the expedition traveled northwest, through dense forests and then later through the plains on top of the Parecis plateau. They reached the River of Doubt on February 27, 1914. At this point, due to a lack of food supplies, the Expedition split up, with part of the Expedition, including Father Zahm and expedition quartermaster Anthony Fiala, following the Ji-Paran√° River to the Madeira River. The remaining party - the Roosevelts, Colonel Rondon, American naturalist George Kruck Cherrie, and 15 Brazilian porters (camaradas) - then started down the River of Doubt. Problems Almost from the start, the expedition was fraught with problems. Insects and disease such as malaria weighed heavily on just about every member of the expedition, leaving them in a constant state of sickness, festering wounds and high fevers. The heavy dug- out canoes were unsuitable to the constant rapids and were often lost, requiring days to build new ones. The food provisions were ill-conceived forcing the team on starvation diets. The native Cinta Larga tribe shadowed the expedition and were a constant source of concern ‚Äî the Indians could have at any time wiped out the expedition and taken their valuable metal tools, but they chose to let them pass. (Future expeditions in the 1920s were not so lucky). Of the 19 men who went on the expedition, 16 returned. One died by accidental drowning in rapids (with his body never recovered), one died by murder and was buried at the scene, and the murderer was left behind in the jungle; presumably swiftly perishing there. By the time the expedition had made it only about one-quarter of the way down the river, they were physically exhausted and sick from starvation, disease, and the constant labour of hauling canoes around rapids. By its end, everyone on the expedition except for Colonel Rondon was either sick, injured, or both. Roosevelt himself was near death, having received a gash in his leg that had become infected, and the party feared for his life each day. Luckily, they came upon \\"rubber men\\" or \\"seringueiros\\", impoverished rubber-tappers who earned a marginal living from the forest trees driven by the new demand for rubber tires in the United States. The seringueiros helped the team down the rest of the river (less rapid-prone than the upper reaches). The expedition was reunited on April 26, 1914, with a Brazilian and American relief party led by Lieutenant Antonio Pyrineus, an officer from Rondon's Telegraph Commission. The party had been pre-arranged by Rondon to meet them at the confluence with the Aripuana River, where they had hoped to emerge from the tributary. Medical attention was given to Roosevelt as the group returned to Manaus. Three weeks later, a greatly weakened Roosevelt made it home to a hero's welcome in New York Harbor. His health never fully recovered after the trip, and he died less than five years later.Millard (2005). Confirmation After Roosevelt returned, there was some doubt that he had actually discovered the river and made the expedition. Even though he was still quite weak and barely able to speak above a whisper, Roosevelt, angry that his credibility had been challenged, arranged speaking engagements with the National Geographic Society in Washington, D.C. on May 26, and the Royal Geographical Society in London in mid-June. These appearances largely stifled the criticisms at the time.Millard (2005) To finally settle the dispute, in 1927 British explorer George Miller Dyott led a second trip down the river, confirming Roosevelt's discoveries.\\"River of Doubt\\", Time Magazine, June 6, 1927. In 1992 a third (modern) expedition was organized and led by Charles Haskell and Elizabeth McKnight, and sponsored in part by the Theodore Roosevelt Association, the American Museum of Natural History, the National Wildlife Federation and a private trust set up by Haskell and McKnight.\\"In T. R.'s Footsteps, Scientists Embark on Amazonian Expedition\\", \\"Explorers of Amazon Branch Retrace Roosevelt Expedition\\" This expedition consisted of a total of twenty persons including Roosevelt's great- grandson Tweed Roosevelt, professional river guides Joe Willie Jones, Kelley Kalafatich, Jim Slade, and Mike Boyle, photographers Carr Clifton and Mark Greenburg, cinematographer Joe Kaminsky, Haskell's son Charles 'Chip' Haskell Jr. who served as the expedition's communications expert, Brazilian scientists Geraldo Mendes dos Santos and Jo√£o Ferraz (ichthyologist and pharmacologist), and chiefs Oita Mina and Tatatar√© of the Cinta Larga tribe whose land borders much of the river. The expedition took 33 days to complete the nearly 1000 mile journey. Whereas the Roosevelt-Rondon Expedition had to portage almost all of the many rapids on the river with their heavy dugout canoes, the Haskel-McKnight Expedition was able to safely navigate all of the rapids except for one which was portaged. Haskell reported that his expedition \\"found spots chronicled by the original team, saw plants and insects they described, and went down the rapids that crushed the dugout canoes of 1914\\". The expedition members were awarded the Theodore Roosevelt Association's Distinguished Service Medal for their achievement.\\"Distinguished Service Medal\\" A documentary of the expedition was subsequently produced and aired on PBS called the New Explorers: The River of Doubt narrated by Bill Kurtis and Wilford Brimley.\\"The New Explorers: River of Doubt\\" Since this time, the expedition has inspired others to undergo its challenges such as Materials Scientist Professor Marc A.

Located in the municipality of Tamuning, it is the center of Guam's tourist industry. History A defensive fortification but into coastal rock during the Japanese occupation of Guam Tumon Bay or Agana Bay are the most likely locations that Ferdinand Magellan dropped anchor on March 6, 1521, though there was little further contact for the next 150 years. When the Spanish Empire colonized Guam in 1668, Tomhom was one of the most prominent villages. The first Roman Catholic missionaries to the island, the Jesuit Padre (P√•l√©), the Spanish priest Blessed Diego Luis de San Vitores and his sacristan, the Visayan Saint Pedro Calungsod were killed in Tumon by the village chief Mata'pang after San Vitores had baptised the chief's daughter without permission, but with mother's permission. A park and statue mark the site of De San Vitores and Calungsod's martyrdom along the beach, while a nearby Catholic parish church dedicated to De San Vitores lies along Tumon's main road, which was also named in his honor. A small tunnel through a large rock on the tourist beach overlooking the bay was part of the defensive positions prepared by the Japanese occupiers during World War II. The American forces landed in a different location during the 1944 Battle of Guam and the Tumon defenses were not tested. Today, dozens of hotels in addition to shopping centers, water parks, night clubs, and other attractions can be found along the sandy beaches of Tumon Bay, which was recently made a marine preserve. Tumon is served by Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport in Tamuning. Politics Tumon Bay and Hotel Row, 2010 As the center of Guam's tourist industry, Tumon often has issues that lead to political debates. A recurring one concerns whether adult entertainment businesses should remain in the area. Another involves propositions to legalize gambling on Guam which would lead to casinos in the area. Due to the area's economic importance, extensive public works projects often take place in Tumon leading some politicians to be both applauded and criticized for the disproportionate funding given the region. Tumon is part of the municipality of Tamuning-Tumon-Harmon, which is governed by an elected mayor. Transportation and communications The main source of public transportation in the district is through the bus or taxi service, while Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport is located in neighbouring Barrigada to the southeast. The Guam Telephone Authority also operates in the area. Most of the island is powered through power poles; however, Tumon is the only village on the island to have underground power lines. Economy Tumon is Guam's economic center. Tourism makes up more than half the economy of the island. Tourists flock to the shopping centers each day to local malls and shopping centers in the area. In 2005, the Guam Visitors Bureau recorded that over 1.2 million visitors visited the island that year. Shopping The Plaza shopping center Tumon, as Guam's premier shopping district, has many malls and shopping arcades to choose from such as: *Duty Free Galleria (DFS) *Acanta Mall *Tumon Sands Plaza *The Plaza *JP Superstore Because of all the luxury shops and midscale stores in the city, Tumon is often called \\"the Paris of the Pacific\\". Activities Tunnel aquarium in Tumon Tourists flock to the beaches to enjoy the clear water and a day full of activities. Popular attractions include shopping. The central area of Hotel Row is home to the largest tunnel aquarium in the world, an attraction known as the Daring Sling Shot (riders are strapped into a ball that's shot upward on a wire and brought back down), and the popular Magic on Ice Show at the Sand Castle. Now Tumon is viewed by some as a \\"mini-Waikiki\\", with Hawaiian style fire dances. There are also many Chamorro shows available. The beaches in Tumon are all wildlife preserves. Fishing is allowed in certain areas, but fishermen must stand on the beach to cast their nets or fishing lines. Walking into the water to fish is illegal. One big Tourist Shopping location is Micronesia Mall, which has expanded and added a food court and a Macy's as the sole anchor store. Another big shopping location is a 24-hour Kmart, which is as big as any standard Kmart on the mainland US. Parking is frequently full and there is parking on the roof. Both Micronesia Mall and Kmart are off Hotel Row, with buses frequently running between the shops and the hotels. Nightlife and entertainment Tumon has many dance clubs, several strip clubs and much more to offer. The largest dance center in the city is The Globe. The Sandcastle is a Las Vegas-style attraction, with magic shows featuring tigers, flamingos and other exotic animals. There is currently a debate in the area on the subject of \\"adult entertainment\\". Some contend the strip clubs bring in much needed tourist dollars, while others believe they scare away families. Education Guam Public School System serves the island. Currently only two schools serve the village of Tumon. They are John F. Kennedy High School & Chief Brodie Elementary. Ecology Map of benthic cover at Tumon Bay Marine Preserve In 1986 the Guam Division of Aquatic and Wildlife Resources determined that fish stocks had seriously declined in the previous 15 years and began the process of setting aside areas around Guam with limited take. In the 1990s, as hotels filled up the beachfront property along Tumon Bay, the bay was dredged by the hotel community to remove the seaweed that frequently washed ashore and \\"despoiled the beauty\\" of the beach. Guam established five marine preserves including one in Tumon Bay, which began to be strictly enforced in 2001. The Tumon Bay Marine Preserve is a broad cresent from the cliffs of \\"Hospital Point\\" in the south to \\"Gun Point.\\" The Preserve is roughly two miles long and the reef platform separating the open ocean from the calm bay is up to 1450 feet wide. The Tumon Bay preserve comprises 9.2% of all marine protected area on Guam. In a 2009 study, 18% of the preserve was coral, 10% was seaweed, and 1% was seagrasses. Arrests for illegal fishing in Tumon continue to be made. It will take many years for the seaweed and fish to come back to their previous levels. The beach along Hotel Row was also covered with rocks, many of which were removed as well. The coral reef fringing Tumon Bay suffers from nutrient infusion and algal blooms associated with fresh water seepage from hotels along the beach. The fresh water is likely coming from irrigation systems used by the hotels to maintain tropical garden landscaping around the hotel. The freshwater can be seen leaching into the bay at low tide. Further evidence is the very visible algal blooms created by the nutrient rich fresh water. Northern Tumon Two Lovers Point can be seen from all of Tumon. The northern part of Tumon Bay is the busiest and the most populous part of the Tumon Bay districts. Most of the hotels in Tumon are located in this area, including Hotel Nikko Guam, Okura, Westin, Ohana Bayview, Ohana Oceanview, Tumon Bay Capitol, Outrigger, Hyatt, and Pia Marine. This section is also expecting an economic boom due to the arrival of the US military. Many new tall high-rise buildings are being constructed over the next few years, including infrastructure upgrades and an addition of many new shopping centers. Many of the new high-rises in the northern Tumon area include, the Bayview 5, The Two Lovers Point Towers, a high-rise near the Westin, the Baldyga shopping center, the expansion of Underwater world and more projects expected to go up soon.

It is situated about south-west of Driffield town centre and is on the A614 road. The civil parish is formed by the village of Kirkburn and the hamlets of Eastburn, Kelleythorpe and Southburn. According to the 2011 UK census, Kirkburn parish had a population of 903, an increase on the 2001 UK census figure of 492. History The Kirkburn Sword, kept in the British Museum. The village was originally known as Westburn at the time of the Domesday Book and the name was changed to Kirkburn after the building of St Mary's Church in the village between 1130 and 1155. \\"Kirk\\" means \\"church\\". The church was restored in the 19th century by John Loughborough Pearson and George Edmund Street. In 1966 the church was designated a Grade I listed building and it is now recorded in the National Heritage List for England and maintained by Historic England. It is on the Sykes Churches Trail devised by the East Yorkshire Churches Group. An important archaeological relic was found in 1987 during the excavation of a nearby Iron Age grave and dated to the 3rd century BC. The Kirkburn Sword, as it became known, is described by the British Museum as \\"probably the finest Iron Age sword in Europe\\". Its handle is made up of 37 pieces of iron, bronze and horn and decorated with red glass. Its scabbard is made of iron and polished bronze, decorated with a scroll pattern in La T√®ne style, with red glass studs and insets. Also in the British Museum are Celtic Iron Age finds from a chariot burial discovered only away from the man who was buried with the Kirkburn sword. They include an ornately decorated pair of linchpins from the axle. From 1890 until 1954 Kirkburn was served by Southburn railway station on the Selby to Driffield Line.

It also encompasses the fields of robotics and neuroscience. Biomechatronic devices encompass a wide range of applications from the development of prosthetic limbs to engineering solutions concerning respiration, vision, and the cardiovascular system. How it works Biomechatronics mimics how the human body works. For example, four different steps must occur to be able to lift the foot to walk. First, impulses from the motor center of the brain are sent to the foot and leg muscles. Next the nerve cells in the feet send information, providing feedback to the brain, enabling it to adjust the muscle groups or amount of force required to walk across the ground. Different amounts of force are applied depending on the type of surface being walked across. The leg's muscle spindle nerve cells then sense and send the position of the floor back up to the brain. Finally, when the foot is raised to step, signals are sent to muscles in the leg and foot to set it down. =Biosensors= Biosensors are used to detect what the user wants to do or their intentions and motions. In some devices the information can be relayed by the user's nervous system or muscle system. This information is related by the biosensor to a controller which can be located inside or outside the biomechatronic device. In addition biosensors receive information about the limb position and force from the limb and actuator. Biosensors come in a variety of forms. They can be wires which detect electrical activity, needle electrodes implanted in muscles, and electrode arrays with nerves growing through them. =Mechanical sensors= The purpose of the mechanical sensors is to measure information about the biomechatronic device and relate that information to the biosensor or controller. =Controller= The controller in a biomechatronic device relays the user's intentions to the actuators. It also interprets feedback information to the user that comes from the biosensors and mechanical sensors. The other function of the controller is to control the biomechatronic device's movements. =Actuator= The actuator is an artificial muscle. Its job is to produce force and movement. Depending on whether the device is orthotic or prosthetic the actuator can be a motor that assists or replaces the user's original muscle. Research Biomechatronics is a rapidly growing field but as of now there are very few labs which conduct research. The Shirley Ryan AbilityLab (formerly the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago), University of California at Berkeley, MIT, Stanford University, and University of Twente in the Netherlands are the researching leaders in biomechatronics. Three main areas are emphasized in the current research. #Analyzing human motions, which are complex, to aid in the design of biomechatronic devices #Studying how electronic devices can be interfaced with the nervous system. #Testing the ways to use living muscle tissue as actuators for electronic devices =Analyzing motions= A great deal of analysis over human motion is needed because human movement is very complex. MIT and the University of Twente are both working to analyze these movements. They are doing this through a combination of computer models, camera systems, and electromyograms. =Interfacing= Interfacing allows biomechatronics devices to connect with the muscle systems and nerves of the user in order send and receive information from the device. This is a technology that is not available in ordinary orthotics and prosthetics devices. Groups at the University of Twente and University of Malaya are making drastic steps in this department. Scientists there have developed a device which will help to treat paralysis and stroke victims who are unable to control their foot while walking. The researchers are also nearing a breakthrough which would allow a person with an amputated leg to control their prosthetic leg through their stump muscles. =MIT research= Hugh Herr is the leading biomechatronic scientist at MIT. Herr and his group of researchers are developing a sieve integrated circuit electrode and prosthetic devices that are coming closer to mimicking real human movement. The two prosthetic devices currently in the making will control knee movement and the other will control the stiffness of an ankle joint. Robotic fish As mentioned before Herr and his colleagues made a robotic fish that was propelled by living muscle tissue taken from frog legs. The robotic fish was a prototype of a biomechatronic device with a living actuator. The following characteristics were given to the fish. * A styrofoam float so the fish can float * Electrical wires for connections * A silicone tail that enables force while swimming * Power provided by lithium batteries * A microcontroller to control movement * An infrared sensor enables the microcontroller to communicate with a handheld device * Muscles stimulated by an electronic unit =Arts research= New media artists at UCSD are using biomechatronics in performance art pieces, such as Technesexual (more information, photos, video), a performance which uses biometric sensors to bridge the performers' real bodies to their Second Life avatars and Slapshock (more information, photos,video), in which medical TENS units are used to explore intersubjective symbiosis in intimate relationships. Growth The demand for biomechatronic devices are at an all- time high and show no signs of slowing down. With increasing technological advancement in recent years, biomechatronic researchers have been able to construct prosthetic limbs that are capable of replicating the functionality of human appendages. Such devices include the \\"i-limb\\", developed by prosthetic company Touch Bionics, the first fully functioning prosthetic hand with articulating joints, as well as Herr's PowerFoot BiOM, the first prosthetic leg capable of simulating muscle and tendon processes within the human body. Biomechatronic research has also helped further research towards understanding human functions. Researchers from Carnegie Mellon and North Carolina State have created an exoskeleton that decreases the metabolic cost of walking by around 7 percent. Many biomechatronic researchers are closely collaborating with military organizations. The US Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Defense are giving funds to different labs to help soldiers and war veterans. Despite the demand, however, biomechatronic technologies struggle within the healthcare market due to high costs and lack of implementation into insurance policies. Herr claims that Medicare and Medicaid specifically are important \\"market-breakers or market-makers for all these technologies,\\" and that the technologies will not be available to everyone until the technologies get a breakthrough. Biomechatronic devices, although improved, also still face mechanical obstructions, suffering from inadequate battery power, consistent mechanical reliability, and neural connections between prosthetics and the human body.

The Act merged the Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer), which had responsibility for naval aircraft and related systems, and the Bureau of Ordnance (BuOrd), which had responsibility for naval weapons. As aviation technology became increasingly complex after World War II, the Navy increasingly realized the need for better integration between its aircraft and aerial weapons. This was also to end the conflict between bureaus due to technological convergence; BuOrd's work in guided missiles, for example, was overlapping with BuAer's work on unmanned aircraft. BuWeps was under the command of a two-star admiral known as the Chief, BuWeps. Four individuals served in this position: *RADM Paul D. Stroop - September 10, 1959 ‚Äì October 29, 1962 *RADM Kleber S.

A handrail is a rail that is designed to be grasped by the hand so as to provide stability or support. Handrails are commonly used while ascending or descending stairways and escalators in order to prevent injurious falls. Handrails are typically supported by posts or mounted directly to walls. Similar items not covered in this article include bathroom handrails‚Äîwhich help to prevent falls on slippery, wet floors‚Äîother grab bars, used, for instance, in ships' galleys, and barres, which serve as training aids for ballet dancers. Guard rails and balustrades line drop-offs and other dangerous areas, keeping people and vehicles out. History On a staircase which has no banisters to support a handrail, then, as illustrated here, a handrail may be fixed to the wall. Termination of a Handrail at the Museum of Natural History, G√∂rlitz, Germany The oldest known handrail was uncovered by French archaeologist Pierre St. Jamaine in an Assyrian ruin in southern Iraq in the city-state Nippur.  British specifications  British Standard and British Standard Code of Practice are harmonized to European Normal (EN) series. Handrail height is set between .  Dimensions (US)  Various model codes‚ÄîThe International Code Council (ICC) and National Fire Protection Association (NFPA)‚Äîand accessibility standards‚ÄîANSI A117.1 and the Americans With Disabilities Act Standards for Accessible Design (ADASAD)‚Äîrefer to handrail dimensions. Current versions of these codes and standards now agree that handrail is defined as either a circular cross section with an outside diameter of minimum and maximum or a non-circular cross section with a perimeter dimension of minimum and maximum and a cross section dimension of ) maximum. In addition, the International Residential Code (IRC) includes a definition of a \\"Type II\\" handrail that allows for handrail with a perimeter dimension greater than . The IRC and residential portion of the 2009 IBC define Type II handrail as follows: > Type II. Handrails with a perimeter greater than shall provide a graspable > finger recess area on both sides of the profile. The finger recess shall > begin within a distance of measured vertically from the tallest portion of > the profile and achieve a depth of at least within below the widest portion > of the profile.

The minimum > width of the handrail above the recess shall be to a maximum of . Edges > shall have a minimum radius of . Handrails are located at a height between . In areas where children are the principal users of a building or facility, the 2010 ADASAD recommends that a second set of handrails at a maximum height of measured to the top of the gripping surface from the ramp surface or stair nosing can assist in preventing accidents.  Clearance (US) The distance between the wall and handrail gripping surface is also governed by local code with the most common requirement being minimum. The National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) require that the distance between the wall and handrail be a minimum of . The 1992 Americans With Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG) stated that there was to be an absolute dimension of between a handrail and a wall. This was actually a \\"grab bar\\" dimension which was part of the 1986 ANSI A117.1. ANSI changed the notation to minimum in 1990. This was not corrected in 2010 with the approval of the new ADASAD which now calls for a minimum clearance. Codes also generally require that there be a clearance between the underside of the handrail and any obstruction‚Äîincluding the horizontal bracket arm. There is an allowance however for variations in the handrail size‚Äîfor every of additional perimeter dimension over , may be subtracted from the clearance requirement.  Strength (US)  Handrails are to support a continuous load of or a concentrated load of applied at the top of the handrail.  ADA height notations  = Adult requirements = Top of gripping surfaces of handrails shall be between vertically above walking surfaces, stair nosings, and ramp surfaces. Handrails shall be at a consistent height above walking surfaces, stair nosings, and ramp surfaces. = Child recommendation = When children are the principal users in a building or facility (e.g., elementary schools), a second set of handrails at an appropriate height can assist them and aid in preventing accidents.

Common shapes are flat, rounded edge, and tubular in horizontal railings, whereas tetraform spear-headed or ball-finialled are most common in vertical railings around homes. Park and garden railings commonly in metalworking feature swirls, leaves, plate metal areas and/or motifs particularly on and beside gates. High security railings (particularly if in flat metal then a type of palisade) may instead feature jagged points and most metals are well-suited to anti-climb paint. A handrail is less restrictive on its own than a guard rail and provides support. Guardrails also apply in a technology context.

A cast iron grille of decorative railings interspersed by weighty columns in St Petersburg Many public spaces are fitted with guard rails as a means of protection against accidental falls. Any abrupt change in elevation where the higher portion is accessible makes a fall possible. Due to this responsibility and liability, rails are placed to protect people using the premises. Guardrails in the US are generally required by code where there is a drop of or more. Examples of this are both architectural and environmental. Environmental guard rails are placed along hiking trails where adjacent terrain is steep. Railings may also be located at scenic overlooks. Guard rails in buildings can be numerous, and are required by building codes in many circumstances. Handrails along stairways are common known as a balustrade where filled out below, and catwalks (a type of footbridge) and balconies are also lined with them. An example of a common residential guard rail (US) handrail (Brit.) is a wood railing around a deck or patio. In the US this is typically built on-site from pressure treated lumber thus featuring a simplistic design of vertical baluster spaced every 3.5\\" demonstrating compliance with Building Codes (Standards). Cable railings typically use stainless steel cables strung horizontally. Glass balusters and glass panels open the view while still providing safety, as at the Grand Canyon Skywalk. With the increasing popularity of composite lumber for decking, manufacturers, like TimberTech are providing composite railing components. Wrought iron is another choice that is traditional and sturdy. Decorative examples are considered ironwork. Building codes also require that no opening in a guard be of a size such that a 4\\" sphere may pass. There are three exceptions according to the 2003 International Building Code Section 1012.3 which allow openings to not exceed 8\\" or 21\\" depending on occupancy groups or special areas. A major architect imaginitively used handrails representing social stability, Alvar Aalto. The guard rails of an observation tower such as the Space Needle or Eiffel Tower become exaggerated to the point of becoming a fence or cage. This is also done on bridges and overpasses to prevent accidents and suicides.  Facility safety  Guardrail protecting expensive machinery The majority of safety guardrails used in industrial workplaces are made from fabricated steel. Steel guardrail was originally developed by Armco (The American Rolling Mill Company) in 1933 as highway guardrail but is often used in the factories and warehouses of the industrial sector, despite not being intended for this application. Simultaneously, another version of steel guardrail was developed by Kee Clamp Steel for restraining cattle in the agriculture industry, this was released in 1934 and, like Armco guardrail, is still often used in industrial environments. Box beam steel and I-beam steel are other examples of fabricated steel commonly used to make safety guardrails. As governments around the world courted the voting power of working people and trade unions in the 1980s, the health and safety rights of workers became of greater importance. This set the governmental procedures in motion that would see a flurry of regulations and legislation around workplace safety being introduced in industrialized countries in the 1990s. In the US and UK, these introductions, combined with the demonstrable success of the Occupational Safety and Health Act 1970 (US), and Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 (UK), led to workplace safety being taken more seriously at industrial facilities. Businesses worldwide began to see the value of effective workplace safety, in both the direct commercial sense of protecting assets, but also in the improved productivity levels of a protected workforce. Part of this increase in desire for industrial workplace protection, was a growth in demand for safety guardrails. In the US, under OSHA Standard 1910.28(b)(15), employees who work on surfaces that are 4 feet (1.2 m) or higher off of the ground must have personal fall protection systems in place, such as handrails or guardrails. Although the OSHA standard calls for a guardrail or guardrail system to protect workers on elevated work areas, current industry terminology would refer to that type of safety system as a handrail system or safety rail system. The term \\"guardrail\\" as used in industry and distribution facilities refers to floor mounted systems consisting of horizontal rails attached to upright posts that resemble outdoor highway guardrail. The facility safety guardrails control in-plant vehicular traffic and protect areas where errant vehicle contact may cause harm to property or personnel. Common uses for guardrail systems may be along an aisle or building wall. Often guardrails are placed around equipment installations to prevent inadvertent contact from lift trucks. The guardrail provides a safety barrier preventing lift trucks or other in-plant vehicles from traveling into equipment, building walls, or personnel. There are different types of ‚Äúindustrial‚Äù or ‚Äúfacility safety‚Äù guardrail systems, each with its own advantages. = Types of guardrail =  Steel Ribbed Rail  Steel facility guardrail in warehouse The most common industrial or facility safety guardrail systems are constructed of steel, where the upright posts are made of heavy wall steel tubing-either round or square, with heavy gauge ribbed steel rails mechanically attached to the uprights by bolts or other fasteners. The uprights may be welded to baseplates and anchored to the floor, or set and concreted into the floor. In industrial and distribution facilities the steel guardrail systems provide solid protection for property and personnel by restricting and controlling where in-plant vehicular traffic may operate. These guardrail systems also serve as a warning for people to be aware of hazardous in facility vehicular traffic. Some facility safety steel guardrail systems utilize one horizontal rail, where others employ two or three rails. While a single rail safety guardrail located some 15 inches (38 cm) above floor level may be sufficient to control vehicle traffic, it could present a trip hazard to pedestrians since it is not as noticeable as a double or triple guardrail system where the top rail is some 40 inches (1.0 m) above the floor level. Manufacturers produce several grades of steel safety guardrail. Each grade is suited to a different application which may be determined by size and type of vehicles used in the facility, the volume of traffic to be controlled, or the value/risk associated with the areas being guarded.  Polymer Guardrail  Flexible polymer guardrail with handrail for pedestrians and high strength lower rail to absorb vehicle impacts In 1992 a yellow polymer cover sleeve for steel guardrails was introduced by a Detroit-based company which enhanced the visibility of steel safety guardrails in industrial environments and removed the need for continual repainting.This statement needs a reference This polymer cover was the beginning of polymer guardrail in the industrial environment. At the turn of the 21st century, several companies developed safety products constructed with polymer designed specifically for industrial environments and in 2001 a dedicated industrial alternative to steel guardrail was invented by a British-based company, and thus the first fixed flexible polymer safety guardrail was introduced to the market. In the early 2000s, an Italian company added a version of a polymer bumper providing small bumpers for walls and equipment in the food industry. A Belgian company also introduced a flexible barrier in 2010 and in 2014 a US based company introduced a hybrid polymer-steel guardrail for industrial environments. There are many types of polymer used in manufacturing safety guardrail. Polymer grains may be blended as part of the production process in order to enhance the natural properties of polymer in different ways. The most common types of polymer used are: polyethylene, polypropylene, and polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Using these types of polymer, there are three basic design philosophies for polymer guardrails: * Impact Dispersal, which applies multi-component engineering to enable guardrails to bend on impact, absorbing and dispersing energy, before returning to their original shape. * Hybrid, which features a steel core encased in polymer. * Central Fix, which utilizes a solid polymer post fixed into the ground with cement and steel subterranean fixings. The Polymer Impact Dispersal Safety Guardrail design offers an advantage over steel guardrails. Steel guardrails, if impacted with sufficient energy, will permanently deform and require repair or replacement to the impacting vehicle, the guardrail itself, and even the floor substrate. Where the Impact Dispersal Safety Guardrail design allows the guardrail to bend on impact, disperse the energy, and return to its original shape. Resulting in no damage to the guardrail or the impacting vehicle. = Test Standards for Industrial or Facility Safety Guardrail = Until 2017 there were no accepted standards for how safety guardrail tests were conducted, or how the results were communicated. In 2017, the BSI (British Standards Institution) published the publicly available specification, PAS 13:2017 Code of Practice for safety barriers used in traffic management within workplace environments with test methods for safety barrier impact resilience (commonly referred to as PAS13). This outlines test method guidelines for comparing like-for-like guardrail products, as well as being the current best practice traffic management procedures for a workplace and providing a standard for the safety guardrails within them. In the US, there is no ANSI (American National Standards Institute) Standard(American National Standards Institute) for testing guardrails. Steel guardrail system manufacturers test their systems to withstand impacts from a 10,000-pound load moving at four miles per hour, whereas manufacturers of polymer safety guardrail systems rate and test their products at varying impact levels due to variation in guardrail product systems they offer, which can range from simple low impact energy pedestrian guardrail systems to high impact energy industrial traffic guardrail systems. In order to standardize testing for both steel and polymer guardrails, the Protective Guarding Manufacturers Association (ProGMA) industry group of the Material Handing Industry (MHI) trade association is currently working with ANSI to develop an industry endorsed testing and reporting standard.  Automotive safety  A24). A removable guardrail as median barrier In traffic engineering, highway guardrail may prevent an errant vehicle from hitting roadside obstacles which may be either man-made (sign structures, culvert inlets, utility poles) or natural (trees, rock croppings), running off the road and going down a steep embankment, or veering off the roadway into oncoming traffic (commonly referred to as a median barrier). Roadside obstacles are typically referred to as fixed objects. A secondary objective is keeping the vehicle upright while deflected along the guardrail. Variables such as motorist speed and vehicle orientation when striking the guardrail are crucial factors in the effectiveness of guardrail performance. The most common type of guardrail in use today is the Blocked-Out W-beam (Strong Post).Roadside Design Guide, 4th Edition 2011, AASHTO Strong-post W-beam guardrail consists of wood posts and wood blockouts or steel posts with wood or plastic blockouts. The wood or plastic blockouts reduce or minimize a vehicle snagging on the posts upon impact. In addition, a blockout may be used to increase the offset of guardrail with an obstacle such as a curb.The posts' primary purpose is to maintain the height of the guardrail during the initial stages of post deflection. Maintaining guardrail height also reduces the potential for a vehicle to vault over the guardrail upon initial impact. The posts also play a role in the amount of resistance and deflection a guardrail may experience during impact. Resistance in a strong post system results from a combination of tensile and flexural stiffness of the rail and the bending and shearing resistance of the posts. One of the main concerns with strong- post W-beam guardrail has been the ability of the system to contain and redirect modern vehicles that have a higher center of gravity along with the increased weight of those vehicles. The problem with this is that a guardrail of the optimum height for a car might not keep a truck from toppling over it, while a motorbike might slip under a higher rail. To address these concerns, significant research and development of a system that could contain and redirect vehicles of varying weights and heights was developed and crash tested (both controlled and simulated). As a result, the Midwest Guardrail System (MGS) was developed and successfully crash tested per NCHRP Report 350 TL-3 criteria. MGS has a higher mounting height, uses larger posts and blockouts as compared to the strong-post W-beam guardrail. One other significant difference is that MGS rail splices occur at mid-span compared to at the posts like the strong-post w-beam guardrail. In most cases, guardrail would not be able to withstand the impact of a vehicle just by the strength of the individual posts in the area hit by the vehicle. Guardrail functions as a system with the guardrail, posts, connection of the rail to the posts and to each other, and the end anchors (or terminals) all playing an integral role in how the guardrail will function upon impact. Soil conditions, height of rail, presence of curb or dike, weight of impacting vehicle, distance from back of post to hinge point and depth of post within soil can all determine how well the system will function upon impact. Guardrail is effectively one strong band that transfers the force of the vehicle to the rail elements, posts, and end terminals or anchors. A run of guardrail must be anchored at each terminating end either by transitioning the rail into a fixed anchor such as a bridge rail or with an end terminal or end anchor placed in the ground or within an embankment. Newer concrete barriers, while usually strong enough to withstand direct hits by cars, still work on a similar principle in deflecting heavier vehicles such as trucks. Though they have usually prevented far more serious accidents, guardrail is considered a roadside obstacle as well and transportation engineers must weigh whether placing guardrail will reduce the severity of an impact as compared to what may be impacted if the guardrail were not placed. In general, the minimum length of guardrail with an end anchor at the trailing end and an end terminal on the approach end will be 62.5 to 75 feet in length. An example would be where an overhead roadside sign structure is placed within what is considered the clear recovery zone ‚Äî An engineer would need to determine that the structure has a potential to be impacted and the impact of a vehicle with that structure would be much more severe than impacting the guardrail. Guardrail has frequently ranked amongst the highest sources of injury and fatality collisions with a fixed-object crash. Among the primary reasons for this is the type of treatment used at the end of the guardrail facing oncoming traffic. Most end terminal designs will either gate and allow a vehicle to pass through the system within the first 12.5 feet or redirect a vehicle if impacted beyond the first 12.5 feet. Some end terminals also have energy absorbing properties when impacted in the head on position, and will actually slow a vehicle upon impact by absorbing the vehicles kinetic energy and dispersing it through the rail. This is typically accomplished by forcing rail elements through an extrusion impact head that has smaller dimensions that the rail being forced through it. The force rate and flattening of the rail through the head absorbs kinetic energy dissipating it through the extrusion head and slowing the vehicle. These types of systems have demonstrated that an errant vehicle, impacting a system in the head on position, can be effectively stopped in a distance of 50 feet or less. As compared to non-energy absorbing end terminals which can allow a vehicle to pass through the system and travel in excess of 250 feet behind and beyond the system. Guardrail is intended to deflect. The amount of deflection is dependent on a number of factors some of which include type and weight of impacting vehicle, height the guardrail is placed, type of soil the posts may be embedded within, length of embedment of the posts, and distance of the hinge point to the face of guardrail are just a few. A guardrail that deflects significantly can causes pocketing which has the potential to snag a vehicle which may cause it to flip or roll, or cause the rail to fail allowing a vehicle to penetrate the guardrail. Modern installations of guardrail are designed to allow the guiderail to deform under the load of the crash, and safely redirecting a vehicle back onto the roadway at a somewhat shallow angle. It is important that the approach grades to a guardrail system be very flat (typically 10:1 or flatter) and that grades and fixed objects behind guardrail be placed at a distance so that it will not affect the performance of the guardrail upon impact and deflection. Absorption is when the force of impact is directly transferred between the vehicle and guardrail, which may cause the end to puncture the vehicle. This is most common where a \\"whale tail\\" or blunt end treatment exists. To mitigate this a number of guiderail end treatments exist such as \\"Extruder end treatments\\", \\"eccentric loaders\\" and \\"Driveway wrap treatments\\" which result in blunt ends rarely being left exposed in modern installations. Lastly, a vehicle can become airborne upon striking a guardrail with a buried end treatment if the slope to which the end anchor is buried is relatively flat (3:1 or flatter), which may negate the purpose of the guardrail, if the vehicle continues beyond the guardrail and strikes the object the guardrail was protecting. Additionally, an airborne vehicle is likely to collide in a manner that the vehicle was not designed for, increasing the risk of failure in the vehicle's collision safety systems. Guardrail will have some give and deflection upon impact. The amount of deflection depends on many factors of which speed and weight of vehicle, type of guardrail installed, height of rail, length of posts, soil conditions and a number of other factors can all play a role. Guardrail must be installed so that it is not so rigid that the rail will fail upon impact or the posts will snap off at the point where they are embedded within the ground. Transportation engineers limit the amount of guardrail placed as much as possible, as guardrails should only be placed when the roadside conditions pose a greater threat than the guardrail itself. In fact, in the hierarchy of five roadside safety treatments, shielding with guardrails ranks fourth. Therefore, while guardrails are often added as a retrofit to existing roads, newer roads are designed to minimize roadside obstacles, whether that may include aligning a road on a smoother curve or filling in a ravine which would eliminate the need for guardrail altogether. In addition to new research into end treatments, public awareness among both drivers and engineers has been gradually reducing injuries and fatalities due to guardrails. There are four general types of guardrail, ranging from weakest and inexpensive to strongest and expensive; cable and wood posts, steel and wood/metal posts, steel box- beam, and concrete barriers. While cheaper guardrail is the weakest, often being destroyed from the impact of a light vehicle, it is inexpensive and quick to repair, so this is frequently used in low-traffic rural areas. On the other hand, concrete barriers can usually withstand direct hits from a larger variety of vehicle types, making them well suited for use on high volume routes such as freeways. While rarely damaged, they would be considerably more expensive and time-consuming to repair. Concrete barriers are frequently installed in the median, being expected to withstand frequent impacts from both sides, while the shoulders of the road often have cheaper guardrail. Although the use of concrete barriers on the right side of highway is becoming a much for frequent occurrence in areas where guardrail may be sustaining frequent impacts and the ability for maintenance repairs may be restricted by the general area or work windows due to high traffic volumes for most of the day.  Traffic dangers  In cities occasionally pedestrian railings (and barriers) are installed at the immediate side of a roads however cyclists have died when crushed against them by motor vehicles. Close \\"safety barriers\\" to roads have been found to increase the chances of injury to pedestrians for a number of reasons including increasing inattention of drivers and pedestrians. For these reasons some councils in the United Kingdom have removed their pedestrian railings. This was after London's Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea did so and found that the rate of injury to pedestrians decreased three times faster than elsewhere in the city. The removal of barriers divorcing wheeled traffic from pedestrians is an essential of the shared space paradigm and philosophy in urban design. Security barriers have been introduced on a number of the world's major bridges and around key areas of congregation.  Railways  Railway trackage has guard rails (aka check rails) to guide wheels through possible catch points on turnouts or diamonds. Similarly, guard rails may be installed inside the innermost running rails on very sharp curves. The other most common usage is to prevent damage to other structures, especially bridges, in a derailment.  Technology  In a technology context, a guardrail is an artifact that defines the boundaries in which technology change can be executed in a manner that is aligned with organisational strategy, risk, architecture, operational and cyber security requirements. Examples of technology guardrails are: * Principles * Policies * Strategies * Technical Standards * Patterns * Guidelines * Reference Architectures (conceptual, logical, physical) Each of these guardrails constrain what technology teams can do within approved boundaries (the scope of the guardrail). For example, a technology standard may define a certain database as the standard to use within an organisation. The approved standard would have a commercial agreement, operational and delivery capability established, functional and non-functional fit for purpose assessments undertaken, and a cyber security assessment completed. Technology delivery teams are constrained by the Guardrail to use that particular database technology, but can do so confidently for the scenarios in which usage has been defined and approved. If a technology delivery team chose a different database technology that is not defined within the technology standards, they could be introducing commercial, organisational or operational risk as the pre-requisite due diligence has not been undertaken.

The propeller can be driven directly by a sealed motor in the pipe or by electric motor or petrol/diesel engines mounted to the pipe from the outside or by a right-angle drive shaft that pierces the pipe. Fluid particles, in course of their flow through the pump, do not change their radial locations since the change in radius at the entry (called 'suction') and the exit (called 'discharge') of the pump is very small. Hence the name \\"axial\\" pump. Operation The velocity triangle for an axial flow pump An axial flow pump has a propeller-type of impeller running in a casing. The pressure in an axial flow pump is developed by the flow of liquid over the blades of impeller. The fluid is pushed in a direction parallel to the shaft of the impeller, that is, fluid particles, in course of their flow through the pump, do not change their radial locations. It allows the fluid to enter the impeller axially and discharge the fluid nearly axially. The propeller of an axial flow pump is driven by a motor. = Notes = * The fixed diffuser vanes are used to remove the whirl component (V_{\\\\rm w2}) of the discharge velocity of the impeller and to convert the energy to pressure. * The impeller vanes may be adjustable. * The machine may be fitted with pre-entry vanes to eliminate pre-rotation and to make the flow purely axial. Work done on the fluid per unit weight = U \\\\frac{(V_{\\\\rm w2}-V_{\\\\rm w1})} {g} where U = U_{\\\\rm 2} = U_{\\\\rm 1} is the blade velocity. For maximum energy transfer, V_{\\\\rm w1} = 0 , that is, \\\\alpha_{\\\\rm 1} = 90\\\\deg Therefore, from outlet velocity triangle, we have V_{\\\\rm w2} = U - V_{\\\\rm f2} \\\\cot \\\\beta_{\\\\rm 2} Therefore, the maximum energy transfer per unit weight by an axial flow pump = U \\\\frac{(U - V_{\\\\rm f2} \\\\cot \\\\beta_{\\\\rm 2})} {g} Blade design The blades of an axial flow pump are twisted In an axial flow pump, blades have an airfoil section over which the fluid flows and pressure is developed. For a constant flow, we have V_{\\\\rm f1} = V_{\\\\rm f2} = V_{\\\\rm f} So, the maximum energy transfer to the fluid per unit weight will be U \\\\frac{(U - V_{\\\\rm f} \\\\cot \\\\beta_{\\\\rm 2})} {g} For constant energy transfer over the entire span of the blade, the above equation should be constant for all values of r . But, U^2 will increase with an increase in radius r , therefore to maintain a constant value an equal increase in UV_{\\\\rm f} \\\\cot \\\\beta_{\\\\rm 2} must take place. Since, V_{\\\\rm f} is constant, therefore \\\\cot \\\\beta_{\\\\rm 2} must increase on increasing r . So, the blade is twisted as the radius changes. Characteristics Characteristic curve of an axial-flow pump. Red lines show the different performance at varying blade pitch, blue lines the absorbed power. The performance characteristics of an axial flow pump is shown in the figure. As shown in the figure, the head at the zero flow rate can be as much as three times the head at the pump‚Äôs best efficiency point. Also, the power requirement increases as the flow decreases, with the highest power drawn at the zero flow rate. This characteristic is opposite to that of a radial flow centrifugal pump where power requirement increases with an increase in the flow. Also the power requirements and pump head increases with an increase in pitch, thus allowing the pump to adjust according to the system conditions to provide the most efficient operation. Advantages The main advantage of an axial flow pump is that it has a relatively high discharge (flow rate) at a relatively low head (vertical distance). For example, it can pump up to 3 times more water and other fluids at lifts of less than 4 meters as compared to the more common radial-flow or centrifugal pump. It also can easily be adjusted to run at peak efficiency at low-flow/high-pressure and high- flow/low-pressure by changing the pitch on the propeller (some models only). The effect of turning of the fluid is not too severe in an axial pump and the length of the impeller blades is also short. This leads to lower aerodynamic losses and higher stage efficiencies. These pumps have the smallest of the dimensions among many of the conventional pumps and are more suited for low heads and higher discharges. Applications Thai model 8 inch x 20 foot long axial flow pump powered by 12 horsepower two-wheel tractor lifting water from an irrigation canal into nearby rice fields via plastic flexible delivery pipe One of the most common applications of AFPs would be in handling sewage from commercial, municipal and industrial sources. In sailboats, AFPs are also used in transfer pumps used for sailing ballast. In power plants, they are used for pumping water from a reservoir, river, lake or sea for cooling the main condenser. In the chemical industry, they are used for the circulation of large masses of liquid, such as in evaporators and crystallizers. In sewage treatment, an AFP is often used for internal mixed liquor recirculation (i.e. transferring nitrified mixed liquor from aeration zone to denitrification zone). In agriculture and fisheries very large horsepower AFPs are used to lift water for irrigation and drainage. In East Asia, millions of smaller horsepower (6-20 HP) mobile units are powered mostly by single cylinder diesel and petrol engines. They are used by smaller farmers for crop irrigation, drainage and fisheries. Impeller designs have improved as well bringing even more efficiency and reducing energy costs to farming there. Earlier designs were less than two meters long but nowadays they can be up to 6 meters or more to enable them to more safely \\"reach out\\" to the water source while allowing the power source (many times two-wheel tractors are used) to be kept in safer, more stable positions, as shown in the adjacent picture.

Strombolian eruptions consist of ejection of incandescent cinders, lapilli, and lava bombs, to altitudes of tens to a few hundreds of metres. The eruptions are small to medium in volume, with sporadic violence. This type of eruption is named for the Italian volcano Stromboli. The Italian vulcanologist Giuseppe Mercalli studied eruptions at Stromboli and Vulcano in 1888‚Äì1890, and observed that the characteristic features of eruptions were different between the two. To distinguish between them, Mercalli defined Strombolian eruptions as \\"Mildly explosive at discrete but fairly regular intervals of seconds to minutes\\". A Strombolian eruption The tephra typically glows red when leaving the vent, but its surface cools and assumes a dark to black colour and may significantly solidify before impact. The tephra accumulates in the vicinity of the vent, forming a cinder cone. Cinder is the most common product; the amount of volcanic ash is typically rather minor. The lava flows are more viscous, and therefore shorter and thicker, than the corresponding Hawaiian eruptions; it may or may not be accompanied by production of pyroclastic rock. Instead the gas coalesces into bubbles, called gas slugs, that grow large enough to rise through the magma column, bursting near the top due to the decrease in pressure and throwing magma into the air. Each episode thus releases volcanic gases, sometimes as frequently as a few minutes apart. Gas slugs can form as deep as 3 kilometers, making them difficult to predict. Strombolian eruptive activity can be very long-lasting because the conduit system is not strongly affected by the eruptive activity, so that the eruptive system can repeatedly reset itself. Monogenetic cones usually erupt in the Strombolian style. For example, the Par√≠cutin volcano erupted continuously between 1943‚Äì1952, Mount Erebus, Antarctica has produced Strombolian eruptions for at least many decades, and Stromboli itself has been producing Strombolian eruptions for over two thousand years. The Romans referred to Stromboli as the \\"Lighthouse of the Mediterranean\\".

John Smith, though he had not been in Virginia since 1609 and was not an eyewitness, related in his History of Virginia that warriors of the Powhatan \\"came unarmed into our houses with deer, turkeys, fish, fruits, and other provisions to sell us\\".James Mooney, \\"The Powhatan Confederacy, Past and Present,\\" American Anthropologist 9, no. 1 (Jan. ‚Äì Mar., 1907), 129‚Äì52. The Powhatan peoples grabbed any tools or weapons available and killed all the English settlers they found, including men, women, and children of all ages. Chief Opechancanough led the Powhatan Confederacy in a coordinated series of surprise attacks; they killed a total of 347 people, a quarter of the population of the Virginia colony. Jamestown, founded in 1607, was the site of the first successful English settlement in North America, and was the capital of the Colony of Virginia. Its tobacco economy led to constant expansion and seizure of Powhatan lands, which ultimately provoked resistance as the Powhatan defended their territory.Wood, Origins of American Slavery (1997), p. 72. \\"By 1620 the colonists were simply taking the acres they required for their expanding tobacco economy without even the pretense of negotiation or payment. Increasing encroachments on indigenous peoples' lands, and particularly onto their hunting grounds, largely accounted for the deterioration of relations between the English and the indigenous populations of the Tidewater Chesapeake that finally exploded in 1622.\\"  Background  At first, the natives were glad to trade provisions to the colonists for metal tools, but by 1609 the English governor, John Smith, had begun to send raiding parties to demand food. This earned the colonists a bad reputation among the Native Americans and precipitated conflict.Fausz, An Abundance of Blood Shed on Both Sides (1990) p. 20 The English colonists isolated the Native Americans, burned down houses, and stole their food supplies.Fausz, An Abundance of Blood Shed on Both Sides (1990) pp. 6, 22. The English violence alienated the natives further and they laid siege to the Jamestown fort for several months. Unable to secure more food supplies, many colonists died during the \\"Starving Time\\" in 1609‚Äì10.Fausz, An Abundance of Blood Shed on Both Sides (1990) p. 54. The London Company's primary concern was the survival of the colony. In England's best interest the colonists would have to maintain civil relations with the Powhatan. The Powhatan and the English realized that they could benefit from each other through trade once peace was restored. In exchange for food, the chief asked the colonists to provide him with metal hatchets and copper.Jay B. Hubbell, \\" The Smith-Pocahontas Story in Literature,\\" The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography 65, no. 3 (July 1957), 275‚Äì300. Unlike John Smith, other early leaders of Virginia, such as Thomas Dale and Thomas Gates, based their actions on different thinking. They were military men and considered the Powhatan Confederacy as essentially a \\"military problem.\\"Glenn, Captain John Smith and the Indians, 228‚Äì48. The Powhatan peoples had soon realized that the Englishmen did not settle in Jamestown to trade with them. The English wanted more; they wanted control over the land. As Chief Powhatan said: =First Anglo-Powhatan War= In 1610 the London Company instructed Gates, the newly appointed colonial governor, to Christianise the natives and absorb them into the colony.Helen Rountree, Pocahontas's People, p. 54. As for Chief Powhatan, Gates was told, \\"If you finde it not best to make him your prisoner yet you must make him your tributary, and all the other his weroances [subordinate chiefs] about him first to acknowledge no other Lord but King James\\". When Gates arrived at Jamestown, he decided to evacuate the settlement because he thought the government's plan was not feasible. As the colonists were about to leave the Bay and head out into the open sea, they were met by the incoming fleet of Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr. Taking command as governor, de la Warr ordered the fort reoccupied. He plotted conquest of the surrounding tribes. In July 1610 he sent Gates against the Kecoughtan people. \\"Gates lured the Indians into the open by means of music-and-dance act by his drummer, and then slaughtered them\\". This was the First Anglo-Powhatan War. The English, led by Samuel Argall, captured Pocahontas, daughter of Powhatan, and held her hostage until he would agree to their demands. \\"English demanded that all Powhatan captives be released, return all English weapons taken by his warriors, and agree upon a lasting peace\\". While Pocahontas was held by the English, she met John Rolfe, whom she later married. While in captivity, Pocahontas was taught the English language, customs and the Anglican religion. She was baptized as a Christian and took the name Rebecca. Rolfe wrote that the way to maintain peace between the Powhatan and the English, was to marry Pocahontas, not \\"with the unbridled desire of carnal affection but for the good of the colony and the glory of God. Such a marriage might bring peace between the warring English and Powhatan, just as it would satisfy Pocahontas's desire.\\" After they married, more peaceful relations were maintained for a time between the English colonists and the Powhatan Confederacy. Edward Waterhouse, secretary of the Virginia Company, wrote: =New Governance= In 1618, after the death of Powhatan, his brother Opitchapam, a lame and quiet old man, became paramount chief of the confederacy. Their youngest brother, Opchanacanough, was probably the effective leader, with his friend, war-chief and advisor Nemattanew. Neither of the younger men believed that peaceful relations with the colonists could be maintained. Perhaps in 1620-1621 Opitchapam retired or he was deposed (but possibly he died in 1630), and he was succeeded by his youngest brother. Opchanacanough and Nemattanew began to develop plans for the unavoidable war. Having recovered from their defeat commanding Pamunkey warriors during the First Anglo-Powhatan War, they planned to shock the English with an attack that would leave them contained in a small trading outpost, rather than expanding throughout the area with new plantations. In the spring of 1622, after a settler murdered his adviser Nemattanew, Opchanacanough launched a campaign of surprise attacks on at least 31 separate English settlements and plantations, mostly along the James River, extending as far as Henricus.  Jamestown forewarned  Jamestown was saved by the warning of an Indian youth living in the home of Richard Pace, one of the colonists. The youth woke Pace to warn him of the planned attack. Living across the river from Jamestown, Pace secured his family and rowed to the settlement to spread the alarm. Jamestown increased its defenses. The name of the Indian who warned Pace is not recorded in any of the contemporary accounts. Although legend has named him \\"Chanco\\", this may be wrong. An Indian named \\"Chauco\\" is mentioned in a letter from the Virginia Council to the Virginia Company of London dated April 4, 1623. He is described not as a youth but as \\"one...who had lived much amongst the English, and by revealinge yt pl[ot] To divers appon the day of Massacre, saved theire lives...\\"\\"CCCXIX. Council in Virginia. Letter to Virginia Company of London, April 4, 1623\\" Susan Myra Kingsbury, editor. Records of the Virginia Company, 1606‚Äì26, Volume IV: Miscellaneous Records, p. 98 \\"Chauco\\" may be the same person as \\"Chacrow\\", an Indian mentioned in a court record of 25 October 1624 as living with Lt Sharpe, Capt. William Powell, and Capt. William Peirce \\"in the tyme of Sir Thos Dale's government\\"‚Äîthat is, before 1616.Minutes of the Council and General court of colonial Virginia, 1622‚Äì1632, ed. McIlwaine, p.28 It is possible that the older Indian, Chauco, and the youth who warned Richard Pace, have been conflated.  Destruction of other settlements  During the one-day surprise attack, the Powhatan tribes attacked many of the smaller communities, including Henricus and its fledgling college for children of natives and settlers alike. In the neighborhood of Martin's Hundred, 73 people were killed, more than half the population of Wolstenholme Towne was killed, where only two houses and a part of a church were left standing. In all, the Powhatan killed about four hundred colonists (a third of the white population) and took 20 women captive. The captives lived and worked as Powhatan Indians until they died or were ransomed. The settlers abandoned the Falling Creek Ironworks, Henricus and Smith's Hundred.  Date of the attack  = Julian Calendar dates = Under the Julian calendar, by which England and its colonies were still operating, New Year's Day fell on March 25 (Lady Day or the Feast of the Annunciation). The attack took place on March 22, 1621 as reckoned by the colonists, three days before New Years Day 1622. Historians, genealogists, and others who work with dates in this era commonly denote Julian calendar dates in the interval between January 1 and March 24 with the 'Old Style' suffix (OS) when presenting these dates with their original year value, or to use a dual dating syntax which combines original and adjusted values. For example, the date of the attack on Jamestown can be denoted as March 22, 1621(OS), or March 22, 1621/22. The common practice of showing the date as March 22, 1622 is technically inaccurate, but less confusing for those who are unfamiliar with the differences in calendaring systems. Under the retroactively applied modern Gregorian calendar, the date of the attack was April 1, 1622.  Aftermath  The surviving English settlers were in shock after the attacks. As they began to recover, the men worked on a plan of action. \\"By unanimous decision both the council and planters it was agreed to draw people together into fewer settlements\\" for better defense.\\"\\"to quitt many of our Plantacons and to vnite more neerely together in fewer places the better for to Strengthen and Defende ourselve.\\", Gov. Francis Wyatt, quoted in Seth Mallios, \\"At the Edge of the Precipice: Frontier Ventures, Jamestown‚Äôs Hinterland, and the Archaeology of 44JC802\\" , APVA Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities, July 2000 The colony intended to gather men together to plan a retaliatory attack, but this was difficult. Of the survivors \\"two-thirds were said to have been women and children and men who were unable to work or to go against the Indians\\".William S. Powell, \\"Aftermath of the Massacre: The First Indian War, 1622‚Äì1632\\", The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography, Vol. 66, no. 1 (Jan., 1958), pp. 44‚Äì75 Opechancanough withdrew his warriors, believing that the English would behave as Native Americans would when defeated: pack up and leave, or learn their lesson and respect the power of the Powhatan.Helen C. Rountree and E. Randolph Turner III, Before and After Jamestown: Virginia's Powhatans and Their Predecessors Following the event, Opechancanough told the Patawomeck, who were not part of the Confederacy and had remained neutral, that he expected \\"before the end of two Moones there should not be an Englishman in all their Countries.\\"Helen Rountree, Pocahontas's People p. 75, citing John Smith's 1624 Generall Historie. He misunderstood the English colonists and their backers overseas. In England when the massacre occurred, John Smith believed that the settlers would not leave their plantations to defend the colony. He planned to return with a ship filled with soldiers, sailors, and ammunition, to establish a \\"running Army\\" able to fight the Powhatan. Smith's goal was to \\"inforce the Savages to leave their Country, or bring them in the feare of subjection that every man should follow their business securely.\\" But Smith never returned to Virginia. The English took revenge against the Powhatan by \\"the use of force, surprise attacks, famine resulting from the burning of their corn, destroying their boats, canoes, and houses, breaking their fishing weirs and assaulting them in their hunting expedition, pursuing them with horses and using bloodhounds to find them and mastiffs to seaze them, driving them to flee within reach of their enemies among other tribes, and 'assimilating and abetting their enemies against them\\". The colonists used the 1622 massacre as a justification for seizing Powhatan land for the next ten years. Historian Betty Wood writes: > What is usually referred to as the \\"Massacre of 1622,\\" the native American > attack that resulted in the death of 347 English settlers and almost wiped > out Jamestown, which was the catalyst for the settlers actions. As far as > the survivors of the Massacre of 1622 were concerned, by virtue of launching > this unprovoked assault native Americans had forfeited any legal and moral > rights they might previously have claimed to the ownership of the lands they > occupied.Wood, Origins of American Slavery (1997), p. 72. Wood quotes a Virginian settler: > We, who hitherto have had possession of no more ground than their waste and > our purchase at a valuable consideration to their own contentment. . . may > now by right of war, and law of nations, invade the country, and those who > sought to destroy us: whereby we shall enjoy their cultivated places.Wood, > Origins of American Slavery (1997), p. 73. Indian decline and defeat In 1624 Virginia was made a royal colony of England by King James I. This meant that the Crown took direct authority rather than allowing guidance by the London Company. The Crown could exercise its patronage for royal favorites. Settlers continued to encroach on land of the Powhatan tribes, and the colony (and England) tended to change or ignore agreements with the natives when no longer in the colony's interest. The tribes felt increasing frustration with the settlers. The next major confrontation with the Powhatan, the Third Anglo-Powhatan War, occurred in 1644, resulting in the deaths of about 500 colonists. While similar to the death toll in 1622, the loss a generation later represented less than ten percent of the population, and had far less impact upon the colony. This time, the elder Opechancanough, who was being transported by litter, was captured by the colonists. Imprisoned at Jamestown, he was killed by one of his guards. His death marked the beginning of the increasingly precipitous decline of the once-powerful Powhatan. Its member tribes eventually left the area entirely, gradually lived among the colonists, or lived on one of the few reservations established in Virginia. Most of these were also subject to incursion and seizure of land by the ever-expanding European population. In modern times, seven tribes of the original Powhatan Confederacy are recognized in the Commonwealth of Virginia. The Pamunkey and Mattaponi still have control of their reservations established in the 17th century, each located between the rivers of the same names within the boundaries of present-day King William County.

Petrocaribe has been part of the \\"pink tide\\" in Latin America seeking to achieve post-neoliberal development in the region. In 2013 Petrocaribe established links with the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas (ALBA) aiming to go beyond oil trade and promoting economic cooperation.Venezuelanalysis.com, 6 April 2013, Petrocaribe Meets in Venezuela, Links With ALBA Treaty details The agreement was initiated with the aim of having solidarity with other countries in accordance with ALBA. The payment system allows for the purchase of oil at market value for 5%-50% up front with a grace period of one to two years; the remainder can be paid through a 17-25 year financing agreement with 1% interest if oil prices are above US$40 per barrel. The agreement builds on payment terms from the San Jose Agreement and the Caracas Energy Accord. Energy and Petroleum Minister and President of PDVSA Rafael Ram√≠rez said of the deal that it seeks to cut out the middleman in such transactions: \\"We're not talking about discounts...We're talking about financial facilities, direct deliveries of products, [and] infrastructure.\\" Membership There are a total of 17 members; 12 of the members are from the 15 member CARICOM (excluding Barbados, Montserrat, and Trinidad and Tobago). At the first summit, 14 countries joined the alliance; these were Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Belize, Cuba, Dominica, the Dominican Republic, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Saint Lucia, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Suriname, and Venezuela. At the third summit, Haiti and Nicaragua joined the union. Guatemala joined in July 2008 but left the organization in November 2013 stating that Venezuela had not provided them with the ultra-low financing rates that they had been promised. Haiti had not been initially invited to the talks, since Venezuela did not recognize its then post-Jean-Bertrand Aristide government. However, Hugo Chavez actively \\"courted\\" newly elected president Ren√© Pr√©val when he took office, much to Chevron, Exxon, and the US State Department's chagrin. After Venezuela had invested in developing Haitian infrastructure, and after the Haitian government convinced Chevron to deliver the oil from Venezuela, on 8 March 2008 the first shipment of oil was received. Honduras became the 17th member of the alliance in December 2007, under President Manuel Zelaya but left the organization after the 2009 coup d'√©tat before rejoining it on May 2012. Belize set up the Belize Petroleum Energy Company to coordinate for the project. =Non-members= Barbados denied that it had succumbed to pressure from the United States, who had a strained relationship with Venezuela, as the reason, but has not ruled out agreeing to Petrocaribe in the future. On August 31, 2005, Energy Minister Anthony Wood said that they are weighing options over signing Petrocaribe. In April 2011 Venezuelan president Hugo Ch√°vez renewed his offer for Barbados to join Petrocaribe. Panama applied for membership on 3 March 2009 and initially said it would continue to join Petrocaribe under the new president, but Panama remains a non-member.

It was developed at the University of Washington by Mark Crispin and others.  History  UW-IMAP's development began c.1988. As of 2003, UW IMAP was among the three most popular free software IMAP server packages, the other two being Cyrus IMAP and Courier IMAP. As of 2005, by which point its codebase had undergone extensive rewriting, it was among the top two, the other being Cyrus IMAP. In May 2008, the University of Washington terminated development of UW IMAP. On 4 August 2008, staff at the University of Washington who had been involved in developing UW IMAP, Pine, and Alpine, announced that they would \\"shift our effort from direct development into more of a consultation and coordination role to help integrate contributions from the community,\\" in the wake of layoffs at the University of Washington's technology division. c. January - August 2009, the maintainers of Debian GNU/Linux, a major downstream distributor of UW IMAP, began to retire their UW IMAP packages. In September 2009, Mark Crispin, the principal author of UW IMAP, announced a fork called Panda IMAP. Crispin passed away in late 2012. At least one UW IMAP enthusiast maintains a public source code repository containing the UW IMAP and Panda IMAP commit history from the start of the project until Crispin's final release. = Praise and criticism = For much of the 2000s, UW IMAP was considered to be a good choice due to its ready availability, its inclusion in all major Linux distributions, its support for both POP and IMAP, and its ease of installation. It also received praise for its ease of administration and for its compatibility with longstanding mailbox formats, and for and its small size and simplicity. Unlike later IMAP servers, UW IMAP coupled IMAP user accounts to user accounts on the server's underlying operating system. This feature, together with UW IMAP's default use of monolithic mailbox files, was intended to ensure compatibility with legacy operating systems and email management practices, but drew criticism from some commentators. In particular, Sam Varshavchik, developer of the competing Courier IMAP server, suggested that Crispin's decision not to add support for maildir (a popular non-monolithic mailbox format) to UW IMAP may have stemmed from lingering resentment over an earlier disagreement that Crispin had had with maildir's designer, Daniel J. Bernstein. Crispin's insistence upon retaining UW IMAP's support for flat files as mail stores was criticised, by the maintainers of the competing Citadel IMAP server, for causing otherwise unnecessary complexity in the IMAP protocol. Additionally, Varshavchik noted that despite Crispin's insistence that other IMAP servers comply with the IMAP specifications, the UW IMAP server and its IMAP client counterpart, Pine, used a private IMAP extension that was not documented in that specification. UW IMAP was also criticised for its susceptibility to buffer overflows and for its lack of privilege separation relative to its competitors Cyrus and Courier, As of 2007, computer programs existed that were capable of exploiting security vulnerabilities in un-patched or improperly-configured UW IMAP installations. and for its unreliable SSL support.  Components and features  UW IMAP was designed to be compatible with existing legacy mail stores and systems, and to be \\"plug-and-play\\" installable without requiring any site- specific configuration. UW IMAP uses the c-client mail engine that is also used by the Alpine and Pine e-mail clients. c-client supports multiple mail store formats including Usenet news spools, MIX, mbox, mbx, mx, mh, tenex, mtx, MMDF, and phile. c-client also includes support for IMAP, POP3, NNTP, and SMTP Internet protocols. Also bundled with UW IMAP are POP2 and POP3 servers, the mailutil utility program, and the dmail and tmail mail delivery agents. As of 2005, UW IMAP's codebase consisted of 135,000 lines of code, of which the IMAP server itself comprised 4,000 lines and c-client comprised the rest. = Extensibility and maildir support = UW IMAP does not officially support the maildir format. However, UW IMAP can be patched to support other formats, such as maildir. Gluelogic offers a patch to support maildirs in Pine. The patched Pine instance can then be used to compile UW IMAP with nominal maildir support. However, this yields a buggy server that will not correctly distinguish between Unseen and Recent messages. A patch is available for Alpine that can be used similarly, but with fewer drawbacks.

They usually commence with phreatomagmatic eruptions which can be extremely noisy due to the rising magma heating water in the ground. This is usually followed by the explosive clearing of the vent and the eruption column is dirty grey to black as old weathered rocks are blasted out of the vent. As the vent clears, further ash clouds become grey-white and creamy in colour, with convolutions of the ash similar to those of Plinian eruptions. The term Vulcanian was first used by Giuseppe Mercalli, witnessing the 1888‚Äì1890 eruptions on the island of Vulcano. His description of the eruption style is now used all over the world. Mercalli described Vulcanian eruptions as \\"...Explosions like cannon fire at irregular intervals...\\" Their explosive nature is due to increased silica content of the magma. Almost all types of magma can be involved, but magma with about 55% or more silica (e.g. basaltic andesite) is most common. Increasing silica levels increase the viscosity of the magma which means increased explosiveness. Characteristics Vulcanian eruptions display several common characteristics. The mass of rock ejected during the eruption is usually between 102 \\\\- 106 tonnes Murai, I. & Hosoya, Y., 1964, Earthquake Research Institute Tokyo Bulletin, 42, 203‚Äì36 and contains a high proportion of non-juvenile material (> 50%). During active periods of volcanic activity, intervals between explosions vary from less than 1 minute (e.g. Anak Krakatoa) to about a day. Pyroclastic flows are also common features of this type of eruption.Melson, W.G. & Saenz, R., 1973, Bulletin of Volcanology, 37, 416‚Äì37Stith, J.L. et al., 1977, Geophysical Research Letters,4, 259‚Äì62 The gas streaming phase of Vulcanian eruptions are characterised by discrete cannon- like explosions.Minakami, T., 1950, Bulletin of Volcanology, 10, 59‚Äì87 These expulsions of gas can reach supersonic velocities resulting in shock waves.Nairn, I.A. & Self, S.J., 1978, Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research, 3, 39‚Äì60 The tephra is dispersed over a wider area than that from Strombolian eruptions. The pyroclastic rock and the base surge deposits form an ash volcanic cone, while the ash covers a large surrounding area. The eruption ends with a flow of viscous lava. Vulcanian eruptions may throw large metre-size blocks several hundred metres, occasionally up to several kilometres. Vulcanian eruptions are dangerous to persons within several hundred metres of the vent. Volcanic bombs are common products of this type of eruption. These are initially molten blobs of lava, which rapidly cool into blocks often 2 to 3 m across. At Galeras, a Vulcanian eruption ejected bombs which struck several volcanologists who were in the crater, some of whom died or suffered severe injuries. The Gran Cratere, Vulcano. A sense of scale is provided by the tourist visible near the centre of the crater.  1930 eruption of Stromboli  The 11 September 1930 eruption of Stromboli was a Vulcanian eruption. It started at 08:10 hours (local), when ash was vented for about 10 minutes. Then at 09:52 two incredibly powerful explosions occurred which shook the whole island. Blocks were hurled about 2 km. These fell out of the sky smashing through buildings etc. A tsunami 2 to 2.5 m high was generated. By 10:40 the explosive phase of the eruption was over. Expulsion of lava followed, this flowed down the Sciara del Fuoco, lasting into the night. At the same time incandescent scoria flowed down the Vallonazzo Valley and entered the sea near Piscit√†. It is believed that water entered due to a partial collapse of the conduit. The water flashed into steam and took the easiest \\"escape route\\" via the open conduit. Expansion by contact with the molten magma generated the two very large explosions. There were six deaths. Four fishermen died at sea when the avalanches of hot scoria caused the sea to become very disturbed. One person was killed in Stromboli village by falling blocks, and the sixth was killed by the tsunami.

A Dictionary of Islam. (Clifton, NJ: Reference Book Publishers, 1965), 29. He was the son of Musa ibn Nusayr, the governor of Ifriqiya. ‚ÄòAbd al-Aziz ibn Musa ibn Nusayr had a long history of political and military involvement along with his father. Origins of Power ‚ÄòAbd al-Aziz ibn Musa ibn Nusayr accompanied his father in 712 to aid the Berber general, Tariq, in the Umayyad conquest of Hispania.Fouracre, Paul. The New Cambridge Medieval History Vol. 1. (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2005), 370. It has been speculated that Musa ibn Nusayr and his son, both Arabs, did not want the glory of conquest to be claimed by a Berber. The conquest of the area was progressing smoothly under Tariq, Musa ibn Nusayr and ‚ÄòAbd al-Aziz ibn Musa ibn Nusayr. With the success of the conquest apparent, Tariq and Musa ibn Nusayr were called back to Syria by the Umayyad caliph, Al Waleed, in 714. ‚ÄòAbd al-Aziz ibn Musa ibn Nusayr was given the governorship of Al-Andalus by his father.Holt, P.M., Anne K.S. Lambton, and Bernard Lewis. The Cambridge History of Islam Vol.2. (London: Combridge University Press, 1970), 407.

Under ‚ÄòAbd al-Aziz ibn Musa ibn Nusayr‚Äôs leadership after the departure of his father and Tariq, Islamic power, in what came to be known as Al-Andalus, expanded into modern day Portugal in the west and the sub-Pyrenean regions in the north.Provencal, Levi. Encyclopedia of Islam New Edition Vol. 1 A-B. (Leiden, the Netherlands: E.J. Brill, 1960), 58. In one of the newly conquered lands, ‚ÄòAbd al-Aziz ibn Musa ibn Nusayr signed a peace treaty with the Visigothic lord of Murcia, Theudimer. His name in Arabic is Tudmir. The treaty, known as the Treaty of Tudmir, gave Visigothic Christians the right to continue to practise their religion, as long as they paid a special tax and remained loyal to their Muslim overlords. Personal life and influences ‚ÄòAbd al-Aziz ibn Musa ibn Nusayr remained in power and even married the widow Egilon, the wife of the last Visigothic king, Roderic. Egilon took the name Umm ‚ÄòAsim upon her marriage and conversion to Islam. In his marriage to Egilon, ‚ÄòAbd al-Aziz ibn Musa ibn Nusayr set a trend of espousing local Visigothic women, due to the lack of Arab and Berber women. This lack was because Arab and Berber women did not accompany the army into Al-Andalus at the beginning of the conquest of Hispania. The practice of taking conquered women as wives almost became a general rule for conquering Muslim leaders.Holt, Lambton, Lewis, The Cambridge History of Islam Vol.2, 408. Egilon‚Äôs influence over ‚ÄòAbd al-Aziz ibn Musa ibn Nusayr was not common. Some felt that she held too much influence and sway over ‚ÄòAbd al-Aziz ibn Musa ibn Nusayr. Egilon coaxed ‚ÄòAbd al-Aziz ibn Musa ibn Nusayr to wear a crown, and lower entrance ways to promote veneration of him and people bowing to him. Egilon even had ‚ÄòAbd al-Aziz ibn Musa ibn Nusayr make the entrance to his audience chamber lower, so that upon entering, he would be bowing to her. These links to the Visigothic royalty and the influence of Egilon led to the misconception and rumors that ‚ÄòAbd al-Aziz ibn Musa ibn Nusayr had converted to Christianity. These rumours even reached the Umayyad Caliph SulaymƒÅn in Damascus. Troubled by these rumours, the caliph ordered ‚ÄòAbd al-Aziz ibn Musa ibn Nusayr to be killed.Hitti, History of The Arabs, 503. It is very likely, however, that these were rumours instigated at the behest of the hostile faction led by Habib ibn Abi Ubaidah Al-Fihri, which eventually killed Abdul- Aziz. Certainly Abdul-Aziz had a reputation as a righteous Muslim before these rumours that did not support this theory. Assassination and Al-Andalus afterwards Sources differ on the year, but ‚ÄòAbd al-Aziz Ibn Musa ibn Nusayr was assassinated by Ziyad ibn ‚ÄòUdhra al-Balawi on order of the Caliph Sulayman. However, Ibn Khaldun reports the order was received and carried out by Habib ibn Abi Obeida al-Fihri Ibn Khaldun, Histoire des Berb√®res et des dynasties musulmanes de l'Afrique, 1852 trans., Algiers, Vol. p.355 The caliph feared that he wanted to establish his own personal monarchy in Al-Andalus, separate from the Umayyad caliphate based in Damascus. Dates of his assassination vary between the years 715,Collins, Roger. The Arab Conquest of Spain 710-797. Malden, Massachusetts: Blackwell Publishers Inc., 1999. p. 37 716,Fouracre, The New Cambridge Medieval History Vol. 1, 370. or 718 .Provencal, Encyclopedia of Islam New Edition Vol. 1 A-B., 58. ‚ÄòAbd al-Aziz ibn Musa was beheaded in the monastery of Santa Rufina, used during the time as a mosque.Ibn Khaldun, Histoire des Berb√®res et des dynasties musulmanes de l'Afrique, 1852 trans., Algiers, Ibn Khaldun reports that Habib ibn Abi Obeida al-Fihri found Abd al-Aziz in public prayer; when he began reciting the 69th Sura (Al-Haaqqa, 'the inevitable event'), Habib burst out \\"You brought this event on yourself, you son of a whore!\\" and struck his head off with his sword. After his death, ‚ÄòAbd al-Aziz ibn Musa‚Äôs head was brought to Damascus and displayed publicly to an audience where the caliph knew that his father, Musa ibn Nusayr, was in attendance.Hitti, History of The Arabs, 503. ‚ÄòAbd al- Aziz ibn Musa ibn Nusayr was succeeded by his cousin, Ayyub ibn Habib al- Lakhmi, who is thought to have played a role in his assassination.Collins, The Arab Conquest of Spain 710-797, 45. His tenure as governor did not last long and for a period of forty years following his assassination, Al-Andalus was filled with chaos and turmoil. Rival Arab factions continuously fought to gain power, and also to expand Islamic control in the area. Governors were appointed or chosen, but they were often deposed by rival groups or by the Umayyad caliph in Damascus. This pattern continued at least until 756, when an independent Umayyad emirate was established in C√≥rdoba.Holt, Lambton, Lewis, The Cambridge History of Islam Vol.2, 407. However, Abd-ar-Rahman I still found much resistance in Al-Andalus (Toledo, Zaragoza, Barcelona ... ) and had to struggle still 25 years for a total mastery over the territory. Islamic power remained in the region until 1492, when Ferdinand and Isabella conquered the Islamic kingdom of Granada.Ibn Abd-el-Hakem. ‚ÄúThe Islamic Conquest of Spain,‚Äù The Internet Islamic History Sourcebook.

The series aired for thirteen episodes and premiered on ABC, starting on September 8, 1990.See www.tvguide.com/tvshows/wizard-oz/205567 (accessed on January 19, 2011) The show presented a number of stories and characters from L. Frank Baum's original Oz series. Series premise Dorothy has decided to return to Oz with Toto using the ruby slippers that showed up on her doorstep. Upon arriving there she reunites with the Scarecrow, Tin Man and Cowardly Lion, she learns from Glinda the Good Witch that the Wicked Witch of the West has been resurrected by her evil winged monkeys and that the Emerald City has been taken over by her. The Wizard is in his hot air balloon, which is under a spell that causes it to be constantly blown around by an evil wind. Dorothy, Toto, Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion set out to rescue him and defeat the Wicked Witch once and for all. Author Jeff Lenburg mentioned an aspect of the series wherein Dorothy has to learn to believe in oneself. =The ruby slippers= To combat the idea that the slippers would provide Dorothy with ultimate power against the Witch, they didn't always work correctly, apparently because she wasn't entirely sure how to use them. They often didn't do exactly as she asked, acting unpredictably. In the second episode, she clicks her heels four times to correct the Witch's damage to the Emerald City, as to imply that a fourth click has more power than three. Glinda often told her to only use them as a last resort. Similarly, the Wicked Witch's crystal ball was unpredictable, often only working once a day. The episode \\"Crystal Clear\\" explains that this was caused by the ball's creator having intentionally stabbed/cracked it with a carving knife, during the witch's theft attempt, in order to prevent her from using its full potential. The Wicked Witch does manage to get the slippers once in the series. However, Truckle manages to steal them from her, and she is unable to use their power to their full advantage. The Cowardly Lion also gets to wear them briefly. =Similarities to the 1939 film= The series incorporated visual elements from the 1939 film version, including the Scarecrow's diploma and Dorothy's ruby slippers. At the same time, the character of Dorothy was designed with an appearance similar to that of Ariel from Disney's The Little Mermaid and was not intended to resemble Judy Garland, as well as Dorothy's dress being a solid blue as opposed to the gingham style from the film. In addition, the series incorporated music from the original film, including a slightly altered version of \\"We're Off to See the Wizard\\". Toto, as in the film, also seems to be able to \\"smell\\" the Wicked Witch or her spellwork, even when she's in disguise. A reversal of the archetype from the film was that Dorothy got herself from Kansas to Oz by clicking her heels in her slippers and saying \\"There's no place like Oz\\". =Differences from the 1939 film= While the series is mostly based on the 1939 film, there are some issues with the canon of it. In the film, it is largely implied that Oz was a head-trauma-induced delirium,L. Frank Baum, The Annotated Wizard of Oz, edited by Michael Patrick Hearn, New York, Crown, 1976; p. 96. . instead of a real place, while in the series it was a real place. The only sequel that depicts Oz as a dream is the 1974 animated film Journey Back to Oz, where Dorothy once again has a head injury before finding herself back in Oz. The program could only be a spinoff, partly because it violates the rule of the ruby slippers, that they could never come off the feet of their wearer, as long as he / she is still alive.

The population was 56 at the 2010 census. Echo was founded in 1854. The community took its name from nearby Echo Canyon. History Echo originated as a stopover along the Mormon trail. Later the town served as a junction between the First Transcontinental Railroad and a spur line to serve silver mines near Park City. Since the creation of U.S. Highways Echo has served as a highway junction, where the main road coming from Wyoming splits with one branch proceeding towards Salt Lake City, continuing towards San Francisco, California, and the other towards Ogden, continuing to Portland, Oregon. Originally the main highway was numbered U.S. Route 30S and the branch was U.S. Route 530; the modern freeway equivalents are numbered Interstate 80 and Interstate 84. Echo was significant to the Union Pacific Railroad. The town served as a coaling and watering station for trains entering Echo Canyon. From Echo, helper locomotives were added, when needed, to push trains up the steep grade to Wahsatch. A large coaling tower and many other railroad infrastructures existed in and around the town. Echo saw the most action during World War II. The introduction of diesel power, especially after the war, negated the need for the services previously required by steam. The coaling tower, most trackage, and structures were removed. Echo had faded by the sixties, yet was still alive by the junction of two major highways. However, the arrival of the interstate relegated the town to a few quaint buildings; some homes, a motel, restaurant and bus station. A tavern sells cigarettes, food, and beer. Nearby; Echo Canyon is a magnificent spectacle with its high rock sides and colorful scenery. The canyon begins just east of Echo and ends outside of Wahsatch, Utah. Demographics As of the census of 2010, there were 56 people living in the CDP. There were 31 housing units. The racial makeup of the town was 96.4% White and 3.6% American Indian and Alaska Native. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 19.6% of the population.

Frick and Frack were known for skating in Alpine Lederhosen and performing eccentric tricks on ice, including the \\"cantilever spread-eagle\\", created by Groebli, and Mauch's \\"rubber legs\\", twisting and bending his legs while skating in a spread eagle position. Only a few skaters have successfully performed the duo's routines since. Michael Mauch, the son of Hans, described the origin of their names: \\"Frick took his name from a small village in Switzerland; Frack is a Swiss-German word for a frock coat, which my father used to wear in the early days of their skating act. They put the words together as a typical Swiss joke.\\" History Frick and Frack found fame with the Follies, a revue promoted by Eddie Shipstad and his brother Roy, which began in 1936 and ran for almost 50 years. They also reached a worldwide audience when they began appearing in films, including the Monogram Pictures production Lady, Let's Dance in 1944. Their association lasted so long, and they were at one time so well known, that their names became a household term in many languages. Frick and Frack skated in the Ice Follies for many years until Hans Mauch (Frack) contracted osteomyelitis. He retired in 1953, and died on June 4, 1979 in Long Beach, California at the age of 60. He had been married to Mary M. Elchlepp of Minneapolis, one of the original Ice Folliettes. Performing well into his late years, Werner Groebli continued on as \\"Mr. Frick\\" until an accident forced him to retire in 1980. He appeared as a contestant on TV's original Match Game on NBC in the 1960s. Groebli lived in the Palm Springs, California area for over 10 years until the death of his wife, the former Yvonne Baumgartner, in 2002. He was featured on a PBS TV special in 1999. Groebli died on April 14, 2008 in Zurich at the age of 92. David Thomas, one of his skating partners after Mauch retired, announced his death from complications after breaking a leg at a nursing home outside of Zurich.Werner Groebli, Ice Skating's Frick, Dies at 92, The New York Times, April 23, 2008. Accessed April 23, 2008.  In popular culture  \\"Frick and Frack\\" has become an English slang term used to refer to two people so closely associated as to be indistinguishable.World Wide Words: Frick and Frack Comic radio mechanics Tom and Ray Magliozzi performed for years under the name Click and Clack. Frick and Frack were referenced in an episode of Cheers (Season 8, Episode 7) named \\"Death Takes a Holiday on Ice\\", and an episode of Sanford and Son (Season 2, Episode 24) named \\"Rated X\\". In addition, an episode of The Andy Griffith Show (\\"The Bookie Barber\\") had Deputy Barney Fife, annoyed at a joke made by Sheriff Andy, using the names.

The MSBA, upon the initiative of applicant municipal and regional school districts, partially funds school facility construction and develops financially sound plans for constructing educationally appropriate buildings that are long-lived, safe, and economically and environmentally sustainable. The source of MSBA revenue funds is one cent of the 6.25-percent sales tax of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The MSBA funds a portion of approved eligible building project costs; the proportion of funding depends primarily upon the school districts's economic health, and can vary from 31 to 80 percent of the cost of the new building or building rehabilitation project. History In 2004, the Massachusetts legislature placed a moratorium on state assistance to the funding of public school capital expenditure projects. A prior backlog of more than 800 audits and a failure of the legislature to properly fund the former School Building Assistance Program (SBA) had led to an accumulated a debt of more than $10 billion from the SBA's operations. The program was at that time administered by the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education. In July 2004, the legislature enacted the bill creating the MSBA, and on July 26, the then Governor, Mitt Romney, signed the bill into law as Chapter 208 of the Acts of 2004, establishing the new public authority, which assumed responsibility for the School Building Assistance Program, its debt obligations and other previous commitments. The MSBA‚Äôs first years focused on an accelerated audit program that resolved prior School Building Assistance Program commitments to local school districts. By the end of 2006, debt and the backlog of audits had been reduced enough for the authority to lift the moratorium on funding new building projects, and in 2007, the MSBA accepted new capital projects for consideration. On January 25, 2012, Massachusetts Treasurer and Receiver General Steven Grossman, Chair of the MSBA, announced the appointment of Jack McCarthy as Executive Director of the MSBA. Operations Since its establishment in 2004, the MSBA has made more than $10.1 billion in reimbursements to cities, towns and regional school districts for school construction projects. Instead of waiting years for reimbursement, districts now receive payments from the MSBA as costs are incurred. These timely payments have saved municipalities over $2.9 billion in avoided local interest costs. To fulfill its mission of developing fiscally responsible and educationally appropriate capital improvements, the MSBA has: * Made full or partial payments to more than 424 of the 428 projects on the waiting list, with funding available for the remaining projects once they begin construction * Received and processed over 180 Statements of Interest from communities interested in participating in the program * Instituted an accelerated audit program that has completed more than 772 of the 800 backlogged audits inherited from the former program * Audited over $14 billion in project costs * Made it possible for local municipal or regional school districts to avoided $2.9 billion in interest costs, by increasing speed which projects move through the capital funding process * Saved Massachusetts and its municipalities over $1.1 billion by establishing of reasonable enrollment projections; increased oversight of school improvement projects with reasonable project budgets the prevent growth in scope or budget; and exercises due diligence by making more than 450 site visits to more than 160 school districts References External links *Massachusetts School Building Authority *MSBA Financial Statements, Fiscal Year Ending June 30, 2011 School Building Authority School Building Authority ","title":"Massachusetts School Building Authority"},{"id":"2588191","text":"Cove Fort is a fort, unincorporated community, and historical site located in Millard County, Utah. It was founded in 1867 by Ira Hinckley (the paternal grandfather of Gordon B. Hinckley) at the request of Brigham Young. One of its distinctive features is the use of volcanic rock in the construction of the walls, rather than the wood used in many mid-19th-century western forts. This difference in construction is the reason it is one of very few forts of this period still surviving. Cove Fort is the closest named place to the western terminus of Interstate 70, resulting in Cove Fort being listed as a control city on freeway signs, though the fort itself is historical and has no permanent population. History Interior Telegraph office The site for Cove Fort was selected by Brigham Young because of its location about halfway between Fillmore, then the capital of the Utah Territory, and the nearest city, Beaver. It provided a way station for people traveling the Mormon Road. A town would have been constructed at the Cove Fort site, but the water supply was inadequate to support a sizable population. Another key factor in the selection of the site was the prior existence of a wooden-palisade fort, Willden Fort, which provided shelter and safety for the work crews who constructed Cove Fort. The fort is a square, on each side. The walls are constructed of black volcanic rock and dark limestone, both quarried from the nearby mountains. The walls are 18 ft high and 4 ft thick at the base, tapering to 2 ft thick at the top. The fort has two sets of large wooden doors at the east and west ends, originally filled with sand to stop arrows and bullets, and contains 12 interior rooms (six on the north wall and six on the south wall.) As a daily stop for two stagecoach lines, as well as many other travelers, Cove Fort was heavily used for many years, often housing and feeding up to 75 people at a time. In addition to providing a place to rest, a blacksmith/farrier resided at the fort, who shod horses and oxen, and also repaired wagon wheels. With its telegraph office and as a Pony Express stop, it also acted as a regional communications hub. Restoration In the early 1890s, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints determined the fort was no longer required and leased it out, selling it to W.H. Kesler after the turn of the 20th century. In 1988, the Hinckley family purchased the fort and donated it back to the Church. The Church restored the fort, transported Ira Hinckley's Coalville, Utah, cabin to the site, constructed a visitor center, and reopened the fort as a historic site. The site provides free guided tours daily, starting from about 8 am until one half-hour before sunset. Transportation The first highway to traverse Cove Fort was the Arrowhead Trail, which connected Salt Lake City with Los Angeles. When the U.S. Highway system was formed, this route became U.S. Route 91, and is today Interstate 15. When the Interstate Highway System was in the planning stages, planners noted no direct connection existed between the central United States and southern California. The result to fill this gap was a new freeway that would be built west from Green River, Utah, towards Cove Fort, along a path that used to be inaccessible by paved roads. Since that time, Cove Fort has also served as the western terminus of Interstate 70. In 2004, the Federal Highway Administration was testing a new typeface, Clearview, designed to have improved readability at night with headlight illumination. One test sign was placed at Baltimore, Maryland ‚Äì the eastern terminus of Interstate 70 ‚Äì that listed Cove Fort as a control city with a distance of . One employee stated with the number of queries the department received about Cove Fort, the test was a success. The sign became so popular that after the test was over, federal authorities made arrangements with Maryland authorities to keep the sign permanently installed. The sign prompted a series of stories about Cove Fort to be published in the Baltimore area. Since that time, a small effort has been made by people in both states to lobby the Utah Department of Transportation to reciprocate by placing a sign at Cove Fort listing the distance to Baltimore.

It is the seat of an arrondissement and a canton. As of the 2013 France census, the town's population is 21,572. The inhabitants of the commune are known as Sarregueminois and Sarregueminoises. Geography Sarreguemines, whose name is a French spelling of the name in local Lorraine-German dialect \\"Saargemin\\", meaning \\"confluence into the Saar\\", is located at the confluence of the Blies and the Saar, east of Metz, northwest of Strasbourg by rail, and at the junction of the lines to Trier and Saarburg. Traditionally Sarreguemines was the head of river navigation on the Saar, its importance being a depot where boats were unloaded. Administration Sarreguemines was, from 1985 to 2015, the seat of two cantons: * Sarreguemines, consisting of the Sarreguemines commune only. * Sarreguemines-Campagne, comprising 21 nearby communes. Both cantons, minus the communes of Grundviller, Guebenhouse, Loupershouse and Woustviller that were added to the canton of Sarralbe, were merged into one canton of Sarreguemines on . History Sarreguemines, originally a Roman settlement, obtained civic rights early in the 13th century. In 1297 it was ceded by the count of Saarbr√ºcken to the Duke of Lorraine, and passed with Lorraine in 1766 to France. It was transferred to Germany in 1871, with the Treaty of Frankfurt following the Franco-Prussian War. From 1871 to 1918 it formed part of the German imperial province of Alsace-Lorraine and manufactured plush velvet, leather, faience and porcelain, and was a centre for making papier-m√¢ch√© boxes, mostly used for snuffboxes. It was returned to France after World War I. On December 21‚Äì23, 1944, the 44th Infantry Division (United States) threw back three attempts by the Germans to cross the Blies River. An aggressive defense of the Sarreguemines area was continued throughout February and most of March 1945.

It was also where Confederate General Thomas J. Jackson acquired his nickname \\"Stonewall\\". The park was established in 1940 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966. More than 700,000 people visit the battlefield each year. The Henry Hill Visitor Center, on Sudley Road by the south entrance to the park, offers exhibits and interpretation regarding the First Battle of Bull Run, including Civil War-era uniforms, weapons, field gear and an electronic battle map. The center offers the orientation film \\"Manassas: End of Innocence\\", as well as a bookstore. A recent find in 2014 unearthed bone fragments that led to the discovery of the skeletal remains of two Union soldiers in what is now thought to be a Surgeon's Pit. The remains were found among the bones of several other limbs in the pit. Carbon dating shows that the pair died during the Battle of Second Manassas, also known as Second Bull Run, in August 1862. The remains were moved on Tuesday, June 19, 2018, and transferred from the National Park Service to the US Army who will be burying them in Arlington National Cemetery.

Outdoor literature encompasses several different subgenres including exploration literature, adventure literature, mountain literature and nature writing. Another subgenre is the guide book, an early example of which was Thomas West's guide to the Lake District published in 1778.Thomas West, (1821) [1778]. A Guide to the Lakes in Cumberland, Westmorland, and Lancashire. Kendal: W. Pennington. The genres can include activities such as exploration, survival, sailing, hiking, mountaineering, whitewater boating, geocaching or kayaking, or writing about nature and the environment. Travel literature is similar to outdoor literature but differs in that it does not always deal with the out-of-doors, but there is a considerable overlap between these genres, in particular with regard to long journeys. History Henry David Thoreau's Walden (1854) is an early and influential work. Although not entirely an outdoor work (he lived in a cabin close to civilization) he expressed the ideas of why people go out into the wilderness to camp, backpack and hike: to get away from the rush of modern society and simplify life. This was a new perspective for the time and thus Walden has had a lasting influence on most outdoor authors. Walden Pond Robert Louis Stevenson's Travels with a Donkey in the C√©vennes (1879), about his travels in C√©vennes (France), is among the first popular books to present hiking and camping as recreational activities, and tells of commissioning one of the first sleeping bags.Travel with a Donkey in the Cevennes (1879); Re the first sleeping bag in 1876 In the world of sailing Joshua Slocum's Sailing Alone Around the World (1900) is a classic of outdoor literature.Joshua Slocum Society: .

Criminal career  Shriner, who was described as \\"a slightly retarded man with a bizarre physical appearance\\"Petrunik (1994), p. 57 and tested to have an IQ of 67Lamott/Pf√§fflin (2008), p. 113 had a long history of sadistic sexual assaults but only one conviction. \\"Shriner was in the community without supervision because his sentence had expired and a judge had ruled that he did not meet the stringent 'imminent danger' criteria necessary for commitment under the State's mental health laws.\\" In 1966, when Shriner, at that time 16, was detained for strangling a seven-year-old girl, he led the police officers to the body of a developmentally disabled 15-year-old girl instead, whom he had strangled. He was confined to 10 years, but committed as a 'defective delinquent' to a hospital, but not convicted of a crime. Between 1977 and 1987, while serving a 10-year sentence for abducting and assaulting two 16-year-old girls, Shriner had repeatedly disclosed not just fantasies but detailed plans how he would kidnap, confine, and torture his victims.Petrunik (1994), p. 60  Reactions  = Sexually violent predator legislation = The final sexual assault Shriner committed in May 1989, caused a nationwide public outrage, that has been cited as one of the main catalysts for new laws allowing indefinite confinement of sex offenders. The formation of a victims advocacy group Tennis Shoe Brigade, named in reference to the grass-roots organizations demand that the public be free to walk the streets in safety, rallying for toughening the laws, raised the public pressure on Washington's Governor Booth Gardner. Subsequently, the Washington state legislature unanimously enacted the first \\"sexual predator\\" law, allowing to indefinitely lock up perpetrators of any sexual crime, if a \\"mental abnormality\\" causing someone to commit another sex crime can be attested.RCW ch. 71.09, http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=71.09 A pivotal part of the 1990 Community Protection Act (Washington) this legislation was subsequently adopted by many other U.S. states. Many people also became outraged that such a clearly dangerous sexual predator had been allowed to live in anonymity prior to the killings, and some people thought that the killings could have been avoided if people had been aware of Shriner's criminal history. As a result, the Community Protection Act also not only created a sex offender registry in Washington state, but also required community notification of the presence of the state's most dangerous sex offenders. The Community Protection Act thus is generally considered to have created the world's first publicly accessible sex offender registry; all other sex offender registries existing before this point were only available to law enforcement. = Animal abuse = Shriner was also cited by PETA in their campaign against animal abuse as an example of notorious criminals that started torturing animals long before turning to children. The Animals' Voice describes him as \\"being widely known in his neighborhood as the man who put firecrackers in dogs' rectums and strung up cats\\".

It was designed to have high corrosion resistance and strength over a wide temperature range. ETFE is a polymer and its source-based name is poly(ethene- co-tetrafluoroethene). It is also known under its brand name : Tefzel. ETFE has a relatively high melting temperature, excellent chemical, electrical and high-energy radiation resistance properties. When burned, ETFE releases hydrofluoric acid. Properties Useful comparison tables of PTFE against FEP, PFA and ETFE can be found on DuPont's website, listing the mechanical, thermal, chemical, electrical, and vapour properties of each, side by side. ETFE is effectively the high-strength version of the other three in this group, often featuring slightly diminished capacities in other fields by comparison. Combustion of ETFE occurs in the same way as a number of other fluoropolymers, in terms of releasing hydrofluoric acid (HF). HF is extremely corrosive and toxic, and so appropriate caution must be exercised. ETFE film is self-cleaning (due to its nonstick surface) and recyclable. It is prone to punctures by sharp edges and therefore mostly used for roofs. As a film for roofing it could be stretched (up to 3x) and still be taut if some variation in size occurs (due to thermal expansion, for example.) Employing heat welding, tears can be repaired with a patch or multiple sheets assembled into larger panels. ETFE has an approximate tensile strength of 42 MPa (6100 psi), with a working temperature range of to ( to or to ). ETFE resins are resistant to ultraviolet light. An accelerated weathering test (comparable to 30 years‚Äô exposure) produced almost no signs of film deterioration.  Applications  The Eden Project, Cornwall, UK. Biomes are constructed with ETFE cushions.

The panels of the Eden Project are also made from ETFE, and the Tropical Islands have a 20,000 m2 window made from this translucent material. Another key use of ETFE is for the covering of electrical and fiber-optic wiring used in high-stress, low-fume-toxicity and high-reliability situations. Aircraft and spacecraft wiring are primary examples. Some small cross-section wires like the wire used for the wire-wrap technique are coated with ETFE. As a dual laminate, ETFE can be bonded with FRP as a thermoplastic liner and used in pipes, tanks, and vessels for additional corrosion protection. ETFE is commonly used in the nuclear industry for tie or cable wraps and in the aviation and aerospace industries for wire coatings. This is because ETFE has better mechanical toughness than PTFE. In addition, ETFE exhibits a high- energy radiation resistance and can withstand moderately high temperatures for a long period. Commercially deployed brand names of ETFE include Tefzel by DuPont, Fluon by Asahi Glass Company, Neoflon ETFE by Daikin, and Texlon by Vector Foiltec. Due to its high temperature resistance ETFE is also used in film mode as a mold-release film. ETFE film offered by Guarniflon or Airtech International and Honeywell is used in aerospace applications such as carbon fiber pre-preg curing as a release film for molds or hot high-pressure plates.

Salins owes its name to its saline waters which shaped the town's history for centuries, and continue to attract visitors today, for the town's bedrock contains salt and gypsum deposits. In 2009 the historic saltworks were added to the list of UNESCO World Heritage sites. The saltworks at Salins-Les-Bains are closely associated with another World Heritage site, the Royal Saltworks at Arc-et-Senans. Geography Salins is situated in the narrow valley of the Furieuse, between two fortified hills, Fort Belin and Fort Saint-Andr√©, while to the north rises Mont Poupet (851 m). History The territory of Salins, which was enfeoffed in the 10th century by the Abbey of Saint Maurice-en-Valais to the counts of M√¢con, remained in possession of their descendants till 1175. Maurette de Salins, heiress of this dynasty, brought the lordship to the house of Vienne, and her granddaughter sold it in 1225 to Hugh IV of Burgundy, who ceded it in 1237 to John of Chalon in exchange for the county of Chalon. John's descendants, counts and dukes of Burgundy, emperors and kings of the house of Austria all bore the title of sire de Salins. In 1477 Salins was taken by the French and temporarily made the seat of the parliament of Franche-Comt√© by Louis XI. In 1668 and 1674 it was retaken by the French and thenceforward remained in their power. In 1825 the town was almost destroyed by fire. In 1871 it successfully resisted the German troops in the Franco-Prussian War. French composer Charles Galibert (1826‚Äì1858) was born in Salins-les-Bains. Until the early 20th century the slopes surrounding the town were largely covered in vines, which were however almost entirely abandoned after the phylloxera crisis decimated the vineyard. Little trace of this former activity remains today. For much of the 20th century the town was also famed for its potters, but today only three craftsmen continue to uphold this local tradition. Population Sights The town has a Romanesque church, St-Anatoile, which has been well restored, and an h√¥tel de ville from the 18th century. A 17th-century Jesuit chapel contains a library, established in 1593, and a museum. Transportation Salins-les-Bains is on the Paris to Lausanne (Switzerland) road.

Paige Patterson (born October 19, 1942) served as the fifth president of Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary in Wake Forest, N.C., from 1992 to 2003, as president of the Southern Baptist Convention (SBC) from 1998 to 2000, and as the eighth president of the Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, Texas, from 2003 until his firing in 2018. He played a major role in the Southern Baptist \\"conservative resurgence\\", called \\"Fundamentalist Takeover\\" by opponents. He has been alternately described as a fundamentalist and a conservative evangelical.  Education  *B.A. ‚Äì Hardin-Simmons University, Abilene, Texas *Th.M. ‚Äì New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary *Th.D. ‚Äì New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary  Career  Patterson started preaching while still in his teens. He held several Pastorates before becoming president of the Criswell Center for Biblical Studies (now Criswell College) in Dallas, Texas, a position from which he was eventually fired. Patterson formed a strong connection with W.A. Criswell of the First Baptist Church of Dallas while in this position. After 17 years he became president of the Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary in Wake Forest, North Carolina (1992‚Äì2003). Patterson was elected president of the Southern Baptist Convention (SBC) in both 1998 and 1999. He has lectured and preached extensively and authored and edited many books and journals. In 2003, he became the 8th president of Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, Texas. He was removed as president in May 2018 over his past advice to women concerning marital abuse and rape, then stripped of his positions of emeritus president and theologian-in-residence for his handling of several rape investigations. He served on the board of trustees of Cedarville University until he resigned on May 31, 2018. Paige Patterson (left) with a Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary student  Proponent of Expository Preaching  Patterson began preaching as a teenager, and continues to preach in churches and seminaries around the world. He is a strong proponent of expository preaching, once saying, \\"There is no genuinely good preaching except exposition\\". He has written on the topic of preaching, including the introduction to the 2010 publication Text-Driven Preaching: God‚Äôs Word at the Heart of Every Sermon.  Role in the SBC Conservative Resurgence  Patterson is best known for his prominent role in the Southern Baptist Convention conservative resurgence starting in 1979 with the election of Adrian Rogers as Convention President. Believing SBC seminaries and other SBC institutions had drifted away from their conservative Biblical roots, Patterson joined with Judge Paul Pressler of Houston, TX to carry out a plan that included exposing the theology taught and practiced by the leadership in SBC institutions, which Patterson and Pressler described as liberal theology. The main issue that divided the SBC was the nature of scripture, particularly, whether or not it is inerrant. Patterson, Pressler, and a host of self-described conservative pastors and laymen began to spread the word that the teaching of SBC leadership was not reflective of their constituents, who were paying their salaries. Patterson and the conservatives won the support of hundreds of like- minded churches, and as many as 40,000 messengers (church members willing to travel to the annual Southern Baptist Convention to vote) by using the inerrancy argument as the issue to gather support. In 1998, Patterson was elected as president of the Southern Baptist Convention. Patterson's influence has been felt at all levels of Southern Baptist life. The seminaries have for the most part become conservative institutions. Local churches have been hiring pastors educated at schools led by conservatives. Missionaries have also influenced by Patterson's leadership. By the time Patterson was appointed president of Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, Texas, in 2003, the conservative leadership required that all faculty sign documents stating their allegiance to Southern Baptist doctrine, most notably, the Baptist Faith and Message. Patterson has been associated with the Council for National Policy, an umbrella organization and networking group for social conservative activists in the United States. =Seminary President= Dr. Patterson served as the president of Criswell College in Dallas, Texas from 1975 to 1992. Following his time at Criswell College, Patterson became president of two prominent Southern Baptist seminaries: first Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary (SEBTS) in Wake Forest, N.C., from 1992 to 2003, and then Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary (SWBTS) from 2003 to 2018.  Views on women  Patterson has attracted interest because of his stance on the role of women in church and his opposition to ordaining women as ministers. According to Patterson, the \\"highest and noblest calling of God\\" for women is that of \\"mother and grandmother\\". Additionally, Patterson's interpretation of the Bible includes \\"an assignment from God, in this case that a woman not be involved in a teaching or ruling capacity over men\\". In an interview taped in 2000, Patterson recounted how he counseled a woman, who told him about being abused by her husband, that she should pray for God's intervention. When the woman \\"came to him later with two black eyes\\" and said \\"I hope you're happy\\", Patterson said he was \\"very happy\\" because the next day the husband had come to church for the first time. As reported in The Washington Post, in April 2018 Patterson stated on the Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary website that: :\\"I have also said that I have never recommended or prescribed divorce. How could I as a minister of the Gospel? The Bible makes clear the way in which God views divorce ... I do not apologize for my stand for the family and for seeking to mend a marriage through forgiveness rather than divorce‚Äù. Patterson explains a wife‚Äôs submission to her husband as voluntary rather than coerced: ‚Äú‚ÄúIt means voluntarily to line up in the right order that God has given, and the husband is loving his wife sacrificially as much as Jesus Christ loved the church and gave Himself for it, so that all the husband can think of is, ‚ÄòHoney, what can I do for you? What can I do to serve you? How can I make your life better?‚Äô And all the time she is submitting herself to her husband and saying, ‚ÄòYou just lead and, honey, I‚Äôll follow.‚Äô‚Äù \\"It depends on the level of abuse, to some degree. ‚Ä¶ I have never in my ministry counseled anyone to seek a divorce and that‚Äôs always wrong counsel\\". Instead of divorce he recommended temporary separation in cases of extreme spousal abuse. He has also compared female submissiveness to submissiveness to a police officer. Although the officer and Patterson would be equal before God, \\"He is above me,‚Äù Patterson wrote. Just as ‚ÄúGod gave him an assignment that affects me and made him a minister of God to correct my evil ways,\\" so he believed women should submit to men. =Women faculty at SWBTS= While Patterson was president of SWBTS, there were two female faculty members in the School of Theology: his wife, Dorothy, and Candi Finch, a loyal ally of the Pattersons. Both Dorothy Patterson and Finch were fired in 2018 following Paige Patterson's ouster. =Abuse cover-up= Patterson was a defendant in a 2018 suit which alleged he assisted in covering up sexual abuse by fellow Southern Baptist Paul Pressler. The claims against Patterson were dismissed as they exceeded the statute of limitations.  Removal as President of SWBTS and firing  = From president to president emeritus and theologian-in-residence = On May 22, 2018, the board of trustees of Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary (SWBTS) met to discuss \\"new leadership for the benefit of the future mission of the Seminary\\". They removed Patterson as President and conferred the title of President Emeritus upon him, with compensation, and provided for him and his wife to live in the seminary's Baptist Heritage Center as the school's first theologians-in- residence. = Fired from all positions at SWBTS = However, on May 30, 2018 the seminary's Executive Committee made an abrupt change: Patterson was terminated \\"effective immediately\\" in response to mishandling the investigation of the alleged rape of a student at Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary in 2003, based on their internal review reported to SWBTS. During that investigation, Patterson had sent an email \\"to the Chief of Campus Security in which Dr. Patterson discussed meeting with the student alone so that he could ‚Äòbreak her down‚Äô and that he preferred no officials be present\\"; the SWBTS Executive Committee stated that the \\"attitude expressed by Dr. Patterson in that email is antithetical to the core values of our faith and to SWBTS\\". The Executive Committee also found \\"undeniable\\" evidence that \\"contradicts a statement previously provided by Dr. Patterson in response to a direct question by a board member\\". Patterson has denied any mishandling of any investigation. The SWBTS Executive Committee removed \\"all the benefits, rights and privileges provided by the May 22‚Äì23 board meeting, including the title of President Emeritus, the invitation to reside at the Baptist Heritage Center as theologian-in-residence and ongoing compensation\\". The SWBTS trustees voted on October 17, 2018 to uphold the decision to fire Patterson, though 4 of the 34 trustees present voted against and claimed that the process of his firing was flawed. At that same meeting, trustees voting by a similar margin to fire an SWBTS faculty member, apparently for voicing opposition to Patterson's firing. The firing also led to the termination of Dorothy Patterson's pet project of installing over 60 stained glass windows on the SWBTS campus to honor leaders in the conservative resurgence. The project was begun in 2013 as a 12-year project, and some 32 windows had been installed by April 2019, at which time the trustees decided to remove the windows in the best interests of the seminary. Two of the windows depicted Paige and Dorothy Patterson. = Impact beyond SWBTS = Patterson's firing affected his standing in Baptist circles more broadly. Since 2003, Patterson had served on the board of trustees of Cedarville University, a Baptist institution. On May 30, 2018, Cedarville's president, Thomas White, who had worked with Patterson at both SEBTS and SWBTS, issued a statement that emphasized Cedarville's policies for reporting abuse and his uncertainty as to whether Patterson would continue to serve on the board. By May 31, 1,300 people had signed a petition for Patterson's resignation from Cedarville's board of trustees, which Patterson submitted that day. Patterson's standing in the SBC was also affected by his firing. After receiving pressure from various Southern Baptist leaders, including SBC president Steve Gaines, Patterson announced in a letter to Gaines on June 8, 2018, that he was declining to give the keynote sermon at the annual meeting of the SBC the following week. Patterson said his decision came from his desires \\"to protect my family as much as I can\\", \\"to contribute to harmony within the Southern Baptist Convention\\", and \\"to respond to the request that has come especially from you and other Southern Baptist leadership\\". Although Patterson did not attend the SBC annual meeting in June 2018, the scandal prompted a greater focus on gender for attendees, who passed two resolutions on gender. One of those resolutions affirmed roles for women in the church, while the other condemned all forms of abuse against women and insisted that Baptist leaders report alleged sexual abuse to police. Patterson is still revered in some Baptist circles. During a chapel service on March 12, 2019, Truett McConnell University (TMU), an SBC school in Georgia, the school's dean and president presented Dr. and Mrs. Patterson with a plaque that renamed TMU's annual spring lecture series after them and claimed that they \\"provide an exemplary role model of Christian living.\\" = Backlash to Patterson's firing = About two dozen SBC donors attempted to return Patterson to his positions of president emeritus and theologian-in-residence at SWBTS and to punish those who fired him. At the SBC's annual meeting in June 2018, they brought a resolution to the floor to fire all the trustees of SWBTS who voted to fire Patterson; that resolution was \\"soundly defeated\\". Then in early July 2018, several donors to SWBTS signed a public letter threatening to withhold funding from the seminary unless the SWBTS board reconsidered Patterson's firing. Their letter called the SWBTS Executive Committee's firing of Patterson a \\"travesty\\" and stated: \\"Dr. and Mrs. Patterson continue to have our absolute and unwavering support. They are both esteemed scholars and were stately ambassadors for the Seminary\\". Karen Swallow Prior, then a professor at Liberty University, said, \\"What we‚Äôre seeing is people who are committed to a person rather than to an institution or to the convention, putting their loyalty to a person ahead of their adherence to the principles of the institution\\". = Patterson's public ministry since firing = Since his firing, Patterson has received public criticism for two sermons at a revival in September 2018. In the first sermon, he repeatedly highlighted the weight of a \\"fat\\" female parishioner, which led to charges that he was \\"body-shaming women\\". His second sermon referenced the biblical story of Joseph, who was falsely accused by a woman of sexual abuse, to criticize some women in the Me Too movement. Some Baptists who had previously called for Patterson's removal from SWBTS argued that his sermons showed a lack of repentance for his previous comments about women. In mid- October 2018, Patterson accepted the opportunity to co-teach an ethics course at Southern Evangelical Seminary (SES). His co-teacher for the course was Richard Land, the former head of the SBC's Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission and presently the president of SES. Richard Mouw, president emeritus of Fuller Theological Seminary, noted that Patterson was an odd choice to teach the class because he was not a specialist in ethics and suggested that Patterson's hire was \\"a political statement\\" by the very conservative SES that \\"'He's one of us. We want to keep his voice strong.'\\" Lawsuit for handling of rape allegations In May 2019, an SWBTS former student, named \\"Jane Roe\\" in legal papers, filed a lawsuit against Paige Patterson for threatening, intimidating, and humiliating her when she told him that she had been repeatedly raped at gunpoint in 2014 and 2015 by another seminary student, named \\"John Doe\\". According to the lawsuit, Patterson told Roe to recount \\"lurid and graphic details\\" of her rape before a group of men, told her that the rape was a \\"good thing\\", and \\"seemed to enjoy making Roe even more uncomfortable with his questions\\". Patterson also reportedly said he was \\"too busy\\" to deal with the allegations, \\"callously rejected\\" her requests for prayers and financial assistance, and told seminary faculty members about the alleged rape without her consent. Doe was expelled after Fort Worth police searched his room and found nine firearms, which violated the seminary's weapon's policy. The suit claims Roe is the same student about whom Patterson had promised to \\"break her down\\". Patterson allegedly later met with Roe and said that Doe has supplied him with nude photos that proved they had a consensual sexual relationship; Roe said the photos were taken while Doe was raping her at gunpoint. When Roe's mother asked Patterson how Doe had been allowed to attend SWBTS with his violent criminal past, Patterson reportedly \\"lunged across the table, firmly pointed his finger in her face and threatened to ‚Äòunleash‚Äô lawyers on her if she dared question his leadership\\".

Tamarama is 6 kilometres east of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of Waverley Council. Tamarama has a small ocean beach about 1 kilometre south of Bondi Beach and a couple of hundred metres north of Bronte Beach. The suburb is mostly residential and the beach and adjacent parklands have been popular places for recreation such as swimming, surfing, sunbaking and picnics for more than a century. History Initially known as Dixon Bay by early European settlers, the name was changed to Tamarama in the 1800s. Tamarama is probably a derivation of the Aboriginal name 'Gamma Gamma' (possibly meaning 'storm'), which appeared on maps of the coastline in the 1860s by the Military or Naval Authority. In the late 1890s a genteel campaign of civil disobedience was undertaken to open up Sydney beaches to daytime bathing. Inspector of schools and writer George Philip was credited with winning the day in Tamarama. left In 1887 Sydney's first coastal amusement park, and one of the earliest in Australia, opened at Tamarama. Named The Bondi Aquarium its greatest attraction was a plunging roller coaster that dived and twisted over the beach. People flocked to the attraction, not only for the rides, but for vaudeville acts and aquarium creatures, including seals and a tiger shark. On the evening of 11 July 1891, fire destroyed the aquarium and pavilion, but it rose from the ashes in September the same year, and continued to entertain Sydney's populace. The last identified concert at the Aquarium was a fund raiser for the Waverley Benevolent Society in July 1906. Ownership and management changed several times throughout its existence, until the site was finally sold by Mrs Margaret J. Lachaume in 1906 to William Anderson who transformed the amusement park, renaming it Wonderland City. In 1906 Wonderland City opened and replaced the Bondi Aquarium as the latest attraction at Tamarama. Powered by its own steam plant, the amusement park featured an airship suspended over the bay and an elephant named Alice available for rides on the beach. There was also a miniature railway operating on a two-mile track over the cliff tops. Frequent battles with local residents over beach access, charges of animal cruelty and an incident with the airship saw a decline in numbers. After a few years of low crowds and poor revenue Wonderland City closed in 1911. In 1920, the NSW Government bought the area and proclaimed it Tamarama Park. There is still a Wonderland Avenue at Tamarama. The first mayor of Waverley (David Fletcher) lived in Tamarama.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollen, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia , page 33 Population In the 2016 Census, there were 1,622 people in Tamarama. 54.5% of people were born in Australia. The next most common country of birth was England at 7.6%. 72.1% of people spoke only English at home. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 40.6% and Catholic 18.4%.  Tamarama Beach Tamarama Tamarama Beach is a small beach between two prominent headlands, with a sand filled valley to the back, surrounded by pleasant parkland and picnic areas. Tamarama is an extremely narrow beach and deceptive for its size. Tamarama Beach is often referred to as Glamarama (or Glamourama), owing to the alleged abundance of glamorous people who sunbathe (often topless), on what must be one of the smallest strips of sand in the state. Tamarama Surf Club is located on the northern side, perched up on the headland where it overlooks the entire beach. Because of its deep water, small size and easterly aspect, Tamarama is dangerous for most swimmers even in a moderate ocean swell. Tamarama is considered the most dangerous patrolled beach in New South Wales, with more rescues per thousand bathers than any other of Sydney's beaches, by the Tamarama Surf Life Saving Club. A small swell can produce rip currents of up to 2 metres a second (which is about the speed of the current 50m men's world record). One or two rip currents are always present, making the entire surf zone virtually all rip. When the swell really rolls in, an offshore rock shelf shapes a stunning 12 to 15 foot wave that draws committed board-riders, photographers and onlookers, taking in the grand spectacle from the cliffs above. Just to the north of Tamarama Beach is the locality of Mackenzies Bay, which is also a part of the shoreline boundary of Tamarama. Sport and recreation Tamarama is represented in one of the most popular sporting competitions across Australia, the National Rugby League competition, by the local team the Sydney Roosters, officially the Eastern Suburbs District Rugby League Football Club (ESDRLFC). =Events= thumb Tamarama is in the middle of the \\"Bondi to Bronte Ocean Walk\\" which is the most popular coastal walking route in Australia. The beach and parkland form part of the exhibition space for Sculpture by the Sea, a free annual event in late spring and the most popular outdoor artistic exhibition in Australia. =Surf Lifesaving Club= The beach is home to one of the first surf lifesaving clubs in the world, Tamarama Surf Life Saving Club, that was founded in 1906. The Club proudly boasts an enviable record of not having lost a single life to a mishap in the surf in over 100 years of surf life saving patrols. This is a remarkable achievement given that the under tows or \\"rips\\" in the surf zone are regarded as being amongst the most dangerous on the east coast of the Australian continent.http://www.tamaramaslsc.com/ Tamarama SLSC Tragically, on July 1, 2014 Matthew Richell, CEO of Hachette Australia died from misadventure when he was swept up against the rocks of a sea cliff by the surf and then carried back into deeper water where he drowned as a result of being incapacitated by head injuries. He was surfing during a time Tamarama beach is not patrolled by lifeguards and could not be resuscitated by emergency crews.

Finally, the Blackwater joins the Dry Fork to form the Black Fork at the town of Hendricks, at an elevation of . Water quality =Blackwater= As with other blackwater rivers, the color of West Virginia's Blackwater River results from the leaching of tannins from the decaying leaves of vegetation adjoining the stream in its upper reaches, which are slow moving. Fallen needles from stands of eastern hemlock and red spruce contribute primarily to this, although rhododendron, mountain laurel and the sphagnum bogs of Canaan Valley also contribute. The Blackwater is also typical in having transparent, acidic, and oligotrophic (very low nutrient) water. =Acid mine drainage= Beginning in the 1880s, the Blackwater River watershed (especially the segment of the North Fork of the Blackwater River between the towns of Thomas and Douglas) suffered extreme environmental degradation due to deep mining and coke production. This was exacerbated by the surface mining activities of the 1960s and '70s, which brought about a severe decline in water quality due to acid mine drainage (AMD). In recent years, the limestone treatment of AMD in the Blackwater River has met with success with the effort receiving an award from the U.S. Office of Surface Mining.U.S. Office of Surface Mining 1999 Award web page, accessed August 26, 2006 AMD is created when sulfite-bearing mineral strata are exposed to air and rainwater, such as when surface mining occurs.

He was born in Odessa and graduated from the Moscow Textile Institute in 1936 with a specialty in power engineering. Of Jewish ancestry, for which he would suffer career-wise in the Soviet Union, Semyonov joined the KGB in 1937 and was sent quickly to the United States as an intelligence officer. He enrolled at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, from which he graduated in June 1940 and shortly thereafter began working for Amtorg. Semyonov had a mastery of French and English. Semyonov worked first as a purchasing agent for the Soviet agency Machinoimport and then as head of the engineering department of the Soviet Purchasing Commission during World War II, with offices both at the commission and at Amtorg while specializing in scientific and technical espionage. A Russian Foreign Intelligence Service history quotes his KGB personnel files as stating, \\"While working from 1938 through 1944 in the United States, Major Semyonov showed himself to be one of the most active workers in the rezidentura [station] and credits him with connecting to 20 agents along the scientific and technical line\\". In 1942 Semyonov persuaded Vasily Zarubin to transfer Julius Rosenberg and his contacts from the CPUSA- Jacob Golos channel to the direct control of the Rezidentura, with himself as the assigned case officer. The actual transfer occurred on Labor Day weekend, 7 September 1942, at a meeting in Central Park. Bernard Schuster brought Rosenberg to the meeting. Rosenberg was then subjected to a thorough vetting and recruitment process to include training in tradecraft and a probationary period. Alexander Feklisov was assigned to assist in managing Rosenberg. Once the formal recruitment of Rosenberg was completed Semyonov used Rosenberg to conduct formal recruitments of two of Rosenberg's friends from City College of New York, Joel Barr and William Perl. Semyonov persuaded into collaboration a large group of young scientists and specialists, through whom was obtained a significant quantity of valuable materials on \\"ENORMOZ\\" (Manhattan Project), radio electronics, jet aviation, chemistry, medicine. Semyonov received from Bruno Pontecorvo in January 1943 an extensive report on the first nuclear chain reaction. Pontecorvo also relayed to Semyonov in early 1943 that \\"Fermi was prepared to provide information\\". In 1943 the active intelligence operation of Semyonov drew the attention of American counter espionage, and Semyonov was recalled to the Soviet Union. Later he had assignments in France and in Moscow and was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-colonel. In 1950, in association with the Doctors' plot, the foreign intelligence agency began dismissing persons of Jewish ethnicity. In spite of significant positive results in his record, Semyonov was discharged. He worked as translator in the publishing house Progress. Semyonov was rehabilitated in the 1970s. For the successful completion of special missions concerning scientific and technical intelligence, including on the atomic programs, Semyonov was awarded the Order of the Red Star and awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labour.

Strawberry Hills is located east of Central railway station, within the suburbs of Surry Hills and Redfern which are part of the local government area of the City of Sydney. Its name reflects the area's early use as farmland where fruit crops were cultivated. The neighbourhood features mostly mixed commercial/residential & business developments with medium to high density residential developments, including terrace housing and newer apartment blocks. Strawberry Hills is also the home of a number of significant cultural organisations including Opera Australia, The Australia Council for the Arts, and numerous notable entertainment venues including the Belvoir Street Theatre and the Strawberry Hills Hotel, a renowned traditional Australian jazz venue located on Elizabeth Street. Image:Strawberry Hills 1.JPG Australia Post NSW headquarters File:Cleveland st boys high sydney.jpg Cleveland Street High School History The area originally known as Strawberry Hill, was named after the hill centred under 'Northcott Place' at Surry Hills. Strawberry Hill was part of a 70-acre land grant to John Palmer in 1794. Facing substantial debts, his holdings were subdivided into large blocks for the Provost Marshal's Sale of 1814. John Connell farmed the largest of these blocks south of Devonshire Street. He sold the property to Thomas Horton James, who subdivided the block as the Strawberry Hill Estate in 1832. Strawberry Hill was a huge mound of sand, made mobile in the 1820s by the destruction of undergrowth by woodcutters, turfcutters, graziers and quarriers. During the 1830s the sand began to advance on the new Strawberry Hill Estate. Unregulated and unrestrained low- cost housing developed in the area. By the 1870s the area was well known for its poor sanitary conditions. After the construction of the Central Railway Station and associated resumptions and demolition, industry became established in Surry Hills, with warehouses springing up in streets like Marshall Street. Inner-city housing stock became depleted. A cycling velodrome and associated sporting facility was built on Strawberry Hill in the early 20th century. After World War II, regeneration of Surry Hills as a residential area began with an influx of migrants and change of policy. The New South Wales Housing Commission demolished the original housing stock and built three storey medium-density housing on Devonshire and Clisdell Streets. By 1961 the fifteen-storey tower \\"Northcott Place\\" was completed on Strawberry Hill.

Songs are sung a cappella from the Sacred Harp tune book. The Convention was organized on April 28, 1900 at the Round Top School House, in Caldwell County, Texas, as the South Union Singing Convention. It is the second oldest continuous Sacred Harp convention in Texas. Several older conventions are no longer extant. During its history, the Southwest Texas Musical Convention has been held in at least a dozen Texas counties. Originally an annual two or three day convention, the delegates later changed to meet on each fifth weekend of the year. The Convention presently meets on Saturday and Sunday of fifth-Sunday weekends in the spring and fall. The spring session is held at Bethel Primitive Baptist Church, at McMahan, Texas. The fall session is held in Austin, Texas. The current tunebook in use by the Convention is The Sacred Harp, Revised Cooper Edition, 2012, first revised by W. M. Cooper and others in 1902.

It is on the east side of the Nepean River. Until recently, it was mainly farmland with a winery, an electricity substation and the Spring Farm Advanced Resource Recovery Facility, but it is currently in the process of suburban redevelopment. History Springs Lake South Boardwalk The area now known as Spring Farm was probably originally home to the Tharawal people, based in the Illawarra region, although the Western Sydney-based Darug people and the Southern Highlands-based Gandangara people were also known to have inhabited the greater Camden area. Very early relations with British settlers were cordial but as farmers started clearing and fencing the land affecting food resources in the area, clashes between the groups arose until 1816 when a number of indigenous people were massacred and the remainder retreated from direct conflict with the settlers. In 1805, wool pioneer John Macarthur, was granted 5,000 acres (20 km¬≤) at Cowpastures. After the land was cleared, it was used for farming for most of the next 200 years until Sydney's suburban sprawl reached the town of Camden and the farmland was subdivided into housing blocks. Transport Spring Farm is off the Camden Bypass. There are a number of bus services controlled by Busabout Sydney that run through the suburb. The nearest railway station is Macarthur. Landmarks = Springs Lake= Springs Lake is a man made lake in Spring Farm with a timber boardwalk, and picnic facilities. = Spring Farm Dog Park= Spring Farm Dog Park opened in July 2016 and can be located next to Springs Lake near Burrell Road.  Governance  Spring Farm lies in the south ward of Camden Council, currently represented by Debby Dewbery, Eva Campbell and Greg Copeland. The suburb is contained within the federal electorate of Division of Hume, represented by Angus Taylor (Liberal), and the state electorate of Camden, currently held by Chris Patterson (Liberal).  Education  There is one public school in the area. Spring Farm Public School was built in 2016 and is located on Barley Road.

It drew the interest of dancers from around the world due to the academy‚Äôs large number of instructors who worked in fields such as Television, Stage and Film. Examples of which are Carrie Hamilton (deceased daughter of comedian and actress, Carol Burnett) and Michael Rooney (son of acting legend Mickey Rooney) who taught classes there in the 1970s. Other teachers, such as Joe Bennett, Carol Connor, Hama, Jacqui, Bill Landrum, Joe Tremaine, and Karen Voight, launched themselves and their own dance academies into success as a result of Dupree Dance Academy. Equally as important to the success of the studio was the technical discipline introduced into the field of jazz dance. Dupree partnered with Dolores Terry (dancer, teacher, choreographer and eventually producer), who brought her expertise to the creation of the academy's stringent technical warm-up. It included 4 distinct levels (beginner through advanced) and included ballet, Horton, Graham and Cole techniques. Professional level classes were the only ones at the academy in which the technical warm-up might differ, at the preference of the choreographer teaching. In this way the Dupree Dance Academy nurtured and developed professional level dancers as well as providing them with opportunities to be directly involved with working choreographers. It was when Roland partnered with Mary Jean Valente to open Dupree Casting that the first Casting Service specialising in Dancers for Movies, Television and Commercial Print Media was created. As a result, Mary Jean Valente brought together Directors, Producers and Production Companies in the desire to eliminate the cattle call process of dance auditioning. However, Roland Dupree sold his business in the mid 1980s and has since been hosting dance conventions around America with Dupree Dance Expo. The Roland Dupree Dance Academy itself has now been taken over by the child acting facility, Youth Academy of Dramatic Arts (YADA).

It was developed by Frank Gotch and is used in the United States to measure dialysis. Despite the name, it is quite different from Kt/V. In theory, both peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis can be quantified with std Kt/V. Derivation Standardized Kt/V is motivated by the steady state solution of the mass transfer equation often used to approximate kidney function (equation 1), which is also used to define clearance. :V \\\\frac{dC}{dt} = -K \\\\cdot C + \\\\dot{m} \\\\qquad(1) where *\\\\dot{m} is the mass generation rate of the substance - assumed to be a constant, i.e. not a function of time (equal to zero for foreign substances/drugs) [mmol/min] or [mol/s] *t is dialysis time [min] or [s] *V is the volume of distribution (total body water) [L] or [m3] *K is the clearance [mL/min] or [m3/s] *C is the concentration [mmol/L] or [mol/m3] (in the United States often [mg/mL]) From the above definitions it follows that \\\\frac{dC}{dt} is the first derivative of concentration with respect to time, i.e. the change in concentration with time. Derivation equation 1 is described in the article clearance (medicine). The solution of the above differential equation (equation 1) is :C = \\\\frac{\\\\dot{m}}{K} + \\\\left(C_{o}-\\\\frac{\\\\dot{m}}{K}\\\\right) e^{-\\\\frac{K \\\\cdot t}{V}} \\\\qquad(2) where *Co is the concentration at the beginning of dialysis [mmol/L] or [mol/m3] *e is the base of the natural logarithm The steady state solution is : C_{\\\\infty} = \\\\frac {\\\\dot{m}}{K} \\\\qquad(3a) This can be written as : K = \\\\frac {\\\\dot{m}}{C_{\\\\infty}} \\\\qquad(3b) Equation 3b is the equation that defines clearance. It is the motivation for K' (the equivalent clearance): : {K'} = \\\\frac {\\\\dot{m}}{C_o} \\\\qquad(4) where *K' is the equivalent clearance [mL/min] or [m3/s] *\\\\dot{m} is the mass generation rate of the substance - assumed to be a constant, i.e. not a function of time [mmol/min] or [mol/s] *Co is the concentration at the beginning of dialysis [mmol/L] or [mol/m3] Equation 4 is normalized by the volume of distribution to form equation 5: : \\\\frac {K'}{V} = \\\\frac {\\\\dot{m}}{C_o \\\\cdot V} \\\\qquad(5) Equation 5 is multiplied by an arbitrary constant to form equation 6: : \\\\mbox{const} \\\\cdot \\\\frac {K'}{V} = \\\\mbox{const} \\\\cdot \\\\frac {\\\\dot{m}}{C_o \\\\cdot V} \\\\qquad(6) Equation 6 is then defined as standardized Kt/V (std Kt/V): :\\\\mbox{std} \\\\frac{K \\\\cdot t}{V} \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ \\\\mbox{const} \\\\cdot \\\\frac {\\\\dot{m}}{C_o \\\\cdot V} \\\\qquad(7) where * const is 7√ó24√ó60√ó60 seconds, the number of seconds in a week. Interpretation of std Kt/V Standardized Kt/V can be interpreted as a concentration normalized by the mass generation per unit volume of body water. Equation 7 can be written in the following way: :\\\\mbox{std} \\\\frac{K \\\\cdot t}{V} \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\mbox{ const} \\\\cdot \\\\frac {\\\\dot{m}}{V} \\\\frac{1}{C_o} \\\\qquad(8) If one takes the inverse of Equation 8 it can be observed that the inverse of std Kt/V is proportional to the concentration of urea (in the body) divided by the production of urea per time per unit volume of body water. :\\\\left[ std \\\\frac{K \\\\cdot t}{V} \\\\right]^{-1} \\\\propto \\\\frac{C_o}{\\\\dot{m}/V} \\\\qquad(9) Comparison to Kt/V Kt/V and standardized Kt/V are not the same. Kt/V is a ratio of the pre- and post-dialysis urea concentrations. Standardized Kt/V is an equivalent clearance defined by the initial urea concentration (compare equation 8 and equation 10). Kt/V is defined as (see article on Kt/V for derivation): : \\\\frac{K \\\\cdot t}{V} = \\\\ln \\\\frac{C_o}{C} \\\\qquad(10) Since Kt/V and std Kt/V are defined differently, Kt/V and std Kt/V values cannot be compared. Advantages of std Kt/V * Can be used to compare any dialysis schedule (i.e. nocturnal home hemodialysis vs. daily hemodialysis vs. conventional hemodialysis) * Applicable to peritoneal dialysis. * Can be applied to patients with residual renal function; it is possible to demonstrate that Co is a function of the residual kidney function and the \\"cleaning\\" provided by dialysis. * The model can be applied to substances other than urea, if the clearance, K, and generation rate of the substance, \\\\dot{m}, are known. Criticism/disadvantages of std Kt/V * It is complex and tedious to calculate, although web-based calculators are available to do this fairly easily. * Many nephrologists have difficulty understanding it. * Urea is not associated with toxicity. * Standardized Kt/V only models the clearance of urea and thus implicitly assumes the clearance of urea is comparable to other toxins. It ignores molecules that (relative to urea) have diffusion-limited transport - so called middle molecules. * It ignores the mass transfer between body compartments and across the plasma membrane (i.e. intracellular to extracellular transport), which has been shown to be important for the clearance of molecules such as phosphate. * The Standardized Kt/V is based on body water volume (V). The Glomerular filtration rate, an estimate of normal kidney function, is usually normalized to body surface area (S). S and V differ markedly between small vs. large people and between men and women. A man and a woman of the same S will have similar levels of GFR, but their values for V may differ by 15-20%. Because standardized Kt/V incorporates residual renal function into the calculations, it makes the assumption that kidney function should scale by V. This may disadvantage women and smaller patients of either sex, in whom V is decreased to a greater extent than S. Calculating stdKt/V from treatment Kt/V and number of sessions per week The various ways of computing standardized Kt/V by Gotch, Leypoldt, and the FHN trial network are all a bit different, as assumptions differ on equal spacing of treatments, use of a fixed or variable volume model, and whether or not urea rebound is taken into effect. One equation, proposed by Leypoldt and modified by Depner that is cited in the KDOQI 2006 Hemodialysis Adequacy Guidelines and which is the basis for a web calculator for stdKt/V is as follows: stdKt/V = \\\\frac { \\\\frac {10080 \\\\cdot (1 - e^{-eKt/V})}{t} }{ \\\\frac {1 - e^{-eKtV}}{spKt/V} + \\\\frac{10080}{N \\\\cdot t} - 1} where stdKt/V is the standardized Kt/V spKt/V is the single-pool Kt/V, computed as described in Kt/V section using a simplified equation or ideally, using urea modeling, and eKt/V is the equilibrated Kt/V, computed from the single-pool Kt/V (spKt/V) and session length (t) using, for example, the Tattersall equation: ekt/V = spKt/V \\\\cdot \\\\frac {t}{t+C} where t is session duration in minutes, and C is a time constant, which is specific for type of access and type solute being removed. For urea, C should be 35 minutes for arterial access and 22 min for a venous access. The regular \\"rate equation\\" also can be used to determine equilibrated Kt/V from the spKt/V, as long as session length is 120 min or longer. Plot showing std Kt/V depending on regular Kt/V for different treatment regimens  Plot relating standardized Kt/V, Kt/V and treatment frequency per week. One can create a plot to relate the three grouping (standardized Kt/V, Kt/V, treatment frequency per week), sufficient to define a dialysis schedule. The equations are strongly dependent on session length; the numbers will change substantially between two sessions given at the same schedule, but with different session lengths. For the present plot, a session length of 0.4 Kt/V units per hour was assumed, with a minimum dialysis session length of 2.0 hours.

Located north of Queen's Park (with an apostrophe), an urban park that forms part of the Centennial Parklands, the suburb is located in the local government area of Waverley Council.  Geography  The suburb is bounded by the suburbs of Centennial Park to the west, Waverley and Charing Cross to the east, Bondi Junction to the north and Randwick to the south. The suburb surrounds the park with houses on three sides; however only houses on the park's northern and eastern sides form the suburb of Queens Park. The area previously formed part of the suburb of Bondi Junction but was proclaimed a suburb by the Geographical Names Board of New South Wales on 2 October 1992. Houses on the eastern side date from the Victorian era. Those on the northern and southern sides are mainly Federation. Significant sites in the suburb include the Eastern Suburb Banksia Scrub located on the south eastern side of the Moriah College site, Moriah College, and the building contained within the College that formed the former Eastern Suburbs Hospital. History Queens Park takes its name from the park of the same name on its southern border. The 1st Australian Field Ambulance was raised on 24 August 1914 at Queens Park. Nearly two months were spent at the camp before the order was given to embark.http://www.raamc.org.au/web/1fda/?History Once part of Bondi Junction, the suburb's name was officially recognised in 1992 following a submission to Waverley Council by a local author Mark Roeder, and a subsequent referendum.

Early Cycladic II (2700 BC‚Äì2300 BC). Aegean art (2800‚Äì1100 BC) is art that was created in the lands surrounding, and the islands within, the Aegean Sea during the Bronze Age, that is, until the 11th century BC, before Ancient Greek art. Because is it mostly found in the territory of modern Greece, it is sometimes called Greek Bronze Age art, though it includes not just the art of the Mycenaean Greeks, but also that of the non-Greek Cycladic and Minoan cultures, which converged over time. Cycladic art is known for its simple \\"Venus\\" figurines carved in white marble; Minoan art for its palace complexes with frescos, imagery of bulls and bull- leaping, and sophisticated pottery; and Mycenaean art for its lavish metalwork in gold, imagery of combat and massively-constructed citadels and tombs. These are very different arts, reflecting very different cultures. For this reason, many art historians consider the term \\"Aegean art\\" inappropriate, as it reflects mere geographic proximity and not cultural or artistic unity. In the Bronze Age, about 2800‚Äì1100 BC, despite cultural interchange by way of trade with the contemporaneous civilizations of Egypt and Mesopotamia, the Aegean cultures developed their own highly distinctive styles. After the Greek Bronze Age civilizations collapsed, the early part of the Greek Dark Ages saw minimal artistic production until the Protogeometric style in pottery emerged about 1050 BC, which is taken as the first phase of \\"Ancient Greek art\\". This traditional disjunction was to some extent a result of the uncertainty as to whether the Mycenaean Linear B script recorded a form of Greek or not. This was settled when the script was decoded in the 1950s, confirming it was Greek. The Minoan Linear A is clearly not Greek, however. The elegant art of the Aegean daidala figurines has recently been used at the 2004 Summer Olympics, held at Athens; specifically, during the opening ceremony and as the original idea behind the games mascots: Athina and Fivos. The Athens 2004's mascots were based on this clay model at the National Archaeological Museum. This type of figurines are furthermore particularly intriguing, because of the high resemblance they have with modern sculptures (e.g. Henry Moore's works).  Mycenaean art  Grave IV and V (Grave Circle A), Mycenae Mycenaean art is most prominently dated between 1600 and 1100 BC during the Late Helladic period of Greece. Mycenean art is named after the inhabitants of Mycenae descending from early Greek tribes of 2000 BC and approximately 3000 to 1100 BC. Mycenaean pottery is much the most common type of art to survive, and was often exported to Italy. The Warrior Vase is an unusually fine vase with painted figures. =Metalwork= Several important pieces in gold and other metals come from the Gold grave goods at Grave Circles A and B at Mycenae, including the Mask of Agamemnon, Silver Siege Rhyton, Bulls-head rhyton, and gold Nestor's Cup. The Theseus Ring, found in Athens, is one of the finest of a number of gold signet rings with tiny multi-figure scenes of high quality, many from the princely Grave Circles A and B at Mycenae. = Architecture = Mycenaean palaces were generally placed on hilltops surrounded by defensive walls constructed of large stone blocks. The Lion Gate is one of the few remaining structures of Mycenaean architecture inspiring later Greek cultures. Gates such as the latter functioned as guardians of the gate. At the center of the palaces were royal audience halls called the Megaron defined by a round hearth in the center and four columns supporting its roof. Structures always featured roofs of fired tiles. = Sculpture = There is little large or monumental sculpture from Mycenaean Greece; what there is comes mainly from palaces, or reliefs on grave stelae, in particular the group of Grave stelai from Grave Circle A, Mycenae. These show similar subjects to the metalwork from the graves, but with rather cruder workmanship. Great numbers of sites produce pottery figurines, mostly very stylized, such as the Psi and phi type figurines. There are small sculpted scenes, reliefs or intaglios, of high quality in various media, including metal, hardstone carving, and ivory. The remarkable Pylos Combat Agate seal, found in an elite grave on the mainland, was perhaps made in Crete.  Cycladic art  Group of three Cycladic figurines, early Spedos type, Keros-Syros culture (EC II) Cycladic art was produced by the Cycladic culture between 3000 BC, or even earlier, and 1100 BC, so covering both part of the Neolithic and the whole of the Bronze Age in the Greek islands. The most famous and distinctive type of Cycladic art is a large number of marble figures, almost all representing a standing female nude figure, with arms folded across chest, and a blank face apart from the nose. However, there are signs that they were originally painted. Some 1400 of these are known, most taken from unknown tombs to satisfy the art market. The female figures are thought to represent the mother and fertility goddess. Cycladic nude figurines are highly stylized and distinctive to the area. They are defined by very flat, wedge shaped bodies, columnar necks and oval featureless faces apart from well defined noses. Figures have very subtle curves and subtle markings of knees and abdomen. Cycladic pottery was often elegantly shaped and painted, with a concentration on pouring vessels like jugs, often with raised spouts. There are also kernoi stands for offerings or lamps. There are some animal figurines or animal-shaped rhyta and vessels including small boxes were made, as well as distinctive decorated round discs, around 20 cm across, that are nicknamed \\"frying pans\\" by archaeologists. The function of these is uncertain; possibly a concave side was filled with fluid and used as a mirror. There was much influence from Minoan pottery. Some very early kernoi and Frying pans had been made of stone.  Minoan art  Minoan pottery \\"Marine Style\\" flask with octopus, c. 1500-1450 BC Minoan civilization was disrupted at intervals by natural disasters and perhaps invasions, before eventually becoming controlled by the Mycenaens. Minoan art is very elegant, rhythmic and full of movement. = Architecture = The Minoan civilization is known for constructing several large and great palaces, most commonly Knossos, Phaistos, and Malia which were destroyed around 1700 BC and rebuilt and then suffered some destruction again around 1500 BC. The \\"new\\" palaces are the main source of information on Minoan architecture. The palace of Knossos called the Palace of Minos is the most elaborate and ambitious of the three. It is characterized by a vast number of rooms over a large amount of land. It has currently been excavated and partially restored. Minoan architecture is defined by its numerous porticoes, staircases, storerooms, workshops, and air shafts that would have provided the structure with an open feeling. Interior rooms are typically small with low ceilings, but have richly decorated walls. Although none have survived, by depiction in painting and sculpture it is known that columns in the Minoan palaces were constructed of wood. Minoan architecture are thought to be a place of not only royal residence but the administrative center and commercial activity. = Paintings, pottery and reliefs = Between 2000 and 1700 BC Minoan pottery is defined by its technical perfection and dynamic swirling ornament and its art is characterized by its naturalistic and rhythmic movement. Many murals and reliefs were scenes from nature depicting animals, birds, and sea creatures in lush vegetation; marine life being favored. Most images are flat in form and silhouetted against backgrounds of solid color. Forms from this era typically portray a weightlessness as they seem to float or sway. Human figures are painted as slim-waisted and athletic in body type for both male and female differentiating only in skin color; females are lighter in skin tone.

It is on the southern tip of the Palani Hills 4 km from Kodaikanal town, Dindigul district, Tamil Nadu state, South India. The Evershed effect was first detected at this observatory in January 1909. Solar data collected by the lab is the oldest continuous series of its kind in India. Precise observations of the equatorial electrojet are made here due to the unique geography of Kodaikanal. Ionospheric soundings, geomagnetic, F region vertical drift and surface observations are made here regularly. Summaries of the data obtained are sent to national (India Meteorological Department) and global (World Meteorological Organization, Global Atmosphere Watch) data centers.Global Atmosphere Watch, Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Testing and Research (EMPA), D√ºbendorf, Switzerland.

History As early as 1881, Mr. Blanford, then Meteorological Reporter to the government of India, recommended \\"the improvement of the work of solar observations in order to obtain accurate measures of the sun‚Äôs heating power at the earth‚Äôs surface and its periodic variations\\".MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW. MAY, 1906 In May 1882, the government astronomer at Madras, Norman Robert Pogson, proposed the need for photography and spectrography of the sun and the stars using a twenty-inch telescope, which could be at a hill station in South India. On 20 July 1893 following a famine in Madras Presidency, which underscored the need for a study of the sun to better understand monsoon patterns, a meeting of the U.K. Secretary of State, Indian Observatories Committee, chaired by Lord Kelvin, decided to establish a solar physics observatory at Kodaikanal, based on its southern, dust free, high altitude location. Michie Smith was selected to be superintendent. Starting in 1895 there was a rapid transfer of work and equipment from the Madras Observatory to Kodaikanal and the observatory was founded on 1 April 1899. The first observations were commenced at Kodaikanal in 1901.Indian Institute of Astrophysics - A Brief History, Solar Observatory at Kodaikanal, retrieved 3/13/2007.

Measurements of vector magnetic fields were initiated during the 1960s. In 1977, many of the astronomers from Kodaikanal shifted to Bangalore and established the Indian Institute of Astrophysics.Swarup Govind, \\"Historical perspective and research centres in India in the fields of solar astronomy and Sun-Earth relationship,\\" National Centre for Radio Astrophysics, TIFR, Pune 411007, India. retrieved 3/13/2007 Current activities Areas of current interest at the observatory are *Observations and interpretation of the morphological changes in active regions and their role in occurrence of transients such as solar flares. *Study of contributing factors to chromospheric calcium K indices. *Measurement of vector magnetic fields. *Photographs of ~ 100 years are being digitized for long term studies of the last ten solar cycles. *Studies on the structure and dynamics of equatorial ionosphere and its response to the solar and interplanetary variability are being carried out. *Studies of the equatorial electrojet and of the structure and dynamics of equatorial ionosphere and its response to solar and interplanetary variability are being made. *Hourly observation of surface temperature, pressure and rainfall are made here and transmitted to the India Meteorological Department and the World Meteorological Organization for use in Weather forecasting and research in the atmospheric sciences. *Public education about astronomy including tours of the facility, access to the astronomy library, night time telescopic sky viewing, and presentation of specialized university level courses, seminars and workshops. Equipment =Full disc imaging= Chromosphere of the Sun showing the red H-alpha spectral line observed during an eclipse. A 15 cm aperture English-mounted Heliostatic refractor by the French optical firm of Lerebours et Secretan of Paris, acquired in 1850 and remodeled to 20 cm by Grubb-Parsons in 1898 to serve as a photoheliograph, has been in use since the early 1900s to obtain daily 20 cm white light pictures of the sun, sky permitting. The 20 cm refractor is used occasionally for cometary and occultation observations and sometimes made available to visitors for night sky viewing. Twin spectroheliographs giving 6 cm diameter full disc photographs of the sun in K-alpha and H-alpha spectral lines are in regular use. A 46 cm diameter Foucault siderostat feeds light to a 30 cm aperture f/22, Cooke triplet lens. The two prism K-alpha spectroheliographs were acquired in 1904 and the H-alpha diffraction grating spectroheliograph was operational in 1911. Since 1912, prominent pictures over the full limb are being obtained in K by blocking the solar disc. These observations and the white light pictures are obtained around 200 days a year. Light from the 46 cm siderostat is diverted to a 15 cm Zeiss achromat objective which provides an f/15 beam and a 2 cm image. A prefilter and a daystar Ca K narrow band filter are used together with a Photometrix 1k x 1k CCD to record the K filtergram.Darling David, The Encyclopedia of Astrobiology, Astronomy, and Spaceflight, filtergram, retrieved 3/13/2007. Regular observations began in 1996. Besides synoptic observations, temporal sequences are being obtained on days of good to excellent seeing. =Solar tunnel telescope= Solar Tunnel Telescope at Kodaikanal A Grubb Parson 60 cm diameter two-mirror fused quartz coelostat mounted on 11 m tower platform directs sunlight via a flat mirror into a 60 m long underground horizontal 'tunnel'. A 38 cm aperture f/90 achromat forms a 34 cm diameter solar image at the focal plane. The telescope has an option to mount a 20 cm achromat, which provides an f/90 beam to form a 17 cm image. A Littrow-type spectrograph is the main instrument of the telescope. A 20 cm diameter, 18 m focal length achromat in conjunction with a 600 lines/mm grating gives 9 mm/A dispersion in the fifth order of the grating. Together with the 5.5 arcsec/mm spatial resolution of the image, it forms a high resolution set up for solar spectroscopy. Recording of the spectrum can be done photographically or with a Photometrix 1k x 1k CCD system. A large format CCD system is being procured to enhance the coverage of spectrum especially for the broad resonance lines and the nearby continuum. The converging solar beam from the objective can be diverted to a high dispersion spectroheliograph with Littrow arrangement using a 3.43 m achromat. The photographic camera behind the second slit is being replaced by a Raticon linear array and a data acquisition system. =Ionosondes= The lab is equipped for studying the ionospheric and geomagnetic effects of solar activity. A NBS C3 analogue ionosonde was installed in 1955, for vertical soundings of the ionosphere. Quarterly soundings were made round the clock. In 1993, a digital ionosonde model IPS 42/DBD43 was commissioned enabling five minute or better sounding rates. =Other facilities= A high frequency Doppler radar was built indigenously and made operational to study F-region Skywave dynamics. A lacour magnetometer and a Watson magnetometer were installed and have been used regularly at the observatory since the early 1900s. They also have a broadband seismograph, GPS receiver and magnetic variometers. The observatory has a popular astronomy museum on campus for the visitors. The displays are mainly pictorial, with a few models, a live solar image and the Fraunhofer spectrum also presented. The library is one of the observatory's proud possessions. It has a collection of astronomical literature, which is of archival value. The library maintains a skeletal collection of current literature in solar and solar terrestrial physics. The modern meeting and accommodation facilities are often used for national and international meetings, workshops and classes for up to 40 participants on subjects such as Kodaikanal Summer School in Physics, the Kodai-Trieste Workshop on Plasma AstrophysicsKodai-Trieste workshop on Plasma Astrophysics retrieved 3/13/2007 and the Solar Physics Winter School.Indian Institute of Astrophysics, 2006 Solar Physics Winter School, retrieved 3/13/2007.

While the character did engage in serious conversation, Mr. Moose's ultimate goal was always to maneuver Captain Kangaroo into participating in a riddle or knock-knock joke, the punchline of which would inevitably be followed by hundreds of ping pong balls raining harmlessly but annoyingly down on the Captain. This frequent set-up was a major source of hilarity for the pre- kindergarten audience. A 2-year-old could see the ping pong balls coming, but the Captain would walk right into the trap every time. The show would often have brief segments filmed at remote locations. On at least two occasions, an entire episode was handled as a remote shoot, with Mr. Moose stealing the show. One was set at the Oshkosh Air Show, where fellow puppet Bunny Rabbit climbed into a yellow aircraft without permission (Piper Cub?). Captain Kangaroo climbed in to retrieve him, only to have Bunny Rabbit crank the engine and begin a takeoff roll. Following scenes showed the Captain panicking as the craft became airborne with Bunny Rabbit at the controls. Seconds later, there came the ominous sound of a second engine. The camera changed point of view to a green hilltop, over which sprang a red tri-plane, flown not by Baron Richthofen but instead by Mr. Moose. An inverted dogfight ensued to the music of \\"Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines.\\" The other remote shoot was premised on Captain Kangaroo awaking to his surprise in the Colonial era. In short order, he met Squire Greenjeans and the mysterious Monsieur Moose who dropped hay on people because ping pong balls hadn't been invented yet. Mr. Moose was created and played by Cosmo Allegretti, who also created and played Mr. Bunny Rabbit, Dancing Bear, and the Captain's painter and handyman Dennis.  In other media In the animated television series Family Guy episode \\"Hell Comes to Quahog\\", after Joe sends a ping pong ball out a window, Peter persuades Mr. Moose to say \\"Knock, knock\\", then answers \\"Ping pong balls!\\", and ping pong balls fall on top of Peter.

Much of the area of Potts Hill is occupied by the Potts Hill Reservoir owned and operated by Sydney Water.  History  Potts Hill is named for Joseph Hyde Potts, an accountant in the Bank of New South Wales, who received a grant of in 1833.

From 1948 to 1955 workers camps were set up at Potts Hill to accommodate the European migrant workers (Poles, Czechs, Lithuanians, and Ukrainians) who were indentured from the many displaced persons brought to Australia after World War II. Due to the proximity of Regents Park, the camp was also known as the Regents Park migrant camp. Conditions at the Potts Hill camp were primitive. Known as \\"tent city\\", many workers had to live in tents, some of the huts were in bad repair and there was a lack of hot water, showers and electric coppers. In early 1951 there were nearly 1,000 men living in the camp. The local businessman who sold food to the workers neglected to install refrigeration and had a poor record for hygiene. Workers' wives were only allowed in the camp between 11 am and 5 pm on Sundays. Wives, particularly in hospitals, were often on night work, and did not have week-ends off. Sometimes married couples could not see each other for several months. The workers also experienced hostility from the union members of the Water Board.  Potts Hill radio astronomy field station  Radiophysicists Ruby Payne-Scott, Alec Little and Wilbur Christiansen at the Potts Hill Radiophysics field station in 1948. In 1948 the Division of Radiophysics of the CSIRO obtained permission from the Water Board to operate a field station on vacant land adjacent to the Potts Hill reservoir. The southern and eastern sides of the No. 1 reservoir were used for the east-west and north-south arms of the solar grating arrays. By 1952 it had become the Division's largest field station. Equipment included a 4 element Yagi and single Yagi antennas, a 16-ft x 18-ft paraboloid, a Mills Cross Telescope prototype, a 68-inch paraboloid, swept lobe interferometer Yagi aerials, a prototype of a Fleurs Cross aerial and 16 and 32 element solar grating arrays. Radiophysics continued operations until 1962 when the field station's operations were transferred to other field stations.

History Toongabbie is derived from an Aboriginal word, reported as meaning place by the water or meeting by the water. It was named in June 1792 after Governor Arthur Phillip asked the local Aboriginal people what they called the place. It is the oldest official use of an Aboriginal place-name - Parramatta which was founded earlier was first called Rose Hill. The area continued to be known as Toongabbie until the construction of the Main Western railway line and the building of the railway station of Toongabbie. Over time the location of the station and the shops around it became known as Toongabbie and the original settlement was called Old Toongabbie to differentiate the two. =European settlement= Old Toongabbie is noted for being the third settlement set up after the First Fleet arrived in 1788 and established settlements in Australia. It was founded as a Government Farm to grow food for the colony in April 1792. After eleven years, the government farm was closed and the land was given as grants to settlers and convicts who had done their time. In 1860, the railway was extended to Blacktown but it took 20 years before any arrangements were made for trains to stop at Toongabbie. The first school in Toongabbie,http://www.toongabbie-p.schools.nsw.edu.au/ Toongabbie Public School opened on the 3rd of May 1886. By April 1911, the school closed due to low enrolments. The school reopened February the next year and has stayed open ever since.Sargeant, Doris A. and others, The Toongabbie Story, Toongabbie, 1964 published by the Toongabbie Public School The first post office in the area was opened after many years of campaigning by local residents in 1887 in a private house on Old Windsor Road and this arrangement continued until the 1960s. The first post master was a Mr Birks wand he was paid 25 pounds a year to manage the office and bring the mail bag over from Seven Hills on horseback each day. By 1922 the number of residents and businesses had grown sufficiently to support a second office in a weatherboard cottage in Wentworth Avenue, known as Toongabbie West. A purpose built office was opened in the main shopping area in Portico Parade in 1960 becoming Toongabbie Post Office whilst the old Toongabbie Post Office was renamed Old Toon Toongabbie, The Third Settlement, John Goode, The third settlement bicentennial committee, 1988, Published in Australia, From the 1990s part of this area was unofficially known as the locality of Constitution Hill. The suburb of Constitution Hill was officially recognised in 2007. Geography The area is bounded on the north east by Toongabbie Creek, a tributary of the Parramatta River. Although Toongabbie is relatively densely settled, in recent years programs of bushland regeneration, pollution control and remedial works to local waterways have seen a surprising return by several rare wildlife species, and in the 1990s platypus were reported to have returned to sections of Toongabbie Creek.

It is north-west of the Sydney CBD in the local government area of the City of Parramatta (Previously part of the Hills Shire). It is considered to be part of the Hills District. The suburb extends from the south-east of Kissing Point Road and Vineyard Creek to the north-west bordering Pennant Hills Road and the North Rocks area. At the crossroads of the Parramatta CBD, Sydney's North West and the affluent Hills Shire, Oatlands has recently seen a transformation in its popularity as a prestige suburb with the construction of many modern multi-million dollar architecturally designed mansions. Evidence of this can be seen on streets such as Wyoming Ave, Ellis St, Lind Ave, York St, The Circle, Bettington Rd and Gardenvale Rd. History The name originally comes from Oatlands House, which was one of the earliest homes in the Parramatta district, being built in the 1830s by Percy Simpson. While it has been suggested that name reflects the first sowing of oats in Australia, this can't be confirmed. Instead, the name appears to be taken from Oatlands Park in England, which was close to the lands of Lord Dundas, for whom the neighbouring suburb was named. In 1840, the land was sold to James Bettington, who used it for sheep farming. Oatlands House is now used as function centre, with the surrounding land forming the Oatlands Golf Course, which was opened in 1931. Oatlands was defined as a new suburb in 1991.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollen, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia , Page 25 Prior to this, the area had been known as Dundas West. Dundas West Post Office opened on 3 July 1967. It was renamed Oatlands in 1993. Landmarks Oatlands Golf Course Oatlands is home to the historic Oatlands House, located within the grounds of the Oatlands Golf Club. Annual events include the New South Wales Women's Open, attracting professional golf athletes and media attention to the area. Winners of this event include Laura Davies, Lydia Ko in 2012 (while still an amateur, and thereby becoming the youngest to win any professional tournament), Swede Caroline Hedwall, in 2013 and Joanna Klatten of France in 2014. The Club is well renowned in the Sydney area, and is nominated as Australia's best par 70 course by former touring professional golfer and now media personality Brett Ogle. In addition, touring professional and multiple Australian Open and Australian PGA winner Peter Lonard is a product of the cadet program at the club. He also served his PGA traineeship there, and was the club professional for some years before rejoining the tour after recovering from Ross River Fever. Oatlands also includes the area known as Burnside, which was the site of Burnside Homes, the children's homes established by Sir James Burns in 1911. Although not used for children's homes any more, the area is still the site of the headquarters of Uniting Care Burnside, an agency of the Uniting Church in Australia. The name is also used by Burnside Public School, which was built on land belonging to the trust. The area contains mainly new housing developments such as Burnside Gardens Estate. Commercial area There is a small shopping area featuring a post office, supermarket, fruit shop, liquor store, chicken shop, hairdressers, butcher, real estate, doctors' surgery, chemist and newsagency.

Family Born at Zamora, Sancho was the eldest son of Ferdinand the Great and Sancha of Le√≥n.Reilly (1988), 3. He was married to Alberta, known by name only from her appearance as Sancho's queen in contemporary charters. Chronicler William of Poitiers related that competition for the hand of a daughter of William I, king of England led to strife between two sons of Ferdinand I, and some historians have thus speculated that Sancho's wife, with her non-Iberian name, may have been the daughter in question.Salazar y Acha, pp. 307‚Äì308.Reilly (1988), p. 47.Kearney and Medrano, 173-174. However, two later Norman chroniclers report that it was instead the betrothed of Alfonso VI, and not Sancho's wife Alberta, who was William's daughter. After Ferdinand the Great defeated and killed his wife's brother in battle, Ferdinand was crowned King of Le√≥n and Castile and called himself Imperator totius Hispaniae (\\"Emperor of all Spain\\"). When the kingdom was divided following Ferdinand's death in 1065, Sancho succeeded his father as King of Castile, while Sancho's younger brother Alfonso become King of Le√≥n and his youngest brother Garc√≠a became king of the reestablished Kingdom of Galicia (partitioned from Le√≥n). Each of the brothers was also assigned a sphere of influence among the Taifa states, with Sancho designated to receive the parias (tributary payments) from the Taifa of Zaragoza. Ferdinand also granted some holdings to his two daughters, giving Urraca control of the city of Zamora and Elvira the city of Toro, both enclaved within Alfonso's Kingdom of Le√≥n. Kingdoms in the Northern Iberian Peninsula around 1065: Taifas paying parias to these Kings: Reign In 1068, Sancho defeated his cousins Sancho IV of Navarre and Sancho of Aragon in the War of the Three Sanchos. This expanded his Kingdom of Castile with the reconquered land of Bureba, Alta Rioja, and √Ålava, which his father had given to Sancho IV's father, Garc√≠a, for his support in defeating Bermudo III of Le√≥n. The same year, Alfonso invaded the Taifa of Badajoz, a client state of brother Garcia's Kingdom of Galicia. Sancho, concerned that Alfonso had intentions on conquering his brothers, defeated Alfonso at the Battle of Llantada, reinstating the status quo. Sancho would develop his own appetite for his youngest brother's kingdom: teaming up with Alfonso in 1071, Sancho marched across Le√≥n to conquer Garc√≠a's northern lands at the time that Alfonso was in the southern part of the Galician realm issuing charters. Garc√≠a fled to exile in Taifa of Seville, while his older brothers partitioned the Kingdom of Galicia between them. Sancho soon turned on Alfonso. In 1072, with the aid of his alf√©rez El Cid, he defeated Alfonso at the Battle of Golpejera, who fled into exile in the Taifa of Toledo.Reilly (1995), 41. Sancho was crowned King of Le√≥n on 12 January 1072, simultaneously holding all three crowns that Ferdinand had distributed to his sons only six years earlier. Toro, the city of Sancho's sister Elvira, fell easily in 1072. But in a siege of sister Urraca's better-defended city of Zamora, Sancho was stalled. A Zamoran noble, Vellido Adolfo (also known as Bellido Dolfos), entered Sancho's camp pretending to be a deserter, seeking a private conference with Sancho to tell him the weaknesses in the Zamoran defence. Once before Sancho, Vellido assassinated him, using Sancho's own sword to impale him in the back. Vellido was chased back to Zamora by El Cid, but escaped into the town through a gateway since called Portillo del Traidor (\\"Gateway of the Traitor\\"). Sancho was succeeded in his kingdoms by the brother he had previously deposed, Alfonso.Gerli, 792. Garc√≠a, induced to return from exile, was imprisoned by Alfonso for life, leaving Alfonso in uncontested control of the reunited territories of their father, later taking on their father's title \\"Emperor of all Spain\\". Sancho was buried in San Salvador de O√±a. Notes Sources * Medieval Iberia: An Encyclopedia: An Encyclopedia, ed. E.

Mount Annan is located 60 kilometres south-west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of Camden Council, and is part of the Macarthur region. History The area now known as Mount Annan was originally home to the Dharawal people, based in the Illawarra region, although the Western Sydney-based Darug people and the Southern Highlands-based Gandangara people were also known to have inhabited the greater Camden area. Very early relations with British settlers were cordial but as farmers started clearing and fencing the land, affecting food resources in the area, clashes between the groups arose until 1816 when a number of indigenous people were massacred and the remainder retreated from direct conflict with the settlers. In 1805, wool pioneer John Macarthur was granted 5,000 acres (20 km¬≤) at Cowpastures (now Camden). After the land was cleared, it was used for farming for most of the next 200 years until Sydney's suburban sprawl reached the town of Camden and modern suburbs like Mount Annan were subdivided into housing blocks. Transport Mount Annan is off the Hume Highway. It includes the locality formerly known as Glenlee and the former Glenlee coal loader, which served the former Burragorang Valley coal mines.

Original development Located along the southwestern border of Rockingham and bordering the northern part of Fairview, Clayton Park is named after a family that owned property in the area extending up the southern slope of Geizer's Hill. The Clayton Park development began on July 12, 1962 when it received approval from the Municipality of the County of Halifax. Clayton Park, Rockingham and Fairview were all amalgamated into the City of Halifax in 1969. As regional water and sewer services extended post-1969, residential and commercial development followed until the main phase was completed by the late 1970s and early 1980s, with part of the development being altered slightly to the south side of Geizer's Hill in 1975. Clayton Park was created as an upper middle class community and its prime developer was the Shaw company, which placed certain architectural requirements for houses and apartments, among which was a high percentage of brick; Shaw being the largest brick manufacturer in Atlantic Canada. Primary house colors consisted of earthy tones of adobe reds, greens, browns and grays, which were popular for the mid- century post and beam house styles of the 1950s. Canadian architects Henry Fliess, Peter Dickinson, James A. Murray and Venchiarutti & Venchiarutti can be attributed to many of the Modern house designs. Modeled after the successful post-war \\"new-town\\" of Don Mills, Ontario in the decade before, Clayton Park consisted of 'roomy' quarter acre to half acre lots on winding streets, an elementary and middle school, churches, a library, two walkable shopping plazas, a recreational centre (now demolished), and an abundance of green space. Clayton Park West The completion of the Dunbrack Street/Northwest Arm Drive connectors with the Highway 102 during the 1980s, followed by an extension of Lacewood Drive to Highway 102 and adjacent Bayer's Lake Industrial Park during the 1990s saw the Shaw company create an extension to Clayton Park named Clayton Park West, envisioned to comprise a mixture of condominiums, single-family and multi-family residences and upscale apartments with complementary retail developments. The development was planned to fill in over a 20-year period, however a change to the Bayer's Lake Industrial Park (BLIP) from light industrial to businesses mostly consisting of warehouse- style retailers (it was renamed to Bayer's Lake Business Park), saw Clayton Park West expand with the highest rate of urban growth in Nova Scotia's history. The area was filled within four years and now extends Rockingham from the Bedford Basin to Highway 102. Clayton Park has one of the highest population densities in metro Halifax with a population of more than 23,000 as of 2006, and is one of the most ethnically diverse areas of Nova Scotia, with people of more than two dozen cultures being residents. The area is popular among new arrivals to the Halifax area due to the large number of high density apartment complexes and condominiums. Parks, trails, and recreation The Clayton Park area is home to an extensive network of parks, walking trails, and recreation facilities. ;Belchers Marsh Park Belchers Marsh Park consists of the large Belchers Marsh on the east side of Parkland Drive and the smaller Little Belchers Pond on the west side of Parkland Drive. A network of walking trails serves both the pond and marsh areas and connects the two areas together via a riverside trail which crosses Farnham Gate Road and Parkland Drive. The Belchers Marsh Park trail network consists of segments through forested areas, open areas along the shores of the marsh and in some sections follows the riverside, providing a variety of environments to enjoy. Benches are located around the Belchers Marsh segment of the trails, along with a lookoff platform for viewing the surrounding area. Connector pathways are provided to the surrounding residential streets with trailheads available at various locations along Parkland Drive (between Langbrae Drive and Heathside Crescent), as well as from Farnham Gate Road, Langbrae Drive, Red Fern Terrace and Tayberry Court. Wildlife is common in the area with deer frequently seen attempting to navigate across the very busy Parkland Drive. Ducks also come and go from Belchers Marsh at various times of the year. Small fish can easily be seen in the water along the shores of the marsh. ;Mainland North Linear Parkway A large segment of the Mainland North Linear Parkway, a wooded footpath, also runs through the Clayton Park West area. The parkway begins at the intersection of Parkland Drive and Kearney Lake Road and follows the wide sidewalk along the east side of Parkland Drive for approximately 500m before branching off into a proper trail near Castlepark Grove. The trail then continues in a straight line for approximately 4 km before terminating at Main Avenue in the community of Fairview. The Clayton Park West segment of the Mainland North Linear Parkway trail provides numerous connections along its route. The trail passes the Glenbourne Sports Field (located along the north end of Parkland Drive), the Park West School property (located on Langbrae Drive) and the Mainland Common (located on Lacewood Drive). The parkway uses marked crosswalks to cross several major roads including Farnham Gate Road, Langbrae Drive, Radcliffe Drive, and Lacewood Drive. Connector pathways and trails are provided to various nearby streets, including (from North to South) Gorsebud Close, Edward Laurie Drive/Beechwood Terrace, Heathside Crescent, Moss Court, Remmington Court, Scotch Pine Terrace, Montgomery Court, Glenbourne Court, Parkmount Close, Turnmill Drive, Thackery Close, Brackley Place, Stockleigh Place, Essex Lane, Warwick Lane, and Barkton Lane. ;Glenbourne Sports Field The Glenbourne Sports Field is located along the northern section of Parkland Drive, with the entrance located just north of Heathside Crescent.

She was essential in setting the standards for the teaching of speech and theater as a respected intellectual study and helped to begin the little theater movement. Life Anna Morgan was born on February 24, 1851, in Fleming, New York. She was the daughter of Mary Jane Thornton Morgan and Allen Denison Morgan, a gentleman farmer who served on the New York legislature in 1860-1861. She was the oldest child and had five siblings, two brothers and three sisters. They attended school in Auburn, New York until their father's death in 1876, when her mother moved the family to Chicago. In 1877, Morgan began her studies in elocution at the Hershey Music School. She died at the age of 85.Edward T. James, Janet Wilson James, eds., Notable American Women: A Biographical Dictionary (Harvard University Press, 1971), 578-9 Legacy and influence By the late 19th century, Morgan was famous for being a dramatic reader with a naturalistic style, a style that was unusual at the time. From 1880-1883, Morgan worked with the Redpath Lyceum Bureau and traveled with them to numerous large cities, such as NYC and Boston, where they would put on shows. In 1884, Morgan then joined the New Chicago Opera house Conservatory, where she began to focus on teaching drama. Although her productions were on a small scale, often being limited to the Conservatory stage, Morgan was known for her sophisticated choice of plays. In addition to the popular plays of the time, she put on adaptations of Shakespearean tragedies, classic Greek tragedies and contemporary poetry among others. In addition, she was the first to put on an American production of Shaw's Caesar and Cleopatra, with an all- female cast. The Anna Morgan Studios In 1898, Morgan resigned from the Conservatory and opened the Anna Morgan Studios in Chicago's Fine Arts Building. The curriculum of the studio included instruction in theatrical and political history, literature, playwriting, etiquette, acting and stagecraft. Morgan was trained by Steele MacKay in the Delsarte method, in which emotions are conveyed through body positions and gestures.

Data archaeology can also refer to recovering information from damaged electronic formats after natural disasters or human error. The term originally appeared in 1993 as part of the Global Oceanographic Data Archaeology and Rescue Project (GODAR). The original impetus for data archaeology came from the need to recover computerized records of climatic conditions stored on old computer tape, which can provide valuable evidence for testing theories of climate change. These approaches allowed the reconstruction of an image of the Arctic that had been captured by the Nimbus 2 satellite on September 23, 1966, in higher resolution than ever seen before from this type of data.Techno-archaeology rescues climate data from early satellites U.S. National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC), January 2010 Archived NASA also utilizes the services of data archaeologists to recover information stored on 1960s-era vintage computer tape, as exemplified by the Lunar Orbiter Image Recovery Project (LOIRP).LOIRP Overview NASA website November 14, 2008 Archived Recovery There is a distinction between data recovery and data intelligibility. One may be able to recover data but not understand it. For data archaeology to be effective, the data must be intelligible. Study on website October 23, 2011 =Disaster recovery= Data archaeologists can also use data recovery after natural disasters such as fires, floods, earthquakes, or even hurricanes. For example, in 1995 during Hurricane Marilyn the National Media Lab assisted the National Archives and Records Administration in recovering data at risk due to damaged equipment. The hardware was damaged from rain, salt water, and sand, yet it was possible to clean some of the disks and refit them with new cases thus saving the data within. =Recovery techniques= When deciding whether or not to try and recover data, the cost must be taken into account. If there is enough time and money, most data will be able to be recovered. In the case of magnetic media, which are the most common type used for data storage, there are various techniques that can be used to recover the data depending on the type of damage. Humidity can cause tapes to become unusable as they begin to deteriorate and become sticky. In this case, a heat treatment can be applied to fix this problem, by causing the oils and residues to either be reabsorbed into the tape or evaporate off the surface of the tape. However, this should only be done in order to provide access to the data so it can be extracted and copied to a medium that is more stable. Lubrication loss is another source of damage to tapes. This is most commonly caused by heavy use, but can also be a result of improper storage or natural evaporation. As a result of heavy use, some of the lubricant can remain on the read-write heads which then collect dust and particles. This can cause damage to the tape. Loss of lubrication can be addressed by re-lubricating the tapes. This should be done cautiously, as excessive re-lubrication can cause tape slippage, which in turn can lead to media being misread and the loss of data. Water exposure will damage tapes over time. This often occurs in a disaster situation. If the media is in salty or dirty water, it should be rinsed in fresh water. The process of cleaning, rinsing, and drying wet tapes should be done at room temperature in order to prevent heat damage. Older tapes should be recovered prior to newer tapes, as they are more susceptible to water damage. Prevention To prevent the need of data archaeology, creators and holders of digital documents should take care to employ digital preservation.

It is a natural extension of Pontryagin duality, between compact and discrete commutative topological groups, to groups that are compact but noncommutative. The theory is named for two men, the Soviet mathematician Mark Grigorievich Krein, and the Japanese Tadao Tannaka. In contrast to the case of commutative groups considered by Lev Pontryagin, the notion dual to a noncommutative compact group is not a group, but a category of representations Œ†(G) with some additional structure, formed by the finite-dimensional representations of G. Duality theorems of Tannaka and Krein describe the converse passage from the category Œ†(G) back to the group G, allowing one to recover the group from its category of representations. Moreover, they in effect completely characterize all categories that can arise from a group in this fashion. Alexander Grothendieck later showed that by a similar process, Tannaka duality can be extended to the case of algebraic groups: see Tannakian category. Meanwhile, the original theory of Tannaka and Krein continued to be developed and refined by mathematical physicists. A generalization of Tannaka‚ÄìKrein theory provides the natural framework for studying representations of quantum groups, and is currently being extended to quantum supergroups, quantum groupoids and their dual Hopf algebroids.  The idea of Tannaka‚ÄìKrein duality: category of representations of a group  In Pontryagin duality theory for locally compact commutative groups, the dual object to a group G is its character group \\\\hat{G}, which consists of its one-dimensional unitary representations. If we allow the group G to be noncommutative, the most direct analogue of the character group is the set of equivalence classes of irreducible unitary representations of G. The analogue of the product of characters is the tensor product of representations. However, irreducible representations of G in general fail to form a group, or even a monoid, because a tensor product of irreducible representations is not necessarily irreducible. It turns out that one needs to consider the set Œ†(G) of all finite-dimensional representations, and treat it as a monoidal category, where the product is the usual tensor product of representations, and the dual object is given by the operation of the contragredient representation. A representation of the category Œ†(G) is a monoidal natural transformation from the identity functor id_{\\\\Pi(G)}\\\\\\\\! to itself. In other words, it is a non-zero function œÜ that associates with any T \\\\in Ob\\\\,\\\\Pi(G) an endomorphism of the space of T and satisfies the conditions of compatibility with tensor products, \\\\phi(T\\\\otimes U)=\\\\phi(T)\\\\otimes\\\\phi(U), and with arbitrary intertwining operators f: T ‚Üí U, namely, f\\\\circ \\\\phi(T) = \\\\phi(U) \\\\circ f. The collection Œì(Œ†(G)) of all representations of the category Œ†(G) can be endowed with multiplication œÜœà(T) = œÜ(T) œà(T) and topology, in which convergence is defined pointwise, i.e. a sequence \\\\\\\\{\\\\phi_a\\\\\\\\} converges to some \\\\phi if and only if \\\\\\\\{\\\\phi_a(T)\\\\\\\\} converges to \\\\phi(T) for all T \\\\in Ob\\\\,\\\\Pi(G). It can be shown that the set Œì(Œ†(G)) thus becomes a compact (topological) group.  Theorems of Tannaka and Krein  Tannaka's theorem provides a way to reconstruct the compact group G from its category of representations Œ†(G). Let G be a compact group and let F: Œ†(G) ‚Üí VectC be the forgetful functor from finite-dimensional complex representations of G to complex finite-dimensional vector spaces. One puts a topology on the natural transformations œÑ: F ‚Üí F by setting it to be the coarsest topology possible such that each of the projections End(F) ‚Üí End(V) given by \\\\tau \\\\mapsto \\\\tau_V (taking a natural transformation \\\\tau to its component \\\\tau_V at V \\\\in \\\\Pi(G)) is a continuous function. We say that a natural transformation is tensor- preserving if it is the identity map on the trivial representation of G, and if it preserves tensor products in the sense that \\\\tau_{V \\\\otimes W} = \\\\tau_V \\\\otimes \\\\tau_W. We also say that œÑ is self-conjugate if \\\\overline{\\\\tau} = \\\\tau where the bar denotes complex conjugation. Then the set \\\\mathcal{T}(G) of all tensor-preserving, self-conjugate natural transformations of F is a closed subset of End(F), which is in fact a (compact) group whenever G is a (compact) group. Every element x of G gives rise to a tensor-preserving self-conjugate natural transformation via multiplication by x on each representation, and hence one has a map G \\\\to \\\\mathcal{T}(G). Tannaka's theorem then says that this map is an isomorphism. Krein's theorem answers the following question: which categories can arise as a dual object to a compact group? Let Œ† be a category of finite-dimensional vector spaces, endowed with operations of tensor product and involution. The following conditions are necessary and sufficient in order for Œ† to be a dual object to a compact group G. : 1. There exists an object I with the property that I\\\\otimes A \\\\approx A for all objects A of Œ† (which will necessarily be unique up to isomorphism). : 2. Every object A of Œ† can be decomposed into a sum of minimal objects. : 3. If A and B are two minimal objects then the space of homomorphisms HomŒ†(A, B) is either one- dimensional (when they are isomorphic) or is equal to zero. If all these conditions are satisfied then the category Œ† = Œ†(G), where G is the group of the representations of Œ†.  Generalization  Interest in Tannaka‚ÄìKrein duality theory was reawakened in the 1980s with the discovery of quantum groups in the work of Drinfeld and Jimbo. One of the main approaches to the study of a quantum group proceeds through its finite-dimensional representations, which form a category akin to the symmetric monoidal categories Œ†(G), but of more general type, braided monoidal category. It turned out that a good duality theory of Tannaka‚ÄìKrein type also exists in this case and plays an important role in the theory of quantum groups by providing a natural setting in which both the quantum groups and their representations can be studied. Shortly afterwards different examples of braided monoidal categories were found in rational conformal field theory. Tannaka‚ÄìKrein philosophy suggests that braided monoidal categories arising from conformal field theory can also be obtained from quantum groups, and in a series of papers, Kazhdan and Lusztig proved that it was indeed so. On the other hand, braided monoidal categories arising from certain quantum groups were applied by Reshetikhin and Turaev to construction of new invariants of knots. Doplicher‚ÄìRoberts theorem The Doplicher‚ÄìRoberts theorem (due to Sergio Doplicher and John E. Roberts) characterises Rep(G) in terms of category theory, as a type of subcategory of the category of Hilbert spaces. Such subcategories of compact group unitary representations on Hilbert spaces are: # a strict symmetric monoidal C*-category with conjugates # a subcategory having subobjects and direct sums, such that the C*-algebra of endomorphisms of the monoidal unit contains only scalars.

In the types in which the cutter portion is an indexable part clamped by a screw, the cutters are called inserts (because they are inserted into the tool body). Tipped tools allow each part of the tool, the shank and the cutter(s), to be made of the material with the best properties for its job. Common materials for the cutters (brazed tips or clamped inserts) include cemented carbide, polycrystalline diamond, and cubic boron nitride. Tools that are commonly tipped include milling cutters (such as end mills, face mills, and fly cutters), tool bits, router bits, and saw blades (especially the metal-cutting ones). Advantages and disadvantages The advantage of tipped tools is only a small insert of the cutting material is needed to provide the cutting ability. The small size makes manufacturing of the insert easier than making a solid tool of the same material. This also reduces cost because the tool holder can be made of a less-expensive and tougher material. In some situations a tipped tool is better than its solid counterpart because it combines the toughness of the tool holder with the hardness of the insert. In other situations this is less than optimal, because the joint between the tool holder and the insert reduces rigidity. However, these tools may still be used because the overall cost savings is still greater. In industry today, insert tools are perhaps slightly more common than solid tools, but solid tools are still used in many applications. Entire catalogs of solid‚Äìhigh-speed steel (HSS) and solid-carbide end mills, for example, play prominent parts in some areas of milling practice, including diesinking, moldmaking, and aerospace job or batch production. Most machine shops with lathes have many solid-HSS and solid-carbide tool bits as well as many insert-tipped tool bits, and most commercial operations that involve routers (such as cabinetry and furniture shops) use plenty of solid-HSS and solid-carbide router bits as well as some tipped bits. Indexable inserts Inserts are removable cutting tips, which means they are not brazed or welded to the tool body. They are usually indexable, meaning that they can be exchanged, and often also rotated or flipped, without disturbing the overall geometry of the tool (effective diameter, tool length offset, etc.). This saves time in manufacturing by allowing fresh cutting edges to be presented periodically without the need for tool grinding, setup changes, or entering of new values into a CNC program. =Wiper insert= A wiper insert is an insert used in a milling machine or a lathe. It is designed for finished cutting, to give a smooth surface on the surface being cut. It uses special geometry to give a good finish on the workpiece at a higher-than-normal feedrate. Wiper inserts generally have a larger area in contact with the workpiece, so they exert higher force on the workpiece. This makes them unsuitable for fragile workpieces. =ISO insert coding= ISO1832 insert designation system. Inserts used for turning and milling are often numbered according to ISO standard 1832. This standard aims to make the naming, specifying and ordering of inserts a simple, consistent and traceable process. This standard takes into account both metric and imperial systems of units, although certain elements differ for each unit system. The code consists of up to 13 symbols with the first 12 of them being compulsory for inserts composed of cubic boron or poly-crystalline diamond and the first 7 being compulsory for all other types of composition.ISO1832:2004, 4th Edition See also * Diamond tools * Diamond blade References Category:Cutting tools Category:Metalworking cutting tools Category:Woodworking ","title":"Tipped tool"},{"id":"2588634","text":"Robert T.

In NWA Mid- America and its descendant, the Continental Wrestling Association Russell's primary announcing partner was Dave Brown. He is included in the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA)'s Hall of Fame and Hall of Heroes. In addition, he is in the United States Wrestling Association (USWA)'s Memphis Wrestling Hall of Fame and Wrestling Observer Newsletter's Hall of Fame. Professional wrestling career =Memphis (1959‚Äì1988)= Russell's career began at a television station in Jackson, Tennessee. He was asked to work as an announcer for a match promoted by Nick Gulas and Roy Welch. He had previous experience calling other sports such as basketball, boxing, football, and baseball. He worked as an announcer in Memphis beginning in 1959. He called matches primarily for NWA Mid-America and its descendant promotion, the Continental Wrestling Association. His long-term announcing partner was Dave Brown; their partnership began in 1967. They gave a young Jerry Lawler some of his first exposure by showing his wrestling cartoons on their Saturday morning broadcast. Russell also announced Monday night matches at the Mid-South Coliseum. In addition, he live-announced taped house show matches from Tupelo, Mississippi during the late 1970s. He called the \\"Tupelo Concession Stand Brawl\\" between The Blonde Bombers (Wayne Farris and Larry Latham) and Jerry Lawler and Bill Dundee. He also called the 1981 \\"Empty Arena match\\" between Lawler and Terry Funk. An episode from 1981 found Russell being physically attacked by the Dream Machine and footage of the angle was included in the 2011 documentary Memphis Heat. He was also involved in angles where Jimmy Hart dumped flour on his head and was physically attacked by The Road Warriors. He also called the match where Jerry Lawler won the AWA World Heavyweight Championship from Curt Hennig. =Later career (1989‚Äì1992)= Russell made his debut in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) on the March 11, 1989 edition of NWA World Wide Wrestling alongside Jim Ross. It was his first national broadcast. In WCW, he also worked with announcers Bob Caudle and Gordon Solie. He left WCW in 1993, but still occasionally called matches for the company. He returned to Memphis Wrestling, paired once again with Brown and/or Corey Maclin. During the 1990s, he was also the director of programming for RKO General, the owner of WHBQ-TV. He also worked as an announcer for Smoky Mountain Wrestling toward the end of their existence. He went into semi- retirement in 1997. =Legacy and style= He has been called \\"one of the greatest wrestling announcers of all time\\" by SLAM Wrestling and \\"integral\\" to Memphis Wrestling.

Mike Mooneyham, a professional wrestling journalist, has called him \\"the voice of Memphis wrestling\\". His style and delivery has been described as earnest and smooth. He was known for his euphemisms such as \\"Sam Hill\\" and \\"Don't start with the smart stuff.\\" Other media Russell's work in Memphis Wrestling is shown in the 1989 documentary, I'm from Hollywood. He is also interviewed in regards to the film's primary subject, Andy Kaufman. Russell appears in the 1999 Kaufman biographical film Man on the Moon as the Memphis ring announcer.

Located in Central Austin, Hyde Park is defined by 38th Street to the south, 45th Street to the north, Duval Street to the east, and Guadalupe Street to the west. It is situated just north of the University of Texas and borders the neighborhoods of Hancock and North Loop. Hyde Park traces its origins back to 1891 and is considered to be Austin's first suburb. The neighborhood was originally developed by Monroe Martin Shipe in 1891 as a \\"White Only\\" streetcar suburb with a large artificial lake, but it has since become one of the most densely populated areas in the city's urban core.R.U. Steinberg and John Slate, East Austin: A Planned Community. Austin Chronicle. 12/9/1988‚àöEliot Tretter, Austin Restricted: Progressivism, Zoning, Private Racial Covenants, and the Making of a Segregated City. Draft Report for Institute for Urban Policy Research and Analysis, University of Texas at Austin, 2012. Part of the neighborhood was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a Historic District in 1990. History Elisabet Ney Museum Located approximately twenty blocks from Austin's original town site, the area now known as Hyde Park was largely rural in character for much of the 19th century. The State Fair of Texas was held in the eastern sections of Hyde Park from 1875 until it was moved to Dallas in 1884. A portion of the State Fair's horseracing track is still reflected in the curved segment of 39th Street between Avenue F and Duval Street. Established in 1891 by the Missouri, Kansas and Texas Land and Town Company, Hyde Park was marketed under the direction of Monroe Martin Shipe as a majority white, affluent suburb featuring large, majestic residences, separate from the racially integrated neighborhoods of the city. Ads touted Hyde Park as ‚Äúfree from nuisances and an objectionable class of people, proper restrictions being taken to guard against undesirable occupants.‚Äù Critical to the suburb's success was the establishment of an electric streetcar system. After the City Council awarded Shipe a franchise in 1890, his Austin Rapid Transit Railway Company built its first line on Congress Avenue, west on Sixth Street, and north on Rio Grande Street and Old Georgetown Road (now Guadalupe Street) to Hyde Park. Hyde Park was initially marketed to Austin's elite in the 1890s, and Shipe achieved moderate success. The first houses built in the neighborhood were stylistic examples of late 19th-century domestic architecture. Many of them, such as the Oliphant-Walker House, were built in the Queen Anne style by locally prominent citizens. Noted sculptress Elisabet Ney was among the first to buy property in the area, which was heavily promoted as confirmation that Hyde Park was attractive to Austin's most talented and prestigious citizens. Ney built a small castle-style studio, named Formosa, in northwest Hyde Park that is now home to the Elisabet Ney Museum. By the late 1890s and early 1900s, however, the tone of Hyde Park's advertisements began to change. No longer was it promoted as an affluent residential area; instead, the suburb was described as an ideal place for the \\"working man or woman\\" to invest his or her earnings by purchasing a lot and building a residence. The key phrase in these promotions became affordability. Hyde Park's architectural character shifted to smaller, more modest frame houses and bungalows. While steady construction of houses characterized the area through the early 1900s, Hyde Park's greatest building boom occurred between 1924 and 1935. Shipe Park was dedicated in 1928. Analysis of styles and dates of construction of domestic structures elucidates historic growth patterns within Hyde Park. The oldest houses are located near the State Hospital or along the former streetcar route on 40th Street. Later, as promotional emphasis shifted to a different socioeconomic group, more modest dwellings were constructed in areas somewhat removed from the streetcar line. Today, Hyde Park consists of mostly renovated bungalow-style homes, and modern duplex-style residences, many with bright colors and unorthodox decorations, due in part to the residents preserving the city‚Äôs informal ‚ÄúKeep Austin Weird‚Äù slogan. All street signs in Hyde Park are dedicated to its historical identity. Many ‚ÄùAustinites‚Äù consider Hyde Park Austin, TX‚Äôs most locally cultured neighborhood. Historic districts The Hyde Park neighborhood contains two historic districts and several other individual historic buildings listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Hyde Park Historic District is roughly defined by West 40th Street to the south, West 45th Street to the north, Duval Street to the east, and Avenue A to the west. The district includes Victorian architecture, Tudor Revival architecture, and bungalows. The Shadow Lawn Historic District in southeast Hyde Park is roughly bounded by 38th Street, 39th Street, Avenue G, and Duval Street. The district includes several homes of historic interest from the early twentieth century. =Historic buildings in Hyde Park= * Blue Bonnet Court * Elisabet Ney Museum * Col. Monroe M.

Covert House * Page-Gilbert House * Smith-Marcuse-Lowry House * Oliphant-Walker House * Peter and Clotilde Shipe Mansbendel House Real Estate and Housing Market Trends Shipe Park Residential properties are the most prominent property type in Hyde Park, with single-family dwellings comprising about 95 percent of the neighborhood's built environment. Most lots within the neighborhood were improved between the late 1890s and 1935. Houses built during that period reflect the architectural tastes, trends and patterns that prevailed in Austin at the time. Bungalows are the most common house type, followed by examples of the stylistic influences of the Queen Anne and Tudor Revival styles. As Austin has grown, Hyde Park has once again undergone a boom of sorts. In 2001 to 2007, the median home price rose by nearly $70,000 to $320,000. Despite the housing market crash in 2008-2009, homes have regained their values and as of July 2013 the median home price was $350,000 with some properties selling for over $1.5 million.\\"\\"Hyde Park Housing Market Report The Shipe Park is located in Hyde Park.

Commonly known as greenbottle blue tarantulas due to their metallic blue legs and blue-green carapace, they are very active and fast-growing tarantulas that are particularly attractive to hobbyists. They are native to the Paraguan√° Peninsula, near Punto Fijo. They live in webbed burrows under bushes and tree roots in desert areas of northern Venezuela. The entrance is often extended with webbing, sometimes resembling a funnel shape. These webs may protect the entrance from the harsh desert climate and act as a trap for insects. Taxonomy The species was first described by Embrik Strand in 1907 under the name Eurypelma cyaneopubescens, and was moved to the newly created genus Delopelma by Alexander Petrunkevitch in 1939. Delopelma and Eurypelma are now considered to be a synonyms of Aphonopelma and Avicularia, respectively. In 1997, Gunter Schmidt considered the species sufficiently distinct to warrant the new genus Chromatopelma, a name referring to its striking blue color. He differentiated Chromatopelma from Aphonopelma based on the scopulae of the tarsus on the third leg, bristles that divide the metatarsus from the tarsus on the fourth leg, the very large posterior median eyes, and the single fused spermatheca of females.

It is administered as part of the village of Kitadait≈ç, Shimajiri District, Okinawa. The island is entirely cultivated for agriculture, although it lacks freshwater sources. The island has no beaches or harbor but has an airport (Kitadaito Airport) ( airport code \\"KTD\\") for local flights. Geography Kitadait≈çjima is a relatively isolated coralline island, located approximately north of Minamidait≈çjima, the largest island of the archipelago, and from Naha, Okinawa. As with the other islands in the archipelago, Kitadait≈çjima is an uplifted coral atoll with a steep coastal cliff of limestone (the former fringing coral reef of the island), and a depressed center (the former lagoon of the island). The island is roughly oval in shape, with a circumference of about , length of and an area of . The highest point is above sea level. The 660 (as of June 1, 2013) inhabitants live in a village in the center of the island. Kitadait≈çjima has a humid subtropical climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Cfa) with very warm summers and mild winters. Precipitation is significant throughout the year; the wettest month is June and the driest month is February. The island is subject to frequent typhoons. File:Kitadaitou.jpgA village in the interior of the island. File:Kitadaitou kitakaigan.jpgA natural area History It is uncertain when Minamidait≈çjima was discovered. It is the most likely that their first sighting was by the Spanish navigator Bernardo de la Torre in 1543, in between 25 September and 2 October, during his abortive attempt to reach New Spain from the Philippines with the San Juan de Letran. It was then charted, together with Kitadait≈çjima, as Las Dos Hermanas (The Two Sisters). There is little doubt that Minamidait≈çjima and Kitadait≈çjima were again sighted by the Spanish on 28 July 1587, by Pedro de Unamuno who named them Islas sin Probecho (Useless Islands). However, on 2 July 1820, the Russian vessel Borodino surveyed the two Dait≈ç islands and named the south as \\"South Borodino Island\\". The island remained uninhabited until claimed by the Empire of Japan in 1885. In 1900, a team of pioneers from Hachij≈çjima, an island located south of Tokyo led by Tamaoki Han'emon (1838 - 1910), who had pioneered settlement on Minamidait≈çjima, became the first human inhabitants of the island, and started the cultivation of sugar cane from 1903. During this period until World War II, Kitadait≈çjima was owned in its entirety by Dai Nippon Sugar (now Dai Nippon Meiji Sugar), which also operated mines for the extraction of guano for use in fertilizer. Many of the inhabitants were seasonal workers from Okinawa and Taiwan. After World War II, the island was occupied by the United States. The use of increased mechanization increased phosphate yields marginally until the deposits were exhausted by the mid-1950s. The island was returned to Japan in 1972.

Urban shamanism is practiced primarily by people who do not originate in a traditional indigenous society and who create unique methods that do not follow or claim authenticity in any prior tradition. Urban shamanism traces its beginnings to efforts by Westerners to come to terms with psychoactive plant experiences using their own modern frames of cultural reference influenced by, but outside of, the indigenous rites in which plant medicine is traditionally based. The term urban shamanism emphasizes maintaining respect for indigenous traditions by recognizing indigenous societies' thorough embeddedness in immediate contact with the natural world. The related terms digital shamanism and digital psychedelia are schools of thought born out of the convergence of technological changes, art movements, and Eastern philosophies during the late 20th century. They parallel and are often associated with technopaganism. In practice, the digital psychedelic process is the fusion of the biological and technological to seek self-knowledge.

Directed and written by Richard Benner, the film stars Craig Russell as Robin Turner, a female impersonator, and Hollis McLaren as Liza Conners, Turner's schizophrenic roommate. The film initially takes place in Toronto, Canada. The film is based on \\"Making It\\", a short story by writer Margaret Gibson from her 1976 collection The Butterfly Ward; Russell and Gibson were roommates in real life. Outrageous! was one of the first gay-themed films ever to receive widespread theatrical release in North America.Craig Russell on glbtq.com. The film inspired the sequel Too Outrageous! released in 1987. A stage musical adaptation of the film was produced by Canadian Stage in 2000.\\"New Musical, Outrageous, Has World Premiere in Toronto Sept. 19-Oct. 21\\" . Playbill, September 19, 2000. Plot Robin Turner is an inept hairdresser. He does hair and makeup for the local drag shows but longs to get up on stage himself. His best friend, Liza, is schizophrenic. She had been institutionalized but decided to leave the facility. Liza has a delusional episode in which she believes that \\"The Bonecrusher\\" from \\"The Other Place\\" is lying on top of her. Robin helps her push the Bonecrusher off and Liza tells him about the Other Place and her friend from there, Zara. Zara protects her from the Bonecrusher, who tells Liza that she is \\"the one born dead\\" and wants to take her to live in the Other Place forever. A social worker visits Liza and they review Liza's lengthy list of medications. The social worker stresses that it would be very dangerous for Liza to become pregnant. When Robin comes home from work, Liza is excited that she was able to function with the social worker. Robin, however, is depressed. A client had urged him to be adventurous with her hairstyle but then reacted badly when Robin styled it like Elizabeth Taylor in Cleopatra. Robin and Liza meet Robin's friend Perry and Liza's friend from the institution, Martin. Martin seems to suffer from some form of paranoid delusions, believing that his eyes are turning Chinese and ranting about Mao Zedong. Perry and Robin discuss their costumes for an upcoming Halloween party. Perry decides to go as Karen Black as the flight attendant from Airport 1975. Liza suggests that Robin go as Tallulah Bankhead and agrees to make his dress. Robin is a smash at the Halloween party, winning first prize in the costume contest and being offered the chance to perform regularly. His boss at the hair salon, a closet case who thinks that women won't want to have their hair done by \\"fags\\", is at first reluctant to give Robin the time off to shop for fabric for new dresses but finally relents. Robin debuts at the club as Bette Davis, doing a routine mocking Joan Crawford's performances in Mildred Pierce, Autumn Leaves and What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? and singing live rather than lip synching. Meanwhile, Liza is continuing therapy. She keeps a journal of her thoughts and dreams and reads them for her psychiatrist, who suggests that she return to the institution. She adamantly refuses. Her doctor cautions her again about becoming pregnant. Liza's lesbian editor friend Anne reads through Liza's journal and tells her that she might be able to sell some of her stories. Robin continues to make appearances at the club, including a turn as Barbra Streisand, but loses his job at the salon after a client finds out about it and complains to his boss. Liza, who is somewhat sexually promiscuous, has become pregnant. With bills piling up, Robin leaves Canada for New York City seeking success as a female impersonator. On his way to his first gig at the \\"Jackrabbit Club\\", he meets Bob, a cab driver who was formerly a talent agent and agrees to allow Bob to represent him. Robin performs Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend while rapidly changing drag personas, starting off as Carol Channing and transforming into Marlene Dietrich, Ethel Merman, Ella Fitzgerald, Pearl Bailey and Bette Midler before concluding as Carol again. For an encore he performs Give My Regards to Broadway as Judy Garland. Robin is a triumph and books a regular slot at the club. Liza enters the hospital to give birth. Tragically, the baby is stillborn. She goes into a deep depression, calling Robin to tell him about the stillbirth and that she believes now that she is \\"the one born dead.\\" Robin has Bob drive him to Canada to retrieve Liza. He moves her into his New York apartment and instructs Bob to get her dressed and to his show at the Jackrabbit. That night Robin performs as Peggy Lee. Liza, initially completely withdrawn, slowly begins to respond to her surroundings. Following the number, still depressed, Liza tells Robin that the Bonecrusher's not there but that she's of his domain, that she's dead. Robin tells her that she's not dead, but crazy, and so is he, and that they need to embrace it. To him, she is as normal as anyone else in New York. At first reluctant, she begins to smile and agree. He then pulls her out to the floor to dance with the rest of the performers and patrons.

(U.K.), R.S.C. 1985, App. II, No. 11, s. 93. (formerly the British North America Act, 1867). The issue was whether the Common Schools Act,Common Schools Act, S.N.B. 1871, c. 21. enacted by the Province of New Brunswick in 1871, infringed the guarantee of denominational schools set out in section 93(1). The court case was part of the larger debate on public funding and the role of the churches in public affairs in New Brunswick. The litigation was triggered by the Legislature of New Brunswick passing the Common Schools Act, which explicitly provided that public schools were to be non-sectarian, open to all, and under the supervision of a provincial Board of Education. Some schools under the previous system had been under the effective control of particular religious denominations, in areas where the adherents of those denominations were in the majority. Opposition to the new school system came from the Roman Catholic Church and the Anglican Church. The case was ultimately decided by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Britain, at that time the court of last resort for Canada within the British Empire. The Judicial Committee held that the parish schools established under the previous law, the Parish Schools Act of 1858,Parish Schools Act, S.N.B. 1858 (21 Vict.), c. 9. were not denominational schools established by law, and were not within the protection of section 93(1). The new Common Schools Act therefore did not infringe any legal \\"right or privilege\\" possessed by anyone in New Brunswick at the time of Confederation and was constitutional. Maher v Town Council of Portland was the first case decided by the Judicial Committee under section 93 of the Constitution Act, 1867.  Development of the New Brunswick School System  Charles Fisher, whose government introduced the Parish Schools Act. He was later appointed to the Supreme Court of New Brunswick and sat on the challenge to the Common Schools Act. His concurring opinion was upheld by the Judicial Committee. Prior to Confederation, the school system in New Brunswick was governed by the Parish Schools Act of 1858,Parish Schools Act, S.N.B. 1858 (21 Vict.), c. 9. enacted by the government led by Premier Charles Fisher. That Act provided for schools to be set up on a voluntary basis in parishes, supported by voluntary financial contributions and tuition fees. Alternatively, the rate-payers in a parish could vote to impose local taxes in support of the parish school, in which case attendance at the school was free to all students. (\\"Parish\\" was the term used for one of the forms of local government at the time, rather than as a term of church organization.) As well, the Legislature appropriated a lump sum each year to support the parish schools. There was a Board of Education for the entire colony, composed of the colonial Cabinet, with overall supervision of the schools, but in practice the schools were under local control, often under the auspices of different churches and religious bodies. The Parish Schools Act provided that the school libraries were not to contain any books hostile to the Christian religion, nor works of controversial theology. Teachers were to impress on the pupils \\"the principles of christianity, morality, and justice\\" as well as other moral and civil virtues, but in no case was a pupil to be required to read or study any religious book or participate in any act of devotion. Bible readings were permitted, on direction of the Board of Education, but only to pupils whose parents did not object.Parish Schools Act, S.N.B. 1858 (21 Vict.), c. 9, s. 8, para. 5. The provincial Legislature enacted the Common Schools Act in 1871. George King, the provincial Attorney General, introduced the Bill in the Assembly and was responsible for its passage. The Assembly passed the Bill after strenuous political debate, including the adoption of a House amendment requiring that the schools be non-sectarian. The new Act carried forward much of the structure of the Parish Schools Act, but with some significant differences. The supervisory control of the provincial Board of Education was strengthened. School taxation was now made compulsory, not voluntary. Provincial funding was only to be provided to schools established under the Act.Common Schools Act, S.N.B. 1871, c. 21, s. 58(12) The schools were to be non-sectarian,Common Schools Act, S.N.B. 1871, c. 21, s. 60 and the Common Schools Act did not contain any provision authorising Bible readings.  Decision of the New Brunswick Supreme Court  = Summary = Attorney General George Edwin King, who introduced the Common Schools Act in the New Brunswick Legislature, and defended it in the courts. There were two separate legal challenges to the new school system, brought in the New Brunswick Supreme Court: Ex parte MaherEx parte Maher, Supreme Court of New Brunswick, June 17, 1873 (unreported); reproduced in Maher v Town Council of Portland, [1874 UKPC 83], Record of Proceedings, p. 7. and Ex parte Renaud.Ex parte Renaud (1873), 1 N.B.R. 273 (N.B. S.C.). The Maher case was brought by Henry Maher, a Roman Catholic rate- payer in the town of Portland (now part of the City of Saint John), who challenged the school tax assessed by the town under the Common Schools Act. The Renaud case was brought by an individual named Renaud, and challenged a school tax assessed by the Parish of Richibucto, in the County of Kent.Ex parte Renaud, p. 273. In both cases, the plaintiffs applied for certiorari to quash the school taxes, on the basis that the Common Schools Act infringed the right of Roman Catholics to have denominational schools, under s. 93 of the Constitution Act, 1867. The full Supreme Court of New Brunswick, consisting of five judges, heard both applications. The Court dismissed the constitutional challenges and upheld the constitutionality of the Common Schools Act. The reasons given by the Court in the two cases are identical. The majority decision was written in both cases by Chief Justice Ritchie (Justices Allen and Weldon concurring). Justice Fisher (having left politics and been appointed to the Court) and Justice Wetmore each wrote separate concurring decisions. = Majority Reasons of Chief Justice Ritchie = Chief Justice Ritchie began by holding that the courts had the power to review the constitutionality of provincial statutes under the Constitution Act, 1867. He stated that this position had long been established in the New Brunswick courts, but he thought it necessary to state it expressly, since there had been some recent decisions in Quebec which questioned that principle. Chief Justice Ritchie referred to the Colonial Laws Validity Act,Colonial Laws Validity Act, 28 & 29 Vict. (1865), c. 63, s. 2. as well as the advisory decision of the judges of England with respect to the Clergy Reserves Act of the Province of Canada, as establishing that a colonial law had to comply with the terms of an Imperial statute which applied to the colony. On that basis, the laws of New Brunswick had to comply with the terms of the Constitution Act, 1867.Ex parte Maher, Record of Proceedings in Maher v Town Council of Portland, pp. 7-9.

Turning to the constitutional issue, Chief Justice Ritchie stated that to decide if the rights of the Roman Catholic minority were infringed by the Common Schools Act, it was necessary to determine what rights they had under the law immediately before Confederation, since s. 93 of the Constitution Act, 1867 protected whatever rights they possessed at that time. He noted that there clearly were some denominational schools, operated by churches and teaching the specific tenets of those churches beliefs. He referred to specific schools run by the Methodist, Anglican, Presbyterian and Roman Catholic churches. However, those schools were not affected by the Common Schools Act and therefore did not have to be considered in his decision. Rather, it was the schools established under the Parish Schools Act which had to be considered since they were established under the law immediately in force prior to Confederation, and were affected by the changes made by the Common Schools Act.Ex parte Maher, Record of Proceedings, Maher v Town Council of Portland, pp. 10-11. Chief Justice Ritchie noted that the local school trustees were elected by the voters generally, and were under the supervision of the provincial Board of Education and the provincial Superintendent. Although the Parish Schools Act did provide that teachers were to inculcate the principles of Christianity, honesty and morality,Parish Schools Act, s. 8, para. 5. the Act also provided that in doing so, teachers were not to require a student to read any religious book or join in any act of devotion to which the student's parents objected.Parish Schools Act, s. 8, para. 4. Bible readings were permitted where authorised by local regulation, including the option of using the Douay version for Roman Catholic students, but without any additional note or comment by the teacher. By another section of the Parish Schools Act, contentious books relating to theology were not permitted in the school libraries. One of the arguments advanced by the applicants was that even though the Act did not specifically confer control over the schools on any denomination, in practice the schools were under denominational control in those areas where a particular religious group formed the majority and thus could elect local trustees of their religious group. Those trustees in turn would allow teaching of their denomination's particular principles. The applicants argued that the schools were in fact denominational in nature, and therefore that right had to be protected. Chief Justice Ritchie rejected that argument, noting that any religious teachings were done without the authority of the Parish Schools Act, and may or may not have been with the sanction of the provincial Board of Education. That practice could not interfere with the right of all inhabitants under the Act to have a school free and independent of denominational connection.Ex parte Maher, Record of Proceedings in Maher v Town Council of Portland, p. 15. Chief Justice Ritchie concluded that the Parish Schools Act created a general system of education for the benefit of all inhabitants of the Province, without reference to class or creed. The schools were public schools, not under the control of any denomination. No denomination had any particular rights in the schools and did not have the right to have their own religious doctrines taught in the schools. Rather, there was a general recognition of Christian precepts as part of the education of the students, without favouring any denomination in particular.Ex parte Maher, Record of Proceedings in Maher v Town Council of Portland, p. 16. = Concurring Reasons of Justice Fisher = Justice Fisher concurred in the majority's conclusion, but gave his own reasons. Prior to his appointment to the court, he had been a Father of Confederation and had participated in both the Quebec Conference and the London Conference which had produced the terms of Confederation and the text of the Constitution Act, 1867. He agreed with the majority that the Common Schools Act did not infringe s. 93 of the Constitution Act, 1867 and was constitutional. He began by noting that the purpose of s. 93 was to resolve a question that had caused serious difficulties in the former Province of Canada, prior to Confederation. Paragraphs 93(2) and (3) only applied to the provinces of Quebec and Ontario. The constitutionality of the Common Schools Act depended entirely on paragraph 93(1). It was not simply a right of privilege of the minority faith which triggers paragraph 93(1). It had to be a right or privilege, of the members of the minority faith, with respect to denominational schools, which they had at law at the time of Union, and which was prejudicially affected by a subsequent government action.Ex parte Maher, Record of Proceedings in Maher v Town Council of Portland, p. 23. The first question was therefore to define a \\"denominational school\\". Justice Fisher stated that a denominational school is a school under the exclusive government of some one denomination of Christians, and where the tenets of that denomination are taught. If that condition were met, it would be necessary to examine the laws in force at the time of union, to determine if any such school existed at law, and if the right of the minority faith has been prejudicially affected. Justice Fisher then reviewed the provisions of the Parish Schools Act. In his view, the schools established under the act were under the control of the Board of Education, a purely political body, and under the supervision of the Superintendent, a political officer. Like Chief Justice Ritchie, he referred to the provision barring books of controversial theology from the school libraries. Justice Fisher interpreted that provision as barring books of denominational teaching. He concluded that the schools were common to everyone, irrespective of religious opinions. No class or creed had any special right in the governance of the schools generally, or in any particular parish school.Ex parte Maher, Record of Proceedings in Maher v Town Council of Portland, pp. 24-25. As well, the Act provided that no student was to read any religious book or participate in any religious act of devotion, unless the student's parents wished it. Justice Fisher held that this provision was a positive enactment against denominational teaching by the school.Ex parte Maher, Record of Proceedings in Maher v Town Council of Portland, p. 26. He also concluded that the provision for Bible readings in the schools did not establish that the schools were denominational, since in his view the Bible was not a denominational book.Ex parte Maher, Record of Proceedings in Maher v Town Council of Portland, p. 27. Justice Fisher then referred briefly to the Common Schools Act. He concluded that it was essentially the same as the Parish Schools Act, with the only real difference that school assessment became mandatory. He also noted that the Common Schools Act did not provide directly for bible readings, but left the decision as to Bible readings to the Board of Education, which could enact a regulation on that issue. He stated that whether or not the Board enacted such a regulation did not affect the constitutionality of the Act as a whole. As a result, he concluded that the Common Schools Act was constitutional. = Concurring Reasons of Justice Wetmore = Justice Wetmore also issued concurring reasons. He agreed with the other members of the Court that the Common Schools Act was constitutional. However, he wanted to make it clear that in his opinion, the constitutionality of the Act was not affected by the regulations passed by the Board of Education. It might be that those regulations were not consistent with the Common Schools Act or with s. 93 of the Constitution Act 1867, but those issues were not before the Court in this proceeding, which was a challenge to the Common Schools Act itself. Justice Wetmore refrained from any comment on the regulations, leaving that to another day, if they were ever challenged.Ex parte Maher, Record of Proceedings in Maher v Town Council of Portland, p. 29.  Decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council  Lord Justice James, who gave the decision of the Judicial Committee upholding the Common Schools Act. Mr Maher appealed from the Supreme Court of New Brunswick to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, at that time the highest court in the British Empire. (The Supreme Court of Canada had not yet been created.) The appellant was represented by Joseph Brown, Q.C., and Mr Duff of the New Brunswick bar. Sir John Burgess Karslake and Attorney General King of New Brunswick appeared for the respondent, defending the legislation. The Judicial Committee heard the case on July 17, 1874. During oral argument, the judges repeatedly questioned whether the schools established under the Parish Schools Act could be termed \\"denominational,\\" as those schools were not under the legal control of any particular religious denomination, and could change if the religious composition of the local electorate changed. After extensive questioning of counsel for the appellant during oral argument, the Judicial Committee did not call on counsel for the respondent and dismissed the appeal from the bench.Maher v Town Council of Portland, reported in Wheeler's Confederation Law of Canada, pp. 362-366. Lord Justice James gave the decision of the Committee. In short oral reasons,Maher v Town Council of Portland (1874), reported in Wheeler's Confederation Law of Canada (London: Eyre & Spottiswoode, 1896), p. 362 he quoted a lengthy passage from the reasons of Justice Fisher in the New Brunswick Supreme Court. James L.J. agreed with Justice Fisher that the schools established under the Parish Schools Act had not been denominational schools. He held that the fact that a school in a particular area could be under the control of one religious denomination through the electoral process, and later could be under the control of another denomination if there were changes in the local electorate, demonstrated that there was no legal right involved. The changes under the Common Schools Act therefore did not affect any legal right or privilege protected by s. 93(1) of the Constitution Act, 1867. He ruled that the Common Schools Act was constitutional.Maher v. Town Council of Portland, reported in Wheeler's Confederation Law of Canada, pp. 366-367.  Subsequent Treatment of the Decision  The oral reasons of James L.J. were not reported in the official reports, and are not part of the formal record of the Privy Council.Maher v Town Council of Portland, [1874 UKPC 83], The only source for the reasons for judgment is the text-book, Wheeler's Confederation Law of Canada, published in 1896. The author of that text explained that the reasons were taken from the shorthand notes of Mr. Groves, one of the solicitors for the respondent.Wheeler's Confederation Law of Canada, p. 367. In 1892, the Judicial Committee again considered the scope of s. 93 of theConstitution Act, 1867, in the case of City of Winnipeg v Barrett. The case was argued and decided prior to the publication of the Wheeler text. The Judicial Committee did not refer to its own previous decision in Maher v Town Council of Portland. Instead, counsel in that case referred the Committee to the parallel decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Ex parte Renaud, which had been published in the New Brunswick case reports.City of Winnipeg v Barrett, [1892] A.C. 445 (P.C.). Following the publication of the reasons for the decision in Wheeler's Confederation Law of Canada, the Maher case has been cited approvingly by the courts.

Life and career  Strand was born in √Öl, Norway. He studied at the University of Kristiania (now University of Oslo). Around 1900 he focused on collecting insect specimens from Norway. These are now deposited at the university's museum, where he worked as a curator from 1901 to 1903. After studying at the University of Oslo Strand traveled in Norway from 1898 to 1903 collecting a great number of insects. For part of this time (1901‚Äì1903) he was a conservator in the museum of zoology of the university. He then left for Germany where he continued his studies of zoology at the University of Marburg (1903), then he worked with State Museum of Natural History Stuttgart (1905) and, later, that of T√ºbingen and then with Senckenberg Museum in Frankfurt. From 1907, he worked with Natural History Museum, Berlin. In 1923, he accepted the post of professor of zoology at the University of Riga and where he directed the institute of zoology and hydrobiology. Strand was the author of many publications, mainly on insects and spiders and was the descriptor of several hundred new species. From 1910 to 1929, he edited the review Archiv f√ºr Naturgeschichte and was the founder, in 1928, of Folia zoologica and hydrobiologica. Pierre Bonnet indicates, in his Bibliographia araneorum (pages 150‚Äì153), that a record number of new taxa were dedicated to Strand. Strand himself was the editor of a book in three volumes listing these, to celebrate his jubilee. There are indeed several hundreds of species which bear his name in all the possible forms: strandi, atrandella, embriki, embrikiellus, embrik-strandella, etc. In the same way, Bonnet reproached Strand renaming already described species, but of which he, Strand, considered the name incorrect: Strand draws up a list of these, in 1926, where he renames nearly 1,700 taxa of spiders. He was a prolific author, the list of his publications which he published in 1918 (after only twenty years of activity) is 1,200 titles. Strand was a contributor to Adalbert Seitz's Macrolepidoptera of the World (Bombycidae). He died in Riga, aged 71.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Florida Marlins, Boston Red Sox, Oakland Athletics, Cincinnati Reds and San Diego Padres, and in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) for the Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters. Major League career =Early career= After graduating from Wheeler High School in Marietta, Georgia, Hermida was the Marlins' No. 1 draft pick (11th overall) in the 2002 Major League Baseball draft, signed by Marlin scout, Joel Smith. He was one of the highest-rated minor league players that season, Hermida was a rising star in minor league baseball before being brought up. The Marlins were not looking for him to make a significant contribution the way Miguel Cabrera did when he was brought up from Double-A in June 2003, but Hermida has been compared to Braves' rookie Jeff Francoeur ever since the two were 14 years old growing up in the Atlanta area. Although the major difference between the two players is Hermida's eye for the strike zone, Hermida is one of the rare few in the minor leagues who was encouraged to swing more and walk less. =Florida Marlins= Hermida batting for the Florida Marlins in 2007. Called up from the Double-A Carolina Mudcats, Hermida made his major league debut with the Florida Marlins on August 31, 2005. The Marlins promoted Hermida before September 1 so that he would be eligible to be on the Marlins' postseason roster, however the Marlins, who led the wild-card race on September 13, lost 12 of their next 14 games and were eliminated from postseason contention. In his debut, Hermida became the second of only four players in history to hit a grand slam in his first major league at-bat, after Bill Duggleby in 1898, and followed by Kevin Kouzmanoff in 2006 and Daniel Nava in 2010. Hermida is the only player to accomplish this feat as a pinch hitter, coming off St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Al Reyes. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, the only other player with a grand slam in his first major league at-bat was pitcher Bill Duggleby, who did it for the Philadelphia Phillies at home against the New York Giants in the second inning on April 21, 1898. Duggleby was the winning pitcher that day. However, since then Kevin Kouzmanoff, while on the Cleveland Indians, hit a grand slam on the first pitch of his first major league at-bat against Edinson V√≥lquez, and Daniel Nava of the Red Sox hit a grand slam on the first pitch of his first major league at-bat against Joe Blanton. (Nava was playing left field for Boston in part because of an injury to Hermida, who was injured in a collision with third baseman Adri√°n Beltr√©.) Bobby Bonds of the San Francisco Giants also hit a slam in his first game off Los Angeles Dodgers reliever John Purdin, doing so in his third plate appearance on June 25, 1968, at Candlestick Park, as did the Giants' Brandon Crawford in the third at-bat of his debut May 27, 2011, off Milwaukee Brewers pitcher Shaun Marcum. In 2007, he led all Major League right fielders in errors, with 9, and had the lowest fielding percentage among them, .966. =Boston Red Sox= On November 5, 2009, Hermida was traded to the Boston Red Sox for left-handed minor league pitchers Hunter Jones and Jose Alvarez. Hermida played 52 games for the Red Sox in 2010, including 41 starts in left field, batting .203 in 158 at-bats. On July 31, 2010, Hermida was designated for assignment. On August 31, Hermida was released. =Oakland Athletics= On September 3, 2010, Hermida signed a minor league contract with the Oakland Athletics and appeared in a few games at Triple-A Sacramento before being called to the parent club, where he played in 21 games through the end of the season. He declared for free agency on October 12. =Cincinnati Reds= Hermida signed a minor league contract with the Cincinnati Reds on January 4, 2011 with an invitation to spring training, where Hermida competed for a spot on the bench as a left-handed batter/backup outfielder. Hermida started the season with the Reds' AAA team, the Louisville Bats. On April 18, he was added to the Reds 40-man roster and called up to the Reds after Juan Francisco was put on the disabled list. Hermida played in 10 games before being sent back down to Triple-A on May 4 when Fred Lewis came off the disabled list. Hermida spent the rest of the season in Louisville, where he was named an International League midseason All-Star. =San Diego Padres= On August 31, 2011, the Padres claimed Hermida off waivers from the Reds. Hermida finished 2011 with 7 walks and 9 hits, including 1 home run, in 48 plate appearances for the Padres. Hermida appeared in 13 games for the Padres in April 2012, picking up 6 hits in 24 at-bats. A strained abductor muscle sent him to the disabled list on April 27. After missing two months on the DL, he finished his season with the Triple-A Tucson Padres, posting a .252/.318/.358 line in 151 at-bats. On August 22, he was designated for assignment to clear room on the 40-man roster. He was released on August 28, becoming a free agent. =Cleveland Indians= On February 4, 2013, the Cleveland Indians signed Hermida to a minor league contract. =Milwaukee Brewers= On January 25, 2014, the Milwaukee Brewers signed Hermida to a minor league deal. =Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters= On December 12, 2014, he was released by the Brewers and signed with the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters of Japan's Nippon Professional Baseball. He became a free agent after the 2015 season.

Hohn was largely unheralded during the 1989 Ashes series, during which his wickets included England's Ian Botham in the fourth Test at Old Trafford, who was bowled for a duck after missing a charging hoick. Hohns also was a handy late-order batsman, often batting as high as number six for Queensland in Sheffield Shield cricket. He finished his first-class career with two centuries and 30 half-centuries from 152 matches, though 40 was his best Test score among his seven innings.

Hohns was one of only two spin bowlers in the touring party, along with former Australian Test left-arm spinner, Tom Hogan. Hohns was one of the Rebel Australians banned from playing state and Test cricket for the following two years.

Hohns also made several tough decisions in charge, including ending the careers of Ian Healy and Mark Waugh and stripping Steve Waugh of the one- day captaincy.

The series started in November 2004 and ended in April 2006 after 21 chapters. It was followed up by Mobile Suit Gundam SEED C.E. 73 Œî Astray, which also tied into Mobile Suit Gundam SEED C.E. 73: Stargazer. Plot Destiny Astray focuses on war photo- journalist Jess Rabble and his ZGMF-X12 Astray Out Frame. The Astray Out Frame was built by Lowe (using the incomplete frame of a ZAFT ZGMF-X12A Testament), and later given to Jess. Jess is often accompanied by Kaite Madigan, a mercenary and former ZAFT mobile suit pilot who serves as his bodyguard and owns several customized mobile suits of his own. Both are currently employees of a mysterious industrialist named Matias, who claims to have \\"no grasp of history\\", therefore he wishes for Jess to record history as it unfolds. Lowe is effectively removed from the story in the first chapter of Destiny Astray where he begins a long journey to Mars. He returns in later chapters that are set two years later. Many other Astray characters, including Gai, Canard, and Rondo Mina, also continue to appear in supporting roles. The story provides the reader with background information not shown in the TV series. Characters Production The Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny Astray series was in a production venture that encompassed four forms of Media. It was firstly the TV-series Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny which told the main story and presented several plot-points that was addressed in the other mediums. The second was the photo-novels that presented side stories to \\"Destiny Astray\\" as well as technical files on the mobile Suits and how to construct them in models. The third media was two novels that contained several stories with the \\"Destiny Astray\\" cast and were linked to the main story. = Photo-novels = The photo-novels were published in the Japanese Dengeki Hobby Magazine by Mediaworks. Each chapter called a \\"Shot\\" was released up to \\"Shot 026\\", each chapter compromising 8-11 pages. It usually followed a layout of having one or two two-page spreads with a scene enactment with models of the \\"Mobile Suits\\" the chapter was about. It was followed by the story with exclusive artwork and line-art of various \\"Mobile Suits\\" and characters. At the end, the chapter included a custom made \\"Mobile Suit\\" that was featured in the chapter.Explanation of the Photo-novels on the official site. The end of Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny Astray was not concluded in the manga itself but in the final \\"Shot: 026\\" of the photo-novels. All \\"shots\\" were collected and published into two volumes on June 26, 2006 and July 2006, respectively.Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny Astray Photo-novel Vol 1Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny Astray Photo-novel Vol 2 =Gold-Frame= To promote the release of the 1/100 Scale \\"Gundam Astray Gold Frame Amatsu\\", a small manga chapter was produced with the \\"Gundam SEED Destiny Astray\\" label. It is a small story about Rondo Mina Sahaku and a mission to liberate a town from enemy forces. There's also a hint to where it got the Okitsu-no-Kagami equipment.

Known as the National Dairy Farm magazine, it contains articles about and for the dairy industry. History Hoard's, as it is more simply known by its readers, was started in 1885 as a supplement to the Daily Jefferson County Union. The editor of the newspaper, William Dempster Hoard, saw the effects of the area's glacial soil on local farms. There was only a thin layer of top soil which could not support many crops. Hoard knew from his experience in New York that dairy herds could improve the farmland. Upon W. D. Hoard's death, the publishing of Hoard's was passed onto his son, Frank Ward Hoard, in 1918 and then to his grandson, William D. Hoard, Jr. in 1939. =Cow judging contest= A popular tradition is the magazine's Cow Judging Contest, normally held annually. 2011 was the 81st year in which the contest was held. Over the course of five issues, readers are asked to evaluate four cows from one particular breed of cattle. The breeds judged are the Ayrshire, Brown Swiss, Holstein, Guernsey, Jersey, Milking Shorthorn, and Red & White. Each of the four cows is presented in three poses: a side view, a rear view, and an upper rear view showing the cow's back. Readers can rank cows from each class on an entry form in the magazine. The entry that comes closest to the evaluation of a panel of judging experts is the winner and receives cash prizes. =Hoard's Dairyman Farm= Hoard's Dairyman Farm was purchased in 1899 by W.D. Hoard to act as a model dairy farm and add credibility to his publication. It was first used to demonstrate effective methods of growing, preserving, and feeding alfalfa. It was also central to his fight against bovine tuberculosis. The farm maintains the oldest continuously registered herd of Guernsey cattle in the country. The herd was long housed in the original barn, purchased by Hoard in 1899, which was enlarged several times to a final capacity of 80 cows. In the summer of 2007, the herd was moved to a new, free-stall facility and expanded to 270 milking cows.

According to Investopedia, a cloud can be defined as: \\"Any document, claim, unreleased lien or encumbrance that might invalidate or impair the title to real property or make the title doubtful. Clouds on title are usually discovered during a title search.\\" Clouded title can thus be contrasted with a clear title, which indicates that a property is unencumbered. A cloud on title may reduce the value and marketability of property because any prospective buyer aware of the cloud will know that they are buying the risk the grantor may not be able to convey good title. Often, the discovery of a cloud on title will provide the grantee a reason to back out of a contract for the sale of real property. Some documents that affect title may be considered clouds, but nonetheless are unlikely to affect marketability or resale, such as with covenants, conditions and restrictions in a homeowners' association or subdivision. Examples of clouds on title include a property's address being misspelled in a deed conveying title, a mortgage lien whose repayment hasn't been officially recorded, a deed which has been signed but hasn't been properly recorded, an easement that has not been properly recorded, unpaid property taxes, a failure to transfer property rights (such as mineral rights) to a former owner of the property, and a pending lawsuit before a court of law over ownership to the property. The usual remedy for a cloud on title is to file a civil action to quiet title which resolves the outstanding or unresolved cloud. Clouded title can cause delays or denials in receiving certain forms of disaster recovery aid, especially longer-term rebuilding assistance. This can be a more serious problem for low-income families who over time might not have been able to afford lawyers and legal fees for probate, and who can face even worse financial problems in the wake of a disaster. This has led some states to make available low-cost mechanisms to transfer title.How Clouded Titles Affect Low-Income Victims Of Disasters See also *Continuando *Bare trust References Category:Property law ","title":"Cloud on title"},{"id":"2588902","text":"Fascism in Britain is a book by Philip Rees.

The first such devices were the chastity belts of the 15th century. Although a number of devices have been proposed, none of them are in commercial production .  Statistics  Some of the most well- known anti-rape devices were proposed in South Africa, a country with a high incidence of rape and a low rate of successful convictions. South African activists argue that the legal system has not been effective in preventing or reducing rape and other violent acts against women. According to a 2001 World Health Organization study, 20% of women worldwide had been victims of rape or attempted rape at least once in their lives. According to figures from a 2011 report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one in five women in America are victims of sexual assault. More than 40% of these victims are children, reporting they were first raped before they were 18 years old.  Types of devices  = Physical deterrents = A number of concepts have been proposed for physical deterrents to rape, and although they attracted media attention, none of them have gone into production.  Jaap Haumann  An early prototypical anti-rape female tampon was invented in late 2000 by Jaap Haumann, a South African man, for the purpose of preventing rape. Haumann's device was designed to resemble a tampon for ease of insertion, and consisted of a hard cylindrical plastic core containing a tensioned spring blade primed to slice when pressed against by the tip of a penis. Following activation, a portion of the tip of the penis would be removed, in effect performing a minor penectomy.  Rape-aXe  An anti-rape female condom using a different design was invented by Sonette Ehlers, a South African woman. Ehlers was motivated to create it while working as a blood technician with the South African Blood Transfusion Service, during which time she met many rape victims. Ehlers mentioned that she was inspired to create RAPEX (later renamed to Rape-aXe) when a patient who had been raped stated, \\"If only I had teeth down there,\\" suggesting the myth of the vagina dentata. Initially called RapeX, the name was changed in 2006 upon discovering that RAPEX is also an EU warning system against dangerous goods on the market. The Rape-aXe is a latex sheath embedded with shafts of sharp, inward-facing barbs that would be worn by a woman in her vagina like a female condom. If an attacker were to attempt vaginal rape, his penis would enter the latex sheath and be snagged by the barbs, causing the attacker excruciating pain during withdrawal and giving the victim time to escape. The condom would remain attached to the attacker's body when he withdrew and could only be removed surgically, which would alert hospital staff and police. Like most condoms, Rape-aXe also usually prevents pregnancy and the transmission of HIV and sexually transmitted infections. Rape-aXe was unveiled on August 31, 2005 in South Africa. There have been objections to Ehlers' invention, describing it as \\"vengeful, horrible, and disgusting\\" and its planned sale in pharmacies has been opposed. Concerns were raised that use of the device could possibly enrage an attacker and further jeopardize the victim. Ehlers responded saying that \\"many women have been killed over time, as nobody can guarantee the outcome of any rape' and that the pain caused from Rape-aXe will temporarily disable the attacker, giving the victim time to get away. Although media coverage at the time implied that mass production was due to begin in April 2007, the device has never been marketed to the public and it remains unclear whether the product will ever be available for purchase. = Anti-date rape drug products = A startup called DrinkSavvy has raised funds for a line of straws and glassware that will change color if a drink has been altered with a date rape drug, intending to release its first products in December 2013. The cups, glasses, and straws/stirrers served at bars and restaurants would look normal but they would immediately change color to warn people when someone slips a date rape drug into their drink. , no product had been released.

The grand fair was held in every 60 years as a local tradition. =Manufacturing industries= Xiaolan Town is dubbed ‚ÄúLock City of the South‚Äù as well as ‚ÄúElectronic Acoustic Industrial Base‚Äù in China. The two industries are the pillar industries of Xiaolan. Xiaolan controls 23% of the national market share. Indeed, there are production lines of such famous brands as Vantage gas stoves, Guli locks and St. Allen nail clippers in Xiaolan. Over 30% of manufacturing enterprises in Xiaolan are engaged in locks and hardware production. Such production accounted for nearly 50% of the total industrial outputs of Xiaolan and employed more than 30,000 people in 2002. The success of Xiaolan in this sector brought it an unprecedented honour of being certified as the critical hardware industrial base by China National Hardware Association in 2002. Meanwhile, a dynamic growth in the sector of electronic acoustics, which has taken place in recent years, has made Xiaolan the first \\"Electronic Acoustics Industrial Base\\" in China. Between 2000 and 2002, over a hundred enterprises started business in Xiaolan. Both local and foreign enterprises which specialize in production of domestic stereos, DVDs, laser heads, high-tech digital audio equipment, loudspeakers, circuit boards and aluminium panels are clustered in this small town. Production bases of such foreign brands as ADS and Boston operate in Xiaolan while Philips, Toshiba, JBL, Onkyo and Jamo also run their OEM production there. In 2002, the industrial outputs of this sector reached RMB 4.6 billion, accounting for almost one third of the town's industrial output. In order to upgrade their products and production techniques, both sectors are restlessly engaged in R&D.; For example, a technology development centre specializing in the production of locks and hardware was set up in February 2003. Post-doctoral work stations and partnerships with universities also contribute to technological upgrades of Xiaolan's hardware industry. On the other hand, an enterprise-based technology development centre with investment from a US-based acoustics stereo enterprise, AVlight was also established in Xiaolan Industrial Zone in 2002, aiming to upgrade the technology in the electronic acoustics industry of the town. To expand its sales of hardware products and electronic acoustic appliance at home and abroad, Xiaolan also needs to put greater effort into product promotion and marketing with possible participation of Hong Kong companies. Culture The residents in Xiaolan Town are being cultivated with the horticulture of chrysanthemum. Their lifestyle is characterised by a high participation with chrysanthemum. For example, they provide banquets on the theme of chrysanthemum. They appreciate the noble character and integrity of chrysanthemum, which is reflected in their poems and drawings. The residents are enthusiastic about sports. The Xiaolan Integrated Sports Centre was established in 1994. Some national and international ping-pong tournaments were held since then.

Hanging Rocks are located four miles (6 km) north of Romney at Wappocomo on West Virginia Route 28. Hanging Rocks has also been known throughout its history as Painted Rocks and Blue's Rocks. When distinguished from the \\"Lower Hanging Rocks\\" along the South Branch at Blues Beach to the north, Hanging Rocks is referred to as Upper Hanging Rocks. Geology Hanging Rocks is arranged in the form of three anticlinal arches, of which the most eastern spans 250, the second 550, and the third 220 yards in width. Hanging Rocks consists of anticlinal stratified sandstone and limestone layers. The upper stratum of rocks is Monterey and Oriskany sandstone. Immediately below the Monterey and Oriskany (Ridgeley) sandstone lies a layer of cherty limestone known as Lewiston chert-lentil which consists of a conglomeration of brachiopods. Atop Hanging Rocks is a level bench of land devoid of stone and containing fine rich soil. At the western end of the Hanging Rocks formation lies an exposure of fine black to drab shales also containing small concretions and some fossils. Contained in one of the shale layers are numerous specimens of Phacops cristata Hall. A volume of The Journal of Geology published by the University of Chicago in 1915 noted the following additional species collected in the layers of Hanging Rocks shale: strata. *Stropheodonta sp. *Chonetes cf. lepidus Hall *Dalmanella lenticularis (Vanuxem) *Cyrtina hamiltonensis (?) Hall *Ambocoelia umbonata (Conrad) *Styliolina fissurella (Hall) Of the aforementioned fauna, Dalmanella lenticularis (Vanuxem) is confined to the Onondaga formation; Cyrtina hamiltonensis Hall occurs in the Onondaga, Hamilton, and Portage formations; Ambocoelia umbonata (Conrad) from the Onondaga to the Chemung inclusive; Styliolina fissurella (Hall) in the southern Onondaga shale, Marcellus, Genesee, and Portage black shales; and Phacops cristata Hall elsewhere in the Onondaga. The Journal of Geology concluded that the Romney shales present at both Hanging Rocks and Mechanicsburg Gap represent the southwestern continuation of the Onondaga limestone, Marcellus shale, and Hamilton formation of New York. The Hanging Rocks formation lies within a deep and narrow gap in Mill Creek Mountain formed by the South Branch Potomac River. The distance through the gap at Hanging Rocks is five-eighths of a mile. The South Branch flowed in its present course as Mill Creek Mountain formed and slowly cut away at the mountain to expose Hanging Rocks. The gap at Hanging Rocks is one of four gaps in Mill Creek Mountain, the others being Mechanicsburg Gap, the Lower Hanging Rocks gap at Blue Beach, and the gap at the North Branch Potomac River to the west of its confluence with the South Branch to form the Potomac River.  History  =Native American presence= Battle between the Delawares and the Catawbas Hanging Rocks was originally the site of a Native American village, most likely either Delaware or Seneca. As such, it served as the scene of a fierce battle between Delaware and Catawba Native Americans. A large party of Delawares had invaded the territory of the Catawbas, taken several prisoners, and commenced their retreat homewards. The retreating Delawares halted at Hanging Rocks and commenced fishing in the South Branch. The Catawbas, in close pursuit, discovered the Delawares and sent a party across the river to their rear and a party to their front, thus enclosing them. A bloody battle ensued resulting in the deaths of hundreds of Delaware. It is believed very few Delawares escaped the massacre. Archaeological sites Hanging Rocks viewed from across the river in the 1890s. At the time Samuel Kercheval's A History of the Valley of Virginia was written in 1833, a row of Indian graves, possibly belonging to the casualties of the aforementioned battle, existed between the public road and the perpendicular cliffs in the narrow margin of land along the South Branch. The graves Kercheval cites may have been reinterments of the human bones unearthed during the construction of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad line along the base of Hanging Rocks in the 1880s. Skeletons of \\"gigantic size\\" were exhumed from a purported village and burial site on the farm of Mr. Herriott opposite the South Branch and below Hanging Rocks, providing further evidence of a Native American presence at Hanging Rocks gap. In addition to skeletons, numerous fireplaces, iron hatchets, glass beads, and brass ornaments. Persons well- versed in the history of the region assert that the Native American peoples occupying this village were a branch of the Seneca. There were formerly many stone mounds along the foot of the hill to the rear of this village, however, all of them have now been removed. Some of them were along the hillside a few feet above the margin of the level bottom; others were on the level but nowhere more than 50 or from the foot of the hill. The mounds varied in height from two to eight feet in diameter from 12 or 15 to 40 or and were composed entirely of stone. All except the smallest ones had a depression at the top as if they had contained a vault or pen of logs whose decay had allowed the rocks to settle. Fragmentary bones were found in many of the mounds lying on the original surface. Very few art relics were found at the mounds site. One contained a pipe with a wolf's head carved on it. A cairn on the hillside near the schoolhouse on the Herriott farm contained some decayed bones. =European settlement= The area surrounding Hanging Rocks was settled by European settlers around the mid-18th century. Trees had been cleared from the rocks before the arrival of settlers. Early residents in its vicinity referred to Hanging Rocks as \\"Painted Rocks\\" because of the colorful figures and formations within its strata. The colors and figures, once thought to be Native American, were produced through geologic processes including the seepage of water through the rock. During the French and Indian War, two frontier stockades were constructed in close proximity to Hanging Rocks for the defense of the South Branch Valley: Fort Williams in 1754 two miles (3 km) to the north and Fort Foreman one mile (1.6 km) to the south. Francis Asbury, one of the first two bishops of the Methodist Episcopal Church, passed by Hanging Rocks during his travels in the South Branch Valley, which he described as a country of \\"mountains and natural curiosities.\\" Asbury gave a description of Hanging Rocks in his journal on June 10, 1781: =Transportation= The Moorefield and North Branch Turnpike (later known as the North and South Branches Turnpike) wagon road connecting Romney and Cumberland, Maryland, once occupied the narrow space between the South Branch and Hanging Rocks. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (currently the South Branch Valley Railroad) later shared the narrow space, which has varied between and in width, along with the pike after its completion to Romney from Green Spring in 1884. The pike later became West Virginia Route 28 and was rerouted to the east of Mill Creek Mountain. The old Romney and Cumberland Pike span at the base of Hanging Rocks was reclassified as West Virginia Secondary Route 28/15 and is currently named Harriott-Wappocomo Road. =American Civil War= On June 19, 1861, Captain John Q. Winfield wrote from his encampment at Hanging Rocks: Captain Winfield's letter illustrated Hanging Rocks' proximity to some of Hampshire County's wealthiest families and their plantations including George William Washington and his son Robert M. Washington's Ridgedale, Colonel Isaac Parsons' Wappocomo, the Vance family's Ashbrook, and the Parsons and Inskeep families' The Rocks. General Turner Ashby and his command occupied the Washington family's Ridgedale to the north of Hanging Rocks. Battle of Hanging Rocks Pass A major skirmish, known as the Battle of Hanging Rocks Pass, took place at Hanging Rocks on Tuesday morning September 24, 1861. The skirmish took place between the Confederate Hampshire Militia led by Colonel Angus William McDonald and several companies of Union troops under the command of Colonel Cantwell of the 82nd Ohio Infantry. On the evening of September 23, 1861, Colonel McDonald received information that Union forces planned an attempt to pass through the gap at Hanging Rocks early the next morning. Upon learning of this, McDonald and his 26 other men of the Hampshire Militia climbed to the top of Hanging Rocks in the early morning of September 24 in preparation for the arrival of Union troops. McDonald also sent a scouting party down the South Branch on the night of September 23. Hanging Rocks was a strategic location during the American Civil War. Troops traveling between Romney and points north, including Cumberland and Green Spring, naturally utilized the Romney and Cumberland Pike at the base of Hanging Rocks. In addition, the shallow nature of the South Branch at Hanging Rocks created a crossing which allowed for a secondary connection of the Romney and Cumberland Pike to the Northwestern Turnpike at Mechanicsburg via Fox Hollow. Upon taking to the summit, McDonald and his men piled boulders at the precipice of Hanging Rocks' cliffs to hurl at Union troops marching on the pike below. The Confederates completed their preparations by daybreak. McDonald instructed his men to be careful not to mistake their returning scouting party for the advancing Union troops. Shortly after daybreak, Union cavalry (a company of Ringgold Cavalry) crossed the ford on the South Branch at the north end of Hanging Rocks pass and its columns marched onto the pike below the awaiting Confederate militiamen. Initially, the Confederates atop the rocks lay flat trying to ascertain through the fog whether the approaching cavalry was their returning scouting party. The Union troops at the base of Hanging Rocks were naturally suspicious of the strategic location and were on high alert as they crossed the ford and made their way onto the pike. The Union troops noticed heads of the Confederate militiamen peering over the cliffs and fired upon them. The Confederates responded to the firing by hurling the boulders onto the road below causing the Union cavalry to hastily retreat down the pike and across the ford. In their hasty retreat, several of the Union cavalry ran over their infantrymen forcing them into the river, where at least five drowned. Sergeant H. B. Hedge of the Ringgold Cavalry Company made the following record in his journal about the incident: The bodies of approximately a dozen Union soldiers were interred in the sand of the South Branch's western bank following the skirmish. High water the following Saturday September 28 washed additional bodies down the river which were also retrieved from the South Branch and buried. The Confederates were unaware, because of the earlier fog and the false report of a Union advance, that the Union troops were actually in retreat upon their arrival at Hanging Rocks. The Confederates left Hanging Rocks gap and pulled back to Romney. Poetry Hanging Rocks was the inspiration of the poem \\"The Hanging Rocks\\" published in John C. Newman's The Harmonies of Creation or The Music of the Morning Stars: To Which are Added, Miscellaneous Poems, on Religious, Moral, and Patriotic Subjects in 1836.

She was born in Lewis County, New York.Her parents were in Lewis County, New York, US Census for 1850. Her parents were in Lewis County, New York, US Census for 1860 She was a nurse (later a physician) with the Southern Pacific Railroad in the early 20th century. According to a historic marker in Indio, California, after a near-collision in her Model T in 1917, \\"She personally painted the first known stripe in California on Indio Boulevard, then part of U.S. Route 99, during 1917.\\" Early life McCarroll was born and raised in the Adirondacks. McCarroll's mother Adaline died December 9, 1867, when McCarroll was only five months old. By the 1880 census, her now remarried father and his family were living in Emporia, Kansas, where he served a time as mayor.Unable to locate in 1870 United States census, but found in 1880. By 1888 her father had abandoned his second wife and son in Kansas and moved to Los Angeles, California, where McCarroll later joined him. On December 31, 1896, June Adaline Whittelsey, age 29, married Timothy Preston Hill, age 36, in Los Angeles, in a ceremony performed by Rev. J. Thomson of the Unity Church. Mr. Hill was a Massachusetts native living in Los Angeles as early as 1888. It was a short-lived relationship, and by 1900 they had separated. The 1900 Los Angeles census shows McCarroll as June Hill, physician, married three years but no husband in household.She was living with 76-year-old thrice- married father Nelson Whittlesey. He was listed as married five years, but no spouse in household, either. (While still married to second wife in Kansas, in 1895 he married a third wife in California which ended in separation the same year.) According to the 1910 census, 1900 was the same year of McCarroll's second marriage to James R. Robertson.The 1910 Indio Township, Riverside County, California US census gives James R. Robertson, 39 of Missouri, and his wife June A. W. 42 of New York who was a general practice physician. They were married 10 years, both on second marriages. As the final divorce from Hill did not take place until November 1915, likely her marriage to Robertson was common-law. McCarroll attended a medical college in Chicago, then eventually moved back to Southern California in 1904 with her second husband, James R. Robertson. They had hoped that the desert climate would help him recuperate from tuberculosis, but Robertson died in 1914. Within two years, she had remarried, this time to Frank Taylor McCarroll,Middle name reference the local station manager for the Southern Pacific Railroad. From 1907 to 1916, she was the only physician regularly practicing in the vast desert between the Salton Sea and Palm Springs. She was also the only physician serving the five Indian reservations in the area on behalf of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Highway marking In the fall of 1917, McCarroll was driving on the road leading to her office near Indio, California, on a stretch of highway that would later be incorporated into U.S. Route 99; the highway remains today as part of Indio Boulevard. She was run off the road by a truck, as she recalled many years later: McCarroll soon communicated her idea to the local chamber of commerce and the Riverside County Board of Supervisors, with no success. Finally, she took it upon herself to hand-paint a white stripe down the middle of the road, thus establishing the actual width of the lane to prevent similar accidents. Through the Indio Women's Club and many similar women's organizations, McCarroll launched a vigorous statewide letter writing campaign on behalf of her proposal. In November 1924, the idea was adopted by the California Highway Commission and of lines were painted at a cost of $163,000 (equivalent to $ in ). Later the idea was adopted worldwide. A memorial plaque to McCarroll is located at the intersection of Indio Boulevard and Fargo Street in Indio, California. On April 24, 2002, to honor her contribution to road safety, California officially designated the stretch of Interstate 10 near Indio east of the Indio Boulevard/Jefferson Street exit as \\"The Doctor June McCarroll Memorial Freeway.\\" The plaque is located at GPS coordinates . The Federal Highway Administration has acknowledged Kenneth I. Sawyer of the Marquette County Road Commission in Michigan for painting the first highway centerline in 1917 on what was then M-15 (part of the modern County Road 492). Photographs from 1917 of the Michigan location clearly show the centerline in place during that summer, before McCarroll's fall 1917 incident. The first centerline was painted by Edward N. Hines in the Detroit area in 1911 on a city street, so neither can lay claim to the very first centerline in the country; for his efforts, Hines was awarded the first Paul Mijksenaar Design for Function Award in Amsterdam in 2011.

Rosemeadow is located 56 kilometres south-west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Campbelltown and is part of the Macarthur region. History Rosemeadow owes its name to early settler Thomas Rose, who in 1818 bought a farm called Mount Gilead which covered parts of modern-day Rosemeadow and neighbouring Gilead. Rose was a baker and publican as well as a farmer, building a mill on his property and a couple of large dams which helped him and his neighbours survive the drought of 1829. The area remained farmland until the mid-1970s when Sydney's urban sprawl reached it and the suburb was officially named in 1976. The Rosemeadow public housing estate is an example of the American Radburn design for public housing which turns houses around so they back on to streets with the fronts facing each other. This design has been criticised in Sydney as contributing to social problems and following an incident of street violence in 2009 orders were made to partially demolish the estate. Since the partial demolishing of the suburb, the streets have begun to be renamed. Commercial area Rosemeadow Marketplace, on the corner of Copperfield Drive and Fitzgibbon Lane, is a medium-sized shopping centre. The local post office sits within the Marketplace and nearby is a community health centre, fire station, high school and an Anglican church.UBD Sydney Street Directory, Universal Publishing, 2007 Schools John Therry Catholic High School is the oldest school in the suburb, having opened in 1981.

Roleplay is designed primarily to build first-person experience in a safe and supportive environment. Roleplay is widely acknowledged as a powerful technique across multiple avenues of training and education.  History  Howard Barrows invented the model for medical patient role-playing in 1963 at University of Southern California. This program allowed doctors practice taking medical histories and conducting physical examinations by participating in a one-on-one scenario with a role- player. The role-players (called Standardized Patients or SP) were also trained on providing performance evaluations after the fiction of the scenario was complete. Barrows continued to evolve this model, eventually bringing it to other physicians in the 1970s, and into the academic world in the 1980s. Today, many hospitals and medical universities have their own standardized patient programs that employ part-time role-players trained to specific standards of interaction. The Association of Standardized Patient Educators has members from six different continents. An industry of professional skills training emerged in the late 1990s, primarily in the United Kingdom. Companies began hiring acting professionals to create situational dramas to be overcome by learners as part of an experiential learning methodology. Today, there are more than twenty companies in the UK that specialize in providing role-players for workplace simulations. Professional military role-players have been employed by the US Military since 2001, primarily as a response to the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States. Preparation requirements for the resulting War in Afghanistan created a need for cultural role-players skilled in languages and customs of current theaters of war to populate simulated villages and urban environments.  Use in Experiential Learning  A medical trainee examining the abdomen of a Standardized Patient = Medical Training = Medical role-players typically fall under the category of Standardized Patients (SP). SPs are extensively used in medical and nursing education to allow students to practice and improve their clinical and conversational skills for an actual patient encounter. SPs commonly provide feedback after such encounters. They are also useful to train students to learn professional conduct in potentially embarrassing situations such as pelvic or breast exams. SPs are also used extensively in testing of clinical skills of students, usually as a part of an objective structured clinical examination. Typically, the SP will use a checklist to record the details of the encounter. Role-players can engage with medical learners in one of two ways: # As part of a simulation wherein both learner and role-player are aware of the fiction, and have established rules and boundaries (i.e. the \\"fiction contract\\"). # Surreptitiously, for purposes of healthcare provider evaluation or health informatics research. Medical role-players can also be used to portray distraught or bereaved family members of patients in emergency medicine scenarios, giving the learners practice in handling emotionally difficult or distracting situations. A U.S. Soldier, second from right, with the 3rd Squadron, 2nd Cavalry Regiment interacts with a civilian role player during a mission rehearsal exercise at the Joint Multinational Readiness Center in Hohenfels = Military Training = Role-players in military simulations can portray various types of interactive characters:  Opposing force (OPFOR)  Role-players are trained to accurately emulate real-life enemies in order to provide a more realistic experience for military personnel. To avoid the diplomatic ramifications of naming a real nation as a likely enemy, training scenarios often use fictional countries similar military characteristics to the expected real-world foes. Main article: OPFOR  Civilians on the Battlefield (COB)  Some COB role-players are expatriates of foreign countries who have the looks, language skills, and cultural familiarity needed to accurately portray key points of interaction in a military scenario. Others are locals who may be unskilled as actors, and primarily serve to populate a particular area of operations within a military scenario so that soldiers can be challenged with problems of crowd control, or situational awareness. U.S. Army Sgt. 1st Class Ahmad Whitted, standing, an observer-controller, monitors the interaction between a role player and a Slovenian Civilian Protection agent Aug. 25, 2014, in Postojna, Slovenia  Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TC3)  Field medical training, or Tactical Combat Casualty Care training utilizes role-players to portray wounded soldiers and civilians on the battlefield. Role-players will often scream in pain, convulse, and panic to create extreme emotional conditions under which battle medics must operate proficiently. It is not uncommon for TC3 scenarios to employee amputees as role-players. These role-players are fitted with realistic prosthetic wounds that can gush synthetic blood or other bodily fluids in order to heighten the emotional intensity of a simulation. It is expected that trainees who are routinely exposed to such intense situations in simulations will eventually experience a level of \\"stress-inoculation\\" that will provide life-saving advantages in real battle situations. = Law Enforcement Training = Role-players are often hired by law enforcement agencies to portray criminals or victims of crimes in scenarios that simulate typical law enforcement situations. These can range from a response to a domestic violence call to an \\"active shooter\\" scenario. Role-players are advantageous over video-based police simulations in that they can escalate or de-escalate a confrontational situation in response to the words, body language, and tone of voice of the trainee. This becomes key in effective use- of-force training. Law enforcement scenarios use role-players for scenarios such as interrogation, hostage negotiation, and witness interviews. Recently, law enforcement agencies have begun to introduce the identification of human trafficking victims into their role-player curriculum. The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center at Glynco, Georgia is the largest employer of non- military role-players in the United States. = Business Leadership Training = Role-players are used by businesses to equip their leadership with experience in handling interpersonal conflict, negotiations, interviews, performance reviews, customer service, workplace safety, and ethical dilemmas. A role-player may also simulate difficult and sensitive conversations such as layoffs, or reports of sexual harassment. This gives leaders a chance to make mistakes in a safe environment, rather than learn from a mistake in the real world, which could lead to costly litigation. = Forecasting = Role-play also has applications in forecasting. One forecasting method is to simulate the condition(s) being studied. Some experts in forecasting have found that role-thinking for producing inaccurate forecasts unless groups act as protagonists in their interactions with one another.  Learning Advantages  The use of skilled role-players in a simulation has several benefits over using unskilled confederates: * When untrained fellow learners are asked to serve as role-players in a simulation, the resulting learning experience tends to be ineffective due to embarrassment, intimidation, or unrealistic performances. * Skilled role-players also help ensure the conditions for an effective simulation are intact. These conditions include maintaining a safe environment, and dynamically adjusting difficulty, complexity, and intensity to the capabilities and experience level of the learner. * Since role-players improvise each interaction, predictability is taken out of the simulation. Predictable scenarios limit the development of decision-making skills. * Role- player providers can typically offer broader coverage of demographic representation than is possible by using in-house staff to portray characters.  Limitations  Role-players can be expensive to organizations with limited training resources. Role-player fees are typically contingent upon skill and level of specialized knowledge, and can range from minimum wage to more than US$100 per hour. Certain types of training that require objectively quantifiable measures of success can be incompatible with the variability of using a human-in-the-loop.  In fiction  = The Diamond Age (novel) = Interactors feature prominently in Neal Stephenson's novel, The Diamond Age: Or, A Young Lady's Illustrated Primer'. Set in the near-future, artificial intelligence is depicted in the novel as having failed in its goal of creating software capable of passing the Turing Test, therefore it is renamed \\"pseudo- intelligence\\". As a result, virtual reality entertainments are augmented by role-players skilled in the use of digital puppetry who don motion capture suits and perform as interactive avatars within virtual environments. These human-in-the-loop simulations are known as \\"ractives\\" (an abbreviation of \\"interactives\\"), and the performers who drive them are called \\"ractors\\" (an abbreviation of \\"interactors\\"). = The Game (film) = Ubiquitous and surreptitious role-players are the primary plot drivers of the 1997 film, The Game, directed by David Fincher. The protagonist agrees to participate in a vaguely defined game hosted by a high-end entertainment company called Consumer Recreation Services. He later ends up being manipulated by dozens of CSR role-players who psychologically torment him to the brink of suicide. = The Magus (novel) = In the John Fowles' novel, The Magus, an eccentric and wealthy recluse uses surreptitious role-players to manipulate the protagonist. The novel never fully clarifies which characters are \\"real\\", and which are being portrayed by actors. Additionally, there are role-players who engage with the protagonist as multiple different characters. He eventually loses the ability to distinguish artifice from reality, and realizes that he has become a fictionalized version of himself in the simulation of his own life.

History  Mount Pritchard was originally home to the Cabrogal people who occupied much of the greater Fairfield area. In the early 19th century, the land was granted to a number of ex-convicts for farming. Later it was made part of the Male Orphan School Estate. In 1913, land west of Cabramatta Creek and Orange Grove Road previously owned by the Bull family was subdivided into smaller residential lots by a real estate property salesman named Hugh Pritchard, who named it the Cabramatta Park Estate. From 1919, to honour Mr Pritchard's releasing from debt of a number of landowners whom he'd financed, the estate was renamed Mount Pritchard. The local electoral polling place followed suit in 1924. From the early settler days the general area had been known unofficially as Mount Misery, originally because of a story of one of the early settlers and his family camping there whilst travelling, losing their bullocks, and for three weeks remaining in misery until starvation compelled them to beat a retreat, minus bullocks and dray.  Demographics  At the 2016 Australian census, Mount Pritchard had a population of 9,955. 50.6% of people were born in Australia.

She was in a position of political authority during the minority of the Xuantong Emperor from 1908 until 1912; when, on behalf of the Emperor, she signed the letter of abdication, effectively ending two thousand years of imperial Chinese history.

She chose her niece, Guixiang's daughter, to be the empress consort of the Guangxu Emperor because she wanted to strengthen the influence of the Yehe Nara clan within the imperial family. Lady Yehe Nara married the Guangxu Emperor on 26 February 1889, and became his Empress directly after the wedding. The wedding ceremony was an extremely extravagant and spectacular occasion. On 16 January 1889, the Forbidden City had caught fire, and the Gate of Supreme Harmony burnt down. According to imperial traditions, the route of the Emperor's wedding procession had to pass through the Gate of Supreme Harmony, which was completely destroyed. As a result, many people believed that this incident was a bad omen. Because the reconstruction of the gate would be extremely time- consuming, and the wedding date of the Emperor could not be postponed once decided, Cixi ordered the construction of a tent resembling the gate. The artisans used paper and wood to build it, and after it was done, the tent had exactly the same height and width as the original gate, with ornamentation extremely similar to the original. At first, even people who regularly walked through the inner palace could not tell the difference between the original gate and the temporary tent. After their marriage, the Empress was detested and ignored by the Guangxu Emperor, who favoured Consort Zhen of the Tatara clan. At first, Cixi regarded Zhen favourably, but after finding out she had overspent her allowance, she demoted her. Cixi eventually grew more hostile to Zhen, and sent her to the \\"cold palace\\", a place reserved for consorts who fell out of the emperor's favour. As she firmly opposed the Guangxu Emperor's 1898 Hundred Days' Reform programme, Cixi had the emperor placed under house arrest in the Summer Palace. The Empress frequently spied on the Guangxu Emperor and reported his every action to Cixi. In 1900, during the Boxer Rebellion, the Empress fled with Cixi and the Guangxu Emperor to Xi'an when Beijing was occupied by the forces of the Eight-Nation Alliance. Upon their return, Zhen drowned in a well within the Forbidden City. Both Yu Deling and Katherine Carl, who spent time in Cixi's court following the Boxer Rebellion, recalled Empress Xiaodingjing as a gracious and pleasant figure.Der Ling, Princess Two Years in the Forbidden City, Dodd, Mead & Company 1929, pp. 18 & 146; retrieved 2 July 2013.Carl, Katherine A. With the Empress Dowager of China, The Century Co., 1907, pg. 77; accessed 2 July 2013. =Xuantong era= The Guangxu Emperor and Cixi died one day apart in 1908, after which Empress Xiaodingjing was promoted to Empress Dowager, with the honorable title Longyu, meaning \\"Auspicious and Prosperous\\". Immediately after the Guangxu Emperor's death, Cixi appointed Puyi, a nephew of the Guangxu Emperor, as the new emperor. As Empress Dowager Longyu did not have any children with the Guangxu Emperor, she adopted the infant Puyi as her child. Although Cixi had decreed before her death that the Qing imperial court would never again allow women to serve as regents, Longyu remained the leading figure in the Qing government and was consulted on all major decisions. But because she was inexperienced in politics, in the first few years of Puyi's reign, the emperor's biological father, Zaifeng (Prince Chun), served as Puyi's regent alongside General Yuan Shikai. On Yuan Shikai's advice in the fall of 1911, Empress Dowager Longyu agreed to sign an abdication on behalf of five-year-old Puyi. She agreed only if the imperial family were allowed to keep its titles. Other agreements were these: * The imperial family could keep their possessions. * They could stay in the Forbidden City temporarily, then would eventually move to the Summer Palace. * They would receive an annual stipend of four million silver taels. * The imperial mausoleums would be protected and looked after. * The new government would pay for the Guangxu Emperor's funeral and the construction of his tomb. =Republican era= Empress Dowager Longyu's funeral procession at Tiananmen in 1913. The Qing dynasty came to an end in 1912 and was replaced by the Republic of China. Within a few months after the fall of the Qing dynasty, on 22 February 1913, Empress Dowager Longyu died in Beijing after an illness. She was 45 years old, and was the only Chinese empress whose coffin was transported from the Forbidden City to her tomb by train. At her funeral, the Vice President of the Republic of China, Li Yuanhong, praised her for being \\"most excellent among women\\". She was buried in the Chong Mausoleum of the Western Qing tombs with the Guangxu Emperor.

The music's history and performance in the Czech lands, however, make it more than simple example of mimesis. The American genre and style have been absorbed and transformed in the Czech context to produce a spectrum of uniquely local phenomena. These musical compositions still bear enough relation to their inspiration to merit the \\"bluegrass\\" name. Czech Bluegrass can be considered with respect to ideas of transculturation, appropriation, traditionalism, and \\"world\\" music. Background Czech interest in things American dates to the nineteenth century, and is suffused with luminous conceptions of the Old West, cowboys, American Indians and other iconic images. Czech Tramping emerged as its main vector after 1918 in the newly formed Czechoslovak Republic. Tramping in this sense is a Czech-specific blend of ideas taken from Scouting, the German wandervogels, and Americanist romanticism. The music that accompanied the movement (tramp music) was a blend of Czech folklore, early jazz and other \\"syncopated music\\", such as barbershop, harmony singing, and popular songs from the U.S., France, and elsewhere. Czech tramping enthusiasts quickly incorporated the sounds and \\"style\\" of Bluegrass when they first heard this music in the late 1940s. First generation Many Czech bluegrass \\"old-timers\\" date their involvement with something specifically bluegrass-like to the post-war years, a lean time for the music, but one that contains important developments. Information and inspiration for the music reached Czechs through unlikely means. When Czechs tuned into Armed Forces Network radio programs from US military installations in Munich, they were flooded with a wealth of American music that they were able to freely use for their own ends. Tramping's song repertory was soon augmented with tunes learned from the likes of Bill Monroe, Johnny Cash, Jimmie Rodgers and others. Instruments were often an obstacle, especially the still largely unknown banjo. The few musicians who tried to get by on tenor banjo and guitar banjo had little to inform their attempts at emulating what they heard on the radio, until Pete Seeger's 1964 Prague concert. Banjoist Marko ƒåermak was able to build the first Czech five-string banjo from photographs taken at this event. Soon after he started presenting this new style and instrument in performances with the group Greenhorns (Zelen√°ƒçi). This first generation of players (which also includes Rangers and Taxmeni) inspired many Czechs to take up distinctly bluegrass-like music, necessitating cottage industries and then actual businesses to support this community with written materials, recordings, and of course, instruments. Czechs were in many ways isolated from sources of American bluegrass, but still were able to stay informed, though not without some difficulty. Paradoxically the 1968 Soviet invasion helped Bluegrass in the Czech lands. It scattered many Czechs into exile, whence they were able to send books, recordings, and other materials back home. The first (and now longest-running) Bluegrass festival in Europe began its history in 1972 in Kopidlno, only seven years after Carlton Haney introduced the concept with his Roanoke (VA) Bluegrass Festival of 1965. Second generation: The progressive impulse When recordings by the band New Grass Revival starting spreading through the Czech bluegrass community in the 1970s-80s, interest was sparked in the progressive possibilities of this music. The band Poutn√≠ci are a Brno-based group that included in their repertory bluegrass standards translated into Czech, newly composed and more folk-like songs, as well as classical instrumentals adapted for bluegrass instrumentation. They also sing almost entirely in the Czech language, making their music more accessible to wider audiences in their own country. This group continues to play today, with almost entirely new personnel. Lead singer and songwriter Robert K≈ôes≈•an has become one of the most well-regarded Czech \\"folk\\" singer-songwriters, and has continued his trajectory away from the core of bluegrass with his band Druh√° Tr√°va, who are best known in the U.S. for their collaboration with former Bluegrass Boy Peter Rowan. Mandolinist/Fiddler Ji≈ô√≠ Plocek left Poutn√≠ci to found the band Teagrass and has created an exciting performance idiom that includes elements of more traditionalist bluegrass, jazz, klezmer, Moravian folk music, and other regional traditionalist genres. Petr K≈Øs is another notable composer/bandleader known more for the poetics of his texts than for his solid mandolin chops. Like K≈ôes≈•an, he moved from emulative beginnings to a style that is less indebted to Bluegrass, though his band has always maintained the traditional bluegrass instrumental lineup and a lot of its musical affect. (Neo-)Traditionalism The bluegrass boom in the years following the 1989 velvet revolution was an expansion that attempted to fill the realm of possibilities Czechs enjoyed after being freed from the constrictions of state socialism. Druh√° Tr√°va toured the U.S., and American artists were more able to perform in the newly forged (as of 1993) Czech Republic and its counterpart, Slovakia. This bubble didn't last, however. Druh√° Tr√°va and Poutn√≠ci as well as some other hybridizing groups still perform successfully, but are not part of active musical development. In the last decade enthusiasts in the Czech Republic‚Äîfollowing trends in the U.S. community‚Äîhave nurtured a strong interest in the traditionalist forms of the music. Groups like Reli√©f, Bluegrass Cwrkot, Petr Brandejs Band, Roll's Boys, Dessert, and many more fit into this category. They all perform aspects of bluegrass drawn from work by American musicians of the early days of the genre, including Bill Monroe, Flatt and Scruggs, Jimmy Martin, and all the usual suspects. Current scene The range of \\"bluegrass\\" expressions in the Czech Republic is wide. All the streams of emulation and innovation persist, serving different needs and sub- communities. An interesting current phenomenon is the growing streams of bluegrass music and materials that are exported from the country. Czech bluegrass bands of the more traditionalist variety tour to some degree in the U.S., but find it more practical to limit their travel to Europe, where they are known for their masterful instrumental and vocal performance. Czech luthiers have built a reputation for their fine craftsmanship and quality instruments. Makers such as Ji≈ôi Lebeda, Ondra Holoubek, and Eduard Krist≈Øfek produce guitars, mandolins, and dobros that are known and purchased worldwide. Most significantly, perhaps, are the metal parts produced by banjo-makers Jaroslav Pr≈Øcha, L√°ƒèa Pt√°ƒçek, and Pavel Kri≈°t≈Øfek, which are used throughout the world, most notably by Gibson and other established U.S. makers.

Radio On radio, he was a writer for Red Skelton, Bob Hope and the situation comedy, Tommy Riggs and Betty Lou (1938‚Äì46), in which Riggs switched back and forth from his natural baritone to the voice of a seven-year-old girl. Television Continuing to write for Skelton and Hope as he moved into television, Douglas also wrote for Jimmy Durante, Bing Crosby, Woody Allen, Johnny Carson, The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet, The Jack Paar Show, The George Gobel Show and Laugh-In. The producer of Laugh-In, George Schlatter, said, \\"He saw the world from a different angle than the rest of us. He was not only funny, he was nice.\\" He was best known for his frequent guest appearances on Jack Paar's shows of the late 1950s and early 1960s. On one such appearance, when Douglas was well established as a Paar guest, he was chastised by Paar for holding a stack of file cards with his jokes while talking with Paar. When Paar returned to television in 1973 and was confronted by unexpected low ratings, he engaged Douglas to contribute monologue material by mail.

As the daughter of Duke Paul Frederick Augustus of Oldenburg (later Grand Duke of Oldenburg) and Princess Adelheid of Anhalt-Bernburg-Schaumburg-Hoym. She was born a Duchess of Oldenburg, though that title was never used in Greece. When she arrived in Greece in 1837, she at first won the hearts of the Greeks with her refreshing beauty. After the Queen became more politically involved, however, she became the target of harsh attacks ‚Äî and her image suffered further as she proved unable to provide an heir. She and her husband were expelled from Greece in 1862, after an uprising. She spent the rest of her years in exile in Bavaria. Early life Duchess Amalia Maria Frederica was born on 21 December 1818 in Oldenburg, capital of the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg. She was the first child of Duke Paul Frederick Augustus of Oldenburg (later Grand Duke of Oldenburg) and his first wife, Princess Adelheid of Anhalt-Bernburg-Schaumburg-Hoym. She was less than two years old when her mother died, on 13 September 1820. Marriage On 22 December 1836, Duchess Amalia of Oldenburg married King Otto of Greece in Oldenburg. Born as the second son of King Ludwig I of Bavaria, Prince Otto of Bavaria had been appointed king of the newly created Kingdom of Greece in 1833. Queen of Greece Entry of Otto and Amalia in Athens by Franz Wolff King Otto and Queen Amalia on a ride through Athens In the early years of the new monarchy, Queen Amalia, with her beauty and vivaciousness, brought a spirit of smart fashion and progress to the impoverished country. She laboured actively towards social improvement and the creation of gardens in Athens, and at first won the hearts of the Greeks with her refreshing beauty. The town of Amaliada in Elis, and the village of Amaliapolis in Magnesia, were named for the Queen. She was also the first to introduce the Christmas tree to Greece. =Political activity= As King Otto and his Bavarian advisers became more enmeshed in political struggles with Greek political forces, the Queen became more politically involved, also. She became the target of harsh attacks when she became involved in politics - and her image suffered further as she proved unable to provide an heir. She also remained a Protestant in an almost universally Orthodox country, throughout her husband's reign. Her Mistress of the Robes Baroness de Pluscow was widely rumored to influence state affairs, particularly in matters relating to Austria, through both the queen and the king, which exposed her to controversy: when the king and queen were deposed, it was reported in the press that all their courtiers were left unmolested with the exception of Pluscow, who was exposed to sarcasm from the crowd when she left.Marysville Daily Appeal, Number 14, 17 January 1863 =Fashion influence (Amalia dress)= Type of Amalia dress Amalia wearing Amalia dress When she arrived in Greece as a queen in 1837, she had an immediate impact on social life and fashion. She realized that her attire ought to emulate that of her new people, and so she created a romantic folksy court dress, which became a national Greek costume still known as the Amal√≠a dress. National Costume of Greece It follows the Biedermeier style, with a loose-fitting, white cotton or silk shirt, often decorated with lace at the neck and cuffs, over which a richly embroidered jacket or vest is worn, usually of dark blue or claret velvet. The skirt was ankle-length, unpressed-pleated silk, the color usually azure. It was completed with a soft cap or fez with a single, long, golden silk tassel, traditionally worn by married women, or with the kalpaki (a toque) of the unmarried woman, and sometimes with a black veil for church. This dress became the usual attire of all Christian townswomen in both Ottoman Empire-occupied and liberated Balkan lands as far north as Belgrade. =Assassination attempt= In February 1861, a university student named Aristeidis Dosios (son of politician Konstantinos Dosios)Brekis, Spyros, L Ph.D.; ŒäœÉœÑŒøœÅŒπŒ± œÑŒ∑œÇ ŒùŒµœâœÑŒ≠œÅŒ±œÇ ŒïŒªŒªŒ¨Œ¥ŒøœÇ (History of Modern Greece) (in Greek) (2003) unsuccessfully attempted to assassinate the Queen. He was sentenced to death, but the Queen intervened, and he was pardoned and sentenced to life imprisonment. He was hailed as a hero for his attempt by certain factions, but the attempt also provoked among the people spontaneous feelings of sympathy towards the royal couple. =Expulsion= The expulsion of King Otto and Queen Amalia in 1862, as portrayed in a popular colour lithography Just over a year later, an uprising took place in Athens while the royal couple were on a visit to the Peloponnese. The Great Powers, who had supported Otto, urged them not to resist, and Otto's reign came to an end. They left Greece aboard a British warship, with the Greek royal regalia that they had brought with them. It has been suggested that the King would not have been overthrown had Amalia borne an heir, as succession was also a major unresolved question at the time of uprising.John Van der Kiste, Kings of the Hellenes (Sutton Publishing, 1994) It is also true, however, that the Constitution of 1843 made provision for Otto to be succeeded by his two younger brothers and their descendants. Exile King Otto and Queen Amalia spent the rest of their years in exile, at home in Bavaria. They decided to speak Greek each day between 6 and 8 o'clock to remember their time in Greece. =Death= King Otto died in 1867. Queen Amalia survived her husband by almost eight years and died in Bamberg on 20 May 1875. She was buried beside the king at the Theatinerkirche in Munich. The cause of the royal couple's infertility remained contested even after an autopsy was performed on the queen.The infertility of the first royal couple of Greece (1833‚Äì1862) Titles * 21 December 1818 ‚Äì 20 May 1875: Her Highness Duchess Amalie of Oldenburg, Princess of Holstein-Gottorp * 22 December 1836 ‚Äì 23 October 1862: Her Majesty The Queen of Greece * 23 October 1862 ‚Äì 20 May 1875: Her Majesty Queen Amalia of Greece Ancestry References *Brekis, Spyros L.

Dunston had a population of 18,326 at the 2011 Census. History It has been speculated that Dunston started its existence as a farm or estate of a man named Dunn.https://englandsnortheast.co.uk/team-valley/ Historically part of County Durham, Dunston was first mentioned in 1328. Salmon fishing and farming were important industries in Dunston from at least the 14th century. Coal mining on a small-scale was also important but by the 17th century, the proximity of the river aided the development of large-scale coal mining in the village. During the Great Tyne Flood of 1771, villagers had to be rescued by boat from the roofs and upper stories of their houses.http://www.gateshead- history.com/dunston.html Area Dunston is served by Dunston railway station on the Tyne Valley Line. Dunston is split into two areas separated by the A1 dual carriageway. Much of the area south of the A1 is known as Dunston Hill. For electoral purposes, the northern section is grouped along with the Teams area to form Dunston and Teams ward, while the southern section is combined with parts of Whickham, forming Dunston Hill and Whickham East. To the west of Dunston is the site of Dunston Power Station, now demolished. The site is now home to Costco, with the MetroCentre (at this time the largest shopping and leisure complex in Europe), occupying the former site of the station's ash ponds. The Gateshead-based Go-Ahead Group has constructed a new bus depot to replace its Sunderland Road and Winlaton depots on the eastern part of the power station site. Another Dunston landmark was the Derwent Tower (commonly known as the \\"Dunston Rocket\\"), a tower block that was once the highest building in Gateshead. It was designed by the Owen Luder Partnership and completed in 1973.SINE Project: Derwent Tower A well-known structure that had appeared in two films, it was demolished in 2012. It had always proved unpopular with residents, and fallen into a poor condition: Gateshead Council decided that the renovation costs would be prohibitive. As of 2016, the remainder of the late 1960s Tower Court development was being gradually replaced by new housing and shops. Luder also designed the similarly maligned Trinity Centre Multi-Storey Car Park, (known for its appearance in the 1971 gangster thriller Get Carter, and now demolished), in Gateshead town centre. On 6 June 1993 the IRA attacked a gas holder in the nearby area of Low Team. The damage was limited, and no one was injured. Sports Dunston has one sports team which is association football club called Dunston UTS who currently play in the Northern Premier League Division One North West.  Dunston Staiths and the 1990 Garden Festival Dunston is particularly known for wooden coal staiths, first opened in 1893 as a structure for loading coal from the North Durham coalfield onto ships. In the 1920s, 140,000 tons of coal per week were loaded from the staiths, and they continued to be used until the 1970s. They were also a shipping point for coke produced at the nearby Norwood Coke Works, as well as pencil pitch manufactured at the Thomas Ness Tar Works using by-products from the Norwood plant and the Redheugh Gasworks. Throughout their working life, motive power for shunting wagons on the staiths and in their extensive sidings known as the Norwood Coal Yard came in the form of locomotives from Gateshead MPD. The staiths' output gradually declined with the contraction of the coal industry, and they were finally closed and partially dismantled in 1980. Now redundant, the railway lines leading to the staiths were lifted, finally allowing the demolition of several low bridges that had become a nuisance to bus operators by limiting the routes available to double-deckers in the area. For many years, the men who worked on the staiths, known as teemers (the men who released the coal from the wagons and operated the loading chutes and conveyors) and trimmers (who had the dangerous job of ensuring the stability of the colliers by levelling the load in their holds as they were filled), had their own room in the nearby Dunston Excelsior Club. For anyone not employed in the club or on the staiths, access to the room was strictly by invite only, and the staithesmen held a reputation for unceremoniously ejecting anyone who fell foul of this rule. Dunston, 1971 The staiths was restored and opened to the public as part of the Gateshead Garden Festival in 1990, following similar events in Liverpool (1984), Stoke-on-Trent (1986) and Glasgow (1988). The Garden Festival was divided into five zones, Norwood, Eslington, The Boulevard, Dunston and Riverside. It was spread over a large area of Dunston and the lower Team Valley, formerly occupied by heavy industries. Though other parts of the Garden Festival site, such as Dunston, (the site of the Norwood Coal Yard), Eslington, (the site of the tar works), and Norwood, (the site of the coke ovens) in the Team Valley, gained an immediate spur for regeneration, The Boulevard was left as a green space. Riverside, which was centred around the staiths and the site of the former gasworks, was derelict and inaccessible for the remainder of the 1990s, although parts of the site have now been developed into new housing. alt= The staiths are reputed to be the largest wooden structure in Europe,Sitelines archaeology project: Dunston Staiths and are protected as a Listed Building and a Scheduled Ancient Monument. In 2002, work began on a development of riverside apartments and houses designed by Wayne Hemingway. Known as Staiths South Bank, this development celebrates the area's heritage as well as improving the setting for the historic structure. In the early hours of 20 November 2003, a section of the staiths was destroyed by fire. As a result, access onto the Staiths themselves is not possible, but the structure can be viewed from the new riverside walkway, constructed as part of the Staiths South Bank development. In 2005 Gateshead Council commissioned a study into possible options for the Staiths' restoration. The Staiths suffered further fire damage in July 2010. Following the award of a Heritage Lottery Fund grant of almost ¬£420,000, restoration of the structure is expected to begin in the near future. It suffered further fire damage on 16 May 2020.

It was first discovered in 1893 by August Bischler and , in affiliation with Basle Chemical Works and the University of Zurich. The reaction is most notably used in the synthesis of dihydroisoquinolines, which can be subsequently oxidized to isoquinolines. A general scheme of the Bischler-Napieralski reaction. Mechanisms :A mechanism for the Bischler- Napieralski reaction involving an imine-ester intermediate. :A mechanism for the Bischler-Napieralski reaction involving a nitrilium intermediate. Two types of mechanisms have appeared in the literature for the Bischler‚ÄìNapieralski reaction. Mechanism I involves a dichlorophosphoryl imine-ester intermediate, while Mechanism II involves a nitrilium ion intermediate (both shown in brackets). This mechanistic variance stems from the ambiguity over the timing for the elimination of the carbonyl oxygen in the starting amide. In Mechanism I, the elimination occurs with imine formation after cyclization; while in Mechanism II, the elimination yields the nitrilium intermediate prior to cyclization. Currently, it is believed that reaction conditions affect the prevalence of one mechanism over the other (see reaction conditions). In certain literature, Mechanism II is augmented with the formation of an imidoyl chloride intermediate produced by the substitution of chloride for the Lewis acid group just prior to the nitrilium ion. Because the dihydroisoquinoline nitrogen is basic, neutralization is necessary to obtain the deprotonated product. General reaction reagents and conditions The Bischler‚ÄìNapieralski reaction is carried out in refluxing acidic conditions and requires a dehydrating agent. Phosphoryl chloride (POCl3) is widely used and cited for this purpose. Additionally, SnCl4 and BF3 etherate have been used with phenethylamides, while Tf2O and polyphosphoric acid (PPA) have been used with phenethylcarbamates. For reactants lacking electron- donating groups on the benzene ring, phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5) in refluxing POCl3 is most effective. Depending on the dehydrating reagent used, the reaction temperature varies from room temperature to 100 ¬∞C. Related reactions Several reactions that are related to the Bischler‚ÄìNapieralski reaction are known. In the Morgan‚ÄìWalls reaction, the linker between the aromatic ring and the amide nitrogen is an ortho-substituted aromatic ring. This N-acyl 2-aminobiphenyl cyclizes to form a phenanthridine. The Pictet‚ÄìSpengler reaction proceeds from a Œ≤-arylamine via condensation with an aldehyde. These two components form an imine, which then cyclizes to form a tetrahydroisoquinoline. =Pictet‚ÄìGams reaction= The Pictet‚ÄìGams reaction proceeds from an Œ≤-hydroxy-Œ≤-phenethylamide. It involves an additional dehydration under the same conditions as the cyclization, giving an isoquinoline. As with the Bischler‚ÄìNapieralski reaction, the Pictet‚ÄìGams reaction requires a strongly dehydrating Lewis acid, such as phosphoryl chloride or phosphorus pentoxide. Pictet‚ÄìGams reaction  Structural effects and alternate products  There are documented variations on the Bischler‚ÄìNapieralski reaction whose products differ in virtue of either the structure of the initial reactant, the tailoring of reaction conditions, or both. For example, research done by Doi and colleagues suggests that the presence or absence of electron-donating groups on the aryl portion of Œ≤-arylethylamides and the ratio of dehydrating reagents influence the patterns of ring closure via electrophilic aromatic substitution, leading to two possible products (see below). Other research on the variations on the Bischler-Napieralski Reaction have investigated the effects of nitro and acetal aryl groups on product formation (see references). :ipso carbon on the phenyl ring to yield a spiro intermediate.

He is best known for editing the (139 BC) Huainanzi compendium of Daoist, Confucianist, Buddhist and Legalist teachings and for supposedly inventing tofu. Early texts represent Liu An in three ways: the \\"author-editor of a respected philosophical symposium\\", the \\"bumbling rebel who took his life to avoid arrest\\", and the successful Daoist adept who transformed into a xian and \\"rose into the air to escape prosecution for trumped-up charges of treason and flew to eternal life.\\"Wallacker, p. 36.  Life  He was the grandson of Liu Bang, the founding emperor of the Han Dynasty. After his father died, he became the Prince of Huainan, the lands south of the Huai River, at the age of 16. Liu An had two sons. The younger was Liu Qian (ÂàòËøÅ), who was born by his princess consort and thus became heir to Huainan, while the elder, Liu Buhai (Âàò‰∏çÂÆ≥), was born to a concubine. Liu An favoured Liu Qian over Liu Buhai and never viewed the latter as his son. Liu Qian never regarded Liu Buhai as his elder brother. According to Tui'en Ling (Êé®ÊÅ©‰ª§, Order to Expand Favours), Liu Buhai could become a marquess if Liu An carved a part of Huainan for him as his fief, but Liu An never did. Liu Jian (ÂàòÂª∫), son of Liu Buhai, having realized that both he and his father had little chance to be a marquess, became so resentful that he accused Liu An and Liu Qian of a coup attempt. Finally, in a fate similar to his father, Liu An committed suicide in 122 BC after his plot was revealed. Literature Noted for his literary ability, Liu An was reputed to be able to compose an elaborate work of prose between waking and finishing breakfast. In addition to composing literary pieces himself, Liu An also frequently invited other scholars as guests to his estate. Eight of these scholars in particular became known as the Eight Immortals of Huainan (Ê∑ÆÂçóÂÖ´‰ªô). =Huainanzi= Together with the Eight Immortals of Huainan and/or other members his literary circle, Liu An published a treatise in 139 BC. known as the Huainanzi, translated as \\"Book of the Master of Huainan\\", or the \\"Huainan Philosophers\\". This book is considered one of the cornerstones of Taoist philosophy, along with the works of Laozi and Zhuangzi. Along with the earlier ShuJing (Classic of History) of the 5th century BC (Warring States era), this book provided further concrete information on geography, including descriptions of the topography of China. His book was also concerned with mathematics and music, making use of the \\"Pythagorean comma\\" and listing the first known Chinese 12 tone musical tuning. =Chu ci= One of the two major ancient Chinese poetry collections was the Chu ci, also known as The Songs of the South or The Songs of Chu (the other being the Shijing). The seminal poem of the collection is the \\"Li Sao\\", generally agreed to be by Qu Yuan. Liu An wrote an introduction to the \\"Li Sao\\" as well as the first known commentary. There is also reasonable evidence that Liu An was the first editor and anthologist of the original Chu ci collection. The poem \\"Zhao yin shi\\" (Summons for a Recluse\\") is attributed to him and \\"Yuan You\\" (\\"Far-off Journey\\") shows many similarities to the work of the literary circle around Liu An.Hawkes, 243 and 191-193  Legend of inventing soy milk  According to the legend, Liu An developed soy milk for his old, ill mother. She wanted to taste soybeans but couldn't chew, so Liu An ground the soybeans into milk, apparently upon her suggestion. No historical evidence supports the legend. In the Ming Dynasty reference work Bencao Gangmu, author Li Shizhen describes the development of bean curd but does not mention a particular inventor. The attribution of the invention of tofu to Liu An was also made by another Ming dynasty writer, Li Yi (ÊùéÁøä).ÊàíÂ∫µËÄÅ‰∫∫Êº´Á≠Ü„ÄåË±ÜËÖêËµ∑ÊñºÊ∑ÆÂçóÁéãÂäâÂÆâ‰πãË°ì„ÄÇ„Äç During the Song dynasty in the 10th century, Zhu Xi had already written of the method of Huainan in \\"Song of Bean Curd\\" (\\"Ë±ÜËÖêË©©\\").„ÄåÁ®ÆË±ÜË±ÜËãóÁ®ÄÔºåÂäõÁ´≠ÂøÉÂ∑≤ËÖêÔºåÊó©Áü•Ê∑ÆÂçóË°ìÔºåÂÆâÂùêÁç≤Ê≥âÂ∏É„ÄÇ„Äç \\"Planting soybeans but the harvest was little, the body is tired and the mind is rotted, if the method of Huainan was known earlier (by me), (I) would be able to get a lot with just relaxing and sitting there.\\" It is also mentioned in a book which called bean curd \\"Lai Ki\\" in the Han dynasty, and the word appeared in an early Song dynasty writing.„ÄäË°åÁ•ûÁ†îÁ©∂„ÄãÂºï „ÄäÁ∂∫ÁøÅÊÜ∂Ê¢ÖÂ∫µÈõúË®ò„ÄãË®òË±ÜËÖêÊ•≠Ê∑ÆÂçóÁéãÂäâÂÆâ‰∫ëÔºö„Äå Áõ∏ÂÇ≥Ëæ≤ÊõÜ‰πùÊúàÂçÅ‰∫îÊó•ÔºåÁÇ∫Ê∑ÆÂçóÁéãÂäâÂÆâË™ïËæ∞ÔºåÂÖßÂú∞Ë±ÜËÖêÊ•≠ËÄÖÂùáÊñºÊú¨Êó•ËàâË°å‰πãÂÖ¨Á•≠ÔºåÁ•≠Áï¢ËÅöÈ§ê„ÄÇ„ÄçÂäâÂÆâÁÇ∫Ë•øÊº¢‰∫∫ÔºåÂÖ∑ËæØÊâçÔºåÂñÑÂ±¨ÊñáÔºåÂ•ΩËÆÄÊõ∏ÈºìÁê¥ÔºåÂ§©‰∏ãÊñπË°ì‰πãÂ£´Â§öÊ≠∏‰πãÔºåÂú®ÂÖ∂Âú®ÁôºÊòéË±ÜËÖêÊôÇÔºåËúÄ‰∫∫ÂêçÊõ∞„ÄåÈªéÁ•à„ÄçÔºåÊïÖÈô∏Ê∏∏Ë©©Êúâ„ÄåÊ¥óÈáúÁÖÆÈªéÁ•à„ÄçÂè•ÔºåÊÉü‰ΩïÊôÇÂêçÁÇ∫Ë±ÜËÖêÔºåÂâá‰∏çÂèØËÄÉ„ÄÇ Other Chinese sources discredit the Liu An invention theory, however, and state that Liu An lived with a lot of vegetarian monks and the method was taught by them.

Location  Abercwmboi is one of the last remaining villages in the Cynon Valley. It has retained its identity and not been developed as have many other Cynon Valley villages. As a result, is a close and friendly community. The village lies on the B4275 Cardiff Road - the old main route to Cardiff before the A4059 road was built - between Aberdare and Mountain Ash. It is the most south-easterly named settlement that, for postal reasons, is included in the town of Aberdare. Name Abercwmboi - earlier Abercynfoi, translated: 'mouth of the Cynfoi'. Cynfoi is the name of the stream. Aberconfoi Ycha/Issa 1570 were farms named after the stream that enters the Cynon river there. Before 1905 the village was named Capcoch (red cap). The primary school and local pub / inn still have the name. The remains of the original Cap Coch Inn, can be found on the mountainside, above the village. The first streets to be built in Cap Coch were, John Street, Jenkin Street, Mary Street, Margaret Street, Richard Street and William Street. The beginning of Park view terrace near to the school, was also built near this time. The village boasted two main chapels, both of which carried out their services through the medium of Welsh - Bethlehem and Bethesda Chapels, of John Street.Rhondda Cynon Taf Heritage Trail History Phurnacite smokeless fuel factory (1984) Abercwmboi Workmen's Hall Abercwmboi Workmen's Hall (paid for out of the miners' contributions) has been the base for many trips and events, with the miners taking their families on day trips, as a community. The hall has also been used as a cinema and a public house over the years. A yearly village carnival was held in the village. Every street would work on a 'float' and a theme. Then these floats would parade around the village and fete would follow in the local school. The winning float would then join the Aberdare carnival in the summer, and hope to win that parade. This tradition stopped in the 1980s. Abercwmboi and the closure of its Phurnacite factory feature in the book Among Others by Jo Walton There were large lakes near to the village which used to boast swans, etc. Lord Aberdare would ride around these lakes and catch swans, ducks, etc. Much of these lakes have since been removed. The largest was filled in by the 'Macleans tip', and factories have since been built upon this area - Showa, etc. Remains of the Abercwmboi colliery can still be seen on the mountainside above Bronallt Terrace and close to 'Peggy Pit's' house. Back in the 1940s the village boasted over 40 shops throughout the village, from Mr. Tom Jones' shop, to the Co-op, to Beynons shop etc. 'Parry's Bakery' was a famous bakery, found in Bronallt Terrace and was visited by hundreds of people from all over the Cynon Valley and beyond. The original Cap Coch primary school had to be demolished (1980-81) and a new school built on the site (after much campaigning by the mothers of the village). The old school's yard fell into a mine shaft and made the area unstable. The children as a result, had to travel by bus each day to attend the Aman school. The mothers of the village fought long and hard, and travelled to the Welsh Office in Cardiff, to have the school rebuilt, and for the area to be made safe. There are still many remains of Abercwmboi's industrial past. The levels behind Park view Terrace and the remains of the colliery behind Bronallt Terrace. The 'Brick works' in Aberaman (old Aldi site), would have employed many from the village, too. Pipes and bricks were made there. Also the Phurnacite lands are still evidence of the past of the village. This has since become a haven for wildlife in the area. Abercwmboi was also called 'Little Moscow' by many local people in the valleys during the 1920s miners' strike. Abercwmboi was hit badly, economically at this time and many of the miners left to look for work elsewhere. There was much fighting, etc., and the police and army were called in to help control the miners in Abercwmboi at this time.BBC Coal House Many people from the village were also involved in the choir conducted by 'Caradog' (the statue of him can be seen in Aberdare town centre). Many people went to London to the Crystal Palace with him and won major competitions. The village was mostly Welsh speaking until the 1900s. A Welsh language Baptist chapel, Bethesda remains open in 2016. The 1891 census shows that nearly all residents of the oldest streets John Street and Jenkin Street, were first-language Welsh speakers. Recently, there have been many Iron Age finds in the Abercwmboi area, proving the area has been inhabited for thousands of years. Although for postal reasons the village comes under the town of Aberdare, its telephone std code is 01443, the code for Pontypridd Exchange, not Aberdare's 01685. It is at the southern end of Aberdare Parish, therefore is a part of Aberdare.

The village developed from a number of small settlements along the west bank of Afon Cych, which flows into the River Teifi nearby, giving the village its name, meaning \\"mouth of the Cych\\". The village has two pubs, one of which brews its own beer, two chapels and a care farm. Description Abercych is a village in the parish and community of Manordeifi, Pembrokeshire, of fewer than 100 houses scattered mostly along the sides of a small lane that runs along the western slopes of the Cych valley. It is from the nearest town, Newcastle Emlyn. The Nags Head pub and microbrewery The village is rural with no industry except for a timber sawmill at the western end of the village. It has a village hall which hosts the Manordeifi Community Council meetings every other month, and two public houses: The Penrhiw Inn and The Nag's Head; the latter has its own microbrewery. There is a number of small 'cottage industries' in the village including the magazine Sacred Hoop. An annual dance festival has been held in the village since 2013. =Clynfyw= Clynfyw in 2005 Clynfyw (also recorded as Clynfiew) is a 16th-century mansion rebuilt in the 18th century, It was owned by David Lloyd of Clement's Inn, London, who sold it to David Llewelin of Penalltcych, Clydey, in 1685. Llewelin's grandson, Owen Davies of Westminster, sold the estate in 1753 to Thomas Lewis of Llwyngrawys, Llangoedmor, Cardiganshire. The large Clynfiew collection of estate records from 1542 to 1916 is lodged at the National Library of Wales. Since the mid-1980s Clynvyw has been a Community interest company care farm registered with Care Inspectorate Wales. The farm has eight live-in staff and up to 40 day-students working on practical projects. In 2020, the manager, Jim Bowen, whose family have run the farm since the 18th century, accepted a Queen's Award for Enterprise from the Prince of Wales, its second such award. History Abercych is an ancient settlement, the Welsh placename of which means 'the mouth of the Afon Cych', referring to where the Cych joins the River Teifi. The earliest recorded settlement was a forge, now no longer in existence. The linear nature of the present village arose from the joining up of several discrete settlements: Pont Hercws, Forge Cych, Penrhiw, Pont Treseli and Abercych itself. There were about 30 houses in the 1840s. Worship The village has two chapels: Ramoth Baptist Chapel (built 1827), and Bryn Sion Independent Chapel (built 1831). Folklore The Cych is a small river, which is connected with the realm of Annwn in the ancient Welsh tale of Pwyll Pendefig Dyfed, the first of the Four Branches of the Mabinogi. There are several places on the upper reaches of the Cych that are seen as an entry point to the 'other worlds' (fairy realms), and there are some folk tales told by some local people about the magical nature of river and the valley.

The C‚ÄîO‚ÄîC (carbon-oxygen-carbon) in the center is the ether group and the Cl (chlorine) and F (fluorine) are the halogen atoms, which have been substituted for all but two H (hydrogen) atoms. A halogenated ether is a subcategory of a larger group of chemicals known as ethers. An ether is an organic chemical that contains an ether group -- an oxygen atom connected to two (substituted) alkyl groups. A good example of an ether is the solvent diethyl ether. What differentiates a halogenated ether from other types of ethers is the substitution (halogenation) of one or more hydrogen atoms with a halogen atom. Halogen atoms include fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine. Perhaps the most common use of halogenated ethers has been in anesthesiology. The first widely used inhalation anesthetic was diethyl ether, which is a non- substituted (non-halogenated) ether. This drug enabled surgeons to perform otherwise painful operations on patients after rendering them unconscious. Diethyl ether has the unfortunate disadvantage of being extremely flammable, especially in the presence of enriched oxygen mixtures. This property has resulted in many instances of fires and even explosions in operating rooms during surgery. This is among the most important reasons that diethyl ether has fallen out of favor as a general anesthetic. Diethyl ether is still commonly used as a solvent and reagent in organic chemistry laboratories, though with caution. Diethyl ether was initially replaced by non-flammable (but more toxic) halogenated hydrocarbons such as chloroform and trichloroethylene. Halothane is another halogenated hydrocarbon anesthetic agent which was introduced into clinical practice in 1956. Due to its ease of use and improved safety profile with respect to organ toxicity, halothane quickly replaced chloroform and trichloroethylene. All inhalation anesthetics in current clinical use are halogenated ethers, except for halothane (which is a halogenated hydrocarbon or haloalkane), nitrous oxide, and xenon. Halogenated ethers have the advantages of being non-flammable as well as less toxic than earlier general anesthetics. Halogenated ethers differ from other ethers because they contain at least one halogen atom in each molecule. Examples of halogenated ethers include the general anesthetics isoflurane, desflurane, and sevoflurane. However, not all halogenated ethers have anesthetic effects, and some compounds such as flurothyl do the opposite and have stimulant and convulsant effects. Inhalation anesthetics are vaporized and mixed with other gases prior to their inhalation by the patient before or during surgery. These other gases always include oxygen or air, but may also include other gases such as nitrous oxide or helium. In most surgical situations, other drugs such as opiates are used for pain and skeletal muscle relaxants are used to cause temporary paralysis. Additional drugs such as midazolam may be used to produce amnesia during surgery. Although newer intravenous anesthetics (such as propofol) have increased the options of anesthesiologists, halogenated ethers remain a mainstay of general anesthesia.

Situated in Rockland, Victoria, the museum occupies a building complex; made up of the Spencer Mansion, and the Exhibition Galleries. The former building component was built in 1889, while the latter component was erected in the mid-20th century. The institution was established in 1946 as the Little Centre in downtown Victoria. In 1951, the institution was gifted the Spencer Mansion in the neighbourhood of Rockland, and moved into the building in the same year. The institution was renamed the Art Gallery of Greater Victoria when it opened at the Spencer Mansion. From 1955 to 1978, the museum underwent a series of expansions to the building in order to expand the viewing space of its building. Its collection works from Canadian artists, indigenous Canadian artists, and other artists from across the Pacific Rim. The museum has also organized and hosted a number of travelling arts exhibitions. The Art Gallery of Greater Victoria has the largest collection of works out of any art museum in British Columbia, with approximately 20,000 works in its permanent collection. History The art museum was established by former members of the Vancouver Island branch of the Federation of Canadian Artists, and other members of the local arts community in 1946 as the Little Centre. The Little Centre operated at a former car dealership in downtown Victoria from 1946 to 1951. In 1951, the museum moved into the Spencer Mansion, which was donated to the institution in the same year by Sarah Spencer. The institution was renamed the Art Gallery of Greater Victoria when it reopened at the Spencer Mansion. While the building has been used as an art museum since 1951, it continued to serve as a residence for the building's caretakers through the 1960s. Shortly after moving into the Spencer Mansion, the museum undertook a series of renovations and expansions, constructing an expansion wing known as the Exhibition Galleries. The Exhibition Galleries were built in several phases, with the first gallery in the building expansion opened in 1958, and the last opened in 1978. In 2012, the museum announced it was looking for architects to design its expansion of the Exhibition Galleries. In 2015, the municipal government approved the expansion, which included an additional of exhibition space, as well as the construction of a new cafe, and lecture hall. Construction was originally planned to begin in late 2019, although rising materials and construction costs led to the development to be postponed. The museum announced plans to begin construction for the expansion in 2020. The museum plans to close its building during construction, and exhibit its collection at off-site locations throughout Victoria. Architecture The museum's building is made up of two components, a late‚Äì19th century residence, and a mid‚Äì20th century expansion wing The building of the Art Gallery of Greater Victoria is made up of two components, the Spencer Mansion, and the Exhibition Galleries. The former is a re-purposed Victorian style residence built in 1889, whereas the latter is a modernist style expansion wing of seven galleries, built in phases from the 1950s to 1978. The combined museum building takes up of space. =Spencer Mansion= The Spencer Mansion was built in 1889, and was designed by William Ridgeway Wilson. The Spencer Mansion was once a part of a larger property, originally stretching from Fort Street to Rockland Avenue; incorporating a garden, two tennis courts, stables and a coach house. The Spencer Mansion had a belvedere, with a view of the ocean. The Victorian era home was originally built for the Green family, who named the building Gyppeswyk, the Old English name for Ipswich. When Cary Castle, the original Government House, was destroyed by fire in 1903, Gyppeswyck served briefly as the residence of the Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia. The building was donated in 1951 by Sarah Spencer to the institution that became the Art Gallery of Greater Victoria. The exterior of the building has been painted in several different colour schemes since its construction. In 1975 it was painted cream in order to coordinate with the brick used for one of the Exhibition Galleries. The building was re-painted back to its original colour scheme of dark red, dark green, and pale salmon in 2004. The original colour scheme was ascertained after peeling through the building's 15 layers of paint. The building's eastern facade, and portions of the northern facade were largely destroyed with the construction of the first galleries of the Exhibition Galleries during the 1950s. The loss of the porte-coch√®re, and the installation of a north-side glass-enclosed staircase during the construction of the Exhibition Galleries makes Spencer Mansion inadmissible for designation as a heritage building. Works showcased in the Spencer Mansion, a historic building that forms a part of the building complex. The interior of the building has undergone significant changes since its construction, either conducted by the museum, or by previous owners of the building. However, the building still retains a number of features from its original construction, including its original fireplace, ornate tiles and woodworking on the southeast corner of the second floor. In 2004, several renovation works undertaken on the building, including the reconstruction of the rooftop Palladian window, and providing a seismic retrofit to the building's chimney. The first floor of the Spencer Mansion houses the museum's gift shop, and art rental and sales office. The former bedrooms on the second floor serve as the museum\`s offices, and library, while the museum's archives are located in the building's attic. =Exhibition Galleries= Main entrance lobby, located within the Exhibition Galleries From 1955 to 1978, the museum expanded the building by constructing seven galleries in a modernist expansion wing adjacent to the eastern portion of the mansion, collectively known as the Exhibition Galleries. The first two fireproof galleries were opened in 1958 and 1959, and were known as the Centennial Galleries. Its namesake commemorates the centennial of the establishment of the Colony of British Columbia. The final renovations during this period occurred in 1978, which saw the renovation of two of its larger exhibition galleries, as well as repairs to the Spencer Mansion. Renovations to the Exhibition Galleries were conducted from 2001 to 2003. Work on the Exhibition Galleries included the installation a new climate control system, enabling the museum to host travelling exhibitions that include works which need a climate controlled environment. Work on the museum's entrance at the Exhibition Galleries, and its corridors was also conducted during these renovations. Permanent collection As of September 2019, the museum has approximately 20,000 works in its permanent collection, providing the institution with the largest collection of works of any art museum in British Columbia. However, because of the limited size of the museum building, only five per cent of the permanent collection is able to be exhibited in the museum's exhibition galleries. Its collection is divided into a number of departments including Asian art, Canadian art, contemporary art, decorative art, and indigenous Canadian art. =Asian art= The museum's collection of Asian art is made up of approximately 8,000 works, comprising 40 per cent of the museum's total collection. With approximately 8,000 Asian works, the museum holds the second largest collection of Asian art in Canada, after the Royal Ontario Museum. While the collection of Asian works includes items from all over Asia (including South Asia, and Western Asia), the focus of the Asian collection is primarily on works from China, and Japan. The museum's collection of Chinese works is believed to have increased significantly in value in the first decades of the 21st century, due to China's economic growth, and renewed interests for art from that region. A Shinto shrine in the museum's Asian Garden The museum's collection of Asian art features old and new works, including bronze objects, ceramics, textiles, and amber and ivory carvings. The museum's Asian collection was started in 1973 by the museum's first director, Colin Graham. Two Japanese prints, acquired by the museum in the 1950s, were the first two items that formed the Asian collection. Other works from the exhibit includes a Chinese painting valued at C$6 million in 2016, and a Japanese by≈çbu created by Kan≈ç Sanraku. The by≈çbu features a depiction of a peacock displaying its plumage next to a pine tree, painted on a gold leaf. The by by≈çbu was donated to the museum in 1995, and was restored with cooperation from the Government of Japan for approximately C$150,000. The by≈çbu was valued at C$500,000 in 2016. The museum's outdoor Asian garden includes the only Meiji era Shinto shrine in North America.

In 1618 it became the parish church of both Aberdalgie and Dupplin, when the parishes united. It was designated a Category B-listed building in 1971. The T-plan church features two large centre round-arched windows and doors with circular windows on either side. In 1929 the church interior was given a major renovation by Sir R.S. Lorimer. Aberdalgie churchyard contains the family vault where numerous medieval Chiefs of Clan Oliphant including the first three Lords Oliphant are buried. Prominent among them is Sir William Oliphant, the resolute Governor of Stirling Castle when it was defended against Edward I of England in 1304, during the Wars of Scottish Independence. Sir William's son Walter married Elizabeth, daughter of Robert I and sister of David II. Other people buried here include the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Baron Forteviot and author Norma Octavia Lorimer (1863-1948). =Dupplin Castle= Dupplin Castle lies within the parish. The earliest known owner of the castle was Sir William Oliphant in the late 13th century. Dupplin was sold after some four hundred years by the 5th Lord Oliphant (who, per the diploma registered under the Great Seal, 10 March 1640, was also Lord Aberdalgie and Lord Dupplin) in 1623. The castle was destroyed in 1461 and rebuilt. It was again rebuilt in 1688, though retained its earlier tower and some remnants from the previous castle. A fire gutted the castle in 1827, prompting a full rebuilding and restoration. The current building is a house, completed in 1970.

(1999), Final Results of the Third Biennial National Organic Farmers‚Äô Survey, Santa Cruz, CA: Organic Farming Research Foundation. It is replaced in the west by Acalymma trivittatum, a duller species often with greyish or pale white elytra rather than yellow. Description The striped cucumber beetle is a small beetle approximately half a centimeter (1/5 inch) in length, and characterized by brown-yellow elytra completely covering the abdomen and longitudinally transversed by three thick black stripes. It superficially resembles the western corn rootworm (Diabrotica virgifera), another serious crop pest. However, the ventral abdominal surface of A. vittatum is black where that of D. virgifera are yellow, and the elytra of D. virgifera often do not extend the full length of the abdomen. Life cycle Large numbers of adults emerge from diapause in the spring to feed on the foliage, flowers, and pollen of cucurbit species. Between one and two generations of beetles can pass in a season depending on the region, with the final generation settling into another period of diapause to wait out the winter. Females will lay eggs on or in the immediate vicinity of the stem of a viable host plant, often a member of the genus Cucurbita. Eggs are a bright orange color and less than a millimeter in diameter. Eggs hatch after a short period and larvae feed on the roots of the plant. Agricultural Damage Feeding damage on a winter squash blossom Striped cucumber beetles can cause significant amounts of foliar damage to cucurbit crops, particularly to older plants, and larval root feeding also damages the plant. The most damage is often seen in the early part of the year during the emergence of overwintering beetles, but feeding damage continues throughout the entire growing season. Furthermore, adult beetles are one of two known vectors of the bacterial wilt Erwinia tracheiphila, an incurable and often fatal disease of cucurbits. Bacteria passes from the frass of the beetle into feeding wounds that reach into the vascular tissues of the plants, where they proliferate to the point of blocking the xylem. On Cucurbita sp. flower, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada Chemical attractants In Massachusetts, A. vittatum are attracted by several chemicals emitted by cucurbits, including 1,2,4-trimethoxybenzene and indole, though not (E)-cinnamaldehyde. In Illinois, A. vittatum was found to be attracted to indole and (E)-cinnamaldehyde, but not 1,2,4-trimethoxybenzene.Lewis, P. A., Lampman, R. L., and Metcalf, R. L. 1990. Kairomonal attractants for Acalymma vittatum (Coleoptera, Chrysomelidae). Environ. Entomol. 19:8‚Äì14. Control Techniques Grower tolerance for this beetle is very low, due in major part to the transmission of bacterial wilt. Unfortunately, effective control techniques beyond pesticides are few and far between. Research into nematode and other biological control agents continues today. Another possibility is the planting of trap crops (crops that the beetles prefer) around the perimeter of the main crop. The trap crop can then be treated with insecticide, reducing overall pesticide use. Some research indicates that striped cucumber beetle damage can be reduced by the use of vermicompost fertilizer compared to inorganic fertilizer. Researchers suggest that the mechanism by which vermicompost reduces beetle damage is due to an increase in phenolic compounds in plants grown with vermicompost. The application of Paecilomyces fumosoroseus to a trap crop is an effective means of controlling the beetle. Brave new world: recent evolution of an insect- transmitted pathogen a seminar given by Dr. Roberto Kolter Cucumber beetles and Cucurbitacin A. vittatum, along with other cucurbit-feeding beetles in the genus Diabrotica, are induced to feeding behavior by a class of plant secondary compounds called cucurbitacins, widespread in members of the family Cucurbitaceae. These extremely bitter chemicals are hypothesized to have evolved as a plant feeding defense, but have been co-opted by the beetles into a kairomonal feeding attractant. Beetles are capable of consuming amounts of cucurbitacins that would kill other organisms, and some work has indicated that the beetle may sequester the compounds in their elytra to deter predation.

He said that this was the only way to achieve some rhythms.  Etymology  The word derives from the Greek words ŒæŒ≠ŒΩŒøœÇ (xenos), strange or alien, and œáœÅœåŒΩŒøœÇ (chronos), time.  Examples  One of the most prominent examples of xenochrony can be found on Zappa's rock opera Joe's Garage (1979), on which the guitar solos are all xenochronous (with the exceptions of \\"Watermelon in Easter Hay\\" and \\"Crew Slut\\"). In the words of Zappa himself: > A classic \\"Xenochrony\\" piece would be \\"Rubber Shirt\\", which is a song on the > Sheik Yerbouti album. It takes a drum set part that was added to a song at > one tempo. The drummer was instructed to play along with this one particular > thing in a certain time signature, eleven-four, and that drum set part was > extracted like a little piece of DNA from that master tape and put over here > into this little cubicle. And then the bass part, which was designed to play > along with another song at another speed, another rate in another time > signature, four-four, that was removed from that master tape and put over > here, and then the two were sandwiched together. And so the musical result > is the result of two musicians, who were never in the same room at the same > time, playing at two different rates in two different moods for two > different purposes, when blended together, yielding a third result which is > musical and synchronizes in a strange way. That's Xenochrony. And I've done > that on a number of tracks. Xenochrony can be heard as early on in Zappa's career as 1967: on The Mothers of Invention's We're Only in It for the Money, the rhythm track from the chorus line of \\"How Could I Be Such A Fool\\" on Freak Out! (which consists of the drums, bass, vibraphone and orchestra) is used on the ending of \\"Lonely Little Girl.\\" This is noticeable when listening to the backing tracks without vocals, which appear on the posthumous box set releases The MOFO Project/Object and Lumpy Money. On Uncle Meat, a phrase from the guitar solo of \\"Nine Types of Industrial Pollution\\" appears later on at the end of \\"Sleeping in a Jar\\". Several earlier possible examples of xenochrony can be heard on Lumpy Gravy, Zappa's first solo album. A passage from \\"Harry, You're a Beast\\" may or may not be incorporated in \\"Almost Chinese\\": a harpsichord/xylophone sounding instruments plus several \\"snorks\\" can be heard directly after Larry's dialogue with Motorhead Sherwood. Also, the sound effect that begins \\"Flower Punk\\" from We're Only in It for the Money, released months earlier, is played at approximately 0:19 of Part 2, 15:19 or 15:20 of the record. Excerpts from \\"The World's Greatest Sinner\\" soundtrack, composed by Zappa, are audible on both \\"I Don't Know If I can Go Through This Again\\" (from Lumpy Gravy) and \\"Mother People\\" (from We're Only in It for the Money). Simon & Garfunkel also used this technique on their 1968 Bookends album. The second track on the album, \\"Save the Life of My Child.\\" uses the first few seconds of \\"The Sound Of Silence\\" (released on their 1966 Sounds of Silence album) around the 1:20 mark in a slowed-down fashion. Another example is the King Crimson song \\"The Devil's Triangle\\", on their 1970 album In the Wake of Poseidon, which uses elements of \\"The Court of the Crimson King\\" near the end. Other examples are the albums from avant-garde guitarist Buckethead, Forensic Follies and Needle in a Slunk Stack, released in 2009: both featured songs from several Buckethead albums to make new songs. The technique was used by Dream Theater at the beginning of the song \\"The Dance of Eternity\\", where samples from their earlier song \\"Metropolis Pt. 1\\" briefly fade in and out against a slower drum and bass beat. Car Seat Headrest used the technique on the 2010 album \\"3,\\" albeit in a unique way; the song \\"Beach Drugs\\" (Track 10) prominently features a reversed version of \\"Sun Hot\\" (Track 6) in its outro. This reversed version of \\"Sun Hot\\" was later released on the compilation \\"Little Pieces of Paper With 'No' Written on Them\\" as \\"Hot Sun.\\"  See also  * Polyrhythm  References   External links  *Discussion of Zappa studio techniques including Xenochrony Category:Frank Zappa Category:Music production Category:Sampling (music) ","title":"Xenochrony"},{"id":"2589255","text":"Kevin Young may refer to: *Kevin Young (athlete) (born 1966), American athlete, world record holder in the 400 metres hurdles *Kevin Young (baseball) (born 1969), American baseball player *Kevin Young (basketball, born 1981), American basketball coach *Kevin Young (basketball, born 1990), Puerto Rican- American basketball player *Kevin Young (footballer) (born 1961), English footballer *Kevin Young (ice hockey) (born 1982), Canadian professional ice hockey player *Kevin Young (poet) (born 1970), American poet *Kevin Young, singer of Disciple (band) ","title":"Kevin Young"},{"id":"2589256","text":"Korean Air Flight 801 Memorial in Asan Asan () is a village located on the western shore of the United States territory of Guam. The municipality of Asan-Maina combines Asan with Maina, a community in the hills to the east. It was a primary landing site for United States Marines during Guam's liberation from the Japanese during World War II. Asan Beach Park is part of the War in the Pacific National Historic Park. Asan and Maina are located in the Luchan (Western) District. Etymology War in the Pacific National Historical Park, Asan, Guam Asan derives its name from the Chamorro word hassan meaning scarce or rare. One meaning of the word ma‚Äôina refers to an infant who, between the time of birth and baptism, is taken by the mother to Mass before sunrise. This old ritual was considered analogous to and in imitation of the Presentation of Jesus in the Temple. History On July 21, 1944 the Americans landed in Asan to recapture the island from occupying Japanese forces during the Battle of Guam. The 3rd Marine Division landed in Asan at 08:28, and the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade landed near Agat to the south. Japanese artillery sank 20 Landing Vehicle Trackeds, but by 09:00 tanks were ashore at both beaches. United States Marines fought Japanese forces fortified in the hills above the shore after establishing a beach head. During the following week, Americans pursued retreating Japanese forces northward and eventually won the battle. From April to November 1975 the former Camp Asan was used as a refugee camp for South Vietnamese refugees during Operation New Life. On August 6, 1997, Korean Air Flight 801 crashed on Nimitz Hill in Asan. A memorial was later constructed.http://ns.gov.gu/guam/indexmain.html\\"CBC66010_008.pdf.\\" U.S. Census Bureau.

The capital is Lanzhou, a city with a vibrant musical life, including many nightclubs. The daoqing folk tradition is an important part of the music of Gansu, especially in Huanxian; daoqing is also found in Yichi in Ningxia and Dingbian in Shaanxi. Daoqing is used to accompany shadow play theater. Daoqing comes from the Tang Dynasty and was originally a cappella Taoist music. Beginning with the Southern Song Dynasty, however, percussion instruments like the jianban and yugu have been used, and the lyrical themes have moved from Taoist parables to folktales. Other instruments used include gongs, cymbals, suona, dina (small suona), shuibangzi, flute, sixian, bangu and erhu. One of Gansu's most notable musicians in the West is Jie Ma, who blends her family's traditional pipa and ruan technique with more contemporary forms such as jazz, improvisation, fusion, and world music and lives in the United States.

Froines (born May 31, 1939) is an American chemist and anti-war activist. He is noted as a member of the Chicago Seven, a group charged with involvement with the riots at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Froines, who holds a Ph.D. in Chemistry from Yale, was charged with interstate travel for purposes of inciting a riot and with making incendiary devices. He and Lee Weiner were the only two defendants to be acquitted by the jury on both of the counts charged against them and contempt of court findings, which included those of Froines, by Judge Julius Hoffman were rejected in their entirety after an appeal. However, Froines' courtroom antics were mild compared to those of his other Chicago Seven co-defendants. While still waiting for acquittal in the early 1970s, Froines was on the faculty at Goddard College in Vermont, where he taught chemistry. In January 1990, it was reported that Froines had been named director of UCLA‚Äôs Occupational Health Center. He later served as the Director of Toxic Substances at the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration as well. Froines also served as chair of the California Scientific Review Panel on Toxic Air Contaminants for nearly 30 years before resigning in 2013 amid claims that he conducted independent research with the panel while maintaining ties to other scientists who disapproved of the chemicals he was evaluating, creating a conflict of interest. He retired in 2011 from the UCLA School of Public Health, in the Department of Environmental Health Sciences. References  Further reading  * Edited by Mark L. Levine, George C.

He was the eldest son of the Tangut ruler Li Deming.  Early background  After his father died in 1032, he became the leader of the Tangut.  Military campaigns  Early in his leadership, Jingzong banished the surname Zhao which had been given by the Song dynasty, replacing it with the surname Weiming (Chinese: Âµ¨Âêç, Tangut: ). He took an aggressive stance with the Song dynasty. At its height he claimed an army of 500,000 men. In 1034 Jingzong attacked the Huanqing territories. He captured Song general Qi Zongju. At this point he changed his target to the Uyghur peoples of the West, and his efforts against them began in 1036. From the Uyghurs he took large portions of Gansu, and the Tangut people would control the Hexi Corridor for 191 years before being conquered by the Mongol Yuan. In 1038 he declared himself the emperor of the Western Xia Dynasty whose capital was situated in Xingqing. Afterwards he launched a campaign against the Song. Although the Tangut empire won a series of three large battles, the victories proved to be very costly and they found their forces depleted, due in part to a scorched earth policy by the Song. In 1044 the Tangut Empire signed a treaty with the Song dynasty resulting in the nominal acknowledgment of Song sovereignty by the Tangut and the payment of tribute by the Song.  Culture and politics  The Emperor led to a reorganization of much of the Empire with the help of Chinese advisors. The Empire created new departments and administrative services. The Emperor also knew Chinese and had Chinese works translated into his people's language. He accomplished this by supporting the development of a written language for the Tangut people. However the Tangut script eventually went extinct after the Yuan conquest. Nevertheless, Emperor Jingzong had strong opposition to the people imitating the Song dynasty too closely. He emphasized the value of their traditional nomadic way of life and discouraged any dependence on Song luxury items. Trade with the Song was minimized or cut off before the peace treaty that came four years before his death. Although Li used talented Song workers, to retain his own power and dynasty, he did not want to be conquered by the Song dynasty. Later on the Tangut Li emperors would switch between multiple sides, Mongols, Jurchen Jin, and the Song in order to retain their power. Li's attacks weakened the Jin and Song dynasties to the extent that the Mongols would later be able to conquer China. For vacillating between multiple sides, colluding with Mongols and Jurchen, and launching attacks against the Song, Li Yuanhao is considered a traitor to the Chinese people. However, the Mongols ultimately crushed the Western Xia dynasty, destroyed nearly any vestige of the empire, and ended Li's reign in Ningxia. The Mongols would then reunify China under the Yuan dynasty.  Succession and death  In 1048, both the Prime Minister, Mozang Epang (Ê≤íËóèË®õÈæê), and Prince Ninglingge (ÂØß‰ª§Âì•) conspired to assassinate Jingzong. Prince Ninglingge attempted to kill Jingzong with a sword, but he only managed to slice off Jingzong's nose. Frightened by what he had done, Prince Ninglingge fled to Mozang for backup, but Mozang betrayed Ninglingge by turning him in as the assassin. Although Jingzong initially survived the assassination, he succumbed to his wounds a few days later.

It was built from to 1990s. It is also known as Executive Gardens and St Johns Church Reserve. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992. Queens Gardens are adjacent to the former Land Administration Building (now the Heritage Hotel of the Treasury Casino). On the opposite side of William Street is the Old State Library Building and on the opposite side of Elizabeth Street is the former Treasury Building (now the Treasury Casino). History As an early penal colony the site was originally home to a cottage, lumber yard, engineer's store and workshops. Queens Gardens was established in several stages between 1905 and 1962, on a site which has been associated both with the earliest phase of the penal settlement at Moreton Bay, and with the establishment of the Church of England in Queensland. During the convict era the engineer's weatherboard cottage stood on part of the site, at the corner of William and Elizabeth Streets. It appears to have been both the first house and the first sawn timber building to be erected in Brisbane Town. Occupying most of the remainder of the site was a lumber yard, erected c.1825, which contained the engineer's stores and workshops. By 1838 the lumber yard had been moved, and the cottage had been converted into offices. The section of the present park along George Street was part of the chaplain's garden from 1840 at least. In 1848 the site was acquired by the Church of England. A parsonage was constructed at the corner of William and Elizabeth Streets in 1850-51, and St John's Church was erected on the site, further along William Street, in 1850-54. In 1868 it was extended. A detached bell tower was erected in 1877, and in 1879-80 a building which served as church school, synod hall, library and committee rooms was built in the eastern corner of the site. In the 1880s the Church proclaimed the square a future cathedral site, and a new Church Institute and Synod Hall was erected in the northern corner of the square in 1897. Following church protests at the 1899 announcement of plans to erect a new lands and survey building adjacent to the pro-cathedral, the government offered to purchase the church square, and acquired it the same year. In 1901 the Church Institute building was occupied by the Police Department and later served as offices for the Criminal Investigation Branch. In 1904 the pro- cathedral, belltower, church school and parsonage were demolished and a , wide strip between William and George Streets, adjacent to the new Executive Building, was proclaimed as the Executive Gardens. Historic photo of the statue of Queen Victoria A bronze statue of Queen Victoria, a replica by English sculptor Thomas Brock of the original in Portsmouth, was erected in mid-1906. The purchase was arranged by local artist Godfrey Rivers, and was funded by public subscription and subsidies from state and local government. The pedestal was designed by the Public Works Department and crafted by local stonemason William Kitchen, at a cost of . The statue was an expression of Queensland's loyalty to the British Empire. On Empire Day veterans from the Crimean, Sudan and South African wars gathered in what became known as the Queens Gardens, which became also an assembly point for state occasions such as funeral or celebratory processions. The monument remains the only statue of Queen Victoria in Brisbane. In late 1906 the reserve was extended to an area of , with the inclusion of the site of the former parsonage. alt=In 1917 a Krupp 77mm field gun, captured from the German army in France in 1915 during World War I, was placed in the gardens. It was a gift from King George V and presented to Queensland by Lord Kitchener as a Trophy of British Valour on 18 August 1917, at the request of Thomas Joseph Ryan, lawyer, anti- conscriptionist and Queensland Labor Premier 1915-1919. A bronze statue of TJ Ryan, designed by Australian sculptor Bertram MacKennal and erected by public subscription, was unveiled in the gardens in 1925. The sandstone base was provided by the Brisbane City Council. In 1962 the CIB building at the northern corner of the site was demolished and the park was extended to occupy the entire square, with a total area of . A new layout for the gardens was prepared as a joint state and local government scheme in preparation for the visit of Queen Elizabeth II to Brisbane in March 1963. Brisbane City Council landscape architect, horticulturalist and author, Harry Oakman, was responsible for the design and landscaping, and architectural detailing was undertaken by Department of Works architect Graham De Gruchy. In 1990 the Queensland Service Women's Association erected a Monument of Memories in the park, honouring the 70,000 service women.  Description  Statue of Queen Victoria, 2005 Queens Gardens is a public park, square in plan, that is bounded by William, Elizabeth and George Streets on the southwestern, northwestern and northeastern sides and by the Lands Administration Building (now Heritage Hotel) on the southeastern edge. Located around the perimeter of the Gardens are a number of important government buildings including the Lands Administration Building, the Treasury Building (now the Treasury Casino), the Old State Library and the Family Services Building.TJ Ryan statue, 2005 Trophy of British Valour, 2018Monument of Memories, dedicated to Australia's service women, 2013The main elements of the design are: an asphalt area in front of the Lands Administration Building which connects George and William Streets; a diagonal path leading from the northern corner to the centre of the asphalt area; and a large lawn bounded by Elizabeth Street, the diagonal path, the asphalt area and garden beds along William Street. A lily pond, recently rebuilt, is located adjacent to the intersection of the diagonal path and the asphalt area. On the southwestern side of the pond is a converted fountain, now a sandstone and concrete planter box. The diagonal path is emphasised by a row of colvillea trees (Colvillea racemosa). A coral tree (Erythrina spp.) marks the entrance to the park from George Street. With the exception of specimen trees most of the planting in the park is kept at a low level so as not to divide the space visually. Barriers to movement, if not vision, are created along George Street by a zig-zag hedge (Acalypha) and along William Street by a chain wire fence, hedge and garden bed. Although the design of the park is relatively recent, earlier monuments have been incorporated which provide links to the previous form of the site. Two bronze statues on stone pedestals remain in their original locations. A marble slab in the paved area indicates the position of the altar of the former St John's Pro-Cathedral. A statue of Queen Victoria, is centrally positioned on the asphalt area in front of the symmetrical facade of the Lands Administration Building. The diagonal path is terminated by the monument which looks towards the Treasury Building and is framed by two leopard trees (Caesalpinia ferrea). The bronze statue stands on a pedestal, the upper portion of which is made of brown Helidon sandstone and the lower portion of Enoggera granite. The pedestal is square in form, with chamfered corners and is set on a flight of three granite steps. Directly behind the Queen is a 1915 Krupp gun. The TJ Ryan statue also stands on a pedestal of Helidon sandstone and Enoggera granite. Separated from the main area of the park by a fence and garden, it is positioned diagonally facing the corner of William and Elizabeth Streets. An ornamental bronze plaque is attached to the pedestal. A recent addition to the park's memorials is a rough hewn block of bluestone with a bronze plaque bolted to it that commemorates the service of Australian women in war. It is located on the southwestern side of the asphalt area between rose beds. Timber and concrete benches are placed along the paths and around the lily pond. The original cast-iron lamp posts on cast-iron pedestals have been relocated along the paths. The planting is dominated by exotic plants with coloured foliage and decorative leaf shape. Many garden beds have plants clipped into geometric patterns. The Gardens provide a foreground for viewing the principal facades of the Lands Administration Building, the former Library and the Family Services Building, and forms a pleasant aspect for the buildings which overlook it.  Heritage listing  Queens Gardens was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Queens Gardens are important in demonstrating the evolution of Queensland's history, particularly in the evolution of the site from convict administration use to the centre of Anglicanism in Queensland to public park and focus for Queensland's most important government precinct. Queens Gardens also demonstrate the historic and governmental associations of the Queen Victoria and TJ Ryan statues. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. The site is significant for its potential to reveal substrata evidence of building materials and artefacts from the 1820s, which could contribute to an understanding of the early European settlement of Queensland. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The present garden layout is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of the work of influential landscape architect Harry Oakman, and is one of the most intact of his works surviving in Brisbane. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The gardens, together with the Queen Victoria and TJ Ryan statues, exhibit landscape and aesthetic qualities, and a townscape contribution as the integrating core of a remarkably fine group of public buildings, which are valued by the community. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The site has a special association with the Anglican Church and its early history in Queensland.

The shielding was only added later, after initial operations. The Bevatron was a particle accelerator -- specifically, a weak-focusing proton synchrotron -- at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, U.S., which began operating in 1954.UC Radiation Lab Document UCRL-3369, \\"Experiences with the BEVATRON\\", E.J. Lofgren, 1956. The antiproton was discovered there in 1955, resulting in the 1959 Nobel Prize in physics for Emilio Segr√® and Owen Chamberlain. It accelerated protons into a fixed target, and was named for its ability to impart energies of billions of eV. (Billions of eV Synchrotron.) Antiprotons At the time the Bevatron was designed, it was strongly suspected, but not known, that each particle had a corresponding anti-particle of opposite charge, identical in all other respects, a property known as charge symmetry. The anti-electron, or positron, had been first observed in the early 1930s and theoretically understood as a consequence of the Dirac equation at about the same time. Following World War II, positive and negative muons and pions were observed in cosmic-ray interactions seen in cloud chambers and stacks of nuclear photographic emulsions. The Bevatron was built to be energetic enough to create antiprotons, and thus test the hypothesis that every particle has a corresponding anti-particle.Segr√® Nobel Lecture, 1960 In 1955, the antiproton was discovered using the Bevatron. The antineutron was discovered soon thereafter by Oreste Piccioni and co-workers, also at the Bevatron. Confirmation of the charge symmetry conjecture in 1955 led to the Nobel Prize for physics being awarded to Emilio Segr√® and Owen Chamberlain in 1959. Shortly after the Bevatron came into use, it was recognized that parity was not conserved in the weak interactions, which led to resolution of the tau-theta puzzle, the understanding of strangeness, and the establishment of CPT symmetry as a basic feature of relativistic quantum field theories. Requirements and design In order to create antiprotons (mass ~938 MeV/c2) in collisions with nucleons in a stationary target while conserving both energy and momentum, a proton beam energy of approximately 6.2 GeV is required. At the time it was built, there was no known way to confine a particle beam to a narrow aperture, so the beam space was about four square feet in cross section. The combination of beam aperture and energy required a huge, 10,000 ton iron magnet, and a very large vacuum system. A large motor- generator system was used to ramp up the magnetic field for each cycle of acceleration. At the end of each cycle, after the beam was used or extracted, the large magnetic field energy was returned to spin up the motor, which was then used as a generator to power the next cycle, conserving energy; the entire process required about five seconds. The characteristic rising and falling, wailing, sound of the motor-generator system could be heard in the entire complex when the machine was in operation. In the years following the antiproton discovery, much pioneering work was done here using beams of protons extracted from the accelerator proper, to hit targets and generate secondary beams of elementary particles, not only protons but also neutrons, pions, \\"strange particles\\", and many others. The liquid hydrogen bubble chamber First tracks observed in liquid hydrogen bubble chamber at the Bevatron The extracted particle beams, both the primary protons and secondaries, could in turn be passed for further study through various targets and specialized detectors, notably the liquid hydrogen bubble chamber. Many thousands of particle interactions, or \\"events\\", were photographed, measured, and studied in detail with an automated system of large measuring machines (known as \\"Franckensteins\\", for their inventor Jack Franck) allowing human operators (typically the wives of graduate students) to mark points along the particle tracks and punch their coordinates into IBM cards, using a foot pedal. The cards decks were then analyzed by early-generation computers, which reconstructed the three-dimensional tracks through the magnetic fields, and computed the momenta and energy of the particles. Computer programs, extremely complex for their time, then fitted the track data associated with a given event to estimate the energies, masses, and identities of the particles produced. This period, when hundreds of new particles and excited states were suddenly revealed, marked the beginning of a new era in elementary particle physics. Luis Alvarez inspired and directed much of this work, for which he received the Nobel Prize in physics in 1968. Bevalac The Bevatron received a new lease on life in 1971,Bevalac Had 40-Year Record of Historic Discoveries Goldhaber, J. (1992) Berkeley Lab Archive when it was joined to the SuperHILAC linear accelerator as an injector for heavy ions. The combination was conceived by Albert Ghiorso, who named it the Bevalac.LBL 3835, \\"Accelerator Division Annual Report\\", E.J.Lofgren, October 6, 1975 It could accelerate a wide range of stable nuclei to relativistic energies. It was finally decommissioned in 1993. End of life The next generation of accelerators used \\"strong focusing\\", and required much smaller apertures, and thus much cheaper magnets. The CERN PS (Proton Synchrotron, 1959) and the Brookhaven National Laboratory AGS (Alternating Gradient Synchrotron, 1960) were the first next-generation machines, with an aperture roughly an order of magnitude less in both transverse directions, and reaching 30 GeV proton energy, yet with a less massive magnet ring. For comparison, the circulating beams in the Large Hadron Collider, with ~11,000 times higher energy and enormously higher intensity than the Bevatron, are confined to a space on the order of 1 mm in cross-section, and focused down to 16 micrometres at the intersection collision regions, while the field of the bending magnets is only about five times higher. The demolition of the Bevatron began in 2009 and was completed in early 2012.

When taken with meals, it binds to dietary phosphate and prevents its absorption. Sevelamer was invented and developed by GelTex Pharmaceuticals. Sevelamer is currently marketed by Sanofi under the trade names Renagel (sevelamer hydrochloride) and Renvela (sevelamer carbonate). Chemistry and pharmacology Sevelamer consists of polyallylamine that is crosslinked with epichlorohydrin. The marketed form sevelamer hydrochloride is a partial hydrochloride salt being present as approximately 40% amine hydrochloride and 60% sevelamer base. The amine groups of sevelamer become partially protonated in the intestine and interact with phosphate ions through ionic and hydrogen bonding. Medical uses Sevelamer is used in the management of hyperphosphatemia in adult patients with stage 4 and 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) on hemodialysis. Its efficacy at lowering phosphate levels is similar to that of calcium acetate, but without the accompanying risk of hypercalcemia and arterial calcification. In patients with CKD, it has also been shown to reduce triglycerides and LDL, and increase HDL. Contraindications Sevelamer therapy is contraindicated in hypophosphatemia or bowel obstruction. In hypophosphatemia, sevelamer could exacerbate the condition by further lowering phosphate levels in the blood, which could be fatal. Adverse effects Common adverse drug reactions (ADRs) associated with the use of sevelamer include: hypotension, hypertension, nausea and vomiting, dyspepsia, diarrhea, flatulence, and/or constipation. Other effects Sevelamer can significantly reduce serum uric acid. This reduction has no known detrimental effect and several beneficial effects, including reducing hyperuricemia, uric acid nephrolithiasis, and gout. Sevelamer is able to sequester advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in the gut, preventing their absorption into the blood. AGEs contribute to oxidative stress, which can damage cells (like beta cells, which produce insulin in the pancreas). As Vlassara and Uribarri explain in a 2014 review on AGEs, this may explain why sevelamer, but not calcium carbonate (a phosphate binder that does not sequester AGEs), has been shown to lower AGEs in the blood, as well as oxidative stress and inflammatory markers.

His research focuses on communications theory, particularly coding and wireless communications and networks. Prior to studying at the University of Tehran, he was ranked first in the nationwide entrance examination of Iranian universities in 1984. After receiving his B.S. degree in 1989, he studied at the University of Maryland College Park and obtained his M.S. degree in 1994 followed by his Ph.D. in 1997. After graduating, Jafarkhani joined AT&T; Laboratories-Research in August 1997 before moving to Broadcom in July 2000 and to the University of California, Irvine in September 2001. Within the wireless communications field, Jafarkhani is best known as the primary inventor of space-time codes and for his contributions to his two seminal papers which established the field of space‚Äìtime block coding, published whilst working for AT&T.; The first of these, \\"Space‚Äìtime block codes from orthogonal designs\\", established the theoretical basis for space‚Äìtime block codes, and the second, \\"Space‚Äìtime block coding for wireless communications: performance results\\", provided numerical analysis of the performance of the first such codes. Space‚Äìtime codes rely on the use of multiple antennas at the transmit side of a wireless link. Multiple copies of the same data are transmitted from these multiple antennas in such a way that the receiver has a much better chance of correctly detecting the signal in the presence of corruption and noise than if just one copy is sent. The performance of space‚Äìtime coded systems, in terms of the reliability of the transmission is significantly better than non-coded systems. Space‚Äìtime block codes in particular are known to be simple to implement and effective, and Jafarkhani's two papers triggered the massive international research effort into them that continues today. Later, in 2001, Jafarkhani introduced quasi-orthogonal space‚Äìtime block codes which overcome some of the difficulties inherent in earlier codes, at a cost of transmitting less data. These too are now widely studied. Then, in 2003 he introduced a more powerful version of his original codes, the super-orthogonal space‚Äìtime trellis codes which combine the effects of both block codes and space‚Äìtime trellis codes. Again, this work has led to significant research efforts around the world. Jafarkhani received a National Science Foundation CAREER award in January 2003 which \\"recognizes outstanding scientists and engineers who, early in their careers, show exceptional potential for leadership at the frontiers of knowledge\\". He is also a Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), an editor of IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications and an associate editor of IEEE Communications Letters. Jafarkhani is the author of Space-Time Coding: Theory and Practice, published in September 2005. Jafarkhani is a co-recipient of the 2013 IEEE Eric E.

Gordy experiences the lives of others who are part of the film's side plots, including traveling country music singers Luke McAllister and his daughter Jinnie Sue; and lonely boy Hanky Royce whose mother Jessica is engaged to a sinister businessman, Gilbert Sipes. Gordy changes lives for the people he encounters due to their ability to understand him. The film was released to theaters on May 12, 1995. It was distributed by Miramax Family Films. The film features the song \\"Pig Power in the House\\" by Tag Team. A music video was produced for the song, featuring clips from the film.  Plot  A piglet named Gordy lives a happy life on Meadow Brook Farm somewhere near Hope, Arkansas. However, after the farm's farmer goes bankrupt, he is forced to sell everything, starting with Gordy's family. Two men arrive in a truck to take Gordy's father, but Gordy is alerted of this by the farm's rooster. Gordy tries to stop his father from leaving by following the truck taking his father, but his father tells him to go home and look after the family. When Gordy returns he finds that his mother and siblings were taken in another truck while he pursued his father. Determined to locate his family and return to the farm, Gordy sets out alone to find them. He eventually ends up in the care of Jinnie Sue MacAllister, a young country singer who lives in a camper van with her also country singer father, Luke, and their \\"manager\\", Cousin Jake. Jinnie Sue, not knowing Gordy's name, calls him Pinky. They travel to a dinner party, where Luke performs for the governor of Arkansas. Also there is rich businessman, Henry R. Royce; his daughter Jessica; her rather dull but scheming fianc√©, Gilbert Sipes; and her lonely young son Hanky. Hanky wanders off on his own and meets Gordy and Jinnie Sue. Hanky falls into a swimming pool, but cannot swim. Just as Jinnie Sue rushes off to get help, Gordy dives into the pool with an inflatable pool toy, and saves Hanky. Due to his bravery, Gordy is given to Hanky as a pet, and Gordy also becomes suddenly famous. Royce and Sipes have alternate decisions on who the new mascot of the Royce Company should be: Gordy or Jessica. In the end, Gordy wins, due to a switched camera lens used on Jessica's promotion. Sipes is determined to remove Gordy and then take control of the company. Sipes sends his two guards, Dietz and Krugman, to kidnap Gordy, but Gordy and Hanky escape by boarding a school bus, which Dietz and Krugman pursue. On the way, the two men are distracted briefly by a cross- dressing thief, and discover that Gordy and Hanky have escaped onto a feeding truck. Gordy and Hanky unexpectedly meet up with the MacAllisters, who learn from the radio that Hanky has apparently run away. Another bulletin follows, revealing Henry Royce has died of a heart attack. The MacAllisters return Hanky and Gordy to the Royce building in St. Louis, Missouri where an attorney reveals Henry has left his company to Hanky and Gordy. Cousin Jake, upon learning Gordy's family is missing, organizes a giant country-wide search to locate them and also a country music concert in Branson, Missouri in Gordy's name. A host of country singers perform, as well as a surprise speech from President Bill Clinton (just an impersonator), who unveils a new stamp of Gordy. Sipes sends his men to kidnap Gordy, tie him in a sack, and toss him in a river, but the pig is saved by Cousin Jake. Jake returns Gordy to Hanky and Jinnie Sue. Everyone learns from someone who calls into the telethon that Gordy's family is going to be slaughtered at an unidentified slaughterhouse in Nebraska. Sipes tries to hide the fact that the very same slaughterhouse is owned by the Royce family. However, a battle ensues between Sipes and Luke, with Jessica and Luke knocking him out with the suitcase of Brinks, the family attorney. Gordy, Hanky, Jinnie Sue, Jessica, Luke, Cousin Jake, and Brinks race to stop the slaughterhouse from killing Gordy's family, but a train slows them down. They call the slaughter house and save Gordy and his family.

Review aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes rated the film with a 26% based on 19 reviews. Both Babe and Gordy premiered in the same year. Although Gordy was released first, it was not very successful, while Babe was a critical and commercial success, won several awards (including an Academy Award for Visual Effects) and spawned a sequel. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 2 out of 4 stars and wrote, \\"This is not the kind of film that rewards deep analysis. I rate it at two stars, but I'd recommend it for kids. I can't recommend it for people like me, but there are many other kinds of people in the world, some of them children who believe that pigs can talk, and for them, Gordy is likely to be very entertaining. You know who you are.\\" Peter Stack of the Chronicle Staff claimed that \\"Gordys strongest suit is the piglet's determination to reunite with his family, and that part of the convoluted plot develops into a folksy comic effort as Jinnie Sue, her dad, Hanky and Gordy race to save the family of pigs from becoming sausages. One would think the pork industry would be livid about this film as it portrays pig slaughter as an outrageous evil. The highlight comes when Gordy jumps into a backyard swimming pool‚Äîpiglets really are cutest when they put their little trotters together and dive‚Äîand saves Hanky from drowning. Generally speaking, time would be better spent with Charlotte's Web than this forgettable hogwash.\\" Chris Hicks of the Deseret News reviewed the film saying that \\"This may have sounded like a cute idea on paper, but as kids pictures go this is the worst to come along in memory. Charmless, humorless and dull as drying paint, Gordy is the kind of movie parents should save for video punishment. But if they take their kids to a theater, they'll be punishing themselves.\\" Dave Kehr of the New York Daily News described Gordy as \\"a particularly dull and inept family film\\". Caryn James of The New York Times opined that \\"It is possible that some children will be tickled at the very idea of a talking pig, even one as bland as Gordy. They will probably be children who have never seen any movie, ever. Gordy is the film that asks, How you gonna keep them down on the farm after they've seen Simba?\\" Rita Kempley of the Washington Post called Gordy a \\"peculiar, seemingly pro-vegan tale\\". She later went on to say that \\"It's fairly obvious that Gordy's performance was inspired by Arnold Ziffel's precedent-setting work on the old TV series \\"Green Acres.\\" But then so was the movie, which was penned by series alumni Jay Sommers and Dick Chevillat. Their screenplay is as bland as an afternoon in Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, though the director, Australian animal-mockumentary-maker Mark Lewis, adds a touch of menace by using extreme close-ups, bizarre angles and other stylish camera work. One thing's for sure, Gordy will put little pea-pickers off their pork.\\" Walter V. Addiego of The Examiner Staff stated that \\"The film tosses a few mild, satirical darts at public relations and advertising, but otherwise it's strictly hokum from the heartland. The director, I'm sorry to say, is Mark Lewis, the Australian responsible for the strange and funny documentary Cane Toads: An Unnatural History, which enlivened the S.F. Film Festival in 1988. Gordy will not enhance his r√©sum√©. It's surprisingly amateurish, due in no small part to clumsy scripting by Leslie Stevens.\\" Tracy Moore of Common Sense Media gave the film two out of five stars, saying that \\"This fast-moving adventure about a talking pig's mission to find his family has a few fun elements -- some lively country music, a brush with fortune and fame, a bit of suspense, and lots of comically dodged mishaps. Kids will no doubt be entertained by the talking animals, cute pigs, and loads of adventure. Parents, however, should note the parent and child separation and the death of a grandparent as key concerns, as well as the scariness factor of the impending violence of the slaughterhouse, which is teased throughout the movie. If the audience is old enough to handle that potentially squeamish subject, Gordy is otherwise a passable 90 minutes of animal-talking antics.\\" TV Guide gave the film 1¬Ω stars out of four. However, Louis Black of The Austin Chronicle wrote a favorable review of the film concluding that \\"A lot happens, it moves quickly, and the film is filled with minor characters who nicely round things out; my young companion watched the film from beginning to end, loving it. This is not a date movie.\\"  References   External links   Category:1995 films Category:1990s adventure films Category:1990s buddy films Category:1990s comedy-drama films Category:1990s fantasy films Category:1990s road movies Category:American buddy films Category:American children's comedy films Category:American children's drama films Category:American children's fantasy films Category:American comedy-drama films Category:American films Category:American road movies Category:Children's comedy-drama films Category:Country music films Category:English-language films Category:Films about children Category:Films about friendship Category:Films about pigs Category:Films set in Arkansas Category:Films set in Missouri Category:Films set in Nebraska Category:1995 comedy films Category:1995 drama films ","title":"Gordy"},{"id":"2589381","text":"Jiangxi is a southeastern province of China.

The scaled pigeon is fairly common in semi-open forest. It builds a stick platform nest in a tree and lays two white eggs. Wildsumaco Lodge - Ecuador Its flight is high, fast and direct, with the regular beats and an occasional sharp flick of the wings which are characteristic of pigeons in general. It is usually very wary, since it is frequently hunted. The scaled pigeon is long and weighs normally about . Adult males have mainly purple brown plumage, with a paler scaly appearance to the neck and underparts. The lower underparts are whitish edged with purple. The eyering, legs and bill are red, the latter having a white tip. The female is dull dark brown rather than purplish, and is slightly smaller than the male.

Westward Beach at Point Dume 'Balance Rock' near the Mishe Mokwa Trail King Gillette Ranch Park Mountain lion kitten P-54, born in early 2017 in the SMMNRA Park history The movement to preserve the Santa Monica Mountains has a long tradition which is frequently overlooked by historians who often focus exclusively on the environmental movement of the 1960s and 1970s which culminated with the establishment of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area in 1978. Besides geologic forces, people who inhabited the area in the past have been ones to also affect the land. There were different reasons for people to come into the area. Some came to live and others to work the land. The first groups to live in the mountains were the Native American tribes called the Chumash and the Tongva who lived here for thousands of years. Then came the Spanish Explorers, Rancheros, and Homesteaders (after the Homestead Act of 1862) from other areas of the country, who worked the land. The Homesteaders brought new ideas and cultures that shaped the landscape and mindset of the area, and California overall. Up to this day, people continue to live, work, and recreate in the Santa Monica Mountains. Places such as Paramount Ranch, Solstice Canyon, and Rancho Sierra Vista/ Satwiwa still have that history that has been left behind by people in the past. The past stories from these people are discovered through photographs, letters, to even things they threw away. Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area strives to make sure the collections, places, and stories of the people who affected the landscape will be preserved for the future. =Griffith Park= The first area in the Santa Monica Mountains set aside for public use was Griffith Park which was donated to the city of Los Angeles by Griffith J. Griffith in 1896. =National Forest= During the first decade of the twentieth century, Frederick H. Rindge made several attempts to create a forest reserve in the Santa Monica Mountains. These reserves were precursors to national forests. In 1902 California's State Mining Bureau examined the area being considered for the establishment of a forest reserve. The resulting report was sent to Washington where the proposal for a reserve was denied.\\"Forest reserves. Santa Monica scheme turned down,\\" Los Angeles Times, March 8, 1907, section II, page 5 In 1907 an application was submitted to the Secretary of the Interior requesting that at least 70,000 acres in the mountains be designated a forest reserve.\\"Private snap of reserve?\\" Los Angeles Times, February 10, 1907, section II, page 19 This time state mineralogist Lewis E. Aubury opposed the venture. He wrote the L.A. Time newspaper stating, \\"I believe that the lands embraced in the Malibu and Santa Monica districts should not be included in a forest reserve‚Ä¶I shall at once take the matter up with Gifford Pinchot, forester, Washington, D.C., and endeavor to ascertain his views on the subject, and further protest against the creation of this proposed reserve\\".L.E. Aubury, \\"Against the Malibu reserve,\\" Los Angeles Times, February 10, 1917, section II, page 4 Days later the U. S. Forest Service advised Aubury that it was highly improbable that a forest reserve would be created owing to local opposition and the small amount of public land still remaining in the Santa Monica Mountains. =Whitestone National Park= Limestone deposits were discovered in the mountains behind Pacific Palisades in 1925 which led to a lengthy battle between wealthy home owners of the area and land developers.Betty Lou Young, Pacific Palisades: Where the Mountains meet the Sea, Pacific Palisades Historical Society Press, 1983, page 135 The quarry site was in Traylor Canyon, three miles inland from the sea, between Santa Ynez and Temescal Canyons.Young, Pacific Palisades, page 135. Alphonzo Bell, Sr. was the real estate developer behind the quarry scheme while local opposition was led by Sylvia Morrison, who championed the preservation of the area's natural beauty. After much criticism of his original plan, Bell offered a new proposal. Using a new process, he would have the rock pulverized, mixed with water, and pumped via a buried pipeline to the mouth of Santa Ynez Canyon. The pipeline would continue from there along the ocean floor to an offshore buoy where it would be load on board a waiting ship.Young, Pacific Palisades, page 139 Criticism of the plan grew and eventually garnered the ire of local resident Will Rogers who parodied the plan on the front page of the L.A. Times.Young, Pacific Palisades, page 141-142 The debate raged citywide with such notable public figures as William Mulholland coming to Bell's defense. In an attempt to sway public opinion, Bell urged local residents to take company-sponsored fieldtrips, on foot and on horseback, to the quarry to see the site for themselves. Among the people who took these trips was Sylvia Morrison, who had been an early leader of environmental concerns. She was among the visitors who scrambled up the limestone cliffs on ladders and hiked and rode on horseback through the chaparral and came away thrilled with the natural beauty of the canyons. \\"Taking a cue from Yellowstone National Park, Morrison urged the establishment of Whitestone National Park in the Santa Monica Mountains, named after the by-now infamous cliffs.\\"Young, Pacific Palisades, page 144 =Fredrick Law Olmsted= In 1930 Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr., a lifelong advocate of national parks and considered by many as the designer of the California State Parks system, proposed a network of parks, beaches, playgrounds, and forests to promote the social, economic, and environmental vitality of Los Angeles.Robert Garcia, et al, Free the Beach! Public Access, Equal Justice, and the California Coast, Center for Law in the Public Interest, April 2005, 6‚Äì7 Olmsted also advocated for public ownership of at least 10,000 acres of the most scenic beach and mountain landscapes between Topanga and Point Dume.Mike Davis, \\"Let Malibu Burn: A Political History of the Fire Coast,\\" L.A. Weekly, 1996 However, the Olmsted report was essentially killed ‚Äì only 200 copies were printed ‚Äì due mainly to civic leaders who put politics ahead of public space. =Rindge bankruptcy= After lengthy court battles to preserve her estate, May Rindge (widow of Frederick H. Rindge) lost control of her lands and was forced into bankruptcy in 1938. A proposal to establish a large park was considered in exchange for the cancellation of $1.1 million in unpaid taxes.\\"Mrs. May Rindge loses control of great rancho,\\" L.A. Times, June 30, 1938, A1 However, Los Angeles County refused the offer, thus missing the opportunity to acquire 17,000 acres of park lands.Mike Davis, \\"Let Malibu Burn: A Political History of the Fire Coast,\\" L.A. Weekly, 1996, page 3 =Will Rogers State Historic Park= Will Rogers State Historic Park was created in 1944 marking the establishment of the first state park in the Santa Monica Mountains and the first public land created in the mountains since Griffith Park in 1896. It now adjoins Topanga State Park on its northeast side. =Toyon National Park= In the 1960s and 70s, and possible as early of the 1950s, another campaign was undertaken to preserve the Santa Monica Mountains. Several proposals went before the U.S. Congress which called for the creation of Toyon National Park, referring to a dominant chaparral plant found in the area. The legislative history of Toyon National Park dates back to 1971 when Representative Alphonzo Bell, Jr. first introduced a bill in the Congress.Skip Ferderber, \\"U.S. will hear 100,000 acre park proposal,\\" Los Angeles Times, June 13, 1974, page WS1 =Point Mugu State Park= Point Mugu State Park was the first of three large, rural state parks in the Santa Monica Mountains was established in 1967, when the State Division of Beaches and Parks, the forerunner of California State Parks, acquired title to acres of the old Broome Ranch for $15.1 million.\\"Point Mugu Park Land Acquired,\\" Los Angeles Times, March 5, 1967, page H6. This property was the first acquisition for Point Mugu State Park, and was part of the 19th century Mexican Rancho Guadalasca. 5,800 acres was purchased from Richard E. Danielson in 1972 for $2.1 million, nearly doubling the park's acreage.\\"Point Mugu Park Addition OKd,\\" San Diego Union, March 12, 1972, page 17. This property is situated northeast of the park's original 6,700 acres and consisted of mostly backcountry. A remaining 850-acre parcel which adjoined this property was purchased by the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area from Danielson in 1980, becoming Rancho Sierra Vista open space park. =Topanga State Park= Topanga State Park was opened to the public in 1974. The park's original name was Topanga Canyon State Park, but the name was shortened because the park encompass large areas outside Topanga Canyon, from the Pacific Coast Highway to Mulholland Drive. The park can be accessed by car and trails from Topanga, and by trailheads in Pacific Palisades and the San Fernando Valley. =Malibu Creek State Park= In the heart of the Santa Monica Mountains, the 20th Century Fox Movie Ranch, commonly called Century Ranch, was a 2,700-acre land acquisition of what would become Malibu Creek State Park. It was purchased by the State of California in 1974 for $4.8 million. Reagan Ranch, a 120-acre property on the west and formerly owned by Ronald Reagan, was included in the original Century Ranch purchase.Robert A. Jones, \\"Century Ranch gets Park Status in Compromise,\\" Los Angeles Time, January 10, 1976, page B1. The Hope Ranch, owned by entertainer Bob Hope and which abutted Century Ranch, was purchased in 1975 for $4.1 million. In 1976 the State Parks and Recreation Commission adopted a compromise on the classification of the Century Ranch property, and officially named it Malibu Creek State Park. =Establishment of the National Recreation Area= The Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area was established November 10, 1978, after a long campaign for preservation of the Santa Monica Mountains by local and regional conservationists. Susan B. Nelson helped organize \\"Friends of the Santa Monica Mountains, Parks and Seashore\\" in 1964 and was known as the mother of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area.McLellan, Dennis (May 22, 2003) Susan Nelson, 76; Mountain Parklands Advocate Obituary. Los Angeles Times In 1988 though, she was concerned about the political push to end federal land purchases encouraged by Los Angeles County developers that preferred the land stay available for home building. She was encouraged though that neighboring cities in Ventura County were supportive of park expansion.Nelson, Susan and Strote, Mary Ellen (May 22, 1988) Santa Monica Mountains‚ÄîParkland Dream Dying on the Vine Opinion. Los Angeles Times The strategy has been to grow SMMNRA by 'mosaic pieces' linking critical habitats, saving unique areas, and expanding existing parks. The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, a California state agency, was created in 1980 for the acquisition of land for preservation as open space, for wildlife and California native plants habitat preserves, and for public recreation activities.\\"Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy Preserves Nature's Treasures in Metropolitan Los Angeles\\" California Biodiversity Newsletter. CERES accessed February 28, 2010 One of the first land acquisitions was Rancho Sierra Vista in 1980 which is reputed to be one of the last intact ranches from the first half of the twentieth century in the Santa Monica Mountains. =Continuing land acquisitions= In 1980 the Paramount Movie Ranch was acquired in Agoura Hills, and is the present day Paramount Ranch Park. The National Park Service revitalized the old movie ranch, and it is again used for movie and television productions, and is open for public recreation and events. Entertainer and land speculator Bob Hope created controversy in the early 1990s when he proposed to sell of land in the Corral Canyon area in the Santa Monicas to the federal government in exchange for of federal parkland in the nearby Cheeseboro Canyon section of Santa Monica Mountains NRA in the Simi Hills, in order to build an access road to a new 'Jordan Ranch' golf course and housing development. The land swap was never completed, the Jordan Ranch became the Palo Commado section of the Cheeseboro Canyon / Palo Comado Canyon Open Space parks. Most of the land for the Corral Canyon Park was finally donated by Bob Hope. The former Ahmanson Ranch was acquired by the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy from Washington Mutual in 2003, to create the Upper Las Virgenes Canyon Open Space Preserve in the southeastern Simi Hills. It is adjacent to and has trailheads in Calabasas (Las Virgenes Trailhead), Woodland Hills (Victory Trailhead), and West Hills via Moore's Canyon in El Escorpi√≥n Park. The highly visible hills with undeveloped ranch land adjacent to the junction of U.S. Route 101 and Las Virgenes Road in western Calabasas, the former Brent's Junction area, have several viewsheds now protected from development. They also serve as an unofficial gateway to the central Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area and its visitors center on Las Virgenes Road at King Gillette Ranch. On the southeastern side the land was formerly owned by Bob Hope, acquired by the SMM Conservancy in 2010, and added to the Las Virgenes View Park in the Santa Monica Mountains NRA. The viewshed on the northwestern side of the junction, formerly owned by Fred Sands, was acquired in 2010 and protected in the Zev Yaroslavsky Las Virgenes Highlands Park. Both preserve refreshing open space that's seen by many travelers on the Ventura Freeway (101) between the San Fernando and the Conejo Valleys. The area was originally along the Spanish and Mexican El Camino Real. ‚Äì access date: September 6, 2010 =Rim of the Valley Trail Corridor Study= The Rim of the Valley Corridor Special Resource Study is being conducted by the National Park Service, and generally includes the mountains encircling the San Fernando, La Crescenta, Santa Clarita, Simi, and Conejo Valleys in Los Angeles and Ventura Counties. The SMMNRA is part of the Rim of the Valley Trail Corridor planning process, and several alternatives include a Rim of the Valley a SMMNRA boundary adjustment (of an approximately 173,000-acre or 313,000 acre addition). The Rim of the Valley Trail is a plan in progress for connecting the four valleys with the parklands surrounding them. rimofthevalleytrail-master plan January 6, 2010 www.lamountains =Woolsey Fire= In 2018, the Woolsey Fire burned through 88% of the federal parkland resulting in trails being closed for months. The fire, which was three times larger than the biggest fire ever before in the mountains, burned over 40% of the natural area in the Santa Monicas. The fire created a challenge to native plants as black mustard with bright yellow flowers quickly established itself as a wet winter followed the fire. The mustard plants will also provide fuel for the next fires. =Superintendents= *Robert Chandler, 1979‚Äì1982 *Daniel Kuehn, 1983‚Äì1988 *William Webb (Acting Superintendent), 1988‚Äì1989 *David Gackenbach, 1989‚Äì1995 *Arthur Eck, 1995‚Äì2002 *Woody Smeck, 2002‚Äì2012 *David Szymanski, 2012‚Äìpresent Cultural resources In terms of cultural heritage, the Santa Monica Mountains boast a rich history of continuous human occupation dating back more than 10,000 years and contain many nationally significant prehistoric and historic sites.National Park Service, General Management Plan: Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, March 5, 2003, page 17 In fact, more than 1,000 archaeological sites are located within the boundary of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area making it one of the highest densities of archaeological resources found in any mountain range in the world.National Park Service, Statement of National Significance, page 1 There are twenty-six known Chumash pictograph sites with the national recreation area, all sacred to traditional Native American Indians, and include some that are among the most spectacular found anywhere.National Park Service, General Management Plan, page 17 These pictographs ‚Äì along with other sites ‚Äì have been described by the National Park Service as \\"unique and a significant world heritage\\".National Park Service, Santa Monica Mountains NRA, Comprehensive Design Plan 1996: Simi Hills, August 1996, page 55 Nearly every major prehistoric and historic theme associated with human interaction and development of the western United States is represented within the park from the early hunters and gathers, to Native American Indian cultures, the Spanish mission and rancho periods, and the American homestead era. Park activist Susan Nelson was instrumental in pushing for an inventory of the flora and fauna of the park and the Native American archeological resources. At least 73 archeological sites, historic structures, cultural landscapes, and traditional cultural properties in the Santa Monica Mountains are potentially eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places.National Park Service, Statement of National Significance, page 4 The Santa Monica Looff Hippodrome on the famous Santa Monica Pier, which is within the national recreation area, is a National Historic Landmark, as is Will Rogers' house at Will Rogers State Historic Park (also within the national recreation area). The horsemen portrayed in the Saddle Rock Ranch Pictographs in the heart of the Santa Monica Mountains are considered to be a representation of the Portola Expedition of 1769‚Äì1770, and have been determined to be eligible as a National Historic Landmark. A number of California Historical Landmarks also lie within the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. These include the Site of the Port of Los Angeles Long Wharf (no. 881), Point Dume (no. 965), and the Adamson House of Malibu Lagoon State Beach (no. 966).

Her debut as a soloist was in 1969. She is the step-granddaughter of Danish actress Ingeborg Brams. Biography Petri, who began playing the recorder at the age of three, is noted for her virtuosity and versatility across a wide range of styles, from the baroque repertoire of the height of the instrument's popularity to contemporary works written particularly for her. She first played on Danish Radio at the age of five, and her debut performance as a soloist was at Copenhagen's Tivoli concert hall in 1969 when she was eleven. She has premiered dozens of works, by composers Malcolm Arnold, Gordon Jacob and Richard Harvey, as well as Daniel B√∂rtz, Erik Haumann, Hans Kunstovny, Erling Bjerno, Thomas Koppel, Ove Benzen, Vagn Holmboe, Piers Hellawell, Gary Kulesha, Asger Lund Christiansen, Egil Harder, Michael Berkeley, Butch Lacy, Miklos Maros, Ezra Laderman, Jens Bjerre, Henning Christiansen, Niels Viggo Bentzon, Axel Borup J√∏rgensen, and Gunnar Berg. She performed Vittorio Monti's Csardas with comedian-pianist Victor Borge at his eightieth birthday. She called that by far the hardest challenge of her professional career. She married guitarist and lutenist Lars Hannibal in 1992, though they divorced in 2010. However they still perform together and have given over 1,500 concerts and made numerous recordings. Together they founded the record company OUR Recordings. Petri has taken a particular interest in the combination of recorder and guitar, collaborating with guitarists including G√∂ran S√∂llscher, Kazuhito Yamashita and Manuel Barrueco. One notable collaboration of hers was two albums of sonatas by J. S. Bach and G. F. Handel, with Keith Jarrett on harpsichord; she has also recorded with the London Philharmonic Orchestra, the English Chamber Orchestra, and Pinchas Zukerman, among many others. Petri studied with Prof. Ferdinand Conrad at the Staatliche Hochschule f√ºr Musik und Theater in Hannover, partly because she was still too young to become a full- time student in Denmark. She gave a debut recital for BBC radio in March 1976, and the BBC released a recorded recital in 1977. Leo Black's sleeve note for this recording remarks, \\"one realises what can happen when a mighty talent starts young enough.\\" Her mother is Hanne Petri, who studied at the Royal Danish Academy of Music, and her brother, David Petri, won the Danish \\"Young Musician of the Year Award\\" in 1978.

Childhood years David King Udall was born in St. Louis, Missouri. His parents, David Udall and Eliza King, had immigrated to the United States from England earlier in the year. In 1852 they followed the Mormon Trail to Utah. They settled in Nephi, Utah. Udall spent his childhood farming. As a teenager, he spent a short period as a laborer building the Union Pacific Railroad which became part of the First Transcontinental Railroad. Early adulthood In 1875, Udall married his first wife, Eliza Stewart. Shortly thereafter he was called by the LDS Church on a mission to England, where he remained until 1877. In 1880, while again living in Nephi, Udall was called to be the Mormon bishop in St. Johns, Arizona. At the time, St. Johns was a small and primarily Hispanic Catholic community. Immediately after moving his family there, Udall purchased lands and directed improvements geared toward creating a larger Mormon settlement of the area. Polygamy and imprisonment In 1882, Udall took a second wife, Ida Hunt, a granddaughter of Jefferson Hunt (1803‚Äì1879) and also through her mother of Lois Barnes Pratt (1802‚Äì1880) and Addison Pratt (1802‚Äì1872). That same year the U.S. Congress passed the Edmunds Act to aid in the prosecution of polygamists. Udall was indicted on charges of unlawful cohabitation in 1884. He was never convicted, because his second wife lived in another town, and prosecutors could not locate Ida to compel her testimony against him. Prosecutors remained determined to make an example of Udall, and in 1885, he was indicted and convicted on perjury charges, related to a sworn statement he made about the land claim of a fellow Mormon. He spent three months in a Federal Prison in Detroit, Michigan, before receiving a full and unconditional pardon by President Grover Cleveland on December 12, 1885. The perjury conviction stemmed from an affidavit he swore on the land claim of Miles P. Romney (grandfather of George Romney).David King Udall (1851-1938) PoliticalGraveyard.comThe Perspective of the West David King Udall and Pearl Udall Nelson, Arizona Pioneer Mormon (Tucson, 1959) ¬© 2001 The West Film Project and WETA Later years Udall was appointed to be a Stake president, a higher position in the LDS leadership, in 1887. He held that position for the next 35 years. Throughout that time he ran a number of business ventures of varying success. In 1899, he served a single term as a Republican representative to the Arizona Territorial Legislature (which later became the Arizona Senate after statehood).Maria S. Ellsworth, ed., Mormon Odyssey: The Story of Ida Hunt Udall, Plural Wife (Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 1992), p. 23 In 1903, he quietly married the former Mary Ann Linton, widow of John Hamilton Morgan (1842‚Äì1894), who had been a representative to the Utah Territorial Legislature. This marriage ran contrary to the LDS Church's decision to ban polygamy in 1890. Years later Matthias F. Cowley, the official who performed the ceremony, was stripped of his priesthood by the LDS Church. When the marriage came to light, Udall was never sanctioned, but he was forced to cease marital relations with Mary. He did, however, continue to support her and her children (from her marriage to Morgan) financially until the children reached adulthood. In 1906, a Prescott Federal Grand Jury indicted Udall and several others on charges of polygamy, which was a violation of the Edmunds Act. After Marshal Ben Daniels served Udall and the others, they went to Prescott and paid their fines of $100, and then went back home. From 1927 to 1934 he served as the president of the LDS Mesa Arizona Temple. He wrote an autobiography, Arizona pioneer Mormon; David King Udall: his story and his family, 1851-1938 in collaboration with his daughter, Pearl Udall Nelson. His wives, Ida and Eliza, preceded him in death in 1915 and 1937, respectively. He died in 1938 in St. Johns, Arizona. David Udall's surviving children included two state supreme court justices and a mayor of Phoenix. Stewart Udall, Arizona Congressman and 1961-1969 Secretary of Interior, and his brother Morris Udall, also an Arizona Congressmen, were two of David Udall's grandchildren.

Miller & Environmental Law Inst., Citizen Suits: Private Enforcement of Federal Pollution Control Laws (1987). Citizen suits are particularly common in the field of environmental law.See, e.g., Citizen Suits Citizen suits come in three forms. First, a private citizen can bring a lawsuit against a citizen, corporation, or government body for engaging in conduct prohibited by the statute. For example, a citizen can sue a corporation under the Clean Water Act (CWA) for illegally polluting a waterway. Second, a private citizen can bring a lawsuit against a government body for failing to perform a non-discretionary duty. For example, a private citizen could sue the Environmental Protection Agency for failing to promulgate regulations that the CWA required it to promulgate. In a third, less common form, citizens may sue for an injunction to abate a potential imminent and substantial endangerment involving generation, disposal or handling of waste, regardless of whether or not the defendant's conduct violates a statutory prohibition. This third type of citizen suit is analogous to the common law tort of public nuisance.See Middlesex City Board of Chosen Freeholders v. New Jersey, 645 F. Supp. 715, 721-22(D.N.J. 1986); see also RCRA Imminent Hazard Authority: A Powerful Tool for Businesses, Governments, and Citizen Enforcers, 24 Envtl. L. Rep. (Envtl. L. Inst.) 10122 (March 1994), http://www.tulane.edu/~telc/assets/articles/RCRA%20Haz%20ELR_94.pdf In general, the law entitles plaintiffs who bring successful citizen suits to recover reasonable attorney fees and other litigation costs.See Adam Babich, The Wages of Sin: The Violator-Pays Rule for Environmental Citizen Suits, 10 Widener L. Rev. 219 (2003); see also The Violator-Pays Rule, Envtl. F., May/June 2004, at 30, http://www.tulane.edu/~telc/assets/articles/2004%20Forum%20Violator%20Pays.pdf. In 1970, when amending the Clean Air Act, the United States Congress was inspired by similar legislation in the civil rights arenaSee Zygmunt J.B. Plater, Facing a Time of Counter-Revolution‚ÄîThe Kepone Incident and a Review of First Principles, 29 U. RICH. L. REV. 657, 701 (1995) (Environmental citizen suit provisions were ‚Äú[m]odelled after provisions in the civil rights acts . . . .‚Äù) to begin including specific provisions for citizens to bring suit against violators or government agencies to enforce environmental laws. Today, most anti-pollution laws have provisions for citizen suits and they have become a major means of ensuring compliance with environmental laws. Public-interest environmental legal service organizations, such as Earthjustice and the Tulane Environmental Law Clinic, often prosecute citizen suits.See Earthjustice web page, http://earthjustice.org/our_work/cases/index.html; Tulane Environmental Law Clinic web page, http://www.tulane.edu/~telc/assets/pdfs/lawsuits.pdf Some non-environmental statutes, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Fair Housing Amendments Act, also contain citizen suit provisions, but the majority of regulatory statutes do not.

Origins and education  Mason was born to humble parents in Abingdon in Berkshire (now Oxfordshire) in 1503. His father is said to have been a cowherd,* his mother was the sister of a monk at Abingdon Abbey; possibly Thomas Rowland, the last abbot. Alternatively, there are rumours that Mason was, in fact, the abbot's illegitimate son.* Whatever his family connection to the boy, Rowland played an important role in his education, sending him to the abbey school, followed by All Souls College, Oxford, where he became a Fellow in 1521, got his B.A. on 8 July 1521, and his M.A. on 21 February 1525. He was also ordained as an acolyte in 1521. At Oxford he attracted the attention of Sir Thomas More, who prevailed upon Henry VIII to appoint him King's scholar in Paris, with an annual allowance of ¬£3 6s 8d, which was doubled in 1531. His income was further boosted by the addition of the first of many ecclesiastical benefices: the rectory of Kingston Bagpuize in Berkshire.  Career  He was appointed Clerk of the Parliaments in July 1550, succeeding William Paget, 1st Baron Paget (to whom he had been deputy since January 1542), although it seems the two shared the office from December 1551. He became Chancellor of Oxford University for the periods 1552-1556 and 1559‚Äì1564. He was Member of parliament for Reading (UK Parliament constituency) in 1547, and for Hampshire (UK Parliament constituency) on four occasions between 1554 and 1563. He worked for several Tudor monarchs collecting information from the Continent and as a diplomat. He was knighted by Edward VI and made Dean of Winchester.

Replenishment at sea (RAS) (North Atlantic Treaty Organisation/Commonwealth of Nations) or underway replenishment (UNREP) (U.S. Navy) is a method of transferring fuel, munitions, and stores from one ship to another while under way. First developed in the early 20th century it was used extensively by the United States Navy as a logistics support technique in the Pacific theatre of World War II, permitting U.S. carrier task forces to remain at sea indefinitely. History =Concept= HMS Captain in 1870, was slow and often hazardous. Prior to underway replenishment, coaling stations were the only way to refuel ships far from home. The Royal Navy had an unparalleled global logistics network of coaling stations and the world's largest collier fleet. This capability allowed the Navy to project naval power around the world and far from home ports. This had two disadvantages: the infrastructure was vulnerable to disruption or attack, and its use introduced a predictable pattern to naval operations that an enemy could exploit. Early attempts at refueling and restocking at sea had been made as early as 1870, when of the Channel Squadron was resupplied with coal at a rate of five tons per hour. The speed was too slow to be practicable, and calm weather was required to keep the neighbouring ships together. Lieutenant Robert Lowry was the first to suggest the use of large-scale underway replenishment techniques in an 1883 paper to the think tank Royal United Services Institute. He argued that a successful system would provide a minimum rate of 20 tons per hour while the ships maintain a speed of five knots. His proposal was for transfer to be effected through watertight coal carriers suspended from a cable between the two ships. Although his concept was rejected by the Admiralty, the advantages of such a system were made apparent to strategists on both sides of the Atlantic. Over 20 submissions were made to the RN between 1888 and 1890 alone. =First trials= Schematic for a Temperley transporter, a crane for hauling heavy loads, and used in early UR trials in 1898. The main technical problem was ensuring a constant distance between the two ships throughout the process. According to a report from The Times, a French collier had been able to provision two warships with 200 tons of coal at a speed of six knots using a Temperley transporter in 1898. The United States Navy also became interested in the potential of underway replenishment. Lacking a similar collier fleet and network of coaling stations, and embarking on a large naval expansion,Memorandum on the Urgent Necessity of an Adequate War Supply of Coal. 4 March 1910.USNA. RG. 80 Box 39 the Navy began conducting experiments in 1899 with a system devised by Spencer Miller and the Lidgerwood Manufacturing Company of New York. His device kept a cable suspended between the two ships taut, with a quick-release hook that could travel up and down the line with the use of a winch.\\"Coaling at Sea\\", The Engineer, Vol. 89, 27 July 1900. pp. 84-86. The first test of the device involved the collier and battleship . The RN embarked on more extensive trials in 1901, and achieved a rate of 19 tons per hour. To meet the requirement for a rate of at least 40 tons per hour, Miller implemented a series of improvements, such as improving the maintenance of tension of the cable, allowing heavier loads to be supported.Spencer Miller, Coaling of the USS Massachusetts at Sea. Transactions of the Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers, ( New York ) Vol. VIII, 1900. pp. 155-165 HMS Trafalgar and collier. Miller also collaborated with the British Temperley Company, producing an enhanced version, known as the Temperley-Miller system. RN trials with this new system in 1902 achieved an unprecedented average rate of 47 tons per hour and a peak rate of 60 tons per hour. The Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company also patented its \\"Express equipment\\", which delivered supplies to the broadside of the ship, instead of from the aft. The company offered the system to the Admiralty, claiming that it had achieved a rate of 150 tons per hour, but the offer was declined. A Royal Navy engineer, Metcalf, suggested an alternative system in 1903, where two cables were used, and the cable tension was maintained with the use of a steam ram. Trials were held in 1903, which demonstrated an optimal operating speed of 10 knots with a transfer rate of 54 tph.Report by Captain Wonham, 1905. NA. ADM 1/8727 Although it was a superior system and met with a formal endorsement from the Admiralty there is little evidence that such equipment was employed by any navy.Report of Conference on Coaling at Sea held at the Admiralty on 3 December 1906. NA. ADM 1/8004 In May 1905, the U.S. Navy tested an improved Miller-Lidgerwood rig using the Marcellus and the battleship near Cape Henry. These coaling tests achieved 35 tph while steaming at seven knots, which fell short of expectations. None of these coal systems approached the transfer rates required to make RAS practicable, considering that a battleship required over 2000 tons and a small destroyer required 200. As a result, it could take 60 hours or more to refuel a battleship, with both vessels steaming at five knots, during which time both were vulnerable to attack. =Trials with oil= With the transition to oil as the main fuel for ships at sea, underway replenishment became practicable since liquid could be continuously pumped posing fewer problems than the transfer of solids. In January 1906 the Royal Navy conducted experiments with transfers between the oiler Petroleum and the battleship . The oiler was towed astern of Victorious using a steel rope. Twenty-seven lengths of long hose were then connected between the ships. Experiments were undertaken with both bronze and steel hose attached to a three-inch wire jackstay, with another wire used as a traveling jackstay for the hose. As the Victorious was coal- fired, water instead of oil was pumped between the two vessels. The trial found that a transfer rate of 115 tons per hour could be achieved with the vessels traveling at speeds up to 12 knots in fine weather. The trial found that it took five hours to pass the hoses from the Petroleum to the Victorious, including a one-hour meal break, with it taking three hours to return the hoses to the oiler. The trial found that the oiler's replenishment mechanism had a tendency to break due to the high pumping pressures required. As a result of this trial the oiler Burma, which was launched in 1911, was the first oiler to be constructed to the order of the Admiralty and was designed for supplying destroyers with oil at sea as well as from alongside when in harbour. In August and September 1911 the Burma carried out refueling at sea trials at Portland with the destroyers , when 117 tons were transferred, with , when 270 tons were transferred, and with , when 105 tons were transferred. Astern refuelling was again employed, this time utilizing a hose which ran on wooden rollers suspended in stirrups from a jackstay. A later improvement was the use of a buoyant rubber hose, which trailed in the sea between the two ships. Despite proving the concept viable, the C-in-C Home Fleet reported that \\"the use of tanker vessels for oiling destroyers at sea was unlikely to be of service and that further trials were unnecessary\\". As a result, the Royal Navy preferred to continue to use fuelling alongside in harbour, rather than at sea until WWII. =Operational use= USS Maumee (AO-2) oiler achieved the first operational UR in 1917. In 1916 Chester Nimitz, executive officer and chief engineer of the United States Navy oiler USS Maumee, while the ship was stationed in Cuba, designed and jerry-rigged a riding-abeam refueling system with ship booms supporting rubber hoses between the oiler and the receiving destroyer with the assistance of G. B. Davis, Matt Higgins and Lieutenant F. M. Perkins. The system employed a towing hawser, two breast lines to prevent the rupture of the refueling hose between the two vessels, and lengths of rubber fuel hose. As well a fuel pump was used to speed up the transfer of fuel. Following the declaration of war, 6 April 1917, USS Maumee was assigned duty refueling at sea the destroyers being sent to Britain. Stationed about 300 miles south of Greenland, Maumee was ready for the second group of six U.S. ships to be sent as they closed on her on 28 May 1917. Following this first deployment, she transferred fuel to 34 destroyers over the course of a three-month period. These fuel transfers were made with only a separation between the moving ships. With the fueling of those destroyers, Maumee pioneered the Navy's underway refueling operations, thus establishing a pattern of mobile logistic support which would enable the Navy to keep its fleets at sea for extended periods, with a far greater range independent of the use of a friendly port.\\"U.S. Warships Refuel At Sea During Maneuvers\\" Popular Mechanics, August 1932 While during the interwar period most navies pursued the refueling of destroyers and other small vessels by either the alongside or astern method, it was the conventional wisdom that larger warships could neither be effectively refueled astern nor safely refueled alongside, until a series of tests conducted by now-Rear Admiral Nimitz in 1939‚Äì40 perfected the rigs and shiphandling which made the refueling of any size vessel practicable. Personnel transferred from by highline, 1960. This was used extensively as a logistics support technique in the Pacific theatre of World War II, permitting U.S. carrier task forces to remain at sea indefinitely. Given a sufficient quantity of oilers and forward fuel depots to supply them, neither of which were available in the South Pacific for most of 1942 Since it allowed extended range and striking capability to naval task forces the technique was classified so that enemy nations could not duplicate it.Note: one of the biggest surprises about the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 was the discovery that the Imperial Japanese Navy had developed underway refueling of its ships, even in heavy seas. In the 1950s and 1960s the U.S. Navy developed a multi-product supply ship that could deliver fuel, ammunition and stores while underway. These ships saw the introduction of a transfer system using a ram tensioner that keeps the highline between the ships tensioned, allowing for smooth transfer, as well as taking into account any movement of the ships. Over time this method evolved into the Standard Tensioned Replenishment Alongside Method (STREAM). The U.S. Navy also uses the spanwire rig, bye close-in rig, and spanline rig to transfer. The STREAM rig is preferred over other connected replenishment methods as it permits a greater separation between the ships. Germany used specialized submarines (so- called milk-cows) to supply hunter U-boats in the Atlantic during WWII. These were relatively ponderous. They required both submarines to be stationary on the surface, took a long time to transfer stores, and needed to be in radio contact with the replenished boat, making them easy targets. Due to this, those not sunk were soon retired from their supply role. Although time and effort has been invested in perfecting underway replenishment procedures, they are still hazardous operations. Presently, most underway replenishments for the U.S. Navy are handled by the Military Sealift Command. It is now used by most, if not all, blue-water navies. Methods There are several methods of performing an underway replenishment. =Alongside connected replenishment= Principle drawing showing probe arriving at bell-mouth, used for liquid transfers USS Manatee (AO-58) as the oiler, traveling at 12 knots, replenishes a U.S. battleship during the Battle of Okinawa, April‚ÄìJune 1945. The Royal Australian Navy replenishment vessel conducting a double underway replenishment with and , 2005. The alongside connected replenishment (CONREP) is a standard method of transferring liquids such as fuel and fresh water, along with ammunition and break bulk goods. In the 1950s and 1960s the U.S. Navy developed a multi-product supply ship that could deliver fuel, ammunition and stores while underway. These ships saw the introduction of a transfer system using a ram tensioner that keeps the highline between the ships tensioned, allowing for smooth transfer, as well as taking into account any movement of the ships in the water. Over time this method evolved into the Standard Tensioned Replenishment Alongside Method (STREAM). The STREAM rig is preferred over other connected replenishment methods as it permits a greater separation between the ships. The supplying ship holds a steady course and speed, generally between 12 and 16 knots. Moving at speed lessens relative motion due to wave action and allows better control of heading. The receiving ship then comes alongside the supplier at a distance of approximately 30 yards. A gunline, pneumatic line thrower, or shot line is fired from the supplier, which is used to pull across a messenger line. This line is used to pull across other equipment such as a distance line, phone line, and the transfer rig lines. As the command ship of the replenishment operation, the supply ship provides all lines and equipment needed for the transfer. Additionally, all commands are directed from the supply ship. Close-in fueling rig as used through World War II Because of the relative position of the ships, it is usual for larger ships to set up multiple transfer rigs, allowing for faster transfer or the transfer of multiple types of stores. Additionally, nearly all replenishment ships are set up to service two receivers at one time, with one being replenished on each side. Span-wire fueling rig as used since 1945 Most ships can receive replenishment on either side. Aircraft carriers of the U.S. Navy, however, always receive replenishment on the starboard side of the carrier. The design of an aircraft carrier, with its island/navigation bridge to starboard, does not permit replenishment to the carrier's port side. Alongside connected replenishment is a risky operation, as two or three ships running side by side at speed must hold to precisely the same course and speed for a long period of time. Moreover, the hydrodynamics of two ships running close together cause a suction between them. A slight steering error on the part of one of the ships could cause a collision, or part the transfer lines and fuel hoses. At a speed of 12 knots, a 1 degree variation in heading will produce a lateral speed of around 20 feet per minute. For this reason, experienced and qualified helmsmen are required during the replenishment, and the crew on the bridge must give their undivided attention to the ship's course and speed. The risk is increased when a replenishment ship is servicing two ships at once. In case of emergency, crews practice emergency breakaway procedures, where the ships will separate in less-than-optimal situations. Although the ships will be saved from collision, it is possible to lose stores, as the ships may not be able to finish the current transfer. Following successful completion of replenishment, many U.S. ships engage in the custom of playing a signature tune over the replenished vessel's PA system as they break away from the supplying vessel. In the Royal Australian Navy it is customary for ships to fly a special flag during the RAS operation, distinctive to each ship. As many ships are named for Australian towns and cities, it is often the case that they fly flags of AFL, NRL or A-League teams associated with that town or city. The flying of flags popularising brands of beer or other alcoholic beverages is also not uncommon. =Astern fueling= The earliest type of replenishment, rarely used today, is astern fueling. In this method, the receiving ship follows directly behind the supplying ship. The fuel-supplying ship throws a marker buoy into the sea and the receiving ship takes station with it. Then the delivering ship trails a hose in the water that the fuel-receiving ship retrieves and connects to. This method is more limited, as only one transfer rig can be set up. However, it is safer, as a slight course error will not cause a collision. U.S. Navy experiments with Cuyama and led the Navy to conclude that the rate of fuel transfer was too slow to be useful. But the astern method of refuelling was used by the German and Japanese Navies during World War II; and this method was still used by the Soviet navy for many decades thereafter. =Vertical replenishment= A SH-60 Sea Hawk transferring stores between ships, 2003. A third type of underway replenishment is vertical replenishment (VERTREP). In this method, a helicopter lifts cargo from the supplying ship and lowers it to the receiving ship. The main advantage of this method is that the ships do not need to be dangerously close to each other, so there is little risk of collision; VERTREP is also used to supplement and speed stores transfer between ships conducting CONREP. However, the maximum load and transfer speeds are both limited by the capacity of the helicopter, and fuel and other liquids cannot be supplied via VERTREP.

He began it at Vladimir Shilovsky's estate at Ussovo on 5 June and finished on 1 August at Verbovka. Dedicated to Shilovsky, the work is unique in Tchaikovsky's symphonic output in two ways: it is the only one of his seven symphonies (including the unnumbered Manfred Symphony) in a major key (discounting the unfinished Symphony in E major); and it is the only one to contain five movements (an additional Alla tedesca movement occurs between the opening movement and the slow movement). The symphony was premiered in Moscow on 19 November 1875, under the baton of Nikolai Rubinstein, at the first concert of the Russian Music Society's season. It had its premiere on 24 January 1876, under Eduard N√°pravn√≠k. Its first performance outside Russia was on 8 February 1879, at a concert of the New York Philharmonic Society. Its first performance in the United Kingdom was at the Crystal Palace in 1899, conducted by Sir August Manns, who seems to have been the first to refer to it as the \\"Polish Symphony\\", in reference to the recurring Polish dance rhythms prominent in the symphony's final movement. Several musicologists, including David Brown and Francis Maes, consider this name a faux pas. Western listeners, conditioned by Chopin's use of the polonaise as a symbol of Polish independence, interpreted Tchaikovsky's use of the same dance likewise; actually, in Tsarist Russia it was musical code for the Romanov dynasty and, by extension, Russian imperialism. The symphony was used by George Balanchine as the score for the Diamonds section of his full length 1967 ballet Jewels, omitting the opening movement. Instrumentation The work is scored for piccolo, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 2 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani and strings. On the symphony's instrumentation, musicologist Francis Maes writes that here, Tchaikovsky's \\"feeling for the magic of sound is revealed for the first time\\" and likens the music's \\"sensual opulence\\" to the more varied and finely shaded timbres of the orchestral suites. Wiley adds about this aspect, \\"Is the symphony a discourse or the play of sound? It revels in the moment.\\" Form Like Robert Schumann's Rhenish Symphony, the Third Symphony has five movements instead of the customary four in a suite-like formal layout, with a central slow movement flanked on either side by a scherzo.Keller, 344. The work also shares the Rhenish's overall tone of exuberant optimism. For these reasons, musicologist David Brown postulates that Tchaikovsky might have conceived the Third Symphony with the notion of what Schumann might have written had he been Russian.Brown, Crisis, 44; Maes, 78.Tchaikovsky was not the only Russian composer to use Schumann in general, or the Rhenish in particular, as a model. Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov acknowledged it as a reference when, as a naval cadet, he wrote his First Symphony; the work itself is closely patterned after Schumann's Fourth. The Rhenish, in fact, was one of two works that had most impressed Tchaikovsky during his student days at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory; the other was the Ocean Symphony by his teacher, Anton Rubinstein.Brown, Early, 63-4. The average performance of this symphony runs about 45 minutes.Cummings, allmusic.com. In his biography and analysis of Tchaikovsky's music, Roland John Wiley likens the five-movement format to a divertimento and questions whether Tchaikovsky wanted to allude in this work to the 18th century.Wiley, Tchaikovsky, 133. Such a move would not be unique or unprecedented in Tchaikovsky's work; David Brown points out in the 1980 edition of the New Grove that the composer occasionally wrote in a form of Mozartian pastiche throughout his career.Brown, New Grove (1980), 18:628. (The Variations on a Rococo Theme for cello and orchestra, which Wiley suggests by Tchaikovsky's use of the word Rococo in the title is his \\"first nominal gesture toward 18th century music,\\" is in fact a near-contemporary of the symphony.)Wiley, Tchaikovsky, 143. Musicologist Richard Taruskin makes a similar statement by calling the Third Symphony 'the first 'typical' [Tchaikovsky] symphony (and the first Mozartean one!) in the sense that it is the first to be thoroughly dominated by the dance.\\"Taruskin, Russian, 130. In explaining his analogy, Wiley points out how the composer holds back the full orchestra occasionally in a manner much like that of a concerto grosso, \\"the winds as concertino to the ripieno of the strings\\" in the first movement, the waltz theme and trio of the second movement and the trio of the fourth movement (in other words, the smaller group of winds balanced against the larger group of strings). The finale, Wiley states, does not decide which format Tchaikovsky may have actually had in mind. By adding a fugue and a reprise of the movement's second theme in the form of a recapitulation to the opening polonaise, Wiley says Tchaikovsky concludes the work on a note \\"more pretentious than a divertimento, less grand than a symphony, [and] leaves the work's genre identity suspended in the breach.\\" For other musicologists, the Schumannesque formal layout has been either a blessing or a curse. John Warrack admits the second movement, Alla tedesca, \\"balances\\" the work but he nonetheless senses \\"the conventional four-movement pattern being interrupted\\" unnecessarily, not amended in an organic manner.Warrack, Symphonies, 20-1. Brown notes that if Tchaikovsky amended the four-movement pattern because he felt it no longer adequate, his efforts proved unsuccessful.Brown, Final, 441. Hans Keller disagrees. Rather than a \\"regression\\" in symphonic form, Keller sees the five-movement form, along \\"with the introduction of dance rhythms into the material of every movement except the first,\\" as widening \\"the field of symphonic contrasts both within and between movements.\\"Keller, 344-5. Composition and initial performances Tchaikovsky recorded little about the composition of his Third Symphony. He penned the work quickly, between June and August 1875.Warrack, Symphonies, 20. After its premiere, he wrote Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, \\"As far as I can see this symphony presents no particularly successful ideas, but in workmanship it's a step forward.\\"As quoted in Brown, Crisis, 42. Not long before composing this symphony, Tchaikovsky had received a thorough drubbing from Nikolai Rubinstein over the flaws in his First Piano Concerto, the details of which he would later recount to his patroness, Nadezhda von Meck. This incident may have influenced Tchaikovsky to be more cautious in following academic protocol, at least in the symphony's outer movements.Brown, Crisis, 42. Eduard N√°pravn√≠k The symphony was premiered in Moscow in November 1875 under the baton of the composer's friend and champion, Nikolai Rubinstein. Tchaikovsky, who attended rehearsals and the performance, was \\"generally satisfied\\" but complained to Rimsky-Korsakov that the fourth movement \\"was played far from well as it could have been, had there been more rehearsals.\\"As quoted in Brown, Crisis, 52. The first performance in Saint Petersburg, given in February 1876 under Eduard N√°pravn√≠k, \\"went off very well and had a considerable success,\\" in the composer's estimation.As quoted in Brown, Crisis, 61. N√°pravn√≠k, who had conducted the first performance of the revised overture-fantasia Romeo and Juliet three years earlier,Brown, Early, 186. would become a major interpreter of Tchaikovsky's music. He would premiere five of the composer's operasBrown, Early, 226. and, among many traversals of the orchestral works, conduct the first performance of the Path√©tique symphony after Tchaikovsky's death.Brown, Final, 487. The first performance of the Third outside Russia was scheduled for October 1878 with the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra under Hans Richter. Richter, an admirer of Tchaikovsky's work, had already conducted Romeo and Juliet there in November 1876.Brown, Crisis, 102. However, after the symphony had been rehearsed, the Philharmonic Society cancelled the performance, citing the work's apparent difficulty and lack of public familiarity with the composer.Brown, Crisis, 241. The fact that Romeo had been hissed by the audience and unfavorably reviewed by Eduard Hanslick might have also contributed to its decision. The British premiere of the Third Symphony was led by Sir August Manns at the Crystal Palace in London in 1899. Manns dubbed the work with the sobriquet Polish at that time.Warrack, Symphonies, 20. Critical opinion The initial critical response to the Third Symphony in Russia was uniformly warm.Brown, Crisis, 66. However, over the long run, opinion has remained generally mixed, leaning toward negative. Among musicologists, Martin Cooper considers it \\"the weakest, most academic\\" of the seven the composer completed.Cooper, 30. Warrack notes a disjunction between the work's various musical elements. He writes that it \\"lacks the individuality of its fellows\\" and notes \\"a somewhat awkward tension between the regularity of a symphonic form he was consciously trying to achieve in a 'Germanic' way and his own characteristics.\\"Warrack, Symphonies, 20. Wiley, less polarizing, calls the Third the \\"least comformative\\" of the symphonies and admits its unorthodox structure and wide range of material \\"may produce an impression of strangeness, especially of genre.\\"Wiley, Tchaikovsky, 132. These factors, he says, make the Third difficult to categorize: \\"It is not folkish, nor classical, nor Berliozian/Lisztian, nor particularly Tchaikovskian in light of his other symphonies.\\" On the positive side of the spectrum, Keller calls the Third Symphony the composer's \\"freest and most fluent so far\\" and Maes dismisses naysayers of the piece as those who judge the quality of a Tchaikovsky composition \\"by the presence of lyric charm, and [reject] formal complexity ... as incompatible with the alleged lyric personality of the composer.\\"Maes, 78. Maes points out the symphony's \\"high degree of motivic and polyphonic intricacies,\\" which include the composer's use of asymmetrical phrases and a Schumannesque play of hemiolas against the normal rhythmic pattern of the first movement. He also notes the Third's \\"capricious rhythms and fanciful manipulation of musical forms,\\" which presage the music Tchaikovsky would write for his ballets (his first, Swan Lake, would be his next major work) and orchestral suites. Wiley seconds the stylistic nearness to the orchestral suites and notes that the creative freedom, beauty and lack of apparent internal logic between movements which is characteristic of those compositions also seems apparent in the symphony. Occupying the middle ground between these extremes, Brown deems the Third \\"the most inconsistent ... least satisfactory\\" of the symphonies and \\"badly flawed\\"Brown, Final, 150. but admits it is \\"not so devoid of 'particularly successful ideas' as the composer's own judgment would have us believe.\\"Brown, Crisis, 50. He surmises that Tchaikovsky, caught between the proscriptions of sonata form and his own lyric impulses, opted for the latter and \\"was at least wise enough not to attempt an amalgamation\\" of academic and melodic veins, which fundamentally worked against each other.Brown, Crisis, 30. The best parts of the symphony, he continues, are the three inner movements, where the composer allowed his gift for melody \\"its full unfettered exercise.\\" Brown says the symphony \\"discloses the widening dichotomy within Tchaikovsky's style, and powerfully proclaims the musical tensions that matched those within the man himself.\\"Brown, Crisis, 30. Controversy over the nickname \\"Polish\\" Western critics and audiences began calling this symphony the Polish after Sir August Manns led the first British performance in 1889, with the finale seen as an expression by the Polish people for their liberation from Russian domination and the reinstatement of their independence. Since this was the way Chopin had treated the dance in his works and people had heard them in that light for at least a generation, their interpretation of the finale of the Third Symphony in a similar manner was completely understandable. Unfortunately, it was also completely wrong. In Tsarist Russia, the polonaise was considered musical code for the Romanov dynasty and a symbol of Russian imperialism. In other words, Tchaikovsky's use of the polonaise was the diametric opposite to Chopin's.Figes, 274; Maes, 78-9, 137. This context for the dance began with Osip Kozlovsky (1757-1831) (Polish: J√≥zef Koz≈Çowski), a Pole who served in the Russian army and whose greatest successes as a composer were with his polonaises. To commemorate Russian victory over the Ottoman Empire in the Ukraine, Kozlovsky wrote a polonaise entitled \\"Thunder of Victory, Resound!\\" This set the standard for the polonaise as the preeminent genre for Russian ceremony.Maes, 78-9. One thing to keep in mind is that Tchaikovsky lived and worked in what was probably the last 18th-century feudal nation. This made his creative situation more akin to Mendelssohn or Mozart than to many of his European contemporaries.Figes, 274; Maes, 139-41. Because of this cultural mindset, Tchaikovsky saw no conflict in making his music accessible or palatable to his listeners, many of whom were among the Russian aristocracy and would eventually include Tsar Alexander III.Maes, 137; Taruskin, Grove Opera, 4:663. He remained highly sensitive to their concerns and expectations and searched constantly for new ways to meet them. Part of meeting his listeners' expectations was using the polonaise, which he did in several of his works, including the Third Symphony. Using it in the finale of a work could assure its success with Russian listeners. Maes, 137. Use in Jewels The symphony, without its first movement, was used by choreographer George Balanchine for Diamonds, the third and final part of his ballet Jewels. Created for the New York City Ballet, of which Balanchine was cofounder and founding choreographer, Jewels premiered on April 13, 1967 and is considered the first full-length abstract ballet.Reynolds, 247. Choreographed with ballerina Suzanne Farrell in mind and inspired by the unicorn tapestries in the Mus√©e de Cluny in Paris, Diamonds was meant to evoke the work of Marius Petipa at the Imperial Russian Ballet. Petipa collaborated with Tchaikovsky on the ballets The Sleeping Beauty and The Nutcracker, hence the use of Tchaikovsky's music in Diamonds.

The reverse situation, where professional military officers control national politics, is called a military dictatorship. A lack of control over the military may result in a state within a state. One author, paraphrasing Samuel P. Huntington's writings in The Soldier and the State, has summarized the civilian control ideal as \\"the proper subordination of a competent, professional military to the ends of policy as determined by civilian authority\\".Taylor, Edward R. Command in the 21st Century: An Introduction to Civil-Military Affairs (pdf), United States Navy Postgraduate School thesis. 1998: 30-32. Civilian control is often seen as a prerequisite feature of a stable liberal democracy. Use of the term in scholarly analyses tends to take place in the context of a democracy governed by elected officials, though the subordination of the military to political control is not unique to these societies. One example is the People's Republic of China. Mao Zedong stated that \\"Our principle is that the Party commands the gun, and the gun must never be allowed to command the Party,\\" reflecting the primacy of the Communist Party of China (and communist parties in general) as decision-makers in Marxist‚ÄìLeninist and Maoist theories of democratic centralism.Mao Zedong, English language translation by Marxists.org. Problems of War and Strategy. 1938. (See also: Wikiquote: Mao Zedong.) As noted by University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor Richard H. Kohn, \\"civilian control is not a fact but a process\\". Affirmations of respect for the values of civilian control notwithstanding, the actual level of control sought or achieved by the civilian leadership may vary greatly in practice, from a statement of broad policy goals that military commanders are expected to translate into operational plans, to the direct selection of specific targets for attack on the part of governing politicians. National Leaders with limited experience in military matters often have little choice but to rely on the advice of professional military commanders trained in the art and science of warfare to inform the limits of policy; in such cases, the military establishment may enter the bureaucratic arena to advocate for or against a particular course of action, shaping the policy-making process and blurring any clear cut lines of civilian control.  Rationales  Admiral John B. Nathman (far right) and Admiral William J. Fallon salute during honors arrival of Secretary of the Navy Gordon R. England at a change of command ceremony in 2005. A subordinate of the civilian Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Navy is the civilian Head of the Department of the Navy, which includes the U.S. Navy and the Marine Corps. Advocates of civilian control generally take a Clausewitzian view of war, emphasizing its political character. The words of Georges Clemenceau, \\"War is too serious a matter to entrust to military men\\" (also frequently rendered as \\"War is too important to be left to the generals\\"), wryly reflect this view. Given that broad strategic decisions, such as the decision to declare a war, start an invasion, or end a conflict, have a major impact on the citizens of the country, they are seen by civilian control advocates as best guided by the will of the people (as expressed by their political representatives), rather than left solely to an elite group of tactical experts. The military serves as a special government agency, which is supposed to implement, rather than formulate, policies that require the use of certain types of physical force. Kohne succinctly summarizes this view when he writes that: > The point of civilian control is to make security subordinate to the larger > purposes of a nation, rather than the other way around. The purpose of the > military is to defend society, not to define it. A state's effective use of force is an issue of great concern for all national leaders, who must rely on the military to supply this aspect of their authority. The danger of granting military leaders full autonomy or sovereignty is that they may ignore or supplant the democratic decision-making process, and use physical force, or the threat of physical force, to achieve their preferred outcomes; in the worst cases, this may lead to a coup or military dictatorship. A related danger is the use of the military to crush domestic political opposition through intimidation or sheer physical force, interfering with the ability to have free and fair elections, a key part of the democratic process. This poses the paradox that \\"because we fear others we create an institution of violence to protect us, but then we fear the very institution we created for protection\\".Peter D. Feaver. 1996. \\"The Civil- Military Problematique: Huntington, Janowitz and the Question of Civilian Control.\\" Armed Forces & Society. 23(2): 149‚Äì78. Also, military personnel, because of the nature of their job, are much more willing to use force to settle disputes than civilians because they are trained military personnel that specialize strictly in warfare. The military is authoritative and hierarchical, rarely allowing discussion and prohibiting dissention. For instance, in the Empire of Japan, prime ministers and almost everyone in high positions were military people like Hideki Tojo, and advocated and basically pressured the leaders to start military conflicts against China and others because they believed that they would ultimately be victorious. =Liberal theory and they were the American Founding Fathers= Many of the Founding Fathers of the United States were suspicious of standing militaries. As Samuel Adams wrote in 1768, \\"Even when there is a necessity of the military power, within a land, a wise and prudent people will always have a watchful and jealous eye over it\\".Cairo, Michael F. Democracy Papers: Civilian Control of the Military, U.S. Department of State International Information Programs. Even more forceful are the words of Elbridge Gerry, a delegate to the American Constitutional Convention, who wrote that \\"[s]tanding armies in time of peace are inconsistent with the principles of republican Governments, dangerous to the liberties of a free people, and generally converted into destructive engines for establishing despotism.\\" In Federalist No. 8, one of The Federalist papers documenting the ideas of some of the Founding Fathers, Alexander Hamilton expressed concern that maintaining a large standing army would be a dangerous and expensive undertaking. In his principal argument for the ratification of the proposed constitution, he argued that only by maintaining a strong union could the new country avoid such a pitfall. Using the European experience as a negative example and the British experience as a positive one, he presented the idea of a strong nation protected by a navy with no need of a standing army. The implication was that control of a large military force is, at best, difficult and expensive, and at worst invites war and division. He foresaw the necessity of creating a civilian government that kept the military at a distance. James Madison, another writer of many of The Federalist papers,Gottfried Dietze. 1960. The Federalist: A Classic on Federalism and Free Government. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press. expressed his concern about a standing military in comments before the Constitutional Convention in June 1787: > In time of actual war, great discretionary powers are constantly given to > the Executive Magistrate. Constant apprehension of War, has the same > tendency to render the head too large for the body. A standing military > force, with an overgrown Executive, will not long be safe companions to > liberty. The means of defense against foreign danger, have been always the > instruments of tyranny at home. Among the Romans it was a standing maxim to > excite a war, whenever a revolt was apprehended. Throughout all Europe, the > armies kept up under the pretext of defending, have enslaved the people. Max > Farrand. 1911. Records of the Federal Convention of 1787. New Haven: Yale > University Press. 1:465. The United States Constitution placed considerable limitations on the legislature. Coming from a tradition of legislative superiority in government, many were concerned that the proposed Constitution would place so many limitations on the legislature that it would become impossible for such a body to prevent an executive from starting a war. Hamilton argued in Federalist No. 26 that it would be equally as bad for a legislature to be unfettered by any other agency and that restraints would actually be more likely to preserve liberty. James Madison, in Federalist No. 47, continued Hamilton's argument that distributing powers among the various branches of government would prevent any one group from gaining so much power as to become unassailable. In Federalist No. 48, however, Madison warned that while the separation of powers is important, the departments must not be so far separated as to have no ability to control the others. Finally, in Federalist No. 51, Madison argued that to create a government that relied primarily on the good nature of the incumbent to ensure proper government was folly. Institutions must be in place to check incompetent or malevolent leaders. Most importantly, no single branch of government ought to have control over any single aspect of governing. Thus, all three branches of government must have some control over the military, and the system of checks and balances maintained among the other branches would serve to help control the military. Hamilton and Madison thus had two major concerns: (1) the detrimental effect on liberty and democracy of a large standing army and (2) the ability of an unchecked legislature or executive to take the country to war precipitously. These concerns drove American military policy for the first century and a half of the country's existence. While armed forces were built up during wartime, the pattern after every war up to and including World War II was to demobilize quickly and return to something approaching pre-war force levels. However, with the advent of the Cold War in the 1950s, the need to create and maintain a sizable peacetime military force \\"engendered new concerns\\" of militarism and about how such a large force would affect civil‚Äìmilitary relations in the United States.Donald S. Inbody. 2009. Grand Army of the Republic or Grand Army of the Republicans? Political Party and Ideological Preferences of American Enlisted Personnel. Faculty Publications ‚Äì Political Science. Paper 51. =Domestic law enforcement= The United States' Posse Comitatus Act, passed in 1878, prohibits any part of the Army or the Air Force (since the U.S. Air Force evolved from the U.S. Army) from engaging in domestic law enforcement activities unless they do so pursuant to lawful authority. Similar prohibitions apply to the Navy and Marine Corps by service regulation, since the actual Posse Comitatus Act does not apply to them. The Coast Guard is exempt from Posse Comitatus since it normally operates under the Department of Homeland Security versus the Department of Defense and enforces U.S. laws, even when operating as a service with the U.S. Navy. The act is often misunderstood to prohibit any use of federal military forces in law enforcement, but this is not the case. For example, the President has explicit authority under the Constitution and federal law to use federal forces or federalized militias to enforce the laws of the United States. The act's primary purpose is to prevent local law enforcement officials from utilizing federal forces in this way by forming a \\"posse\\" consisting of federal Soldiers or Airmen.Hendell, Garri B. \\"\\" \\"Domestic Use of the Armed Forces to Maintain Law and Order‚Äîposse comitatus Pitfalls at the Inauguration of the 44th President\\" Publius (2011) 41(2): 336-348 first published online May 6, 2010 There are, however, practical political concerns in the United States that make the use of federal military forces less desirable for use in domestic law enforcement. Under the U.S. Constitution, law and order is primarily a matter of state concern. As a practical matter, when military forces are necessary to maintain domestic order and enforce the laws, state militia forces under state control i.e., that state's Army National Guard and/or Air National Guard are usually the force of first resort, followed by federalized state militia forces i.e., the Army National Guard and/or Air National Guard \\"federalized\\" as part of the U.S. Army and/or U.S. Air Force, with active federal forces (to include \\"federal\\" reserve component forces other than the National Guard) being the least politically palatable option. =NATO and EU member states= Strong democratic control of the military is a prerequisite for membership in NATO. Strong democracy and rule of law, implying democratic control of the military, are prerequisites for membership in the European Union. =Maoist approach= Maoist military-political theories of people's war and democratic centralism also support the subordination of military forces to the directives of the communist party (although the guerrilla experience of many early leading Communist Party of China figures may make their status as civilians somewhat ambiguous). In a 1929 essay On Correcting Mistaken Ideas in the Party, Mao explicitly refuted \\"comrades [who] regard military affairs and politics as opposed to each other and [who] refuse to recognize that military affairs are only one means of accomplishing political tasks\\", prescribing increased scrutiny of the People's Liberation Army by the Party and greater political training of officers and enlistees as a means of reducing military autonomy.Mao Zedong, English language translation by Marxists.org. On Correcting Mistaken Ideas in the Party. 1929. In Mao's theory, the military‚Äîwhich serves both as a symbol of the revolution and an instrument of the dictatorship of the proletariat‚Äîis not merely expected to defer to the direction of the ruling non-uniformed Party members (who today exercise control in the People's Republic of China through the Central Military Commission), but also to actively participate in the revolutionary political campaigns of the Maoist era.  Methods of asserting civilian control  An immensely popular hero of World War II, General Douglas MacArthur's public insistence on the need to expand the Korean War, over the objections of President Harry S. Truman, led to the termination of his command. Civilian leaders cannot usually hope to challenge their militaries by means of force, and thus must guard against any potential usurpation of powers through a combination of policies, laws, and the inculcation of the values of civilian control in their armed services. The presence of a distinct civilian police force, militia, or other paramilitary group may mitigate to an extent the disproportionate strength that a country's military possesses; civilian gun ownership has also been justified on the grounds that it prevents potential abuses of power by authorities (military or otherwise). Opponents of gun control have cited the need for a balance of power in order to enforce the civilian control of the military. =A civilian commander-in-chief= The establishment of a civilian head of state, head of government or other government figure as the military's commander-in-chief within the chain of command is one legal construct for the propagation of civilian control. In the United States, Article I of the Constitution gives the Congress the power to declare war (in the War Powers Clause), while Article II of the Constitution establishes the President as the commander-in-chief. Ambiguity over when the President could take military action without declaring war resulted in the War Powers Resolution of 1973. American presidents have used the power to dismiss high-ranking officers as a means to assert policy and strategic control. Three examples include Abraham Lincoln's dismissal of George McClellan in the American Civil War when McClellan failed to pursue the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia following the Battle of Antietam, Harry S. Truman relieving Douglas MacArthur of command in the Korean War after MacArthur repeatedly contradicted the Truman administration's stated policies on the war's conduct, and Barack Obama's acceptance of Stanley McChrystal's resignation in the War in Afghanistan after a Rolling Stone article was published where he mocked several members of the Obama administration, including Vice President Joe Biden. = Composition of the military = Differing opinions exist as to the desirability of distinguishing the military as a body separate from the larger society. In The Soldier and the State, Huntington argued for what he termed \\"objective civilian control\\", \\"focus[ing] on a politically neutral, autonomous, and professional officer corps\\". This autonomous professionalism, it is argued, best inculcates an esprit de corps and sense of distinct military corporateness that prevents political interference by sworn servicemen and -women. Conversely, the tradition of the citizen-soldier holds that \\"civilianizing\\" the military is the best means of preserving the loyalty of the armed forces towards civilian authorities, by preventing the development of an independent \\"caste\\" of warriors that might see itself as existing fundamentally apart from the rest of society. In the early history of the United States, according to Michael Cairo, > [the] principle of civilian control... embodied the idea that every > qualified citizen was responsible for the defense of the nation and the > defense of liberty, and would go to war, if necessary. Combined with the > idea that the military was to embody democratic principles and encourage > citizen participation, the only military force suitable to the Founders was > a citizen militia, which minimized divisions between officers and the > enlisted. In a less egalitarian practice, societies may also blur the line between \\"civilian\\" and \\"military\\" leadership by making direct appointments of non- professionals (frequently social elites benefitting from patronage or nepotism) to an officer rank. A more invasive method, most famously practiced in the Soviet Union and People's Republic of China, involves active monitoring of the officer corps through the appointment of political commissars, posted parallel to the uniformed chain of command and tasked with ensuring that national policies are carried out by the armed forces. The regular rotation of soldiers through a variety of different postings is another effective tool for reducing military autonomy, by limiting the potential for soldiers' attachment to any one particular military unit. Some governments place responsibility for approving promotions or officer candidacies with the civilian government, requiring some degree of deference on the part of officers seeking advancement through the ranks. = Technological developments = During the term of Lyndon B. Johnson, the President and his advisors often chose specific bombing targets in Vietnam on the basis of larger geopolitical calculations, without professional knowledge of the weapons or tactics. Apropos of LBJ's direction of the bombing campaign in Vietnam, no air warfare specialists attended the Tuesday lunches at which the targeting decisions were made.\\"Washington's Management of the Rolling Thunder Campaign\\", M. Jacobsen, US Naval Historical Center Colloquium on Contemporary History Project Historically, direct control over military forces deployed for war was hampered by the technological limits of command, control, and communications; national leaders, whether democratically elected or not, had to rely on local commanders to execute the details of a military campaign, or risk centrally-directed orders' obsolescence by the time they reached the front lines. The remoteness of government from the action allowed professional soldiers to claim military affairs as their own particular sphere of expertise and influence; upon entering a state of war, it was often expected that the generals and field marshals would dictate strategy and tactics, and the civilian leadership would defer to their informed judgments. Improvements in information technology and its application to wartime command and control (a process sometimes labeled the \\"Revolution in Military Affairs\\") has allowed civilian leaders removed from the theater of conflict to assert greater control over the actions of distant military forces. Precision-guided munitions and real-time videoconferencing with field commanders now allow the civilian leadership to intervene even at the tactical decision-making level, designating particular targets for destruction or preservation based on political calculations or the counsel of non-uniformed advisors. = Restrictions on Political Activities = In the United States the Hatch Act of 1939 does not directly apply to the military, however, Department of Defense Directive 1344.10 (DoDD 1344.10) essentially applies the same rules to the military. This helps to ensure a non-partisan military and ensure smooth and peaceful transitions of power. = Political officers = Political officers screened for appropriate ideology have been integrated into supervisory roles within militaries as a way to maintain the control by political rulers. Historically they are associated most strongly with the Soviet Union and China rather than liberal democracies.  Military dislike of political directives  While civilian control forms the normative standard in almost every society outside of military dictatorships, its practice has often been the subject of pointed criticism from both uniformed and non-uniformed observers, who object to what they view as the undue \\"politicization\\" of military affairs, especially when elected officials or political appointees micromanage the military, rather than giving the military general goals and objectives (like \\"Defeat Country X\\"), and letting the military decide how best to carry those orders out. By placing responsibility for military decision-making in the hands of non-professional civilians, critics argue, the dictates of military strategy are subsumed to the political, with the effect of unduly restricting the fighting capabilities of the nation's armed forces for what should be immaterial or otherwise lower priority concerns. =Case study: United States= The \\"Revolt of the Admirals\\" that occurred in 1949 was an attempt by senior US Navy personnel, to force a change in budgets directly opposed to the directives given by the Civilian leadership. U.S. President Bill Clinton faced frequent allegations throughout his time in office (particularly after the Battle of Mogadishu) that he was ignoring military goals out of political and media pressure‚Äîa phenomenon termed the \\"CNN effect\\". Politicians who personally lack military training and experience but who seek to engage the nation in military action may risk resistance and being labeled \\"chickenhawks\\" by those who disagree with their political goals. In contesting these priorities, members of the professional military leadership and their non-uniformed supporters may participate in the bureaucratic bargaining process of the state's policy- making apparatus, engaging in what might be termed a form of regulatory capture as they attempt to restrict the policy options of elected officials when it comes to military matters. An example of one such set of conditions is the \\"Weinberger Doctrine\\", which sought to forestall another American intervention like that which occurred in the Vietnam War (which had proved disastrous for the morale and fighting integrity of the U.S. military) by proposing that the nation should only go to war in matters of \\"vital national interest\\", \\"as a last resort\\", and, as updated by Weinberger's disciple Colin Powell, with \\"overwhelming force\\". The process of setting military budgets forms another contentious intersection of military and non-military policy, and regularly draws active lobbying by rival military services for a share of the national budget. Nuclear weapons in the U.S. are controlled by the civilian United States Department of Energy, not by the Department of Defense. During the 1990s and 2000s, public controversy over LGBT policy in the U.S. military led to many military leaders and personnel being asked for their opinions on the matter and being given deference although the decision was ultimately not theirs to make. During his tenure, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld raised the ire of the military by attempting to reform its structure away from traditional infantry and toward a lighter, faster, more technologically driven force. In April 2006, Rumsfeld was severely criticized by some retired military officers for his handling of the Iraq War, while other retired military officers came out in support of Rumsfeld. Although no active military officers have spoken out against Rumsfeld, the actions of these officers is still highly unusual. Some news accounts have attributed the actions of these generals to the Vietnam war experience, in which officers did not speak out against the administration's handling of military action. Later in the year, immediately after the November elections in which the Democrats gained control of the Congress, Rumsfeld resigned.

The original Battlesystem was printed as a boxed set in 1985 for use with the first edition AD&D; rules. For the second edition of AD&D;, a new version of Battesystem was printed as a softcover book in 1989. First edition =Contents= Battlesystem was first released in 1985, compatible with either Advanced Dungeons & Dragons or the Basic / Expert Dungeons & Dragons (see editions of Dungeons & Dragons). The game was promoted as a successor to Chainmail.\\"With the BATTLESYSTEM game, the AD&D; and D&D; games go back to their roots\\" (Niles 1985a:1) In a Battlesystem game, each miniature represents a hero, a commander, or multiple troops, depending on the troops' level or hit dice.(Niles 1985a:2) There are no statistics in the game for any troops or characters, but, instead, all are derived from the relevant Dungeons & Dragons publications. For instance, to add any creature from the Monster Manual or similar publications as troops, its in-game point cost can be derived from the XP reward listed in the Monster Manual for killing the creature.(Niles 1985a:31) The first edition of Battlesystem was a set of rules and components for use in running mass fantasy battles, involving miniatures rules using metal or cardstock figures, or counters. The first edition set included rules with two levels of complexity, four scenarios, a guide to miniatures, cardboard figures, and over 800 counters. It was meant to be used with either the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons game or the simpler Dungeons & Dragons rule book sets available at the time. The first edition of Battlesystem was sold as a box set which contained:As listed on box and in Game Parts section (Niles 1985a:1) *32-page rule book *24-page scenario book *16-page guide to miniatures *2 Player Aid Cards *2 Metal Miniature Generals *3-D Adventure foldup Figures *Army Roster Sheets *801 die-cut counters The Rulebook is divided into four parts, allowing three levels of play. The first part is an introduction. The second part, called \\"The Basic Game\\", covers the basic rules of movement and melee combat.(Niles 1985a:8) The third part, \\"The Intermediate Game\\", adds missiles, artillery, cavalry, individual Heroes, special formations and terrain effects.(Niles 1985a:16) The fourth part, called \\"The Advanced Game\\", allows for magic, flying, weather, night battles and special monsters. It also introduces campaign rules that allow for integration of Battlesystem games into a role-playing campaign.(Niles 1985a:20) The game does not require a Dungeon Master, although the Rulebook recommends use of a referee, especially if using certain magics such as invisibility or illusions.(Niles 1985a:1) The Scenario Book contains four scenarios. Three of the scenarios form a linked campaign in a generic fantasy setting, one for each level of the game. The fourth is an advanced game scenario for Dragonlance, Battle of Qualinost. It takes place during the same time period as DL2 Dragons of Flame, while the heroes are in Pax Tharkas.(Niles 1985b) According to the game's rules, it was designed to be played with either 25 mm or 15 mm miniatures. The game, however, does not require a certain size of miniatures. The official Battlesystem miniatures released at the time, except for two in the box set, were all 15 mm. At the time, many companies producing 25 mm figures were starting to make larger figures, sometimes even officially called as 'Heroic 25 mm' or 28 mm, that were difficult to fit or didn't fit on the official Battlesystem base sizes. =Publication history= The first edition Battlesystem set, designed by Douglas Niles and Steve Winter, was published in 1985. It featured a cover by Jeff Easley. =Reception= Roger Musson reviewed the original boxed set in Imagine magazine, giving it a positive review. He noted that the rules are fairly easy to use, although there are \\"some omissions and rules buried in odd places\\". Musson thought that \\"no self-respecting DM will want to be without the Battlesystem rules\\", although he found the other contents of the box of somewhat mixed value. Overall, Musson felt that the package is \\"to be welcomed\\" and that it \\"may provide a good introduction for many to the world of fantasy-wargaming\\". Graeme Davis reviewed the original Battlesystem for White Dwarf, giving it a rating of 8/10 overall. He called the rules \\"concise and well-written\\". He felt that as a supplement to the D&D; game, \\"the Battle System does what it sets out to do and does it very well; it may not be as detailed as some fantasy wargame rules, but it is adequate for the requirements of most role- players and can be used quite easily by anyone familiar with D&D; or AD&D;\\". Davis concluded by stating that \\"Battle System deserves to be given a chance, but I'm afraid that it may have priced itself out the market from the start.\\" The original Battlesystem set won the H.G. Wells award. Second edition =Contents= The second edition of Battlesystem removed the counters, concentrating solely on miniatures. In the second edition, a figure represents either: 1) 10 infantrymen or cavalry, or 2) a single hero or other special individual, rated for Attack Dice, Armor Rating, Hits, Morale, and Movement, all derived from their corresponding statistics in the AD&D; game. A character's THAC0 and maximum damage, for instance, determine his Attack Dice, while his armor class determines his Armor Rating. A figure's Attack Dice rating indicates the type of die it uses when attacking, from a low of 1d4 to a high of 1d12. In general, each figure in an attacking group is allowed one attack die; a group of eight figures with an Attack Dice rating of 6 rolls 8d6. The higher the roll, the more hits inflicted. The defending player rolls a number of dice equal to the number of successful hits; every roll exceeding the defender's Armor Rating cancels one hit. All hits not canceled by the Armor Rating rolls are taken as casualties. The magic chapter is about seven pages long, most of it devoted to descriptions of spell effects. The book features glossy, full-color photos of painted miniatures, many of them staged in elaborate battlefield dioramas. One of the more significant changes was making the use of 25 mm miniatures as standard. According to the rules, 15 mm could still be used, but the base size was increased to allow for larger miniatures. Additionally, all photographs in the rule book were of 25 mm miniatures. =Publication history= The second edition of Battlesystem was published in 1989, revised for use with 2nd edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons. It was designed by Douglas Niles and featured a cover by Glen Taranowski. This version was a 128-page softcover book. Editing and development was by Kim Mohan, Jon Pickens, and Dave Sutherland. Photography was by Michael Weaver and Ral Partha Enterprises, Inc. for the battle scenes, and Dick Kahn Studio, Inc. for the rules diagrams. Figure painting was by Dave Sutherland, with interior art by Jeff Easley and Keith Parkinson, and graphic design by Stephanie Tabat and Dave Sutherland. The second edition of Battlesystem became available in the form of two books called Battlesystem (1989) and Battlesystem Skirmishes (1991). Despite positive reviews, sales for the set were disappointing. This led to it not being actively supported and used in role playing systems such as Dark Sun for very long even though the Dark Sun setting had been developed with the intent of holding large-scale battles.Johnson, Harold; Winter, Steve; Adkinson, Peter; Stark, Ed; and Peter Archer. 30 Years of Adventure: A Celebration of Dungeons and Dragons. Wizards of the Coast, Inc, 2004, pages 130-138. The 1992 Dragon Kings hardcover book, for example, included Battlesystem options, even though game designer Rick Swan considered them \\"useful but nonessential\\". =Reception= The game won the 1989 Origins Award for \\"Best Miniatures Rules of 1989\\". Rick Swan reviewed Battlesystem for Dragon magazine #178 (February 1992). Swan declared both the second edition Battlesystem and Battlesystem Skirmishes books \\"flat-out gorgeous, two of the best-looking products TSR, Inc. has ever published\\", and that they both \\"make terrific guides for figure painting and are a pleasure to thumb through, even for those with only a passing interest in miniatures games\\". Swan suggests that players \\"frustrated by the tentative systems in the first-edition Battlesystem game\\" would be \\"in for a pleasant surprise with the second edition, a complete overhaul that's as impressive as the 1st-to-2nd Edition transformation of the Player's Handbook and Dungeon Master's Guide. Gone from the original game are the math-heavy combat tables, the awkward base sizes, and the quarter-page unit rosters; they're replaced by streamlined bookkeeping systems, cleaner attack procedures, and a plethora of clever options. Particularly welcome is the reduction of relevant statistics from a dozen-plus to a mere five.\\" Swan felt that \\"the conversions are sound, if a bit convoluted, and produce acceptable results on the battlefield\\". He also felt that any players \\"willing to swallow the compromises inherent in the system will find the basic rules elegant and satisfying\\". He felt that while it was not unusual to roll a lot of dice to resolve a single combat engagement, \\"the system is preferable to the dreary bookkeeping required by too many miniatures games\\". He considered the magic system \\"Less successful\\", in that it \\"doesn't translate from the AD&D; game as well as the combat rules, and that the descriptions of spell effects are \\"sketchy\\" and the spell list is \\"woefully incomplete\\" with fewer than 20 wizard spells discussed. Swan concluded the review by saying: \\"Even though it emphasizes the military aspect more than the magical, the Battlesystem game scores as a first-class miniatures game; engaging, challenging, and - considering its scope - surprisingly easy to manage. The Battlesystem Skirmishes game succeeds in smoothing over the rough spots in the AD&D; combat rules, but it reaches the point of diminishing returns in battles approaching several dozen figures per side; at that point, you might as well use the Battlesystem rules. For its versatility and sheer volume of material, the Battlesystem book has the edge over the Battlesystem Skirmishes rules, but both books are recommended to AD&D; combat aficionados and especially to students of figure painting - these photos are real knock-outs.\\" Notes References * * from Battlesystem: Fantasy Combat Supplement Boxed set. * from Battlesystem: Fantasy Combat Supplement Boxed set.  * from Battlesystem: Fantasy Combat Supplement Boxed set. * Further reading *\\"Sage Advice\\", Dragon #132.

It has a small beach which was awarded the Blue flag rural beach award in 2005. A large car park adjoins the beach, where in the summer an ice cream van can usually be found. The beach also has public toilets which are open from Easter to October half-term. The Pembrokeshire Coast Path gives fine walking in both directions. The Common which runs inland behind the beach lies within the Manor of Llanrhian. Following the coast path north leads to Porthgain. Abereiddi to Porthgain is roughly a forty-minute walk. The coastal path taken in the other direction to the south east goes around St Davids Head and on to Whitesands Bay.  The Blue Lagoon  Nearby are the ruins of the 'Blue Lagoon', a small slate quarry, now flooded by the sea having broken in. Initially slate was exported across Abereiddi beach, but later through a tramway to the harbour at Porthgain a couple of miles to the North. Although never as large a quarry as even those nearer Porthgain itself, it did operate a steam-hauled lift. Ruins of a small group of slate houses known as The Street remain near the beach. These were houses built for the quarry workers of the Blue Lagoon and was only abandoned after a flood in the early 20th century. The Blue Lagoon is 25m deep, according to a nearby Pembrokeshire National Park information board. Despite the name, the water is always a distinct greenish hue, owing to the mineral content within the quarry. The lagoon is a favourite for adventure groups practising coasteering, and also diving when the weather is bad.West Wales Diving School  World diving championships  In September 2012 the Blue Lagoon at Abereiddi was the location for one of the stages of the Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series, making its UK debut.

To the north, the succession passes up into beds of Llandeilo age, and ultimately the foreshore which consists of alternating beds of Caradocian limestone and shale. North over the northern headland, there is a small cove eroded in up-faulted Didymograptus bifidus beds. This is a fault and the disused Porth Gain Slate Quarry provides excellent exposures. Fossil collectors tend to look out for the Ordovician shales wedged in between the cliffs. Fortunately, chunks of shale regularly fall out of the cliffs onto the beach. Consequently, fossil collecting is easier done by walking down onto the beach and looking for the soft, flaky shales.

The assassination was done in revenge for the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in Amritsar in 1919, for which O'Dwyer was responsible. Singh was subsequently tried and convicted of murder and hanged in July 1940. While in custody, he used the name Ram Mohammad Singh Azad, which represents the three major religions of Punjab and his anti-colonial sentiment. Udham Singh is a well-known figure of the Indian independence movement. He is also referred to as Shaheed-i-Azam Sardar Udham Singh (the expression \\"Shaheed-i-Azam\\", means \\"the great martyr\\"). A district (Udham Singh Nagar) of Uttarakhand was named after him to pay homage in October 1995 by the Mayawati government. Early life Udham Singh Kamboj was born as Sher Singh on 26 December 1899 at Sunam, Sangrur district of Punjab, India in a Kamboj-Sikh family. His father, Sardar Tehal Singh Jammu, was a farmer and also worked as the railway crossing watchman in the village of Upalli. After his father's death, Singh and his elder brother, Mukta Singh, were taken in by the Central Khalsa Orphanage Putlighar in Amritsar. At the orphanage, Singh was administered the Sikh initiatory rites and received the name of Udham Singh. He passed his matriculation examination in 1918 and left the orphanage in 1919. Massacre at Jallianwala Bagh A wide view of the Jallianwala Bagh memorial On 10 April 1919, a number of local leaders allied to the Indian National Congress including Satya Pal and Saifuddin Kitchlew were arrested under the Rowlatt Act. Protestors against the arrests were fired on by British troops, precipitating a riot. On 13 April, over twenty thousand unarmed People were assembled in Jallianwala Bagh, Amritsar to protest against the act. Udham Singh and his friends from the orphanage were serving water to the crowd. Udham Singh became involved in revolutionary politics and was deeply influenced by Bhagat Singh and his revolutionary group. In 1924, Udham Singh became involved with the Ghadar Party, organising Indians overseas towards overthrowing colonial rule. In 1927, he returned to India on orders from Bhagat Singh, bringing 25 associates as well as revolvers and ammunition. Soon after, he was arrested for possession of unlicensed arms. Revolvers, ammunition, and copies of a prohibited Ghadar Party paper called \\"Ghadr-i- Gunj\\" (\\"Voice of Revolt\\") were confiscated. He was prosecuted and sentenced to five years in prison. Upon his release from prison in 1931, Singh's movements were under constant surveillance by the Punjab police. He made his way to Kashmir, where he was able to evade the police and escape to Germany. In 1934, he reached London, where he found employment as an engineer. Privately, he formed plans to assassinate Michael O'Dwyer. In Singh's diaries for 1939 and 1940, he occasionally misspells O'Dwyer's surname as \\"O'Dyer\\", leaving a possibility he may have confused O'Dwyer with General Dyer.The Murders of the Black Museum: 1870-1970 p. 364 Shooting in Caxton Hall On 13 March 1940, Michael O'Dwyer was scheduled to speak at a joint meeting of the East India Association and the Central Asian Society (now Royal Society for Asian Affairs) at Caxton Hall, London. Singh concealed inside his jacket pocket a revolver he had earlier purchased from a soldier in a pub,The Murders of the Black Museum: 1870-1970 p. 365 then entered the hall and found an open seat. As the meeting concluded, Singh shot O'Dwyer twice as he moved towards the speaking platform. One of these bullets passed through O'Dwyer's heart and right lung, killing him almost instantly. Others injured in the shooting included Sir Louis Dane, Lawrence Dundas, 2nd Marquess of Zetland,Glasgow Herald 19 March 1940 and Charles Cochrane-Baillie, 2nd Baron Lamington. Singh surrendered immediately after the shooting.The Black Museum pp. 364-365 Murder trial and execution Udham Singh (second from the left) being taken from 10 Caxton Hall after the assassination of Michael O'Dwyer On 1 April 1940, Udham Singh was formally charged with the murder of Michael O'Dwyer, and remanded in custody at Brixton Prison. Initially asked to explain his motivations, Singh stated: I did it because I had a grudge against him. He deserved it. I don't belong to society or anything else. I don't care. I don't mind dying. What is the use of waiting until you get old? ... Is Zetland dead? He ought to be. I put two into him? I bought the revolver from a soldier in a public house. My parents died when I was three or four. ... Only one dead? I thought I could get more.The Murders of the Black Museum: 1870-1970 pp. 364-365 While in custody, he called himself \\"Ram Mohammad Singh Azad\\": the first three words of the name reflect the three major religious communities of Punjab (Hindu, Muslim, and Sikh); the last word \\"azad\\" (literally \\"free\\") reflects his anti-colonial sentiment. While awaiting his trial, Singh went on a 42-day hunger strike and was force fed. On 4 June 1940, his trial commenced at the Central Criminal Court, Old Bailey, before Justice Atkinson, with V.K. Krishna Menon and St John Hutchinson representing him. G. B. McClure was the prosecuting barrister. When asked about his motivation, Singh explained: > I did it because I had a grudge against him. He deserved it. He was the real > culprit. He wanted to crush the spirit of my people, so I have crushed him. > For full 21 years, I have been trying to seek vengeance. I am happy that I > have done the job. I am not scared of death. I am dying for my country. I > have seen my people starving in India under the British rule. I have > protested against this, it was my duty. What greater honour could be > bestowed on me than death for the sake of my motherland? CRIM 1/1177, Public > Record Office, London, p. 64 Singh was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. On 31 July 1940, Singh was hanged at Pentonville Prison. His remains are preserved at the Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar, Punjab. On every 31 July, marches are held in Sunam by various organisations and every statue of Singh in the city is paid tribute with flower garlands. =Singh's speech= Following his conviction, he made a speech which the judge directed should not be released to the press. However, political activists who had set up the Shaheed Udham Singh Trust and working with the Indian Workers Association (GB), ran a campaign to have the court record of his statement published along with other material. This proved successful in 1996, when his speech was published along with three further files covering the trial, and the Ghadar Directory, a document compiled by British intelligence in 1934 detailing 792 people regarded as a threat including Udham Singh. He started the speech with a denunciation of British Imperialism: :\\"I say down with British Imperialism. You say India do not have peace. We have only slavery Generations of so called civilisation has brought us everything filthy and degenerating. known to the human race. All you have to do is read your own history. If you have any human decency about you, you should die with shame. The brutality and blood thirsty way in which the so called intellectuals who call themselves rulers of civilisation in the world are bastard blood . . .\\" At this point he was interrupted by the judge, but after some discussion he continued: :\\"I do not care about sentence of death. It means nothing at all. I do not care about dying or anything. I do not worry about it at all. I am dying for a purpose.‚Äô Thumping the rail of the dock, he exclaimed, ‚ÄòWe are suffering from the British Empire.‚Äô Udham Singh continued more quietly. ‚ÄòI am not afraid to die. I am proud to die, to have to free my native land and I hope that when I am gone, I hope that in my place will come thousands of my countrymen to drive you dirty dogs out; to free my country. :\\"I am standing before an English jury. I am in an English court. You people go to India and when you come back you are given a prize and put in the House of Commons. We come to England and we are sentenced to death.‚Äô :\\"I never meant anything; but I will take it. I do not care anything about it, but when you dirty dogs come to India there comes a time when you will be cleaned out of India. All your British Imperialism will be smashed.‚Äô :\\"Machine guns on the streets of India mow down thousands of poor women and children wherever your so-called flag of democracy and Christianity flies.‚Äô :\\"Your conduct, your conduct ‚Äì I am talking about the British government.

You do not want to hear from us what you are doing in India. He then thrust his glasses back into his pocket, and exclaimed three words in Hindustani and then shouted: :'Down with British Imperialism!

When this material was published, it was reported in both British and Asian press, the statement was translated into Gurmukhi script and distributed at the Sikh Vaisaki Festival in Birmingham, April 1997. John Major, the prime Minister at that time remarked: \\"The Amritsar Massacre was an unhappy episode in Indo- British relations which was controversial in both countries. Today [8 October 1996] I am glad to say, our relationship is excellent. India is an important partner and a close friend of this country.\\" Reactions In its 18 March 1940 issue, Amrita Bazar Patrika wrote, \\"O'Dwyer's name is connected with Punjab incidents which India will never forget\\". The Punjab section of Congress in the Punjab Assembly led by Dewan Chaman Lal refused to vote for the Premier's motion to condemn the assassination. In April 1940, at the Annual Session of the All India Congress Committee held in commemoration of 21st anniversary of the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre, the youth wing of the Indian National Congress Party displayed revolutionary slogans in support of Singh, applauding his action as patriotic and heroic. Singh had some support from the international press. The Times of London called him a \\"fighter for freedom\\", his actions \\"an expression of the pent-up fury of the downtrodden Indian people.\\" Bergeret from Rome praised Singh's action as courageous. In March 1940, Indian National Congress leader Jawahar Lal Nehru, condemned the action of Singh as senseless, however, in 1962, Nehru reversed his stance and applauded Singh with the following published statement: \\"I salute Shaheed-i- Azam Udham Singh with reverence who had kissed the noose so that we may be free.\\" Repatriation of remains In 1974, Singh's remains were exhumed and repatriated to India at the request of MLA Sadhu Singh Thind. Thind accompanied the remains back to India, where the casket was received by Indira Gandhi, Shankar Dayal Sharma and Zail Singh. Udham Singh was later cremated in his birthplace of Sunam in Punjab and his ashes were scattered in the Sutlej river. Some of his ashes were retained; these retained ashes are kept inside a sealed urn at Jallianwala Bagh.

The population of the community which is named after the village of Llanfihangel-y-Pennant was 339 at the 2011 census. History Abergynolwyn around 1880, showing the village incline Historically, the village was part of Merionethshire and its main industry was slate quarrying. The village was founded in the 1860s to house workers at the nearby Bryn Eglwys quarry. The quarry brought in migrant workers from other areas of Wales and at one time the village had an Anglican church and three nonconformist chapels. The slate was shipped to the coast on the Talyllyn Railway. A decline in the demand for Welsh slate caused reductions in the workforce, and the quarry finally closed in 1948. Today farming, forestry and tourism are the major local industries. Talyllyn Railway The village pub, the Railway Inn, is named after the Talyllyn Railway whose narrow gauge branch once reached into the heart of the village down an incline from a ledge on the hillside above. The railway now terminates at Nant Gwernol station above the village, although for many years the terminus was at Abergynolwyn Station outside the village.  Local attractions  Llyn Mwyngil (Tal-y-llyn Lake), just upstream from Abergynolwyn is an unspoilt lake created when a massive landslide blocked the valley long ago. Hiking trails to the summit of Cadair Idris start from here. The Iron Age fort on Craig yr Aderyn shows that the area was strategically important in prehistoric times. In 1221, the mediaeval Welsh castle of Castell y Bere near Llanfihangel-y-pennant was built by Llewellyn the Great, occupied by the Welsh and later besieged by forces under Edward I of England in 1282.

He is also sometimes known as Osochor, following Manetho's Aegyptiaca. Biography Osorkon the Elder was the son of Shoshenq A, the Great Chief of the Ma by the latter's wife Mehtenweshkhet A who is given the prestigious title of 'King's Mother' in a document. Osorkon was the brother of Nimlot A, the Great Chief of the Ma, and Tentshepeh A the daughter of the Great Chief of the Ma and, thus, an uncle of Shoshenq I, founder of the 22nd Dynasty. His existence was doubted by most scholars until Eric Young established in 1963 that the induction of a temple priest named Nespaneferhor in Year 2 I Shemu day 20 under a certain king named Aakheperre Setepenre--in fragment 3B, line 1-3 of the Karnak Priest Annals --occurred one generation prior to the induction of Hori, Nespaneferhor's son, in Year 17 of Siamun, which is also recorded in the same annals.Eric Young, \\"Some Notes on the Chronology and Genealogy of the Twenty-first Dynasty\\", Journal of the American Research Center in Egypt 2 (1963), pp. 99‚Äì112 Young argued that this king Aakheperre Setepenre was the unknown Osochor. This hypothesis was not fully accepted by all Egyptologists at that time, however. Then, in a 1976‚Äì77 paper, Jean Yoyotte noted that a Libyan king named Osorkon was the son of Shoshenq A by the Lady Mehtenweshkhet A, with Mehtenweshkhet being explicitly titled the \\"King's Mother\\" in a certain genealogical document.Jean Yoyotte, \\"Osorkon fils de Mehytouskh√©: Un pharaon oubli√©?\\", Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© fran√ßaise d'√©gyptologie, 77‚Äì78 (1976-1977), pp .39‚Äì54 Since none of the other kings named Osorkon had a mother named Mehtenweshkhet, it was conclusively established that Aakheperre Setepenre was indeed Manetho's Osochor, whose mother was Mehtenweshkhet. The Lady Mehtenweshkhet A was also the mother of Nimlot A, Great Chief of the Meshwesh and, thus, Shoshenq I's grandmother. In 1999, Chris Bennett made a case for a Queen Karimala known from an inscription in the temple of Semna being his daughter.Chris Bennett, \\"Queen Karimala, Daughter of Osochor?\\" G√∂ttinger Miszellen 173 (1999), pp. 7-8 She is called both 'King's Daughter\\" and \\"King's Wife\\". Her name suggests she may have been Libyan. Given the date of the inscription (a year 14), she might have been the queen of either king Siamun or king Psusennes II. Bennett prefers a marriage to Siamun, because in that case she could have taken over the position of the Viceroy of Kush, Neskhons, as a religious figurehead in Nubia after the death of the latter in year 5 of king Siamun. Seal with royal cartouches, attributed to Osorkon the Elder A faience seal and a block naming a king Osorkon with the names Aakheperre Setepenamun, Osorkon Meryamun, both in the Rijksmuseum van Oudheden in Leiden, were for a long time attributed to Osorkon IV; however, this attribution has been challenged by Frederic Payraudeau in 2000, who pointed out that those objects more likely referred to Osorkon the Elder.Frederic Payraudeau, \\"L'identite du premier et du dernier Osorkon\\", G√∂ttinger Miszellen 178 (2000), pp. 75‚Äì80. This would lead to the attribution to his throne name Aakheperre both the epithets Setepenre and Setepenamun. Osorkon's time-line Based on a calculation of the aforementioned Year 2 lunar date of this king ‚Äì which Rolf Krauss in an astronomical calculation has shown to correspond to 990 BC ‚Äì Osorkon the Elder must have become king two years before the induction of Nespaneferhor in 992 BC.Erik Hornung, Rolf Krauss and David A. Warburton (eds.), Ancient Egyptian Chronology, Brill, Leiden/Boston, 2006, , p. .474 Osorkon the Elder's reign is significant because it foreshadows the coming the Libyan 22nd Dynasty. He is credited with a reign of six years in Manetho's Aegyptiaca and was succeeded in power by Siamun, who was either Osorkon's son or an unrelated native Egyptian.

Biography Van Stockum was born in Hattem in the Netherlands. His father was a mechanically talented officer in the Dutch Navy. After the family (less the father) relocated to Ireland in the late 1920s, Willem studied mathematics at Trinity College, Dublin, where he earned a gold medal. He went on to earn an M.A. from the University of Toronto and his Ph.D. from the University of Edinburgh. In the mid-1930s, van Stockum became an early enthusiast of the then new theory of gravitation, general relativity. In 1937, he published a paper which contains one of the first exact solutions in general relativity which modeled the gravitational field produced by a configuration of rotating matter, the van Stockum dust, which remains an important example noted for its unusual simplicity. In this paper, van Stockum was apparently the first to notice the possibility of closed timelike curves, one of the strangest and most disconcerting phenomena in general relativity. Van Stockum left for the United States in hope of studying under Albert Einstein, eventually in the spring of 1939 gaining a temporary position under Professor Oswald Veblen at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. The outbreak of the Second World War occurred while he was teaching at the University of Maryland. Anxious to join the fight against Hitler, he enlisted in the Royal Canadian Air Force, eventually earning his pilots wings in July 1942. Because of his advanced knowledge of physics, he spent much of the next year as a test pilot in Canada. After the Netherlands was invaded by Hitler, van Stockum sought to join the war as a pilot. Finally, he was able to transfer to the Dutch Air Force (in exile), and in 1944 became the only Dutch officer posted to No. 10 Sq¬≠ron of the RAF Bomber Command, which was stationed in Yorkshire and flew combat missions in the Halifax heavy bomber over Europe before and after the Normandy invasion. On 10 June 1944, van Stockum and his crew of six took off on their sixth combat mission, as part of another 400-plane raid. Near their target, the plane was hit by flak, and all seven crew members were lost, along with seven from another bomber on the same mission. The fourteen airmen are buried in Laval, near the place where the planes went down.

Established in 1927 in New Haven, Connecticut by the Lender family, it became a North American leader in the marketing, distribution and sales of bagels. Lender's introduced frozen bagels and sold the first packaged bagels in supermarkets, eventually becoming the world's biggest bagel producer. The company was sold to Kraft Foods in 1984. In 2003, it became part of Pinnacle Foods. In 1994 it began production of room temperature fresh bagels. In 2012, Lender's revenue was about $70 million.  History  Lender's Cinnamon Raisin Swirl bagels = Beginnings = Lender's Bagel Bakery was established by Harry Lender, a Jewish baker originally from Chelm, Poland. He had immigrated to the United States from Lublin in August 1927. His surname is a transliteration of the Yiddish word meaning \\"countryman\\" or \\"person living in a rural area\\" (cf. modern German L√§nder).Balinska, Maria (2008), pp.149-150 After first working in a bagel bakery in Passaic, New Jersey, Lender purchased his own bakery on Oak Street in New Haven, Connecticut for $600. He arranged for his family to join him in the United States and they arrived on December 30, 1929. New Haven then had a population of over 162,000, many of them new immigrants. The Jewish population of 25,000 made up almost one sixth of the population. Lender's bagel bakery, called the \\"New York Bagel Bakery\\", was one of the first bagel bakeries in the United States to be established outside New York City. In 2007, the site of the first Lender's bagel bakery was dedicated as a playground; it was named after one of Harry Lender's sons: ‚ÄúMurray Lender Playground‚Äù. In 1934, Lender moved to a large former Italian bakery, in a multi-ethnic neighborhood of New Haven. Aside from sales to individuals, Lender sold his bagels to other bakeries, as well as to delicatessens and restaurants. As the largest sales of bagels came on Sunday morning, Saturday night was the busiest time at the bakery. People of all ethnicities, even from out of town, began to stop by the bakery on Saturday nights to purchase fresh bagels. = New processes lead to growth = By the mid-1950s, the logistics of producing as many as 6,000 bagels for sale on Sunday morning, in contrast to relatively low activity the rest of the week, began to demand a solution. As a result, in 1954 Lender perfected a method of freezing the bagels, so that the labor could be spread more evenly throughout the week.Balinska, Maria (2008), pp.151-154 He kept this process a secret, but after two years, the bakery accidentally delivered frozen bagels, and the secret was revealed. Customers were initially angry, but were won over, when they realized that these were the same bagels they had been satisfied with for the previous two years. The New York Bagel Bakery started to market the frozen bagels, including delivery outside New Haven, for instance to resorts in the Catskills that were popular among Jews. Lender developed further refinements, such as pre-slicing the bagels and packing them in polyethylene bags to keep them fresh after thawing. The bakery began selling the packaged frozen bagels in supermarkets. To introduce bagels to an unfamiliar public, the Lender family would prepare and distribute them in supermarket aisles. The plastic bagged, frozen six pack of pre-sliced Lender's Frozen Bagels began to gain market share, and by 1959 supermarket sales accounted for half of the sales.Balinska, Maria (2008), p.153 His business created new varieties of bagels, and production was switched to rotary ovens, rather than the labor-intensive open, flat ovens. In 1960, Harry Lender died. His sons Sam and Murray, who had been running the bakery with him, continued. (The oldest son Hyman had previously left the family business.) When youngest son Marvin graduated from college, he became a partner as well, and shortly thereafter Sam retired. The two brothers teamed up to expand operations, with Marvin managing the bakery and Murray in charge of sales. In 1963 the Lenders leased the very first Thompson Bagel Machine, invented by Daniel T. Thompson. Until then, according to Thompson, > ‚ÄúSam Lender mixed the bagel dough and one man cut it into small slabs and > fed it into an Italian breadstick machine. The Italian breadstick machine > made bagel dough strips that were then distributed to workstations where six > to eight men rolled them by hand into bagels. With this system they averaged > 50 dozen bagels per hour per man. The first Thompson machine, with three > unskilled workers, was able to do the work of eight skilled workers.‚Äù = Large-scale expansion = In 1965 the bakery, now renamed \\"Lender's Bagel Bakery\\", moved to a plant on the Boston Post Road in West Haven, in order to have ample reserve capacity for expansion. Business increased so quickly that the bakery was working at full capacity within a year. The Lenders began flash-freezing the bagels and produced softer and sweeter bagels than was traditional. In 1974, Lender‚Äôs had bought their major competitor, Abel's Bagels in Buffalo, New York.Balinska, Maria (2008), p.164 In 1978 the family opened a bagel restaurant in Orange, Connecticut under the name ‚ÄúH. Lender and Sons‚Äù; two years later they opened a second one in Hamden. After Lender's Bagels was sold to Kraft Foods, the name of the restaurant was changed to S. Kinder Restaurants. The name is derived from Yiddish esst, kinder, meaning eat, children. Under Marvin and Murray Lender, Lender's Bagels eventually grew to a highly automated bakery, pioneering the modern automated bagel bakery. The company grew from six employees when it moved to West Haven to 600 in 1984, selling about $60 million worth of bagels from four bagel factories producing more than 750,000,000 bagels a year, becoming the world's biggest bagel producer.  Marketing  Murray Lender's marketing promotions put bagels into the public consciousness. He was traveling throughout the United States marketing Lender's Frozen Bagels to a country which was disdainful of frozen foods and unfamiliar with bagels. In response to observations that March was the slowest month for sales of frozen foods, Murray Lender led an effort to declare March as Frozen Foods Month, raising sales dramatically. In recognition of his contributions to the industry as a whole, he was elected chairman of the National Frozen Food Association, nominated to the Halls of Fame of the International Deli-Bakery Association, and the Frozen Food Association. In response to the public's growing consciousness of health foods and the drop in popularity of white bread, he began to stress bagels as more natural baked goods, and Lender's Bagels became one of the first products to voluntarily include nutritional information on the package. In a 1997 New York Times article, Eric Asimov described what he called the \\"informal border separating the land of fresh bagels from the frontier of the frozen assembly- line product made by Lender's Bagels\\" as \\"the Lender's Line.\\" Murray Lender appeared as a guest on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson.Balinska, Maria (2008), p.172 He created green bagels for Saint Patrick's Day, oval bagels for President Lyndon B. Johnson to be photographed eating in the Oval Office, and \\"bagel heads\\", miniature decorated bagels, in the likeness of the world leaders attending the 9th G7 summit in 1983. When he died at age 81 on March 21, 2012, the Washington Post called him \\"the most important man in the modern history of bagels,\\" adding \\"Lender‚Äôs bagels may taste like white bread with a hole, but what they lack in authenticity they make up for in meaning.\\" New ownership In the spring of 1984, the Lender family sold Lender's Frozen Bagels to Kraft Foods, with the stipulation that Marvin would remain president and Murray spokesman for the next two years. Murray Lender publicized the sale in characteristic form, by holding \\"the marriage of the century\\", with Murray and Marvin escorting a Lender‚Äôs Bagel, \\"Len\\", down the aisle to meet his new bride, \\"Phyl\\", a Kraft Philadelphia brand cream cheese. In 1987, Lender's had three plants in West Haven, a plant in New Haven, one in Buffalo, New York, and one in Mattoon, Illinois; the last is the site of the annual \\"Bagelfest\\", and also the only surviving Lender's Bagel plant in operation today. Kraft, which reportedly spent $12 to $15 million annually to advertise Lender's bagels, sold the company to Kellogg Company in 1996 for $455 million. Analysts criticized Kellogg's investment in a frozen product at a time when the popularity of fresh bagels was rising. Kellogs introduced a $20 million television campaign for Lender's in Fall 1997. In October 1999, Kellogs sold the business to San Francisco based Aurora Foods for $275 million, and ceased production at the New Haven factory in March 2000. In 2003, Aurora was bought by Pinnacle Foods, a subsidiary of the Blackstone Group since 2007. As of 2013, the Lender's Bagels brand is in production with a wide variety of bagels, including a Healthy Grain bagel brand containing more dietary fiber and protein than the company‚Äôs other bagels. In 2011, Lender‚Äôs revenue was $40.9 million from the sale of 23.4 million six-bagel packages, $12.7 million from the sale of 7.6 million units of frozen bagels, and $28.2 million from the sale of 15.8 million units of refrigerated bagels. According to SymphonyIRI Group, a Chicago-based market research firm, Lender‚Äôs is the top selling brand in each segment. In 2012, Lender's Bagels sales increased to more than $70 million. In May 2012, Consumer Reports magazine rated Lender's Original as one of the best bagels available in the U.S., an assessment criticized by many commentators ‚Äì especially in New York ‚Äì who argue that only fresh bagels are real bagels.

The first part of the name is the common naming element aber, meaning \\"confluence, estuary\\". The second part is a river name, an earlier name for the West Peffer Burn, derived from either *l·∫π:Œ≤, which in river names may mean \\"glide smoothly\\", or *loŒ≤, a verbal root associated with \\"peeling away, decomposition, decay\\" (Middle Irish lobour, \\"leprosy\\"). History There is archaeological evidence of a significant and wealthy Adolf-Saxon settlement dating from 7th to the 10th centuries.https://www.aocarchaeology.com/news/article/aberlady-angles- community-excavation-anglo-saxon-e In the Middle Ages, Aberlady was an important harbour for fishing, sealing, and whaling and was designated \\"Port of Haddington\\" by a 1633 Act of Parliament. However, its origins are much earlier. Aberlady had strong links with the monasteries at Iona and Lindisfarne from the 7th century, and its role was to facilitate the pilgrim traffic between the two sites. Previous archaeological excavations have shown traces of a Culdee chapel, and Pope Gregory X made reference to the church which he called \\"Aberlefdi\\". The 8th century Aberlady Cross fragment can be seen at the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh. A reconstruction of this finely carved cross was erected in 2011 by Aberlady Conservation & History Society. Aberlady Parish Church dates back to the 15th century. It was re- built in 1887. In 1986, the parishes of Aberlady and Gullane were merged, and the Manse is now in Gullane. The \\"Aberlady Heritage Project\\" is a community- led project, and in 2008 it surveyed three sites ‚Äî the medieval harbour quay commissioned in 1535, the Iron Age fort and associated souterrain at Kilspindie, and the Anglo-Saxon site at the Glebe. Aberlady boasts the largest collection of stray Anglo-Saxon finds yet discovered in Scotland. Conservation Aberlady Nature Reserve Footbridge that crosses the Peffer Burn. Footbridge to Luffness Birdwatching Centre Aberlady wetlands In 1952, Aberlady Bay became the UK's first Local Nature Reserve or LNR. Amongst its other conservation designations are: Site of Special Scientific Interest or SSSI; Special Protection Area or SPA; and Ramsar site. East Lothian Council provides Reserve Wardens. Waterston House, overlooking Aberlady Bay, is the headquarters of the Scottish Ornithologists' Club (SOC). It is named after George Waterston, joint founder of the SOC, and Director of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds in Scotland. The Library holds over 3,500 items and is said to be the largest ornithological library in Scotland. The art gallery space is named after wildlife artist Donald Watson who was President of SOC. The gallery specialises in bird-related paintings, but in May 2008 it had a textile exhibition named \\"Flights of Fancy\\". The author Nigel Tranter was inspired to write on his daily walks on the nature reserve.

It is considered the worst nuclear disaster in history and was caused by one of only two nuclear energy accidents rated at seven‚Äîthe maximum severity‚Äîon the International Nuclear Event Scale, the other being the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in Japan. The accident started during a safety test on an RBMK-type nuclear reactor, which was commonly used throughout the Soviet Union. The test was a simulation of an electrical power outage to aid the development of a safety procedure for maintaining reactor cooling water circulation until the back-up electrical generators could provide power. This gap was about one minute and had been identified as a potential safety problem that could cause the nuclear reactor core to overheat. It was hoped to prove that the residual rotational energy in a turbine generator could provide enough power to cover the gap. Three such tests had been conducted since 1982, but they had failed to provide a solution. On this fourth attempt, an unexpected 10-hour delay meant that an unprepared operating shift was on duty. During the planned decrease of reactor power in preparation for the electrical test, the power unexpectedly dropped to a near-zero level. The operators were able to only partially restore the specified test power, which put the reactor in a potentially unstable condition. This risk was not made evident in the operating instructions, so the operators proceeded with the electrical test. Upon test completion, the operators triggered a reactor shutdown, but a combination of unstable conditions and reactor design flaws caused an uncontrolled nuclear chain reaction instead. A large amount of energy was suddenly released, vaporising superheated cooling water and rupturing the reactor core in a highly destructive steam explosion. This was immediately followed by an open-air reactor core fire that released considerable airborne radioactive contamination for about nine days that precipitated onto parts of the USSR and western Europe, especially Belarus, 16km away, where around 70% landed, before being finally contained on 4 May 1986. The fire gradually released about the same amount of contamination as the initial explosion. As a result of rising ambient radiation levels off-site, a radius exclusion zone was created 36 hours after the accident. About 49,000 people were evacuated from the area, primarily from Pripyat. The exclusion zone was later increased to radius when a further 68,000 people were evacuated from the wider area. The reactor explosion killed two of the reactor operating staff. In the emergency response that followed, 134 station staff and firemen were hospitalized with acute radiation syndrome due to absorbing high doses of ionizing radiation. Of these 134 people, 28 died in the days to months afterward and approximately 14 suspected radiation-induced cancer deaths followed within the next 10 years. Among the wider population, an excess of 15 childhood thyroid cancer deaths were documented . The United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) has, at multiple times, reviewed all the published research on the incident and found that at present, fewer than 100 documented deaths are likely to be attributable to increased exposure to radiation. Determining the total eventual number of exposure related deaths is uncertain based on the linear no-threshold model, a contested statistical model, which has also been used in estimates of low level radon and air pollution exposure. Model predictions with the greatest confidence values of the eventual total death toll in the decades ahead from Chernobyl releases vary, from 4,000 fatalities when solely assessing the three most contaminated former Soviet states, to about 9,000 to 16,000 fatalities when assessing the total continent of Europe. To reduce the spread of radioactive contamination from the wreckage and protect it from weathering, the protective Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant sarcophagus was built by December 1986. It also provided radiological protection for the crews of the undamaged reactors at the site, which continued operating. Due to the continued deterioration of the sarcophagus, it was further enclosed in 2017 by the Chernobyl New Safe Confinement, a larger enclosure that allows the removal of both the sarcophagus and the reactor debris, while containing the radioactive hazard. Nuclear clean-up is scheduled for completion in 2065. The Chernobyl disaster is considered the worst nuclear power plant accident in history, both in terms of cost and casualties. The initial emergency response, together with later decontamination of the environment, ultimately involved more than 500,000 personnel and cost an estimated 18 billion Soviet rubles‚Äîroughly US$68 billion in 2019, adjusted for inflation. (see 1996 interview with Mikhail Gorbachev) The accident resulted in safety upgrades on all remaining Soviet-designed RBMK reactors, of which 10 continue to be operational .  Background  = Reactor cooling after shutdown = Reactor decay heat shown as % of thermal power from time of sustained fission shutdown using two different correlations. Due to decay heat, solid fuel power reactors need high flows of coolant after a fission shutdown for a considerable time to prevent fuel cladding damage, or in the worst case, a full core meltdown. In power-generating operation, most of the heat generated in a nuclear reactor by its fuel rods is derived from nuclear fission, but a significant fraction (over 6%) is derived from the radioactive decay of the accumulated fission products; a process known as decay heat. This decay heat continues for some time after the fission chain reaction has been stopped, such as following a reactor shutdown, either emergency or planned, and continued pumped circulation of coolant is essential to prevent core overheating, or in the worst case, core meltdown. The RBMK reactors like those at Chernobyl use water as a coolant, circulated by electrically-driven pumps. The coolant flow rate is considerable. Reactor No. 4 had 1661 individual fuel channels, each requiring a coolant flow of per hour at full reactor power. To guard against an electrical power failure to the pumps, each of Chernobyl's reactors had three backup diesel generators, but they took 60‚Äì75 seconds to attain full speed and generate the 5.5megawatt output required to run one main pump. This delay was considered a significant safety risk. It had been theorized that the rotational momentum of the steam turbines could be used to generate the required electrical power to cover this gap. Analysis indicated that this might be sufficient to provide electrical power to run the coolant pumps for 45 seconds, not quite bridging the gap between an external power failure and the full availability of the emergency generators, but alleviating the situation. = Safety test = This capability still needed to be confirmed experimentally, and previous tests had ended unsuccessfully. An initial test carried out in 1982 indicated that the excitation voltage of the turbine-generator was insufficient; it did not maintain the desired magnetic field after the turbine trip. The system was modified, and the test was repeated in 1984 but again proved unsuccessful. In 1985, a test was conducted a third time but also yielded negative results. The test procedure was to be run again in 1986, and scheduled to take place during a maintenance shutdown of reactor No. 4. A test procedure had been written, but the authors were not aware of the unusual RBMK-1000 reactor behaviour under the planned operating conditions. It was regarded as purely an electrical test of the generator, not a complex unit test, even though it involved critical unit systems. According to the regulations in place at the time, such a test did not require approval by either the chief designer of the reactor (NIKIET), the scientific manager or the Soviet nuclear oversight regulator. The test required disabling of some safety systems (in particular, the emergency core cooling system, a passive/active system of core cooling intended to provide water to the core in a loss-of-coolant accident), and a special approval from the chief engineer had been obtained according to regulations. The experimental procedure was intended to run as follows: Preparation for the test. #The test would take place during a scheduled reactor shutdown #The reactor power was to be reduced to between 700 MW and 800 MW. (It was not necessary to perform the test from full-power operation, as only the electrical generator was being tested.) # The steam-turbine generator was to be run at normal operating speed The electrical test # When the correct conditions were achieved, the steam supply to the turbine generator would be closed off # The turbine generator performance would then be monitored to determine whether it could provide the bridging power for coolant pumps until the emergency diesel generators automatically started and provided power. # When the emergency generators supplied electrical power, the turbine generator would be allowed to continue free-wheeling down. # The normal planned shut down procedure of the reactor was then to be completed = Test delay and shift change = Process flow diagram of the reactor The test was to be conducted during the day-shift of 25 April 1986 as part of a scheduled reactor shut down. The day shift crew had been instructed in advance on the reactor operating conditions to run the test and in addition, a special team of electrical engineers was present to conduct the one-minute test of the new voltage regulating system once the correct conditions had been reached. As planned, a gradual reduction in the output of the power unit began at 01:06 on 25 April, and the power level had reached 50% of its nominal 3,200 MW thermal level by the beginning of the day shift. Comparative Generation II reactor vessels size comparison, a design classification of commercial reactors built until the end of the 1990s. The day shift performed many unrelated maintenance tasks, and was scheduled to perform the test at 14:15 and preparations for the test were carried out, including the disabling of the emergency core cooling system. Meanwhile, another regional power station unexpectedly went offline and at 14:00 the Kiev electrical grid controller requested that the further reduction of Chernobyl's output be postponed, as power was needed to satisfy the peak evening demand. The Chernobyl plant director agreed, and postponed the test. Soon, the day shift was replaced by the evening shift. Despite the delay, the emergency core cooling system was left disabled ‚Äì it was disconnected by a manual isolating slide valve which in practice meant that two or three people spent the whole shift manually turning sailboat-helm sized valve wheels. The system would have no influence on the events that unfolded next. Allowing the reactor to run for 11 hours outside of the test without emergency protection was indicative of a general lack of safety culture. At 23:04, the Kiev grid controller allowed the reactor shutdown to resume. This delay had some serious consequences: the day shift had long since departed, the evening shift was also preparing to leave, and the night shift would not take over until midnight, well into the job. According to plan, the test should have been finished during the day shift, and the night shift would only have had to maintain decay heat cooling systems in an otherwise shut-down plant. The night shift had very limited time to prepare for and carry out the experiment. Anatoly Dyatlov, deputy chief- engineer of the entire Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, was present to supervise and direct the experiment; as he out-ranked all other supervisory personnel present, his orders and instructions overrode any objections of other senior personnel present during the test and its preparation. Serving under Dyatlov, Aleksandr Akimov was chief of the night shift, and Leonid Toptunov was the operator responsible for the reactor's operational regimen, including the movement of the control rods. Toptunov was a young engineer who had worked independently as a senior engineer for approximately three months. = Unexpected drop of the reactor power = The test plan called for a gradual decrease in power output from reactor No. 4 to a thermal level of 700‚Äì1000 MW and an output of 720 MW was reached at 00:05 on 26 April. Due to the reactor's production of a fission byproduct, xenon-135, which is a reaction-inhibiting neutron absorber, core power continued to decrease in the absence of further operator action‚Äîa process known as reactor poisoning. In steady-state operation, this is avoided because xenon-135 is \\"burned off\\" as quickly as it is created from decaying iodine-135 by the absorption of neutrons from the ongoing chain reaction, becoming highly stable xenon-136. With the reactor power reduced, previously produced high quantities of iodine-135 were decaying into the neutron-absorbing xenon-135 faster than the now reduced neutron flux could burn it off. When the reactor power dropped to approximately 500 MW, the reactor control had been switched to a different mode in order to manually maintain the power level. Around that moment, the power suddenly fell into an unintended near-shutdown state, with a power output of 30 MW thermal or less. The exact circumstances that caused the power fall are unknown because Akimov died in hospital on 10 May and Toptunov on 14 May; early reports attributed it to Toptunov's mistake, but it has also been suggested it was due to an equipment failure. The reactor was now producing 5% of the minimum initial power level prescribed for the test. This low reactivity inhibited the burn- off of xenon-135 within the reactor core and hindered the rise of reactor power. Control-room personnel had to raise power by disconnecting most of the reactor control rods from the automatic control rod regulation system and manually extracted the majority of rods to their upper limits in order to promote reactivity and counteract the effect of the poisoning. Several minutes elapsed between their extraction and the point at which the power output began to increase and subsequently stabilized at 160‚Äì200 MW (thermal). The operation of the reactor at the low power level (and high poisoning level) was accompanied by unstable core temperatures and coolant flow, and possibly by instability of neutron flux, which triggered alarms. The control room received repeated emergency signals regarding the levels in the steam/water separator drums, and large excursions or variations in the flow rate of feed water, as well as from relief valves opened to relieve excess steam into a turbine condenser, and from the neutron power controller. Between 00:35 and 00:45, emergency alarm signals concerning thermal-hydraulic parameters were ignored, apparently to preserve the reactor power level. = Reactor conditions priming the accident = When a power level of 200 MW was reattained, preparation for the experiment continued, although the power level was much lower than the prescribed 700 MW. As part of the test plan, extra water pumps were activated at 01:05, increasing the water flow. The increased coolant flow rate through the reactor produced an increase in the inlet coolant temperature of the reactor core (the coolant no longer having sufficient time to release its heat in the turbine and cooling towers), which now more closely approached the nucleate boiling temperature of water, reducing the safety margin. The flow exceeded the allowed limit at 01:19, triggering an alarm of low steam pressure in the steam separators. At the same time, the extra water flow lowered the overall core temperature and reduced the existing steam voids in the core and the steam separators. Since water absorbs neutrons better than steam, the neutron flux decreased and reduced the reactor power. The crew responded by turning off two of the circulation pumps to reduce feedwater flow in an effort to increase steam pressure, and by removing more manual control rods to maintain power. The combined effect of these various actions was an extremely unstable reactor configuration. Nearly all of the 211 control rods had been extracted manually, including all but 18 of the \\"fail-safe\\" manually operated rods of the minimum 28 that were supposed to remain fully inserted to control the reactor even in the event of a loss of coolant. While the emergency scram system that would insert all control rods to shut down the reactor could still be activated manually (through the \\"AZ-5\\" switch), the automated system that would ordinarily do the same had been mostly disabled to maintain the power level, and many other automated and even passive safety features of the reactor had been bypassed. Unlike other light-water reactor designs, the RBMK design at that time had a positive void coefficient of reactivity at low power levels. This meant that the formation of steam bubbles (voids) from boiling cooling water intensified the nuclear chain reaction owing to voids having lower neutron absorption than water. The consequent power increase then produced more voids which further intensified the chain reaction, and so on. Given this characteristic, reactor No. 4 was now at risk of a runaway increase in its core power with nothing to restrain it. The reduction of reactor coolant pumping and the reduction of neutron absorbing control rods now left little safety margin. The reactor was now very sensitive to the regenerative effect of steam voids on reactor power.  Accident  = Test execution = Plan view of reactor No. 4 core. Numbers show insertion depths of control rods in centimeters at the moment of the explosion. startup neutron sources (12) control rods (167) short control rods from below reactor (32) automatic control rods (12) pressure tubes with fuel rods (1661) At 01:23:04, the test began. Four of the eight main circulating pumps (MCP) were active, versus six under regular operation. The steam to the turbines was shut off, beginning a run-down of the turbine generator. The diesel generators started and sequentially picked up loads; the generators were to have completely picked up the MCPs' power needs by 01:23:43. In the interim, the power for the MCPs was to be supplied by the turbine generator as it coasted down. As the momentum of the turbine generator decreased, so did the power it produced for the pumps. The water flow rate decreased, leading to increased formation of steam voids in the coolant flowing up through the fuel pressure tubes. = Reactor shutdown and power excursion = At 01:23:40, as recorded by the SKALA centralized control system, a scram (emergency shutdown) of the reactor was initiated as the experiment was wrapping up. The scram was started when the AZ-5 button (also known as the EPS-5 button) of the reactor emergency protection system was pressed: this engaged the drive mechanism on all control rods to fully insert them, including the manual control rods that had been withdrawn earlier. The mechanism would be used even to routinely shut down the reactor after the experiment for the planned maintenance and the scram likely preceded the sharp increase in power. However, the precise reason why the button was pressed when it was is not certain, as only the deceased Akimov and Toptunov partook in that decision, though the atmosphere in the control room was calm at that moment. Meanwhile, the RBMK designers claim that the button had to have been pressed only after the reactor already began to self-destruct. Steam plumes continued to be generated days after the initial explosion When the AZ-5 button was pressed, the insertion of control rods into the reactor core began. The control rod insertion mechanism moved the rods at , so that the rods took 18 to 20 seconds to travel the full height of the core, about . A bigger problem was the design of the RBMK control rods, each of which had a graphite neutron moderator section attached to its end to boost reactor output by displacing water when the control rod section had been fully withdrawn from the reactor, i.e. when a control rod was at maximum extraction, a neutron- moderating graphite extension was centered in the core with columns of water above and below it. Consequently, injecting a control rod downward into the reactor in a scram initially displaced (neutron-absorbing) water in the lower portion of the reactor with (neutron-moderating) graphite. Thus, an emergency scram initially increased the reaction rate in the lower part of the core. This behaviour had been discovered when the initial insertion of control rods in another RBMK reactor at Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant in 1983 induced a power spike. Procedural countermeasures were not implemented in response to Ignalina. The UKAEA investigative report INSAG-7 later stated, \\"Apparently, there was a widespread view that the conditions under which the positive scram effect would be important would never occur. However, they did appear in almost every detail in the course of the actions leading to the (Chernobyl) accident.\\" A few seconds into the scram, a power spike did occur and the core overheated, causing some of the fuel rods to fracture, blocking the control rod columns and jamming the control rods at one-third insertion, with the graphite water-displacers still in the lower part of the core. Within three seconds the reactor output rose above 530 MW. The subsequent course of events was not registered by instruments; it has been reconstructed through mathematical simulation. Per the simulation, the power spike would have caused an increase in fuel temperature and steam buildup, leading to a rapid increase in steam pressure. This caused the fuel cladding to fail, releasing the fuel elements into the coolant, and rupturing the channels in which these elements were located. = Steam explosions = The reactor lid (upper biological shield) nicknamed \\"Elena\\" lying on its side in the explosion crater. Overlaid are the pre-explosion position of the steam tanks, reactor hall floor and roof trusses. As the scram continued, the reactor output jumped to around 30,000 MW thermal, 10 times its normal operational output, the indicated last reading on the power meter on the control panel. Some estimate the power spike may have gone 10 times higher than that. It was not possible to reconstruct the precise sequence of the processes that led to the destruction of the reactor and the power unit building, but a steam explosion, like the explosion of a steam boiler from excess vapour pressure, appears to have been the next event. There is a general understanding that it was explosive steam pressure from the damaged fuel channels escaping into the reactor's exterior cooling structure that caused the explosion that destroyed the reactor casing, tearing off and blasting the upper plate called the upper biological shield, to which the entire reactor assembly is fastened, through the roof of the reactor building. This is believed to be the first explosion that many heard. This explosion ruptured further fuel channels, as well as severing most of the coolant lines feeding the reactor chamber, and as a result, the remaining coolant flashed to steam and escaped the reactor core. The total water loss in combination with a high positive void coefficient further increased the reactor's thermal power. A second, more powerful explosion occurred about two or three seconds after the first; this explosion dispersed the damaged core and effectively terminated the nuclear chain reaction. This explosion also compromised more of the reactor containment vessel and ejected hot lumps of graphite moderator. The ejected graphite and the demolished channels still in the remains of the reactor vessel caught fire on exposure to air, greatly contributing to the spread of radioactive fallout and the contamination of outlying areas. According to observers outside Unit 4, burning lumps of material and sparks shot into the air above the reactor. Some of them fell onto the roof of the machine hall and started a fire. About 25% of the red-hot graphite blocks and overheated material from the fuel channels was ejected. Parts of the graphite blocks and fuel channels were out of the reactor building. As a result of the damage to the building an airflow through the core was established by the high temperature of the core. The air ignited the hot graphite and started a graphite fire. After the larger explosion, a number of employees at the power station went outside to get a clearer view of the extent of the damage. One such survivor, Alexander Yuvchenko, recounts that once he stepped outside and looked up towards the reactor hall, he saw a \\"very beautiful\\" laser-like beam of blue light caused by the ionized-air glow that appeared to \\"flood up into infinity\\". There were initially several hypotheses about the nature of the second explosion. One view was that the second explosion was caused by the combustion of hydrogen, which had been produced either by the overheated steam-zirconium reaction or by the reaction of red-hot graphite with steam that produced hydrogen and carbon monoxide. Another hypothesis, by Konstantin Checherov, published in 1998, was that the second explosion was a thermal explosion of the reactor as a result of the uncontrollable escape of fast neutrons caused by the complete water loss in the reactor core. A third hypothesis was that the second explosion was another steam explosion. According to this version, the first explosion was a more minor steam explosion in the circulating loop, causing a loss of coolant flow and pressure that in turn caused the water still in the core to flash to steam; this second explosion then caused the majority of the damage to the reactor and containment building.  Crisis management  = Fire containment = Firefighter Leonid Telyatnikov being decorated for bravery Contrary to safety regulations, bitumen, a combustible material, had been used in the construction of the roof of the reactor building and the turbine hall. Ejected material ignited at least five fires on the roof of the adjacent reactor No. 3, which was still operating. It was imperative to put those fires out and protect the cooling systems of reactor No. 3. Inside reactor No. 3, the chief of the night shift, Yuri Bagdasarov, wanted to shut down the reactor immediately, but chief engineer Nikolai Fomin would not allow this. The operators were given respirators and potassium iodide tablets and told to continue working. At 05:00, Bagdasarov made his own decision to shut down the reactor. Shortly after the accident, at 01:45, firefighters arrived to try to extinguish the fires. First on the scene was a Chernobyl Power Station firefighter brigade under the command of Lieutenant Volodymyr Pravyk, who died on 9 May 1986 of acute radiation sickness. They were not told how dangerously radioactive the smoke and the debris were, and may not even have known that the accident was anything more than a regular electrical fire: \\"We didn't know it was the reactor. No one had told us.\\" Grigorii Khmel, the driver of one of the fire engines, later described what happened: graphite moderator ejected from the core; the largest lump shows an intact control rod channel Anatoli Zakharov, a fireman stationed in Chernobyl since 1980, offered a different description in 2008: \\"I remember joking to the others, 'There must be an incredible amount of radiation here. We'll be lucky if we're all still alive in the morning.'\\" He also stated: \\"Of course we knew! If we'd followed regulations, we would never have gone near the reactor. But it was a moral obligation‚Äîour duty. We were like kamikaze.\\" The immediate priority was to extinguish fires on the roof of the station and the area around the building containing Reactor No. 4 to protect No. 3 and keep its core cooling systems intact. The fires were extinguished by 5:00, but many firefighters received high doses of radiation. The fire inside reactor No. 4 continued to burn until 10 May 1986; it is possible that well over half of the graphite burned out. It was thought by some that the core fire was extinguished by a combined effort of helicopters dropping more than of sand, lead, clay, and neutron-absorbing boron onto the burning reactor. It is now known that virtually none of the neutron absorbers reached the core. Historians estimate that about 600 Soviet pilots risked dangerous levels of radiation to fly the thousands of flights needed to cover reactor No. 4 in this attempt to seal off radiation. From eyewitness accounts of the firefighters involved before they died (as reported on the CBC television series Witness), one described his experience of the radiation as \\"tasting like metal\\", and feeling a sensation similar to that of pins and needles all over his face. (This is consistent to the description given by Louis Slotin, a Manhattan Project physicist who died days after a fatal radiation overdose from a criticality accident.) Soviet badge awarded to Chernobyl liquidators The explosion and fire threw hot particles of the nuclear fuel and also far more dangerous fission products, radioactive isotopes such as caesium-137, iodine-131, strontium-90, and other radionuclides, into the air. The residents of the surrounding area observed the radioactive cloud on the night of the explosion. = Radiation levels = The ionizing radiation levels in the worst-hit areas of the reactor building have been estimated to be 5.6 roentgens per second (R/s), equivalent to more than 20,000 roentgens per hour. A lethal dose is around 500 roentgens (~5 Gray (Gy) in modern radiation units) over five hours, so in some areas, unprotected workers received fatal doses in less than a minute. However, a dosimeter capable of measuring up to 1,000 R/s was buried in the rubble of a collapsed part of the building, and another one failed when turned on. All remaining dosimeters had limits of 0.001 R/s and therefore read \\"off scale\\". Thus, the reactor crew could ascertain only that the radiation levels were somewhere above 0.001 R/s (3.6 R/h), while the true levels were much higher in some areas. Because of the inaccurate low readings, the reactor crew chief Aleksandr Akimov assumed that the reactor was intact. The evidence of pieces of graphite and reactor fuel lying around the building was ignored, and the readings of another dosimeter brought in by 04:30 were dismissed under the assumption that the new dosimeter must have been defective. Akimov stayed with his crew in the reactor building until morning, sending members of his crew to try to pump water into the reactor. None of them wore any protective gear. Most, including Akimov, died from radiation exposure within three weeks. = Evacuation = Pripyat with the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in the distance The nearby city of Pripyat was not immediately evacuated. The townspeople, in the early hours of the morning, at 01:23 local time, went about their usual business, completely oblivious to what had just happened. However, within a few hours of the explosion, dozens of people fell ill. Later, they reported severe headaches and metallic tastes in their mouths, along with uncontrollable fits of coughing and vomiting. As the plant was run by authorities in Moscow, the government of Ukraine did not receive prompt information on the accident. Valentyna Shevchenko, then Chairwoman of the Presidium of Verkhovna Rada Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian SSR, recalls that Ukraine's acting Minister of Internal Affairs Vasyl Durdynets phoned her at work at 09:00 to report current affairs; only at the end of the conversation did he add that there had been a fire at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, but it was extinguished and everything was fine. When Shevchenko asked \\"How are the people?\\", he replied that there was nothing to be concerned about: \\"Some are celebrating a wedding, others are gardening, and others are fishing in the Pripyat River\\". Shevchenko then spoke over the phone to Volodymyr Shcherbytsky, general secretary of the Communist Party of Ukraine and de facto head of state, who said he anticipated a delegation of the state commission headed by Boris Shcherbina, the deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR. A commission was established later in the day to investigate the accident. It was headed by Valery Legasov, First Deputy Director of the Kurchatov Institute of Atomic Energy, and included leading nuclear specialist Evgeny Velikhov, hydro-meteorologist Yuri Izrael, radiologist Leonid Ilyin, and others. They flew to Boryspil International Airport and arrived at the power plant in the evening of 26 April. By that time two people had already died and 52 were hospitalized. The delegation soon had ample evidence that the reactor was destroyed and extremely high levels of radiation had caused a number of cases of radiation exposure. In the early daylight hours of 27 April, approximately 36 hours after the initial blast, they ordered the evacuation of Pripyat. Initially it was decided to evacuate the population for three days; later this was made permanent. By 11:00 on 27 April, buses had arrived in Pripyat to start the evacuation. The evacuation began at 14:00. A translated excerpt of the evacuation announcement follows: To expedite the evacuation, residents were told to bring only what was necessary, and that they would remain evacuated for approximately three days. As a result, most personal belongings were left behind, and remain there today. By 15:00, 53,000 people were evacuated to various villages of the Kiev region. The next day, talks began for evacuating people from the zone. Ten days after the accident, the evacuation area was expanded to . The Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Exclusion Zone has remained ever since, although its shape has changed and its size has been expanded. The surveying and detection of isolated fallout hotspots outside this zone over the following year eventually resulted in 135,000 long-term evacuees in total agreeing to be moved. The years between 1986 and 2000 saw the near tripling in the total number of permanently resettled persons from the most severely contaminated areas to approximately 350,000. = Official announcement = Evacuation began one and a half days before the accident was publicly acknowledged by the Soviet Union. In the morning of 28 April, radiation levels set off alarms at the Forsmark Nuclear Power Plant in Sweden, over from the Chernobyl Plant. Workers at Forsmark reported the case to the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority, which determined that the radiation had originated elsewhere. That day, the Swedish government contacted the Soviet government to inquire about whether there had been a nuclear accident in the Soviet Union. The Soviets initially denied it, and it was only after the Swedish government suggested they were about to file an official alert with the International Atomic Energy Agency, that the Soviet government admitted that an accident had taken place at Chernobyl. At first, the Soviets only conceded that a minor accident had occurred, but once they began evacuating more than 100,000 people, the full scale of the situation was realized by the global community. At 21:02 the evening of 28 April, a 20-second announcement was read in the TV news programme Vremya: \\"There has been an accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. One of the nuclear reactors was damaged. The effects of the accident are being remedied. Assistance has been provided for any affected people. An investigative commission has been set up.\\" This was the entire announcement, and the first time the Soviet Union officially announced a nuclear accident. The Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union (TASS) then discussed the Three Mile Island accident and other American nuclear accidents, which Serge Schmemann of The New York Times wrote was an example of the common Soviet tactic of whataboutism. The mention of a commission, however, indicated to observers the seriousness of the incident, and subsequent state radio broadcasts were replaced with classical music, which was a common method of preparing the public for an announcement of a tragedy. Around the same time, ABC News released its report about the disaster. Shevchenko was the first of the Ukrainian state top officials to arrive at the disaster site early on 28 April. There she spoke with members of medical staff and people, who were calm and hopeful that they could soon return to their homes. Shevchenko returned home near midnight, stopping at a radiological checkpoint in Vilcha, one of the first that were set up soon after the accident. There was a notification from Moscow that there was no reason to postpone the 1 May International Workers' Day celebrations in Kiev (including the annual parade), but on 30 April a meeting of the Political bureau of the Central Committee of the CPSU took place to discuss the plan for the upcoming celebration. Scientists were reporting that the radiological background level in Kiev was normal. At the meeting, which was finished at 18:00, it was decided to shorten celebrations from the regular three and a half to four hours to under two hours. Several buildings in Pripyat were officially kept open after the disaster to be used by workers still involved with the plant. These included the Jupiter factory which closed in 1996 and the Azure Swimming Pool, used by the Chernobyl liquidators for recreation during the clean-up, which closed in 1998. = Core meltdown explosion risk = corium lava, formed by fuel-containing mass, flowed into the basement of the plant. Extremely high levels of radioactivity in the lava under the Chernobyl number four reactor in 1986 =Bubbler pools= Two floors of bubbler pools beneath the reactor served as a large water reservoir for the emergency cooling pumps and as a pressure suppression system capable of condensing steam in case of a small broken steam pipe; the third floor above them, below the reactor, served as a steam tunnel. The steam released by a broken pipe was supposed to enter the steam tunnel and be led into the pools to bubble through a layer of water. After the disaster, the pools and the basement were flooded because of ruptured cooling water pipes and accumulated firefighting water, and constituted a serious steam explosion risk. The smoldering graphite, fuel and other material above, at more than , started to burn through the reactor floor and mixed with molten concrete from the reactor lining, creating corium, a radioactive semi-liquid material comparable to lava. If this mixture had melted through the floor into the pool of water, it was feared it could have created a serious steam explosion that would have ejected more radioactive material from the reactor. It became necessary to drain the pool. The bubbler pool could be drained by opening its sluice gates. However, the valves controlling it were underwater, located in a flooded corridor in the basement. Volunteers in wetsuits and respirators (for protection against radioactive aerosols) and equipped with dosimeters, entered the knee-deep radioactive water and managed to open the valves. These were the engineers Alexei Ananenko and Valeri Bezpalov (who knew where the valves were), accompanied by the shift supervisor Boris Baranov. Upon succeeding, all risk of a further steam explosion was eliminated. All three men were awarded the Order For Courage by Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko in May 2018. Research by Andrew Leatherbarrow, author of Chernobyl 01:23:40, determined that the frequently recounted story that suggests that all three men died just days after the incident is false. Alexei Ananenko continues to work in the nuclear energy industry, and rebuffs the growth of the Chernobyl media sensationalism surrounding him. While Valeri Bezpalov was found to still be alive by Leatherbarrow, the 65-year-old Baranov had lived until 2005 and had died of heart failure. Once the bubbler pool gates were opened by the Ananenko team, fire brigade pumps were then used to drain the basement. The operation was not completed until 8 May, after of water were pumped out. =Natural water table= With the bubbler pool gone, a meltdown was less likely to produce a powerful steam explosion. To do so, the molten core would now have to reach the water table below the reactor. To reduce the likelihood of this, it was decided to freeze the earth beneath the reactor, which would also stabilize the foundations. Using oil well drilling equipment, the injection of liquid nitrogen began on 4 May. It was estimated that 25 tonnes of liquid nitrogen per day would be required to keep the soil frozen at . This idea was soon scrapped. As an alternative, coal miners were deployed to excavate a tunnel below the reactor to make room for a cooling system. The final makeshift design for the cooling system was to incorporate a coiled formation of pipes cooled with water and covered on top with a thin thermally conductive graphite layer. The graphite layer as a natural refractory material would rapidly cool the suspected molten uranium oxide without burn through. This graphite cooling plate layer was to be encapsulated between two concrete layers, each one meter thick for stabilisation. This system was designed by Bolshov, the director of the Institute for Nuclear Safety and Development formed in 1988. Bolshov's graphite-concrete \\"sandwich\\" would be similar in concept to later core catchers that are now part of many nuclear reactor designs. Bolshov's graphite cooling plate, alongside the prior nitrogen injection proposal, were not used following the drop in aerial temperatures and indicative reports that the fuel melt had stopped. It was later determined that the fuel had passed through three storeys before coming to rest in one of a number of basement rooms. The precautionary underground channel with its active cooling was therefore deemed redundant, as the fuel was self-cooling. The excavation was then simply filled with concrete to strengthen the foundation below the reactor.  Immediate site and area remediation  sarcophagus containment structure =Debris removal= In the months after the explosion, attention turned to removing the radioactive debris from the roof. The worst of the radioactive debris was collected inside what was left of the reactor, however it was estimated that there was approximately 100 tons of debris on that roof that resulted from the explosion and which had to be removed to enable the safe construction of the 'sarcophagus' ‚Äì a concrete structure that would entomb the reactor and reduce radioactive dust being released into the atmosphere. The initial plan was to use robots to clear the debris off the roof. The Soviets used approximately 60 remote-controlled robots, most of them built in the Soviet Union. Many failed due to the effect of high levels of radiation on their electronic controls; in 1987, Valery Legasov, first deputy director of the Kurchatov Institute of Atomic Energy in Moscow, said: \\"We learned that robots are not the great remedy for everything. Where there was very high radiation, the robot ceased to be a robot‚Äîthe electronics quit working.\\" Consequently, the most highly radioactive materials were shoveled by Chernobyl liquidators from the military wearing heavy protective gear (dubbed \\"bio-robots\\" by the military); these soldiers could only spend a maximum of 40‚Äì90 seconds working on the rooftops of the surrounding buildings because of the extremely high doses of radiation given off by the blocks of graphite and other debris. Though the soldiers were only supposed to perform the role of the \\"bio-robot\\" a maximum of once, some soldiers reported having done this task five or six times. Only 10% of the debris cleared from the roof was performed by robots with the other 90% removed by approximately 5,000 men who absorbed, on average, an estimated dose of 25 rem (250 mSv) of radiation each. =Construction of the sarcophagus= To provide radiologocal protection by prevention of airborne contamination, and prevent weathering of the reactor remains, a containment structure was planned. This was the largest civil engineering task in history, involving a quarter of a million construction workers who all reached their official lifetime limits of radiation. Ukrainian filmmaker Vladimir Shevchenko captured film footage of an Mi-8 helicopter as its main rotor collided with a nearby construction crane cable, causing the helicopter to fall near the damaged reactor building and killing its four-man crew on 2 October 1986. 2006. By December 1986, a large concrete sarcophagus had been erected to seal off the reactor and its contents. The greater urban decontamination liquidators similarly first washed buildings and roads with \\"Bourda\\", a sticky polymerizing fluid DeconGel, designed to entrain radioactive dust and, when dry, could then be peeled off and compacted into configurations, akin to carpet rolls, in preparation for burial. A unique \\"clean up\\" medal was given to the workers. =Investigations of the reactor condition= During the construction of the sarcophagus, a scientific team re-entered the reactor as part of an investigation dubbed \\"Complex Expedition\\", to locate and contain nuclear fuel in a way that could not lead to another explosion. These scientists manually collected cold fuel rods, but great heat was still emanating from the core. Rates of radiation in different parts of the building were monitored by drilling holes into the reactor and inserting long metal detector tubes. The scientists were exposed to high levels of radiation and radioactive dust. After six months of investigation, in December 1986, with the help of a remote camera they discovered an intensely radioactive mass more than two metres wide in the basement of Unit Four, which they called \\"the elephant's foot\\" for its wrinkled appearance. The mass was composed of melted sand, concrete and a large amount of nuclear fuel that had escaped from the reactor. The concrete beneath the reactor was steaming hot, and was breached by now-solidified lava and spectacular unknown crystalline forms termed chernobylite. It was concluded that there was no further risk of explosion. =Area cleanup= The official contaminated zones saw a massive clean-up effort lasting seven months. The official reason for such early (and dangerous) decontamination efforts, rather than allowing time for natural decay, was that the land must be repopulated and brought back into cultivation. Indeed, within fifteen months 75% of the land was under cultivation, even though only a third of the evacuated villages were resettled. Defence forces must have done much of the work. Yet this land was of marginal agricultural value. According to historian David Marples, the administration had a psychological purpose for the clean-up: they wished to forestall panic regarding nuclear energy, and even to restart the Chernobyl power station. Although a number of radioactive emergency vehicles were buried in trenches, many of the vehicles used by the liquidators, including the helicopters, still remained, as of 2018, parked in a field in the Chernobyl area. Scavengers have since removed many functioning, but highly radioactive, parts. Liquidators worked under deplorable conditions, poorly informed and with poor protection. Many, if not most of them, exceeded radiation safety limits.  Investigations and the evolution of identified causes  To investigate the causes of the accident the IAEA used the International Nuclear Safety Advisory Group (INSAG), which had been created by the IAEA in 1985.INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC ENERGY AGENCY, History of the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, Vienna (1997). It produced two significant reports on Chernobyl; INSAG-1 in 1986, and a revised report, INSAG-7 in 1992. In summary, according to INSAG-1, the main cause of the accident was the operators' actions, but according to INSAG-7, the main cause was the reactor's design. Both IAEA reports identified an inadequate \\"safety culture\\" (INSAG-1 coined the term) at all managerial and operational levels as a major underlying factor of different aspects of the accident. This was stated to be inherent not only in operations but also during design, engineering, construction, manufacture and regulation. Views of the main causes were heavily lobbied by different groups, including the reactor's designers, power plant personnel, and the Soviet and Ukrainian governments. This was due to the uncertainty about the actual sequence of events and plant parameters. After INSAG-1 more information became available, and more powerful computing has allowed better forensic simulations. The INSAG-7 conclusion of major factors contributory to the accident was: > \\"The Accident is now seen to have been the result of concurrance of the > following major factors: specific physical characteristics of the reactor; > specific design features of the reactor control elements; and the fact that > the reactor was brought to a state not specified by procedures or > investigated by an independent safety body. Most importantly, the physical > characteristics of the reactor made possible its unstable behaviour.\\" = INSAG-1 report, 1986 = The first Soviet official explanation of the accident was by means of presentations from leading Soviet scientists and engineers to a large number of representatives from IAEA member states and other international organisations at the first Post-Accident Review Meeting, held at the IAEA in Vienna between 25 and 29 August 1986. This explanation effectively placed the blame on the power plant operators. The UKAEA INSAG-1 report followed shortly afterwards in September 1986, and on the whole also supported this view, based also on the information provided in discussions with the Soviet experts at the Vienna review meeting. In this view, the catastrophic accident was caused by gross violations of operating rules and regulations. For instance; \\"During preparation and testing of the turbine generator under run-down conditions using the auxiliary load, personnel disconnected a series of technical protection systems and breached the most important operational safety provisions for conducting a technical exercise.\\" It was stated that at the time of the accident the reactor was being operated with many key safety systems turned off, most notably the Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS), LAR (Local Automatic control system), and AZ (emergency power reduction system). Personnel had an insufficient understanding of technical procedures involved with the nuclear reactor, and knowingly ignored regulations to expedite the electrical test completion. Several procedural irregularities also helped to make the accident possible, one of which was insufficient communication between the safety officers and the operators in charge of the test. The main process computer, SKALA, was running in such a way that the main control computer could not shut down the reactor or even reduce power. Normally the computer would have started to insert all of the control rods. The computer would have also started the \\"Emergency Core Protection System\\" that introduces 24 control rods into the active zone within 2.5 seconds, which is still slow by 1986 standards. All control was transferred from the process computer to the human operators. It was held that the designers of the reactor considered this combination of events to be impossible and therefore did not allow for the creation of emergency protection systems capable of preventing the combination of events that led to the crisis, namely the intentional disabling of emergency protection equipment plus the violation of operating procedures. Thus the primary cause of the accident was the extremely improbable combination of rule infringement plus the operational routine allowed by the power station staff. On the disconnection of safety systems, Valery Legasov said in 1987, \\"It was like airplane pilots experimenting with the engines in flight.\\" In this analysis the operators were blamed, but deficiencies in the reactor design and in the operating regulations that made the accident possible were set aside and mentioned only casually. This view was reflected in numerous publications and artistic works on the theme of the Chernobyl accident that appeared immediately after the accident, and for a long time remained dominant in the public consciousness and in popular publications. = Soviet criminal trial 1987 = The trial took place from 7 to 30 July 1987 in a temporary courtroom set up in the House of Culture in the city of Chernobyl, Ukraine. Five plant employees (the former deputy chief engineer Anatoly S. Dyatlov; the former plant director Viktor P. Bryukhanov; the former chief engineer Nikolai M. Fomin; the shift director of Reactor 4, Boris V. Rogozhin; and the chief of Reactor 4, Aleksandr P. Kovalenko) and Gosatomenergonadzor (USSR State Committee on Supervision of Safe Conduct of Work in Atomic Energy) inspector Yuri A. Laushkin were sentenced to 10, 10, 10, five, three and two years respectively in labor camps. The families of Aleksandr Akimov, Leonid Toptunov and Valery Perevozchenko had received official letters but prosecution against the employees had been terminated at their deaths. Anatoly Dyatlov was found guilty \\"of criminal mismanagement of potentially explosive enterprises\\" and sentenced to 10 years imprisonment‚Äîof which he would serve three‚Äîfor the role that his oversight of the experiment played in the ensuing accident. = INSAG-7 report 1992 = Reactor hall No. 1 of the Chernobyl Plant A simplified diagram comparing the Chernobyl RBMK and the most common nuclear reactor design, the Light water reactor. RBMK issues: 1. Using a graphite moderator in a water cooled reactor, permitting criticality in a total loss of coolant accident. 2. A positive steam void coefficient that made the destructive power excursion possible. 3. Control rods design; taking 18‚Äì20 seconds to be fully inserted, and with graphite tips that increased reactivity initially. 4. No reinforced containment building. In 1991 a Commission of the USSR State Committee for the Supervision of Safety in Industry and Nuclear Power reassessed the causes and circumstances of the Chernobyl accident and came to new insights and conclusions. Based on that, INSAG published an additional report, INSAG-7, which reviewed \\"that part of the INSAG-1 report in which primary attention is given to the reasons for the accident,\\" and this included the text of the 1991 USSR State Commission report translated into English by the IAEA as Annex I. By the time of this report, Ukraine had declassified a number of KGB documents from the period between 1971 and 1988 related to the Chernobyl plant. It mentioned, for example, previous reports of structural damage caused by negligence during construction of the plant (such as splitting of concrete layers) that were never acted upon. They documented more than 29 emergency situations in the plant during this period, eight of which were caused by negligence or poor competence on the part of personnel. In the INSAG-7 report, most of the earlier accusations against staff for breach of regulations were acknowledged to be either erroneous, being based on incorrect information obtained in August 1986, or less relevant. The INSAG-7 report also reflected the view of the 1991 USSR State Commission account which held that the operators' actions in turning off the Emergency Core Cooling System, interfering with the settings on the protection equipment, and blocking the level and pressure in the separator drum did not contribute to the original cause of the accident and its magnitude, although they may have been a breach of regulations. In fact, turning off the emergency system designed to prevent the two turbine generators from stopping was not a violation of regulations. Soviet authorities had identified a multitude of operator actions as regulation violations in the original 1986 report while no such regulations were in fact in place. The primary design cause of the accident, as determined by INSAG-7, was a major deficiency in safety features, in particular the \\"positive scram\\" effect due to the control rods' graphite tips that actually initially increased reactivity when control rods entered the core to reduce reactivity. There was also an overly positive void coefficient of the reactor, whereby steam generated voids in the fuel cooling channels would increase reactivity because neutron absorption was reduced, resulting in more steam generation, and thereby more voids; a regenerative process. To avoid such conditions, it was necessary for the operators to track the value of the reactor operational reactivity margin (ORM) but this value was not readily available to the operators and they were not aware of the safety significance of ORM on void and power coefficients. However, regulations did forbid operating the reactor with a small margin of reactivity. Yet \\"post-accident studies have shown that the way in which the real role of the ORM is reflected in the Operating Procedures and design documentation for the RBMK-1000 is extremely contradictory\\", and furthermore, \\"ORM was not treated as an operational safety limit, violation of which could lead to an accident\\". Even in this revised analysis, the human factor remained identified as a major factor in causing the accident; particularly the operating crew's deviation from the test programme. \\"Most reprehensibly, unapproved changes in the test procedure were deliberately made on the spot, although the plant was known to be in a very different condition from that intended for the test.\\" This included operating the reactor at a lower power level than the prescribed 700 MW before starting the electrical test. The 1986 assertions of Soviet experts notwithstanding, regulations did not prohibit operating the reactor at this low power level. INSAG-7 also said, \\"The poor quality of operating procedures and instructions, and their conflicting character, put a heavy burden on the operating crew, including the chief engineer. The accident can be said to have flowed from a deficient safety culture, not only at the Chernobyl plant, but throughout the Soviet design, operating and regulatory organizations for nuclear power that existed at that time.\\" In summary, the major factors were: Positive void coefficient The reactor had a dangerously large positive void coefficient of reactivity. The void coefficient is a measurement of how a reactor responds to increased steam formation in the water coolant. Most other reactor designs have a negative coefficient, i.e. the nuclear reaction rate slows when steam bubbles form in the coolant, since as the steam voids increase, fewer neutrons are slowed down. Faster neutrons are less likely to split uranium atoms, so the reactor produces less power (negative feedback effect). Chernobyl's RBMK reactor, however, used solid graphite as a neutron moderator to slow down the neutrons, however the cooling water acts like a neutron absorber. Thus neutrons are moderated by the graphite even if steam bubbles form in the water. Furthermore, because steam absorbs neutrons much less readily than water, increasing the voids means that more moderated neutrons are able to split uranium atoms, increasing the reactor's power output. This was a positive feedback regenerative process which makes the RBMK design very unstable at low power levels, and prone to sudden energy surges to a dangerous level. This behaviour is counter-intuitive, and this property of the reactor was unknown to the crew. Control rod design There was a significant flaw in the design of the control rods that were inserted into the reactor to slow down the reaction rate by neutron absorption. In the RBMK design, the bottom tip of each control rod was made of graphite and was shorter than necessary. Only the upper part of the rod was made of boron carbide, which absorbs neutrons and thereby slows the reaction. With this design, when a rod was inserted from the fully retracted position, the graphite tip displaced neutron-absorbing water, initially causing fewer neutrons to be absorbed and increasing reactivity. For the first few seconds of rod deployment, reactor core power was therefore increased, rather than reduced. This feature of control rod operation was counter-intuitive and not known to the reactor operators. Management and operational deficiencies Other deficiencies were noted in the RBMK-1000 reactor design, as were its non-compliance with accepted standards and with the requirements of nuclear reactor safety. While INSAG-1 and INSAG-7 reports both identified operator error as an issue of concern, the INSAG-7 identified that there were numerous other issues that were contributing factors that led to the incident. These contributing factors include: # The plant was not designed to safety standards in effect and incorporated unsafe features # \\"Inadequate safety analysis\\" was performed # There was \\"insufficient attention to independent safety review\\" # \\"Operating procedures not founded satisfactorily in safety analysis\\" # Safety information not adequately and effectively communicated between operators, and between operators and designers # The operators did not adequately understand safety aspects of the plant # Operators did not sufficiently respect formal requirements of operational and test procedures # The regulatory regime was insufficient to effectively counter pressures for production # There was a \\"general lack of safety culture in nuclear matters at the national level as well as locally\\"  Fizzled nuclear explosion hypothesis  The force of the second explosion and the ratio of xenon radioisotopes released after the accident led Yuri V. Dubasov in 2009 to theorise that the second explosion could have been an extremely fast nuclear power transient resulting from core material melting in the absence of its water coolant and moderator. Dubasov argued that there was no delayed supercritical increase in power but a runaway prompt criticality which would have developed much faster. He felt the physics of this would be more similar to the explosion of a fizzled nuclear weapon, and it produced the second explosion. His evidence came from Cherepovets, Vologda Oblast, Russia, northeast of Chernobyl, where physicists from the V.G. Khlopin Radium Institute measured anomalous high levels of xenon-135 ‚Äî a short half-life isotope ‚Äî four days after the explosion. This meant that a nuclear event in the reactor may have ejected xenon to higher altitudes in the atmosphere than the later fire did, allowing widespread movement of xenon to remote locations. This was an alternative to the more accepted explanation of a positive- feedback power excursion where the reactor disassembled itself by steam explosion. The more energetic second explosion, which produced the majority of the damage, was estimated by Dubasov in 2009 as equivalent to 40 billion joules of energy, the equivalent of about 10 tons of TNT. Both his 2009 and 2017 analyses argue that the nuclear fizzle event, whether producing the second or first explosion, consisted of a prompt chain reaction that was limited to a small portion of the reactor core, since self-disassembly occurs rapidly in fizzle events. Dubasov's nuclear fizzle hypothesis was examined in 2017 by physicist Lars-Erik De Geer who put the hypothesized fizzle event as the more probable cause of the first explosion. De Geer commented: > \\"We believe that thermal neutron mediated nuclear explosions at the bottom > of a number of fuel channels in the reactor caused a jet of debris to shoot > upwards through the refuelling tubes.

The steam explosion which ruptured the reactor vessel occurred > some 2.7 seconds later.\\" Release and spread of radioactive materials Although it is difficult to compare releases between the Chernobyl accident and a deliberate air burst nuclear detonation, it has still been estimated that about four hundred times more radioactive material was released from Chernobyl than by the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki together. However, the Chernobyl accident only released about one hundredth to one thousandth of the total amount of radioactivity released during nuclear weapons testing at the height of the Cold War; the wide estimate being due to the different abundances of isotopes released. At Chernobyl approximately of land was significantly contaminated with fallout, with the worst hit regions being in Belarus, Ukraine and Russia. Lower levels of contamination were detected over all of Europe except for the Iberian Peninsula. The initial evidence that a major release of radioactive material was affecting other countries came not from Soviet sources, but from Sweden. On the morning of 28 April, workers at the Forsmark Nuclear Power Plant (approximately from the Chernobyl site) were found to have radioactive particles on their clothes. It was Sweden's search for the source of radioactivity, after they had determined there was no leak at the Swedish plant, that at noon on 28 April, led to the first hint of a serious nuclear problem in the western Soviet Union. Hence the evacuation of Pripyat on 27 April 36 hours after the initial explosions was silently completed before the disaster became known outside the Soviet Union. The rise in radiation levels had at that time already been measured in Finland, but a civil service strike delayed the response and publication. {class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" style=\\"margin:auto;\\" +Areas of Europe contaminated with 137Cs !rowspan=2Country !colspan=237‚Äì185 kBq/m2 !colspan=2185‚Äì555 kBq/m2 !colspan=2555‚Äì1,480 kBq/m2 !colspan=2> 1,480 kBq/m2 -style=font- weight:bold; !km2!! !km2!! !km2!! !km2!! -style=text-align:right; style=text- align:left;Belarus29,90014.410,2004.94,2002.02,2001.1 -style=text-align:right; style=text- align:left;Ukraine37,2006.23,2000.539000.156000.1 -style=text-align:right; style=text- align:left;Russia49,8000.295,7000.032,1000.013000.002 -style=text-align:right; style=text- align:left;Sweden12,0002.7‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî -style=text-align:right; style=text-align:left;Finland11,5003.4‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî -style=text- align:right; style=text-align:left;Austria8,60010.3‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî -style=text-align:right; style=text- align:left;Norway5,2001.3‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî -style=text-align:right; style=text-align:left;Bulgaria4,8004.3‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî -style=text- align:right; style=text-align:left;Switzerland1,3003.1‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî -style=text-align:right; style=text- align:left;Greece1,2000.91‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî -style=text-align:right; style=text-align:left;Slovenia3001.5‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî -style=text- align:right; style=text-align:left;Italy3000.1‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî -style=text-align:right; style=text- align:left;Moldova600.2‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî - !style=text- align:left;Totals !colspan=2162,160 km2 !colspan=219,100 km2 !colspan=27,200 km2 !colspan=23,100 km2 } Contamination from the Chernobyl accident was scattered irregularly depending on weather conditions, much of it deposited on mountainous regions such as the Alps, the Welsh mountains and the Scottish Highlands, where adiabatic cooling caused radioactive rainfall. The resulting patches of contamination were often highly localized, and localised water-flows contributed to large variations in radioactivity over small areas. Sweden and Norway also received heavy fallout when the contaminated air collided with a cold front, bringing rain. There was also groundwater contamination. Rain was deliberately seeded over of the Belorussian SSR by the Soviet air force to remove radioactive particles from clouds heading toward highly populated areas. Heavy, black-coloured rain fell on the city of Gomel. Reports from Soviet and Western scientists indicate that Belarus received about 60% of the contamination that fell on the former Soviet Union. However, the 2006 TORCH report stated that half of the volatile particles had landed outside Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia. A large area in Russia south of Bryansk was also contaminated, as were parts of northwestern Ukraine. Studies in surrounding countries indicate that more than one million people could have been affected by radiation. Recently published data from a long-term monitoring program (The Korma Report II) shows a decrease in internal radiation exposure of the inhabitants of a region in Belarus close to Gomel. Resettlement may even be possible in prohibited areas provided that people comply with appropriate dietary rules. In Western Europe, precautionary measures taken in response to the radiation included banning the importation of certain foods. In France officials stated that the Chernobyl accident had no adverse effects.:fr:Cons√©quences de la catastrophe de Tchernobyl en France = Relative isotopic abundances = The Chernobyl release was characterised by the physical and chemical properties of the radio-isotopes in the core. Particularly dangerous were the highly radioactive fission products, those with high nuclear decay rates that accumulate in the food chain, such as some of the isotopes of iodine, caesium and strontium. Iodine-131 was and caesium-137 remains the two most responsible for the radiation exposure received by the general population. Detailed reports on the release of radioisotopes from the site were published in 1989 and 1995, with the latter report updated in 2002. Contributions of the various isotopes to the atmospheric absorbed dose in the contaminated area of Pripyat, from soon after the accident to 27 years after the accident External relative gamma dose for a person in the open near the disaster site At different times after the accident, different isotopes were responsible for the majority of the external dose. The remaining quantity of any radioisotope, and therefore the activity of that isotope, after 7 decay half-lives have passed, is less than 1% of its initial magnitude, and it continues to reduce beyond 0.78% after 7 half-lives to 0.10% remaining after 10 half-lives have passed and so on. Some radionuclides have decay products that are likewise radioactive, which is not accounted for here. The release of radioisotopes from the nuclear fuel was largely controlled by their boiling points, and the majority of the radioactivity present in the core was retained in the reactor. * All of the noble gases, including krypton and xenon, contained within the reactor were released immediately into the atmosphere by the first steam explosion. The atmospheric release of xenon-133, with a half-life of 5 days, is estimated at 5200 PBq. * 50 to 60% of all core radioiodine in the reactor, about 1760 PBq (), or about , was released, as a mixture of sublimed vapour, solid particles, and organic iodine compounds. Iodine-131 has a half-life of 8 days. * 20 to 40% of all core caesium-137 was released, 85 PBq in all. Caesium was released in aerosol form; caesium-137, along with isotopes of strontium, are the two primary elements preventing the Chernobyl exclusion zone being re-inhabited. equals 24 kilograms of caesium-137. Cs-137 has a half-life of 30 years. * Tellurium-132, half-life 78 hours, an estimated 1150 PBq was released. * An early estimate for total nuclear fuel material released to the environment was %; this was later revised to %. This corresponds to the atmospheric emission of of fragmented fuel. Two sizes of particles were released: small particles of 0.3 to 1.5 micrometres, each an individually unrecognizable small dust or smog sized particulate matter and larger settling dust sized particles that therefore were quicker to fall-out of the air, of 10 micrometres in diameter. These larger particles contained about 80% to 90% of the released high boiling point or non-volatile radioisotopes; zirconium-95, niobium-95, lanthanum-140, cerium-144 and the transuranic elements, including neptunium, plutonium and the minor actinides, embedded in a uranium oxide matrix. The dose that was calculated is the relative external gamma dose rate for a person standing in the open. The exact dose to a person in the real world who would spend most of their time sleeping indoors in a shelter and then venturing out to consume an internal dose from the inhalation or ingestion of a radioisotope, requires a personnel specific radiation dose reconstruction analysis and whole body count exams, of which 16,000 were conducted in Ukraine by Soviet medical personnel in 1987. Environmental impact = Water bodies = Reactor and surrounding area in April 2009 The Chernobyl nuclear power plant is located next to the Pripyat River, which feeds into the Dnieper reservoir system, one of the largest surface water systems in Europe, which at the time supplied water to Kiev's 2.4 million residents, and was still in spring flood when the accident occurred. The radioactive contamination of aquatic systems therefore became a major problem in the immediate aftermath of the accident. In the most affected areas of Ukraine, levels of radioactivity (particularly from radionuclides 131I, 137Cs and 90Sr) in drinking water caused concern during the weeks and months after the accident, Guidelines for levels of radioiodine in drinking water were temporarily raised to 3,700 Bq/L, allowing most water to be reported as safe, Officially it was stated that all contaminants had settled to the bottom \\"in an insoluble phase\\" and would not dissolve for 800‚Äì1000 years. A year after the accident it was announced that even the water of the Chernobyl plant's cooling pond was within acceptable norms. Despite this, two months after the disaster the Kiev water supply was switched from the Dnieper to the Desna River. Meanwhile, massive silt traps were constructed, along with an enormous deep underground barrier to prevent groundwater from the destroyed reactor entering the Pripyat River. Groundwater was not badly affected by the Chernobyl accident since radionuclides with short half-lives decayed away long before they could affect groundwater supplies, and longer-lived radionuclides such as radiocaesium and radiostrontium were adsorbed to surface soils before they could transfer to groundwater. However, significant transfers of radionuclides to groundwater have occurred from waste disposal sites in the exclusion zone around Chernobyl. Although there is a potential for transfer of radionuclides from these disposal sites off-site (i.e. out of the exclusion zone), the IAEA Chernobyl Report argues that this is not significant in comparison to current levels of washout of surface-deposited radioactivity. Bio-accumulation of radioactivity in fish resulted in concentrations (both in western Europe and in the former Soviet Union) that in many cases were significantly above guideline maximum levels for consumption. Guideline maximum levels for radiocaesium in fish vary from country to country but are approximately 1000 Bq/kg in the European Union.EURATOM Council Regulations No. 3958/87, No. 994/89, No. 2218/89, No. 770/90 In the Kiev Reservoir in Ukraine, concentrations in fish were in the range of 3000 Bq/kg during the first few years after the accident. Radiation levels in 1996 around Chernobyl In small \\"closed\\" lakes in Belarus and the Bryansk region of Russia, concentrations in a number of fish species varied from 100 to 60,000 Bq/kg during the period 1990‚Äì92. The contamination of fish caused short-term concern in parts of the UK and Germany and in the long term (years rather than months) in the affected areas of Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia as well as in parts of Scandinavia. Chernobyl's radiocesium deposits were used to calibrate sedimentation samples from Lake Qattinah, Arabic: ÿ®ÿ≠Ÿäÿ±ÿ© ŸÇÿ∑ŸäŸÜÿ© in Syria. The provides a sharp, maximal, data point in radioactivity of the core sample at the 1986 depth, and acts as a date check on the depth of the in the core sample. = Flora and fauna = After the disaster, of pine forest directly downwind of the reactor turned reddish-brown and died, earning the name of the \\"Red Forest\\". Some animals in the worst-hit areas also died or stopped reproducing. Most domestic animals were removed from the exclusion zone, but horses left on an island in the Pripyat River from the power plant died when their thyroid glands were destroyed by radiation doses of 150‚Äì200 Sv. Some cattle on the same island died and those that survived were stunted because of thyroid damage. The next generation appeared to be normal.Piglet with dipygus on exhibit at the Ukrainian National Chernobyl MuseumOn farms in Narodychi Raion of Ukraine it is claimed that from 1986 to 1990 nearly 350 animals were born with gross deformities such as missing or extra limbs, missing eyes, heads or ribs, or deformed skulls; in comparison, only three abnormal births had been registered in the five years prior. =Human food chain= With radiocaesium binding less with humic acid, peaty soils than the known binding \\"fixation\\" that occurs on kaolinite rich clay soils, many marshy areas of Ukraine had the highest soil to dairy-milk transfer coefficients, of soil activity in ~ 200 kBq/m2 to dairy milk activity in Bq/L, that had ever been reported, with the transfer, from initial land activity into milk activity, ranging from 0.3‚àí2 to 20‚àí2 times that which was on the soil, a variance depending on the natural acidicity- conditioning of the pasture. In 1987, Soviet medical teams conducted some 16,000 whole-body count examinations on inhabitants in otherwise comparatively lightly contaminated regions with good prospects for recovery. This was to determine the effect of banning local food and using only food imports on the internal body burden of radionuclides in inhabitants. Concurrent agricultural countermeasures were used when cultivation did occur, to further reduce the soil to human transfer as much as possible. The expected highest body activity was in the first few years, where the unabated ingestion of local food, primarily milk consumption, resulted in the transfer of activity from soil to body; after the dissolution of the USSR, the now-reduced scale initiative to monitor the human body activity in these regions of Ukraine, recorded a small and gradual half-decadal-long rise, in internal committed dose, before returning to the previous trend of observing ever lower body counts each year. This momentary rise is hypothesized to be due to the cessation of the Soviet food imports together with many villagers returning to older dairy food cultivation practices and large increases in wild berry and mushroom foraging, the latter of which have similar peaty soil to fruiting body, radiocaesium transfer coefficients. After the disaster, of pine forest directly downwind of the reactor turned reddish-brown and died, earning the name of the \\"Red Forest\\", though it soon recovered. This photograph was taken years later, in March 2009, after the forest began to grow again, with the lack of foliage at the time of the photograph merely due to the local winter at the time. In a 2007 paper, a robot sent into the reactor itself returned with samples of black, melanin-rich radiotrophic fungi that grow on the reactor's walls. Of the 440,350 wild boar killed in the 2010 hunting season in Germany, approximately one thousand were contaminated with levels of radiation above the permitted limit of 600 becquerels of caesium per kilogram, of dry weight, due to residual radioactivity from Chernobyl. While all animal meat contains a natural level of potassium-40 at a similar level of activity, with both wild and farm animals in Italy containing \\"415 ¬± 56 becquerels kg‚àí1 dw\\" of that naturally occurring gamma emitter. The caesium contamination issue has historically reached some uniquely isolated and high levels approaching 20,000 Becquerels of caesium per kilogram in some specific tests; however, it has not been observed in the wild boar population of Fukushima after the 2011 accident. Evidence exists to suggest that the wild German and Ukrainian boar population are in a unique location were they have subsisted on a diet high in plant or fungi sources that biomagnifies or concentrates radiocaesium, with the most well known food source the consumption of the outer shell or wall of the \\"deer-truffle\\" elaphomyces which, along with magnifying radiocaesium, also magnifies or concentrates natural soil concentrations of arsenic. In 2015, long-term empirical data showed no evidence of a negative influence of radiation on mammal abundance. =Precipitation on distant high ground= On high ground, such as mountain ranges, there is increased precipitation due to adiabatic cooling. This resulted in localized concentrations of contaminants on distant areas; higher in Bq/m2 values to many lowland areas much closer to the source of the plume. This effect occurred on high ground in Norway and the UK. Norway The Norwegian Agricultural Authority reported that in 2009 a total of 18,000 livestock in Norway required uncontaminated feed for a period before slaughter, to ensure that their meat had an activity below the government permitted value of caesium per kilogram deemed suitable for human consumption. This contamination was due to residual radioactivity from Chernobyl in the mountain plants they graze on in the wild during the summer. 1,914 sheep required uncontaminated feed for a time before slaughter during 2012, with these sheep located in only 18 of Norway's municipalities, a decrease from the 35 municipalities in 2011 and the 117 municipalities affected during 1986. The after-effects of Chernobyl on the mountain lamb industry in Norway were expected to be seen for a further 100 years, although the severity of the effects would decline over that period. Scientists report this is due to radioactive caesium-137 isotopes being taken up by fungi such as Cortinarius caperatus which is in turn eaten by sheep while grazing. United Kingdom The United Kingdom restricted the movement of sheep from upland areas when radioactive caesium-137 fell across parts of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, and northern England. In the immediate aftermath of the disaster in 1986, the movement of a total of 4,225,000 sheep was restricted across a total of 9,700 farms, to prevent contaminated meat entering the human food chain. The number of sheep and the number of farms affected has decreased since 1986. Northern Ireland was released from all restrictions in 2000, and by 2009, 369 farms containing around 190,000 sheep remained under the restrictions in Wales, Cumbria, and northern Scotland. The restrictions applying in Scotland were lifted in 2010, while those applying to Wales and Cumbria were lifted during 2012, meaning no farms in the UK remain restricted because of Chernobyl fallout. The legislation used to control sheep movement and compensate farmers (farmers were latterly compensated per animal to cover additional costs in holding animals prior to radiation monitoring) was revoked during October and November 2012, by the relevant authorities in the UK. Had restrictions in the UK not occurred, a heavy consumer of lamb meat would likely have received a dose of 0.04 mSv over a lifetime.  Human impact  Pripyat lies abandoned with the Chernobyl facility visible in the distance =Acute radiation effects during emergency response and immediate aftermath= In the accident's aftermath, 237 people suffered from acute radiation sickness, of whom 31 died within the first three months.Mould (2000), p. 29. \\"The number of deaths in the first three months were 31.\\" In 2005, the Chernobyl Forum, composed of the International Atomic Energy Agency, other UN organizations, and the governments of Belarus, Russia and Ukraine, published a report on the radiological environmental and health consequences of the Chernobyl accident. In September 1987, the I.A.E.A. held an Advisory Group Meeting at the Curie Institute in Paris on the medical handling of the skin lesions relating to the acute deaths. The only known, causal deaths from the accident involved workers in the plant and firefighters. In reporter Grigori Medvedev's book on the accident, there were a number of fishermen on the reservoir a half-kilometer from the reactor to the east. Of these, two shore fishermen, Protosov and Pustavoit, are said to have sustained doses estimated at 400 roentgens, vomited, but survived. The vast majority of Pripyat residents slept through the distant sound of the explosion, including station engineer Breus, who only became aware at 6am, the beginning of his next work shift. He would later be taken to hospital and, while there, made the acquaintance of one teen who had ventured out alone by bicycle to watch the roof fires during the night, stopping for a time and viewing the scene at the \\"Bridge of Death\\" , however contrary to this sensationalist label, the youthful night biker was treated and released from hospital, remaining in touch with Breus as of 2019. With the exception of plant employee Shashenock, injured by the blast and never fully regaining consciousness, all serious cases of ARS were treated by the world specialist Dr. Robert Peter Gale, who documented a first of its kind treatment. In 2019, Gale would write a letter to correct the popularised, though egregious, portrayal of his patients as dangerous to visitors. All those who died were station operators and firefighters, over half of which from the continued wearing of dusty soaked uniforms, causing beta burns to cover large areas of skin. In the first few minutes to days, (largely due to Np-239, a 2.4-day half-life) the beta-to- gamma energy ratio is some 30:1, though while adding to the dose, no proximate deaths would be from the gamma fraction of exposure. Instead, owing to the large area of burned skin, bacterial infection was and remains the overarching concern to those afflicted with ARS, as a leading cause of death, quarantine from the outside environment is a part of the normal treatment protocol. Many of the surviving firefighters, continue to have skin that is atrophied, spider veined with underlying fibrosis due to experiencing extensive beta burns. The eventual medical report states that in those who were treated for ARS, 28 died from the acute radiation syndrome, each over the following days to months. In the years afterward, 15 people have died from thyroid cancer; it is roughly estimated that cancer deaths caused by Chernobyl may reach a total of about 4,000 among the five million persons residing in the contaminated areas. The report projected cancer mortality \\"increases of less than one percent\\" (~0.3%) on a time span of 80 years, cautioning that this estimate was \\"speculative\\" since at this time only a few cancer deaths are linked to the Chernobyl disaster. The report says it is impossible to reliably predict the number of fatal cancers arising from the incident as small differences in assumptions can result in large differences in the estimated health costs. The report says it represents the consensus view of the eight UN organizations. Of all 66,000 Belarusian emergency workers, by the mid-1990s their government reported that only 150 (roughly 0.2%) died. In contrast, in the much larger work force from Ukraine, numbered in the hundreds of thousands, some 5,722 casualties from a host of non-accident causes, were reported among Ukrainian clean-up workers up to the year 1995, by the National Committee for Radiation Protection of the Ukrainian Population. =Effects of main harmful radionuclides= The four most harmful radionuclides spread from Chernobyl were iodine-131, caesium-134, caesium-137 and strontium-90, with half-lives of 8.02 days, 2.07 years, 30.2 years and 28.8 years respectively. The iodine was initially viewed with less alarm than the other isotopes, because of its short half-life, but it is highly volatile and now appears to have travelled furthest and caused the most severe health problems. Strontium, on the other hand, is the least volatile of the four and is of main concern in the areas near Chernobyl itself. Iodine tends to become concentrated in thyroid and milk glands, leading, among other things, to increased incidence of thyroid cancers. The total ingested dose was largely from iodine and, unlike the other fission products, rapidly found its way from dairy farms to human ingestion. Similarly in dose reconstruction, for those evacuated at different times and from various towns, the inhalation dose was dominated by iodine (40%), along with airborne tellurium (20%) and oxides of rubidium (20%) both as equally secondary, appreciable contributors. Long term hazards such as caesium tends to accumulate in vital organs such as the heart, while strontium accumulates in bones and may thus be a risk to bone- marrow and lymphocytes. Radiation is most damaging to cells that are actively dividing. In adult mammals cell division is slow, except in hair follicles, skin, bone marrow and the gastrointestinal tract, which is why vomiting and hair loss are common symptoms of acute radiation sickness. = Assessment complications = By the year 2000, the number of Ukrainians claiming to be radiation 'sufferers' (poterpili) and receiving state benefits had jumped to 3.5 million, or 5% of the population. Many of these are populations resettled from contaminated zones or former or current Chernobyl plant workers. There was and remains a motivated 'push' to achieve 'sufferer' status as it gives access to state benefits and medical services that would otherwise not be made available. According to IAEA-affiliated scientific bodies, the apparent increases of ill health in this large group result partly from economic strains on these countries and poor health-care and nutrition; also, they suggest that increased medical vigilance following the accident, particularly a heightened overdiagnosis due to the Screening effect, has meant that many benign cases that would previously have gone unnoticed and untreated (especially of cancer) are now being registered. The World Health Organization states, \\"children conceived before or after their father's exposure showed no statistically significant differences in mutation frequencies\\". This statistically insignificant increase was also seen by independent researchers analyzing the children of the Chernobyl liquidators. =Disputed investigation= The two primary individuals involved with the attempt to suggest that the mutation rate among animals was, and continues to be, higher in the Chernobyl zone, are the Anders Moller and Timothy Mousseau group. Apart from continuing to publish experimentally unrepeatable and discredited papers, Mousseau routinely gives talks at the Helen Caldicott organized symposiums for \\"Physicians for Social Responsibility\\", an anti-nuclear advocacy group devoted to bring about a \\"nuclear free planet\\". Moreover, in years past, Moller was previously caught and reprimanded for publishing papers that crossed the scientific \\"misconduct\\"/\\"fraud\\" line. The duo have more recently attempted to publish meta-analyses, in which the primary references they weigh-up, analyze and draw their conclusions from is their own prior papers along with the discredited book Chernobyl: Consequences of the Catastrophe for People and the Environment. =Withdrawn investigation= In 1996, geneticist colleagues Ronald Chesser and Robert Baker published a paper on the thriving vole population within the exclusion zone, in which the central conclusion of their work was essentially that \\"The mutation rate in these animals is hundreds and probably thousands of times greater than normal\\". This claim occurred after they had done a comparison of the mitochondrial DNA of the \\"Chernobyl voles\\" with that of a control group of voles from outside the region. These alarming conclusions led the paper to appear on the front cover of the prestigious journal Nature. However, not long after publication, Chesser & Baker discovered a fundamental error in the interpretation of their data, and despite only the authors recognizing the error in which they had incorrectly classified the species of vole and therefore were comparing the genetics of two entirely different vole species to start with, the team made the decision to issue a retraction. = Abortions = Following the accident, journalists mistrusted many medical professionals (such as the spokesman from the UK National Radiological Protection Board), and in turn encouraged the public to mistrust them. Throughout the European continent, due to this media-driven framing of the slight contamination and in nations where abortion is legal, many requests for induced abortions of otherwise normal pregnancies, were obtained out of fears of radiation from Chernobyl, including an excess number of abortions in Denmark in the months following the accident. In Greece, following the accident, many obstetricians were unable to resist requests from worried pregnant mothers over fears of radiation. Although it was determined that the effective dose to Greeks would not exceed one mSv (100 mrem), a dose much lower than that which could induce embryonic abnormalities or other non- stochastic effects, there was an observed 2,500 excess of otherwise wanted pregnancies being terminated, probably out of fear in the mother of radiation risk. A slightly above the expected number of requested induced abortions occurred in Italy. Worldwide, an estimated excess of about 150,000 elective abortions may have been performed on otherwise healthy pregnancies out of fears of radiation from Chernobyl, according to Robert Baker and ultimately a 1987 article published by Linda E. Ketchum in the Journal of Nuclear Medicine which mentions but does not reference an IAEA source on the matter. The available statistical data excludes the Soviet‚ÄìUkraine‚ÄìBelarus abortion rates, as they are presently unavailable. From the available data, an increase in the number of abortions in what were healthy developing human offspring in Denmark occurred in the months following the accident, at a rate of about 400 cases. In Greece, there was an observed 2,500 excess of otherwise wanted pregnancies being terminated. In Italy, a \\"slightly\\" above the expected number of induced abortions occurred, approximately 100. No evidence of changes in the prevalence of human deformities/birth congenital anomalies that might be associated with the accident are apparent in Belarus or the Ukraine, the two republics that had the highest exposure to fallout. In Sweden and Finland where no increase in abortion rates occurred, it was likewise determined that \\"no association between the temporal and spatial variations in radioactivity and variable incidence of congenital malformations [was found].\\" A similar null increase in the abortion rate and a healthy baseline situation of no increase in birth defects was determined by assessing the Hungarian Congenital Abnormality Registry. Findings were also mirrored in Austria. Larger \\"mainly western European\\" data sets, approaching a million births in the EUROCAT database, divided into \\"exposed\\" and control groups were assessed in 1999. As no Chernobyl impacts were detected, the researchers conclude \\"in retrospect, the widespread fear in the population about the possible effects of exposure on the unborn fetus was not justified\\". Despite studies from Germany and Turkey, the only robust evidence of negative pregnancy outcomes that transpired after the accident were these elective abortion indirect effects, in Greece, Denmark, Italy etc., due to the anxieties that were created. In very high doses, it was known at the time that radiation could cause a physiological increase in the rate of pregnancy anomalies, but unlike the dominant linear-no threshold model of radiation and cancer rate increases, it was known, by researchers familiar with both the prior human exposure data and animal testing, that the \\"Malformation of organs appears to be a deterministic effect with a threshold dose\\" below which, no rate increase is observed. This teratology (birth defects) issue was discussed by Frank Castronovo of the Harvard Medical School in 1999, publishing a detailed review of dose reconstructions and the available pregnancy data following the Chernobyl accident, inclusive of data from Kiev's two largest obstetrics hospitals. Castronovo concludes that \\"the lay press with newspaper reporters playing up anecdotal stories of children with birth defects\\" is, together with dubious studies that show selection bias, the two primary factors causing the persistent belief that Chernobyl increased the background rate of birth defects. When the vast amount of pregnancy data does not support this perception as no women took part in the most radioactive liquidator operations, no in-utero individuals would have been expected to have received a threshold dose. In one small behavioral study in 1998, with low statistical power and limited multivariate analysis which, akin to the widely published Hiroshima and Nagasaki studies, investigated and selected the children; who were in utero during the rapidly dividing and therefore radiosensitive phase of neurogenesis (8 to 16 weeks of gestation), and whose mothers were evacuated from some of the more energetic hot-spot parts of the Chernobyl exclusion zone following the accident. From a random selection of 50 individuals in late- childhood in 1998, a low quality statistically-significant increase in the rate of severe IQ reduction was found, with a threshold of a suggested ~ 0.30 Sv (300 mSv) as a thyroid dose to the developing human head, for the beginning emergence of cerebral disorder. The Chernobyl liquidators, essentially an all- male civil defense emergency workforce, would go on to father normal children, without an increase in developmental anomalies or a statistically significant increase in the frequencies of germline mutations in their progeny. This normality is similarly seen in the children of the survivors of the Goi√¢nia accident. = Cancer assessments = A report by the International Atomic Energy Agency examines the environmental consequences of the accident. The United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation has estimated a global collective dose of radiation exposure from the accident \\"equivalent on average to 21 additional days of world exposure to natural background radiation\\"; individual doses were far higher than the global mean among those most exposed, including 530,000 primarily male recovery workers (the Chernobyl liquidators) who averaged an effective dose equivalent to an extra 50 years of typical natural background radiation exposure each. Estimates of the number of deaths that will eventually result from the accident vary enormously; disparities reflect both the lack of solid scientific data and the different methodologies used to quantify mortality‚Äîwhether the discussion is confined to specific geographical areas or extends worldwide, and whether the deaths are immediate, short term, or long term. In 1994, thirty-one deaths were directly attributed to the accident, all among the reactor staff and emergency workers. The Chernobyl Forum predicts that the eventual death toll could reach 4,000 among those exposed to the highest levels of radiation (200,000 emergency workers, 116,000 evacuees and 270,000 residents of the most contaminated areas); this figure is a total causal death toll prediction, combining the deaths of approximately 50 emergency workers who died soon after the accident from acute radiation syndrome, 15 children who have died of thyroid cancer and a future predicted total of 3,935 deaths from radiation-induced cancer and leukaemia. In a peer- reviewed paper in the International Journal of Cancer in 2006, the authors expanded the discussion on those exposed to all of Europe (but following a different conclusion methodology to the Chernobyl Forum study, which arrived at the total predicted death toll of 4,000 after cancer survival rates were factored in) they stated, without entering into a discussion on deaths, that in terms of total excess cancers attributed to the accident: Two anti-nuclear advocacy groups have publicized non-peer-reviewed estimates that include mortality estimates for those who were exposed to even smaller amounts of radiation. The Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) calculated that, among the hundreds of millions of people exposed worldwide, there will be an eventual 50,000 excess cancer cases, resulting in 25,000 excess cancer deaths, excluding thyroid cancer. However, these calculations are based on a simple linear no-threshold model multiplication and the misapplication of the collective dose, which the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) states \\"should not be done\\" as using the collective dose is \\"inappropriate to use in risk projections\\". Along similar lines to the UCS approach, the 2006 TORCH report, commissioned by the European Greens political party, likewise simplistically calculates an eventual 30,000 to 60,000 excess cancer deaths in total, around the globe. Thyroid cancer incidence in children and adolescents in Belarus While widely regarded as having a cause and effect relationship, the causality of Chernobyl with the increases in recorded rates of thyroid cancer is disputed, as in both the US and South Korea, upon the advent of ultrasonography and widespread medical screening, the latter recorded an almost identical epidemic in thyroid cancer rates, with South Korea reporting a 15 fold increase upon the switch of diagnostic tool, the highest thyroid cancer rate in the world. Yet the death rate from thyroid cancer has remained the same as prior to the technology. For these and other reasons, it is suggested that no reliable increase has been detected in the environs of Chernobyl, that cannot otherwise be explained as an artifact of the globally well documented Screening effect. In 2004, the UN collaborative, Chernobyl Forum, revealed thyroid cancer among children to be one of the main health impacts from the Chernobyl accident. This is due to the ingestion of contaminated dairy products, along with the inhalation of the short-lived, highly radioactive isotope, Iodine-131. In that publication, more than 4,000 cases of childhood thyroid cancer were reported. It is important to note that there was no evidence of an increase in solid cancers or leukemia. It said that there was an increase in psychological problems among the affected population. The WHO's Radiation Program reported that the 4,000 cases of thyroid cancer resulted in nine deaths. According to the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation, up to the year 2005, an excess of more than 6,000 cases of thyroid cancer had been reported. That is, over the estimated pre-accident baseline thyroid cancer rate, more than 6,000 casual cases of thyroid cancer have been reported in children and adolescents exposed at the time of the accident, a number that is expected to increase. They concluded that there is no other evidence of major health impacts from the radiation exposure. Well-differentiated thyroid cancers are generally treatable, and when treated the five-year survival rate of thyroid cancer is 96%, and 92% after 30 years. the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation had reported 15 deaths from thyroid cancer in 2011. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) also states that there has been no increase in the rate of birth defects or abnormalities, or solid cancers‚Äîsuch as lung cancer‚Äîcorroborating the assessments by the UN committee. UNSCEAR raised the possibility of long term genetic defects, pointing to a doubling of radiation-induced minisatellite mutations among children born in 1994. However, the risk of thyroid cancer associated with the Chernobyl accident is still high according to published studies. The German affiliate of the anti-nuclear energy organization, the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War suggest that 10,000 people are affected by thyroid cancer as of 2006, and that 50,000 cases are expected in the future. = Other disorders = Fred Mettler, a radiation expert at the University of New Mexico, puts the number of worldwide cancer deaths outside the highly contaminated zone at perhaps 5,000, for a total of 9,000 Chernobyl-associated fatal cancers, saying \\"the number is small (representing a few percent) relative to the normal spontaneous risk of cancer, but the numbers are large in absolute terms\\". The same report outlined studies based on data found in the Russian Registry from 1991 to 1998 that suggested that \\"of 61,000 Russian workers exposed to an average dose of 107 mSv about [five percent] of all fatalities that occurred may have been due to radiation exposure\\". The report went into depth about the risks to mental health of exaggerated fears about the effects of radiation. According to the IAEA the \\"designation of the affected population as \\"victims\\" rather than \\"survivors\\" has led them to perceive themselves as helpless, weak and lacking control over their future\\". The IAEA says that this may have led to behaviour that has caused further health effects. Fred Mettler commented that 20 years later: \\"The population remains largely unsure of what the effects of radiation actually are and retain a sense of foreboding. A number of adolescents and young adults who have been exposed to modest or small amounts of radiation feel that they are somehow fatally flawed and there is no downside to using illicit drugs or having unprotected sex. To reverse such attitudes and behaviours will likely take years, although some youth groups have begun programs that have promise.\\" In addition, disadvantaged children around Chernobyl suffer from health problems that are attributable not only to the Chernobyl accident, but also to the poor state of post-Soviet health systems. The United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR), part of the Chernobyl Forum, have produced their own assessments of the radiation effects. UNSCEAR was set up as a collaboration between various United Nation bodies, including the World Health Organization, after the atomic bomb attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, to assess the long-term effects of radiation on human health. = Long-term radiation deaths = The number of potential deaths arising from the Chernobyl disaster is heavily debated. The World Health Organization's prediction of 4,000 future cancer deaths in surrounding countries is based on the Linear no-threshold model (LNT), which assumes that the damage inflicted by radiation at low doses is directly proportional to the dose. Radiation epidemiologist Roy Shore contends that estimating health effects in a population from the LNT model \\"is not wise because of the uncertainties\\". According to the Union of Concerned Scientists the number of excess cancer deaths worldwide (including all contaminated areas) is approximately 27,000 based on the same LNT. Another study critical of the Chernobyl Forum report was commissioned by Greenpeace, which asserted that the most recently published figures indicate that in Belarus, Russia and Ukraine the accident could have resulted in 10,000‚Äì200,000 additional deaths in the period between 1990 and 2004. The Scientific Secretary of the Chernobyl Forum criticized the report's reliance on non-peer-reviewed locally produced studies. Although most of the study's sources were from peer-reviewed journals, including many Western medical journals, the higher mortality estimates were from non-peer- reviewed sources, while Gregory H√§rtl (spokesman for the WHO) suggested that the conclusions were motivated by ideology. Chernobyl: Consequences of the Catastrophe for People and the Environment is a 2007 Russian publication that concludes that there were 985,000 premature deaths as a consequence of the radioactivity released. The results were criticized by M. I. Balonov from the Institute of Radiation Hygiene in St. Petersburg, who described them as biased, drawing from sources that were difficult to independently verify and lacking a proper scientific base. Balanov expressed his opinion that \\"the authors unfortunately did not appropriately analyze the content of the Russian-language publications, for example, to separate them into those that contain scientific evidence and those based on hasty impressions and ignorant conclusions\\". According to U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission member and Professor of Health Physics Kenneth Mossman, the \\"LNT philosophy is overly conservative, and low-level radiation may be less dangerous than commonly believed.\\" Yoshihisa Matsumoto, a radiation biologist at the Tokyo Institute of Technology, cites laboratory experiments on animals to suggest there must be a threshold dose below which DNA repair mechanisms can completely repair any radiation damage. Mossman suggests that the proponents of the current model believe that being conservative is justified due to the uncertainties surrounding low level doses and it is better to have a \\"prudent public health policy\\". Another significant issue is establishing consistent data on which to base the analysis of the impact of the Chernobyl accident. Since 1991, large social and political changes have occurred within the affected regions and these changes have had significant impact on the administration of health care, on socio-economic stability, and the manner in which statistical data is collected. Ronald Chesser, a radiation biologist at Texas Tech University, says that \\"the subsequent Soviet collapse, scarce funding, imprecise dosimetry, and difficulties tracking people over the years have limited the number of studies and their reliability\\". = Socio-economic Impact = Abandoned buildings in Chernobyl Russian president Dmitry Medvedev and Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych laying flowers at the memorial to the victims of the Chernobyl disaster in April 2011. Exposition at Ukrainian National Chernobyl Museum It is difficult to establish the total economic cost of the disaster. According to Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet Union spent 18 billion rubles (the equivalent of US$2.5 billion at that time, or $ in today's dollars) on containment and decontamination, virtually bankrupting itself. In 2005, the total cost over 30 years for Belarus alone was estimated at US$235 billion; about $ in today's dollars given inflation rates. Gorbachev in April 2006 wrote \\"The nuclear meltdown at Chernobyl 20 years ago this month, even more than my launch of perestroika, was perhaps the real cause of the collapse of the Soviet Union.\\"Gorbachev, Mikhail (21 April 2006). \\"Turning Point at Chernobyl.\\" Japan Times. Retrieved 19 October 2020. Ongoing costs are well known; in their 2003‚Äì2005 report, The Chernobyl Forum stated that between five and seven percent of government spending in Ukraine is still related to Chernobyl, while in Belarus more than $13 billion is thought to have been spent between 1991 and 2003, with 22% of national budget having been Chernobyl-related in 1991, falling to six percent by 2002. In 2018, Ukraine spent five to seven percent of its national budget on recovery activities related to the Chernobyl disaster. Overall economic loss is estimated at $235 billion in Belarus. Much of the current cost relates to the payment of Chernobyl-related social benefits to some seven million people across the three countries. A significant economic impact at the time was the removal of of agricultural land and of forest from production. While much of this has been returned to use, agricultural production costs have risen due to the need for special cultivation techniques, fertilizers and additives. Politically, the accident gave great significance to the new Soviet policy of glasnost, and helped forge closer Soviet‚ÄìUS relations at the end of the Cold War, through bioscientific cooperation. The disaster also became a key factor in the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, and a major influence in shaping the new Eastern Europe. Both Ukraine and Belarus, in their first months of independence, lowered legal radiation thresholds from the Soviet Union's previous, elevated thresholds (from 35 rems per lifetime under the USSR to 7 rems per lifetime in Ukraine and 0.1 rems per year in Belarus).  Long term site remediation  Portraits of deceased Chernobyl liquidators used for an anti-nuclear power protest in Geneva Following the accident, questions arose about the future of the plant and its eventual fate. All work on the unfinished reactors No. 5 and No. 6 was halted three years later. However, the trouble at the Chernobyl plant did not end with the disaster in reactor No. 4\\\\. The damaged reactor was sealed off and of concrete was placed between the disaster site and the operational buildings. The work was managed by Grigoriy Mihaylovich Naginskiy, the deputy chief engineer of Installation and Construction Directorate ‚Äì 90. The Ukrainian government allowed the three remaining reactors to continue operating because of an energy shortage in the country. = Decommissioning of other reactors = In October 1991, a fire broke out in the turbine building of reactor No. 2; the authorities subsequently declared the reactor damaged beyond repair, and it was taken offline. Reactor No. 1 was decommissioned in November 1996 as part of a deal between the Ukrainian government and international organizations such as the IAEA to end operations at the plant. On 15 December 2000, then-President Leonid Kuchma personally turned off reactor No. 3 in an official ceremony, shutting down the entire site. Site polled in May 2008 reports shutdown for units 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively at 30 November 1996, 11 October 1991, 15 December 2000 and 26 April 1986. = No. 4 reactor confinement = New Safe Confinement in 2017 Soon after the accident, the reactor building was quickly encased by a mammoth concrete sarcophagus in a notable feat of construction under severe conditions. Crane operators worked blindly from inside lead-lined cabins taking instructions from distant radio observers, while gargantuan- sized pieces of concrete were moved to the site on custom-made vehicles. The purpose of the sarcophagus was to stop any further release of radioactive particles into the atmosphere, mitigate damage should the core go critical and explode, and provide safety for the continued operations of adjacent reactors one through three. The concrete sarcophagus was never intended to last very long, with a lifespan of only 30 years. On 12 February 2013, a section of the roof of the turbine-building collapsed, adjacent to the sarcophagus, causing a new release of radioactivity and temporary evacuation of the area. At first it was assumed that the roof collapsed because of the weight of snow, however the amount of snow was not exceptional, and the report of a Ukrainian fact-finding panel concluded that the collapse was the result of sloppy repair work and aging of the structure. Experts warned the sarcophagus itself was on the verge of collapse. In 1997, the international Chernobyl Shelter Fund was founded to design and build a more permanent cover for the unstable and short-lived sarcophagus. It received more than ‚Ç¨810 million and was managed by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). The new shelter was named the New Safe Confinement and construction began in 2010. It is a metal arch high and spanning built on rails adjacent to the reactor No. 4 building so that it could be slid over top the existing sarcophagus. The New Safe Confinement was completed in 2016 and slid into place over top the sarcophagus on 29 November. The huge steel arch was moved into place over several weeks. Unlike the original sarcophagus, the New Safe Confinement is designed to allow the reactor to be safely dismantled using remotely operated equipment. = Waste management = Used fuel from units 1‚Äì3 was stored in the units' cooling ponds, and in an interim spent fuel storage facility pond, ISF-1, which now holds most of the spent fuel from units 1‚Äì3, allowing those reactors to be decommissioned under less restrictive conditions. Approximately 50 of the fuel assemblies from units 1 and 2 were damaged and required special handling. Moving fuel to ISF-1 was thus carried out in three stages: fuel from unit 3 was moved first, then all undamaged fuel from units 1 and 2, and finally the damaged fuel from units 1 and 2. Fuel transfers to ISF-1 were completed in June 2016. A need for larger, longer-term radioactive waste management at the Chernobyl site is to be fulfilled by a new facility designated ISF-2. This facility is to serve as dry storage for used fuel assemblies from units 1‚Äì3 and other operational wastes, as well as material from decommissioning units 1‚Äì3 (which will be the first RBMK units decommissioned anywhere). A contract was signed in 1999 with Areva NP (now Framatome) for construction of ISF-2. In 2003, after a significant part of the storage structures had been built, technical deficiencies in the design concept became apparent. In 2007, Areva withdrew and Holtec International was contracted for a new design and construction of ISF-2. The new design was approved in 2010, work started in 2011, and construction was completed in August 2017. ISF-2 is the world's largest nuclear fuel storage facility, expected to hold more than 21,000 fuel assemblies for at least 100 years. The project includes a processing facility able to cut the RBMK fuel assemblies and to place the material in canisters, to be filled with inert gas and welded shut. The canisters are then to be transported to dry storage vaults, where the fuel containers will be enclosed for up to 100 years. Expected processing capacity is 2,500 fuel assemblies per year.  Fuel-containing materials  According to official estimates, about 95% of the fuel in reactor No. 4 at the time of the accident (about ) remains inside the shelter, with a total radioactivity of nearly 18 million curies (670 PBq). The radioactive material consists of core fragments, dust, and lava-like \\"fuel containing materials\\" (FCM)‚Äîalso called \\"corium\\"‚Äîthat flowed through the wrecked reactor building before hardening into a ceramic form. Three different lavas are present in the basement of the reactor building: black, brown, and a porous ceramic. The lava materials are silicate glasses with inclusions of other materials within them. The porous lava is brown lava that dropped into water and thus cooled rapidly. It is unclear how long the ceramic form will retard the release of radioactivity. From 1997 to 2002, a series of published papers suggested that the self-irradiation of the lava would convert all into a submicrometre and mobile powder within a few weeks. It has been reported that the degradation of the lava is likely to be a slow, gradual process, rather than sudden and rapid. The same paper states that the loss of uranium from the wrecked reactor is only per year; this low rate of uranium leaching suggests that the lava is resisting its environment. The paper also states that when the shelter is improved, the leaching rate of the lava will decrease.  Exclusion zone  zone of alienation around Chernobyl An area originally extending in all directions from the plant is officially called the \\"zone of alienation.\\" The area has largely reverted to forest, and has been overrun by wildlife because of a lack of competition with humans for space and resources. Even today, radiation levels are so high that the workers responsible for rebuilding the sarcophagus are only allowed to work five hours a day for one month before taking 15 days of rest. Some sources have given estimates for when the site would be considered habitable again: * 320 years or less (Ukraine state authorities, c. 2011) * 20,000 years or more (Chernobyl director Ihor Gramotkin, c. 2016) * Tens of thousands of years (Greenpeace, March 2016) * 3,000 years (Christian Science Monitor, 2016) , 187 locals had returned and were living permanently in the zone. In 2011 Ukraine opened up the sealed zone around the Chernobyl reactor to tourists who wish to learn more about the tragedy that occurred in 1986. Sergii Mirnyi, a radiation reconnaissance officer at the time of the accident, and now an academic at National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy, has written about the psychological and physical effects on survivors and visitors, and worked as an advisor to Chernobyl tourism groups. = Forest fire concerns = During the dry seasons, a perennial concern is forests that have been contaminated by radioactive material catching on fire. The dry conditions and build-up of debris make the forests a ripe breeding ground for wildfires. Depending on the prevailing atmospheric conditions, the fires could potentially spread the radioactive material further outwards from the exclusion zone in the smoke. In Belarus, the Bellesrad organization is tasked with overseeing the food cultivation and forestry management in the area. In April 2020 forest fires spread through the exclusion zone reaching over 20,000 ha and caused an increase of radiation resulting from release of cesium 137 and strontium 90 from the ground and biomass at levels that were detectable by the monitoring network but did not pose any threat to human health. An average resident of Kyiv the dose estimated as result of the fires was 1 nSv.  Recovery projects  The Chernobyl Trust Fund was created in 1991 by the United Nations to help victims of the Chernobyl accident. It is administered by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, which also manages strategy formulation, resources mobilization, and advocacy efforts. Beginning 2002, under the United Nations Development Programme, the fund shifted its focus from emergency assistance to long-term development. The Chernobyl Shelter Fund was established in 1997 at the Denver 23rd G8 summit to finance the Shelter Implementation Plan (SIP). The plan calls for transforming the site into an ecologically safe condition by means of stabilization of the sarcophagus followed by construction of a New Safe Confinement (NSC). While the original cost estimate for the SIP was US$768 million, the 2006 estimate was $1.2 billion. The SIP is being managed by a consortium of Bechtel, Battelle, and , and conceptual design for the NSC consists of a movable arch, constructed away from the shelter to avoid high radiation, to be slid over the sarcophagus. The NSC was moved into position in November 2016 and is expected to be completed in late-2017. In 2003, the United Nations Development Programme launched the Chernobyl Recovery and Development Programme (CRDP) for the recovery of the affected areas. The programme was initiated in February 2002 based on the recommendations in the report on Human Consequences of the Chernobyl Nuclear Accident. The main goal of the CRDP's activities is supporting the Government of Ukraine in mitigating long-term social, economic, and ecological consequences of the Chernobyl catastrophe. CRDP works in the four most Chernobyl-affected areas in Ukraine: Kyivska, Zhytomyrska, Chernihivska and Rivnenska. More than 18,000 Ukrainian children affected by the disaster have been treated at Cuba's Tarar√° resort town since 1990. The International Project on the Health Effects of the Chernobyl Accident was created and received US$20 million, mainly from Japan, in hopes of discovering the main cause of health problems due to iodine-131 radiation. These funds were divided among Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia, the three main affected countries, for further investigation of health effects. As there was significant corruption in former Soviet countries, most of the foreign aid was given to Russia, and no positive outcome from this money has been demonstrated. In 2019, it became known that the then-current Ukrainian government aimed to make Chernobyl a tourist attraction.  Nuclear debate  Nuclear power protest in Berlin, 2011 The Chernobyl accident attracted a great deal of interest. Because of the distrust that many people had in the Soviet authorities, a great deal of debate about the situation at the site occurred in the First World during the early days of the event. Because of defective intelligence based on satellite imagery, it was thought that unit number three had also suffered a dire accident. Journalists mistrusted many professionals, and they in turn encouraged the public to mistrust them. The accident raised the already heightened concerns about fission reactors worldwide, and while most concern was focused on those of the same unusual design, hundreds of disparate nuclear reactor proposals, including those under construction at Chernobyl, reactors numbers 5 and 6, were eventually cancelled. With ballooning costs as a result of new nuclear reactor safety system standards and the legal and political costs in dealing with the increasingly hostile/anxious public opinion, there was a precipitous drop in the rate of new startups after 1986. The accident also raised concerns about the cavalier safety culture in the Soviet nuclear power industry, slowing industry growth and forcing the Soviet government to become less secretive about its procedures. The government coverup of the Chernobyl disaster was a catalyst for glasnost, which \\"paved the way for reforms leading to the Soviet collapse.\\" Numerous structural and construction quality issues as well as deviations from the original design of the plant were known to KGB at least since 1973 and passed to the Central Committee which did not take any actions and classified it. In Italy, the Chernobyl accident was reflected in the outcome of the 1987 referendum. As a result of that referendum, Italy began phasing out its nuclear power plants in 1988, a decision that was effectively reversed in 2008. A 2011 referendum reiterated Italians' strong objections to nuclear power, thus abrogating the government's decision of 2008. In Germany, the Chernobyl accident led to the creation of a federal environment ministry, after several states had already created such a post. The minister was given the authority over reactor safety as well, which the current minister still holds . The events are also credited with strengthening the anti-nuclear movement in Germany, which culminated in the decision to end the use of nuclear power that was made by the 1998‚Äì2005 Schr√∂der government.Hanneke Brooymans. France, Germany: A tale of two nuclear nations, The Edmonton Journal, 25 May 2009. In direct response to the Chernobyl disaster, a conference to create a Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident was called in 1986 by the International Atomic Energy Agency. The resulting treaty has bound signatory member states to provide notification of any nuclear and radiation accidents that occur within its jurisdiction that could affect other states, along with the Convention on Assistance in the Case of a Nuclear Accident or Radiological Emergency. The Chernobyl, along with the space shuttle Challenger disaster, the Three Mile Island accident, and the Bhopal disaster have been used together as case studies, both by the US government and by third parties, in research concerning the root causes of such disasters, such as sleep deprivation and mismanagement.

History =Rockhampton= Commencing in 1997, the Electric Tilt Train operates from Brisbane to Rockhampton. With a top service speed of and the ability to tilt five degrees in each direction, the Tilt Train is one of the fastest trains in Australia, having the same maximum allowed speed in revenue service as the V/Line VLocity, Transwa Prospector railcar and New South Wales XPT although the XPT rarely operates above 120km/h(75mph) due to poor track conditions . The train operates on the North Coast line and serves the intermediate towns of Gympie, Maryborough, Bundaberg and Gladstone. The electric Tilt Trains run in a multiple unit configuration. In May 1999 the tilt train achieved a top speed under test conditions of 210km/hr driven by Greg Roberston. Business class seating arrangement of a Diesel Tilt Train The Electric Tilt Train features 2√ó2 economy seating, and 1√ó2 business class seating, mainscreen visual entertainment along with in-seat audio entertainment. Economy class passengers have a regular trolley service and a buffet style galley food service, while business class has a frequent trolley service and passenger attendants to tend to the needs of the passengers. =Cairns= The Diesel Tilt Train, operating from Brisbane to Cairns, features a 2√ó2 premium economy class seating arrangement, 1√ó2 business class seating arrangement (Railbed), in-seat audio and visual entertainment and a TV screen attached to the headrest of the seat in front. A trolley service is available in the Railbed carriages, and a club car is available 24 hours. In October 2013 when the first refurbished set returned to traffic, the service was named the Spirit of Queensland. In 2014 an additional train was delivered to operate a replacement The Sunlander between Brisbane and Cairns, meaning the only service on this 1681km route since that time has been the Spirit of Queensland.

She has acted in some of the most critically acclaimed films in Bengali cinema and considered one of the greatest actresses of Bengali cinema. Early life Madhabi Mukherjee was born on 10 February 1942. She was raised with her sister, Manjari, by their mother in Kolkata, in what was then Bengal, India. As a young girl, she became involved in the theater. She worked on stage with doyens such as Sisir Bhaduri, Ahindra Choudhury, Nirmalendu Lahiri and Chhabi Biswas. Some of the plays she acted in included Naa and Kalarah. She made her film debut as a child artist in Premendra Mitra's Dui beaee\\". First films Mukherjee first made a major impact with Mrinal Sen's Baishey Shravan (Wedding Day) in 1960. The film is set in a Bengal village just before and during the horrific famine of 1943 in Bengal that saw over 5 million die. Mukherjee plays a 16-year-old girl who marries a middle-aged man. Initially, she brightens up his life but then World War II and the Bengal Famine hits them. The couple's marriage disintegrates. Her next major film was Ritwik Ghatak's Subarnarekha (The Golden Thread ) made in 1962, but released in 1965 ‚Äì the last in a trilogy examining the socio-economic implications of partition, the other two being Meghe Dhaka Tara (The Cloud-Capped Star) (1960) and Komal Gandhar (E-Flat) (1961). It is also perhaps Ritwik Ghatak's most complex film. In the film, Ghatak depicts the economic and socio-political crisis of Bengal from 1948 to 1962; how the crisis has first and foremost left one bereft of one's conscience, one's moral sense. Mukherjee plays Sita, the younger sister of Ishwar (Abhi Bhattacharya), who kills herself when‚Äîas a prostitute waiting for her first customer‚Äîshe finds out the customer is none other than her estranged brother. Working with Satyajit Ray In the early 1960s, she was recruited by Satyajit Ray to portray the role of Arati in the 1963 film Mahanagar (The Big City). Recalling her meeting with Ray, Mukherjee wrote: In Mahanagar, Mukherjee plays Arati, who takes a job as a saleswoman due to financial constraints in the family. The large joint family is horrified at the thought of a working woman. For Arati, going door to door selling knitting machines opens up a whole new world and new friends and acquaintances, including an Anglo-Indian friend, Edith. Earning money also raises Arati's status in the family especially when her husband (Anil Chatterjee) loses his job. When Edith is sacked unfairly, Arati resigns in protest...Mukherjee's towering performance as Arati dominates the film. Film critic Roger Ebert wrote: \\"It might be useful to see the performance of Madhabi Mukherjee in this film. She is a beautiful deep, wonderful actress who simply surpasses all ordinary standards of judgment.\\" This film was soon followed by her portrayals of Charu in Charulata (The Lonely Wife), the 1964 film based on Rabindranath Tagore's novella Nashtanir (The Broken Nest, 1901). Mukherjee's stunning portrayal of Charulata, a bored and neglected housewife of Calcutta in the 19th century, is a towering performance in the history of Indian cinema. Mukherjee reached the peak of her career with this film, possibly Ray's greatest film as well, the Apu trilogy notwithstanding. As the bored and neglected housewife in Victorian Calcutta of the 1870s who gets attracted to her husband's cousin Amal (Soumitra Chatterjee), Mukherjee makes the central role of Charu her own. It is without doubt one of the greatest performances of Indian cinema. She lives the role. She is Charulata. To date, Mukherjee in Charulata remains the benchmark for what an ideal Tagore heroine should be; it is said that when Ray returned to Tagore with Ghare Baire (1984) (The Home and the World), he stylised Swatilekha Chatterjee in a manner similar to Madhabi in Charulata. Mukherjee's third and last film with Ray was Kapurush (The Coward) in 1965. The film looks at Amitabha Roy (Soumitra Chatterjee), a screenwriter whose car breaks down in a small town. He lodges with a local resident, Bimal Gupta (Haradhan Bannerjee). Bimal is married to Karuna (Mukherjee), who was a former girlfriend of Amitabha, a fact of which Bimal is unaware. After Satyajit Ray Though she remained a big star in the Bengali commercial film industry, after Kapurush, Mukherjee failed to reach such critical heights as her films with Ritwik Ghatak and Satyajit Ray again. Her major films after Kapurush include Calcutta 71 in 1972 by Mrinal Sen, Biraj Bou in 1972 by Manu Sen, Strir Patra in 1972 by Purnendu Patri, Ganadevata in 1978 by Tarun Majumdar, Bancharamer Bagan in 1980 by Tapan Sinha, Chokh in 1982, Chhandaneer in 1989 by Utpalendu Chakrabarty and Utsab in 2000 by Rituparno Ghosh. Personal life Mukherjee is married to Bengali film actor Nirmal Kumar. They have two daughters, but are currently separated. She wrote her autobiography Ami Madhabi in 1995.

It culminated on 4 March 1942, with an unsuccessful attack carried out by two Kawanishi H8K \\"Emily\\" flying boats. This was the longest distance ever undertaken by a two-plane bombing mission, and one of the longest bombing sorties ever planned without fighter escort.Budnick, p. 95 Planning The planning for Operation K began in the weeks after the attack on Pearl Harbor, when the Imperial Japanese Navy high command considered how to take advantage of the capabilities of the long-range Kawanishi H8K flying boats. Plans to bomb California and Texas were being discussed, when the need for updated information regarding the repairs to US Navy facilities at Pearl Harbor took precedence. An assessment of the repairs to the docks, yards and airfields of Oahu would help the IJN staff to determine American ability to project power for months to come. Initial plans called for the use of five H8K aircraft. They would fly to French Frigate Shoals, the largest atoll in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, to be refueled by submarines prior to taking off for Oahu. The raid was planned to coincide with the full moon to illuminate the Pearl Harbor target area, but the actual date of execution would depend on calm weather for refueling at French Frigate Shoals and clear skies over Pearl Harbor. If the first raid was successful, additional raids would be made. In a repeat of events just prior to the 7 December attack, American codebreakers warned that the Japanese were preparing for reconnaissance and disruption raids, refueling at French Frigate Shoals, and again were largely ignored by their superiors. The codebreakers had reason to correctly interpret the Japanese intent. Edwin T. Layton's staff included Lieutenant Jasper Holmes, who, writing under the pen name Alec Hudson, had a story entitled Rendezvous published in an August, 1941, Saturday Evening Post. His fictitious story about refueling United States planes from submarines at a remote island for an air attack on a target 3000 miles away had been withheld from publication for a year until the author convinced United States Navy censors the techniques described were known to other navies. Execution When time came for the raid, only two of the big flying boats were available. Pilot Lieutenant Hisao Hashizume was in command of the mission, with Ensign Shosuke Sasao flying the second airplane. They were sent to Wotje Atoll in the Marshall Islands, where each airplane was loaded with four bombs.Simpson p. 112 From there, they flew to French Frigate Shoals to refuel, then set off for Oahu, distant. In addition to their reconnaissance mission, they were to bomb the \\"Ten-Ten\\" dock ‚Äì named for its length, ‚Äì at the Pearl Harbor naval base to disrupt salvage and repair efforts. However, errors ensued on both sides. The Japanese submarine I-23 was supposed to station itself just south of Oahu as a \\"lifeguard\\" and weather spotter for the flying boats, but was lost sometime after 14 February. Japanese cryptanalysts had broken the United States Navy weather code, but a code change on 1 March eliminated that alternative source of weather information over Pearl Harbor. The mission proceeded on the assumption of clear skies over Pearl Harbor from knowledge of conditions at French Frigate Shoals. American radar stations on Kauai (and later Oahu) picked up and tracked the two planes as they approached the main Hawaiian Islands, prompting a search by Curtiss P-40 Warhawk fighters. Consolidated PBY Catalina flying boats were also sent to seek Japanese aircraft carriers, which were assumed to have launched the two invaders. However, a thick layer of nimbus clouds over Pearl Harbor prevented the defenders from spotting the Japanese planes flying at an altitude of . Those same clouds also confused the IJN pilots. Using the Kaena Point lighthouse for a position fix, Hashizume decided to attack from the north. Sasao, however, did not hear Hashizume's order and instead turned to skirt the southern coast of Oahu. Hashizume, having lost sight of his wingman, and only able to see small patches of the island, dropped his four bombs on the slopes of Tantalus Peak, an extinct volcano cinder cone just north of Honolulu sometime between 02:00 and 02:15 HST. He was unable to see Pearl Harbor, the only lit facility on Oahu due to blackout conditions intended to hinder air raids. Hashizume's bombs landed about from Roosevelt High School, creating craters deep and across. Damage was limited to shattered windows.Simpson p. 113 Sasao is assumed by historians and officials to have eventually dropped his bombs into the ocean, either off the coast of Waianae or near the sea approach to Pearl Harbor. The two flying boats then flew southwest toward the Marshall Islands. Sasao returned as planned to Wotje atoll, but Hashizume's airplane had sustained hull damage while taking off from French Frigate Shoals. Fearing the primitive base at Wotje was insufficient to repair the damage, Hashizume proceeded non-stop all the way to their home base at Jaluit Atoll, also in the Marshall Islands. That made his flight the longest bombing mission in history up to that point. Aftermath President Theodore Roosevelt High School in Honolulu was damaged by bombs dropped nearby from Operation K. There were no American casualties. The raid did raise new fears of a potential Japanese invasion of Hawaii. Japanese media repeated an unsubstantiated Los Angeles radio report of \\"considerable damage to Pearl Harbor\\" with 30 dead sailors and civilians, with 70 wounded. Both the U.S. Army and U.S. Navy blamed each other for the explosions, accusing each other of jettisoning munitions into Tantalus. Another armed reconnaissance mission, scheduled for 6Horn, p. 127 or 7 March, was canceled because of the delay in launching the first raid, damage to Hashizume's airplane, and the aircrews' exhaustion. It was carried out on 10 March 1942, but Hashizume was killed when his flying boat was shot down by Brewster F2A Buffalo fighters near Midway Atoll.Steve Horn 2005, page 141. A followup to Operation K was scheduled for 30 May, to gain intelligence on the whereabouts of U.S. aircraft carriers prior to the Battle of Midway. However, the Americans had become aware French Frigate Shoals were a possible IJN rendezvous point, and naval patrols were increased, per Admiral Chester Nimitz's orders. A Japanese submarine found the area mined and spotted two American warships at anchor there, prompting a cancellation of the plan, despite the proposed use of Necker Island as an alternative refueling site. This left IJN unable to observe U.S. Navy activity, or to keep track of the American carriers. See also *Lookout Air Raids References *Budnick, Rich (2005).

The fatigue limit, also known as the endurance limit or fatigue strength, is the stress level below which an infinite number of loading cycles can be applied to a material without causing fatigue failure. Ferrous alloys and titanium alloys have a distinct limit. Other structural metals, such as aluminium and copper, do not have a distinct limit and will eventually fail even from small stress amplitudes. In these cases, the term endurance strength is used. Endurance strength is defined as the maximum value of completely reversed bending stress that a material can withstand for a finite number of cycles without a fatigue failure. Definitions The ASTM defines fatigue strength, S_{N_f}, as the value of stress at which failure occurs after N_f cycles, and fatigue limit, S_f, as the limiting value of stress at which failure occurs as N_f becomes very large. ASTM does not define endurance limit, the stress value below which the material will withstand many load cycles, but implies that it is similar to fatigue limit. Some authors use endurance limit, S_e, for the stress below which failure never occurs, even for an indefinitely large number of loading cycles, as in the case of steel; and fatigue limit or fatigue strength, S_f, for the stress at which failure occurs after a specified number of loading cycles, such as 500 million, as in the case of aluminium. Other authors do not differentiate between the expressions even if they do differentiate between the two types of materials. Typical values Typical values of the limit (S_e) for steels are 1/2 the ultimate tensile strength, to a maximum of . For iron, aluminium, and copper alloys, S_e is typically 0.4 times the ultimate tensile strength. Maximum typical values for irons are , aluminums , and coppers . Note that these values are for smooth \\"un-notched\\" test specimens. The endurance limit for notched specimens (and thus for many practical design situations) is significantly lower. For polymeric materials, the fatigue limit has been shown to reflect the intrinsic strength of the covalent bonds in polymer chains that must be ruptured in order to extend a crack. So long as other thermo chemical processes do not break the polymer chain (i.e. ageing or ozone attack), a polymer may operate indefinitely without crack growth when loads are kept below the intrinsic strength. The concept of fatigue limit, and thus standards based on a fatigue limit such as ISO 281:2007 rolling bearing lifetime prediction, remains controversial, at least in the US. History The concept of endurance limit was introduced in 1870 by August W√∂hler.W. Schutz (1996). A history of fatigue. Engineering Fracture Mechanics 54: 263-300. DOI However, recent research suggests that endurance limits do not exist for metallic materials, that if enough stress cycles are performed, even the smallest stress will eventually produce fatigue failure.

The Welsh name refers to the mouth of the Afon Llynfi which enters the River Wye a mile from the village. The nearest town is Hay-on-Wye some 5 miles (8.5 km) to the North East. Aberllynfi parish Aberllynfi was once a separate ecclesiastical parish, but its church fell into disuse in the 18th century.Rev. W.E.T. Morgan, Hay and neighbourhood, 1932. The curious English name of the village is comparatively recent and was taken from the former railway station (Three Cocks Junction, now a garden centre) where the Hereford, Hay and Brecon Railway met the Mid-Wales Railway. The station derived its name from the 15th century Three Cocks Inn (a coaching inn, still extant) which in turn took its name from the armorial bearings of former local landowners, the Williams family of Old Gwernyfed. These were supposed to have been based on the arms of the medieval Welsh prince Einon Sais, who lived in Aberllynfi, but this is probably a later invention. The station, together with all the services which ran through it, was closed in December 1962. Thomas Edwards, a former innkeeper of the Three Cocks, was also a bridge-builder, constructing the 7-arch Glasbury Bridge in 1777 (destroyed by floods in 1795) and rebuilding the 3-arch bridge over the Llynfi at Pont Ithel in 1783.A.W. Skempton, A biographical dictionary of civil engineers in Great Britain and Ireland, Vol.1, pp 210-211 (2002) Gwernyfed The original house and deer park of Old Gwernyfed, to the south of the village, is of medieval origin, but the house was extensively rebuilt in the 17th century. In 1600 it was purchased by Sir David Williams, MP for the Borough of Brecon (1584‚Äì93, 1597‚Äì1604). In 1613, it was inherited by his son, Sir Henry Williams, MP for the Borough of Brecon (1601‚Äì04) and for Breconshire (1620‚Äì28). His son, also Sir Henry Williams, was also MP for Breconshire (1628‚Äì29). On 6 August 1645, he was said to have entertained King Charles I at Gwernyfed, following Charles' defeat at the Battle of Naseby.J. Britton et al., The Beauties of England and Wales, p. 100 (1815) Curiously, Sir Edward Williams was not a relation (despite his surname), but married the family heiress in 1675. This seems to have ensured that he too became MP for Breconshire (1697‚Äì98, 1705‚Äì21). In 1776, Thomas Wood also married the family heiress. Their son, Thomas Wood, was MP for Breconshire for forty-one years (1806‚Äì47). He enjoyed the friendship of members of the royal family and King George IV visited him at Old Gwernyfed. The house is now a grade I listed building. Gwernyfed Park, a much later Jacobean-style house within the deer park, was built for Captain Thomas Wood, MP for Middlesex, by William Eden Nesfield in the 1870s. During the Second World War, it was requisitioned and used by the South Wales Borderers. Since 1950, it has formed part of Gwernyfed High School. A rugby union club, Gwernyfed RFC, was founded at the school in the 1960s, but now plays at and represents the nearby town of Talgarth. Gwernyfed Park is now a grade II* listed building. Following local government reorganization in 1974, Aberllynfi has been placed in the Community of Gwernyfed, together with the neighbouring village of Felindre and the southern part of the village of Glasbury.

It has 703 rooms and suites and contains casino, recording studio, Michelin-starred restaurant and 2,500-seat concert theater. The Fantasy Tower is also home to several nightlife venues including Moon Nightclub and The View. The tower holds what are known as the Sky Villas and Fantasy Suites, which are some of the most expensive hotel suites in the world. The two story Sky Villa on the top floor, billed at per night, is listed at number 5 on the World's 15 Most Expensive Hotel Suites compiled by CNN Go in March 2012. History Palms Casino Resort in 2007 The Palms project was first developed by the Maloof family in July 1999, during the Fiesta hotel-casino expansion. The casino resort broke ground in July 2000. The project was officially announced by George Maloof on October 24, 2000. Construction was completed on September 26, 2001. The Palms opened on November 15, 2001. Dennis Rodman, Pamela Anderson, Paris Hilton and Samuel L. Jackson attended the opening. In 2002, it was the resort where participants of MTV's The Real World: Las Vegas stayed. The level they rebuilt to accommodate MTV is now the \\"Real World Suite\\" billed at $10,000 per night. On October 27, 2005, the second tower, named the \\"Fantasy Tower\\", opened at a cost of $600 million. In keeping with George Maloof's basketball interest (the Maloofs were majority owners of the NBA's Sacramento Kings), the Fantasy Tower includes a two-story, suite that includes the only basketball court in a hotel suite. The suite includes a locker room, scoreboard, and multi-screen entertainment system. Some of the other fantasy rooms include the G suite, the Barbie suite and the King Pin suite. The Palms hit financial trouble in 2010, when it started missing loan payments. Under an agreement reached with creditors TPG Capital and Leonard Green & Partners, they each received a 49% stake in the property in November 2011, in exchange for erasing about $400 million in debt. The Maloof family retains a 2% share, with options to buy back up to 20%, and George Maloof continues to manage the property. In May 2016, Station Casinos agreed to purchase the Palms for $313 million. The company subsequently began a $620 million renovation, and renovated portions of the resort began opening in May 2018. The three-phase renovation project was expected to be finished in late 2019. On April 28, 2018, 84% of employees voted in favor of unionizing the property in a vote organized by the Bartenders Union and the Culinary Workers Union and supervised by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). It is the fifth Station Casinos property to be unionized.

He was a Liberal Party member for the Division of Lyons in the Tasmanian House of Assembly from 1996 until his resignation in 2019. From 2002 until 2006 he was also leader of the Liberal Party and Leader of the Opposition in Tasmania.  Upbringing and early career  Hidding immigrated to Tasmania from the Netherlands in his youth. He was educated in Launceston at Riverside High School and Launceston Matriculation College where he gained an Associate Diploma Business (Real Estate). He was a self-employed businessman (his companies included Hidding Trading Pty Ltd, Hiddings Mitre 10, Hiddings Building Services, Span Truss Systems and Hiddings Joinery) before entering politics, when he sold his business to Gunns Limited.  Political career  Hidding was an Alderman on the Launceston City Council from 1985 to 1992. He was an unsuccessful Liberal candidate for the Australian House of Representatives seat of Franklin in 1993. In 1996, Hidding was elected to the Tasmanian House of Assembly for the multi-member seat of Lyons. Between 1996 and 1998 Hidding held junior positions in the government of Tony Rundle, including Secretary to Cabinet, Deputy Chairman of Committees and a member of the Cabinet Budget Committee. After the Liberals lost office, Hidding was elected to the Opposition front bench as Deputy Opposition Leader in 1999, and in August 2002 he was elected Leader of the Opposition. He was also Shadow Minister for Tourism, Parks and Heritage and Shadow Minister for Resources and Energy. At the 18 March 2006 state election, Hidding failed to defeat the incumbent Labor Party government led by Paul Lennon. Despite an increase in the Liberal Party's primary vote, the Opposition failed to make any gains in terms of seats. On election night, Hidding declined to speculate on whether he would continue as Opposition Leader. Twelve days later, on 30 March, the day that final election results were known, Will Hodgman was unanimously elected by the party as its new leader.http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200603/s1604983.htm On 4 May 2018, following the election of the Liberal Government, Hidding was appointed as Parliamentary Secretary to Premier Will Hodgman. Hidding resigned from parliament on 25 February 2019, following allegations of historic sexual abuse against a minor, published in The Australian. Hidding denied the allegations and said he would confront them as a private citizen. In September 2019, the police announced that Hidding would not be charged over the allegations, with the Director of Public Prosecutions determining that \\"given the constraints posed by the passage of time and the resulting impact on the evidence available, there was no reasonable prospect of conviction\\".

Approximately 5 miles north of Wrexham along the A541 road, it is contiguous with the main village of Caergwrle and closely related to the village of Hope. In the 19th century there was a turnpike road known as Abermorddu Branch running from the tollhouse at King's Ferry to Abermorddu. Its name probably comes from the confluence (aber) of a small brook called Morddu with the River Alyn.Davies, Ellis (1959) Flintshire Place-names, UWP, p.1 Landmarks Abermorddu Primary School, although originally in the village, has for the many decades had its site in Cefn-y-bedd, whilst the local secondary school is in nearby Hope. To the northwest along the A541 is the ruins of Caergwrle Castle. It was probably built by Dafydd ap Gruffydd after being given land by Edward I after his initial conquest of Wales in 1277. It was damaged by the Welsh in 1282, and ceded to John of Cromwell in 1308 to rebuild it, but by 1335 it was in ruins and has remained as such.

Three other founder members, NHK, KBS/MBC-Korea and IRIB, joined in April 1984. It became a fully digital station in January 2001. The news exchange had one daily satellite feed until May 2005, when a second feed was launched to handle the growing number of offers from members. The Friedrich Ebert Foundation (FES) of Germany provided extensive support to the news exchange in its early years. In 1990 Dr Erich Vogt of FES wrote: \\"The launching of Asiavision has changed the whole scenario relating to the flow of information in the Asia-Pacific region.\\"The Socio-Economic Impact of Broadcast Satellites with reference to the Asiavision TV News Exchange System, by Erich Vogt.

The first is from 0830 to 0900 GMT and the second from 1215 to 1235 GMT. Transmission is on AsiaSat 5. More than 9,000 items are exchanged each year. Besides the daily transmissions, news flashes are arranged for important, breaking stories such as natural disasters or major political events. Among the major news events covered by Asiavision in 2011 were the earthquake and tsunami in Japan on 11 March, which claimed more than 15 thousand lives. Japan's public broadcaster, NHK, has covered the aftermath on a daily basis for the news exchange.  File transfer system  Asiavision has launched a file transfer system for exchanging news items online. It operates alongside the existing satellite-based news exchange. Members upload and download news stories by logging into the Asiavision file transfer website. Members underwent file transfer training at a meeting of Asiavision news and technical coordinators in New Delhi in November 2009, hosted by DDI.  Training  Asiavision organises funded training courses for its members. The latest are the Asianews project, a series of regional news workshops being held in partnership with Canal France International (CFI), and a Sports News Workshop in Kuala Lumpur in June 2011.

June 28, 2013), known professionally as Matt Borne, was an American professional wrestler. Osborne was a second generation wrestler, the son of Tony Borne, and is best known as being the first wrestler to portray the character of Doink the Clown.Turnbuckle Tales with Matt Borne Professional wrestling career =National Wrestling Alliance (1978‚Äì1984)= Under the ring name Matt Borne, Osborne debuted on December 6, 1978 and wrestled for various National Wrestling Alliance territories, most prominently for Pacific Northwest Wrestling, where he was their heavyweight and four-time tag champion. Borne also would regularly referee matches while in Portland as that territory had only one primary referee (Sandy Barr) and it was not uncommon for wrestlers there to ref when not working a match: his officiating indeed became part of several major angles. In Mid Atlantic Championship Wrestling on June 6, 1980, he won his first championship, also the first of two tag titles he would hold with Buzz Sawyer. In Mid-South Wrestling, he allied with Ted DiBiase and Jim Duggan as a member of The Rat Pack, a heel stable, and won their tag title with DiBiase. In Canada, he worked for All Star Wrestling and Maple Leaf Wrestling. =World Wrestling Federation (1985‚Äì1986)= Borne debuted in the WWF on March 2, 1985, wrestling Rick McGraw to a time-limit draw in the Boston Garden. He was primarily a jobber, though occasionally beat other jobbers at house shows. The highlight of this stint was losing to Ricky \\"The Dragon\\" Steamboat at the first WrestleMania in Madison Square Garden. His last match was a loss to George Wells in the Cow Palace on April 29, 1986. =World Class Championship Wrestling (1986‚Äì1989)= In May 1986, Borne joined World Class Championship Wrestling. That September, he reformed his tag team with Buzz Sawyer under the management of Percival Pringle III to win a one-day tournament to crown new World Tag Team Champions. He also won the Texas Heavyweight Championship and defended the title at the Christmas Star Wars event against The Iron Sheik. Borne and Sawyer feuded with fellow Pringle protege Dingo Warrior after falling out with him during a six-man tag match, with Warrior turning babyface as a direct result of the incident.PWI Centrefold - The Ultimate Warrior, Pro Wrestling Illustrated June 1988 =World Championship Wrestling (1991‚Äì1992)= In 1991, Osborne signed with World Championship Wrestling and debuted as Big Josh, an outdoorsman who danced with bears and was friends with Tommy Rich. He debuted as a fan that would run in from the crowd with an axe handle to save babyfaces from villainous attacks by heels. During his stint with WCW, Osborne won the United States Tag Team Championship with Ron Simmons and the World Six-Man Tag Team Championship with Dustin Rhodes and Tom Zenk. Borne made his final pay-per-view appearance for the company on May 17, 1992 at WrestleWar, where he defeated Richard Morton; and continued to make sporadic WCW TV appearances throughout the summer of 1992 before leaving the company. =Return to WWF/E (1992‚Äì1993, 2007)= After leaving WCW in 1992, Osborne returned to the World Wrestling Federation on September 21, 1992 in Manitoba, Canada at a WWF Superstars taping. Competing as himself, he defeated Bill Jordan. Borne would shortly thereafter become Doink the Clown, in a villainous clown gimmick that would frequently pull tricks on wrestlers at ringside as well as fans. He made his in ring televised debut on the January 31, 1993 edition of Wrestling Challenge defeating Bob East. He would also briefly use the character in United States Wrestling Association in February before returning to WWF television in March. Soon after his televised return, he began feuding with Crush after attacking him with a prosthetic arm on an episode of Superstars of Wrestling, which subsequently resulted in a match at WrestleMania IX. During this match, another Doink (Steve Keirn) came out from under the ring and attacked Crush with another prosthetic arm, allowing the real Doink to pin Crush. In the spring of 1993, Doink was given the opportunity to enter the King of the Ring tournament, facing Mr. Perfect in the qualifying round. After two time-limit draws, Mr. Perfect defeated Doink in their third match. At the Pay Per View itself, Doink (or rather, two Doinks) distracted Crush causing him to lose to Intercontinental Champion Shawn Michaels. Doink spent the summer months of 1993 continuing his feud with Crush as well as successful house show runs against Marty Jannetty and the 1-2-3 Kid, as well as occasionally losing to higher profile opponents like Bret Hart or Tatanka. At SummerSlam, Jerry Lawler hired Doink to wrestle Hart as he feigned injury, which \\"the Hitman\\" won by disqualification when Lawler interfered. Several days later, Doink turned against Lawler, by inciting a mocking chant from the fans directed at him. On the September 13, 1993 Raw, Doink poured a pail of water over Bobby Heenan, marking his fan favorite turn. On a December episode of Raw, Doink was given a present from Santa Claus in the form of a midget in the Doink costume, which he named Dink. Shortly afterward, however, Osborne was fired for re-occurring drug abuses. His final TV appearance in the WWF for that era was on the December 27, 1993 episode of Raw. Osborne cited in a shoot interview that Bam Bam Bigelow did not like putting over Osborne. Osborne said this subsequently led to Bigelow snitching on him for smoking weed in the hallway of his hotel and getting him fired from the WWF. Following his departure, Doink was played by Ray Licameli (also known as Ray Apollo). On December 10, 2007, Osborne reprised the role of Doink at Raw's 15th Anniversary as he took part in a Legends Battle Royal. =Extreme Championship Wrestling (1994)= Following his departure from the WWF, Borne appeared in Extreme Championship Wrestling for a handful of matches as Doink. However, the fans hated this, as ECW was viewed as an alternative to the WWF and WCW and seeing a gimmick like this made Doink a villain for a completely different reason. After Doink lost a match to then-World Heavyweight Champion Shane Douglas, Douglas went on to criticize Vince McMahon for turning a talented wrestler like Borne into a comic relief character, and claimed that he knew how to bring out Borne's full potential. Borne then changed his ring name to Borne Again, and continued wearing the clown suit, albeit without the wig, wearing a minimal amount of face paint, as well as growing out his hair and beard. After beating his opponents, he would make them dress in clown outfits. However, his tenure with the company was short-lived due to personal problems. =Semi-retirement (1994‚Äì2013)= Since leaving ECW, Osborne wrestled on the independent circuit, for several reunion shows and for various independent promotions under his Matt Borne ring name. In 2005, at WrestleReunion II Borne participated in an eight-man tag team match alongside Andrew Martin, Steve Corino and The Masked Superstar. However, his team lost to Dusty Rhodes, The Blue Meanie, Tom Prichard and D'Lo Brown. In early 2010, Osborne reinvented the Doink character to resemble Heath Ledger's portrayal of The Joker in The Dark Knight, nicknaming the incarnation 'Reborne Again'. The new character debuted on March 27 for ISPW in New Jersey. On May 23, 2010 Doink the Clown, portrayed by Dusty Wolfe, interfered against Skandor Akbar and his men Dr. Knuckles and Rommel. This caused them to lose the Wrecking Ball Wrestling tag titles. In retaliation Akbar called on the original Doink (Matt Borne). They were scheduled to meet on August 15, 2010. At that time Wolfe no-showed the event to avoid the wrath of Borne. On August 8, 2010, Borne won the Wrecking Ball Wrestling Championship. After this, Osborne returned to a full-time schedule, continuing to compete on a semi-regular basis all over the United States for the last several years until a few days before his death on June 28, 2013. Death Osborne was found dead on June 28, 2013, in the Plano, Texas apartment he lived in. Though no weapons were found near his body, and police said the death appeared accidental, they launched a precautionary homicide investigation. The cause of death was later determined to be an accidental overdose of morphine and hydrocodone. He also suffered from heart disease, which had been a contributing factor in his death. In June 2015, a wrongful death lawsuit was filed against WWE, alleging that \\"WWE created a culture of violence and sacrificed Matt Osborne‚Äôs brain for its own profit\\" which \\"led to further illnesses and injuries, including depression and drug abuse, which ultimately resulted in his untimely death.\\" WWE attorney Jerry McDevitt said the suit was without merit and blamed the attorneys for taking advantage of the families involved. The suit was filed by Michelle James, the mother of two of Osborne's four children, and was litigated by attorney Konstantine Kyros, who has been involved in a number of other lawsuits against WWE. The lawsuit was dismissed by US District Judge Vanessa Lynne Bryant, who ruled that they failed to show that his death was linked to chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Other media Matt Osborne (as Doink) appeared in WWF Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game in 1995 on Arcade,Sega Genesis,Sega 32X,Sega Saturn,Super Nintendo,MS-DOS & PS1 from Acclaim and SmackDown vs. Raw 2009 from THQ as a DLC character in 2008. However, he did not appear in any other licensed wrestling game afterwards.

An animal sanctuary is a facility where animals are brought to live and to be protected for the rest of their lives. Pattrice Jones, co-founder of VINE Sanctuary defines an animal sanctuary as \\"a safe-enough place or relationship within the continuing hazards that menace everybody\\". In addition, sanctuaries are an experimental staging ground for transformative human-animal relations. There are four types of animal sanctuaries reflective of the species-belonging of the residents: 1) companion animal sanctuaries; 2) wildlife sanctuaries; 3) exotic animal sanctuaries; and 4) farmed animal sanctuaries. Unlike animal shelters, sanctuaries do not seek to place animals with individuals or groups, instead maintaining each animal until their natural death. However, they can offer rehoming services. In some cases, an establishment may have characteristics of both a sanctuary and a shelter; for instance, some animals may be in residence temporarily until a good home is found and others may be permanent residents. The mission of sanctuaries is generally to be safe havens, where the animals receive the best care that the sanctuaries can provide. Animals are not bought, sold, or traded, nor are they used for animal testing. Additionally, no parts of nor secretions from the animals are commodified, such as eggs, wool, or milk. The resident animals are given the opportunity to behave as natural as possible in a protective environment. Overview What distinguishes a sanctuary from other institutions is the philosophy that the residents come first. In a sanctuary, every action is scrutinized for any trace of human benefit at the expense of non-human residents. Sanctuaries act on behalf of the animals, and the caregivers work under the notion that all animals in the sanctuary, human and non-human, are of equal importance. Most sanctuaries are not open to the public in the sense of a zoo; that is, allowing unescorted public access to the facility. A legitimate sanctuary avoids activity that would place the animals in an unduly stressful situation. Most sanctuaries are also not government-funded and are usually nonprofit. Public help is accepted by sanctuaries in the form of volunteering, monetary contributions, donations of food and materials, spreading the word, and in some cases, adoption. One of the most important missions of sanctuaries, beyond caring for the animals, is educating the public. The ultimate goal of many sanctuaries is to change the way that humans think of, and treat, non-human animals. # Companion animal sanctuaries # Wildlife sanctuaries # Exotic animal sanctuaries # Farmed animal sanctuaries  Farmed animal sanctuaries  Farmed animal sanctuaries (FAS) provide care, shelter and advocacy of farmed animal species such as chickens, cows, goats, fish, horses, pig, turkeys, and sheep. The farm sanctuary layout tends to resemble traditional farms however functions differently. FAS as a movement began with Gene Baur, the co-founder of Farm Sanctuary, the first official farm sanctuary that opened in 1986. The daily tasks of a FAS involve the primary guardians, volunteers and at time visitors. Each day is structured by routines such as feeding, care and health procedures, as well as cleaning and maintenance. Points of conflict for sanctuaries include human intervention in matters of sterilizing animals and species segregation. Moreover, effective altruists have critiqued the efficiency of FAS's ability to reduce animal suffering as demonstrated in the \\"arithmetic of compassion,\\" a utilitarian measure of advocacy that applies mathematical formulas to reduce the most amount of suffering in light of individual lives. Jon Bockman of Animal Charity Evaluators, states, \\"expending too many resources on direct rescue results in less money directed toward education and a lower overall impact in helping animals, and all advocates should give consideration to this concern when deciding how best to help animals\\". = Education = The educational role is a secondary role role of FAS. Investing in transforming visitors and volunteers perspectives on animal agriculture is a key component of FAS enlisting farmed animal residents as \\"ambassadors\\" of their species and serve a fundraiser role. = FAS models = Sue Donaldson and Will Kymlicka have outlined two different types of FAS models. FAS can be distinguished by ascribing to either refuge and advocacy model or intentional community model.  Refuge- and advocacy-based models  Refuge- and advocacy-based models are the most standard. These sanctuaries are found in traditional agricultural communities in part because of the physical and legal infrastructure. Six characteristics of this model include: duty of care, support for species- typical flourishing, recognition of individuality, non-exploitation, non- perpetuation, and awareness and advocacy. The latter characteristic has launched a series of questions into the effectiveness of the educational component of sanctuaries.  Intentional community model  The intentional community model addresses the shortcomings of the standard sanctuary model by focusing on movement building that includes a spectrum of speciesist issues such as developing farmed animal veterinary care that exist outside of standard practices that have aimed at meeting animal agricultural interests. The six characteristics of the intentional community model include: belonging, absence of fixed hierarchical relationships, self-determination, citizenship, dependent agency, and scaffolded choices and reconfigured spaces. These characteristics redress some of the critiques of the refuge and advocacy model by grounding sanctuary practices in animal agency and expanding the geographical boundaries of where animals can live. Expanding the geographies in which farmed animals are found serve as a corrective to forming human- farmed animal friendships. An example of the intentional sanctuary model can be found in the Microsanctuary Movement started by Rosemary and Justin Van Kleeck. The Microsanctuary Movement encourages city-dwellers to rescue farmed animals to expand what species are considered to be companion animals. Similarly, Darren Chang, co-founder of the Riverdale Farm Sanctuary Project has launched a campaign to transform Riverdale Farms, an urban farm in Toronto into a FAS advocating for: 1) Animal Rescue, Refuge, and Advocacy, 2) Compassion and Nonviolence, 3) Ecological and Food Justice and Compassionate Interspecies Community. Expanding beyond the traditional role of a safe haven for farmed animals, sanctuaries can also be understood as playing political roles in transforming the political and spatial lives of animal residents and their broader species communities leaning into pioneering a less-speciesist future.  Services provided  Veterinarian, Amanda Jeffries, examines patient's teeth to check hygiene status. Animal sanctuary services include spaying and neutering, hygiene, and physical wellbeing. These services are mainly performed by licensed veterinarians. Other positions that can be held by people at sanctuaries include specialized animal trainers, groomers, and volunteers. When it comes to new residents, they are typically not used to living with a large population of their kind and can be easily overwhelmed or agitated. Because of this, they can be held for a certain amount of time before being admitted to the general public. In this time, veterinarians study the new animal's behavioral and dietary habits and try for a smooth transition into the sanctuary's environment. Also, some species of animals, dogs for example, are social creatures. In isolation they get lonely and become depressed. Animal sanctuaries often accommodate these types of animals by putting them in living quarters where they're in groups or pairs that they fit well with. Enrichment activities are also available for the residents. Accreditation There are two primary organizations that provide accreditation and support for animal sanctuaries: the Global Federation of Animal Sanctuaries and the American Sanctuary Association. In the United States, sanctuaries must also be licensed by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and regularly inspected by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) for compliance with the Animal Welfare Act.

The musical, described by Steven Suskin as \\"massive\\", was set in the East End of London during the Blitz (the aerial bombings during World War II). The story drew on Bart's childhood memories of London's Jewish East End during the Blitz and, like most musicals, centred on a romance between a young couple, in this case a Jewish woman and a Cockney man, although the largest role and main point-of-view character is that of Mrs Blitztein, the young woman's mother.Suskin 2005, Mandelbaum 2005. Steven Suskin describes it as \\"Abie's Irish Rose set against the burning of Atlanta.\\"Suskin 2005. Bart himself described the play as \\"‚Ä¶three human stories inside an epic canvas; the major human conflictthe major plotpersonifies the spirit of London and how that spirit developed during the period of the piece.\\"Mandelbaum 2005 Production history Blitz! opened in London on 8 May 1962 at the Adelphi Theatre, while Bart's enormous West End success Oliver! was still running at the New Theatre; at that time Oliver! had not yet been produced on Broadway. Blitz ran for 568 performances. It never ran on Broadway: between its scale and the fact that New Yorkers could hardly be expected to share Londoners' nostalgia for the period, it proved \\"unexportable\\". Bart wrote the music and lyrics, and had directed the original London production himself; Joan Maitland contributed to the libretto. Sean Kenny designed the elaborate sets, which included representations of Victoria Station, Petticoat Lane, and the Bank underground station, not to mention London on fire during an air raid. Four revolving house units and an enormous, mobile bridge, carried on two shifting towers, made it, at the time, the most expensive West End musical ever produced. No√´l Coward called it \\"twice as loud and twice as long as the real thing.\\" The song \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\" was specially written by Bart for Vera Lynn. Lynn had been a star at the time of the German bombing attacks; in the play, the characters listen to Lynn sing it on the radio while they shelter underground. Lynn did not actually appear onstage during the production, but she recorded the song for it, and the production used her recording on the \\"radio\\". The play also makes use of a recording of a Winston Churchill radio speech.Guinness Stage Musicals The role of Mrs Blitztein was played by Amelia Bayntun in the original cast; it was her only role in a stage musical. The cast included a large number of children. There is a scene in which the children are to be evacuated from London; they cheerfully sing \\"We‚Äôre Going To The Country\\", while their mothers try to put on a cheerful face. The children's chorus \\"Mums and Dads\\" was a \\"showstopper\\"The Independent, Obituary. https://www.independent.co.uk/arts- entertainment/obituary-lionel-bart-1085282.html that drew much radio play. The musical was never seen for many years, largely because the original scores went missing during Bart's turbulent years. It was reassembled in Australia by 19-year-old Andrew Jarrett, a Bart devotee, with orchestrations by Kevin Hocking, Jack Westmore and Stephen Smith. So impressed was Bart, that he came out of obscurity and travelled to Australia for Jarrett's triumphant production in 1985. The Royal Shakespeare Company's intended 1990 revival (for the fiftieth anniversary of the Blitz) never happened, although the National Youth Theatre did revive it in London's West End at the Playhouse Theatre in September 1990, with Jarrett imported as music director. This production was directed by Edward Wilson and choreographed by David Toguri, with the role of Mrs Blitzstein played by Jessica Stephenson (now Jessica Hynes, an established UK screen actor). According to the review in The Guardian, \\"Edward Wilson's production for the NYT is necessarily more modest and contains some beautiful, slate-grey designs from Brian Lee: his backdrop of a soaring-arched Victorian railway terminus is stunning. David Toguri's musical staging shows his customary flair, camouflaging the cast's vocal weaknesses by bringing out their physical athleticism. And Jessica Stevenson as the mob-capped Mrs Blitzstein admirably conveys truculent working-class defiance.\\"Billington, Michael. \\"Gimme shelter from this blitz - The Playhouse\\", The Guardian (London), September 12, 1990, no page number Benedict Nightingale wrote in his review: \\"But the strongest performance comes from Jessica Stevenson as a Jewish matriarch able to sing a silly song about baking cakes being the answer to all ills, yet remain quietly dignified throughout. Here is an apprentice actress to encourage.\\"Nightingale, Benedict. \\"Oh what an average war!\\", Blitz!, Playhouse, The Times, September 11, 1990, no page number This production became the basis for a touring Northern Stage Company revival starring Diane Langton as Mrs Blitztein.Mandelbaum 2005. A revival production of Blitz was put on at the Queens Theatre in Hornchurch in 2000 including members of the Queens Theatre's own youth groups playing many characters alongside the resident cast. Plot The story focuses on two families, the Jewish Blitzteins and the Cockney Lockes. Mrs Blitztein and Alfie Locke have adjacent stalls on Petticoat Lane: she sells herring, he sells fruit; they do not like each other. Their children, Georgie Locke and Carol Blitztein, are in love with one another. = Act 1 = The action opens on Bank underground station where the residents of Petticoat Lane are sheltering from yet another air raid (\\"Our Hotel\\"). Amongst them are the two prominent families of the street, the Blitzteins, led by their patriarchal mother, and the Lockes, led by father Alfred. The two welcome home their respective sons Georgie Locke and Harry Blitztein who are home on embarkation leave for a week before shipping out to fight in the army. Harry has a new (older) girlfriend in tow, Joyce, who is not only not Jewish but married, much to his mother's horror. Georgie, meanwhile, has caught sight of Mrs Blitztein's daughter Carol, who has grown into a beautiful young woman during his absence and is instantly smitten. Carol likewise is rather struck by the young soldier and they quickly hit it off, before their parents interfere, resulting in their usual round of bickering which never involves them directly speaking to each other but rather through other people (\\"Tell Him, Tell Her\\"). As the argument settles down, Georgie pulls Harry to one side to inform him that he is in love with Carol. Whilst Harry is not against such a relationship, he advises against it as he knows there could be trouble (\\"I Wanna Whisper Something\\"). The wireless is put on so the residents can listen to the news, which includes a speech by Winston Churchill, and a song by Vera Lynn (\\"The Day After Tomorrow\\"). Ernie Nearmiss, Alf's best friend and fellow air raid warden, arrives to inform those in the shelter that the Blackwell's house has been destroyed by a bomb and that Mr and Mrs Blackwell were still inside at the time, having refused to go down to the shelter. Their son Tommy, who is in the shelter with the Blitzteins, is thankfully asleep and doesn't hear, but Mrs Blitztein decides that she will send Tommy with her own son Siddy into the country for safety. Mrs Blitztein then sings Siddy to sleep (\\"Our Hotel Lullaby\\"). The next day, the children of the street, apart from Georgie's sister Franie, are assembled to be evacuated and are waved goodbye by their mothers (\\"We're Going to The Country\\"). No sooner have the children gone than the bombings get worse; the firemen and air raid patrol are kept very busy and every morning the residents of Petticoat Lane emerge from the shelter not knowing what to expect but determined not to let it get them down (\\"Another Morning\\"). On this particular day, they emerge to find the gas mains has been hit and they are not allowed into their homes. Princelet Street has also been completely destroyed leaving several families homeless, including the Murphys and Sens. Alf takes the Murphys in whilst Mrs Blitztein accommodates the Sens. Mrs Blitztein is very frustrated and begins to have a long rant about Hitler, soon joined by the others (\\"Who's This Geezer Hitler?\\"). Harry re-appears after a week's disappearance and he is immediately put to work by his mother as punishment for not telling her where he was. Carol and Georgie manage to get a minute to themselves and it is revealed that they have been spending a lot of time together over the last week. Georgie, prior to leaving for duty the next day, asks Carol if she'll wait for him, but before she can answer their parents appear once again. Mrs Blitztein is in full flow about her children and how they have disappointed herCarol by breaking off her relationship with a Jewish boy because of Georgie, and now Harry for having relations with a married woman (\\"Be What You Wanna Be\\"). An official appears on the scene to conduct a census of all the people in the area who have foreign-sounding names to find out how many there are and how long they've been in the area. Whilst this is going on, Alf and Ernie engage in a patriotic rant (\\"As Long As This Is England\\"). That night, Carol and Georgie sneak out together to spend one last night together before Georgie goes abroad. Their parents look for them but in vain. Carol and Georgie have a laugh at both their parents and their stubborn ways, and reflect on how the fact they are from such different backgrounds actually make them more suited (\\"Opposites\\"). They are interrupted by the air raid siren but, rather than go down to the shelter, they take cover in a doorway (\\"Magic Doorway\\"). Mrs Blitztein, searching for Harry, discovers them and is not less than impressed. Georgie volunteers to pay Joyce a visit and see if Harry is there. Carol meanwhile goes to find Harry herself, leaving Mrs Blitztein alone with her cake tin (\\"Bake a Cake\\"). She then overhears Buddyboy and Bird in the process of stealing lead pipes and is shocked to discover Harry amongst them. Harry announces to his mother he is not going back to the army as he's had enough. Mrs Blitztein is about to go after him when a bomb goes off nearby, followed by a scream from Carol. The next day at Victoria Station, Georgie is waiting for Carol to see him off and for Harry to report for duty. When Harry doesn't show, Elsie, his former girlfriend who is still rather taken with him, tries to buy him time by distracting the Sergeant Major (\\"Leave It To The Ladies\\"). Mrs Blitztein arrives after having been at the hospital with Carol all night and is upset that Harry has not turned up. She informs Georgie that Carol was unable to come and see him off. Georgie informs Mrs Blitztein of his love for Carol and his intention to marry her when he returns, and is surprised when she agrees and seems more gentle towards him than before. The soldiers depart and Mrs Blitztein is left alone. = Act 2 = Act Two opens six months later with Carol (now blind after the bomb blast) alone on Petticoat Lane, thinking of Georgie, who she has not seen at all in that time (\\"Far Away\\"). The Sunday market is slowly beginning to set up and people are discussing Carol and how the bombing seems to have calmed down at last. Alf is pleased as he's had a letter from Georgie to say he's coming home for good after losing a kidney, and, even better, he doesn't want Carol or her mother to know he's coming, which Alf believes means he's going to finish with Carol. The market is soon in full swing (\\"Petticoat Lane\\") and the children return from the country (\\"We've Been To See The Country\\"). The market starts its usual business, with Elsie commenting on the variety of people one meets at the Petticoat Lane market (\\"Down The Lane\\"). Carol, who is helping out on her Mum's pickled herring stall, asks Mrs Blitztein if what Franie has told her about Georgie coming home is true. Mrs Blitztein is forced to admit it is. Carol is confused as to why Georgie did not tell her he was coming home and worries that he has gone off her because she is blind. Mrs Blitztein tries to reassure her daughter but is secretly thinking the same thing. The Military Police arrive to enquire about Harry's whereabouts as he is still on the run from the army. They are followed by Joyce who has not seen Harry herself in a long time. Mrs Blitztein is in despairher daughter is blind and unhappy and her son is a crook on the run. In a moment of desperation, she offers up a prayer to her late husband Jack, pleading for guidance (\\"So Tell Me Jack\\"). That evening, the adults are assembling in the pub, leaving the children outside to amuse themselves with a game of Mums and Dads (\\"Mums and Dads\\"). After the other children are scared off by Tommy Blackwell and his horror book, Georgie emerges from the pub very drunk and depressed. Feeling a failure as a soldier, a son and a boyfriend, he is drowning his sorrows. He is approached by Harry, who reveals that he has spent the last six months working on the black market and hiding from the military but has come back to see Carol having only just heard about what happened in the explosion. Georgie confesses that he too is yet to see Carol and it's clear that whilst he wants to see her, he's too scared to do so. He makes out that Harry had the right idea running away, missing out on the fighting and death. Harry, on the other hand, seems to be fed up with life on the run and is clearly beginning to wish he had just faced his duty. The two agree to meet up later in the evening due to the area where they are being too public. Georgie, now alone, goes into a drunken rant (\\"Who Wants To Settle Down\\"). Mrs Blitztein is next to discover him and she welcomes him home while trying to sound him out about Carol. Georgie admits the army was too much for him as all the killing and violence has altered his view on life and Carol probably wouldn't like the new him. Mrs Blitztein rubbishes the whole thing, telling Georgie that everyone has had to put up with the same thing at home and it hasn't changed any of them. She tells Georgie that she's very proud of him for going to fight for them and facing up to his responsibilities, unlike Harry of whom she is very ashamed. She admits she misjudged Georgie because of her dislike of his father but tells him that she would be proud to have Georgie in her family. Georgie admits he still loves Carol as much as he ever did, if not more, but he doesn't think he's good enough for her. Mrs Blitztein informs him that in Carol's eyes no one else apart from Georgie would be good enough. She goes to fetch Carol, whilst Georgie is reunited with his father and Franie. Carol is brought to Georgie and the two enjoy an emotional reunion, during which Georgie proposes (\\"Is This Gonna Be A Wedding!\\"). Whilst preparations are made, Harry encounters Mrs Smith, who informs him of the impending marriage. Harry then breaks off his agreement with Buddyboy and Bird. At the wedding (\\"Is This Gonna Be a Wedding! (Reprise)\\"), Alf is still not happy about his son marrying a Blitztein but resigns himself to it, although not without a few snide remarks, particularly towards Mrs Blitztein. Georgie and Carol share their first dance (\\"Far Away (Waltz Reprise)\\"). Harry then appears to congratulate Georgie and Carol and announce he is going to fulfil his rightful duty by returning to the army (\\"Duty Calls\\"). The wedding party depart and Mrs Blitztein is left alone when a bomb hits. She is rescued from the rubble by Alf but neither are very gracious either in thanking or receiving that thanks and they leave still arguing, although in a huge step forward they are conversing directly rather than through other people. The crowd once again come together in union (\\"Who's This Geezer Hitler?Reprise\\").Mandelbaum 2005, Musical Heaven. Characters * Mrs Blitzteina typical Jewish matriarch and self-confessed \\"Queen of Petticoat Lane\\". She has spent her entire life trying to bring up her seven children in the proper Jewish way and is very disappointed that they have all in their own way rebelled. Her rival on the street is fruit and vegetable seller Alf Locke with whom she has an explosive relationship: neither can ever resist making snide comments to the other when they get the chance. * Carol BlitzteinMrs Blitztein's youngest daughter. She clearly loves her mother very much but is not willing to let her run her life. She is in a sort of relationship with a Jewish boy early in the show but she breaks it off when she falls in love with Georgie Locke. * Harry Blitzteinthe eldest son of Mrs Blitztein. He, like all his siblings, adores his mum but also finds her a pain and is not above rebellion even to the point of having Georgie Locke as his best friend. Harry is a typical Jack-the-Lad type and a huge hit with ladies, even the married ones. * Alf Lockeowns the fruit and vegetable stall at the market and is Mrs Blitztein's nemesis. A World War I veteran, he is now Chief ARP Warden and, along with his mate Ernie Nearmiss, he takes the job very seriously. He is father to Georgie and Franie who he tries to keep on a tight leash with little success. * Georgie Lockeeldest child and only son of Alf. Georgie is very different from his father, quiet and shy around people especially women. He joined the army at the start of the war and during basic training he made Lance Corporal. * Ernie NearmissAlf's best mate and fellow Warden. He takes the job very seriously and he has a high level of self-importance as result. If he hears about any trouble nearby that requires ARP attention he will head off in a flash to investigate and take charge. * ElsieMrs Blitztein's lodger and Harry's on/off girlfriend.

The species is sometimes known as flowering fern due to the appearance of its fertile fronds. Names The name Osmunda possibly derives from Osmunder, a Saxon name for the god Thor. The name \\"royal fern\\" derives from its being one of the largest and most imposing European ferns. The name has been qualified as \\"old world royal fern\\" in some American literature to distinguish it from the closely related American royal fern, O. spectabilis. However this terminology is not found in British literature. Description Osmunda regalis produces separate fertile and sterile fronds. The sterile fronds are spreading, tall and broad, bipinnate, with 7-9 pairs of pinnae up to long, each pinna with 7-13 pairs of pinnules 2.5-6.5 cm long and 1‚Äì2 cm broad. The fertile fronds are erect and shorter, 20‚Äì50 cm tall, usually with 2-3 pairs of sterile pinnae at the base, and 7-14 pairs of fertile pinnae above bearing the densely clustered sporangia. In many areas, O. regalis has become rare as a result of wetland drainage for agriculture. Evolution Osmunda evolved in the ancient southern continent of Gondwana. A permineralized fossil rhizome of fern was discovered in Early Jurassic (Pliensbachian) lahar deposits at Korsar√∂d in southern Sweden. Authigenic mineral precipitation from hydrothermal brines occurred so rapidly that it preserved cytoplasm, cytosol granules, nuclei, and even chromosomes in various stages of cell division. Morphological studies showed that the plant closely resembles the cinnamon fern, Osmundastrum cinnamomea. The Korsar√∂d fern fossil and extant Osmundaceae share the same relative genome sizes and ploidy levels. This suggests that neither ploidization events nor notable amounts of gene loss have occurred in the genome of the royal ferns since the Early Jurassic ~180 million years ago.: Fossilized Nuclei and Chromosomes Reveal 180 Million Years of Genomic Stasis in Royal Ferns. Science 343(6177). 21 Mar. 2014 Varieties Closeup of sterile frond There are three to four varieties as traditionally construed: *Osmunda regalis var. regalis. Europe, Africa, southwest Asia. Sterile fronds to 160 cm tall. *Osmunda regalis var. panigrahiana R.D.Dixit. Southern Asia (India). *Osmunda regalis var. brasiliensis (Hook. & Grev.) Pic. Serm. Tropical regions of Central and South America; treated as a synonym of var. spectabilis by some authors. *Osmunda regalis var. spectabilis (Willdenow) A.Gray. Eastern North America. Sterile fronds to 100 cm tall. Now accepted as a separate species, Osmunda spectabilis. Similar species There are three very similar species, Osmunda spectabilis, Osmunda lancea and Osmunda japonica. Recent genetic analysis (Metzgar et al., 2008) has shown that the New World varieties are in a clade that is sister to the Old World varieties of Osmunda regalis. If this is true, then O. lancea and O. japonica should either be regarded as varieties of O. regalis, or, conversely, O. regalis var. spectabilis should be regarded as a separate species, Osmunda spectabilis Willdenow. The var. brasiliensis would then be Osmunda spectabilis Willdenow var. brasiliensis Hooker & Greville. Cultivation Osmunda regalis is widely cultivated in temperate regions. The species and the cultivar 'Cristata' have both gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Osmunda plants should be planted in highly acidic, moist soil, associating well with other large moisture-loving plants such as Rodgersia and Gunnera. Other uses The roots, along with those of other species of Osmunda, are used for the production of osmunda fibre, used as a growing medium for cultivated orchids and other epiphytic plants. According to Slavic mythology, the sporangia, called \\"Perun's flowers\\", have assorted magical powers, such as giving their holders the ability to defeat demons, fulfill wishes, unlock secrets, and understand the language of trees. However, collecting the sporangia is a difficult and frightening process. In earlier traditions, they must be collected on Kupala night; later, after the arrival of Christianity, the date is changed to Easter eve. Either way, the person wanting to collect Perun's flowers must stand within a circle drawn around the plant and withstand the taunting or threats of demons. Seasoned royal fern is also used in the dish Namul in Korean royal court cuisine. The young shoots of the fern are, along with the similar shoots of many other fern species, known in some places as fiddleheads, and eaten as food, thought to have an asparagus-like taste.

Each summer, Camp Mattatuck runs a Scouts, BSA Resident Camp, Cub Scout Resident Camp, Webelos Resident camp and a Cub Scout Day Camp. Camp Mattatuck also hosts a variety of seasonal events such as fishing derbies, klondike derbies, camporees and a Halloween Haunted Woods. The camp is available year-round for seasonal camping through our cabins, adirondack shelters and tent sites. We are conveniently located off CT Route 8 in Plymouth, CT, just a few miles north of Waterbury, CT, 90 miles northeast of New York City and 130 miles southwest of Boston, MA. It is part of Connecticut Rivers Council and is supported by the Connecticut Rivers Council through Friends of Scouting donations, solicitation of direct assistance, grants and foundations, Unit Popcorn sales, the Council endowment funds and the Camp Mattatuck Volunteers. Mattatuck hosts its own Cub Scout Day Camp in addition to its resident Boy Scout camp, which serve about 400 Cub Scouts and 1,100 Boy Scouts each summer. Seven cabins on the camp grounds allow for winter camping. An extensive Challenge Course and Climbing Program are also available to Scouts, school systems and corporate groups. =June Norcross Webster Scout Reservation= The camp is located in the scenic New England Town of Ashford, Connecticut. Originally opened as Camp Ashford on June 28, 1964, today the reservation occupies of land and a man-made lake named Goss Pond. The camp is located on the farm once owned by Lt. Col. Thomas Knowlton, hero of the Battle of Bunker Hill and a commander in the Continental Army. The reservation has two camps; The Stanley Black & Decker Base Camp and the Cub Country. In 1963, Eastern Connecticut Council sold Camp Quinebaug to purchase property with a lake in Ashford, Connecticut. The camp was named Camp Ashford and was officially opened on June 28, 1964. After two years of operations, the name was changed to June Norcross Webster Scout Reservation after a donation on behalf of June Norcross-Webster, of the Norcross Greeting Card Company. A large land donation was also made by the Brand Trust. The Base Camp (Ashford 1) is the home to the Boy Scout Resident camp while the Cub Country (Ashford 2) is home to Cub Scout Resident Camp, Akela Day Camp & NYLT. The reservation has been operated by three different councils: Eastern Connecticut Council of Norwich, Connecticut 1964-1971, Indian Trails Council of Norwich, Connecticut 1971-1995 and Connecticut Rivers Council of East Hartford, Connecticut since 1995. It is the largest Scout Camp in the State of Connecticut. =Mark Greer Scout Reservation= This camp was located in Bozrah, Connecticut and was established in 1947 by the Middlesex County Council of the Boy Scouts of America. It was the chief summer camp for Boy Scouts from this small council from 1947 until a merger of five councils in 1972. The Long Rivers Council, which resulted from this merger, used this camp as a Boy Scout summer camp up until 1976, when a declining Boy Scout-aged population forced the council to end the summer camp program. By the mid-1960s, the Camp Tadma property also became known as Mark Greer Scout Reservation in honor of a local Scouting patron. There were five campsites available: Pioneer, Mohegan, Kiehtan, Tantaquidgeon and Uncas. The dining hall was also a small operation and could not have fit much more than 120 Scouts. During its last year of camp operations in 1976, the Tadma kitchen was run by Joe Grillo, who would go on to become the famous PGA caddy Joe \\"Gypsy\\" Grillo. The council attempted to make the camp a high adventure base in 1977 and 1978, but demand was not there. It ran a pilot Cub Scout day camp during the summer of 1977. In the 1990s, Tadma's Venture Post number 78 was chosen to represent the year, 1978, that the council decided to make Camp Tadma strictly a Cub Scout resident camp during the summer camp season. In 1979, Long Rivers Council reopened summer camping at Camp Tadma for Webelos. Its program was one of five camps in the nation that was used to create the Cub Scout Camping Program in 1984. With the Long Rivers-Indian Trails Council merger in the 1990s, Camp Tadma retained this summer camp program but closed as a resident camp in 2013. The property was Sold to a local Church in February 2015. =Frederick Sprague Barbour Scout Reservation= The camp is located in Norfolk, Connecticut. It is suitable for wilderness camping. The camp was devastated after an ice storm. However, in November 2010, a campwide project was held to restore the camp. Around 70 Scouts from the Connecticut Rivers Council helped to refurbish the camp, which is now usable again. =Camp Workcoeman= Camp Workcoeman is located on the shore of West Hill Lake in New Hartford, Connecticut. Established in 1924, it is one of the oldest, continuously-operated Scout camps in the country. For over 90 years, thousands of Scouts and Scouters have experienced Scouting at its best at Camp Workcoeman. It is also home to Laurel Music Camp. In 1994, Camp Workcoeman was part of a study conducted by the National Boy Scout Council for exemplary Scout camps in the country. The program includes Swimming and Boating on the West Hill Pond (sail boats, snorkeling, stand-up paddle boards, underwater nature hike, team canoeing, campwide aquatic meet, kayaking and Polar Bear Swim). Older Scouts can use the Shawtown Wilderness Trek. For younger Scouts, the Tenderfoot's Compass Program is offered. This program, based around the patrol method, focuses on teaching basic Scouting skills and includes Swimming Merit Badge. Each week a number of campwide activities are scheduled, including Aquatic Meet, Scoutmaster Shoot-Off, Friday Night Campfire, Saturday Court of Honor and Family Bar-B-Que. Order of the Arrow Tschitani Lodge No. 10 is the Order of the Arrow lodge for the Connecticut Rivers Council. The name translates to \\"stronger one\\" in Lenape. Their totem is of two Americans Indians shooting arrows. The lodge was created with the merger of Sassacus and Eluwak in 1995. Before the merge, a joint meeting between the two lodges was held at Camp Tadma in the spring of 1995. In fall, a joint lodge conclave was held, hosted by Sassacus Lodge, at June Norcross Webster Scout Reservation in Ashford. On September 17, 1995 the membership voted on their by-laws, chose the name Tschitani for the new lodge and a slate of officers were elected. An Official Charter was given to the Tschitani Lodge on January 1, 1996, and the first Lodge Chief was Brian Dabkowski of Middlebury, CT. In the spring of 1996 and again in 2001, Tschitani Lodge hosted the Section NE-1B Conclave at Camp June Norcross Webster Scout Reservation. The theme for the weekend was \\"The Journey Starts from Within.\\" 2003 saw a slight change in the by-laws to allow the election of two lodge vice chiefs and changed election procedures. At the 2005 National Order of the Arrow Conference, Tschitani Lodge received the 2004 and 2006 NOAC Spirit Award and the ceremonial team received Honor Medals. The lodge received the National Quality Lodge award in 1997 and 2002. As the first lodge in the state, it was recipient of the National OA Service Grant in 2005.

The Paperboys blend Celtic folk with bluegrass, Mexican, Eastern European, African, zydeco, soul and country influences. The band has had a variety of members and line-ups since its original formation, with Landa remaining as the sole founding member, although veteran banjoist/bassist Cam Salay often returns as a guest performer. Known for consistently creating pop songs with melodic hooks, their music has been called versatile, with a wide range of influences, melding diverse musical influences more successfully than some other Irish rock bands have previously. The Paperboys first studio album, Late As Usual, was released on their own record labelStompy Discs in 1995. They also created Stomp Productions to produce and market their work themselves. Their first three studio albums have received Juno Award nominations, with 1997's Molinos winning for the Roots and Traditional Album of the Year category. They also won a West Coast Music Award the same year. Their album Postcards won a West Coast Music Award in 2000. After the untimely death of drummer Paul Lawton, The Paperboys helped to finance a scholarship in his name. The band has also appeared in and scored award-winning international films. They are noted for their version of Bob Dylan's \\"All Along the Watchtower\\", which was part of a tribute album for Dylan's 60th birthday. Their most recent release, and seventh album, was 2014's At Peace With One's Ghosts. A staple at folk, roots, and bluegrass festivals in North America and Europe, The Paperboys have extensively toured both continents, performing in England, Germany, Switzerland, Norway, Scotland, Ireland, France, and Austria. Frequently featured on Canadian national television, The Paperboys have said in the past, \\"We get paid for the travel time, but play for free.\\" Formation and roster The Paperboys were originally formed in 1991 by bassist Christopher Jonat and Tom Landa on acoustic guitar and vocals, with Jeremy Hughes on accordion and vocals, Kevin Ball on fiddle, and Dave Plenkovich on drums. This early version of the band was very popular with the Vancouver college crowds, but after creative discrepancies Landa kept the Paperboys name, and all the other remaining band members reformed as The Clumsy Lovers. Tom Landa was born in Mexico to a Canadian mother of Irish ancestry and a Mexican father, and later moved from Mexico City to Vancouver, British Columbia. Initially, Landa discovered Celtic music via the Canadian band Spirit of the West, whose flautist and co-vocalist was Geoffrey Kelly. Kelly would later produce half of The Paperboys' first studio album Late as Usual with Colin Nairne (producer & guitarist for Barney Bentall) and eventually end up joining the band full-time. The original Late As Usual band members included Moritz Behm on fiddle, Neil Burnett on vocals, penny whistle & celtic harp, Glenn Kruger (the Stoaters, Real McKenzies) on drums & vocals, and Cam Salay on banjo and bass.They were later joined for the latter half of this recording by drummer Paul \\"Lolly\\" Lawton, who went on to stay with them for further recordings & touring until his untimely demise in 2005. In 1995, the band was later joined by Shona Le Mott√©e on fiddle, and Shannon Saunders on a variety of instruments (bass, fiddle, banjo), to contribute to the band's live shows. Le Mott√©e left The Paperboys in 1997, after recording the award-winning Molinos, and was replaced by flautist Hanz Araki. In the late 1990s, they were joined for a time by keyboardist Doug Schmidt. In 2010, the band consisted of Landa, Kalissa Hernandez on fiddle, Brad Gillard on banjo and bass, Geoffrey Kelly on flutes, and Sam Esecson on drums, with a three-piece horn section consisting of Kareem Kandi on saxophone, Nick LaRiviere on trombone, and either Miguelito Valdes or Greg Lyons on trumpet. Recording history Tom Landa, lead singer, and Kendel Carson, on fiddle Geoffrey Kelley on flute, and Matt Brain on drums Brad Gillard playing the banjo The Paperboys released a cassette album called \\"January\\" in 1993 as their first commercially available recording, and sold many copies at local shows around their hometown of Vancouver. Those original recordings were never released on CD (except for the track \\"Judy's Wedding\\", which is featured on Tenure), but a few of the songs from January (\\"January\\", \\"Come Tella Me\\") were re-recorded by the new lineup for the Late As Usual CD. The Paperboys released their first CD studio album, Late as Usual, in 1994, on their self-established label Stompy Discs, with an associated production and management company, Stomp Productions. Late as Usual went on to garner a Juno Award nomination for Roots and Traditional Album of the Year. They followed that album with 1997's Molinos, which also was nominated for the Roots and Traditional category at the Juno Awards, this time winning. Additionally, Molinos took away the Best Roots Recording category in the West Coast Music Award of the same year. One review referred to Molinos as \\"bluegrass-tinged pop-rock\\" with an \\"undercurrent of Celtic wildness\\". In 2000, The Paperboys released Postcards, their third studio album, which also was nominated in the same category, for their third straight nomination, but Postcards did not win. In 2000, they won another West Coast Music Award for the Best Roots Recording category for Postcards. They followed next with Tenure in 2002, the double album Dilapidated Beauty in 2003, and The Road to Ellenside in 2006. In a review for Molinos, it was noted that The Paperboys consistently write pop songs with melodic hooks, which other prior Irish-rock inspired bands such as The Pogues and Oysterband, and others were not always successful at. Postcards, which has songs that range musically from bluegrass, zydeco, flamenco, Irish traditional, country, to Celtic-new-age-Native, and with songs that mix some of the themes, was described as a satisfying example of how far the versatile scope of The Paperboys' music extends. The Paperboys' 2006 album, The Road to Ellenside, is named after the English mansion, Ellenside, Lake District near Ireby where the band, together with producer and engineer Mark Tucker, recorded the album. After a performance in the area, a fan invited the band to spend the night in her mansion for dinner. Landa told her that the home would be an amazing place to record a record, to which the fan replied, \\"Why not?\\" One year later, they returned to the Ellenside mansion, living there in Cumbrian countryside full-time while recording their studio album. Additional recording work for The Road to Ellenside was done at the Tragically Hip's studio in Bath, England and in Vancouver. On The Road to Ellenside, The Paperboys covered Sting's song Fragile from his 1987 album ‚Ä¶Nothing Like the Sun. The band had intended to film their music video for the track in Cuba, but because of high insurance costs from American companies due to the United States embargo against Cuba, opted to film in Morelia, Mexico. In 2009, the band released Callithump. This release features the band name \\"Los Paperboys\\" on the front cover, although this is not the official new band name. Live performances and other work Sting's song Fragile Cam Salay plays bass, as Gillard plays the banjo The Paperboys have performed and appeared in the Genie Award nominated film Marine Life, for which Landa also wrote the musical score, and in the Genie Award winning Lunch With Charles, which was the first-ever film co-production between Hong Kong and Canada. The band have also made numerous appearances on Canadian national television. The band has performed and been interviewed on Vicki Gabereau, The Mike Bullard Show, The Jim Byrnes Show, Urban Rush, Worldbeats, and CBC Television's Terminal City. In 2001, the Red House Records label asked The Paperboys to contribute a track to A Nod to Bob, a 60th birthday homage to Bob Dylan. Their rendition of \\"All Along the Watchtower\\" was consistently noted in reviews as one of the highlights of the album. In honor of their former drummer, Paul Lawton, who passed on suddenly in 2005, the band worked on recording ten songs written by him, for a tribute album that would include recorded material by Lawton. Following Lawton's death, a scholarship was created in his name. The Paul Lolly Lawton Scholarship Fund, was established by St. Clair College in Windsor, Ontario, and The Paperboys worked with the Ontario Provincial Government to raise funds for it. The Paperboys routinely sell out shows in some of the most popular and prestigious clubs and festivals throughout Canada, the United States, Mexico and Europe. One of their most notable appearances was being asked to perform at John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington D.C. In Canada, The Paperboys appeared at almost every folk festival across the country, including Edmonton, Vancouver, Winnipeg and Toronto. They have also played festivals across the United States, including New York‚Äôs Falcon Ridge Folk Festival, The Folk Alliance Festival, the New England Folk Festival and Seattle‚Äôs Bumbershoot. The Paperboys have also performed at other music festivals, including Toronto's Harbourfront, the Milwaukee Irish Fest, and Wintergrass. The band has been asked to return almost every year to several festivals across Europe, headlining at the United Kingdom's Warwick and Trowbridge festivals, as well as at festivals in Germany and Denmark. The band has also toured in Switzerland, Norway, Scotland, Ireland, France, and Austria. According to Landa, their European travels are some of their most successful and popular performances, explaining why they travel to Europe so frequently for long musical tours. The Paperboys' live performances have been described as high energy and accessible, and they have a reputation for gaining new fans after a single performance. The loyalty of fans to The Paperboys has been previously described as \\"a growing cult-like following in recent years.\\" Musical style and influences At the Tractor Tavern in Seattle The Washington Post and Billboard have referred to The Paperboys' music as 'reminiscent of early Elton John and Van Morrison', and they have also been compared at times to a \\"laid back country version\\" of The Eagles. While their music is sometimes hard to describe, The Paperboys themselves have described it as \\"Guinness with a tequila chaser while listening to an Americana Jukebox.\\" Other descriptions of The Paperboys have described a fusion of Celtic folk with Bluegrass, Mexican, Eastern European, African, zydeco, soul and country influences. Their songs range from traditional Celtic jigs to modern love songs. Landa has said that one of his own stronger influences in music is the Mexican style of music called Son Jarocho, whose most well-known song is Ritchie Valens's La Bamba. Tom Landa's songwriting has been cited as world-class by Chris Nickerson of the Seattle Weekly. The band has also been noted for recording a number of pop and rock covers ‚Äî including The Beatles' \\"I've Just Seen a Face\\" on Molinos and Sting's \\"Fragile\\" on The Road to Ellenside ‚Äî which incorporate traditional Celtic jigs and reels into the arrangements; \\"Fragile\\", additionally, incorporates lyrics from both the English and Spanish versions of the song. According to Landa, his bandmate Geoffrey Kelley's other band, Spirit of the West, is a major influence on himself and The Paperboys. Landa said, \\"Even when playing with (Geoffrey), and him being in the same room, I will still say they were a very big influence on me. I'd almost dare to say that had it not been my hearing their records, I would never have been into Celtic music to begin with -- so the band may not even exist.\\" Discography Performing the song \\"California\\" from The Road to Ellenside * January (1993) * Late as Usual (1995) * Molinos (1997), Allmusic [ link] * Postcards (2000), Allmusic [ link] * Tenure (2002) * Dilapidated Beauty (2003) * The Road to Ellenside (2006) * Live at Stockfisch Studio LP (2008) * Live at Stockfisch Studio CD (2008) * Callithump (2009) * Live - Across The Water, Across The Land (2012) * At Peace With One's Ghosts (2014) * Score (2016) Awards and nominations * 2001 Juno Awards, Best Roots & Traditional Album - Group, Postcards (nominated) * 2000 West Coast Music Award, Best Roots Recording, Postcards (winner) * 1998 Juno Awards, Best Roots & Traditional Album - Group, Molinos (winner) * 1998 West Coast Music Award, Best Roots Recording, Molinos (winner) * 1996 Juno Awards, Best Roots & Traditional Album - Group, Late As Usual (nominated) References External links * The Paperboys official website * The Paperboys official German website * The Paperboys official YouTube channel * The Paperboys profile on the Country Music Television website Category:Canadian folk rock groups Category:Musical groups from Vancouver Category:Musical groups established in 1991 Category:Celtic fusion groups Category:Juno Award for Roots & Traditional Album of the Year ‚Äì Group winners Category:1991 establishments in British Columbia Category:Canadian Celtic music groups Category:Red House Records artists ","title":"The Paperboys"},{"id":"2590024","text":"Speed the Memorial Best 1335days Dear Friends 2 was the last best album (Part 2) of the Japanese J-pop girlband Speed before their official breakup on March 2000.

Mount Alyeska is part of the Chugach mountain range and the Alyeska Resort is the largest ski area in the state. It includes the mountaintop Mt. Alyeska Roundhouse, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Facilities and terrain The Alyeska Ski Corporation was founded in 1954, and the first chairlift and day lodge were opened in 1959. The Roundhouse ski lodge and ski patrol station at the top of the mountain began construction in 1960. It is an octagonal building. Still standing, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as \\"Mt. Alyeska Roundhouse\\" in 2003, and now houses a museum to local ski history. Currently, Alyeska has five chairlifts, one high-speed tram, and two Magic Carpets. Of the five chairlifts, one is co-owned by Alyeska and the Tanaka Foundation (Chair 5). Chairs 6 and 4 are high-speed detachable quads, while Chairs 7 and 3 are normal quads. Chair 4 was updated to a high speed quad in 2012. A sixth chairlift, Chair 1, was removed from service in the summer of 2017. Chair 4 ends halfway up the mountain. The tram ends three-quarters of the way up the mountain. The interconnected buildings contain the Roundhouse (patrol quarters), and a much newer facility housing the upper tram terminal, a quick-service cafeteria, and the Seven Glaciers 4-star restaurant and bar. At the base of the tram is the modern 300-room Hotel Alyeska. Chair 6 goes to the highest lift served point on the mountain at . Several areas above Chair 6 are occasionally opened, but require hiking to access. Plans to build a new chair lift higher up the mountain have been announced. Mount Alyeska is a fairly challenging mountain, and has a much higher percentage of advanced and expert runs, as compared to most other mountains in North America. It has a small section for the novice, but the rest of the mountain is almost entirely for the intermediate and the advanced skiers.

Two patches of missing tiles are visible towards the forward edge of the sail. Anechoic tiles are rubber or synthetic polymer tiles containing thousands of tiny voids, applied to the outer hulls of military ships and submarines, as well as anechoic chambers. Their function is twofold: *To absorb the sound waves of active sonar, reducing and distorting the return signal, thereby reducing its effective range. *To attenuate the sounds emitted from the vessel, typically its engines, to reduce the range at which it can be detected by passive sonar. Development by Nazi Germany A close-up view of an Alberich tile, which illustrates the holes pattern The technology of anechoic tiles was developed by the Kriegsmarine in the Second World War, codenamed Alberich after the invisible dwarf from Germanic Mythology. The coating was made up of sheets approximately square and thick, with rows of holes in two sizes, and in diameter. It was manufactured by IG Farben from a material known under its trade name of \\"Oppanol\\" (basically PIB, see also synthetic rubber). The material was not homogeneous but contained air cavities; it was these cavities that degraded the reflection of ASDIC.R√∂sler, Eberhard. Geschichte des deutschen U-Bootbaus, Band 2. Bernard & Graefe Verlag. . The coating reduced echoes by 15% in the 10 to 18 kHz range. This frequency range matched the operating range of the early ASDIC active sonar used by the Allies. The ASDIC types 123, 123A, 144 and 145 all operated in the 14 to 22 kHz range. However, this degradation in echo reflection was not uniform at all diving depths due to the voids being compressed by the water pressure.Eberhard Rossler. The U-Boat: The Evolution and Technical History of German Submarines. Cassell. An additional benefit of the coating was it acted as a sound dampener, containing the U-boat's own engine noises. The coating had its first sea trials in 1940, on , a Type IIB. , a Type IX, was the first operational U-boat with this coating. After its first war patrol, it put in at Wilhelmshaven probably sometime in April 1941 where it was given the coating. The coating covered the conning tower and sides of the U-boat, but not to the deck. By 15 May 1941, U-67 was in Kiel performing tests in the Baltic Sea. During July, the coating was removed from all parts of the boat except the conning tower and bow. Further experiments and sound trials were made in the Little Belt but they presumably proved unsatisfactory, as all the coating was subsequently removed. Problems were encountered early-on, when it was found that the adhesive had insufficient strength to bond synthetic rubber with the pressure hull and casing. This resulted in the sheets loosening and creating turbulence in the water, making it easier for the submarine to be detected.Williamson, Gordon. Wolf Pack: The Story of the U-Boat in World War II. Osprey Publishing; First Edition (2005). . Furthermore, the coating was found to have considerably decreased the speed of the boat. It was not until late 1944 that the problems with the adhesive were mostly resolved. The coating required a special adhesive and careful application; it took several thousand hours of glueing and riveting on the U-boat.McCartney, Innes.Lost Patrols: Submarine Wrecks of the English Channel. Periscope Publishing Ltd (2002). . The first U-boat to test the new adhesive was a Type VIIC. With good results with the new adhesive, the Oberkommando der Marine intended that it would be widely used on the new Type XXI and Type XXII U-boats. However, the war ended before it could be put into large scale use. Ultimately only one operational Type XXIII, , was coated with the anechoic tiles. U-boats with the anechoic tiles coating include: , , , , , , , , , , and .Wynn, Kenneth G. U-Boat Operations of the Second World War: Career Histories, U1-U510.

The Japanese I-400 super-submarine also used anechoic tile technology supplied by Germany. Use by the Soviet Union After the war the technology was not used again until the 1970s when the Soviet Union began coating its submarines in rubber tiles. These were initially prone to falling off, but as the technology matured it was apparent that the tiles were having a dramatic effect in reducing the submarines' acoustic signatures. Modern Russian tiles are about 100 mm thick, and apparently reduced the acoustic signature of s by between 10 and 20 decibels, (i.e. 10% to 1% of its original strength). Modern usage The modern materials consist of a number of layers and many different sized voids, each targeted at a specific sound frequency range at different depths. Different materials are sometimes used in different areas of the submarine to better absorb specific frequencies associated with machinery at that location inside the hull. The Royal Navy started using anechoic tiles in 1980, when was fitted with them during its second refit. The United States Navy also started using anechoic tiles in 1980, with being the first boat to receive the \\"special hull treatment\\" (SHT). In recent years, nearly all modern military submarines are designed to use anechoic tiles.

Starring Carmen Maura, Alaska, and Eva Siva, the plot follows the wild adventures of three friends: Pepi, an independent modern woman; Luci, a mousy, masochistic housewife; and Bom, a lesbian punk rock singer. Pepi, Luci, Bom is Almod√≥var's first feature film. It was shot in 16mm and blown up to 35mm for its theatrical release. It became a cult film, emblematic of La Movida Madrile√±a, a period characterized by a sense of cultural and sexual freedom.Edwards, Almod√≥var: Labyrinth of Passion Plot Pepi, a young independent woman living in Madrid, is filling up her Superman sticker album when she receives an unexpected visit from a neighbor policeman who has spotted her marijuana plants whilst spying on her via binoculars from across the street. Pepi tries to buy his silence with an offer of oral sex, but instead the policeman rapes her. This ruins her hopes of selling her virginity for a good amount of money. Thirsty for revenge, Pepi arranges for her friend Bom, a teenage punk singer, and her band, Bomitoni (Bom and Toni and also a pun of Vomitoni-vomitona=big puke), to beat up the policeman. Wearing Madrilenian costumes and singing a zarzuela, Pepi's friends give the man a merciless beating one night. However, the next day Pepi realizes that they had attacked the policeman's innocent twin brother by mistake. Undaunted, Pepi decides on a more complex form of revenge. She befriends the policeman's docile wife, Luci, from Murcia, with the excuse of receiving knitting lessons. Pepi's idea is to corrupt Luci and take her away from the wife-beating policeman. During the first knitting class, Pepi's friend, Bom, arrives at the apartment heading for the restroom in order to pee. This leads to the suggestion that, since Luci feels hot, Bom should stand on a chair and urinate over Luci's face. Bom's aggressive behavior satisfies Luci's masochism and the two women become lovers. Back home, Luci has an argument with her husband in which she complains about what he had done to Pepi. When he threatens to whip and kick her out, with a renewed sense of liberation Luci leaves her husband and her home, moving in with Bom. The three friends, Pepi, Luci and Bom are immersed in Madrid's youth scene, attending parties, clubs, concerts and meeting outrageous characters. In one of the concerts, Bom sings with her band, the Bomitonis, a song called \\"Murciana marrana\\" (i.e. the slut from Murcia). Luci becomes a proud groupie. The highlight of one of the parties is a penis size contest called General Erections, a competition looking for the biggest, most svelte, most inordinate penis. The winner receives the opportunity to do what he wants, how he wants, with whomever he wants. He selects Luci to give him oral sex, which makes her the most envied woman at the party. Eventually Pepi is forced to find work as her father decides to stop her income. She becomes a creative writer for advertising spots designing ads for sweating, menstruating dolls and multipurpose panties that absorb urine and can double as a dildo. Pepi also begins to write a script which will be the story of lesbian lovers Luci and Bom. The chauvinist policeman is desperately looking for his wife. Meanwhile, he takes advantage of naive neighbor Charito, who is in love with Juan, his twin brother. Pretending to be Juan, the policeman slaps, then sexually assaults Charito. Finally, the policeman finds Luci coming out of a disco and kidnaps her from her two friends. He gives Luci a terrible beating that sends her to the hospital, where Pepi and Bom visit her. They quickly realize that they have lost Luci. She has decided to return to the person who mistreats her best ‚Äì her sadistic and tyrannical husband. His brutality is what Luci has always wanted or became accustomed to. Bruised and bandaged in her hospital bed, Luci tells Bom she is returning to him for a life of abuse. Bom is lost without Luci and laments that pop is also out of fashion. Pepi has the solution to both problems. Bom should move in with Pepi as her bodyguard and start singing boleros.

Both were instrumental in having the film made. Maura was already an established actress, having found film success with Fernando Colomo's Tigres de Papel. She became Almod√≥var's reference actress in the first half of his career. Bom is played by Olvido Gara, then a teenage punk singer, who inspired the character she plays. Gara went on to take the artistic name of Alaska. She has enjoyed a successful artistic career as a singer, first in Alaska and Dinarama and later with Fangoria. Many actors that appear in minor roles went on to play more important ones in Almod√≥var's subsequent films:Strauss, Almod√≥var on Almod√≥var Kiti Manver (Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown) plays a hot-tempered, Andalusian rock singer; Julieta Serrano (Dark Habits); Cecilia Roth (All About My Mother); Fabio MacNamara (Labyrinth of Passion), a singer and painter, plays a transvestite Avon lady;Allison, A Spanish Labyrinth Cristina S√°nchez Pascual (Dark Habits) appears as a high-pitch bearded woman frustrated in a marriage to a homosexual, in a parody of Tennessee Williams's Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. Assumpta Serna (Matador) has a non speaking cameo, while Almod√≥var himself appears as the host in the general erection contest. Production Pepi, Luci, Bom is Almod√≥var's first feature film. He had previously made only short films in Super 8, Salome a short in 16mm and a feature-length film in super 8 Folle, folle, f√≥lleme, Tim (1978) (Fuck Me, Fuck Me, Fuck Me, Tim), none of which had a soundtrack. The genesis of Pepi, Luci, Bom was a story written by Almod√≥var called \\"General Erections\\" published in 1978 in the magazine El V√≠bora (The Viper). \\"General Erections\\" was a comic parody of the 1977 general elections in Spain. The idea to take that story and develop it into a film was born out of his collaboration with the theatrical group Los Goliardos.D'Lugo, Pedro Almod√≥var Performing with them in a small role in Dirty Hands by Jean- Paul Sartre, Almod√≥var met Carmen Maura and F√©lix Rotaeta, who encouraged him to make a film out of General Erections. Almod√≥var rewrote the story and changed the title to \\"Pepi, Luci, Bom y otras chicas del mont√≥n\\" (\\"Pepi, Luci, Bom and Other Girls on the Heap\\"). The initial budget was only 500,000 pesetas that Carmen Maura and F√©lix Rotaeta helped to collect. At the time, Almod√≥var was working for Telef√≥nica, Spain's national telephone company, as an administrative employee therefore the shooting took place on weekends with a group of volunteers. Without the backing of a studio, Almod√≥var was forced to make extensive use of location shooting. The real life residence of gay pop artist painters Costus (Juan Carrero and Enrique Naya), who also appear in the film, served as the place where Luci and Bom set up their home.Pavlovi√°e, 100 Years of Spanish Cinema The shooting was chaotic; it began in 1978 and lasted a year and a half. Due to the lack of financial means, it took an entire year to produce a film of only fifty minutes. This was insufficient for commercial distribution length. More money was needed and backing from Pep√≥n Coromina, a Catalan producer, allowed Almod√≥var to add thirty more minutes of film, shot over the following six months of 1980. The film was blown from 16 mm to a 35 mm format to allow its theatrical release. The crew lacked experience and the cameraman cut off some heads, particularly during the general erections contest scene. The long and chaotic shooting created problems in continuity. When filming started Olvido Gara was fifteen and by the time the filming wrapped she was seventeen. The first scene when Pepi goes to answer the door to the policeman was shot in June 1979, she opened it in December 1979 and they sat together in June 1980. Reception The film premiered on 19 September 1980 at the San Sebastian Film Festival in the section devoted to new directors.Smith, Desire Unlimited It later toured the independent circuits and then spent four years on the late night showing of the Alphaville Theater in Madrid. Reviews in Spain were mostly negative, objecting to the film's frivolity and vulgar humor. Pedro Crespo, in the conservative newspaper ABC, described the film a ‚Äúmerely a variation on the age old tradition of vulgar comedy transformed into a contemporary language‚Äù. Diego Gal√°n, in El Pa√≠s, praised the film concluding that ‚ÄúWe are in the presence of an astonishing and up to now, unique work. Almod√≥var has made his first professional full-length film and in so doing has undermined the most respected taboos of our foolish society‚Äù. The Spanish newspaper El Peri√≥dico, described Almod√≥var as \\"a stubbornly passionate defender of substandard movies\\". Pepi, Luci, Bom was released in the United States in 1992, only after Almod√≥var became a famous art house film director. The reaction of American critics to the film was, on the whole, hostile. It was generally rebuked for its thematic and formal inconsistency. Janet Maslin in The New York Times considered the film a ‚Äúrough unfunny comedy notable for its bathroom jokes, humorous rape scene and abysmal home movie cinematography‚Äô. She found ‚Äúits humor of a very adolescent variety‚Ä¶ and plot turns that are better described than seen‚Äù. Critic Rita Kempley from The Washington Post called it an ‚Äúamateurish directorial debut, a smutty sexual sideshow most safely viewed in a full body condom‚Äù. The film cost 6 million pesetas (about ‚Ç¨36,000) and made 43 million pesetas (‚Ç¨260,000) in its initial release in Madrid. With its many kitsch elements, campy style, outrageous humor, and open sexuality, the film became emblematic of a cultural movement of its time, La Movida Madrile√±a. It amassed a cult following and established Almod√≥var as an agent provocateur. Theme The central theme of the film ‚Äì female resilience, independence, and solidarity ‚Äì would be a constant throughout Almod√≥var's career, albeit better depicted in his later and more accomplished films. Like the female characters in Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown, All About My Mother, and Volver, Pepi and Bom are self-sufficient, independent and their friendship is shown as more important than any sexual or love attachment. By contrast, men are either non-existent or presented unsympathetically like the policeman in Pepi, Luci, Bom; Raimunda's abusive husband in Volver or Pepa's unfaithful lover in Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown. Although Bom and Luci form a lesbian couple, their story is ultimately less important than Pepi and Bom's friendship. While the friendship of these two remains strong Bom's and Luci affair ends when the latter returns to a heterosexual life of abuse with her husband. Two scenes put Pepi and Bom's closeness in the foreground. Contrasting Luci's troubled household, Pepi is presented cooking Bom's favorite dish: Bacalao al pil pil. The film aptly closes with the two friends looking ahead to a new life shared together as roommates, helping to support each other. The film also takes on other themes frequent in Almod√≥var's filmography: sexual heterodoxy, drug addiction and a love of pop culture. Genre Among Almod√≥var's films Pepi, Luci, Bom, his first, is the one who takes more explicitly comedy as a genre. All the others (with the possible exception of Los Amantes pasajeros) incorporate elements of melodrama. The characters are shown as comic archetypes. Pepi is the independent witty modern woman. There is the nasty radical policeman. Bom is shown as a perverse rebellious teenager and Luci as the abused housewife. The amateurish presentation of the film and its crude humor also sets the film apart from the rest of Almodovar's filmography. Even in Labyrinth of Passion, Almodovar's subsequent film, comic elements are not presented so bluntly. By then, there was also a huge improvement in plot structure and filmography over his first film. Analysis The comic book origins of the film are evident in its loose structure, provocative vulgarity and the intertitles made by famous Spanish illustrator, Ceesepe, then an unknown member of La Movida Madrile√±a. The film was plagued by financial and technical problems: Almod√≥var claimed humorously that \\"when a film has only one or two, it is considered an imperfect film, while when there is a profusion of technical flaws, it is called style. That's what I said joking around when I was promoting the film, but I believe 'that that was closer to the truth.\\" Stylistically the film owes a debt to Paul Morrissey's first films and above all to John Waters' Pink Flamingos. Almod√≥var confronts the spectator with unexpected outrageous situations, including a lesbian golden shower scene in the middle of a knitting lesson. The technical and plot defects of the films are apparent, particularly when compared with Almod√≥var's subsequent polished and complex works. However the film captured the spirit of its time, La Movida Madrile√±a, presenting Madrid as an exciting city where anything goes. The film centers on youth culture, showing it as wild, frivolous, adventurous and free from taboos. There is political symbolism in the right wing, old macho attitudes of the policeman, who represent the disappearing Francoist society and is presented unsympathetically.Smith, Desire Unlimited, p. 10 Pepi and Bom stand for Spain's modern woman, the wild new face of a liberated democratic Spain. Luci is the self-sacrificing Spanish housewife, trapped between the old and new Spain. She is a masochist who yearns for the brutality of the past. Blurring the limits of sexual identity, transsexual characters appear in many Almod√≥var's films. Here there is a drag queen called Roxy, played by Fabio McNamara, Almod√≥var's singing partner in a glam rock parody duo. The comic elements of the film defy good taste and are bluntly presented. Alm√≥dovar does not linger in the oddness of the sexual relationship between a traditional housewife in her forties and a rebellious punk teenager, which is presented without judgment as nothing out of the ordinary. Pepi, Luci, Bom is clearly an amateurish film; a first-time director, Almod√≥var learned his craft as he made it. Soundtrack The film opens with the song \\"Do the Swim\\" by Little Nell, singing co-star of Jim Sharman's cult 1975 film The Rocky Horror Picture Show. The counterculture song \\"Murciana marrana\\", written by Fabio McNamara, is prominently featured, performed by Alaska and Los Pegamoides with a mixture of vulgarity and absurdity. The film closes with a Latin-American song \\"Estaba escrito\\" by Monna Bell, a Chilean singer. DVD release Pepi, Luci, Bom is available in Region 2 DVD in Spanish with English subtitles. It was released in the UK as part of The Almod√≥var Collection (Vol.1). The film has not been released on DVD in the United States. Notes Bibliography * Allinson, Mark.

It was founded in 1999 in the second stage of the privatisation of Deutsche Bahn, under the name of DB Reise&Touristik; and was renamed in 2003.  Products  DB Fernverkehr provides national and throughout-Europe long-distance transport services. Train types operated by DB Fernverkehr are: * Intercity Express (ICE) * Intercity (Deutsche Bahn) (IC) * EuroCity (EC) ‚Üí mostly in cooperation with SBB, √ñBB and ƒåD * EuroCity-Express (ECE) ‚Üí on the Frankfurt‚ÄìMilano route in cooperation with SBB and Trenitalia The company operates around 1,300 trains per day (as of 2010). Under the brand name IC Bus also some long-distance bus lines are operated in Europe, starting from the cities of Berlin, Mannheim, Munich, Leipzig, D√ºsseldorf, Frankfurt and Hamburg.  Subsidiaries  = Alleo = TGV POS 4406 and an ICE 3M at Paris-Est station. Alleo GmbH, founded in 2012, is a joint subsidiary of Deutsche Bahn and the French state railway SNCF. The company is responsible for the marketing of the international ICE and TGV trains, which operate on the routes Frankfurt - Paris and Frankfurt - Marseille. In addition, the German-French train and service teams are coordinated by Alleo and trained for use on board international connections. \\"Alleo\\" is led by Frank Hoffmann (DB) and Emmanuel Mroz (SNCF). = DB AutoZug = In 1999, the subsidiary DB AutoZug GmbH, based in Dortmund, was founded for the operation of car and night trains. With October 1st, 2013 DB AutoZug GmbH was merged with DB Fernverkehr AG. = Ameropa = The tour operator Ameropa Reisen, founded in 1951, has been a wholly owned subsidiary since DB Fernverkehr AG was founded. Above all, it distributes short trips and city trips within Germany, as well as to neighboring countries.  Brands  = IC Bus = Berlin-S√ºdkreuz Since 2013, DB Fernverkehr AG operates long-distance coach lines under the brand name IC Bus. There are now a total of 45 of these long-distance connections through 11 European countries (as of 2017). According to ex-CEO Ulrich Homburg, the IC bus offer is not primarily about price competition with other competitors, such as FlixBus, but a supplement to the railway's existing intercity network. Thus, according to Homburg, prices should not be primarily geared to those of competitors. DB Fernverkehr plans to gradually expand the network of the IC bus and generate new connections. = DB Bordgastronomie = In most trains of DB Fernverkehr exists a gastronomic offer in form of a \\"BordRestaurant\\" or \\"BordBistro\\". These system gatronomies are coordinated by the organizational unit DB Bordgastronomie. DB Fernverkehr also trains its own specialists in system catering, who can later prepare and serve meals on board the trains as a steward (-ess).  Organization & Economic Situation  DB Fernverkehr AG is a wholly owned subsidiary of Deutsche Bahn, but, in contrast to its sister company DB Regio, operates in a self-sufficient manner. Birgit Bohle, 2018 The executive board of DB Fernverkehr is made up of Michael Peterson (CEO & marketing), Philipp Nagl (production board member), Heinz Siegmund (CHRO) and Joachim M√ºller (CFO). = Key figures = According to the annual report 2017, the company achieved a profit (net income) of 366 million euros. Compared to the previous year 2016 (136 million euros), the profit increased by 230 million euros (139%). 94 percent of the revenue generated DB Fernverkehr with revenue from passenger transport. The traffic volume (in passenger-kilometers) increased continuously since 2014 (36.1 billion pkm) and in 2017 was around 40.5 billion pkm. = Competitor = Hamburg Altona station In long-distance rail passenger transport in Germany, there are some private providers. These include BTE (partly marketed as Flixtrain), the Georg Transport Organization, Leo Express Germany (marketed as Flixtrain), RDC Germany, the Thalys and Train4you (as \\"UrlaubsExpress - UEX\\"). By the end of September 2012, the Vogtlandbahn with the Vogtland Express (Plauen (Vogtland) -Zwickau-Chemnitz-Riesa-Berlin) had a long-distance transport offer. The connection was converted meanwhile on bus traffic. Until December 2014, there was also the Interconnex, which, however, now also no longer wrong. From the end of 2016, there was also the \\"Locomore\\" on the route between Stuttgart and Berlin funded by crowdfunding, which, however, had to file for bankruptcy in the spring of 2017. In November 2017, however, the operation was resumed with the help of the two companies Leo Express (operation) and Flixmobility (marketing). Since then, the train has been operating under the brand name \\"Flixtrain\\" again from Stuttgart to Berlin and back. Also marketed by Flixmobility, but operated in cooperation with Bahntouristikexpress (BTE), is the former Hamburg-Cologne Express (HKX). According to Flixtrain managing director Andr√© Schw√§mmlein, the company wants to expand its offer in cooperation with its partners and establish itself as an alternative to the ICE of Deutsche Bahn.  History  Frankfurt Airport long-distance station The company emerged as DB Reise & Touristik AG on January 1, 1999 in the context of the second stage of the railway reform from the division of long- distance transport of Deutsche Bahn. It traded under this name until 2003. Instead of the expected five, only 2.2 million passengers used the long- distance trains in traffic to the Expo 2000. Instead of the expected DM 400 million, only DM 125 million was generated. 2001, it was decided to externally adapt all long-distance passenger coaches to the color of the ICE trains (light gray with red stripes). The repainting had cost according to an insider report around 300 million DM. In mid-January 2001, the company announced plans to create a standard of comfort and quality at the ICE level with investments amounting to DM 2 billion. Among other things, 28 additional ICE Ts (around 800 million DM) and 13 more ICE 3s (around 500 million DM) were procured and the modernization of 117 locomotive-bound IC kits (500 million DM) was promised. From 2009 to 2012, the company reduced its seating capacity by 4 percent. In mid-2012, the average load factor of the trains was 48.1 percent, three percentage points higher than in the previous year. In the first half of 2012, the number of passengers increased year-on-year by more than 5 percent to 63.3 million. In 2012, the company carried 131.3 million travelers, generating 37,357 billion passenger-kilometers of traffic at 145.1 million train-kilometers. The utilization of the trains was 50.3 percent. In mid-2013, the company claimed 75 percent of its energy needs from renewable energy sources. During the 2013 flood, many routes, including the high-speed line between Hanover and Berlin, were not or only partially accessible for weeks. The company suffered heavy losses and also lost significantly in its punctuality statistics. With a half-million travelers in one day, the company recorded a new passenger record on December 23, 2016. Between January and April 2017, a new record was set with around 45 million travelers. The year 2018 was expected with 143 million passengers and a record profit of 400 million euros expected. The occupancy rate is 55 percent (as of 2017). In the spring of 2018 failed an operating attempt begun in 2017, in which train drivers were instructed to drive as fast as possible. The driving style, which led in part to arrivals ahead of schedule, had no positive impact on punctuality.  Outlook and developments  Long-distance trains and regional trains in the park According to its own data from March 2015, an operating capacity of about 162 million train kilometers is to be provided in the year 2030, of which 120 million with ICE. The number of passengers is expected to increase from 130 to 180 million, the traffic from 36 to 49 billion passenger kilometers. This should be the largest long-distance network in daily scheduled since 1996. The average age is expected to fall from 23 to 15 years. Twelve billion euros are to be invested in new and revised trains by 2030 and 1,500 new employees will be offered jobs. The company is aiming for a 15-minute travel chain punctuality of \\"well over 90%\\" to become \\"the most reliable means of travel on the medium and long haul\\". By 2030, with more than 50 million additional passengers, most travelers of all market participants will be added. The self-imposed target of a company five-minute punctuality rate of 80 percent for 2016 was narrowly missed. In total, about 79 percent of all ICE and IC arrived punctually in 2016 - the highest number since 2012. However, at the end of 2018, the DB became the focus of public attention due to significantly poorer punctuality rates (including only about 70.4% in November 2018) in long-distance service and shortcomings in the maintenance of trains. As a result, several voices were loud, which called for a renewed German rail reform and a merger of the divisions of passenger transport, DB Regio and DB Fernverkehr. Whether and in what form these demands will be fulfilled, probably decides at the earliest in the spring of 2019. Then CEO of Deutsche Bahn, Richard Lutz, to the Supervisory Board to submit a so-called \\"agenda for a better rail\\" (Original: \\"Agenda f√ºr eine bessere Bahn\\").

Through dialogue, three philosophers named Demea, Philo, and Cleanthes debate the nature of God's existence. Whether or not these names reference specific philosophers, ancient or otherwise, remains a topic of scholarly dispute. While all three agree that a god exists, they differ sharply in opinion on God's nature or attributes and how, or if, humankind can come to knowledge of a deity. In the Dialogues, Hume's characters debate a number of arguments for the existence of God, and arguments whose proponents believe through which we may come to know the nature of God. Such topics debated include the argument from design‚Äîfor which Hume uses a house‚Äîand whether there is more suffering or good in the world (argument from evil). Hume started writing the Dialogues in 1750 but did not complete them until 1776, shortly before his death. They are based partly on Cicero's De Natura Deorum. The Dialogues were published posthumously in 1779, originally with neither the author's nor the publisher's name. via Google Books In The Blind Watchmaker (1986), evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins discussed his choice to title his book after theologian William Paley's famous statement of the teleological argument, the watchmaker analogy, and noted that Hume's critique of the argument from design as an explanation of design in nature was the initial criticism that would ultimately be answered by Charles Darwin in On the Origin of Species (1859). In the second part of the Dialogues (1779), the character Philo observes that animal reproduction appears to be more responsible for the intricacies and order of organic bodies rather than intelligent design. Characters *Pamphilus is a youth present during the dialogues. In a letter, he reconstructs the conversation of Demea, Philo, and Cleanthes in detail for his friend Hermippus. He serves as the narrator throughout the piece. At the end of the Dialogues he believes that Cleanthes offered the strongest arguments. However, this could be out of loyalty to his teacher, as this does not seem to reflect Hume's own views on the topic. When other pieces on religion by Hume are taken into consideration, it may be noted that they all end with (apparently) ironic statements reaffirming the truth of Christian religious views. While the irony may be less readily evident in the Dialogues, this would suggest a similar reading of this work's ending.See Bernd Gr√§frath's \\"Vernunftige Gelassenheit\\" in G. Gabriel, C. Schildknecht, Literarische Formen der Philosophie. Metzler, 1990. Cicero used a similar technique in his Dialogues. *Cleanthes is an \\"experimental theist\\"--\\"an exponent of orthodox empiricism\\"Anthony C. Thiselton, \\"A Concise Encyclopedia of the Philosophy of Religion\\"--who bases his beliefs about God's existence and nature upon a version of the teleological argument, which uses evidence of design in the universe to argue for God's existence and resemblance to the human mind. * Philo, according to the predominant view among scholars, is the character who presents views most similar to those of Hume.William Crouch, Philo, along with Demea, attacks Cleanthes' views on anthropomorphism and teleology; while not going as far as to deny the existence of God, Philo asserts that human reason is wholly inadequate to make any assumptions about the divine, whether through a priori reasoning or observation of nature. * Demea \\"defends the Cosmological argument and philosophical theism...\\" He believes that the existence of God should be proven through a priori reasoning and that our beliefs about the nature of God should be based upon revelation and fideism. Demea rejects Cleanthes' \\"natural religion\\" for being too anthropomorphic. Demea objects to the abandonment of the a priori arguments by Philo and Cleanthes (both of whom are empiricists) and perceives Philo to be \\"accepting an extreme form of skepticism.\\" References  External links  * * Category:1779 books Category:Books by David Hume Category:Books critical of religion Category:Arguments for the existence of God Category:Arguments against the existence of God Category:Criticism of intelligent design Category:Philosophy of religion literature Concerning Natural Religion ","title":"Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion"},{"id":"2590084","text":"A map of British India, 1909, showing the prevailing majority religions of the population for different districts The two-nation theory ( do qaumƒ´ nazariye) is the basis of the creation of Pakistan. According to this theory Muslims and Hindus are two separate nations by definition; Muslims have their own customs, religion, and tradition, and from social and moral points of view, Muslims are different from Hindus; and therefore, Muslims should be able to have their own separate homeland in which Islam is the dominant religion, being segregated from Hindus. The two-nation theory advocated by the All India Muslim League is the founding principle of the Pakistan Movement (i.e. the ideology of Pakistan as a Muslim nation-state in the northwestern and eastern regions of India) through the partition of India in 1947. The ideology that religion is the determining factor in defining the nationality of Indian Muslims was undertaken by Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who termed it as the awakening of Muslims for the creation of Pakistan. Quoting Jinnah: \\"Islam and Hinduism are not religions in the strict sense of the word, but in fact different and distinct social orders, and it is only a dream that the Hindus and Muslims can ever evolve a common nationality.... To yoke together two such nations under a single state ... must lead to a growing discontent and final destruction of any fabric that may be so built up for the government of such a state.\\" It is also a source of inspiration to several Hindu nationalist organisations, with causes as varied as the redefinition of Indian Muslims as non-Indian foreigners and second-class citizens in India, the expulsion of all Muslims from India, establishment of a legally Hindu state in India, prohibition of conversions to Islam, and the promotion of conversions or reconversions of Indian Muslims to Hinduism. There are varying interpretations of the two- nation theory, based on whether the two postulated nationalities can coexist in one territory or not, with radically different implications. One interpretation argued for the secession of the Muslims-majority areas of colonial India and saw differences between Hindus and Muslims as irreconcilable; this interpretation nevertheless promised a democratic state where Muslims and non-Muslims would be treated equally. A different interpretation holds that a transfer of populations (i.e. the total removal of Hindus from Muslim-majority areas and the total removal of Muslims from Hindu- majority areas) is a desirable step towards a complete separation of two incompatible nations that \\"cannot coexist in a harmonious relationship\\". Opposition to the two-nation theory came from both nationalist Muslims and Hindus, being based on two concepts. The first is the concept of a single Indian nation, of which Hindus and Muslims are two intertwined communities. The second source of opposition is the concept that while Indians are not one nation, neither are the Muslims or Hindus of India, and it is instead the relatively homogeneous provincial units of the Indian subcontinent which are true nations and deserving of sovereignty; this view has been presented by the Baloch, Sindhi, Bengali, and Pashtun sub-nationalities of Pakistan, with Bengalis seceding from Pakistan after the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971 and other separatist movements in Pakistan are currently in-place. The state of India officially rejected the two-nation theory and chose to be a secular state, enshrining the concepts of religious pluralism and composite nationalism in its constitution; however, in response to the separatist tendencies of the All India Muslim League, many Hindu nationalist organisations worked to try to give Hinduism a privileged position within the country. History In general, the British-run government and British commentators made \\"it a point of speaking of Indians as the people of India and avoid speaking of an Indian nation.\\" This was cited as a key reason for British control of the country: since Indians were not a nation, they were not capable of national self-government. While some Indian leaders insisted that Indians were one nation, others agreed that Indians were not yet a nation but there was \\"no reason why in the course of time they should not grow into a nation.\\" Scholars note that a national consciousness has always been present in \\"India\\", or more broadly the Indian subcontinent, even if it was not articulated in modern terms.: \\"Obviously the inhabitants of the subcontinent were considered by the Puranic authors as forming a nation, at least geographically and culturally. There were feelings among at least a section of the public that the whole of the subcontinent (or by and large the major part of it) was inhabited by a people or a group of peoples sharing a link-culture or some common features of an \\"umbrella\\" culture in so deep a manner that the could be called by a common name‚ÄîBhƒÅrati. So geographically and culturally, if not politically and ethnically, the BhƒÅratis were a nation.\\" Historians such as Shashi Tharoor maintain that Britain's divide-and-rule policy aimed at dividing Hindus and Muslims after they united together to fight the British in the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Similar debates on national identity existed within India at the linguistic, provincial and religious levels. While some argued that Indian Muslims were one nation, others argued they were not. Some, such as Liaquat Ali Khan (later Prime Minister of Pakistan) argued that Indian Muslims were not yet a nation, but could be forged into one. According to the Pakistan's government official chronology, Muhammad bin Qasim is often referred to as the first Pakistani. While Prakash K. Singh attributes the arrival of Muhammad bin Qasim as the first step towards the creation of Pakistan. Muhammad Ali Jinnah considered the Pakistan movement to have started when the first Muslim put a foot in the Gateway of Islam. Roots of Islamic separatism in Colonial India (17th century‚Äì1940s)  In colonial India, many Muslims saw themselves as Indian nationals along with Indians of other faiths. These Muslims regarded India as their permanent home, having lived there for centuries, and believed India to be a multireligious entity with a legacy of a joint history and coexistence. The congressman Mian Fayyazuddin stated: Others, however, started to argue that Muslims were their own nation. It is generally believed in Pakistan that the movement for Muslim self-awakening and identity was started by Ahmad Sirhindi (1564‚Äì1624), who fought against emperor Akbar's religious syncretist Din-i Ilahi movement and is thus considered \\"for contemporary official Pakistani historians\\" to be the founder of the Two- nation theory,Arthur Buehler, \\"Ahmad Sirhindƒ´: Nationalist Hero, Good Sufi, or Bad Sufi?\\" in Clinton Bennett, Charles M. Ramsey (ed.), South Asian Sufis: Devotion, Deviation, and Destiny, A&C; Black (2012), p. 143 and was particularly intensified under the Muslim reformer Shah Waliullah (1703-1762) who, because he wanted to give back to Muslims their self-consciousness during the decline of the Mughal empire and the rise of the non-Muslim powers like the Marathas, Jats and Sikhs, launched a mass-movement of the religious education which made \\"them conscious of their distinct nationhood which in turn culminated in the form of Two Nation Theory and ultimately the creation of Pakistan.\\"M. Ikram Chaghatai (ed.),Shah Waliullah (1703 - 1762): His Religious and Political Thought, Sang-e-Meel Publications (2005), p. 275 Akbar Ahmed also considers Haji Shariatullah (1781‚Äì1840) and Syed Ahmad Barelvi (1786‚Äì1831) to be the forerunners of the Pakistan movement, because of their purist and militant reformist movements targeting the Muslim masses, saying that \\"reformers like Waliullah, Barelvi and Shariatullah were not demanding a Pakistan in the modern sense of nationhood. They were, however, instrumental in creating an awareness of the crisis looming for the Muslims and the need to create their own political organization. What Sir Sayyed did was to provide a modern idiom in which to express the quest for Islamic identity.\\"Akbar Ahmed, Jinnah, Pakistan and Islamic Identity: The search for Saladin, Routledge (2005), p. 121 Thus, many Pakistanis describe modernist and reformist scholar Syed Ahmad Khan (1817‚Äì1898) as the architect of the two-nation theory. For instance, Sir Syed, in a January 1883 speech in Patna, talked of two different nations, even if his own approach was conciliatory: However, the formation of the Indian National Congress was seen politically threatening and he dispensed with composite Indian nationalism. In an 1887 speech, he said: In 1888, in a critical assessment of the Indian National Congress, which promoted composite nationalism among all the castes and creeds of colonial India, he also considered Muslims to be a separate nationality among many others: In 1925, during the Aligarh session of the All-India Muslim League, which he chaired, Justice Abdur Rahim (1867‚Äì1952) was one of the first to openly articulate on how Muslims and Hindu constitute two nations, and while it would become common rhetoric, later on, the historian S. M. Ikram says that it \\"created quite a sensation in the twenties\\": More substantially and influentially than Justice Rahim, or the historiography of British administrators, the poet-philosopher Muhammad Iqbal (1877‚Äì1938) provided the philosophical exposition and Barrister Muhammad Ali Jinnah (1871‚Äì1948) translated it into the political reality of a nation-state. Allama Iqbal's presidential address to the Muslim League on 29 December 1930 is seen by some as the first exposition of the two-nation theory in support of what would ultimately become Pakistan. The All-India Muslim League, in attempting to represent Indian Muslims, felt that the Muslims of the subcontinent were a distinct and separate nation from the Hindus. At first they demanded separate electorates, but when they opined that Muslims would not be safe in a Hindu-dominated India, they began to demand a separate state. The League demanded self-determination for Muslim-majority areas in the form of a sovereign state promising minorities equal rights and safeguards in these Muslim majority areas. Many scholars argue that the creation of Pakistan through the partition of India was orchestrated by an elite class of Muslims in colonial India, not the common man. A large number of Islamic political parties, religious schools, and organizations opposed the partition of India and advocated a composite nationalism of all the people of the country in opposition to British rule (especially the All India Azad Muslim Conference). On the other hand, Ian Copland, in his book discussing the end of the British rule in the Indian subcontinent, precises that it was not an √©lite-driven movement alone, who are said to have birthed separatism \\"as a defence against the threats posed to their social position by the introduction of representative government and competitive recruitment to the public service\\", but that the Muslim masses participated into it massively because of the religious polarization which had been created by Hindu revivalism towards the last quarter of the 19th century, especially with the openly anti-Islamic Arya Samaj and the whole cow protection movement, and \\"the fact that some of the loudest spokesmen for the Hindu cause and some of the biggest donors to the Arya Samaj and the cow protection movement came from the Hindu merchant and money lending communities, the principal agents of lower-class Muslim economic dependency, reinforced this sense of insecurity\\", and, because of Muslim resistance, \\"each year brought new riots\\" so that \\"by the end of the century, Hindu-Muslim relations had become so soured by this deadly roundabout of blood-letting, grief and revenge that it would have taken a mighty concerted effort by the leaders of the two communities to repair the breach.\\"Ian Copland, India 1885-1947: The Unmaking of an Empire, Pearson Education (2001), pp. 57-58 The changing Indian political scenario in the second half of the 18th century.  Aspects of the theory  The theory asserted that India was not a nation. It also asserted that Hindus and Muslims of the Indian subcontinent were each a nation, despite great variations in language, culture and ethnicity within each of those groups. To counter critics who said that a community of radically varying ethnicities and languages who were territorially intertwined with other communities could not be a nation, the theory said that the concept of nation in the East was different from that in the West. In the East, religion was \\"a complete social order which affects all the activities in life\\" and \\"where the allegiance of people is divided on the basis of religion, the idea of territorial nationalism has never succeeded.\\" It asserted that \\"a Muslim of one country has far more sympathies with a Muslim living in another country than with a non-Muslim living in the same country.\\" Therefore, \\"the conception of Indian Muslims as a nation may not be ethnically correct, but socially it is correct.\\" Muhammad Iqbal had also championed the notion of pan-Islamic nationhood (see: Ummah) and strongly condemned the concept of a territory-based nation as anti-Islamic: \\"In tƒÅzah xudƒÅ'≈ç‚Åø mƒì‚Åø, ba·πôƒÅ sab sƒì; wa·π≠an hai: J≈ç pairahan is kƒÅ hai; woh ma·∫ïhab kƒÅ, kafan hai... (Of all these new [false] gods, the biggest; is the motherland (wa·π≠an): Its garment; is [actually] the death-shroud, of religion...)\\" He had stated the dissolution of ethnic nationalities into a unified Muslim society (or millat) as the ultimate goal: \\"ButƒÅn-e ra‚Åø≈ãg ≈ç-x≈´‚Åø k≈ç t≈ç·πô kar millat mƒì‚Åø gum h≈ç jƒÅ; Nah T≈´rƒÅnƒ´ rahƒì bƒÅqƒ´, nah ƒ™rƒÅnƒ´, nah Afƒ°ƒÅnƒ´ (Destroy the idols of color and blood ties, and merge into the Muslim society; Let no Turanians remain, neither Iranians, nor Afghans)\\". = Pakistan, or The Partition of India (1945) = In his 1945 book Pakistan, or The Partition of India, Indian statesman and Buddhist Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar wrote a sub-chapter titled \\"If Muslims truly and deeply desire Pakistan, their choice ought to be accepted\\". He asserted that, if the Muslims were bent on the creation of Pakistan, the demand should be conceded in the interest of the safety of India. He asks whether Muslims in the army could be trusted to defend India in the event of Muslims invading India or in the case of a Muslim rebellion. \\"[W]hom would the Indian Muslims in the army side with?\\" he questioned. According to him, the assumption that Hindus and Muslims could live under one state if they were distinct nations was but \\"an empty sermon, a mad project, to which no sane man would agree\\". In direct relation to the two-nation theory, he notably says in the book: =Explanations by Muslim leaders advocating separatism= Muhammad Iqbal Muhammad Iqbal's statement explaining the attitude of Muslim delegates to the London round-table conference issued in December 1933 was a rejoinder to Jawaharlal Nehru's statement. Nehru had said that the attitude of the Muslim delegation was based on \\"reactionarism\\". Iqbal concluded his rejoinder with: In Muhammad Ali Jinnah's All India Muslim League presidential address delivered in Lahore, on March 22, 1940, he explained: In 1944, Jinnah said: In an interview with the British journalist Beverley Nichols, he said in 1943: In May 1947, he took an entirely different approach when he told Mountbatten, who was in charge of British India's transition to independence: Mountbatten replied: =Support of Ahmadis and some Barelvis= Third Caliph of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Jama'at Mirza Nasir Ahmad conversing with Furqan Force colonel Sahibzada Mubarak Ahmad, The Ahmadiyya Muslim Jama'at staunchly supported Jinnah and his two-nation theory. Chaudary Zafarullah Khan, an Ahmadi leader, drafted the Lahore Resolution that separatist leaders interpreted as calling for the creation of Pakistan. Chaudary Zafarullah Khan was asked by Jinnah to represent the Muslim League to the Radcliffe Commission, which was charged with drawing the line between an independent India and newly created Pakistan. Ahmadis argued to try to ensure that the city of Qadian, India would fall into the newly created state of Pakistan, though they were unsuccessful in doing so Upon the creation of Pakistan, many Ahmadis held prominent posts in government positions; in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947‚Äì1948, in which Pakistan tried to capture the state of Jammu and Kashmir, the Ahmadiyya Muslim Jama'at created the Furqan Force to fight Indian troops. Some Barelvi scholars supported Muslim League and Pakistan's demand, arguing that befriending 'unbelievers' was forbidden in Islam. Other Barelvi scholars strongly opposed the partition of India and the League's demand to be seen as the only representative of Indian Muslims. =Savarkar's ideas on \\"two nations\\"= According to Ambedkar, Savarkar's idea of \\"two nations\\" did not translate into two separate countries. B. R. Ambedkar summarised Savarkar's position thus: But Ambedkar also expressed his surprise at the agreement between Savarkar and Jinnah on describing Hindus and Muslims as two nations. He noticed that both were different in implementation: \\"Strange as it may appear, Mr. Savarkar and Mr. Jinnah, instead of being opposed to each other on the one nation versus two nations issue, are in complete agreement about it. Both agree, not only agree but insist, that there are two nations in India ‚Äîone the Muslim nation and the other the Hindu nation. They differ only as regards the terms and conditions on which the two nations should live. Mr. Jinnah says India should be cut up into two, Pakistan and Hindustan, the Muslim nation to occupy Pakistan and the Hindu nation to occupy Hindustan. Mr. Savarkar, on the other hand, insists that, although there are two nations in India, India shall not be divided into two parts, one for Muslims and the other for the Hindus; that the two nations shall dwell in one country and shall live under the mantle of one single constitution; that the constitution shall be such that the Hindu nation will be enabled to occupy a predominant position that is due to it and the Muslim nation made to live in the position of subordinate co-operation with the Hindu nation.\\" Opposition to the partition of India Indian National Congress leaders Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan and Mohandas Gandhi both championed Hindu‚ÄìMuslim unity and opposed the partition of colonial India. =All India Azad Muslim Conference= The All India Azad Muslim Conference, which represented nationalist Muslims, gathered in Delhi in April 1940 to voice its support for an independent and united India. The British, however, sidelined this nationalist Muslim organization and came to see Jinnah, who advocated separatism, as the sole representative of Indian Muslims. =Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan and the Khudai Khidmatgar= Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, also known as the \\"Frontier Gandhi\\" or \\"Sarhadi Gandhi\\", was not convinced by the two-nation theory and wanted a single united India as a home for both Hindus and Muslims. He was from the North West Frontier Province of British India, now in present-day Pakistan. He believed that the partition would be harmful to the Muslims of the Indian subcontinent. After partition, following a majority of the NWFP voters going for Pakistan in a controversial referendum, Ghaffar Khan resigned himself to their choice and took an oath of allegiance to the new country on February 23, 1948, during a session of the Constituent Assembly, and his second son, Wali Khan, \\"played by the rules of the political system\\" as well.Christophe Jaffrelot, The Pakistan Paradox: Instability and Resilience, Oxford University Press (2015), p. 153 =Mahatma Gandhi's view= Mahatma Gandhi was against the division of India on the basis of religion. He once wrote: =Maulana Sayyid Abul Kalam Azad's view= Maulana Sayyid Abul Kalam Azad was a member of the Indian National Congress and was known as a champion of Hindu-Muslim unity. He argued that Muslims were native to India and had made India their home. Cultural treasures of undivided India such as the Red Fort of Delhi to the Taj Mahal of Agra to the Badshahi Mosque of Lahore reflected a Indo-Islamic cultural legacy in the whole country, which would remain inaccessible to Muslims if they were divided through a partition of India. He opposed the partition of India for as long as he lived. = View of the Deobandi Ulema = The two-nation theory and the partition of India were vehemently opposed by the vast majority of Deobandi Islamic religious scholars, being represented by the Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind that supported both the All India Azad Muslim Conference and Indian National Congress. The principal of Darul Uloom Deoband, Maulana Hussain Ahmad Madni, not only opposed the two-nation theory but sought to redefine the Indian Muslim nationhood. He advocated composite Indian nationalism, believing that nations in modern times were formed on the basis of land, culture, and history. He and other leading Deobandi ulama endorsed territorial nationalism, stating that Islam permitted it. Despite opposition from most Deobandi scholars, Ashraf Ali Thanvi and Mufti Muhammad Shafi instead tried to justify the two-nation theory and concept of Pakistan. Post-partition debate Since the partition, the theory has been subjected to animated debates and different interpretations on several grounds. Mr. Niaz Murtaza, a Pakistani scholar with a doctoral degree from the Berkeley-based University of California, wrote in his Dawn column (April 11, 2017): Many common Muslims criticized the two- nation theory as favouring only the elite class of Muslims, but causing the deaths of over one innocent million people. In his memoirs entitled Pathway to Pakistan (1961), Chaudhry Khaliquzzaman, a prominent leader of the Pakistan movement and the first president of the Pakistan Muslim League, has written: \\"The two-nation theory, which we had used in the fight for Pakistan, had created not only bad blood against the Muslims of the minority provinces but also an ideological wedge, between them and the Hindus of India.\\". He further wrote: \\"He (Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy) doubted the utility of the two-nation theory, which to my mind also had never paid any dividends to us, but after the partition, it proved positively injurious to the Muslims of India, and on a long-view basis for Muslims everywhere.\\" According to Khaliquzzaman, on August 1, 1947, Jinnah invited the Muslim League members of India's constituent assembly to a farewell meeting at his Delhi house. To Indian nationalists, the British intentionally divided India in order to keep the nation weak. In his August 11, 1947 speech, Jinnah had spoken of composite Pakistani nationalism, effectively negating the faith-based nationalism that he had advocated in his speech of March 22, 1940. In his August 11 speech, he said that non-Muslims would be equal citizens of Pakistan and that there would be no discrimination against them. \\"You may belong to any religion or caste or creed that has nothing to do with the business of the state.\\" On the other hand, far from being an ideological point (transition from faith-based to composite nationalism), it was mainly tactical: Dilip Hiro says that \\"extracts of this speech were widely disseminated\\" in order to abort the communal violence in Punjab and the NWFP, where Muslims and Sikhs-Hindus were butchering each other and which greatly disturbed Jinnah on a personal level, but \\"the tactic had little, if any, impact on the horrendous barbarity that was being perpetrated on the plains of Punjab.\\"Dilip Hiro, The Longest August: The Unflinching Rivalry Between India and Pakistan, Hachette UK (2015), p. 101 Another Indian scholar, Venkat Dhulipala, who in his book Creating a New Medina precisely shows that Pakistan was meant to be a new Medina, an Islamic state, and not only a state for Muslims, so it was meant to be ideological from the beginning with no space for composite nationalism, in an interview also says that the speech \\"was made primarily keeping in mind the tremendous violence that was going on\\", that it was \\"directed at protecting Muslims from even greater violence in areas where they were vulnerable\\", \\"it was pragmatism\\", and to vindicate this, the historian goes on to say that \\"after all, a few months later, when asked to open the doors of the Muslim League to all Pakistanis irrespective of their religion or creed, the same Jinnah refused, saying that Pakistan was not ready for it.\\" The theory has faced scepticism because Muslims did not entirely separate from Hindus and about one-third of all Muslims continued to live in post-partition India as Indian citizens alongside a much larger Hindu majority. The subsequent partition of Pakistan itself into the present-day nations of Pakistan and Bangladesh was cited as proof both that Muslims did not constitute one nation and that religion alone was not a defining factor for nationhood.Altaf Hussain, Two Nation Theory , Muttahida Quami Movement, April 2000. = Impact of the creation of Bangladesh in 1971 = Some historians have claimed that the theory was a creation of a few Muslim intellectuals. Altaf Hussain, founder of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement believes that history has proved the two-nation theory wrong.Altaf Hussain, The slogan of two-nation theory was raised to deceive the one hundred million Muslims of the subcontinent, Muttahida Quaumi Movement, 21 June 2000 He contended, \\"The idea of Pakistan was dead at its inception when the majority of Muslims (in Muslim-minority areas of India) chose to stay back after partition, a truism reiterated in the creation of Bangladesh in 1971\\". The Canadian scholar Tarek Fatah termed the two-nation theory \\"absurd\\". In his Dawn column Irfan Husain, a well-known political commentator, observed that it has now become an \\"impossible and exceedingly boring task of defending a defunct theory\\".Irfan Husain, A discourse of the deaf, Dawn, 4 November 2000 However some Pakistanis, including a retired Pakistani brigadier, Shaukat Qadir, believe that the theory could only be disproved with the reunification of independent Bangladesh, and Republic of India. According to Sharif al Mujahid, one of the most preeminent experts on Jinnah, the two-nation theory was relevant only in the pre-1947 subcontinental context.Dawn, 25 December 2004 He is of the opinion that the creation of Pakistan rendered it obsolete because the two nations had transformed themselves into Indian and Pakistani nations.The News, 23 March 2011 Muqtada Mansoor, a columnist for Express newspaper, has quoted Farooq Sattar, a prominent leader of the MQM, as saying that his party did not accept the two- nation theory. \\"Even if there was such a theory, it has sunk in the Bay of Bengal.\\"Daily Express, Lahore, March 24, 2011 In 1973, there was a movement against the recognition of Bangladesh in Pakistan. Its main argument was that Bangladesh's recognition would negate the two-nation theory. However, Salman Sayyid says that 1971 is not so much the failure of the two-nation theory and the advent of a united Islamic polity despite ethnic and cultural difference, but more so the defeat of \\"a Westphalian-style nation-state, which insists that linguistic, cultural and ethnic homogeneity is necessary for high 'sociopolitical cohesion'. The break-up of united Pakistan should be seen as another failure of this Westphalian-inspired Kemalist model of nation- building, rather than an illustration of the inability of Muslim political identity to sustain a unified state structure.\\"Salman Sayyid, Recalling the Caliphate: Decolonisation and World Order, C. Hurst & Co. (2014), p. 126 Some Bangladesh academics have rejected the notion that 1971 erased the legitimacy of the two-nation theory as well, like Akhand Akhtar Hossain, who thus notes that, after independence, \\"Bengali ethnicity soon lost influence as a marker of identity for the country's majority population, their Muslim identity regaining prominence and differentiating them from the Hindus of West Bengal\\",Akhand Akhtar Hossain, \\"Islamic Resurgence in Bangladesh's Culture and Politics: Origins, Dynamics and Implications\\" in Journal of Islamic Studies, Volume 23, Issue 2, May 2012, Pages 165‚Äì198 or Taj ul-Islam Hashmi, who says that Islam came back to Bangladeshi politics in August 1975, as the death of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman \\"brought Islam-oriented state ideology by shunning secularism and socialism.\\" He has quoted Basant Chatterjee, an Indian Bengali journalist, as rebuking the idea of the failure of two-nation theory, arguing that, had it happened, Muslim-majority Bangladesh would have joined Hindu- majority West Bengal in India.Taj ul-Islam Hashmi, \\"Islam in Bangladesh politics\\" in Hussin Mutalib and Taj ul-Islam Hashmi (editors), Islam, Muslims and the Modern State: Case Studies of Muslims in Thirteen Countries, Springer (2016), pp. 100-103 J. N. Dixit, a former ambassador of India to Pakistan, thought the same, stating that Bangladeshis \\"wanted to emerge not only as an independent Bengali country but as an independent Bengali Muslim country. In this, they proved the British Viceroy Lord George Curzon (1899-1905) correct. His partition of Bengal in 1905 creating two provinces, one with a Muslim majority and the other with a Hindu majority, seems to have been confirmed by Bangladesh's emergence as a Muslim state. So one should not be carried away by the claim of the two-nation theory having been disproved.\\"J. N. Dixit, India- Pakistan in War and Peace, Routledge (2003), p. 387 Dixit has narrated an anecdote. During Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's visit to Dhaka in July 1974, after Sheikh Mujibur Rahman went to Lahore to attend the Islamic summit in February 1974: \\"As the motorcade moved out, Mujib's car was decorated with garlands of chappals and anti-Awami League slogans were shouted together with slogans such as: \\"Bhutto Zindabad\\", and \\"Bangladesh-Pakistan Friendship Zindabad\\".\\" He opines that Bhutto's aim was \\"to revive the Islamic consciousness in Bangladesh\\" and \\"India might have created Bangladesh, but he would see that India would have to deal with not one, but two Pakistans, one in the west and another in the east.\\"J. N. Dixit, India-Pakistan in War and Peace, Routledge (2003), p. 225 = Ethnic and provincial groups in Pakistan = Several ethnic and provincial leaders in Pakistan also began to use the term \\"nation\\" to describe their provinces and argued that their very existence was threatened by the concept of amalgamation into a Pakistani nation on the basis that Muslims were one nation. It has also been alleged that the idea that Islam is the basis of nationhood embroils Pakistan too deeply in the affairs of other predominantly Muslim states and regions, prevents the emergence of a unique sense of Pakistani nationhood that is independent of reference to India, and encourages the growth of a fundamentalist culture in the country. Also, because partition divided Indian Muslims into three groups (of roughly 190 million people each in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh) instead of forming a single community inside a united India that would have numbered about 470 million people and potentially exercised great influence over the entire subcontinent. So, the two-nation theory is sometimes alleged to have ultimately weakened the position of Muslims on the subcontinent and resulted in large-scale territorial shrinkage or skewing for cultural aspects that became associated with Muslims (e.g., the decline of Urdu language in India). This criticism has received a mixed response in Pakistan. A poll conducted by Gallup Pakistan in 2011 shows that an overwhelming majority of Pakistanis held the view that separation from India was justified in 1947. Pakistani commentators have contended that two nations did not necessarily imply two states, and the fact that Bangladesh did not merge into India after separating from Pakistan supports the two-nation theory. Others have stated that the theory is still valid despite the still-extant Muslim minority in India, and asserted variously that Indian Muslims have been \\"Hinduized\\" (i.e., lost much of their Muslim identity due to assimilation into Hindu culture), or that they are treated as an excluded or alien group by an allegedly Hindu-dominated India. Factors such as lower literacy and education levels among Indian Muslims as compared to Indian Hindus, longstanding cultural differences, and outbreaks of religious violence such as those occurring during the 2002 Gujarat riots in India are cited. = Pan-Islamic identity = The emergence of a sense of identity that is pan-Islamic rather than Pakistani has been defended as consistent with the founding ideology of Pakistan and the concept that \\"Islam itself is a nationality,\\" despite the commonly held notion of \\"nationality, to Muslims, is like idol worship.\\" While some have emphasized that promoting the primacy of a pan-Islamic identity (over all other identities) is essential to maintaining a distinctiveness from India and preventing national \\"collapse\\", others have argued that the two-nation theory has served its purpose in \\"midwifing\\" Pakistan into existence and should now be discarded to allow Pakistan to emerge as a normal nation-state. =Post- partition perspectives in India= The state of India officially rejected the two-nation theory and chose to be a secular state, enshrining the concepts of religious pluralism and composite nationalism in its constitution. Nevertheless, in post-independence India, the two-nation theory helped advance the cause of Hindu nationalist groups seeking to identify a \\"Hindu national culture\\" as the core identity of an Indian. This allows the acknowledgment of the common ethnicity of Hindus and Muslims while requiring that all adopt a Hindu identity to be truly Indian. From the Hindu nationalist perspective, this concedes the ethnic reality that Indian Muslims are \\"flesh of our flesh and blood of our blood\\" but still presses for an officially recognized equation of national and religious identity, i.e., that \\"an Indian is a Hindu.\\" The theory and the very existence of Pakistan has caused Indian far- right extremist groups to allege that Indian Muslims \\"cannot be loyal citizens of India\\" or any other non-Muslim nation, and are \\"always capable and ready to perform traitorous acts\\". Constitutionally, India rejects the two-nation theory and regards Indian Muslims as equal citizens. The official Indian perspective maintains that the partition of India was a result of Britain's divide-and-rule policy that aimed at dividing Hindus and Muslims after they united together to fight the British in the Indian Rebellion of 1857.

(Kimball p 62). The \\"Berainesque\\" style of light arabesques and playful grotesques was an essential element in the style R√©gence that led to the French rocaille and European rococo. Arabesque designs by B√©rain Born in Saint-Mihiel, Meuse, in the Austrian Netherlands, he was the son of a master gunsmith, in whose line of work engraving was a prominent technique. He spent his career in Paris. Long after his death the connoisseur Pierre-Jean Mariette wrote of him, \\"Nothing was done, in whatever genre that it might have been, unless it were in his manner, or where he had given designs for it.\\"\\"On ne faisait rien, en quelque genre que ce f√ªt, sans que ce soit dans sa mani√®re o√π qu'il en e√ªt donn√© les desseins\\". Quoted in Kimball, p 40. Through his engravings and those of his son, his style was highly influential beyond the court and Paris, notably in the Low Countries, Germany and London. His close friendship with Nicodemus Tessin the Younger ensured that Berain's own nuance in the Louis XIV style was transmitted to court circles in Sweden. Transom of the Soleil Royal, Louvre, 1670 Berain was established in Paris by 1663.His earliest known works show him as engraver of twelve plates in the collection Diverses pieces de serrurerie invent√©s par Hughes Brisville et grav√©s par Jean Berain (Paris, 1663), and in 1667 ten plates of designs for the use of gunsmiths. (EB 1911) On 28 December 1674 he was appointed dessinateur de la Chambre et du cabinet du Roi (designer of the king's chamber and office) in the Menus-Plaisirs (a post he retained until his death), in succession to Henri de Gissey, whose pupil he is believed to have been.A contemporary document called Gissey \\"maistre de Berain\\" (Kimball p 40) From 1677 onward he had workrooms and an apartment in the Galeries du Louvre near to those of Andr√© Charles Boulle, for whom he made many designs for furniture. After the death of Charles Le Brun Berain was commissioned to compose and supervise the whole of the exterior decoration of the king's ships. His first designs for royal interiors date from the years 1682‚Äì1684. Philippe d'Orl√©ans, with Louis XV (Mus√©e du ch√¢teau de Versailles) He was inventive and industrious, and, beginning with interiors at the H√¥tel de Mailly (1687‚Äì88) assimilated and adapted Raphaelesque grotesque ornamentFiske Kimball found an inspiration for Berain in the arabesques painted under the direction of Le Brun in the panelling of the Galerie d'Apollon at the Palais du Louvre, c. 1670, some of which were engraved by Berain in 1671‚Äì72, his first work for the Crown (Kimball, p 31 note, p 32, figs 8 and 9) to the taste of the time. He provided arabesque designs for the manufacture of Beauvais tapestry. At Meudon for Louis, le Grand Dauphin, whose favourite designer he remained.Fiske Kimball discusses in detail the Dauphin's Cabinet at Meudon. Berain's decors, beginning in 1699, initiated the R√©gence style that was a precursor of the Rococo. Costume design for Pulcinella (1703) B√©rain also designed for the theatre. By 1674 he had already begun designing costumes for Jean-Baptiste Lully's Op√©ra, including costumes for dancers in the divertissements. For Lully's 1684 opera Amadis, a tale of chivalric romance, B√©rain carried out research into the styles of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, a historical approach to costume design that was unusual for the time. Besides costume designs for Lully's trag√©dies en musique, B√©rain designed the costumes for Lully's ballets Le triomphe de l'amour (1681) and Le temple de la paix (1685).La Gorce 2004. Armide (1686) In 1680 he additionally took over Carlo Vigarani's work as the designer of the Op√©ra's stage machinery and scenery, and until 1707 he was in charge of staging all lyric works produced at the Th√©√¢tre du Palais-Royal in Paris as well as at the royal residences. After Lully's death in 1687, he created designs for the earliest op√©ra-ballets, Pascal Colasse's Les saisons (1695) and Andr√© Campra's L'Europe galante (1697). In his set designs B√©rain continued using highly symmetrical single- point perspective, following in the footsteps of his Italian predecessors Giacomo Torelli and Vigarani, as well as Giovanni Francesco Grimaldi and Giovanni Burnacini. He never employed the per angolo (oblique) perspective designs that were being tried in Italy by designers such as the Galli- Bibienas.La Gorce 2001. In 1692 it was B√©rain who worked with the Royal Family on the occasion of the marriage of Philippe d'Orl√©ans to the kings illegitimate daughter Fran√ßoise-Marie de Bourbon, Mademoiselle de Blois. B√©rain designed their jewelled wedding clothes and their private apartments at the Palais-Royal in the Capital. His numerous designs were for the most part engraved under his own supervision; a collection of them was published in Paris in 1711 by his son-in-law, Jacques Thuret, clockmaker to the king from 1694. There are three books, L'≈íuvre de J. Berain, Ornements invent√©s par J. Berain and ≈íuvres de J. Berain contenant des ornements d'architecture. D√©sir√© Guilmard in Les Ma√Ætres ornemanistes, gives a complete list of his published works. His son and pupil, Jean Berain the Younger (1678‚Äì1726), was born and died in Paris. He exercised the same official functions after his father's death and worked in a very similar taste.

It is a bildungsroman which deals with the themes of art and life. The novel was shortlisted for the 1990 Miles Franklin Award. It has been translated into German, and is a set text on year-twelve syllabuses in several Australian states.\\"About the author\\" in Maestro (2004 edition) It was chosen for the inaugural Australian \\"One Book‚ÄîOne Town\\" project.One Book Rates a Read in Towns from Bowral to Alice Springs In 2003, it appeared as number 22 on the Australian Society of Authors' list of the top-forty Australian books ever published. Plot summary The protagonist, a boy called Paul Crabbe, is taught piano by his teacher (or maestro), Eduard Keller. Paul does not like his teacher at first, but by the end of the novel has grown to appreciate him dearly. Paul learns the limits of his own musical ability through Keller, but he also grows to understand himself and Keller enough to write the novel. Additionally, he has a loving relationship with his sweetheart, Rosie. This book deals with the main idea of contrasts, as well as other themes. Contrasts are shown by Paul's mother and father ‚Äì how they differ; Vienna and Darwin ‚Äì high culture vs. low culture; Paul as an adolescent and Paul as an adult ‚Äì through the continual change in narrator, as Paul changes. Paul slowly comes to realisation that he is now learning from the maestro, and that his talent starts growing day by day. The most influential character, Eduard Keller, lost his family during The Holocaust, despite performing for Adolf Hitler in private concerts in the belief Hitler would spare his Jewish family. For Keller, the grand piano is his sanctity and security, assisting him to deal with the horrors of the world; \\"safe beneath that grand piano,\\" and likewise offering Eduard a method of deconstructing life. As Paul matures, Keller's phrasings, which seemed absurd in adolescence, ossify into a \\"musical bible whose texts I knew by heart\\" but Paul does not relate them to his life until middle-age, leaving him \\"smug, insufferable,\\" throughout his life. Keller originates from Vienna, where he was a renowned musician \\"becoming so visible so that nothing can touch him\\", therefore believing he is exempt from the effects of war. Eventually he lost his wife and son and disappeared from the country, leaving every-one to believe he was dead. Filled with remorse and regret, Keller transforms and evolves to become a completely different man, \\"if we are discussing the same man how different our two versions.\\" Keller understands the frivolities and foolish nature of human society, passed onto Paul in the form of clippings from newspapers, Keller's \\"textbooks.\\" \\"The thousands of stories of human foolishness and greed and cruelty that he had tried to patch together into some kind of understanding of his fellow beings\\" depicts Keller's knowledge. When Paul initially began lessons with Keller, his first impressions were misleading, \\"a boozers incandescent glow\\", \\"I'd seen nothing like him before.\\" As Paul matures, his attitudes towards the Maestro become warmer and they develop an unexpressed bond. \\"I slipped my arm beneath his head and kissed him\\" represent Paul's final realisation of his connection with Keller in death. Throughout his life, Paul took the Maestro for granted, believing his advice was \\"irritating ‚Äì and also contradictory.\\" After Keller's death, Paul realises the opportunities Keller had presented him. \\"Mourning for a great man, yes, but also mourning for myself ‚Äì for times and possibilities that will never come again.\\" Throughout the novella the tone shifts from egotism and selfishness to regret and wisdom depicting Paul's growth. In conclusion, Maestro has the main themes of adolescence and growing up. Paul is educated about life through music and Keller's experiences in Vienna and understanding of human nature contribute to Paul's knowledge of the world. The book tracks Paul as he develops into a responsible, mature man from an obnoxious, egotistical teenager. Adaptations On 27 February 2009 the State Theatre Company of South Australia presented the premiere of a stage adaptation prepared by Goldsworthy's daughter Anna at Her Majesty's Theatre in Adelaide.

It is the third game in the Dragon Buster series, and features platform and hack and slash elements. In the Dragon Valor world, dragons are monsters with immense power; the player's role as a Dragon Valor is to slay them with a magical sword that is passed down through successive generations of the family. In a manner somewhat reminiscent to Phantasy Star III, the game differs from other action platform games of the time in that whom the protagonist marries during the game will influence who will lead the adventure in its next phase. There are two choices in the first chapter, and a possible two choices in the second chapter, hence the game flow has three potential paths and thus three different endings. Gameplay In Dragon Valor, the player's character is placed in a stage, with the intention to get from where they start towards the end of the stage or to defeat specific boss enemies along the way. Ultimately, the player must fight and defeat a dragon at the end of each chapter (a chapter being a series of stages leading towards the dragon) in order to clear the chapter. Along the way, players can collect items to boost their hit points, magic points, attack and defense. Players can also obtain 'tomes' after defeating specific enemies, which grant access to spells. The game's currency is Val, and players can collect this to buy recovery potions (which are used immediately upon purchase), status-improving items, or items that may be sold for Val or traded for other items later on in the game. Furthering this topic, the items that the player usually gets in a trade are status-improving items. As stated above, the protagonist changes after clearing each chapter. There are three possible paths, coinciding with the three magic swords that are found on those paths: Azos, Soul, and Kadum. Players generally control a character for one chapter, though some characters can be played twice. The paths, as stated above, are chosen depending on certain triggers in the first chapter. Fulfilling the trigger in Chapter 1, for example, means that Clovis marries Celia and becomes King of Raxis, and the next player character is their son, Arlen. Not fulfilling the trigger means that Clovis instead marries Carolina, which results in the next player character being Kodel. There is a similar choice trigger as Kodel over whether or not to save Fannah in his chapter. Regardless of the fact that the characters change every chapter, the basic commands remain almost the same, with some slight variations in how they are carried out visually being the only telltale difference. Reception Chet Barber reviewed the PlayStation version of the game for Next Generation, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \\"It may not blow your socks off, but Dragon Valor is a solid title worthy of any gamer's attention.\\" The game received \\"mixed\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.

Born into a family of singers, Scholl was enrolled at the age of seven into the boys choir. Aged 13, he was chosen from 20,000 choristers gathered in Rome from around the world to sing solo at a Mass held on 4 January 1981. Just four years later, Scholl was offered a place at the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis, an institution that normally accepts only post-graduate students, based on the strength and quality of his voice. He has since become an instructor at the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis, succeeding his own teacher, Richard Levitt. Scholl's early operatic roles include his standing in for Ren√© Jacobs in 1993 at the Th√©√¢tre Gr√©vin in Paris, where he caused a sensation. His major roles, such as his debut at Glyndebourne in 1998 as Bertarido in Handel's Rodelinda, a role he reprised at the Metropolitan Opera in 2006, were written for the 18th-century alto castrato Senesino. The bulk of Scholl's recording career has been with Harmonia Mundi and Decca, and his CDs are among Harmonia Mundi's best sellers. He has worked with most contemporary Baroque specialists, including William Christie and Philippe Herreweghe, and is himself a songwriter and composer of ballet and theatre music, with his own professional sound studio in Basel, Switzerland. Biography =Childhood= Scholl was born on 10 November 1967 in Eltville, Germany, and grew up in neighbouring Kiedrich. His entire family were singers, and he was enrolled at the age of seven into the boys choir Kiedricher Chorbuben, first documented in 1333 as \\"a schola of men assisting the priests on all Sundays, singing the Gregorian chant\\". Aged 13, Scholl performed the role of the \\"second boy\\" in Mozart's Die Zauberfl√∂te at the Hessisches Staatstheater Wiesbaden, while his sister Elisabeth sang the first boy. That same year he was one of 20,000 choristers from all over the world gathered in Rome for a festival, and was chosen to sing solo at Mass on 4 January 1981, where he met Pope John Paul II. Along with his fellow choristers of the Kiedricher Chorbuben, Scholl was an extra in the film The Name of the Rose, playing a young monk standing alongside Sean Connery in scenes shot at Eberbach Abbey, near Kiedrich. =Musical education= Scholl was 17 when the extent of his ability was recognised by the voice coach of the Chorbuben from the Darmstadt Music Academy. Scholl then sang for the tenor/countertenor Herbert Klein, who advised him that there were only two places he should study: in London or at the early music conservatoire in Basel, the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis. Since an uncle had introduced Scholl to the voices of Paul Esswood and James Bowman, the leading European countertenors of the day, Scholl chose Bowman as a role model. Scholl sent a demo tape to Ren√© Jacobs to evaluate his talent. This resulted in Jacobs inviting Scholl to visit the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis. Although the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis only offered post-graduate courses, and Scholl had no first degree, he was offered a place on the strength and quality of his voice after singing a Schubert song for the admissions board, which included Ren√© Jacobs. At the Schola, Andreas Scholl's teacher was Richard Levitt, followed by Jacobs in his second year. Violinist Chiara Banchini and soprano Emma Kirkby were major influences, as Scholl began to specialise in the music of the Baroque. Scholl additionally studied with soprano Evelyn Tubb and lutenist Anthony Rooley. In addition to the Diploma of Ancient Music, for which his external examiner was James Bowman, Andreas Scholl garnered prizes from the Council of Europe and the Claude Nicolas Ledoux Foundation, and awards from Switzerland's Association Migros and Ernst G√∂hner Foundation. Andreas Scholl has been teaching interpretation in the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis, succeeding his own teacher, Richard Levitt, and is in much demand for master classes.  Career  = Early performances = In 1988 Scholl performed Bach's Christmas Oratorio in R√ºdesheim. In 1991 he appeared in Bach's St John Passion, conducted by Philippe Herreweghe in Antwerp. In January 1993 Scholl stood in for Ren√© Jacobs at Jacobs' request at the Th√©√¢tre Gr√©vin in Paris, causing a sensation. Scholl's partner that night was the harpsichordist , who became his constant musical counterpart in the following years. A later performance of Bach's St John Passion was broadcast on Good Friday to a radio audience which included William Christie. Shortly thereafter, Christie and Scholl met on a train. The 1994 recording of Handel's Messiah with Les Arts Florissants resulted directly from this meeting. Scholl performed Bach's Mass in B minor in 1995, conducted by Jacobs, and sang works by Purcell on a tour in France. In 1998 Scholl and his sister performed in Bach's St Matthew Passion, with Max Ciolek as the Evangelist and Max van Egmond as the , in St. Martin, Idstein. Scholl performed the title role of Handel's Solomon at The Proms. He gave recitals in Wigmore Hall and at the Brighton Festival. = Opera = Scholl's major operatic roles were written for the 18th-century alto castrato Senesino. They include his debut at Glyndebourne in 1998, performing the part of Bertarido in Handel's Rodelinda opposite Anna Caterina Antonacci in the title role, repeated in 1999 and 2002. Rodelinda was a huge success and Scholl \\"stopped the show\\" according to the Sunday Times. James Bowman, who describes himself as an unqualified admirer, reported that \\"people went into a kind of trance\\" when he sang Dove Sei. The Financial Times said of his Vivi tiranno: \\"such intelligent virtuosity ... time stands still and you feel he is speaking to you.\\" In February 2002, Le Monde called him \\"Le Roi Scholl\\" after his reprise of the role of Bertarido in the Paris production of the Glyndebourne Rodelinda. Scholl performed this role also at the Metropolitan Opera in 2006, opposite Ren√©e Fleming in the title role and Kobie van Rensburg, conducted by Patrick Summers, repeated in 2011. He performed the title role in Handel's Giulio Cesare in a Royal Danish Opera production in 2002 and 2005), reprised in Paris (2007) and Lausanne (2008). In 2008 he performed the role of Arsace in Handel's Partenope for the Royal Danish Opera. In 2010 he sang Giulio Cesare, this time opposite Cecilia Bartoli as Cleopatra, with Les Arts Florissants conducted by Christie. = Concerts = In 1999, Scholl appeared with the Netherlands Bach Society, conducted by Jos van Veldhoven in works of Bach, including his Missa in G (BWV 236). He performed Bach's Christmas Oratorio in Avery Fisher Hall, conducted by Ton Koopman. In 2000 he gave several concerts of Bach's Mass in B minor in Japan, conducted by Masaaki Suzuki. In 2001, Scholl sang in Handel's Saul in Brussels and performed the title role in Handel's Solomon, conducted by Paul McCreesh. He sang Bach's St John Passion in the Thomaskirche, Leipzig. At the Bachfest Leipzig 2003, he sang in the Mass in B minor, which traditionally closes the festival, with Letizia Scherrer, Mark Padmore and Sebastian Noack, choir and orchestra of the Collegium Vocale Gent, conducted by Herreweghe. In 2006 he sang on a tour of Europa Bach's solo cantatas Vergn√ºgte Ruh, beliebte Seelenlust, BWV 170, and Geist und Seele wird verwirret, BWV 35, with the orchestra Accademia Bizantina. In 2007 he performed the title role of Saul again, at Eberbach Abbey with Trine Wilsberg Lund (Merab), Hannah Morrison (Michal), Andreas Karasiak (Jonathan) and the Schiersteiner Kantorei, conducted by Martin Lutz. In the Berliner Philharmonie he sang Handel's Messiah with soloists of the T√∂lzer Knabenchor, the choir of Les Arts Florissants and the Berlin Philharmonic, conducted by Christie. In 2008 Andreas Scholl made his debut with the New York Philharmonic, singing Handel's Messiah in Avery Fisher Hall, conducted by Ton Koopman. Andreas Scholl and members of the Baroque orchestra Accademia Bizantina in a concert of the Rheingau Musik Festival at the church of Hallgarten, 16 July 2011 The singer with Edin Karamazov in 2013 In 2011 Scholl made his debut at the Rheingau Musik Festival in three events, an interview, a trip to three churches with different concert programs, and an opera recital with his sister Elisabeth at Eberbach Abbey. In the Christophoruskirche of Wiesbaden-Schierstein he appeared with his wife Tamar Halperin on harpsichord, in Hallgarten with members of the Accademia Bizantina, in the romanesque Basilika St. Aegidius of Mittelheim with the vocal trio White Raven. The opera recital with the chamber orchestra Accademia Bizantina contained works of Handel and Purcell, such as Handel's Rodelinda, Purcell's King Arthur, closing with the final love duet \\"Caro! Bella!\\" from Giulio Cesare in Egitto. In 2011 he performed the alto part of Handel's Messiah in St. Martin, Idstein, with Katia Plaschka, Ulrich Cordes and Markus Flaig. A review describes his perfect timing in the recitatives, his pronounced declamation, technically perfect interpretation and phrasing of the arias, and his devotion to Handel's music and Jennens's text. The Air \\"He was despised\\" was regarded as the artistic high point of the concert. In 2013 he performed Bach cantatas BWV 82 and BWV 169 with the Kammerorchester Basel. He appeared with the vocal ensemble Profeti della Quinta and lutenist Edin Karamazov. = Collaborations = Andreas Scholl has worked with most contemporary Baroque specialists, including Christophe Coin, Michel Corboz, Paul Dyer, John Eliot Gardiner, Reinhard Goebel, Christopher Hogwood, Robert King, Nicholas McGegan, Roger Norrington, Christophe Rousset, Dominique Veillard and Roland Wilson. He took part in the project of Ton Koopman and the Amsterdam Baroque Orchestra & Choir to record the complete vocal works of Bach. His regular solo partners include cembalist Markus M√§rkl and the virtuoso lutenist Edin Karamazov. He performed as a member of Konrad Jungh√§nel's Cantus C√∂lln, and has collaborated with ensembles such as the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, Musica Antiqua K√∂ln, the Akademie f√ºr Alte Musik Berlin, the Freiburger Barockorchester, the Australian Brandenburg Orchestra and Accademia Bizantina. The composer Marco Rosano has created a new Stabat Mater for Andreas Scholl; he sang the first complete performance of this work on 22 February 2008 at the City Recital Hall, Angel Place, Sydney, accompanied by the Australian Brandenburg Orchestra under Paul Dyer. = Popular music = Scholl has always composed songs, as well as music for ballet and theatre, and has his own professional sound studio in Basel, Switzerland. His song White as Lilies, based on ideas of John Dowland, is on the 1995 CD The Countertenors (with Dominique Visse and Pascal Bertin). It was a hit in Korea when used in a TV commercial and was later released there in an orchestrated version. In December 2003, he gave his first public performance in popular music, an eclectic programme of electronic and orchestral works which included his own compositions. Alongside Scholl was fellow Baroque countertenor, Roland Kunz, who specialises in setting Elizabethan English poems to his own electronic music. The two countertenors duetted in Scholl's and Kunz's songs, backed by Kunz's band ' and the Rundfunk-Sinfonieorchester Saarbr√ºcken under Rick Steng√•rds. In 2013 he collaborated with Idan Raichel in his album Quarter to Six.  Recordings  The bulk of Scholl's recording career has been with Harmonia Mundi and Decca. By 1998 his CDs dominated Harmonia Mundi's hit list at numbers one, three, four, five and ten, and they are still among Harmonia Mundi's best sellers. His discography amounts to more than sixty CDs, all but two being music of the European Baroque or Renaissance. Recordings in which he has collaborated, including all but one of his solo recordings, have won awards. His personal accolades include the Diapason d'Or, multiple Gramophone Awards, 10 de Repertoire, ffff Telerama and Choc du Monde de la Musique, the ECHO award and Prix de l'Union de la Presse Musicale Belge. In an extremely rare departure from its normally austere approach, Fanfare magazine described his recording of Dowland's A Musicall Banquet as \\"perfect\\". The recording of Bach's St John Passion conducted by Philippe Herreweghe on which Andreas Scholl sings was nominated for a Cannes Classical Award in 2003. He was Germany's Kultur Radio Artist of the Year in 1998. He has revealed, to German audiences in particular, some little-known masterworks of German Baroque composers and has thereby made a significant contribution to the modern rediscovery of the Baroque repertoire. His 2001 album of folk songs, Wayfaring Stranger, was a personal project, well received by the CD-buying public but not universally acclaimed by his fellow musicians, some of whom regarded it as an inappropriate departure from his more classical work.  Awards  In 2015 Scholl was the 22nd recipient of the Rheingau Musikpreis.  Personal life  Scholl is married to pianist, harpsichordist and composer Tamar Halperin. They live in a small village in Germany.

Although born in Pleasantville, New York, United States, Geroski studied and spent most of his career in Britain, where he settled permanently in 1975. Career Following the completion of a PhD at University of Warwick he joined the Economics Department at University of Southampton as a lecturer. He quickly established a reputation as an excellent teacher who was generous with his time. Initially he was given the task of teaching mathematics to 1st year students, many of whom had not studied maths at A level. His 'one hour revision lecture' on differentiation for those students at the start of the course was supported by hours of help in his office. He was also well known for teaching partial differentiation with the aid of a borrowed motorcycle helmet. He taught 'Economic Problems of Industry' to second year students. This quickly (in his second year at Southampton) became the most popular optional course run by the department. His good humour, friendliness, willingness to give up his time and sharp mind all contributed to making his courses popular. Many students chose him to supervise their dissertation for the same reasons. In 1991 he became a professor of economics at the London Business School, later becoming Dean of its MBA programme (1995‚Äì98). The elective course Technology and Competition was amongst the courses he taught. He was a governor of the school from 1999-2001. In 1998 he became a member of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, which subsequently was superseded by the Competition Commission. He became deputy chairman in 2001 and was its chairman from May 2004 until his death. His research interests were innovation, technical change and determinants of corporate performance. Geroski's extensive case studies of R&D; and innovation challenged the view that subsidies to R&D; were justified by positive externalities, or \\"spillovers\\". He found that, when the parties involved were properly specified, almost all gains were captured by them.

The dominant form for many places is a grave, or a place associated with persons considered to have special attributes in the past--like Wali Sanga or Royalty. Form The tendency has been for graves to equate to sacred places, but the full range can include (and this list is not exhaustive) * Caves (Goa or Gua) * Trees, or a group of trees (Pohon or Hutan) * Springs * Rock Outcrops * Remains of old buildings/structures * Man made fixed structures - buildings, and ruins * Kraton structures are considered sacred * Places of rest of Javanese saints or legendary characters In some areas in Java, the tell-tale sign that a place has been ascribed sacred or special, is either traces of burnt incense (kemenyan) or flower petals. Terminology Common expressions in Javanese and Indonesian for these places are: *Pundhen short for pepundhen *Tempat Keramat *Tempat Ziarah Other terms that might be used *petilasan - traces - of ancestors. Although there is no necessary set pattern, and each individuals pilgrimage is a very personal one, even if travelling with a group --there can be a roughly three tiered hierarchy of Javanese Sacred Places. =National= The graves of national and regional heroes and significant people--either of distant historic nature (the graves of the Wali Sanga or Islamic Saints of Java), or of more recent dates--national heroes of the last 100 years or so, and leaders and 'special people'. Some examples: * The graves of the Wali, Sunan Kalijaga * The grave of Sultan Agung at Imogiri * The grave of Sukarno in Blitar * National Heroes cemetery in Kalibata, Jakarta *Borobudur * Prambanan =Regional= The graves and sites related to regionally significant figures who might be ethnically or regionally specific, rather than of national significance. * Graves of local officials * Graves of local families related to the Palaces, such as Yogyakarta, Surakarta =Local= The graves relating specifically to an individual--one's parents' graves, or grandparents' graves. Also sites within the localities of one's birth, or the graves of one's parents. Natural sites - such as trees, rock outcrops, and springs carry significant folklore, some of which is collected and published. The Networks Considering the population of Java, and the potential to have a wide variation of the significances and networks of places that might be important to an individual, it is possible to think of Java as having a vast network of places that are situated within a complex array of visitations at the time of Idul Fitri that sees roads blocked by eager pilgrims clogging the transport networks of Java.

He had a sinicised name, Yel√º Yi; some sources suggest that Abaoji's family name, Yel√º, was adopted during his lifetime, though there is no unanimity on this point. Abaoji was born in 872 in Southern Mongolia and had a turbulent childhood. His grandfather was killed in a conflict between tribes, and his father and uncles fled. He was hidden by his grandmother for his safety. He became khagan of the Khitans on 27 February 907, and was subsequently enthroned as emperor of the Khitans in 916, proclaiming his own era name. He died on 6 September 926. He was responsible for the conquest and unification of all of Inner Mongolia, northern China and southern Manchuria. Once the Khitan Empire became the Liao dynasty in 942, he was posthumously considered a Liao emperor. Legends surrounding Abaoji's birth Later generations of Chinese historians record a variety of legends that surrounded the birth of Abaoji. According to the legends, his mother Xiao Yanmujin dreamt that the sun fell from the sky and into her bosom, from which pregnancy followed. When she gave birth, the room was said to have become filled with a mysterious light and extraordinary fragrance. As a newborn, his body was that of a three-year-old, and the legends go on to say that he was walking at the age of three months. He was even recorded as being able to see events before they occurred. Rise to power Statues in Huairen County, Shanxi, China, commemorating Abaoji and Li Keyong's meeting in 907 The location of the Khitans in relation to the other neighbouring tribes is of importance. The Khitans resided on the east slope of the Greater Khingan Mountains. West of the mountains were other nomadic pastoral tribes such as the Shiwei and the Xi, along with the Turkic Uighur tribe. These other tribes had inter-married with the Khitans. Further west were the Tatars, a warlike tribe on the steppes of Mongolia. East and northeast lay the Jurchens all the way to the Amur river. They were a peaceful people that resided in small villages and subsisted by hunting and fishing. Across the Liao River to the east and southeast as far as the Yalu River lay the Balhae people, the majority of whom comprised a settled agricultural society. The Yaolian clan had dominated the leadership of the Khitan tribes since the 750s. They maintained good relations with the Chinese Tang dynasty to the south. However, by the end of the ninth century, leaders of the powerful Yila tribe were expressing dissatisfaction with the Yaolian khans. Abaoji's father had been the elected chieftain of the Yila tribe. As surnames were considered a marker of Chinese culture, they were not used by the Khitan people outside of the Yaolian imperial clan. Abaoji became chieftain of the Yila tribe in 901 and in 903, he was named the Yuyue, commander of all of the Khitan military forces. This had the effect of making him second only to the great khan in the hierarchy of the Khitan nation. He started making a name for himself in 905, when he led 70,000 cavalry into Shanxi to create a brotherhood with Li Keyong. Not only did he offer \\"brotherhood\\" but he pledged support against Zhu Wen. This showed that he was willing to be more aggressive than the Great Khan. In 907, he appeared at the triennial council and demanded to be named the khagan, the Khan of khans. His successes against the Chinese in the north, against whom he had been raiding since 901, led to him receiving the support of seven tribal chiefs and even the acquiescence of the last Yaolian Great Khan. From 907 until 916, Abaoji was beset by constant uprisings and rebellions, mostly instigated by his own family members (cousins and brothers). He eventually won them over by persuading them that they could become more successful as a dynasty. With his walled city showing off the tribe's wealth and power, he appointed all the usurpers to positions of influence which placated them. Abaoji's skilful manipulation of his enemies allowed him to increase his own and his tribe's power. Legacy Abaoji's ongoing success was due to his ability to introduce innovations to Khitan society. Arguably the most important was the introduction of a dual administrative system in which nomadic steppe peoples would be governed by steppe traditions while sedentary populations in conquered Balhae and north China would be governed by a civil bureaucracy based largely on Chinese methods. While this did not receive universal support from tribal leaders due to the erosion of their own powers, this became the model that later steppe peoples would use to govern their diverse empires. Two more important innovations were introduced in 916. He adopted Chinese court formalities in which he declared himself Celestial Emperor in the Chinese-style and adopted an era name, also in the Chinese manner of ruling. The second was to name his son, Yel√º Bei, as his heir apparent, also a first in Khitan society and something that directly contrasted with Khitan notions of rule by merit. This second innovation did not take hold easily as only a few of his successors experienced simple successions. He also organised his followers into warrior units known as orda, and then by joining 12 ordas together, he would form an administrative district. In 918, Abaoji had a new walled city built. A Chinese city was built adjacent to this city in which artisan's shops, commercial shops, and warehouses were constructed. Later, five capital cities would be built, including a Supreme Capital (‰∏ä‰∫¨), that served as the base of Khitan administration. Abaoji ordered the development of a Khitan large script in 920. This script looks superficially like Chinese writing, however, it bears little resemblance to Chinese writing, and the two were mutually unintelligible. Five years later, the arrival of a Uyghur delegation led Abaoji to order his younger brother, Yel√º Diela, to develop a new script on more syllabic principles. Unlike the Japanese and Koreans, the Khitans managed to adopt the cultural and administrative tool of writing without the baggage of Chinese culture and grammar that came with the wholesale adoption of Chinese characters. By the time he died of typhoid fever at the age of 54, Abaoji had captured the entire Balhae state, keeping their ruling family as nobility ruling his new fiefdom. His eastern boundaries were the Yalu River and the Ussuri River. His westward progression had gone far onto the Mongolian Plateau. By the time of his death, he had not acted on his plan to move south. Relationship with the Later Tang Li Cunxu, the son of Li Keyong who had formed a bond with Abaoji back in 905, founded the Later Tang on the ashes of the Later Liang in 923. On Li Cunxu's death, though relations between the two had soured, the proper forms were followed and an emissary was sent to the Khitan capital. The souring of relations occurred probably due to the aggressiveness of Abaoji, as in 922 and 923 he had pressed deep into Hebei, looting and taking prisoners all the way. This was in essence Later Tang territory. =Yao Kun= Yao Kun was sent by the Later Tang court to meet with Abaoji in 926. He caught up with the Khitan ruler in Manchuria while he was on campaign against the Balhae kingdom and while he was encamped at Fuyu in present-day Jilin Province. Abaoji demanded that the Later Tang surrender the Sixteen Prefectures. If they were given up, there would be no reason for Abaoji to invade China. Yao Kun stated that this demand was not in his authority to grant. This response landed him in prison, where he still was when Abaoji died from illness on September 6, 926. Succession Though Yel√º Bei was designated heir apparent in 916, the empress dowager Shul√º Ping did not consider him to be worthy and managed to have her second son Deguang succeed to the throne.

He co- wrote hits including \\"A Lover's Concerto\\", \\"Let's Hang On!\\", \\"Working My Way Back to You\\", and \\"Native New Yorker\\", and was nominated with Linzer for induction into the Songwriters Hall of Fame (SHOF) in 2012. Life and career He was born in New York City and later moved to Silver Spring, Maryland. He played piano and accordion, and performed in various local bands in his teens, as well as starting to write songs. One of his songs came to the attention of New York music publishing company Shapiro Bernstein, who started to employ him as a staff songwriter. This in turn led to his introduction to Bob Gaudio and Bob Crewe, the record producers and writers behind the success of The Four Seasons. Randell began working for the Four Seasons as a writer and arranger in the early 1960s. Gaudio's associate, Al Kasha, introduced Randell to lyricist Sandy Linzer. The duo wrote several Top 10 songs for Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons, including \\"Working My Way Back to You\\" (also a hit for The Spinners in 1979, and in Ireland for Boyzone in 1994), \\"Opus 17 (Don't You Worry 'Bout Me)\\", and, with Bob Crewe, \\"Let's Hang On!\\". Randell and Crewe later co-wrote Valli's solo hit \\"Swearin' To God\\". In 1965, Randell and Linzer wrote and produced most of the songs for the R&B; girl group, The Toys, including their singles \\"A Lover's Concerto\\" (adapted from Minuet in G major, a classical music piece), and \\"Attack!\\" Another Toys recording written by the duo, \\"Can't Get Enough Of You Baby\\", was later covered by the garage band ? and the Mysterians and, in 1998, was a #14 hit when covered by Smash Mouth. They also had a hit with Jay and the Techniques' \\"Keep the Ball Rollin'\\". Linzer and Randell wrote two songs recorded by The Monkees, \\"I'll Be Back Up On My Feet\\" and \\"The Day We Fall in Love\\", and \\"Penny Arcade\\" by The Cyrkle. They later wrote \\"Native New Yorker\\", performed by Odyssey on the soundtrack of the film Eyes of Laura Mars; it was later featured in the film The Nanny Diaries and the final year of HBO‚Äôs Sex and the City. Other co-writes include \\"Breakin' Down The Walls Of Heartache\\", a major UK hit in 1968 for Johnny Johnson and the Bandwagon, and Samantha Sang's 1978 chart hit \\"You Keep Me Dancin'\\". In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Randell worked in A&R; for several companies, including Epic, RCA, and Frank Zappa's DiscReet Records, for whom he produced Tim Buckley's album Sefronia. He also produced the Iron Butterfly album Scorching Beauty. Later in the decade, he co-wrote and arranged the album Get Dancin‚Äô by Disco Tex and the Sex-O-Lettes. In 1980 he co-wrote the Star Wars-themed album Christmas in the Stars, which featured singer John Bongiovi (later Jon Bon Jovi). In 1985, he teamed up with songwriter and singer Biddy Schippers and formed the duo Randell & Schippers, who recorded a number of successful electronic dance tracks including Alice in Wonderland. The pair later married. In recent years they have worked together on the GI Jams project, which aims to develop and spotlight songwriting talents in the U.S. military.

The network's ninety-minute long news program airs at 5pm each evening covering local, national and world news, including sport and weather. Weekend editions are presented nationally from Network 10's studios in Pyrmont, Sydney. Network 10's news division also assists in the production of the current affairs program The Project. It draws upon the resources of ITN, APTN and Reuters for select international coverage outside that of the network, in addition to that of CBS News, which is legally in-house following the 2017 takeover. History Network 10 introduced its news service in 1965 and was a pioneering force behind the concept of the hour-long news bulletin with co-anchors in the form of Eyewitness News from 1973 onwards. The 1980s were the network's most successful period as a news provider with its local Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane bulletins often rating highest for their 6pm timeslots.Katrina Lee, TV's busiest woman The Sydney Morning Herald - 14 January 1985 Network 10's flagship nightly bulletin news services has undergone a number of name changes since inception in 1965 including: ATV News in Melbourne, SASTEN News in Adelaide, NewsWatch in Brisbane, TEN News, TEN Evening News, and Eyewitness News. A major change to the service occurred in January 1992 when all five of its local bulletins were moved to the 5.00pm time slot. In 1994 all local weekend bulletins were axed across the network and replaced by a 30-minute network bulletin from Sydney ‚Äì Ten Weekend News, initially presented by John Gatfield and later by Tracey Spicer, Natarsha Belling and Bill Woods. A localised version of Ten Weekend News was received from Sydney for Perth, while during the AFL season Adelaide and Melbourne viewers received local news on a Saturday, presented from Melbourne by George Donikian. For a short period in 2009, Ten Weekend News also included localised sport inserts for each market. 10 News First has often been described as a 'training ground' for some of Australia's best-known television journalists. Some of the best-known reporters and presenters who launched or spent a major part of their careers at Network 10 include Jana Wendt, Kerry O'Brien, Katrina Lee, Charles Slade, Ann Sanders, Steve Liebmann, Tim Webster, Ron Wilson, Anne Fulwood, Juanita Phillips, Harry Potter, Liz Hayes, Jo Pearson, David Johnson, Bill McDonald, Chris Masters, Larry Emdur, Eddie McGuire, John Gatfield, Kay McGrath, Graeme Goodings, Sharyn Ghidella, Laurie Oakes, Geraldine Doogue, Helen Kapalos, Jennifer Keyte, Deborah Knight, Bruce McAvaney, Nathan Templeton, Mel McLaughlin, Karl Stefanovic, Mark Beretta, Amber Sherlock and George Donikian amongst others. In September 2010, the network announced a major expansion of its news service. From 24 January 2011, It expanded its evening news output by introducing a national current affairs program at 6pm, 6PM with George Negus (later 6.30 with George Negus), and an additional local bulletin at 6:30pm on weeknights, under the Ten Evening News brand. In addition, the network announced the re-introduction of local weekend bulletins at 6pm and the axing of its 5pm national bulletin. Two months after the relaunch, the national weekend bulletins were re-introduced owing to poor ratings, although the 6pm local bulletins continued to air. Later that month, the network dropped its 6:30pm local bulletins on weeknights, extended Ten News at Five to 90 minutes and moved George Negus' program to 6:30pm each weeknight. The changes were introduced on Monday 4 April 2011.Ten reshuffles news shows after ratings slump, Sydney Morning Herald, 24 March 2011 Further changes in September 2011 saw the axing of the network's late night bulletinSandra Sully replaces Deborah Knight and joins Bill Woods in Ten news revamp at 5pm, late news cancelled, The Daily Telegraph, 21 September 2011 and the state-based 6pm weekend bulletins.

In November 2011, the last half-hour of Network 10's 5pm state bulletins were rebranded as Ten News at Six. Two months later, the main 5pm bulletin was shortened back to 60 minutes from Sunday 22 January 2012 with The Project moved to 6pm. The network's Ten Early News bulletin was axed in February 2012 following the launch of Network 10's Breakfast program. More changes during the year saw the return of a networked Ten Late News in a new format launched on 4 June 2012, and the axing of Breakfast on 30 November 2012, due to low ratings and cost-cutting measures at the network. In September 2013, Network 10 reintroduced the Eyewitness News branding for all of its news output, including the flagship 5pm state bulletins.Eyewitness revived as Ten goes for growth, The Australian, 16 September 2013 Two months later, a new breakfast program, Wake Up, was launched. On 21 May 2014, Network 10 announced it would axe Wake Up and all national news bulletins on weekdays as part of a wider cost-cutting program with the loss of around 150 jobs, caused by poor ratings and advertising revenue.Wake Up, early morning and late news editions at Ten axed, news.com.au, 21 May 2014 The network also closed its two international bureaux in Los Angeles and London. As of 2018, the state-based 5pm news continues to air, alongside national bulletins at weekends. In February 2014, Network 10 announced that Hugh Riminton would join Sandra Sully as a co-anchor of the bulletin. In November 2014, Candice Wyatt joined Stephen Quartermain as a co- anchor and finally in August 2015 Lachlan Kennedy joined Georgina Lewis as a co-anchor in Brisbane. On 16 May 2016, Ten Eyewitness News updated their set and graphics. However, the logo remained unchanged. In January 2017, the three east coast metro bulletins (Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane) returned to solo anchors with Hugh Riminton, Candice Wyatt and Lachlan Kennedy returning to reporting duties in February. In November 2018, alongside a major network relaunch, the Ten Eyewitness News branding was replaced with 10 News First. On 2 December 2019, the 5pm edition of 10 News First was extended to 90 minutes.

The lack of a separate up-to- date edition of Ten Eyewitness News Weekend for Perth has led to criticisms when outdated time-sensitive news has been broadcast in Western Australia, as in the case of a local 8-year-old junior drag racing accident victim who had died in hospital several hours prior to Ten airing the three-hour-old national bulletin reporting that she was still alive.Barry, Paul Channel Ten's disservice to the west, Media Watch, Episode 41, ABC Television, Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 20 November 2017.

Production of the Perth bulletin was initially moved to Pyrmont in 2000, citing high costs of converting the network's Dianella studios. Then-presenters Greg Pearce and Christina Morrissy relocated to Sydney to present the bulletin, whilst sport and weather segments were still presented locally from the station's studios in Dianella. Morrissy later resigned from these duties after suffering deep vein thrombosis on a flight and was replaced by Celina Edmonds.

The bulletin was presented from Melbourne for the next decade while sport and weather segments were still presented locally from the station's studios in North Adelaide and subsequently, from 2007, in newly built studios in Hutt Street. Initially, in 2000, George Donikian and Nikki Dwyer relocated from Adelaide to present the new Melbourne based bulletin. Dwyer eventually resigned as presenter in 2001 after she decided to move back to Adelaide, to be closer to her family.

The bulletin also aired on weekends, hosted by Tracey Spicer, until the Saturday and Sunday editions were axed in 2004 and 2005 respectively. In 2006, the bulletin was merged with the late weeknight edition of Sports Tonight on Monday through Thursday nights.

There are a series of tests that she and her classmates must go through to determine who'll be the representatives to go to University Satellite, a satellite training facility. Living under the shadow of her mother, the legendary Cosmic Beauty Tomoe Midou, Akari, emotionally fragile in this version, struggles as the worst athlete at the training school. Eventually, with the help of her best friend Ichan, Akari succeeds in making it to the University Satellite where she competes for the title of Cosmic Beauty and trains for a mission that will decide the fate of the human race. Characters ; : :Born in Hokkaido, Japan on March 23, 4983. She is the daughter of Tomoe Midou, a former Cosmo Beauty.

In the end, Akari went on to enter the University with blessings from Ichino. After her full recovery, she later helps Akari in defeating the Nerillians. :Initially her feelings for Akari are ambiguous until near the end of the series where she confesses her feelings towards her.

However, she is also a perfectionist and overachiever. Because of this, she strongly detested Akari, whom she views as weak and unworthy to be called Tomoe's daughter. The only classmate she felt any sort of respect for was her rival Ayla. She is highly critical of weakness, including her own. She is never seen praising or encouraging others not as good as her, and becomes embittered and even heartbroken when she is surpassed.

Despite already holding the title of Cosmo Beauty, she remains unsatisfied until she can break Tomoe Midou's universal running record. She initially had no respect for the cheerful and friendly Akari because she believed that the only way to succeed and win is to be completely machine-like and devoid of emotion. But after seeing how happy and fulfilled Akari was during their semifinal match, Larrie realized what she had lost, and was defeated by Akari, finally losing her title as Cosmo Beauty. :In the past, Larrie was more friendly and sociable and loved sports. When they first competed with each other, she noticed how unhappy Miranda was and suggested they become rivals and compete with each other, so that Miranda can see how fun sports can be. Sometime afterwards, she focused only on winning and nothing else, and adopted her machine-like drive to succeed. This caused her to break up her friendship with Miranda, and the two became more bitter rivals since. But after the two of them were defeated in the Cosmo Beauty competition, they continued their rivalry with each other, this time, on friendlier terms. ; : :The headmaster of University Satellite. He possesses super strength, and was once a top athlete who brought Earth to victory against the aliens. He is very friendly and encouraging to his students, and supportive of Akari in her goal to become Cosmo Beauty. :In the OVA, he is a pervert who sneaks in to the Women's dorm and bath. Development At first, the creation of the franchise was set for a public radio drama at start of 1996 on \\"Orikasa Ai's Moonlight Cafe\\". When the end of 1996 approached, a video game of the same name was released for the Sega Saturn system. It was followed up by the OAV series (the first video adaptation) and, some months later, by the TV version. Two more games were released eventually (\\"Alternative\\" in 1998, also for the Saturn, and \\"GTO\\" in 1999, for the PlayStation). There was also a comic adaptation, subtitled \\"A.D. 4999\\". Manga A manga adaptation also exists. The story is very different from the anime series which involves Akari being a new candidate in the Antarctica Academy. There she meets her male instructor aa he helps her improve her skills. Akari meets some of the athletes as some become her good friends and some as her sworn rivals. There is a few differences with most of the characters: Akari: In the anime series, she is hardly an athlete who believes she shouldn't be an athlete like her mother Tomoe Midou and believes she should quit. In the manga, she wanted to improve herself to see if she is worthy of being a true athlete like her mom. Ichino: In the anime series, Ichino and Akari have been friends since they were twelve years old and Ichino is helping Akari to keep going of being a worthy athlete. In the manga, Ichino first met Akari when Akari enrolled to the academy and become friends right away. Ichino still acts hot-headed sometimes. Jessie: In the anime series, Jessie acts kind to everyone except to Akari because Akari is the daughter of Tomoe Midou, for Jessie's goal is to become the next Cosmo Beauty Queen and surpass Tomoe Midou. She wants to be the best to everyone including Akari. In the manga, Jessie is a lot more cheerful and is nice to all the athletes which she doesn't see Akari as a rival but a friend. She sees all sports as her favorite hobby to do and have fun. Tarnya: In the anime series, Tarnya has darker skin and acts all funny. She looks like a cat and acts all childish. In the manga, Tarnya is close to resemble her OVA appearance has less childlike personality and likes to do fun stuff. Ling Pha: In the anime series, Ling Pha is a princess of China and has a selfish personality that she would do anyway of becoming the new Cosmo Beauty Queen even if it means by cheating. In the manga, Ling Pha is much kind to her friends, has a ponytail, and doesn't cheat. Her father is a very rich merchant who sells special medicine which Ling Pha gives some of her medicine to her friends to help them out, in which case the medicine backfires of that cause side effects for which Ling Pha doesn't know much about the medicines she gives out. She is close friends with Tarnya. Ayla: In the anime series, Ayla's hair style is a wrap of pigtails and has calm personality. Ayla likes to remain calm and never losses her cool. In the manga, Ayla's hairstyle is a well groom pouf fashion and has a dark personality. She watches on all the athletes to learn of their skills and to know of their weakness as she gathers information (data) on them and take them out. Episodes =Battle Athletes= * 1.

It is the terminus of Drammen Line, Gardermoen Line, Gj√∏vik Line, Hoved Line and √òstfold Line. It serves express, regional and local rail services by four companies. The railway station is operated by Bane NOR while its real estate subsidiary, Bane NOR Eiendom owns the station, and was opened in 1980. Oslo Central was built on the site of the older Oslo East Station (', ), the combining of the former east and west stations being made possible by the opening of the Oslo Tunnel. Oslo Central has nineteen tracks, thirteen of which have connections through the Oslo Tunnel. The station has two buildings, the original Oslo East building and the newer main building for Oslo Central. Each building houses a large shopping centre. The square in front of the station is called Jernbanetorget. History =Two stations= The old ' was converted to a shopping mall, but is still part of the station When the first railway line, Hovedbanen, was built between Oslo and Eidsvoll in 1854,Jacques Garreau, Les chemins de fer en Norv√®ge . the terminus in Oslo was constructed as an ad-hoc solution located at Gamlebyen. Alternate sites included Youngstorget, Gr√ºnerl√∏kka and Vaterland Bridge. In 1852 an architectural competition was held, and a plan based on Crown Street Station in Liverpool won. The station was located east of the river Akerselva, but could not serve as a permanent solution, as it was close to neither the city centre nor the port. In 1859 the freight section of the station was expanded with the purchase of land between Loelva and the port, and part of Bj√∏rvika. From the beginning, rail traffic increased, especially after the expansion of the Trunk Line to Hamar in 1862, and the opening of the Kongsvinger Line in 1865. In 1872 Oslo got its second terminal station, located at Pipervika near Aker Brygge and the city hall. Oslo West Station (or Oslo V) was built to allow the then narrow-gauged Drammen Line between Drammen and Oslo to terminate in downtown Oslo. The two stations were located about 2 km apart and were not connected by rail until 1907 when the Oslo Port Line was built. There had been discussions about building a central station to connect the Drammen Line with the eastern station, but this idea involved building it via Majorstuen and Grefsen. Oslo V always remained a secondary railway station in Oslo, since it mostly served local traffic to Buskerud, Telemark and Vestfold in addition to the S√∏rland Line. =A new East Line Station= The year after the western station opened, in 1873, the Norwegian legislature, the Storting, decided to build a new railway from Kornsj√∏ at the Swedish border through √òstfold to Oslo, the Smaalenene Line (now the √òstfold Line). Traffic at the station was expected to explode due to this railway and it was decided that a new station had to be built. The engineers within NSB (now Vy) wanted to locate this new station west of the river Akerselva, between Jernbanetorget and Bj√∏rvika. But a conflict arose between Carl Abraham Pihl, who was director of NSB at the time, and the City of Oslo. While Pihl wanted a separate station for the Smaalenene Line, the city wanted to concentrate the stations in one place in Oslo. The engineers insisted on moving the station closer to the city. The architect Georg Andreas Bull drafted four plans for a new station with nine tracks over the river Akerselva. In 1878 the legislature decided to build the smallest suggested station‚Äîwith only seven tracks over the river, claiming that the station was oversized. Oslo East Station (', ') opened in 1882. = Committee after committee = But it was soon recognized that the station was too small. The population of Oslo doubled to 150,000 between 1875 and 1890 and from the opening of the station to 1890, the traffic increased from 400,000 passengers annually to more than a million. The most critical part was the freight section, where the trains had to partially use the main railway for switching. One of the proposed solutions was to build the line from √òstfold on a viaduct into the station and elevate it on a level above the other tracks. Another problem arose in 1893, when it had to be decided where the new Gj√∏vik Line was to terminate. Some suggested a station at Grefsen with one line to Oslo East and one via Majorstuen to Oslo West. The Storting decided in 1895 that the Gj√∏vik Line was to be built to Oslo East. To start the expansion of the station, the Storting announced a competition in 1896, which was won by Sam Eyde. His plan was to move the freight section away from the passenger sections to Lodalen. The plan was put to the Storting in 1899, and with 70 against 39 votes, the new station was delayed because of the high projected costs. A committee was appointed to look at other possible solutions. The committee split in its final decision, but both factions agreed that a new railway had to be built between the two stations, and proposed a line past the city hall in a tunnel under Akershus Fortress. But again the plan was weakened by the Storting and the only construction to take place was new extensions of the Smaalenene Line and Gj√∏vik Line and some minor changes to the freight section. The new Oslo Port Line that connected the two stations opened in 1907. Another committee was created in 1938 to work out plans for a central station. This was the first project to propose a tunnel under the entire city that would branch off from the Drammen Line before Oslo West. The committee proposed two plans, one where all traffic was directed to the new central station and one where the suburban traffic went to Oslo West. It also considered construction of a line north of the city via Grefsen to Oslo East, but this was not recommended. The proposed tunnel below the city was to be 1,660 metres long. The plan also included a twelve-story building for NSB's administration at the station, which at the time was spread around at 14 different locations in the city. The committee delivered its report on 7 December 1939 to the Norwegian Ministry of Labour. =Wartime and change of plans= A Flytoget airport express Class 71 train entering Oslo Central from the Oslo Tunnel In 1940 after the German invasion of Norway in World War II the German puppet government in Norway took over control of transport planning and created the T√∏yen Project in 1942. The plan involved dismantling both Oslo V and Oslo √ò and building a new central station at T√∏yen. The idea was to convert all suburban transport to diesel buses while trains were to be responsible for long distance transport. Tram and commuter train services were to be abandoned and the area freed was to be converted to freeways, so it became less important to have the main train stations centrally located in the city. Both the committee and NSB rejected the project. During the war the German forces exploited the railway network and rolling stock, and by the end of the war the entire railway system was worn out. In 1946 the Planning Office for the Central Station was created, led by Egil Sundt. This committee announced an architecture contest for a new central station, and the Green Light plan by John Engh won. The planning office started construction based on the 1938 committee's work, and expanded the Alnabru Railway Yard in parallel with the new station. The office presented plans which would take 15 years to implement. One of the greatest obstacles was the location of the tunnel under the city. NSB wanted a straight line for quick transport, but complex geological conditions in Oslo, including large areas of clay, prevented this. The plans originally included a station at Oslo City Hall, but a more northerly line was chosen that would be 1,802 meters long. Introduced in 1952, shepherding the plans through the Storting proved difficult. In 1959 the plans were again revised and in 1960 a new committee was created, which suggested building a third line between Grefsen and Bestun for freight trains to connect between the eastern and western lines. It also felt that the tunnel should be expanded westward and terminate somewhere between Skarpsno and Sk√∏yen and at the same time close the Oslo Port Line. The new plans were approved by the Storting in 1962. =One station= Class 73 express train The new central station was to have the same basic plans as the suggestion that won the contest in 1946, though slightly modified, among other things keeping the old Oslo √ò building. The station was to have 19 tracks, of which 12 were to connect to the Oslo Tunnel. Construction of the new station started in 1979 and in 1980 the Oslo Tunnel could be taken into use. The tunnel got one of the planned stations, Nationaltheatret, while Elisenberg was never built due to lack of funds. Oslo S was taken into use on Sunday, 1 June 1980 and officially opened by King Olav V on Friday, 30 May 1980. Oslo V was closed in 1989, and is now the seat for the Norwegian Nobel Institute. In 1982, one person was killed when a bomb exploded at the station.

Music The band's sound is characterized by hardcore, usually with shouted verses, interspersed with melodic flourishes. History King Ly Chee was formed in May 1999 fueled by the fire and passion of a form music called 9core. In 1999, the music climate of Hong Kong was an unhealthy world of cover bands passing themselves off as ‚Äúhardcore‚Äù or ‚Äúmetal‚Äù while belting out tunes by Limp Bizkit. The founder of King Ly Chee, Riz, had enough and one day, he decided that it was time that someone set the record straight on what ‚Äúhardcore‚Äù truly implies. He set off on the mammoth task by releasing a bilingual zine called Start From Scratch that included interviews, essays and CD reviews of world-renowned punk, metal and hardcore bands. As the wheels were turning for Start From Scratch, Riz sat back and realized that words were not enough, kids in Hong Kong needed to hear, feel and see ‚Äúhardcore‚Äù in action to fully absorb the impact. King Ly Chee was the result.. This band has tirelessly continued down this mission for over 15 years now through their sheer determination and passion for hardcore, they have taken their sounds, energy and hearts to surrounding Asian countries, and Europe, helping establish the name ‚ÄúKing Ly Chee‚Äù as a truly Asian band. In the past 15 years they have let no obstacle come in their way when it comes to touring. With all members knee-deep in full-time day jobs, they jump at any open opportunity they get to perform outside of Hong Kong. King Ly Chee had opened for the following bands: Sick of it All, Korn, NOFX, Comeback Kid, Terror, Horse the Band, Bane, Have Heart, Envy, Naiad, No Turning Back, Himsa, Rambo, 100 Demons, Reflector, The Bouncing Souls, FC Five, 100 Demons, Die Young TX In January 2012 King Ly Chee released their third studio album \\"Time Will Prove\\". It was 8 years since their second album \\"Stand Strong\\" was released. \\"Time Will Prove\\" is a double CD digipak that includes all English album as well as all Chinese album. The album was recorded at their own studio by guitarist Brian Wong and it was then sent to US for Zack Ohren (All Shall Perish, First Blood) to mix and master. To celebrate their 15th year, King Ly Chee released a new album at the end of August 2014. In September and October 2015, King Ly Chee went on an Asian tour with Sick of it All, one of their biggest influences. Lou Koller of Sick of it All previously added vocals to the track Lost in a World and even performed with King Ly Chee on stage at one of their concerts in Hong Kong.

Dance, choreography and community dance Royston Maldoom's career as a choreographer began in 1972 when he received a major Gulbenkian Foundation award for his work in a Royal Ballet workshop, he had previously been studying dance with Hilde Holger. Since then he has created works for companies in Britain and abroad, including Dance Theatre of Harlem (New York), 'Atlanta Contemporary Dance Company' (Georgia USA), 'Ballet San Marcos' (Peru), 'Northern Ballet Theatre' (Manchester UK), 'EMMA Dance Company' (Leicestershire UK), Scottish Ballet (Glasgow UK) for whom, in collaboration with Graham Bowers, he created 'Ursprung'. In 1975 his small group, 'Mercury Dance Company', won first prize at the 7th International Choreographic Competition at Bagnolet in Paris, and was subsequently awarded the 'Foundation of France' prize for choreographer and company. Maldoom was appointed 'Dance Artist in Residence' jointly by Fife and Tayside Regional Councils in January 1981. The year's residency with financial support from the Scottish Arts Council, was the first of its kind to cover an area rather than a single institution, and through his unique and unconventional approach to dance successfully encouraged participation and interest in dance within communities, with performance workshops and classes, on a scale not seen before. He was responsible with others in forming Dundee Repertory Dance Theatre and in his role as Artistic Director, established a solid, successful and ongoing base for professional contemporary dance in Scotland. He also maintained his commitment to community dance by setting up annual summer projects, where people within the community regardless of age and experience, could participate in a work that culminated in a performance to commissioned music and stage design at a professional venue. One such work was ‚ÄòBivouac‚Äô where Gordon McPherson wrote the musical score and Graham Bowers designed the costumes and stage set. The company was renamed several years later and adopted the name Scottish Dance Theatre, after the closure of Peter Royston's original company of the same name. In a projects with the Berlin Philharmonic in the first season of Simon Rattle as chief conductor, he trained 250 children from public schools Stravinsky's Le Sacre du printemps. It was performed in January 2003, and documented in Rhythm Is It!. He also came to NYC in 2007 and worked with four inner city schools to reproduce the Rite of Spring dance with the Berlin Philharmonic. (Twelve students from PS 161 in West Harlem as well as two Harlem high schools & six students from an elementary school were the dance performers.) Dance United In 1996, Dance United founders Andrew Coggins, Mags Byrne and Royston Maldoom, together with the Ethiopian Gemini Trust, created a unique dance project in Addis Ababa with street children which led to the foundation of the Adugna Community Dance Theatre Company. In 2000, Dance United was officially established. Trained intensively over many years in Addis Ababa by dance artists from all over the world, eighteen young Ethiopian dancers graduated in 2002 with accreditation from Middlesex University (UK). In 2004, Junaid Jemal Sendi won the international Rolex Young Choreographer award, the first ever African artist to win this prestigious accolade. Junaid and fellow Adugna dancer, Addisu Demissie, also played key roles in Dance United's DESTINO at Sadler's Wells in 2009.

The gameplay is that of a standard turn based role playing game with non-random encounters. While intended for an adult audience as well, the game was something of an introduction to RPGs for children. The game did not enjoy commercial success. Plot The player controls a young messenger boy named Knight who is joined by his best friend, a fairy girl named Nehani. While running a routine errand for the mayor, the two stumble upon a small pink monster they later name \\"Baby\\". Soon after meeting the creature, Knight has a vision of a spirit who tells him to deliver Baby to an ancient monument called \\"God's Tower\\" in order to find its mother. After a few minor setbacks (and the discovery of the mysterious Living Toys, magical dolls that come to life and assist you in battle) the group sets off on its journey. Along the way, the group runs into several other colorful groups of characters, each of whom are intent on \\"saving the world\\" in their own radically different way. The first enigmatic Artema Cult, a network of churches who believe their leader Artema to be a messiah. Soon after the group encounters the pair of Darkbeat, a mercenary who fancies himself \\"The Chosen One\\" and has vowed revenge against a man named Karmine, and his sister Ibkee, a kind-hearted dinosaur-like creature who runs an orphanage. The third group of would-be heroes is led by Kalkanor, a pompous royal knight on a journey to collect magic stones in order to imprison a vicious titan called \\"Xizan\\". Though they initially seem unrelated, the paths of these different groups (including your own) gradually become more and more intertwined as the quest goes on, climaxing in the rise of an evil that threatens the entire world. As the future looks more and more bleak, it is up to Knight, Baby, Nehani, and their friends to save the Earth from certain doom. =Synopsis= The young man Knight lives with his fairy friend Nehani in the town of Orgo. The Mayor of Orgo gives Knight a task of taking a letter to the nearby town of San Claria. During his return journey, Knight is gifted the creature named Baby in a blinding flash of light. A mysterious voice tells the boy to take this Baby to the God's Tower, his home. Knight takes the creature to the mayor who tells him to dispose of it in a local cave. Later, Knight has remorse for abandoning the infant, and decides to rescue him and deliver him to God's Tower. After a harrowing escape from monsters in the cave, the trio head out toward God's Tower. They eventually meet a man named Darkbeat, and his sister Ibkee. Ibkee has been cursed by a man named Karmine, and Darkbeat has been seeking him for vengeance. Furthering their adventure with a water-bug named Chester, the group eventually meet a knight named Kalkanor, his sorceress companion Ramal and a mysterious wizard Gwinladin. Kalkanor believes he is on a divine mission to defeat several evil monsters, he and Knight cross paths many times assisting one another. Knight also meets the mysterious Artemia Cult, who revel in manipulating the populace. Eventually the group arrives at God's Tower, where they encounter a man named Karmine. Karmine is revealed to be the leader of the Artemia Cult, and is planning to resurrect the evil god Xizan. Kalkanor arrives, and Gwinladin reveals he has been working for Karmine the whole time. Karmine had manipulated Kalkanor into killing the Divine Beasts to weaken the seal on Xizan. Karmine betrays Gwinladin, and transform him into a dragon before beginning his ascent of the tower. Kalkanor is not strong enough to defeat it, thus it falls to Knight. After the battle, Kalkanor asks Knight to face Karmine and save the world. Knight and Baby begin to climb the tower. Upon arriving at the top, they meet Karmine as well as Darkbeat and Ibkee. Karmine had just finished killing the final beast, Baby's mother. Darkbeat attempts to fight Karmine, but he is too powerful. Karmine faces off against Knight, intent on killing Baby and summoning Xizan. Killing Baby, Karmine receives a crystal and summons Xizan. Knight battles Karmine and wins. Celestia, Baby's mother revives Baby and the God's Tower begins to collapse. Baby has Knight ride him and Baby begins to fly from the Tower. In a flash of light the group is blown off course. Awakening in Picard, the group meet Darkbeat and Ibkee again. They are told of a legendary warrior who will do battle with Xizan. Knight is given the location of several pieces of legendary armor. Upon retrieval, Knight is told that he is the legendary hero, and he faces off against Darwin the ancient legendary hero. Upon his victory Knight is blessed with the legendary armor and the power to defeat Xizan. The group head for the final confrontation. However they are accosted by Karmine once again. However he is distracted by Darkbeat, who successfully seeks his vengeance. Xizan towers over the group, but after a fierce battle, Baby begins to reseal Xizan. However, Xizan uses a powerful attack that severely weakens the group. Nehani confesses her love for Knight before sacrificing herself to weaken Xizan. Attacking his weakened form, the duo are able to defeat Xizan. Afterwards, Nehani has been revived as a normal person. She and Knight settle down in Orgo with Baby. The game ends with a sepia tone picture of the three of them, happy. Gameplay From a technical standpoint and in terms of its contribution to the development of the RPG genre, Guardian's Crusade is noteworthy for several reasons. First, the game featured a seamless graphical transition between the overworld, towns, and flight, which all utilized the same graphical engine and scale. Many other RPGs before and since have relied on miniature, less detailed representations of towns when a player is exploring the overworld (e.g. the Final Fantasy games on the original PlayStation) or flying (e.g. Dragon Quest VIII). This feature helped to make the Guardian's Crusade world more immersive and is an impressive accomplishment given the technical limitations of the PlayStation console. Second, the game implemented a system that allowed players to choose whether or not to engage in battles. Enemies on the overworld and in dungeons were represented by different sized ghosts which would wander the landscape and chase after the player, but could be avoided through speed or stealth. Large aggressive pink ghosts represented enemy monsters with higher levels than the player. Enemies at a lower level were represented by smaller white ghosts that would actually flee from the player. This mechanic provided a visual indicator of how powerful the player character was becoming. Finally, the game incorporated a virtual pet. =Living Toys= Along the way, Knight encounters Living Toys (abbreviated LT on the battle menu), mystical clockwork toys that can move on their own and aid Knight, Baby, and Nehani in battle with certain skills. These Living Toys were created many years ago by Mr. Zeppetto, whose home is found off the coast of the left-hand continent south of Santa Claria and north of Den Heldar. Throughout the game, Living Toys can be found in various chests around the world. Each has its own unique moves or abilities. Summoning a Living Toy drains Knight's psychic points (PP), so once his PP is drained completely he can't summon them at all. Classification of Living Toys Living Toys can be classified according to their functions: Attackers ‚Äì Directly inflict damage upon an enemy in combat. Helpers ‚Äì Add extra power to your attacks, put the enemy to sleep, or help you defend against certain attacks. Healers ‚Äì Restore lost HP to one or more party members. Miscellaneous ‚Äì Are either useful outside of combat (like Mapster, who allows you to view the world map while outdoors in addition to attacking enemies in combat) or simply don't fit into another category. Living Toy Icons Each Living Toy is associated with one of three icons depending on how it is summoned in combat: Continuous (boxes) ‚Äì Will stay by your side until the battle ends or it gets attacked enough times. Multiple use (‚Üµ) ‚Äì Can be used multiple times in the same battle but must be re-summoned each time. Single use (*) ‚Äì Can only be used once per battle. Development Guardian's Crusade was developed by Tamsoft and was originally released in Japan on September 23, 1998 under the title Knight and Baby. The game picked up for publication outside Japan by Activision shortly after its launch. Originally titled Guardian Legends, the localized version was eventually changed to Guardian's Crusade because of a similarly-named game published by Br√∏derbund. According to the game's producer and associate producer, very few changes were made between the Japanese and North American versions of the game. These differences are mostly found in the intro and title screens, including different music for the opening cinema. One prominent removal includes a Living Toy called \\"Rust Bucket\\". This toy cast a spell called \\"Russian Roulette\\", in which he pointed a gun randomly at one of any of the characters in the battle, then fired. These changes are not present in the European release. The creators took particular pride in the game's Japanese writing and its transition to its English counterpart. \\"When games are generally translated, the feeling and true meaning of the text in its original form gets lost very easily. We did not want that to happen in Guardian's Crusade,\\" explained the producers. \\"The original spirit of the story and the humor was kept intact, and since this is not something that is easy to achieve, we are very proud of this accomplishment.\\" Reception Next Generation reviewed the PlayStation version of the game, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \\"Considering the competition from more well-known RPG brand names, Activision has done a fine job with Guardian's Crusade by giving the title charm and polish. Nice one.\\"  Notes  References Category:1998 video games Category:Activision games Category:PlayStation (console) games Category:PlayStation Network games Category:Role-playing video games Category:Video games developed in Japan ","title":"Guardian's Crusade"},{"id":"2590306","text":"Location of Kericho, Kenya Tea country surrounding Kericho Kericho is the biggest town in Kericho County located in the highlands west of the Kenyan Rift Valley.

He was initially a midfielder who, later in his career, became an effective full back. Hollins, throughout his footballing career, featured for clubs such as Chelsea, Queens Park Rangers, and Arsenal. Hollins made 714 First Division appearances, an English top division record for an outfield player and second only to goalkeeper Peter Shilton. Playing career Born in Guildford, Surrey, Hollins was born into a footballing family ‚Äì his father, grandfather and three brothers were all professional footballers as well. One of those siblings, Dave, played international football for Wales. =Chelsea= He joined Chelsea as a youth player and made his debut for the Blues against Swindon Town in September 1963 aged only 17. A talented and hard-running midfielder, usually wearing the number 4 shirt, he was known for his dedicated attitude to the game and went on to become a regular and eventually club captain. Hollins played 592 games, and scored 69 goals in his first spell at Chelsea, and was part of the successful Chelsea sides of the mid-1960s and early 1970s. After establishing himself in the Chelsea side in 1964, he rarely missed a game over the next decade, appearing in 400 out of a possible 420 league games, at one point making 167 consecutive appearances, a club record.http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football/chelsea-fc/john- hollins-7662/league-appearances-for-chelsea_a15343/ Hollins played in the first leg of the 3‚Äì2 aggregate victory over Leicester City in League Cup final in 1965 and the loss to Tottenham in the FA Cup final two years later. In 1970, he played a significant part in Chelsea's hard-fought FA Cup final win over Leeds United, supplying the cross for Ian Hutchinson's late headed equaliser at Wembley. Chelsea eventually won 2‚Äì1 in the replay at Old Trafford. They won the Cup Winners' Cup in Athens against Real Madrid a year later, again after a replay, but Hollins missed the second match due to an injury. He was Chelsea's player of the year two years running. While at Chelsea, he also won a solitary England cap, against Spain, on 24 May 1967. He had his most prolific goalscoring season for Chelsea in the 1971‚Äì72 season, finding the net 17 times. Chelsea also reached another League Cup final in 1972, losing to Stoke City, but declined thereafter, though Hollins remained until the side's relegation to the Second Division at the end of the 1974‚Äì75 season, when he was sold to nearby Queens Park Rangers. =Queens Park Rangers= In June 1975 he was signed by his former Chelsea manager Dave Sexton, for Queens Park Rangers for ¬£80,000. He stayed at the Hoops for four seasons, playing 183 matches in total and helping them to runners-up spot in the First Division in 1975‚Äì76. QPR lost the title to Liverpool by just one point. The veteran John Hollins, along with ex Chelsea veteran David Webb and ex Arsenal veteran Frank McLintock [ captain of the Arsenal double winning team ] had combined to so very nearly be First Division champions . =Arsenal= In the summer of 1979, the 33-year-old Hollins made a surprising move to Arsenal, initially as a cover player, but he ended up becoming a regular in the Arsenal side, although by now he played more often as a defender than in midfield. He played 172 matches and scored 13 goals, and was part of the Arsenal side that lost the Cup Winners' Cup final in 1980, coming on as a substitute. He did, however, miss out on a place in the squad for the same season's FA Cup final, which Arsenal also lost. He was awarded the MBE for services to football in 1981, and also made a memorable anti-smoking commercial for television in the same year as part of a Government campaign entitled Look After Yourself. =Back to Chelsea= Hollins returned to Chelsea on a free transfer in 1983, and helped the club gain promotion back to the First Division in 1983‚Äì84, playing a further 30 times. He retired at the end of that season, having played 939 first-class matches in total. Managerial career =Chelsea= Hollins was immediately appointed coach at Chelsea; a year later he became first-team manager following John Neal's retirement. Chelsea built up a strong title challenge in 1985‚Äì86 and went top in February, but they finished sixth after collecting a mere nine points from a possible 33 during their final 11 games. Chelsea won the Full Members Cup in the same season, though, hanging on for a 5‚Äì4 win over Manchester City at Wembley Stadium, having almost let slip a 5‚Äì1 lead. Hollins was sacked in March 1988 with the club in the midst of a four-month run without a league win which would see the season end in Chelsea being relegated in the first ever two-leg relegation/promotion play-offs against Middlesbrough . =Post- Chelsea= After leaving Chelsea in February 1989 he came out of retirement to sign for Irish club Cobh Ramblers. However, he only played one league game before returning to England. He then set up his own sports promotion and agency company, before being tempted back to join the coaching staff of his old club QPR in 1993, and stepped in as caretaker manager between Stewart Houston's dismissal and Ray Harford's appointment during the 1997‚Äì98 season. He later had spells as manager of Swansea City, Rochdale and as caretaker- manager of Stockport County. After which he managed Stockport County's Chinese affiliate club Stockport Tiger Star, before becoming a pundit for BBC Radio Five Live. He was most successful in his managerial reign with Swansea City where he quickly established himself as a fan favourite and guided Swansea to the Division Three title in 1999‚Äì2000, but was sacked after they failed to sustain themselves back in Division Two. He steered Rochdale into the play- offs in 2001‚Äì02 but was notoriously sacked by fax that summer after prevaricating over a new contract. He spent a short time as the assistant manager at Raith Rovers in 2004, under Claude Anelka‚Äîthe brother of Chelsea striker Nicolas Anelka. He resigned following disagreements over tactics with Anelka. On 21 November 2005, Hollins was announced as manager of Conference National side Crawley Town after the departure of Francis Vines. He remained with the club during the financial crisis that saw them docked ten points for going into administration, but left the club on 30 October 2006 after Crawley had been beaten by Lewes in the final qualifying round for the FA Cup. In 2007 when Kenny Jackett left Swansea City, Hollins re-applied to become the manager of Swansea City for the second time. He did not get the job as it went to Spaniard, Roberto Mart√≠nez. In January 2008, Hollins took over as manager of Conference National side Weymouth. He was joined just days later by Alan Lewer who filled the role of Hollins' assistant for the second time as they were together at Crawley Town.

Later in their career they became a four-piece, adding Rick Chase on vocals in 1986, in turn replaced by Keith Murrell in 1987 due to Rick's ill-health. Keith was later replaced with Connor McKeon in 1989 who was subsequently replaced with Mike Wilson in 1990. Biography The McManus brothers, who grew up on a farm near the village of Derrylin, Co. Fermanagh, started off their musical career as award-winning traditional Irish musicians, but were inspired by the Irish celtic rock band, Horslips, as well as younger brother Tommy's passion for the drums to form a rock band. In the late 1970s, the brothers had become fans of Horslips and attended their gigs at every possible opportunity. They eventually got to know and became friends with the band members. It was around that time that they started their own band which was originally called Pulse before they changed it to Mama's Boys. Barry Devlin of Horslips heard about their band and went to see them rehearse at their home. He was suitably impressed and offered them a support slot for Horslips' 1979 tour. Although their heroes Horslips mixed traditional music with hard rock and the McManus brothers were top notch traditional musicians, Mama's Boys did not really go for the Celtic fusion sound, apart from the occasional fiddle solo by Pat, but went for a harder edged more heavy metal sound. They recorded their first self-funded album Official Album (re-released in 1981 as Official Bootleg) in 1980 in only four hours. In 1981 they were invited to support Hawkwind on their UK tour. They recorded and self-financed their second album, entitled Plug It In in 1982, and achieved a hit single in Ireland with the most pop- oriented song on the album, \\"Needle in the Groove\\". The third album Turn It Up was released in 1983. The same year they toured with Thin Lizzy on that band's farewell tour, played at the Reading Rock Festival and signed a worldwide record deal with Jive Records. The first album released on Jive contained some songs previously released on early albums but completely re-recorded with a few new songs. One of the new songs, a cover of Slade's \\"Mama Weer All Crazee Now\\" was released as a single and reached number 54 in the American charts. The video for the song got a lot of airplay on MTV and helped the band to become known in the US which they toured in 1984. Coincidentally, the American heavy metal band Quiet Riot also released their cover version of the song at the same time as Mama's Boys, but Quiet Riot's version gained more airplay. 1985's Power and Passion album broke into the Billboard top 100 in the US and the band toured in the US, Europe and Japan. During the European leg of the tour Tommy had a relapse of leukemia which he had been treated for as a child and a replacement drummer Jimmy DeGrasso was brought in to complete the tour. The recovering Tommy rejoined the tour in Ireland but had to be rushed back to hospital after another relapse. In 1987, former Airrace vocalist Keith Murrell was brought in after Rick Chase started having trouble with his vocal cords and they recorded the album Growing Up The Hard Way. Murrell left in 1988 to join Cliff Richard as a backing singer. Connor McKeon replaced Keith on 1989, but this was short lived and he was replaced by Mike Wilson. In 1990, with a new vocalist, Mike Wilson, and under new management they moved their base to the UK. The live album Live Tonite was released in 1991 and the band toured extensively in Europe. They released the album Relativity in 1992. While on tour in Italy in 1993, Tommy became ill again and the tour had to be cancelled. The following year Tommy underwent a bone marrow transplant but he did not survive. His brothers were devastated and Mama's Boys did not continue. On the first anniversary of Tommy's death, John composed a traditional lament on the low whistle for his brother and this led to himself and Pat revisiting their traditional Irish music roots and forming a Celtic/new age group called Celtus. In 2003, Pat McManus joined with Irish rock band 'Indian' for two albums and live shows. After this he joined the Painkillers for a short while, and then formed \\"Pat McManus and High Voltage\\" which in 2007 became the Pat McManus Band with (Marty McDermott on bass and Paul Faloon on drums). The Pat McManus Band released Tattooed in Blue in 2018, and an acoustic guitar based album called Rewind in 2019, alongside a European tour.

The principal subject is \\"being qua being,\\" or being insofar as it is being. It examines what can be asserted about any being insofar as it is and not because of any special qualities it has. Also covered are different kinds of causation, form and matter, the existence of mathematical objects, and a prime-mover God.  Overview  The Metaphysics is considered to be one of the greatest philosophical works. Its influence on the Greeks, the Muslim philosophers, the scholastic philosophers and even writers such as Dante S. Fazzo, ‚ÄòS√¨ come rota ch'igualmente √® mossa‚Äô. Dalla Metafisica di Aristotele al Paradiso di Dante, Storie e linguaggi, Vol 4, N¬∞ 2 (2018), was immense. It consists essentially of a criticism of Plato's theory of Forms which Aristotle had studied as Plato's pupil at the Academy in Athens, with a worldview rooted in an analysis of natural language, common sense, and the observations gathered from the natural sciences. The result is a synthesis of the naturalism of empirical science, with a critical enquire into language, ontology and epistemology that informed the Western intellectual tradition for more than a thousand years.Lawson-Tancred, introduction. At the heart of the book lie three questions. What is existence, and what sorts of things exist in the world? How can things continue to exist, and yet undergo the change we see about us in the natural world? And how can this world be understood? By the time Aristotle was writing, the tradition of Greek philosophy was only two hundred years old. It had begun with the efforts of thinkers in the Greek world to theorize about the common structure that underlies the changes we observe in the natural world. Two contrasting theories, those of Heraclitus and Parmenides, were an important influence on both Plato and Aristotle. Heraclitus emphasized the constantly changing nature of apparent reality. By contrast, Parmenides argued that we can reach certain conclusions by means of reason alone, making no use of the senses. What we acquire through the process of reason is fixed, unchanging and eternal. The world is not made up of a variety of things in constant flux, but of one single Truth or reality. Plato‚Äôs theory of forms is a synthesis of these two views. Given, any object that changes is in an imperfect state. Then, the form of each object we see in this world is an imperfect reflection of the perfect form of the object. For example, Plato claimed a chair may take many forms, but in the perfect world there is only one perfect form of chair. Aristotle encountered the theory of forms when he studied at the Academy, which he joined at the age of about 18 in the 360s B.C.E.Lawson-Tancred. Aristotle soon expanded on the concept of forms in his Metaphysics. He believed that in every change there is something which persists through the change (for example, Socrates), and something else which did not exist before, but comes into existence as a result of the change (musical Socrates). To explain how Socrates comes to be born (since he did not exist before he was born) Aristotle says that it is ‚Äòmatter‚Äô (hyle) that underlies the change. The matter has the ‚Äòform‚Äô of Socrates imposed on it to become Socrates himself. Thus all the things around us, all substances, are composites of two radically different things: form and matter. This doctrine is sometimes known as Hylomorphism (from the Greek words for \\"matter\\" and \\"form\\"). Title, date, and the arrangement of the treatises Book 7 of the Metaphysics: Ens dicitur multipliciter- the word 'being' is meant in many ways. From a manuscript of William of Moerbeke's translation Subsequent to the arrangement of Aristotle's works by scholars at Alexandria in the first century CE, a number of his treatises were referred to as œÑ·Ω∞ ŒºŒµœÑ·Ω∞ œÑ·Ω∞ œÜœÖœÉŒπŒ∫Œ¨ (ta meta ta physika; literally, \\"the [writings] after the Physics\\"). This is the origin of the title for collection of treatises now known as Aristotle's Metaphysics. Some have interpreted the expression \\"œÑ·Ω∞ ŒºŒµœÑ·Ω∞ œÑ·Ω∞ œÜœÖœÉŒπŒ∫Œ¨\\" to imply that the subject of the work goes \\"beyond\\" that of Aristotle's Physics or that it is metatheoretical in relation to the Physics. But others believe that \\"œÑ·Ω∞ ŒºŒµœÑ·Ω∞ œÑ·Ω∞ œÜœÖœÉŒπŒ∫Œ¨\\" referred simply to the work's place in the canonical arrangement of Aristotle's writings, which is at least as old as Andronicus of Rhodes or even Hermippus of Smyrna.W. D. Ross, Aristotle's Metaphysics (1953), vol. 1, p. xxxii. Within the Aristotelian corpus itself,e.g., in Movement of Animals 700b9. the metaphysical treatises are referred to as œÑ·Ω∞ œÄŒµœÅ·Ω∂ œÑ·øÜœÇ œÄœÅœéœÑŒ∑œÇ œÜŒπŒªŒøœÉŒøœÜŒØŒ±œÇ (literally, \\"the [writings] concerning first philosophy\\"); \\"first philosophy\\" was what Aristotle called the subjects of metaphysics. (He called the study of nature or natural philosophy \\"second philosophy\\" (Metaphysics 1037a15).) It is notoriously difficult to specify the date at which Aristotle wrote these treatises as a whole or even individually, especially because the Metaphysics is, in Jonathan Barnes' words, \\"a farrago, a hotch-potch\\", and more generally because of the difficulty of dating any of Aristotle's writings.Jonathan Barnes, \\"Life and Work\\" in The Cambridge Companion to Aristotle (1995), pp. 18-22.\\"Farrago\\": Barnes, \\"Metaphysics\\" in The Cambridge Companion to Aristotle, p. 68. In the manuscripts, books are referred to by Greek letters. The second book was given the title \\"little alpha,\\" apparently because it appears to have nothing to do with the other books (and, very early, it was supposed not to have been written by Aristotle) or, although this is less likely, because of its shortness. This, then, disrupts the correspondence of letters to numbers, as book 2 is little alpha, book 3 is beta, and so on. For many scholars, it is customary to refer to the books by their letter names. Thus book 1 is called Alpha (Œë); 2, little alpha (Œ±); 3, Beta (Œí); 4, Gamma (Œì); 5, Delta (Œî); 6, Epsilon (Œï); 7, Zeta (Œñ); 8, Eta (Œó); 9, Theta (Œò); 10, Iota (Œô); 11, Kappa (Œö); 12, Lambda (Œõ); 13, Mu (Œú); 14, Nu (Œù). It is possible that Aristotle did not write the books in the order in which they have come down to us; their arrangement is due to later editors, and there is little reason to think that it reflects how Aristotle himself would have arranged them. Based on a careful study of the content of the books and of the cross-references within them, W. D. Ross concluded that books A, B, Œì, E, Z, H, Œò, M, N, and I \\"form a more or less continuous work\\", while the remaining books Œ±, Œî, Œö and Œõ were inserted into their present locations by later editors. However, Ross cautions that books A, B, Œì, E, Z, H, Œò, M, N, and I ‚Äî with or without the insertion of the others ‚Äî do not constitute \\"a complete work\\".Aristotle's Metaphysics (1953), vol. 1, p. xxiii. Reading the Metaphysics implies the reference to one or more critical editions of the Greek text. In the 20th century two general editions have been produced by W. D. Ross (1924) and by W. Jaeger (1957). Editing the Metaphysics has become an open issue in works and studies of the new millennium. New critical editions have been produced of the books Gamma (Myriam Hecquet, Aristote, M√©taphysique Gamma, Peeters 2008), Alpha (0liver Primavesi, Aristotle Metaphysics Alpha, OUP 2012), and Lambda (Silvia Fazzo, Il libro Lambda della Metafisica di Aristotele, \\"Elenchos\\", Bibliopolis 2012, and Stefan Alexandru, Aristotle's Metaphysics Lambda, Philosophia Antiqua, Brill 2014) books. Differences from their more-familiar 20th Century critical editions (W. D. Ross, 1924, W. Jaeger 1957) mainly depend on the stemma codicum of Aristotle's Metaphysics, of which different versions have been proposed since 1970 (Silvio Bernardinello, Eliminatio codicum della Metafisica di Aristotele, Padua, Antenore, 1970), most remarkably by Dieter Harlfinger in 1979 (\\"Zur √úberlieferungsgeschichte der Metaphysik\\", in Pierre Aubenque (ed.), Essais sur la M√©taphysique d'Aristote, Paris, Vrin, 1979). Silvia Fazzo, \\"Lo Stemma Codicum della Metafisica di Aristotele\\", Revue d'Histoire des Textes, XII, 2017, 35-58. Summary = Books I‚ÄìVI: Alpha, little Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Epsilon = Book I or Alpha outlines \\"first philosophy\\", which is a knowledge of the first principles or causes of things. The wise are able to teach because they know the why of things, unlike those who only know that things are a certain way based on their memory and sensations. Because of their knowledge of first causes and principles, they are better fitted to command, rather than to obey. Book Alpha also surveys previous philosophies from Thales to Plato, especially their treatment of causes. Book II or \\"little alpha\\": The purpose of this chapter is to address a possible objection to Aristotle‚Äôs account of how we understand first principles and thus acquire wisdom. Aristotle replies that the idea of an infinite causal series is absurd, and thus there must be a first cause which is not itself caused. This idea is developed later in book Lambda, where he develops an argument for the existence of God. Book III or Beta lists the main problems or puzzles (·ºÄœÄŒøœÅŒØŒ± aporia) of philosophy.Robert Maynard Hutchins (1952), Great Books of the Western World 8: Aristotle, p. 495. Book IV or Gamma: Chapters 2 and 3 argue for its status as a subject in its own right. The rest is a defense of (a) what we now call the principle of contradiction, the principle that it is not possible for the same proposition to be (the case) and not to be (the case), and (b) what we now call the principle of excluded middle: tertium non datur ‚Äî there cannot be an intermediary between contradictory statements. Book V or Delta (\\"philosophical lexicon\\") is a list of definitions of about thirty key terms such as cause, nature, one, and many. Book VI or Epsilon has two main concerns. Aristotle is first concerned with a hierarchy of the sciences. As we know, a science can be either productive, practical or theoretical. Because theoretical sciences study being or beings for their own sake‚Äîfor example, Physics studies beings that can be moved (1025b27)‚Äîand do not have a target (œÑŒ≠ŒªŒøœÇ, end or goal; œÑŒ≠ŒªŒµŒπŒøœÇ, complete or perfect) beyond themselves, they are superior. The study of being qua being, or First Philosophy, is superior to all the other theoretical sciences because it is concerned the ultimate causes of all reality, not just the secondary causes of a part of reality. The second concern of Epsilon is proving that being (œÑ·Ω∏ ·ΩÑŒΩ) considered per accidens (Œ∫Œ±œÑ·Ω∞ œÉœÖŒºŒ≤ŒµŒ≤Œ∑Œ∫·Ω∏œÇ) cannot be studied as a science. Per accidens being does not involve art (œÑŒ≠œáŒΩŒ∑), nor does exist by necessity (per se or Œ∫Œ±Œ∏·æΩ Œ±·ΩëœÑœå), and therefore does not deserve to be studied as a science. Aristotle dismisses the study of the per accidens as a science fit for Sophists, a group whose philosophies (or lack thereof) he consistently rejects throughout the Metaphysics. = Books VII-IX: Zeta, Eta, and Theta = The Middle Books are generally considered the core of the Metaphysics. VII: Zeta Book Zeta begins with the remark that ‚ÄòBeing‚Äô has many senses. The purpose of philosophy is to understand being. The primary kind of being is what Aristotle calls substance. What substances are there, and are there any substances besides perceptible ones? Aristotle considers four candidates for substance: (i) the ‚Äòessence‚Äô or ‚Äòwhat it was to be a thing‚Äô (ii) the Platonic universal, (iii) the genus to which a substance belongs and (iv) the substratum or ‚Äòmatter‚Äô which underlies all the properties of a thing. He dismisses the idea that matter can be substance, for if we eliminate everything that is a property from what can have the property, we are left with something that has no properties at all. Such 'ultimate matter' cannot be substance. Separability and 'this-ness' are fundamental to our concept of substance. Chapters 4‚Äì12 are devoted to Aristotle‚Äôs own theory that essence is the criterion of substantiality. The essence of something is what is included in a secundum se ('according to itself') account of a thing, i.e. which tells what a thing is by its very nature. You are not musical by your very nature. But you are a human by your very nature. Your essence is what is mentioned in the definition of you. Chapters 13‚Äì15 consider, and dismiss, the idea that substance is the universal or the genus, and are mostly an attack on the Platonic theory of Ideas. Aristotle argues that if genus and species are individual things, then different species of the same genus contain the genus as individual thing, which leads to absurdities. Moreover, individuals are incapable of definition. Chapter 17 takes an entirely fresh direction, which turns on the idea that substance is really a cause. VIII: Eta Book Eta consists of a summary of what has been said so far (i.e., in Book Zeta) about substance, and adds a few further details regarding difference and unity. IX: Theta Theta sets out to define potentiality and actuality. Chapters 1‚Äì5 discuss potentiality. We learn that this term indicates the potential (Œ¥œçŒΩŒ±ŒºŒπœÇ, dunamis) of something to change: potentiality is \\"a principle of change in another thing or in the thing itself qua other\\" (1046a9). In chapter 6 Aristotle turns to actuality. We can only know actuality through observation or \\"analogy;\\" thus \\"as that which builds is to that which is capable of building, so is that which is awake to that which is asleep...or that which is separated from matter to matter itself\\" (1048b1‚Äì4). Actuality is the completed state of something that had the potential to be completed. The relationship between actuality and potentiality can be thought of as the relationship between form and matter, but with the added aspect of time. Actuality and potentiality are diachronic (across time) distinctions, whereas form and matter are synchronic (at one time) distinctions. = Books X‚ÄìXIV: Iota, Kappa, Lambda, Mu, and Nu = Book X or Iota: Discussion of unity, one and many, sameness and difference. Book XI or Kappa: Briefer versions of other chapters and of parts of the Physics. Book XII or Lambda: Further remarks on beings in general, first principles, and God or gods. This book includes Aristotle's famous description of the unmoved mover, \\"the most divine of things observed by us\\", as \\"the thinking of thinking\\". Books XIII and XIV, or Mu and Nu: Philosophy of mathematics, in particular how numbers exist. Style Many scholars believe that Aristotle's works as we have them today are little more than lecture notes.E.g. J.A.K. Thomson, The Ethics of Aristotle, (Penguin, 1953) p. 13 and E. Barker The Political Thought of Plato and Aristotle (Dover, 1959) p. 65. Many of his works are extremely compressed and thus baffling to beginners. Nowhere is this more evident than in the Metaphysics ‚Äî Ibn Sina (Avicenna), one of the greatest Medieval Islamic philosophers, said that he had read the Metaphysics of Aristotle forty times, but still did not understand it. Only later, after having read al-Farabi's, Purposes of the Metaphysics of Aristotle, did he understand Aristotle's book.I read the Metaphysics [of Aristotle], but I could not comprehend its contents, and its author's object remained obscure to me, even when I had gone back and read it forty times and had got to the point where I had memorized it. In spite of this I could not understand it nor its object, and I despaired of myself and said, \\"This is a book which there is no way of understanding.\\" But one day in the afternoon when I was at the booksellers' quarter a salesman approached with a book in his hand which he was calling out for sale. (...) So I bought it and, lo and behold, it was Abu Nasr al-Farabi's book on the objects of the Metaphysics.[probably the Kitab al-huruf, ed. by Muhsin Mahdi as Alfarabi's Book of Letters (Beyrouth, 1969).] I returned home and was quick to read it, and in no time the objects of that book became clear to me because I had got to the point of having memorized it by heart. (William E. Gohlam (ed.). The Life of Ibn Sina, Albany, State of New York University Press, 1974, pp. 33-35). In the 19th century, with the rise of textual criticism, the Metaphysics was examined anew. Critics, noting the wide variety of topics and the seemingly illogical order of the books, concluded that it was actually a collection of shorter works thrown together haphazardly. Werner Jaeger further maintained that the different books were taken from different periods of Aristotle's life. Everyman's Library, for their 1000th volume, published the Metaphysics in a rearranged order that was intended to make the work easier for readers.  Translations and influence  With the Fall of Rome in the latter half of the 5th century, knowledge of, and access to Metaphysics was lost to the non-Greek speaking world. The translation of Metaphysics into Arabic in Baghdad in the 9th century led to a rediscovery of Aristotle's work in the Arabic speaking world. These Arabic translations derived from early Syriac translations from the original Greek (see Medieval Philosophy). The flourishing of Arabic Aristotelian scholarship reached its peak with the work of Ibn Rushd (Latinized: Averroes), whose extensive writings on Aristotle's work led to his later designation as \\"The Commentator\\" by future generations of scholars. The Fourth Crusade (1202-1204) facilitated the discovery and delivery of many original Greek manuscripts back to the European centers of learning. Finally, after over 700 years of obscurity, the work could finally be studied in the original and properly translated into Latin. One of the first Latin translations was made by William of Moerbeke. William's translations are literal, and were intended faithfully to reflect the Greek word order and style. These formed the basis of the commentaries of Albert the Great, Thomas Aquinas and Duns Scotus. They were also used by modern scholars for Greek editions, as William had access to Greek manuscripts that are now lost. Werner Jaeger lists William's translation in his edition of the Greek text in the Scriptorum Classicorum Bibliotheca Oxoniensis (Oxford 1962).Cited by Foster, in his translation of Aquinas' commentary on the De Anima, Indiana 1994.

Until the 1980s, Blackrod had a poor frequency of service,BR Timetable 1973, table 96 but for many years it has been a popular commuter station.  Technical Railway Information The station had until recently a signal box, the only one on the entire Manchester to Preston route. This had outlasted the others as it acted as the 'fringe' to both the Manchester Piccadilly signalling centre and Preston PSB. The train description system used in the Preston installation was incompatible with that installed at Piccadilly so the signaller at Blackrod had to transfer train data manually from one system to the other as each one passed through his/her control area. A similar situation existed at on the Bolton to Blackburn line, where the two control areas also overlap. Network Rail announced in May 2012 that the box was due to be abolished in January 2013, with control passing to the Piccadilly signalling centre. This is part of a programme of signalling renewals associated with the planned electrification of the Manchester to Preston line (due for completion in 2016). The box was duly decommissioned on 10 February 2013 and subsequently demolished.Blackrod Station - Past & Present www.blackrod.org website news article; Retrieved 2012-10-29 Blackrod in 1962 2012 Refurbishment Over one million pounds' worth of improvements to the station (including the removal of the footbridge shown in the photo and its replacement with step-free access ramps) were completed in November 2012.

(Compare with the American \\"fuck around.\\") It is a shortening of the idiom taking the piss out of, which is an expression meaning to mock, tease, joke, ridicule, or scoff. It is not to be confused with \\"taking a piss\\", which refers to the act of urinating. Taking the Mickey (Mickey Bliss, Cockney rhyming slang), taking the Mick or taking the Michael is another term for making fun of someone. These terms are most widely used in the United Kingdom, Ireland, South Africa, New Zealand and Australia. Usage The term sometimes refers to a form of mockery in which the mocker exaggerates the other person's characteristics; pretending to take on his or her attitudes, etc., for the purpose of comedic effect at the expense of another. This would be described as \\"taking the piss\\" out of that person, or \\"a piss-take\\". It may also be used to refer to a ruse whereby a person is led to believe a plainly unbelievable fact for the purpose of ridicule of the subject, e.g. \\"Are you being serious?\\" \\"No, I'm just taking the piss.\\" The phrase is in common usage throughout British society, employed by headline writers in broadsheet gazettes and tabloids as well as colloquially. It is also used in English speaking countries such as Australia. In colloquial usage, \\"taking the piss\\" is also used to refer to someone or something that makes a claim which is not in line with a recognised agreement e.g. an invoice that is double the quoted price with no explanation for the added charge could be said to \\"take the piss\\", or likewise if something consistently misses a deadline. The term can also mean to take unfair advantage. For example, if someone has a food buffet and one guest clearly takes more than his expected share. It can also relate to an abuse of trust, such as \\"You can use my 'phone, but don't take the piss!\\", i.e. do not abuse my offer of assistance by making lengthy calls that will cost me a lot of money. Equally, a wilfully unproductive employee could be described as \\"taking the piss\\" for accepting a wage while knowingly failing to deliver on their obligation, or an employer could be accused of \\"taking the piss\\" for making unreasonable requests of their employees, e.g. expecting them to do unpaid overtime. Origin \\"Take the Piss \\" may be a reference to a related (and dated) idiomatic expression, piss-proud, which is a vulgar pun referring to the morning erections which happen when a man awakens at the end of a dream cycle (each about 90 minutes in length throughout the night) or may be caused by a full bladder pressing upon nerves that help effect erection. This could be considered a \\"false\\" erection, as its origin is physiological not sexual, so in a metaphoric sense, then, someone who is \\"piss-proud\\" would suffer from false pride, and taking the piss out of them refers to deflating this false pride, through disparagement or mockery. As knowledge of the expression's metaphoric origin became lost on users, \\"taking the piss out of\\" came to be synonymous with disparagement or mockery itself, with less regard to the pride of the subject. Conversely, the North East of England also lays claim to the phrase's origin, citing the urine trade which was seen as an undesireable cargo for sailors working from the River Tyne. Because the city collected urine from public facilities and exported a refined version of it, it was often used as ship's ballast in place of water - having a resale value at the other end of the journey. Consequently, sailors discussing their cargo in local establishments would genially accuse others reputed to be lying about their cargo of \\"taking the piss\\" - or hauling urine. \\"Take the mickey\\" may be an abbreviated form of the Cockney rhyming slang \\"take the Mickey Bliss\\", a euphemism for \\"take the piss.\\" It has also been suggested that \\"mickey\\" is a contraction of \\"micturition,\\" in which case \\"take the micturition\\" would be a synonymous euphemism for \\"take the piss.\\" The phrase has been noted since the 1930s.

The main stem of the river is about long, and its headwaters are split into three major forks. The Yuba River proper is formed at the confluence of the North Yuba and Middle Yuba Rivers, with the South Yuba joining a short distance downstream. Measured to the head of the North Yuba River, the Yuba River is just over long. The river drains , mostly in the western slope and foothills of the Sierra Nevada. The average runoff of the Yuba River basin is approximately per year, providing about one-third of the flow of the Feather River, and 10 percent of the flow of the Sacramento River, which the Feather ultimately drains into. Since the early 20th century, the river's flow has been gradually reduced by irrigation and hydropower diversion projects. The river's name comes from a Maidu village, spelled in early records as Yubu and applied to the river by 1844. Some claim the name is a variant of Spanish uba or uva, referring to grapes found growing along the banks of the river.Yuba City budget Course =North Yuba River= The North Yuba River, long,U.S. Geological Survey. National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map, accessed March 10, 2011 rises at Yuba Pass along California State Route 49, near the eastern boundary of the Tahoe National Forest. It flows southwest then west through a canyon past the communities of Downieville (where it receives the Downie River from the north) and Goodyears Bar. Its main tributaries, Canyon Creek and Slate Creek, join from the north shortly downstream of there. The river turns south near Clipper Mills and flows into the New Bullards Bar Reservoir, impounded by -high New Bullards Bar Dam. About below New Bullards Bar Dam, it joins with the Middle Yuba River to form the Yuba River. =Middle Yuba River= Originating in a bowl-shaped valley in Moscove Meadow, the Middle Yuba River flows north into Jackson Meadows Reservoir, then turns west, soon entering a steep gorge. The majority of the river demarcates the boundary of Sierra County in the north and Nevada County in the south. It receives Kanaka Creek from the north and is then interrupted by the Our House Diversion Dam, which diverts water from the Middle Fork to the North Fork at New Bullards Bar Reservoir. Below the dam, it continues flowing west, receives Oregon Creek from the north and intersects California State Route 49 about northwest of North San Juan. About downstream it joins with the North Yuba River. =South Yuba River= The South Yuba River originates at Lake Angela in Nevada County about three quarters of a mile north of Donner Pass, about three miles east of the town of Soda Springs. After passing through Lake Van Norden with Upper Castle Creek (longer than the Lake Angela stem) entering from the right, it gathers numerous snow-fed tributaries running west through a marshy, lake-filled valley, crossing Interstate 80 several times. The river briefly enters Placer County before flowing back north into Nevada County, then flows into Lake Spaulding, where much of its water is diverted south to the Bear River drainage. The remainder of the river turns northward into a gorge near Emigrant Gap before continuing west. It receives Canyon Creek from the right, then receives Poorman Creek also from the right near Washington. The river continues west into the foothills and into South Yuba River State Park where it is bridged by State Route 49. It joins the Yuba River at the upper end of Englebright Lake. =Main stem= Satellite view of the lower Yuba River -- Yuba City/Marysville and the Feather River lie near the bottom left; Yuba Goldfields are in the upper right center From the joining of the North Yuba River and Middle Yuba River, it flows southwards, then southwest, through the Sierra Nevada foothills, forming the Yuba-Nevada County border. The river widens into upper Englebright Lake near French Bar, and is joined by the South Yuba within the reservoir. It passes through the Englebright Dam near Lake Wildwood and is then joined by Deer Creek (which flows out of Lake Wildwood) on the left. The Yuba River bed widens considerably as it flows out into the Sacramento Valley near the Yuba Goldfields, a section of the Yuba River valley consisting of dredged sediments washed down by hydraulic mining in the 19th century. The river then turns southwest, flowing through irrigated farmland. It then skirts the south side of Marysville and empties into the Feather River between the cities of Marysville, Yuba City and Linda. History Large gold nugget from the Yuba River placers, weight 182 g. The Yuba River valley was originally one of the most densely populated Native American areas in California. Historians divide indigenous peoples living in the Yuba River area into several groups ‚Äì the Konkow, Maidu, Nisenan and Miwok. These groups did not function as large tribes; rather, they were divided into hundreds of small villages, with distinct governments but similar customs. Like other indigenous people of the Sierra Nevada foothill region, their staple food was acorns, but they also hunted and gathered for other foods including abundant salmon runs in the Yuba River. In the 1850s, the California Gold Rush brought large numbers of European-American settlers into the area, followed by many Mexican, African and Chinese immigrants. These settlers brought diseases with them, to which the Native Americans had no immunity. Within a few years, these diseases wiped out most of the native population. The Yuba River and its forks were one of the richest parts of the Mother Lode, and miners poured to the region in great numbers. Although gold was first extracted by simple methods such as panning and sluicing, large-scale industrial hydraulic mining left a much greater impact. About 25 million cubic yards (19,400,000 m3) of hydraulic mining debris was carried down the Yuba River. This raised stream beds up to in places, buried riverside land under sediment, and increased the risk of flooding. The practice was banned in 1884 following lawsuits from farmers who had been affected by the debris flows. Much of the debris left by the destruction of hydraulic mining remains today as the Yuba Goldfields. In addition, the extensive use of mercury in processing gold led to contamination of a relatively large area. The contamination was still detectable in 2013 and will be so for an estimated time of more than 10,000 years. In 1877, the world's first long-distance telephone line was strung along the South Yuba River from French Corral to French Lake (now called Bowman Lake), a distance of . Dams and diversions Yuba River at Parks Bar, 1991 Like the majority of California rivers, the Yuba was dammed at many points during the 20th century, and large amounts of water are withdrawn for irrigation and municipal water supply. Daguerre Point Dam was built in 1906 by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in order to trap hydraulic mining debris. After concerns about its impact on fish populations, the dam was fitted with fish ladders in 1937.http://www.water.ca.gov/fishpassage/projects/daguerre.cfm In 1922-24 PG&E; built the original Bullards Bar Dam to produce hydroelectricity and trap debris. The concrete arch Englebright Dam was built in 1941 to trap mining debris following the re-legalization of hydraulic mining during the 1930s. However, mining never resumed on a Gold Rush scale in the Yuba River watershed. Today, Englebright serves mainly to produce hydroelectricity. New Bullards Bar Dam was built on the North Yuba River in response to the huge flood of December 1955, which destroyed much of Yuba City. Completed in 1969, the high concrete arch dam is one of the tallest dams in the United States, replacing and submerging the old Bullards Bar Dam. It stores almost 1 million acre feet (1.2 km3) to provide flood control, irrigation and hydroelectricity. The Yuba River Development Project includes New Bullards Bar Dam and a number of supporting facilities, including a diversion dam (Our House Dam) and tunnel which divert the Middle Yuba River into New Bullards Bar Reservoir, to increase hydropower generation. The 340 megawatt New Colgate Powerhouse is located about below New Bullards Bar Dam, and it generates over 1.3 billion kilowatt hours of energy per year.http://www.ycwa- relicensing.com/Relicensing%20Documents/Relicensing%20Documents%2001%20-%20Preliminary%20Information%20Package/3_0%20-%20General%20Description%20of%20River%20Basin.pdfhttp://www.ycwa- relicensing.com/default.aspx These diversions have resulted in the seasonal dewatering of the lower North Yuba River and Middle Yuba River and about four miles of the main Yuba River. The Middle Yuba River and South Yuba River are linked by the Yuba-Bear and Drum-Spaulding hydroelectric projects, which are owned by the Nevada Irrigation District and PG&E;, respectively. These two interconnected projects generate a combined 1.2 billion kilowatt hours per yearhttp://www.foothillswaternetwork.org/relicensing/index.php and with over 40 dams and reservoirs and 16 powerhouses, are considered the most complex hydroelectric scheme in the United States.http://www.hdrinc.com/portfolio/yuba-bear-and-drum-spaulding- hydroelectric-project-relicensings Major dams include Jackson Meadows Dam and Bowman Dam (part of Yuba-Bear) and Lake Spaulding Dam and Fordyce Lake Dam (part of Drum-Spaulding). These projects divert a portion of the Yuba River's flow to the Bear River, a tributary of the Feather River further south. Other dams include Scotts Flat and Wildwood on Deer Creek; and Mildred and Virginia Ranch on Dry Creek, a lower tributary of the Yuba. Environmental issues The California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment has issued a safe eating advisory for any fish caught in Yuba River, North Yuba River, and Middle Yuba River due to elevated levels of mercury.

W. Murnau. The film was an unauthorized adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson's 1886 novella The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, but the source material went unrecognized by some of the German media due to changes in the characters' names. Released on 17 September 1920 by the Lipow Co., this is one of Murnau's lost films. The screenplay was written by Hans Janowitz, who collaborated with Carl Mayer on the script for The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1919). While the film itself does not survive, the scripts and related production notes do. Because the film is lost, its full length is unknown.  Plot  Conrad Veidt plays Dr. Warren (the Dr. Jekyll character) who changes into Mr. O'Connor (a parallel of Mr. Hyde). This transformation is brought about, not by experimentation with chemicals as in Stevenson's original, but through the supernatural agency of a bust of Janus (the Roman god of the doorway), which Warren / O'Connor purchases in the opening sequence as a gift for his sweetheart, Jane Lanyon (Margarete Schlegel). When she refuses the gift, horrified, Warren / O'Connor is forced to keep the statuette himself. It is at this point Dr. Warren first transforms into the gruesome character Mr. O'Connor, and returns to Jane's house in a rage, kidnapping her and taking her back to his laboratory. Upon recovery, Warren is horrified by what he has done and tries to sell the bust at auction, but the hold it has over him forces him to buy it back again. A second transformation proves to be his ruin, committing random acts of violence in the streets. Ultimately, Dr. Warren as Mr. O'Connor is forced to take poison after locking himself in his laboratory. He dies, clutching the statue to his chest.

Stevenson's classic novella The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde was released in 1920, the same year as an American version, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde released by Paramount Pictures and starring John Barrymore.

There are large groups of Indo-Trinidadians, Indo-Guyanese, Indo-Surinamese, and Indo-Jamaicans in the United States, especially in the New York metropolitan area and Florida. The Washington metropolitan area, Texas, and Minnesota also have small numbers of Indo-Guyanese and Indo-Trinidadians. Indo-Caribbean Americans is a subgroup of Indian Americans. Migration history Since the 1960s, a large Indo-Caribbean community has developed in Jamaica, New York, a neighborhood in the New York City borough of Queens. The Indo-Caribbean population has also grown rapidly in the Floridian cities of Tampa, Orlando (a large concentration of Indo-Caribbean Americans from New York have migrated here), Fort Myers, Naples, Fort Lauderdale, Miami, Port Saint Lucie, Coral Springs, Margate, North Lauderdale (more than 1% of residents in the city were born in Trinidad and Tobago), Sunrise, Plantation, Parkland, Lauderhill, Pompano Beach, Hollywood, Cooper City, Miramar, Davie, Weston, Southwest Ranches, and Pembroke Pines. Indo-Surinamese tend to migrate to the Netherlands, but have started to settle in Florida and the New York metropolitan area in small numbers. Indo-Jamaicans also live in moderate numbers throughout the New York metropolitan area and Florida. There are also smaller numbers of Indo-Barbadians, Indo-Belizeans, Indo-French Guianese, Indo-Grenadians, Indo-Guadeloupeans, Indo-Martiniquais, Indo-Kittitian and Nevisian, Indo-Saint Lucian, Indo-Vincentian and Grenadinese in the New York metropolitan area and in Florida.

There is also a Indo-Caribbean Muslim program on WWNN hosted by Al Mustapha. Most cultural shows continue to tie a cultural bond between the Indo-Caribbean and Indian-American communities, as well as inter-religious bonding between Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Jains, and Buddhist especially those hosted at educational institutions with an Indian student association like Florida International University, Florida Atlantic University, Nova Southeastern University, and the University of Miami.

Maharaj and hosts one of the largest annual Diwali shows in Florida), the Shree Saraswati Devi Mandir in Oakland Park, Krishna Mandir in Hollywood, Arya Samaj Mandir in Riverland, Shiva Lingam Mandir (Shiv Shakti Hanuman Mandir) in Margate, Palm Beach Hindu Mandir in Loxahatchee, Sanatan Sansthan Mandir in Loxahatchee, Shri Lakshmi Mandir in West Palm Beach, Florida Sevashram Sangha in Lake Worth, Lakshmi Narayan Mandir in Palmetto Estates, Amar Jyoti Mandir in Palmetto Bay, Sai Baba Mandir in Doral, and the Shri Mariamman Kovil in Opa-locka, are largely attended by Indo-Caribbeans. Plantation High School, a school where most Caribbeans and Asians are of Indian descent, hosted an annual Diwali show from 1993 to 2008. Starting as a one-day event in 2008 and expanding to a three-day event since 2009, the Divali Nagar USA entertains the local community with musical and religious performances, food, and vendors. Music is a large part of the Indo-Caribbean American community, which includes the tunes of Bollywood, Carnatic music, taan, bhajans, kirtan, quwwalis, Sufi, chutney music, baithak gana, chutney parang, chutney soca, tassa, soca, parang, steel pan, and calypso. Bharatnatyam and kathak are respected classical traditional dances, and dance items from Hindi films, Bhojpuri films, Tamil films, and Telugu films have grown in favor as well. With the increasing emphasis on partying, Bollywood, chutney, chutney-soca, and soca music are preferred by the young crowd. (see Indo-Caribbean music) In 2008 the nonprofit organization Jayadevi Arts Inc (JAI) was founded to preserve, present, unite, educate, and promote the arts and culture of Indo-Caribbean communities from Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago, Jamaica, Suriname, and other parts of the Caribbean living in the South Florida area. JAI works to rejuvenate Indo-Caribbean cultural and artistic life and to restore self-esteem to this new American community. Their future events are a United Phagwa Parade, preserving and promoting dying art forms, and educating the youths on Indo-Caribbean traditions and culture.

The station is located on the Manchester to Preston line and the Ribble Valley line, and is managed by Northern Trains. The station is north west of Manchester Piccadilly. Ticket gates have been in operation at the station since 2016. The railway station was originally named Bolton Trinity Street to differentiate it from nearby Bolton Great Moor Street station which closed in 1954. The station was also known as \\"Bridgeman Street Station\\" and \\"Bradford Square Station\\". From the railway station, there are frequent services to Manchester Victoria, Manchester Piccadilly, Clitheroe via Blackburn, Wigan North Western, and Preston. Services operating to Victoria and Piccadilly operate through and terminate at other regional stations, such as Manchester Airport and Stalybridge. There is 1 train per weekday from Southport to Leeds. There is no return service. The entrance and ticket office are at street level, at which there is a footbridge to the bus station and a taxi rank. A walkway leads to the platforms which are in a cutting. The main island platform has a buffet. The original main station building was demolished in the 1980s, but the Victorian buildings survive on the platforms. The clock tower was dismantled and rebuilt next to the new station. History Trinity Street station opened when the Manchester and Bolton Railway completed its route to Salford Central in 1838. The line extended to Manchester Victoria in 1843. This line was extended to Preston by the Bolton and Preston Railway in 1841. The route northwards, now the Ribble Valley Line, to Blackburn followed four years later, whilst the Liverpool and Bury Railway's arrival in 1848 gave the town links eastward to Bury & Rochdale and westwards to Wigan & Liverpool. These lines had all become part of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway system by 1858. The network of routes radiating from Bolton has remained largely unchanged to this day, the one exception being the line to Rochdale which closed on 5 October 1970. Through trains to Liverpool ended in 1977 with the closure of Liverpool Exchange station, but the line to Wigan remains open. Trains to Manchester Piccadilly and beyond began running in May 1988 with the opening of the Windsor Link. View northward from the main Down platform in 1965 Automatic ticket barriers have been operational at the station since 12 December 2016.\\"Ticket change for commuters using Bolton train station from Monday\\" Thorpe, Liam The Bolton News article 10 December 2016 Northern (Arriva Rail North Limited) had announced its intention to install them here (and at several other locations) earlier in the year. Platforms The station currently has five platforms in use. * Platform 1 is used for trains heading north to Blackburn and Clitheroe, and trains heading south to Manchester Victoria and . * Platform 2 is situated at the southern end of the station and allows for trains from the Manchester stations to terminate at Bolton. It is also used for stabling units from Manchester in the evening, and a couple of units use this platform in a morning. * Platform 3 is used for trains heading to Manchester Victoria, Manchester Piccadilly, Manchester Airport, Rochdale, Stockport and though it is also signalled for use by northbound trains to Blackburn. * Platform 4 is used for trains heading north and west including Wigan, Southport, Kirkby, Preston, Blackpool, Barrow-in-Furness, and Windermere. It was temporarily closed in the autumn of 2017 for refurbishment work, but is now operational again. * Platform 5 is used for trains to the same destinations as platform 4. In the early 1990s, Bolton's old Platform 5 was used for the Red Star Parcels service. This was separated from Platform 4 by a brick wall and the track had been concreted over to form a car park for passenger use. Parking facilities here were closed permanently on 24 January 2017.\\"Alterations to car parking at Bolton station as major investment work continues\\" Network Rail Media Centre article 10 January 2017; Retrieved 20 June 2017 The old platform 5 was rebuilt to increase capacity and opened on 6 September 2017. The work to install signals and overhead cables was completed in the autumn of 2018. Refurbishment In 2005 and 2006, part of the station and its surrounding area underwent major refurbishment. The walkway between the ticket office and platforms was modernised along with the station lifts and stairs. Bolton Interchange which serves as a direct connection between bus and rail to certain districts of Bolton was rebuilt, incorporating a taxi rank. The bridge connecting Newport Street with the rest of the town centre was also rebuilt, along with a large arch, which is clearly noticeable in the Bolton skyline. In 2006 a proposal to refurbish the station toilets, waiting rooms, ticket office and platforms was rejected due to lack of funds. In March 2010, GMPTE launched a consultation which proposed relocating Bolton bus station from Moor Lane to a new site adjacent to Bolton Interchange to improve connections between bus and train services. Refurbishment work on the ticket office, platforms and cafe commenced on 15 November 2010. The new interchange, built on land bounded by Newport Street and Great Moor Street, replaced the old Moor Lane bus station and provides vastly improved waiting areas, passenger facilities, information, safety and security. It directly connects bus and rail services via a Skylink pedestrian footbridge, improving transport links, as well as access to the town centre. The new interchange will offer enhanced accessibility with a modern concourse and passenger facilities including a retail outlet, cycle hub, shop mobility, caf√© and modern public toilets including adult and baby changing facilities. It will also make use of innovative sustainable energy initiatives, including rainwater recycling to flush the toilets, solar panels, air source heat pumps and low-energy LED lighting. The new transport interchange was delivered by Kier Construction for TfGM in partnership with Bolton Council. The ¬£48 million scheme was funded by the Greater Manchester Transport Fund and supports the Bolton Town Centre Transport Strategy and the wider town centre regeneration plans. Electrification From May 2015 until December 2015, to facilitate the electrification of the route from Manchester to Preston a reduced service pattern was in place as only one track through the Farnworth Tunnel could be used due to its re-boring to accommodate twin tracks. During this period, many TransPennine Express services were re-routed via Wigan North Western avoiding Bolton altogether. At the weekends train services between Manchester and Bolton were replaced by buses. In April 2016, in preparation for electrification, Orlando St. bridge was replaced, Soho St. bridge was demolished and track lowering took place in the Bullfield Tunnels area. Another 15 day blockade took place between 12‚Äì27 August 2017 to permit further work at the station, including the reinstatement of platform 5 (as noted), erecting a new footbridge, installation of overhead wiring and signalling upgrades.\\"REVEALED: Commuters face transport nightmare as Bolton train station shuts for TWO WEEKS in August\\" Holland, Daniel, Bolton News article 13 June 2017; Retrieved 20 June 2017 Buses replaced trains on most routes, with through services diverted via Atherton or Wigan North Western. The work was completed on schedule on 28 August, but the line towards Manchester remained closed following the work due to an embankment collapse and bridge damage at Moses Gate caused by a burst water main. As a result, the only service running was that to and from Blackburn, with other trains diverted away and replacement bus services to Manchester, Wigan and Preston in place.Emergency repairs to bridge means road and rail disruption in Bolton Network Rail Media Centre press release 25-08-17, Retrieved 29 August 2017 The line reopened to traffic on 6 September 2017 upon completion of the repairs to the bridge supports and embankment and normal working resumed on all routes. The electrification work at the station was due to be completed in time for the December 2017 timetable change, which would have seen a major revamp of the service pattern in operation. The work however fell well behind schedule, with Network Rail admitting in January 2018 that the work would not even be completed in time for the next timetable change in May. This was due to unexpected problems with poor ground conditions in several locations, which meant that some 200 masts for the overhead wires could not be installed as planned.First electric trains through Bolton delayed by a further SEVEN months Holland, Daniel, Bolton News article 11 January 2018; Retrieved 10 April 2018 In order to complete the remaining work by the end of the year (both piling for the masts and the actual wiring), further weekend blockades were imposed by Network Rail, which were expected to continue until November 2018 (along with a nine-day line closure in late August). The planned timetable revamp (including the return of Glasgow and Edinburgh trains and through services to south Manchester and Cheshire) have also had to be postponed until May 2019 as many of these improvements were dependent on the availability of electric rolling stock.

However, regular all-day Southport services were reintroduced in December 2019, with two trains per hour via Westhoughton and Wigan Wallgate replacing services that had previously only reached Wigan North Western. TransPennine Express provide an irregular service from Bolton, with 9 trains per weekday from Scotland (11 on Saturdays and 8 on Sundays) which call here towards Manchester on a \\"set-down only\\" basis, so passengers may alight at Bolton having travelled from stations further north but intending passengers are not permitted to join these trains. There are 6 northbound trains per day on weekdays with 4 trains to Edinburgh and 2 to Glasgow. On Saturdays, there are 6 trains to Edinburgh and 2 to Glasgow and on Sundays, 4 trains to Edinburgh and 5 trains to Glasgow. All other TransPennine Express services run non-stop through the station. Most routes usually have an hourly service on Sundays, but the delayed electrification work on the Manchester to Preston corridor saw these suspended and replaced by buses for much of 2017 and 2018. First TransPennine Express used to run the service from Manchester Airport to Blackpool North (and to Barrow & Windermere) but this was passed on to the new Northern franchise on 1 April 2016. Barrow and Windermere trains no longer call here since May 2019, running instead via Wigan (apart from one p.m peak service to Barrow). =Bus= Several bus companies provide a comprehensive route network of services around Bolton and the surrounding areas, with some subsidised on behalf of Transport for Greater Manchester: Arriva North West, Stagecoach Manchester, Stagecoach Merseyside & South Lancashire, Tyrers, Diamond Bus North West, Blackburn Bus Company, Vision Bus, and Rosso.

Gameplay  From the start the player chooses to be either a young male ronin named Kotaro or a teenage female ninja named Lin (Rin). From then on he or she travels through prerendered levels, killing enemies and fulfilling their mission. The game's combat system is quite detailed, and might take a while to get used to. However, when mastered, it is relatively easy for Lin and Kotaro to dispatch multiple enemies quickly from different directions, while simultaneously avoiding the enemies thrusts and swipes. There is a single attack button, but combined with different directional buttons pressed in different combinations and held down for various intervals. There are different attack speeds which correlate to the weight of the equipped weapon, and this is displayed on the sword's 'check' window (also displayed is the sword's length and sharpness, and a brief description of the blade).  Characters  Main characters: *Kotaro Hiba: Kotaro is a masterless samurai who travels Japan. Not much is known about his roots, other than he grew up in a dojo with a boy called Yukinosuke, training in the ways of Japanese swordsmanship. Both were apparently raised by their 'master', and Kotaro reveals his parents have already died. Yukinosuke reveals, that when growing up, they were both of equal skill, with neither ever able to clearly defeat the other in sparring contests. Kotaro left suddenly one day, after his parents died. He has a laid back attitude to life and does not sit in the traditional seiza sitting position in the dojo. *Lin (Rin): Lin is a ninja who was orphaned as a child. Both she and her brother, Shin were taken in by a ninja clan and trained in the art of ninjutsu until they were strong enough and skilled enough to carry out missions as a spy for the Tokugawa shogunate government. She resents the 'kid' image Kotaro uses on her, despite her youth. She has feelings for Kotaro, which is revealed at the game's end. Kotaro's Path bosses: * Unknown Ronin: The first boss in Kotaro's story, Kotaro finds the ronin killing a shogunate ninja (Genzo). This ronin has no other descriptions besides the scars on his face and completely white eyes. It is possible he is Sasaki Kojiro due to the fact that a long sword named Monohoshizao is obtained after defeating him, which was the name of the nodachi that Kojiro used in real life. * Muga: Muga is the high priest of the Temple. Due to his body being host to the horrific 'soul bugs', he has been transformed into a giant and bizarre monster. Muga surprises Kotaro in the Temple, having knocked Kurenai unconscious, saying she will make a fine gift to Lord Tohjo. When asked what Lord Tohjo has to do with anything, Muga tells Kotaro that it does not matter because he will die soon anyway. Before their battle begins, Muga cracks his knuckles, saying that he has been praying to test his new powers. He is the second boss in Kotaro's path. * Yukinosuke: Yukinosuke is Kotaro's childhood friend. Along with Kotaro he trained under his 'master' in kenjutsu, and could not best Kotaro, although Kotaro could not beat him either. He secretly harbours a deep feeling of resentment towards this fact, and strives for a way to defeat Kotaro (though not to kill him). Some time after Kotaro left, he turned to Lord Tohjo and he gave him a soul bug, giving him more power. Despite this, the soul bug has not deformed him like other hosts, and he despises the soul bug. * Urabe: A sorcerer who is enlisted to help in the creation and spread of the soul bugs. He has is a distinct boss due to the fact he does not wield a weapon or fight with his hands rather he attacks with a variety of magical spells. But after defeating him he transforms via the power of the soul bugs into a naked hunchback with an open spine that ends with a scorpion stinger and also gains the ability to breathe fire. He also has an electric left eye which may be the source of his power. * Miyamoto Musashi (optional boss): The only samurai (later revealed to be a ronin) who can wield two swords at once. He challenges Kotaro Hiba to a duel of honor at Ganryu Beach. If the player chooses to fight him he reveals he is not like the previous bosses faced, rather he is a ronin who just wants to fight Kotaro and he even goes to say that the events that are happening in the fiefdom \\"is of no concern to my swords\\". Defeating him earns a thanks before Musashi dies, as well as obtaining his two swords which can be equipped and used. These are the only swords in the game which can be used together in battle. The player must fight Musashi before fighting Yukinosuke, or he will get tired of waiting and leave. * Lord Tohjo: Lord Tohjo is the ruler of the village's fiefdom. He has contacted Urabe and enlisted his help to create the soul bugs for him. He is a master is s≈çjutsu (Japanese spear art) and possibly j≈´kend≈ç. Tohjo has unnatural power, and can heal himself using magic. After defeating him he too is revealed to have a soul bug which causes him to sprout arms which are electric in nature as well as deform himself in a way. This is where the game ends whether the player chooses Kotaro or Lin's path for the first time: the latter infected form can only be fought by playing through the second character's path via loading up the finished saved game. Lin's Path bosses: * Castle Head Guard: Lin finds Hanzo, a fellow shogunate ninja, dying from a wound inflicted by the Head Guard. The Guard then finds the two, and begins the battle with Lin. He is not alone in this boss battle as he calls upon his subordinates to come from every direction, however can be easily separated out among the other swordsmen as he is the only one wearing a blue outfit. He does not have any unblockable attacks. * Undead Genzo: In Kotaro's path, he is revealed to be killed by the Unknown Ronin. This fact is unknown to Lin who is happy to see her friend alive, but after he pulls his basket hat he is shown to be an undead who is bent on destroying Lin. * Karasu: A beautiful female ninja who is the head of a group of ninjas called Ravens. She is known for her skill in the art of ninjitsu as well as for her trademark battle dance. Defeating her engages the player in another boss battle where she is shown to be a soul bug's host, which of course allows her access to more powers. After her final defeat she reveals Lin's brother Shin is with Lord Tohjo; according to her \\"it will be a tearful reunion\\". Her name means \\"Crow\\" in Japanese. * The Three Wolverines: These are three Wolverine Ninja (named so because of their claw-like weapons) who are much more powerful than their normal counterparts. They are summoned to attack Lin by Oda, after her attempt to kill Lord Tohjo fails. Both Oda and Lord Tohjo then escape, leaving the three Wolverines to finish Lin. They attack very effectively as a team and even have teleport abilities. However, unlike many bosses, the Three Wolverines do not possess an unblockable attack. * Shin: Lin's elder brother appears also as a boss. True to Karasu's words it is a \\"tearful reunion\\" as Lin finds herself one on one with her brother, as he is infected with the soul bug which causes him to fight against his little sister. Very skilled fellow who has a good arsenal of fancy moves, he has an ability which allows him to send the shuriken acting like a boomerang. * Two Soul Worms: After killing the infected villagers Lin fights two huge worms who look like some amalgamation of the dead bodies. Although they burrow into the ground, these Soul Worms are very easy to defeat compared to many of the game's other bosses. * Infected Lord Tohjo: After meeting his apparent death by the hands of Kotaro Hiba. Tohjo reveals he too is infected with the soul bug and sprouts six arms while he exudes an unholy aura, He also has in each of his arms a weapon that corresponds to an earlier boss that Lin have faced. Note: he can only be fought by playing through a finished savegame with one character's path already finished. By loading the savegame and picking the second character's path, they will encounter the final bosses. It is up to the second character to send him back to Hell. * Ryu Oda: Ryu Oda is a \\"military scholar\\" according to Kotaro Hiba and is also the main villain behind the soul bugs and the plan of conquering feudal Japan. He remains behind the scenes only appearing every now and then to some of the soul bug hosts as in the case of Yukinosuke and Urabe. He can be fought by either Kotaro or Lin, depending on which character was picked as the second path in a savegame where one character's path is already finished. * Infected Ryu Oda: Ryu Oda shows to the reunited Lin and Kotaro that he is not only infected with the soul bugs but has also become the nest for them. After revealing his plans he mutates into a hideous multi-faced monster. Once Infected Lord Tohjo is defeated with the second character, the player will be given the option to fight this final boss with either Lin and Kotaro. After defeating Ryu Oda and saving feudal Japan from the soul bugs, both Kotaro and Lin perform their final duties to their fallen friend and brother respectively, and in the end decide to stay with each other. Development An early version of the game, developed under the working title Shogun Assassin, featured young warriors named Hotaru and Hyaku, members of the shogunate secret police (their designs were the same as those of the final protagonists Kotaro and Lin). Earlier, the game was also known as Japan and Konami sources said the game would combine elements from Bushido Blade and Tenchu. Reception The game received \\"mixed\\" reviews according to video game review aggregator GameRankings. According to a positive review in GamePro, Soul of the Samurai delivered \\"lively action melded to a compelling story line.\\" On the other hand, GameSpot's review stated that \\"those looking for a ninja game of Tenchu's caliber will unfortunately have to keep on looking.\\" References External links * Category:1999 video games Category:Action-adventure games Category:Konami games Category:Video games about ninja Category:PlayStation (console)-only games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games featuring female protagonists Category:Video games set in feudal Japan Category:PlayStation (console) games ","title":"Soul of the Samurai"},{"id":"2590416","text":"Farnworth railway station serves the Greater Manchester town of Farnworth, in the Metropolitan Borough of Bolton, England.

Outside of these times, tickets must be purchased on the train or prior to travel. Step-free access to both platforms is via ramps from the station entrance.Farnworth station facilities National Rail Enquiries; Retrieved 9 December 2016 History The station was first opened by the Manchester, Bolton and Bury Railway on 29 May 1838, and was originally named Tunnel. This station closed in 1841, but was reopened in September 1845, when it took the name of Halshaw Moor. In May 1852 it was renamed Halshaw Moor and Farnworth; in January 1870 Farnworth and Halshaw Moor; and finally on 6 May 1974 it became Farnworth. =Farnworth Tunnel= The north-west ends of Farnworth tunnel, prior to the 2015 reconstruction. Original tunnel (re-bored in 2015) on left; additional smaller bore of 1880 on right. To the south-east of the station is Farnworth Tunnel, which had two single-track bores, although when built it had one double-track bore. Originally there was intended to be a cutting, but a tunnel was substituted. This was dug from both ends and also from a shaft at the centre; the main difficulty in construction being the nature of the ground, which consisted of wet sand and clay. It is long, although Network Rail has erected tunnel entrance nameboards that incorrectly read 294 yds. The Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (L&YR;) route north from to was completed on 1 June 1880, and the Midland Railway (MR) proposed to use this route for a through service between and Scotland. The MR intended to use Pullman cars, which were larger than the L&YR; coaches, and it was found that some of the tunnels on the route were too small and would need to be enlarged. Among these was Farnworth tunnel, which was also in need of extensive repairs; so instead of enlarging it, it was decided to build a second tunnel alongside. The present down (northbound) single-line tunnel was commenced on 26 April 1880 and brought into use on 5 December that year, although Parliamentary approval for its construction had not been obtained: it was applied for in February 1881 and granted retrospectively (as part of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Act 1881, 44 & 45 Vic chapter 135) on 18 July that year. Once it was in use, the two tracks through the original tunnel were replaced by a single track along the centre; the tunnel lining was repaired and thickened, and this tunnel then formed the up (southbound) single-line tunnel. As part of the forthcoming electrification scheme, the original tunnel has been enlarged to allow sufficient clearance for the overhead wires and for both lines to be routed through it once again.\\"Powering Ahead\\" Railway Strategies article 25-03-2014; Retrieved 2014-09-06 During this period, the 1880 bore was initially retained to permit a limited diesel service over the route to continue during the upgrade work, and after was then abandoned as clearances within are too restricted to allow safe operation with overhead wires. This has also required realignment of the lines approaching it and consequent alterations to the platforms that they serve.Pictured: Massive machine that will bore tunnel under A666 as railway is electrified Robertson, N; Bolton News article; Retrieved 12 March 2015 Work began in May 2015, when the 1838 bore was closed, filled in with cement and re-bored to a larger diameter using the largest tunnel boring machine ever built in Britain.

The chapel was originally constructed as a barque shrine during the reign of Hatshepsut. She was the fifth pharaoh of the Eighteenth Dynasty from approximately 1479 to 1458 BC. It was demolished in antiquity and its parts reused in other projects. However, following its rediscovery in modern time, the Chapel was reconstructed in 1997 using its original materials. The chapel's original location may have been in the central court of the temple of Amun at Karnak, near Thebes. Alternatively, it might have been situated between the two obelisks of Hatshepsut. It is also thought that Hatshepsut erected several smaller chapels and the Chambers of Hatshepsut behind the chapel.  Background  Ancient Egyptians believed that a sacred barque was used in a nightly journey of the sun deity, traveling from the western horizon at sunset behind the earth to the eastern horizon where the sunrise would occur. During the early eighteenth dynasty, the sun deity was Amun. During religious ceremonies the deity would be transported from one temple or section of a temple complex to another in a model which the pharaoh and other religious leaders kept for such religious ceremonies. The chapel would have been its sacred temple. A 3D model of the Chapelle rouge in Second LifeVisit the model in Second Life A barque also was believed to transport the dead to the afterlife and royal ones would carry the pharaoh on a journey to become a deity. Eventually, in addition to the reliefs and paintings of barques, model copies were placed in the tombs of pharaohs, royalty, and all who could afford to provide one for their burial. The chapel consists of two open courts and is approximately 18 metres long, 6 m wide, and 5.5 m high. Its upper portion is made of red quartzite (hence the name); the foundation is built of black diorite. Black granite and grey diorite also were used in its construction. In the center of the first of three courts contained in the chapel, is a basin, probably used to hold a model of a barque. In the center of the inner court, two rectangular stone slabs mark places where statues or barques might have been placed. The chapel was erected at the temple of Karnak in the sanctuary of Amun-Ra and placed immediately in front of a mud-brick and limestone temple remaining from the Middle Kingdom. To the north and south of the Chapel stood a collection of smaller sandstone cult shrines known as the Hatshepsut Suite, whose decorations showed Hatshepsut making offerings to the deities. The chapel consisted of two rooms, a vestibule, and a sanctuary, which were raised on a diorite platform and could be accessed using short ramps on either side. The purpose of the chapel was to house the Userhat-Amun, the barque believed to be used by the deity Amun to travel about on festival days. The Userhat- Amun was a small-scale wooden boat covered in gold that bore an enclosed shrine in which the Amun statue was placed to be protected from the public view. On holy days, the statue of Amun would be placed on the barque and carried in procession from Karnak on the shoulders of priests. When the statue of Amun was not traveling, however, the barque rested in its own shrine. During the early New Kingdom, the barque had become an increasingly important aspect of Egyptian theology and barque shrines were built for many temples. During the reign of Hatshepsut, the Chapel was the prominent barque shrine of Amun at Karnak. The structure, decoration, and complex history of the Chapel divulge secrets about the reign of Hatshepsut and the Egypt of the eighteenth dynasty. Construction of the shrine Almost all of the New Kingdom rulers built at Karnak. Successive pharaohs added various structures in order to leave a lasting monument at the temple. Although Hatshepsut made many contributions to Karnak, one of her largest was the chapel. Hatshepsut began construction on the chapel in the seventeenth year of her reign. The chapel was placed within the Palace of Ma‚Äôat, the sanctuary constructed for Karnak by Hatshepsut honoring one of the oldest of deities. There is some debate, however, over whether or not the sanctuary had to be modified to accommodate the chapel. Because the space where the chapel was thought to stand once was occupied by a suite of three rooms that were built around the same time as the Chapel, Hatshepsut may have built the walls and then had them torn down immediately to make room for the introduction of the chapel. It is probable that Hatshepsut did not complete the decoration of the chapel before her death because the upper blocks show only Thutmose III, her successor, and the upper registers of the southern outer wall bear a dedication inscription with his name alone. These signs imply that he had become the pharaoh by that time. Detail of the Red Chapel showing Thutmose III following Hatshepsut and restoration work Decoration Thutmose III had been the co-regent of Hatshepsut--the royal wife to his father and thereby his aunt and \\"stepmother\\" --who became pharaoh during his youth and ruled until her death. Thutmose III married the daughter of Hatshepsut, Neferure, to continue the royal lineage, but she and their offspring failed to survive his reign. During the majority of Thutmose's reign as pharaoh, none of the construction by Hatshepsut was harmed, and in fact, he continued to enhance this structure. The destruction of the works of Hatshepsut seems to have begun after his remaining son (of a non-royal wife) became co-regent to him in his old age. Some of these blocks were reused immediately in the shrine of Amun that was erected in the heart of Karnak temple. Much of the chapel was covered in relief and inscriptions describing the events that occurred during the reign of Hatshepsut. Some of the relief on the shrine depicts priests carrying the barque of Amun through the temples and streets of Thebes during religious festivals. Some of the blocks show Hatshepsut in the royal garb, running with the Apis bull between the markers of her Heb-Sed festival. The blocks of the building have been catalogued and numbered. Decorations on the Red Chapel may help archeologists pinpoint the coronation date of Hatshepsut: one text inscribed on Block 287, on the outside wall of the chapel, hints that Hatshepsut was named pharaoh in the second year of an unnamed king's reign. This text, narrated by Hatshepsut, describes a religious procession associated with the Opet Festival. During the ceremony, in the presence of this anonymous ruler, an oracle speaking the words of Amun makes the announcement that Hatshepsut is to become the pharaoh. It is unclear, however, who the unnamed king is. One argument is that it is Thutmose I, her father, and that the text represents Hatshepsut's recollection of a time during her father's reign when she was acknowledged as the true heir to the throne. If this interpretation is correct, when Hatshepsut was crowned remains uncertain. If the unnamed ruler is Thutmose III, however, the inscription might be a record of the date when Hatshepsut was declared pharaoh. Block 287 of the chapel does not go on to describe the coronation of Hatshepsut. He was a child when his father, Thutmose II, died and his mother was not his father's royal wife, Hatshepsut, but a secondary wife outside of the royal lineage. Hatshepsut and her royal daughter by Thutmouse II already held important positions in the religious and political administrations of the country. Another block on the opposite outer wall of the chapel, far from block 287, however, contains a third person narrative revealing the details of the coronation. Based on the presumed position on the chapel of the third block, far from block 287, it is possible that her coronation occurred much later than the events on block 287. Today, archaeologists hope that finding one of the missing blocks of the Chapel will help solve this mystery. Another scene shows a pharaoh offering incense before two pavilions, each of which holds a sacred barque and shrine. On each side of the three shrines pictured, stand two statues of Hatshepsut in the form of Osiris. Later in the scene, the pharaoh steers a boat toward Deir el-Bahri. One interpretation of this relief is that the king is the living Thutmose III, and that by steering a barque containing the sacred emblems of Hatshepsut toward the site of her mortuary temple, he is officiating her movement into the realm of becoming a deity. If this interpretation is correct, the relief probably was carved under the auspices of Thutmose III after the death of Hatshepsut. Other archaeologists, however, have hypothesized that the pharaoh driving the boat is Hatshepsut. This interpretation makes sense, as the inscription bears the words ‚ÄúThe Good God, Lady of the Two Lands, Daughter of Re, Hatshepsut,‚Äù and the pharaoh is pictured making offerings to Amun. Because it seems that Hatshepsut is making the offerings before the Chapel, it can be presumed that there were two mummiform, Osirian statues of Hatshepsut at the entrance, one standing on either side of the shrine when it was built. Some blocks from the Chapel are decorated with three sets of scenes in which an unnamed God‚Äôs Wife of Amun is shown performing her duties. Because of the time period at which the chapel was built, it is likely that this God's Wife is Neferure, the daughter of Hatshepsut and Thutmose II. These scenes make clear that as God's Wife she had an important role in the temple and had to be present at the rituals performed there. These are duties that the royal queen would have performed if her husband were pharaoh. Since Hatshepsut was pharaoh, it is thought that her daughter assumed the role for her mother. One block shows the God's Wife and a priest performing a ritualistic burning of the names of Egypt's enemies in an attempt to destroy them. Another depicts the God's Wife watching Hatshepsut present dinner to the seventeen deities of Karnak. Yet another shows the God's Wife, as chief priestess, leading a group of male priests to the temple pool to be purified and then following Hatshepsut into the shrine in which she performed sacred rites in front of the statue of Amun. Because of these carvings on the walls of the Red Chapel, archeologists have been given an insight to the active role the God's Wife of Amun played in religious practices. One relief carved in the blocks on the exterior sides of the chapel tells the story of an expedition to Aswan. Men were sent out by Hatshepsut to collect stone from the quarry there to bring back to Karnak. Reliefs depict the cutting out, moving, and erecting of obelisks. Archeologists have learned how obelisks were transported in Egypt from these carvings. Two obelisks are shown tied to sledges and towed on a sycamore wood barge toward Thebes by a fleet of twenty-seven boats powered by eight hundred and fifty oarsmen. The larger of the obelisks commemorated Hatshepsut's Sed festival, which occurred at approximately the same time as the Chapel was built in the sixteenth year of her reign. Hatshepsut then is depicted presenting the obelisks as a dedication to Amun. Because it is known that Hatshepsut built the obelisks of the Wadjet Hall, the Palace of Ma‚Äôat, and the Eighth Pylon, among others, it has been presumed that the scenes on the Chapel show the creation and erection of some of these monuments. In the text that accompanies the relief, Hatshepsut asserts that her divine father, Amun, came to her and told her to raise the obelisks in dedication to him. Along with these reliefs, the exterior fa√ßade of the Chapel was decorated with the parallel scenes of receiving the crowns of Hatshepsut and of Thutmose III. Shown with the same pointed nose that was characteristic of depictions of Hatshepsut, Thutmose III also is pictured participating in the processions of the Beautiful Feast of the Valley and the Opet Festival. On the interior, however, Hatshepsut is the only ruler depicted. Representations of Thutmose III sometimes are accompanied by feminine pronouns and he is shown twice walking alongside Hatshepsut's soul, her ka. Thutmose III's mortuary temple also is depicted on the wall of the Chapel, providing evidence that the mortuary temple was built as early as the period of his co-regency with Hatshepsut. The lower base of the chapel was decorated with knotted plant-forms and kneeling Nile deities and female figures. Destruction After the pharaoh's death, Hatshepsut's Chapel was dismantled during the reign of Thutmose III. It originally was thought that the destruction of the chapel was part of the proscription of Hatshepsut that occurred beginning in year 42 of Thutmose III's reign. This was when he was an old man and during a co-regency with his son from a minor wife. That son would become Amenhotep II. New research has shown evidence of additions to the top blocks of the shrine that show Thutmouse III without Hatshepsut and claiming the chapel as his own. This would imply that it was a completion of the chapel, that was unfinished after her death without any disturbance of the work completed by Hatshepsut. Yet after his year 42--during his next co- regency with his son--Thutmose III's own building projects at Karnak such as the Hall of Annals deliberately conceal inscriptions and decoration relating to Hatshepsut and many decorations of Hatshepsut were erased. The blocks that have been found from the Chapel, however, show some random and incomplete erasures. Many of the blocks have no erasures on multiple sides. This phenomenon has caused some archeologists to believe that the attacks against the images of Hatshepsut occurred after the Red Chapel had been deconstructed and the blocks had been stacked so that they could be reused in other building projects. Speculation exists that the workmen involved in the proscription did not take the time to examine every surface of the blocks when erasing, but just did away with all of the visible references to Hatshepsut on the surface they would display. Many surfaces would not have been visible in the new use, being interior to new walls. This led to the preservation of the original carvings that became interior parts of new walls. If this were true, it might mean that the Chapel was demolished before the proscription began, and that tearing it down was not part of Thutmose's attempt to persecute Hatshepsut's memory, but was justified as required for the practical purpose of making room for the larger barque shrine that he intended to put in the Red Chapel's place. A similarly shaped granite barque shrine was constructed around year 46 of his reign during the co-regency with his son. It was covered with images of Amun that later were removed during the Amarna period by Akhenaten, another pharaoh who disdained the deity and the powerful priesthood that ran the country through the temple of Amun in Thebes. Except for the lack of need because of new placement that hid surfaces, the theory that the Chapel was not demolished maliciously also may be supported by the fact that Thutmose III and his son did not force the reliefs of Hatshepsut to be re-carved as were many of the other monuments. The erasure of Hatshepsut reliefs from buildings usually occurred in three stages. The first was hacking the old image out with a chisel. Then, a fine implement was used to smooth the rough surface and remove the raised ridges. Finally, the wall was polished and carved anew. Because the sporadic cartouches and figures of Hatshepsut that were touched merely were removed and not replaced--aside from one cartouche on block 24 that was exchanged with the cartouche of Thutmose III‚Äôs nephew--it may be deduced that the erasures occurred after the shrine had been dismantled. As discussed at her article, his nephew is suspected of the greater destruction of the Hatshepsut works by some archeologists. After it had been deconstructed, parts of the Red Chapel were used in the later building projects of other pharaohs at Karnak. The two black granite doorways of the chapel were placed in the main door to Thutmose III's north suite at the Palace of Ma‚Äôat and the door leading into the southern columned court in the Sixth Pylon. Amenhotep III also used some of the blocks from the Chapel in the construction of the Third Pylon, much later in the eighteenth dynasty. The remaining blocks ended up being used in other monuments built at Karnak, for example in the foundation of the temple of Ptah, in the Ninth Pylon. Reconstruction Many of the blocks from the disassembled Chapel were rediscovered in the 1950s inside the walls of other structures. A reconstruction model of how the chapel probably looked during Hatshepsut's reign was completed in 1997 by a group of French and Egyptian restoration experts. Today, over three hundred blocks from the chapel are displayed in their original context at the Open-Air Museum of Karnak.

Some are designed to be stackable. Stillages are mainly used to transport goods without the need to load and unload the product being carried, which saves time and decreases the chance of damage. An example is the use of stillages in the glass industry, where they are shaped like an upright \\"A\\"; the glass leans inward and is strapped to the stillage ready for transport. Beverage and alcohol industry A stillage, consisting of metal racking, at University of Warwick's annual student beer festival. A stillage is any device on which a cask of ale is placed for service. Unlike kegs, which can be simply stood upright on the floor, casks are used lying on their sides. This allows the beer to run from the tap under gravity, with room in the \\"belly\\" of the cask below the outlet for the finings to collect. The shive with the spile will then be the highest point on the cask. As the beer clears (see finings), the inside of the cask becomes coated with sediment. It is important that the stillage holds the cask absolutely still with no rocking or shaking, otherwise the sediment will be shaken into suspension and the beer will be cloudy. A stillage need not be complicated - anything that will support a cask (preferably on three points to avoid any wobbling) will do. At temporary events, sturdy tables or frames made of scaffolding and planks might be used, with the casks placed on wooden wedges (two at the front, one at the back). At the other end of the scale, many pub cellars use specially-made steel racking, often with two rows of casks one above the other. Some pubs have brick or stone stillages, sometimes quite ancient, built into the wall of the cellar. As the cask empties, it needs to be gently tilted to obtain the last of the beer. With wooden wedges, moving the rear wedge forward will achieve this; purpose-built metal units often have springs incorporated that automatically tilt the cask as it becomes lighter. This requires less effort from bar staff, and also helps beer quality - the lift is so smooth and gradual that there is no danger of stirring up the lees and making the beer cloudy.

The Amakasu Incident (Amakasu jiken) was the murder of two prominent Japanese anarchists and a young boy by military police, led by Lieutenant Amakasu Masahiko, in September 1923. The victims were ≈åsugi Sakae, an informal leader of the Japanese anarchist movement, together with the anarcha-feminist It≈ç Noe (his wife), and ≈åsugi's child nephew. Following the devastating Great Kant≈ç earthquake in early September 1923, Japanese authorities massacred dissidents and ethnic Koreans in the Kant≈ç Massacre in the subsequent chaos. It≈ç, ≈åsugi, and his nephew were arrested on the 16th September. According to writer and activist Harumi Setouchi, It≈ç, ≈åsugi, and his 6 year old nephew were arrested, beaten to death and thrown into an abandoned well by a squad of military police led by Lieutenant Masahiko Amakasu. According to literary scholar Patricia Morley, It≈ç and ≈åsugi were strangled in their cells. What both accounts agree on, however, is that both or all of the prisoners were brutally executed without even the formality of a trial, where conviction and death sentence would in the case of the two adults have probably been a foregone conclusion. This became known as the Amakasu Incident and it sparked much anger. The historian John Crump argued that \\"once again, the most able anarchist of his generation had been murdered,\\" echoing the High Treason Incident just twelve years prior. Following nationwide outcry, Amakasu was court-martialed and sentenced to 10 years in prison. When Hirohito became Emperor of Japan three years later, Amakasu was released. He studied in France and became a special agent for the Imperial Japanese Army in Manchuria. When Japan surrendered in August 1945 he killed himself with potassium cyanide.

Ahearn, a native of Ottawa, Ontario, was instrumental in the success of a vast streetcar system that was once in Ottawa, the Ottawa Electric Railway, and was the first chairman of Canada's Federal District Commission in 1927. He held several patents related to electrical items and headed companies which competed for decades with Ottawa Hydro as providers for electricity in Ottawa. Ahearn co-founded the Ottawa Car Company, a manufacturer of streetcars for Canadian markets. Life and career He was born in the Lebreton Flats area of Ottawa in 1855. He started as a messenger in the Chaudi√®re office of the Montreal Telegraph Company (located in J. R. Booth's office). Within the year he was promoted to the company's Sparks Street office. At 19, he went to New York City and worked for two years at Western Union Telegraph Company. He returned to Ottawa and became chief operator for Montreal Telegraph Company. He became a manager of the Bell Telephone Company office in Ottawa in 1880. In 1881, he founded the firm of Ahearn & Soper, electrical contractors, with Warren Soper, former manager of Dominion Telegraph Company's local office. He formed Chaudi√®re Electric Light and Power Company in 1887 and he later merged it with other companies which created the Ottawa Electric Company in 1894. In 1892, he filed patents for both an \\"electric oven\\" and a \\"system of warming cars by means of electrically heated water\\". The use of this invention that year to prepare a meal which he delivered by streetcar to the Windsor Hotel caused the Ottawa Journal to say \\"...everything had been cooked by electricity, the first instance on record...\\" Thomas Ahearn filed eleven Canadian patents in all. He was founder and president of the Ottawa Electric Railway Company, which provided electric streetcar service in the city and had the first streetcars with electric heaters (a device he patented). After running as a vast and very successful private operation for over half a century, it was later taken over by the Ottawa Transportation Commission. He, with Ahearn and William Wylie in September 1893, founded the Ottawa Car Manufacturing Company which manufactured streetcars. In 1901, the Ottawa Electric Railway Company built a 2000-foot canal just north of the Britannia Boathouse Club to generate Hydroelectric power on the Desch√™nes Rapids. Although the hydroelectric project was abandoned as unfeasible, the unfinished canal was used in 1951 as the basis of the Britannia Yacht Club\`s main and inner harbour, which provide 250 wet moorings, fuel and pumpout facilities, for both sail and power boats. In 1905-6, he built a new clubhouse, known as the Britannia Boating Club House. After the new clubhouse, which was designed by Charles Penruddocke William Kivas Band, was destroyed by fire on August 29, 1919, the Club returned to its present location, in a building designed by Edgar Lewis Horwood.http://dictionaryofarchitectsincanada.org/architects/view/1030 Charles Penruddocke William Kivas Band in Dictionary of Architects in Canada On June 23, 1906, he was appointed as director and elected president of Ottawa Gas Company. In 1908, he formed a holding company called the Ottawa Light, Heat and Power Company, Limited, which wholly owned Ottawa Gas Company (which Ahearn & Soper bought) and Ottawa Electric Company. In this way, the private sector continued to compete with Ottawa Hydro for decades. In 1927, he was placed by Prime Minister MacKenzie King as the first chairman of the Federal District Commission, the predecessor to the National Capital Commission. There he had a five-year term ending in 1932. In this capacity, much of Ottawa's parkway network was developed, as well as the Champlain Bridge across the Ottawa River.

Ahearn & Soper Ahearn & Soper is an Ottawa company formed as an electrical engineering and contracting business in 1881 by Thomas Ahearn and Warren Young Soper, former manager of Dominion Telegraph Company's local office. Both men were working for Montreal Telegraph in Ottawa on March 13, 1873. The two founders were responsible for the creation of many companies in the fields of communications, heat, light and power, including the Ottawa Electric Railway Company and early electricity providers in Ottawa.http://www.ahearn.com/english/contact/history.html Their principal contracts have been with the Canadian Pacific Railway, Bell Telephone Company, Mackay-Bennett Cable Company of New York, and the North American Telegraph Company. In the mid-1890s, they moved to 56 Sparks Street from 70 Sparks Street. In 1926, they built the Ottawa Electric Building (Albert Ewan, Architect) which still stands on 56 Sparks. The company, Ahearn & Soper Inc. still exists today and provides solutions for Warehouse Automation, Manufacturing Automation, Printing Automation and ID & Security Solutions. Family Mrs. Margaret Ahearn by William James Topley c. 1900 Thomas Ahearn's first marriage was to Lilias Mackay Fleck. In 1892, in his second marriage, he married Margaret Howitt (likely Margaret Howit Fleck). Margaret was the daughter of Alexander Fleck, President of the Vulcan Iron Works Co., Ottawa, and his wife, Lilias Walker. Margaret was born in Montreal, and was educated at the McGill Model School and at Bute House. The couple travelled in foreign countries with their family. She served as the President of the Victorian Order of Nurses. She was identified with the Local Council of Women, and the Woman's Canadian Historical Society. The couple lived at Buena Vista, 584 Maria Street, Ottawa. Thomas Ahearn's son Frank would become the owner of the Ottawa Auditorium and the Ottawa Senators professional ice hockey team.

It is part of the Manchester station group. It is linked to Deansgate-Castlefield tram stop and the Manchester Central Convention Complex by a footbridge built in 1985; Deansgate Locks, The Great Northern Warehouse and the Museum of Science and Industry are also nearby. The platforms are elevated, reached by lift or stairs, or by the walkway from the Manchester Central Complex. The ticket office, staffed full-time, is between street and platform levels. There are no ticket barriers, although manual ticket checks take place on a daily basis. It is on the Manchester to Preston and the Liverpool to Manchester lines, both heavily used by commuters. Most tickets purchased by passengers to Deansgate are issued to Manchester Stations or Manchester Central Zone, therefore actual usage is not reflected in these statistics, due to the difficulty in splitting the ticket sales correctly between the four grouped stations (Piccadilly, Victoria, Oxford Road and Deansgate). History The original station buildings were situated on Hewitt Street. The station was opened as Knot Mill and Deansgate on 20 July 1849 by the Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway (MSJAR) near the Manchester terminus ('the Knot Mill station'(advert.)) of the Bridgewater Canal from which in 1849 travellers could catch a fast packet which could get them to Liverpool in four and a half hours for as little as sixpence.(advert.) (The fare was anomalously low because of a temporary outbreak of competition between the canal and the London and North Western Railway (L&NWR;); it was back up to sixteen pence by 1853).(advert.) When a celebratory train ran over the line at the start of July 1849, a reporter for the Manchester Courier noted that most stations had permanent buildings and \\"at Knott Mill and Oxford-street temporary stations will in the meantime be erected\\". When the line opened for passenger traffic a fortnight later, the Courier duly noted that the station at Knott Mill had opened with temporary wooden buildings. The booking office was at street level; from it \\"narrow, steep, troublesome steps, enough to tire anyone but athletes\\" led to the platforms. The station proved - according to its critics -to be \\"inconvenient of approach, ugly in appearance, and with platform, booking office, and waiting-room accommodation much cramped\\" but accessibility was the biggest issue: for the aged, the invalid or children it was \\"a most difficult not to say dangerous task to climb the steep flights of steps to the platforms.\\" (The area was also the site of the annual Easter-tide Knott Mill Fair, which noted the absence of Wombwell's a decades- old event, which (until its abolition in 1876)(advert.) hosted acts such as Pablo Fanque's Circus Royal and George Wombwell's Menagerie.Gretchen Holrook Gerzina, Editor, \\"Black Victorians-Black Victoriana\\" (Rutgers University Press: New Brunswick, NJ, 2003) In 1860, special trains laid on in connection with the fair by both the L&NWR; and the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (MS&LR;), the joint owners of the MSJAR were not advertised as running to Knott Mill station; the LNWR excursion ran to Ordsall Lane,(advert.) the MS&L; excursion to London Road (now Piccadilly station).(advert.) ) If the station was originally named \\"Knot Mill and Deansgate\\" by the MSJAR, from its opening onwards it was simply 'Knott Mill' (or 'Knot Mill') to the Manchester papers and by 1860 the railway was following suit in its advertisements.(advert.) (advert.) In 1864, the MS&LR; gave the required notice of a bill to be brought forward in the next session of Parliament for widening part of the MSJAR \\"from or near Knott Mill Station to Old Trafford Station\\"; however in the same year the accident return for an accident at Old Trafford noted that the train involved had stopped at \\"Knot Mill, and left that station...\\" Following the widening and improvement of the southern portion of Deansgate, in 1880 a correspondent to the Manchester Courier suggested that the station be renamed Deansgate \\"Very few lady passengers who have shopping to do in Deansgate make use of the Knot Mill Station. If they are aware of its nearness, perhaps they are waiting for the station and its approaches to be improved\\" A public meeting in October 1884 complained that Knott Mill station was altogether inadequate for the newly improved district; the MSJAR was therefore in breach of its Act of Parliament which required it to provide sufficient station accommodation: the Improvement Committee of Manchester Corporation was called upon to exert pressure on the MSJAR. A deputation from the Improvement Committee duly met directors of the railway to urge them to improve the \\"dingy\\" and \\"long-neglected\\" station. Improvement plans were drawn up but an impasse was reached; the MSJAR's joint owners (the L&NWR; and the MS&LR;) disagreed on how much they should spend on improvement and Manchester Corporation were unhappy with any narrowing of adjacent streets to accommodate an enlarged station.as noted (for example) in Not until 1892 was a plan devised that was acceptable to all of the interested parties. Negotiations to purchase the required land were protracted, with Manchester Corporation eventually offering to exercise its powers of compulsory purchase to assist the railway, but the work finally went out for tender in January 1895.(advert.) Work started in March 1895 (by June 1895 a temporary entrance from Gaythorn Street had to be used and the previous entrance from Deansgate closed);(advert.) it was completed in September 1896; the latter year appears (in a shield) as part of the decorative stonework over the entrance. The station name is given there as simply \\"Knott Mill Station\\". The station is now a Grade II listed building.\\"Whitworth Street West - Deansgate Railway Station. Grade II. 20.8.98\\" Its battlemented architectural feature, visible at its corner, is intended to mirror similar features in the nearby viaducts, all of which in turn incorporated the design in recognition of the Roman fort that once stood in the Castlefield area. The station became Knott Mill and Deansgate (for railway purposes: to the local press it remained Knott Mill station) around 1900 and Deansgate on 3 May 1971. Today it is sometimes known as Manchester Deansgate, and on many station information boards it is Deansgate G-Mex.

In his review of the second season, while Morton stated that it was as enjoyable as the first, he was more critical of it. Several criticisms were drawn to Tsutomu and his friends being more sidelined in the story, and the animation, which he pointed out as, \\"...appearing to have been animated on a shoestring budget.\\". Bob Muir, from Japanator, noted the ending for the show made it feel rushed, but overall recommended the series, calling it \\"...just plain fun, with no insipid moe characters or deathly serious world domination plots to drag it down.\\" Josh Viel of the Escapist, praised the visuals and soundtrack of the first season, bringing particular mention to the show's use of foreshadowing. On DVDTalk, Todd Douglass Jr. commended both seasons for their character development, though criticized the pacing of the first season, as well as the antagonists, calling one of them, \\"... more of a Cigarette Smoking Man kind of guy and really seems to just be some shadowy figure doing what he wants to do in the sidelines.\\". Further points were directed toward the second season for having the same issues, yet still recommended the series as a whole. Legacy Zack Snyder said the anime was an inspiration for his take on Man of Steel.

Set in the future, the player takes part in stunt-filled hoverboard races through London, Tokyo, and Manhattan, or inside a massive arena called the Velodrome. AirBlade by Criterion and Namco is a spiritual successor. The game received mixed reviews from critics, who praised its graphics and physics, but criticized its gameplay, animations and sound.  Gameplay  The game initially allows the player to choose a racer and places them in the Velodrome. From there, they can enter different rooms to decide their next challenge. The player can either challenge the Velodrome trainer to unlock new tricks, or race to unlock new areas and hoverboards. For the challenges, the player must pass through a series of gates before time expires. For racing, the player progresses through tracks on 3 different continents, the US, UK, and Japan. Once all five races on each continent are complete, the player unlocks a \\"boss race\\" which unlocks a new hoverboard. There are a total of 18 tracks in the game, with 4 of them being backward versions of existing tracks. During races, the player can perform skateboard and snowboard-like tricks, like grinding on a rail, or spinning in midair, in order to get additional points. If playing a \\"bully\\" character, they can also collide with other racers to slow them down, or if not, must avoid being hit by AI racers. A VMU game called TrickStyle Jr. was included with the title, and plays in a similar manner to Snake.  Development  TrickStyle's soundtrack was composed by hip-hop producer Kurtis Mantronik. The game was successfully ported to PS2 in 2000, a demo of which was shown at GDC, but it was ultimately never released on the system. The game was re-released by its current owners, Throwback Entertainment, on GOG.com on December 29, 2015, and on Steam on February 21, 2017. iOS 10 Stickers for iMessage were released on October 11, 2016. Reception TrickStyle received mixed reviews on both platforms according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. Jeffery Adam Young of NextGen called the Dreamcast version \\"an impressive game to watch, and an infuriating game to play. Track design is sadistic, and AI players are inhumanly adept. Good mostly for increasing your stress level.\\" Brandon Justice of IGN said that the same console version \\"sports the best art direction I've ever seen in a console racer\\", and compared the game to Wipeout, although saying it lacked the sense of speed to surpass that series. While calling the game's lack of extras a \\"letdown\\", he states that he had a \\"great time\\" with the game and that it would \\"go a long way towards opening your eyes to the possibilities of racing on the Dreamcast.\\" Tal Blevins of the same site praised the PC version's \\"stunning visuals and incredibly fluid gameplay\\", but called the soundtrack repetitive and stated that he quickly turned off the music. He also stated that the game was \\"screaming for\\" an option to play online against other players rather than just local multiplayer. Ben Stahl of GameSpot said the Dreamcast version was \\"too easy to beat\\", and called the sound effects annoying while praising the music. He praised the \\"accurate\\" hoverboard physics, but called the character animations \\"inhuman\\". Calling it \\"perfect-for-a-rental\\", he nevertheless stated that the graphics were the only thing \\"great\\" about the title. Geoff Richards of Eurogamer criticized the PC version as a \\"direct port\\" with a \\"too-easy\\" difficulty, but calling its visuals \\"stunning\\". J.C. Herz of The New York Times called TrickStyle the only racing game on Dreamcast that \\"inspires hardware lust\\", calling its hoverboard physics \\"dreamy\\" and its visuals \\"razor sharp and achingly hip\\". In a 2009 retrospective, Eurogamer called the game a cult classic, saying that the game was \\"overlooked\\" in favor of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater.

History =Ancient and Medieval eras= Town square The city was founded by the Nabataeans as Suada. It became known as Dionysias Soada () in the Hellenistic period and the Roman Empire, for the god Dionysus, patron of wine - the city is situated in a famous ancient wine-producing region. The name Dionysias replaced the former Nabataean name in 149 AD after Nabataean influence decreased and then concentrated towards the south, as a result of the then accelerating Hellenization of Coele-Syria. The agora of Dionysias The arch of the lesser church Orthodox Easter celebrations in As-Suwayda Dionysias was a part of the Roman province of Arabia Petraea, and received the rights of civitas during the reign of Commodus between 180‚Äì185. Dionysus was worshipped in the same Nabatean temple dedicated to Dushara. This practice of associating the worship of local and Hellenic gods was common in Hellenistic Syria. This name remained in use during the Byzantine Empire, when the town was under the influence of the Ghassanids. Dionysias then was a diocese with a suffragan bishop from Bosra. It was mentioned in the Synecdemus of Hierocles. After the early Muslim conquests it became a titular see. Yaqut al-Hamawi noted in the 1220s that As Suwaida was \\"a village of the Hauran Province\\".quoted in Le Strange, 1890, p. 540 = Ottoman era = In 1596 As- Suwayda appeared under the name of Majdal Sawda in the Ottoman tax registers as part of the nahiya (subdistrict) of Bani Nasiyya of the Hauran Sanjak. It had a population of 5 households and 5 bachelors, all Muslim. The villagers paid a fixed tax rate of 20% on various agricultural products, including wheat, barley, summer crops, goats and/or beehives, in addition to \\"occasional revenues\\"; a total of 6,125 ak√ße. 3/4 of the revenue went to a waqf.H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 218. In recent times Dionysias was firstly identified as-Suwayda by William Waddington. =Modern era= The city has been held by the government for the duration of the Syrian Civil War and has seen relatively little fighting. On 28 October 2012, security forces launched a campaign of mass arrests in the city. = 2018 As-Suwayda attacks = On July 25 2018 the city, which had been by that time far away from the front lines, was rocked by a string of terrorist attacks. A group of at least 56 ISIS-affiliated attackers entered the city and initiated a series of gunfights and suicide bombings on its streets killing at least 246 people, the vast majority of them civilians. Many of the terrorists were reported killed during the attack, bringing the total death toll to at least 302 people. https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2018-07-26/death-toll-in- devastating-is-attacks-in-syria-climbs-to-216 Forty-two Druze ages 7 to 60 were kidnapped by ISIS and are being held captive.

At the , Port Albert had a population of 293. Location and features The office of Turnbull, Orr and Co., built in 1844 Port Albert was one of the earliest ports established in Victoria. In 1841 the Gippsland Company investigated the area following favourable reports from explorer Angus McMillan. In May of that year the first settlers arrived. Initially the area was known as Seabank or Old Port, but was changed to New Leith when the town started developing, and later changed to Alberton and Port Albert in honour of Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the husband of Queen Victoria. The Post Office opened on 1 November 1842 as Alberton (it was renamed Port Albert in 1856) and was the fourth to open in the Port Phillip District. It became the administrative centre of Gippsland and a transport hub for cargo between Melbourne and Van Diemen's Land (now Tasmania), thanks to its 250-metre timber jetty. As the Victorian Gold Rush began in the 1850s, traffic through Port Albert increased, bringing prospectors from Europe and China, many of whom were headed for the Dargo goldfields. This further added to Port Albert's prosperity. During the 1870s and 1880s, Gippsland was gradually settled, and connected to the railway network. This reduced Port Albert's role as an important transport hub, and the population subsequently decreased. Today the town acts as a commercial fishing port, and is popular with fishers and surfers. The town hosts a fishing competition each March.

Its local government areas are the City of Canning (west of Nicholson Road) and the City of Gosnells (east of Nicholson Road). History Canning Vale's name derives from the Canning River, located about 3 km to the suburb's northeast. It was locally known as North Jandakot until 1925. Until the late 1970s, Canning Vale was a farming area consisting of mostly market gardens and dairy farms due to its swampy terrain with an unusually high abundance of permanent fresh water. Most of the area which is now residential was zoned rural under the Metropolitan Region Scheme until 1994. Developers of residential areas have incorporated numerous landscaped lakes into their developments, which serve an important function in draining this swampy area. Planning for the area incorporated future railways stations at Nicholson and Ranford Roads respectively. These stations will be built as part of the Metronet rail project, with an estimated completion date of 2021. Geography Canning Vale is bounded by Warton Road to the southeast, Garden Street and Nicholson Road to the northeast, Roe Highway to the north and northwest, and Clifton and Acourt Roads to the southwest. The suburb is split into three distinct regions. North of the rail line near Roe Highway is an industrial area that has a number of major warehousing operations including Market City, a wholesale fresh produce market. Also in the area are many distribution facilities such as the IGA distribution centre. Canning Vale's industrial precinct houses major warehouse production sites such as Swan Brewery and ACI Packaging, as well as manufacturing plants for the commercial building and mining maintenance industry, such as Complete Field Maintenance and BGC. South of the line is residential with the normal shopping areas. The western edge of the suburb, contained within a nature reserve, is the Hakea Prison complex. The industrial area is within the boundary of the City of Canning as well as a portion of the residential estates (including Livingston and Waratah). The remainder of the residential area and the prison complex are within the boundaries of the City of Gosnells. Demographics Shiva Temple, Canning Vale. At the 2001 Australian census, Canning Vale had a mostly lower- middle income population of 12,849 people living in 4,115 dwellings, all but 205 of which were separate houses. The population is very diverse, with 14% of East or South-East Asian descent, and sizeable Indian and Italian minorities. At the 2006 census, Canning Vale had a population of 23,289, which was predominantly Catholic (24.9%), married (62.8%), and with a median household income of $1,591 per week. Canning Vale has 6,331 families of which 62.8% were couples. At the 2011 census, the suburb had a population of 30,666, still maintaining its ethnic and religious diversity; 15% of the suburb was of either Chinese or Indian ancestry, and Buddhism and Islam were the third and fourth most practised beliefs in the suburb (after Catholicism, no religion and Anglicanism). At the 2016 census, the suburb's population was 33,059, with people of either Chinese or Indian ancestry making up 22.4%% of the total. Facilities Canning Vale contains five retail precincts, four within the residential areas. A large industrial area is located in the north-west. Community facilities include five primary schools (Canning Vale (opened 1994), Ranford (1999), Campbell (2002), Excelsior (2005) and Caladenia (2007), and a private school (St Emilie's Catholic)), and a high school, Canning Vale College, numerous churches, a Sikh temple, a Hindu temple, a community centre and two golf courses (Gosnells Golf Club and Canning Vale Country Club). Canning Vale has a junior football club, going under the name of Canning Vale Cougars Junior Football Club. No AFL players have come from the Canning Vale Cougars, but a few WAFL players have come from Canning Vale. The club celebrated their 10th anniversary in 2006. Canning Vale also has cricket team which is run by the SEMJCC and goes by the name of Canning Vale Junior/Senior Cricket Club. The Canning Vale Senior Football Club (established 2011) has participated in the WA Amateur Football League ever since its formation. It has won the 2011, 2012, and 2013 premierships.http://www.cvsfc.org.au/history/ Their home matches are played at Clifton Park. Canning Vale also has a cheerleading club called Extreme Cheer Allstars, which has classes from 2 to 18+ for boys and girls. This club is located just off Nicholson Road and in the heart of Canning Vale. The main shopping centre, Livingston Marketplace, is situated at the corner of Ranford Road and Nicholson Road. A second shopping centre, The Vale, is located on the corner of Warton Road and Amherst Road, along Canning Vale's eastern boundary. The section of Canning Vale to the north of the Nicholson and Warton Road intersection contains Hakea Prison, Melaleuca Remand and Reintegration Facility, and Banksia Hill Juvenile Detention Centre. Transport Canning Vale's northern boundary is the Roe Highway, which connects with the Kwinana Freeway (west) and Albany Highway (east) and provides access to Perth Airport, while Nicholson Road heads north towards Cannington, Western Australia and Westfield Carousel, and Ranford Road goes to Armadale (southeast) and Fremantle over Kwinana Freeway via South Street (northwest). Canning Vale is served by a range of buses linking the area to the Perth central business district, Murdoch University and to Cannington.Transperth website, accessed 18 November 2006. Many bus services connect with Transperth trains at Murdoch, Maddington or Thornlie stations. A train station is also being built.

History The ASTMS was created in 1969 when ASSET (the Association of Supervisory Staffs, Executives and Technicians) merged with the AScW (the Association of Scientific Workers) under the leadership of joint general secretaries: Clive Jenkins of ASSET and John Dutton of the AScW. ASSET, the larger of the two unions, began as the National Foremen's Association and chiefly represented supervisors in metal working and transport. Covering both the public and private sectors, AScW largely represented laboratory and technical workers in universities, the National Health Service and in chemical and metal manufacturing. The AScW could name half-a-dozen Nobel prize winners amongst its membership. By the end of 1970 Clive Jenkins had become sole general secretary of the union. With advertising and personal appearances on television he kept ASTMS in the public's eye, within 15 years the union had expanded from 65,000 members to a figure approaching 500,000. This was achieved both by individual recruitment and by merging with small unions and staff associations, such as the Managers' and Overlookers' Society, Medical Practitioners' Union, the United Commercial Travellers' Association of Great Britain and Ireland, the Union of Insurance Staffs and the Prudential Assurance Staff Association. The number of mergers was eventually to exceed 30. In 1976 trade union activist Sheila McKechnie was appointed as the full- time Health and Safety Director of ASTMS. McKechnie remained with ASTMS until her appointment as Chief Executive of the homeless charity Shelter. In 1988 ASTMS merged with TASS (Technical, Administrative and Supervisory Section), the federated white collar section of the AUEW (Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers) to form MSF (Manufacturing, Science and Finance). On 1 January 2002 MSF was to amalgamate with the AEEU (Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union, a successor to AUEW) to form Amicus. On 1 May 2007 Amicus merged with the TGWU to form Unite, which is the biggest trade union in the UK.

Career On qualification in 1938, Johnson was appointed Assistant Lecturer in the Department of Statistics at UCL. During World War II, he served under his former Professor Egon Pearson as an Experimental Officer with the Ordnance Board. He returned to the Statistics Department at UCL in 1945 and stayed there until 1962, as Assistant Lecturer, Lecturer and then Reader. In 1948 he was awarded a Ph.D. in Statistics for his work on the Johnson system of frequency curves. In 1949 he became a Fellow of the Institute of Actuaries. Two visiting appointments in the USA, at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) in 1952‚Äì1953 and at Case Institute of Technology in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1960‚Äì1961, led to his permanent appointment as Professor in the Department of Statistics at UNC in 1962.

The term is of British origin, and then referred to the debt securities issued by the Bank of England on behalf of His/Her Majesty's Treasury, whose paper certificates had a gilt (or gilded) edge. Hence, they are known as gilt-edged securities, or gilts for short. In 2002, the data collected by the British Office for National Statistics revealed that about two-thirds of all UK gilts are held by insurance companies and pension funds. Since 2009 large quantities of gilts have been created and repurchased by the Bank of England under its policy of quantitative easing, and in recent years overseas investors have also been attracted to gilts by their \\"safe haven\\" status.  Nomenclature  Today, the term \\"gilt-edged security\\" or simply \\"gilt\\" is used in the United Kingdom as well as some Commonwealth nations, such as South Africa and India. However, when reference is made to \\"gilts\\", what is generally meant is UK gilts, unless otherwise specified. Colloquially, the term \\"gilt-edged\\" is sometimes used to denote high-grade securities, consequently carrying low yields, as opposed to relatively riskier, below investment-grade securities. Gilt-edged market makers (GEMMs) are banks or securities houses registered with the Bank of England which have certain obligations, such as taking part in gilt auctions. The term \\"gilt account\\" is also a term used by the Reserve Bank of India to refer to a constituent account maintained by a custodian bank for maintenance and servicing of dematerialized government securities owned by a retail customer.  History  The first fund raising that could be considered a gilt issue was in 1694 when King William III borrowed ¬£1.2m to fund a war with France via the newly created Bank of England. The term \\"gilt\\" however would not be used until the late 19th century for these types of debt securities. This form of government borrowing proved successful and became a common way to fund wars and later infrastructure projects when tax revenue was not sufficient to cover their costs. Many of the early issues were perpetual, having no fixed maturity date. These were issued under various names but were later generally referred to as Consols.  Conventional gilts  These are the simplest form of UK government bond and make up the largest share of the gilt portfolio (75% as of October 2016). A conventional gilt is a bond issued by the UK government which pays the holder a fixed cash payment (or coupon) every six months until maturity, at which point the holder receives their final coupon payment and the return of the principal. =Coupon rate= Conventional gilts are denoted by their coupon rate and maturity year, e.g. 4¬º% Treasury Gilt 2055. The coupon paid on the gilt typically reflects the market rate of interest at the time of issue of the gilt, and indicates the cash payment per ¬£100 that the holder will receive each year, split into two payments in March and September. =Gilt names= Historically, gilt names referred to their purpose of issuance, or signified how a stock had been created, such as 10¬º% Conversion Stock 1999; or different names were used for different gilts simply to minimise confusion between them. In more recent times, gilts have been generally named Treasury Stocks. Since 2005-2006, all new issues of gilts have been called Treasury Gilts. =Trends= The most noticeable trends in the gilt market in recent years have been: * A substantial and persistent decline in market yields as the currency has stabilised compared to the 1970s and more recently UK gilts are seen as a safe haven compared to certain other government bonds. * A decline in coupons: several gilts were issued in the 1970s and 1980s with coupons of ‚â•10% per annum, but these have now matured. * A large and prolonged increase in the overall volume of issuance as the public sector borrowing requirement has increased. * An increase in the volume of issuance of very long dated gilts to respond to demand for these. * A large volume of gilts have been repurchased by central government under its quantitative easing programme.  Index-linked gilts  These account for around a quarter of UK government debt within the gilt market. The UK was one of the first developed economies to issue index-linked bonds in 27 March 1981. Initially only tax-exempt pension funds were allowed to hold these bonds. The UK has issued around 20 index-linked bonds since then. Like conventional gilts, index-linked gilts pay coupons which are initially set in line with market interest rates. (Recently, real market interest yields for many (at times, all) index-linked gilts have been negative; but the coupons for new issues have been constrained to be at least +0.125%.) However, their semi- annual coupons and principal payment are adjusted in line with movements in the General Index of Retail Prices (RPI). Ultra-long index-linked bonds, maturing in 2062 and 2068, were issued in October 2011 and September 2013 respectively, and a 2065 maturity is due to be issued in February 2016. =Indexation lag= As with all index-linked bonds, there are time lags between the collection of prices data, the publication of the inflation index and the indexation of the bond. From their introduction in 1981, index-linked gilts had an eight-month indexation lag (between the month of collection of prices data and the month of indexation of the bond). This was so that the amount of the next coupon was known at the start of each six-month interest accrual period. However, in 2005 the UK Debt Management Office announced that all new issues of index-linked gilts would use a three-month indexation lag, first used in the Canadian Real Return Bond market, and the majority of index- linked gilts now in issue are structured on that basis.  Double-dated gilts  In the past, the UK government issued many double-dated gilts, which had a range of maturity dates at the option of the government. The last remaining such stock was redeemed in December 2013.  Undated gilts  =Historical undated gilts= Until late 2014 there existed eight undated gilts, which made up a very small proportion of the UK government's debt. They had no fixed maturity date. These gilts were very old: some, such as Consols, dated from the 18th century. The largest, War Loan, was issued in the early 20th century. The redemption of these bonds was at the discretion of the UK government, but because of their age, they all had low coupons, and so for a long time there was little incentive for the government to redeem them. Because the outstanding amounts were relatively very small, there was a very limited market in most of these gilts. In late 2014 and early 2015 the government gave notice that four of these gilts, including War Loan, would be redeemed in early 2015. The last four remaining gilts, with coupons of 2.5% or 2.75%, were redeemed on 5 July 2015. =Proposed new undated gilts= In May 2012 the UK Debt Management Office issued a consultation document which raised the possibility of issuing new undated gilts, but there was little support for this proposal.  Gilt strips  Many gilts can be \\"stripped\\" into their individual cash flows, namely Interest (the periodic coupon payments) and Principal (the ultimate repayment of the investment) which can be traded separately as zero-coupon gilts, or gilt strips. For example, a ten-year gilt can be stripped to make 21 separate securities: 20 strips based on the coupons, which are entitled to just one of the half-yearly interest payments; and one strip entitled to the redemption payment at the end of the ten years. The title \\"Separately Traded and Registered Interest and Principal Securities\\" was created as a 'reverse acronym' for \\"strips\\". The UK gilt strip market started in December 1997. Gilts can be reconstituted from all of the individual strips. By the end of 2001, there were 11 strippable gilts in issue in the UK totalling ¬£1,800 million.  Maturity of gilts  The maturity of gilts is defined by the UK Debt Management Office (DMO) is as follows: short 0‚Äì7 years, medium 7‚Äì15 years and long 15 years +. Gilts with a term to maturity of less than three years are also referred to as \\"ultra short\\", while the new gilts issued since 2005 with a term to maturity of 50 years or more have been referred to as \\"ultra long\\".

It is located on the eastern shore of the Paran√° River, opposite Rosario, Santa Fe, to which it has been connected since 2003 by the Rosario-Victoria Bridge (which spans almost 60 km over the flood plain of the Paran√° Delta). The site of a 1750 defeat of a native uprising and an 1810 oratory to the Virgin of Aranzaz√∫, a Marian apparition and the city's patron saint, Cerro La Matanza was granted Village status by the Provincial Legislature, in 1826. An 1829 edict renamed the hamlet Victoria. The church (started in 1872) is dedicated to this patron. Designated a \\"city\\" in 1851, Victoria also features an abbey (Abad√≠a Los Monjes del Ni√±o Dios), founded by Benedictine monks who arrived in 1899. Parish of the Virgin of Aranzaz√∫ The Victoria region is at the core of the fishing industry of commercially important species like s√°balo (Prochilodus lineatus) and surub√≠ (Pseudoplatystoma spp.); it produces 95% of the annual 27,000 tonnes of s√°balo captured in the province. Concerns about over-exploitation of this resource have been raised lately. The city has a beach resort, and the river at this point is appropriate for the practice of sports such as kayak sailing and windsurf. The municipality claims jurisdiction over 3,700 km¬≤ of islands and islets on the Paran√°. Several fishing areas are reserved for sports purposes, while others are protected. Every year Victoria hosts an extended Carnival Season; in 2005, for example, parades and dances were held on weekends from January to the beginning of March. Victoria has seen increased touristic affluence since the opening of the connection with Rosario and the Greater Rosario area. A year later the high-class Casino was opened on the river front; and being one of the biggest such in the country it has brought much wealth for Victoria's tourism industry, attracting gamblers on a national scale.  Tourism  Victoria, also known as the city of seven hills (is located on one of the seven hills in the area) is a major tourist destination in the province. Among its facilities are: innumerable hotels of different categories which highlights the five-star hotel and the most luxurious casino in the country. It is also known for its traditional and centennial carnivals (under the slogan \\"the most fun carnival in the country\\") which has earned it the distinction of being the \\"Provincial Capital of Carnival Entrerriano\\", a title given at the beginning of the 1970s, thanks to its contribution to tourism.

He is well known for his range of voices and accents, and his tendency to play people who end up hurting themselves. This style is a lot more pronounced when he is working solo or with other people outside Killingg√§nget. Some of the roles that Robert has portrayed include: *Greger: An obviously homosexual fireman dressed in a plaid kilt. *Various old people: Gustafsson is known for portraying old and often rather senile individuals. *Bertil: An accident-prone gardener who has his own TV show Lost in my own garden. This role was inspired by a 1980s Swedish gardening show where the host accidentally cut his thumb with a knife, but kept going as if nothing had happened. (The Julia Child spoof by Dan Aykroyd might have been an inspiration as well.) This role led to some of Gustafsson's more gory comedy. In addition, Gustafsson is a skilled imitator and his many famous imitations include Ingmar Bergman, Sven Wollter, Ernst-Hugo J√§reg√•rd, Tony Rickardsson, Robert Aschberg and Magnus H√§renstam as well as former Prime Ministers G√∂ran Persson and Carl Bildt.

Its flagship nightly bulletin is broadcast at on SBS with additional weeknight 'late' bulletins from on SBS. History The World News began as a half-hour bulletin, first seen in 1980, soon after the launch of the then-named Channel 0/28. George Donikian was the service's first presenter; veteran newsreader Mary Kostakidis began reading the weekend news in 1986. The network's long-running investigative documentary series Dateline started in 1984. Closed captioning for the World News was introduced in March 1997. In 2002, a digital-only World News Channel was launched, aimed at providing a comprehensive foreign-language news channel, mainly showing additional bulletins already seen in SBS' morning WorldWatch timeslot. No English-language bulletins were shown on the channel until its demise in 2009. World News Australia was relaunched in its current one-hour format in January 2006, in January 2007 taking over the timeslot of Toyota World Sport and signing CNN correspondent Stan Grant to co-present alongside Mary Kostakidis. The merger between the two programs took place as a result of a claimed drop-off in viewers between programs, when a solid block of advertising would be shown. As a result, the relaunch saw the introduction of commercial breaks during the bulletin.Commercials and Promotions FAQ Accessed 20 May 2007 The new bulletin format has since lost viewers, with the late bulletin often out-rating the flagship 6.30 bulletin; most of this has been attributed to the perceived commercialisation of the bulletin by the SBS Board. A dispute between longtime presenter Mary Kostakidis and the network arose in August 2007, when she walked out of the network in frustration at what she saw as increased commercialisation at the network, and a shift away from the original values of both the news service and the station in general. It was widely speculated that Kostakidis' contract stipulated she would be the network's main news presenter, and maintain editorial control over bulletins, somewhat altered by World News Australia's change in format. Kostakidis took legal action against SBS for breach of contract. In 2009, World News Channel was replaced with SBS Two which became Viceland in 2017. In February 2014, World News Australia was relaunched with new graphics along with a name, SBS World News. In 2017 SBS World News was upgraded with a new set and improved website. The program can now be streamed on the SBS News website as well as the SBS News app. Theme music From 1980 to 1991, Processional Fanfare by the Philip Jones Brass Ensemble was used as the main theme. Since 1991, the World News and World News Australia themes have been written by Australian composer Nigel Westlake.

Early life He was born in Port Talbot, Glamorgan, Wales. His father was a railway worker, and his brother, Tom, became leader of the Transport Salaried Staffs' Association. On leaving Port Talbot County Boys' School in 1940 at the age of 14, when his father died, he started work in the laboratory at a metalworks and continued his education by taking evening classes at Swansea Technical College. Three years later, he was in charge of the lab. Two years after that, he was a night shift foreman. Union career Jenkins had early involvement in his trade union the Association of Scientific Workers (AScW) and become a lay official in 1944, when he was elected as secretary of his branch. In 1946, at the age of 20, he left Port Talbot to become a full-time official at the Birmingham office of the Association of Supervisory Staff, Executives and Technicians (ASSET), where he was appointed assistant divisional secretary. He was at that time a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain. In 1951, he organised his first major national dispute, a strike at Heathrow Airport that caused British European Airways to cancel more than 800 flights. Moving almost immediately to the head office, he received rapid promotion, as national officer in 1954, deputy general secretary in 1957 and general secretary in 1961. Then, ASSET had 23,000 members, which later increased to 50,000 by 1969, when ASSET merged with AScW, to form ASTMS (the Association of Scientific, Technical and Managerial Staffs). ASSET and Jenkins were the senior partner. In the new union, he was joint general secretary with John Dutton of AScW, but by 1970, he was sole general secretary with a vision of what \\"his\\" union could become. By the use of advertising (billboard posters were previously unheard of in the movement), he brought trades unionism to the middle classes. Within 15 years, ASTMS grew from an initial membership of 65,000 to a figure approaching 500,000. Jenkins kept himself (and ASTMS) in the public eye, with frequent appearances on television chat shows and his own regular newspaper columns. His wit and turn of phrase ensured that even his opponents would certainly remember him. However, his brash character ensured that more staid trade union leaders kept him off the General Council of the TUC. until 1974. He even became its chairman, from 1987 to 1988. Involvement in politics A Labour government, under Harold Wilson, was elected in 1974. Jenkins was then appointed to the National Research and Development Council (NRDC), from 1974 to 1980. He sat on the committee that produced the Bullock Report (Industrial democracy) (1975‚Äì1977) as well as on the board of the British National Oil Corporation (1979‚Äì1982). During the 1975 referendum on Britain's membership of the EEC, Jenkins campaigned for Britain to leave the EEC.David Butler and Uwe Kitzinger, The 1975 Referendum (London: Macmillan, 1976), p. 107, p. 256, p. 274. Following the Labour Party's heavy defeat in the 1983 election, Jenkins was instrumental in getting Neil Kinnock nominated to the leadership of the party. In 1988, shortly after ASTMS merged with TASS (the Technical, Administrative and Supervisory Section) to form MSF (Manufacturing, Science and Finance), Jenkins unexpectedly announced his retirement. He wrote an autobiography, All Against The Collar (1990). Retirement Upon retiring, Jenkins ran a bed and breakfast in St Helens, Tasmania, before he returned to Britain.

Hillman named the perennial stream that flows through the district the ‚ÄòMarshall River‚Äô after Captain Marshall MacDermott who was a prominent figure in the Swan River Colony during its earliest years, but this name did not gain hold.Coy, N.J.; The Serpentine: a history of the Shire of Serpentine-Jarrahdale, Shire of Serpentine-Jarrahdale, 1984; p.13 The earliest documented use of the suburb's name is in J W Gregory's survey of Canning Location 22 dated April 1844SRO Cons 3869, Canning 090. which maps the course of the 'Woongan River' for the first kilometre west of the hills and shows the land selected by G & J Armstrong which they developed into what became known as 'Wongong' farm.Popham, D.; First stage south: a history of the Armadale-Kelmscott district, Western Australia; p.26. Also: Coy, 1984; pp.19, 23. The Armstrongs called their homestead and wayside inn 'Woodstock' but described the property and locality as 'Woongan'. The Hall family who subsequently owned the property named it 'Woongong' (although as early as 1858 the variant 'Wongong' is used in a death notice for S T Hall). The name, Aboriginal in origin, is said to mean \\"embracing\\" in the Nyungar language and derives from the manner in which the north and south branches of Wungong Brook clasp the parcel of land that was the centre of the Armstrong's farm.Crooks, J.B.; A Short History of the Wungong Brook, self published brochure, 1971. In the early years of the Colony maps identified the watercourse as the 'Woongan' River or Brook (the latter becoming the more prevalent), but within the span of a few decades the most consistent spelling for the farm became 'Wongong' and this variant was also applied to the railway stop established there when the South Western Railway was constructed in late 1892. The railways continued to use this name until 1949. In 1909, a new variant of the name was introduced when the Crown offered land near the railway for sale as lots in the 'Wungong Townsite';Western Australian Government Gazette, 19/03/1909, p.746. See also map of Wungong Townsite dated 11.5.11, however, this variant did not receive wider use after 1949, when it was applied to the railway stop. The new spelling would have been further reinforced when in 1957 the northern section of Rowley Road was renamed 'Wungong Road'.Western Australian Government Gazette, 22/03/1957, p.994. It has been claimed that the Government's introduction of Wungong (with a 'u') was intended to more clearly distinguish this district from Wongan Hills.The West Australian, 27/11/1915, article in News and Notes column (p.10) which refers to a letter written to the Armadale- Kelmscott Roads Board requesting alteration of the name 'Wongong' to avoid its confusion with 'Wongan'. But, despite the efforts of the government, many residents clung to the old spelling.See for example the constitution of the 'Wongong Congregational Church' dated 22/02/1954. =Wider settlement and consolidation= Until around 1900, settlement in the district was more or less limited to Wongong farm, an adjoining property owned by Claude Marsh, Edward Gibbs's smallholding in the hills named 'Cooliabbera' and Walter Butcher's property at Upper Wongong (situated in wide section of the gorge where the Admiral Road reserve crosses). Nearby settlement included the Saw's property south of Armadale and properties in the Byford (then Beenyup) area.Early survey plans, including SRO Cons 3869 Cockburn Sound 139 (1877), and other material in City of Armadale Libraries Wongong railway station, circa 1935 (State Library of Western Australia, B3524139_9) The South Western Railway was constructed through Wongong in late 1892, and a stop was created at the northern boundary of Wongong farm from where milk was picked up and children from the farm boarded to travel to the school in Armadale. In 1910 the stop was moved to higher ground 600 metres northwards because in frosty conditions it was difficult to get the south-bound train moving uphill. The stop existed until 1969, and comprised a siding (removed 1954), weatherboard shelter, and stock pens. Its removal probably coincided with the creation of a cutting to eliminate the gradient. In the 1890s, the sale of a vast tract of undeveloped land owned by Samuel Hamersley (also owner, for a time, of Wongong farm) and its subsequent subdivision by an Eastern States speculator named Goss opened up the area with a patchwork of small rural lots averaging some apiece. Provision was made for a township, and the Wungong townsite was gazetted on 12 March 1909; although it was not subsequently developed. By this time, many of these properties had been taken up by settlers, a number of whom had migrated from the United Kingdom. 250x250px Memorial board for Emmaline 'Granny' Bodicoat, district midwife, which originally hung in the Wongong hall. Settlement in the area was particularly concentrated within a radius of of the intersection of Eleventh Road and Wungong Road (Wungong Road being known as 'Rowley Road' at that time), an intersection that came to be known as 'Bodicoat's Corner' after the couple who occupied the cottage on the north side of the intersection. Names of other early families included Cockshott, Hilbert, Sermon, Marsh, Billingham, Whiteley, Cassell, Dutton, Smith, Aitkin, Mills, Baggs, Grafham, Henderson and Wheeler. These settlers formed a community and took the initiative to erect a hall on Eleventh Road, north of Bodicoat's Corner (at the intersection with Rowley Road). The land was donated by Dutton. It was vested in the Congregational Union of Australia and formally known as the 'Wongong Congregational Mission Hall'. This hall was the centre of community activities for the next 50 years. In the early 1950s, while for a time disused by the Congregationalists, it was hired by the fledgling Free Reformed Church for their worship services, Bible study evenings and, in 1954, as the venue for the first synod of the Free Reformed Churches of Australia.Bosveld, G J; The Free Reformed pioneers : a history of migrants from the Netherlands to Australia, and the early days of the Free Reformed Churches in Western Australia in the 1950s, Pro Ecclesia, Armadale W.A., 2008 Over the years, the hall served as a venue for various religious and secular festivities (but not dancing), weddings, a meeting venue for the local Progress Association, a polling place for elections, and even for a short time as an overflow classroom for the Armadale Senior High School. By the early 1960s, the hall had fallen into disuse and in 1963 it was dismantled and relocated to Roleystone. A concrete pad and steps remained on the site until around 2013 when the steps were relocated to the grounds of the newly opened Free Reformed Church of Darling Downs, on the corner of Rowley Road and Masters Road. The site continues to have social significance to many local residents. =Upper Wongong= During the 1890s, a number of settlers became established in the hills along the valley of the Wongong Brook. The most prominent of these settlers was Walter Butcher who built up a productive farm downstream from the present location of Wungong Dam. Areas cleared for pasture land, introduced trees and some artifacts of Butcher's farm are still extant, as are remnants of a government-built timber bridge where the Admiral Road reservation - which passed through his farmyard - fords the river. The construction of Wungong Dam, which was completed in [1975-1979], obliterated a number of small holdings in this 'Upper Wongong' district. Other small holdings were cleared away in order to create the water catchment area for Wungong Dam. Building of the Wungong Dam was preceded in 1925 by the construction of a small pipehead dam on the brook, part of the 'Hills Scheme' which was intended to supplement the growing water needs of the Perth metropolitan area by means of constructing three reservoirs and three pipehead dams. The Wungong Brook Pipehead Dam supplied up to 32,000 kilolitres a day, more than either the Churchman Brook Dam or Victoria Reservoir. Soon after the pipehead dam was built, plans were prepared for a larger dam on the site but were put aside when in the 1930s it was decided to build the Canning Dam. Wungong Dam has a capacity of 60 million kilolitres and, when full, its storage area covers 30 hectares stretching 5.8 kilometres back from the dam wall.Wungong Dam (7 page brochure), Water Corporation, November 2009. Water from the dam is supplied by means of a steel pipe laid through the Wungong Gorge, although provision for an alternative supply route was made during the 1980s by creation of the Wungong Tunnel which runs underground from just west of Wungong Dam through to Rails Crescent on the western slope of the Darling Scarp.Cunningham, S & Marcos, GW & Mather, RP (1984). The Wungong Tunnel, Metropolitan Water Authority, Perth, Geology and Construction. In Fifth Australian Tunnelling Conference: State of the Art in Underground Development and Construction; Preprints of Papers. 142-152. =20th century to present= In the early years of the 20th century there were a number of areas near the railway from which gravel was excavated, and some of the diggings are still evident on the south side of the South Western Railway between Moore Street and Eleventh Road. The largest excavation was in the Wungong town reserve, but already by the 1920s this was filled with water and occasionally used by local youths as a swimming hole. In the 1950s, prior to the establishment of the City of Armadale's Hopkinson Road tip, it was used as a rubbish dump. For many years after this use ceased, the reserve was still an informal dumping ground for rubbish. The reserve also contained surviving native flora.English, Val & Blythe, John; Interim Recovery Plan for the Corymbia calophylla - Kingia australis woodlands on heavy soil (Swan Coastal Plain Community type 3a - Gibson et al. 1994) 2000-2003; report for the Department of Conservation and Land Management (CALM), Western Australia, January 2000. Locals recall it also being used as a gathering place for Guy Fawkes fireworks nights in the 1950s, and during the 1980s its network of tracks were being used by a local horse trainer and by youths on motorbikes or in old cars. The former townsite is now fenced, cleared of most rubbish, and designated as the Lambert Lane Nature Reserve.  Features and attractions  = Fletcher Park = Grass trees in Fletcher Park. (2015) Bushland on the east side of the South Western Railway, opposite the townsite reserve and extending from the former Stone Street reserve to Eleventh Road, is a reserve named Fletcher Park. This reserve has the Cooliabbera Creek running along its north-eastern boundary and is characterized by open forest of marri (Corymbia calophylla) and dense shrubbery dominated by grass trees (Xanthorrhoea preissii and Kingia australis). The Western Australian Christmas tree (Nuytsia floribunda) also occurs in this area. From 1980, the area through which the creek flows has been leased to the Wallangara Riding and Pony Club which has developed an arena, bridle trails, jumps and clubroom facilities on the site.Fletcher Park Bushland Management Plan, prepared by ENV Australia P/L for the City of Armadale, 27/07/2010. = Wongong Brook = Postcard (c.1908) showing the area near the South-Western Highway that was a popular picnic destination. Wongong Brook has for long been a place of recreation. In the earliest years of motor cars, the brook in the vicinity of the South Western Highway was well known a picnic destination. A number of postcards portraying the brook in its bushland setting were produced at this time.'A glimpse of Wongong Creek, W.A'; coloured postcard published by P.Falk & Co, 1908; State Library of Western Australia ref 7496B/1. Generations of local children have paddled and swum in the deeper sections of the brook, navigated sections in small boats and home-made canoes, and caught marron and gilgies in its waters. = Wongong Gorge, Bungendore Park, and Wungong Regional Park = The Wongong Gorge and the hills which form a backdrop to the district have been favoured by bushwalkers, including local residents. A great deal of bushland has been preserved in the hills east of Wongong, a significant area of which is Bungendore Park. The Park's core was a reserve gazetted in 1897 for the purpose of timber harvesting. Not long after, in 1908, the reserve was re-designated as 'parklands'. In 1965 it was vested in the Armadale-Kelmscott Shire Council, and in 1973 was named 'Bungendore Park'. Other areas have subsequently been added to this Park: today it comprises . It is now regarded as a preserve of bushland of regional importance within the Darling Range Regional Park. The Wongong Gorge is outside of the bounds of Bungendore Park, but together with several other large areas of local bushland it forms the Wungong Regional Park - a management area created in 2008. As many as 351 plant species and 131 vertebrate fauna species have been identified as potentially occurring in Bungendore Park.Bungendore Park Strategic Directions (report), City of Armadale, 14 September 2009, pp 2, 6, 8 & 9. = Armadale Reptile and Wildlife Centre = A goanna, observed in the wild near the site of the Wongong hall. (2015) A private wildlife sanctuary named ‚ÄòArmadale Reptile and Wildlife Centre' was opened on the South-Western Highway in Wongong in 1995 by the Gaikhorst family and has the largest public reptile and amphibian display in Western Australia, featuring dingoes, flying foxes, farm animals marsupials and birds.

These areas comprise: *Weir in the Wongong Gorge. The area in the background is part of Bungendore Park. (2015)the hills; including 'Upper Wungong' comprising regenerated bushland and semi-rural subdivisions. *the corridor between the South Western Highway and the South Western Railway, south of Stone Street and north of Eleventh Road. *the flats or plain west of the South Western Railway, bounded by Wungong Road and Rowley Road to the north, the land either side of Wungong Brook to the west, and Keenan Street to the south, where hobby farms predominate. Historically, the flats west of the railway have, other than 'Wongong' farm, been an area of rural smallholdings. Some of these smallholdings survive in reduced form as blocks of up to 10 acres. However, from the late 1980s this area is progressively being transformed into suburbs of the Perth metropolitan area. The oldest of this suburban development is located immediately south of Gwynne Park (which for a long time defined the south-west limit of Armadale township), obliterating the old properties of 'Chinnor', 'Chiltern' and 'Trefoil Noir', as well as a few other smallholdings. The suburb in this area takes the name of Brookdale. When, in the 1990s, the Evelyn Gribble Community Centre was built, it was the only new development on the south-western side of Ninth Road. Suburban development is now infilling areas west of the Evelyn Gribble Centre and the planning of this suburban expansion is being managed by the Metropolitan Redevelopment Authority. Longer established community facilities and businesses in this area include the factory and retail outlet of Rose Valley Cheese Company (1977) on Wungong Road, the Seventh Day Adventist Church and School (c.1980, now known as Australian Christian College - Darling Downs) on Ninth Road near the corner of Wungong Road, and the retirement villas (c.1990) on Rowley Road west of Masters Road.

Formerly part of Armadale and Wungong, Mount Richon was approved as a suburb in 2003. It occupies the western slope of the darling range from the intersection of the Albany and South Western Highways south to Leys Rise, is bounded on the west by the South-Western Highway and is bounded on the east by the Albany Highway and Bungendore Park. Mount Richon is named after a vineyard that formerly existed in the area.  History  The major themes in the documented history of this suburb are as follows (in chronological order): * Aboriginal occupation. * Early exploration by European settlers. * Early grants, two boundaries of which create the 'indent' on the eastern boundary of the Mount Richon suburb. * Establishment of the W.A. Mining Company and the Colony's first mining venture (Cole's Shaft) in the late 1840s. * Formation of the Albany and South Western Highways, and establishment of the Narrogin Inn. * Dead Man's Gully and the associated legend. * Establishment of the Armadale Brickworks, the associated extraction of shale from the escarpment and the extraordinary tramline operated by 'endless haulage gear'. Wood cutting by members of the Serls family and others and the consequent creation of Bedfordale Hill Road. * Establishment of the Marian's Vineyard (aka Slavonian Vineyard), later renamed the Richon Vineyards by GVP McCarthy. * Operation of granite quarry on the south side of the Albany Highway, east of the Narrogin Inn, in the 1920s. * Closure of the Armadale Brickworks and shale quarry, and early suburban development on the escarpment above the Armadale town centre. * Trouble with bushfires originating in Bedfordale (fanned by the Easterly Wind). * Closure of the Richon Vineyards in the 1950s, removal of vines and gradual ruination of the cellars and homestead. * Suburban development around Tredale Avenue consequent to the establishment of Armadale High School in 1957. * Subdivision south of Tredale and the building of the Schoenstatt Shrine around 1990. * Southward expansion: development of the caravan park, demolition of the derelict Richon Cellars in 1989 and subdivision of the former vineyard property in the early 1990s.  Water courses  Four identifiable water courses pass through the suburb, and a fifth flanks the southern boundary. The Neerigen Brook flows northwards alongside the Albany Highway from Bedfordale Hill Road to near the intersection of Carradine Road. It joins the Wungong Brook at the northern end of Twelfth Road in Westfield, the two brooks forming what is from that point named the Southern River - a major tributary of the Canning River. The Neerigen brook is seasonal by nature, but has at times been known to flow all year around. An unnamed, seasonal stream originating from springs in the escarpment runs on the south side of the Schoenstatt Shrine and under the highway into the Armadale Brickworks site. This stream discharges into the Wungong Brook half a kilometer west of the intersection of Rowley and Eleventh Roads. An unnamed, seasonal stream originating from springs on the escarpment forms a steep-sided ravine which passes under the South Western Highway between the caravan park and former vineyards. The ravine is known as 'Dead Man's Gully'. The lower course of the stream is indistinct, but passes under the South Western Railway just south of the crossing to Wungong Road, and from this point the stream joined its northern counterpart near Ninth Road and one kilometer south-east of this discharges into the Wungong Brook. An unnamed winter brook originates from springs on the hillside in the lower northern corner of the area formerly known as McCarthy's bald patch, flowing down a shallow gully in the public open space alongside and above Chateau Court. Originally the gully took a broader profile in the present-day vicinity of Chateau Court and was filled in where the Richon Vineyard cellars were constructed (flows having been diverted around the southern side of the cellar building). The stream is not discernible west of the South Western Highway. A seasonal stream originates at springs in Bungendore Park near the south-eastern corner of the suburb, and takes the name Cooliabbera Creek from the property on which the southern watershed is located. This creek flows out of a steep sided valley in the escarpment. It runs parallel to Leys Rise, just outside the southern boundary of the suburb, and joins the stream from Dead Man's Gully just north of the intersection of Eleventh and Rowley Roads, after which it discharges into the Wungong Brook. Flora and fauna Much of the eastern boundary of Mount Richon adjoins parkland of regenerated bush, and some the more elevated parts of the suburb retain remnant native trees and understorey. Kangaroos, individual or in groups of up to twenty, are regular visitors to many of the properties in the suburb - attracted by the fresh greenery of the gardens. Smaller marsupials are also sometimes sighted. Pockets of bushland in this area provide habitat for a range of different lizards and snakes. Small freshwater crayfish, known locally as gilgies, are found in the Neerigen Brook. Birds frequenting this area include the kookaburra, magpie, mudlark, black crow, and several kinds of wrens. As many as 82 different species of birds have been sighted in the adjoining Bungendore Park.http://www.bushlandperth.org.au/bushland- treasures/eastern/164-bungendore-park  Present day character  The northern section of Mount Richon, north of the point where Hobbs Drive intersects Bedfordale Hill Road, contains suburban housing mostly of the 1960s through to the 1980s. Older housing, some as early as the 1930s, fronts onto the South- Western Highway. The disused shale quarry of the old Armadale Brickworks occupies a large area immediately north of Bedfordale Hill Road, and on the opposite side of Bedfordale Hill Road is a reserve named Tredale Park. The section immediately south of this, the arteries of which are Talus Drive and Rise Court, contain larger suburban lots (semi-rural) with housing stock mostly dating to the 1990s and the Schoenstatt Chapel. Immediately south of this is a caravan park, known as Hillside Garden Village. The southernmost area is that which was formerly the vineyard, bounded on the north by Deadman's Gully and on the south by Ley's Road. This area comprises suburban lots, those on the more elevated ground being larger and of a semi-rural character.

The suburb occupies hilly terrain bounded on the north by the Brookton Highway and Hill Street (1.6 km), west by Paterson Road 1.1 km), south-west by Canns and Carradine Roads (1.6 km), south by property boundaries on the north side of the Neerigin Brook (0.3 km), and east by the Albany Highway (2.7m). With the exception of the Armadale Kelmscott District Memorial Hospital, the suburb is primarily residential.  History  The suburb takes its name from a vineyard, named the Derry NaSura (gateway or doorway to the South), which formerly occupied the hillside above the Albany Highway just north of the Narrogin Inn. This vineyard was established in the early 1890s by a partnership of Martin E. Jull, then Chief Clerk of the Railway Construction Department, and Dr J . M. Fergusson-Stewart. In 1896, Fergusson-Stewart's share was bought out by Sir Arthur Stepney, an English Baronet, and for a time the vineyard was known as the Stepney Jull Armadale Vineyard. Jull sold out to Sir Arthur in 1899. Under Sir Arthur's ownership, the vineyard was significantly expanded and renamed the 'Derry NaSura Vineyard'.Popham, D.; First Stage South: a history of the Armadale-Kelmscott district, Western Australia, Town of Armadale, 1980; pp. 61-64. Sir Arthur also developed an extensive orchard alongside the vineyard, and in 1904 erected a substantial cellar building which was a landmark on the hillside above the infant township.The West Australian, 29 January 1904, p.6. In the early years of the 20th Century, the vineyard was one of Armadale's leading industries along with the Armadale Brickworks.The Western Mail, 5 August 1905, p.37. When Sir Arthur died in 1909, the vineyard was taken over by Messrs H.C.Sewell and C.Crocker who continued to invest in the development of this enterprise. In 1946 the vineyard was purchased by Messrs G.Hack and W.Clowes, and at that time comprised 268 acres of which 100 acres were planted with vines.The Daily News, 21 August 1946, p.9. Vines were removed in the 1950s and some time later the redundant cellars were demolished. The property was purchased by a private syndicate and in 1966 it was rezoned for residential subdivision. In the decades that followed the distinctively terraced hillside was gradually covered by suburban housing.Carter, J & B; Settlement to City: A history of the Armadale district and its people; City of Armadale, 2011, p. 326. During the 1980s and 1990s, residents successfully campaigned to have the name of the area changed from Armadale to Mount Nasura.

Clinical symptoms are heterogeneous, ranging from the rapidly fatal, perinatal variant, with profound skeletal hypomineralization and respiratory compromise, to a milder, progressive osteomalacia later in life. Tissue non- specific alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP) deficiency in osteoblasts and chondrocytes impairs bone mineralization, leading to rickets or osteomalacia. The pathognomonic finding is subnormal serum activity of the TNSALP enzyme, which is caused by one of 200 genetic mutations identified to date, in the gene encoding TNSALP. Genetic inheritance is autosomal recessive for the perinatal and infantile forms but either autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant in the milder forms. The prevalence of hypophosphatasia is not known; one study estimated the live birth incidence of severe forms to be 1:100,000.  Symptoms and signs  There is a remarkable variety of symptoms that depends, largely, on the age of the patient at initial presentation, ranging from death in utero to relatively mild problems with dentition in adult life. Although several clinical sub-types of the disease have been characterized, based on the age at which skeletal lesions are discovered, the disease is best understood as a single continuous spectrum of severity. = Perinatal hypophosphatasia = Perinatal hypophosphatasia is the most lethal form. Profound hypomineralization results in caput membranaceum (a soft calvarium), deformed or shortened limbs during gestation and at birth, and rapid death due to respiratory failure. Stillbirth is not uncommon and long-term survival is rare. Neonates who manage to survive suffer increasing respiratory compromise due to softening of the bones (osteomalacia) and underdeveloped lungs (hypoplastic). Ultimately, this leads to respiratory failure. Epilepsy (seizures) can occur and can prove lethal. Regions of developing, unmineralized bone (osteoid) may expand and encroach on the marrow space, resulting in myelophthisic anemia. In radiographic examinations, perinatal hypophosphatasia can be distinguished from even the most severe forms of osteogenesis imperfecta and congenital dwarfism. Some stillborn skeletons show almost no mineralization; others have marked undermineralization and severe osteomalacia. Occasionally, there can be a complete absence of ossification in one or more vertebrae. In the skull, individual bones may calcify only at their centers. Another unusual radiographic feature is bony spurs that protrude laterally from the shafts of the ulnae and fibulae. Despite the considerable patient-to-patient variability and the diversity of radiographic findings, the X-ray can be considered diagnostic. = Infantile hypophosphatasia = Infantile hypophosphatasia presents in the first 6 months of life, with the onset of poor feeding and inadequate weight gain. Clinical manifestations of rickets often appear at this time. Although cranial sutures appear to be wide, this reflects hypomineralization of the skull, and there is often ‚Äúfunctional‚Äù craniosynostosis. If the patient survives infancy, these sutures can permanently fuse. Defects in the chest, such as flail chest resulting from rib fractures, lead to respiratory compromise and pneumonia. Elevated calcium in the blood (hypercalcemia) and urine (hypercalcenuria) are also common, and may explain the renal problems and recurrent vomiting seen is this disease. Radiographic features in infants are generally less severe than those seen in perinatal hypophosphatasia. In the long bones, there is an abrupt change from a normal appearance in the shaft (diaphysis) to uncalcified regions near the ends (metaphysis), which suggests the occurrence of an abrupt metabolic change. In addition, serial radiography studies suggest that defects in skeletal mineralization (i.e. rickets) persist and become more generalized. Mortality is estimated to be 50% in the first year of life. = Childhood hypophosphatasia = Hypophosphatasia in childhood has variable clinical expression. As a result of defects in the development of the dental cementum, the deciduous teeth (baby teeth) are often lost before the age of 5. Frequently, the incisors are lost first; occasionally all of the teeth are lost prematurely. Dental radiographs can show the enlarged pulp chambers and root canals that are characteristic of rickets. Patients may experience delayed walking, a characteristic waddling gait, stiffness and pain, and muscle weakness (especially in the thighs) consistent with nonprogressive myopathy. Typically, radiographs show defects in calcification and characteristic bony defects near the ends of major long bones. Growth retardation, frequent fractures, and low bone density (osteopenia) are common. In severely-affected infants and young children, cranial bones can fuse prematurely, despite the appearance of open fontanels on radiographic studies. The illusion of open fontanels results from hypomineralization of large areas of the calvarium. Premature bony fusion of the cranial sutures may elevate intracranial pressure. = Adult hypophosphatasia = Adult hypophosphatasia can be associated with rickets, premature loss of deciduous teeth, or early loss of adult dentation followed by relatively good health. Osteomalacia results in painful feet due to poor healing of metatarsal stress fractures. Discomfort in the thighs or hips due to femoral pseudofractures can be distinguished from other types of osteomalacia by their location in the lateral cortices of the femora. Some patients suffer from calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystal depositions with occasional attacks of arthritis (pseudogout), which appears to be the result of elevated endogenous inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) levels. These patients may also suffer articular cartilage degeneration and pyrophosphate arthropathy. Radiographs reveal pseudofractures in the lateral cortices of the proximal femora and stress fractures, and patients may experience osteopenia, chondrocalcinosis, features of pyrophosphate arthropathy, and calcific periarthritis. Odontohypophosphatasia is present when dental disease is the only clinical abnormality, and radiographic and/or histologic studies reveal no evidence of rickets or osteomalacia. Although hereditary leukocyte abnormalities and other disorders usually account for this condition, odontohypophosphatasia may explain some ‚Äúearly-onset periodontitis‚Äù cases.  Causes  Hypophosphatasia is associated with a molecular defect in the gene encoding tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP). TNSALP is an enzyme that is tethered to the outer surface of osteoblasts and chondrocytes. TNSALP hydrolyzes several substances, including inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) and pyridoxal 5‚Äô-phosphate (PLP), a major form of vitamin B6. When TSNALP is low, inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) accumulates outside of cells, and inhibits formation of hydroxyapatite, one of the main components of bone, causing rickets in infants and children and osteomalacia (soft bones) in adults. PLP is the principal form of vitamin B6 and must be dephosphorylated by TNSALP before it can cross the cell membrane. Vitamin B6 deficiency in the brain impairs synthesis of neurotransmitters, which can cause seizures. In some cases, a build-up of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystals in the joint can cause pseudogout.  Genetics Perinatal and infantile hypophosphatasia are inherited as autosomal recessive traits with homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for two defective TNSALP alleles. The mode of inheritance for childhood, adult, and odonto forms of hypophosphatasia can be either autosomal dominant or recessive. Autosomal transmission accounts for the fact that the disease affects males and females with equal frequency. Genetic counseling is complicated by the disease‚Äôs variable inheritance pattern, and by incomplete penetration of the trait. Hypophosphatasia is a rare disease that has been reported worldwide and appears to affect individuals of all ethnicities. The prevalence of severe hypophosphatasia is estimated to be 1:100,000 in a population of largely Anglo-Saxon origin. The frequency of mild hypophosphatasia is more challenging to assess because the symptoms may escape notice or be misdiagnosed. The highest incidence of hypophosphatasia has been reported in the Mennonite population in Manitoba, Canada where one in every 25 individuals are considered carriers and one in every 2,500 newborns exhibits severe disease. Hypophosphatasia is considered particularly rare in people of African ancestry in the U.S.  Diagnosis  = Dental findings = Hypophosphatasia is often discovered because of an early loss of deciduous (baby or primary) teeth with the root intact. Researchers have recently documented a positive correlation between dental abnormalities and clinical phenotype. Poor dentition is also noted in adults. = Laboratory testing = The symptom that best characterizes hypophosphatasia is low serum activity of alkaline phosphatase enzyme (ALP). In general, lower levels of enzyme activity correlate with more severe symptoms. The decrease in ALP activity leads to an increase in pyridoxal 5‚Äô-phosphate (PLP) in the blood, and correlates with disease severity. Urinary inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) levels are elevated in most hypophosphatasia patients and, although it remains only a research technique, this increase has been reported to accurately detect carriers of the disease. In addition, most patients have an increased level of urinary phosphoethanolamine (PEA). Tests for serum ALP levels are part of the standard comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) that is used in routine exams. = Radiography = Despite patient-to-patient variability and the diversity of radiographic findings, the X-ray is diagnostic in infantile hypophosphatasia. Skeletal defects are found in nearly all patients and include hypomineralization, rachitic changes, incomplete vertebrate ossification and, occasionally, lateral bony spurs on the ulnae and fibulae. In newborns, X-rays readily distinguish hypophosphatasia from osteogenesis imperfecta and congenital dwarfism. Some stillborn skeletons show almost no mineralization; others have marked undermineralization and severe rachitic changes. Occasionally there can be peculiar complete or partial absence of ossification in one or more vertebrae. In the skull, individual membranous bones may calcify only at their centers, making it appear that areas of the unossified calvarium have cranial sutures that are widely separated when, in fact, they are functionally closed. Small protrusions (or \\"tongues\\") of radiolucency often extend from the metaphyses into the bone shaft. In infants, radiographic features of hypophosphatasia are striking, though generally less severe than those found in perinatal hypophosphatasia. In some newly diagnosed patients, there is an abrupt transition from relatively normal-appearing diaphyses to uncalcified metaphases, suggesting an abrupt metabolic change has occurred. Serial radiography studies can reveal the persistence of impaired skeletal mineralization (i.e. rickets), instances of sclerosis, and gradual generalized demineralization. In adults, X-rays may reveal bilateral femoral pseudofractures in the lateral diaphysis. These pseudofractures may remain for years, but they may not heal until they break completely or the patient receives intramedullary fixation. These patients may also experience recurrent metatarsal fractures. = Genetic analysis = All clinical sub-types of hypophosphatasia have been traced to genetic mutations in the gene encoding TNSALP, which is localized on chromosome 1p36.1-34 in humans (ALPL; OMIM#171760). Approximately 204 distinct mutations have been described in the TNSALP gene. An up-to-date list of mutations is available online at The Tissue Nonspecific Alkaline Phosphatase Gene Mutations Database. About 80% of the mutations are missense mutations. The number and diversity of mutations results in highly variable phenotypic expression, and there appears to be a correlation between genotype and phenotype in hypophosphatasia‚Äù. Mutation analysis is possible and available in 3 laboratories.geneteset.org homepage  Treatment  As of October 2015, asfotase alfa (Strensiq) has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of hypophosphatasia. Current management consists of palliating symptoms, maintaining calcium balance and applying physical, occupational, dental and orthopedic interventions, as necessary. * Hypercalcemia in infants may require restriction of dietary calcium or administration of calciuretics. This should be done carefully so as not to increase the skeletal demineralization that results from the disease itself. Vitamin D sterols and mineral supplements, traditionally used for rickets or osteomalacia, should not be used unless there is a deficiency, as blood levels of calcium ions (Ca2+), inorganic phosphate (Pi) and vitamin D metabolites usually are not reduced. * Craniosynostosis, the premature closure of skull sutures, may cause intracranial hypertension and may require neurosurgical intervention to avoid brain damage in infants. * Bony deformities and fractures are complicated by the lack of mineralization and impaired skeletal growth in these patients. Fractures and corrective osteotomies (bone cutting) can heal, but healing may be delayed and require prolonged casting or stabilization with orthopedic hardware. A load-sharing intramedullary nail or rod is the best surgical treatment for complete fractures, symptomatic pseudofractures, and progressive asymptomatic pseudofractures in adult hypophosphatasia patients. * Dental problems: Children particularly benefit from skilled dental care, as early tooth loss can cause malnutrition and inhibit speech development. Dentures may ultimately be needed. Dentists should carefully monitor patients‚Äô dental hygiene and use prophylactic programs to avoid deteriorating health and periodontal disease. * Physical Impairments and pain: Rickets and bone weakness associated with hypophosphatasia can restrict or eliminate ambulation, impair functional endurance, and diminish ability to perform activities of daily living. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may improve pain-associated physical impairment and can help improve walking distance] * Bisphosphonate (a pyrophosphate synthetic analog) in one infant had no discernible effect on the skeleton, and the infant‚Äôs disease progressed until death at 14 months of age. * Bone marrow cell transplantation in two severely affected infants produced radiographic and clinical improvement, although the mechanism of efficacy is not fully understood and significant morbidity persisted. * Enzyme replacement therapy with normal, or ALP-rich serum from patients with Paget‚Äôs bone disease, was not beneficial. * Phase 2 clinical trials of bone targeted enzyme-replacement therapy for the treatment of hypophosphatasia in infants and juveniles have been completed, and a phase 2 study in adults is ongoing. History It was discovered initially in 1936 but was fully named and documented by a Canadian Pediatrician, John Campbell Rathbun (1915-1972) while examining and treating a baby boy with very low levels of alkaline phosphatase in 1948.

Biography Popper was born in Prague to Joachim Popper, a fine goods dealer (Galanteriewarenhandler) and Anna Schulhof. He attended the Nikolander Realschule (Technical School) before attending the Technical University in Prague for one year. He gained a degree in mechanical engineering after a three-year study at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. Naval career Popper spent three years at various engineering works in Prague before joining the Austro-Hungarian Navy on 1 December 1869 as a draughtsman. He began working on ship design in 1887, when he prepared plans for the torpedo cruiser . He rose to the rank of Schiffbau-General-Ingenieur (Engineering Admiral), a rank which was created for him and which was conferred on 30 April 1904. He was responsible for the design of all the ships of the navy built until his retirement on 1 April 1907. He was granted an Honorary Doctorate by Vienna University in 1916 and returned it, about 1930, when the University introduced \\"Numera Clausa\\". Kaiser Wilhelm II offered him a chair in Naval Architecture at the Technical University of Berlin at Charlottenburg, but Siegfried declined this offer. By the time he retired Popper was in poor health. He was hard of hearing and his vision was poor. After retiring from the Navy he worked as a consultant for Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino (S.T.T.), at that time the only fabricator of large warships in the monarchy. Retirement and death After retirement Popper devoted much of his time to translating Hebrew literature into German. Because of his deafness he was run down by a tram in Prague and died several days later, on 19 April 1933.

It is the westernmost link between the two cities. It was originally built between 1924 and 1928 by the Federal District Commission, the predecessor to the National Capital Commission (NCC), and the NCC continues to maintain the bridge. The bridge consists of 4 spans and crosses Riopelle, Cunningham and Bate Islands in the Ottawa River. The total length of the bridge is , making it the longest bridge spanning the Ottawa River. On the Ontario side, it is a continuation of Island Park Drive and is also connected to the Sir John A. Macdonald Parkway. It connects to Aylmer Road on the Quebec side. A third reversible lane was added when the bridge was rebuilt in 2002, which is a high-occupancy vehicle lane used for crossings in the direction of peak traffic.

The school is situated in Pasir Laba Camp (PLC) in the western part of Singapore. From 1999/2000 to 2006, it was located at Rocky Hill Camp on Pulau Tekong while its new premise was undergoing construction. The school currently has a total of twelve staffed companies, which are divided into three schools. These companies are named Alpha to Mike (excluding the letter I). The Advanced Specialists Training Wing (ASTW) has become the Specialist and Warrant Officer Advanced School (SWAS); hence it no longer falls under the umbrella of SCS. In 2010, SISPEC was renamed to Specialist Cadet School (SCS) to reflect the wider scope of the school, as it no longer provides Specialist training only for Infantry units. History The Specialist Cadet School was established with the primary objective of training specialists to fill various junior command and control positions in the armed forces. The school is specially equipped with necessary facilities and qualified instructors for the moulding of army specialists. The Specialist Cadet School complements Officer Cadet School in the cultivation of soldiers who display good leadership potential and the capabilities to become key appointment holders in the ranks of the military. On 22 December 2008, the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) introduced a new rank called Specialist Cadet (SCT) to further enhance its efforts as a 3rd Generation Armed Forces. The new rank aims to instill a sense of pride among SCS trainees.http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/resourcelibrary/cyberpioneer/topics/articles/news/2008/December/24dec08_news.html 1966: SISPEC training began when the then called Non Commissioned Officers (NCO) were selected to be the first batch of instructors in School of Section Leaders (SSL). 1969: School of Infantry Section Leaders (SISL) was formed with the expansion of the SAF.

Training Cadets who enrol at SCS first have to go through the Foundation Term (formerly known as Basic Section Leader Course, or BSLC) where they are taught basic infantry skills to command an infantry section. Upon graduation from Foundation Term, the soldiers will be sent to the various formations in the Army for specialized training in their respective fields. SCS‚Äôs Foundation Term is a challenging course that grooms fresh graduates from the Basic Military Training Centre into future leaders of the SAF. The course trains and equips soldiers with infantry skills and knowledge to command an Infantry section. The trainees are required to go through the Confidence Obstacle Course and/or the Additional Obstacle Course, which demand both physical and mental toughness. The Foundation Term ends with a 28-km graduation route march in full battle order. Those who are selected to serve in the Infantry and Guards formations will remain in SCS, where they will undergo the Infantry/Guards Professional Term (formerly Advanced Section Leader Course, or ASLC). The Specialist and Warrant Officer Advanced School (SWAS) conducts the Platoon Sergeant Course and the Company Sergeant Major Course, which were both under the umbrella of SISPEC before the re- organisation. At the end of the Professional Term in the various formations, the cadets will return to SCS for an 8-day Combined Arms Term, culminating in a combined arms Graduation Parade held in Pasir Laba Camp.

Grose was born in Toronto, Ontario. He was the Liberal MP of Oshawa from 1993 to 2004. From 1947 to 1951, Grose served in the Royal Canadian Air Force. In 1957 Grose, then 29, held up a bank in Hamilton, Ontario. Grose reportedly took a 22-year-old man who had gone to the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce branch hostage with a handgun to his back, and left the bank with $6 000 stuffed into a paper bag. Grose was tried, and eventually pleaded guilty. His time in jail for armed robbery amounted to 19 months. Grose would put his criminal past behind him, becoming a businessman. Before entering politics, he did not seek a pardon. Grose also was the Charter President of the Royal Canadian Legion Branch 637 in Oshawa. Grose first stood for federal office as the Liberal Party of Canada candidate for the House of Commons of Canada in the Oshawa district in the 1993 general election. In a Liberal sweep of almost every Ontario seat, Grose defeated New Democratic Party incumbent Mike Breaugh. Grose was the first Liberal MP elected for Oshawa in 47 years. He was re-elected continuously in the federal elections of 1997 and 2000. Grose served as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Veterans Affairs from January 13 to December 11, 2003. He was Vice-Chair of the Commons standing committee on Public Accounts during the first session of the 36th parliament, and of the standing committee on Justice and Human Rights during the second session of that parliament, and the first session of the 37th parliament. Amid considerable infighting in the federal Liberal party in 2004, all incumbent MPs would no longer have their nominations guaranteed. Grose faced challenges for the Liberal nomination from Louise Parkes, a business manager, and city councillor and Deputy Mayor for the city of Oshawa, and from Chris Topple, the Ontario Liberal Party candidate for Oshawa in the two prior provincial elections. Parkes won the nomination over Grose and Topple on the first ballot but finished third behind winner Colin Carrie of the Conservatives and the NDP's Sid Ryan, the second-place finisher, in the general election. Grose's third term ended on May 23, 2004, on the dissolution of Commons preceding the 2004 general election.

His musical production includes a Requiem (or Missa pro defunctis) composed in the mid-seventeenth century during the great plague which ravaged Barcelona, and a Missa de Batalla (Battle Mass) which celebrates the conquest of the Kingdom of Naples. Cererols was born in Martorell. He entered the choir school Escolania de Montserrat around 1626. Cererols took his first steps in music under the direction of Father , a famous organist. After ten years in the escolania, Joan was admitted as a novice at the Monastery of Montserrat on 6 September 1636, at age eighteen. The polychoral dialogue texture with a slight gap between the vocal entries within each choir which lightens his style and contrasts with that of the composers of the earliest generation is supposed to be an influence of March. In 1648, Cererols received the permission of Marc to visit Madrid where he could meet the new generation of musicians. After his return, he was confirmed as a member of the monastic community. After the death of Marc in 1658, Joan Cererols became choirmaster in his home monastery, a position he held until his death there in 1680. He was 61 years old.

Since the 19th century, the four sides of the Market Square have borne the names of four notable Poles who once lived on the respective sides: Ignacy Zakrzewski (south), Hugo Ko≈Ç≈ÇƒÖtaj (west), Jan Dekert (north) and Franciszek Barss (east). In the early 1910s Warsaw Old Town was the home of the prominent Yiddish writer Alter Kacyzne, who later depicted life there in his 1929 novel \\"◊©◊ò◊ê÷∑◊®◊ß◊¢ ◊ê◊ï◊ü ◊©◊ï◊ï◊ê÷∑◊õ◊¢\\" (Shtarke un Shvache, \\"The Strong and the Weak\\"). As depicted in the novel, the Old Town at that time was a slum neighborhood, with poor families - some Jewish, other Christian - living very crowded in subdivided tenements which had once been aristocrats' palaces. Parts of it were bohemian, with painters and artists having their studios, while some streets were a Red-light district housing brothels. In 1918 the Royal Castle once again became the seat of Poland's highest authorities: the President of Poland and his chancellery. In the late 1930s, during the mayoralty of Stefan Starzy≈Ñski, the municipal authorities began refurbishing the Old Town and restoring it to its former glory. The Barbican and the Old Town Market Place were partly restored. These efforts, however, were brought to an end by the outbreak of World War II. During the Invasion of Poland (1939), much of the district was badly damaged by the German Luftwaffe, which targeted the city's residential areas and historic landmarks in a campaign of terror bombing. Following the Siege of Warsaw, parts of the Old Town were rebuilt, but immediately after the Warsaw Uprising (August‚ÄìOctober 1944) what had been left standing was systematically blown up by the German Army. A statue commemorating the Uprising, \\"the Little Insurgent,\\" now stands on the Old Town's medieval city wall. After World War II, the Old Town was meticulously rebuilt. In an effort at anastylosis, as many as possible of the original bricks were reused. However, the reconstruction was not always accurate to prewar Warsaw, sometimes deference being given to an earlier period, an attempt being made to improve on the original, or an authentic- looking facade being made to cover a more modern building.99% invisible episode 72 The rubble was sifted for reusable decorative elements, which were reinserted into their original places. Bernardo Bellotto's 18th-century vedute, as well as pre-World War II architecture students' drawings, were used as essential sources in the reconstruction effort; however, Bellotto's drawings had not been entirely immune to artistic licence and embellishment, and in some cases this was transferred to the reconstructed buildings.

King Sigismund III was attacked by an assassin in the corridor before attending mass Medieval basements at the Museum of Warsaw The Old Town Market Place (Rynek Starego Miasta), which dates back to the end of the 13th century, is the true heart of the Old Town, and until the end of the 18th century it was the heart of all of Warsaw. Here the representatives of guilds and merchants met in the Town Hall (built before 1429, pulled down in 1817), and fairs and the occasional execution were held. The houses around it represented the Gothic style until the great fire of 1607, after which they were rebuilt in late-Renaissance style. Castle Square (plac Zamkowy) is a visitor's first view of the reconstructed Old Town, when approaching from the more modern center of Warsaw. It is an impressive sight, dominated by Zygmunt's Column, which towers above the beautiful Old Town houses. Enclosed between the Old Town and the Royal Castle, Castle Square is steeped in history. Here was the gateway leading into the city called the Krak√≥w Gate (Brama Krakowska). It was developed in the 14th century and continued to be a defensive area for the kings. The square was in its glory in the 17th century when Warsaw became the country's capital and it was here in 1644 that King W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV erected the column to glorify his father Sigismund III Vasa, who is best known for moving the capital of Poland from Krak√≥w to Warsaw. The Museum of Warsaw is also located there. Canon Square (plac Kanonia), behind St. John's Cathedral, is a small triangular square. Its name comes from the 17th-century tenement houses which belonged to the canons of the Warsaw chapter. Some of these canons were quite famous, like Stanis≈Çaw Staszic who was the co-author of the Constitution of May 3, 1791. Formerly, it was a parochial cemetery, of which there remains a Baroque figure of Our Lady from the 18th century. In the middle of the square, is the bronze bell of Warsaw, that Grand Crown Treasurer Jan Miko≈Çaj Dani≈Çowicz, founded in 1646 for the Jesuit Church in Jaros≈Çaw. The bell was cast in 1646 by Daniel Tym - the designer of the Zygmunt's Column. Where the Canon Square meets the Royal Square is a covered passage built for Queen Anna Jagiellon in the late 16th century and extended in the 1620s after Micha≈Ç Piekarski's failed 1620 attempt to assassinate King Sigismund III Vasa as he was entering the Cathedral.Stefan Kieniewicz, ed., Warszawa w latach 1526-1795 (Warsaw in 1526‚Äì1795), vol. II, Warsaw, 1984, . Also the narrowest house in Warsaw is located there. Recognition In 1980, Warsaw's Old Town was placed on the UNESCO's list of World Heritage Sites as \\"an outstanding example of a near-total reconstruction of a span of history covering the 13th to the 20th century. The site is also one of Poland's official national Historic Monuments (Pomnik historii), as designated September 16, 1994. Its listing is maintained by the National Heritage Board of Poland.

The Act gave the Board extensive powers over the lives of Aboriginal Victorians, including regulation of residence, employment and marriage. The Act made Victoria the first colony to enact comprehensive regulations on the lives of Aboriginal Australians. The Board exerted an extraordinary level of control over people's lives including regulation of residence, slavery as employment, marriage, social life and other aspects of daily life. History Victoria enacted the Aboriginal Protection Act 1869 while democratic reforms were being introduced for the population, such as the extension of the franchise from the wealthy to all adult males and the provision of free public education. In contrast, Aboriginal people were losing their freedom. In 1871 the Board developed controls over where Aboriginal people could live and work, what they could do and who they could meet or marry. They removed Aboriginal children from their families, starting the process that created the Stolen Generations. In 1886, Victoria's parliament passed what became known as the Half-Caste Act and started to remove Aboriginal people of mixed descent, known as \\"half-castes\\", from Aboriginal stations or reserves to force them to assimilate into white society. These expulsions separated families and communities, causing distress and leading to protest. Nevertheless, the Board refused to assist the expelled people. It was assumed that the expulsions would lead to the decline in the population of the reserves and their eventual closure. The failure of this policy and its inhumanity led to Victoria's Aborigines Act 1910 and Aboriginal Lands Act 1970, which abandoned this policy.

Fox and Gabrielle Anwar. Plot Doug Ireland is a concierge at the Bradbury, a luxurious hotel in New York City. Doug is very well-connected and is very good at his job, giving personal attention to guests like Gene Salvatore while occasionally pocketing a big tip. He also helps people who don‚Äôt tip as well, such as Harry Wegman. Doug's dream is to open his own hotel on Roosevelt Island. He has saved every cent and obtained an option on an old hotel. But he only has a few weeks to begin development and needs at least $3 million immediately to start or the development goes back to the city. Doug's best chance is Christian Hanover, a somewhat unscrupulous billionaire. Christian considers the proposal and asks Doug to \\"take care\\" of his mistress, Andy Hart, a perfume saleswoman. Christian has been leading Andy on, making her believe that he was divorcing his wife. Doug had been flirting with Andy before he knew she was seeing Christian, and had asked her out multiple times. However, she always stated that she had a boyfriend. Doug spends time with Andy when Christian neglects her, (as a ‚Äúfavor‚Äù for Christian) and he saves Andy and Christian from an embarrassing scene at a party in Christian house with his wife, Elenor. Doug learns that Christian is deceiving Andy about getting a divorce, stating, ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt divorce your third wife.‚Äù But because his hotel proposal is urgent and Andy is old enough to make her own decisions, he doesn't intervene. However, as he and Andy spend time together, he develops feelings for her, going to an elegant restaurant with her after Christian is late due to a date with his wife. He simultaneously helps Harry Wegman with his failing marriage, helping him get his wife to love him again. Andy learns that a document Christian has asked Doug to sign was intended to permit the billionaire to take over the hotel project and force Doug out. Christian reveals that an IRS agent who was tailing Doug about the real estate property he (Doug) bought until he (Christian) and his lawyers took care of it was actually working with Christian to get the property. Christian smugly tells Andy that the project was going to make a fortune and he wasn't going to share it with a mere concierge. Andy abandons him to warn Doug, who is chasing after her to tell her Christian isn‚Äôt divorcing his wife. After the two reunite at the Queensboro Bridge and reveal to each other about the deception, Doug says he never signed the document due to leaving to warn Andy, so Christian can't take over the property. In the end, after Doug and Andy marry, he gets a call from Harry Wegman, who has accidentally been sent Doug's business plan by a senile member of the hotel staff Doug refused to fire and has decided to put up the $3 million that Doug needs.

Four seasons of the program were shown in linked pairs, and all seasons were hosted by Jordan Murphy. It was produced by Nash Entertainment with Bruce Nash and J. D. Roth as two of the executive producers. Overview The series was a dating game show where the chosen winner had to choose between starting a relationship with the central bachelor or bachelorette, or taking home a cash prize while not being permitted any further contact with the central contestant. Eliminated contestants were forced to rip up the checks that represented the money they could have won. Seasons 1 and 2 The first season of the show aired in the summer of 2003. Rob Campos choose among sixteen suitors, unaware that each woman was informed that she was set to win a million dollars if she rejected Rob in the end. The selection boiled down to Erin Brodie and Paige Jones. The two women assumed that Erin would take the money and Paige would take Rob. But in an unexpected move, Rob chose Erin, leaving Paige to tear up her check. But, as expected, Erin rejected Rob and took the million dollars to help care for her ailing father, sending Rob home. Paige's emotional displays were later parodied in I Want to Marry Ryan Banks and The Joe Schmoe Show 2. The second season aired immediately after the first. Erin returned to the house three weeks after she took her million-dollar check. She returned to risk her million dollar-check by being in Rob's position, this time choosing among 15 male suitors. If the final man she chose were to choose her over a million dollars, her million dollars would double; otherwise, the million dollars (in essence) will be passed to him, leaving her with nothing. The men did not know that Erin had already participated in a similar competition. When she trimmed her choices down to just three, Rob returned as a \\"fourth man,\\" returning to woo her the second time. It was not revealed to the original contestants that Erin and Rob had already participated in a version of the competition; Rob was implied to be Erin's ex-boyfriend. Although Rob made it to the final three suitor, Erin ultimately rejected him, leaving her to choose between Wade Whistler and Chad Viggiano. In the end, Erin chose Chad, who chose her. As a result, she won both Chad and two million dollars, $500,000 of which she gave to Chad. Chad and Erin eventually broke up, Erin going on to eventually marry Dr. Will Kirby of Big Brother fame. Chad went on to date San Francisco based model, Natasha Hahn. Seasons 3 and 4 The third season, which aired in 2004, featured Preston Mercer choosing from among a set of sixteen female suitors. Because the show was cast and filmed after the first version of the series aired, a new twist was incorporated: each woman was initially presented a seemingly blank check that she would have the option of ultimately choosing over Preston. Ultraviolet light would reveal the check's value, which would be one of the following: * $1 * $50,000 * $100,000 * $250,000 * $500,000 * $1,000,000 Eventually, Preston was informed that the show was in fact For Love or Money and further, he was shown the value of each woman's check while the women themselves initially remained ignorant of their values. In addition, if the woman Preston chose then chose him in return, Preston would subsequently have the option of choosing a million-dollar prize over her. The women did not know that Preston had received any of this information. Some of the female contestants eventually learned the values of their check through competitions within the game. The final four women choose from among four new checks with mystery values; two were worth $1 and two were worth $1 million. In the end, Preston chose PJ Spillman over Rachel Veltri, who was considered the season's major antagonist. PJ chose Preston, who revealed that he, too, had to choose between love or money, and he chose PJ. Rachel tore up her million-dollar check while PJ did not learn within the show that her check had been worth only one dollar. In the fourth season, which aired immediately after the third, Rachel returned to the house to again compete for the million dollars that she would have won. She was told that she would choose a suitor from among 15 men, and then would have the option of choosing a million-dollar prize over that suitor if he first chose her over a cash prize. Unbeknownst to her, the same offer was made to Andrea Langi, who also lost a million-dollar check while wooing Preston, and who was in turn unaware of Rachel's presence in the new competition. The two women only learned that they were still competing against each other right before meeting the male contestants. Each of the fifteen men was presented with checks in the same manner as the women had been in season 3. However, the new twist was that the men were immediately shown the values of their checks while Rachel and Andrea didn't know the values or that the men did know them. The fifteen men were then introduced to both women and had the opportunity to socialize with them for an evening. The men were then instructed to choose one of the two women to continue courting. Eight of the men courted Rachel her while only seven courted Andrea. In a twist, Andrea was consequently eliminated from the show, as were all of the men who had chosen her. Rachel became the sole bachelorette and was left to choose from among the eight men. Similarly to season 3, the final four men choose from among four mystery checks; again, two were worth one dollar and two were worth a million dollars. In the end, Rachel chose Caleb Janus over Mike Deatly. Caleb chose Rachel over his check and Rachel chose Caleb in return. Mike had to destroy his one-dollar check, while Caleb could forget about his one-dollar check and focus on Rachel, both holders of the million- dollar checks having already been eliminated. It was reported that Caleb and Rachel split up a month after the end of the show's production.

It has been promoted as an alternative, but unsubstantiated, treatment or cure for a number of health conditions.  Health claims  Coral calcium has been promoted as an alternative treatment or cure for a number of health conditions, often as part of an alkaline diet, by Robert Barefoot and others; Barefoot coauthored a book called The Calcium Factor, and marketed coral calcium supplements with infomercials. According to a Time magazine article about Barefoot by Leon Jaroff, \\"The monthly cost of the recommended dose of Barefoot's calcium tablets is some 15 times greater than that of the ordinary drug store variety.\\" Jaroff called Barefoot's marketing of coral calcium \\"one of the more successful scams of our age\\" and \\"sheer nonsense,\\" and labeled him a \\"huckster\\". There is no medical evidence to support these health claims, and coral calcium has been identified by the United States Food and Drug Administration as a \\"Fake Cancer 'Cure' Consumers Should Avoid\\". The Federal Trade Commission prosecuted several individuals, including Barefoot, for making unsupported health claims about coral calcium, and the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine has issued a consumer advisory regarding false and misleading marketing claims associated with coral calcium supplements. Health and environmental concerns Living coral reefs are endangered and cannot be harvested without significant damage to the ecosystem, and because of this, coral calcium is harvested by grinding up above-ground limestone deposits that were once part of a coral reef. Calcium from coral sources needs to be refined to remove pollutants of the source environment. It is marketed as a dietary supplement, but its benefits over other calcium supplements are unproven and biologically unlikely, and several marketers have been found guilty of fraud and were ordered to pay $20.4 million and to refrain from making unsubstantiated claims in the future. Additionally, coral near Okinawa has absorbed relatively high amounts of lead and mercury, leading to concern that these unregulated supplements may be contaminated. Further, coral takes millennia to grow, leading to environmental concerns if harvesting of live coral becomes widespread.

He made his debut (and only appearance) for England, against Scotland on 5 April 1879, at the age of 17 years and 252 days, which made him England's youngest- ever player at the time. He held this record for almost 124 years, until Wayne Rooney made his debut at the age of 17 years and 111 days against Australia on 12 February 2003. Prinsep was selected for a further England v Scotland international fixture in 1882 but was unavailable. Prinsep played for Clapham Rovers, and also formerly held the record for being the youngest player to play in an FA Cup final, playing in the 1879 final against Old Etonians at the age of 17 years and 245 days. This record was broken not long after his England record, by then Millwall player Curtis Weston, who played in the 2004 final aged 17 years and 119 days. Early life Prinsep, born in India, was a descendant of the Anglo-Indian merchant John Prinsep. His namesake, the scholar James Prinsep, was his grandfather's brother. He attended Charterhouse School from 1874 to 1878 and played for their football XI in 1876 and 1877, as well as their cricket XI. Football career He played as half-back, being described by C.W. Alcock as \\"..always cool, very strong on his legs, and combining plenty of strength with great accuracy; kicks splendidly and with judgement; seldom makes a mistake\\", also \\"can kick the ball in any position, and passes it admirably to his forwards\\". His first FA Cup Final in 1879 saw Clapham Rovers lose 1‚Äì0 to Old Etonians. The second however, for his old boy club Old Carthusians two years later, saw his team defeat the Old Etonians 3‚Äì0. Aside from his clubs, he played in representative matches for Surrey county, London, The South v The North and The Rest v England. Other sports Prinsep was also a club cricketer, especially effective as a bowler, with Free Foresters and the Grey Friars cricket club, the latter club drawn from Old Carthusians. Military career He entered the Royal Military College, Sandhurst in 1878 and played in their football teams also, during a period that covered his F.A. Cup Finals and international match. Prinsep was commissioned into the Essex Regiment in 1882 and went on to see action in the Mahdist War. In 1884 he was awarded the Bronze Medal of the Royal Humane Society after saving a fellow soldier from drowning in the Shaban Cataract of the Nile. In 1885 he received a second award of the same medal for rescuing a Sudanese sailor from the same river near El Sabon. In 1885, as a Major, he was seconded to the Egyptian Army. He transferred to the Egyptian Coastguard in 1890, serving until his death when he reached rank of Sub-Inspector General. Death Most sources record that he was killed fighting in Egypt at the age of 34, although the Charterhouse School register of former pupils records that he died in Nairn. In fact, he died of blood poisoning and kidney failure after seven weeks' illness with pneumonia which developed after a cold he suffered when playing golf.

It is distributed throughout Europe then east across the Palearctic to Siberia and Japan. It also occurs in Turkey. Mounted This is a fairly small species with a wingspan of 29‚Äì34 mm. It usually has pale grey forewings with darker markings towards the base, including the prominent black mark at the root of the wing which gives the species its common name. However this is a variable species and darker forms exist, including examples of industrial melanism which are prevalent in some towns and cities. The characteristic basal markings are not usually apparent on such individuals. The hindwings are pale or dark grey. The species flies at night in July and August and is attracted to light and sugar, as well as various flowers. Technical description Forewing dark or pale grey varied with fuscous; the base diffusely darker; the median shade broadly blackish; lines pale, approximating below middle, where they are conversely marked with black; a short black streak on base of submedian fold; claviform stigma long, black-edged, touching or connected with outer line; orbicular and reniform pale, with black outlines, the reniform sometimes white; submarginal line pale, preceded by a rufous grey shade; hindwing brownish grey; fringe pale, often rufous, like the lateral and anal tufts of abdomen; in saliceti Bkh. the inner half of wing is dark, limited by the median shade, the outer half much paler; ab. stricta Esp. is a grey or brown form, with the terminal area only pale, and the costal edge red; a rarer form of which, ab. rufescens ab. nov.

Founded by Auguste Agassiz in 1832, the company has been a subsidiary of the Swiss Swatch Group since 1983. Its winged hourglass logo, which was registered in 1889, is the oldest unchanged yet still active registered trademark.center History 1832 Raiguel Jeune & Cie = 1832‚Äì1867 = Auguste Agassiz and Ernest Francillonalt=leftLongines was founded in Saint-Imier in 1832 by Auguste Agassiz, a Swiss watchmaker and brother of biologist Louis Agassiz. Auguste had two partners, lawyers Henri Raiguel and Florian Morel, and the company's original name was Raiguel Jeune & Cie. By 1846, Raigeul and Morel had retired from the watch industry, leaving Agassiz as sole company head. Several years later, Agassiz brought in his bright, enterprising nephew, trained economist Ernest Francillon, into the business. Francillon was the mastermind behind several impressive innovations that would distinguish the company from its competitors. One early stroke of genius from Francillon was to solely produce crown-wound pocket watches rather than the prevalent key-wound alternative. Later, when Agassiz started suffering from ill health, he passed leadership to Francillon. = 1867‚Äì1878 = Under Francillon, the company began segueing out of the √©tablissage system and moved towards more modern production methods. Francillon solidified his firm‚Äôs progression to mass production in 1867 by establishing his first factory. Its location, an area in southern St. Imier known locally as Les Longines (‚Äúlong meadows‚Äù), gave rise to the Longines name. To help further his efforts to improve the production at Longines, Francillon brought on Jacques David, a talented engineer. In addition, Francillon appointed David as Technical Director and put him in charge of the new factory. By 1867, it was also marked the year the Longines factory produced its first in-house watch movement, the 20A. The 20A, built with an anchor escapement (usually employed in pendulum clocks), was wound and set via a pendent crown. The innovative movement won an award at the 1867 Universal Exhibition in Paris. Several years later, the U.S. watchmaking industry was earning fame worldwide for making great strides in industrialized watch manufacturing. Francillon sent Jacques David to the 1876 World‚Äôs Fair in Philadelphia to gather new ideas and strategies from the Americans. Upon returning, David wrote a comprehensive 108-page report on what he had learned about American watch production. Essentially, this report is considered one of the most significant documents in watchmaking history. It detailed the inner workings of American watch factories, including the entire production process from raw materials to finished watches. Additionally, David also shared the highly-effective internal structure and quality control measures implemented in these factories. In his analysis, David concluded the Swiss watchmaking industry needed to change significantly to keep pace with American competitors.left left On November 6, 2018, Longines announced the discovery by Seiji L√©pine of serial number 183 dating the watch to October 23, 1867. This is currently the Oldest Longines watch known in existence. The caliber is an August Agassiz 4 (AA4). Longines \\"Second Setting Watch\\" belonging to P.V.H. Weems Smithsonian Charles Lindbergh designs \\"Hour Angle Watch\\" = 1878‚Äì1927 = In 1878, Longines developed its first chronograph movement, the 20H. It was a ‚Äúmono-pusher‚Äù chronograph, in which all 3 chronograph functions- start, stop, and reset ‚Äì were controlled via the crown. With the 20H, Longines could produce stopwatches suitable for precise timing in professional events. This was when Longines began building its reputation in equestrian sports such as horse racing and jumping. By 1880, Longines was known for the quality and precision of its timepieces. To Francillon‚Äôs dismay, the brand became a target for counterfeiters looking to pass off cheaply-made watches as genuine Longines products. ‚ÄúKnock-offs‚Äù of Longines were not only directly stealing business and revenue from Francillon, but also potentially damaging his company‚Äôs reputation. Therefore, Francillon made the wise decision to trademark the Longines name in 1880, and distinctive winged hourglass logo in 1889. By 1886, Longines had already established itself as a primary supplier of timing equipment for most New York sporting officials. Notable Longines calibers: * Longines 20H pocket chronograph * Longines 18.72 pocket chronograph * Longines 19.73 pocket chronograph = 1927‚Äì1971 = In 1927, P.V.H. Weems collaborated with Longines to produce the first wrist watch Weems avigation watch. This watch was 47mm in diameter. In 1931, Longines collaborated with Charles Lindbergh to introduce the Hour Angle aviation watch. In 1954, Longines introduced a timekeeping instrument called Longines Chronocinegines.

Longines Weems ref 4036 c.1937 US Naval Academy Dial  Slogans  Longines began using the slogan \\"Elegance is an Attitude\\" in 1999. Their previous slogan, \\"The World's Most Honored Watch\\" was used for most of the 20th century.  Trade Mark  left The Longines Logo is the oldest registered trade mark according to the World Trade Organization.  Watch manufacturing  In December 2018, World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) released an official report giving environmental ratings for 15 major watch manufacturers and jewelers in Switzerland. Longines, along with 7 other manufacturers including Omega, Rolex and Tissot, was given the lowest environmental rating as \\"Latecomers/Non-transparent\\", suggesting that the manufacturer has taken very few actions addressing the impact of its manufacturing activities on the environment and climate change.  Notable patrons and owners  Notable Longines brand ambassadors and timepieces owners include Humphrey Bogart, Harry Connick Jr., Audrey Hepburn, Lin Chi-ling, Eddie Peng, Aishwarya Rai, Kate Winslet , Simon Baker and so on. In particular, Albert Einstein owned two timepieces from Longines, one 1943 silver pocket watch and one 1929 gold wristwatch. His Longines' wristwatch, which was presented to him by Rabbi Edgar Magnin in 1931, was auctioned by Antiquorum for US$596,000 in New York on October 16, 2008, making it the most expensive Longines' timepiece ever sold at auction. His Longines pocket watch is now kept in the Bern Historical Museum in Switzerland. * United States Navy Captain Philip Van Horn Weems * Unites States Army Air Corps Reserve Charles Lindbergh * Unites States Navy Admiral Richard E.

Packham set up Wild Justice in February 2019, a not for profit company limited by guarantee which aims to ensure that the legal system in the UK protects wildlife.  Honours and awards  In 2011 he was awarded the Dilys Breese Medal, by the British Trust for Ornithology, for his \\"outstanding work in promoting science to new audiences\\". In December 2013, Packham was made an honorary Doctor of Science by the University of Southampton, having originally graduated from the university more than 30 years earlier. In December 2014, Packham was voted \\"Conservation Hero of the Year\\" by readers of Birdwatch magazine in association with the online BirdGuides website for his work in publicising the illegal slaughter in Malta of millions of migrating birds. In October 2016 he received a Wildscreen Panda Award for Outstanding Achievement. Packham's memoir Fingers in the Sparkle Jar, published by Ebury Press in April 2017, was voted the UK's Favourite Nature Book in a poll run by the Arts and Humanities Research Council in January 2018. The BBC Two documentary Chris Packham: Asperger's and Me broadcast in October 2017 received the 2018 Broadcasting Press Guild Award for the best single documentary. In July 2018 he received an honorary doctorate from Royal Holloway, University of London, for his outstanding services to wildlife conservation. Packham was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2019 New Year Honours for services to nature conservation.  Personal life  Packham spent his early childhood in Hampshire and natural history was his main passion. He is the older brother of fashion designer Jenny Packham. He found his time at school very difficult, being socially excluded and regularly bullied by fellow pupils. In his teenage years, he was responsible for the care of a kestrel, which he took from the wild and the death of which was a severe low point in his life. At university, he embraced the punk rock scene. Packham has had M√©ni√®re's disease since his late 30s. In 2003, at the age of 42, Packham began seeing a therapist after the death of his dog. As his work with the therapist concluded in 2005, Packham was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome. He has also stated that he has suffered from severe depression. He now lives in the New Forest with his pet poodle, Scratchy. For over ten years Packham has been in a relationship with Charlotte Corney, owner of the Isle of Wight Zoo, although the couple live separately. He has a step-daughter, Megan McCubbin, a zoologist, who has appeared with him on Springwatch.  Views  In 2009, during an interview with the Radio Times, Packham suggested that the giant panda was too expensive to save and \\"should be allowed to become extinct\\" so that funds could be redistributed to protecting other animals and habitats. He made a comment, in September 2009, saying he would \\"eat the last panda\\" if doing so would retroactively redistribute the money spent on panda conservation. He later apologised for upsetting people. In 2009, 2014 and 2017, he criticised the TV show I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! for its mistreatment of animals. In an interview with The Daily Telegraph in 2010, Packham said that \\"The human population is sowing the seeds of a mass extinction event.\\" In 2017, he again expressed this view saying that if every woman could be emancipated, birth rates would drop. In 2014, he self-funded a film crew to produce a series to highlight the mass killing of migrating birds by hunters in Malta. In April 2017, he was arrested and charged with assault while filming on the Maltese island of Gozo. The case was dismissed after video footage evidence was revealed. In 2015, Packham signed a letter to MPs to block the proposed changes to amend the Hunting Act 2004. He has worked to raise awareness of the illegal persecution of birds of prey in the UK. He resigned as President of the Hawk and Owl Trust in 2015 citing \\"Personal differences over ideas of policy\\". Later in 2015 Packham wrote an article in BBC Wildlife magazine complaining about the silence of many of Britain's leading conservation organisations on the issues of fox hunting, badger culling and hen harrier persecution. This elicited a public response from the Countryside Alliance calling for the BBC to sack him. Packham organised the writing of a manifesto for UK wildlife in 2018 which he delivered to Downing Street via The Peoples Walk for Wildlife. The event raised awareness of the loss of wildlife in the UK with around 10,000 people turning up to march from Hyde Park to Downing Street.

He was Lord Mayor of London in 1642 and a prominent member of Oliver Cromwell's government. Biography Penington was the son of Robert Penington and followed him in becoming a Liveryman of the Worshipful Company of Fishmongers. He inherited several estates from his father and purchased one of his own. He made a fortune as a wine and cloth merchant. From 1626 he acted as financial agent to his second cousin, Admiral John Penington. He increased his commercial holdings in 1629 by becoming a partner in the brewery business of his second wife's family.

In 1638 Penington was elected Sheriff of London and became an alderman of the City of London for Bridge Without ward on 29 January 1639. He was Prime Warden of the Fishmongers Company in 1640. In April 1640 Penington was elected a Member of Parliament (MP) for the City of London in the Short Parliament. He was re-elected MP for City of London for the Long Parliament in November 1640 and sat until 1653. On 16 August 1642 Parliament appointed him Lord Mayor of London after removing the Royalist Sir Richard Gurney, 1st Baronet from the position. He became a Colonel of the White Regiment in 1642 and from 1642 to 1645 he was Lieutenant of the Tower of London. In that capacity he was present during the execution of William Laud. He became Governor of the Levant Company in 1644, retaining the position to 1654. In January 1649, Penington was appointed a commissioner of the High Court of Justice at the trial of King Charles, but he was not one of the signatories of the King's death warrant. He served on the Rump's Council of State and on several government committees. He was made a knight in 1649. From 1650 he was the sole representative of the City of London in the Rump Parliament until it was forcibly ejected by Oliver Cromwell on 30 April 1653. After the Restoration, he was tried for high treason and imprisoned in the Tower of London, where he died on the night of 16 December 1661.

Its postcode is 6015. A specific beach located within the suburb also has that name. All of the homes located in City Beach are expensive, modern, and contemporary. Sale price for homes are generally over 1,000,000 dollars, with the majority being between 1,500,000 and 3,000,000 dollars. City Beach consists of three sections: a northern section (bordering Scarborough), a central section (bordering Wembley Downs and Floreat) and a southern section (bordering Bold Park). The centre part was built immediately prior to the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games as an athletes' village due to its proximity to Perry Lakes Stadium in neighbouring Floreat. History In 1917, the Perth Road Board purchased the Lime Kilns Estate of , situated between the Endowment Lands and the city, thus linking with the ocean beach. The Board proposed to lay out an up-to-date seaside town near the ocean beach on garden city lines, embodying approved Town Planning principles, and making ample provision for recreation purposes. By 1928, the Board had allocated finance to commence work, and also referred to the beach as \\"City Beach\\". It appears this name developed because it was an area developed by the City Council and much more acceptable than \\"Ocean Beach\\". On 9 December 2005, City Beach Senior High School was closed by the Department of Education and Training due to a lack of new student enrolments and the opening of Shenton College 5 kilometres away in 2000. Recreation Activities could be divided into that which takes place within the suburb of City Beach and that which takes place on the same-named beach. The area contains a football/cricket oval, numerous other grassy parks, as well a large area of bush land with a walking trail. City Beach has two major beaches (Floreat Beach and the eponymous City Beach) as well as a dog beach. Each of those beaches has its own competitive surf lifesaving club with all the associated facilities. Surfing is popular in the region and City Beach commonly has reasonable surf conditions for beginner to intermediate, although the break (particularly in summer) is often a shore break that can be hazardous at times. Kitesurfing and windsurfing are also summer activities that are frequently seen at City Beach. The sand is white/yellow and soft, making it an ideal surface for the beach volleyball courts and matkot. The main swimming and surfing area is protected between two groynes and it is overlooked by lawns. There are expansive sand dunes and bushland areas along the coast, which are home to wildlife such as hawks, mice and rabbits, and the occasional dugite. These dunes are currently under repair, and should not be entered, as the presence of people startles wildlife.

It is bordered on Underwood Avenue, Selby Street, Cromarty Road and Durston Road. It is the head of the Town of Cambridge, which has its municipal offices and library in the suburb. The name of the suburb stems from the Latin word for \\"flourish\\" or \\"prosper\\", which is also the motto of the City of Perth, of which Floreat was a part when it was first built. Demographics Floreat had a population of 7,230 at the 2011 census, an increase of 205 from the 2006 census, and 277 from the 2001 census. Amenities and facilities The Floreat Forum shopping centre is located in the suburb. The varied shops include Bakers Delight, Coles, Woolworths, Best & Less, Sussan, Katies, Lorna Jane, Red Dot, Gazman, Blue Illusion, Subway, V Burger Bar and multiple cafes such as Delish, Scope Cafe and Coffee Club. It sits adjacent to the Town of Cambridge municipal offices and library. The centre also boasts a fine dining precinct and upmarket tavern. The suburb also sits adjacent to the popular Cambridge Street dining and commercial strip in neighbouring Wembley. Floreat contains a range of sporting facilities, most notably the WA Athletics Stadium (opened May 2009) and Bendat Basketball Centre (opened January 2010). Both were developed following the closure and subsequent demolition of Perry Lakes Stadium and Perry Lakes Basketball Stadium. The suburb also contains the WA Rugby Centre (home of RugbyWA), Cambridge Bowling Club, and Perry Lakes Reserve. Education Floreat contains a public primary school, a lower primary campus of a Catholic school, and a private training institution. It was previously in the catchment area for the now-closed City Beach High School; high school students now attend Churchlands Senior High School if they live north of Cambridge Street, or Shenton College if they live on the south side. Floreat Park Primary School, opened in 1951, is the only public school within the suburb's boundaries, and caters for students from kindergarten to Year 6. The Floreat campus of Newman College, a multi-campus Catholic K-12 school, is located on Peebles Road, and caters for students from kindergarten to Year 3, after which students must shift to the school's senior campuses in nearby Churchlands. The site was formerly occupied from 1962 to 1983 by Brigidine College, a Catholic girls' school, which had shifted from a prior campus in Subiaco. The current campus was formed after a merger between Brigidine College and two other local Catholic schools, Marist College and Siena College, taking effect from 1984.Brigidine College , Catholic Education Circular, March 2007, pp10-11. The Perth campus of the Australian Institute of Management is also located within the suburb. The institute provides training and qualifications in management skills; the Perth campus opened in 1987, and is situated on Birkdale Street. Politics Floreat is located in the federal electorate of Division of Curtin, currently held by Liberal MP Celia Hammond. The suburb is split between the state electorates of Churchlands, held by Sean L'Estrange, and Nedlands, held by Liberal Bill Marmion. The suburb has favoured conservative candidates throughout its history, generally those of the centre-right Liberal Party.

L√©onie Duquet (April 9, 1916, Longemaison, Doubs, France ‚Äì 1977, Argentina) was a French nun who was arrested in December 1977 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and \\"disappeared\\". She was believed killed by the military regime of Argentine President Jorge Rafael Videla during the Dirty War. Alice Domon, a French nun working with Duquet, disappeared a few days later. They had been working in poor neighborhoods of Buenos Aires in the 1970s and supported the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, founded in 1977. Despite repeated efforts by France to trace the sisters, the Argentine military dictatorship was unresponsive. In 1990 a French court in Paris tried Argentine Captain Alfredo Astiz, known to have arrested Duquet and believed implicated in the \\"disappearance\\" of Domon, for kidnapping the two sisters. He was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment in absentia. In Argentina at the time, he and other military and security officers were shielded from prosecution by Pardon Laws passed in 1986 and 1987. These were repealed in 2003 and ruled unconstitutional in 2005, and the government re-opened prosecution of war crimes. In July 2005 several bodies were found in a mass grave in General Lavalle Cemetery, 400 kilometers south of Buenos Aires. Forensic DNA testing in August identified one as Duquet's. DNA testing revealed that within the same grave were the remains of the three \\"disappeared\\" Argentine women, founders of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, who had also been missing since December 1977. Domon has not been found. Since the confirmation of Duquet's murder, France has been seeking extradition of Astiz; in 2005 he was being detained in Argentina after being indicted on charges of kidnapping and torture. Biography L√©onie Duquet was born in 1916 in Longemaison, Doubs, France, where she grew up in a Catholic family. Interested in service in the Church, she joined the Institute of Sisters in Foreign Missions Notre-Dame de la Motte as a novitiate.Agence France-Presse, \\"L√©onie Duquet, mission√°ria francesa, v√≠tima do anjo louro da morte\\" (Leonie Duquet, French missionary, victim of the 'Blond Angel of Death'\\")], Ultimo Noticias, 29 August 2005,, accessed 10 June 2013 After taking vows as a religious sister, she traveled and worked as a missionary internationally. Duquet and fellow sister Alice Domon were assigned to Argentina during the early 1970s. Duquet was dedicated to helping Argentina's poor and worked among them in Buenos Aires province as well as in the capital city. She lived and worked at the San Pablo de Ramos Mejia cathedral on the south side of the city. She became involved with the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo movement, which started in April 1977. The mothers wanted to publicize their \\"disappeared\\" children and force the government to tell them of their fates and locate them. The military dictatorship had a policy of suppressing political opposition by widespread state terrorism. Thousands of Argentine citizens who opposed the government had \\"disappeared\\", others were known to have been killed. In December 1977, Duquet was arrested and kidnapped in the parish of San Pablo Ramos Majia by Marine Captain Alfredo Astiz. This was shortly after Astiz had led a police action at the Holy Cross Church in Buenos Aires against the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, where he had arranged the arrest of Azucena Villaflor and two other of the 13 founders of the group, together with a total of ten associates. Alice Domon was kidnapped soon after. Astiz became known as the \\"Blond Angel of Death\\". one of the most infamous torturers in Argentina. The prisoners were taken to ESMA, where a secret detention and torture center had been set up. According to testimony of survivors, the sisters and other prisoners were held there about 10 days and severely tortured under interrogation. The sisters were forced to write and sign letters to the superior of their order, saying they had acted in opposition to the government of General Jorge Videla. They were photographed in front of a Montoneros banner, to appear as if they were with that guerrilla group. The photo was released to local and French press; the women showed evidence of physical torture. Soon after, all the group was \\"transferred out\\" of ESMA, which was understood to mean they were killed (Testimony of Horacio Domingo Maggio, File #4450); Testimony of Lisandro Ra√∫l Cubas, File #6794).Cap√≠tulo II, V√≠ctimas, E. Religiosos , Informe Nunca M√°s, CONADEP, 1985 L√©onie Duquet is believed to have been killed by a military death squad under Astiz' command. As neither her nor Villaflor's bodies were found, some observers thought the women may have been among victims flown by plane and helicopter and thrown out while still alive over the ocean near Buenos Aires. In early 1978, unidentified bodies began to wash up on the beaches south of Buenos Aires. The \\"disappearances\\" of Duquet and Domon, two French nationals, attracted international attention and outrage, with demands for a United Nations investigation of human rights abuses in the country. France demanded information of both the French nuns, but the Argentine government denied all responsibility for them. Despite losing some of their founders, the Mothers of the Plaza continued marching and within the year hundreds of women and family friends joined them, demanding an accounting from the government. The weekly marches and annual anniversaries of resistance stood against the government's silence about the \\"disappeared\\". Later trial and discovery In 1990, Alfredo Astiz was tried and convicted in absentia of the kidnapping of the two sisters, Duquet and Domon, by a French court in Paris and sentenced to life imprisonment. He was not charged with murder because no bodies had been found for Duquet or Domon. In July 2005, seven bodies were found in a mass grave near General Lavalle Cemetery, about 400 km south of Buenos Aires. Believing the remains were of people \\"disappeared\\" from 1976 to 1983, the democratic Argentine government ordered forensic DNA testing of the bodies. On August 28, 2005, one of the seven bodies was identified as that of L√©onie Duquet. Villaflor and two other Mothers of the Plaza were also identified among them. Domon has not been found but is presumed dead. By 2005, Astiz was being detained in Argentina at a naval facility on charges of kidnapping and torture. After passage in Argentina of the Pardon Laws in 1986 and 1987, he had been protected for a time from prosecution. He was dismissed from the military in 1998 for \\"making statements to the press defending his actions under the military dictatorship.\\" In 2003 the Argentine Congress repealed the Pardon Laws, and in 2005 the Supreme Court ruled they were unconstitutional. The government had re-opened prosecution of war crimes committed during the dictatorship. After identification of Duquet's remains, the French government was seeking extradition of Astiz to serve his sentence in France and to be tried for the murder of Duquet.  Argentine trial  During the ESMA trial, Luis Mar√≠a Mend√≠a testified in January 2007 before the Argentine tribunal that a French intelligence agent, Bertrand de Perseval, had participated in the abduction of Duquet and Domon. Perseval, who lives today in Thailand, has denied any links with the abduction of the nuns. He has admitted to being a former member of the Organisation arm√©e secr√®te (OAS) operated by the French in Algeria during the civil war and said he went to Argentina after the March 1962 √âvian Accords ended the Algerian War (1954‚Äì62). French intelligence agents have long been suspected of having trained Argentine counterparts in \\"counter-insurgency\\" techniques (including the use of torture in investigations). Marie Monique Robin's TV documentary, The Death Squads ‚Äì the French School (Les escadrons de la mort ‚Äì l'√©cole fran√ßaise, 2003), based on her book, documented that the French intelligence services had trained Argentine counterparts in counter-insurgency techniques. During his testimony, Luis Mar√≠a Mendia referred to the film as evidence, and asked that the Argentine Court require former French president Giscard d'Estaing, former French premier Messmer, former French ambassador to Buenos Aires Fran√ßois de la Gorce, and all officials in place in the French embassy in Buenos Aires between 1976 and 1983 to be summoned before the court for their part in the abuses.\\"Disparitions : un ancien agent fran√ßais mis en cause\\", Le Figaro, 6 February 2007 Besides this French connection, he said the former head of state Isabel Per√≥n and former ministers Carlos Ruckauf and Antonio Cafiero, who signed the \\"anti-subversion decrees\\" before Videla's 1976 coup d'√©tat, had set up the policy and mechanism for state terrorism. ESMA survivor Graciela Daleo characterized Mend√≠a's allegations as a tactic to justify his crimes as legitimate. Under the 1987 Obediencia Debida Act, passed under pressure by the military, lower-level military and security personnel could not be prosecuted for carrying out orders. Similarly, Mend√≠a said he and others had obeyed Isabel Per√≥n's \\"anti-subversion decrees\\" (giving them a formal appearance of legality, although torture was forbidden by the Argentine Constitution).Impart√≠ √≥rdenes que fueron cumplidas, P√°gina/12, February 2, 2007 The 1986 and 1987 Pardon Laws had been repealed in 2003, and ruled unconstitutional by the Argentine Supreme Court in 2005. By the time of Mend√≠a's trial, this legislation provided no protection to him and others indicted for crimes committed under the military dictatorship. In 2012, an Argentinian prosecutor filed charges against Julio Alberto Poch (es), a Dutch- Argentinian pilot, for flying the helicopter that carried the bodies of Domon, Duquet and three other women to be dumped into the Atlantic Ocean.\\"Argentine Denies Taking Part in Dirty War-Era ‚ÄúDeath Flights‚Äù\\", Latin American Herald Tribune, 27 November 2012 References External links *\\"L√©onie Duquet, mission√°ria francesa, v√≠tima do anjo louro da morte\\", Noticias (Use Google Translate to read article in English) Category:1916 births Category:1977 deaths Category:People from Doubs Category:Extrajudicial killings Category:People killed in the Dirty War Category:French people murdered abroad Category:People murdered in Argentina Category:False flag operations Category:Women in war in South America Category:Women in warfare post-1945 ","title":"L√©onie Duquet"},{"id":"2590897","text":"Mats Olle G√∂ran S√∂derlund (born 25 July 1967), better known by his stage name G√ºnther, is a Swedish singer-songwriter.

These devices are no longer used for power or punishment, and the term \\"treadmill\\" has come to mean an exercise machine for running or walking in place..

Three of the main ponds are now large freshwater bathing/swimming ponds: two designated single sex (male/female Highgate #2 & Highgate #5 respectively); and one for mixed bathing (Hampstead #3). The bathing ponds aren't the only special-use ponds however, Highgate #3 pond is the Model Boating Pond and it, along with a few other ponds, are open to anglers. A number of the other ponds are set aside as wildlife reserves or are purely ornamental (such as the more minor Viaduct Pond). In 2004, the City of London Corporation, which holds the Heath in trust since the abolition of the Greater London Council in 1986, tried to close the bathing ponds on the grounds that they were an unsustainable drain on their expenses and posed a health risk to swimmers. The swimmers challenged this and won a victory in the High Court. To defray costs, the Corporation introduced a charge for admission of ¬£2 per session, ¬£1 for concessions. There was some opposition to this on the grounds that swimming there had been free since at least the 1920s, and some ticket machines were vandalised. Hampstead ponds Hampstead Pond #1, Southernmost western pond on the Heath.The Hampstead Ponds consist of three ponds on the Heath's southwest corner, towards South End Green. Hampstead Pond #3 is the mixed bathing pond, where both sexes may swim (angling prohibited). Hampstead ponds #1 is strictly a nature/wildlife pond and Hampstead pond #2 permits angling. Directly northwest of the mixed bathing pond is the \\"Viaduct Pond\\" and west of that is the Vale of Health pond; these are arguably within the flow of the \\"Hampstead ponds\\", but aren't officially members of the group. Highgate ponds Highgate #1 pond is a nature reserve pond on Hampstead Heath. Highgate Ponds are a series of eight former reservoirs, on the heath's east (Highgate) side, and were originally dug in the 17th and 18th centuries.CIX.co.UK: Hampstead Heath Ponds They include two single-sex swimming pools (the men's and ladies' bathing ponds), a model boating pond, and two ponds which serve as wildlife reserves: the Stock Pond and the Bird Sanctuary Pond. Angling is allowed in some of the ponds, although this may be threatened by proposals to modify the dams. The ponds are the result of the 1777 damming of Hampstead Brook (one of the Fleet River's sources), by the Hampstead Water Company, which was formed in 1692 to meet London's growing water demands. \\"Boudicca's Mound\\", near the present men's bathing pond, is a tumulus where, according to local legend, Queen Boudicca (Boadicea) was buried after she and 10,000 Iceni warriors were defeated at Battle Bridge. London, Rob Humphreys, Rough Guides Ltd, 2004, However, historical drawings and paintings of the area show no mound other than a 17th-century windmill. Swimming ponds Hampstead Heath's Men's bathing pond (Highgate #2 pond), facing North.Hampstead has three different ponds for swimming: one for men, one for women and one mixed. Only swimmers over eight years of age are allowed; those between eight and 15 years old must be in the care of an adult. Winter swimming is sometimes available at the ponds, which remain popular with users. The men's pond had a diving tower, but this was dismantled following an accident in the 1970s and only a low level board remains, along with showers and a small sunbathing and changing area. Quality of water tests ‚Äî which comply with EU regulations ‚Äî are routinely performed on all three swimming ponds, and results are available through the official City of London website. The three ponds are not to be confused with Parliament Hill Lido, built in 1938, now with a stainless steel lining. In December 2017, the City of London corporation, in charge of running the pools, confirmed that transgender women are allowed to use the women's pool per the Equality Act 2010. Julie Bindel, who uses the pond regularly, criticised the decision to be welcoming towards trans women, although reaction was more positive from other groups.https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/09/debate-over-inclusion-of- trans-women-in-women-only-spaces- intensifieshttps://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/transgender-women- hampstead-heath-ladies-pond-kenwood-kate-moss-a8136581.html Twenty-first century work on dams In 2011, it was announced that the City of London was proposing extensive works on the ponds and dams, which it claimed were necessary for safety reasons in the event of a rare major storm. The proposals included measures to improve the water quality of the ponds as well as improvements to the pipes and weirs that allow water to cascade from one pond to the other. These initial recommendations followed engineers' reports in 2005 that the hydrology of the ponds was poorly understood. These same engineering reports resulted in engineering works in 2006 on the two ponds in the grounds of Kenwood House, to make their overflow structures and dams safer. There was strong opposition from the swimming clubs and the Protect Our Ponds campaign. In 2013 a united campaign was launched called Dam Nonsense to oppose the works, which the campaign claimed unnecessary and in conflict with the Hampstead Heath Act 1871. The campaign included all the groups opposed to the proposals. The work on the Hampstead Heath dams was further complicated by the regulations embodied in the 1975 Reservoir Act, which only relate to three dams on the Heath, and the regulations under the Flood and Water Management Act 2010 which potentially relate to all 14 dams on the Heath. The Heath and Hampstead Society took the engineering decisions of the City of London to judicial review in November 2014: the interpretation of the 1975 Reservoir Act was challenged and thereby the nature of the proposed engineering works to the dams. The case was heard by The Honourable Mrs Justice Lang (DBE) and a ruling, in favour of the City of London, was issued on 28 November 2014 (case number CO/4175/2014). The judgement also addressed the status of the proposed engineering works relative to the provisions of the 1871 Act, again ruling that the engineers had shown due consideration for the provisions of the Act. The work went ahead and raised the height of the dams, in the case of the dam above the Men's Swimming Pond by 18 feet. The City of London Corporation said the work should be carried out urgently to reduce danger of flooding in surrounding built-up residential areas in the event of one of the dams bursting. The initial estimate of the number of lives which might be lost, in the event of a dam collapse in an extreme flood event, was over 2000 (2006 estimate). This figure has been reduced to less than 400, still a large number. However the chance of such an event is one in 400,000 years.Ponds and dams , City of London Corporation. The regulated dams under the 1975 Reservoir Act are the Model Pond and the Men's Bathing Pond in the Highgate Chain. Highgate Number 1 pond would have been covered by the Act but the water level was lowered by the GLC in 1984. In the Hampstead chain, Hampstead Number 1 pond is also regulated under the 1975 Act. Location The men and women's ponds are on the eastern side of the park, off Millfield Lane. The mixed bathing pond is in the centre of the Heath, and is a 10-15 minute walk from Hampstead Heath railway station and from South End Green, at the junction of Pond Street and East Heath Road, which is served by several bus routes.

It has three platforms and a small bus station, and lies at the junction of the former North Midland Railway main line between Rotherham Masborough and Leeds via Cudworth and the former South Yorkshire Railway line to Doncaster.  History  There have been three stations on the North Midland Railway line at Swinton, the first of which, opened in 1840, built by the N.M.R. occupied the site of the present station, goods facilities occupying what is now the car park. This was replaced by a second station north of the present site, on the opposite side of the road bridge, built by the Midland Railway. This station became known as Swinton Town to distinguish it from Swinton Central on the former Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway line. It was served by stopping trains from Sheffield Midland to York and to Leeds City via Cudworth. The station closed in January 1968 with the rationalisation of local rail services in South Yorkshire. The original station buildings still remain at street level and are used for light industry.  Redevelopment and rebuilding  By the late 1980s it was realised that South Yorkshire railways had been cut back too far in the 1960s; in particular, Swinton/Wath-upon-Dearne/Kilnhurst lacked a station. The South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Authority put forward a four-year plan for the improvement of services and stations as part of their Rail Development Plan, this leading to the re-instatement of the \\"Swinton Curve\\", from the former North Midland Railway at Swinton to the former South Yorkshire Railway at Mexborough West Junction, the building of a new station at Swinton and the re- routing of all passenger trains via this route. Immediately after reopening by British Rail in 1990 it was unstaffed, but increased passenger usage led to the establishment in the 1990s of initially a small cabin staffed for the morning peak period only. The cabin later was replaced by a brick building for the ticket office, waiting room and toilet. It is also an interchange for local bus services to Wath and Manvers. The ticket office is now manned on Mondays to Saturday between 07:00 and 13:30. Outside these hours, passengers can buy tickets (or a permit to travel) from a ticket vending machine near the station entrance (card payments only). Shelters and passenger information screens are located on each platform, with a fully accessible footbridge linking the ticket hall with platforms 2 and 3.Swinton (South Yorks) station facilities National Rail Enquiries; Retrieved 7 December 2016 Services The station has a similar service level to neighbouring Rotherham Central, namely two trains per hour to Doncaster (one extending to Adwick), one per hour to Leeds via Moorthorpe and three per hour to Sheffield. The thrice-daily Dearne Valley local service to York also calls. The station sits on the main North East - South West corridor which means various express services and freight trains pass through. Sundays have an hourly services to Doncaster and Leeds, two trains to York and two trains per hour to Sheffield. Services are generally formed of Arriva Northern Class 142 and Class 144 'Pacer' DMU's; with Class 150, Class 153 and Class 158 also appearing on certain services (these have become increasingly common here since the summer of 2019, as the Pacers are now being withdrawn from service). Upon the May 2018 timetable change, Swinton no longer has direct trains to Scunthorpe or Lincoln, and the two Transpennine Express services that previously called here now pass through non-stop. The Hull stopping trains also ceased at the winter 2019 timetable change, so passengers now have to change at Doncaster for onward connections.

History Lynwood was first settled by Henry Willett of Willett & Co, who was granted Canning Location 21 on the Canning River (which included nearby Parkwood) and settled in the area in June 1832. In November 1964, the Shire of Canning proposed the names \\"Burtsdale\\" and \\"Willetton\\" for Willetton and Lynwood/Parkwood respectively, the name Burtsdale honouring Septimus Burt, who purchased the land in 1882. In August 1965, developers at Lynwood requested the name \\"Clovercrest Estate\\", but finally agreed to \\"Lynwood\\". The name Willetton was shifted westwards and Lynwood was gazetted in December 1965. Parkwood was part of Lynwood until 1993. In the 1960s and 1970s, Lynwood and neighbouring Parkwood were largely settled by new migrants from the United Kingdom who arrived in Perth seeking economic prosperity.

Its postcode is 6107. There is 6,853 persons living in Queens Park. The top 5 ancestries represented in the suburb were English, Chinese, Australian, Indian and Filipino. The majority of persons living in Queens Park were between the ages of 18 and 49 (school leavers, university students, young workforce and parents and home builders).  Pre colonial history  Queens Park, prior to colonial interactions, was originally cared for by the Whadjuk Noongar people, the traditional owners for the areas along the Djarlgarro Beeliar or Canning River (Western Australia) Prior to the colonial settlement of the area, the Canning River and its associated wetlands provided an important source of food and shelter to the Beeliar and Beeloo Noongar people. The Beeloo considered north of the Canning River, Dyarlgarro, to the hills as part of their ground while the Beeliar mainly traversed the southern section of the river to the sea. At the time of colonial settlement, Midgegooroo and Munday were leaders of these people. The Cannington-Wilson area was called ‚ÄòBeeloo‚Äô for many years by local residents.  Post colonial history  The suburb derives its name from the former Queens Park Road Board that was incorporated into the Canning and Belmont Road Boards.Carden, F.G. Along the Canning: A History of the City of Canning, City of Canning, 1st Edition 1968, 2nd edition, 1991. Queens Park was originally known as Woodlupine. The name change was brought about following a murder in 1911. Local residents and authorities feared the incident could jeopardise the development of the area. It was agreed that the name would be changed to Queens Park to honour Queen Alexandra, wife of King Edward VII. = Sister Kate Children Home = The largest single land-holder in Queens Park was Sister Kate's children's home which was founded by Sister Kate in 1934 and expanded in 1936 which at the time, A. O. Neville, the government Chief Protector of Aboriginals was the architect of an official scheme which oversaw the care, custody and education of Aboriginal and half-caste children under 16 years in the state. The scheme's purpose was to integrate young and part Aboriginal children into white society by separating them from their families.https://storylines.slwa.wa.gov.au/archive-store/view/16/303 From an Indigenous perspective, Sister Kate's was a 'home' where children from the Stolen Generations were sent after being literally kidnapped from their parents and family. As the aspiration of Sister Kate was to open a home for half-caste Aboriginal children, for \\"the most poorest and neglected children\\", she was authorised to open her home in 1933 by Western Australia's notorious Chief Protector of Aborigines, A. O. Neville, specifically for light skinned Aboriginal children. This was for the explicit aim of destroying the children's Aboriginal identity and assimilating them in white society, i.e. to \\"breed out the black\\" and eliminate Aboriginal culture in Western Australia. Sister Kate died in 1946, and after her death her so-called 'home' degenerated from a manipulative, evil place which attempted to brainwash kidnapped children into hating their own parents and culture, into a hell on Earth where children were routinely abused both physically and sexually - still with the aim of destroying Aboriginal culture. The process by which the separation was done has since been widely condemned when a report entitled Bringing Them Home was published in 1997 following a federal government inquiry.

Its local government area is the City of Canning. History Willetton's name derives from Henry Willett of Willett & Co, who was granted Canning Location 21 (roughly the location of modern Lynwood and Parkwood) and settled in the area in June 1832. In November 1964, the Shire of Canning proposed the names \\"Burtsdale\\" and \\"Willetton\\" for Willetton and Lynwood/Parkwood respectively, the name Burtsdale honouring Septimus Burt, who purchased the land in 1882. In August 1965, developers at Lynwood requested the name \\"Clovercrest Estate\\", but finally agreed to \\"Lynwood\\". The name Willetton was shifted westwards and gazetted in December 1965 within its present boundaries. The original subdivision was opened in the early 1970s under the developer's name \\"Burrendah Heights\\". This name survives as Burrendah Boulevard and Burrendah Primary School. The section to the east of Vahland Avenue and north of Collins Road was developed in the 1980s under the unofficial name \\"Rostrata\\". Most housing and infrastructure was completed in the 1990s. Geography Willetton is located about south of the Perth central business district. It is built on a section of flat sandy coastal plain that was originally covered with open Banksia woodland and stands of paperbark trees marking the edges of shallow seasonal swamps. Willetton is bounded by Karel Avenue to the west, Leach Highway and High Road to the north, Willeri Drive to the east and South Street and Roe Highway to the south. Vahland Avenue runs north-south through the suburb.2006 StreetSmart directory, Department of Lands and Surveys, Perth. At the 2001 Australian census, Willetton had a mostly average-income population of 17,571 people living in 6,300 dwellings, nearly all of which are detached houses on single lots. The Australian Bureau of Statistics reported that almost 20% of the suburb's population were of East, Southeast or South Asian origin. Retail trade (1,515), property and business services (1,118), manufacturing (944), education (911), and health and community services (904) were the key occupations of Willetton's residents. Facilities Willetton contains the Southlands Boulevarde shopping centre, with two levels and businesses including two supermarkets, Hoyts cinemas and a food court. A light industrial area exists in the north of the suburb near Leach Highway and High Road, containing a Bunnings, pool shops and various trades. Three small neighbourhood shopping centres offer local services in the corners of the suburb. Adjacent to Willetton on High Road, the Riverton Leisureplex, a large facility with sporting, fitness and recreation facilities opened on 9 November 2001,Riverton Leisureplex - City Of Canning is operated by the City of Canning, and includes the council's largest library. The Willetton Library is located near Southlands Boulevarde. Willetton contains the Castlereagh, Burrendah, Willetton, Rostrata and Orana Catholic primary schools, as well as Woodthorpe School and Willetton Senior High School, the largest public high school in Western Australia, with nearly 2350 students. Transport Willetton is situated between two major east-west routes - Leach Highway (west to the Bull Creek railway station, Kwinana Freeway to Perth's central business district and Fremantle; east to Cannington and Perth Airport) and South Street (west to Murdoch railway station, Murdoch University and Fremantle; east to Canning Vale and Armadale). Roe Highway is on the southeastern fringe of the suburb, while Karel Avenue (to Jandakot Airport), Vahland Avenue and Willeri Drive are major north-south routes. Willetton contains the Southlands bus station, where the CircleRoute takes passengers to Murdoch railway station, Murdoch University and Curtin University, while other bus routes go to Cannington. All services are operated by the Public Transport Authority. Politics Historically it has been fairly safe for the Liberal Party at both Federal and state elections, although three of the suburb's four booths delivered majorities to the Labor Party at state level in 2001 and 2005. In 2008 it returned a Liberal member to parliament by a very slim majority. By the 2017 state election, despite the Liberal Party winning only 13 of 59 seats, the Liberal Party won all four booths in Willetton. The suburb is located within the Federal Division of Tangney, the State seat of Riverton and the Beeliar ward of the City of Canning.

S. Baburaj, was a Malayalam music composer. He is often credited for the renaissance of Malayalam film music. Baburaj has rendered music to many evergreen Malayalam film songs. Early years Baburaj was born on 9 March 1929 in Kozhikode, then known as Calicut. His early childhood was spent in destitution and poverty. His father, Jan Muhammed Khan, who was a Hindustani musician from Bengal who frequently held concerts in Kerala, deserted his Malayali mother when he was very young, and returned to his native Kolkata. Baburaj thus became fatherless, often singing songs in trains to make a living. But as luck would have it, a policeman, Kunjumuhammed (he was called Kunjumuhammed ika), an enthusiast of music from his native town of Kozhikode, noticing the boy's vocal talents, decided to virtually adopt him. Music career One of his greatest achievements was the introduction of Hindustani strains into Malayalam popular music. He successfully composed melodies based on Hindustani Ragas and blended Malayalam lyrics into them. Most of the lyrics were written by eminent Malayalam poets like P. Bhaskaran and Vayalar. Baburaj learned basic lessons of Hindustani music from his father from a very young age, but he could not learn it for long due to his father's demise. In search of pure music, young Baburaj visited West Bengal, Mumbai and Sri Lanka. He learned to play the Harmonium during this period. He came back to Kerala to a precarious existence. He sang on the streets of Kozhikode to earn his livelihood. Police constable Kunju Muhammed, who was a fan of Baburaj's father, adopted him and brought him up. Later he started composing music for the Malayalam dramas in the Malabar region and thus slowly entered the field of music direction. In 1957, he composed music for the Malayalam film Minnaminungu, by Ramu Kariat, thus entering the Malayalam film industry. Then he worked with director P. Venu and composed classic songs like \\"Anuragaganam Pole\\", \\"Ezhuthiyatharanu Sujatha\\", and \\"Kalichirimaaratha Penne\\" for the film Udhyogastha (1967). Baburaj was also an accomplished singer and harmonium player. Baburaj died an early death, on 7 October 1978 at the age of 49. His death occurred in a general hospital in Madras. He was survived by his wife and children. Legacy The Baburaj ‚Äì P. Bhaskaran ‚Äì Yesudas combination produced many of the most memorable Malayalam tunes of the 1960s and 1970s. Most of his classic duets were sung by K. J. Yesudas and S. Janaki, each recording solo Baburaj compositions as well. Many of Baburaj's songs remain very popular in Kerala, with songs like \\"Oru Pushpam Maatram\\" frequently rendered on stage at various events. The Manorama Music company chanced upon an old audio cassette of Baburaj rendering some of his own compositions in a platform of friends' circle. The cassette named 'Baburaj Padunnu' was re-mixed and became an instant hit. The tracks gave Kerala a rejuvenated taste of Baburaj's music with his unique style of soulful singing. Though a successful composer, Baburaj was never a careerist, but kept his focus on his art. Today, various clubs and musical organisations conduct stage programs in honour of Baburaj ('Babukka' to his friends and acquaintances), and give the proceeds to his family. During his time, money was not easy to come by for artists, and Baburaj never managed to earn much, dying in poverty. \\"Thrikkakkare theerthakkare\\" in the 1978 film Yagaswam, directed by Hariharan, was his last recorded song.

He was a prolific author and indefatigable traveler. His main achievement was to link and finance networks of intellectuals across the globe, especially Christian leaders in Asia and the Middle East. He enabled missionaries to better understand and even think like the people they were serving. His long-term impact on the Protestant communities in the United States, and in the Third World, was long lasting. From the 1930s onwards, he became a Christian socialist.  Biography  = Early life and family = George Sherwood Eddy was born on January 19, 1871 to George Alfred Eddy and Margaret Louise Norton at Leavenworth, Kansas. His father George Eddy was a leading businessman and civic leader; he and his wife Margaret were of Yankee stock, The son attended Phillips Andover Academy, and graduated Yale College in engineering in 1891. Eddy married Alice Maud Harriet Arden (1873-1945) on November 10, 1898. They were the parents of two children, Margaret and Arden. After his first wife's death, he married Catherine Louise Gates in 1946.Yale University Divinity School Library, biographical sketch for Eddy's archived papers Retrieved April 15, 2013 =Career= Sherwood Eddy & Sun Yat-Sen in Canton Eddy had had a religious experience in 1889 at the Northfield conference. Therefore, after completing his engineering training he attended Union Theological Seminary (1891-1893) in New York. He also enlisted in the Student Volunteer Movement, which sought to \\"evangelize the world in this generation\\" and worked on the staff of a local Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA). In 1893-1894 he served as a traveling secretary for the Student Volunteer Movement in the United States. Eddy's father died in 1894, leaving him an inheritance that made him financially independent and enabled him to work for the causes he believed in without concern for finances. He then attended Princeton Theological Seminary, from which he graduated in 1896. In spite of his theology studies he always kept to his line to serve as a committed layman and a missionary. Eddy was one of the first of sixteen thousand student volunteers who emerged from the leading universities of the U.S. and Europe to serve as Christian missionaries across the world. In 1896, he went to India and worked at the YMCA-organized Indian Student Volunteer Movement. He served as its secretary for the next 15 years. Working among the poor and outcasts of India he mastered the Tamil language and served as a traveling evangelist among the students and masses of southern India beginning in Palamcottah. In 1911, he was appointed secretary for Asia by the International Committee and he divided his time between evangelistic campaigns in Asia and fund-raising in North America.Michael G. Thompson, \\"Sherwood Eddy, the Missionary Enterprise, and the Rise of Christian Internationalism in 1920s America,\\" Modern Intellectual History 12#1 (April 2015), 65-93. He is also known today for his works with the Oxford Group evangelical group, a predecessor to Alcoholics Anonymous. He spent the next 15 years doing student evangelistic work across Asia - from China, Japan, and the Philippines, through the Near East to Turkey, Palestine, Iraq, Egypt, and then to czarist Russia and made 15 trips to the Soviet Russia. He admired the Soviet system and refused to believe reports of famine; in 1937 he agreed that the victims of Stalin's show trials were traitors as charged. His was criticized as a \\"fellow traveler.\\"Dallas (2000)Paul Hollander, Political Pilgrims: Travels of Western Intellectuals to the Soviet Union, China, and Cuba, 1928-1978 (1981) From 1915 to 1917, he was itinerant secretary of the YMCAs with the British and American armed forces in France. In 1916, he received two honorary degrees, one from Wooster College and the other from Yale University. From 1921 to 1957, he conducted training courses for religious, political and business leaders in England and America; he addressed 1500 American leaders. = After the YMCA and end of life = Poster announcing a public forum to be held in Des Moines, Iowa, at which Sherwood Eddy would speak to the theme \\"America and the world crisis\\" (between 1936 and 1940). In 1931, Sherwood Eddy stopped his career with the YMCA where he had spent 35 years as a volunteer. He had become a member of the Fellowship of Socialist Christians which was organized in the early 1930s by Reinhold Niebuhr and others on the left. Later it changed its name to Frontier Fellowship and then to Christian Action. The main supporters of the Fellowship in the early days included Eddy, Eduard Heimann, Paul Tillich and Rose Terlin. In its early days the group thought capitalist individualism was incompatible with Christian ethics. Although not under Communist control, the group acknowledged Karl Marx's social philosophy. In 1936, he founded and led with Reverend Sam H. Franklin the Delta and Providence Cooperative Farms in Bolivar County, Mississippi, and Holmes County, Mississippi, in 1939, respectively. The farms helped southern sharecroppers out of their economic plight (caused in part by side effects of the New Deal's Agricultural Adjustment Administration).Smith, Fred C. (2004). \\"Cooperative Farming in Mississippi.\\" Mississippi Historical Society. Eddy drew considerable support from his friend, the theologian Reinhold Niebuhr, who once called the farms \\"the most significant experiment in social Christianity now being conducted in America.\\" These cooperatives were organized around four principles: efficiency of production and finance through the cooperative principle, participation in the construction of an economy of socialized abundance, interracial justice and realistic religion as a social dynamicFranklin, Sam H. Delta Cooperative Farm, pamphlet 1936.. Because of its principles of economic equality between races, the cooperative paid all its members equal pay for equal work. Activities included cotton growing, cattle breeding, a pasteurization plant and a sawmill. Co-operatives also provided a variety of services to their members and surrounding communities, including a co-op store, a credit union, a medical clinic, educational programs, a library, religious services and summer student camps. Due to the tense political climate of the 1950s and poor cotton prices and sales volumes, the experiment ended around 1956 and the land was sold to the cooperative's members. In 1949, Sherwood Eddy moved to Jacksonville, Illinois and taught at Illinois College and MacMurray College. He died on November 4, 1963 in Jacksonville.  Influence  In 1897, Sherwood Eddy experienced a personal and spiritual crisis that profoundly changed his vision of missionary work. He understood that his argumentative, apologetic approach could not be very successful because it created a defensive attitude among his listeners; he wrote: \\"we were not sent to win debates but to win people\\"; he understood that the elites were not the right way in but that he had to address the ordinary people and, in 1900, he took almost two years off to learn Tamil; he understood that the local people and those who had come as missionaries had to be treated on a strictly equal footing: he was among the first to understand the aspirations of colonized peoples for self-determination and the need to appoint local leaders to lead local churches. In doing so, he anticipated by nearly 50 years, and initiated, the reflection that would lead the American Presbyterian Mission to thoroughly review its concepts, mainly after 1945. In 1903, Sherwood Eddy founded with Anglican Bishop V.S. Azariah the first purely Indian Mission Society of Tinnevelly and in 1905 the National Missionary Society of India. Sherwood Eddy was the only non-Indian present at its founding conference in Serampore. Because of his perfect command of Tamil and his deep empathy for the Indians, he was considered one of them, which he described as one of the greatest compliments he ever received. Professor Rick Nutt considers that this initiative played a role in the emergence of Indian national sentiment. The NMS was also ecumenical as it brought together members from all Protestant churches in South India. It showed the way for churches that then also sought unity. In 1908 the South India United Church regrouped the Presbyterian and Congregationalist churches of South India, but efforts to integrate the Anglican faith into the union were unsuccessful until September 1947 when the Church of South India was created, bringing together the Anglican, Methodist, Congregationalist, Presbyterian and Reformed communities. Sherwood Eddy appears there as a pioneer of ecumenism between Protestant churches; although this had been the YMCA's policy since their inception, the merger of actual churches in India was one of the first achievements of this type ever. From 1911 onwards, Sherwood Eddy and the YMCA missionaries led an effective evangelization in China based on the convictions and methods established in India. Missionary H. G. Lockwood noted in 1949 at a meeting with Chinese Christian leaders that the majority of them had been won to Christianity by Sherwood Eddy. Like Frank Buchman, Sherwood Eddy insisted on the need for missionaries to adopt exemplary moral behaviour.

It is administered by Greater Warangal Municipal Corporation.  History  The great kings of Kakatiya dynasty left their marks in the state of Telangana for over several centuries. The famous fort of Warangal and the Thousand Pillared Temple. It has come to light that the original capital of Kakatiya Kings was not Warangal; they in fact had shifted the capital to Warangal for reasons unknown. It could probably be strategically ideal for a King to run his empire from the hill fort of Warangal. Hanmakonda or Hanumakonda or Anmakonda is a short distance from the north of Warangal, and may be the ancient suburb of Warangal. Hanamkonda was the older capital of the Kakatiya kings before they actually shifted the new capital to Warangal during the reign of Ganapati Deva. The district around it was called Sabbi sayira or Sabbi one thousand which was a part of the empire of Kalyani. The land of Hanmakonda was also referred to as Anmakonda Vishaya. However, the actual Sanskrit name was supposed to be Hanumnadachala or the Hill of Hanumat (Hanuman), the famous follower of the hero of Ramayana, Lord Rama. The most breath-taking feature of Anmakonda is the hill is the thousand pillar temple built by King Rudra in 1163 CE. Warangal eventually replaced Anmakonda' as the new city during the time of Ganapati Deva. Warangal was actually the corrupted term or the later name for Ekasaila, which means ‚Äòone rock.‚Äô In the Sanskrit texts the name sees a literal translation of Orugallu as ', whose again original form was Ekasailanagara. The Telugu form of the name is Orumgallu. The city was prosperous needless to say. In the time before Ganapati deva, the city of Warangal occupied a menial position but it was finally king Rudra I who further popularized the city by his work. It was provided with a stone wall by Rudra‚Äôs nephew and successor Ganapati. The fortifications of the city were finally completed by the daughter and successor Rudramma devi. From the onset of 14th century, the city had to face successive wars under the hands of Tugluq dynasty. Mohammed bin Tugluq took it in 1323 CE and again renamed the place as Sultanpur. Finally the city‚Äôs pride was lost upon the rising of Bahamani sultanate and shifting of capitals to Golconda in Hyderabad. Hanumakonda is the first constituency won by BJP  Climate  As Hanmakonda is located in the semi-arid region of Telangana, it has a hot and dry climate. Summer starts in March and continues through mid-June. The monsoon arrives in June and lasts until September. Winter starts in mid-October and lasts until early February.  Culture  Padmakshi Temple, believed to have been built during the first quarter of the 12th century, is a temple at Warangal with Goddess Padmakshi as the main deity. Thousand Pillar Temple was built during the period of the Kakatiya dynasty, and later destroyed by Muslim invaders. The temple called the Trikutalayam, dedicated to Shiva, Vishnu, and Surya. Bhadrakali Temple at Hanmakonda is a significant Goddess Bhadrakali temple located on the hilltop.  Education  Kakatiya University is an autonomous educational institution, approved under Universities Grant Commission scheme. Major universities and educational institutions of the area include, National Institute of Technology, Kakatiya University, University Arts and Science College, Kakatiya Medical College. .

Devarajan or Devarajan master, was an Indian music composer. He is considered one of the greatest music directors in Indian film music arena. He scored music for more than three hundred Malayalam films, many dramas, and twenty Tamil and four Kannada movies. Many of his compositions remain ever green classics in Malayalam. His music in the Tamil film Annai Velankanni has received many accolades. Devarajan received Kerala Government's Best Music Director award five times, among other honours. He is regarded as the greatest music composer ever in the history of Malayalam cinema. Early life Born at Paravur, Kollam district in Kerala to mridangam vidwan Kochu Govindan Asan and Kochukunju as their eldest son, Devarajan performed his first classical concert at the age of 18. He was soon attracted to the Communist movement and decided to dedicate his creative energy to popular music. He joined the once famous drama troupe of Kerala, the Kerala People's Arts Club (KPAC). The work that brought him to the limelight was the drama song titled \\"Ponnarivaal ambiliyil kanneriyunnoole\\", written by his friend O. N. V. Kurup and composed and sung by himself. KPAC and its members had a distinctive leaning towards the communist ideology, and their dramas played a role in spreading the ideology among the Keralite masses. Through his compositions, Devarajan would cast an indelible imprint in the Malayali theatre arena, especially after the famous KPAC drama Ningalenne Communistaakki, written by Thoppil Bhasi in 1952. Film career The first movie for which he composed music was Kaalam Maarunnu (1955). He teamed up with poet-lyricist Vayalar Ramavarma in Chathurangam in 1959. His third movie ‚Äì and the second with Vayalar ‚Äì Bharya (1962) became a huge hit and made them a popular combination.http://msidb.org/processSearch.php?db=moviesongs&musician;=G%20Devarajan&lyricist;=Vayalar His music earned him pride of place among those who had striven to earn a dignified status for film songs. His collaborations with Vayalar produced the golden era of Malayalam film music. Devarajan is remembered by prominent singers in Malayalam like K. J. Yesudas and Jayachandran as their Godfather. In fact, it was the compositions by him that brought laurels to the main singers of that age. Devarajan was at one point regarded as the doyen of film music in South India. He was much respected by all musicians and singers of that period, for his sound knowledge in classical music. It might be due to this dominance he had over others that he was widely known as arrogant. But he enjoyed a royal status till his death among the music circles. Devarajan was the one who used the most number of raagas in Malayalam film music. His music embraced different styles with the Carnatic and Hindustani melody lines meeting folk idioms and Western harmony. Despite being a strong atheist, he composed devotional songs like \\"Harivarasanam\\", \\"Guruvayoor Ambalanadayil\\", \\"Chethi Mandaram Thulasi\\", and \\"Nithyavishudhayam Kanyamariyame\\", which are considered classics in that genre. Also, he is particularly noted for his remarkable ability to blend the words of the lyrics with the mood of the situation in his film song compositions. Most of his hit songs were written by Vayalar Ramavarma and the combination of Vayalar-Devarajan-P Susheela-Yesudas was synonymous with beautiful songs. The Vayalar-Devarajan combine proved the most successful team till the death of Vayalar in the mid 1970s. Hundreds of songs contributed by the team are still part of Malayalis' nostalgia. Apart from Vayalar, he has also given tunes to lyrics by other eminent poets and songwriters like O. N. V. Kurup, P. Bhaskaran, and Sreekumaran Thampi. A complete work of Devarajan, Devageethikal, composed by himself, has released and the book is published by Authentic books. Devarajan died of a massive heart attack at his residence in Chennai at 12:30 AM IST on 15 March 2006. He was 78 at the time of his death, and was survived by his wife, two children - a daughter (elder) and a son (younger) - and some grandchildren. His body was taken airway to Thiruvananthapuram, and was cremated with state honors at Nehru Park in Paravur, his hometown.

The aircraft was intended to compete in a competition proposed by the Daniel Guggenheim Fund for the Promotion of Aeronautics - the Guggenheim Safe Aircraft Competition. The original working name for the aircraft was the Guggenheim Competition Biplane. The name Gugnunc was at first unofficial, coming from the Pip, Squeak and Wilfred newspaper cartoon (in the Daily Mirror and later in silent films), but it later became official. Construction and operation Only one example of the type was constructed, allotted civil registration G-AACN. It used slots and flaps to achieve the necessary low speed and short takeoff and landing distances for the various Guggenheim prizes. The aircraft competed in the competition in 1929. Most of the competitors failed to enter due to mechanical problems or failure to satisfy the organizers' safety checks. The Gugnunc performed adequately but did not win any prizes. The HP.39 Gugnunc preserved by the Science Museum at Wroughton airfield, Wiltshire, in July 1992 While at the competition, the Handley Page team noticed that the Curtiss competitors were using an unlicensed version of the Handley Page slot. In the following legal battles, the Curtiss lawyers brought up a postwar judgement that foreign aircraft (and particularly Handley Page aircraft) were prohibited from being imported into the US. On return to the UK, the aircraft continued experimental flying, was ultimately purchased by the Air Ministry, given registration K1908, and was allocated to the Royal Aircraft Establishment for further testing. The aircraft was struck off in 1934 and presented to the Science Museum. In 2016 it was installed as the centrepiece of the Winton Gallery of the museum. The curved overhead structure and layout of the gallery, designed by Dame Zaha Hadid represents the airflow around the aircraft.

When first encountered by Europeans, they lived in the territory of present-day Tennessee, Georgia and Alabama. They were historically closely allied and intermarried with the Alabama people, also members of the Creek Confederacy. Their languages are closely related and mutually intelligible. Under pressure from Anglo-American colonial settlement after 1763 and the French defeat in the Seven Years' War, they began to move west into Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas, which were then under Spanish rule. They became settled in these areas by the early 19th century. Some of the Coushatta and Alabama people were removed west to Indian Territory (now Oklahoma) in the 1830s under Indian Removal, together with other Muscogee (Creek) peoples. Today, Coushatta people are enrolled in three federally recognized tribes: * Alabama-Quassarte Tribal Town in Wetumka, Oklahoma * Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana. * Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of Texas Language The Koasati language is part of the Apalachee- Alabama-Koasati branch of the Muskogean languages. An estimated 200 people spoke the language in 2000, most of whom lived in Louisiana. The language is written in the Latin script.\\"Koasati\\", Ethnologue. Retrieved 27 May 2013. History The Coushatta were traditionally agriculturalists, growing a variety of maize, beans, and squash, and supplementing their diet by hunting game and fish. They are known for their skill at basketry. Nearly all the Spanish expeditions (including the 1539-1543 Hernando de Soto Expedition) into the interior of Spanish Florida recorded encountering the original town of the tribe. It was believed to be located in the Tennessee River Valley. (Click here for a list of towns encountered by the Hernando de Soto Expedition.) The Spanish referred to the people as Coste, with their nearby neighbors being the Chiaha, Chiska, Yuchi, Tasquiqui, and Tali. Under pressure from new European settlers in the 17th-18th centuries, the Coushatta made treaties and ceded land, and they migrated west into present-day Alabama. Along the way they established their town at Nickajack (Ani-Kusati-yi, or Koasati-place, in Cherokee) in the current Marion County, Tennessee. Later they founded a major settlement at the north end of Long Island, which is bisected by the present- day Tennessee-Alabama stateline. By the time of the American Revolution, the Coushatta had moved many miles down the Tennessee River where their town is recorded as Coosada. In the 18th century, some of the Coushatta (Koasati) joined the emerging Creek Confederacy, where they became known as part of the \\"Upper Creek\\". They were closely related to the Alabama Indians and often intermarried with them. Coushatta and Alabama who stayed in Alabama were part of the 1830s forcible removal to Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River. Today their descendants form the federally recognized Alabama-Quassarte Tribal Town in Wetumka, Oklahoma Some of the Coushatta tribe split from the Creek Confederacy and went to South Louisiana. Their descendants today make up the federally recognized Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana. Notable chiefs among the Coushatta-Alabama were Long King and Colita (Koasati) (1838-1852), who succeeded him. They led their people to settle in present-day Polk County, Texas in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Colita's Village was developed prior to the European-American settlement of Livingston, Texas.\\"Alabama-Coushatta Indians\\", Texas Handbook Online Descendants of these peoples form the federally recognized Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of Texas and have a reservation near Livingston.

Botanical Museum of Harvard University (p. 61) 20th century to present *The Alabama-Quassarte Tribal Town in Wetumka, Oklahoma achieved federal recognition in 1939, following passage of the Oklahoma Indian Welfare Act of 1936. Its people were descendants of a community that had moved as a group from their town in Alabama to Indian Territory in the 1830s. They settled together and maintained their town identity. In addition, its people have dual citizenship in the federally recognized Muscogee Creek Nation, representing descendants of the broader Creek Confederacy. It has an enrolled population of 380. *In 1972, the Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana achieved state recognition as a tribe. A year later it gained federal recognition. The tribe has acquired of reservation near its traditional homeland of the 18th and 19th centuries. This land is held in trust on the tribe's behalf by the United States Department of the Interior.Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana , accessed 25 Apr 2010 In the twentieth century, the Coushatta people in Louisiana began cultivating rice and crawfish on tribally owned farms on the reservation, where most of the current population resides. An estimated 200 people of the tribe still speak the Coushatta language, which is in the Muskogean family. In the early 21st century, fewer young people are learning it and the tribe is working on language preservation. Since the late 20th century and the rise in Indian self-determination, many Native American tribes have developed a new source of revenues by establishing gaming casinos on their reservations, which are sovereign territory. States, which had begun their own gaming operations and regulated private ones, and the federal government have passed legislation to control Indian gaming, which must conform to what exists by state law. While such revenues are not taxable by the states, tribes often negotiate agreements with the states to share some portion of income, in recognition of their reliance on state infrastructure and other assets. In the 1990s, the Coushatta of Louisiana hired the lobbyist Jack Abramoff to assist in establishing a gaming casino on their reservation. They were victims of his manipulations, as he charged them high fees but did not work on their behalf to gain federal or state approval of such development. He was ultimately prosecuted for his actions. Since then, the tribe has established gaming on its reservation. It also has tax-free sales of certain items to raise revenues. The initiatives have raised significant revenues, but the state filed suit to stop the specific class of gaming. Litigation is underway. F. A. Little, Jr., of Alexandria, Louisiana, a retired United States District Judge for the Western District of Louisiana, serves as chief judge for the tribe. *The Alabama- Coushatta Tribe of Texas achieved federal recognition in 1987. It has acquired a reservation near Livingston, Texas, its homeland since settling in this area in the early 19th century. It has 1,100 enrolled members.

Simon de Montfort had seized power in England following his victory over Henry III at the Battle of Lewes during the Second Barons' War, but his grip on the country was under threat. In an attempt to gather more support he summoned representatives from not only the barons and the knights of the shires, as had occurred in previous parliaments, but also burgesses from the major towns. The resulting parliament in London discussed radical reforms and temporarily stabilised Montfort's political situation. Montfort was killed at the Battle of Evesham later that year, but the idea of inviting both knights and burgesses to parliaments became more popular under the reign of Henry's son Edward I. By the 14th century this had become the norm, with the gathering becoming known as the House of Commons. This parliament is sometimes referred to as the first representative English parliament due to its inclusion of elected members; Montfort is sometimes regarded as the founder of the Commons. Background 14th-century representation of Henry III of England visiting Louis IX of France during the Second Barons' War In 1258, King Henry III of England faced a revolt among the English barons.; Anger had grown about the way the King's officials were raising funds, the influence of his Poitevin relatives at court and his unpopular Sicilian policy; even the English Church had grievances over its treatment by the King.; Within Henry's court there was a strong feeling that the King would be unable to lead the country through these problems. On 30 April, Hugh Bigod marched into Westminster in the middle of the King's parliament, backed by his co-conspirators, including Simon de Montfort, the Earl of Leicester, and carried out a coup d'√©tat.; Henry, fearful that he was about to be arrested and imprisoned, agreed to abandon his policy of personal rule and instead govern through a council of 24 barons and churchmen, half chosen by the King and half by the barons.; The pressure for reform continued to grow unabated and a parliament met in June. The term \\"parliament\\" had first appeared in the 1230s and 1240s to describe large gatherings of the royal court, and parliamentary gatherings were held periodically throughout Henry's reign. They were used to agree upon the raising of taxes which, in the 13th century, were single, one-off levies, typically on movable property, intended to support the King's normal revenues for particular projects. During Henry's reign, the counties had begun to send regular delegations to these parliaments, and came to represent a broader cross-section of the community than simply the major barons.; The new parliament passed a set of measures known as the Provisions of Oxford, which Henry swore to uphold.; These provisions created a smaller council of 15 members, elected solely by the barons, which then had the power to appoint England's justiciar, chancellor and treasurer, and which would be monitored through triennial parliaments. Pressure from the lesser barons and the gentry present at Oxford also helped to push through wider reform, intended to limit the abuse of power by both the King's officials and the major barons.; More radical measures were passed by the new council the next year, in the form of the Provisions of Westminster. Simon de Montfort, in a stained glass window at Chartres Cathedral The disagreements between the leading barons involved in the revolt soon became evident. Montfort championed radical reforms that would place further limitations on the authority and power of the major barons as well as the Crown; others promoted only moderate change, while the conservative barons expressed concerns about the existing limitations on the King's powers. Over the next four years, neither Henry nor the barons were able to restore stability in England, and power swung back and forth between the different factions. By early 1263, what remained of Henry's authority had disintegrated and the country slipped back towards open civil war. Montfort convened a council of rebel barons in Oxford to pursue his radical agenda and by October, England faced a likely civil war.; Montfort marched east with an army and London rose up in revolt. Montfort took Henry and Queen Eleanor prisoner, and although he maintained a fiction of ruling in Henry's name, the rebels completely replaced the royal government and household with their own, trusted men. Montfort's coalition began to quickly fragment, Henry regained his freedom of movement and renewed chaos spread across England. Henry appealed to his brother-in-law Louis of France for arbitration in the dispute; Montfort was initially hostile to this idea, but, as war became more likely again, he decided to agree to French arbitration as well. Initially Montfort's legal arguments held sway, but in January 1264, Louis announced the Mise of Amiens, condemning the rebels, upholding the King's rights and annulling the Provisions of Oxford.; The Second Barons' War finally broke out in April, when Henry led an army into Montfort's territories. Becoming desperate, Montfort marched in pursuit of Henry and the two armies met at the Battle of Lewes on 14 May. Despite their numerical superiority, Henry's forces were overwhelmed. Captured, Henry was forced to pardon the rebel barons and reinstate the Provisions of Oxford, leaving him, as historian Adrian Jobson describes, \\"little more than a figurehead\\". Parliament Simon de Montfort claimed to be ruling in the King's name through a council of officials. However, he had effective political control over the government even though he was not himself the monarch, the first time this had happened in English history. Montfort successfully held a parliament in London in June 1264 to confirm new constitutional arrangements for England; four knights were summoned from each county, chosen by the county court, and were allowed to comment on general matters of state ‚Äì the first time this had occurred.; Montfort was unable to consolidate his victory at Lewes, however, and widespread disorder persisted across the country.; In France, Eleanor made plans for an invasion of England with the support of Louis. A 13th-century depiction of the mutilation of Simon de Montfort's body following the Battle of Evesham in 1265 In response, and hoping to win wider support for his government, Montfort summoned a new parliament for 20 January 1265 which continued until mid March that year.; It was held at short notice, with the summons being issued on 14 December, leaving little time for attendees to respond. He summoned not only the barons, senior churchmen and two knights from each county, but also two burgesses from each of the major towns such as York, Lincoln, Sandwich, and the Cinque Ports, the first time this had been done.; ; Due to the lack of support for Montfort among the barons, only 23 of them were summoned to parliament, in comparison to the summons issued to 120 churchmen, who largely supported the new government; it is unknown how many burgesses were called. The event was overseen by King Henry, and held in the Palace of Westminster, just outside London, which was the largest city in England, and whose continuing loyalty was essential to Montfort's cause.; ; This parliament was a populist, tactical move by Montfort in an attempt to gather support from the regions, and the historian Jeffrey Hamilton characterises it as \\"a very partisan assembly, not some sort of proto- democratic representative body\\". Once again the representatives were allowed to comment on wider political matters than just the usual issues of taxation. The business of the parliament focused on enforcing the Provisions of Westminster, in particular its restrictions on the major nobles, and promising judicial help to those who felt they were suffering from unfair feudal lordship. The parliament bought temporary calm but opposition grew once more, particularly as Montfort and his immediate family began to amass a huge personal fortune. Prince Edward escaped his captors in May and formed a new army, resulting in a fresh outbreak of civil war. Edward pursued Montfort's forces through the Welsh Marches, before striking east to attack his fortress at Kenilworth and then turning once more on the rebel leader himself. Montfort, accompanied by the captive Henry, was unable to retreat and the Battle of Evesham ensued. Edward was triumphant and Montfort's corpse was mutilated by the victors. In places the now leaderless rebellion dragged on, with some rebels gathering at Kenilworth, which Henry and Edward took after a long siege in 1266. The remaining pockets of resistance were mopped up, and the final rebels, holed up on the Isle of Ely, surrendered in July 1267, marking the end of the war.; Legacy Portrait in Westminster Abbey, thought to be of Edward I Henry III ruled England until his death in 1272, continuing to summon parliaments, sometimes including the county knights and on one occasion including burgesses from the towns.; After 1297 under Edward I's reign, this became the norm, and by the early 14th century it was normal to include the knights and burgesses, a grouping that would become known as the \\"Commons\\" of England and, ultimately, form the \\"House of Commons\\".; Simon de Montfort's parliament of 1265 is sometimes referred to as the first representative English parliament, because of its inclusion of both the knights and the burgesses, and Montfort himself is often regarded as the founder of the House of Commons. The 19th century historian William Stubbs popularised the 1295 \\"Model Parliament\\" of Edward I as the first genuine parliament; however, modern scholarship questions this analysis. The historian David Carpenter describes Montfort's 1265 parliament as \\"a landmark\\" in the development of parliament as an institution during the medieval period. =Modern recognition= The Parliament of the United Kingdom presented a loyal address to Queen Elizabeth II in 1965 to mark the 700th anniversary of Montfort's Parliament, and the Queen addressed both Houses of Parliament. The House of Lords Record Office, now known as the Parliamentary Archives, organised an exhibition in the Houses of Parliament of several important Acts of Parliament. Some of these documents were displayed again in a 2015 exhibition. In 2015, Parliament held a year-long programme of events called \\"Parliament in the Making\\", coordinated with Parliament Week, including events to mark the 750th anniversary of Montfort's Parliament.; The BBC broadcast a \\"Democracy Day\\" on 20 January to coincide with the 750th anniversary consisting of live discussions and debate about parliament and democracy. It was presented in partnership with the Speaker‚Äôs Office of the House of Commons, including broadcasts from inside the Palace of Westminster.; Westminster Abbey held a special evensong on 22 January commemorating the anniversary of the Montfort parliament and the development of rights and representation.

On 5 January 2004, he had just begun work on a new film with Lelouch, but he succumbed to cancer on 22 January 2004. He left a posthumous message, in the form of a document which appeared on his hospital bed after taking him to surgery to remove his 4th cancerous tumor. Holgado declared there: \\"It is necessary to tell to people that it's absolutely necessary to stop smoking\\".

The route is from its junction with the A487 at Cardigan, Ceredigion, to Tenby, Pembrokeshire. It crosses the Preseli Hills and winds through farmland for almost all of its route. The road just touches the very west of Carmarthenshire. History A road between Cardigan and Narberth was recorded between 1536 and 1642. The 1555 Highways Act made parishes responsible for the roads that crossed them. Most were unsuitable for wheeled traffic. Turnpike trusts were set up in the late 18th and early 19th centuries to manage road maintenance; at least part of this road came under the Whitland Trust. However, by the mid-19th century, some trusts were badly managed or abused, exacerbating rural poverty and in part leading to the Rebecca riots in the 1840s, some of the earliest of which were on this road, particularly at Efailwen in the Cilymaenllwyd Community. The trusts were reformed in 1844. The northern two-thirds of the A478 was a drovers' road, used for transporting goods and livestock to and from West Wales and Ireland. In the 18th and 19th centuries, Cardigan was a port, the commercial centre of the region and the most important port in South Wales, exporting fish, agricultural products and raw materials, and involved in emigration. In 1815, it possessed 314 ships totalling , seven times more than Cardiff and three times more than Swansea. It had a thriving shipbuilding industry, with over 200 vessels being built both in Cardigan and downstream in the village of Llandudoch (St Dogmaels). When Cardigan was connected to the Carmarthen and Cardigan Railway in 1886, the decline of the port was hastened. The river silted up and larger vessels could no longer reach the port, which had largely become inactive by the early part of the 20th century.http://www.gtj.org.uk/en/articles/cardigan-port/ Cardigan Port at Gathering the Jewels.

Native Americans moved into New Jersey soon after the reversal of the Younger Dryas; before then an ice sheet hundreds of feet thick had made the area of northern New Jersey uninhabitable. European contact began with the exploration of the Jersey Shore by Giovanni da Verrazzano in 1524. At the time of European contact, many tribes of the Lenape lived in the area. In the 17th century, the New Jersey region came under the control of the Swedes and the Dutch, resulting in a struggle in which the Dutch proved victorious (1655). However, the English seized the Dutch colony of New Netherland in 1664. New Jersey became one of the Thirteen Colonies which broke away from Britain in the American Revolution, adopting the Declaration of Independence in 1776. Becoming a state upon the formation of the United States, New Jersey saw significant action during the American Revolutionary War. New Jersey's delegates signed the Articles of Confederation in 1779 and Princeton acted as the nation's capital for four months in 1783. In 1787, New Jersey became the third state to ratify the United States Constitution.New Jersey became the third state to ratify the United States Constitution on December 18, 1787, with 38 delegates voting unanimously in favor of the Constitution. See Article Seven of the United States Constitution, which describes the process by which the Constitution was ratified by states, as well as statistics for ratification. In the 19th century, New Jersey cities led the United States into the Industrial Revolution and provided soldiers for many of the wars the United States fought, including 88,000 men for the American Civil War. The state became a component of the Underground Railroad. The state's transportation system continued to improve with the construction of canals and more rail lines that helped industrialization develop further. During the early 20th century New Jersey prospered, but the economy weakened in the Great Depression of the 1930s. During World War II (1939-1945) and the Cold War ( 1947-1991), New Jersey's shipyards and military bases played an important role in the defense of the United States. In the 1960s New Jersey became the site of several race riots and of the Glassboro Summit Conference (1967), between American President Lyndon B. Johnson and Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin. Paleo-Indians and Native Americans Paleo-Indians first settled in the area of present-day New Jersey after the Wisconsin Glacier melted around 13,000 B.C. The Zierdt site in Montague, Sussex County and the Plenge site along the Musconetcong River in Franklin Township, Warren County, as well as the Dutchess Cave in Orange County, New York, represent camp sites of Paleo-Indians. Paleo Indians were hunter-gatherers, hunting game and gathering plants for eating. They moved as soon as game or plants became scarce. The Woodland period of North American pre-Columbian cultures spans the time period from roughly 1000 BCE to 1,000 CE in the eastern part of North America. The Hopewell tradition summarizes the common aspects of the Native American culture that flourished along rivers in the northeastern United States from 200 BCE to 500 CE. Later other Native Americans settled in New Jersey. Around the year 1000, a Native American group known as the Lenape, later called Delaware Indians, settled in New Jersey. They came from the Mississippi valley. The Lenape formed loosely organized groups who at first migrated seasonally. With the advent of the bow- and-arrow and of pottery around the year 500 A.D., extended family groups began to stay in areas longer. They practiced small-scale agriculture (companion planting), such as growing corn and pole beans together and squash. They were hunting and gathering, hunting with bow-and-arrow, and using deadfall traps and snares. They also gathered nuts in the autumn such as acorns, hickory nuts, walnuts, butternuts, beech nuts and chestnuts. The Native Americans and Paleo-Indians fished in all rivers and streams using nets and fish hooks and by hand. They also fished in the region surrounding the Delaware River, the lower Hudson River, and western Long Island Sound. Traces of their Algonquian language survive in many place-names throughout the state. European exploration In 1524, Giovanni da Verrazzano, sailing in the service of France, explored the Jersey Coast including Sandy Hook and The Narrows, now the site of the bridge which bears his name. In 1609, Sir Henry Hudson sailing for the Dutch East India Company,New Jersey History by Susan Ditmire, American Local History Network explored the East Coast including the Delaware, Raritan, Newark, New York bays and the Hudson Valley. During the next four years, on somewhat secretive missions, Adriaen Block explored and mapped the coast along Delaware, New Jersey, Long Island, and New England, naming it for the first time New Netherlands. Colonial history =New Netherland= A modern map which approximates the relative size and location of the settled areas of New Netherland and New Sweden, which was never officially recognized by the Dutch Republic Between 1611 and 1614, three Dutchmen, A. Block, H. Christiaensen and C. Mey surveyed land between the 40th and 45th parallels along the Atlantic coast and named the area they surveyed New Netherlands. Initially, small out-posts were built for the fur trade. In May 1624, from a ship under the command of Cornelius Jacobsen Mey (after whom Cape May is named) thirty families were required to spread themselves throughout the region including Fort Wilhelmus. The last was on the east bank of the Delaware River,which was called the Zuid Rivier\\" the site of the first European settlement in what would become New Jersey. Later another was built at Fort Nassau. The next European settlement was on the banks of the Upper New York Bay across the Hudsonwhich he called the \\"North River\\" from Fort Amsterdam (in Manhattan) in 1630. Located at Paulus Hook it was part of the patroonship Pavonia, named (in Latinized form) for Micheal PauwWords That Make New Jersey History edited by Howard L Green, 1995 , p. 3 who had bought the tract from the Lenape. At the time it was the territory of the Unami, or Turtle Clan. The settlement grew slowly, impeded by mismanagement of the Dutch West India Company and conflicts with the indigenous population known as Kieft's War and The Peach Tree War. In 1658, Director-General of New Netherland Peter Stuyvesant \\"re-purchased\\" the entire peninsula known as Bergen Neck, and in 1661 granted a charter to the village at Bergen, establishing the oldest municipality in the state. The British take-over in 1664 was formalized in 1674, ending the province of the New Netherland, though the North Jersey would retain a \\"Dutch\\" character for many years to come.Scheltema, Gajus and Westerhuijs, Heleen (eds.),Exploring Historic Dutch New York. Museum of the City of New York/Dover Publications, New York (2011). =New Sweden= Part of southwestern New Jersey was settled by the Swedes by the mid-17th century. New Sweden, founded in 1638, rose to its height under governor Johan Bj√∂rnsson Printz (1643‚Äì53). Led by Printz, the settlement extended north from Fort Christina on both sides of the Delaware River. Printz helped to improve the military and commercial status of the colony by constructing Fort Nya Elfsborg, near present-day Salem on the east side of the Delaware River. This action prevented the river from being easily taken by the English and Dutch, who were also trying to expand into the New World. The Swedish and Finnish colonists generally lived in peace with their Dutch and Lenape neighbors.A History of New Sweden: or, the Settlements on the river Delaware (by Israel Acrelius. Philadelphia: The Historical Society of Pennsylvania, 1874) C. A. Nothnagle Log House and Schorn Log Cabin are remainders of this early influence. (New Sweden's colonial population may have peaked at 368 people in 1654, after being boosted by more than 250 people along with new governor Johan Rising. This was not enough to stave off 317 Dutch soldiers the next year, however. At least one online sourcehttp://colonialswedes.net/History/History.html asserts that some 600 colonists settled in New Sweden; it is unclear from that source how many were in New Sweden at any one point in time.) =Province of New Jersey= The Province of New Jersey, Divided into East and West, commonly called The Jerseys, 1777 map by William Faden From the colony of New Netherland, the Dutch interfered with Britain's transatlantic trade with its North American colonies. Insisting that John Cabot had been the first to discover North America, the British granted the land that now encompasses New Jersey to the Duke of York (later James II & VII), who ordered Colonel Richard Nicolls to take over the area. In September 1664, a British fleet under Nicolls' command sailed into what is now New York Harbor and seized the colony. The British encountered little resistance, perhaps due to the unpopularity of the Dutch governor, Peter Stuyvesant.Stuyvesant's council took several measures restricting religion in New Netherland, heightening his unpopularity, and he was also known for being hot-tempered. He took advantage of military coercion in order to increase his own power, shown in an event with Van Slechtenhorst. Stuyvesant grew haughty in his treatment of his opponents and threatened to dissolve the council in response to an angry outbreak at a meeting of commissioners in September 1650. Peter Stuyvesant StanKlos.com (2001), retrieved December 15, 2005. After capturing the colony, Nicolls became deputy-governor of New Amsterdam and the rest of New Netherland, and guaranteed colonists' property rights, laws of inheritance, and the enjoyment of religious freedom. New Netherland west of the Hudson River was renamed New Jersey after the English Channel Island of Jersey which Charles II of England, after having seen their loyalty to the crown, gave to the people of Jersey as a gift having given him hospitality in the castle of Mont Orgueil before he was proclaimed king in 1649. The city of New Amsterdam was renamed New York (after the Duke of York). The original provinces of West and East New Jersey are shown in yellow and green respectively. The Keith Line is shown in red, and the Coxe and Barclay Line is shown in orange. Charles II gave the region between New England and Maryland to his brother, the Duke of York (later King James II & VII), as a proprietary colony. Later James granted the land between the Hudson River and the Delaware River that would become New Jersey to two friends who had been loyal to him through the English Civil War: Sir George Carteret and Lord Berkeley of Stratton. The two proprietors of New Jersey tried to entice more settlers to New Jersey by granting land to settlers and by passing Concession and Agreement, a document granting religious freedom to all inhabitants of New Jersey; the British Church of England allowed no such religious freedom. In return for land, settlers paid annual fees known as quitrents. The proprietors appointed Philip Carteret as the first governor of New Jersey, who designated Elizabethtown as the colony's capital.Elizabeth, New Jersey was not named after Queen Elizabeth I, but rather after the wife of Sir George Carteret, and was founded in 1664. However, the two proprietors found collecting the quitrents difficult, and on March 18, 1674 Berkeley sold his share of New Jersey to the Quakers.Streissguth, Thomas (2002). New Jersey. San Diego: Lucent Books, Inc. . pg 24‚Äì28Surrender from the Proprietors of East and West New Jersey, of Their Pretended Right of Government to Her Majesty by The Avalon Project at Yale Law School, retrieved December 15, 2005. This sale divided the province into East Jersey and West Jersey. The exact line between West and East Jersey generally corresponded to the Keith Line between present day South and North Jersey and was created by George Keith. However, the line was constantly the subject of disputes. With the 1676 Quintipartite Deed more accurate surveys and maps were made resulting in the Thornton Line, drawn around 1696, and the Lawrence Line, drawn around 1743, which was adopted as the final line for legal purposes. Many of the colonists of New Jersey became farmers. However, despite the fertility of the soil, farmers were forced to struggle due to the dearth of English money. Some owned slaves or had indentured servants work for them. The majority of the colonists lived in simple log cabins, coming from the original Dutch settlers. Since New Jersey was ideally located next to the Atlantic Ocean, colonists farmed, fished, and traded by sea. Transportation was slow and difficult usually on either foot or horseback. Education came through small religious schools, private academies, or tutors. On April 15, 1702, under the reign of Queen Anne, West and East Jersey were reunited as a royal colony. Edward Hyde, Lord Cornbury became the first governor of the colony as a royal colony. Lord Cornbury was an ineffective and corrupt ruler, taking bribes and speculating on land, so in 1708 he was recalled to England. New Jersey was then ruled by the governors of New York, but this infuriated the settlers of New Jersey, who accused those governors of favoritism to New York. Judge Lewis Morris led the case for a separate governor, and was appointed governor by King George II in 1738.Streissguth pg 30‚Äì36 From 1701 to 1765, New Jersey's border with New York was in dispute, resulting in a series of skirmishes and raids. In 1746, the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) was founded in Elizabethtown by a group of Great Awakening \\"New Lighters\\" that included Jonathan Dickinson, Aaron Burr Sr. and Peter Van Brugh Livingston. In 1756, the school moved to Princeton. American Revolution Military map by William Faden with troop movements during the Ten Crucial Days New Jersey was one of the original thirteen colonies that joined in the struggle for independence from Great Britain. Many of the New Jersey settlers still felt ties of loyalty to the British crown, and many slaves sided with the British in exchange for freedom.Streissguth pg 52‚Äì57 The loyalists included the governor of New Jersey, William Franklin. On July 2, 1776, the first Constitution of New Jersey was drafted, creating a basic framework for the state government. The New Jersey Constitution of 1776 allowed \\"all inhabitants of this Colony, of full age, who are worth fifty pounds proclamation money\\" to vote, including non-whites and widows; married women could not own property under the common law. The Constitution declared itself temporary and to be void if there was reconciliation with Great Britain.Klinghoffer and Elkis. \\"The Petticoat Electors: Women's Suffrage in New Jersey, 1776‚Äì1807.\\" Journal of the Early Republic, 12, no. 2 (1992): 159‚Äì193. Both political parties in elections mocked the other for relying on \\"petticoat electors\\" for allowing women to vote. The right to vote was restricted to white males in 1807. Only two days after the new constitution was enacted, on July 4, 1776, the Declaration of Independence was endorsed by five representatives from New Jersey. New Jersey is referred to as the \\"Crossroads of the Revolution\\" because the British and Continental armies fought several crucial battles there.Crossroads of the American Revolution by Heritage Trail Association, retrieved December 16, 2005. Throughout the war hundreds of engagements occurred in New Jersey, more than in any other colony. Five major battles were fought at Trenton, Princeton, Monmouth, Union and Springfield. The Battles of Trenton and Princeton are collectively referred to as the Ten Crucial Days because these desperately needed victories bolstered the morale of the nation. On the night of December 25‚Äì26, 1776, the Continental Army, commanded by General George Washington, made the famous crossing of the Delaware River. The scene was immortalized in Emanuel Gottlieb Leutze's painting Washington Crossing the Delaware, and displayed on the New Jersey State Quarter. In the Battle of Trenton which followed the crossing, the American soldiers surprised the Hessians, capturing nearly 900 prisoners in 90 minutes and taking supplies that had been meant for the British army. After the victory, George Washington led the army back across the Delaware River into Pennsylvania. A few days later, British General Charles Cornwallis hoped to engage Washington's army at Trenton after Washington recrossed the Delaware River, resulting in the Second Battle of Trenton. After recapturing Trenton, he ordered charges on fortified defenses at Assunpink Creek. The Americans inflicted heavy casualties on the British from their defenses. Later, the Continental army slipped past Cornwallis's stalled army and launched an attack on British soldiers stationed at Princeton in the Battle of Princeton on January 3, 1777. The British at Princeton were forced to surrender. Cornwallis immediately ordered his army to engage the Americans at Princeton, but was prevented by snipers. These victories forced the British to leave New Jersey. Molly Pitcher taking over her husband's position at a cannon On June 28, 1778, the Continental Army under George Washington met a British column under Sir Henry Clinton at the Battle of Monmouth. Washington hoped to surprise and overwhelm the rear of the British army. General Charles Lee led the American attack on the British rear but retreated prematurely when the British attempted to flank the Americans. The retreat nearly led to disorder, but Washington managed to rally the troops to withstand two British counter-attacks, both of which failed. As temperatures increased to over , many soldiers fell to sunstroke. After the battle, Charles Lee was court-martialed for his poor command. Over 1,000 British casualties were incurred while the Americans lost 452 men. It was during this battle that the legendary \\"Molly Pitcher\\" is said to have fought.\\"Molly Pitcher\\" has sometimes been regarded as a real person, although historians now often believe the story is a myth, although probably loosely based on the actions of real women. See Molly Pitcher. The last major battle to take place in New Jersey during the Revolutionary War (and for the rest of the history of New Jersey) was the Battle of Springfield. Baron von Knyphausen, the Hessian general, hoped to invade New Jersey and expected support from colonists of New Jersey who were tired of the war. He hoped to secure Hobart Gap, from which he could attack the American headquarters in Morristown. On June 23, 1780, the British attacked soldiers under the command of Nathanael Greene. General Greene successfully stopped a two-pronged attack from entrenchments held across the Raritan River, preventing the British invasion. New Jersey ratified and then signed the Articles of Confederation on November 26, 1779. In the summer of 1783, the Continental Congress met in Nassau Hall of Princeton University. It had originally convened in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, but mutinous troops prevented the meeting from taking place. Princeton became the temporary capital for the nation for four months. During the brief stay in Princeton, the Continental Congress was informed of the end of the war by the signing of the Treaty of Paris on September 3, 1783. On December 18, 1787, New Jersey became the third state to ratify the United States Constitution, and on November 20, 1789, New Jersey became the first state in the Nation to ratify the United States Bill of Rights. New Jersey played a major role in creating the structure of the new United States Government. When Virginia delegates proposed a plan calling for representation based on the population of each state, the smaller states refused, fearing that with such a plan they would no longer have a say in government affairs. William Paterson, a New Jersey statesman, introduced the New Jersey Plan, by which one vote would be given to each state, providing equal representation within the legislative body. The Great Compromise accepted both plans, creating two separate bodies in the Congress. Nineteenth century =Industrial Revolution= The economy of New Jersey was largely based on agriculture, but crop failures and poor soil plagued the settlers of New Jersey. However, New Jersey eventually funded publications in the early 1850s of accurate agriculture-related surveys through the effort of George Hammell Cook. The publication of this survey helped to increase the state's involvement in agricultural research and direct support to farmers. As agriculture became a less reliable source of income for New Jerseyans, many began turning towards more industrialized methods. The Great Falls of the Passaic River Paterson became the cradle of the Industrial Revolution in America. Energy was harnessed from the 77 feet (23 m) high Great Falls of the Passaic River. The city became an important site for mills and other industries. These include the textile, firearms, silk, and railroad locomotive manufacturing industries. Because of its high silk production, it became nicknamed the \\"Silk City\\". In 1835, Samuel Colt began producing firearms in the city. The second version of the New Jersey State Constitution was written in 1844. The constitution provided suffrage only to white males, removing it from all women and from people of other races. Suffrage had been awarded to those groups under the original New Jersey State Constitution of 1776. Some important components of the second State Constitution include the separation of the powers of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. The new constitution also provided a bill of rights. Underneath the constitution, the people had the right to elect the governor. The famous inventor Thomas Edison was born in 1847. Edison worked in Menlo Park, and was known as \\"the Wizard of Menlo Park\\" for his many inventions; over the course of his life, he was granted 1,093 patents. His most famous inventions included the phonograph, the kinetoscope, the stock ticker, the Dictaphone and the tattoo gun. He also is credited with improving the designs of the incandescent light bulb, radio, the telegraph, and the telephone. He started the Motion Picture Patents Company. One of his famous sayings was, \\"Genius is one percent inspiration and 99% perspiration\\", as his efforts consisted of research and testing. The agricultural products from New Jersey usually were transported to larger markets in New York City and Philadelphia, requiring better transportation. The first ocean-going steamboat went from Hoboken, New Jersey, sailed around southern New Jersey, and ended in Philadelphia. Later, systems of canals were built, the first of which is called the Morris Canal and ran from Phillipsburg, New Jersey, on the Delaware River to Jersey City, New Jersey, on the Hudson River. The Delaware and Raritan canal ran from New Brunswick, New Jersey, on the Raritan River, to Bordentown, New Jersey, on the Delaware River. Locomotion was also improved; Hoboken-born inventor John Stevens built a 10-ton locomotive and his son Robert L. Stevens started constructing iron railroads. By 1833, The Camden & Amboy Railroad had been completed, allowing a 7-hour passage between Philadelphia and New York City. Through the 1800s, over a dozen companies were operating railroad lines. =Second Party System= Historians have examined the emergence of the Second Party System at the state and local level. For example Bruce Bendler argues that in New Jersey the same dramatic changes that were reshaping the rest of the country were especially pointed in that state in the 1820s. A new political system emerged by the end of the decade as voters polarized in support or opposition to Jackson. By the mid-1830s the Democrats and the Whigs had fully mobilize practically all of the voters into pro-and anti--Jackson coalitions. Furthermore the \\"Market Revolution\\" was well underway, as industrialization and upgraded transportation networks made the larger picture more important than the local economy, and entrepreneurs and politicians became leaders in speeding up the changes. for example William N. Jeffers of Salem County, New Jersey, build his political success on leadership with the Jacksonian forces at the local level, while at the same time building his fortune with a bank charter and building a steam mill.Bruce A. Bendler, \\"The Steam Mill and Jacksonian Politics: The Career of William N. Jeffers.\\" New Jersey Studies 4.2 (2018): 41-68. online =War and slavery= During the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, a battalion of volunteers from New Jersey, in four companies, was active from September 1847 to July 1848. Philip Kearny, an officer who led a cavalry unit, followed General Winfield Scott and fought in the Battle of Contreras and Battle of Churubusco. After the war, Kearny made his home in the state of New Jersey. George B. McClellan The Quaker population was especially intolerant of slavery, and the state was a major part of the Underground Railroad. The New Jersey legislature passed an act for the gradual abolition of slavery in 1804, providing that no person born after that date would be a slave. It was not until 1830 that most blacks were free in the state. New Jersey was the last northern state to abolish slavery completely, and by the close of the Civil War, about a dozen African-Americans in New Jersey were still apprenticed freedmen. The 1860 Census found just over 25,000 free African Americans in the state.Historical Census Browser, 1860 US Census, University of Virginia , accessed 21 Mar 2008 Thousands of former slaves‚Äîboth from rural New Jersey and the South‚Äîmigrated to shore communities like Red Bank, Long Branch, and Asbury Park during the last decades of the nineteenth century, creating sizable, stable communities that persisted over the next century.Greason, Walter (2013). Suburban Erasure: How the Suburbs Ended the Civil Rights Movement in New Jersey. Madison: Fairleigh Dickinson University Press. . pg 15‚Äì17 New Jersey at first refused to ratify the Constitutional Amendment banning slavery. Although no Civil War battles were fought within New Jersey, the state sent over 88,000 soldiers as part of some 31 infantry and cavalry regiments, and over 6,000 died in the war. 23,116 of those soldiers served in the Army of the Potomac. Soldiers from New Jersey fought generally in the War's Eastern theater. Philip Kearny, an officer from the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, led a brigade of New Jersey regiments under Brigadier General William B. Franklin. Kearny distinguished himself as a brilliant officer during the Peninsula Campaign, and was promoted to the position of major general. New Jersey was one of the few states to favor Stephen Douglas over Abraham Lincoln in the 1860 presidential election. The people of New Jersey also cast their electoral votes for George B. McClellan when he ran for President against Abraham Lincoln in the election of 1864. The people had the distinction of being the only free state that rejected Lincoln twice. McClellan was later elected governor, serving from 1878 to 1881. Many industrial cities like Paterson and Camden grew strong through Civil War production. They manufactured many necessities, including clothing and war materials like ammunition. These cities prospered through heavy production even after the end of the war.Stewart, Mark (2004). New Jersey: History. Chicago: Heinemann Library. . pg 26‚Äì29 Twentieth century =Early 1900s and World War I= The Standard Oil Company of New Jersey was a large integrated oil producing, transporting, refining, and marketing organization, founded by Henry H. Rogers, William Rockefeller, and John D. Rockefeller. In 1911, the United States Supreme Court ordered the dissolution of the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, viewing it as violating the Sherman Antitrust Act. Standard Oil had controlled nearly 90% of refined oil flows into the United States, having a near complete monopoly upon it. Standard Oil Company was split into 34 smaller companies as a result of the dissolution. Michael Schleisser and the \\"Jersey man-eater\\" as seen in the Bronx Home News Between July 1 and July 12, 1916 a series of shark attacks occurred along the Jersey Shore in which four swimmers were killed and another severely injured. The incidents occurred during a deadly heat wave and polio epidemic in the Northeastern United States that drove thousands of people to the seaside resorts of the Jersey Shore. Scientists since then have debated which shark species was responsible, with the Great White Shark as the most cited. New Jersey was a center of shipbuilding and manufacturing during World War I. Existing factories such as the Singer Company in Elizabeth, New Jersey were converted to making weapon parts. New refineries and ammunition factories were built by companies like DuPont Engineering. After the war, many of these companies and plants shifted to chemicals, making New Jersey one of the world's leading chemical producers. Several Allied ships were sunk off the New Jersey coast. Camp Merritt, in Cresskill, was activated for use in World War I. It was from there that many soldiers were deployed to Hoboken before shipping off to Europe. Camp Merritt was decommissioned in November 1919.Camp Merritt by Kevin Wright, retrieved December 19, 2005. Fort Dix, in Pemberton Township, New Jersey, was also constructed in 1917 to help in the war effort. It was used as a training and staging ground throughout the war. After the war, it was converted into a demobilization center. =Roaring Twenties= People standing by the border of the newly constructed Holland Tunnel Like much of the rest of the United States, New Jersey entered a prosperous state through the 1920s. Through this period, New Jersey's population and employment rate increased greatly. Although factory production decreased after the end of World War I, production lines still churned out goods. Transportation became much easier through the 1920s. Cars became easily affordable and roads were paved and improved such that they incorporated new road features, including jughandle turns. As a result, people who had never been farther than the outskirts of their hometown now could travel around the state. The Jersey Shore became extremely popular as an attraction. Many bridges and tunnels were built for the ease of interstate traveling. The Benjamin Franklin Bridge was completed linking Camden and Philadelphia in 1926. The Holland Tunnel, under the Hudson River, was completed in 1927, providing a means of easy transportation between New Jersey and New York City. Before, ferries were required to travel across the Hudson River. Later on, the George Washington Bridge (1931) and the Lincoln Tunnel (1937) were completed, making access to Manhattan even easier.Stewart pg 30‚Äì32 All of the tunnels and bridges linking New York and New Jersey are managed by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, established on April 30, 1921. New Jersey was the first state to ratify Prohibition, which restricted the purchasing and selling of alcohol. However, the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which banned alcohol manufacturing & sales, was later repealed by the Twenty-first Amendment in December 1933. Newark's breweries reopened almost immediately. =Great Depression era= Like the rest of the United States, the people of New Jersey were hit hard by the Great Depression. By 1933, one-tenth of the population was dependent upon Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal. In fact, New Jersey issued begging licenses to the poor people because the New Jersey government funds were being exhausted.Gerdes, Louise I. _The 1930s_ , Greenhaven Press, Inc., 2000. Under the Works Progress Administration, part of the Second New Deal by FDR, many new jobs were provided in order to support the poor, including the expansion of Fort Dix, Roosevelt Park in Edison, and Rutgers Stadium in Piscataway. Strikes also grew common during the Great Depression; in 1937 a group of gravediggers from New Jersey went on strike. In 1938, Orson Welles produced The War of the Worlds radio broadcast. Listeners were told that a \\"huge, flaming object ... fell on a farm in the neighborhood of Grover's Mill ... twenty-two miles from Trenton.\\"Gerdes pg 210‚Äì218 It described extraterrestrial monsters that were causing much destruction. Although it was announced in advance that it was a radio play, the broadcast resulted in widespread panic into New Jersey and the surrounding areas. Many people had believed the bulletin to be real, causing them to flee the New Jersey area or to blockade their homes to ensure safety from the reported monsters. CBS was criticized for allowing fictitious bulletins to gain attention of listeners. Welles and the other broadcasters were not punished by law, but were held under a brief informal \\"house arrest\\" for a short period. During the Great Depression, 20-month-old Charles Augustus Lindbergh, Jr., son of famous aviator Charles Lindbergh, was abducted from his home near Hopewell, New Jersey in the Lindbergh kidnapping. The police sealed off many roads to prevent the kidnapper's escape, and interrogated the members of the Lindbergh household. Federal expert Arthur Koehler carefully examined the ladder used by the kidnapper, which he traced to a company in McCormick, South Carolina. James J. Finn was a lieutenant who attempted to capture the kidnapper while he was passing off ransom bills. Finally, a ransom note was located and traced to Bruno Hauptmann; the bill had the license plate number of Hauptmann's Dodge Saloon that was written down by a gas attendant. He was tried in Flemington, New Jersey in what was known as the \\"Trial of the Century\\", and was convicted. He was electrocuted in the New Jersey State Prison in Trenton, New Jersey.Gerdes pg 230‚Äì240 The Lindbergh kidnapping led to passage of the Federal Kidnapping Act, also known as the \\"Lindbergh Law\\", which made kidnapping a federal crime. Hindenburg just moments after catching fire. In 1937, the German zeppelin Hindenburg exploded over Lakehurst Naval Air Station in Manchester. While approaching a mooring mast at Lakehurst, the zeppelin suddenly caught fire, and within 34 seconds the entire hydrogen-filled zeppelin was engulfed in flames; 36 people died in the disaster, most of them leaping from the burning ship. Contrary to popular belief, the Hindenburg had flown an entire year of successful voyages before it caught on fire. Questions and controversy surround the accident to this day: theories for the sudden burst of flames include sabotage against the German Nazis, static build-up, and flammable fabric. =World War II And The 1940s= A fleet of naval forces being constructed in the Camden shipyards New Jersey shipyards were responsible for the construction of many naval ships in World War II, including battleships, aircraft carriers, heavy cruisers and destroyers, receiving 9% of all allied war-related contracts through the war. Nearly 500,000 residents enlisted for the war,Stewart pg 30‚Äì37 more than 10% of the total population of New Jersey. Many women took jobs in factories during their husbands' absences. Camp Kilmer was a staging area near New Brunswick that served the port of New York. Its buildings were painted with protective camouflage patterns. Camp Kilmer helped to serve troops by offering medical care and providing supplies. Camp Kilmer was later reactivated for the Korean War and the 1956 Hungarian Revolution. Fort Dix was reopened for the training of soldiers for the war effort. During the war, Naval Weapons Station Earle in Monmouth County was opened for naval production and provided ships with a safe port to take on ammunition. Millville Airport opened on August 2, 1941. It was called \\"America's First Defense Airport\\" because it was opened as a gunnery training area for fighter pilots. Over 1,500 pilots were trained for advanced aircraft fighting at this airport.Millville Army Airfield, by JasperDyne Industries, retrieved December 26, 2005. Fort Hancock was also opened in Sandy Hook. Gunners in the fort prevented German submarines from entering New York Harbor. The airfield, currently known as McGuire Air Force Base, was opened in 1937 as Rudd Field, a supporting Army airfield for Fort Dix. It was expanded during wartime operations and turned over to the Air Force in 1949. One of the most dramatic war events in the Northeast occurred in 1945, when US forces hit and sank a German U-boat (U-869) off the coast of New Jersey. The Coast Guard station at what is now Sandy Hook Gateway Park was manned for the duration of the war to protect New York harbor. An internment camp housing people of Japanese, German, and Italian descent was located in Gloucester City. In addition, Seabrook Farms took advantage of Japanese-American labor to increase productivity when the government allowed small groups of people from the internment camps to work there. At the end of World War II, the government closed down the internment camps, but many people from the camps continued to work at Seabrook Farms. In 1947, the current New Jersey State Constitution was ratified, reorganizing the state government. Governors were allowed to serve four years instead of three, and the Legislature was constituted with a 40-member Senate and an 80-member General Assembly. The new State Constitution also returned the right of suffrage to females and non-whites. =Late twentieth century= In the 1950s, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey planned and built the Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal in the cities of Newark and Elizabeth. This was the first port in the world to containerize due to the innovation of Malcolm McLean and the founding of the Sea-Land Corporation. The newly opened port quickly made the docks of Brooklyn, Lower Manhattan and Hoboken obsolete. In 1985, the port was the busiest in the world. (See Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal). During the 1960s, many African Americans felt disenfranchised, feelings exacerbated by poor urban conditions, declining industrial jobs, and biased police forces with little minority representation. This tension led to race riots, the first of which occurred in Jersey City on August 2, 1964, causing heavy damage. Seventy-one stores were damaged and 46 people were injured. From August 11 to August 13, 1964, similar riots occurred in Paterson and Elizabeth. In the Paterson riot, twenty stores and other buildings were damaged, and eight people were injured. In the Elizabeth riot, six people were injured and seventeen stores were damaged. In the aftermath of these riots, 135 people were arrested. In the summer of 1967, urban residents, primarily African Americans, rioted for five days in Newark and the neighboring city of Plainfield. Twenty-four people died in the riots, and nearly 1,600 were arrested. The riots are often cited as a major factor in the decline of Newark and its neighboring communities. Residents who could leave, fled to the suburbs following the riots. Lyndon Johnson meets Alexei Kosygin in Glassboro In the middle of the Cold War from June 23 to June 25, 1967, president Lyndon Johnson met with Soviet premier Alexei Kosygin in Glassboro, New Jersey, for the Glassboro Summit Conference.Biography of Lyndon Johnson (February 4, 2004), retrieved December 25, 2005. at the Glassboro State College. No specific agreements were reached, especially in the area of restrictions on anti-ballistic missile systems. However, the meeting helped improve the strained relationships between the Soviet Union and the US. Because of its strategic location on the East Coast, New Jersey played an important role in the United States' Cold War defense. Fourteen Nike anti-aircraft missile batteries in two groups were constructed in New Jersey to protect the metropolitan areas around Philadelphia and New York City. In addition, a regional command center was built in New Jersey. By 1974, the missile sites were deactivated. In addition to these, air defense radar sites, bases for interceptor aircraft, anti-aircraft gun batteries, surface-to-air missile sites, and command and control facilities were constructed to defend against an attack by long range, nuclear-armed aircraft of the Soviet Air Force.Donald E. Bender (1999). Nike Missile Sites in New Jersey. Retrieved December 17, 2005. http://alpha.fdu.edu/~bender/NYmsg.html In 1973, the New Jersey Supreme Court ordered the legislature to pass a statute funding schools more equitably for impoverished areas. The legislature did this in 1975 but failed to fund it. The Court thereupon shut down all public schools for eight days in 1976, until the legislature passed an income tax bill. Prior to this bill, the state had no income tax. In 1998, the south side of Ellis Island came under the jurisdiction of New Jersey following a US Supreme Court decision, New Jersey v. New York.

The writers approached Jill Shirley about finding suitable singers for the group. Shirley had been involved with the UK heats for Eurovision for a number of years and would go on to form Bucks Fizz, Gem and Bardo.

Website, About Crawford Productions Founded in Melbourne by Hector Crawford and his sister, actress and voice artist Dorothy Crawford, the company, also known as Crawfords Australia, is now a subsidiary of the WIN Corporation. Founding and early years Founded exclusively as a radio production company in 1945, Crawford Productions then specialized in drama, light entertainment, and educational programs. When broadcast television was introduced to Australia in 1956, Crawford Productions was one of the few Australian radio production houses to successfully transition to the new medium. Early Crawford TV productions included Wedding Day (HSV-7, 1956), the first Australian-produced sitcom Take That! (HSV-7, 1957‚Äì59), The Peters Club (GTV-9, 1958), Raising a Husband (GTV-9, 1958) and the drama play Seagulls Over Sorrento (HSV-7, 1960). They also produced segments of the Export Action documentary series, The Flying Doctor and a local adaptation of the US game show Video Village (HSV-7, 1962‚Äì66). The company's production quality was known to be higher quality than that of their closest rival, the Reg Grundy Organisation, who specialized in quiz and game shows before transitioning to drama serials. Company co-founder Hector Crawford was well-known as an orchestral conductor and as a prominent figure in the ongoing campaign for local content regulations on Australian television. During the 1960s and the first half of the 1970s, Crawford Productions dominated Australian drama series. They gained an early foothold with their first major TV series, Consider Your Verdict (1961‚Äì64), which presented dramatizations of court cases. Like other local producers, they faced heightened competition from imported overseas programming, as there were no local content regulations governing Australian television at the time. As a result of this de facto free-trade agreement, most programs shown on Australian TV content were imported from America. At the time when Homicide premiered in late 1964, more than 80% of all content broadcast on Australian TV came from America, and American productions enjoyed a virtual monopoly over the TV drama field. The report of the 1963 Vincent Commission into the Australian media found that 97% of all drama shows broadcast in Australia between 1956 and 1963 were American productions. Australian producers competed against high-quality, high-budget imported programs that drew from an international talent pool and a skill-base that grew out of the Hollywood. The competitive advantage enjoyed by imported content was exacerbated by the fact that the once-thriving Australian film industry had been decimated by competition from the major American studios. Since the beginning of the 1960s, film production in Australia had come to a standstill. Only one locally produced and funded feature film was made in Australia in the decade between 1959 and 1969. One of the major impacts of the suppression of the local film industry was a rapid erosion of skills and experience among local film-makers and an exodus of local talent to Britain and the USA. Homicide Crawford experienced mainstream success with its popular and long-running police drama Homicide, which premiered in October 1964 on the Seven Network. It became the first Australian TV drama series produced locally to become a major ratings success and compete effectively with imported American programming. As video technology was still in its infancy in Australia at that time, Crawford Productions developed a highly efficient integrated production schedule to combine studio scenes recorded on videotape with location footage captured on film for each weekly episode. Encouraged by the success of Homicide (which continued in production until 1975) their next drama project was the ambitious espionage drama Hunter (1967), which was purchased by the Nine Network. It starred Tony Ward and also made a star out of the actor who played its villain, Gerard Kennedy. Division 4 and Matlock Police After Hunter ended in 1969, a new police drama, Division 4 (1969) was conceived as a vehicle for Kennedy's talents and he became a dual Gold Logie winner, the series also screened on the Nine Network; the other stars included former game show host and newsreader Chuck Faulkner, Terry Donovan, and Ted Hamilton. Unlike Homicide, which concentrated on murder plots, Division 4 was set in a suburban Melbourne police station, and covered a broad range of police work, as well as occasionally featuring more light-hearted episodes. It too became an enduring popular success and earned Kennedy two Logie Awards. Crawford's next venture was a rural police series Matlock Police (1971), which was sold to the Network Ten. Like Crawford's other ventures it enjoyed success and popularity. It starred veteran Australian actor Michael Pate, who had spent many years in Hollywood in the 1950s and 1960s, and featured Paul Cronin, who was later given his own spinoff series: Solo One. With the success of Matlock Police, Crawford Productions cemented its position as Australia's leading drama production house and gained the unique distinction of having a successful weekly drama series running simultaneously on each of the three major commercial networks. Ryan and The Box In 1973, Crawford Productions created the action-adventure series Ryan (1973), starring Rod Mullinar as a private investigator. This was an all-film colour production (at a time when Australian TV was still in black and white and transitioning to colour) made to target overseas sales, but it only lasted one series and 39 episodes. In 1974, Crawfords moved into the realm of soap opera with its sex-comedy serial The Box, which was set in a TV station, UCV channel 12. With the top-rating 0-10 Network serial Number 96 as its lead in The Box was an instant success. Homicide, Division 4, and Matlock Police remained highly popular through the early 1970s, and The Box was a big hit in its premiere year, ranking as Australia's second highest-rated program for 1974. With a highly popular police drama on each commercial network, the production company was booming. However, in 1975 and 1976, Homicide, Division 4, and Matlock Police were all abruptly cancelled. It has been suggested that this was because Hector Crawford and several of the actors who featured in his shows figured prominently in the contemporary TV: Make It Australian campaign, agitating for stronger local content regulations to promote and protect local TV production. Though the ratings for The Box were significantly lower when compared to the figures from its first year, Crawford Productions decided to continue airing the show through 1975 and 1976. The Box was cancelled in early 1977 and production ended on the series 1 April 1977. The company also created situation comedy series The Bluestone Boys (1976) which was set in a prison, and Bobby Dazzler, a vehicle for pop singer John Farnham, in 1977. Bluey (1976) saw a return to police drama but with a new spin; however, the series was not a major success. The Sullivans and others Greater success came with The Sullivans (1976‚Äì82), a critically acclaimed and highly popular World War II family serial co-starring Lorraine Bayly and former Matlock lead Paul Cronin. Continuing the trend at that time for evening soap opera type shows on Australian television they later launched Cop Shop (1977‚Äì84), a meld of soap opera with the Crawfords staple of police drama, and the series emerged as a popular success. Cop Shop featured George Mallaby and former Bellbird star Terry Norris. Skyways (1979‚Äì81) replicated the soap opera-meets-weekly adult drama hybrid of Cop Shop in an airport setting, with less success. Later programmes included legal drama Carson's Law (1983‚Äì84), a vehicle for former The Sullivans star Lorraine Bayly, children's series Halfway Across the Galaxy and Turn Left and the popular outback medical drama The Flying Doctors. Acquisition The Company started life in small premises located in Little Collins Street, Melbourne, moved to the now heritage listed Olderfleet Building in Collins Street, then in 1972 to Southampton Crescent, Abbotsford, and in 1982 to Middleborough Road, Box Hill. The company was sold to WIN Corporation in 1989. Subsequent Crawfords drama productions included State Coroner, The Saddle Club, and Guinevere Jones. The Crawford studios in Box Hill, Victoria were demolished in March 2006 and a Bunnings Warehouse opened on the site on 30 June 2006. In 2009, Crawfords Australia had an eight-acre studio complex in Melbourne. While the company is still in existence, it currently does not produce television, concentrating instead on marketing DVD releases of the company's earlier dramas.

The NDA is located in Khadakwasla, Pune, Maharashtra. It is the first tri-service academy in the world. The alumni of NDA include 3 Param Vir Chakra recipients and 12 Ashoka Chakra recipients. NDA has also produced 27 service Chiefs of Staff till date. The current Chiefs of Staff of the Army, the Navy and the Air Force are all NDA alumni from the same course. The 137th course passed out on 30 November 2019, consisting of 188 Army cadets, 38 Naval cadets, 37 Air Force cadets and 20 cadets from friendly foreign countries. History A 1999 stamp dedicated to the 50th anniversary of the National Defence Academy, featuring its Sudan Block At the end of the World War II, Field Marshal Claude Auchinleck, then Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army, drawing on experiences of the army during the war, led a committee around the world and submitted a report to the Government of India in December 1946. The committee recommended the establishment of a Joint Services Military Academy, with training modelled on the United States Military Academy at West Point. After the independence of India in August 1947, the Chiefs of Staff Committee immediately implemented the recommendations of the Auchinleck report. The committee initiated an action plan in late 1947 to commission a permanent defence academy and began the search for a suitable site. It also decided to set up an interim training academy, known as the Joint Services Wing (JSW), which was commissioned on 1 January 1949 at the Armed Forces Academy (now known as the Indian Military Academy) in Dehradun. Initially, after two years of training at the JSW, Army cadets went on to the Military wing of the Armed Forces Academy for two years of further pre-commission training, while the Navy and Air Force cadets were sent to Britannia Royal Naval College Dartmouth and Royal Air Force College Cranwell in the United Kingdom for further training. In 1941, Lord Linlithgow, then Viceroy of India received a gift of ¬£100,000 from a grateful Sudanese Government towards building a war memorial in recognition of the sacrifices of Indian troops in the liberation of Sudan in the East African Campaign during World War II. Following partition, India's share amounted to ¬£70,000 (Rs 14 Lakh at the time; the remaining ¬£30,000 went to Pakistan). The Indian Army decided to use these funds to partly cover the cost of construction of the NDA. The foundation stone for the academy was laid by then Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru on 6 October 1949. Construction started in October 1949. The revised estimated cost for the whole project was Rs 6.45 crores respectively.PARLIAMENT SECRETARIAT (2 March 1954) PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES, HOUSE OF THE PEOPLE, OFFICIAL REPORT (Part Il‚ÄîProceedings other than Questions and Answers) VOLUME 1-1954. page 14.

The 10th JSW program was transferred from Clement Town, Dehradun to NDA Khadakwasla. Campus Aerial view of the Sudan Block of the Academy The NDA campus is located about 17 km south-west of Pune city, north-west of Khadakwasla Lake with the Sinhagad Fort providing a panoramic backdrop.. It spans of the donated by the Government of the former Bombay State. While many states had offered land for a permanent place for the Academy, Bombay got the honour, donating the most land including a lake and neighbouring hilly terrain. The site was also chosen for its proximity to the Arabian Sea and other military establishments, an operational air base nearby at Lohegaon as well as the salubrious climate. The existence of an old combined-forces training centre and a disused mock landing ship, HMS Angostura, on the north bank of the Khadakwasla lake which had been used to train troops for amphibious landings, lent additional leverage for the selection of the site. alt= Chhatrapati Shivaji memorial at the National Defence Academy The 17th century Maratha warrior king is considered as the Father of Indian Navy. The administrative headquarters of the NDA was named the Sudan Block, in honour of the sacrifices of Indian soldiers in the Sudan theatre during the East African Campaign. It was inaugurated by then Ambassador of Sudan to India, Rahmatullah Abdulla, on 30 May 1959. The building is a 3-storey basalt and granite structure constructed with Jodhpur red sandstone. Its architecture features an exterior design comprising a blend of arches, pillars and verandahs, topped by a dome. The foyer has white Italian marble flooring and panelling on the interior walls. The Habibullah Museum is also present on the campus. NDA has an excellent infrastructure for all-round training of cadets and a vast array of facilities like spacious and well-maintained classrooms, well-equipped labs, two Olympic size swimming pools, a gymnasium, 32 football fields, 2 polo grounds, a cricket stadium and a number of squash and tennis courts. The academic year is divided into two terms, viz. Spring (Jan. to May) and Autumn (July to Dec.). A cadet must undergo training for a total of six terms before graduating from the NDA.  Administration  =Commandants= The Commandant of the National Defence Academy is the head and overall in-charge of the academy. The Commandant is a three-star rank officer from the three Services in rotation. Major General Thakur Mahadeo Singh, DSO was the first commandant of JSW at IMA. Major General E Habibullah was the last head of the JSW and the First Commandant of NDA at Pune. Lieutenant General Asit Mistry, is the present commandant. Lt Gen Jatinder Singh, the twenty eighth commandant, was accused in a recruitment scandal and removed from his post for corruption. =Admission Process= Applicants to the NDA are selected via a written exam conducted by the UPSC in 1995, followed by extensive interviews by the Services Selection Board covering general aptitude, psychological testing, team skills as well as physical and social skills, along with medical tests. Incoming classes are accepted twice a year for semesters starting in July and January. About 4,50,000 applicants sit for each written exam every year. Typically, about 6,300 of these are invited to interview. The minimum age should be 16 and half years and maximum age should be 19 and half years. The number of students who were admitted to the Joint Services Wing of the National Defense Academy during 1953-54 is 572. Total application received in UPSC 6,061.https://eparlib.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/55676/1/lsd_01_06_02-03-1954.pdf Page 24 Applicants who join the Air Force through the flying branch also go through a test called Computerized Pilot Selection System or CPSS for short. About 370 cadets are accepted to the academy each semester. About 120 cadets are accepted for the Air Force, 42 for the Navy, 208 for the Army. Cadets who are accepted and successfully complete the program are sent to their respective training academies for one year of training before granting of commission: army cadets go to Indian Military Academy (IMA) at Dehradun, air force cadets to Air Force Academy (AFA) at Dundigal, Hyderabad, and naval cadets to Indian Naval Academy (INA) at Ezhimala, Kerala. Squadrons and Battalions A cadet is allotted to one of the 18 Squadrons. *No. 1 Battalion: Alpha Squadron, Bravo Squadron, Charlie Squadron and Delta Squadron. *No. 2 Battalion: Echo Squadron, Foxtrot Squadron, Golf Squadron and Hunter Squadron. *No. 3 Battalion: India Squadron, Juliet Squadron, Kilo Squadron and Lima Squadron. *No. 4 Battalion: Mike Squadron, November Squadron, Oscar Squadron and Panther Squadron. *No. 5 Battalion: Quebec Squadron and Romeo Squadron. Each squadron has approximately 100 to 120 cadets drawn from senior as well as junior courses under training in the Academy. As the number of cadets joining the NDA increased annually, the Defence Ministry of India sanctioned the raising of 16th, 17th and 18th squadrons in 2012, with the initial letter of their names being \\"P\\", \\"Q\\" and \\"R\\" respectively. The newly raised \\"Panthers\\" squadron won the Academy cross-country run championship in its first participation in Spring 2012. The prestigious Inter Squadron Championship Trophy is awarded to the best Squadron. The champion squadron has the proud tradition of possession of the Champion banner for one term, which is carried during the parade and other sports meets. Each Squadron has its own nickname, an individual identity with a richly textured history and mascot. The rudimentary import of the NDA's motto \\"Service before Self\\" is first taught in the environs of the Squadron, where a cadet learns the importance of putting the Squadron's requirements well above his own. Curriculum =Academics= The NDA offers only a full-time, residential undergraduate programme. Cadets are awarded a Baccalaureate degree (a Bachelor of Arts or a Bachelor of Science) after 3 years of study. Cadets have a choice of two streams of study. The Science stream offers studies in Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics and Computer Science. The Humanities (Liberal Arts) stream offers studies in History, Economics, Political Science, Geography and Languages. In both streams, academic studies are split into three categories. * In the Compulsory Course, cadets study English, Foreign Languages (Arabic, Chinese, French or Russian), Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, Computer Science, History, Political Science, Economics and Geography. Note that all cadets must take basic classes in all these subjects except Foreign Languages. Cadets then take advanced classes depending on their chosen stream. * The Foundation Course is mandatory and comprises Military Studies and General Studies. Subjects such as Military History, Military Geography, Weapons systems and Armaments, etc. are covered in Military Studies. Subjects such as Geopolitics, Human Rights, Laws of Armed Conflict and Environmental Sciences are covered in General Studies. * The Optional Course focuses on subjects specific to the cadet's chosen Service. Cadets spend the first four semesters on the Compulsory Course and the Foundation Course. They take the Optional Course during the fifth and sixth semesters. They may transfer to other Service academies for the optional courses.Academics. National Defence Academy =Training= All the cadets joining the NDA after their 10+2 Examination are trained in the Academy for three years culminating in graduation with BA(or)BSc or BCs (Computer Science) degree of Jawaharlal Nehru University; the first course to be awarded degrees was the 46th course in 1974. Apart from academic training they are also trained in outdoor skills, like Drill, PT and games; apart from one of the foreign languages up to the lower B1 level (according to the international standards). The emphasis in NDA is on character building, esprit-de-corps, mental and physical robustness, leadership and a sense of keen observation. Life in NDA is all about learning discipline and adhering self improvement. =Joint service training=  Air Force  The Air Force Training Team (AFTT) aims at training Air Force cadets in the basics of military aviation through ground training and flying training. Ground training is conducted with the help of modern training aids, aircraft models, and cross-sectional models of aero-engines and ng consists of a minimum of eight sorties on the Super Dimona aircraft. Cadets also get an exposure to deflection firing through Skeet shooting. Visits to key Air Force training establishments, Air Force Stations and civil aviation centers are also undertaken to give cadets first - hand experience of aviation activities. Visits to Air Force Academy, Air Wing at Indian Armament Technology, Air Base at Pune and College of Military Engineering are organised to enable the Air Force cadets to appreciate the Air Force aspects. Flying training at the AFTT is fully backed by an Automatic Weather Station, Air Traffic Control Station, a paved runway and a dispersal for six aircraft. The AFTT was formed towards the end of 1956. The aim of the AFTT is to introduce the VI Term cadets to gliding and allied professional subjects, which in turn prepares them for their professional training in the Air Force flying establishments. Over the last 60 years, the gliding training has evolved into flying training. Five different classes of gliders were acquired by the Academy since 1957. They are Sedberg T-21B, Baby Eon, Eon Olympica, Rohini and Ardhra gliders. All these gliders with the exception of the Baby Eon and Eon Olympics were utilised in the flying training of the cadets. The Sedberg T-21B was the mainstay of the AFTT in glider flying with each cadet being permitted a total of 60 training launches, after which 2-3 mandatory Solo Check launches were flown with the Chief Flying Instructor (CFI). Cadets cleared for solo flying flew one solo trip on the glider and were then formally awarded their 'Wings', exactly half the size of the official Indian Air Force wings, which were worn above the left shirt pocket of their formal uniforms. Sandbags were used as ballast in place of the absent instructor. The cadet who went solo with the lowest number of launches was usually awarded the Best In Gliding Trophy on the Guest Dining-in Night, one night prior to the Passing Out Parade. The Air Force cadet who stood first in Ground Subjects was awarded the Sqn Ldr Vasudev Memorial Book Prize that same night. The induction of Super Dimona in 2001 is a watershed moment in the history of AFTT introducing a huge jump in the quality of training. A \\"gliderdrome\\" runway was widened to 100‚Äô and extended to 5000‚Äô from earlier dimensions of 50‚ÄôX 3000‚Äô which is maintained within the premises of the NDA by the AFTT. The Air Force cadets of the academy now learn the basics of flying training at this facility on the Diamond Super Dimona HK36 aircraft.  Army  Cadet are imparted a blend of outdoor and indoor training. Outdoor training is carried out in the hilly and wooded terrain in and around the NDA campus. Indoor training includes theoretical and practical simulated training. Cadets are taught subjects such as tactical training, weapon training, map reading, military writing, field engineering, organisation and administration and radio telephony. Training visits to operational military establishments and bases are also incorporated to enhance the practical content of the training. During his stay at the NDA, an Army cadet is taught judging distances, terrain study, indication and recognition of targets, camouflage and concealment, trench digging, observation by day and night, stalking, organisation of an Infantry section, section formations, field signals and fire control orders. They are also taught handling of firearms, marksmanship and night firing. In addition, aspects of NBC Warfare and CI ops are also taught to the cadets. An Inter Squadron Bayonet fighting competition is held to inculcate a spirit of aggression and martial hue as also to teach the nuances of hand-to-hand combat. An Inter Squadron Firing Competition is also conducted to enhance levels of marksmanship and night firing skills. Camp Green Horn is conducted to introduce a second term cadet to the basic battle subjects such as map reading, tent pitching, fitting of web equipment, navigation, endurance training, compass reading and development of leadership qualities. Camp Rover is conducted to introduce a fourth term cadet to the basic battle subjects. In the sixth term Camp Torna, \\"recalling the first victory of Shivaji, a teenager\\" is conducted, where practical aspects are reinforced in simulated field conditions. The cadets are provided with opportunities to demonstrate leadership qualities in various tactical situations. Other aspects covered during the camp include navigation by day and night, quick attack at section level, patrolling, ambush, endurance training, and occupation of a Section Defended Post and conduct of a defensive battle at section level by night.  Navy  The Naval Training Team (NTT) is the oldest of the Training Teams at the NDA. The main task of the Naval Training Team is to train V and VI term naval cadets on Specialist Service Subjects both theoretical and practical. Naval cadets on completion of their 3 years of training go to Indian Naval Academy (INA) as their finishing academy for 1 year, where they commence their M.Sc degree along with cadets of INA who will be doing B.Tech. From 2015 army and air force cadets get naval training as well. The major emphasis is laid on Navigation, Seamanship and Communication. A total of 328 theoretical classes are conducted for VI term naval cadets. Theoretical instructions are imparted in the class room at NTT and Peacock Bay by using modern teaching methodology where-in 3D models, Computer Assisted Instruction (CAI) and Computer Based Training (CBT) packages, scaled down models are used. Practical instructions are imparted in the Watermanship Training Centre at Peacock bay during regular periods and during club days. TS Ronnie Pereira, the in-house scale model of a warship helps in imparting training. In order to orient the cadets to the navy, an orientation visit to Mumbai is conducted prior to the commencement of service training; during which the cadets visit various class of ships, submarines, shop floors, repair facilities etc. As part of the visit the naval cadets are sent to NBCD School to acquaint with fire fighting, damage control aspects. Further, to inculcate competitive spirit and adventurism amongst the cadets, VI term naval cadets are sent to Naval Academy, Ezhimala to take part in Open Sea Whaler Sailing Expedition and interact with their counterparts at the INA. Camp Varuna during the middle of the term to get a first-hand experience on board during sailing and Camp Varuna II at the end of the term to put the theoretical knowledge acquired at NTT into practical use during the three days' sailing. Watermanship Training Centre includes Yachting, Kayaking, Windsurfing, Rowing, Water-skiing, Ship Modeling.  Passing out  Passing Out Parade at the National Defence Academy on 30 November 2019. On 30 November 2019, the passing-out parade of the 137th course of the Academy was held with 284 cadets graduating. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh was the chief guest for the occasion. Alumni Alumni of the academy have led and fought in every major conflict in which India has participated since the academy was established. They have an illustrious record of numerous gallantry awards and achieving 3 Param Vir Chakras, 31 Maha Vir Chakras, 160 Vir Chakra, 11 Ashok Chakras, 40 Kirti Chakras and 135 Shaurya Chakras. 11 Chiefs of Army Staff, 10 Chiefs of Naval Staff and 4 Chiefs of Air Staff of the Indian Armed Forces have been NDA alumni. On 31 December, for second time in history, all three Chiefs will be from same NDA course. In the media The Standard Bearers, a documentary directed and written by Dipti Bhalla and Kunal Verma provides an inside look into the history and operations of the NDA. Another documentary film, My Flag, My Life, written by Ambarnath Sinha and directed by Nandan Khuhyadi and Sanjay Dabke, provides details about the life of NDA cadets, and is intended to create awareness about a career in the armed forces among the young generation. Books depicting NDA include the fictional \\"Boots Belts Berets\\" by Tanushree Podder, which is also being adapted into a web series. Outlook reported that over 1200 cadets quit NDA in ten years between January 2008 and November 2017.

Shred guitar includes \\"fast alternate picking, sweep-picked arpeggios, diminished and harmonic scales, finger-tapping and whammy-bar abuse\\", It is commonly used in heavy metal guitar playing, where it is includes rapid tapping solos, fast scale and arpeggio runs and special effects such as whammy bar \\"dive bombs\\". Metal guitarists playing in a \\"shred\\" style use the electric guitar with a guitar amplifier and a range of electronic effects such as distortion, which create a more sustained guitar tone and facilitate guitar feedback effects. The term is sometimes used with reference to virtuoso playing by instrumentalists other than guitarists, as well. The term \\"shred\\" is also used outside the metal idiom, particularly in bluegrass musicians and jazz-rock fusion electric guitarists. History Many jazz guitarists in the 1950s such as Les Paul, Barney Kessel and Tal Farlow improvised various guitar techniques comparing to contemporaries blues guitarists like Muddy Waters, Chuck Berry or Buddy Holly. Les Paul's song, \\"How High the Moon\\" contained sweep picking, one of the earliest recordings of the technique. Ronnie James Dio and Ritchie Blackmore in Norway, 1977 Ritchie Blackmore, best known as the guitarist of Deep Purple and Rainbow, was an early shredder. He founded Deep Purple in 1968 and combined elements of blues, jazz and classical into his high speed, virtuostic rock guitar playing. Songs like \\"Highway Star\\" and \\"Burn\\" from Deep Purple and \\"Gates of Babylon\\" from Rainbow are examples of early shred. Blackmore separated himself from the pack with his use of complex arpeggios and harmonic minor scales. His influence on Randy Rhoads and Yngwie Malmsteen was definitive for the evolution of the genre. In 1969, guitarist Jimmy Page from Led Zeppelin composed \\"Heartbreaker\\"; his guitar solo introduced many complex techniques mixed together (very fast note playing with hammer-ons and pull- offs). Page included excerpts of classical music in the solo when playing it live. Steve Vai commented in a September 1998 Guitar World interview: Randy Rhoads performing on stage in 1980 In 1969, Alvin Lee's lighting fast licks playing at Woodstock was also a prime example of early shredding. In 1974, the German band Scorpions used their new guitarist Ulrich Roth for their album Fly to the Rainbow, for which the title track features Roth performing \\"one of the most menacing and powerful whammy-bar dive bombs ever recorded\\". A year later, Roth's solo guitar playing for the album In Trance would become \\"the prototype for shred guitar. Everything associated with the genre can be found on this brilliant collection of songs‚Äîsweep-picked arpeggios, harmonic minor scales, finger-tapping and jaw-dropping whammy bar abuse\\". Eddie Van Halen soloing in 1977 In 1979, Roth left Scorpions to begin his own power trio, named \\"Electric Sun\\". His debut album Earthquake contained \\"heaps of spellbinding fret gymnastics and nimble-fingered classical workouts.\\" In 1978, Eddie Van Halen released \\"Eruption\\", a \\"blistering aural assault of solo electric guitar\\" which featured rapid \\"tapping\\". Chris Yancik argues that it is this record, above any other, that \\"spawned the genre of Shred.\\" Guitar Players article \\"Blast into Hyperspace with the Otherworldly Power of Shred\\" reviews the book Shred! and states that the pioneers were Ritchie Blackmore, jazz fusion player Al Di Meola and Eddie Van Halen. Randy Rhoads and Yngwie Malmsteen advanced this style further with the infusion of neo-classical elements. Progressive rock, heavy metal, hard rock, and jazz fusion have all made use of and adapted the style successfully over the years. In general, the phrase \\"shred guitar\\" has been traditionally associated with instrumental rock and heavy metal guitarists. This association has become less common now that modern forms of metal have adopted shredding as well. In the 1990s, its mainstream appeal diminished with the rise of grunge and nu metal, both of which eschewed flashy lead guitar solos. Lesser known guitarists like Shawn Lane and Buckethead continued to develop the genre further in the 90s. In an interview in March 2011, Steve Vai described \\"shred\\" as: Playing style Yngwie Malmsteen in Barcelona, Spain, 2008 Shredding includes difficult guitar techniques such as \\"sweep, alternate and tremolo picking; string skipping; multi-finger tapping; slurs, [and] trills.\\" Shred guitarists use two- or three-octave scales, triads, or modes, played ascending and descending at a fast tempo. Often such runs are arranged in the form of an intricate sequential pattern, creating a more complex feel. Guitarists refer to a prepared sequence of notes as a 'lick', which may be incorporated into an otherwise improvised solo, or used for practising. Guitarists often 'trade licks' with each other, sharing such sequences. The lick can be played by multiple-picking notes (alternate picking), or picking just the first or second note of a string followed by a rapid succession of hammer-ons and/or pull-offs (slurs). Rhythmically, a shredder may include precise usage of syncopation and polyrhythms. Sweep picking is used to play rapid arpeggios across the fretboard (sometimes on all strings). The tapping technique is used to play rapid flourishes of notes or to play arpeggios or scalar patterns using pure legato with no picking (the picking hand is used to \\"tap\\" notes on the fretboard). Various techniques are used to perform passages with wide intervals, and to create a flowing legato sound. Some performers utilize complex combinations of tapping, sweeping, and classical-style finger picking. This increases speed by reducing the motion of the plucking hand. The 2000s-era focus on rapid guitar playing is centered around speed competitions using mainly the classical music piece Flight of the Bumblebee, which includes very rapid playing. Many shred guitarists such as Tina S who shreds Heavy Metal and classical music including pieces from Beethoven, Paganini, and Vivaldi, demonstrate their mastery of the piece and others on sites like YouTube. Equipment Shred guitar players often use electric solid-body guitars such as Ibanez, Gibson, Fender, Kramer, Kiesel/Carvin, Jackson, Charvel, Schecter and ESP. Some shred guitarists use elaborately-shaped models by B.C. Rich or Dean, as well as modern versions of classic-radical designs like Gibson's Flying V and Explorer models. Tremolo bars (also known as \\"whammy bars\\"), which are hinged bridges that can be bent down or up in pitch, are an important part of shred playing, as they permit the \\"dive bombing\\" effect and many sounds which are not possible with a fixed- bridge instrument. Guitars with double-cutaways give performers easier access to the higher frets, allowing extended room for the fretting hand to get extended reach onto the higher notes of the fretboard. Some shred guitarists, such as Scorpions' Ulrich Roth, have used custom-made tremolo bars and developed modified instruments, such as Roth's \\"Sky Guitar, that would greatly expand his instrumental range, enabling him to reach notes previously reserved in the string world for cellos and violins.\\" Most shred guitar players use a range of effects such as distortion and audio compression units, both of which increase sustain and facilitate the performance of shred techniques such as tapping, hammer-ons, and pull-offs. These and other effects units, such as delay effects are also used to create a unique tone. Shred-style guitarists often use high-gain vacuum tube amplifiers such as Marshall, Carvin, Peavey, Soldano, Mesa Boogie, Orange Amplification, Laney, Hughes & Kettner and Randall. To facilitate the use of audio feedback effects with the guitar, shred guitarists use high gain settings, distortion pedals and high on-stage volume. In media In 2003, Guitar One Magazine voted Michael Angelo Batio the fastest shredder of all time. In the same year, Guitar One voted Chris Impellitteri the second fastest shredder of all time followed by Yngwie Malmsteen at third. In 2011, Guitar World magazine focused on shredding outside the heavy metal music genre with an article discussing the magazine's Top 5 Shredding Bluegrass songs. The list included songs by instrumentalists Tony Rice, Josh Williams, Bryan Sutton, Chris Thile and David Grier. Music Radar's list of the top 20 greatest shred guitarists of time featured Al Di Meola, John Petrucci and Steve Vai as the top three, respectively. Guitar World ranked Al Di Meola ‚Äì Elegant Gypsy, Van Halen ‚Äì Van Halen, and Ozzy Osbourne ‚Äì Blizzard of Ozz (featuring Randy Rhoads on guitar), as the top three shred albums of all time, respectively. In 2017, Jawbone Press released the book Shredders!: The Oral History of Speed Guitar (and More) by author Greg Prato, which explored the entire history of shred guitar. The book featured a foreword by Alex Lifeson and an afterword by Uli Jon Roth, and featured all new interviews with Joe Satriani, Steve Vai, Billy Sheehan, Paul Gilbert, George Lynch, Kirk Hammett, Michael Schenker, Ace Frehley, Guthrie Govan, and Alexi Laiho, among others.

It merged with the Scottish Division, to form the Scottish, Welsh and Irish Division; at the same time the Mercian Regiment joined with the King's Division. History The Prince of Wales's Division was formed in 1968 with the union of the Mercian Brigade, Welsh Brigade and Wessex Brigade. The depot was established at Whittington Barracks in Staffordshire. Under the restructuring announced in 2004, the Prince of Wales's Division was reorganised into two large regiments: *Royal Welsh - formed on 1 March 2006 by amalgamation of the 1st Battalion, Royal Welch Fusiliers, 1st Battalion, Royal Regiment of Wales (24th/41st Foot) and the Royal Welsh Regiment. *Mercian Regiment - formed on 1 September 2007 by amalgamation of the 1st Battalion, 22nd (Cheshire) Regiment, 1st Battalion, Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment (29th/45th Foot), 1st Battalion, Staffordshire Regiment (The Prince of Wales's) and the West Midlands Regiment. In 2014 the Royal Irish Regiment joined the division. The Division comprised the following infantry battalions:Heyman, p. 89 *Regular Army Units 1st (Cheshire) Battalion, The Mercian Regiment 2nd (Worcestershire and Sherwood) Battalion, The Mercian Regiment 1st (Royal Welsh Fusiliers) Battalion, the Royal Welsh 1st Battalion, the Royal Irish Regiment *Army Reserve Units 4th Battalion, the Mercian Regiment 3rd Battalion, the Royal Welsh 2nd Battalion, the Royal Irish Regiment The Division maintained a regular army band, The Band of The Prince of Wales Division through the amalgamation of the two former divisional bands, the Clive Band and the Lucknow Band. Under the Army 2020 reorganisation, the 3rd Battalion, Mercian Regiment (Staffords) and the 2nd Battalion, Royal Welsh (Royal Regiment of Wales) will both be disbanded, while the Royal Irish Regiment (27th (Inniskilling), 83rd, 87th and Ulster Defence Regiment) will be transferred to the administration of the Prince of Wales' Division. In December 2016, the government announced changes to the administrative structure of the infantry as part of the continuing reorganization of the Army under \\"Army 2020\\". This saw the Mercian Regiment being moved to the King's Division, with the Royal Regiment of Scotland (which encompassed the entirety of the Scottish Division) transferred to a single administrative formation with the Royal Welsh and the Royal Irish Regiment. This new administrative formation became known as the Scottish, Welsh and Irish Division.

This phrase is currently primarily a term of political advocacy, used to draw attention to unwise decision making that either is not the most effective available or is potentially even harmful. This phrase is a diffuse neologism. The phrase originated in the early 1990s with Professor John D. Graham, a tenured professor of policy and decision sciences at Harvard University's school of Public Health and director of the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis. This phrase appears in the Congressional Record in February, 1995 where he is quoted thus \\"John Graham, a Harvard professor, who said, 'Sound science means saving the most lives and achieving the most ecological protection with our scarce budgets. Without sound science, we are engaging in a form of \\"statistical murder,\\" where we squander our resources on phantom risks when our families continue to be endangered by real risks.\\" In 2001 he was appointed the head of the U.S. Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs in the Office of Management and Budget by George W. Bush, making him the top regulator for the United States. Because the analysis underlying the term was controversial among those interested in U.S. government policy, the senate confirmation process for nomination made the term more widely known. To show that something is statistical murder requires that a comparative risk analysis be done on the available alternatives. This is akin to a cost-benefit analysis but does not entail the translation of lives and health into dollars. However, if other types of benefits are to also be evaluated, the comparative risk analysis approach is not viable, so a cost-benefit analysis must be done. Additionally, the concept implies that the inefficiently spent resources could in fact be transferred to a more effective alternative. This requires that regulators and policy makers with budgetary authority at least allow such transfers and preferably use cost-benefit analysis to plan the budgeting. This was not the practice at the time the phrase was coined, and has not yet become standard practice in the U.S. Criticism of concept Some people object to the required analysis because they believe it is always wrong to put a financial value on human life. They would have no objection to a risk assessment because it only measures lives lost. However, with this limitation it also cannot value any effects other than the number of human lives lost - including non-fatal human diseases, effects on non-human species, and effects on human activities and enjoyment. It is quite possible to make errors in the statistics used to do the analysis, and in 2002 Richard Parker, a law professor at the University of Connecticut, argued that all the widely published studies suffered from unacceptable flaws. An alternative view, taken by some policy analysts, is that it is not sufficient to look solely at outcomes, but also at feelings. If a risk is perceived to be significant, but is in fact insignificant, it may nonetheless be appropriate to respond in some way to that risk. Proponents of this view suggest using an expected utility calculation instead. (Link is a draft. Final form published in 2003.)

Biography He was born into a peasant family at Gorsleben in present-day Thuringia. By the exercise of his musical talents he earned money enough for the start, at Helmstedt, of a university career, which the aid of a wealthy patron enabled him to continue at Leipzig. He became director of the music-school at Pforta in 1572. In 1594 he was transferred to Leipzig in the same post, including directing the Thomanerchor at the Thomaskirche.Motette in der Thomaskirche. Sonabend, den 20 September 2008. Leipzig: Merkur. He retained this post until his death in Leipzig, despite the offers successively made to him of mathematical professorships at Frankfurt and Wittenberg. Calvisius was also a significant astronomer: in his Opus Chronologicum (Leipzig, 1605, 7th ed. 1685) he expounded a system based on the records of nearly 300 eclipses. An ingenious, though ineffective, proposal for the reform of the calendar was put forward in his Elenchus Calendarii Gregoriani (Frankfurt, 1612); and he published a book on music, Melodiae condendae ratio (Erfurt, 1592).

The narrative of Kacha is mentioned in the MahƒÅbhƒÅrata, the Matsya Purana and the Agni Purana.Pargiter, F.E. (1972). Ancient Indian Historical Tradition, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, pp.196, 196ff. He was known for learning Mrityu Sanjivini Mantra (a hymn for reviving the dead) but failed to bring many dead Devas back to life due to earning the wrath and curse of Shukracharya's daughter Devayani.  As a disciple to Shukracharya  Kacha was sent by his father Brihaspati to learn the secret of the Mrita Sanjivini mantra from Shukracharya, the guru of the Asuras. The idea was to help the Devas with the knowledge of this secret who were about to lose the war. Brihaspati also advises him to first impress Devayani in order to impress Shukracharya, who was very fond of his daughter. Kacha follows his advice and unknown to him Devayani falls in love with him. In the meantime, the Asuras want to kill Kacha, as he might be dangerous if he learns the Mantra. Every time they kill him, Shukracharya revives him with his art on the insistence of Devayani. The Asuras finally kill him, burn his body and mix his remains with alcohol. Shukracharya comes to know of this fact by his meditation and he rushes to the court of asuras and consumes all the alcohol. Later he tries to revive Kacha who was now in his stomach. He teaches Kacha the Mantra and tells him to come out. Kacha comes out by tearing his guru's stomach open and brings his life back with the help of Mantra. Kacha starts his journey back to Deva loka when Devayani expresses her love for him and asks him to marry her. Kacha tells her that she is like a sister to him as she was the daughter of his guru, equivalent to father according to Hindu Dharma. This infuriates Devayani whereby she curses him that he will not remember and never get to use the Mrityu Sanjivini Mantra during the time he needs it the most. During a fierce battle between the Devas and the Asuras, Kacha decided to use the Mrityu Sanjivini Mantra to bring back all the dead Devas to life but during this moment, Devayani's curse activates and this causes him not to remember the mantra. This brought an upper hand for the Asuras in the great battle between Devas and Asuras.

Its origins lay in \\"Light Companies\\" formed during the late 18th century, to move at speed over inhospitable terrain and protect a main force with skirmishing tactics. These units took advantage of then-new technology in the form of rifles, which allowed it to emphasise marksmanship, and were aimed primarily at disrupting and harassing enemy forces, in skirmishes before the main forces clashed. Formed in 1803, during the Napoleonic Wars, the Light Division was raised thrice thereafter: during the Crimean War, the First World War and from 1968 to 2007. Some light infantry units remained outside the Light Division. Origins of the Light Division The British Army's first three \\"Rifle Battalion\\" was raised by the 60th (Royal Americans) in 1797‚Äì99.Elliott-Wright, pp. 47 The command of this first rifle battalion was given to Francis de Rottenburg, who had extensive experience with light infantry. While the 60th did not officially become part of the Light Division, it and Rottenburg were influential in terms of British Army doctrine regarding rifle-armed light infantry. In 1800, an \\"Experimental Corps of Riflemen\\", was raised by Colonel Coote Manningham and Lieutenant-Colonel the Hon. William Stewart ‚Äì drawn from officers and other ranks from drafts of a variety of British regiments. The corps differed in several regards from the Line infantry of the British Army. Most significantly, it was armed with the formidable Baker rifle, which was more accurate and of longer range than the musket, although it took longer to load. As the rifle was shorter than the musket, it was issued with a 21-inch sword bayonet. Riflemen wore dark green jackets rather than the bright red coats of the British line infantry regiments of that time; pantaloons, rather than breeches; black leather facings and belts rather than white and; a green plume on their \\"stovepipe shakoes\\". They were trained to work alone or in pairs, in open order and to think for themselves. Napoleonic Wars Four months after its formation, the Rifle Corps was judged ready for its first operation. On 25 August 1800, three companies, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel William Stewart, spearheaded a British amphibious landing at Ferrol, Spain, where the Rifles helped to dislodge the Spanish defenders on the heights. However the expedition was defeated and withdrew the following day. In 1801, one company of the corps, under the command of Captain Sidney Beckwith, served as marksmen aboard Royal Navy ships at the First Battle of Copenhagen. During the battle, the Rifle Corps suffered one lieutenant killed, its first officer to fall, and two other ranks killed and six wounded, some of whom died later. (In 1847 the Admiralty made the Naval General Service Medal with the clasp \\"Copenhagen 1801\\" claimable by surviving veterans, including members of the Rifle Corps.) In January 1803, the corps became an established regular regiment and was renamed the 95th Regiment of Foot (Rifles). On 17 July 1803, an unofficial \\"Corps of Light Infantry\\" was formed, by brigading together the * 43rd (Monmouthshire Light Infantry) Regiment, the * 52nd (Oxfordshire) Regiment of Foot (Light Infantry) and the * 95th Regiment. (The name \\"Light Division\\" was not used until several years later.) General Sir John Moore finished training the 43rd, 52nd, and 95th in September 1805. Because the three Rifle battalions of the 60th Royal Americans were already wearing the green clothing and black leather equipment that were typical of continental light infantry,Elliott-Wright, pp. 45-46 the 95th Rifles adopted the same uniform as the 60th. But despite the best efforts of Moore, the other light infantry regiments were ordered to conform to the regulations for light companies of line regiments by retaining their red jackets. Armed with the Baker rifle and wearing dark green uniforms, the Green Jackets were hard to spot and spent their time sniping at enemy officers, NCOs and any other figure of authority in an enemy formation. A well-aimed shot could bring down an enemy commander with ease, lowering morale in the enemy. The Baker Rifle had far greater accuracy and range than the standard muskets of the time and the men using them were considered marksmen, trading devastating firepower for superior accuracy and range. In 1807, Denmark while officially neutral, was suspected by the British of planning to ally itself with France. The corps of light infantry (43rd, 52nd and 95th Regiments) led by Sir Arthur Wellesley, the future Duke of Wellington, was part of a force that defeated Danish forces at the Siege of K√∏ge and Second Battle of Copenhagen, and with it the entire Danish fleet. The Corps of Light Infantry, under Moore, sailed for Spain for what would become known as the Peninsular War. The campaign established the value of light infantry armed with rifles. Four further battalions were trained by Rottenberg in the Curragh of Kildare in Ireland during May 1808. Later, Rottenberg returned to England and, at Brabdourn Lees barracks in Ashford, retrained the 68th, 85th and 71st Regiments as light infantry, to help meet the demand for such troops in the Peninsula.Elliott-Wright, pp. 57 During the Peninsular war of 1808‚Äì1809, Ca√ßadores Battalions of the Portuguese Army were attached to the Light Division. =Battle of Corunna= The Battle of Corunna, (16 January 1809), was an attack by 16,000 French under Marshal Soult during the amphibious evacuation of 16,000 British under General Sir John Moore. Moore had hoped to draw the French Army away from Portugal, to allow the small British force in that country to be reinforced, and to allow the Spanish armies to reform. Hugely outnumbered, Moore was forced to retreat. Made in a harsh winter and under constant pressure, the retreat severely tried his men. The exhausting marches, cold weather and frequent skirmishes with the pursuing French units saw many fall to illness or exhaustion, or to turn to alcohol and become so drunk that they were left behind. The Light Division (then the Light Brigade) was one of the few units that kept its discipline and, along with units of British cavalry, fought a series of rearguard actions against the French. The brigade then fought at Corunna where the French were repulsed. It was then sent to Vigo for embarkation. 52nd (Oxfordshire) Regiment of Foot (Light Infantry), early 1800s Thomas Plunket was a Rifleman in the 95th Rifles. During the retreat Plunket shot the French G√©n√©ral de Brigade Auguste-Marie-Fran√ßois Colbert at a range of between 200 and 600 metres using a Baker rifle.Hadaway, Stuart.Costello, Edward - 'Rifleman Costello' First published in 1841 titled \\"The Adventures of a Soldier\\" Costello served with Plunkett and can both cite personally witnessed experiences and the legend he already was at the time Plunket had run forward to make this shot, and before returning to his own lines he reloaded, and shot a trumpet-major who had rushed to the aid of the fallen general. This second feat showed that the first shot had not been a fluke, and the deaths were sufficient to throw the pending French attack into disarray. The shots were at a sufficiently long distance to impress others in the 95th Rifles, whose marksmanship (with the Baker rifle) was far better than the ordinary British soldier who, armed with a Brown Bess musket, was trained to shoot into a body of men at 50 metres with volley fire.The Weapons Collection: Technical Notes - Introduction REME Museum of technology. See paragraph six in the section \\"Development of the lock\\" =Battle of Talavera= While reforming in England after their evacuation from Corunna, Brigadier-General Robert Craufurd was ordered to take his brigade, now composed of the 1st Battalion of the 43rd, 1st Battalion of the 52nd and 1st BattalionAlexander Craufurd's biography of General Craufurd suggests it was 2nd battalion of 95th, below page 42. of the 95th, back to the Peninsula.Elliott-Wright, p. 99 The brigade landed at Lisbon on 2 July 1809 and embarked on a series of grueling marches in the July heat to join Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington's army. Wellesley fought and won the battle while the Light Brigade was still pouring sweat on the road, although at times it averaged 30 miles per day. The Riflemen of the 60th performed sterling service in their absence, being one of the few regiments mentioned by name in Wellesley's dispatch to the British government. During the reorganizations that followed, Craufurd was given command of the 3rd Division, whose previous commander, Major-General Mackenzie, had been killed at Talavera.Elliott-Wright, p. 100 With the subsequent addition of Captain Hew Ross's troop of Royal Horse Artillery, the 1st Hussars of the K.G.L. and the Portuguese 3rd Ca√ßadores Battalion (commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel George Elder), this became the Light Division.' Craufurd also wrote the first Standing Orders for the Light Division, a training manual and handbook.Alexander Craufurd, \\"General Craufurd and His Light Division\\", (1893), p.42 =Battle of the River C√¥a= Craufurd's operations on the C√¥a and √Ågueda in 1810 were daring to the point of rashness; the drawing on of the French forces into what became the Battle of the River C√¥a (24 July 1810), in particular was a rare lapse in judgement that almost saw his removal from command. Although Wellington censured him for his conduct, he at the same time increased his force to a full division by the addition of two picked battalions of Portuguese Ca√ßadores, Chestnut troop, Royal Horse Artillery (RHA) & part of the 14th & 16th, Light DragoonsCrauford p 100ff =Battle of Bussaco= The Battle of Bussaco, (27 September 1810) was a defensive battle won by the Allies which allowed Wellington to resume the retreat of his army into the previously fortified Lines of Torres Vedras. He reached these by 10 October. Finding the lines too strong to attack, the French withdrew into winter quarters. Deprived of food and harried by British hit-and-run tactics, the French lost 25,000 men captured or dead from starvation or sickness before they retreated into Spain early in 1811, freeing Portugal from French occupation except for Almeida, near the frontier. During the retreat, the Battle of Sabugal was also fought. =Battle of Sabugal= The Battle of Sabugal (3 April 1811), Craufurd had taken ill and was home in England so the Division was under the command of Major-General William Erskine, the plan was for the Light Division and two brigades of cavalry to circle behind the French open left flank while the other four divisions attacked the front. On the day of the battle there was a heavy fog, the other commanders decided to wait until visibility improved. Undeterred, Erskine ordered Lieut-Colonel Thomas Sydney Beckwith's 1st Brigade forward. Instead of crossing the C√¥a beyond the French, the brigade drifted to the left in the fog, crossed at the wrong location and struck the French left flank. Erskine, who was very nearsighted and mentally unbalanced, then became cautious and issued explicit instructions to Colonel George Drummond not to support his fellow brigade commander. At this point, Erskine rode off to join the cavalry, leaving the Light Division leaderless for the rest of the battle. The French switched most of their 10,000-man corps against Beckwith's 1,500 and pressed the light infantry back. When Drummond heard the sounds of battle approaching, he deduced that Beckwith's men were retreating. Disobeying orders, Drummond led his 2nd Brigade across the C√¥a and joined Beckwith. Together they drove the French back. =Battle of Fuentes De Onoro= At the Battle of Fuentes de Onoro (3 May 1811) the 51st Foot and 85th Light Infantry, along with the Light Division demonstrated how the French Cavalry could be beaten by a combination of rapid movements, accurate rifle fire and disciplined formations. During the battle the Light Division was sent to reinforce the 51st and 85th Light Infantry, who had been caught in open ground and surrounded by French Cavalry. When reinforced, the whole force was able to retire rapidly ‚Äì chased by the French cavalry. Whenever the French came close, the light infantrymen, riflemen and ca√ßadores, rapidly formed squares at the last safe moment, beating off the cavalry. This series of rapid moves, combined with the disciplined forming of squares ‚Äì off the line of march, was a spectacle that few could have believed was possible.Chartrand p.77 =Siege of Ciudad Rodrigo= The Division, now once again under the command of Major-General Robert Craufurd, was involved in the Siege of Ciudad Rodrigo (8 January 1812), where they stormed and took the Grand Teson redoubt. Then on 19 January together with Major-General Thomas Picton's 3rd Division they were ordered to storm the city. Picton's Division assaulting the greater breach in the northwest of the city's walls while the Light Division was sent against the lesser breach in the north. Launched at 7 pm, the assault was completely successful, although amongst the dead were Major-Generals Henry Mackinnon and Craufurd. The victory was somewhat marred when the British rank and file thoroughly sacked the city, despite the efforts of their officers. =Battle of Salamanca= Following on from the Siege of Ciudad Rodrigo and the death of Crauford the Division now under the command of Charles Alten, was held as the reserve division for the Battle of Salamanca (22 July 1812) and did not take a major part in the fighting. =Battle of Vitoria= At the Battle of Vitoria (21 June 1813), the division was part of the Right Center Column under Wellington's personal direction. Wellington launched his attack in four columns, and after hard fighting the enemy's centre was broken and soon the French defence crumbled. About 5,000 French soldiers were killed or wounded and 3,000 were taken prisoner, while Wellington's forces suffered about 5,000 killed or wounded. 152 cannons were captured, but King Joseph Bonaparte narrowly escaped. The battle led to the collapse of Napoleonic rule in Spain.Gates, p.386 =Battle of the Pyrenees= During the French withdrawal across the Pyrenees and into France the Light Division was involved in the Battle of the Pyrenees (25 July 1813) and the Battle of the Bidassoa (1813) (7 October 1813), during which the toughest fighting of the day occurred in Major General Bertrand Clausel's center sector. John Colborne's brigade of Charles Alten's Light Division attacked La Bayonette. Not waiting for the attack, the French charged downhill and drove back the 95th Rifles. Suddenly the 52nd appeared and quickly turned the tables. Following closely behind the retreating French, they overran the redoubt with surprising ease. Meanwhile, James Kempt's second Light Division brigade and Francisco de Longa's Spanish division attacked up two spurs of Mont Larroun to secure some positions. The next day the French abandoned the position to avoid encirclement. =Battle of Nivelle= The Battle of Nivelle (10 November 1813), started just before dawn as the Light Division headed towards the plateau on the summit of the Greater Rhune (the summit had been garrisoned by French troops but they had fled after the skirmish on the River Bidassoa, fearing to be cut off from their own army). The objective of the division was to sweep the three defensive forts constructed by the French out of the battle. They moved down into the ravine in front of the Lesser Rhune and were ordered to lie down and await the order to attack. After the signal from a battery of cannon, the offensive began. It started with the 43rd, 52nd and 95th ‚Äì with the Portuguese Ca√ßadores in support, storming the redoubts on the crest of the Rhune. Despite this being a risky move and the men being almost exhausted, the surprise and boldness of the British sent the French fleeing towards other forts on other hills. While the 43rd and 95th were dealing with the French on the Rhune, there still remained one very strong star-shaped fort below on the Mouiz plateau which reached out towards the coast. This was attacked by Colborne's 52nd, supported by riflemen from the 95th. Once again, the French were surprised and the British succeeded. They had, in the French eyes, appeared from the ground at which point, in danger of being cut off, the French soldiers quickly fled leaving Colborne in possession of the fort and other trenches without loss of a single fatal casualty. =Battle of Toulouse= The final action of the Peninsula War was the Battle of Toulouse, (10 April 1814), In the evening of 10 April 1814, Marshall Soult, received an official communiqu√© from Paris informing him that Napoleon had surrendered to the Coalition forces in northern France. Unsure of what to do, Soult's generals advised him to surrender the city, as reinforcements were unlikely to arrive and further news reached Toulouse informing Soult of the surrender of French armies across France. This ended the Peninsula War. Claimed to be one of the strongest divisions in the British army in the Peninsula War, the Light Division proved its tough nature in the numerous actions it had been involved in from the infamous retreat to Corunna right up until the invasion of France in 1814 and the conclusion of the war at the Battle of Toulouse. =Structure during the Peninsular War= *Commanding Generals: Robert Craufurd, William Erskine, Charles Alten *1st Brigade 1/43rd (Monmouthshire Light Infantry) Regiment 1/95th Rifles 3/95th Rifles (HQ & 5 companies) 3rd Portuguese Ca√ßadores. *2nd Brigade 1/52nd (Oxfordshire) Regiment of Foot (Light Infantry) 2/95th Rifles 1/17th Portuguese Line 2/17th Portuguese Line 1st Portuguese Ca√ßadores. *Divisional Troops Ross' Troop, Royal Horse Artillery Part of the 14th Light Dragoons Part of the 16th Light Dragoons Waterloo After the abdication of Napoleon in 1814 and his exile to the island of Elba, the Peninsula army was dismantled and divided. Following Napoleon's escape and return to power in France, there was one more battle to fight. A Light Division by name was not formed for Waterloo but the Light Infantry battalions, excepting the 1st battalion of the 95th which was assigned to the 5th Division, were massed into the 3rd British Brigade assigned to the 2nd Division. The 3rd Brigade was commanded by then Major-General Frederick Adam. The other brigades were foreign troops with the 1st Brigade consisting of 4 line battalions of the Kings German Legion and 3rd Brigade consisting of four battalions of Hanoverian Landwehr (militia). Since the British army had so few light troops, 16 of 21 light infantry battalions in the Allied Army at Waterloo came from allied forces. The 3rd British Division, for example, had over 2,300 light infantry in King's German Legion and Hanoverian battalions.Nofi, p. 305-311 The final action of the day saw Sir John Colborne bring the 52nd Light Infantry round to outflank the Old Guard, of the French Imperial Guard as it advanced towards the British centre in a last-ditch attempt to defeat Wellington. As the column passed his brigade, the 52nd charged, fired a destructive volley into the left flank of the Chasseurs and attacked with the bayonet. The whole of the Guard was driven back down the hill and began a general retreat to the cry of \\"La Garde recule\\" After their unsuccessful attack on the British centre, The French Imperial Guard made a last stand in squares on either side of the La Belle Alliance. The 3rd (Light) Brigade charged the square which was formed on rising ground to the (British) right of La Belle Alliance and again threw them into a state of confusion. The other square was attacked by the Prussians. The French retreated away from the battle field towards France. =Structure at Waterloo= * 2nd (Light) Brigade 52nd (Oxfordshire) Regiment of Foot (Light Infantry), (the biggest battalion at Waterloo)Moorsom, W S, (ed). \\"Historical Record of the Fifty-Second Regiment (Oxfordshire Light Infantry) from the year 1755 to the year 1858\\". 2nd edition.

Preface A Light Division was again formed for service, but this was in name only as no light infantry battalions were assigned to it. The division was involved in the Battle of the Alma (20 September 1854), which is usually considered the first battle of the Crimean War, took place in the vicinity of the River Alma in the Crimea. An Anglo-French force under General St. Arnaud and Lord Raglan defeated General Menshikov's Russian army, which lost around 6,000 troops. They were also engaged in the Siege of Sevastopol (1854‚Äì1855), and the battle of Battle of Inkerman (5 November 1854) before the end of hostilities. =Structure during the Crimean War= *Commanding General:Lieutenant General Sir George Brown *First Brigade:Major General William Codrington 33rd Regiment of Foot 23rd The Royal Welch Regiment of Fusiliers 7th Regiment of Foot *Second Brigade:Major General Sir George Buller 77th (East Middlesex) Regiment of Foot 88th Regiment of Foot (Connaught Rangers) 19th (1st North Riding of Yorkshire) Regiment of Foot *One troop of Royal Horse Artillery *one field Battery Royal Artillery By the late 19th century the concept of fighting in formation was on the wane and the distinctions between light and heavy infantry began to disappear. Essentially, all infantry became light infantry in practice. Some regiments retained the name and customs, but there was in effect no difference between them and other infantry regiments. World Wars During the First World War two Light Divisions were formed the 14th (Light) Division (they were the first division to be attacked by Germans using flamethrowers), and the 20th (Light) Division. Both served on the Western Front and were involved in the major battles, including the Battles of the Somme, Battles of Arras and the Battles of Ypres. The British Army did not form a Light Division for service during the Second World War, with the exception of the 61st Division, which was briefly redesignated as one in the final months of the war. The ethos of the Light Division, however, was carried on in new infantry formations such as the Commandos, Parachute Regiment and the Chindits all lightly armed fast and agile units. 1968‚Äì2007 After the Second World War the British Army had fourteen infantry depots, each bearing a letter. Infantry Depot J at Farnborough was the headquarters for the six English light infantry regiments and Infantry Depot O at Winchester was the headquarters for the two rifle regiments and the Middlesex Regiment. In 1948, the depots adopted names and this became the Light Infantry Brigade and Green Jackets Brigade.Whitaker's Almanack 1956, p. 471 Then in 1968 the Light Division was reformed as an Administration Division with the regimentation of the Light Infantry Brigade and the Green Jackets Brigade.Whitaker's Almanack 1969, p. 473 As formed, the Light Division comprised seven regular infantry battalions: *1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th Battalions, The Light Infantry *1st, 2nd and 3rd Battalions, The Royal Green Jackets The Light Infantry lost its 4th Battalion in 1969, while both regiments lost a battalion in 1992. In 2005, two further regiments were attached to the Light Division: *1st Battalion, The Devonshire and Dorset Light Infantry *1st Battalion, The Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Light Infantry This was in preparation for all four regiments being amalgamated into a single large regiment named The Rifles, which was formed in February 2007. Regimental names of the regiments that formed The Rifles were not maintained. As a consequence, upon the formation of The Rifles, the name Light Division was no longer to be used. Before that in 2005 a new manoeuvre brigade appeared in the British Army, 19th Light Brigade, as a fast, agile, lightly armed Brigade to balance the mix of Heavy and Light Brigades in the British Army order of battle.

He writes under the name Dale Smith, and has had previous works published and performed under the names Paul Smith and Paul D. Smith. He is most well known for work on various Doctor Who spin-offs. Biography Smith was born in Leicester in 1976, and has been writing since the age of 8. In his youth, he worked as a youth worker at his school, receiving training on various aspects of the job including child abuse awareness. Early in his career, he wrote stage plays but has recently turned to writing prose as \\"it's still almost impossible to get anything actually produced\\". He has stated that his ambition is to \\"be Ian Rankin, lock stock and house in Edinburgh. But I'll settle for just being able to keep writing and keep getting stuff seen by people\\". In his spare time he draws and creates digital pictures, and also plays the guitar.  Career  Smith's first published work was a poem published in the Leicester Mercury about Native Americans. He was still a pupil at junior school at the time. By the time he had moved to secondary school, he had had several fan fiction short stories published in Cosmic Masque, the fiction magazine of the Doctor Who Appreciation Society and this encouraged him to submit two short stories to Marvel UK's Doctor Who Magazine. These were published in the Brief Encounters section, some of the last stories published before the feature was discontinued. Whilst writing short stories, Smith was also studying at Soar Valley Community College, Leicester, where he developed a keen interest in the theatre. He joined Jez Simons' Haithi Productions youth theatre group where he appeared in Simons' and Joyti Patel's The Fire Dragon at the Phoenix Arts Centre alongside future ER cast member Parminder Nagra. He entered the Independent Radio Drama Productions (IRDP) Young Radio Playwright Competition 1994 with the play Hello?, after re-writing the ending at Simons' suggestion. He won the competition, and the radio play was broadcast on LBC and performed at the Cambridge Theatre, before transferring to the Old Red Lion Theatre for a four-week run. Following the success of Hello? (with reviews calling the play \\"35 minutes of tense drama\\" and \\"frighteningly direct . . . it will haunt you for a long time afterwards.\\") IRDP produced another of Smith's plays. The Kissing Game enjoyed a four-week run at the Tristan Bates Actors Centre, and following a relocation to Manchester to read Drama at Manchester University, Smith continued to have work produced: he was runner up in the 1997 Manchester Student Playwriting Competition before winning outright in 1998 with the play A Night on the Tiles. This was followed by a play set in and around Northampton during the Battle of Naseby. Whilst the BBC considered Heritage for their Past Doctor Adventures range, Smith continued to write short Doctor Who stories, and during 2001 he had stories published in three major charity anthologies: Missing Pieces, The Cat Who Walked Through Time and Walking in Eternity. Smith has acknowledged the role these stories played in his successful commission, saying, \\"It can't be coincidence that the month that I was contacted about my proposal was also the month it was announced I had stories in the three biggest charity anthologies of the year, can it?\\" After graduating from university, Smith worked part-time at Manchester University's John Rylands University Library, where he met his future wife. He returned to writing Doctor Who with the novella The Albino's Dancer, published as part of the Telos Time Hunter range, which was followed in turn by short stories for Big Finish Productions' Short Trips and Bernice Summerfield ranges. Smith wrote a paper in the academic textbook Time and Relative Dissertations in Space edited by David Butler and the novel The Many Hands for the BBC's New Series Adventures range. Most recently he contributed a short story to the Obverse Books' collection, Wildthyme in Purple and edited the collection The Perennial Miss Wildthyme, for which he also contributed a short story.

Huntington High School, commonly referred to as just Huntington High School (opened in 1927) was a black high school located in the East End section of Newport News, Virginia, USA during the era of racial segregation. After desegregation, it became an integrated intermediate school (eighth and ninth grades), and in 1981 was converted to a middle school (sixth through eighth grades). The school was named after the shipping and railroad pioneer, Collis P. Huntington, who founded the local shipyards, the Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Company, at one time the largest shipbuilding concern in the world. Lutrelle Palmer, the principal of Huntington High, also a strong NAACP advocate, whose own wages were supplemented by voluntary parental contributions, in November 1937 chastised his daughter for accepting a job in Newport News that paid her a third less per month than a beginning white teacher earned. This led to a unanimous vote by the Virginia State Teachers Association to file equal-pay lawsuits in partnership with the NAACP. This move paved the way to a statewide campaign attacking the legal basis for school segregation. Palmer was sacked from the school in 1943 for his activism. Huntington's football team, coached by Thad Madden from 1943 through 1971, had 28 straight winning seasons, compiling a 251-114-16 record. Madden's Huntington teams won sixteen Virginia Interscholastic Association eastern District titles and seven VIA state championships.

Svenska Dagbladet described him as one of the most important authors in modern Swedish literature. Biography Sven Lindqvist was born in Stockholm in 1932. He held a PhD in History of literature from Stockholm University (his thesis, in 1966, was on the Swedish poet Vilhelm Ekelund) and a 1979 honorary doctorate from Uppsala University. In 1960‚Äì1961, he worked as cultural attach√© at the Swedish embassy in Beijing, China. From 1956 he was married to the sinologist Cecilia Lindqvist (nee Norman), with whom he had two children. In 1986 he married the economist Agneta Stark. He published some 35 books, mainly documentary essays and books along with travel writing. He lived in the S√∂dermalm area of central Stockholm. Lindqvist wrote more than thirty books of essays, aphorisms, autobiography, documentary prose, travel and reportage. He occasionally published articles in the Swedish press, writing for the cultural supplement of the largest Swedish daily, Dagens Nyheter, since 1950. He was the recipient of several of Sweden's most prestigious literary and journalistic awards. His works have been translated into English, Danish, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Korean, Portuguese, and Spanish among other languages. The books Exterminate all the Brutes and A Lover's Diary are included in Jan Gradvall's 2009 Tusen svenska klassiker (\\"A Thousand Swedish Classics\\"). He died on 14 May 2019 at the age of 87. Genres and themes Lindqvist's work was mostly non-fiction, including (and often transcending) several genres: essay, documentary prose, travel writing and reportage. He was known for his works on developing nations in Africa and the Saharan countries, China, India, Latin America and Australia. In the 1960s, partly inspired by the works of Hermann Hesse, Lindqvist spent two years in China. He became fascinated by the legend of the Tang dynasty painter, Wu Tao Tzu, who, when standing looking at a mural of a temple he had just completed, \\"suddenly clapped his hands and the temple gate opened. He went into his work and the gates closed behind him.\\"Sven Lindqvist, The Myth of Wu Tao-Tzu. (London: Granta, 2012), p. 1 In the 1970s he established the Dig Where You Stand Movement in Sweden, which was influential in Germany and elsewhere in promoting public history from the workers' perspective. His later works, from the late 1980s, tended to focus on the subjects of European imperialism, colonialism, racism, genocide, degradation of the natural environment, and war, analysing the place of these phenomena in Western thought, social history and ideology. Major works nuclear test site near Maralinga, South Australia. =Terra Nullius= Among Lindqvist's best-known works is his 2007 book Terra Nullius (Latin for \\"Empty Land\\"), about the impact of white settlers on the Australian landscape and its aboriginal population, combined with \\"often glorious\\" travel writing. Among the shocks to people and landscape are the above-ground nuclear weapon tests conducted in Australia from 1953 to 1963, leaving some 20 kilograms of plutonium dust spread over hundreds of miles of the land near Maralinga. Lindqvist remarks that the land will remain radioactive for at least 280,000 years, and notes that the weapons thus tested could \\"on a single order\\" turn the whole world into a Terra Nullius. =Exterminate all the Brutes= Conrad's Mr Kurtz, who travels up the Congo in a riverboat, as Conrad did in the Roi des Belges (pictured). Lindqvist's favourite among his books was his 1996 Exterminate all the Brutes, first published in Swedish in 1992 as '. Its title is taken from a phrase uttered by the murderous racist imperialist Mr Kurtz in Joseph Conrad's 1899 novella Heart of Darkness. As a boy, Lindqvist had seen a photograph of the emaciated corpses at Buchenwald concentration camp. He stated that the image of Nazi atrocity and the novella came together in his mind, and in Exterminate all the Brutes he argues that Hitler grew up in a time when the whole of the Western world was \\"soaked in the conviction\\" that imperialism was a biological necessity that inevitably destroyed \\"the lower races\\". Lindqvist argued controversially that this had already killed millions in genocides before Hitler's application of the principle to white people, and noted that his book had resulted in academic study of the \\"effect of colonial atrocities on Nazi crimes\\". =A History of Bombing= The book most admired by critics in English was his 2001 A History of Bombing (first published in Swedish in 1999 under the title Nu dog du, meaning \\"[Bang bang] you're dead\\"). The book has a \\"fractured structure\\" with 399 short chapters or sections. Lindqvist described it as \\"a labyrinth with twenty-two entrances and no exit\\", an emblem of the disruption that bombing causes. Each section is numbered; many sections end with an arrow pointing to another number, sometimes far ahead in the book, sometimes back, forming a hypertext-like network. The book argues that bombing is driven by \\"the dream of exterminating from the air with minimal risk\\" to the bombing nation. Lindqvist provides multiple examples of the Royal Air Force's use of this tactic against colonies which were in revolt from 1919 onwards.

Retrieved June 24, 2012. Professional career Ford made his first feature film, Mascot in 1930, after a year of making short silent films. He did not use sound until The Legion of the Streets (1932). When World War II began, Ford escaped to the Soviet Union and worked closely with Jerzy Bossak to establish a film unit for the Soviet-sponsored People's Army of Poland in the USSR. The unit was called Czo≈Ç√≥wka Filmowa Ludowego Wojska Polskiego (or simply Czo≈Ç√≥wka; spearhead). After the war, Ford was appointed head of the government-controlled Film Polski and held enormous sway over the country's entire film industry. In the process of accumulating power he denounced a fellow film director, Jerzy Gabryelski, to the NKVD secret police, contentiously accusing him of \\"reactionary\\" and \\"antisemitic\\" views, which resulted in Gabryelski's arrest and torture.Marek Chodakiewicz: After the Holocaust. Polish - Jewish relations 1944-1947. Ford and a group of colleagues from the Polish Communist Party rebuilt most of the country's film production infrastructure. Roman Polanski wrote in his biography about them: \\"They included some extremely competent people, notably Aleksander Ford, a veteran party member, who was then an orthodox Stalinist. [‚Ä¶] The real power broker during the immediate postwar period was Ford himself, who established a small film empire of his own.\\" For the next twenty years, Ford served as professor at the state-run National Film School in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ (Pa≈Ñstwowa Wy≈ºsza Szko≈Ça Filmowa). He is perhaps best remembered for directing the first postwar documentary Majdanek - cmentarzysko Europy (Majdanek ‚Äì the Cemetery of Europe) and the feature film Knights of the Teutonic Order (1960), based on a novel of the same name by Polish author Henryk Sienkiewicz. Ford, a self-identified Communist, used his films to \\"express social messages on the screen,\\" as in his documentaries: the award- winning Legion ulicy, (The Street Legion, 1932), Children Must Laugh (1936) and the postwar Eighth Day of the Week (1958) rejected by the communist party censors during the Polish October. Ford continued making films in Poland until the 1968 Polish political crisis. Accused of antisocialist activity and expelled from the Communist Party, Ford emigrated to Israel where he lived for the next two years. He later moved to Denmark and eventually settled in the United States. Ford made two more feature films, both of which were commercial and critical failures. In 1973, he made a film adaptation of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's novel The First Circle, a Danish-Swedish production that recounted the horrors of the Soviet gulag. In 1975 he made ', an English language, Israeli-German co-production based on the heroic story of Dr. Janusz Korczak. Blacklisted by the Polish communist government as a political defector, Ford became a non-person in contemporary discussions and analysis of Polish filmmaking.

Despite this, and his current residence in Istanbul, he had disputes with chess organizers in his country, so he declared himself to be a resident of Bosnia and Herzegovina, his ancestral home. During the 2000 Chess Olympiad in Istanbul, Atalik insisted on playing for Bosnia rather than Turkey. As a result, the organizers of the Olympiad banned him from the competition. After the selection of the new national chess federation he returned to the Turkish national team. In 2003, he took first at Mar del Plata. In 2007 he tied for first with Michael Roiz at the Gorenje Valjevo Tournament. Atalƒ±k won the 3rd and 4th Mediterranean Chess Championships in Antalya, Turkey and Cannes, France respectively.

He was born in Beja to a plebeian family, and studied Latin and rhetoric with the Oratorians in Lisbon, Portugal. He became professed as an Augustinian in 1778, but owing to his turbulent character he spent a great part of his time in prison,and was constantly being transferred from one convent to another, finally giving up the monastic habit to live licentiously in the capital. In 1792 he was unfrocked, but by the aid of powerful friends he obtained a papal brief which secularized him and permitted him to retain his ecclesiastical status. Taking to journalism and preaching he now made for himself a substantial living and a unique position. In a short time he was recognized as the leading pulpit orator of the day, and in 1802 he became one of the royal preachers. Macedo was the first to introduce from abroad and to cultivate didactic and descriptive poetry, the best example of which is his notable transcendental poem Meditation (1813). His made an attempt to supersede Lu√≠s de Cam√µes as Portugal's greatest poet, and in 1814 he produced Oriente, an epic dealing with the same subject as the Os Lus√≠adas, namely Vasco da Gama's discovery of the sea route to India. This amended paraphrase met with a cold reception, whereupon Macedo published his Censura dos Lusiadas, containing a minute examination and virulent indictment of Cam√µes. Macedo founded and wrote for a large number of journals, and the tone and temper of these and his political pamphlets induced his leading biographer to name him the chief libeller of Portugal, though at the time his jocular and satirical style gained him popular favor. An extreme adherent of absolutism, he expended all his powers of invective against the Constitutionalists, and advocated a general massacre of the opponents of the Miguelist r√©gime. Notwithstanding his priestly office and old age, he continued his aggressive journalistic campaign, until his own party, feeling that he was damaging the cause by his excesses, threatened him with proceedings, which caused him in 1829 to resign the post of censor of books for the Ordinary, to which he had been appointed in 1824. When he died in 1831 he left behind him many friends, a host of admirers, and a great but ephemeral literary reputation. His ambition to rank as the king of letters led to his famous conflict with Bocage, whose poem Pena de Taliao was perhaps the hardest blow Macedo ever received. His malignity reached its height in a satirical poem in six cantos, Os Burros (1812‚Äì1814), in which he pilloried by name men and women of all grades of society, living and dead, with the utmost licence of expression. His translation of the Odes of Horace, and his dramatic attempts, are only of value as evidence of the extraordinary versatility of the man, but his treatise, if his it be, A Demonstration of the Existence of God, at least proves his possession of very high mental powers. As a poet, his odes on Wellington and the emperor Alexander show true inspiration, and the poems of the same nature in his Lyra anacreontica, addressed to his mistress, have considerable merit.

The series then ran five nights a week, Mondays to Fridays, as a 30-minute serial. It was produced solely by Network Ten (as an in-house production) with a start-up budget of almost $1 million. Set in a fictitious shopping mall (hence the \\"Arcade\\" of the title) in the northern suburbs of Sydney, Arcade dealt with the lives and loves of the characters who worked at the various stores within the shopping complex. Production  The plan was to have the show on the air before the ratings season started to build an audience, however the serial quickly proved itself a ratings disaster, which actually caused the shows on rival networks it was programmed against to improve in the ratings. A total of 50 episodes were actually shot and produced, but the series was cancelled after six weeks, so only 30 episodes ever went to air. Theme music  The disco-style, metaphoric theme song \\"(Walking Through an) Arcade\\" was composed by New Zealand-born Mike Perjanik and performed by Australian singer Doug Parkinson. The opening title sequence feature aerial shots of a real building and shopping arcade, which was actually the exterior of the famous Strata Motor Hotel located on Military Road, in Sydney's North-Shore suburb of Cremorne. Set designs  The show's set was one of the biggest and most realistic ever built for an Australian television series at that time. Rupert Murdoch and Network Ten spent almost $1 million to pour a new concrete floor in Studio A at the Sydney Channel 10 studios; install a complete new lighting grid and lighting system; new editing software; upgraded control rooms and cameras and, of course, the construction of the massive Arcade set itself. Not long before the show was axed, there was talk the series might be moved to a later timeslot allowing it to become a bit \\"raunchier\\" (similar to the hit series Number 96) and a large new set had been built featuring a \\"western-style\\" saloon bar, so that more of the action could take place in a venue that supplied alcohol. There were also moves (before the show was axed) to have some of the regular characters \\"perform\\" in the bar/nightclub setting, as many of the actors appearing in the show had a background as cabaret artists, singers, comedians and so on, and it was felt that these skills should be utilised and might help save the series. However, the series was cancelled before these plans could be brought to fruition. =The shops= The shops featured in the initial episodes were: *Kitty's Record Bar (a record and tape store) *Aristocrat (a dry cleaning store) *FlashBack Leisure Centre, (a pinball parlour) *Toby's, (a sit down restaurant) *Pendleton's Health Studio (a health and workout studio) *The Bookworm (a book store and news agency) *Magda's Gifts, (a gift shop) *Surf 'n' Ski (a sports shop specializing in water sports) In later episodes, a small (illegal) casino was introduced in an apartment above the Arcade - many of the characters lived in apartments above the Arcade - and at the time the series was taken off the air, a large new set had been built featuring a nightclub and bar called \\"The Sawmill\\". The pilot episode The 76-minute pilot episode was produced by Bill Harmon and Perter Bernados who had earlier produced the highly successful soap opera Number 96. Arcade also employed Number 96's creator David Sale and its veteran scriptwriter Johnny Whyte as scriptwriters. Like Number 96, there was some room for light comedy as well as drama. Rupert Murdoch had acquired what was then the 0-10 Network in 1979 and had Channel ATV 0 in Melbourne change its call sign from 0 to 10 in January 1980 to make the network complete. So the launch of the pilot (or \\"movie-length opening episode\\") of Arcade was seen as the \\"flagship\\" program of the brand-new Network Ten. On the night it aired (Sunday 20 January 1980), the 0‚Äì10 Network officially became known as Network Ten to reflect ATV-0's transition to ATV-10 ‚Äì although the Brisbane station continued to broadcast as TVQ-0 until 10 September 1988. On 27 December 1987, Adelaide's SAS-10 gave ADS-7 the affiliation rights of Network Ten, and became known as ADS-10. (Perth's NEW-10 did not go to air until 1988.) Cast Long running Number 96 actor Mike Dorsey was cast in a regular role in the series, playing Vic Marshall, the owner of the pinball parlour. Vic's paraplegic daughter Tina (who worked in the pinball parlour with her overprotective father) was played by South Australian newcomer Christine Harris, whilst Coral Drouyn went on to become a successful scriptwriter Other recognisable actors in the cast included another Number 96 veteran, Aileen Britton who played Joyce Blair, the haughty woman who ran the Aristocrat Dry Cleaning store with her comical husband Walter, played by one time vaudeville comedian Syd Heylen. Tracy Mann played Susie Blair, Joyce and Walter's dry and slightly sardonic daughter, who helped out at her folks dry cleaners, after returning home from a religious cult she fled from. Joy Miller, played Kitty Adams, a former cabaret singer who was the owner of Kitty's Record Bar and Danny Adcock as Duncan Adams, Kitty's estranged husband and former showbiz manager, who are constantly arguing. Peggy Toppano (the mother of Peta Toppano of Prisoner fame) played gossipy Miriam Buxton, who ran the Bookworm News Agency with her somewhat more exuberant, thrice-divorced sister Molly Sparks, played by Lorrae Desmond. Molly's energetic but bumbling son, Joey Fellows, was played with comic relish by Greg Bepper. The prissy Miriam lived with Molly and Joey temporarily. Maggie Stuart appeared as grasping vixen Iris Pendleton, (the villain of the piece) who co-owned the Pendletons Health Studio with her nerdy brother-in-law Norman (Garth Meade), whom she is conniving to get rid of, with the aid of the dim-witted gym instructor Len Crosby (Bill Charlton), with whom she became pregnant. Iris had been married to Norman's late brother, Michael. Coral Drouyn, billed as Coral Kelly, played Consuela McPhee, the newly hired 'full figured' receptionist at the Health Studio, who was despised by the vengeful Iris. Despite this, Consuela and Norman became a mismatched set of friends. Annie Semler (wife of Oscar-winning cinematographer Dean Semler) got a lot of media attention at the time for playing the outrageous, somewhat provocative but very well-meaning Hungarian gift shop owner Magda Yokochek. Magda was quite the hilarious character, with her continually calling everyone \\"darling\\"; her mangling of the English language (she called what she sold \\"Knicker knockeries\\") and her interactions with her tax advisor, Mr. Sponge. However, more seriously, Magda was an illegal immigrant who was looking for a wealthy man to marry to secure her residency in Australia. Lucy Taylor and Raymond Nock as Si Wan and Philip Soo, the mother and son operators of Toby's (the sit-down restaurant), and Sinan Leong played the spoiled and pampered Mee Ling, Si Wan's daughter, and Philip's sister who balked at working at the family restaurant. In the 'shocking' storyline in the early episodes, Philip, a potential Olympic swimmer, realised he was falling in love with his sister. Fortunately, that attraction fizzled, and Mee Ling was arranged to marry a much older man named Chang Li. Patrick Ward played conceited - and rather dimwitted - Craig Carmichael, who owned the Surf-n-Ski Sports shop, but spent most of his time trying to get work as a male model. His girlfriend Di Smith, played by former ballerina Olga Tamara, managed the shop on his behalf. Jeremy Kewley played Robbie Stewart, a mysterious young man who turns out to be the younger brother of Craig Carmichael (whose real name was Stan Stewart, but he had changed it to Craig Carmichael which he thought was a sexier name for a male model). it would be later revealed that Di was the daughter of a wealthy man, and it was she who had gotten Craig his successful modeling jobs. She was tempted to blab this secret when he got quite obnoxious. She would also get mad at him later on when he had an affair with troublemaking Iris. Cast members after Arcade Many actors in the series, went on to have successful careers, after the ill-fated Arcade ended, both Lorrae Desmond and Syd Heylen went on to become long time cast members of A Country Practice, whilst Jeremy Kewley, Tracy Mann and Christine Harris went on to have high-profile television and film careers, whilst Coral Drouyn went on to become a successful television scriptwriter. Jeremy Kewley went on to star in successful series like Janus and Stingers, and playing lead roles in movies like Frank & Jerry and Disappearance and became popular as the audience warm- up comedian on the AFL version of The Footy Show for almost two decades. [Tracy Mann won awards for her roles in films like Hard Knocks and Fast Talking and starred in popular series including Prisoner, the 1984 ABC-TV series Sweet and Sour, and the 1990 police drama Skirts, as well as popular Australian mini-series such as Sword of Honour and Cyclone Tracy. Tracy and Kewley starred together in the ABC-TV legal drama series Janus from 1994‚Äì1995. Christine Harris went to play major roles in several 1980s soap operas - The Young Doctors, Carson's Law, Prisoner and Neighbours. Coral Drouyn retired from acting after Arcade and changed her career to script-writing, becoming story editor on Prisoner, Blue Heelers and Home and Away.

Between the First and Second World Wars, the British produced a series of similar light tanks. They saw use in training, and in limited engagements with British Empire units such as the South African Army during the East African Campaign of 1941. All were around in weight and capable of on roads and around cross- country. The British did not expect their light tanks to be used against anything except other light tanks at most and as such armament was a machine gun only‚ÄîVickers machine guns firing either a .303 inch or .0.5 inch (12.7 mm) round. Suspension was Horstmann coil spring on bogies. The engine was a Meadows six-cylinder petrol. Up until the Mk V, they were crewed by a driver- commander and gunner. The Mk V had a driver, a gunner and a commander helping on the gun. The various marks were produced in relatively small numbers. By the Mark V, the design was more or less optimised and it was the final development of in the form of the Light Tank Mk VI which was chosen for the British Army expansion programme in expectation of war. The following designations in the sequence Light Tank Mk VII \\"Tetrarch\\" and Light Tank Mk VIII \\"Harry Hopkins\\" were produced by Vickers but unrelated to the series of light tanks Mk I to Mark VI.  Development  =Tankettes= A Carden-Loyd tankette towing a howitzer Following the activities of the Experimental Mechanized Force in the late 1920s, the British Army identified a need for two light tracked vehicles; one to carry a machine gun for the infantry and one with a turret for the Royal Tank Corps. The Carden-Loyd tankette became the infantry vehicle, at the same time Carden privately developed a number of light, two-man tank designs. The Carden Mark VII design was accepted as a prototype for the army's light tank. By that point Carden-Loyd was part of Vickers-Armstrong. Only a few of the first light tanks were built and, although never issued per se, gave useful information for subsequent developments. A Carden-Loyd Mk.VI The Mark VII was a small machine gun-armed vehicle with a Meadows engine which gave it a maximum speed of . Suspension was two 2-wheel leaf sprung bogies on either side with an external girder to give the suspension strength. Considered a reconnaissance vehicle and a mobile machine gun position, the Mark VI was the final stage of development of the Carden-Loyd series of tankettes. The Carden-Loyd tankette was the prototype for the Universal Carrier. = Tank, Light, Mk I = The Mark I differed in a few points from Carden's Mark VII tankette. The external suspension girder was dropped by strengthening the suspension at the hull supports. The bevelled turret was replaced by a cylindrical design but still carried a single 0.303 Vickers machine gun. Giving it a \\"basis\\" of armour, increased weight and dropped the top speed to . The Meadows engine drove the tracks though a four- speed gearbox to the front drive wheels. Steering was a combination of de- clutching the drive to one track and braking to tighten the turn. The track was tensioned by a rear idler‚Äîwhich, being set at the same height as the drive sprocket, was new in British tank designs‚Äîand returned over three rollers. The Mark IA had a larger superstructure and a larger turret to give room for operating the machine gun. Horstmann suspension with horizontal coil springs replaced the leaf springs of the Mark I. Although it could give an easy ride under moderate conditions, the springs could, under certain circumstances, cause an uncontrollable bounce. The Mark IA tanks sent to India in 1931 for trials received modifications to improve engine cooling in the hotter climate and various means were experimented with to reduce the heat for the crew as well. * Mk I: four or five made, based on the Carden-Loyd Mk VIII * Mk IA: five produced, four of these were sent for trials in India = Tank, Light, Mk II = The Mark II used a Rolls-Royce engine which was, along with the Wilson preselector gearbox and transmission, on the right-hand side of the tank. This left the left-hand side free for the driver and commander. Tanks for use in India had an Meadows engine and a \\"crash\\" gearbox. The turret was rectangular in form and the machine-gun was modified for vehicle use with a pistol grip instead of the spade grips of the infantry version. * MK II: 16 built by Vickers Armstrong from 1929 * Mk IIA: 29 constructed at the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich * Mk IIB: 21 built by Vickers-Armstrong The running gear of the Vickers Light Dragon Mark I artillery tractor used the tracks and suspension of the Light Tank Mk II, and that of the Light Dragon Mark IIA used the components from the Light Tank Mk IIA. = Tank, Light, Mk III = Mk III Vickers Light 5-ton tank The Mark III light tank suspension was made out of Horstmann coil springs controlling bogies with two rubber-lined wheel sets per bogie. This design, invented by Sidney Horstmann and exclusively used on lightweight vehicles, was also used up to the Light Tank Mk VI. Apart from being relatively easy to build, compact and lightweight, it had the advantage of having a long travel and was easy to replace when damaged in the field.Horstmann history The drive sprocket was in the front while the idler- wheels were placed in the rear, with two return rollers. Power came in the form of a Henry Meadows six-cylinder petrol engine, producing , coupled with a four-speed preselector gearbox. Steering was a combination of de-clutching the drive to one track and braking to increase the turn. The traverse of the turret was electrically actuated. * Forty-two produced from 1934. Rolls-Royce engine and Wilson gearbox. Extended rear superstructure. Revised suspension. Thirty-six sent to Egypt. * The Royal Netherlands East Indies Army ordered 73 Mk IIIBs in 1937 and they were used during the Dutch East Indies campaign against Japan * Modified for Belgium as the Vickers T-15 light tank * A single Vickers Light Dragon Mark IIB artillery tractor (which used the chassis and running gear from the Light Tank Mk III) was purchased by Belgium. It was considerably modified to produce the much heavier T-13 B3 tank destroyer armed with a 47 mm Model 1931 anti-tank gun. These vehicles were made in Belgium under licence in Familleureux, Hainaut, by the . = Tank, Light, Mk IV = Light Tank Mk IV The Mark IV saw use in training, and weighed about five tonnes. These models had crews of two and were armed with Vickers machine guns. The idler wheels were removed, with the bogie wheels being respaced. Although some were still in use at the start of the war, they were removed as not fit for service in armoured divisions. * A Vickers design of 1933, 34 built from 1934 = Tank, Light, Mk V = The biggest change from the Mark IV to the Mark V was the introduction of a three-man crew. The turret now carried the commander and the gunner, who was also the radio operator. The increase in the crew size increased the tank's effectiveness and spread the maintenance load. Until then, the commander had to direct the driver, navigate and operate the gun. If troop commander, he also directed the other tanks and their fire. Light Tank Mk V The armament of the Mark V was an improvement over the earlier marks; a 0.5 inch Vickers machine gun was added to the existing 0.303. The bigger gun gave the tank a reasonable capability against other light tanks‚Äîat the time most European light tanks had around of armour‚Äîbut it was not updated as light tanks with more armour came into use. It was half a ton heavier‚Äîand about 18 inches longer‚Äîthan the Mark IV. The weight increase had the effect of reducing the top speed to though range was largely unchanged. The first tanks produced were sent along with a team from Vickers to the 1st Battalion RTC. This unusual level of co-operation between manufacturer and user led to rapid resolution of problems and implementation of improvements. During 1936, 22 were produced. = Light Tank Mk VI = Light Tank Mk VIB The Light Tank Mk VI was a continuation of the Mark V design. It also had a three-man crew but a larger turret to accommodate a radio set and had an 88 hp engine for higher speed, despite the heavier weight. Between 1936 and 1940, over 1,300 Mark VIs were built, in several variants that represented solutions to problems with the initial design. = Commercial Carden-Loyd tanks = The basic form of the light tank was used by Vickers for export markets. This included the 1933, 1934, 1936 and 1937 models. Buyers included Finland, Lithuania, Latvia, Argentina, Belgium, Switzerland, the Dutch East Indies and China. Forty-two were produced for Belgium in 1935, based on the Mark III with a different turret on request of Belgium's armed forces. Armed with a French 13.2 mm Hotchkiss machine gun, they were designated Char L√©ger de Reconnaissance Vickers-Carden-Loyd Mod.1934 T.15 by the Belgians. After two tanks had been bought for trials in 1937, the Dutch East Indies in 1938 ordered a further 73 tanks of the 1936 model, which was \\"mechanically similar\\" to the Mark IV but with a hexagonal turret and the armament of a Mark II. Only 20 tanks arrived on Java before the outbreak of the Second World War in Europe, and those which were not delivered were taken into service with the British Army as the \\"Tank Light, Vickers Carden-Loyd, Model 1936\\" - in practice they were referred to by the nickname \\"Dutchman\\". They were used for training duties only. A number of these tanks were delivered to Greece.  Service history  The light tanks were kept in use for training until around 1942. Some saw active use in the Battle of France, the Western desert or Abyssinia from 1940‚Äì1941. They were followed by the Light Tank Mk VI from 1936. Like many of its predecessors, the Mark VI was used by the British Army to perform imperial policing duties in British India and other colonies in the British Empire, a role for which it and the other Vickers-Armstrongs light tanks were found to be well suited.

AnƒÅgƒÅmins are the third of the four aspirants. The anƒÅgƒÅmin is not reborn into the human world after death, but into the heaven of the Pure Abodes, where only anƒÅgƒÅmins reside. There they attain full enlightenment (arahantship). Requisites for becoming an anƒÅgƒÅmin An anƒÅgƒÅmin is free from the lowest five chains or fetters (Sanskrit: ; Pali: pa√±corambhƒÅgiyƒÅni- sa·πÉyojanƒÅni; ‰∫î‰∏ãÂàÜÁµê) which are as follows: #Belief in ƒÅtman or self (Sanskrit: ' or svakƒÅya-d·πõ·π£·π≠i; PƒÅli: sakkƒÅya-di·π≠·π≠hi; ÊúâË∫´Ë¶ã) #Attachment to rites and rituals (Sanskrit: ≈õƒ´lavrata-parƒÅmar≈õa-d·πõ·π£·π≠i; PƒÅli: sƒ´labbata-parƒÅmƒÅsa-di·π≠·π≠hi; ÊàíÁ¶ÅÂèñË¶ã) #Skeptical doubt (Sanskrit: vicikitsƒÅ; Pali: vicikicchƒÅ; Áñë) #Sensuous craving (kƒÅmarƒÅga; Ê¨≤Ë≤™) #Ill will or aversion (vyƒÅpƒÅda or byƒÅpƒÅda; ÁûãÊÅö) The remaining five higher fetters (Sanskrit: pa√±ca-≈´rdhvabhƒÅgiya-sa·πÉyojana; Pali: pa√±cuddhambhƒÅgiyƒÅni-sa·πÉyojanƒÅni; ‰∫î‰∏äÂàÜÁµê) from which an anƒÅgƒÅmin is not yet free are: #Craving for fine-material existence (the first 4 jhanas) (r≈´parƒÅga; Ëâ≤Ë≤™) #Craving for immaterial existence (the last 4 jhanas) (ar≈´parƒÅga; ÁÑ°Ëâ≤Ë≤™) #Conceit or pride (mƒÅna; ÊÖ¢) #Restlessness (Sanskrit: auddhatya; Pali: uddhacca; ÊéâÊåô) #Ignorance (Sanskrit: avidyƒÅ; Pali: avijjƒÅ; ÁÑ°Êòé) KƒÅmarƒÅga and vyƒÅpƒÅda, which they are free from, can also be interpreted as craving for becoming and non-becoming, respectively. AnƒÅgƒÅmins are at an intermediate stage between the sak·πõdƒÅgƒÅmin and the arhat. An arhat enjoys complete freedom from the ten fetters, while an anƒÅgƒÅmin's mind remains very pure. Five types of anƒÅgƒÅmin The Pali Puggalapannatti and the Sanskrit texts MahƒÅpraj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ≈õƒÅstra and the SarvƒÅstivƒÅdin-Vaibha·π£ika Abhidharma both describe five classes of anƒÅgƒÅmin. When an anƒÅgƒÅmin is reborn in the Pure Abodes, one of the five following scenarios will occur: #He will attain arhatship immediately after rebirth or within the first half of his life in the Pure Abodes. Such a being is called \\"one who reaches NibbƒÅna within the first half of the life\\" (Sanskrit: antarƒÅparinirvƒÅyin; Pali: antarƒÅ- parinibbƒÅyƒ´). #He will attain arhatship within the latter half of his life in the Pure Abodes or at the moment of death. Such a being is called \\"one who reaches NibbƒÅna after crossing half the life-time\\" (Sanskrit: upapadyaparinirvƒÅyin; Pali: upahacca-parinibbƒÅyƒ´). #He exerts himself to the point of attaining arhatship. Such a being is called \\"one who reaches NibbƒÅna with exertion\\" (Sanskrit: sƒÅbhisa·πÉskƒÅraparinirvƒÅyin; Pali: sasankhƒÅra- parinibbƒÅyƒ´). #He does not exert himself, yet attains arhatship. Such a being is called \\"one who reaches NibbƒÅna without exertion\\" (Sanskrit: anabhisa·πÉskƒÅraparinirvƒÅyin; Pali: asankhƒÅra-parinibbƒÅyƒ´). #He traverses the five heavens of the Pure Abodes in order from lowest to highest before attaining arhatship.

Production and casting The series, which aired from 1979 to 1981, was set at the fictional Pacific International Airport and dealt with the lives of the pilots, airline staff and management team who worked there. Skyways was mainly taped in a television studio where, in many interior-set scenes, Colour Separation Overlay created the illusion of a bustling airport with taxiing planes outside the window. Many of the exterior scenes were shot on location at Melbourne Airport. The show's regular cast members included Tony Bonner as airport manager Paul MacFarlane, later replaced by Gary Doolan (Gerard Kennedy). Tina Bursill played glamorous and ruthless assistant manager Louise Carter. Bill Stalker, played head of airport security Peter Fanelli, an ex-detective. When Skyways ended Fanelli was moved to Crawford police procedural Cop Shop, while Brian James' character George Tippett was transplanted to Holiday Island. Kylie Minogue and Jason Donovan roles Years before Neighbours and international pop stardom, Kylie Minogue and Jason Donovan appeared together in one episode as siblings. Storylines An early storyline featured a lesbian flight attendant (Judy Morris) unsuccessfully attempting to seduce a colleague (Deborah Coulls) who revealed she was heterosexual. Morris' character was soon afterwards stabbed to death in the shower as part of a murder-mystery storyline. International broadcast The series screened across Europe during the mid-1980s on Sky Channel which would later become Sky One. It also aired in the UK on Astra Satellite channel Lifestyle during 1990 at 1.00 p.m Monday to Friday.

It was first described in 1880 by Wilhelm Sommer. Hippocampal sclerosis is a frequent pathologic finding in community-based dementia. Hippocampal sclerosis can be detected with autopsy or MRI. Individuals with hippocampal sclerosis have similar initial symptoms and rates of dementia progression to those with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and therefore are frequently misclassified as having Alzheimer's Disease. But clinical and pathologic findings suggest that hippocampal sclerosis has characteristics of a progressive disorder although the underlying cause remains elusive. A diagnosis of hippocampal sclerosis has a significant effect on the life of patients because of the notable mortality, morbidity and social impact related to epilepsy, as well as side effects associated with antiepileptic treatments.  Symptoms  Histopathological hallmarks of hippocampal sclerosis include segmental loss of pyramidal neurons, granule cell dispersion and reactive gliosis. This means that pyramidal neuronal cells are lost, granule cells are spread widely or driven off, and glial cells are changed in response to damage to the central nervous system (CNS). Generally, hippocampal sclerosis may be seen in some cases of epilepsy, particularly temporal lobe epilepsy. It is important to clarify the nature of insults that most likely have caused the hippocampal sclerosis and have initiated the epileptogenic process. Presence of hippocampal sclerosis and duration of epilepsy longer than 10 years were found to cause parasympathetic autonomic dysfunction, whereas seizure refractoriness was found to cause sympathetic autonomic dysfunction. Apart from its association with the chronic nature of epilepsy, hippocampal sclerosis was shown to have an important role in internal cardiac autonomic dysfunction. Patients with left hippocampal sclerosis had more severe parasympathetic dysfunction as compared with those with right hippocampal sclerosis. In young individuals, mesial temporal sclerosis is commonly recognized with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). On the other hand, it is an often unrecognized cause of cognitive decline, typically presenting with severe memory loss. = Temporal lobe epilepsy = Ammon's horn (or hippocampal) sclerosis (AHS) is the most common type of neuropathological damage seen in individuals with temporal lobe epilepsy. This type of neuron cell loss, primarily in the hippocampus, can be observed in approximately 65% of people suffering from this form of epilepsy. Sclerotic hippocampus is pointed to as the most likely origin of chronic seizures in temporal lobe epilepsy patients, rather than the amygdala or other temporal lobe regions. Although hippocampal sclerosis has been identified as a distinctive feature of the pathology associated with temporal lobe epilepsy, this disorder is not merely a consequence of prolonged seizures as argued. A long and ongoing debate addresses the issue of whether hippocampal sclerosis is the cause or the consequence of chronic and pharmaceutically resistant seizure activity. Temporal lobectomy is a common treatment for TLE, surgically removing the seizure focal area, though complications can be severe. Other variants of temporal lobe epilepsy include mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE), MTLE due to hippocampal sclerosis, thalamic changes in temporal lobe epilepsy with and without hippocampal sclerosis, and hippocampal sclerosis with and without mesial temporal lobe epilepsy.  Causes  = Aging = Although hippocampal sclerosis is relatively commonly found among elderly people (‚âà10% of individuals over the age of 85 years), association between this disease and ageing remains unknown. = Vascular risk factors = There were also observations that hippocampal sclerosis was associated with vascular risk factors. Hippocampal sclerosis cases were more likely than Alzheimer's disease to have had a history of stroke (56% vs. 25%) or hypertension (56% vs. 40%), evidence of small vessel disease (25% vs. 6%), but less likely to have had diabetes mellitus (0% vs. 22%). = Socioeconomic status = Socioeconomic correlates of health have been well established in the study of heart disease, lung cancer, and diabetes. Many of the explanations for the increased incidence of these conditions in people with lower socioeconomic status (SES) suggest they are the result of poor diet, low levels of exercise, dangerous jobs (exposure to toxins etc.) and increased levels of smoking and alcohol intake in socially deprived populations. Hesdorffer et al. found that low SES, indexed by poor education and lack of home ownership, was a risk factor for epilepsy in adults, but not in children in a population study. Low socioeconomic status may have a cumulative effect for the risk of developing epilepsy over a lifetime. Diagnosis =Classification= Mesial temporal sclerosis is a specific pattern of hippocampal neuron cell loss.Bronen RA, Fulbright RK, Spencer DD, et al. 1997 Trepeta, Scott 2007 There are 3 specific patterns of cell loss. Cell loss might involve sectors CA1 and CA4, CA4 alone, or CA1 to CA4. Associated hippocampal atrophy and gliosis is common. MRI scan commonly displays increased T2 signal and hippocampal atrophy. Mesial temporal sclerosis might occur with other temporal lobe abnormalities (dual pathology). Mesial temporal sclerosis is the most common pathological abnormality in temporal lobe epilepsy.

USS Chief is named for the former , and to honor the service and tradition of the Chief Petty Officers of the United States Navy. Chief was christened by Mrs. Susan Bushey (the wife of the seventh Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy MCPON Duane Bushey) on 12 June 1993. Construction and fitting-out was done in Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin, and the ship was accepted from Mr. Ellsworth Peterson on behalf of the United States Navy, and placed in commission by Lieutenant Commander Timothy S. Garrold, USN, her first Commanding Officer, on 8 July 1994. =Crest of USS Chief= Navy blue and gold are the traditional colors of the United States Navy. The mine in the center of the shield represents the mine countermeasures mission of the Chief while the crossed Officer's sword and Enlisted cutlass symbolize Surface Warfare excellence. The fouled Navy anchor, insignia of a Chief Petty Officer, is further symbolic of the United States Navy's leadership and commemorates the fact that Chief was launched on 12 June 1993 during the centennial of the Chief Petty Officer Corps. The three silver stars above the fouled anchor depict the leadership and service of the Master Chief Petty Officers of the Navy (MCPON) ‚Äì past, present and future and honor the ship's Sponsor. The stars are also arranged in the same manner about the anchor as the international navigational symbol for lights and shapes about the mast; signifying a vessel engaged in mine clearance operations. There are 84 links in the fouled anchor chain, one for each plank owner, the ship's sponsor, and the Matron of Honor. The trident atop the crest denotes seapower. The blue and white surface from which it rises represents both the sea, upon which the ship was born. Surrounding the trident are seven stars representing the seven Battle Stars won during the Second World War and the Korean War by the first ship to bear the name Chief, USS Chief (AM-315). The five above the trident for World War II and the two alongside for the Korean War. Between 2006 and 2007, the first command senior enlisted who were graduates of the Command Master Chief/COB class at Newport, Rhode Island, were appointed to minesweeper units. The command senior chief billet was established and provided guidance and advocacy for enlisted sailors assigned to the ship. The command senior chief served as an advisor to the commanding officer on all issues pertaining to enlisted matters. While command senior chiefs were assigned to \\"crews\\" and not the ship specifically, it is hard to determine who was the first rated command senior chief on board USS Chief. However, records show that CMDCM(AW/SW) Jim Cahill and HMCS(SW/FMF) Chad Smith from Crew Conflict were the first command-appointed senior enlisted leaders on board USS Chief (MCM-14). In January 2015, the navy announced the command senior chief rating CMDCS, whereas previously assigned senior enlisted leaders retained their rating.

When tripped, a small propelling charge launches the body of the mine 3‚Äì4 feet, or about a metre, into the air, where the main charge detonates and sprays fragmentation at roughly waist height. The original World War II German S-mine has been widely influential. Other countries that have employed bounding mines in war include the United States, the Soviet Union, Vietnam and countries of former Yugoslavia. China and Italy have also produced them. Some American mines designed for this purpose used a standard 60 mm HE mortar round with an improvised time delay fuse which is activated by the propelling charge. Bounding mines are more expensive than typical AP blast mines, and they do not lend themselves to scatterable designs. Because they are designed to be buried, they are appropriate for command-detonated ambushes, but tripwire operation is common as well. By design, bounding mines contain a large amount of steel, which makes them comparatively easy to detect with metal detectors. However, it is often the case that minimum metal mines have also been planted in the same minefield, which complicates the demining process.  Examples  * S-mine, Germany, nicknamed the Bouncing Betty by most Allied troops and nicknamed the \\"Jumping Jack\\" by Australian and New Zealand soldiers. * M16 APM, United States, based on captured S-mine plans.

It is part of the City of Wanneroo local government area. For the most part, the suburb is covered in native banksia woodland, scrubland and heath typical of the Swan Coastal Plain. The area is part of the Alkimos-Eglinton region being considered by the State Government for a future city centre and urban region. On 5 November 2008, the WA State Government announced it was actively seeking a development partner for the project. Geography Alkimos lies roughly between the proposed Mitchell Freeway to the east and the Indian Ocean to the west.

Suburban development In 2005, the Banksia Grove Joint Venture partnership was established to revive and develop the suburb. The $2 billion project will create a further 3500 home sites to complement the existing 650 developed prior to 2005. In total an estimated 12,000 residents will call Banksia Grove home by the project's completion in 2020. The new community contains a diverse range of housing types to suit residents in differing life stages and backgrounds.

Geography Butler is bordered to the west by Jindalee and Quinns Rocks (Marmion Avenue), to the south by Merriwa and Ridgewood (Lukin Drive) and to the north by Alkimos (Butler Boulevard). The Joondalup railway line reserve separates Butler from the rural locality of Nowergup in the east. 2 kilometres west of Butler is the Indian Ocean. History =Name= \\"Butler\\" was approved by the Shire of Wanneroo for the area in 1979 in honour of John Butler, the first recorded explorer of the Wanneroo and Lake Joondalup areas in 1834. The marketing of the \\"Brighton Estate\\" in Butler by Satterley, with many amenities and establishments also adopting the \\"Brighton\\" nameplate (e.g., Brighton Village Newsagency), has led to Brighton's becoming synonymous with Butler and causing confusion amongst residents and sight-seers alike. Residents submitted a petition to the City of Wanneroo in 2003 for the suburb's name to be permanently changed to Brighton. The request was rejected on account of duplication with many other places across Australia named Brighton, as well as the name's lacking both historical and cultural significance within the area. =Suburban development= Although Butler was gazetted in 1979, it remained unpopulated bushland until the early 2000s, with no landmarks or conventional roads providing direct access to the area. The Butler-Ridgewood Agreed Local Structure Plan was approved by the City of Wanneroo in 2002, allowing early subdivision and development of the site to commence in 2003 by Satterley, the principal investor in the suburb. Satterley's Brighton Estate plan takes up all of Butler and also extends into the neighbouring suburbs of Ridgewood, Jindalee and Alkimos. Butler contains four sub-divisional estates within the Brighton area; \\"The Dunes\\", \\"The Green\\", \\"Seahaven\\" and \\"Junctions North\\". Over $120 million was spent on landscaping, civil construction and community infrastructure to create the Seahaven and The Green estates, the Brighton Village Shopping Centre on Marmion Avenue and the Central Park Precinct. Demographics At the 2006 census, Butler had a population of 5,056. This represents a huge increase, as Butler's population was negligible during the 2001 census just five years earlier.

Along this stretch is also a pub, The Cornerstone Tavern, opened in 2010, which provides nightlife and entertainment functions for the whole area from Butler to Jindalee. Most of Butler's amenities are located at the western edge of the area, adjacent to Marmion Avenue, while eastern Butler remains strictly residential in character. Butler contains several parks in various places throughout the area, including a strip of parkland running all the way down Kingsbridge Boulevard. The Butler Community Centre is located in south Butler. Education Butler contains three state K-6 primary schools, Butler Primary School, East Butler Primary School and John Butler Primary College. Senior Butler students who are special needs from Year 7 onwards attend Butler College. Butler students also have the option of Christian education. Brighton Catholic Primary School serves students from K-7, while the large Irene McCormack Catholic College accommodates Years 7-12. Both schools are privately funded. Transport Marmion Avenue is the only arterial road connecting Butler to the rest of metropolitan Perth, as well as the far outer suburb of Yanchep in the north.

The bombing occurred in the first days of the German-led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia during World War II. The Royal Yugoslav Army Air Force (VVKJ) had only 77 modern fighter aircraft available to defend Belgrade against the hundreds of German fighters and bombers that struck in the first wave early on 6 April. Three days prior, VVKJ Major Vladimir Kren had defected to the Germans, disclosing the locations of multiple military assets and divulging the VVKJ's codes. Three more waves of bombers attacked Belgrade on 6 April, and more attacks followed in subsequent days. The attacks resulted in the paralysis of Yugoslav civilian and military command and control, the widespread destruction of Belgrade's infrastructure, and many civilian casualties. The ground invasion had begun a few hours earlier, and air attacks were also made on VVKJ airfields and other strategic targets across Yugoslavia. Among the non-military targets struck during the bombing were the National Library of Serbia, which burned to the ground with the loss of hundreds of thousands of books and manuscripts, and the Belgrade Zoo. In retaliation for the invasion of Yugoslavia, which surrendered on 17 April, the Royal Air Force carried out two bombing raids on Sofia, the capital of Axis Bulgaria, which later took part in Yugoslavia's partition. The senior Luftwaffe officer responsible for the bombing, Generaloberst Alexander L√∂hr, was captured by the Yugoslavs at the end of the war and was tried and executed for war crimes, in part for his involvement in the bombing of Belgrade. Kren was arrested in 1947 on unrelated charges of war crimes stemming from his subsequent service as the head of the Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia. He was extradited to Yugoslavia to face trial, convicted on all counts, and executed in 1948. A monument erected in New Belgrade in 1997 commemorates the Yugoslav airmen who were killed in Belgrade's defence. The bombing has been dramatised in literature and film.  Background  = Yugoslav coup d'√©tat = Following Germany's 1938 Anschluss of Austria, Yugoslavia shared a border with the Third Reich and came under increasing pro- Axis political pressure as its neighbours fell into line with the Axis powers. In April 1939, Yugoslavia gained a second frontier with Italy when Italy invaded Albania. Between September and November 1940, Hungary joined the Tripartite Pact, Italy invaded Greece, and Romania also joined the Pact. From that time, Yugoslavia was almost surrounded by Axis powers or their client states, and its neutral stance toward the war was under tremendous pressure. On 14 February 1941, Adolf Hitler invited Prime Minister Dragi≈°a Cvetkoviƒá and Foreign Minister Aleksandar Cincar-Markoviƒá to Berchtesgaden, and requested that Yugoslavia also join the Pact. On 1 March, Bulgaria joined, and the next day, German troops entered Bulgaria from Romania, closing the ring around Yugoslavia. Further pressure was applied by Hitler on 4 March 1941, when the Yugoslav regent, Prince Paul, visited Berchtesgaden, but the prince delayed a decision. On 6 March, the Royal Yugoslav Army Air Force (, VVKJ) was secretly mobilised. The following day, British troops began landing in Greece to bolster the country's defences against the Italians. On 12 March, the VVKJ began dispersing to auxiliary airfields. By 20 March, the VVKJ's dispersal had been completed. Hitler, wishing to secure his southern flank in anticipation of Germany's impending invasion of the Soviet Union, demanded that Yugoslavia sign the Pact. On 25 March, the Yugoslav government complied. Two days later, a group of VVKJ and Yugoslav Royal Guard officers, led by Brigadier General Borivoje Mirkoviƒá, deposed Prince Paul in the Yugoslav coup d'√©tat. He was replaced by his 17-year-old nephew Peter. = Preparations = The day of the coup, Hitler issued Directive 25, which stated that the coup had changed the political situation in the Balkans. He ordered that \\"even if Yugoslavia at first should give declarations of loyalty, she must be considered as a foe and therefore must be destroyed as quickly as possible\\". German reconnaissance aircraft frequently violated Yugoslav airspace in the aftermath of the coup. VVKJ fighters were placed on constant alert. The German incursions demonstrated that the Yugoslav ground observation post network and supporting radio communications were inadequate. Hitler decided that Belgrade would be bombed as punishment for the coup, under the codename Operation Retribution (Unternehmen Strafgericht). On 27 and 28 March 1941, Reichsmarschall Hermann G√∂ring transferred about 500 fighter and bomber aircraft from France and northern Germany to airfields near the Yugoslav border. The commander of Luftflotte IV, Generaloberst (General) Alexander L√∂hr, allocated these aircraft to attack the Yugoslav capital in waves by day and night. L√∂hr issued his orders for the bombing on 31 March, but the decision to bomb Belgrade would not be confirmed by Hitler until 5 April. Hitler ordered the general destruction of Belgrade, but at the last minute L√∂hr replaced these general directions with specific military objectives within the city. On 3 April, Major Vladimir Kren flew a Potez 25 aircraft to Graz and defected to the Germans. He disclosed the locations of many of Yugoslavia's dispersal airfields, as well as codes used by the VVKJ, which had to be quickly changed. Also disclosed were the location of Yugoslavia's troop mobilisation centres and air-raid shelters in Belgrade. On the afternoon of 5 April, a British colonel visited Mirkoviƒá at the VVKJ base in Zemun and informed him that the attack on Belgrade would commence at 06:30 the next day. The previous day, the Yugoslav government had declared Belgrade an open city in the event of hostilities. The German embassy had informed its government that Belgrade did not contain any anti-aircraft defences, but in an effort to justify the attack to the public, German propaganda branded the city \\"Fortress Belgrade\\" after the first bombs were dropped. By 6 April, the VVKJ had been almost completely mobilised, and consisted of four air brigades with more than 423 aircraft of Yugoslav, German, Italian, French, Czech and British design, including 107 modern fighters and 100 modern medium bombers. Other than a small number of locally made Rogo≈æarski IK-3 fighters, almost all the modern aircraft available to the VVKJ were of German, Italian or British design for which limited spares and munitions were available. The available aircraft were spread all over the country, and only the 1st Fighter Brigade was near enough to Belgrade to respond to an attack on the capital. In total, the 1st Fighter Brigade fielded 56 Messerschmitt Bf 109E-3a fighters, 15 Hawker Hurricane MkIs, and six Rogo≈æarski IK-3s.  Bombing  Old Palace in central Belgrade, struck during the first wave of bombing on 6 April 1941alt=Trucks travelling along wide tree-lined street with large old building in the background German ground forces crossed the Yugoslav border at 05:15 on 6 April, and the Reich Minister of Propaganda, Joseph Goebbels, announced Germany's declaration of war at 06:00. The invasion and concurrent bombing coincided with Easter Sunday as observed by the Serbian Orthodox Church, which uses the Julian calendar. Yugoslav anti-aircraft defences caused a false alarm when they reported the approach of an air raid from the direction of Romania at 03:00, but listening posts on the Romanian border had heard the aircraft engines of the Romanian-based Fliegerf√ºhrer Arad warming up well before they took off. The VVKJ's 51st Fighter Group at Zemun had been alerted before dawn, and when reports began to be received about Luftwaffe attacks on VVKJ airfields, the first patrol was sent into the air. At first, no aircraft could be seen approaching Belgrade. The first wave closed on Belgrade between 06:30 and 06:45, and consisted of 74 Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive bombers, and 160 Heinkel He 111 medium bombers and Dornier Do 17 light bombers at . They were escorted by Messerschmitt Bf 110 heavy fighters at and 100 Messerschmitt Bf 109E fighters at .

The Yugoslavs were quickly engaged by escorting Messerschmitt Bf 109Es from Jagdgeschwader 77 (JG 77). Just as the first wave was departing, Hawker Hurricane Mk1s of the 52nd Fighter Group of the 2nd Fighter Regiment based at Kniƒá arrived over Belgrade and engaged some dive bombers, claiming one Stuka shot down. During the first attack, the Yugoslavs claimed fifteen German aircraft shot down and lost five of their own, with six more badly damaged. The pilots of JG 77 claimed ten Yugoslav machines shot down and another six destroyed on the ground. On his return to base, the commander of the 51st Fighter Group was relieved of his command for failure to take action. The first wave hit the Belgrade power station, the post office including telegraph and postal services, the headquarters of the Ministry of Army and Navy, the Yugoslav Supreme Command building, the military academy, the royal palace at Dedinje, the royal guard barracks at Topƒçider, the gendarmerie command headquarters, and the airport at Zemun, among other targets. Immediately after the first wave, King Peter, the Government of Yugoslavia and the Yugoslav Supreme Command left Belgrade and retreated to Yugoslavia's mountainous interior with the intention of going into exile. The second wave of German aircraft arrived over Belgrade about 10:00, consisting of 57 Ju 87 dive bombers and 30 Bf 109E fighters. They were met by 15 of the remaining fighters from the 6th Fighter Brigade. This time the Yugoslavs claimed two dive bombers forced down, and one Bf 109E shot down. A patrol of Bf 109Es from the Yugoslav 31st Fighter Group based at Kragujevac, acting without orders from their group commander, followed the Germans as they returned to their bases and claimed two dive bombers shot down for the loss of both Yugoslav aircraft. alt=an overgrown crater with ruined walls around part of the perimeter Belgrade was targeted on two other occasions on the first day of the invasion. The third wave struck at 14:00, consisting of 94 twin-engined bombers flying from airfields near Vienna, escorted by 60 fighters. This wave was met by eighteen fighters of the 6th Fighter Regiment, which claimed four German aircraft. The fourth attack of the day approached Belgrade at 16:00, comprising 97 dive bombers and 60 fighters. The Germans claimed nineteen Yugoslav Bf 109E fighters and four unidentified aircraft destroyed on 6 April. Actual Yugoslav aircraft losses on the first day were ten shot down and fifteen damaged. The Yugoslavs claimed to have shot down twenty-two German aircraft and forced two others to land. The Germans lost twelve aircraft, significantly fewer than claimed by the Yugoslavs: two Do 17Z light bombers, five Bf 110 heavy fighters, four Ju 87 dive bombers, and one Bf 109E fighter. One Luftwaffe pilot who claimed his first victory over Belgrade on 6 April was Oberleutnant Gerhard Koall of Jagdgeschwader 54. He went on to be credited with 37 victories and was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross in 1944. German bombers and dive-bombers dropped of bombs and incendiaries on the capital. The weak VVKJ and inadequate anti-aircraft defences of Belgrade briefly attempted to meet the overwhelming Luftwaffe assault, but were eliminated as threats during the first wave of the attack. Sources vary regarding the success achieved by the defenders. A US Army study first published in 1953 states that the Luftwaffe lost two fighter aircraft, downed 20 Yugoslav aircraft and destroyed a further 44 on the ground. The military historian Daniel L. Zajac writes that the Germans lost 40 aircraft during the two-day air battle. Another source indicates the loss of 14 German aircraft on 6 April. Dive-bombers in subsequent waves were able to operate at rooftop altitude. According to the historian Stevan K. Pavlowitch, the bombing of Belgrade lasted three days. Other sources state the air battle over Belgrade lasted only two days owing to poor flying conditions on 8 April. The most important cultural institution that was destroyed was the National Library of Serbia, which was hit by bombs and gutted by fire. Hundreds of thousands of rare books, maps, and medieval manuscripts were destroyed. Also struck was the Belgrade Zoo, sending frightened animals running through the streets.  British retaliation  No. 37 Squadron of the Royal Air Force (RAF) conducted two bombing raids on Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria, in retaliation for the bombing of Belgrade. Operating Vickers Wellington bombers from an airfield in Greece, the squadron conducted raids on 6/7 April and 12/13 April, dropping a total of of high-explosive bombs on railway targets and nearby residential areas. These raids were carried out despite the fact that Britain was not at war with Bulgaria until 12 December 1941. The historian Herman Knell calls the retaliatory justification for these raids \\"strange and implausible\\". The aviation historians Shores, Cull and Malizia indicate that these raids were attacks on the lines of communication of German forces attacking Greece and Yugoslavia, and note that the raid on 6/7 April targeted an ammunition train and other installations in Sofia, and the raid on 12/13 April bombed the railway marshalling yards. Other similar targets in Bulgaria were attacked by the RAF during the Balkans Campaign.  Aftermath and legacy  alt=rectangular polished dark stone plinth pointing toward the sky, with a winged plaque and inscription at the base The bombing of Belgrade paralysed communications between the Yugoslav military and its headquarters, and contributed decisively to the rapid collapse of Yugoslav resistance. Civilian casualties were significant, but sources vary widely from 1,500 to 17,000 killed. They were worsened by the disclosure of air-raid shelter locations to the Germans in the days preceding the attack. The official casualty figure released by the occupation authorities soon after the bombing was 2,271 killed. Other sources mention 5,000 to 10,000 fatalities, and later Yugoslav estimates ranged even higher. The historian Jozo Tomasevich writes that the higher estimates were downgraded following \\"careful postwar investigations\\", and indicates that a figure between 3,000 and 4,000 is more realistic. Belgrade was occupied on 13 April 1941, and four days later, Yugoslavia capitulated. Afterwards, Luftwaffe engineers conducted a bomb damage assessment in Belgrade. The report stated that of bombs were dropped, 10 to 14 percent being incendiaries. It listed all the targets of the bombing, mentioned that seven aerial mines were dropped, and that areas in the centre and north-west of the city had been destroyed, comprising 20 to 25 percent of its total area. Some aspects of the bombing remain unexplained, particularly the use of the aerial mines. Significant damage was done to Belgrade, particularly to the water and electrical systems. Pavlowitch states that almost 50 percent of housing in Belgrade was destroyed. After the invasion, the Germans forced between 3,500 and 4,000 Jews to collect rubble that was caused by the bombing. Unexploded German bombs continue to be unearthed in the 21st century. L√∂hr was captured by the Yugoslav Partisans on 9 May 1945, escaped, and was recaptured on 13 May. He was intensively interrogated, after which he was tried before a Yugoslav military court on war crimes charges, one of which related to his command of Luftflotte IV during Operation Retribution. L√∂hr was convicted by the Yugoslav military court and sentenced to death. He was executed on 26 February 1947. Following the invasion, Kren was appointed head of the Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia (, ZNDH). He was arrested in Italy in March 1947 and extradited to Yugoslavia, where he was tried on unrelated charges of war crimes for his role in the targeting of civilians by the ZNDH. He was found guilty on all counts and executed in 1948. The bombing of Belgrade was depicted in the 1980 Yugoslav feature film Who's Singin' Over There? () and the 1995 feature film Underground (). It is also the subject of Miodrag Pavloviƒá's poem Belgrade 1941 (). The Serbian American poet Charles Simic, a survivor of the bombing, wrote a poem titled \\"Cameo Appearance\\" recounting his experiences. A monument commemorating the Yugoslav pilots killed during Operation Retribution was inaugurated in New Belgrade on 6 April 1997. It was designed by the sculptor Miodrag ≈Ωivkoviƒá. On 6 April 2016, the 75th anniversary of the bombing, a memorial service was held for the victims, attended by the Serbian Minister for Labour, Employment, Veteran and Social Policy, Aleksandar Vulin. In June 2017, it was announced that the site containing the ruined foundations of the National Library of Serbia would be made into a memorial garden.

Its local government area is the City of Wanneroo. The region gives its name to a distinctive form of building limestone called Carabooda limestone. An abandoned theme park is located on Karoborup Road - it was known as Dizzy Lamb Park, and specialised in vintage cars and military vehicles until its closure in 2000. History The suburb of Carabooda (spelled Karoborup or Karroborup in earlier documents) takes its name from the lake nearby. The lake name was first recorded by J.W. Gregory in January 1843, and is a Noongar word. The current spelling was in use by 1867, and it was approved as a suburb name in 1982. The name \\"Karoborup\\" survives in a regional road through the suburb. Geography Carabooda is bounded by Romeo Road/Karoborup Road to the south, the proposed Mitchell Freeway to the west, Cutler Road and Old Yanchep Road to the east and Walding Road (near the Yanchep turnoff) to the north. At the Australian Bureau of Statistics 2011 census, Carabooda had a population of 737 people living in 316 dwellings, an increase of 227 from the 2006 census. Carabooda is a sparsely populated agricultural suburb, and several plant nurseries and wineries and a wildlife park are located in the area. Transport Carabooda was served by the Transperth 490 bus route between Clarkson train station and Two Rocks along Wanneroo Road. However, the service was relocated to Marmion Avenue and the nearby suburb of Yanchep on 14 December 2008, and Carabooda is no longer served. Politics Carabooda's political leanings are unclear due to its small size and the lack of a polling booth. The nearest large booths tend to favour the Australian Labor Party historically, although most have been won by the Coalition in recent times, especially at federal level.

Its postcode is 6031, and it came into being, together with Tapping to the south, in 1995 as a subdivision of Neerabup. Carramar is an Aboriginal word meaning \\"shade of trees\\", and was approved as a suburb name in 1997. Geography Carramar is bounded by Flynn Drive to the north, Pinjar Road to the east, Joondalup Drive to the south, and Wanneroo Road to the west. Demographics In the , Carramar had a population of 6,605, an increase in comparison to the 2001 census, which had the population at 2,497. This increase can be directly attributed to increased housing development within the suburb on previously undeveloped land. The median age of Carramar residents was 32, and median household income was $1,964 per week. 0.4% of the population identified themselves as Indigenous persons. The most popular religious affiliations in descending order in the 2011 census were Anglican 25.7%, No Religion 24.3%, Catholic 22.6%, Uniting Church 3.7% and Baptist 2.8%. Facilities The suburb has a park and sporting oval located on its Southern border at Millendon Street between Houghton and Cheriton Drives. Also located in this same area is the local Community Centre constructed and operated by the local council opened in May 2006. In 1994, the Carramar Golf Course was opened by the City of Wanneroo. The Bob Stanton designed facility is a par 72, 6121 metre course carved into a native Australian bushland surrounding. = Retail facilities = Two sites within the suburb are zoned for retail facilities. The first is the Carramar Village Shopping Centre located in the area bounded by Joondalup Drive, Rawlinna Parkway, and Cheriton Drive on the suburb's southern boundary. The site is owned by the estate's land developer Peet Limited and opened for trading in March 2009. The second site is zoned regional shopping centre and is located on a parcel of land to the north of the intersection at Joondalup Drive and Pinjar Road. The issue of shopping facilities within the Carramar Estate had been a source of constant discontent between residents, the local residents association, and the land developer. Amongst the delays cited were the tendering process for a land release in the adjoining suburb of Banksia Grove which would have led them to instead develop the regional shopping centre site, and complaints regarding the approvals process of the City of Wanneroo which have been strenuously denied by Central Ward Councillors Sam Salpietro (Also Deputy Mayor) and Frank Civitan. Education A new primary school, Carramar Primary School, opened on 2 February 2005. High School studies are provided through either Wanneroo Senior High School or Kinross College.

While mostly a residential area, it also functions as a town centre, serving many surrounding areas with a vast amount of amenities and facilities. The suburb has a railway station on the Joondalup railway line and also is a major public transport hub for surrounding suburbs. Geography Clarkson is bounded to the west by Mindarie (Marmion Avenue) and to the north by Merriwa and Ridgewood (Hester Avenue). The Joondalup railway line divides Clarkson from the Neerabup National Park in the east. South of Clarkson is Tamala Park, which is uninhabited. It is approximately 2 kilometres away from the Indian Ocean and the coastlines of Claytons Beach and Quinns Beach. History =Name= The suburb's name refers to the Clarksons, a family of sheep farmers who had held leases of land in the area since the 19th century. Clarkson was originally gazetted as \\"Mindarie\\" by the Shire of Wanneroo in 1979, but the two names were transposed in 1985 at the request of Smith Corporation, who went on to develop the Mindarie Keys Marina three years later.\\"A History of Quinns Rocks\\" by Barbara Arthur & Betty Hunt-Smith =Early use= The first permanent settler with European ancestry in the area was the Barnard Drummond Clarkson, a sheep-farmer who also held land in Toodyay. Clarkson first acquired a pastoral lease in 1888 of 13,000 acres in the areas comprising modern-day Mindarie, Clarkson, Quinns Rocks and Merriwa. The leases were known as the Mindarie Pastoral Company, and the lands were primarily used for sheep-herding by subsequent generations of the Clarkson family. The ruins of the Clarksons' first homestead and home of the Mindarie Pastoral Company are today preserved in Riverlinks Park on Connolly Drive. =Suburban development= The Mindarie Pastoral Company leases were sold by John Clarkson in 1952. The land subsequently saw no development or settlement until the early 1990s, naturally following the completion of the adjacent Mindarie Marina and subsequent residential dwellings in the area. The north- eastern portion of Clarkson around the high school was developed later in 1995. The suburb continued to be built throughout the 2000s, with a steadily growing population. Outside of Clarkson's main commercial zone in the south- west, the suburb consists mostly of residential, detached bungalow housing with vast amounts of parkland. There is a strip of two-storey apartment blocks along Ocean Keys Boulevard, immediately opposite the railway station, and another strip of apartments closer to the shopping centre on Ningaloo Bend. The suburb also contains a lot of Keystart homes. Clarkson railway station. =Somerly= Somerly is a commercial and housing development in south-east Clarkson, principally surrounding the railway station, that was completed in 2008. The 1,800 lot community was built on a 162 hectare area in a partnership between development company Urban Pacific and the Western Australia Government Department of Housing and Works land development agency Landstart. The project aimed to provide a community-within-a-community with commercial enterprise, fibre-optic to the home internet, and a landscaping package (totaling at $8000AUD) at no extra cost to new home-buyers. The development of the Somerly area made Clarkson one of the largest, most densely populated suburbs in Perth's northern corridor, with a population now approaching 12,000. It is roughly delineated from the older, established parts of Clarkson by Liberty Drive to the north, Connolly Drive to the west and Polglase Fairway to the south-west. =Catalina= A new residential estate under the preliminary name of \\"Catalina\\" is being planned for development in 2012. The estate's proposed boundaries lay south of Neerabup Road (which is presently bushland blending into Tamala Park) and extend from the Joondalup rail line in the east, to the coast of Mindarie Beach and Claytons Beach to the west. Although the land is part of Clarkson and Mindarie at present, Satterley, the developers, intend for the estate to eventually be re-gazetted as its own suburb. Demographics Clarkson had a population of 7,082 at the 2006 census, an increase of 1,214 persons since the 2001 census. The population of Clarkson is predicted to continue to grow at an exponential rate, peaking at 18,645 in 2026.City of Wanneroo Population and Household Forecasts - Clarkson , .id Only 58.9% of Clarkson's population were born in Australia compared to a nationwide average of 70.9%. The suburb has a significant British-born population, comprising 15.4%, although this figure is minor compared to British populations in neighbouring suburbs, such as Mindarie. Most other major immigrant groups in Clarkson hail from Anglophone countries, such as New Zealand and South Africa. Clarkson has a very young population, with an average age of 28, a figure drastically lower than all surrounding suburbs, as well as the national average age of 37. Income levels in Clarkson are generally in line with the Australian national average, with an average household income of $1,049 per week, compared to $1,027 per week nationally. Christianity is the predominant religious affiliation declared by Clarkson's residents, at 44% of the population, across various denominations. Several churches are scattered throughout the suburb; Clarkson Seventh-day Adventist Community Church, St. Andrew's Catholic Church and Ocean Keys Community Church (Lutheran). 28% of the suburb declared no religion. 2.8% of Clarkson's population is composed of Indigenous Australians, compared to 2.3% nationwide. Only neighbouring Merriwa reflects this trend; the Aboriginal population is much less significant in the suburbs surrounding Clarkson. Amenities and facilities Ocean Keys Shopping Centre, Clarkson Compared to surrounding suburbs, Clarkson is a very mixed-use area with an abundance of facilities and a very large shopping and retail district, establishing it as a commercial town centre for the northern suburbs beyond the nearby city of Joondalup. The main road, Ocean Keys Boulevard, is home to the Ocean Keys Shopping Centre, a major shopping mall with a large number of major retail outlets, including Target, Kmart, Coles, Woolworths, JB Hi-Fi, City Beach and 115 specialty retailers. Many more commercial outlets surround the centre, including a large Bunnings Warehouse, a post office, two service stations and Toyota, Ford, Holden and Nissan car dealerships. A strip of restaurants and take-away outlets are situated directly west of the Shopping Centre, including branches of Oporto, KFC, Hungry Jack's, Wokinabox, Subway, Eagle Boys, Sushi Noodle World and Masala Indian Restaurant. There are also other restaurants located within the suburb, such as Nando's and a kebab shop that are both located on the external perimeter of the shopping centre (north-east corner), new Indian restaurants opening near the train station, and a fish and chip shop located at the Clarkson Mini-Mart. The Whale+Ale pub and restaurant is located on the north side of Ocean Keys Boulevard, opposite the shopping centre. It is the only pub and main hub for nightlife in the suburb. There are 3 medical centres in the suburb, which are the Clarkson Family Practice, Ocean Keys Family Practice and The Somerly Central Medical Centre. Clarkson also has a smaller shopping market built in the first area of Clarkson developed. It is located opposite the Clarkson Primary School on the corner of Renshaw Boulevard and Ainsbury Parade. It features the mini-mart store, dentist, bottle shop, fish supply (plus fish and chips) and other small businesses. There is an abundance of entertainment and leisure facilities around Clarkson. Over ten parks are located throughout the suburb, the two main ones being Anthony Waring Park and Richard Aldersea Park in the centre of the suburb. Anthony Waring Park is the largest by area and features sporting facilities. Many smaller parks around Somerly include playgrounds and free barbecue areas for families. The Clarkson Youth Centre, near Ocean Keys Shopping Centre, functions as a community centre and is also part of a wider youth precinct, incorporating a skate park and BMX tracks. Nearby is also the Clarkson Library, one of four public libraries in the Wanneroo area. Clarkson also accommodates the Clarkson Police Station, which serves all surrounding suburbs from Tamala Park to Butler and Jindalee.North West Metropolitan District, Western Australia Police A Western Power electricity substation is located off Hester Avenue in the north-east of the suburb, near the Joondalup railway line. Telephone services are provided by the Mindarie & Quinns Rocks telephone exchanges.ADSL2+ for MINDARIE (WA) Exchange Education Two state K-7 primary schools are established in Clarkson, serving different parts of the suburb. Clarkson Primary School is the oldest established school and caters to western Clarkson, while Somerly Primary School serves the Somerly estate in the east. Students also have the option of St. Andrew's Catholic Primary School, a private Catholic school located next to St. Andrew's Catholic Church. Clarkson Library Clarkson also accommodates Clarkson Community High School, a large Year 8-12 state high school established in 1996. As it is the only state high school in the vicinity (other than the 11-12 Mindarie Senior College), it covers a large catchment area, extending up to Butler and Jindalee in the north. In 2010, Trades North, a TAFE campus specializing in skilled trades and apprenticeships, was built next to the high school and opened for the 2011 school year. It is part of the North Metropolitan TAFE. Transport Marmion Avenue is the main arterial road that links Clarkson to Joondalup and the rest of suburban Perth. Connolly Drive also runs parallel to Marmion Avenue through the middle of Clarkson, approximately a kilometre to the east, and into Kinross and Currambine. Wanneroo Road is nearby and can be accessed via Hester Avenue, Clarkson's northern boundary road. There are no other roads into Clarkson and surrounding suburbs, due to the location of Tamala Park to the south, which creates a 2 km bushland buffer between Clarkson and Joondalup. Work has been completed to extend the Mitchell Freeway to Clarkson from its current terminus at Burns Beach Road in Currambine, with exits to the suburb at Neerabup Road and Hester Avenue.Draft Urban Expansion Plan, Department of Planning =Public transport= The Clarkson railway station on the Joondalup line was built in 2004 in south-east Clarkson and was the terminus of the line until 2014, when Butler railway station opened.

Along with its neighbouring suburbs, Clarkson is part of the Mindarie electoral district. At the federal level it was formerly part of the Pearce federal division, but was transferred to Moore, along with Mindarie and Neerabup, as of 2010. Clarkson has traditionally been an Australian Labor Party stronghold since the early 2000s (decade) in State elections, in line with many northern Perth suburbs. At federal level, the voting is much less clear-cut, with both major parties gaining consecutive election victories in the suburb since 2001.

Wang held a variety of high-level posts in the Party: during the Civil War he was the director of the Red Army's General Office, upon the founding of the People's Republic of China he was the first ambassador to the Soviet Union (and the first ever ambassador of the PRC), and then became the first head of the Party's International Department. Political Biography Jing County, Anhui Wang, a native of Jing County, Anhui, was born into a landlord family and attended an English missionary school in Wuhu. In September 1925 he began attending the affiliated middle school of Shanghai University. One month later he joined the Youth League, and was soon en route to the Soviet Union, studying at the Moscow Sun Yat-sen University. This institution was established under Sun Yat-Sen's policy of alliance with the Soviet Union and the CPC, and named after him to train revolutionaries who would return to China. = Joining the '28 Bolsheviks' = In Moscow, Wang joined the cohort consisting of Wang Ming, Zhang Wentian, Bo Gu and other students, called the \\"28 Bolsheviks\\" (a coalition whose precise membership is in dispute), jointly expressing a wish to engage in revolution in China. In 1928, while still in Moscow, Wang joined the Communist Party of China. With the support from their mentor Pavel Mif, the president of Moscow Sun Yat-sen University and then representative of Comintern to China, the 28 Bolsheviks were sent back to China to take leadership of the CPC. The return of the \\"28 Bolsheviks\\" began with Wang Ming and Chen Yuandao in early 1929, with Wang Jiaxiang returning in 1930. On June 11, 1930, however, Wang was sent to Hong Kong after an abortive attempt to take control of the Party. The Bolsheviks eventually did successfully take power over the Party after a power struggle with Li Lisan in 1930, however. Compared with his counterparts, Wang received the relatively less important ask of secretary for the party newspaper and chief editor of two Party journals. = The downfall of the 'Bolsheviks' = Wang Jiaxiang was one of the early defectors from the 'Bolsheviks', coming over to Mao's camp during the Zunyi conference in 1935 with other members Zhang Wentian and Yang Shangkun. Bo Gu was dismissed as general secretary and replaced by Zhang (though he remained a member of the Politburo), and Wang Jiaxiang rose to control the Red Army along with Mao and Zhou Enlai. = At Yan'an = After Wang reached Yan'an, he was sent to Moscow as CPC delegate to Comintern in 1937. Wang came back the next year with an important tribute to Mao: an alleged oral message from Georgi Dimitrov, one of the leaders of Comintern at that time, that approved the CCP's united front work and endorsed Mao's leading position in the Party. Although the authenticity of this message is still in question, Mao did exploit it as pivotal proof for the legitimacy of his being supreme leader. As a reward, Wang was appointed as Vice Chairman of Central Military Committee of CPC, replacing Mao's rival Wang Ming. During that time the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out, Chinese Red Army was reorganized into 8th Route Army, and Wang Jiaxiang was appointed as Director of Political Department, taking charge of military command with Zhu De and Peng Dehuai. At the same time, he was elected as Commissioner and member of the CPC Politburo, bringing him to his greatest prominence in the Party so far.  Promoting Mao  In 1943 Wang was the first to promote the concept of Maoism, co-heading (with Mao) the Central Study Group in Yan'an which oversaw the mobilization meetings which forced all Politburo members to speak. This marked the launch of the Yan'an rectification movement, whose goal was \\"to destroy subjectivism and sectarianism and thereby save the party's cadres.\\" Wang proposed that Mao Zedong had always upheld \\"dialectical materialism\\", and that Liu Shaoqi had also, cementing the alliance between Mao and Liu. Wang also criticized those who were too embedded in theory and lacked \\"practical work experience.\\" Mao in turn reciprocrated Wang's attentions. Thomas Kampen calls a speech by Mao at the Seventh Party Congress of 1945 \\"very interesting,\\" given that he advocated Wang's entry to the Central Committee and spoke of Wang (and Ren Bishi's) contributions to the cause after their arrival in the Soviet area. (Mao again in October 1966 praised Wang Jixiang \\"for he approved of the battle at Donggu.\\" Kampen writes: \\"It demonstrates that Mao was grateful for Wang's support and remembered the event for decades.\\" Zhang Wentian was demoted and his title taken away by Mao although he was a puppet. But when Wang lost his using value to Mao, his being purged was inevitable. During the Yan'an Rectification Movement, Wang was labeled as representative of dogmatism along with Wang Ming and Zhang, and had to make a public confession and apologies. This was not the end of his humiliation. In the 7th National Congress of CCP held in 1945, Wang was even driven out of the Central Committee of CCP, which he had held the position for last decade. Perhaps Mao felt it was too harsh as he appealed to all delegates and it was under his insistence that Wang was elected as an alternate member of Central Committee as a comfort. = Northeast Assignment = During the Chinese Civil War, Wang was sent to northeast China to work with Lin Biao and Gao Gang, but only as their subordinate with the titles of Minister of City Organization Department and acting Minister of Propaganda Department of Northeast Bureau of CPC. = After Liberation = After the establishment of People's Republic of China in 1949, Wang was appointed as first Chinese Ambassador to Soviet Union, and then Under Secretary of Foreign Ministry. In 1951 Wang was appointed as Minister of External Communication Department of CPC. Although Wang received another promotion in being elected as Commissioner and Secretariat of Central Committee of CPC in the 1st Plenary Meeting of 8th National Congress of CPC in 1956 and survived longer in political life than his close friend Zhang Wentian, who was purged in the Lushan Meeting in 1959, he still could not survive the Cultural Revolution. Wang's wife Zhu Zhongli used to be a nurse working for the army and once was assistant of Canadian doctor Bethune who worked for 8th Route Army as an international volunteer. They lived together for several decades after marriage. Now Zhu is an active writer writing memoirs on Jiang Qing and Mao Zedong.

For the most part, the suburb is covered in native banksia woodland, scrubland and heath typical of the Swan Coastal Plain. However, in recent years, there has been growth in residential estates, with a town centre to be built in the near future. There are also plans for the Joondalup train line to be extended through the suburb (terminating in Yanchep) with Eglinton Station to be located inside Allara estate. Part of the City of Wanneroo local government area, it is bounded to the north by Yanchep, to the east by Carabooda and to the south by Alkimos. The area is part of the Alkimos- Eglinton region being considered by the State Government for a future urban region. Eglinton is now being developed with the Amberton estate from Stockland and Allara Estate from Satterly, which is one of only two estates in Western Australia to achieve a six star energy rating. History Eglinton was approved in 1974 as a suburb name and is named after the barque Eglinton, which was wrecked on rocks near Alkimos that now bear its name. Prior to European settlement, the Noongar people of the Mooro tribe had lived in what has become the northern Perth metropolitan region for more than 40,000 years, taking advantage of the abundant food and water around the chain of wetlands on the Swan Coastal Plain. According to local legend, Pipidinny Swamp, located in eastern Eglinton, was created from the blood and meat of the crocodile's tail as he walked back towards the Swan River after his fight with the shark. In 1865, European settlers established the Aboriginal tracks along the west side of the lakes as a stock route from Dongara to Fremantle. The portion of the stock route between Joondalup and Yanchep was made part of the Bicentennial Heritage Trails Network in 1988, and is now known as the Yaberoo Budjara Heritage Trail. The area is mostly scrub and bushland today but also has some low-level agriculture based along Wanneroo and Pipidinny Roads as well as housing estates abutting Marmion Avenue. Pipidinny Road looking towards coast. Plans There are plans for an Alkimos-Eglinton Satellite City, covered by Amendment 1029/33 to the Metropolitan Region Scheme (May 2006). LandCorp estimates that 55,000 people will live in the area once it is complete, that the centre will include \\"hospitals, tertiary educational institutions, major retail, commercial and recreational facilities\\" and that stage 1 blocks would be offered for sale in 2008. The Environmental Protection Authority, however, raised concerns in November 2005 about the amendment, saying that it \\"would, in part, be inconsistent with the conservation and protection of significant environmental and geoheritage values in the area\\", and recommended that the amount of reserves be greatly increased. The next major waste water treatment plant for the metropolitan region has been earmarked to be built in the Eglinton area. It is designed to provide catchment from Two Rocks south to the existing Beenyup treatment plant catchment boundary. Shorehaven is being developed in Alkimos and will abut Amberton in Eglinton. Geography Eglinton lies roughly between the proposed Mitchell Freeway to the east and the Indian Ocean to the west. Eglinton's population was measured by the ABS in the 2016 census as 2,365 with the projected population for 2021 being 6,983. Facilities Eglinton has no conventional facilities at the present stage but the Amberton and Allara estates are now under development with some houses built, many more under construction and many blocks titled. Amberton is joined to Shorehaven which will have very significant infrastructure. Eglinton was previously accessible only by Pipidinny Road, which runs via Pipidinny Swamp to within of the beach. The Alkimos wreck can be viewed from the nearby coastline, where almost untouched beaches are accessible by sandtrack but a paved road is currently under construction. The suburb offers a wide array of native scrubland, woodland and heath, varying in condition from excellent to completely degraded, and including Xanthorrhoea preissii (commonly known as \\"black boys\\"), banksia, sheoak and Nuytsia floribunda.

Its local government area is the City of Wanneroo. History In October 1969, the Government, in a bid to offer affordable land for housing following the McCarrey Report, rezoned a large portion of land in the area from Urban Deferred to Urban, which was then included in land set aside for the State Housing Commission under the Mirrabooka satellite city development scheme. The plan never came to fruition, although a town planning scheme was approved by the Shire of Wanneroo in September 1970. On 26 June 1970, the Shire gazetted the name \\"Girrawheen\\", meaning \\"place of flowers\\" or \\"the place where flowers grow\\" in an Eastern States Aboriginal language, possibly that of the Kambuwal people in southeastern Queensland. The name was already in use for the Girraween National Park near Stanthorpe, Queensland, Queensland, and a suburb of Girraween in western Sydney was gazetted five years later. Geography Girrawheen is located north of Perth's central business district, and is bounded by Wanneroo Road to the west, Beach Road to the south, Marangaroo Drive to the north and Mirrabooka Avenue to the east. Demographics In the , Girrawheen had a population of 8,334. Girrawheen residents had a median age of 33 compared to the Perth median of 37, and median incomes were below average for the state ‚Äî $494 per week compared with $662 per week.

It was published in Japan in 2003 and 2004 in Kodansha's Young Magazine Uppers magazine, based on the novel The Kouga Ninja Scrolls by Futaro Yamada published in 1958. The anime, produced in 2005 by Gonzo, closely follows the manga aside from a handful of distinctions. The manga won the 2004 Kodansha Manga Award for general manga. Segawa continued producing serialized adaptations of Futaro Yamada's novels with The Yagyu Ninja Scrolls in 2005, Yama Fu-Tang in 2010, and J≈´: Ninp≈ç Makai Tensei in 2012. Additionally, a two- part novel sequel titled , penned by Masaki Yamada, was published in 2015 with illustrations by Segawa; a manga adaptation, , illustrated by Tatsuya Shihira with character designs by Masaki Segawa, was serialized between 2017 and 2019, and an anime adaptation by Seven Arcs Pictures aired in 2018. The story takes place in the year 1614. Two ninja clans, Iga of Tsubagakure and the Kouga of Manjidani, battle each other to determine which grandson of Tokugawa Ieyasu will become the next shogun. The deadly competition between 10 elite ninja from each clan unleashes a centuries-old hatred that threatens to destroy all hope for peace between them. Plot At the dawn of Japan's Azuchi-Momoyama period (the late 16th century) two rival ninja clans, the Iga Tsubagakure and Kouga Manjidani, are engaged in a bitter blood feud that has spanned for centuries. The fighting finally ends when Hattori Hanz≈ç the 1st succeeds in forging a cease fire between the two clans by conscripting both into the service of Tokugawa Ieyasu (the man who seized power to become Shogun and form Japan's first truly stable form of centralized government). Regardless, hostilities and bad blood remain between Kouga and Iga, ensuring a tenuous co- existence at best. Fast forward to the year 1614; Ieyasu has retired from power (although he still wields considerable influence within the government) and passed the torch to his son Hidetada. Unfortunately, a succession dispute has risen concerning which of Ieyasu's grandsons are destined to take up the reins of power when their father finally decides to step down. The various government retainers are beginning to take sides and the Tokugawa Shogunate is on the verge of tearing itself apart. In order to solve the problem before it spirals out of control, Ieyasu orders the no hostilities pact between Kouga and Iga canceled and promptly commands each clan to send 10 of their best ninja to enter a ruthless and bloody competition of kill or be killed. Each clan will represent one of the two factions supporting Ieyasu's grandsons; the names of their selected fighters recorded on two identical scrolls to be marked out in blood upon their death. The clan that slays the chosen ten of the other will be given favor for a thousand years while the grandson they represent will be pronounced the undisputed heir to the Shogunate. Prior to the conflicts renewal, Kouga and Iga's two young heirs (Gennosuke and Oboro respectively) were betrothed to each other in the hopes that their union would finally dispel their clan's long-seated animosity toward each other. Forced headlong onto separate sides of a conflict they want no part of, Gennosuke and Oboro must now choose whether to kill the person they love or lead their entire clan to annihilation.
