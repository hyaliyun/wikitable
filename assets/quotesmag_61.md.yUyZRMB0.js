The city of Mechelen was conquered by Calvinist forces from Brussels which included a large contingent of English mercenaries. The city was brutally sacked and its religious treasures destroyed or plundered.Harline & Put p. 127‚Äì129  Prelude  In 1579, the Lordship of Mechelen was one of the few territories in the Netherlands that had remained loyal to the Spanish King. Most surrounding cities, like Antwerp, Brussels and Ghent were ruled by Calvinists. There in 1580, plans were made to take over all remaining loyal cities, to deny the Spanish army any stronghold behind the frontline.Nolan, J. p 46 The frontline in 1580  Mechelen taken  The Calvinist mayor of Brussels, Olivier van den Tympel, gathered a military force, supported by English troops under command of John Norreys and Scottish under command of Captain Stuart. After a short battle with Mechelen's Schutterij and Spanish troops the city was easily taken.Knight, Charles Raleigh: Historical records of The Buffs, East Kent Regiment (3rd Foot) formerly designated the Holland Regiment and Prince George of Denmark's Regiment. Vol I. London, Gale & Polden, 1905, p. 18 The English however turned against the population and plundered homes, churches and monasteries, later on the tombstones were removed from the cemeteries and sold in England. Some sixty civilians were killed and Archbishop Mathias Hovius hid in a cupboard for three days and then fled the city, dressed as a peasant. The Carmelite monk Petrus de Wolf participated in the defence of the city and was killed by John Norreys himself with his bare hands. Mechelen remained under Calvinist rule until it was reconquered in 1585 by the Spanish under Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma as one of the last cities in the Southern Netherlands. The 1580 event was named the English Fury after the Spanish Fury that hit the city in 1572.Nolan, C. p 269  References  ;Citations ;Bibliography * (Dutch)  ;External links History Reconsidered: Eighty Years War 1568 -1648 Category:Battles of the Eighty Years' War Category:Battles in Flanders Category:1580 in the Habsburg Netherlands Category:Conflicts in 1580 Category:Eighty Years' War (1566‚Äì1609) ","title":"English Fury at Mechelen"},{"id":"36629746","text":"Helen Lee may refer to: *Helen Lee (American fashion designer) (died 1991), American children's clothes designer *Helen Lee (Chinese fashion designer), Chinese fashion designer *Helen Lee (artist) American artist and glassblower *Helen Lee (cricketer) (born 1943), Australian cricketer *Helen Lee (director) (born c. 1965), Korean-Canadian film director *Helen Lee (researcher), medical researcher and inventor ","title":"Helen Lee"},{"id":"36629766","text":"Christine Bjerendal (born 3 February 1987 in Lindome, Sweden) is a Swedish archer.

Following their arrival, the passengers‚Äîseeking refuge in Canada after the Sri Lankan Civil War‚Äîwere transferred to detention facilities in the Lower Mainland, for which the Canadian Government would garner heavy criticism from various Canadian advocacy groups.  The incident  MV Sun Sea, which had been tracked by multiple countries since June 2010, was intercepted off the coast of British Columbia on August 12, 2010, and boarded by Canadian authorities. Escorted by and , it docked at CFB Esquimalt on August 13. 492 Sri Lankan asylum seekers (including 380 men, 63 women, and 49 minors) were on board, having left from Thailand on a three-month voyage. All made refugee claims due to violence in Sri Lanka and the Sri Lankan Civil War. On August 14 and 15, the adult migrants were transferred to \\"accommodation and detention facilities\\" in the Lower Mainland, while minors were taken to low-risk facilities, with their mothers if they were accompanied.  Aftermath  In February 2011, the incident was estimated to have cost the federal government $25 million. On February 10, 2011, Amnesty International Canada, the Canadian Council for Refugees, the Canadian Tamil Congress, and the International Civil Liberties Monitoring Group criticized \\"the government's aggressive efforts to keep the passengers of the MV Sun Sea in detention,\\" claiming that In 2012, Prime Minister Stephen Harper gave Thailand $12 million to battle human smuggling operations, and the government toughened immigration laws and penalties on human smugglers. Six suspects‚Äîtwo Canadians and four Sri Lankans‚Äîwere charged in connection with the case. In May 2018, Public Works and Government Services of Canada issued Letter of Interest for vessel Disposal scheduled to be complete by March 31, 2019. As of August 2019, the vessel was moved to the Nanaimo Shipyard. The disposal contract was awarded to Canadian Maritime Engineering of Victoria, British Columbia for scrapping. Entire ship-breaking was completed in December 2019. = Passengers = As of May 18, 2012, the majority of the passengers had been released, with refugee claims in progress. Two were in police custody, three were in Canada Border Services Agency detention, 19 had been given deportation orders for alleged crimes, six had been accepted as refugees, and six had had their claims rejected. At least one of the passengers from Sun Sea who was deported from Canada was detained and tortured by Sri Lankan authorities. In July 2011, Sathyapavan Aseervatham, one of the passengers on Sun Sea, was deported from Canada to Sri Lanka, where he was arrested by authorities upon his arrival and detained for over one year. After his releases from custody, Aseervatham provided an affidavit to his Canadian lawyer outlining the physical and psychological torture he suffered while detained in a Sri Lankan prison. This affidavit was provided to the Refugee Protection Division in private proceedings for other Sun Sea migrant hearings. It was later discovered that Canadian immigration authorities had shared this confidential affidavit with the Sri Lankan authorities who allegedly tortured Aseervatham. He was subsequently killed in Sri Lanka when an unknown motorist struck him on the street. Kirushna Kumar Kanagaratnam was another passenger murdered sometime late in 2015, being one of a number of men killed by serial killer Bruce McArthur in Toronto. His refugee claim, too, had been denied.

Lond: Methuen, 1967. p. 60-61 Another group that resisted integration in UGTAN were unions in French Equatorial Africa linked to the pro-Soviet World Federation of Trade Unions. Countering UGTAN, the WTFU-affiliated Cameroonian trade union centre CGTK launched Conf√©d√©ration g√©n√©rale a√©fienne du travail (CGAT). In Soviet discourse, UGTAN was condemned as a 'petty bourgeois-racist' entity.Agyeman, Opoku. The Failure of Grassroots Pan- Africanism: The Case of the All-African Trade Union Federation. Lanham [u.a.]: Lexington Books, 2003. p. 121 =Bamako conference and loi cadre= At the onset UGTAN committees were dominated by people hailing from the CGT, with Abdoulaye Diallo as general secretary. However, the influence of the CGT leaders was soon outmaneuvered by the former CGTA functionaries under the helm of S√©kou Tour√©.Cooper, Frederick. Decolonization and African Society: The Labor Question in French and British Africa. Cambridge [u.a.]: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1996. p. 415 The UGTAN leadership met in Bamako in March 1958. By this time the organization was faced with internal difficulties. The expansion of the organization had been stalled at many points. Nor had a functioning UGTAN administration been set up. Moreover, under the loi cadre autonomy had been established in the French West African territories, enabling many UGTAN leaders to assume public offices, creating confusion as to whom represented the government and whom represented the union movement leadership. After the 1957 elections UGTAN leaders became Ministers of Labour or Ministers of Civil Service in seven out of the nine territories of French West Africa. Abdoulaye Diallo (Minister of Labour of French Sudan) was amongst the UGTAN leaders that moved away from union organizing towards party politics. =1958 referendum= A second meeting in Bamako, held September 10‚Äì11, 1958, decided that UGTAN would campaign for a 'No' vote (i.e. for independence) in the referendum on the French Community. Union syndicale des travailleurs de Guin√©e, the Guinean section of UGTAN, formed one of the pillars in guaranteeing a victory for the 'No' side in Guinea. However many other sectors of UGTAN did not heed the call from the Bamako meeting, rather adopting the 'Yes' line of the political parties that they were aligned with. The Ivorian section outright rejected the 'No' line.Coleman, James Smoot, and Carl Gustav Rosberg. Political Parties and National Integration in Tropical Africa. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1964. p. 366 The referendum campaign left UGTAN divided. The Senegalese Progressive Union (UPS) managed to divide UGTAN in Senegal, and a new organization (UGTAN-Autonome) was founded under the leadership of Abbas Gu√®ye. UGTAN participated in the December 1958 All-African Peoples' Conference, and voiced its support to the Ghana‚ÄìGuinea Union.Agyeman, Opoku. The Failure of Grassroots Pan-Africanism: The Case of the All-African Trade Union Federation.

(General Union of Negro African Workers) held at Conakry, 15th to 18th January 1959: Report on policy and doctrine In his report to the congress, S√©kou Tour√© emphasized three points: African independence, the political contributions of the trade union movement and international relations. Delegations from the French CGT, All-China Federation of Trade Unions, AFL‚ÄìCIO and national trade union confederations of Ghana, Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia participated in the event.Fonteneau, G√©rard. Histoire du syndicalisme en Afrique. Paris: Karthala [u.a.], 2004. p. 61 The congress elected S√©kou Tour√© as president as UGTAN and John Tettegah (from the Ghana Trades Union Congress) as vice president. =Splits in Senegal= In mid-1959 the Senegalese branch was again divided, as the UGTAN general secretary Alioune Ciss√© broke away and founded UGTAN-unitaire. The loyalist wing in Senegal, also known as UGTAN-orthodoxe, was led by Seydou Diallo. Likewise there were other splits in the movement. In March 1959 seventeen Nigerien unions broke with UGTAN, and founded UGTAN-Autonome in Niger. =Suppression= UGTAN came into conflicts with local governments in several of the colonies. In Niger, Dahomey and Upper Volta the authorities sought to suppress the movement. In Niger the UGTAN leader and former Minister of Labour Saloum Traor√© was exiled. In Ivory Coast tension between the trade union movement (UGTAN and CATC) and the government of F√©lix Houphou√´t-Boigny arose, as the government sought to build a yellow union in the public sector. The conflict escalated in the second half of 1959, as the leader of the Ivorian UGTAN branch Yao N'go Blaise was exiled to Guinea.

He set up a tannery in 1907 and emerged as a prosperous businessman serving as President of the Southern Indian Chamber of Commerce. He founded the Melvisharam Muslim Educational Society in 1918 with a golden dream of transforming his town into a splendid seat of great learning to cater to the educational needs of youth. Like the winds that have no barriers of caste or community, the Nawab‚Äôs generosity lighted the lamp of joy and contentment in several poverty-ridden families. His colorful dreams have all been realized by the Melvisharam Muslim Educational Society that strove hard to transform Primary, Secondary and Higher Education into splendid segments of pristine enlightenment irrespective of caste, creed, community or social status. The work continues even now with zeal and rejuvenating spirit.http://mmes.ac.in/society.html  Early life  Hakim was born in North Arcot district of India in 1863 and at age of 21 he moved to the city of Madras in 1884 to join his father Siddique Hussain Sahib. Having picked up the ropes of business, he started in 1907 a small business in hides and skins but grew it to such an extent that he became a merchant prince and a major donor to charities. The best-known of charitable contributions is Siddique Sarai Mosque, the Muslim choultry opposite Central Station.https://tamilnadu-favtourism.blogspot.com/2018/11/siddique-sarai- mosque-park-town-chennai.html His son Late C.Siddique (Named after his father) continued with philanthropic work.  Politics  Hakim founded the Madras Provincial Muslim League in 1908. Later, he started the Muslim Progressive Party and served as its President. Hakim was appointed Sheriff of Madras in 1930 and elected to the Madras Legislative Assembly in 1937.  Melvisharam Muslim Educational Society  C. Abdul Hakeem founded Melvisharam Muslim Educational Society. The Society has gradually progressed across these 8 decades. To start with, there was only a Primary School under this Society. And at present, it manages 11 Institutions from the nursery level to a First Grade College with Five P.G. Departments and Three Research Departments. They include M.M.E.S. Arts and science college for women and C. Abdul Hakeem College of Engineering and Technology, an I.S.O certified Centre of learning. The College was instituted in the year 1965 with just Pre-University Course, in the local orphanage buildings. Subsequently the M.M.E.S. acquired a site of more than 67 acres, on the eastern outskirts of the town, on the Chennai- Bangalore Trunk road, and constructed imposing buildings to house the College and the Hostel. The college is affiliated to Thiruvalluvar University, Vellore. The college has been Re-accredited by the NAAC with 'A' Grade. At present, the College offers instruction in 31 Courses at Under-Graduate level and in 6 Courses at Post-Graduate level, apart from facilities for research leading to the award of Ph.D. http://www.cahc.edu.in/about/ MMES manages and maintains the following prominent institutions.http://cahcet.in/en/?page_id=131 * C.

Build one, he suggested to his son. And so, Abdul Hakim bought land opposite Ripon Building in an auction for Rs. 50,000 and laid the foundation stone for the Sarai in 1919. Claiming that the building was coming too near its tracks, the South Indian Railway raised objections to its construction.Siddique Sarai Mosque 1 The consequent case went up to the Privy Council and, eventually, after its ruling, the building was completed and inaugurated in 1921. The Sarai is now vested in the Jamaath of the Periamet mosque. Among Abdul Hakim‚Äôs other contributions are the Muslim High School in Triplicane, of which he was one of the founders. In Melvisharam, a higher secondary school and an engineering college bear his name.

It was performed in 1973.Mitchell 1999, p. 124 The monologue is a tribute to Giuseppina Modena (known as Mamma Togni), partisan gold medalist of the Italian Resistance, who during the Second World War lost her husband and 22-year-old son Lorenzo \\"Enzo\\" Togni, to whom a Garibaldi partisan brigade was named. On April 9, 1972 during the campaign for the 1972 Italian general election, the woman interrupted a meeting of the deputy Franco Servello, hitting him with a walking stick: for this reason the woman was arrested along with eight other people (including Rinaldo Nalli and Luigi Pastorelli, respectively municipal councillors of the Socialist party and Communist party) and tried, but eventually she was acquitted in 1976. It was performed for the first time during the Liberation Day in the square in Pavia on 25 April 1972, played by Franca Rame, and then published by Einaudi in Guerra di popolo in Cile (1973). The monologue was performed by Franca Rame also on 31 December 1975 in Piazza del Duomo, Milan..Mitchell, Tony. The People's Court Jester, Methuen Books, London, 1999. Plot summary Mamma Togni is a seventy-year-old former legendary partisan nurse from the Apennines hills of the Oltrep√≤ Pavese. One day some boys called her into the street that Senator Franco Servello was holding a political rally in the square of Mont√π Beccaria (province of Pavia, Lombardy), where during the Second World War the fascists had killed 14 partisans in front of their mothers eyes. Mamma Togni rushed in front of the stage of the rally, unleashing her stick and hits the microphone and then the knee of the politician and offending him as fascist. The captain of the Carabinieri tries to stop Mamma Togni's trouble, who reiterates that she cannot tolerate the presence of a fascist in that place, since the fascists have killed her son. Eleven guys who followed the scene from the arcades of the square approach, but are loaded and beaten in blood by Carabinieri for no reason and finally arrested and loaded on a truck to police station. Mamma Togni, together with a communist councillor, runs to the police station to talk to the Questore and tell how the whole thing happened, but the marshal stops them and at a certain point he falls pretending to have been hit by someone. Fifty Carabinieri arrive and begin to truncheon the councillor and Mamma Togni, who are arrested and tried immediately, while dozens of citizens of the village arrive outside the police station to ask for the release of Mamma Togni. The trial takes place in a farcical manner, with the judge trying in every way to avoid the conviction for Mamma Togni, who instead proudly claims to have deliberately gone to the main square to throw a beating at Senator Servello screaming \\"fascists killers\\". The judge, however, does not feel up to continuing the process and makes everyone free: it is a great joy, similar to the Liberation Day. Mamma Togni remembers the war, when she saved 32 wounded guys from the great raking of the winter of 1944-1945, placing them in a farmhouse and feeding them every day, with the good ones (receiving the help of farmers and mountain dwellers) or with the bad ones (robbing the wealthy with her pistol P38). One day a partisan told her that his son Enzo Togni had been killed on 18 September 1944 in Varzi by the \\"black robbers\\". Addressing her boys, the nurse tells them that, having no one left, from now on she would become the mother of all: Mamma Togni. The monologue ends with Mamma Togni who, answering to those who tell her not to get in the way anymore, because she is too old and had already done her duty, says that as long as there will be fascist killers around, we must go to the streets to tell the young people what happened during the war. While only those who give up fighting are old, remaining warm at home with a cap lent by the old and dead Christian Democrats as Amintore Fanfani and Giulio Andreotti.Online English translation: Mamma Togni: A dramatic monologue by Dario Fo translated by Ed Emery.

The evictions were first ordered by the city's municipal government as part of a massive reconstruction effort aimed at increasing the appeal of the downtown metropolis. From 2011 onward, the number of housing complexes being forcibly vacated has increased substantially. Numerous development projects have begun in the aftermath of the housing demolitions, including new parking lots, several boutique stores, boulevards, skyscrapers, a shopping center, luxury housing, and a Formula One race track. There are also plans to build a 1,050 m (3,444 ft) housing complex, which would make it the world's tallest man-made structure upon completion. Baku city officials have stated that the compensation being offered to residents is fair, while human rights groups argue that residents have been pressured to leave without adequate compensation to buy similar dwellings elsewhere. Independent observers estimate that several thousand people have been displaced as a result of the forced evictions. Background Skyline of Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan gained independence from the Soviet Union following its dissolution in 1991. Despite severe infrastructural damage resulting from the Nagorno-Karabakh War and the post-Soviet transition phase, the country has managed to develop a robust and stable economy through revenues from petroleum exports. The State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic (abbreviated as \\"SOCAR\\") is the 68th largest organization in the world, valued at roughly $20 billion USD. Azerbaijan ranks 7th in the world on an aggregate list of countries by proven natural gas reserves,Rank Order - Natural gas - proved reserves , accessed in August 2012 as well as 19th on a similarly compiled list of nations by proven petroleum reserves.Rank Order - Oil - proved reserves , accessed in August 2012 In recent times, Azerbaijan has made efforts to focus on greater cultural and economic integration with the West, notably through hosting the 57th annual Eurovision contest in 2012. Demolitions According to a Human Rights Watch (HRW) report, authorities used various methods to expel people from their homes, including arbitrary arrests and detentions, deprivation of basic necessities for occupants in targeted households, intimidation, and beginning the demolition process prior to the evacuation of inhabitants. The report stated that authorities sometimes acted without any prior notice. Construction of new public facilities and attractions generally commenced shortly after demolition, with a new 25,000 square metre park nearing completion as of 1 August 2012. The government offered to compensate the former residents of expropriated properties. HRW criticized the reimbursements as being inadequate for purchasing any new property in Baku. Those who refused compensation were evicted and often became homeless. In the run-up to the 2012 Eurovision Song Contest, authorities evicted more residents to make room for the Baku Crystal Hall arena, where the event would subsequently be held. Zohrab Ismayil, who authored a report on forced evictions in Baku, said that 281 families were evicted to make room for construction, and that the government paid them compensation below the market rate on several occasions. The government stated that the evictions had no relevance to the contest, but were part of a larger seven-year reconstruction plan aimed at developing the downtown area of the city. Reactions The evictions were condemned by several international human rights organizations, including Freedom House, Human Rights Watch, and Amnesty International. As part of a resolution passed by the European Parliament on 24 May 2012, which condemned Azerbaijan's human rights abuses, the elected body also expressed alarm over the mass expulsion of civilians from their households for future development projects, including the Crystal Palace. The evictions became a point of contention in Azerbaijan's successful bid to host the 2012 Eurovision Song Contest. On two occasions, authorities were accused of retaliating against activists and journalists who publicized the evictions. On 11 August 2011, the office of Azerbaijani human rights activist Leyla Yunus was bulldozed without warning, giving the occupants no time to salvage furniture or other personal belongings. All documents inside the building at the time of its demolition were destroyed. An Azeri MP denied that the demolition was connected with Yunus's activism. The European Union delegation to Baku stated that it \\"deplored\\" the destruction of her organization's office, describing her as \\"a regular partner of the international community\\". The demolition came hours after The New York Times published an article detailing Yunus's advocacy against the forced evictions. Later, on 18 April 2012, several Azeri journalists were severely beaten by SOCAR security forces, allegedly for covering the demolitions while they were in process. This includes Idrak Abbasov, who was subsequently hospitalized in critical condition.

The standard warp yarn is paired with a skeleton or 'doup' yarn; these twisted warp yarns grip tightly to the weft which causes the durability of the fabric. Leno weave produces an open fabric with almost no yarn slippage or misplacement of threads. Uses Woven leno mesh bag for shellfish, firewood and produce. Leno weave fabric allows light and air to pass through freely so are used in any area where a sheer, open weave fabric is required that will not bruise (where the threads shift away from their woven uniformity disturbing the beauty of the weave). If a simple in-and-out flat weave were woven very loosely to achieve the same effect the threads would have a tendency to this bruising.

It can be found from a dimensional reduction of 11D supergravity by making the size of seven of the dimensions go to zero. It has eight supersymmetries, which is the most any gravitational theory can have, since there are eight half-steps between spin 2 and spin -2. (The spin 2 graviton is the particle with the highest spin in this theory.) More supersymmetries would mean the particles would have superpartners with spins higher than 2. The only theories with spins higher than 2 which are consistent involve an infinite number of particles (such as String Theory and Higher-Spin Theories). Stephen Hawking in his Brief History of Time speculated that this theory could be the Theory of Everything. However, in later years this was abandoned in favour of String Theory. There has been renewed interest in the 21st century, with the possibility that this theory may be finite. Calculations It has been found recently that the expansion of N=8 Supergravity in terms of Feynman diagrams has shown that N=8 Supergravity is in some ways a product of two N = 4 super Yang‚ÄìMills theories. This is written schematically as: N = 8 Supergravity = (N = 4 Super Yang‚ÄìMills) √ó (N = 4 Super Yang‚ÄìMills) This is not surprising, as N=8 supergravity contains six independent representations of N=4 Super Yang‚ÄìMills. Particle content The theory contains 1 graviton (spin 2), 8 gravitinos (spin 3/2), 28 vector bosons (spin 1), 56 fermions (spin 1/2), 70 scalar fields (spin 0) where we don't distinguish particles with negative spin. These numbers are simple combinatorial numbers that come from Pascal's Triangle and also the number of ways of writing n as a sum of 8 nonnegative cubes A173681. One reason why the theory was abandoned was that the 28 vector bosons which form an O(8) gauge group is too small to contain the standard model U(1)xSU(2)xSU(3) gauge group, which can only fit within the orthogonal group O(10). For model building, it has been assumed that almost all the supersymmetries would be broken in nature, leaving just one supersymmetry (N=1), although nowadays because of the lack of evidence for N=1 supersymmetry higher supersymmetries are now being considered such as N=2. Connection with superstring theory N=8 Supergravity can be viewed as the low energy approximation of the type IIA or type IIB superstring with 6 of its dimensions compactified on a 6-torus. Equivalently, it may also be viewed as 11D M-Theory with seven of its dimensions compactified on a 7-torus. Global symmetries Some surprising global symmetries have been found in this theory. For example, it has been shown that there is an E‚Çá global symmetry but in order for the theory to be finite it is thought that there may be other symmetries not yet found.

This species is a tree growing up to 30 meters in height with a trunk diameter reaching 30 centimeters. The smooth bark is a mottled gray color. There are ochrea up to 12 centimeters in length. The leaves are oval to oblong and measure up to 40 centimeters long by 20 wide. The undersides are sometimes woolly with brown fibers. The tree is dioecious. The male flowers are around 2 millimeters long, while the female flowers are up to 5 centimeters long. The sex ratio of the species is skewed, with many more female plants than male.Melampy, M.

It has been introduced to areas outside its native range, including Hawaii and southern Africa. This species is a myrmecophyte, forming a mutualistic relationship with ants. Ants living on the plant include Pseudomyrmex triplarinus. This species lives within the tree, feeding on substances produced by it, and defending it against invaders.Bakalar, N. Polite guests, ants pick host trees out of a crowd. New York Times May 13, 2011. This tree is known as a \\"novice tree\\" (pau-de-novato) because only one unfamiliar with the tree would touch it, soon discovering that the ants are aggressive and venomous. This tree is considered a noxious weed in southern Africa. The fruits are dispersed on the wind and the seedlings easily take hold and become invasive, growing in the local habitat and displacing native plants.

Inquiries to the Bureau During the years the Bureau operated it recorded more than a million inquiries. The Bureau kept a record of these inquiries, and in the 1990s computerized these records. After the Bureau was closed, the database of these records, from the 1940s to the 1970s, was transferred to the Central Zionist Archives. The Bureau's activities expanded over the years to include also search for missing relatives even not as a result of the Holocaust. For example, the Bureau acted during the mass Aliyah to Israel of the 90s, to trace in Israel the relatives of Jews in the former Soviet Union. The inquiries of the missing relatives' seekers were filed into folders, and included data regarding the Applicant (usually name, address, date of birth, country of origin) and concerning the people it should locate. If there were any communications regarding the application or any attached documents, it was also filed into the folder along with the original application. Inquiries portfolios were saved in the archives of the Jewish Agency. These portfolios are not open for public viewing, however, one can contact the Central Zionist Archives for information from the database of records and from the Bureau's portfolios. Relatives' search advertising and Survivors details Relatives Search requests were published in the media in Israel and abroad. At the beginning, in Mandatory Palestine, these search requests were broadcast by Kol Yerushalayim (The Voice of Jerusalem) that later turned into Kol Yisrael (The Voice of Israel) after the establishment of the state of Israel. Abroad, these requests were broadcast by Kol Zion La Golah (\\"The Voice of Zion to the Diaspora\\"), a radio especially established to Broadcast from Israel to the Jewish diaspora. These broadcastings were both in Hebrew and Yiddish in order to reach the widest audience possible. Yael Ben- Yehuda, one of the announcers of \\"Search Bureau for Missing Relatives\\" program at Kol Yisrael radio, said in 2006 that for many years she avoided participating in advertisements for German companies after participating in this program. Search requests were also published on the weekly Lakarov velarahok (\\"To [those] near and far\\"), produced by the Bureau in collaboration with the rescue committee. The Newsletter included details of the names of Holocaust survivors at Displaced persons camps in various European cities, lists of immigrants to Israel, Relatives Search requests, greeting messages on the radio etc. Overall, 73 editions were published (and one special supplement issued between the 38th and 39th edition), which included more than 180,000 names of survivors. The Bureau also published the \\"Pinkas ha-Nitzolim\\" (\\"Register of Jewish Survivors.\\") booklets with the names of survivors. Volume I consisted 60,000 names, and Volume II 58,000 names. Sources for tracing relatives Among the sources of information used by the Bureau to locate relatives: *Immigration certificates (\\"Pinkas Oleh\\").The Immigration certificates at Central Zionist Archives and the state archives were scanned and uploaded to a computer at the Central Zionist Archives in a searchable form (of dates, names of ships and names of immigrants) for visitors From 1919, immigrants' lists were recorded, which chronologically documented the Jewish Immigration (\\"Aliyah\\") to Mandatory Palestine and later to the state of Israel. These lists included names, age and country of origin of immigrants by date of arrival of ships, aircraft or by pedestrian crossings. Apart from these Jewish immigrants, the records included passenger who arrived as tourists or as returning residents. It also included a column of \\"non-Jewish\\" or \\"Christian\\". Today, Immigration certificates are being reserved in the Central Zionist Archives and the Israel State Archives. *ITS archives. The International Tracing Service (ITS), which existed in various incarnations since 1943, and from 1954 is managed by the Red Cross, and supervised by a committee of representatives of the governments of member states, including the State of Israel. These archives consists of millions of documents from Nazi Germany, including documents found in concentration camps after the camps were liberated, including documents about the deportation of civilians, forced laborers, refugees etc. The next-generation successors of the Search Bureau for Missing Relatives *An Israeli radio show in the format of the Search Bureau for Missing Relatives was aired between 2000-2002 in cooperation with Kol Yisrael, the Jewish Agency, and the Central Zionist Archives. The search in the Zionist Archives, which included eight million documents, was carried out by the Sherut Leumi girls serving there. *In 2007, an Israeli radio program in the same format and with the same name: \\"Search Bureau for Missing Relatives\\", was renewed by Yaron Enosh on KolYisrael, which is broadcast five times a week. The program is based on inquiries of listeners to the show, about 150 a day. The inquiries for missing persons are from the period of the Holocaust, however there are also inquiries for MIAs, and even for the resumption of relations that were cut off in different times and for different circumstances. In April 2012, the show moved to the presentation and editing of Izzy Mann. *The Israeli Ministry of Immigrant Absorption provides search services for new immigrants in search of their relatives in Israel. *The International Tracing Unit of Magen David Adom is the present-generation successor of the Search Bureau for Missing Relatives, under the authority of the Red Cross and the International Tracing Service.

Retrieved August 4, 2012. Australia's Tourism commission invested in the film to introduce Australia to Chinese tourism. Synopsis Heartbeat Love is a miniseries that chronicles the love story between two travelers named Lee Wei Chen and Yang Xiao Yu (played by Show Lo and Rainie Yang respectively) who, due to a gender misunderstanding on Xiao Yu's part, share a hotel room in Australia. Xiao Yu initially mistakes Lee as being gay, and therefore agrees to share a room and sleep on the same bed as him. (This misunderstanding happened because Lee accidentally exchanged his bag with a gay named GayGay.) The night when they share the room Lee manages to get Gaygay's phone number and arranges to meet up the next day and switch back the suitcases. The next day, they go out together and accidentally fall in love with each other after pretending to be a married couple. After the day ended, they both went back to the hotel. In the hotel, Gaygay was waiting in the lobby for them and they exchanged their bag. Xiao Yu is very angry about Lee's deception. She slaps him and runs away. Day after that, they both went to Melbourne deciding they will not share the same room anymore so they both went to different directions. That day, they coincidentally meet up several times, much to Xiao Yu's anger and Lee's chagrin. They end up meeting again in a food store, where Xiao Yu is forced to beg for Lee's help in escaping a guy who comes in, though she refuses to tell Lee who the man is. They continue their day and Xiao Yu finally forgives Lee. They end up kissing and sleeping together. They continue to vacation, until the man Xiao Yu had run from shows up while she is trying on wedding dresses. Lee helps her escape again, but demands the truth from her. She tells him that her life is similar to \\"Roman Holiday,\\" a film in which a runaway bride seizes her last few days of independence. Lee asks her if she ever had any feelings for him, and she says no. Heartbroken, he returns to Taiwan. After a year, Lee meets up with the man Xiao Yu had run from. Lee asks about their marriage, and the man informs him that he is Xiao Yu's brother. He hands Lee a video explaining that Xiao Yu hadn't been engaged‚Äîshe'd undergone a very risky heart surgery and hadn't wanted to hurt him by telling him the truth. Lee goes to the island to find her‚Äîfollowing the trail of pictures that she left him‚Äîand they meet up in Tasmania happily. Cast * Rainie Yang as Yang Xiao Yu: diagnosed with a heart disease from a young age, she was protected and sheltered for the first twenty years of her life. Faced with a surgery with only 1/3 chance of success, she decides to throw caution to the wind and travel. Through a series of misunderstandings and coincidences, she meets and falls in love with Lee Wei Chen. Due to her reluctance to share her heart condition, she continually lies to him, even allowing her brother to tell Lee that she had died. In the end, she reunites with Lee and it is implied that they get married. * Show Lo as Lee Wei Chen: a photographer, Lee claims to be able to read truth off a person's eyes, and demonstrates several times on Xiao Yu. He seems to fall in love with her first, and is continuously upset when she refuses to tell him the truth about why she came to the island. Despite this, he protects her and helps her escape from the man who she tells him is her fiance, but who, in reality, is her brother.

It begins at U.S. Highway 93 in Polson in the Flathead Indian Reservation and ends at U.S. Highway 2 in Evergreen, the eastern portion of the city of Kalispell. As well as serving the townships along the eastern shore of Flathead Lake, it also serves as a de facto alternative route of US 93 between Polson and Kalispell. Route description MT 35 begins within the Flathead Indian Reservation, in the eastern outskirts of Polson, at an intersection with US 93. Initially, the highway heads east in a straight line. After a few miles, the road takes an abrupt turn northwards as it meets the foothills of the Mission Mountains. Passing Flathead Lake's East Bay, it then forms the eastern boundary of the community of Finley Point. Meeting Skidoo Bay of the lake, MT 35 is then squeezed between the shoreline on its left and the mountain range on its right and is forced by the topography to wind its way northwards between the two. After leaving the Flathead Indian Reservation, the road passes through the community of Woods Bay before crossing from Lake to Flathead County. Very soon afterwards, the highway enters Bigfork and intersects Secondary Highway 209 (S-209), the \\"Ferndale cutoff\\", before crossing the Swan River, one of Flathead Lake's tributaries. On the northern outskirts of Bigfork, MT 35 meets the ends of MT 83 and MT 82 in quick succession, before continuing northwards amidst farmland. After zigzagging to the northwest through the community of Creston, MT 35 reaches Haines Junction, the intersection with S-206, which allows motorists to shortcut to the communities further upstream along the Flathead River. MT 35 heads west from this junction and crosses the Flathead River into Evergreen, and intersects with Helena Flats Road and S-317 just before reaching its northern terminus at US 2 soon afterwards; traffic travelling straight-ahead from this point moves onto US 2 westbound towards Kalispell.

History It was discovered by Yoshiyuki Urushibara in 1951, while doing research on the reduction of estrone to estradiol. Preparation First nickel is precipitated in metallic form by reacting a solution of a nickel salt with an excess of zinc. This precipitated nickel contains relatively large amounts of zinc and zinc oxide. Then the catalyst is activated by digesting with either base or acid. There are different designations for differently prepared Urushibara nickel catalysts. The most common is U-Ni-A and U-Ni-B. U-Ni-A is prepared by digesting the precipitated nickel with an acid such as acetic acid. U-Ni-B is prepared by digesting with a base such as sodium hydroxide. After the digestion with acid most of the zinc and zinc oxide is dissolved from the catalyst, while after digestion with base it still contains considerable amounts of zinc and zinc oxide. It is also possible to precipitate the nickel using aluminium or magnesium. Properties Urushibara nickel is not pyrophoric. It can be used for most hydrogenations where W-7 grade Raney nickel can be used. Variations Cobalt or iron can substitute for nickel to form different hydrogenation catalysts with different properties, these catalysts are respectively termed Urushibara Cobalt and Urushibara Iron. As a hydrogenation catalyst, Urushibara Cobalt is used for nitrile reduction where it serves as a superior catalyst for the production of primary amines. Urushibara Iron is limited as a catalyst due to its relatively low activity toward most functional groups, however; it does finds some use in the partial hydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes.

The station was established in 1899. The property was owned by the Leonora Pastoral company in 1925, who ran cattle on the leasehold. The Company sold 129 mixed cattle at Midland Junction sales in December 1929, another 28 in January 1930, and another 30 in March 1930. Plans were underfoot to change to sheep as early as 1925 when Geo Sexton, one of company directors, arrived at the station to commence fencing in preparation for the arrival of sheep at the station. The station had also recently purchased eight lorries. By 1926 Nambi sold some of their first clip with 55 bales sold at the Perth sales in October 1926. and another 46 bales in 1928. Approximately 10,000 sheep were shorn at Nambi in 1928, with a total clip of 252 bales of wool. The shearing shed had recently been fitted with 6 stands of Lister machinery, whereas shearing had been all done by hand in the past. The Leonora Pastoral company put the property up for auction in 1930, advertising the property as having an area of with tenure up until 1948. The station had of 5 or 6 wire sheep-proof fencing enclosing into 14 paddocks and an additional of cattle fencing also in place. Water was available from 23 wells complete with windmills for a flock of approximately 11,000 sheep of which about 6,000 are breeding ewes, 70 cattle and 100 horses. The station was sold to the Murrum Pastoral Company and Mrs C. Fitzgerald in August 1930. They had bought the station for ¬£18,600 with all plant but no sheep. At this time the station occupied an area of and had over of fencing in place. Having little surface water, the property also had 28 wells and in 1930 carried a flock of 9,500 sheep. One of Nambi's neighbours is Clover Downs Station. William Fitzgerald, of the Murrum Pastoral Company died in December 1933, leaving his wife and two sons. One son, Cyril Irwin Fitzgerald, is the manager at Nambi, while the other, Victor Fitzgerald, is the manager at Murrum Station. In 1937 the station bought an additional 70 Bungaree blood rams from the Hagley stud in Tammin, followed by another 25 in 1938. A station employee, William Paul, inadvertently shot himself with his own weapon outside the men's quarters in 1941. The bullet grazed his ribs and lodged in his left arm, but the wound was not serious. The station had a good year in 1948 when 17,715 sheep were shorn and 465 bales of wool were collected which was an increase of 3,500 sheep on the previous year. Lambing was estimated at 81%. Two shearers, members of Len Mitchell's shearing team, became lost when out shooting following rain; this held up shearing in 1949. The two men, Don McDonald and Ronald Bacon went shooting and became lost in the bush where they spent two of the coldest and wettest nights of the year. Both men were found safe and well about from the homestead. Vehicles and trackers from the station covered over in the search for the men. The following year the station sold off 3,000 sheep to nearby Wilbah Station. Cyril Irwin Joseph Fitzgerald, who had owned and managed Nambi since 1933, died in January 1951, aged 41. He left his entire estate to his widow. Minara Resources currently owns Nambi, along with three other nearby properties: Glenorn, Yundamindera and Minara Stations. In 2012 Glenorn and Nambi were running approximately 1,700 head of cattle. By 2016 all four stations were running a herd of cattle.

Asian Studies Center. (1982). Journal of South Asian literature: Volume 17, Issue 1. p. 265. in the post-independence Indian cultural movement of the 1960s and 1970s when India saw a gradual increase in cultural freedom, quality of life, and means of expression, such as literature, fine arts and journalism. Poetry, drama, historical plays and paintings received great impetus. The number of newspapers, magazines and radio increased, with greater acceptance of vernacular and regional media.  Early life and education  Born at Rajnandgaon in Chhattisgarh on 15 October 1929, Surendra had his early education at Sikandarpur (District Farukhabad), Gwalior and Holipura in District Agra. His father Kalika Prasad Chaturvedi was a civil contractor, a Gandhian, and a fan of poems eulogising patriotism and valour. Due to his father's emphasis on reading, the boy developed an interest in novels, short stories, plays, other fiction and poetry. His sister Pramilla was a student of Hindi literature.'Meri Kahani Suniye' by Pramilla Chaturvedi in 'Paavan Smiriti.' Chaturvedi attended Agra and Allahabad universities. Drawn to Parimal and its cultural society, he took active part in all the plays staged under its banner and was recognised for an inborn flair for parody and mimicry. The society was under the patronage of famous poet Harivansh Rai Bachchan, his wife Teji Bachchan and Dharam Veer Bharti. He also attended University of Lucknow for further studies. In 1954 he sailed for Glasgow, Scotland to take study management. Once in England, Chaturvedi participated in BBC cultural programmes.'Mera Parivar' by Meera Chaturvedi in 'Paavan Smiriti.' He returned to India in 1958.  Journalism  Chaturvedi worked for the Bennett Coleman and Company, first in the Public Relations department and then in the print media wing. Chaturvedi was invited to take the role of the anchor at the historic inaugural show of Doordarshan (State TV Channel) on 15 September 1959. He was one of the earliest anchors of the small screen in Lucknow. UP Natak Academy often called him to assess their plays. Navbharat Times, a sister publication in Hindi of the Times of India, posted Chaturvedi as a special correspondent in 1960 to Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh. He reported objectively and frankly on interviews and press conferences of province and state leaders.

Poetry and fine arts  Surendra excelled in muktaks (short poems). He was popular at Kavi sammelan and Mushaira gatherings due to his witty and satirical manner and subject matter. He usually targeted politicians, inefficient and corrupt bureaucrats and orthodox society norms. Top writers, dramatists and poets were his close friends,'Aarthi kisi Gulab ki' by Dr. Dharam Veer Bharati in \\"Dharam Yug\\". such as Dr. Dharamvir Bharati, Amritlal Nagar, Dr. Nagendra, Bhagwati Charan Verma, Yash Pal, Kamleshwar, Giridhar Gopal, Shivani, Dushyant Kumar and Sri Lal Shukla. Stalwarts of music and dance like Begum Akhtar, Birju Maharaj and Shambhu Maharaj often invited him for their performances or renderings. In the later part of his life Surendra developed an interest in painting nature and particularly flowers. He was imaginative and bold with his choice of colours and his work was well regarded by artists Ranbir Singh Bhist and Little. A few days before his death, he had composed a couplet that perhaps carried an indication of his passing away. It read \\"Akela, Par Abaad kar deta huoon veerana, Bahut Royegi mere jane ka bad shame tanhai.\\" [\\"Alone, but I enlive the solitude. Lonely evenings will greatly mourn my departure.\\"] His work on nawabi adab (etiquette in the time of Nawabs) remained incomplete due to his untimely death.  Contribution  Giving a new dimension to Hindi reporting Surendra is to be credited for introducing a style of simple and effective prose. He encouraged Hindi journalists to shed off their inhibition of the reporters accredited to English dailies and magazines.

In a racing career which was disrupted by injury, she ran eleven times and won six races between July 1975 and June 1978. After winning her only race as a two-year-old, she won the Classic 1000 Guineas at Newmarket Racecourse in the spring of 1977. Having missed the second half of her three- year-old season through injury, she returned in 1978. She defeated leading sprinters in the Prix Maurice de Gheest, mile specialists in the Prix Jacques Le Marois, and middle-distances horses in the Champion Stakes. In 1978, she was sent to race in the United States where she was killed in an accident in a race at Belmont Park on 25 June. Background Flying Water was a dark chestnut filly with a white star and a white sock on her left foreleg, bred in France by Dayton Ltd. She was sired by Habitat, an American-bred, British- raced miler who became one of the leading European stallions of the 1970s and 1980s. His other progeny included Habibti, Marwell, Rose Bowl, and Steinlen and he was the British Champion broodmare sire on three occasions. Flying Water's dam, Formentera was a half-sister to the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud winner Felicio and closely related to The Derby winner St. Paddy. During her racing career, Flying Water was owned by Daniel Wildenstein and trained by Angel Penna Sr.. In 1976, Wildenstein and Penna won three of the five British Classics: in addition to Flying Water's 1000 Guineas, they won The Oaks with Pawneese and the St Leger with Crow. Racing career =1975-1976: early career= Flying Water made her first appearance at Chantilly Racecourse in July 1975 and won a maiden race over 1200m, beating a filly called Imogene. The form of the race was later boosted when Imogene finished second to Vitiges in the Group One Prix Morny. Shortly afterwards, the filly developed a splint in one of her legs and was unable to race again that year. On her first appearance of 1976, Flying Water was sent to England for the seven furlong Nell Gwyn Stakes at Newmarket. She won the Group Three event by three lengths and was immediately made favourite for the 1000 Guineas. Three weeks later, Flying Water, ridden by Yves Saint-Martin, started 2/1 favourite in a field of twenty-five fillies for the 1000 Guineas. The field split into two groups across the wide Rowley Mile course, with Flying Water towards the back of the group furthest from the stands. In the closing stages, she produced a strong burst of acceleration to take the lead inside the final furlong and win by a length from Konafa and Kesar Queen. Her winning time of 1:37.83 was 0.26 seconds faster than that set by the colt Wollow in the 2000 Guineas the previous day. Just over a month later, Penna won the Epsom Oaks with Pawneese, a filly he reportedly regarded as Flying Water's superior. Flying Water returned to France and moved up in distance for her next start, finishing sixth behind Riverqueen in the Prix Saint-Alary. During the race, she sustained a chipped bone in one of her feet which ruled her out for the rest of the year and put her racing career in serious doubt. Flying Water eventually recovered after being sent to the United States for an operation. =1977-1978; later career= After a break of more than a year, Flying Water resumed her career by finishing fifth to the three-year-old filly Polyponder in the Prix de la Porte Maillot at Longchamp. In August, she was moved down in distance for the Prix Maurice de Gheest (then a Group Three) over 1300m at Deauville. Competing against specialist sprinters, Flying Water won from Girl Friend, a mare who had won the race in 1976, with Polyponder finishing third to give females a clean sweep of the places. Flying Water returned to Deauville later that month for the Prix Jacques Le Marois, one of France's most important weight-for-age mile races. In a race run at a \\"muddling\\" pace, she showed superior speed in the closing stages to win by half a length from Blushing Groom and Trepan. In September, she ran poorly behind Pharly in the Prix du Moulin, a performance which Penna was unable to explain. On her final European appearance, Flying Water returned to Newmarket for the Champion Stakes in October. Having run poorly in her only previous race over a distance further than a mile (in the Prix Saint-Alary), she was not strongly fancied and started at odds of 9/1. As in her previous start, the filly was suited by a slow pace and accelerated clear inside the final furlong to win by two lengths from the Benson & Hedges Gold Cup winner Relkino. In 1978, Angel Penna moved his training base to the United States, taking many of his horses, including Flying Water, with him. On her second American start, the mare contested a division of the New York Handicap on the turf course at Belmont Park on 25 June. Early in the straight, Flying Water collided with the running rail when moving up to the leaders and fell heavily, throwing her jockey Jean Cruguet. A broken shoulder was diagnosed, and Flying Water was euthanised. Assessment and honours In the first official International Classification, a collaboration between the handicappers in Britain, Ireland, and France, Flying Water was rated the best older female racehorse in Europe in 1977. The independent Timeform organisation concurred, awarding her a rating of 132. In their book A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Flying Water a \\"superior\\" winner of the 1000 Guineas.

It was also a leading case on the freedom of interstate trade and commerce that is guaranteed by section 92 of the Constitution.Commonwealth of Australia Constitution, section 92. Background In 1914 there were rising prices in Australia for various commodities, including wheat, caused by a drought in Australia from 1911 to 1916 and the outbreak of World War I in July 1914. The initial response of the Parliament of NSW was to fix the price of wheat at 4s 2d (4 shillings and 2 pence) per bushel while the then market price was 5 p higher at 4s 7d.. Farmers and merchants refused to sell their wheat at that price and resulted in the Government seizure of wheat stored at railway yards.. By December 1914 the market price in Victoria had risen to 5s 6d. The NSW Parliament passed the Wheat Acquisition Act 1914 to compulsorily acquire wheat in NSW and for varying or cancelling contracts for the sale and delivery of wheat, paying a price of 5s per bushel of wheat acquired. The acquisition necessarily prevented the performance of any existing contracts for the sale of wheat in NSW to be exported to another State. In January 1915, the Commonwealth applied to the Inter-State Commission for an order to prohibit the NSW Government and the NSW Inspector-General of Police from preventing the exportation of wheat to other States on the basis that this acquisition infringed the Constitution's guarantee of freedom of interstate trade and commerce. The commission consisted of a chief commissioner, Albert Piddington, who had been briefly appointed to the High Court but resigned before hearing a case, p82. and two laypersons, George Swinburne and Nicholas Lockyer (Comptroller-General of Customs). The Inter-State Commission found that the NSW Wheat Acquisition was invalid and made the order sought by the Commonwealth, with Swinburne and Lockyer finding that NSW had contravened section 92 of the Constitution by compulsorily acquiring wheat which was the subject of contracts for interstate sale and was in the course of interstate transport. Piddington disagreed, holding that the Act was a valid exercise of the power of a State to compulsorily acquire food for the civilian population. NSW appealed to the High Court, challenging the decision not only on the basis that NSW contended that it had not infringed the freedom of interstate commerce, but challenged the very foundation of the Inter-State Commission. The argument was that the Inter-State Commission Act 1912,. was contrary to the separation of powers that was implicit in the Constitution. The argument had its foundation in the structure of the Constitution, where chapter 1 dealt with the Parliament, chapter 2 with the Executive Government and chapter 3 with the Judicature. The Inter-State Commission is not within any of these chapters, instead it is within chapter 4 which deals with finance and trade. The idea that the executive is unable to exercise judicial power has its origins in the 1607 decision in the Case of Prohibitions which held that the King had no right to personally sit as a judge and interpret the law.. The more immediate precursor was the separation of powers under the United States Constitution including the power of the Supreme Court to review whether a law passed by Congress was unconstitutional. Decision The High Court upheld the appeal by NSW on both grounds, the majority deciding that the strict insulation of judicial power was a fundamental principle of the Constitution. All judges held that the compulsory acquisition of all wheat, even though it included wheat that was the subject of interstate trade, did not contravene the freedom of interstate trade that was guaranteed by section 92 of the Constitution. = Judicial power under the Constitution = The High Court held that only a court established under Chapter III of the constitution can exercise the judicial power of the Commonwealth. The Inter-State Commission created by the Inter-State Commission Act 1912 could not exercise judicial power despite the words of section 101 of the Constitution,Commonwealth of Australia Constitution, section 101. because it was set up by the executive and violated the conditions for being a Chapter III court. Griffith CJ noted that under the Constitution a judge of a federal court was appointed for life, while a member of the Inter-State Commission was appointed for a seven-year term and that s73 identified the Inter-State Commission as separate and distinct from a federal court. His Honour held > the functions of the Inter-State Commission contemplated by the Constitution > are executive or administrative, and the powers of adjudication intended are > such powers of determining questions of fact as may be necessary for the > performance of its executive or administrative functions.Wheat case (1915) > 20 CLR 54 at p. 64 per Griffith CJ. Isaacs J considered the use of the word adjudication in section 101 of the Constitution and the related reference in section 73 to \\"judgments, decrees, orders, and sentences\\" of, inter alia, the Inter-State Commission. His Honour found that the separation of powers was a fundamental principle of the Constitution.Wheat case (1915) 20 CLR 54 at p. 88 per Isaacs J. Rich J held that \\"The Constitution draws a clear distinction ‚Äì well known in all British communities ‚Äì between the legislative, executive and judicial functions of Government of the Commonwealth.\\" and that the Inter-State Commission fitted within the executive function, holding that \\"I see no reason why powers of adjudication and administration which may be conferred by Parliament on the Inter-State Commission ... should be any wider in scope than the power conferred upon the Executive by sec. 61. Indeed, one would expect that they might well be something less.\\"Wheat case (1915) 20 CLR 54 at 108‚Äì9 per Rich J. Powers J agreed with Griffith CJ and Isaacs J.Wheat case (1915) 20 CLR 54 at p. 106 per Powers J. Barton & Gavan Duffy JJ disagreed. Barton J held that the Constitution gave the Parliament an absolute discretion as to what adjudicatory or administrative powers it deemed necessary for the Inter-State Commission.Wheat case (1915) 20 CLR 54 at 70 per Barton J. = Freedom of interstate trade and commerce = Griffith CJ held that the power of a State to power to expropriate private property was a power inherent in sovereignty, provided the property was within the territorial limits of the State. Barton J similarly held that a State had the power to expropriate property. While the Act changed the ownership of wheat, it did not prevent the State as the new owner from participating in interstate trade.Wheat case (1915) 20 CLR 54 at 77‚Äì80 per Barton J. Isaacs J held that because all wheat in NSW was treated alike, with no differentiation arising by reason of inter-State trade, there was no interference with interstate trade. > ... while neither States nor Commonwealth can detract from the absolute > freedom of trade and commerce between Australian citizens in the property > they possess, there is nothing to prevent either States or Commonwealth, for > their own lawful purposes, from becoming themselves owners of that property > and applying it, according to law, to the common welfareWheat case (1915) 20 > CLR 54 at 101 per Isaacs J. Gavan Duffy J. said:‚Äî > It is to be observed that sec. 51 (I.) of the Constitution enables > Parliament to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the > Commonwealth with respect to Trade and commerce with other countries, and > among the States.

Significance  The Wheat case sounded the death knell, not only to the Inter-State Commission, but also to the combined function approach to administrative adjudication in Australia. The decision continues to have ramifications for both federal courts and non-judicial tribunals and has been followed in numerous High Court decisions, including *Waterside Workers' Federation of Australia v J W Alexander Ltd where the majority of the High Court held that because the President of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration was appointed for 7 years and not life as required by Chapter 3 of the Constitution, the Court could not exercise judicial powers of the Commonwealth.. * British Imperial Oil Co Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation a power of appeal against an income tax assessment was part of the Judicial power of the Commonwealth which could not be conferred upon a Board of Appeal.. *Silk Bros Pty Ltd v State Electricity Commission (Vict) a power to determine applications by landlords for recovery of premises and providing for the enforcement of the Board's orders were an invalid attempt to confer Judicial power on a body that was not a Federal Court.. *R v Davison a registrar was not an officer of the Bankruptcy Court and a legislative attempt to confer upon a registrar the power of making a judicial order was therefore void.. *R v Kirby; Ex parte Boilermakers' Society of Australia (Boilermakers' case) established the second limb of the separation of powers doctrine in that a Federal court established under Chapter 3 of the Constitution could not exercise executive power of the Commonwealth.. *Re Wakim; Ex parte McNally that while the constitution permitted the Commonwealth to vest jurisdiction in State Courts, it did not permit the States to vest jurisdiction in Federal Courts..

As he asks \\"Why?\\" his life becomes more and more complicated. He sees a lawyer for help in getting people to leave him alone, and is put in contact with a media agent, Fleur Arnaud, whose efforts inadvertently make him more and more famous. When he appears on Fleur's television show, everything he says is twisted into a symbolic statement, and the more he pleads for his privacy, the more famous he becomes. He is told he is causing disruption at his job and is pursued by well-wishers and paparazzi. Others are jealous and resent his \\"success.\\" Fleur and he grow close, though she is having an affair with the manipulative producer of her television program. Martin is now broke, and the TV studio offers him a chance to cash in on his fame. He turns them down. A TV host introduces him to some shady characters who try to get him involved in their activities but he refuses them too. Suddenly the public turns against him. A woman strikes and spits on him in a grocery store, and he is pursued by a mob. Fleur decides to move in with the TV producer. Martin quarrels with her, then falls into despair as he becomes an object of public vilification. He hides out with a drag queen (Philom√®ne) who appeared with him at a talk show. He returns to the studio to ask for help but is treated with contempt by the producer, who does however reveal that Fleur has disappeared.

He tells her to leave, but a passage Philom√®ne reads from the autobiography makes him change his mind and he goes after her. As the film ends, the two seem to be returning to the launch.

The narrative relates that he mounts the monsters, ‚Äúslain heroes,‚Äù he has defeated as trophies on his [gi≈°gigir z]a-g√¨n-na, ‚Äúshining chariot.‚Äù Echoing the number of TiƒÅmat‚Äôs eleven monstrous offspring, (from the En√ªma Eli≈°, whom Marduk had vanquished), Ninurta‚Äôs conquests included * wild bulls he hung on the axle, * captured cows on the cross-piece of the yoke, * a six-headed Wild Ram (≈°eg.SAG-√Ä≈†) on the dustguard, * Ba≈°mu (Sumerian: Usum) on the seat, * Magilum, or \\"ship-locust,\\" on the frame, * the bison Kusarikku (Sumerian: gud.alim) on the beam, * the mermaid Kulianna on the footboard, * ‚Äúwhite substance‚Äù (ga·π£·π£a, gypsumga·π£·π£a CAD g, p. 54.), on the forward part of the yoke, * strong copper (urud√ªurud√ª CAD u pp. 269‚Äì270. n√≠g kal-ga) on the inside pole pin, * the Anzu-bird on the front guard and * the seven-headed serpent (Sumerian: mu≈° sag-imin) possibly Mu≈°ma·∏´·∏´≈´ on another illegible part. He then journeys with his attendants, Udanna, the all-seeing god, Lugalanbadra, the bearded lord, and Lugalkudub, with full battle regalia in a terrifying procession to Nippur. Nusku warns him that he is frightening the gods, the Ananna, and, if he can tone it down a little, Enlil will reward him. In the Ekur, he displays his trophies and booty to the general astonishment of the gods - including his brother, the moon god Sin, father, Enlil, and mother Ninlil. Ninurta then extols his virtues in a long hymn of self-praise in an effort to solicit the establishment of his own cult. On his departure from the Ekur, he is petitioned by the god Ninkarnunna to extend his blessings to the king, perhaps the underlying purpose of the whole poem. The work ends with: d\\"Ninurta dumu mah √©-kur-ra\\" (\\"Ninurta, the magnificent scion of Ekur\\"). The ancient use of the text is uncertain. It may have been recited during some kind of cultic activity, such as the annual transport of the Ninurta idol between the temples, E≈°ume≈°a and Ekur.

Life and work Fromanteel was baptized in Norwich on 25 February 1607. He was the first of five children born to Leah and Mordecai Fromanteel, a wood turner. The Fromanteels were a highly respected Flanders family of the sixteenth century. Following Spanish conquest, members of the family fled across the sea to East Anglia, establishing themselves in Colchester, Norwich, and London.Anita McConnell, \\"Fromanteel, Ahasuerus (bap. 1607, d. 1693)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, online reference Ahasuerus Fromanteel was apprenticed for seven years to a blacksmith, before settling in London in 1629. He began as a crafter of steeple clocks in East Smithfield, near the Tower of London, becoming a member of Worshipful Company of Blacksmiths in 1631. He made lantern clocks with balance wheel escapement, and spring-driven table clocks, and joined the Clockmakers' Guild in 1632. In 1658 Fromanteel were taken before the guild for hiring more apprentices than the rules stipulated, which suggests that the firm was thriving. He developed microscopes and lenses, building on the work of Cornelis Drebbel and Benjamin Worsley in Amsterdam. Fromanteel married Maria de Bruijne in 1631 and together they had eight children of whom four became clockmakers themselves. From birth Fromanteel was involved with the Dutch Reformed church, however he and his wife were rebaptised and formally transferred to the Baptist faith. =Pendulum clocks= Pendulum clock (1657) invented by Christiaan Huygens, later adapted by Fromanteel for sale in England (1658). Exhibit in the Museum Boerhaave in Leiden. In 1657 Ahasuerus's son John Fromanteel began studying pendulum clocks, invented by Christiaan Huygens (1656). Before the invention of the pendulum clock, timepieces were accurate to only within ten to fifteen minutes a day. The use of the pendulum made for near frictionless time keeping, ensuring that the mechanism lost measurement of only a few seconds a day: a sixty-fold improvement. It was termed a \\"horological breakthrough\\". This revolution in time keeping could be said to have caused industrial espionage on a grand scale.The Dynamics of Progress: Time, Method, and Measure (2010) Samuel L. Macey, University of Georgia Press, pp11-12 Although claimed by Samuel L. Macey to have caused \\"industrial espionage on a grand scale\\" it has been argued by Theodore M. Porter, that Macey fails to conform with the normal writings associated with history. That Macey can be accused of rambling and quite often losing the point of an argument he is trying to make. Therefore there is not much academic scholarship to be associated with Macey's argument that Fromanteel was guilty of any form of espionage. Following a trip to the Netherlands John and Ahasuerus implemented the new, more accurate pendulum technology. Fromanteel became the first maker of pendulum clocks in England, although this distinction has also been claimed by horologists Richard Harris and Robert Hooke.English Domestic Clocks (1969) Cescinsky and Webster, Taylor & Francis Ltd p285 Precise measurement of time was critical for disciplines including maritime navigation and astronomy. Fromanteel used the design for regulating steeple and domestic clocks and sold them from the family house in Southwark and at the a shop in Lothbury, which had been a famous retailer of clocks for more than a hundred years. The Fromanteel family sold also weight-driven clocks, watches that needed only a single annual winding and a variety of domestic and industrial engines, selling to the city of Norwich one of his patent fire engines. In the Commonwealth Mercury of Thursday 25 November 1658 Fromanteel advertised : > clocks that go exact and keep equaller time than any now made without this > regulator (examined and proved before his Highness the Lord Protector by > such doctors, whose knowledge and learning is without exception) and are not > subject to alter by change of weather, as others are, and may be made to go > a week, a month, or a year with once winding up, as well as those that are > wound up every day, and keep time as well, and is very excellent for all > House Clocks that go either with springs or weights; and also Steeple Clocks > that are most subject to differ by change of weather. Made by Ahasuerus > Fromanteel, who made the first that were in England. You may have them at > his house on the Bankside, in Mosses Alley, Southwark and at the sign of the > Mermaid, in Lothbury, near Bartholomew Lane end, London. He had gained the notice and patronage of \\"The Lord Protector\\", Oliver Cromwell, Britain's interregnum head of state. A popular legend developed that Cromwell himself owned such a clock, however there is little evidence to support this theory.

His son John was left in London to look after the business with Thomas Loomes, a former apprentice, married to Fromanteel's daughter Mary. Following the death of his wife Maria, Ahasuerus Fromanteel wed the widow Sarah Winnock (c. 1660). They lived in Whitechapel, where other of the Fromanteel family were established as silk weavers. Fromanteel died in 1693, and was interred at St Mary Matfelon, Whitechapel, on 31 January 1693. This church was destroyed in the Blitz, and Fromanteel's grave has been lost. A Fromanteel brand-name of clocks and watches exists today, based in the Netherlands.

Works Walton appears to have been a canon of Osney Abbey in 1410, when he completed his verse-translation of the De Consolatione Philosophi√¶ of Boethius. This work was undertaken at the request of Elizabeth Berkeley; she, possibly, was the daughter of Thomas de Berkeley, 5th Baron Berkeley, patron of John de Trevisa, who married Richard de Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick. Boethius's work had already been translated into English prose as Geoffrey Chaucer's Boece, and Walton makes use of Chaucer's version. He refers to Chaucer as \\"the floure of rethoryk\\", and also mentions John Gower. Ten manuscripts of Walton's translation are extant.Including British Library Royal Manuscripts 18 A xiii, which in David Casley's Catalogue was erroneously ascribed to John Lydgate. Other manuscripts in the British Museum are Harleian MS. 44 (which contains numerous marginalia by Thomas Chaundler), Harleian MS. 43, and Sloane MS. 554. There are three copies at Oxford: Balliol College MS. B. 5, Trinity College MS. 75, and Rawlinson MS. 151 in the Bodleian; an eighth copy is in Cambridge University Library (MS.

A standard Boyce MotoMeter fitted together with hood mascot. 1926 Packard Six model 226. The Boyce MotoMeter was patented in 1912, and was used in automobiles to read the temperature of the radiator. From then through the late 1920s, the Boyce MotoMeter Company in Long Island City, New York, founded in 1912 by the German immigrant Hermann Schlaich, manufactured a variety of different models which varied in size and design. The non-pressurized Thermosiphon cooling systems that were widely used until the 1920s led to a low boiling point. The Boyce MotoMeter was a simple and innovative device. For the first time, drivers had information about the engine temperature while operating the car. Sometimes, however, it failed to warn drivers about engine overheating in time to prevent damage. Motometers were at first aftermarket devices. Later, vehicle builders (not only car manufacturers) began to offer them as standard or optional equipment, and dealerships began to offer them, too, sometimes as give-away or incentive items. The MotoMeter Company soon delivered these with metal dials inside that showed the make's or dealer's logo and script printed on it. The standard motometer came in three sizes for small cars, medium cars, and large cars and trucks. There were also slight changes to each of the original models and new designs and accessories like hood ornaments, toppers, illuminating devices or locks were added to the line of meters while some others were discontinued. Toppers are small metal castings that fit to a bracket on the motometer. They were used in a similar way as modern decals showing the vehicle owner's heritage, profession, preferences, or support his business, his preferred sports, or even a political statement.Mascot-Mania: Motometers Gallery; Thumb 1, pic.

It is one of Israel's oldest industrial companies. History Bus built on a Mack Trucks chassis, manufactured by Ha'argaz, 1946 Ha'argaz was founded on August 18, 1932 as a cooperative that produced crates for the citrus industry. The first factory opened on May 1, 1933 on the corner of Salomon and Gaon streets in Tel Aviv. An expert was brought to oversee production of vehicles. On September 15, 1933 another factory was opened in the Neve Shaanan neighborhood. During heavy rains in November 1938, the factory in Neve Shaanan was flooded and workers toiled for hours save the raw materials.http://jpress.org.il/Default/Scripting/ArticleWin.asp?From=Archive&Skin;=TAUHe&BaseHref;=DAV/1938/11/08&EntityId;=Ar00106&ViewMode;=HTML In 1936 a defense plant was established that produced armored and protective vehicle bodies. During World War II the plant expanded and added many full- time employees. It was decided in 1945 to convert to a company half owned by investors and half-owned by a workers cooperative. In 1949, Ha'argaz began to manufacture jerry cans, military helmets and a variety of logistical equipment for the newly established Israeli army. It also collaborated with AMPA, becoming the exclusive import agent for Philco refrigerators from the United States. This collaboration led to the creation of Amcor, a refrigerator and electrical appliance manufacturer. Starting in 2009, the company moved its bus factory from Tel Aviv to an industrial zone near Kiryat Mal'akhi. Today Ha'argaz manufacturers buses for the Egged and Dan bus companies and other private and public transportation companies in Israel. Its crate factory is the second largest in Israel.

They are therefore pnictogen hydrides. Because cyclic hydronitrogens are excluded by definition, the azanes comprise a homologous series of inorganic compounds with the general chemical formula . Each nitrogen atom has three bonds (either N-H or N-N bonds), and each hydrogen atom is joined to a nitrogen atom (H-N bonds). A series of linked nitrogen atoms is known as the nitrogen skeleton or nitrogen backbone. The number of nitrogen atoms is used to define the size of the azane (e.g. N2-azane). The simplest possible azane (the parent molecule) is ammonia, . There is no limit to the number of nitrogen atoms that can be linked together, the only limitation being that the molecule is acyclic, is saturated, and is a hydronitrogen. Azanes are reactive and have significant biological activity. Azanes can be viewed as a more biologically active or reactive portion (functional groups) of the molecule, which can be hung upon molecular trees. Structure classification Saturated hydronitrogens can be: *linear (general formula ) wherein the nitrogen atoms are joined in a snakelike structure *branched (general formula , n > 3) wherein the nitrogen backbone splits off in one or more directions *cyclic (general formula , n > 2) wherein the nitrogen backbone is linked so as to form a loop. According to IUPAC definitions, the former two are azanes, whereas the third group is called cycloazanes. Saturated hydronitrogens can also combine any of the linear, cyclic (e.g. polycyclic), and branching structures, and they are still azanes (no general formula) as long as they are acyclic (i.e., having no loops). They also have single covalent bonds between their nitrogens. Isomerism Azanes with more than three nitrogen atoms can be arranged in various different ways, forming structural isomers. The simplest isomer of an azane is the one in which the nitrogen atoms are arranged in a single chain with no branches. This isomer is sometimes called the n-isomer (n for \\"normal\\", although it is not necessarily the most common). However the chain of nitrogen atoms may also be branched at one or more points. The number of possible isomers increases rapidly with the number of nitrogen atoms. Due to the low energy of inversion, unsubstituted branched azanes cannot be chiral. In addition to these isomers, the chain of nitrogen atoms may form one or more loops. Such compounds are called cycloazanes. Nomenclature The IUPAC nomenclature systematically naming nitrogen compounds by identifying hydronitrogen chains, analogous to the alkane nomenclature. Unbranched, saturated hydronitrogen chains are named with a Greek numerical prefix for the number of nitrogens and the suffix \\"-azane\\" for hydronitrogens with single bonds, or \\"-azene\\" for those with double bonds.Note that \\"-yne\\", which would be used for those with triple bonds, is absent because the only member of that series, N2, is not a hydronitrogen. =Linear azanes= Straight-chain azanes are sometimes indicated by the prefix n- (for normal) where a non-linear isomer exists. Although this is not strictly necessary, the usage is common in cases where there is an important difference in properties between the straight-chain and branched-chain isomers. The members of the series (in terms of number of nitrogen atoms) are named as follows: :ammonia, NH3 \\\\- one nitrogen and three hydrogen :diazane (or hydrazine), - two nitrogen and four hydrogen :triazane, - three nitrogen and five hydrogen Azanes with three or more nitrogen atoms are named by adding the suffix -azane to the appropriate numerical multiplier prefix. Hence, triazane, ; tetrazane or tetraazane, ; pentazane or pentaazane, ; hexazane or hexaazane, ; etc. The prefix is generally Greek, with the exceptions of nonaazane which has a Latin prefix, and undecaazane and tridecaazane which have mixed-language prefixes. Hazards Ammonia is explosive when mixed with air (15 ‚Äì 25%). Other lower azanes can also form explosive mixtures with air. The lighter liquid azanes are highly flammable; this risk increases with the length of the nitrogen chain. Considerations for detection and risk control: *Ammonia is lighter than air (possibility of accumulation on ceilings) Organoazanes The organoazanes are a group of chemical compounds derived from azanes containing one or more organic groups. They are a subset of the general class of organonitrogens, although the distinction is not often made. As with organoamines, organohydrazines are a subsets of organoazanes, derived from ammonia, and hydrazine, respectively. In addition to amines and hydrazines, organoazanes also include compounds such as, hydrazones, imines, nitriles, and nitrosos, but excludes compounds such as, but not limited to azo compounds. Many substituted hydrazines are known, and several occur naturally. Some examples include *monomethyl hydrazine, where one of the hydrogen atoms on the hydrazine molecule has been replaced with a methyl group (CH3). Due to the symmetry of the hydrazine molecule, it does not matter which hydrogen atom is replaced. It is sometimes used as a rocket fuel. *1,1-dimethylhydrazine (unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine, UDMH) and 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (symmetrical dimethylhydrazine) are hydrazines where two hydrogen atoms are replaced by methyl groups. UDMH is the easier of the two to manufacture and is a fairly common rocket fuel. *gyromitrin and agaritine are hydrazine derivatives found in the commercially produced mushroom species Agaricus bisporus. Gyromitrin is metabolized into monomethyl hydrazine. *Isoniazid, iproniazid, hydralazine, and phenelzine are medications whose molecules contain hydrazine-like structures. *2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (2,4-DNPH) is commonly used to test for ketones and aldehydes in organic and clinical chemistry. *phenylhydrazine, C6H5NHNH2, the first hydrazine to be discovered. Related and derived hydronitrogens Related to the azanes are a homologous series of functional groups, side-chains, or radicals with the general chemical formula . Examples include azanyl () and hydrazinyl. This group is generally abbreviated with the symbol N.

Rossano Cathedral (, Cattedrale di Maria Santissima Achiropita) is a Roman Catholic cathedral in Rossano, a frazione of Corigliano-Rossano, Calabria, southern Italy, dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary as Maria Santissima Acheropita. It is the seat of the Archbishop of Rossano-Cariati, and previously of the Bishops and Archbishops of Rossano. History and description The cathedral was built in the 11th century, with substantial reconstruction in the 18th and 19th centuries. It has a central nave and two side-aisles, terminating in three apses. The bell tower and the baptismal font date from the 14th century, while the other artworks and furnishings are of the 17th and 18th centuries. Maria Santissima Acheropita The cathedral houses an ancient image of the Madonna Acheropita, an image of the Madonna and Child supposedly discovered in the cathedral plaster and not painted by human hand, which is dated to somewhere between about 580 and the first half of the 8th century.Arte Rossano Rossano Gospels In the sacristy in 1879 was discovered the Codex Purpureus Rossanensis (\\"Rossano Gospels\\"), a Greek evangeliary of the 5th or 6th century of Middle Eastern origin (probably Antioch), which was probably brought to Rossano by a monk taking refuge from the Arab invasions of the Middle East during the 9th and 10th centuries. The manuscript comprises 188 leaves of parchment dyed purple containing the Gospels of Matthew and Mark and the Epistula ad Carpianum (a letter from Eusebius of Caesarea to a Christian named Carpianus). Although it is mutilated and anonymous, the manuscript is perhaps the most representative testimony of the Byzantine connections of Rossano. The texts are in gold and silver ink, with 15 miniatures showing the most important moments in the life and preaching of Jesus.Museo Diocesano e del Codex, Rossano: Codex Purpureus ] References External links * Website of the Archdiocese of Rossano-Cariati: Cattedrale Maria SS.ma Achiropita * Museo Diocesano e del Codex, Rossano: cathedral Category:Roman Catholic cathedrals in Italy Category:Cathedrals in Calabria Category:Churches in the province of Cosenza ","title":"Rossano Cathedral"},{"id":"36632164","text":"John Breen may refer to: * John Breen (actor), actor in the film Untraceable * John Breen (Australian politician) (1898‚Äì1966), Australian politician * John Breen (playwright), Irish playwright * John Breen (RAF officer) (1896‚Äì1964), senior officer in the Royal Air Force * John Breen (scholar) (born 1956), British Japanologist * John W.

Making her debut with the Tamil-language novel Puhai Naduvil, an acid look at the bureaucracy, she went on to write a number of children's stories, novels, and plays based on the puranas. Her play Manathile Oru Maru was directed by another famous writer of her time, Chitti (P. G. Sundararajan), with whom she shared a strong bond of friendship. Chitti even authored a book titled An Introduction: Krithika and Mathuram Bhoothalingam. Midway through her career, Krithika also started to write in English. As Krithika started to write children's books apart from adult-centric stories, she began using her given name. Krithika was one of the first Indian authors to regularly publish children's books in English. Some of her important works in English are Movement in Stone, which looks at early Chola temples and the influence of Pallava art prior to the 9th and 10th centuries; and, Yoga for Living (1996), a contemporary look at the direction of India.

This acts in response to a disastrous situation that affects or could affect a large group of civilians in Mexico and, in some cases, abroad. It is also known as the 3rd Army mission entrusted to safeguard and protect civilians in case of disaster. This is based on the provisions of the Civil Protection Act, the National Development Plan and the Organic Law of the Mexican Army and Air Force, all under the coordination of the National Civil Protection System (SINAPROC). History Initiated after the World War II on Mexican Army held a number of amendments to a view of turning it into a modern armed force, among the series of actions to implement the strategic plans in order to minimize consequences of different actions that put at risk the national security were the most important. In the 1960s the Army Action Plans were put into force, which are modified in 1966 becoming the Defence Plans of the Secretariat of National Defense, which covered from the case of a foreign war, to the case of a situation disastrous among the population, and establishing the National Defence Plan No. III on September 18, 1965, which introduced Annex E - the Title of Plan to Aid Civilian Disasters known by its initials DN-III-E, nicknamed \\"DN-Three-E.\\" The floods on the P√°nuco River in 1966 led to the first Plan DN-III-E operation to rescue and provide relief to affected residents of the states of Veracruz and Tamaulipas, the nickname of the plan would later be the name of the measures that would prove to be a great success among the Mexican people as the Secretariat of National Defense would, every time a natural or man-made calamity strike the country, mount operations to assist the people in these trying times of disaster, a tradition that continues to this day. After earthquake in Mexico City in 1985 the National Civil Protection System, by which as a response the Secretary of Navy of Mexico reformed the Plan Marina (launched 1968) to cover the coastal areas where it is better equipped to serve the forces of the SEDENA during calamities, were both officially created. Thus, both Secretariats have been since responsible for civil defense and disaster relief and response operations during calamities within the national territory, a role now jointed today by the National Guard. As of September 19, 2017, as a direct result of the 2017 Chiapas earthquake, Plan DN-III-E is in place within the affected areas within southern Mexico, and Army and Air Force units have been deployed to implement the program. They have also been deployed to central Mexico as a result of the September 19, 2017 earthquake to provide disaster relief and support for the victims of this calamity. Disaster Support Force The Support Force for Disasters (FACD) is a permanent body of the Secretariat of National Defense created on February 10 of 2000, consisting of a grouping of land and air units, the Military Engineers, Services Corps, Health Services, Quartermaster Services, which are supported by units composed of final year cadets of the military academies and schools, the Task Force Valley of Mexico and 4 and 5th Light Infantry brigades. On the air arm of its component are helicopters and transport aircraft. All are under the direct command of the Secretary of Defense who will operationally be the head of a Command designated by him for Staff consists of two branches. During such disasters like the hurricane season, earthquakes, flooding, wildfires and landsides and if during major man-made calamities the Secretariat deploys 4 Disaster Engineers Groups (AICD), which are assigned in the cities of Guadalajara, Monterrey, Merida, and Mexico City, with similar equipment, consisting of heavy and light vehicles, rescue equipment, community kitchens and specialized personnel. Alongside them are specialized medical personnel trained in disaster response in the health and medicine sectors, military policemen (including K-9 detachments) and SAR (search and rescue) ready personnel of the Army and the Air Force. During forest fires, Air Force helicopters assist ground forces personnel using firefighting equipment in affected areas, during floods, airborne and waterborne rescue operations are performed by the two service branches. General actions of Plan DN-III-E The Plan DN-III-E is based on six basic points which are: * Search and rescue. * Evacuation of communities at risk. * Management of shelters. * Recommendations to the population. * Protection of the family. * Security and surveillance of affected areas.

Working in 1980-1981 with Gennady Chibisov in the Lebedev Physical Institute in Moscow he predicted the spectrum of inhomogeneities in the Universe, which are originated from the initial quantum fluctuations. The numerous experiments in which there were measured the temperature fluctuations of the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation are in excellent agreement with this theoretical prediction, thus confirming that the galaxies and their clusters originated from the initial quantum fluctuations. Later on V. Mukhanov proved that the results, he obtained with G. Chibisov in 1981, are of the generic origin and he has developed the general consistent quantum cosmological perturbation theory.

The present house was built in the 1980s in Neo-Palladian style, its design being based on Palladio's Villa Rotonda. History Depiction of Henbury Hall in the 1707 Britannia Illustrata A hall known as Henbury Hall existed in the area in the 17th century. A Neoclassical style hall was built on the present site in 1742. It was sold by Sir William Meredith to John Bower Jodrell in 1779 for ¬£24,000 and passed on to his son Francis Bower Jodrell in 1796. John Charles Ryle, the banker and MP for Macclesfield, bought it in 1835 for ¬£54,000 and sold it following his bankruptcy to Thomas Marsland, first MP for Stockport (1776‚Äì1854) in 1842. The hall was remodelled in a more severe Neoclassical style in the early part of the 19th century, and then stuccoed and drastically reduced in size in the 1850s. The estate passed to his grandson Edward Marsland (died 1857) whose widow Jane Marsland was forced to sell after a disastrous flood in 1872. It was bought for ¬£9000 and extensively remodelled by local silk manufacturer Thomas Unett Brocklehurst. In 1876 Brocklehurst reputedly imported a pair of grey squirrels from America and released them into the estate with ultimately disastrous results for the native red squirrel. The Brocklehurst family remained in residence at Henbury for several generations. In 1957 the estate was bought by Sir Vincent de Ferranti. He demolished the existing house and commissioned the architect Harry Fairhurst to convert the stable block for his own residential use. After the death of Sir Vincent in 1980, his son Sebastian and the designer Felix Kelly, who had already been involved with some work on the Henbury estate, came up with the idea of creating a house in the style of a Palladian temple. Kelly executed an oil painting based on Villa Rotonda, a house near Vicenza built in 1552 and designed by Andrea Palladio. Sebastian then commissioned the architect Julian Bicknell to create a design similar to Kelly's painting. The new building was completed in 1986. Sebastian lived there with his wife Naomi, until her death in 2003. Together, they designed the interior with the help of David Milnaric. They also worked together on the gardens. He was married again briefly before his death on 15 October 2015. Architecture The neo-Palladian house (left) and converted stables (right) =Exterior= Henbury Hall is constructed in brick and concrete which is faced with limestone from northeast France, with the roof in local stone. The dome is in lead, with a lantern in gunmetal and gilded copper. It has a plan of square, with four-way symmetry. There is a rusticated basement, and an Ionic portico on each side. A stairway leads up to the south front. Within each portico is a Venetian window. Life-size statues by Simon Verity stand on the pediments. Topping the house is a dome surmounted by a lantern. =Interior= The dining and drawing rooms are on the first floor (second floor in American usage) or piano nobile, on the east and west sides of a central great hall which is open to the dome, with smaller rooms in the corners. In the basement is a central hall surrounded by kitchens and accommodation for the staff. The upper floor has a gallery overlooking the great hall, with six bedrooms with bathrooms and dressing rooms. The great hall has a floor of English limestone and Purbeck marble. The internal decoration is by David Mlinaric, with carving of the doorcases by Dick Reid of York. =Comparison= Although Henbury Hall is based on the Villa Rotonda, there are significant differences. The major difference is that it has a smaller plan, with porticos of four rather than six columns. Venetian windows have been inserted behind the porticos.

It has been inhabited since the time of the Christian kingdom of Makuria. Until the 15th century, it was in a remote area, serving as a retreat for Christians in Nubia. The domed Kulubnarti church, 21-S-1, is the only known example of a Christian center plan building in Lower Nubia. Geography Kulb is located about south of Wadi Halfa. It sits just north of the Dal Cataract, which is situated between the 2nd and 3rd cataracts. There are two districts, one on the left (west) and another on the right (east) banks of the Nile, called Kulb West and East Kulb accordingly. Between them lies the long island of Kulubnarti. Kulb is situated in the stony Batn-El-Hajar region, and is characterized as being a craggy and barren rocky area. History In ancient Egyptian times, Kulb was the southernmost point for metal miners who searched for copper ore and gold for the Pharaohs. During the 4th and 5th Dynasties of Egypt, the Ancient Egyptians quarried from the northern Wadi Allaqi large amounts of copper, leaving rock inscriptions naming Kulb by two officials, \\"Overseer of the metal detector\\" (LMY-r smntyw) and a \\"scribe of the metal detector\\" (S≈† smntyw). They were apparently responsible for the collection of gold, as their titles indicate that the search for raw materials in Nubia was organized as a state enterprise. From the Roman period, the granite mountains of the Batn-El-Hajar separated the area culturally from the Egyptian influenced Upper Nubia. Kulubnarti has been inhabited since about 1100 AD. It was used until the end of the Christian kingdom of Makuria as a retreat for Christians in Nubia. A fortress on the island may have existed even before that time. Excavations The first sketches of the domed church were made in the beginning of the 20th century by the English Egyptologist Somers Clarke, who published his findings in 1912 in Christian Antiquities in the Nile Valley. The domed church was excavated in early 1968 under the direction of James Knudstad. In March 1964, the island was examined and surveyed by Friedrich Wilhelm Deichmann, Erich Dinkler, Peter Grossman, and other members of the German Archaeological Institute Cairo. In 1969 and 1979, William Adams Yewdale led the University of Kentucky team in extensive excavations on the island and on the adjacent mainland. In January‚ÄìFebruary 1967, Dinkler and Grossman excavated in the southern area of the Batn-El-Hajar. This was followed in the years 1968 and 1969 with two excavation campaigns at Kulb, and on the two northern islands of Sunnarti and Turmuki. It was during this excavation that the perimeter wall of the Kulb fort and some building remains were located. Excavations in the area of research showed evidence of prehistoric culture of the A-group to the Islamic period. References * Deichmann, Friedrich Wilhelm & Grossmann, Peter: Nubische Forschungen.

Two of its bells were sold to the church in Jugorje pri Metliki and a smaller bell was stolen. The clock was taken to ≈†trekljevec. The furnishings of the church were looted, and its building stones were crushed and used to repair the roads.

Sir Arthur Dyke Acland, fearful of a breakdown in his health and following the death of his father in 1898.Anne Ockwell, Sir Arthur Acland in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography online, 2004-12 Candidates =Liberals= Acland‚Äôs possible resignation had been spoken of publicly since the summer of 1898 and the local Liberal Association had met in July of that year to discuss the implications.The Times, 6 July 1898 p14 They were reluctant to lose Acland as their MP in view of his standing and record in politics and government but a formal request to him to reconsider his decision to stand down made by Rotherham Liberals The Times, 13 July 1898 p10 fell on deaf ears. However, Acland was willing to delay his resignation to enable the local party to find a suitable replacement and the search began at the end of July.The Times, 20 July 1898 p12 Their choice was William Henry Holland, a 49-year-old textile manufacturer, originally from Manchester where he had had a successful career in local government having been an Alderman on Manchester City Council. He was also formerly MP for Salford North.J J Masonl, William Henry Holland in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography online, 2004-12 =Conservatives= Rotherham was considered a safe Liberal seat. It had been represented by Acland for the Liberals since its creation for the 1885 general election and Acland had always enjoyed comfortable majorities. In fact at the two elections preceding the by-election, a by-election in 1892 when he had to resign on appointment as Vice-President of the Committee of the Council on Education, and the 1895 general election, Acland had been returned unopposed.F W S Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results, 1885-1918; Macmillan Press, 1974 p431 This time however, with the prospect of facing a new candidate, the Conservatives chose to fight. They selected a barrister from York, R H Vernon Wragge, to be their man.The Times, 7 January 1899 p6 The campaign Holland relied heavily on the personal support of the former MP. Acland, although too unwell to campaign on the ground, sent letters of support praising Holland as worthy of the confidence of Liberals and Radicals in Rotherham. Holland also obtained the backing of the local Irish community in view of his support for the question of Irish Home Rule.The Times, 11 February 1899 p12 Wragge leant on the record of the Unionist government and the support by telegram of the prime minister. He also enlisted a number of local MPs and peers to support him at his meetings in the constituency.The Times, 23 February 1899 p6 The result Holland held the seat for the Liberal Party with nearly 60% of the poll but with a reduced majority on the last contested election, the 1892 general election.F W S Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results, 1885-1918; Macmillan Press, 1974 p431 However, the Liberals had been victorious in the country in 1892 and the same tide could not be said to be running through the nation in 1899.

Stacey Ralph Douglas Stacey (born 10 September 1942 in Johannesburg) is a British organizational theorist and Professor of Management at Hertfordshire Business School, University of Hertfordshire, in the UK and one of the pioneers of enquiring into the implications of the natural sciences of complexity for understanding human organisations and their management. He is best known for his writings on the theory of organisations as complex responsive processes of relating.  Biography  Stacey was born in Johannesburg, South Africa to Jack, an English immigrant, and Auriel, a South African of Scottish descent. His father was a welder in the steel industry and his mother was a housewife. He completed school at Jeppe High School for Boys in 1960 and was awarded an NCR Scholarship to study at the University of the Witwatersrand where he pursued the degree of Bachelor of Commerce specialising in law subjects. He had the intention of going on to study further to become a lawyer but in the course of his studies he developed a greater interest in economics. He won the McBride Scholarship to the London School of Economics which enabled him to travel to London in 1964 and complete a Master of Science degree in 1965. This was followed by a PhD which he completed in 1967; the research topic was the construction and estimation of econometric models intended to predict patterns of industrial development. In 1968, he returned to South Africa where he taught applied economics at the University of the Witwatersrand for two years after which he moved permanently to the United Kingdom where he has lived ever since 1970. He took a post in the Commercial Assessment Department of the British Steel Corporation where his main task was forecasting the demand for and prices of a range of steel products. In 1972 he moved to the Corporate Planning Department of the international construction company, John Laing, where he eventually became the manager of the department. He left in 1984 to become an investment analyst at what was to become an investment bank and then in 1985 moved briefly to a management consultancy before taking a position as senior lecturer at Hatfield Polytechnic. This organisation became the University of Hertfordshire in 1992 and in the same year Stacey was appointed Professor of Management, a position which he still holds. He published his first book in 1990 which was on his experience of doing strategic planning and this was followed in 1991 by the first of his books, The Chaos Frontier, which sought to explore the implications of the complexity sciences for management and organisations. Then in 1993, he published Strategic Management and Organisational Dynamics, a textbook which located complexity thinking about strategy and organisations in the wider strategy literature. The textbook is now in its 6th edition. The year 1996 saw the publication of his book Complexity and Organisational Creativity. In the meantime he had embarked on the training programme of the Institute of Group Analysis in London, qualifying as a group psychotherapist in 1998 and becoming a member of that Institute and of the Group Analytic Society. He ran clinical therapy groups at a local hospital until about 2004. Also in 1995 he set up a group supervision of PhD students and it was through this activity that he met Patricia Shaw and Doug Griffin as their PhD supervisor. They became friends and colleagues and together they developed the theory of complex responsive processes of relating as a way of understanding human organisations and their management. The collaboration between the three had a major impact on what Stacey was writing so that there is a radical shift in his way of thinking from a systemic approach prior to 2000 to a responsive processes approach in 2000 and thereafter. Together, in 1995, they set up the Complexity and Management Centre as a research centre at Hertfordshire University with Stacey as its director. Also in 2000, Stacey, Griffin and Shaw established the Doctor of Management programme at Hertfordshire Business School and Stacey took the role of its director until 2011 when he was succeeded by Professor Chris Mowles, although he continues his involvement as research supervisor. The programme is still running and has produced 58 graduates from many different countries.  Work  There are two phases in the work of Stacey but the driving questions remain the same in both of these phases. Having been educated in econometrics and having spent years in the corporate planning functions of commercial enterprises his driving questions had to do with why leaders, policymakers and managers in all organisations are so bad at forecasting the consequences of their actions and why, given the frequently surprising and often unwanted consequences of their actions, they carry on with strategic planning processes. If they do not accomplish what they accomplish through their plans then what is it that they are actually doing to accomplish what they accomplish? These questions made it natural for Stacey to respond to the emerging complexity sciences. During the first systemic phase of his work he applied first chaos theory and then the models of complex adaptive systems to organisations and management arguing that organisations are complex adaptive systems and that the patterns in the actions of organisations, which are their strategies, emerge unpredictably in self organising processes. Leaders, policymakers and managers are bad at forecasting because it is impossible to predict the consequences of actions, a conclusion supported by the complexity sciences. Management is not the rational, analytical decision-making it is made out to be but a fundamentally political process. In an attempt to integrate mainstream management theories with the notion of organisations as complex adaptive systems he presented a diagram which expresses a contingency theory of organisations in which the appropriate forms of decision-making and control depend upon the nature of the change situations faced. This diagram became known as the Stacey Matrix and has been frequently adapted by other writers, often in ways not consistent with Stacey's original. However, in moving to the second, responsive processes phase, of his work he dropped the diagram and now argues against its use because it is easily interpreted in a way that collapses the paradox of certainty and uncertainty and so sustains the dominant discourse on management while using an alternative jargon of complexity. The second phase of Stacey's work reflects collaboration with Doug Griffin and Patricia Shaw. This phase drops the application of complex adaptive systems to organisations, arguing that it is invalid to simply apply the natural sciences to human action. Instead, the complexity sciences are regarded as a source domain for analogies and when these analogies are transferred to the domain of human action they need to be interpreted in a manner that takes full account of the attributes of human agents, namely, that they are conscious, self-conscious, emotional, often spontaneous, often thoughtful and reflective beings who have some degree of choice over what they do. Human agents are basically interdependent, they respond to each other and their choices and intentions play into each other producing unpredictable, emergent patterns over time. To signal the move from the domain of the natural sciences to the domain of human action, Stacey and colleagues refer to these processes as complex responsive processes of relating. These responsive processes take the form of: * communication understood, drawing on George Herbert Mead, as conversation; * patterns of power relations which take the form, drawing on Norbert Elias, of the dynamics of inclusion-exclusion and identity; * ideology as a combination of values and norms, drawing on the work of Hans Joas, William James and John Dewey; and * evaluative choices. It is in these local responsive processes that there emerge population-wide patterns of activity, culture and habitus. Organisational life is thought of as the game people are invested in and organising processes are understood to be the ordinary politics of everyday life.

Mileikowsky's grandson is Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.  Biography  Mileikowsky was born in 1879 in Kreva, Russian Empire (today located in Belarus), which at that time was part of the Pale of Settlement region of Imperial Russia in which permanent residency by Jews was allowed. Mileikowsky's father, Zvi, made a living from leasing an agricultural estate in a nearby village. At the age of 10 Mileikowsky was sent to the Volozhin yeshiva, where he spent eight years and was ordained. Already while Mileikowsky attended yeshiva he began to make speeches and lectures and was in contact with the Zionist activist Yehuda Zvi Ibzarov who encouraged him to engage in this field. At the age of 20 Mileikowsky began promoting Zionism in the Siberia region, following a request to do so by the Zionist leader Yechiel Chlenov. In the following years Mileikowsky continued to engage in Zionist promotion and in addition gave speeches against the \\"Bund\\" movement and against other socialist Jewish anti- Zionist movements. During the sixth Zionist Congress Mileikowsky was among the opponents of the Uganda Programme, despite belonging to the Theodor Herzl camp. In 1908 Mileikowsky moved to Poland and became the director of the Hebrew Gymnasium of Mordechai Yaakov Krinsky in Warsaw, while continuing to promote Zionism in Poland. He went through hundreds of towns and was considered one of the most popular Zionist speakers. In 1912 Mileikowsky moved to ≈Å√≥d≈∫, and served as a Maggid in the Zionist synagogue \\"Beth Jacob\\". He used to deliver his sermons in Hebrew, an uncommon practice at that time. In 1913 the Hebrew newspaper Ha-Tsefirah reported about a major event held in Lodz organized by the members of the Mizrachi movement. The report mentioned also the \\"excellent speech\\" made by Rabbi Mileikowsky, which was carried partly in Hebrew and partly in Yiddish.◊ó◊ú◊ï◊ü ◊õ◊™◊ë◊î According to his son, Benzion Netanyahu, the Mileikowsky family was one of the few families in the world who spoke Hebrew at that time. In 1914 Mileikowsky was appointed rabbi of the city Rivne, but following World War I he remained with his family in Lodz. In 1920, Mileikowsky immigrated to Mandatory Palestine with his wife and nine children, and became the director of the school \\"Vilkomitz\\" in Rosh Pina. During this period he published various articles in the Hebrew press promoting the Jewish settlement of the Galilee region. On some of the articles he published he signed under the name \\"Netanyahu\\", a surname his sons adopted.◊ó◊ú◊ï◊ü ◊õ◊™◊ë◊î In 1924 he moved with his family to Jerusalem, and during that same year he traveled to England on behalf of Menachem Ussishkin in order to raise funds for the Jewish National Fund and Keren Hayesod. Following the success of these campaigns he was sent to the United States on behalf of the Jewish National Fund. Mileikowsky's numerous speeches made a strong impression on the American Jewish community. In 1926, the newspaper \\"Dos Yiddishe Folk\\" reported that the American Zionist Rabbi Mileikowsky lectured in 700 lectures through nine months. Once a year Mileikowsky used to visit Palestine. In 1928 Mileikowsky published several of his speeches in the book Nation and State (Hebrew: ◊¢◊ù ◊ï◊û◊ì◊ô◊†◊î). On the eve of the 1929 Palestine riots Mileikowsky returned to Palestine, purchased land in Herzliya in which he built up a farm, and in addition he was active in the Hitahdut HaIkarim settlement movement for private farmers. After the assassination of Haim Arlosoroff in 1933, Rabbi Mileikowsky, who was affiliated with the Revisionist movement, took part in the establishment of a public committee, headed by Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook, which protected those accused of Arlosoroff's assassination‚Äînamely, Zvi Rosenblatt and Abraham Stavsky. Rabbi Mileikowsky argued that the evidence indicated that they did not commit the assassination and that their execution could lead to a civil war, which would harm the Zionist enterprise. Rabbi Mileikowsky died in Jerusalem on February 4, 1935, and was buried in the Mount of Olives Cemetery. Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook referred to Mileikowsky in his eulogy as a \\"divine speaker\\". The square most adjacent to Israel's national cemetery in Mount Herzl is named after Nathan Mileikowsky.  Family  Nathan and his wife Sarah Mileikowsky (n√©e Lurie) had nine children, including: Benzion Netanyahu (the father of Iddo, Yonatan and Benjamin Netanyahu) and Elisha Netanyahu (the husband of Shoshana Netanyahu and the father of Nathan Netanyahu).

He competed with Stuart Bithell at the 2012 Summer Olympics, and the team won a silver medal. Personal life Patience was born on 4 August 1986, in Aberdeen, Scotland. Sailing Patience and Stuart Bithell were selected to compete for Great Britain at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, United Kingdom in the men's 470 class ahead of Chris Grube and Nick Rogers. heading into the final race of the event the pair were guaranteed at least a silver medal but had to beat the leading Australian crew of Mathew Belcher and Malcolm Page with a boat between them in order to take gold. Patience and Bithell finished fourth in the race with the Australian's second, meaning they took the silver medal. In December 2012 Patience and Bithell ended their partnership, with Bithell moving to partner Grube in the 49er skiff class. Patience remained in the 470 class and joined up with Joe Glanfield who had previously won silver medals at the 2004 and 2008 Summer Olympics before choosing to retire. They won a silver medal at the 2013 European Sailing Championships behind Sofian Bouvet and Jeremie Mion of France. However, in February 2014, Glanfield again chose to retire. Following Glanfield's retirement Patience joined up with crewman Elliot Willis. In July 2014 they won a gold medal at the 470 European Championship event held in Athens. They also won a silver medal at the test event for the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and finished in fourth place at the 2014 ISAF Sailing World Championships. Based on these results the pair were selected to represent Great Britain at the 2016 Summer Olympics in the men's 470 class. In March 2016 Patience was forced to find a new partner after Willis was diagnosed with bowel cancer and had to withdraw from the Olympics; he teamed up with Chris Grube and had to requalify for the Olympics. They took part in a World Cup event at Hy√®res in France, despite suffering a black flag disqualification in one race they finished tenth overall. In May 2016 Patience and Grube were confirmed as the Great Britain team's entry for the men's 470 in Rio.

Grieg and his wife celebrated their wedding anniversary with Borre and Nancy Giertsen. Nancy was the sister of Marie Beyer, then married to Frants Beyer, Grieg's best friend. She belonged to their closest circle of friends at Troldhaugen. During the occasion a guest book was ready to take contributions from all the guests. Grieg gave the work its final title in 1897 when he compiled Book VIII, Op. 65, of his Lyric Pieces. The work's festive march-like first section, describes congratulations and best wishes that are given by the guests to the newlyweds; the second section is reflective and subdued. Most performances of this piece take about 5-6 minutes, although a recording of Grieg himself playing part of it (above) takes only 2 minutes.

Ljubljana: Znanstvena zalo≈æba Filozofske fakultete Univerze v Ljubljani. History Komolec was a village inhabited by Gottschee Germans. It was one of the oldest settlements on the Koƒçevje Rog Plateau, established after external colonization by German settlers had been completed around 1400. In the Koƒçevje land registry of 1574 Komolec had three full farms that were subdivided into six half-farms. In 1770 the village had 10 or 39 houses. The population of the settlement peaked in 1890, with 162 people living in 30 houses. Agricultural conditions were poor, with a few meadows and pastures, and the economy of the village was primarily based on forestry.Krajevni leksikon Dravske Banovine. 1937. Ljubljana: Zveza za tujski promet za Slovenijo, p. 224. The inhabitants were known for making wooden tubs and wagons. Before the Second World War, the settlement had 23 houses. The original residents were evicted on 23 and 24 November 1941. Italian troops quartered themselves in the abandoned houses on 17 July 1942, but were attacked there by Partisan forces the next day. Komolec was burned by Italian troops during the Rog Offensive in late August 1942, leaving only one house. A base and a warehouse for the staff of the 7th Partisan Corps was established here in 1944. The base was burned in April 1945 during German operations to secure the road from Koƒçevje. Until that time two Partisan hospitals (Mali Ajdovec and Veliki Ajdovec), established in October 1944, also operated in the area. In the 1950s, one house and two barns in Komolec were rebuilt for the needs of a collective farm. Four people were recorded living at the site in 1953 and 1961, but the site was then abandoned and the barns were torn down. A chapel shrine stood at the western edge of the village.

He is the second youngest American to qualify for the title of Grandmaster (after Samuel Sevian), at the age of 14. Liang was twice world champion in his age category.  Career  On April 16, 2011, when he played in the Hales Corners Challenge chess tournament in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Liang became the youngest chess expert in United States Chess Federation (USCF) history with a rating of 2000 at the age of 8 years and 7 days. He broke the earlier record, held by Samuel Sevian, by 64 days. (That record was later broken by Abhimanyu Mishra who became expert at 7 years, 6 months, and 22 days) On August 5, 2011, at the age of 8 years 118 days, he became the youngest to defeat an international master in a standard tournament game. This occurred in round 6 at the U.S. Open in Orlando, Florida, when Liang defeated IM Daniel Fernandez (rated FIDE 2401 and USCF 2448 at that time). The previous record, which was held by Fabiano Caruana, was broken by 4 months and 15 days. On November 27, 2011, he won the gold medal in the Under 8 section of the World Youth Chess Championships in Caldas Novas, Brazil. This win earned him the titles of U-8 world chess champion and FIDE Master. On July 29, 2012, he became the youngest player ever to defeat a grandmaster (GM) in a standard time limit tournament game. It occurred in round 3 of the Washington International in Rockville, Maryland, when he defeated GM Larry Kaufman. Liang was 9 years, 111 days old at the time, breaking the previous record by about 2.5 months.A new record by Awonder. Susan Polgar Chess Daily News and Information. 2012-07-30. Retrieved on 2012-10-11; the record was previously held by Shah Hetul at the age of about 9 years, 6 months. At the same time, Liang broke the USA record for the youngest to win against a GM by 10 months, 9 days; the previous record having been held by Fabiano Caruana. On March 23, 2013, he became the youngest person ever to obtain a master's rating within the United States Chess Federation. While playing in the Midwest Open Team Chess Festival in Dayton, Ohio, his win over a Life Master in round 2 brought his estimated USCF rating to 2206. Liang was 17 days shy of his tenth birthday at the time of this achievement, 10 days younger than the age at the previously existing record (held by Samuel Sevian, 7 days prior to his tenth birthday). On September 2, 2015, Maximillian Lu broke Liang's record by 12 days. At the 2013 World Youth Championships, which took place in Al Ain, Liang won the Under 10 section. On June 30, 2014, at the age of 11 years and 92 days, while competing in the 2nd Annual DC International, he became the youngest American to achieve a norm for the title International Master (IM). Liang earned his third and final IM norm in Dallas on November 25, 2015 at 12 years, 7 months and 6 days old, thus becoming the youngest American ever to qualify for the title of International Master. From July 8 to July 17, 2016, Liang participated in the U.S. Junior Closed Championship at the Chess Club and Scholastic Center of St. Louis, Missouri. Liang achieved a score of 6/9, for second place behind Jeffery Xiong, who won with a score of 6¬Ω/9. He won four games, drew four, and lost one game to Xiong. In May 2017, Liang earned his final two Grandmaster norms in back-to-back tournaments at the Spring Chess Classic in St. Louis (Group B) and the Chicago Open, with the latter won on May 29. He won the former tournament with a score of 7¬Ω/9 and ended up getting 6¬Ω/9 at the latter tournament to share 5th to 9th place. At the time, he became the tenth youngest player ever to achieve the Grandmaster title in chess. On July 17, 2017, Liang won the US Junior Closed Championship with a score of 6¬Ω/9. This earned him a spot in the 2018 US Chess Championship.

Biography He was born in Alcamo, in the Province of Trapani, Sicily, and started his career at Campobello di Mazara in 2005‚Äì06 Serie D: in October 2005 he was signed by another southern Italy side Cosenza, also from Group I. Di Donato was spotted by another Calabria team Vigor Lamezia at the end of season and in July 2008 Serie A club Chievo signed him from Lamezia; he also remained in Lamezia Terme for 2008‚Äì09 Lega Pro Seconda Divisione. In June 2009, Chievo signed Luca Rigoni outright from Vicenza Calcio, however Chievo did not wish to pay anything to Vicenza. Vicenza, instead, signed Di Donato for an exponential ‚Ç¨1 million and Rigoni joined Chievo for ‚Ç¨1 million, which the same fee he left 1¬Ω year ago.Vicenza Calcio SpA Report and Accounts on 30 June 2009 The deal was more a pure financial trick than a logical sports decision. (in fact in Italian accounting, Vicenza Calcio already booked the transfer revenue of ‚Ç¨2 million instead of ‚Ç¨1 million in 2007‚Äì08 financial year (closing on 30 June each year), as another half as special co-ownership asset. if the remaining 50 per cent sold below the accounting price, the club would have had financial cost in that financial season). Thus, Rigoni was sold under the previous accounting price of ‚Ç¨1M; and in accounting the transfer fee for the new signing (Di Donato) was amortized proportionally to player contract (5-year), which the supposed ‚Ç¨1 million loss in 2008‚Äì09 now extended to ‚Ç¨200,000 a season from 2009 to 2014 and zero in 2008‚Äì09, but deducting wage (which Vicenza saved a season by lending) and VAT. Moreover, Chievo also booked an exponential player profit on Di Donato in 2008‚Äì09 accounts. On 1 August 2009 Di Donato was farmed to Valenzana along with Alessandro Lorello, however, he ran out of potential and only played 3 times. Di Donato had to play for the reserve in the second half of the season. On 1 July 2010 he returned to Vicenza and became a ghost player. Vicenza would have suffered a great loss if they immediately write-down his flopped value on 1 July 2010 (‚Ç¨800,000). Instead, Di Donato remained on the balance sheet (and balance sheet only) for another year.

As professor in European art history from the Osteuropa-Institut, Frey was wined and dined by the Polish art experts numerous times in late 1930s. He prepared a meticulous list of the most valuable paintings at the National Museum, Warsaw among other locations across Poland. He showed up at the Museum again in October 1939 with the Gestapo, after the capitulation of the Polish capital, and directed the SS-Untersturmf√ºhrer Theo Daeisel to art pieces that needed to be seized and shipped to Germany first, including the Portrait of a Young Man by Rembrandt from the collections of the ≈Åazienki Palace (Pa≈Çac ≈Åazienkowski), and numerous other masterpieces including paintings by Bernardo Bellotto called Canaletto. The items stolen from the National Museum included 99% of all coins, 100% of historic clocks, 80% jewellery, 63% fabrics, 60% furniture, and 70% ancient manuscripts. The Gestapo headquarters in Warsaw presented the Rembrandt as a gift to Hans Frank in occupied Krak√≥w. Frey moved to Krak√≥w the same month, along with his colleague from the SS, dr Joseph M√ºhlmann. Together, they pinpointed all sorts of treasures at Wawel (architectural detail notwithstanding), directing Frank in a mass looting campaign. On Frey's advice, even the fireplaces were ripped out from the walls. Crates from the National Museum, Krak√≥w packed for shipment to Germany Career Frey studied architecture in Vienna at the Technische Hochschule, and in 1911 obtained a job at the Austrian monument conservation bureau. In 1929 he published his controversial book about the Late Middle Ages and in 1931 moved to the Weimar Republic to teach art history in Breslau (Wroc≈Çaw). After the invasion of Poland, he was selected by Berlin to validate Poland as a \\"Teutonic land\\" deliberately with no mention of Jews whatsoever. In 1941 he wrote his infamous book Krakau (German for Krak√≥w) ‚Äì denying this ancient Polish capital its Slavic origins. In 1942 he wrote a guide to the city of Lublin \\"without\\" Jews. After the war, Frey moved back to Vienna and worked at the municipal office for the restoration of relics. In 1951 he moved to Stuttgart in southern Germany, where he obtained the position of professor at a local polytechnic. Frey never faced justice for his crimes committed in German occupied Poland.

Its primary purpose was to provide hot meals to the crews of the many minor landing craft not fitted with galley facilities. Constructed of steel, this shallow-draft lighter had storage and serving space to feed 900 men for one week. The kitchen capacity was able to provide 1,600 hot meals and 800 cold meals a day. Origins In early 1942, the Royal Navy found itself in need of much greater landing capacity in order to provide lift for the Allied 1942 and 1943 invasion plans; Round Up and Sledgehammer. The landing craft construction programme in Britain was incapable of providing sufficient craft so quickly, and US production had not yet come into full swing. Thames lighters were drafted into service to supplement the purpose-built landing craft. Thames lighters were known for their shallow draft and hold capacity, and they were soon fitted with some modest armour protection, engines, and ramps. These landing barges were not intended for the initial assault, but to support the following build-up. Design Gordon Holman, referring to the Landing Barge, Kitchen as an LCK, described it as having \\"the appearance of a houseboat which somebody had attempted to turn into a factory. Chimneys, with square cowls on them, rose up from all parts of the vessel. But when the L.C.K. made smoke nobody complained.‚ÄùHolman, p. 129. The LBK was meant to be a floating kitchen.Buffetaut, p. 157 It had oil-fired ranges, automatic potato peelers, refrigerated meat lockers,War Illustrated, p. 251 four ovens in the aft end of its kitchen space, storage for bulk and perishable goods forward, and a 10-ton fresh water storage tank housed in the hold with additional fresh and sea water tanks above decks.Ladd, p. 54. It could hold sufficient provisions to feed 900 men for a week.ONI 226 The LBK's overall dimensions were 79 feet long, by 21 feet wide. The hull was built of steel (as was the superstructure), with a swim (overhanging) hull at bow and stern. It had all the proportions of a Thames lighter; a broad-beamed, shallow draft (3¬Ω ft.), flat-bottom, and was generally built for wear and tear. In a deck-level overview, from bow to stern, the LBK had a blunt rounded prow directly behind which stood two hand winches and just further aft a hatch to the under-deck level. Within 20 feet the hull had achieved its full width of 21 feet. The foremost section of the deckhouse contained the 17-foot, 6-inch servery area (approximately 16-foot width), where the cooked food was portioned into containers for distribution. The middle section of the deckhouse was the 25 foot galley (approximately 16-foot width). Accommodation for the one officer aft, over the engines. At deck level aft was the steering shelter which, along with the various fuel tanks, was provided with 2.5-inch plastic armour. In a below deck-level overview, from bow to stern, the LBK had a port and a starboard coal bunker, and then, on the portside, a ratings‚Äô washroom. To starboard were two toilets or heads which, having no lower venting to the sea, required emptying by the crew. In the after section of the hull the two Chrysler 65 bhp \\"Royal\\" six-cylinder marine petrol engines gave the LBK a maximum speed of 6‚Äì7 knots.War Illustrated, p. 251 The estimated endurance was 300 miles at 5 knots on 600 gallons of petrol carried in tanks fitted in the after peak. A total of ten vessels were fitted out as kitchen barges, while similar lighters were converted to oil (LBO), water (LBW), and engineering (LBE) barges to support the requirements of the small craft of the invasion fleet. Manning the LBK Soon after the initial campaigns of the war, the Royal Navy‚Äôs landing craft and barges were normally crewed by hostilities-only ratings, personnel of the Royal Naval Patrol Service, and officers and ratings of the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve (RNVR).Saunders p. 11Maund, p. 101 Approximately 43,500 hostilities-only and 5,500 RNVR officers and ratings crewed the various landing craft types in 1944.Ladd 1976, p. 20 Of these, the Royal Canadian Navy provided 60 officers and 300 ratings, on the condition that they be formed into specifically Canadian companies.Training In Small Landing Craft Operations combinedops.com None of the LBKs were manned by RCN crews, however. The Royal Marines also provided landing craft crews, but also none crewed LBKs. Although some other Landing Barge types were manned by Royal Army Service Corps water transport units, all of the LBKs were manned by the Royal Navy personnel.Ladd, p. 55 Crew complement was 24 or 25 men, including the officer commanding. These officers were midshipmen or sub-lieutenants. The ratings included thirteen cooks, nine seamen and three stokers. The senior cook might be a chief petty officer, but, at the beginning of the Normandy invasion, the majority of the crews would not have had much sea experience. As the LBKs' duties involved long periods moored, and the cooking staff were often fully employed making meals, the seamen were often drafted in as ‚Äúspud bashers‚Äù. Service history Landing Barges, Kitchen were present in all invasion areas in the Normandy landings. Each barge had storage and serving space for enough provisions to feed 900 men for one week. The kitchen capacity was able to provide 1,600 hot meals and 800 cold meals a day. The menu could include roast beef, Yorkshire pudding, roast pork or cottage pie, cabbage or peas, and baked potatoes or roast potatoes, followed by stewed apples or other fruit and custard. These meals were placed in heat-retaining containers (insulated tin canisters) for dispatch to the crews of small craft. Also accompanying these containers would be one gallon \\"safari jars\\" (vacuum flasks) of soup, coffee, or tea. Among the craft thus supplied would be LCMs, special variants of the LCVP, and supply and repair barges. Larger craft would likely have galleys of their own and LCAs and LCVPs generally had mother ships where LC crews would be fed. LBK also supported coastal and landing craft flotillas during the Battle of the Scheldt.

It was made available as a crowdfunded paid alpha pre-order on September 25, 2012 with updates scheduled every three to four weeks. With over 2,000,000 copies sold, Prison Architect made over in pre-order sales for the alpha version. Prison Architect was an entrant in the 2012 Independent Games Festival. The game was available on Steam's Early Access program, and was officially released on October 6, 2015. On January 8, 2019, it was announced that Paradox Interactive had acquired the rights to Prison Architect for an undisclosed sum. Gameplay The game is a top-down 2D (with a partially 3D mode) construction and management simulation where the player has been hired by the CEO of a for-profit prison company to take control of building and running a prison. The player's role is of both architect and governor with sandbox micromanagement themes, where he is responsible for managing various aspects of their prison including building facilities, connecting utilities, and managing staff. The player needs to recruit specific staff to unlock some aspects of the game (e.g. information about the prison's finances is unavailable without an accountant). The player is also responsible for the finances of their prison, and for meeting the needs of their prisoners (e.g. sanitation). The player is also able to implement various reform and labour programmes that reduce the specific prisoner's recidivism rate. The player tells the prisoners what to do indirectly by setting their schedule. The game takes inspiration from Theme Hospital, Dungeon Keeper, and Dwarf Fortress. The player can also allow additional conditions to be applied to their game (such as simulated temperature, gang activities and more extreme weather conditions) to increase the difficulty of the game and to simulate a prison in conditions nearer to reality. A player's prison is graded by an in-game report according to various factors, such as recidivism rate of prisoners that have left the prison, overall happiness, violence levels within the prison, et cetera. Prisoners are also ranked according to five different classes in the base game: Minimum, Medium, Maximum, Supermax Security prisoners as well as Death Row prisoners; each different class corresponds to a different temperament and length of sentence. Death Row prisoners arrive with a 'clemency' gauge, expressed as a percentage. This percentage can be lowered with successive failed Death Row Appeal sessions; below a certain percentage, the prisoner can be executed without legal backlash to the facility regardless of the innocence of the prisoner. Should the Death Row prisoner pass an appeal, he may be released from the prison or transferred into the general prison population. Players may also opt to build a female prison, which necessitates the construction of nursing and childcare facilities for female inmates that are pregnant or are accompanying an infant. Players can be 'fired' by the CEO by reaching a Failure Condition, and the player is then prevented from further managing that prison. Failure Conditions include: # Riot ‚Äî the prison suffers a prolonged and bloody riot, necessitating the intervention of the National Guard # Bankruptcy ‚Äî the prison has a negative bank balance and a negative cash-flow, and is unable to improve its financial situation within 24 hours # Deaths ‚Äî the prison sees twenty deaths in a single in-game day, and then experiences a further five fatalities on the next day # Escapes ‚Äî the prison sees twenty prisoner escapes in a single in-game day, and then experiences a further five escapes on the next day # Warden Deaths ‚Äî the prison sees too many Warden fatalities # Re-offending Paroles ‚Äî too many of the prisoners released on parole often re-offend # Wrongful Executions ‚Äî the prison executes too many Death Row inmates with a 'clemency' rate above that stipulated by the State, who are later found to have been innocent or suitable for transfer to the general prison populace The first \\"official\\" (non-beta) release introduced an expanded story mode as a tutorial as well as an escape mode which casts the player as a prisoner with the goal of escaping, while causing as much trouble as possible. With the addition of the Psych Ward DLC, players are given the option to house criminally insane prisoners, and build relevant facilities to meet their needs (such as padded cells), and hire additional personnel needed to keep them in check, such as orderlies and psychiatrists. Additionally, regular prisoners may become criminally insane when they experience excessive punishment or when their needs are not regularly met (such as lack of access to food or sanitation). Development Prison Architect was developed by British video game studio Introversion Software. The game was announced in October 2011, shortly after Introversion postponed the development of their bank heist simulator game Subversion. The game was first made available on September 25, 2012 as an Alpha version. The game was then crowdfunded with pre-orders, making over in two weeks with close to 8,000 sales. Developer's co-founder Mark Morris explains that independent crowd-funding has allowed them to have no time limit on the Alpha version, as well as no fees associated with crowd-funding platforms. As of December 2013, the developers have raised over . Introversion Software announced that a mobile version of the game was in development and the PC version of the game officially launched on October 6, 2015. In Introversion's alpha 30 video, they confirmed Prison Architect was coming to iOS and Android in October 2015 with the game's official release. The developers posted a tweet on March 21, 2013, that \\"I guess Prison Architect won't be coming to iPad then! Your loss Apple\\", with a link to a Pocket Gamer article. It was later revealed by the developer that the original direct port did not impress Apple. Due to the concern of it might not be featured on App Store's front page the project was set aside for a while. The effort to bring Prison Architect to mobile devices was resumed by Paradox Interactive as the publisher and co-developed with Tag Games. The tablet version for iPad and Android tablets was launched on May 25, 2017. Introversion announced on January 20, 2016 that Double Eleven would be bringing the game to Xbox 360, Xbox One and PlayStation 4 platforms. The console versions were released on June 28, 2016. The Xbox edition of the game was released to subscribers to Xbox Live under the Games With Gold program in September 2018. On June 6, 2017, Double Eleven released a trailer for an expansion pack to Prison Architect, named Psych Ward, on their YouTube channel. Psych Ward was later released on Steam on November 21, 2017. As of September 2018, the latest version is Update 16, released on September 4, 2018. Officially introducing multiplayer mode to the game, it allows up to 8 players to cooperatively build and manage a prison. This was later reduced to 4 players in an update to multiplayer in December 2018. Reception Upon its full release, the game received positive reviews, scoring 83 out of 100 on review aggregator site Metacritic. IGN awarded it a score of 8.3 out of 10, saying \\"Prison Architect is one of the most in-depth, satisfying builder games in ages, if you can get past the initiation.\\" On April 7, 2016, Prison Architect won the 2016 BAFTA award in the Persistent Game category.BAFTA - Games in 2016 Prison Architect was also nominated for the 2016 BAFTA award in the British Game category, which was won by Batman: Arkham Knight.

She served during both the American Revolutionary War and the French Revolutionary War, before the Navy sold her in 1802. Vulture is perhaps best known for being the warship to which Benedict Arnold fled on the Hudson River in 1780 after unsuccessfully trying to betray the Continental Army's fortress at West Point, New York to the British. Career Vulture was commissioned in April 1776 under Commander James Featios. She then sailed for North America on 9 September. On 5 May 1779, Vulture and shared in the proceeds of the capture of General Gates. General Gates was a Massachusetts privateer brig or schooner of eight guns and 40 men, under the command of Captain William Carleton. Hope took General Gates into Halifax where she was condemned and sold.American War of Independence at Sea - Granville Hough's list of ships: General Gates. On 29 May 1779, Vulture was part of Admiral George Collier's small flotilla that sailed up the Hudson River and captured Stony Point, two months later the site of the American victory in the Battle of Stony Point. After dark, Collier sent Vulture and the galley further up the river past Fort Lafayette to prevent the Americans from escaping by water, in which task the British were successful. Vulture shared with Iris, , and in the proceeds from the capture on 21 April 1780 of the American privateer General Reed. Vultures captain at the time was Andrew Sutherland. General Reed was a Philadelphia brig armed with 16 guns, with a crew of 120 men under the command of Samuel Davidson. The highpoint of Vultures career occurred in the Action of 21 July 1781. Vulture was one of three Royal Navy ships and two armed vessels escorting a convoy of 13 unarmed merchant vessels carrying coal. The escorts comprised frigate Charlestown, the two sloops Vulture and , the armed transport Vernon, and Jack, another small armed ship. Vernon was carrying troops from the 70th Regiment of Foot, who were to work in the coal mines. Two French frigates Astr√©e (38), commanded by La P√©rouse, and Hermione (34), commanded by Latouche Tr√©ville, attacked the convoy. The French severely damaged Charlestown, which lost her mainmast and a number of her officers, including Captain Francis Evans. The French also significantly damaged Jack, which also lost her captain, and subsequently struck her colors. The engagement ended at nightfall. Captain Rupert George of Vulture led the damaged escorts into a safe harbor. Six French sailors were killed. Among the British, Captain Evans and seven sailors were killed, 14 were wounded on Charlestown. Vulture had one man killed and two wounded, and Vernon had six killed and seven wounded.Lloyd's List 21 September 1781, ‚Ññ1304. Engagement at Teller's Point (1780) The Vulture is famously remembered as the warship upon which American traitor Benedict Arnold escaped. But it is also the same ship that brought British spy Major Andre to Haverstraw Bay and later abandoned him there due to an exchange of fire with two American soldiers, John \\"Jack\\" Peterson and Moses \\"George\\" Sherman.The engagement took place at a spot called Teller's Point on September 21 and 22.

After her service on the North American Station, Vulture was paid off at Portsmouth in November 1783. At that time she received copper sheathing, but was laid up. In May 1790, Lieutenant Timothy Bird commissioned Vulture as a storeship. Lieutenant Samuel Short recommissioned her as slop ship in April 1791, but she was not fitted for that role until December 1792. Lieutenant William Crosbe recommissioned her that month.

Its primary mission was to support Chemical Weapons testing in the Bushnell area and as an emergency airfield for the Army Air Force School of Applied Tactics fighter training school at Orlando Army Air Base.

The Withlacoochee airfield was used by the CWS Unit as a landing strip for the planes used in the field trials at Withlacoochee Bombing & Gunnery Range. Several military herbicides for defoliation and crop destruction were tested at the airfield. After World War II ended, the airstrip was abandoned and apparently has not been used ever since.

In a racing career which lasted from September 2008 and October 2009 she ran six times and won three races. After winning one minor race as a two-year-old she won the Classic 1000 Guineas at Newmarket Racecourse on her first appearance in 2009. She then won the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot and was placed in both the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood and the Sun Chariot Stakes at Newmarket before being retired at the end of the season. Background Ghanaati is a \\"big, strong\\", dark-coated bay mare bred by her owner, Hamdan Al Maktoum's Shadwell Farm at Lexington, Kentucky. Her dam, Sarayir won three races, and as a daughter of the mare Height of Fashion, was a sister of Nashwan, Unfuwain and Nayef. In addition to Ghanaati, Sarayir produced the Cumberland Lodge Stakes winner Mawatheeq. As a descendant of the 1000 Guineas winner Highclere, Ghanaati is also closely related to the Japanese champion Deep Impact. Ghanaati's sire, the 2000 European Horse of the Year Giant's Causeway has, as of 2012, sired the winners of more than 20 Group One/Grade I races and more than ¬£5,000,000 in prize money. He was Leading sire in North America in 2009 and 2010. Ghanaati was trained by Barry Hills at Lambourn and ridden in five of her six races by her trainer's son Richard. The filly's name is Arabic and means \\"my love\\". Racing career Ghanaati began her racing career on the Polytrack surface at Kempton Park in the autumn of 2008. On her debut in September, she started slowly before finishing third in a seven furlong maiden race. Five weeks later, racing over the same course and distance, Ghanaati started 4/6 favourite for a similar event. After starting slowly again, she recovered to take the lead in the straight and drew clear to win very easily by six lengths. Ghanaati did not race as a three-year-old before contesting the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket on 3 May. She was not considered a major contender and started at odds of 20/1 in a field fourteen fillies with Rainbow View being made the 8/11 favourite. Richard Hills positioned the filly among the leaders from the start before going to the front in the final quarter mile. Ghanaati quickly went clear and was not seriously challenged, winning by one and a half lengths from the Irish-trained Cuis Ghaire. The previously unbeaten Rainbow View finished fifth, with her connections claiming that she was unsuited by the exceptionally firm ground. The winning time of 1:34.22 was a record for the race and was 1.66 seconds faster than that recorded by Sea the Stars in the 2000 Guineas over the same course and distance the previous day. Shortly after the race Barry Hills became seriously ill with blood poisoning and the day-to- day supervision of Ghanaati's training was taken on by his son Charlie Hills. On 19 June Ghanaati was matched against the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches winner Elusive Wave and the Irish 1,000 Guineas winner Again in the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot. Ghanaati was made 2/1 favourite with Elusive Wave starting at 4/1. The race was an unusually rough one, with several collisions between the horses early in the straight. Ghanaati survived a bump two furlongs from the finish before taking the lead and winning comfortably by two lengths from Raggane. According to the Racing Post she was \\"never in danger\\" and \\"always in command\\" in the closing stages. Her winning time of 1:38.42 was a record for Ascot's round mile course. As her owner felt that she had little to prove against three-year-old fillies, Ghanaati was then tried against colts and older horses in the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood in July. She started 2/1 second favourite but was well beaten and finished third behind Rip Van Winkle and Paco Boy. After the race, Charlie Hills expressed the view that Ghanaati had run well in what was described as a \\"vintage\\" running of the Group One event. Ghanaati was then rested until October when she contested the Sun Chariot Stakes, over the same course and distance as the 1000 Guineas and started 6/5 favourite. She led the race a furlong from the finish but was overtaken and beaten one and a half lengths by the French-trained four-year-old Sahpresa, who recorded the first of her three wins in the race.https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/oct/03/sahpresa-newmarket-sun- chariot-stakes Assessment and honours In the 2009 World Thoroughbred Rankings, Ghanaati was given a rating of 118, making her the seventh highest- rated three-year-old filly in the world. She was the highest rated three-year- old filly over one mile on turf. Stud record At the end of her racing career, Ghanaati became a broodmare for Shadwell Farms.

It is endemic to the Philippines. It used to be considered a subspecies of the Oriental magpie-robin. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical dry forests and subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests. Taxonomy The Philippine magpie-robin was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in 1775 in his Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux from a specimen collected on the island of Mindanao in the Philippines. The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by Fran√ßois-Nicolas Martinet in the Planches Enlumin√©es D'Histoire Naturelle which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon's text. Neither the plate caption nor Buffon's description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name Turdus mindanensis in his catalogue of the Planches Enlumin√©es. The Philippine magpie-robin is now one of 12 species placed in the genus Copsychus that was introduced by the German naturalist Johann Georg Wagler in 1827. It was formerly considered as a subspecies of the oriental magpie-robin (Copsychus saularis) but was promoted to species status based on the results of a molecular phylogenetic study that was published in 2009. The species is monotypic. The genus name Copsychus is from the Ancient Greek kopsukhos or kopsikhos for a \\"blackbird\\". The specific mindanensis comes from \\"Mindanao\\", the type locality.

Starting in 1969, Gilbert taught Junior High School students at various schools around Michigan. This lasted until 1977 when she started to teach at the Alternative Learning Center in Saginaw, Michigan. After 10 years of teaching, in 1979, she devoted her career to plowshare activism. In 1998, Gilbert and four other protesters entered Andrews Air Force Base during the annual Department of Defense Open House and air show. The group banged on a B-52 with hammers and poured their own blood on it. For this, Gilbert spent 6 months in federal prison. In 2000, Gilbert and two other members of her congregation, Sisters Jackie Hudson, O.P., and Ardeth Platte, O.P., illegally entered Peterson Air Force Base and sprinkled blood on a fighter plane. The group was arrested and held in a federal prison until the charges were dropped. In 2002, the same group of Sisters entered a Minuteman III missile silo in Colorado. Clad in white jump suits emblazoned with \\"Citizen Weapon Inspection Team,\\" the group drew a cross in their own blood, banged on the silo, and prayed. The Sisters were arrested and left on the ground for three hours. Their protest spilled over into their pre-trial hearing. Clad in full religious habit, the Sisters answered the judge with a nod. At their trial, the presiding judge, Robert E. Blackburn, granted an in limine motion to the prosecutor. This prevented the Sisters from arguing that their actions were legal under international law and the Nuremberg defense. They were sentenced to between 30 and 41 months in prison. Due to their activism, in 2005 and 2006 Gilbert and Platte were labeled as terrorists by the State of Maryland.

This produced a horizontally scanning signal, which was sent forward by the large rectangular reflector. The Foster scanner, or Variable Path scanner, is a type of radar system that produces a narrow beam that rapidly scans an area in front of it. Foster scanners were widely used in post-World War II radar systems used for artillery and mortar spotting. Modern radars in this role normally use electronic scanning in place of a Foster scanner for this purpose. Description The Foster scanner consists of two parts; a box-shaped antenna and the \\"scanner\\" itself. These are normally placed in front of a shaped reflector. The antenna consists of a thin rectangular section of a parabolic antenna, as if one cut the sides away from a conventional parabolic antenna, leaving only the thin strip where the feed horn is mounted. Rectangular plates are placed on either side of the \\"cut\\", extending forward in the direction of broadcast. The resulting system has the basic size and shape of a large pizza box with the rear side rounded. The feed to the antenna is via a rectangular slot in a waveguide running the length of the box in front of the parabolic section. The scanner itself consists of a section of rectangular waveguide formed into a hollow cone, like an ice cream cone. A second metal cone is placed within the first, leaving a gap between the two that forms a section of waveguide. Small metal \\"teeth\\" at the point where the input waveguide meets the cone causes the radar signal to be reflected 90 degrees into the slot between the two cones. Used alone, this system causes the radar signal to travel a different total path length at the narrow end of the cone as opposed to the wide end. This causes the wavefront of the signal to be rotated with respect to the antenna. The inner cone is not solid, but has a slot cut through the center to form another section of waveguide. Teeth on the outside of this cone pick up the signal from the slot between the cones, reflects it through its center slot, and then a second set of teeth sends it back into the slot between the two cones. The inner cone is allowed to rotate within the outer. As the inner cone rotates, the total signal length changes, more at the wide end than the narrow. When sent to the antenna, this causes the wavefront to scan across the area between the two horizontal plates, \\"snapping\\" to the initial position when the inner cone rotates back to the original point. The scanner allows scans at the rotational speed of the inner cone, which is easily built in a fashion allowing very rapid scanning. Typical angles are +/- 20 degrees. Typical use The Foster scanner was used in a number of post-World War II counterbattery radar systems, the first examples reaching service in the late 1950s and early 1960s. In these systems the scanner was mounted horizontally, in order to produce a signal that scanned back and forth horizontally in front of the radar set. Typical horizontal scanning ranges were between 40 and 50 degrees, with a 1 degree beamwidth. In typical systems, the scanner would be mounted so that it could be quickly pointed at two different vertical angles. This could be accomplished by moving the main antenna reflector behind the scanner, or through a variety of electronic means. The system would rapidly switch the scanner between these two angles, while the scanner itself continued to deflect the signal left and right. The location of the shell horizontally was revealed by the timing of the returned signal compared to the rotation of the scanner at that instant. Using traditional pulse timing methods the range of the shell could be determined at the same instant. Simple trigonometry using the range and the known fixed vertical angle of the beam revealed the shell's vertical location. The time it took to cross one beam and then the other revealed the shell's speed. Early systems included the US AN/MPQ-4, which used lobe switching to switch between two angles about 35 mils apart (about 2 degrees). Reflected signals were displayed on two B-scopes. Measurements from the B-scopes were copied into a ballistic calculator, which produced the X and Y location of the launcher. The UK Green Archer radar used a manual switch to flip between the vertical angles. The radar was normally left in the \\"lower\\" angle setting, while the operator waited for returns. When one was seen the switch was moved to the upper position, and the second return plotted. Ballistic calculation was performed by plotting the two points on an X-Y chart paper, and then moving mechanical cursors over the points. The rest of the calculation was carried out electronically. History The Foster scanner was originally designed by John Stuart Foster while working at the MIT Radiation Laboratory as part of a technical exchange from the Canadian National Research Council. It was quickly adapted for artillery spotting use, particularly for mortars. In this role the scanner would be used to make two or more rapid observations of the shell in flight, and then plotted to calculate the initial position.

That is, it is possible to choose a direction for each edge of an undirected graph , turning it into a directed graph that has a path from every vertex to every other vertex, if and only if is connected and has no bridge. Orientable graphs An ear decomposition of a bridgeless graph. Orienting each ear as a directed path or a directed cycle makes the whole graph strongly connected. Robbins' characterization of the graphs with strong orientations may be proven using ear decomposition, a tool introduced by Robbins for this task. If a graph has a bridge, then it cannot be strongly orientable, for no matter which orientation is chosen for the bridge there will be no path from one of the two endpoints of the bridge to the other. In the other direction, it is necessary to show that every connected bridgeless graph can be strongly oriented. As Robbins proved, every such graph has a partition into a sequence of subgraphs called \\"ears\\", in which the first subgraph in the sequence is a cycle and each subsequent subgraph is a path, with the two path endpoints both belonging to earlier ears in the sequence. (The two path endpoints may be equal, in which case the subgraph is a cycle.) Orienting the edges within each ear so that it forms a directed cycle or a directed path leads to a strongly connected orientation of the overall graph.. Related results An extension of Robbins' theorem to mixed graphs by shows that, if is a graph in which some edges may be directed and others undirected, and contains a path respecting the edge orientations from every vertex to every other vertex, then any undirected edge of that is not a bridge may be made directed without changing the connectivity of . In particular, a bridgeless undirected graph may be made into a strongly connected directed graph by a greedy algorithm that directs edges one at a time while preserving the existence of paths between every pair of vertices; it is impossible for such an algorithm to get stuck in a situation in which no additional orientation decisions can be made. Algorithms and complexity A strong orientation of a given bridgeless undirected graph may be found in linear time by performing a depth first search of the graph, orienting all edges in the depth first search tree away from the tree root, and orienting all the remaining edges (which must necessarily connect an ancestor and a descendant in the depth first search tree) from the descendant to the ancestor. credits this observation to , and credits it to . But as point out, the same algorithm is already included (with the assumption of 2-vertex-connectivity rather than 2-edge-connectivity) in the seminal earlier work of on depth first search. Although this algorithm is not suitable for parallel computers, due to the difficulty of performing depth first search on them, alternative algorithms are available that solve the problem efficiently in the parallel model.. Parallel algorithms are also known for finding strongly connected orientations of mixed graphs.. Notes  References  *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *.

Andersen made his literary debut in 1897 with the historical novel collection I Cancelliraadens dage, a collection of tales from the early 1800s in the Norwegian Uplands. It was received with great enthusiasm and earned him an endowment. The book is commonly viewed as a highlight in Andersen's work. It is regarded a pioneer work of its kind, and has later been analyzed by several literary historians. Among his other works are the poetry collection Digte from 1898, and the novel Mod kv√¶ld from 1900. Between the years 1904-19, he published five collections of narratives and novels including Gamle folk og andre fort√¶llinger (1904), Bispes√∏nnen og andre fortellinger (1907), Hjemf√¶rd (1913) and Fabler og h√¶ndelser (1915). Andersen suffered from various health problems. From adolescence, Andersen suffered from melancholy and depression. In later years he was diagnosed with epilepsy. He died in Gran during 1920. He has been portrayed by painters Henrik Lund, Olav Engebrigtsen and Karl Konow. Sculptor Jens Munthe Svendsen (1869-1957) made a bronze bust of him in 1920. Personal life He was married three times; in 1898 with Margrethe Sch√∏nberg (1871-1901); in 1906 with the author Regine Normann (1867-1939); in 1914 with Margarethe Tichauer (1891-1938).

The Levitt Shell (formerly Overton Park Shell and Shell Theater) is an open-air amphitheater located in Overton Park, Memphis, Tennessee. Elvis Presley gave his first paid concert there on July 30, 1954. The Overton Park Shell was built in 1936 by the City of Memphis and the Works Progress Administration for $11,935, as part of the New Deal. Designed by architect Max Furbringer, it was modeled after similar shells in Chicago, New York, and St. Louis. The WPA built 27 band shells, the Overton Park Shell is one of only a few that still remain. During the 1930s and 1940s, the Shell was the site of Memphis Open Air Theater orchestral shows, along with various light opera and musicals. However, on July 30, 1954, Elvis Presley opened for headliner Slim Whitman, and performed what music historians call the first-ever rock and roll show. Musicians performing at the Levitt Shell in June 2011 In the mid-1960s, the Shell was turned over to the Memphis Arts Center, who planned to raze it in order to build a $2 million theater. However, a campaign led by Noel Gilbert, long-time conductor of the Memphis Concert Orchestra, gathered 6,000 signatures in order to prevent its destruction. Later, in 1972, the Shell was nearly removed in order to build a parking garage, but was again saved by the outcry from the community. In 1982, the National Conference of Christians and Jews proposed a restoration, and the Shell was renamed in honor of Raoul Wallenberg. However, they could not raise the necessary funds, so by 1984, the previous plan for a parking lot began once again. This time, the Shell was saved by Mayor Richard Hackett. He pledged to fund a renovation if a private group would spearhead an arts program. In 1985, the Shell lay dormant for the first time in its history. In 1986, a corporation was formed by private citizens named Save Our Shell, Inc. For the following 20 years, Save Our Shell presented hundreds of free programs there. In 2007, the Shell was renamed Levitt Shell at Overton Park and a large-scale renovation funded by the Levitt Foundation took place. The renovation was conducted by Memphis firm Askew Nixon Ferguson Architects with state-of-the-art audio and visual design. With the completion of the renovations on September 8, 2008, free concerts are now once again held in the Shell. The Shell offers concerts on Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday nights during its spring and fall seasons. In the summer of 2011, Indie Memphis debuted The Concert Film Series, presenting free concert films for the public on weekends during the summer months.

Deities worshipped in Jyotir Math are Lord Narayana and Shakti-Purnagiri. History =Background= Jyotir Math is the uttaramnaya matha or northern monastery, one of four cardinal institutions established by Adi Shankara (c. As per Present seating 145th Sankracharya of Puri Govardhan Math & the text of Puri Govardhan Math, Adi Sankara born in 507 BC, and in his 32-year age, Adi sankra established all four Math, Jyotir Math is one of the four math. In British regime, British assumed it to be 8th century CE, discarding the Sankracharya words & texts of math), the reviver of Vedic Sanatana Dharma.Pasricha, Prem C. (1977) The Whole Thing the Real Thing, Delhi Photo Company, p. 59-63 Shankara's four principal disciples, Padma-Pada, Hasta-Malaka, Suresvaracharya and Totakacharya were assigned to these four learning centers in the north, south, east and west of India. The subsequent leaders of each of these four monasteries have come to be known as Shankaracharyas in honor of the math's founder, Adi Shankara. As such they are the leaders of the Dasanami Sa·πÉnyasins who are considered to have custody of Advaita VedƒÅnta These four principle seats of learning are located in Purƒ´ (Odisha), Shringeri (Karnataka) and Dwarka (Gujarat) with the northern (Uttaramnaya) monastery being located in the city of Jyotirma·π≠h. =1900 to 1940= Jyotir Math was occupied by Swami Ramakrishna Tƒ´rtha in the 18th century but the monastery was inactive for 165 years following his mahasamadhi (death). During that time a number of Gurus made claim to the Shankaracharya title and lawsuits representing the claimants and their representatives date back to the 1900s. For a time the head priest, Raval, of the Badrinath temple was thought by some to hold the Shankaracharya title there. However, the formal occupation of the Matha only officially began when the leaders of the other three Mathas convinced Brahmananda Saraswati to accept the position.Love and God, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, Age of Enlightenment Press, 1973 p. 9 =1941 to 1953= The appointment of Brahmananda in 1941 was made by a group of monks and pandits based in the city of VaranasiUnknown author (5 May 1999) archived here.

Respected supporters of religious institutions, such as the rulers of the cities of Garhwal, Varanasi and Darbhanga, also endorsed Brahmananda and their recognition helped overcome opposition from previous claimants to the title. Brahmandanda was also perceived by his supporters as the embodiment of the qualifications mentioned in Vedic texts and this assisted in his unhindered ascension to the position at the age of 70. Brahmananda was charged with reconstructing the temple and institution at Jyotir Math. Through the assistance of the local Deputy Commissioner and parties responsible for his nomination, Brahmananda reclaimed the surrounding land that had been encroached upon by local farmers. Under his leadership a two-story, 30-room building was constructed to serve as the Peeth Bhawan of Jyotir Math. He also supervised the final construction of the Shrine of Purnagiri Devi about 100 yards in front of the new monastery which \\"the Darbhanga ruler\\" had begun, but not completed, just prior to his death.Varma, Dr. Raj R. P. (1980) Self Published, Strange Facts About A Great Saint Brahmanda's leadership was instrumental in re-establishing the Jyotir Math as \\"an important center of traditional advaita teaching in northern India\\" and the monastery was visited by the president of India, Rajendra Prasad in December 1952. =1954 to present= After the death of Brahmananda in 1953, Swami Hariharananda Saraswati, a now deceased disciple of Brahmananda, was offered the title but refused to accept it. Later it was revealed that five months before his death, Brahamananda had made a will and registered it with the District Registrar in Allahabad.Pasricha, Prem C. (1977) The Whole Thing the Real Thing, Delhi Photo Company, p. 71 The will named his disciple, Swami Shantanand Saraswati as his successor and Swami Dvarakesananda Saraswati, Swami Vishnudevananda Saraswati and Swami Paramatmananda Saraswati as alternate choices. As a result, Swami Shantanand Saraswati assumed the Shankarcharya-ship but his authority was disputed by several of Brahmananda's disciples and followers who did not feel that Shantanand met the requirements described in the Mahanusasana texts. Meanwhile, others claimed that Brahmananda's death was due to poisoning, and that his will was not authentic, causing civil lawsuits to be filed by concerned parties. Relevant organizations involved in reviving Jyotir Math, including a committee of pundits from Varanasi, proposed Swami Krishnabodha Asrama as the Shankaracharya despite Shantanand's claim and occupation of Jyotir Math. Asrama died in 1973 and nominated his disciple Swaroopananda Saraswati, a disciple of Brahmananda who had taken Swami Krishnabodha Ashrama as his guru after Brahmananda's death, as his successor. However, because Shantananda still occupied the Jyotir Math ashram built by Brahmananda, Swaroopananda took residence in a nearby building or ashram, said to be located near the former cave of Adi Shankara disciple, Trotakacharya. During his tenure, Shantanand was \\"supportive\\" of another Brahamananda disciple Maharishi Mahesh YogiMason (1994) p. 57 Note: \\"On Tuesday, 30 May 1961, eight years to the day after his master's death, the Shankaracharya of Jyotir Math, Swami Shantanand Saraswati graced the teacher training course with his presence and was received with all due ceremony. Arriving at the site where the new Academy was being built, he addressed the Maharishi and the gathered meditators . . . . He commended the practice of the Maharishi‚Äôs meditation, describing it as a 'master key to the knowledge of Vedanta' and added, 'There are other keys, but a master key is enough to open all the locks.\\" and \\"often appeared with him in public\\". However, in 1980, Shantananda vacated the Shankarcharya position in favor of Swami Vishnudevananda Saraswati, an additional disciple that was named in Brahmananda's will as an alternate choice for the Shankaracharya-ship. Author Williamson writes that Shantanand was removed by the other Shankarcharya's due to his \\"incompetence\\" and speculates that his relationship with the Maharishi may have been a contributing factor.Williamson, Lola (2012) New York University Press, Transcendent In America, page 87 However, Shantanand's successor, Vishnudevananda, also spoke well of the MaharishiCoplin, J.R. (1990) p. 62-63 Note: \\"Swami Vishnudevanand (the current Shankaracharya of Jyotir Math) speaks very highly of Maharishi and sees his teaching as a reflection of their master's. Both he and Shantanand (his immediate predecessor) were frequent guests of the Maharishi and personally endorsing his mission.\\" and publicly demonstrated his support by presiding over one of the Maharishi's publicized events in New Delhi in July 1986.Unknown author (July 26, 1986) Yogic Flying Demonstration, Press Trust of IndiaUnknown author (July 21, 1986) United News of India Vishnudevananda died in 1989 and Swami Vasudevananda Saraswati succeeded him. Former Shankaracharya, Shantanand, then died in 1997. Another claimant is Madhava Asrama who disputes the lineage of Vasudevananda and Swaroopananda and who was appointed leader of Jyotir Math in the 1960s. He contends that Swaroopananda cannot accept the title of Shankaracharya for both the western and northern mathas in which case the title reverts to a subsequent disciple of Krishnabodha Asrama. Madhava Asrama was reportedly appointed leader of Jyotir Math under the auspices of Shri Niranjana Deva Tirtha who was the Shankarcharya of Puri at that time. These events have resulted in three separate lineages at Jyotir Math despite Swarupananda being endorsed by other Adi Shankara mathas.

The hills attain heights of over 300 feet (91.44 meters) in elevation, attaining a maximum elevation of 307 feet (93.57 meters) at Throckmorton Hill, which is the highest point in Howell Township. Geography The Hominy Hills extend from west to east, between Freehold and Asbury Park, for a distance of approximately four miles. The greater portion of the range lies within Naval Weapons Station Earle. It forms the divide between the Swimming River to the north, and the Manasquan and Shark Rivers to the south. Following is a list describing the notable summits of the Hominy Hills from west to east; all are entirely within Naval Weapons Station Earle. *Throckmorton Hill, or Hominy Hill proper, 307 feet (93.57 meters) high,USGS Marlboro Quadrangle, New Jersey - Monmouth Co., 7.5 Minute - Series (Topographic) 1995 is located to the west of Guadalcanal Road. Lunga Road climbs this hill, curving around the summit but not attaining it. A fire lookout tower formerly stood on the summit, a water tower stands near the site of the fire tower. *Cranberry Hill, 244 feet (74.37 meters),USGS Topographic Sheet, New Jersey - New York, Sandy Hook Quadrangle, 1884 is located southeast of the intersection of Esperance and Macassar roads, it is crossed by a fire road. *Huckleberry Hill or Lippincott Hill, also 244 feet (74.37 meters), is located south of Esperance Road and north of Munda Road. The headwaters of the Shark River are to the south of this hill. Geology A cuesta, the Hominy Hills are composed of layers of unconsolidated sand, mud, and gravel from the Atlantic Coastal Plain. The topmost geologic layer, the Cohansey Formation, is composed of sand, gravel, and erosion resistant ironstone. This layer forms a hard capstone along the highest summits, protecting more easily weathered underlying geologic layers such as the Kirkwood Formation. The scarp of the cuesta faces north while the gentler dip slope faces south. Flora and fauna The Hominy Hills fall within the Pinelands region, and exhibit both pine dominated and oak dominated forests, as well as intermediate forests. Pitch pine (Pinus rigida) is the most abundant tree. A variety of oaks are also present, including black (Quercus velutina), white (Quercus alba), post (Quercus stellata), chestnut (Quercus prinus), scarlet (Quercus coccinea), and blackjack (Quercus marilandica). These forests tend to be open with widely spaced trees and plenty of sunlight reaching the forest floor. The understory is thick with shrubs, including black huckleberry (Gaylussacia baccata) and early lowbush blueberry (Vaccinium pallidum). Mountain laurel (Kalmia latifolia), and sheep laurel (Kalmia angustifolia) are also present. Bracken fern (Pteridium aquilinum) is abundant. Animals such as whitetailed deer, gray squirrels, red squirrels, chipmunks, red fox as well as a large variety of birds inhabit the hills. Turkey Vultures and Red Tail Hawks are also common. Recreation As much of the Hominy Hills are within Naval Weapons Station Earle no public recreation areas exist. Hominy Hill Golf Course, operated by the Monmouth County Park System, is actually located in the lowland to the north of the Hominy Hills.

Her head bowed in grief,Wolff, 113 and although she looks outwards, her expression is reflective and introspective. Her eyes - like those of Christ on the right panel - are coyly and dignifiedly averted away from the viewer. Hers are downcast, his equally tear reddened eyes gaze to his right.Wolff, 114 In comparison to the passionate and expressively rendered depictions of Mary's suffering in the art of Bouts' near contemporaries Jan van Eyck or Rogier van der Weyden,See van der Weyden's c 1435‚Äì38 Descent from the Cross, or van Eyck's c 1440 Crucifixion and Last Judgement diptych.

The resort opened in 1890 as the Royal Johannesburg Golf Club, and merged with the Kensington Golf Club in 1998. It is part of the PGA Tour network of golf courses. The East Course has hosted the South African PGA Championship since 2005 and both the East and West, the Joburg Open since 2007, the biggest annual professional golf event in Africa; the 2012 field was the largest of the PGA European Tour season, with 210 players. It also has hosted the International Final Qualifier (Africa) for the Open Championship since 2009, the Sanlam Women's Amateur Golf Championships of South Africa in 2008, and the 5 Nations Commonwealth Tournament in 2007. History Founded on 6 November 1890, members of the Johannesburg Golf Club first began playing \\"behind Hospital Hill\\", in an area that later became known as Clarendon Circle and Empire Road. The club did not settle here, moving four times in the next 19 years, before settling in 1909 on the land it still occupies today. The Club helped create the Transvaal Golf Union in 1908, and provided the first President of the South African Golf Union in 1910. In 1930, the Prince of Wales (who later became King Edward VIII), played the West Course. Six months later, he became the club's patron. In July 1931, King George V added the \\"Royal\\" prefix to the club‚Äôs name. Little is known about the original Kensington Golf Club that went out of business in 1918. The later version of Kensington hosted a number of significant South African tournaments and competitions, particularly in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. Kensington merged with Royal Johannesburg in 1998. West Course The West Course was designed in 1909 by Laurie Waters. In 1929, British architect Major Hotchkin made considerable changes to the course, with construction being carried out by club professional Robert Grimsdell. The 4th hole is regarded as the signature hole. A tributary of the Jukskei River sits at the front the green and is in play along the left hand side of the fairway. The hole is set against the scenic backdrop of Linksfield Ridge. East Course In 1933, the club owners decided to build a second course, which resulted in the purchase of a farm to the east of the club. Grimsdell began designing the new course. Within two years, Grimsdell had constructed 21 new holes, and both the East and West courses were in play. Grimsdell then began construction on a new clubhouse, placed centrally between the two courses. Construction was completed in March 1939. Golf course architect Mark Muller revamped the original construction in 1998. The 10th and 11th holes are reputed to be the two longest back-to-back par fours in the world. The South African PGA Championship, Joburg Open, and International Final Qualifier (Africa) for the Open Championship all play on this course. = Holes and Yardages = # 463 yards - par 5 # 211 yards - par 3 # 403 yards - par 4 # 411 yards - par 4 # 139 yards - par 3 # 510 yards - par 5 # 355 yards - par 4 # 457 yards - par 5 # 374 yards - par 4 Out: 3,543 yards - par 37 # 450 yards - par 4 # 423 yards - par 4 # 168 yards - par 3 # 361 yards - par 4 # 367 yards - par 4 # 386 yards - par 4 # 152 yards - par 3 # 348 yards - par 4 # 464 yards - par 5 In: 3,397 yards- par 35 Total: 6,940 yards- par 72 Awards The Royal became the first Audubon-certified golf course in South Africa, as it became a \\"Certified Audubon Cooperative Sanctuary\\" in 2005.

It is located in the parish of Eglish and Drumcullen which is in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Meath. The hamlet has a number of local amenities for the local population including a church (dedicated to St. John the Baptist), a national school, a local community centre and a local shop. Drumcullen GAA is the local GAA club and is located about half a kilometre to the south of the hamlet. As the place-name suggests, Rath takes its name from the Irish word 'An R√°th' which means ringfort. Ringforts are circular fortified settlements with some dating as far back as the Iron Age (800 BCE‚Äì400 CE). There is no evidence of a ringfort at the present day hamlet, however there are remains of one at nearby Mullinafawnia, a few kilometres south west of the hamlet. Nearby, about 300 metres from the hamlet, is a hill called Rathmount where the local rath may have been. In Gaelic Ireland, Rath was located in the territory of Firceall, of the Kingdom of Meath. The O'Molloy clan were chieftains of the territory and had a castle in nearby Eglish (the remains of which are still visible today). Following the plantations of Offaly in the 16th century, Firceall was broken up into the Baronies of Ballycowan, Ballyboy and Eglish. The present day hamlet developed around the old Bennett Estate located in Thomastown, just south of the hamlet which gave regular local employment from the mid-1700s. The present day Catholic church in Rath was built by the family. The Bennett family is an unusual case in being a Catholic landlord family during the times of the Protestant Ascendancy of Ireland. Employment in the area is mainly agricultural however there are a number of industries also. Grennans is a family owned agri-trading business in the hamlet providing much employment. The business mainly deals with the manufacturing and distribution, of animal feeds, farm fertilisers and agricultural seeds and also sell agrochemicals, farm hardware and farm plastics. Bord na Mona also have a large briquette factory nearby in Derrinlough. Nearby villages include Fivealley about 3 km. to the north which is on the N52 motorway and Killyon about 3 km. to the south on R-440, both of which are located within the same parish. Eglish Castle and the Church of Saint James, Eglish, are located about 3 km. to the west. The site of the once celebrated monastery of Drumcullen is located southeast of the hamlet. The remains of the old church and high cross date back to the early Christian Ireland. Killyon was also the site of an ancient convent founded by Saint Liadhain. It is believed to be linked to the ancient monastery of Seir Kieran.

Displaying maternal sensitivity towards infant cues, processing those cues and being motivated to engage socially with her infant and attend to the infant's needs in any context could be described as mothering behavior and is regulated by many systems in the maternal brain. Research has shown that hormones such as oxytocin, prolactin, estradiol and progesterone are essential for the onset and the maintenance of maternal behavior in rats, and other mammals as well. Mothering behavior has also been classified within the basic drives (sexual desire, hunger and thirst, fear, power/dominance etc.). Less is known about the paternal brain, but changes in the father's brain occur alongside the mother once the offspring is born. Maternal brain =Maternal hormonal effect= Different hormone levels in the maternal brain and the overall well being of the mother account for 40%‚Äì50% of differences in the mother's attachment to her infant. Mothers experience a decrease in estrogen and an increase in oxytocin and prolactin caused by lactation, pregnancy, parturition and interaction with the infant. Oxytocin The levels of oxytocin in the maternal brain correlate with maternal behaviors such as gazing, vocalization, positive affect, affectionate touch and other similar mother-infant relationship behaviors. Estradiol and progesterone High mother-infant attachment correlates with a higher ratio of estradiol/progesterone at the end of pregnancy, than at the beginning. Cortisol In the first few days after giving birth the levels of cortisol are high which correlates with maternal approach behavior and positive maternal attitudes. Mothers with high levels of cortisol were also found to be more vocal towards their children. Mothers who experienced adversity in their own childhood, had higher daily patterns of cortisol levels, and were less maternally sensitive. Glucocorticoids Glucocorticoids are not essential for displaying maternal behaviors, but in mothers, the levels of glucocorticoids are elevated as to initiate lactation. =Neuroanatomy= Different areas/structures of the brain are associated with different factors which contribute to maternal behavior. One's own infant acts as a special stimulus which triggers activation of different areas of the brain. These brain areas together allow for maternal behavior and related systems. The Medial Preoptic Area (MPOA) of the hypothalamus contains receptors for estradiol, progesterone, prolactin, oxytocin, vasopressin and opioids. All these hormones are involved in some way in activating maternal behavior in the brain. The following are other behavioral changes necessary for mothering that the MPOA is responsible for: * mother's affect (changes made by the amygdala, prefrontal cortex) * stimulus salience (changes made by the amygdala and nucleus accumbens) * attention (changes made by the nucleus accumbens and medial prefrontal cortex) * memory (changes made by the nucleus accumbens and medial prefrontal cortex). Skin-to-skin contact with a newborn helps to increase the mother's oxytocin The amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex also contain receptors for the hormones which are most likely to be changing behavior at the time of pregnancy, and may be the sites where these changes occur. Increased activity has also been observed in the amygdala as the mother is responding to emotions seen in negative (fearful) faces, positive faces or familiar faces that her baby makes. Primate mothers with damage to the prefrontal cortex have also been associated with disrupted maternal behavior. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) plays a role in the attention, cognitive flexibility and working memory of the mother. It helps the mother identify infant cues. In any environment and efficiently, it allows for the decision-making and action planning process involved in attending to the infant's cues. The thalamus, parietal cortex, and brain stem serve for processing the smell, touch and vocalization associated with the infant. =Postpartum changes= Changes in estrogen, oxytocin and prolactin in the early postpartum period cause changes in the structures of the maternal brain. In animal mothers Postpartum, new neuron production is suppressed due to decreased levels of estrogen and increased levels of glucocorticoids mother rats. Mother-infant interaction is also thought to suppress neurogenesis in the hippocampus postpartum in the rat maternal brain. Maternal experience increases neurogenesis in the subventricular zone (SBZ) which is responsible for producing the neurons of the olfactory bulb. Prolactin is the hormone which mediates the increase in neurogenesis in SBZ. In animals, structures of the mother's brain change postpartum due to the increased interaction of the mother with the infant. The volume of gray matter increases postpartum in the following brain regions: * bilateral hypothalamus * amygdala * substantia nigra * globus pallidus. These changes in the brain may occur in order to promote appropriate mothering behavior. The mother's positive attitude towards the infant can be used as a predictor for the increase in gray matter in the above stated brain structures. Also in rats, the increased interaction with pups causes an increase in density in the MPOA. Postpartum increase in gray matter volumes may help the mother activate the motivation to perform maternal behavior in response to cue from their offspring. Postpartum, the substantia nigra activates positive responses to the pup stimuli via dopamine neurons. In human mothers The amygadala, prefrontal cortex and hypothalamus begin to change during pregnancy due to the high levels of stress experienced by the mother during this time. In human mothers there was a correlation between increased gray matter volume in the substantia nigra and positive emotional feelings towards the infant. Other changes such as menstrual cycle, hydration, weight and nutrition may also be factors which trigger the maternal brain to change during pregnancy and postpartum. Maternal experience alters behaviors which stem from the hippocampus such as enhancing spatial navigation learning and behaviors linked with anxiety. Recent research has begun to look at how maternal psychopathology affects the maternal brain in relation to parenting. Daniel Schechter and colleagues have studied specifically interpersonal violence- related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and comorbid dissociation as associated with specific patterns of maternal neural activation in response to viewing silent video-stimuli of stressful parent-toddler interactions such as separation versus less-stressful ones such as play. Importantly, less medial prefrontal cortex activity and greater limbic system activity (i.e. entorhinal cortex and hippocampus) were found among these post-traumatically stressed mothers of toddlers compared to mothers of toddlers without PTSD in response to stressful parent-child interactions as well as, within a different sample, in response to menacing adult male-female interactions. In the latter study, this pattern of corticolimbic dysregulation was linked to less observed maternal sensitivity during mother-child play. Decreased ventral-medial prefrontal cortex activity in violence-exposed mothers, in response to viewing their own and unfamiliar toddlers in video-clips of separation versus play, has also been associated with increased PTSD symptoms, parenting stress and decreased methylation of the glucocorticoid receptor gene. =Early experiences and shaping= Women who had a positive experience involving their family in their childhood are more likely to be more maternally sensitive and provide that same experience for their own children. Mothers that had negative experiences involving their families undergo neurobiological changes which lead to high stress reactivity and insecure attachment. This causes lower maternal responsiveness to their infant's needs. Rat mothers provide high levels of maternal care (licking and grooming) to their offspring if they themselves received high maternal care as a pup from their own mothers. Rat mothers who received low levels of maternal care as pups have lower levels of expression of the glucocorticoid receptor gene and lower synaptic density in the hippocampus. In human mothers, lower hippocampal volume has been associated with a lower ability to regulate emotions and stress, which can be linked with decreased maternal sensitivity as a mother. Mothers with insecure attachments to their own mothers display higher amygdala sensitivity to negative emotional stimuli, like hearing their infant cry. Having more difficulty dealing with stress makes mothers less responsive to their infant's cues. Larger gray matter and increased activations of the following brain areas occur in mothers who had experienced higher quality maternal care as infants: * middle temporal gyrus * superior temporal sulcus and * middle frontal cortex. This allows the mother to be more sensitive to her own infant's needs. Postpartum depression has also been associated with mothers who received low quality maternal care early in their own life. Paternal brain In only 6% of mammalian species, including humans, the father plays a significant role in caring for his young. Similar to the changes that occur in the maternal brain, the same areas of the brain (amygdala, hypothalamus, prefrontal cortex, olfactory bulb etc.) are activated in the father, and hormonal changes occur in the paternal brain to ensure display of parenting behavior. =Paternal hormonal effect= An increase in levels of oxytocin, glucocorticoids, estrogen and prolactin occur in the paternal brain. These hormonal changes occur through the father's interaction with the mother and his offspring. Oxytocin levels are positively correlated with the amount of affection the father displays towards the child. In humans, and in other primate species, lower levels of testosterone have been linked to the display of paternal behavior. =In animal fathers= In father rats, just as in the mother rats, a decrease in neurogenesis in the hippocampus occurs postpartum. Just like in mothers, fathers also have increased levels of glucocorticoids which are thought to suppress the production of new cells in the brain. Marmoset fathers have enhanced dendritic spine density in the prefrontal cortex. This increase correlates with increase in vasopressin receptors in this area of the paternal brain. With age, this effect is reversed, and is therefore believed to be driven by father-infant interactions. Changes in neurogenesis in the prefrontal cortex of the paternal brain have been linked in some species to recognition of kin. =In human fathers= Being exposed to crying babies activates the prefrontal cortex and the amygdala in both fathers and mothers, but not in non-parents. The level of testosterone in the paternal brain correlates with the effectiveness of the father's response to the baby's cry. Increased levels of prolactin in the paternal brain has also been correlated with a more positive response to the infant's cry.

It is sometimes less correctly referred to as reik√§leip√§, shorter term without ruis (rye) which applies also to the oat loaf with a hole. The baking of ruisreik√§leip√§ is a tradition in western Finland. In eastern Finland thick rye bread, usually called ruislimppu (rye loaf), is more common, but traditionally only bread baked from rye has been called bread in the Karelia and Savo (eastern) regions. The hole had a functional purpose: the bread was baked in flat rings to be placed on poles suspended just below the kitchen ceiling to mature and dry in the relative warmth. Usually many loaves were baked at once. Ruuanlaittoa ja leiv√§ntekoa, P√§ij√§nne.com. The poles also remained the place of storage so that the bread aged, in its many forms, over the long winter. Nowadays this kind of bread is available in all its forms and stages of aging throughout the whole of Finland, regardless of season, and is one main component of the Finnish diet. The way it was prepared is related to the way houses used to be built in western Finland, that is with the baking oven separate from the heating oven. In eastern Finland, where the oven used to be heated every day, it was more common to eat freshly baked bread and to cook various kinds of long-stewed oven foods like the Karelian hot pot. Paikallista ruokakulttuuria: Pohjois-Pohjanmaa, Cha√Æne des R√¥tisseurs Finlande. Unlike ruislimppu, there is no discernible difference between the skin and the core of ruisreik√§leip√§, as the dark outer color and the soft inner core are missing. Considerably more roughage is present, and the bread is rather dense compared to the other traditional breads. Some flour, seed and even yeast remnants can top the bread; less moisture is present; and the texture is somewhere between gummy, unyielding and downright crackery, depending on age. This reflects the bread's role as an indefinitely storable foodstuff which would last from the fertile summer through the relatively long and harsh northern winter. As a result, ruisreik√§leip√§ takes some time and effort to chew down properly. In the process it then acquires a peculiar culinary quality: it starts off as rather sour and earthy in taste, but by the time it is ready to be swallowed, amylase enzymes in the saliva have already broken down enough of the starch in it to make it sweeter.

It is based on the 1992 novel Meeting Evil by Thomas Berger. It stars Samuel L. Jackson and Luke Wilson. Plot John Felton, who lives in Orly County in an unnamed southern state, has a wife named Joanie, and two kids named Sam and John Jr.. John is a mild-mannered real estate agent who has just been fired, making his personal crisis (his marriage is on the rocks because of his infidelity) go from bad to worse. John comes home and finds a foreclosure notice on the front door, and goes inside to a surprise birthday party thrown by Joanie and the kids. The foreclosure notice has John angry, so Joanie takes the kids to a local park. John is in the backyard, staring at the hole that's being dug for the swimming pool he is having installed and notices that the job is going slowly. There is an incessant banging on the front door. John answers, and it's a man who calls himself Richie. Wearing a suit and fedora, Richie says his car, a 1972 Pontiac GTO stalled and requires a push. As John pushes the car from the back while Richie steers, the car backfires, injuring John's left knee. Richie opens the trunk of his car and approaches John concealing a revolver behind his back but hides it when he sees a little girl walking her dog. Richie offers to take John to the hospital, and he reluctantly accepts, not realizing that he's leaving his wallet and cell phone behind at the house. On the way, John wonders about Richie's strange behavior‚ÄîRichie is continuously \\"whistling Dixie\\"‚Äîand then Richie stops at a bar. John goes across the street to a cell phone dealership, where Rhonda, a clerk with a severe attitude problem, rudely denies him the use of a phone to call Joanie for a ride home. At the bar, John crosses paths with Trevor, the man who fired him, and Tammy Strate, the woman with whom he had his affair. Tammy was Trevor's girlfriend before she left Trevor to be with John, and this is hinted as why he was fired. A few minutes later, police cars start showing up, and Richie suggests that he and John leave. They leave with Tammy in her car, and once they get out onto a remote part of the road, a trucker harasses them and forces them to pull over. The trucker is Rhonda's boyfriend, angry that Rhonda has been killed, and he thinks John did it. John gets out of the car, and the trucker approaches him with a tire iron. Suddenly, Richie hits the trucker with the car, killing the trucker. It turns out that Richie, who killed Rhonda, is a murderous psychopath. Local cops Frank and Latisha think John is the killer. John realizes that this was not the day to play good samaritan. He and Tammy are in for a violent ride that they don't want to be on. Tammy escapes from Richie, and John tries to escape, Richie, disguised as a deputy, recaptures John. John forces Richie to let him go, and Richie threatens Joanie and the kids. After a massacre at a store, John is arrested by Frank, who refuses to believe John's story about Richie, and that night, Latisha learns that John is not the killer‚Äîmurders were committed in a diner while John was in custody, and Tammy has corroborated John's story about Richie. Frank releases John, who goes home with Joanie and the kids, and Frank and Latisha, who thought Richie was killed at the diner, learn that he's still alive, and may be on his way to the Felton house. In fact, Richie is already there, harassing the Feltons, and it's raining heavily. While they are eating dinner, Richie explains to John that Joanie is having an affair and had, in fact, hired Richie to kill him for insurance money. John attacks Joanie being egged on by Richie, she tries to stab John with a knife and he takes it from her ready to do the same, but instead stabs Richie and she then uses one of John's golf clubs to attack Richie as well. John and Richie crash through a window and fall into the pool hole struggling, which has been filled with water because of the rain. Frank and Latisha arrive, and Latisha fires a shot that kills Richie. That night, in bed, Joanie asks if everything is going to be okay, and Joanie turns out her light. John doesn't answer and turns out his light, ominously whistling Dixie, just like Richie. Cast *Samuel L.

The BCCS currently owns four properties in Bath and Highland counties totaling , protecting the entrances to Butler Cave, Bobcat Cave, Robins Rift, and many other minor caves. As of January 2015, Butler Cave is the 40th longest cave in the United States, and the Chestnut Ridge Cave system (including Bobcat Cave) is the 30th longest cave in the US. The BCCS is an affiliated cave conservancy of the National Speleological Society.  History  The BCCS was formed by a group of Virginia and Pennsylvania cavers in 1968, making it the first cave conservancy in the United States. The idea of forming a society to protect and manage Butler Cave was formulated in July 1968 by Nevin C. and Thelma Davis, and Ike and Connie Nicholson, and the society was formed on 2 November 1968. The society then shortly leased the property containing the entrance to Butler Cave, and formally incorporated on 15 May 1970. In the mid-1960s, Butler Cave was the longest known cave in Virginia. Being the longest cave in Virginia, the cave attracted much attention from recreational and exploratory cavers, and incidents of vandalism and trespassing grew. After forming in 1968, BCCS established an access policy to curb prior problems of vandalism and trespassing, and the policy was announced in the NSS News in 1971. In February 1971, the BCCS began work on performing a comprehensive study of the caves and karst of Burnsville Cove (Virginia), and the study was published in The NSS Bulletin. The 101-page July 1982 NSS Bulletin was completely devoted to this topic. In 1973, Butler Cave and Breathing Cave were designated as a National Natural Landmark by the National Park Service. In 2012, the BCCS made its third land acquisition, the property containing the entrance to Robin's Rift. In 2015, the book The Caves of Burnsville Cove, Virginia was published by Springer. This 479-page full color volume of the \\"Cave and Karst Systems of the World\\" series was edited by William B. White, a BCCS member, and the content was written by BCCS members and affiliated friends of the BCCS. In 2015, the monograph Breathing Cave was published by the Virginia Speleological Society. This 88-page volume contains a number of chapters written by BCCS members. In 2016, the BCCS established the Sinking Creek Grant, a program of small grants to encourage cave and karst scientific research in and around Burnsville Cove, Virginia. In 2018, the BCCS purchased 7.8 acres containing the Steamer Hole (a sinkhole) and the historic Burnsville Postmasters House, establishing the Postmaster House Preserve.

In post war Sierra Leone, Caritas participated in peace building actions but has also worked with humanitarian relief, youth empowerment, gender equality, poverty eradication and HIV/AIDS prevention. Regions The dioceses of the Sierra Leone and The Gambia are grouped into 5 regions: and the Metropolitan Freetown, Bo, Kenema, Makeni and Banjul.

There are conflicting preferences for the name of the disorder through the twentieth century, with some like Karl Birnbaum preferring the term \\"Haltlose\\", while others like Kurt Schneider preferred \\"Willenlos\\" shifting focus off their lack of self-control. opposed to the moralist tones of those like Birnbaum who had described the Haltlose as unable to grasp \\"important ideal values such as honor and morality, duty and responsibility, as well as material ones such as prosperity and health\\". In 1976, the Government of Canada listed the alternate term \\"Unstable drifter\\" in a psychiatric criminology context as a problematic term for which they could not readily offer a French translation in accordance with their bilingualism laws.https://www.btb.termiumplus.gc.ca/tpv2alpha/alpha- eng.html?lang=eng&srchtxt;=UNSTABLE%20drifter&i;=&index;=ent&codom2nd;_wet=1https://www.btb.termiumplus.gc.ca/tpv2source?lang=eng&srchtxt;=UNSTABLE%20drifter&i;=1&index;=ent&src;_id=O10491976&rlang;=en&titl;=unstable%20drifter&fchrcrdnm;=1#resultrecs Ultimately the diagnosis was handicapped by the issues of translation, leading to criticism of \\"the impoverishment of psychiatric vocabulary\\" that led to declining research and use. Physiology A 1949 study of different psychopathies under examination by electroencephalography recordings showed that borderline personalities and haltlose personalities had increased levels of dysrhythmia, whereas other subtypes of psychopathy did not show variation.Honcke, Poul, Elektrencephalographische Untersuchungen an Psychopathen. 1949.

Blankenburg posted that those with haltlose personality disorder exhibited less categorical orientation than those patients who were simply unstable.Blankenburg, W. \\"Der Versagenszrustand bei Latenten Schizophrenien\\", Pages 93, 67-71. 1968 Symptoms Compared to other personality disorders, those with Haltlose demonstrate \\"a particularly large number of psychological deficiencies\\",Messner, Melanie Theresia. University of Graz, Pathologisierung des Verbrechens. Kriminalit√§t und Psychopathologie im kriminalwissenschaftlichen Diskurs um 1900: Pathologizing Crime, 2019 and it is not possible to further distinguish particular subtypes of the Haltlose. It is typically comorbid with other mental health diagnoses, and rarely appears isolated on its own.Petrilowitsch, N. \\"Charakterstudien\\", 1969. pp. 223-232 One early study indicated that 7.5% of psychopaths were Haltlose, compared to 10.6% that were Schizoid.NB: This study, circa 1967, pre-dated the modern categorization of Personality Disorders Kraepelin estimated that his own practice determined fewer than 20% of psychopaths he saw were Haltlose.Steinberg, Holger & Maria Strauss. \\"Die Aufmerksamkeitsdefizit-/ Hyperaktivit√§tsst√∂rung bei Erwachsenen in der klinischen Beschreibung und der Klassifikation von Emil Kraepelin\\", 2019.

They further display \\"great emotional irritability, which may result in violent loss of temper...and interpret every limitation as an undeserved insult\\" and have a \\"pronounced lust for argument\\". The symptoms are considered to worsen if patients are granted greater independence \\"in the home and in their work\\". Like sociopathy, haltlose personality disorder causes an inability to learn from experience, and an inability to feel genuine remorse as a strong present- time orientation, lacking long-term goals, leaves them detached from the reality of their past - their self schema only encompasses the immediate present. Also described as \\"living in a random location and moment\\", this is commonly seen in Cluster B personality disorders such as Borderline Personality Disorder with which it is frequently comorbid, even though Haltlose is seen as either outside the traditional Cluster organizationICD-10 F60.89 illnesses or a potential Cluster A personality disorder. A 2016 study categorised Haltlose and Borderline patients together for the purpose of studying suicide risks.Doyle, Michael. Suicide risk in primary care patients diagnosed with a personality disorder: a nested case control study. 2016 Those with HLPD display \\"a number of endearing qualities, charming with an apparent emotional warmth, but also an enhanced suggestibility and a superficiality of affect\\", which can lead to unrealistic optimism. and \\"wandering through life without ever taking firm root\\".Millon, T., Simonsen, E., & Birket-Smith, M.

They are also noted as \\"absolutely indifferent to others...likes to live for [their] pleasure today, does not make plans not only for the future but even for tomorrow, studying and working are not for them\\".

When Haltlose is not recognised as the diagnosis, the patient might be categorised as BPD or in the manic phase of Bipolar Disorder.International Advocacy, Personality Disorders Webinar, July 21, 2020 Haltlosen or similar personalities have a tendency to \\"disappear, wander and travel about, here, there and everywhere...[including those] known as the Orientkunden, [Middle Eastern] tramps. These are people who are attracted to the Orient on account of the ease with which they are able to live there without steady employment and the freedom from closer supervision of the Western civilization\\"\\". The lack of a sense of identity, or internal support, leads to a lack of resistance to both external and internal impulses. Choices are made, often in mirroring others around them, but \\"do not leave even a passing imprint on the person's identity\\". Thus, they can \\"behave properly for a while under good leadership\\", and are not to be trusted in leadership positions themselves.Ewald G. (1924) Die psychopathischen Charaktere.

NB this work uses the term \\"Asthenic Psychopath\\", others use \\"Asthenic Personality Disorder\\" or \\"Dependent Personality Disorder\\". Persons with Dependent Personality Disorder are defined by a tendency to embarrassment, and submissiveness which are not genuine facets of those with Haltlose even if they mimic such. Haltlose is thus deemed the \\"more troublesome\\" personality. Published Summaries Heinrich Schulte BVO, a wartime medical judge and consulting psychiatrist for the military, continued advocating for the sterilization of Haltlose and other \\"Schwachsinnigen\\" even after the war's end.Halmi, Alice. \\"Kontinuit√§ten der (Zwangs-)Psychiatrie. Eine kritische Betrachtung\\", 2008 Otto Dornbluth offered the definition in his Clinical Dictionary, that the Haltlose were clinically \\"Psychopaths without perseverance, always derailing themselves despite good intentions\\".Dornbluth, Otto. Klinisches W√∂rterbuch: Haltlose, 1927 Karl Jaspers wrote in his General Psychopathology seeking to define the word that formed the diagnosis, rather than the personality disorder itself, that \\"Those who have no willpower at all, the drifters, simply echo any influence that impinges on them\\".Jaspers, K. (1963) General Psychopathology. p. 440. In Kramer's lengthy analysis, he proposed that the Haltlose had a \\"hypersensitivity to sensory perceptions\\" which led them to deliberately spoil situations into which they actually wished to adapt and settle. This leads to \\"something quite contradictory in the self-assessment of the Haltlose psychopath, on the one hand they are full of feelings of insufficiency, but on the other hand they have a very high self-assessment...[but] show an astonishing lack of criticism for the inadequacy of their achievements\\". \\"They want to at least play-act the role they can't really be internally, they pretend to possess skills and achievements that they do not have...often they want to become actors...they seek out lesser social elements to impress by way of appearing exploited and victimized, and for that they enjoy the reputation that they claim.\\" When caught in wrongdoing, \\"we find them contrite, self- accusing and assuring that they will improve - but on closer inspection it is feigned and not sincere.\\" Emil Kraepelin noted that those with Haltlose Personalities could excel at the arts, but displayed \\"poor and immature judgement...apt to take senseless journeys, perhaps even becoming vagabonds\\".\\"Psychopathy: Exploring Canadian Mass Newspaper Representations Thereof and Violent Offender Talk Thereon\\", doctoral thesis for the University of Saskatchewan by Matthew L.

(Original work published 1903-1904) He also wrote that they were recognised as \\"possessing of lofty though unrealistic ambitions\\", active imaginations and would routinely \\"exaggerate, boast and fabricate\\" although their sexual habits were truthfully \\"atypical, irregular and unusual\\". Manfred Bleuler wrote \\"The Haltlosen are characterized by a lack of enduring emotional attachment and, thus, an abnormal tendency for the will to be influenced by various inner and outer stimuli\\",Bleuler, M. (1983) Eugen Bleuler: Lehrbuch der Psychiatrie (15th edn), p. 574. Berlin: Springer-Verlag. and that the court system needed to understand such persons were in \\"urgent need of inhibitions\\".Die Offene F√ºrsorge in der Psychiatrie und ihren Grenzgebieten, By E. Bleuler, page 168 Roth and Slater remarked that \\"immediate wishes, affections or disgruntlements rule [them] completely, and [they are] indifferent about the future and never consider the past\\" and those with Haltlosigkeit lack the traditional ability of insight but \\"are clever at concealing, both from themselves and others, this lack of real understanding by an exercise of verbal agility.\\" and noted \\"it is tempermentally impossible for him to save, or to maintain any secure financial position...he is always on the brink of a disaster.\\" They ultimately concluded that \\"the treatment of such a personality is almost hopeless under the present ordering of society. Any treatment would...present difficulties...beyond the powers of these patients. The prospects of psychotherapy are forlorn and the best that can be obtained will be reached through social control.\\" Uwe Henrik Peters detailed Haltlose Psychopaths in his psychiatric dictionary as \\"weak-willed, unreliable, unable to resist external influences, easily led astray, tending to sexual waywardness...if left alone, they cannot set their own goals, they have no inner compass.\\"Peters, U. H. (1984) W√∂rterbuch der Psychiatrie und medizinischen Psychologie (3rd edn). p. 445. Munich: Urban and Schwarzenberg. The 2012 manual \\"Psychiatric Emergencies in Family Practice\\" noted these individuals as being \\"affectionless, egocentric and demanding...show[ing] no realistic ambition or foresight. Often restless, they do not profit from experience or punishment and are frequently impulsive, lacking the awareness of others' needs...appearances in this group can be highly deceptive for they are plausible, likeable and natural. Without a proper history, the doctor can easily be misled by distortions which occasionally amount to pathological lying\\" An \\"evasion of reality\\" is frequently present.Moses-Mannheim, J. Seelische Konflikte und Komplikationen im Berufsleben jugendlicher psychopathen, 1928. Vienna.Vorlesungen √ºber Psychopathologie des Kindesalters. Berlin 1926. Quoted in Moses-Mannheim ibid. Recent criticism Dr. Friedrich Stumpfl cautioned against what he saw as a trend of diagnosing haltlose personality disorder without investigating comorbidities that may be even more pronounced.Stumpfl, Friedrich \\"Studien uber Vererbung und Entstehung Geistiger Storungen\\", 5th edition. Page 180 and elsewhere Recently, it has been criticized as a \\"diagnosis of convenience [that] avoids all further deliberations about a psychopathic personality\\".Khan, E. as published by Owald Bumke. \\"Spezieller Teil: Erster Teil Die Psychopathischen Anlagen\\", page 387++ and elsewhere Dr. DM Svrakic and Dr. M Divac-Jovanovic suggested the ICD-10 explanations of Haltlose, Immature and Psychoneurotic personality disorders appeared \\"dubious\\", and sociologist James Cosgrave found psychiatric use to represent a \\"fringe figure\\".Cosgrave, James F. \\"The Sociology of Risk and Gambling Reader\\", Page 372 A graduate student at Bochumer Stadt & Studierendenzeitung condemned the historical diagnosis of Haltlose personality disorder from an LGBT perspective, opining that \\"incredibly oppressive language\\" had been used by the psychiatrists studying it such as \\"pathological femininity\\".https://www.bszonline.de/artikel/wahnsinn-diese-frauen It may be that the evolution of test-batteries have minimized diagnoses of Haltlosen, differentiating it from some newer models in psychiatry. Haltlose personality disorder and childhood It has been proposed that haltlose personality disorder may arise from \\"traumatization through maternal indolence\\" or institutionalization in early life, although without definite conclusion.Frankenstein, Carl. \\"Varieties of Juvenile Delinquency\\", pp. 115, 158 and elsewhere Care must be taken in making Haltlose diagnoses of children, since \\"the traits of instability of purpose, lack of forethought, suggestibility, egoism and superficiality of affect...are to some extent normal in childhood\\". Children with haltlose personality disorder demonstrate a marked milieu dependency. Kraepelin contended the disorder was \\"based on a biological predisposition\\" but also affected by factors such as childrearing practises, social position and state of the parental home. His analysis showed that 49% of diagnosed Haltlose had obvious parental issues such as alcoholism or personality disorders. A 1944 study of children produced by incest by Dr. Alfred Aschenbrenner found a high rate of Haltlose personality disorder, which he suggested might be explained as inherited from overly suggestive mothers. It is not believed to manifest often in children until they have aged,Bericht √ºber die vierte Tagung √ºber Psychopathenf√ºrsorge D√ºsseldorf: 24.‚Äì25. September 1926, Deutschen Verein zur F√ºrsorge f√ºr jugendliche Psychopathen, Springer- Verlag, Mar. 13, 2013 - Psychology - 109 pages but while difficult to diagnose, it has been noted as presenting one of the stronger psychiatric difficulties if present at that age. It may be possible to prevent social failure \\"through welfare measures\\" akin to early intervention.Schubert, Werner. \\"Protokolle der Strafrechtsaussch√ºsse des Reichstags\\", 1995. Pg153 Regressive addictions amongst Haltlose psychopaths typically are infantile, and seek to replace the lost \\"dual union\\" arising from their parents' rejection, and later morph into a focus on subjects including vengeance or sado-masochism.Elemente der Exakten Triebpsychiatrie, \\"Klinische Psychologie Experimentelle Syndromatik\\", Page 190-191 Haltlose can cause educational difficulties, and if parents do not understand the peculiarities of their haltlose child, they may try to through good intentions to force the child into an educational regimen inappropriate for them, which then creates a feeling of isolation in the child which grows into a rebellious tendencies, \\"which turns out to be disastrous for further development\\". Students with Haltlose personalities were thought to prefer the arts over the sciences, since the former does not require a consistent sense of truth. They chafe at the notion of any religion as it introduces unwanted inhibitions, especially against parasuicidal demonstrations. Psychiatrists Lange, Kranz and Stumpfl were agreed that the Haltlose must be \\"given secure leadership\\" throughout life in order to remain \\"socially acceptable\\".Aschenbrenner, A.

Psych. 177, 700‚Äì724 (1944). https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02910000 Individual case studies Grave marker for Ernst Lossa In 1902, a criminal complaint in Bern noted regarding a Haltlose-diagnosed offender that \\"the moral weakness of the accused appears in nearly all his life relationships, and he gives his character their character...[his] principles lack natural strength and stand so haphazardly that, like a house of cards, they will collapse at teh first touch with the temptations of life\\". The commitment papers for an \\"Ida H.\\", arrested by Swiss authorities circa 1920, noted that her psychiatric assessment had determined she had Haltlose personality disorder and displayed \\"a strong fantasy, an inclination to hysteric symptoms and congenital feebleness\\".Gerodetti, Natalia. \\"Modernizing Sexualities\\", page 185 ff. In 1937, a German couple were declined a marriage certificate on the basis one proposed spouse \\"justif[ied] the conclusion that N. is in a condition of ethical and moral decline, due to a lack of healthy inhibitions...the court is therefore convinced that N is Haltlos and a criminal psychopath who is unable to conduct a marriage in the way in which it is desirable...it is to be feared that the inferior social characteristics that hold sway over [them] will be transmitted to offspring or that [they] would at the very least exert negative educational influences on [the children]\\". Ernst Lossa was a Yenish youth deemed to have a Haltlose personality disorder at the age of 10\\"Aus dem Gutachten von Dr. Hell, 1940, Ernst ist 10 Jahre und 9 Monate alt\\", 'From the report by Dr. Hell, 1940, Ernst is 10 years and 9 months old'. on account of his theft and treachery, who was later euthanized by the Nazis in 1944 at the Irsee sanatorium.Schuck, V.

In 2011, a Swiss court case noted the defendant had been diagnosed with Haltlose personality disorder, comorbid with ADHD and Narcissistic personality disorder, and that he had been taking benzodiazepines while in freedom but medication was unnecessary once he was institutionalized.https://entscheidsuche.ch/direkt_kantone%2Fzh_sozverger%2FIV.2011.00849.html Two years later another Swiss case noted another Haltlose diagnosis, comorbid with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Depression, which required \\"psychotropic drugs as well as supportive, connected and closely-controlled talk therapy\\".https://e.entscheidsuche.ch/bund/bvger/E-2262-2007.pdf Comorbidity and relation to criminality Kraepelin, in noting \\"an increased risk of criminal behavior\\", estimated that 64% of men and 20% of women with Haltlose descended into alcoholism in the early twentieth century. The frequent intersection between HLPD and alcoholism means modern clinical researchers may use \\"haltlose\\" as a grouping when separating subjects by disposition.Kankeleit, Dr. \\"Alkohol und Geisteskrankheiten\\", Hamburg, 1926 In 1935, it was estimated that 58% of recidivist criminals were diagnosed with Haltlose personality disorder, higher than any other personality disorder. More recently, Haltlose and Histrionic were the most common personality disorders found in female juvenile delinquents by forensic psychologists in Russia in the year 2000.Sexualitat, abweichendes sozialverhalten und geschlechterrollen delinquenter weiblicher jugenlicher They respond very well to institutionalization where their influences can be controlled, being \\"model inmates\\" of sanitariums, \\"but if you leave them, through good intentions, to their own devices - they don't last long before collapsing their current state and being seduced back onto the wrong track\\". A 1942 study of the German army tested for eleven personality disorders in a study group and found that only Haltlose and Schizoid were not measurable among soldiers despite their presence in the civilian population.Aus dem Institut f√ºr Anatomie und Zellbiologie des Fachbereichs Medizin der Philipps-Universit√§t Marburg und der Emil-von-Behring-Bibliothek f√ºr Geschichte und Ethik der Medizin Gesch√§ftsf√ºhrender Direktor: Prof. Dr. Gerhard Aum√ºller \\"Diagnose Psychopath ‚Äì Die Behandlung von Soldaten und Zivilisten in der Marburg Universit√§ts- Nervenklinik 1939-1945\\" Inaugural-Dissertation zur Erlangung des Doktorgrades der gesamten Humanmedizin dem Fachbereich Medizin der Philipps Universit√§t Marburg vorgelegt von Katrin G√ºnther geborene Steinmetz aus Kassel 2008 A 1978 study determined that Haltlose and Asthenic personality disorder had the lowest rates had the most unfavorable outcomes of psychopathic patients.Kalachev, BP, Results of long-term catamnesis of neurotic and psychopathic states and assessment of the prognosis, 1978 In 1937, G.E. Buda released a study of 72 convicts with haltlose personality disorder, debilitation and psychosis to study their mental degeneration.Buda, G. \\"Ueber das Vorhandensein beziehungsweise Fehlen von sogenanaten Entartungszeichen bei 72 Verwahrungagefangenes; haltloses psychopathen, debiles und psychotikern\\", Zurich, 1937, 52p. The American Journal of Psychiatry published a study of hit and run drivers, which showed 40% of drivers who fled the scene of a traffic accident tested positive for haltlose personality disorder. This was consistent with the earlier finding that Haltlose Personalities were among the most likely to attempt to flee if caught in commission of any crime.Pappenheim, Martin and Grosz, Carl. \\"Die Neurosen und Psychosen des Pubertatsalters\\", 1914. Page 56 A 1967 German study had suggested over 90% of adult-child incest offenders were diagnosed with Haltlose Personality Disorder.Muller, Dr. M. with Spatz, Dr. H. and Vogel, Dr. P. \\"Monographien Aus Dem Gesamtgebiete der Neurologie und Psychiatrie\\", 1967 Upon being confronted with their misdeeds, the Haltlose respond \\"with more or less superficial reasons to excuse them, they claim that their parents treated them incorrectly, that they were the victim of adverse circumstances, seduced by other people and misled. Other Haltlose, especially those with a strong intellect, make up a theoretical schema that would justify their actions.\\" Although Kraepelin believed those with Haltlose personality disorder represented the antithesis of morality,Germann, Urs Philipp. \\"Psychiatrie Und Strafjustiz: Entstehung, Praxis und Ausdifferenzierung der Foreneisschen Psychiatrie in der Deutschsprachigen Schwiez 1850-1950 there is not necessarily a tendency towards deliberate amorality among the demographic despite its frequent criminal violations since they may lack the ability to premeditate. But their demonstrated lack of self-control is \\"especially manifested in the sphere of morality\\".psychology.academic.ru, –õ–∏—á–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å —Ä–∞—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–º–æ–∂–µ–Ω–Ω–∞—è It has been noted that, in addition to the fact \\"the theatre, as a rule, exerts a great attraction for these people\\", that they are likewise \\"very superficial, they easily acquire knowledge but do not apply it in any way and soon forget it. Memory is usually poor and untrustworthy...often they seem to have no realization of the truth\\". Role of relatives in care The tendency to accumulate debts while seeking pleasure or escaping responsibility is often the attributed cause for their descent into crime, although Kramer noted those who displayed \\"extreme dexterity, sufficient talent for imagination, and a tendency towards dishonesty\\" were able to find alternative sources of income without necessarily becoming criminal, although warned that \\"again and again, their debts have to be paid until the parents no longer can, or want to, do this and leave them to their selves\\". When required to live independently, they \\"soon lose interest, become distracted and absent-minded, and commit gross errors and negligence\\". The frequent intersection between those with haltlose personality disorder and crime resulted in the summary \\"probably the most important function of the psychiatrist when dealing with these patients is to protect their relatives and friends from ruining themselves in hopeless attempts at reclamation. With most of these patients a time comes when the relatives will be best advised...to allow the patient to go to prison, or otherwise suffer unsheltered the consequences of his deeds.\\" By contrast, in 1943 the \\"rather optimistic\\" belief of Dr. Desmond Curran and Dr. Eric Guttman was that \\"a suitable [spouse]\\" could with strict guidance drastically improve the outcome of Haltlosen patients.D.

Early years He was born December 5, 1924, in Wilkes-Barre, PA,\\"Former educator named Sumter Rotarian of the year, The Item (Sumter, SC), May 10, 1997 the son of William and Elizabeth Jones Bevan. He remained proud of his strong Welsh heritage throughout his life. When Dr. Bevan walked into a room he was immediately noted for his colorful bow-ties, but nothing distracted those in attendance from the overpowering baritone voice that commanded attention when he rose to speak. Sometimes referred to by faculty as ‚Äúthe Burning Bush,‚Äù he ignited challenge after challenge to his colleagues and students alike. ‚ÄúThe greatest unused resource we have in this country is the minds of young people,‚Äù he said and his goal was for the academic community to teach those young minds how to be great thinkers and decision makers for their generation and generations to come. Education Jack Bevan received his AB from Franklin and Marshall College, and his BD, MA and PHD degrees from Duke University. In addition, he was awarded honorary Doctor of Science and Doctor of Law Degrees. He was the founding academic vice-president of Florida Presbyterian College (later named Eckerd College) in St. Petersburg, Florida,Wilbur, William C, \\"Eckert College: a proud part of the community\\", St Petersburg Times, October 8, 1991, p2 and for the rest of his life cherished the memory of the talented faculty he was able to bring together to establish one of the most unusual curricula in the country. He served in similar capacities at The College of Charleston, Davidson College, and the University of the Pacific. Prior to moving into administration, he had been a professor of psychology at Heidelberg College, Davidson College, and Duke University. Dr. Bevan served as Executive Director of the Charleston Higher Education Consortium and as an adjunct professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, School of Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina prior to his retirement in 1986. Acknowledgements Dr. Bevan is remembered for his innovative approaches to education, his motivational challenges to members in the academic community and his dynamic oratory. He developed the first 4-1-4 programs, which were later adopted by countless universities across the country, the first undergraduate Teacher Corps program and one of the three initial Upward Bound programs. He developed the South Carolina's Governor's School and the South Carolina Professional Development Program for Science and Mathematics Teachers. He traveled extensively in Asia and helped develop academic programs in Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong and India. Community service Committed to community service and each individual‚Äôs responsibility to leave the world a better place, Dr. Bevan continued his work after retiring. He became a member of the Board of Trustees of Thornwell Home and School for Children, a member of the Board of Directors of Habitat for Humanity and Covenant House, a member of the Sumter Rotary and Fortnightly Clubs as well as the Cosmos Club of Washington, DC. He is remembered at Eckerd College through The John M. Bevan Award presented to an outstanding faculty member each year and The Bevan Memorial Scholarship which is awarded annually to rising juniors who are a catalyst for positive innovative programs within the college and community at large. The faculty lounge is also named in his honor. Family Dr. Bevan married Louise Dabbs Bevan from the Salem Black River Presbyterian Church in Sumter, South Carolina in 1946. He worked tirelessly ‚Äúto save the world before next Friday.‚Äù His wife, Louise, supported him throughout and moved forward to complete several of his projects following his death.

When one's sexual arousal is based on imagining oneself in another physical form (such as an animal, an infant, or an amputee) the erotic target is said to be one's self, or erotic target identity inversion. The terms \\"erotic target location error\\" and \\"erotic target identity inversion\\" were first used in 1993 by the sexologist Ray Blanchard.  Types  The sexologist Anne Lawrence describes as examples of erotic target identity inversions biological males who experience sexual arousal in response to imagining themselves as women (autogynephilia), as well as at least one case of anatomic autoandrophilia. In The Beauty Myth (1990), Naomi Wolf writes, \\"Women tell me they're jealous of the men who get so much pleasure from the female body; that they imagine being inside the male body that is inside their own so that they can vicariously experience desire.\\" Blanchard writes that whereas gynephilia refers to the sexual preference for women, autogynephilia refers to a male's sexual interest in being a woman. He states that autogynephilia can be associated with gender dysphoria and gender identity disorder, discontent with one's biological sex and the desire to undergo surgery for sex reassignment and permanently take on a role and life of the other sex. A male with sexual arousal based on temporarily taking on the appearance or role of a woman is transvestic fetishism. Several other sexual interests also exist in ETLE forms: Whereas acrotomophilia refers to the sexual preference for amputees, apotemnophilia refers to sexual arousal in association with having an amputation, although both can be experienced at the same time. Apotemnophilia can be associated with the strong belief or desire that one's external body is mismatched to one's true nature, a phenomenon called body integrity identity disorder, and the desire to undergo surgery to remove a limb. People who temporarily adopt the role or identity of an amputee have been called disability pretenders. Whereas zoophilia refers to the sexual preference for animals, autozoophilia refers to sexual arousal in association with being an animal. The sexual attraction to plush animals is termed plushophilia. Anne Lawrence has proposed the terms autoplushophilia for the sexual attraction to being or changing one's body to have plush features, and fursuitism for sexual arousal from wearing a fursuit to temporarily resemble an anthropomorphic animal. Whereas pedophilia refers to the sexual preference for children, paraphilic infantilism refers to the sexual interest in being a child. Lawrence and others have posited parallels between gender identity disorder and apotemnophilia, as well as between gender identity disorder and species identity disorder.  Sexuality in subcultures  There are many subcultures of people who are interested in transforming themselves to various degrees and interacting in their new role or identity. Such interactions can include sexual interactions with other members of the community. There is debate in these communities regarding whether their desire to transform is based on their sexual interests in the new form or based on feeling like they are part animal.  Criticism  In a letter to the editor of The Journal of Sex Research, San Francisco-based physician and activist Charles Allen Moser criticized Lawrence' endorsement of the concept of ETLEs. He noted that \\"there is nothing wrong with creating or expanding a classification system of sexual interests\\" but believed that Lawrence \\"pathologizes nonstandard sexual expression\\" and that \\"ETLEs are a slippery slope,\\" whereas Moser's view is that all sexual phenomena should be removed from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). Lawrence responded that \\"Moser's critiques of the paraphilias rely on fallacious reasoning\\" and that \\"most of his other criticism...results from his having ignored or misinterpreted my statements, either inadvertently or for rhetorical purposes.\\" She indicated that \\"Moser correctly observed that such an unwarranted generalization would lead to ludicrous conclusions; but these would be wholly attributable to Moser's ludicrous misinterpretation of what I actually wrote.\\"  References  Category:Paraphilias Category:Sexual orientation and psychology Category:Sexual disorders Category:Sexual attraction Category:Sexual fetishism Category:Sexual roleplay Category:Words coined in the 1990s ","title":"Erotic target location error"},{"id":"36634473","text":"Creating Hot Chocolate Massage is an album by the folk rock band Tiny Lights, released in 1990 by Absolute A Go Go Records.

Duehring then appeared for Canada at the 2012 UCI Track Cycling World Championships, there she won a silver in the points race before adding a bronze as a member of the team pursuit. She built onto this the next season, where she finished in preparation for the Olympics second in the team pursuit at the Track Cycling World Cup in London in February 2012 and won bronze as a part of the Canada's women's team pursuit at the 2012 Olympics together with Tara Whitten and Gillian Carleton. After winning the bronze Duehring said \\"We were so ready to just go out there and do our best. Team Canada, in coming here, has a saying, ‚ÄòGive Your Everything, and that was kind of our motto ‚Äî leave everything out there.\\" In 2016, she was officially named in Canada's 2016 Olympic team, and again won a bronze medal. Personal Duehring was born in Paderborn, Germany and currently resides in Vancouver, British Columbia. She moved to Canada at the age of eight when her father took a position at Simon Fraser University teaching computer science. She received her Canadian citizenship shortly before the 2012 Olympics.

Agriculture & Nutrition Company (THAN) was a California chemical company. It operated a pesticide-formulating facility from 1962 until 1981 that is now a Superfund site. Other companies formulated pesticides on the site from 1950 to 1962. During the 1950s and 1960s, on-site landfills were used for disposal of wastes generated from site operations, including pesticides from cleaning equipment. Waste was spilled on the surface of the site and left in piles on the ground. Sampling at the site conducted by the California Department of Health Services (CDHS) detected pesticides in soil and groundwater. The site was listed on the Superfund National Priorities List in 1986. Cleanup activities at the site were completed in 2003 and included soil vapor extraction; demolition and removal of various structures; excavation and management of impacted soils; construction of a low-permeability containment cover to minimize the potential for movement of residual chemicals from Site soils to other media; implementation of access controls and land use restrictions; demonstration and maintenance of appropriate financial assurances; monitored natural attenuation of groundwater; provision of as- needed alternative drinking water supplies; and performance of ongoing operation, maintenance, and monitoring activities. Approximately 30,000 people live within 3 miles of the site, with the closest resident being 500 feet from the site. Approximately 35,000 people depend on groundwater as a source of drinking water.

In literature regionalism refers to fiction or poetry that focuses on specific features, such as dialect, customs, history, and landscape, of a particular region (also called \\"local colour\\"): \\"Such a locale is likely to be rural and/or provincial.\\"J. A. Cuddon, A Dictionary of Literary Terms. Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1984, p. 560. Development =Novelists= Haworth parsonage soon after Patrick Bront√´'s death Thomas Hardy's (1840‚Äì1928) novels can be described as regional because of the way he makes use of these elements in relation to a part of the West of England, that he names Wessex. On the other hand, it seems much less appropriate to describe Charles Dickens (1812‚Äì1870) as a regional novelist of London and the south of England. John Cowper Powys has been seen as a successor to Thomas Hardy, and Wolf Solent, A Glastonbury Romance (1932), along with Weymouth Sands (1934) and Maiden Castle (1936), are often referred to as his Wessex novels.Herbert Williams, John Cowper Powys. Bridgend, Wales: Seren,1997, p. 94. As with Hardy's novels, the landscape plays a major role in Powys's works, and an elemental philosophy is important in the lives of his characters. Powys's first novel Wood and Stone was dedicated to Thomas Hardy.New York Arnold Shaw, 1915. Maiden Castle, the last of the Wessex novels, is set in Dorchester, Thomas Hardy's Casterbridge, and which he intended to be a \\"rival\\" to Hardy's Mayor of Casterbridge.Morine Krissdottir's, Descents of Memory: The Life of John Cowper Powys. New York: Overlook Duckworth, 2007. p. 312. Mary Butts was a modernist novelist who works are also associated with the idea of Wessex. \\"Like [John Cowper] Powys, she found a key to both personal and national identity by tuning into the deep history of the Dorset landscape [with emphasis on] sacred places and folk traditions\\".Jonathan Bate, \\"A good, old- fashioned modernist\\". The Telegraph, 26 January 2003 The regional novel is generally seen as originating with Maria Edgeworth and Walter Scott, but their regions are hardily \\"comparable to Hardy's Wessex, Blackmore's Exmoor, or Arnold Bennett's potteries, [... because] they are nations.\\" Liz Bellamy, Regionalism and Nationalism: Maria Edgeworth, Walter Scott and the definition of Britishness. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998, p.54. The term has also been used, in the past, disparagingly, especially with regard to women writers, as a synonym for minor writing.Robin Inboden. \\"Regions of the Imagination: The Development of British Rural Fiction (review).\\" Modern Fiction Studies 34.4 (1988): pp.682-683. Other writers that have been characterized as regional novelists, are the Bront√´ sisters from West Yorkshire. In 1904, novelist Virginia Woolf visited their birthplace Haworth and published an account in The Guardian on 21 December. She remarked on the symbiosis between the village and the Bront√´ sisters. She wrote: \\"Haworth expresses the Bront√´s; the Bront√´s express Haworth; they fit like a snail to its shell\\". Mary Webb (1881‚Äì1927), Margiad Evans (1909‚Äì1958) and Geraint Goodwin (1903‚Äì1942), are associate with the Welsh border region. George Eliot (1801‚Äì1886), on the other hand, is particularly associated with the rural English Midlands, whereas Arnold Bennett (1867‚Äì1931) is the novelist of the Potteries in Staffordshire, or the \\"Five Towns\\", (actually six) that now make- up Stoke-on-Trent. R. D. Blackmore (1825‚Äì1900), was one of the most famous English novelists of the second half of the nineteenth century, and he shared with Thomas Hardy a Western England background and a strong sense of regional setting in his works.Michael Millgate, Thomas Hardy: A Biography (New York: Random House, 1982), 179, 249. Noted for his eye for and sympathy with nature, critics of the time described this as one of the most striking features of his writings. He may be said to have done for Devon what Sir Walter Scott did for the Highlands and Hardy for Wessex. However, Blackmore is now remembered for one work, Lorna Doone. Catherine Cookson (1906 ‚Äì 1998), who wrote about her deprived youth in South Tyneside, County Durham was one United Kingdom's most widely read novelists in the twentieth century. Sid Chaplin (1916‚Äì1986) is another writer from North-east England, who wrote, amongst other things, The Day of the Sardine, published in 1961, which is set in a working-class community in Newcastle upon Tyne, North Tyneside at the very beginning of the 1960s. =Poets= Grasmere in the Lake District, of England, where William Wordsworth lived for 14 years. Amongst poets there is William Wordsworth (1770‚Äì1850), and the other Lake Poets, while the poet William Barnes (1801‚Äì1886) is seen as primarily a Dorset poet, especially because of his use of Dorset dialect. John Clare (1793 ‚Äì 1864) was commonly known as \\"the Northamptonshire Peasant Poet\\". His formal education was brief, his other employment and class-origins were lowly. Clare resisted the use of the increasingly standardised English grammar and orthography in his poetry and prose, alluding to political reasoning in comparing \\"grammar\\" (in a wider sense of orthography) to tyrannical government and slavery, personifying it in jocular fashion as a \\"bitch\\".Asked by his cousin and publisher John Taylor to correct a passage for publication, he answered: \\"I may alter but I cannot mend grammer in learning is like tyranny in government--confound the bitch ill never be her slave & have a vast good mind not to alter the verse in question...\\" (Letter 133). See He wrote in his Northamptonshire dialect, introducing local words to the literary canon such as \\"pooty\\" (snail), \\"lady- cow\\" (ladybird), \\"crizzle\\" (to crisp) and \\"throstle\\" (song thrush). Alfred Tennyson (1809‚Äì1892) has been identified as a Lincolnshire poet, while Philip Larkin (1922‚Äì1985) is principally associated with the city of Hull. Basil Bunting's (1900‚Äì1985) semi-autobiographal poem Briggflatts can be read as a meditation on the limits of life and a celebration of Northumbrian culture and dialect, as symbolised by events and figures like the doomed Viking King Eric Bloodaxe.Poets' Graves ; Basil Bunting (intr. By Richard Caddell), \\"Complete Poems\\". New Directions, 2003. p. 60.

It was built from 1666 to 1670 in the , across the Leine from the (old town), across the river from the , then the courtly residence. The church was designed in Baroque style, probably by the Venetian architect Girolamo Sartorio, the duke's , who didn't follow models but built a hall focused on the sermon. The architect was the duke's Brand Westermann. The building was financed by the duke and the representatives of the Principality of Calenberg, and to a large extent by the early capitalist merchant and banker John Duve. Material from a former chapel of St. Gall in the old town was reused. The church was the burial site for members of the court. Since the original tower was in danger of collapsing, a new tower was erected above the west portal from 1691 to 1700. The landmark has a square base, an octagonal upper floor and a copper- roofed cupola with lantern and apex. , 1850, steel engraving by John Poppel after a drawing by George Osterwald The Neust√§dter Kirche was until 1936 the church of the General Superintendent. Johann Adolf Schlegel was superintendent from 1775 until his death in 1793. In World War II, air raids heavily damaged the church; only the exterior walls remained. A reconstruction was carried out 1956‚Äì58 in simple form, led by Wilhelm Ziegeler. Interior, 2007 A renovation of the interior 1992/94 was closer to the original concept and restored some of the surviving Baroque features. The Baroque interior was not restored completely, but preserved parts of the original furnishings; statues and images of Christ, angels, and saints, as well as allegorical figures, portraits, and monuments, were combined and rearranged with modern elements.  Architecture  The shows the characteristics of a rigorous early Baroque style, still based on antique models. It is one of the oldest Protestant (Aisleless church) in Lower Saxony, conceived for the sermon as the main act of Lutheran church service. It is a long and spacious hall church, which closes to the east with a slightly narrower chancel. It has a large organ balcony to the west and small balconies along the south and north sides. The rich interior decoration was mostly lost in World War II.  Epitaphs  Epitaph of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Since 1902, epitaphs and tombstones which originally covered the floor of the church completely, were placed on the exterior walls, in memory of court officials, court ministers and superintendents with their families. The most important burial sites remained inside, including those of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz who was buried on 14 December 1716, and general Carl August von Alten (1840).  Organs  On the west balcony, a main organ was installed in 1963 by Detlef Kleuker with three manuals and 38 stops. In 2010, the organ was beyond repair and was sold. A new main organ is planned. A temporary movable organ serves in the church. A second organ, called (Spanish organ), was installed on the north balcony 1998‚Äì2001 by Patrick Collon (Belgium). It reflects principles of Spanish Baroque organ building without copying a specific instrument.
