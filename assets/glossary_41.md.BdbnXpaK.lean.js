His feast day is December 29. Biography Ailer√°n was one of the most distinguished scholars at the School of Clonard in the 7th century.Grattan-Flood, William. \\"St. Aileran.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 1. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 20 Sept. 2012 His early life is not recorded, but he was attracted to Clonard by the fame of Saint Finni√°n and his disciples. He became lector of the schoolAilerani Interpretatio Mystica Progenitorum Domini Iesu Christi in 650. He died of the Yellow Plague, and his death is recorded in the Annals of Ulster.Aileran Because of his knowledge of the works of Origen, Philo, St. Jerome, St. Augustine, and others, he was well versed in patristic literature. Works According to John Colgan, numerous works can be ascribed to Ailer√°n, including the Fourth Life of Saint Patrick, a Latin litany, and the Lives of Saint Brigid and Saint F√©ich√≠n of Fore. Ailer√°n's best known work is his mystical interpretation of the Ancestry of Our Lord Jesus Christ, according to the genealogy of Jesus in Saint Matthew's Gospel. This was published in the Benedictine edition of the Fathers, and the editors said that they published it although Aileran was not a Benedictine, because he \\" unfoulded the meaning of the Sacred Scripture with so much learning and ingenuity that every student of the Sacred Volume and especially preachers of the Divine Word will regard the publication as most acceptable.\\"Monasticism in Ireland Another work of his is titled A Short Moral Explanation of the Sacred Names, which could be a fragment of a larger work.

Hadit is the principal speaker of the second chapter of The Book of the Law (written or received by Aleister Crowley in 1904). He may refer to the serpent Apophis, the Kundalini, and the atman.  Descriptions  Hadit identifies himself as the point in the center of the circle, the axle of the wheel, the cube in the circle, \\"the flame that burns in every heart of man, and in the core of every star,\\" and the worshipper's own inner self. Hadit has been interpreted as the inner spirit of man, the Holy Ghost, the sperm and egg in which the DNA of man is carried, the Elixir Vitae. When juxtaposed with Nuit in The Book of the Law, Hadit represents each unique point-experience. These point-experiences in aggregate comprise the sum of all possible experience, Nuith. Hadit, \\"the Great God, the lord of the sky,\\" is depicted on the Stele of Revealing in the form of the winged disk of the Sun, Horus of Behdet (also known as the Behdeti). However, while the ancient Egyptians treated the Sun and the other stars as separate, Thelema connects the sun-god Hadit with every individual star. Furthermore, The Book of the Law says: \\"Every man and every woman is a star.\\" The Book of the Law 1,3 Hadit is the Secret Seed. In The Book of the Law he says; \\"I am alone: there is no God where I am.\\".The Book of the Law II,23 He is \\"the flame that burns in every heart of man, and in the core of every star.\\".The Book of the Law II,6 He is identified with kundalini;the Old Comment to Liber AL vel Legis II:22 says this explicitly in The Book of the Law he says, \\"I am the secret Serpent coiled about to spring: in my coiling there is joy. If I lift up my head, I and my Nuit are one. If I droop down mine head, and shoot forth venom, then is rapture of the earth, and I and the earth are one. There is great danger in me...\\".The Book of the Law II,26-27 Hadit is the Fire of Desire at the Heart of Matter (Nuit). The combination of the upward-pointing triangle of Hadit and the downward-pointing triangle of Nuit forms the Star of Spirit (the Hexagram). The union of the infinitely small Hadit and the infinitely great Nuit causes an explosive rapture which leads to samƒÅdhi.  History  The earlier, Egyptian version, went by the name of Heru-Behdeti or Horus of Behdet (Edfu), Haidith in Greek.see http://www.philae.nu/akhet/NetjeruH.html#Horus Thoth let him take the form of the solar disk to help a younger version of Horus‚ÄîRe-Horakhty, or Ra-Hoor- Khuit‚Äîin a battle with Set and his army. Both versions of Horus appear in the Egyptian image that Thelemites call Stele 666, a Dynasty 25 or 26 offering stele formerly in the Boulaq Museum, but now in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, also known as the Stele of Revealing. Around the time of its creation, Egyptian funerary teachings apparently included \\"the new idea that the deceased could become one with the sun god, previously only a royal prerogative.\\"Kunsthistorisches Museum Vienna, online description of another wooden offering stele.

It is the home venue for the University of Minnesota Golden Gophers of the Big Ten Conference, and is named in honor of Dick Siebert, a former head coach who led the Gophers to three national titles. From 1971 to 1978, the venue was known as Bierman Field in honor of Bernie Bierman. History In 1971, Siebert Field was built to replace the university's former baseball venue, Delta Field, which was located beyond the left field fence of the present facility. Siebert Field, which featured natural grass and a capacity of 1,500, was constructed on a single large block near Dinkytown. The original facility was demolished in 2012 and replaced with a brand new ballpark at the same location. The new facility bears the same name as its predecessor. =Old Siebert Field= The Old Siebert Field hosted its first game on April 23, 1971 ‚Äì a 2‚Äì1 Gopher victory over Creighton. At the time, the ballpark was considered one of the most modern in collegiate athletics, with an electronic scoreboard, automatic irrigation, and a state- of-the-art press box. In addition to serving as the Golden Gophers' primary home venue, the old Siebert Field occasionally hosted other events and teams, including numerous Minnesota State High School League baseball tournament games. In 1994‚Äì1995, Siebert Field was home to an independent professional team, the Minneapolis Loons, of the now-defunct North Central League. Three NCAA Regional tournaments were played there in 1974, 1977, and 2000, respectively, as well as six Big Ten Conference Baseball Tournaments: 1984, 1986, 2000, 2002, 2003, and 2004. The old Siebert Field fa√ßade. As the old Siebert Field aged, its infrastructure, particularly the grandstand, became dilapidated. As a result, the University of Minnesota men's baseball team, which had routinely played cold-weather games at the former Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome (an indoor venue), began favoring the downtown-located Metrodome over Siebert as their primary home stadium. In 2004, the team played the majority of its home games at the Metrodome for the first time ‚Äì a trend that continued until 2010, when all home games were played at the Metrodome (save for one which was played at nearby Target Field). The 2011 schedule also called for the team's home games to be played at the Metrodome; however, the collapse of the Metrodome's roof and the subsequent heavy damage to the stadium forced the Gophers to move elsewhere. Games scheduled in March were moved to other cities or canceled. Twelve home games against Big Ten Conference opponents were moved to Target Field, while three midweek non- conference games were played at Siebert Field. In 2012, the Gophers continued using the Metrodome as its primary home venue, save for one game at Target Field and one game at Siebert Field, the latter of which was held on May 1, and was the final game played at that facility ‚Äì a 9‚Äì2 win over St. Thomas. =New Siebert Field= A groundbreaking was held at the new facility On June 11, 2012, after which the reconstruction project began, including the demolition of the old facility, building of the new grandstands and dugouts, and installation of the new playing surface and Daktronics scoreboard. The new Siebert Field hosted its first game on April 5, 2013, which the Gophers won 7‚Äì0 over Ohio State. Additional upgrades to the new facility are ongoing. Lights were installed prior to the 2014 season, and its first night game was played on April 25. Prospective upgrades, including construction of an indoor training facility, upgraded home and visitor locker rooms, new offices, an umpires‚Äô locker room, and a canopy, have no timetable for completion. Location Siebert Field is located at the intersection of 15th Avenue SE and 8th Street SE in Minneapolis. The block is bounded by 15th Avenue SE and railroad tracks to the northwest and north; 8th Street SE, to the northeast; 5th Street SE, to the southwest; and railroad tracks to the south and southeast. The field itself is set back from 15th Avenue, with a football practice field in between. The facility is adjacent to other University athletic facilities including track-and-field, football, softball, and indoor sports venues. The diamond has an unorthodox southeastern alignment (home plate to center field); the recommended orientation is The elevation of the field is approximately above sea level.

Early life Fitzherbert was born at Swynnerton, Staffordshire. His father having died whilst he was an infant, he was, even as a child, the head of an important family and the first heir born at Swynnerton, where his descendants have since flourished and still remain Catholics. He was trained to piety and firmness in his religion by his mother, and when sent to Oxford in his sixteenth year he confessed his faith with a courage that grew with the various trials, of which he has left us an interesting memoir (Foley, Records of English Province S.J., II, 210). At last he was forced to keep in hiding, and in 1572 he was imprisoned. Marriage and move to France In 1580 he married and had children, but he did not give up his religious works. When Edmund Campion and Robert Persons commenced their well-known mission, Fitzherbert put himself at their service, and helped Campion in the preparation of his Decem Rationes by verifying quotations and copying passages from the fathers in various libraries, to which it would have been impossible for the Jesuit to obtain admission. Unable at last to maintain his position in face of the ever-growing persecution, he left England in 1582, and took up his residence in the north of France. Here, as a lay Catholic of birth, means, and unexceptionable character, he was much trusted by the Catholic leaders, and closely watched by Walsingham's emissaries, whose letters contain frequent insinuations against his ulterior intentions (see Foley, Records of English Province S.J., II, 220-228). His wife died in 1588, and he soon afterwards took a vow of celibacy. He is next found in the household of the young 2nd Duke of Feria, whose mother was Lady Jane Dormer. With him or in his service he lived in Flanders, Spain, Milan, Naples, and Rome for some twenty years, until the Duke died in 1607, on the point of setting out for a diplomatic mission to Germany, on which Fitzherbert was to have accompanied him. It was during this period that he was charged in 1598 by Squire with having tempted him to murder Queen Elizabeth; in 1595 a charge of contradictory implication had been preferred against him to the Spanish Government, viz. that he was an agent of Elizabeth. Both charges led to the enhancement of his reputation. A series of 200 letters from the Duke to him is preserved in the archives of the Archdiocese of Westminster. In 1601, while in Spain, he felt moved to take a vow to offer himself for the priesthood, and he was ordained in Rome 24 March 1602. After this he acted as Roman agent for the archpriest Harrison until he was succeeded, in 1609, by the future bishop, Father Richard Smith. But in 1606 he had made a third vow, namely, to enter the Society of Jesus, which he did about the year 1613. He was soon given the important post of superior in Flanders, 1616 to 1618, afterwards recalled and made rector of the English College, Rome, from 1618 to 1639. He died there, closing, at the age of eighty-eight years, a life that had been filled with an unusual variety of duties.

Comprising a single feature-length pilot and six one-hour episodes, the series deals with life in an idealised fictional English village and stars Robin Nedwell, Diane Keen, Nigel Lambert, Jack Douglas, John Le Mesurier, Bernard Cribbins and Trevor Howard. It was preceded by a feature length pilot episode The Shillingbury Blowers starring Trevor Howard, broadcast 6 January 1980. The series was written by Francis Essex and directed by Val Guest. Unusually for a British situation-comedy at that time it was recorded entirely on location on 16mm film and consequently there was no laughter track. Much of the filming took place in the village of Aldbury in Hertfordshire. The show ended when ATV lost its franchise licence to broadcast and its replacement Central declined to continue production of the series. The series was broadcast in a number of countries around Europe. Episodes =Pilot= *The Shillingbury Blowers (6 January 1980) starring Robin Nedwell Peter (Nedwell) and his wife Sally live in an idyllic half-timbered cottage in the village of Shillingbury. The local brass band, the Shillingbury Blowers, is struggling to survive. A meeting of the village council, headed by John Le Mesurier, looks at the financial position of the band and debate the poor quality of the playing. Peter is brought in to replace the ageing conductor. Peter tells the band they are awful and they walk out. A second meeting of the village council with two band members results in a work-to-rule where the band decide to remove all individuality. Ironically this solves the problem and the band get their first clap. When they reconvene in the pub, The Oddfellows Arms, they resolve to play with further restrictions. When they then decide to play staccato it unintentionally works very well. When the old bandleader Saltie (Trevor Howard) then returns as lead trumpet and plays very melodically this works very well in counterpoint. Peter helps Jake (Jack Douglas), the lead cornet, deliver a calf on his farm and a new bond of trust is formed. However this night time ordeal causes Jake to oversleep and he misses the bus taking the band to a competition. However he catches up in time and convinces the band to cease their work to rule and return to their original style of play, resulting in disaster. =Series 1= *The Shillingbury Tinker (17 May 1981) *The Shillingbury Melon (24 May 1981) *The Shillingbury Cloudburst (31 May 1981) *The Shillingbury Legend (7 June 1981) *The Shillingbury Miracle (14 June 1981) *The Shillingbury Daydream (21 June 1981) Cuffy In 1983, A spin-off sequel series entitled Cuffy was made and broadcast by ATV's successor Central.

Its native inhabitants are almost completely Turkmen.https://unpo.org/article/4053 While no official census data exists, the city which had been assessed to have a population of approximately 200,000, had dropped to 80,000, as of 2007,The Real Surge Story (Washington Post) nearly all of whom are Iraqi Turkmen. In Tal Afar itself, the population is predominantly Turkmen, about 75 percent of whom were Sunni Muslims, while a quarter were Shi‚Äôites. While most residents can speak Arabic, the Iraqi Turkmen/Turkoman dialect of the Turkish language is the most common language used throughout the city. Tal Afar, along with Altun Kupri, Amirli, Bashir, Bustamli, Mahalabiyah, Qarah Tabbah, Sulaiman Bek, Taza Khurmatu, Tuz Khurmatu and Yankjah, make up the largest Turkmen-majority cities in Iraq, while Mosul, Kirkuk, Kifri, Daquq, Miqdadiyah, Jalawla and Saadiyah have significant Turkmen minority populations. This city was captured by the Islamic State in 2014, but was retaken by the Iraqi military in 2017.

Peregrine, Melvin Ember, Inc., Human Relations Area Files, Pg 149.Dictionary of the Ancient Near East, by Piotr Bienkowski, A. R. Millard, Yarim Tepe, 2000, Pg 326 = Assyrian Empire = From perhaps the 25th century BC through to the 7th century AD it was an integral part of Assyria. Tal Afar has been thought to be a city mentioned in the Bible, Telassar or Thela'sar, mentioned in 2 Kings 19:12 and in Isaiah 37:12 as a city inhabited by \\"the children of Eden\\" which was at the time ruled by Sennacherib of Assyria.The People's Bible Encyclopedia, by Charles Randall Barnes, \\"Telas'sar or Thela'sar,\\" 1910, pg 1085 = Ottoman Empire = Austen Henry Layard visited Tal Afar and wrote about his experience there in several of his books. In Nineveh and Its Remains, published in 1867, Layard writes: \\"After Hafiz Pasha's expedition in 1837 Tall 'Afar was occupied permanently by Turkish troops and started to be used as a base to control the movements of a number of the Yazidi tribes of eastern Sinjar. In the 1880s Tall 'Afar became an administrative unit depending on the Sinjar qadha.\\"The Other Kurds: Yazidis in Colonial Iraq, by Nelida Fuccaro, 1999, pg 33. Sometime during the Ottoman Empire, the Ottoman Turkish Army founded the city as a sole military outpost constructed on top of a hill. Remains of the fortress can still be seen today. Also garrisoned at the fortress were Turkmen members of the Daloodi tribe who following the withdrawal of the Ottoman Army became the first civilian occupants of the town built around the fortress. = 1920 revolt = After the fall of the Ottoman Empire, Tal Afar was included in Iraq. In 1920, Tal Afar was used as a base of operations for a planned revolt against the then ruling British.A History of Iraq, by Charles Tripp, Pg. 40 =Role in the 2003 invasion of Iraq= U.S. M1 Abrams battle tanks patrolling Tal Afar on February 3, 2006 Turkish military observers speak with local officials assessing the damages to local infrastructure. During the Iraq War in 2003, insurgents used Tal Afar as a staging point for attacks. = Operation Black Typhoon = On September 9, 2004, a major military operation was launched against Tal Afar by the 3rd Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division (Stryker Brigade Combat Team) and Iraqi Security forces. Fighting continued until September 12, 2004 when the government of Turkey claimed that the fighting had taken the lives of approximately 58 ethnic Turkmen civilians and demanded an end to military operations at which time the civilians camped outside Tal Afar were allowed to return to their homes. American forces defeated the insurgents and left about 500 troops in the city. However, Iraqi authorities lost control of the city in May 2005, and insurgents began taking over again. = Operation Restoring Rights = In September 2005, Operation Restoring Rights was conducted in which approximately 5,000 soldiers from the 3rd Division of the Iraqi Security Force in conjunction with 3,500 troops (Bob Woodward sites the number 5,300 troops in his book \\"The War Within\\") from the U.S. Army's 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment and the 325th Airborne Infantry Regiment, 82nd Airborne Division entered the city. The operation resulted in 157 insurgents being killed and 683 captured. Iraqi Security Forces suffered 12 killed and 27 wounded. The operation lasted until October and resulted in 10,000 pounds of explosives being uncovered and destroyed. Abu Musab al-Zarqawi accused the American military of using \\"poisonous gases\\" on Tal Afar in an audiotape received and posted on an Islamic website. The United States denied using chemical weapons in Tal Afar saying such reports were propaganda created by al-Zarqawi, and were false and without merit.U.S. Forces Not Using Chemical Weapons in Tall Afar, Iraq There was an incident in which US troops wore gas masks after discovering chlorine-based chemicals. The operation tested a new strategy of \\"clear, hold, build\\", in which areas would be purged of insurgents and then occupied and then rebuilt to win support from local people before being handed over to the Iraqi security forces. An ambitious reconstruction effort was immediately implemented. New sewers were dug and the fronts of shops, destroyed in the assault, were replaced within weeks. Numerous police stations were built or rebuilt in the town by an Anglo-American construction team led by Huw Thomas. In March 2006, U.S. President George W. Bush pointed to Tal Afar as a success story, where one could \\"see the outlines of the Iraq we've been fighting for\\". The operation was considered one of the first successful counterinsurgency operations in Iraq. Colonel H.R. McMaster, commander of the operation became an advisor to General David Petraeus in the planning and execution of the 2007 troop surge. However, after years of intermittent violence, some commentators have said that the optimism expressed in 2005 was overstated. = Post-invasion violence = Tal Afar has also been the scene of sectarian violence between Shiite and Sunni Muslims. Before the invasion of Iraq sectarian violence between Turkmens had not been a problem. Their shared cultural background had united Sunni and Shia Turkmens. Political mobilisation in Tal Afar had until then been dominated by the Baath party. With no readily available movement to replace Saddam's Baathists, the collapse of the state disrupting everything from food to security and increasing distrust towards the Shia dominated Iraqi government, tensions started to arise. Grievances were stoked further when Sunni Islamists began to move into the town and Shia Iraqi security forces began purging Sunni's from the police force. In May 2005, clashes broke out between the two groups. In October 2006, a bombing in Tal Afar killed 14 people, of whom ten were civilians and four Iraqi soldiers. An additional bombing, outside a car dealership, on November 24, 2006, killed at least 22 and wounded at least 26. On February 10, 2007 a suicide car bomber killed one Iraqi soldier and wounded five people, including three civilians, as it targeted an army checkpoint. On February 22, 2007 four people were killed, including a policeman and a 12-year-old boy, and five were wounded, including two policemen, when two booby-trapped houses detonated while police were searching homes. During the search, a policeman shot and killed a suspect and wounded two others. Police had already reported the death of one policeman. On March 24, 2007 a suicide bomber in a market in the town killed eight people and wounded ten. On March 27, 2007, a truck bomb exploded in a market in a Shiite area. It was first reported to have killed 83 people and wounded 183, but the Iraqi Interior Ministry later raised the death toll to 152 and said that 347 were wounded, which would make it the deadliest single strike since the war started. The explosion, for which a terrorist group linked to Al Qaeda claimed responsibility, led to reprisal shootings by Shiite policemen and others against Sunnis, in which between 47 and 70 men were killed. Several Shiite policemen were arrested for taking part in the shootings.Iraq Raises Death Toll in Tal Afar Bomb, Guardian, April 1, 2007Deadliest bomb in Iraq war kills 152, Reuters, April 1, 2007Iraq Says Truck Bomb in North Killed 152, New York Times, April 1, 2007Police accused in sectarian revenge killings, CNN, March 29, 2007 On April 14, 2007 a sniper shot dead a woman.

ISIS captured Tal Afar on June 16, 2014, after a two-day battle.Iraqi city of Tal Afar falls to Isis insurgents Martin Chulov, The Guardian, June 16, 2014. = Battle of Tal Afar (2017) = On 20 August 2017, the Iraqi Army announced it had launched a new offensive to retake Tal Afar from the Jihadist forces. On the same day, it recaptured four neighborhoods in Tal Afar (Abra al-Najjar, Abra Hansh, al-Abra al-Kabira, and Abra al-Saghir) The city itself was recaptured by Iraqi forces on August 27, 2017. The remaining ISIS-held areas in Tal Afar district were then fully captured on August 31, 2017. Geography Districts of Nineveh Tal Afar is located approximately 50 km west of Mosul and 60 km east of the Iraqi‚ÄìSyrian border, at coordinate 36¬∞23‚Ä≤N 42¬∞27‚Ä≤E. According to map data, it has a total area of 15 km¬≤. Tal Afar is located in the gap between the anticlines of Jabal Zambar to the southeast and Jebel Sasan to the northwest. The city is located in an open desert plain at the southern base of the Aedea Mountains. Much of the terrain surrounding the city is flat desert. A major east‚Äìwest highway, which spans Nineveh Governorate and intersects Iraq's main central north‚Äìsouth highway near Mosul, runs through the city. The city of Tal Afar is organized into eighteen neighborhoods or districts: Sa'ad, Qadisiyah, Todd A-O, Sara, Mohalemeen, Madlomin, Uruba, Wahada, Nida, A'a lot, Hassan Qoi, Mothana, Khadra, Jazeera, Taliha, Kifah, Malain and Qalah (). Each neighborhood maintains its identity due to the tribal nature of the city. Several dozen extended families living in close proximity will typically identify with one local sheikh who takes it upon himself to serve as steward of the neighborhood's citizens and liaison to the local government. The layout of the town consists of densely packed buildings, often constructed so closely to each other that they share common load-bearing walls and supports. The city's streets further physically define each neighborhood by separating it from other groups of buildings, since they cut through the town in irregular patterns. The United States Army and local government implemented a home address system to better identify specific locations and define jurisdiction for the Iraqi Police in the second half of the 2000s.  Demographics Demographically, Tal Afar is isolated from many of the surrounding towns and villages because of its Iraqi Turkmen population. Many people to the west identify themselves as Yazidis, and to the south and east as Arabs. Many of the Turkmen of Tal Afar have been displaced and moved to areas further south in Iraq ever since ISIL captured the area. Many have also joined Iraqi forces fighting ISIL.Turkey Pulse article on situation of the Turkmen Economy In January 2007, the largest single employer in the city was the Iraqi Ministry of the Interior, which had hired roughly 2,250 policemen. The second-largest employer was the United States government. The 101st Airborne 3rd Brigade was stationed at Tal Afar Airbase in 2003‚Äì04 and its 1st Battalion was stationed in the town proper. Important industries in the region include agriculture, especially the harvesting of wheat, which historically has been processed at the city's state-run granary, and the production of cement and macadam. Unemployment was estimated to be as high as 80 per cent in August 2006. Health There is only one hospital in Tal Afar: Tal Afar General Hospital. In addition, there is the Tal Afar Health Sector, which includes six health centers (clinics) inside Tal Afar, and other clinics in the periphery. Landmarks The Tal Afar Citadel, a ruined Ottoman fortress, is located in the center of the city. Local history states that British administrators augmented the structure of the original fortress. During the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the fortress was further augmented and made to house the city's mayoral, municipal and police headquarters. The neighborhood including and surrounding the fortress is known as Qalah or \\"Castle\\". Large parts of the citadel were blown up by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in December 2014. Culture and society Many residents identify themselves as Iraqi Turkmens/Turkomans and share many similarities with Anatolian Turkish culture. Strong family ties exist between residents of the city and relatives in Turkey. Approximately 20 families live in the city whom identify themselves as Kurdish or Yezidi. Arab culture is also present and many residents don traditional Arab dishdashas and checkered headscarves. Western-style clothing is also common. Cuisine found in the city is similar to meals prepared in Arab/Turkish culture including unseasoned grilled lamb and beef, unleavened bread, rice, vegetable-based soups and vegetables such as potatoes, tomatoes, raisins and cucumbers. Politics and government Tal Afar's local government consists of a city council, local sheikhs and a mayor. The mayor is appointed by the council of sheikhs and confirmed by the provincial regional administrator. The mayor need not be originally from the city nor Iraqi Turkmen. The mayor from 2005 to 2008 was Najim Abdullah Abed al-Jabouri, a Sunni Arab originally from Qayyarah who was married to Maria Constantinescu. The Iraqi Turkmen demographic of Tal Afar and its geographic location have made it an important city in the argument for Iraqi federalism. Following a program of \\"Arabization\\" initiated by Saddam Hussein in the 1970s, large numbers of Sunni Arabs supportive of the Baathist government were moved into areas around Tal Afar. Geographically, the region the city is located in is a border area separating Kurdish lands to the north and Arab lands to the south in the Al Anbar governorate.

Stage version  Sister George is a beloved character in the popular radio series Applehurst, a district nurse who ministers to the medical needs and personal problems of the local villagers. She is played by June Buckridge, who in real life is a gin- guzzling, cigar-chomping, slightly sadistic masculine woman, the antithesis of the sweet character she plays. She is often called George in real life, and lives with Alice \\"Childie\\" McNaught, a younger dimwitted woman she often verbally and sometimes physically abuses. When George discovers that her character is scheduled to be killed off, she becomes increasingly impossible to work and live with. Mercy Croft, an executive at the radio station, intercedes in her professional and personal lives, supposedly to help, but she actually has an agenda of her own. Although it is strongly implied that George and Childie are lesbians, and towards the end it is suggested that Mercy could be as well, this is never explicitly stated. Marcus intended the play to be a farce, not a serious treatment of lesbianism, but because there was so little material about lesbians, it became treated as such. The story is usually regarded as a parody of the killing of Grace Archer in The Archers (an episode much better known at the time the play was written than it would be in the 21st century). It may also have been inspired by the sacking of actress Ellis Powell from Mrs Dale's Diary, and has sometimes been compared with What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?.http://www.uxbridgegazette.co.uk/west-london- lifestyle/whats-on-uxbridge/theatre-uxbridge/2008/07/09/the-killing-of-sister- george-113046-21306075/ review of one production The death of Martha Longhurst (actress Lynne Carol) in the British television serial Coronation Street in 1964 may also have been an inspiration. The Killing of Sister George premiered at the Bristol Old Vic in April 1965, in a production directed by Val May. After a tour, the production moved to the Duke of York's Theatre in London, opening on 17 June 1965, with the original cast including Beryl Reid as June Buckridge, Eileen Atkins as Childie and Lally Bowers as Mercy Croft. In April 1966, the production moved to the St Martin's Theatre. On 5 October 1966, the show opened at the Belasco Theatre in New York, with the original cast of Reid, Atkins, and Bowers. Hermione Baddeley, Andr√©e Melly and Margaret Courtenay took over at the St Martin's. Reid won the 1966 Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Play for the Broadway production. A West End revival in 1995 starred Miriam Margolyes, Serena Evans, and Josephine Tewson. In 2011, a revival at the Arts Theatre in London featured Meera Syal as George. Directed by Iqbal Khan, the cast also included Elizabeth Cadwallader, Belinda Lang, and Helen Lederer. Film adaptation In 1968, the play was adapted into a feature film which was somewhat darker and made the lesbian elements more explicit. Radio adaptation John Tydeman adapted and directed the play for BBC Radio 4. Broadcast on April 25, 2009, Sarah Badel played George, Lucy Whybrow played Childie and Anna Massey played Mercy.

It is a colorless low- melting compound, which is soluble in water, dioxane, and alcohols. The formula for this acid is generally written H3PO2, but a more descriptive presentation is HOP(O)H2, which highlights its monoprotic character. Salts derived from this acid are called hypophosphites. HOP(O)H2 exists in equilibrium with the minor tautomer HP(OH)2. Sometimes the minor tautomer is called hypophosphorous acid and the major tautomer is called phosphinic acid. Preparation and availability Hypophosphorous acid was first prepared in 1816 by the French chemist Pierre Louis Dulong (1785‚Äì1838).Dulong prepared acide hypo-phosphoreux by adding barium phosphide (Ba3P2) to water, which yielded phosphine gas (PH3), barium phosphate, and barium hypophosphite. Since the phosphine gas left the solution and the barium phosphate precipitated, only the barium hypophosphite remained in solution. Hypophosphorous acid could then be obtained from the filtrate by adding sulfuric acid, which precipitated barium sulfate, leaving hypophosphorous acid in solution. See: * Dulong (1816) \\"Extrait d'un m√©moire sur les combinaisons du phosphore avec l'oxig√®ne\\" (Extract from a memoir on the compounds of phosphorus with oxygen), Annales de Chimie et de Physique, 2 : 141‚Äì150. [in French] * Graham, Thomas, Elements of Inorganic Chemistry, 2nd ed. (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: Blanchard and Lea, 1858), p. 316. The acid is prepared industrially via a two step process: Firstly, hypophosphite salts of the alkali and alkaline earth metals result from the reaction of white phosphorus with hot aqueous solution of the appropriate hydroxide, e.g. Ca(OH)2. :P4 \\\\+ 4 OH‚àí \\\\+ 4 H2O ‚Üí 4 \\\\+ 2 H2 The salt is then treated with a strong, non-oxidizing acid to give the free hypophosphorous acid: : + H+ ‚Üí H3PO2 HPA is usually supplied as a 50% aqueous solution. Anhydrous acid cannot be obtained by simple evaporation of the water, as the acid ready oxidises to phosphorous acid and phosphoric acid and also disproportionates to phosphorous acid and phosphine. Pure anhydrous hypophosphorous acid can be formed by the continuous extraction of aqueous solutions with diethyl ether. Reactions and uses Its main industrial use is for electroless nickel plating (Ni‚ÄìP), although it is primarily used as a salt (sodium hypophosphite). Hypophosphorous acid can reduce chromium(III) oxide to chromium(II) oxide: H3PO2 \\\\+ 2 Cr2O3 ‚Üí 4 CrO + H3PO4 Organic chemistry In organic chemistry, H3PO2 can be used for the reduction of arenediazonium salts, converting to Ar‚ÄìH. When diazotized in a concentrated solution of hypophosphorous acid, an amine substituent can be removed from arenes. Owing to its ability to function as a mild reducing agent and oxygen scavenger it is sometimes used as an additive in Fischer esterification reactions, where it prevents the formation of colored impurities. It is used to prepare phosphinic acid derivatives. =DEA List I chemical status= Because hypophosphorous acid can reduce elemental iodine to form hydroiodic acid, which is a reagent effective for reducing ephedrine or pseudoephedrine to methamphetamine, the United States Drug Enforcement Administration designated hypophosphorous acid (and its salts) as a List I precursor chemical effective November 16, 2001.66 FR 52670‚Äî52675. 17 October 2001. Accordingly, handlers of hypophosphorous acid or its salts in the United States are subject to stringent regulatory controls including registration, recordkeeping, reporting, and import/export requirements pursuant to the Controlled Substances Act and 21 CFR ¬ß¬ß 1309 and 1310.21 USC, Chapter 13 (Controlled Substances Act) Organophosphinic acids (Phosphinates) Organophosphinic acids have the formula R2PO2H. The two hydrogen atoms directly bound to phosphorus in phosphinic acid are replaced by organic groups. For example, formaldehyde and H3PO2 react to give (HOCH2)2PO2H. Similarly, phosphinic acid adds to Michael acceptors, for example with acrylamide it gives H(HO)P(O)CH2CH2C(O)NH2. The Cyanex family of dialkylphosphinic acids are used in hydrometallurgy to extract metals from ores. Inorganic derivatives Few metal complexes have been prepared from H3PO2, one example is Ni(O2PH2)2.

This generally light-hearted series was created by comedy writers Laurence Marks and Maurice Gran. The series is set in the East End of London shortly after the Second World War. Upon being demobbed RAF serviceman Harvey Moon, played by Kenneth Cranham, returns home and finds his family involved in various troubles. His wife Rita, played by Maggie Steed, is not interested in resuming their relationship, and works in a seedy nightclub frequented by American servicemen. He becomes involved with the Labour Party and campaigns against the local Hackney branch of the far right Union Movement, after his mother expresses support for the UM albeit briefly. The name of the series is a wordplay on the title of the popular 1908 song \\"Shine On, Harvest Moon!\\" The first series was commissioned and recorded by ATV (the forerunner to Central Television) at their Elstree studios, with the second series recorded in the same studios under the ownership of Central Television and with the remaining series filmed at Central's newly constructed facilities in Nottingham.

The first black woman to graduate from Harvard Medical School, the first woman to graduate in surgery from Harvard Medical School and the first woman to become a member of the Boston Surgical Society, she is known for her opposition to the legalization of abortion and her work as president of the National Right to Life Committee. Personal life and education Born in Pittsburg, Texas, Jefferson was the only child of Millard and Guthrie Jefferson, a Methodist minister, and a school teacher. Her parents divorced before 1976 and lived in Roxbury after their divorce. Jefferson was raised in Carthage, Texas, in the Wesley-Calvinist tradition. Note, this is the first part of the article, which is continued on page A17. At a young age, \\"Millie\\" followed the town doctor around on his horse drawn buggy while he made housecalls, this would later inspire her to become a doctor. She earned her bachelor's degree in three years from Texas College. Since she was considered too young to attend medical school, she went to Tufts University where she received her master's degree in biology. She then went on to Harvard Medical School and graduated in 1951, becoming the first black woman to do so. Jefferson married in 1963 to Shane Cunningham, whom she met on a skiing trip, a real estate manager. As of 1976, the couple lived in Back Bay and had no children. Career Jefferson achieved board certification in surgery in 1972. After graduating from medical school, she did a surgical internship at Boston City Hospital, becoming the first woman to do so. She was also the first female doctor at the former Boston University Medical Center. By 1984, Jefferson was a general surgeon at the Center and a professor of surgery at the Boston University School of Medicine. Note - this is the first section of the news article; part 2 appears on p. 2B. She would later become the first woman to become a member of the Boston Surgical Society. Pro-life work Mildred Jefferson meeting with Ronald Reagan, 1981 One root of Jefferson's opposition to abortion was her dedication to the Hippocratic oath, which morally bound her to the preservation of life. Her interest in abortion issues was triggered when she was asked to sign a petition opposing a resolution proposed by the American Medical Association supporting liberalization of abortion-related laws. It was around 1970 when Jefferson became one of the founders of Massachusetts Citizens for Life. She later helped found the National Right to Life Committee (NRLC). In 1971, she became a member of the NRLC board of directors. She became the vice president of the National Right to Life Committee in 1973 and then was elected as chairman of the board the following year. Mildred then was elected as president of NRLC, serving three terms from 1975 to 1978. Jefferson concurrently wrote a column, \\"Lifelines\\", in the National Right to Life News publication. In 1975, Jefferson was the first witness for the prosecution in the manslaughter case levied against Kenneth Edelin for his performance of a legal abortion. It was in 1980 that Jefferson helped the National Right to Life Committee start a political action committee because she believed it was important to lobby and support pro-life candidates for office. While a Republican, she helped Democrat Ellen McCormack run for the Democratic Party presidential nomination in 1976. Apart from NRLC, Jefferson served on boards of directors of more than 30 pro-life organizations. Jefferson is also noted for changing Ronald Reagan's stance on abortion from pro-choice to pro-life. He wrote to her in a letter, \\"You have made it irrefutably clear that an abortion is the taking of a human life, I am grateful to you.\\" Political activities and positions Jefferson supported the one issue, pro-life 1975‚Äì6 campaign of Ellen McCormack for president and appeared in television advertisements for McCormack. Jefferson was a self-described \\"Lincoln Republican\\" and served on the 1980 Massachusetts Reagan for President Campaign. Jefferson had first met Reagan in 1973 while he was governor of California. She also unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination for the 1982, 1990, and 1994 U.S. Senate elections. Jefferson opposed the Equal Rights Amendment on the basis that it is unnecessary as the Constitution has no in- built inequity. She for years called for a constitutional amendment to reverse the 1973 Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade, rejecting the notion that abortion is a private matter between a woman and her physician. Jefferson has also expressed opposition to welfare and busing, and support for the death penalty. Death Jefferson died in her Cambridge home on October 15, 2010, at the age of 83 years. She was divorced and had no children. She was buried in her hometown of Carthage, Texas.

It is a mathematical domain where, instead of viewing processes in the time domain modeled with time-based functions, they are viewed as equations in the frequency domain. It is used as a graphical analysis tool in engineering and physics. A real function f in time t is translated into the s-plane by taking the integral of the function multiplied by e^{-st} from 0 to \\\\infty where s is a complex number with the form s = \\\\sigma+i\\\\omega. :F(s) = \\\\int_{0}^\\\\infty f(t) e^{-st}\\\\,dt \\\\;  \\\\; s \\\\; \\\\in \\\\mathbb{C} This transformation from the t-domain into the s-domain is known as a Laplace transform and the function F(s) is called the Laplace transform of f. One way to understand what this equation is doing is to remember how Fourier analysis works. In Fourier analysis, harmonic sine and cosine waves are multiplied into the signal, and the resultant integration provides indication of a signal present at that frequency (i.e. the signal's energy at a point in the frequency domain). The Laplace transform does the same thing, but more generally. The e^{-st} not only captures the frequency response via its imaginary e^{-i\\\\omega t} component, but also decay effects via its real e^{-\\\\sigma t} component. For instance, a damped sine wave can be modeled correctly using Laplace transforms. A function in the s-plane can be translated back into a function of time using the inverse Laplace transform :f(t) = {1 \\\\over 2\\\\pi i}\\\\lim_{T \\\\to \\\\infty}\\\\int_{\\\\gamma-iT}^{\\\\gamma+iT} F(s) e^{st}\\\\,ds where the real number \\\\gamma is chosen so the integration path is within the region of convergence of F(s). However rather than use this complicated integral, most functions of interest are translated using tables of Laplace transform pairs, and the Cauchy residue theorem. Analysing the complex roots of an s-plane equation and plotting them on an Argand diagram can reveal information about the frequency response and stability of a real time system. This process is called root locus analysis.

Variations of the plea for greeting cards on his behalf in 1989 are still being distributed through the Internet, making the plea one of the most persistent urban legends.  Background  In 1988 Craig Shergold began complaining of earaches. After antibiotics were unsuccessful in treating his symptoms, in 1989 doctors diagnosed him, at the age of nine, with what they considered terminal brain cancer.  Greeting card campaign Shergold's friends and relatives began a chain letter campaign requesting individuals to send greeting cards to him with the goal of beating the Guinness Book of World Records for 1,000,065 greeting cards received. Craig received greeting cards from all over the world including celebrities like Madonna and Arnold Schwarzenegger. The Children's Wish Foundation became involved in the campaign in the early stages and quickly became overwhelmed by the volume of cards being received, though they later disavowed any connection with the chain letter campaigns. The campaign was successful and Shergold's name was added to the 1991 Guinness Book of World Records as having received 16,250,692 get-well cards by May 1990, and again in the 1992 Guinness Book of World Records as having received 33 million cards by May 1991.  Treatment successful  Shergold's cancer worsened. His British doctors estimated he might only have a few weeks of life remaining and suggested the family bring him home for the last few weeks. American billionaire John Kluge, founder of Metromedia, learned of Shergold's illness and arranged for him to travel to the US for a new type of operation. He was operated on in 1991 at the University of Virginia Medical Center, where a physician was able to remove virtually all of the tumor except for a benign fragment. Shergold grew into a healthy adult.  Chain letter popularity  Even after his recovery, the chain letter continued to circulate and millions of greeting cards continued to flow to Shergold's home. Shergold estimated that by 1998, he had received a total of 250 million cards. Variants of the chain mail changed Shergold's name to \\"Craig Shelford\\", \\"Craig Stafford\\", \\"Craig Shefford\\", \\"Greg Sherwood\\", or, a version particularly popular in Poland, \\"Draing Sherold \\". Another variant involves requests for business cards. A related chain letter which retained Shergold's address (in a somewhat corrupted form) asked secretaries and heads of Polish public institutions and local authorities to send get-well cards to a \\"Harold Sarid\\". The Royal Mail gave their home its own postal code because of the volume of mail they received. To avoid the deluge of mail, the family halted mail delivery and later moved.  Legacy  Since 1989, Shergold has received approximately 350 million greeting cards. As an adult, Craig does not make any public appearances other than to express his new wish-for the mail to stop. , he continues to receive cards, sent to his old address. The Make-A-Wish Foundation also states on their website that they do not engage in chain letters or telemarketing activities and also denies any involvement in fulfilling Shergold's original wish, stating that it was done by another wish- granting organization. Any mail that is received is forwarded to a recycling center.  In popular media  In 1993, Shergold's mother, Marion, wrote a book about her son's story entitled, Craig Shergold : A Mother's Story. On 10 November 2001, PAX TV aired a made-for-TV movie, The Miracle of the Cards. The movie starred Thomas Sangster as Shergold and also featured Kirk Cameron as a cynical reporter.  World record retired  Guinness World Records has retired the record and requested that individuals no longer respond to any requests for greeting cards.

It is a heavily used, 4-lane divided highway, with the exception of a short 18 km section in the southeastern corner of the province. It is the main link between southern Manitoba's largest cities, and also serves as the province's main transportation link to the neighbouring provinces of Saskatchewan (to the west) and Ontario (to the east). The highway is the only major east-west divided highway in Manitoba, and carries a large majority of east-west traffic within and through the province. It has full freeway status sections at Portage la Prairie and Winnipeg. The total distance of the Trans- Canada Highway in Manitoba is approximately . PTH 1 is a very important part of the national highway system. It is the only road that links the province of Manitoba (and thus the entirety of Western Canada) with the province of Ontario, making it a major section of Canada's primary commercial and leisure route for all traffic travelling between Canada's largest cities, from Toronto and Montreal in the east to Calgary and Vancouver in the west.  Routing  south-western Manitoba near Carberry. The highway is routed from west to east across the province of Manitoba. It begins at the western provincial boundary with Saskatchewan, connecting with Saskatchewan's Highway 1 to become Manitoba Trans-Canada 1. The highway is designated as T-C 1 throughout Manitoba until it reaches the eastern provincial boundary with Ontario, where it continues as the main route to Kenora, Ontario and the rest of Eastern Canada as Highway 17. The entire length of the Trans-Canada Highway in the province of Manitoba is a 4-lane divided highway, with the exception of the Winnipeg city route and an 18 kilometre section in eastern Manitoba between the town of Falcon Lake and the Manitoba-Ontario provincial boundary which is a two-lane highway. PTH 1 has full expressway status on the routes around Winnipeg on the Perimeter Highway, and around Portage la Prairie. Plans do exist to bring the entire length of PTH 1 (except the Winnipeg city route) to full expressway status in the future (mentioned at the list of Manitoba expressways). Currently, exit numbers only exist at three interchanges,Exits 318, 348, & 375 and only small sections of PTH 1 and the Perimeter Highway have freeway status. In the Winnipeg metro area, the Trans-Canada Highway has two official routes. The main route passes directly through the city of Winnipeg on city streets, entering the city from the west and continuing along Portage Avenue, Broadway, Main Street, Queen Elizabeth Way, St. Mary's Road, St. Anne's Road, and Fermor Avenue where it re-joins the Perimeter Highway (T-C 100) and continues east on TC 1. An alternate routing exits the main T-C 1 route on the western edge of Winnipeg onto the Perimeter Highway (T-C 100), which by-passes the city completely. The Perimeter Highway is a ring road which encircles Winnipeg and is frequently used by commuters and through traffic on the Trans Canada Highway wishing to avoid congested city streets.  History  The \\"Manitoba Welcome/Bienvenue\\" sign, entering Manitoba from Saskatchewan at the provincial boundary on TCH 1. The first Provincial Trunk Highways in Manitoba were numbered in 1926. The original Highway 1 was one of nine highways fanning out from Winnipeg, but was different in that it fanned out from the west and the east. Highway 1 was routed via many already-existing highways and provincial secondary roads. (From west to east), these are: *Highway 1A into and out of Brandon *Provincial Road 351 into and out of Carberry *Highway 1A through Portage la Prairie *Highway 26 from Portage la Prairie to Headingley *Highway 9 from downtown Winnipeg to Lockport *Highway 44 from Lockport to Whiteshell Provincial Park In 1949, Highway 1 had been rerouted on new construction northeast of Griswold, with the part of old route from Highway 21 to Highway 28 (as well as Highway 28 itself) becoming part of Highway 21, and the section from Highway 21 eastward being removed from the system, but later becoming PR 455. By the early 1950s, Highway 1 had become an important east-west route in all of the western provinces. Most of the provincial highways that Highway 1 originally traversed on were re-numbered and designated as Highway 4 between 1958 and 1968, and the #1 was relocated to its present route. In 1962, the Trans-Canada Highway in Manitoba was fully completed, and Highway 1 across all of the western provinces was incorporated as part of the Trans-Canada Highway. In 1955, most intra-city traffic in the Winnipeg area was diverted onto the (then) newly built Perimeter Highway. Later that year, the Perimeter Highway's southern (PTH 100) section was merged with the Trans-Canada Highway system, due to the amount of traffic using it to bypass the city. That section of the highway was highly used, and still is today. = Recent developments = On October 6, 2006 the Trans-Canada Highway Portage la Prairie by-pass was closed due to a structural defect found in the bridge over the CN Rail Line. On October 31, 2007, a $19 million project to rebuild the bridge was completed, and the by-pass was fully re-opened to traffic. On October 25, 2007, a major federal/provincial construction project twinning the highway in western Manitoba between the Saskatchewan-Manitoba provincial boundary and the town of Hargrave was completed, with of newly divided highway lanes opened to traffic. On April 9, 2008, the Government of Manitoba announced that construction of a new interchange would begin in the summer of 2008 at the intersection of Highway 16 (the Yellowhead Highway) and the Trans Canada Highway mainline route, located a short distance west of Portage la Prairie. This project has been delayed and its current status is unknown. Speed limits Westbound driving from Kenora, Ontario to Winnipeg, near Lorette (East of Winnipeg) On February 27, 2008 the Manitoba Highway Traffic Board approved a request by the Government of Manitoba to raise the speed limit on the Trans Canada Highway in Manitoba to 110 km/h along the section between the Saskatchewan-Manitoba provincial boundary and Winnipeg. The speed limit was officially raised on July 1, 2009, though it was only raised on one portion of the highway between the Saskatchewan provincial boundary to Virden. On June 2, 2015, the speed limit between Virden and Headingley increased to 110 km/h, except at Brandon, Carberry, Portage la Prairie, and Elie, where speed is reduced due to major intersections at those locations.

He has been a member of many bands (Kriminella Gitarrer, Garbochock, Ebba Gr√∂n & Imperiet), usually as the lead singer. Stry was born in √Ñngelholm and grew up in southern Sweden. In 1963, when he was 6 years old, his family moved to Liberia in western Africa, where his father had gotten a job working for SIDA, Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency. They moved back to Sweden in 1966. In the early 1970s, Stry's interest in music grew rapidly. He bought his first guitar and played in a small band called Riot. In the summer of 1976, Stry went to London with his girlfriend at the time. There he saw the Sex Pistols. When he returned to Sweden, inspired by the Sex Pistols, he formed the punk rock band Kriminella Gitarrer (Criminal Guitars). They recorded a couple of songs and received some attention. At this time Stry was conscripted to do military service, and after that he moved to Malm√∂ City where he formed the band Bes√∂karna (the Visitors). The band got some attention, but in 1979 Stry formed the band Garbochock which was much more successful. In the spring of 1980, Garbochock's first and only album was released. Soon after this, Stry was invited to move to Stockholm and joined the punk rock band Ebba Gr√∂n, which was the most famous and successful Swedish rock band at the time. Stry took his notebook with 100 songs and joined Ebba Gr√∂n. He would have a great influence on the band's third and last album, simply named Ebba Gr√∂n. He had already written a song called Stockholms p√§rlor (Stockholm's Pearls) for Ebba Gr√∂ns second album K√§rlek och uppror. When Ebba Gr√∂n broke up in 1983, Stry joined the band's lead singer Th√•str√∂m in forming the new rock band Rymdimperiet, later renamed Imperiet. Imperiet, inspired by synth and the new sounds of the 1980s and still inheriting a lot of the punk sound from Ebba Gr√∂n, became one of Sweden's must popular and successful bands at that time. But after only one year with Imperiet, Stry decided to leave the band and moved back to Malm√∂. He now formed the more modest rock band Babylon Blues which released three albums. In 1987 Stry became father to a son named Kalle, but he also lost his own father who died of lung cancer. In 1991, Stry released his first solo album called Plast√•lekrik. Since then he has recorded a couple more solo albums, some with songs in English. He usually recycled many of his own songs, having used them in different versions with different bands. Although Stry has been the member of so many bands, including two of Sweden's most successful and popular bands ever (Ebba Gr√∂n and Imperiet), Stry himself has never achieved any fame. Financially he has been unstable, but he has managed to get by on royalties and occasional petty jobs.

Fill dirt is usually subsoil (soil from beneath topsoil) and underlying soil parent material which has little soil organic matter or biological activity. Fill dirt is taken from a location where soil is being removed as a part of leveling an area for construction; it may also contain sand, rocks, and stones, as well as earth. Fill dirt should be as free of organic matter as possible since organic matter will decompose creating pockets of empty space within the fill which could result in settling. Uneven or excessive settling of the fill can result in damage to any structures built on the fill. A common use of fill dirt is in highway maintenance to build up the shoulders of highways so that the ground on either side of the pavement is at the same level as the pavement itself and that the highway shoulders are sufficiently wide as to allow vehicles room to pull off of the highway if needed. A second common use of fill dirt is to fill in a low-lying construction site to raise the level of the building foundation in order to reduce the chances of flooding. Several massive uses of fill dirt are with improvements to the Port of Seattle Sea-Tac Airport, the addition of a new runway to the Hartsfield- Jackson Atlanta International Airport in Atlanta, Georgia, and the Kansai International Airport off the coast of Osaka, Japan, a project involving the creation of a new man-made island of some five square kilometers. Fill dirt is most often mined from commercial sand and gravel mines then imported to the project site, and must meet specifications for gradation outlined by the Project's Geotechnical Engineer. The logistics and availability of fill dirt material has become a growing concern for the commercial sand and gravel industry in recent years as the need for fill material has surged and the available resources in mines are depleted. This directly impacts the public and end-user as the cost of construction increases due to the logistical challenges of importing material from greater distances as materials grow more scarce. In an effort to combat the costs and increasing logistical challenges related to dwindling sand and gravel stockpiles, some services are offering contractors and the public a way to exchange fill dirt materials in addition to locating operating sand and gravel mines. Internet based services allow consumers and contractors a way to locate free fill dirt by connecting them with another contractor or consumer in need of a dump site on a nearby project. Fill dirt is also used for landscaping projects which involve the creation of ridges and earth structures for pools, waterfalls, and other water features as well as to break up a level area in order to provide more interesting textures to the landscape.

He began work as a telegrapher for the Montreal Telegraph Company (acquired by the Great North Western Telegraph Company in 1881 and finally merged into Canadian National Telegraph in 1915) and became their agent in Peterborough, Ontario. In 1861, he became an agent for the Canada Life Assurance Company. He served seven years as mayor of Peterborough and accumulated real estate in that area. In 1878, he became president of the Midland Railway of Canada, later leasing it to the Grand Trunk Railway. In 1884, he founded the Central Canada Loan and Savings Company, moving to Toronto in 1888 and becoming president of the Canadian Bank of Commerce in 1890. During the 1890s, he was involved in the purchase of the Toronto Globe and the Toronto Evening Star. In 1896, he was appointed to the Senate of Canada by Sir Wilfrid Laurier.

He graduated from the 23rd class of the Army War College in 1911. He was an outstanding student, and was awarded the Emperor's Sword on graduation. In 1913, he traveled to Germany for further studies, and from there went on to Great Britain. On 7 August 1923, he became a battalion commander in the 4th Regiment of the Imperial Guard of Japan. From 26 July 1927 to 1 August 1930 he served as military attach√© to Great Britain. On his return in 1930, he was made regimental commander of the 2nd Regiment of the Imperial Guard. In 1935, he was made a member of the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff. From 1936-1937, he was superintendent of the Army War College, and on 2 August 1937, he was promoted to lieutenant general, commanding the IJA 8th Division. On 31 January 1939, he retired from active duty and was placed on the reserve list.Ammenthorp, The Generals of World War II However, with the start of the Pacific War, Maeda was recalled to active service, and assigned command of the Borneo theatre of operations on 6 April 1942. In September of that year, he was killed in an air crash flying to Labuan Island which was renamed for him during the period of the Japanese occupation. He was posthumously promoted to the rank of full general. Maeda's former home built in 1929 in Komaba, Meguro, Tokyo, survives today as the historic centerpiece of Komaba Park.

The People's assessors are chosen from the general population, similar to the jury system. Over the years, the number of offenses eligible for the death penalty and the type of convicts eligible for it have been reduced.

Although the total number of categories of crime qualifying for capital punishment declined during this time, Presidential Decree No. 21, issued on 21 October 1997, added \\"terrorism\\" to the list of capital offenses. When the Criminal Code was updated in 1999, the number of capital offenses was further reduced. This reduction was assisted by the introduction of life imprisonment in December 1997. Since March 1, 1994, women are ineligible for capital punishment and persons under the age of 18 at the time of the crime or over 65 at the time of sentencing have been exempt from capital punishment since January 2001. Those who are mentally ill may have their death sentence commuted. Under Article 84 of the Constitution, the president \\"may grant pardons to convicted citizens\\". From June 30, 2003 to June 30, 2005, President Alexander Lukashenko granted two pardons to death row inmates and denied one such request. In 2000, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe condemned \\"in the strongest possible terms the executions in Belarus and deplores the fact that Belarus is currently the only country in Europe where the death penalty is enforced and, moreover, is regularly and widely enforced\\".Legisltationline.org Death Penalty ‚Äì Belarus . Published November 2004. Retrieved May 29, 2007. Belarus is the only European country to have carried out executions in the 21st century. European Council members suggested in 2001 that Belarus abolish capital punishment before it can apply for membership in the Council. Belarus (as the Byelorussian SSR) signed the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in 1973.United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. Signatory nations of the ICCPR . Retrieved May 29, 2007. This convention, however, does not abolish the death penalty, but it imposes certain conditions on its implementation and use. Method Before being executed, all prisoners on death row are transferred to Minsk Detention Center No. 1 (–°–ò–ó–û, or SIZO No. 1), in the country's capital Minsk. The method used to carry out the sentence is execution by shooting. The executioner is a member of the \\"committee for the execution of sentences,\\" which also chooses the area where the execution will take place. According to the book The Death Squad by Oleg Alkayev (–û–ª–µ–≥ –ê–ª–∫–∞–µ–≤), on the day of execution the convict is transported to a secret location where he is told by officials that all appeals have been rejected. The convict is then blindfolded and taken to a nearby room, where two staffers force him to kneel in front of a bullet backstop. The executioner then shoots the convict in the back of his head with a PB-9 pistol equipped with a suppressor. According to Alkayev, \\"The whole procedure, starting with the announcement about denied appeals and ending with the gunshot, lasts no longer than two minutes\\".Gypsy Laborer Faces Execution In Belarus CBS News, October 13, 2009 After the sentence is carried out, a prison doctor and other officials certify that the execution has been performed and a death certificate is prepared. The remains of the condemned are buried secretly, and the family is notified that the execution has taken place. Col. Oleg Alkayev, who was a director of SIZO No. 1, claimed that about 130 executions took place at the prison between December 1996 and May 2001, when he left Belarus to live in exile in Berlin, Germany. The United Nations Human Rights Committee issued the following opinion of the execution process in Belarus after the mother of subsequently executed prisoner Anton Bondarenko petitioned the Committee to spare her son's life: \\"[the process has] the effect of intimidating or punishing families by intentionally leaving them in a state of uncertainty and mental distress‚Ä¶[and that the] authorities‚Äô initial failure to notify the author of the scheduled date for the execution of her son, and their subsequent persistent failure to notify her of the location of her son‚Äôs grave amounts to inhuman treatment of the author, in violation of article 7 of the Covenant [prohibiting torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment].\\"  Number of executions  The following is a rough estimate of number of executions carried out since 1985, as per Belarusian Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD): *1985 ‚Äì 21 ‚Äì Byelorussian SSR *1986 ‚Äì 10 *1987 ‚Äì 12 *1988 ‚Äì 12 *1989 ‚Äì 5 *1990 ‚Äì 20 *1991 ‚Äì 14 *1992 ‚Äì 24 *1993 ‚Äì 20 *1994 ‚Äì 24 *1995 ‚Äì 46 *1997 ‚Äì 46 *1998 ‚Äì 47 *1999 ‚Äì 13 *2000 ‚Äì 4 *2001 ‚Äì 7 *2007 ‚Äì at least one *2008 ‚Äì at least 4 *2009 ‚Äì 0 *2010 ‚Äì 2 *2011 ‚Äì 2Execution of Belarus death row prisoner confirmed Amnesty International on July 26, 2011, accessed on August 31, 2011. *2012 ‚Äì 1 *2013 ‚Äì 3 *2014 ‚Äì 3 *2015 ‚Äì 0 *2016 ‚Äì 4 Amnesty International on 30th November, 2016. *2017 ‚Äì 2 *2018 ‚Äì 4 *2019 ‚Äì 2 The exact number of people executed in Belarus is not known, since the last documents released by the Belarusian Government were in 2006.

Public opinion In a 1996 referendum, one of the seven questions asked was about abolishing the death penalty. According to the results of this referendum, 80.44% of Belarusians were against abolition. However, at the time of the referendum, the longest available prison sentence was 15 years. Since then the sentence of lifelong imprisonment was introduced (in December 1997). There have not been more recent surveys to determine whether the change in maximum prison sentence affected public sentiment about the death penalty. More recently a parliamentary special working group announced plans to conduct a public opinion poll, but the Information and Analytical Center with the Administration of the President took over this undertaking. The Center has released its report, ‚ÄúPublic Opinion about the Activity of the Organs of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Belarus,‚Äù which included the questions about death penalty and the attitudes of Belarusian citizens about abolition of capital punishment. That poll showed only 4.5% of the respondents were against capital punishment in all cases, 79.5% considered capital punishment appropriate punishment for at least some grave crimes and about 10% had difficulty answering these questions or offered no opinion.Prudnikova, Olga (2010) ‚ÄúThe Question Connected with Death Punishment Will Be Solved After the Elections?‚Äù Svobodnye Novosti Plus, 11.08.2010‚Äì18.08.2010, p. 12: (www.naviny.by) There have been several steps taken toward reducing the imposition of the death penalty in Belarus.

The series records the exploits of a teenage girl, Georgia Nicolson, and her best friends, the Ace Gang. Her first and second novels, Angus, Thongs and Full-Frontal Snogging and It's OK, I'm Wearing Really Big Knickers were portrayed in a film adaptation called Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging. She also wrote a series of books about Georgia's younger cousin, The Misadventures of Tallulah Casey. Her one-woman live show Stevie Wonder Felt My Face won acclaim in the 1980s; her other shows were Bob Marley's Gardener Sold My Friend and Never Eat Anything Bigger Than Your Head.  Early life  Rennison was brought up in Leeds, Yorkshire, in a three-bedroomed council house in Seacroft with her mum, dad, grandparents, aunt, uncle (Robin) and cousin. She attended Parklands High School, an all-girls school, from the age of 11, which she later credited with inspiring her as a comedic writer. When she was 15, her family moved to Wairakei, New Zealand, where she became pregnant and had a daughter, whom she placed for adoption. On returning to the UK, Rennison lived in a small flat in Notting Hill doing an assortment of jobs until she decided to pursue her dream of acting and enrolled in a Performing Arts course at the University of Brighton. In Brighton, she was part of Liz Aggiss and Billy Cowie's dance company, Divas, performing in their 1986 show, Torei en Veran Veta Arnold!.'List of Works', Aggiss and Cowie (eds) Anarchic Dance, Routledge 2006, p.174 With 'Barmy' Jane Bassett, Joanna Boyce and Sarah Tompkinson she created a female cabaret group, Women with Beards, that poked fun at men and why they are responsible \\"for all the ills of society.\\" Rennison and Bassett later performed as a double act, called Etheldreda.  Career  Rennison's first major success was her one-woman autobiographical show, \\"Stevie Wonder Felt My Face.\\" She went on tour performing this show, including at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, and the BBC later produced a one-off special of it. She began to write for Woman's Hour on Radio Four, for comedians, and for a London newspaper. Her newspaper column was written about whatever personally interested her, such as how pointless it is to date over 35, and led to an invitation from Picadilly Press to write a teenage diary book. They said her writing was \\"so self-obsessed and so childish\\" that she would be perfect to write such a book. Rennison's first novel, Angus, Thongs and Full-Frontal Snogging, was published in 1999 and became a worldwide bestseller, translated into 34 languages. Being her first novel, she used real names of people from her childhood as she wrote and forgot to change the names before the book was published. As a result, childhood friends were able to recognise themselves in the stories. Rennison said that she wrote not in an attempt to teach, but to make herself laugh. She said, \\"I wanted Georgia to be a decent person. I wanted her to be someone who is a bit stupid and self-obsessed and difficult and funny and rude, and a bit jealous and all those other things. But I wanted her to have a good heart.\\" Rennison also said that her books were not just for teenage girls, but aimed to have a \\"potential resonance beyond the young.\\" In particular, Rennison often brought feminist ideals into her writing. She wanted her books to get girls talking and deciding for themselves what they wanted to do and who they wanted to be, rather than letting men decide for them. Rennison wrote a number of sequels to Angus, Thongs and Full-Frontal Snogging, and in 2010 began a second series based on Georgia's cousin, The Misadventures of Tallulah Casey. Her death was announced on 29 February 2016 by her publisher HarperCollins.  Recognition  Angus, Thongs and Full- Frontal Snogging won the Nestl√© Smarties Book Prize Bronze Award in 1999, and was named a Printz Honor Book in 2001. In 2004, the fourth book in the series, Dancing in my Nuddy-Pants topped The New York Times Best Seller list. In 2008, she was named \\"Queen of Teen\\". Rennison was also rewarded with the Roald Dahl Funny Prize in 2010 for the first book in The Misadventures of Tallulah Casey series, Withering Tights. In 2008, her \\"Angus, Thongs and Full-Frontal Snogging\\" was adapted into a movie by Gurinder Chadha. In the same year, she was a recipient of the Queen of Teen award. Despite the positive reception of her novels, Rennison faced interrogation from teachers and parents about her content. Often when she visited schools she was well received by the students, but the staff complained to her about the topics she discussed in her novels. Rennison rarely apologised for her writing. She sought out 14-year-old girls to talk with them about what they would want to read and wrote that. Her response to these teachers was, \\"Surely they know what to expect, they know [my books are] all about boys and snogging and all those experiences. What else am I going to talk about?\\"  Publications  = Confessions of Georgia Nicolson = # Angus, Thongs and Full-Frontal Snogging (1999) # It's OK, I'm Wearing Really Big Knickers (UK title) / On the Bright Side, I'm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex God (US title) (2001) # Knocked Out by my Nunga-Nungas (2002) # Dancing in my Nuddy-Pants (2003) # ...And That's When It Fell Off in My Hand (UK title) / Away Laughing on a Fast Camel (US title) (2004) # ...Then He Ate My Boy Entrancers (2005) # Startled by His Furry Shorts (2006) # Luuurve is a Many Trousered Thing (UK title) / Love is a Many Trousered Thing (US title) (2007) # Stop in the Name of Pants!

In this, 'Georgia gives her top tips on how to look cool and how NOT to behave if you want to hang on to your Sex God'. A spin-off, titled How To Make Any Twit Fall in Love With You, was made available in instalments in 2011 through SugarScape. The books detail events in the life of a teenage girl named Georgia Nicolson as she grows up in England, along with a group of her close friends known as 'the Ace Gang.' The story is told autobiographically, through Georgia's journal. The majority of plotlines explored in the series follow Georgia and her friends' relationships with boys. A continued theme is Georgia's inability to choose between her initial boyfriend Robbie, the Italian Masimo, and her close friend Dave. The books also narrate the relationships of the rest of the Ace Gang, in less detail, and the impact the main antagonist of the series Lindsay has on these relationships. A continual source of humour within the series derives from Georgia's family; her liberal mother, embarrassing father and grandfather, and eccentric younger sister, along with infamously bald Uncle Eddie. Violent pet cats Angus and Gordy provide additional storylines throughout the series. Georgia's use of language is somewhat unusual. A glossary is featured in the back of each novel to explain the meaning of her many peculiar phrases, such as 'red-bottomosity' (Georgia's term for unfaithfulness in relationships), as well as things, people or concepts that international readers may not be familiar with, such as Rolf Harris. = The Misadventures of Tallulah Casey = * Withering Tights (2010) * A Midsummer Tights Dream (2012) * The Taming of the Tights (UK title) / Wild Girls, Wild Boys, Wild Tights (US title) (2013) References  External links  * Confessions of Georgia Nicolson * BBC Slink interview Louise Rennison answers fans' questions on writing and the Georgia Nicolson books * Louise Rennison interview by Heidi Henneman, BookPage and ProMotion, April 2003 * Louise Rennison Official Fan Page * Category:1951 births Category:2016 deaths Category:20th-century English novelists Category:21st-century English novelists Category:Alumni of the University of Brighton Category:Confessions of Georgia Nicolson Category:English children's writers Category:English humorists Category:English women comedians Category:Place of death missing Category:Writers from Leeds Category:Women humorists Category:People from Seacroft ","title":"Louise Rennison"},{"id":"2614585","text":"A view of Holworthy from Harvard Yard Holworthy Hall, in Harvard Yard, Cambridge, Massachusetts, is a historic dormitory for first-year students at Harvard College. History the entryway of Holworthy East Holworthy was named in 1812 in honor of a wealthy English merchant, Sir Matthew Holworthy, who died in 1678 having bequeathed ¬£1,000 to Harvard -- then the largest donation in the college's history -- \\"for the promotion of learning and the promulgation of the Gospel\\" in Cambridge. When it opened on August 18, 1812, then-President John Thornton Kirkland of Harvard referred to it as \\"Holworthy College.\\" It did not have indoor plumbing; for almost a century, students had to go outside to use the college's pump. Rent was $26 per year. Until 1860, Room 24 served as the library of Harvard's chapter of the Phi Beta Kappa Society and also housed the librarian, who kept the chapter's several hundred books in his study closet. The dorm was originally used for all classes, as evidenced by famous residents like Thomas Bulfinch and Horatio Alger being housed in it multiple times, but was predominantly used for housing seniors during its early existence. By the turn of the 20th century, the senior classes expressed a desire to formally make the oldest Yard buildings -- first Holworthy, then Hollis and Stoughton -- their own and petitioned the college administration to make Holworthy a senior-only dormitory. By the hundredth anniversary of the dorm in 1912, about 1,300 men had lived in Holworthy. By 1904, Holworthy was fully a senior dorm. Although it was not considered as fashionable as some of the newer dorms, Holworthy and its neighbors on the Yard became the center of student life on campus. It also became known for housing many of the most prominent students within the college's social life, including athletic team captains and managers, Lampoon presidents (including Robert Benchley '12, who spoke at Holworthy's centennial dinner), Advocate presidents, and the leaders of the college's various musical groups. By the 1910s, the New York Times reported that Holworthy's \\"record of men afterward illustrious who have occupied its rooms is probably longer than any similar list possessed by any other college building,\\" making it the \\"pet\\" dorm of seniors. With the other freshman dormitories in the Yard, Holworthy joined the Harvard‚ÄìYale sister colleges arrangement in 2005, when Harvard's freshman dormitories -- which are not otherwise formally affiliated with Harvard's residential houses -- became associated with Harvard houses and their counterparts among Yale University's residential colleges. Holworthy was paired with Hollis Hall to become part of Winthrop House's affiliation with Davenport College at Yale. Past residents Holworthy is notable for having been the freshman dorm of several writers and producers of The Simpsons who graduated in the 1980s -- Al Jean '81, Bill Oakley '88, Conan O'Brien '85, and Mike Reiss '81. O'Brien referenced his time in Holworthy during his Class Day speech to the Harvard Class of 2000. * Henry Adams, journalist and novelist, Room 5 * James Barr Ames, former Harvard Law School dean, Rooms 14 and 20 * Horatio Alger, novelist, Rooms 07, 18, and 24 * George Bancroft, statesman and historian, Room 24 * Robert Benchley, humorist and actor, Room 23 * Thomas Bulfinch, writer and mythographer, Rooms 09 and 16 * Joseph Hodges Choate, lawyer and diplomat, Room 21 * William Gardner Choate, judge and Choate School founder, Room 21 * Adam Clymer, journalist, Room 18 * Richard Henry Dana, Jr., lawyer and politician, Room 13 * Charles William Eliot, former Harvard president, Room 11 * Robert Grant, novelist, Room 9 * Christian Herter, politician, Room 15 * David Halberstam, journalist, Room 19 * Holworthy Hall, pseudonym of writer H.

It has a CAA Public Use Aerodrome Licence that allows flights for the public transport of passengers or for flying instruction. Founded in 1910, it is the oldest airport in the UK and the oldest purpose-built commercial airport in the world.Bloom, Nick. \\"Sunny Shoreham\\", Pilot, February 2012, p70 It is now owned by Brighton City Airport Ltd (BCAL). The 1930s Art Deco terminal building designed by R Stavers Hessell Tiltman is listed grade II*. The airport is west of Shoreham-by-Sea at Lancing in the Adur district of West Sussex. It is situated immediately to the south of the A27 road, between Brighton and Worthing, and immediately to the north of the West Coastway railway line. History Interior of the terminal building View of Runway 02 from the West Coastway railway line =Foundation= The first aviator to fly there was Harold H. Piffard in 1910; a memorial garden celebrates his flight. The aerodrome was officially opened on 20 June 1911. The first flying school opened in 1913. =First World War= During the First World War the aerodrome was used by the Royal Flying Corps. It was the departure point for some of the earlier flights, using Bl√©riotsRoyal Flying Corps WW1 Bl√©riot XI reconnaissance monoplane  and BEs, to join the conflict across the Channel.Bloom, Nick. \\"Sunny Shoreham\\", Pilot, February 2012, p71 =Inter-war period= The aerodrome became an airport for the adjacent towns of Brighton, Hove and Worthing. It was officially opened on 13 June 1936 under the name Brighton Hove and Worthing Joint Municipal Airport. The new terminal building was built in 1936 and was designed by Stavers Tiltman in the Art Deco style. The terminal building is still in use and was designated a Grade II* listed building in 1984. In 1937 one of the local flying schools received a contract to train pilots for the Royal Air Force and was known as No. 16 Elementary and Reserve Flying Training School initially using the de Havilland Tiger Moth which were later supplemented by the use of the Hawker Hart and Hind. With the start of the Second World War the training school moved away from Shoreham in August 1939.Brooks 1996, pp. 123‚Äì130 =Second World War= The airfield started the Second World War in civilian hands until a detachment of Westland Lysanders of 225 Squadron arrived in July 1940 to undertake coastal patrols. With the nearby RAF Tangmere damaged by air raids the Fighter Interception Unit with the Bristol Beaufighter moved to Shoreham although they had problems with the grass runway. In October 1940 422 Flight arrived with the Hawker Hurricane operating as night-fighters. By October 1941 both units had moved away from Shoreham. The airfield was regularly attacked during July and August 1941 and the next unit to arrive was No 11 Group Target Towing Flight in October 1941. Westland Lysanders were used to tow targets for fighter squadrons to practice air- firing. Lysanders and later the Supermarine Walrus were also based for search and rescue duties. In December 1941 a detachment of Hawker Hurricane fighters from 245 Squadron arrived at Shoreham to support the Tangmere-based squadrons. By August 1941 the fighters had moved on and only the 277 Squadron remained in the search and rescue, the Lysanders were replaced by the Boulton Paul Defiants in May 1942. In February 1943 the Defiants were replaced by Supermarine Spitfires and in April 1943 the airfield became a practice camp to RAF Regiment gunners in the anti-aircraft role. Lysanders appeared again but this time to tow targets for the regiment gunners. A gunnery training dome was built on the northern perimeter of the airfield that still survives into the 21st Century. In April 1944 No. 345 (Free French) Squadron arrived with Spitfires to support the preparation for the Normandy invasion; the squadron was active on D-Day over the beaches and escorting glider formations. No 345 Squadron moved out in August 1944 and 277 Squadron in October 1944 and the airfield went into care and maintenance and was little used for the rest of war. The airfield was bombed several times and a Messerschmitt Bf 109 was shot down by ground fire during one such attack, crash-landing near the terminal building. A B-17 Flying Fortress crash-landed at the airfield after being damaged during a raid on Germany. The consequent damage to the old guardhouse on the north side of the airfield can still be seen. =Post-Second World War= The landing area was entirely grass until a tarmac runway was built in 1981. In 1949, F G Miles Engineering Ltd moved to Shoreham from Redhill Aerodrome and soon occupied the repaired Municipal Hangar. Beagle Aircraft Ltd (British Executive & General Aviation Ltd) was formed at Shoreham on 7 October 1960 and design drawings were begun a few weeks later for a new prototype twin-engine light transport aircraft. Built as the Beagle B.206X at Beagle's Rearsby factory near Leicester, this promising new type was completed at Shoreham and first flown by John Nicolson on 15 August 1961. Beagle Aircraft Ltd was nationalised in late 1966 and taken over by the British Motor Corporation but later entered receivership in late 1969 and soon closed down. In 2006, due to mounting debts the airport was sold by the local authority to a property company on a 150-year lease. It was intended that the airport would provide increasing commercial flight activity for the conurbation on the coast nearby, particularly the city of Brighton & Hove. The pre-war municipal hangar was listed Grade II in July 2007. =Present= The airport is used by privately owned light aeroplanes, flying schools, and for light aircraft and helicopter maintenance and sales. A number of operators provide flying lessons, sight-seeing and pleasure flights, including the experience of flying in two T-6 Harvard World War II training aircraft. On 2 May 2014, Brighton City Airport Ltd (BCAL) took ownership of the airport and its operations, which at the time was named Shoreham Airport, taking over from Albemarle. Once the takeover was completed, the airport was officially renamed as Brighton City (Shoreham) Airport. =Wild Life Festival= Since June 2015, Wild Life Festival, a live music event developed by Disclosure and Rudimental has been held at Brighton City Airport. RAFA Shoreham Airshow Fairey Swordfish torpedo bomber at 2011 airshow. The airport used to host the Royal Air Forces Association (RAFA) Shoreham Airshow (for around 25 years). On 22 August 2015, a Hawker Hunter jet fighter taking part in the airshow crashed onto the A27 road just outside Brighton City Airport, killing 11 people, and the show has not been held since. Facilities Brighton City Airport There is one terminal building at the airport, together with flight indicator boards announcing all arrivals and departures, a live runway camera and a licensed restaurant called The Hummingbird Restaurant and Cafe. The airport houses Northbrook College's engineering department ‚Äì a Centre of Vocational Excellence (CoVE) in Aerospace and Aviation. A number of aerospace and aviation and non-aviation commercial businesses have offices and workshops on the airport site and along the perimeter road. The largest operator is Flying Time Aviation, providing integrated commercial pilot training, with a fleet of Diamond Aircraft DA40s and DA42s. The visitor centre features exhibits about the airport's history and area aviation history, a library and archive of related historic materials and guided tours of the airport.  Ground transport  The airport is served by Shoreham-by-Sea station on the West Coastway Line, distant. A halt, Bungalow Town Halt, had been opened in 1910, just in front of the main building. In 1935 its name was changed to Shoreham Airport. The station closed in 1940.  Airlines and destinations  Various air taxi companies are based at the airport. Brighton City Airways operated out of the airport to Paris Pontoise airport but ceased operations in 2013 after encountering problems setting up a point of entry at the French airport.  South East Air Support Unit  The South East Air Support Unit formerly operated from Brighton City Airport. Previously Sussex Police Air Operations Unit, the unit moved in summer 2007 to Dunsfold Park, west of Gatwick Airport, before moving to its present base at Redhill Aerodrome in autumn 2013.  Shoreham Airport RFFS  The Shoreham Airport Rescue and Firefighting Service provides a professional fire-fighting capability at the airport during operating hours. Headed by a senior airport fire officer, the service's two watches (Blue Watch and Red Watch) man two fire appliances. The service has operated at the airport continuously for over 90 years. Brighton City Airport's aircraft fuelling service is operated as a department of the Rescue and Firefighting Service. There are three large mobile fuel bowsers for delivering both avgas and jet fuel to aircraft, including a service (accompanied by fire appliances) for fast delivery of fuel to police and coastguard emergency helicopters without disengaging their engines. Fuel technicians are attached to the firefighting watches and work the same shift pattern  Film appearances  Due to its listed period facilities and art deco main building, Brighton City Airport has been used by film-makers seeking to portray a small town airport, or also for historical reconstructions of airport scenes from the 1930s onwards. The airport has appeared in the Netflix TV series The Crown and three episodes of Agatha Christie's Poirot (\\"The Adventure of the Western Star\\", \\"Death in the Clouds\\" and \\"Lord Edgware Dies\\"). External shots of the airport were also used in the films The Da Vinci Code and Woman in Gold. The airport was used in the feature-length documentary Angel Without Wings and A Dark Reflection.

Located next to the Alberta Legislature Building, the bridge linked the separate communities of Edmonton and Strathcona, which became one city in 1912. It was designed from the outset to accommodate rail, streetcar, two-way automobile, and pedestrian traffic. The original bridge design included three tracks on the upper deck (one CPR track with one streetcar track on either side). The first CPR train (a passenger service) operated on June 2, 1913, after which the bridge became a part of the Calgary- Edmonton main line. Streetcar service started on the west streetcar track of the bridge on August 11, 1913 (at 11 am) with the east streetcar track opening by September of that year and automobile traffic after that. Automobile traffic did not begin at the same time as CPR and streetcar traffic as the lower deck had not been completed and the installation of galvanized iron under the tracks was still needed to prevent cinders dropping from steam trains onto traffic on the lower deck. Streetcars travelling northbound operated on the upstream side of the bridge, and southbound streetcars operated on the downstream side of the bridge; This left-hand operation was contrary to the right-hand driving on the lower traffic deck. The bridge was transferred to the ownership of the City of Edmonton in 1994 and designated a Municipal Historic Resource in 1995. Trucks are prohibited on the bridge due to the low clearance of and substandard lane width. Currently street traffic is one-way southbound. At the north end of the bridge, 109 Street enters into the left lane, and 110 Street enters into the right lane. The next bridge downstream, the Walterdale Bridge, is a three-lane bridge with one-way northbound traffic into downtown. The last Edmonton Transit System operated streetcar travelled over the bridge on September 1, 1951 and the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR), responsible for the design of the bridge, ceased rail operations over the span in 1989. The upper deck contains only the one middle track now, which is currently used only by the High Level Bridge Streetcar, a historic streetcar route that travels from the Strathcona Streetcar Barn & Museum, just north of the Strathcona Farmers Market, in Old Strathcona, to Jasper Plaza south of Jasper Avenue, between 109 Street and 110 Street, in downtown, with three intermediate stops. High Level Bridge under construction, 1912 or 1913 Modifications On November 19, 1980 two-way traffic on the High Level and Walterdale bridges changed to one-way traffic (northbound for the Walterdale Bridge, and southbound for the High Level Bridge) as a part of \\"Project Uni\\", with the intentions of better utilizing the two bridges. As trolley buses formerly traveled in both directions over the Walterdale bridge, this required the addition of electrical wires above the traffic deck on the High Level Bridge to facilitate these buses. Trolley bus service started on the bridge on May 4, 1981, after the addition of the wires. The wires were suspended from a wide corrugated panel that prevented the poles on the buses from getting damaged by the bridge members if they were to become disconnected. After trolley bus service was discontinued in 2009, the electrical wires and panel supporting trolley bus operation on the bridge were removed. Extensive repairs and the addition and widening of pedestrian sidewalks were completed in 1994‚Äì95. The original lead paint on the bridge was carefully removed, and over 100,000 litres of paint were used to recoat the girders. Completion of new suicide barriers in July 2016 have lowered suicide attempts by 50 percent. However, the barriers, which ended up appearing to be twice the width of the initial approved design and placed on the inside of the existing shared use path railing, reduced the west shared use path width to and the east shared use path to a substandard width of . A feasibility study commissioned by the city found that it would be \\"marginally feasible\\" to widen the existing shared use paths on the bridge, at a cost of approximately $23.7 million, however no changes have been approved. An engineering study released in February 2018 explained that, even though the bridge was built to support freight trains, it would not be able to structurally support modifications to allow a new LRT line to be built on the top deck, due to corrosion. This led to the city placing a hold on plans for the future Centre LRT Line to cross the North Saskatchewan. By the time the City of Edmonton took ownership of the bridge, the main trusses had lost approximately 44 percent of their width due to rust. Repainting and other maintenance of the bridge slowed the corrosion; It is estimated that during the last 25 years the trusses have lost only an additional 5 percent of their widths. Railway stringers and floor beams on the top deck have lost approximately 42 percent and 50 percent of their original widths, respectively. Even though the bridge cannot support additional load, the bridge was still deemed safe for the current load. In April 2013, a campaign called \\"Light the Bridge\\" was launched, with the aim of covering the bridge with LED lights so it can light up on special occasions. The campaign raised approximately $2.5 million for the project, which was unveiled on July 1, 2014. The official lighting of the bridge was synchronized to the tune of \\"O Canada\\", played by the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra and broadcast on CKUA radio. The lights are capable of displaying many different colours and are often programmed to coordinate with local events, such as green and gold for games played by the Edmonton Eskimos. =Great Divide Waterfall= The Great Divide Waterfall during the annual sourdough raft race, July 2001 In 1980 the Great Divide Waterfall by artist Peter Lewis was added to the structure for Alberta's 75th anniversary. The man-made waterfall dropped from the top of the bridge, (7 m higher than Niagara Falls) into the North Saskatchewan River at a rate of 50,000 litres per minute. It operated during holiday weekends in the summer months until 2009 when it was shut off after consultation with Environment Canada. From roughly April 2012 to April 2013, city council deliberated on whether or not it should re-open the waterfall, and in 2013, $735,000 was allocated for \\"Great Divide waterfall refurbishment\\". As of 2014, the city has all but scrapped the plans to refurbish the waterfall, citing the estimated $2.6 million price tag as too high. The final decision to decommission the waterfall was stayed until fall 2014, as public reaction was gauged and community fundraising options were considered. In 2016, city council voted against the removal of the pipes for the waterfall. While there are no current plans to reactivate the falls, the decision to leave the pipes in place allows for that possibility in the future. The waterfall remains a part of the City of Edmonton's Public Art Collection.

(Hall)\\", The Crimson, April 5, 2007The other, the Wren Building at the College of William and Mary, has been destroyed by fire three times, and rebuilt. As such, it possesses great significance not only in the history of American education but also in the story of the developing English Colonies of the 18th century. Massachusetts Hall was designed by Harvard Presidents John Leverett and his successor Benjamin Wadsworth. It was erected between 1718 and 1720 in Harvard Yard. It was originally a dormitory containing 32 chambers and 64 small private studies for the 64 students it was designed to house. During the siege of Boston, 640 American soldiers took quarters in the hall. Much of the interior woodwork and hardware, including brass doorknobs, disappeared at this time. While designed as a residence for students, the building has served many purposes through the years. After Thomas Hollis donated a quadrant and a 24-foot telescope in 1722, for example, the building housed an informal observatory. Massachusetts Hall is the oldest surviving building at Harvard College. Currently, the President of the University, Provost, Treasurer, and Vice Presidents have offices that occupy the first two floors and half of the third. Freshmen reside in the fourth floor. Massachusetts Hall, as Harvard's oldest extant dormitory, has housed many influential people. Founding fathers who lived in Massachusetts Hall include John Adams, John Hancock, Samuel Adams, Elbridge Gerry, and James Otis. Members of the Wigglesworth, Weld, Thayer, Eliot, and Lowell families (among others), whose names now grace other dormitories, also lived in Massachusetts Hall.

Later Slovak and Hungarian name was adopted from Turkish Cigerdelen Parkani (1543) ‚Äì \\"the fortress stabbing to the liver of the enemy\\". It was given its current name after World War II and is named after the 19th century Slovak national leader, ƒΩudov√≠t ≈†t√∫r.

History P√°rk√°ny and Esztergom in 1664 Pedestrian zone in ≈†t√∫rovo The town was inhabited in the prehistoric ages, thanks to its favourable location. It was an important river crossing, and part of the Limes Romanus system named as Avanum during Roman rule. In the 16th century, after the Turks conquered Buda in 1541, the town, along with Esztergom, came under the Ottoman rule. Many attempts to retake the town from the Turks followed, but they were unsuccessful except 1595‚Äì1605 period, until 1683, when the Turks lost a battle near P√°rk√°ny which became referred to as Ciƒüerdelen (\\"Liver driller\\" in Turkish) during the Ottoman rule. During the reign of Maria Theresa, the town regained its rights and became a district town. In 1850, P√°rk√°ny became a station on the railway between Pressburg (, now Bratislava) and Budapest. In 1895, the M√°ria Val√©ria bridge to Esztergom was opened. After World War I, the town became a border town of Czechoslovakia. In 1938, as a result of the First Vienna Award, P√°rk√°ny and parts of Southern Slovakia were occupied by Hungary. It was liberated in the years 1944/1945 by Soviet troops. The M√°ria Val√©ria bridge was destroyed for a second time (first time in 1920) by retreating German forces. After World War II, with the annulment of the Vienna Awards, the town became a part of Czechoslovakia again. It was renamed to ≈†t√∫rovo in 1948. The formerly independent villages of N√°na and Obid were merged with the town in 1960 and 1972 respectively. ≈†t√∫rovo ceased to be the seat of a separate district in 1960 and was merged into the new larger Nov√© Z√°mky District. The postwar industrialisation period saw a major pulp and paper processing plant opened - the Juhoslovensk√© celul√≥zky a papierne (South Slovakian Pulpwood and Paper Works) in 1968, employing some 4,000 people. A new thermal swimming resort Vada≈° was built in 1978. The local railway station became the second largest in Slovakia (1975). After the Velvet Revolution, N√°na (1990) and Obid (1998) became separate villages again. The M√°ria Val√©ria bridge to Hungary was rebuilt for the third time and opened in 2001, boosting the local economy. Border crossing Czechoslovak passport stamp from ≈†t√∫rovo (1980). Pre-Schengen passport stamp from ≈†t√∫rovo. Until 21 December 2007 when both Slovakia and Hungary became part of the Schengen Area, ≈†t√∫rovo was a major border crossing between Slovakia and Hungary, with Esztergom located on the Hungarian side of the River Danube. The two cities are linked by the M√°ria Val√©ria bridge. The road bridge is some in length and is named after Archduchess Marie Valerie of Austria, (1868‚Äì1924), the fourth child of Emperor Franz Josef, and Elisabeth. The bridge was originally opened on 28 September 1895 but was destroyed twice. On 22 July 1919 the bridge was destroyed by a detonation at its first pier on its western side but the bridge was renovated in 1922 and completely reconstructed in 1926. During World War II, retreating German troops blew up the bridge on 26 December 1944 along with other bridges near Esztergom. Decades of intransigence between the Communist governments of Hungary and Czechoslovakia meant that the bridge was not rebuilt until the new millennium, finally reopening on 11 October 2001. Half the costs of the project were covered by a 10 million Euro grant from the European Union, as part of the EU PHARE project to assist applicant countries in their preparations to join the EU. ≈†t√∫rovo was also a major railway border crossing between Slovakia and Hungary as it is on the main Bratislava-Budapest railway line.

These new energy technologies include areas of interest such as renewable energy, CO2 capture and storage, hydrogen storage and electrocatalysis. It has the support of four major companies - ExxonMobil, General Electric, Schlumberger, and Toyota. Under the heading \\"Grand Challenge\\", it identifies a global warming- related need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through future energy development. Targeted goals 1\\\\. Identify promising research opportunities for low-emissions, high-efficiency energy technologies. 2\\\\. Identify barriers to the larger scale application of these new technologies within the project. 3\\\\. Conduct fundamental research into technologies that will help to overcome these barriers and provide the basis for large-scale applications. 4\\\\. Share research results with a wide audience, including the science and engineering community, media, business, governments, and potential end-users. Research overview More than 200 Stanford University faculty members are involved in the program. With students, technicians and others who are actively engaged at the tasks at hand, Stanford's Global Climate and Energy Project focuses on traditional issues like renewable energy, fossils and nuclear energy, energy storage, grid modernization and its environmental impact. There are several separate research projects being conducted but all share the same common goal, which is to develop new technologies to support the decline of greenhouse gases and carbon emissions. Stanford awarded projects =Nighttime radiative cooling: Harvesting the darkness of the universe= A device was created that generated electricity for night time use to allow heat to radiate into outer space. This project was awarded by one of Stanford's top projects because it opened up and exposed large temperature differences between earth and space. This allowed light to be released at night without any electrical inputs or battery-powered technology. =Electrochemical tuning of electronic structures to create highly active electrocatalysts= The project was created to tackle metal catalysts for a cheaper cost and separate water into oxygen and clean burning hydrogen fuels. The research study was done using lithium to enrich hydrogen production. This was done with several catalytic materials and applied physics to reach the common goal for tuning electronic structures into active electrocatalysts. Results of project 10-year anniversary After 10 years, the Stanford Global Climate Energy Project has helped support up to 80 research programs within Stanford's internal research and have expanded it to 38 others across the world. One example of the program's success is a 2007 study of artificial photosynthesis by Caltech scientist Nathan Lewis, Harry Gray and Harry Atwater who developed Joint Center on Artificial photosynthesis. This was a development towards artificial solar fueled technology. Stanford University's president John Hennessy said \\"We sat back and realized that energy was going to be a really big research topic for the university...GCEP was the beginning of that process, Stanford is a place where the idea of taking on a big challenge is not only OK, but expected.\\" =Awarding $9.3 million for innovative energy research= The GCEP was awarded a $9.3 million research project on energy funded technology to be developed over six new research based projects. Including Stanford University, four other universities are involved in the positive development of this energy project. Sally Benson, a professor for energy resources engineers at Stanford University said \\"These six projects are potential game changers that could help transform our global energy system in the future.‚Äù References External links * GCEP homepage *Stanford News on GCEP * Category:Energy development Category:Sustainable energy ","title":"Global Climate and Energy Project"},{"id":"2614680","text":"Pliva headquarters in Zagreb Azithromycin, also known as Sumamed, is one of the world's best-selling antibiotics.

Biography =Early years= Kuzma Petrov-Vodkin was born in Khvalynsk (Saratov Oblast) into the family of a local shoemaker. His first exposure to art was in his early childhood, when he took some lessons from a couple of icon painters and a signmaker. Still, Petrov-Vodkin didn't quite see himself in art at that time; after graduating from middle school, he took a summer job at a small shipyard with plans to get into railroad college in Samara. After failing his exam, he turned to \\"Art Classes of Fedor Burov\\" in 1896 In April 1895, Burov died and for some time Petrov-Vodkin took different painting jobs in the vicinity of Saratov. By chance, his mother's employer invited a well-known architect, R. Meltzer. Petrov-Vodkin was introduced to the guest and impressed him enough to get an invitation to study art at Saint Petersburg. The education was financed by a charitable subscription among local merchants. He also met at this time Borisov-Musatov, an important painter resident in Saratov, who encouraged Petrov-Vodkin to continue his studies. Petrov-Vodkin stayed in Saint Petersburg from 1895 to 1897 studying at the Baron Stieglits School, before moving to the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture. There Petrov-Vodkin was a student of Valentin Serov, Isaak Levitan and especially Konstantin Korovin. In 1901 he travelled to Munich to take classes with Anton A≈æbe. He graduated in 1904. =Beginning of independent work (1899-1912)= The iconic work of Petrov-Vodkin - \\"Bathing of a Red Horse\\". While in Paris in 1906 he met and married Maria Jovanovic (1885‚Äì1960), a daughter of Serbian immigrant hotel-keepers. She remained his lifelong companion. They had two daughters, one of whom died [unverified] in childhood. Even during his college years, Petrov-Vodkin managed to enter into conflict with the Russian Orthodox Church, which discarded his work on a chapel in Samara and ultimately destroyed it as unacceptable. A number of his early works were deemed too erotic. His first well-known work was The Dream (1910), which sparked a discussion among contemporary Russian artists. The main defender of the painting was Alexandre Benois; his main detractor was Ilya Repin (hence, Petrov-Vodkin was discussed by two of the major Russian painters of the time). Other major works of that time include Boys at play, and, notably, Bathing of a Red Horse, (1912) his most iconic work - a symbol of the coming social changes. The latter became an instant classic, and, in a sense, trademark for the artist. During this stage in his artistic development, Petrov-Vodkin extensively used an aesthetic of Orthodox icon together with brighter colours and unusual compositions. His works were often deemed blasphemous and erotic. =Maturity (1912-1928)= 1922 portrait, Anna Akhmatova From 1924 to 1926 Petrov-Vodkin lived in France with his family. In 1922 he painted a portrait of the Russian poet Anna Akhmatova. During his earlier years, Petrov-Vodkin developed his \\"spherical perspective\\": a unique twist that distorted the drawing as to represent the viewer high enough to actually notice the spherical curve of the globe. He used it extensively through his works like Death of a Commissar and In the Line of Fire, which make the observer seem more distant, but actually close. It is argued that this twist has been built upon Byzantine perspective - an inverted perspective used in iconography. Petrov-Vodkin used darker tones with time, but his paintings became more detailed. He started painting still life and portraits, stepping further away from his previous themes. With help from the Soviet government, he made several trips across the Soviet Union, producing many works with didactic purposes. =Later years (1928-1937)= In 1927, Petrov-Vodkin contracted pulmonary tuberculosis and had to curtail painting for several years. He turned to literature and wrote three major semi-autobiographical volumes, Khlynovsk, Euclid's Space and Samarkandia. The first two of these are considered on a par with the finest Russian literature of the time. In the spring of 1932 the Central Committee of the Communist Party decreed that all existing literary and artistic groups and organizations should be disbanded and replaced with unified associations of creative professions. Accordingly, the Leningrad Union of Artists was established on 2 August 1932, which brought the history of post-revolutionary art to a close. The epoch of Soviet art began. Petrov-Vodkin was elected the first president of the Leningrad Union of Artists in 1932. Petrov-Vodkin's other important pieces during this period include 1919. Alarm. (1934). In February 1939, Petrov-Vodkin died of tuberculosis in Leningrad. Legacy Until the mid-1960s, Petrov-Vodkin was nearly forgotten in the Soviet Union after his curtailment of painting and turn towards writing. Petrov-Vodkin writings were republished in the 1970s to a great acclaim, after a long period of neglect. His most famous literary works are the 3 self-illustrated autobiographical novellas: \\"Khlynovsk\\", \\"Euclidean Space\\" and \\"Samarkandia\\". The second of these is of particular importance, as it transmits Petrov-Vodkin worldview as an artist in great detail. Petrov-Vodkin also gave professional support to Rachel Kogan, who was his prot√©g√© and friend. The largest collection of Petrov-Vodkin's works is in the Russian Museum in St Petersburg, where, as of 2012, a whole room in the permanent exhibition is devoted to the painter. A memorial museum was also set up to Petrov-Vodkin in the house he built for his parents in his home town of Khvalynsk. It displays a selection of his works, as well as works by other Khvalynsk painters.Art and Memorial Museum of Kuzma S Petrov-Vodkin, listing at the Artist's Studio Museum Network http://artiststudiomuseum.org/studio- museums/art-and-memorial-museum-kuzma-s-petrov-vodkin/  See also  * Fine Art of Leningrad References  External links  * VIRTUAL TOUR Kuzma Petrov-Vodkin.

The stories featuring them were drawn first by Neville Main, then by Bill Mevin and finally by John Canning. They first appeared in the story The Klepton Parasites (issues 674 to 683). They began by looking for their grandfather, the Doctor, in a junkyard. This paralleled the events of the television series' first episode \\"An Unearthly Child\\", although in the strip, the junkyard was at No. 16 instead of No. 76. The Doctor did not appear to have met them prior to their first appearance, but they were aware of him as being an \\"inventor or something\\" and he identified them as soon as they entered the TARDIS, saying, \\"You must be John and Gillian...\\" This lack of surprise on his part indicated his awareness of the possibility of them turning up at some point. During their visit, John playfully touched a control button and transported them to the 30th century, where they helped the peaceful Thains to defeat a race of alien invaders, the Kleptons. At the end of the tale it seemed that the Doctor was about to make an attempt to return his grandchildren to the 20th century, but this was not taken up in the second story, which commenced with a crash-landing for the three on an asteroid and went on to tell of their involvement in the quest for a moss with medicinal qualities. John and Gillian travelled with the Doctor for many adventures and fought against many enemies, including the villainous \\"Great Ixa\\", the space pirate Captain Anastas Thrax, the ant-like Zarbi (from the televised story The Web Planet), the spherical Gyros robots and even the Pied Piper in what amounted to a sequel to Robert Browning's famous poem. A later story introduced the Trods, cone-shaped robotic creatures that ran on static electricity, created for the strip by artist John Canning as surrogate Daleks, since the latter could not at that time be used as Terry Nation had sold the rights to the Doctor's arch-enemies elsewhere; namely, City Publications' TV Century 21. After TV21's comic strip The Daleks came to an end, Polystyle Publications obtained the rights, and the Daleks swept onto the front cover of issue 788 of TV Comic in the first instalment of The Trodos Ambush, in which they massacred the Trods. John and Gillian, who now appeared to be teenagers, remained with the Doctor for many more comic strip adventures until the first part of Invasion of the Quarks (issues 872 to 876), when the Doctor enrolled them in the galactic university on the planet Zebadee. This was their last appearance in the TV Comic strip. Other appearances In the novel Heart of TARDIS by Dave Stone, the Doctor commented that he had friends and family living in late twentieth century London.

EMD only built 15 locomotives; the decline of the 6-axle design for passenger service led to the adoption of the 4-axle EMD F40PH as the standard passenger locomotive in the United States. As of January 2017, all but two F40Cs have been retired, though none are operating. They have been replaced by the MPI MP36PH-3S in 2003‚Äì2004. Locomotives #600-#609 and #613 were sent to East Saint Louis, Illinois in 2004 and had their road numbers unregistered with the Federal Railroad Administration. They were all scrapped before 2007. #610 was unregistered in 2004 and was sent to National Railway Equipment in Dixmoor, Illinois and was scrapped on September 24, 2020https://railpictures.net/photo/749080/. The only F40Cs that remain in operable condition are #611 and #614. Both locomotives are on long-term hold and are stored in Metra's Western Avenue rail yard.  Design  The F40C is derived from the EMD SDP40F; besides the shorter length, the primary difference between the two is the substitution of a HEP generator for the SDP40F's twin steam generators. It is powered by a 16 cylinder EMD 645E3B, producing . It uses the same frame as the EMD SD40-2, giving it an overall length of .  History  In the early 1970s the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (\\"Milwaukee Road\\") operated two commuter rail lines in Chicago: the Milwaukee District / North Line to Fox Lake via the Canadian Pacific Railway's C&M; Subdivision, and the Milwaukee District / West Line to Elgin via the CP's Elgin Subdivision. The operation of these lines was subsidized by local transit agencies. In 1974 two local agencies, the North West Suburban Mass Transit District and the North Suburban Mass Transit District, funded the acquisition of 15 F40Cs for use on the Milwaukee lines. The locomotives passed to Metra on the latter's creation in the 1980s but continued to operate on the ex-Milwaukee lines. The F40C was withdrawn from regular service with the arrival of new MPI MP36PH-3S locomotives in 2003‚Äì2004. Thirteen locomotives were sold to locomotive leasing corporations, although units 611 and 614 were retained and kept on the property in the Western Avenue railyard. In the spring of 2009, units 611 and 614 were placed back into revenue service on both of Metra's ex-Milwaukee Road commuter lines. This was done to cover schedules while the oldest units in Metra's EMD F40PH fleet were being rebuilt. Towards the end of 2016, with many F40PH-2 and F40PHM-2 locomotives being sent out for rebuild, there is an increased likelihood that the 611 and the 614 will be put back into service. Along with a small fleet of HEP-equipped EMD SD70MAC locomotives operating on the Alaska Railroad, the F40Cs were the last six-axle passenger locomotives in daily service in North America, although Metra has since ordered a fleet of SD70MACH locomotives. #611 and #614 are retained for the purpose of filling the roles of locomotives that have broken down or are being rebuilt. Despite this, neither locomotive has seen regular service since 2012. Metra at one time did have plans to rebuild F40Cs 611 and 614 to test new prime movers and control packages. Due to a lack of bidders, this plan has been put on hold indefinitely.metrarail.com/about-metra/newsroom/the-signal/metra- powerhouse-f40c Notes References  Category:C-C locomotives F40C EMD F40C EMD F40C Category:Passenger locomotives Category:Diesel-electric locomotives of the United States Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1974 Category:Standard gauge locomotives of the United States ","title":"EMD F40C"},{"id":"2614706","text":"The black stilt (Himantopus novaezelandiae) or kakƒ´ (MƒÅori) is a wading bird found in New Zealand. It is one of the world's rarest birds, with 169 adults surviving in the wild as of May 2020. Adult kakƒ´ have distinctive black plumage, long pink legs, and a long thin black bill. Black stilts largely breed in the Mackenzie Basin in the South Island, and are threatened by introduced feral cats, ferrets, and hedgehogs as well as habitat degradation from hydroelectric dams, agriculture, and invasive weeds.  Taxonomy and systematics Black stilts are one of several species in the genus Himantopus, classified along with avocets in the family Recurvirostridae. Although genetically and behaviourally distinct from pied stilts (Himantopus himantopus), they are able to successfully hybridise with them. Hybridisation and dilution of the gene pool is one reason black stilts are threatened with extinction. Black and pied stilts in New Zealand represent two colonisations of pied stilt ancestors from Australia: the first, long ago, giving rise to melanistic descendants, the second in the early 19th century. Black stilt (Himantopus novaezealandiae), compared with the closely related pied stilt (H. himantopus). Painted by John Gould.  Description  Black stilts are a medium-sized (220 g) wader with extremely long pink legs, red eyes, distinctively black plumage, and a long slender black bill. Juveniles have a white breast, neck and head, with a black patch around the eyes, and black belly feathers that distinguish them from pied stilts. Black adult plumage appears in their first or second year. Black plumage may be an adaptation to \\"absorb heat better in the cold, windswept habitat of glacial riverbeds and lakeshores\\". Hybrids between black and pied stilts are very variable in their plumage, but usually have black breast feathers, which pied stilts never do.  Distribution and habitat Although black stilts currently breed only in braided river systems in the South Island, subfossil bones show that prior to human arrival they were found in habitats as diverse as narrow bush streams in Hawkes Bay, and a wetland lake surrounded by forest in North Canterbury. In the nineteenth century they bred on riverbeds and in wetlands of the central and eastern North Island and most of the South Island except Fiordland. As late as the 1940s they were still common in South Canterbury and Central Otago, and nesting occurred in Central Otago as late as 1964. Throughout their range they have been almost entirely replaced by pied stilts, which colonised New Zealand after human settlement and now number approximately 30,000. Currently black stilts breed only in the upper Waitaki River system in the Mackenzie Basin. Most black stilts will also overwinter in the Mackenzie Basin, but about 10% of the population, especially hybrids and those paired with pied stilts, migrate to North Island harbours such as Kawhia and Kaipara in January for the winter. Behaviour and ecology = Breeding = Kakƒ´ nest in the Mackenzie Basin. Black stilts breed at 2 (more usually 3) years of age. They nest as solitary pairs, not in a protective colony like pied stilts. Both birds collaborate on building a nest in July or August on stable islands or banks in a shingle riverbed; pairs tend to nest in the same site each year. Three to five eggs are laid from September to December, peaking in October, and are incubated for roughly 25 days. Chicks take six to eight weeks to fledge, and remain with their parents for a further six to eight months. Conservation Black stilt near Twizel Pied stilt (Himantopus himantopus) on nest pied) stilt, showing node F plumage. (Hybrid black stilt colour patterns are described as 'nodes', ranging from 'A', closest to a pied stilt, to 'J', closest to a black stilt.) Despite 20 years of intensive protection, the black stilt remains one of the rarest species of wading bird, and one of the most endangered birds in the world. The population may have numbered 500‚Äì1000 birds in the 1940s, but began to rapidly decline in the 1950s, and just 68 adults were counted in 1962. Intensive management began in 1981, when numbers had declined to just 23 adult birds. By 1984, there were 32 adults in the wild, rising to 52 by 1992 (with another 32 in captivity). The current wild population is estimated at 169 wild adult birds (as of May 2020), along with a captive population maintained for breeding and subsequent wild release. Annual release in the wild of these captive-bred birds, combined with predator control, have probably prevented black stilt from becoming extinct. In August 2019, 130 juvenile birds were released by the Department of Conservation onto the Godley, Cass, and Tasman rivers. = Predators = Predation from mammalian invasive species poses the greatest threat to the survival of the species. In the 19th century, mustelids such as stoats, ferrets and weasels, as well as cats, were released into the Mackenzie Country to try to control the spread of rabbits. Black stilts are very vulnerable to these predators: they nest on the banks of streams and rivers, rather than islands; their nesting season begins in late winter, a time when rabbit numbers are low; and they currently nest as solitary pairs, so lose the protection of a colony (although they formed colonies in the past when numbers were higher). Compared with pied stilts, they have more noticeable plumage, are less likely to perform distraction displays while incubating, and their chicks take longer to fledge. Intensive trapping and electric fences are used around black stilt breeding sites to control predators. = Hybridisation = Hybridisation with far more numerous pied stilt is also a major threat to the black stilt gene pool. Hybridisation is a symptom of the continuing decline of the black stilt population; black stilts will choose the darkest-plumaged partner available, but mixed-species pairing can happen because potential black stilt mates are so rare. Black stilts mate for life, so those which pair with a pied stilt are lost to the breeding population. = Habitat loss = Black stilts rely on wetlands and braided riverbeds for feeding, and these have been extensively drained or modified for agriculture, irrigation, and flood control. Invasive weeds such as Russell lupin and crack willow are able to colonise braided riverbeds, reducing nesting habitat and providing cover for predators. Because black stilts nest on braided river beds, they are threatened by changes in river flows as a result of new and existing hydroelectric dams. As part of the Upper Waitaki Power Development, braided riverbeds in the Upper Waitaki were receiving less water, which allowed weeds to encroach into black stilt breeding areas. These provided cover for predators, and from 1991 a new flow regime was introduced to reduce encroaching vegetation. Artificial lowering of the level of Lake Benmore, which caused exposure of shallow riverbed in the deltas of the rivers that feed it, created temporary foraging areas for black stilts.

Often it feels like a spinning or swaying movement. This may be associated with nausea, vomiting, sweating, or difficulties walking. It is typically worse when the head is moved. Vertigo is the most common type of dizziness. The most common disorders that result in vertigo are benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), M√©ni√®re's disease, and labyrinthitis. Less common causes include stroke, brain tumors, brain injury, multiple sclerosis, migraines, trauma, and uneven pressures between the middle ears. Physiologic vertigo may occur following being exposed to motion for a prolonged period such as when on a ship or simply following spinning with the eyes closed. Other causes may include toxin exposures such as to carbon monoxide, alcohol, or aspirin. Vertigo typically indicates a problem in a part of the vestibular system. Other causes of dizziness include presyncope, disequilibrium, and non-specific dizziness. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is more likely in someone who gets repeated episodes of vertigo with movement and is otherwise normal between these episodes. The episodes of vertigo should last less than one minute. The Dix-Hallpike test typically produces a period of rapid eye movements known as nystagmus in this condition. In M√©ni√®re's disease there is often ringing in the ears, hearing loss, and the attacks of vertigo last more than twenty minutes. In labyrinthitis the onset of vertigo is sudden and the nystagmus occurs without movement. In this condition vertigo can last for days. More severe causes should also be considered. This is especially true if other problems such as weakness, headache, double vision, or numbness occur. Dizziness affects approximately 20‚Äì40% of people at some point in time, while about 7.5‚Äì10% have vertigo. About 5% have vertigo in a given year. It becomes more common with age and affects women two to three times more often than men. Vertigo accounts for about 2‚Äì3% of emergency department visits in the developed world. Classification Vertigo is classified into either peripheral or central depending on the location of the dysfunction of the vestibular pathway, although it can also be caused by psychological factors. Vertigo can also be classified into objective, subjective, and pseudovertigo. Objective vertigo describes when the person has the sensation that stationary objects in the environment are moving. Subjective vertigo refers to when the person feels as if they are moving. The third type is known as pseudovertigo, an intensive sensation of rotation inside the person's head. While this classification appears in textbooks, it is unclear what relation it has to the pathophysiology or treatment of vertigo. =Peripheral= Vertigo that is caused by problems with the inner ear or vestibular system, which is composed of the semicircular canals, the vestibule (utricle and saccule), and the vestibular nerve is called \\"peripheral\\", \\"otologic\\" or \\"vestibular\\" vertigo. The most common cause is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), which accounts for 32% of all peripheral vertigo. Other causes include M√©ni√®re's disease (12%), superior canal dehiscence syndrome, labyrinthitis, and visual vertigo. Any cause of inflammation such as common cold, influenza, and bacterial infections may cause transient vertigo if it involves the inner ear, as may chemical insults (e.g., aminoglycosides) or physical trauma (e.g., skull fractures). Motion sickness is sometimes classified as a cause of peripheral vertigo. People with peripheral vertigo typically present with mild to moderate imbalance, nausea, vomiting, hearing loss, tinnitus, fullness, and pain in the ear. In addition, lesions of the internal auditory canal may be associated with facial weakness on the same side. Due to a rapid compensation process, acute vertigo as a result of a peripheral lesion tends to improve in a short period of time (days to weeks). =Central= Vertigo that arises from injury to the balance centers of the central nervous system (CNS), often from a lesion in the brainstem or cerebellum, is called \\"central\\" vertigo and is generally associated with less prominent movement illusion and nausea than vertigo of peripheral origin. Central vertigo may have accompanying neurologic deficits (such as slurred speech and double vision), and pathologic nystagmus (which is pure vertical/torsional). Central pathology can cause disequilibrium which is the sensation of being off balance. The balance disorder associated with central lesions causing vertigo is often so severe that many people are unable to stand or walk. A number of conditions that involve the central nervous system may lead to vertigo including: lesions caused by infarctions or hemorrhage, tumors present in the cerebellopontine angle such as a vestibular schwannoma or cerebellar tumors, epilepsy, cervical spine disorders such as cervical spondylosis, degenerative ataxia disorders, migraine headaches, lateral medullary syndrome, Chiari malformation, multiple sclerosis, parkinsonism, as well as cerebral dysfunction. Central vertigo may not improve or may do so more slowly than vertigo caused by disturbance to peripheral structures. Alcohol can result in positional alcohol nystagmus (PAN). Signs and symptoms A drawing showing the sensation of vertigo Vertigo is a sensation of spinning while stationary. It is commonly associated with nausea or vomiting, unsteadiness (postural instability), falls, changes to a person's thoughts, and difficulties in walking. Recurrent episodes in those with vertigo are common and frequently impair the quality of life. Blurred vision, difficulty in speaking, a lowered level of consciousness, and hearing loss may also occur. The signs and symptoms of vertigo can present as a persistent (insidious) onset or an episodic (sudden) onset. Persistent onset vertigo is characterized by symptoms lasting for longer than one day and is caused by degenerative changes that affect balance as people age. Naturally, the nerve conduction slows with aging and a decreased vibratory sensation is common. Additionally, there is a degeneration of the ampulla and otolith organs with an increase in age. Persistent onset is commonly paired with central vertigo signs and symptoms. The characteristics of an episodic onset vertigo are indicated by symptoms lasting for a smaller, more memorable amount of time, typically lasting for only seconds to minutes. Pathophysiology The neurochemistry of vertigo includes six primary neurotransmitters that have been identified between the three-neuron arc that drives the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR). Glutamate maintains the resting discharge of the central vestibular neurons and may modulate synaptic transmission in all three neurons of the VOR arc. Acetylcholine appears to function as an excitatory neurotransmitter in both the peripheral and central synapses. Gamma- Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is thought to be inhibitory for the commissures of the medial vestibular nucleus, the connections between the cerebellar Purkinje cells, and the lateral vestibular nucleus, and the vertical VOR. Three other neurotransmitters work centrally. Dopamine may accelerate vestibular compensation. Norepinephrine modulates the intensity of central reactions to vestibular stimulation and facilitates compensation. Histamine is present only centrally, but its role is unclear. Dopamine, histamine, serotonin, and acetylcholine are neurotransmitters thought to produce vomiting. It is known that centrally acting antihistamines modulate the symptoms of acute symptomatic vertigo. Diagnosis Tests for vertigo often attempt to elicit nystagmus and to differentiate vertigo from other causes of dizziness such as presyncope, hyperventilation syndrome, disequilibrium, or psychiatric causes of lightheadedness. Tests of vestibular system (balance) function include electronystagmography (ENG), Dix-Hallpike maneuver, rotation tests, head- thrust test, caloric reflex test, and computerized dynamic posturography (CDP). The HINTS test, which is a combination of three physical exam tests that may be performed by physicians at the bedside has been deemed helpful in differentiating between central and peripheral causes of vertigo. The HINTS test involves the horizontal head impulse test, observation of nystagmus on primary gaze, and the test of skew. CT scans or MRIs are sometimes used by physicians when diagnosing vertigo. Tests of auditory system (hearing) function include pure tone audiometry, speech audiometry, acoustic reflex, electrocochleography (ECoG), otoacoustic emissions (OAE), and the auditory brainstem response test. A number of specific conditions can cause vertigo. In the elderly, however, the condition is often multifactorial. A recent history of underwater diving can indicate a possibility of barotrauma or decompression sickness involvement but does not exclude all other possibilities. The dive profile (which is frequently recorded by dive computer) can be useful to assess a probability for decompression sickness, which can be confirmed by therapeutic recompression. =Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo= Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most common vestibular disorder and occurs when loose calcium carbonate debris has broken off of the otoconial membrane and enters a semicircular canal thereby creating the sensation of motion. People with BPPV may experience brief periods of vertigo, usually under a minute, which occur with change in the position. This is the most common cause of vertigo. It occurs in 0.6% of the population yearly with 10% having an attack during their lifetime. It is believed to be due to a mechanical malfunction of the inner ear. BPPV may be diagnosed with the Dix- Hallpike test and can be effectively treated with repositioning movements such as the Epley maneuver. =M√©ni√®re's disease= M√©ni√®re's disease is an inner ear disorder of unknown origin, but is thought to be caused by an increase in the amount of endolymphatic fluid present in the inner ear (endolymphatic hydrops). However, this idea has not been directly confirmed with histopathologic studies but electrophysiologic studies have been suggestive of this mechanism. M√©ni√®re's disease frequently presents with recurrent, spontaneous attacks of severe vertigo in combination with ringing in the ears (tinnitus), a feeling of pressure or fullness in the ear (aural fullness), severe nausea or vomiting, imbalance, and hearing loss. As the disease worsens, hearing loss will progress. =Labyrinthitis= Labyrinthitis presents with severe vertigo with associated nausea, vomiting, and generalized imbalance and is believed to be caused by a viral infection of the inner ear though several theories have been put forward and the cause remains uncertain. Individuals with vestibular neuritis do not typically have auditory symptoms but may experience a sensation of aural fullness or tinnitus. Persisting balance problems may remain in 30% of people affected. =Vestibular migraine= Vestibular migraine is the association of vertigo and migraines and is one of the most common causes of recurrent, spontaneous episodes of vertigo. The cause of vestibular migraines is currently unclear; however, one hypothesized cause is that the stimulation of the trigeminal nerve leads to nystagmus in individuals suffering from migraines. Other suggested causes of vestibular migraines include the following: unilateral neuronal instability of the vestibular nerve, idiopathic asymmetric activation of the vestibular nuclei in the brainstem, and vasospasm of the blood vessels supplying the labyrinth or central vestibular pathways resulting in ischemia to these structures. Vestibular migraines are estimated to affect 1-3% of the general population and may affect 10% of people with migraine . Additionally, vestibular migraines tend to occur more often in women and rarely affect individuals after the sixth decade of life. =Motion sickness= Motion sickness is common and is related to vestibular migraine. It is nausea and vomiting in response to motion and is typically worse if the journey is on a winding road or involves many stops and starts, or if the person is reading in a moving car. It is caused by a mismatch between visual input and vestibular sensation. For example, the person is reading a book that is stationary in relation to the body but the vestibular system senses that the car, and thus the body, is moving. =Alternobaric vertigo= Alternobaric vertigo is caused by a pressure difference between the middle ear cavities, usually due to blockage or partial blockage of one eustachian tube, usually when flying or diving underwater. It is most pronounced when the diver is in the vertical position; the spinning is towards the ear with the higher pressure and tends to develop when the pressures differ by 60 cm of water or more. =Decompression sickness= Vertigo is recorded as a symptom of decompression sickness in 5.3% of cases by the US Navy as reported by Powell, 2008 It including isobaric decompression sickness. Decompression sickness can also be caused at a constant ambient pressure when switching between gas mixtures containing different proportions of inert gas. This is known as isobaric counterdiffusion, and presents a problem for very deep dives. For example, after using a very helium-rich trimix at the deepest part of the dive, a diver will switch to mixtures containing progressively less helium and more oxygen and nitrogen during the ascent. Nitrogen diffuses into tissues 2.65 times slower than helium, but is about 4.5 times more soluble. Switching between gas mixtures that have very different fractions of nitrogen and helium can result in \\"fast\\" tissues (those tissues that have a good blood supply) actually increasing their total inert gas loading. This is often found to provoke inner ear decompression sickness, as the ear seems particularly sensitive to this effect. = Stroke = A stroke (either ischemic or hemorrhagic) involving the posterior fossa is a cause of central vertigo. Risk factors for a stroke as a cause of vertigo include increasing age and known vascular risk factors. Presentation may more often involve headache or neck pain, additionally, those who have had multiple episodes of dizziness in the months leading up to presentation are suggestive of stroke with prodromal TIAs. The HINTS exam as well as imaging studies of the brain (CT, CT angiogram, MRI) are helpful in diagnosis of posterior fossa stroke. Management Definitive treatment depends on the underlying cause of vertigo. M√©ni√®re's disease people have a variety of treatment options to consider when receiving treatment for vertigo and tinnitus including: a low-salt diet and intratympanic injections of the antibiotic gentamicin or surgical measures such as a shunt or ablation of the labyrinth in refractory cases. Common drug treatment options for vertigo may include the following: *Anticholinergics such as hyoscine hydrobromide (scopolamine) *Anticonvulsants such as topiramate or valproic acid for vestibular migraines *Antihistamines such as betahistine, dimenhydrinate, or meclizine, which may have antiemetic properties *Beta blockers such as metoprolol for vestibular migraine *Corticosteroids such as methylprednisolone for inflammatory conditions such as vestibular neuritis or dexamethasone as a second-line agent for M√©ni√®re's disease All cases of decompression sickness should be treated initially with 100% oxygen until hyperbaric oxygen therapy (100% oxygen delivered in a high-pressure chamber) can be provided. Several treatments may be necessary, and treatment will generally be repeated until either all symptoms resolve, or no further improvement is apparent. Etymology Vertigo is from the Latin word vert≈ç which means \\"a whirling or spinning movement\\".

A legend concerning Asi appears in the Shantiparva section of Mahabharata. In Rigvedic Sanskrit Asi is still used as a term for a kind of sacrificial dagger or knife.Rocky Pendergrass, 2015,Mythological Swords, Page 10. The common term for sword in Classical Sanskrit is ' and khanda in Hindi. Frame narrative Out of curiosity Nakula, the fourth son of Pandu and the master of swordsmanship questioned the Kuru Grandsire Bhishma on his arrow death bed as to which was the best weapon in all kinds of fighting. In his own personal views Nakula thought the sword to be the most superior since even on having lost one's bow, horse and the chariot, a skillful swordsman could still defend himself against the mace and spear wielders. Nakula further queried the Grand-sire about the origin and purpose of the Khadga as well as about its first acharya (\\"teacher, preceptor\\"). Gladdened by these intelligent queries by Nakula, Bhishma related to him the complete Itihaasa (Sanskrit term for 'History') of the Khadga or \\"divine sword\\" starting from its creation down to the present. =Creation of Asi= The Devas approached Brahma, the creator of the universe, in ancient time and protested against the unjust rule and evil doings of the demons (Danavas namely Asura's who belonged to an evil human race with giant build). Hearing the protest from the Gods, Brahma collected sacrificial objects and proceeded to perform a grand sacrifice with the foremost of the Rishis and Devas at the side of Himalaya. During the course of the sacrifice, a dreadful creature sprang from the midst of the sacrificial fires scattering flames all around. It was as though a moon had arisen in the midst of the stars. He was coloured like a deep-blue lotus. His teeth were sharp and terrible, stomach lean and skinny and stature very tall and slim. He was of exceeding energy and power. Simultaneously the earth started shaking, there were turmoils in the oceans, the forceful winds started howling all around, the trees started falling and being torn apart and the meteors started blazing through the skies, Brahma declared Upon this, the creature assumed the form of a blazing sharp-edged sword, glowing like flames. This sword was the primordial weapon created by the Gods for the destruction of evil. The name of the sword was Asi, the personification and the primary energy behind all weapons ever created. As per Bhishma, the constellation under which the sword was born is Krittika, Agni is its deity, Rohini is its Gotra, Rudra is its high preceptor and whoever holds this weapon obtains sure victory and have absloute power over any weapon ever created since asi is the primordial source of energy behind all weapons. =Succession of wielders of Asi= Lord Brahma gave that sword to Lord Shiva and requested him to put down the sinners and evil-doers and restore the Dharma (righteousness). Lord Shiva assuming his terrible form, took up the sword and started the war against the Danava's, the enemies of the Deva's. The earth became miry with flesh and blood of Daityas and he destroyed the entire community of Daityas. Lord Shiva gave the sword to Lord Vishnu. On course of time Vishnu gave it to Marichi, Marichi gave it to all the great Rishis. The latter gave it to Vasava. Vasava gave it to the Regents of the world. The Regents gave that sword to Manu the son of Surya. In time Manu installed his own son Kshupa in the sovereignty of all creatures and gave him the sword for their protection. From Kshupa it was taken by Ikshvaku and from Ikshvaku by Pururavas. From Pururavas it was taken by Ayus and from Ayus by Nahusha. From Nahusha it was taken by Yayati and from Yayati by Puru. From Puru it was taken by Amurtarya. From Amurtarya it descended to Bhumisaya. From Bhumisaya it was taken by Dushyanta's son Bharata. From Bharata it was taken by the righteous Ailavila. From Ailavila it was taken by king Dhundumara. From Dhundumara it was taken by Kamvoja,and from Kamvoja it was taken by Muchukunda, from Muchukunda it was taken by Marutta and from Marutta by Raivata. From Raivata it was taken by Yuvanaswa and from Yuvanaswa by Raghu. From Raghu it was taken by Harinaswa. From Harinaswa the sword was taken by Sunaka and from Sunaka by the righteous-souled Usinara. From the last it was taken by the Bhojas and the Yadus. From the Yadus it was taken by Sivi. From Sivi it descended to Pratardana of Kashi . From Pratardana it was received by Ashtaka and from Ashtaka by Prishadaswa. From Prishadaswa it was received by Bharadvaja and from Bharadvaja his son Drona obtained this weapon. Drona used this weapon in the famous Kurukshetra war described in the epic Mahabharata. Drona become unconquerable in Kurukshetra war because he held this primordial weapon. After the death of Drona it was taken by Kripacharya. Kripacharya gifted this sword to Nakula and from Nakula it went to Parikshit and from Parikshit it went to Janamejaya. From Janamejaya it went to his son Satanika. Satanika, who studied the Vedas under Yajnyawalkya and military science from Kripacharya become dissatisfied with sensual enjoyments and obtained spiritual knowledge from the instructions of Saunaka and ultimately obtained salvation. The sword again went back to Kripacharya for safe keeping till the return of the rightful owner of this weapon, Dronacharya's son Ashwatthama.

It is used as a surname in certain regions of India, specifically in the states of Maharashtra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, whose family received it as a title.  Etymology  In Sanskrit, Desh means land, country and mukh means head or chief; thus, deshmukh means \\"the head\\" of a district.J. G. Duff, A history of Mahratta Vol 1, p. 39  Deshmukh as a title  = Local office = Deshmukh was a historical title given to a person who was granted a territory of land, in Maharashtra, Telangana and Chhattisgarh. The granted territory was usually referred to as the Dƒì≈õamukhi. The Deshmukh was in effect the ruler of the territory, as he was entitled to a portion of the collected taxes. It was also his duty to maintain the basic services in the territory, such as police and judicial duties. It was typically a hereditary system. The title of Deshmukh provided the titled family with revenues from the area and the responsibility to keep the order. The Deshmukh system was abolished after the independence of India in 1947, when the government confiscated most of the land of the Deshmukhs. Some families, however, maintain their status as real estate barons, most notably in Mumbai, with holdover properties that were not taken away. It was similar in many respects to the Zamindar and Jagir systems in India, and can be considered as a feudal system. Typically taxes collected were to be distributed fairly, and occasionally Deshmukhs participated in Vedic rituals in which they redistributed all material possessions to the people. However, the title Deshmukh should not be associated to a particular religion or caste. Deshmukhis were granted by the Deccan sultanates, Mughal emperors, Nizams of Hyderabad and other Muslim rulers and by Maratha emperors (Chhatrapatis) to Deshastha Brahmins, Chandraseniya Kayastha Prabhus, Chitpavan Brahmins, Marathas, Lingayats, Reddys, Jains and Muslims.

Accessed 28 July 2020. *During the rule of Qutb-shahis of Golkonda majority of Deshmukhs and Sir-Deshmukhs were Deshastha Brahmins of Madhwa Section. But, later many of these Deshmukhs became Zamindars and Jagirdars during British rule. *In Andhra Pradesh, especially in the Guntur and Krishna districts, the title \\"Deshmukh\\" was used by Deshastha Brahmin Zamindars. *In North Karnataka many parganas were granted to Deshastha Brahmins and were made Deshmukhs by Sultanate of Bijapur. *In Telangana many Jagirdars of Deshastha Brahmin, Velama and Reddy families were given the title \\"Deshmukh\\" by the Nizam of Hyderabad. Inukonda Thirumali of Telangana describes the role of Deshmukhs:Thirumali, pp top47 > They were primarily revenue collectors; and when (magisterial and judicial) > responsibilities were added to their function they became Deshmukhs, chiefs > of the parganas. Gradually, each of these assignments tended to become a > watan i.e., hereditary lease. Despite changes in the political authority at > the top, this institution survived, since no ruler from above wished to risk > disturbing local administration, headed by village officials. This > institution was deeply entrenched in the region with local support and > structured in organized 'community' life. The Deshmukh presided over > meetings of the pargana community known as ['got sabha'] which decided and > confirmed claims over inheritance, purchase, and transfer of waters. The > Deshmukh by virtue of local sanction and consensus could not be easily > displaced from above. Barry Pavier describes Deshmukhs:Pavier, pp1413 > These were, in the 1940s, the layer of the very large landowners in > Telangana. They owned from 2,000-3,000 acres at the lower end to at the > upper scale.

The dark blue lines show areas of high nuptiality west of the Hajnal line The Hajnal line is a border that links Saint Petersburg, Russia and Trieste, Italy. In 1965, John Hajnal discovered it divides Europe into two areas characterized by different levels of nuptiality. To the west of the line, marriage rates and thus fertility were comparatively low and a significant minority of women married late or remained single; to the east of the line and in the Mediterranean and select pockets of Northwestern Europe, early marriage was the norm and high fertility was countered by high mortality. Overview West of this line, the average age of marriage for women was 23 or older, men 26, spouses were relatively close in age, a substantial number of women married for the first time in their thirties and forties, and 10% to 20% of adults never married. East of the line, the mean age of both sexes at marriage was earlier, spousal age disparity was greater and marriage more nearly universal. Subsequent research has amply confirmed Hajnal's continental divide, and what has come to be known as the 'Western European marriage pattern', although historical demographers have also noted that there are significant variations within the region; to the west of the line, about half of all women aged 15 to 50 years of age were married while the other half were widows or had never married; to the east of the line, about seventy percent of women in that age bracket were married while the other thirty percent were widows or nuns.Kertzer 2001; 224‚Äì225 That a number of widows remarried also kept the age of marriage comparatively high; if women married for the first time at 21 years of age and twenty percent of all weddings featured a widowed bride and the average age of remarriage was forty years then the average marriage age for women would be 24.8 years: (21 √ó 0.8) + (40 √ó 0.2) = 24.8.Hajnal, 1965. pp. 108‚Äì109 The proportion of marriages that were remarriages (widows and/or widowers marrying again) in the late 1500s was as high as thirty percent; that proportion had fallen to just over eleven percent in the early 1800s. While the average age at first marriage had climbed to 25 for women and 27 for men in England and the Low Countries by the end of the 16th century,De Moor, 2009; 17 and the percentage of Englishwomen marrying fell from over 90% to just over 80% through the 17th century and their average age at first marriage rose to 26, there was nonetheless great variation within Western Europe; while Lowland Scotland saw patterns similar to England, with women married in the middle twenties after a period of domestic service, the high birth rate of Highland Scotland and the Hebrides imply a lower age of marriage for the bride. Similarly, in 1620 the average age of first marriage for Swedish women was roughly 20 years and the proportion of single women was less than 10%, but by the end of the 18th century it had risen to roughly 26 years and continued to climb with the celibacy rate as a result of falling infant mortality rates, declining famines, and other factors. Similarly, Ireland's age of marriage in 1830 was 23.8 for women and 27.5 for men where they had once been 21 and 25, respectively, and only about 10% of adults remained unmarried; in 1840, they had respectively risen to 24.4 and 27.7; in the decades after the Great Famine, the age of marriage had risen to 28‚Äì29 for women and 33 for men and as much as a third of Irishmen and a fourth of Irishwomen never married due to chronic economic problems that discouraged early marriage. =Effects= The Western European pattern of late and non-universal marriage restricted fertility massively, especially when it was coupled with very low levels of childbirth out of wedlock. Birth control took place by delaying marriage more than suppressing fertility within it. A woman's life-phase from menarche (generally reached on average at 14 years, at about 12 years for elite women) to the birth of her first child was unusually long, averaging ten years. =Economy= Class differences played a great role in when a couple could marry; the wealthier that a couple was, the likelier that they were to marry earlier. Noblewomen and gentlewomen married early, but they were a small minority;Coontz, Stephanie. 2005. pp. 125‚Äì129. a thousand marriage certificates issued by the Diocese of Canterbury between 1619 and 1660 show that only one bride was aged thirteen years, four were fifteen, twelve were sixteen, seventeen were seventeen, and the other 966 of the brides were aged nineteen years or older when they married for the first time. The church stipulated that both the bride and groom must be at least 21 years of age to marry without the consent of their families; the most common ages of marriage were 22 for women, 24 for men; the median ages were 22.8 for women and 25.5 for men; the average ages were 24 years for women and nearly 28 years for men. The youngest brides were nobility and gentry.Laslett, Peter. 1965. p. 82 The moderate rates of fertility, mortality, and marriage within the region were tied to the economy; when times were better, more people could afford to marry early and thus have more children and conversely more people delayed marriages (or remained unmarried) and bore fewer children when times were bad. This contrasts with societies outside of this region, where early marriage for both sexes was virtually universal and high fertility was counteracted by high mortality;Kertzer, David I and Marzio Barbagli. 2001. p. xxii in the 15th century, a Tuscan woman 21 years of age would be seen as past marriageable age, the deadline for which was 19 years, and easily 97 percent of Florentine women were married by the age of 25 years while 21 years was the typical age of an English bride.De Moor, Tine and Jan Luiten van Zanden. 2009. pp. 17‚Äì18 Significance The region's late marriage pattern has received considerable scholarly attention in part because it appears to be unique; it has not been found in any other part of the world prior to the 20th century (except for parts of Southeast Asia). The origins of the late marriage system are a matter of conjecture prior to the 16th century when the demographic evidence from family reconstitution studies makes the prevalence of the pattern clear; while evidence is scant, most English couples seemed to marry for the first time in their early twenties before the Black Death and afterward, when economic conditions were better, often married in their late teens. Many historians have wondered whether this unique conjugal regime might explain, in part, why capitalism first took root in Northwestern Europe, contributing to the region's relatively low mortality rates, hastening the fragmentation of the peasantry and the precocious formation of a mobile class of landless wage- earners. Others have highlighted the significance of the late marriage pattern for gender relations, for the relative strength of women's position within marriage, the \\"conjugal\\" dowry system of Northwestern Europe in which the dowry merged with the husband's wealth and would thus grow or shrink depending on circumstances (perhaps an incentive for many women to work),De Moor, Tine and Jan Luiten van Zanden. 2009. p 8-12 the centrality of widows in village land inheritance, and the vitality of women's community networks.

They were owner of vast amount of lands, consistently hereditary,http://www.yourdictionary.com/talukdarhttp://www.britishempire.co.uk/glossary/t.htm and were responsible for collecting taxes. The Taluqdars played helpful roles in the progression of Indian architecture and Indian economy during the reign of Emperor Shah Jahan and Aurangzeb, particularly in Bengal Subah, the most economically developed province in South Asia.Om Prakash, \\"Empire, Mughal\\", History of World Trade Since 1450, edited by John J. McCusker, vol. 1, Macmillan Reference US, 2006, pp. 237‚Äì240, World History in Context. Retrieved 3 August 2017 Being powerful peers, similar to those of Europe in the Middle Ages, the common procedure for Taluqdaris were to withstand the revenue collectors of the Colonial Powers while also bringing given number of villages under their dominion, and thus, according to many historians, the rapid development and enhancing power and wealth of the Taluqdaris during the early 19th century caused tremendous difficulties and concerns to British East India Company. The majority of the Taluqdaris constructed themselves enormous mud fortified towers throughout tropical forests and maintained immense bodies of armed affinities. The historical equivalent in Britain is similar to a member of the landed aristocracy, or perhaps a Lord of the Manor. In contemporary usage, the term is often regarded as a noble tribe and clan although it may convey somewhat diverse meanings in different parts of the Indian subcontinent. Kinds of Taluqdars (1) A tax collector with administrative power over a district of several villages in Punjab, Rajasthan, East Bengal (presently Bangladesh), and rest of North India/United Provinces. (2) An official and civil servant in Hyderabad State during the British colonial era, equivalent to a magistrate and tax collector. (3) A landholder with peculiar tenures in various other parts of British India. (4) Landholders dividing taxes for the Zamindars in East Bengal (now Bangladesh). Taluqdaris The district or estate ruled by a Taluqdar was known as talukdari or taluqdari. According to the Punjab settlement report of 1862, great land holders were appointed Taluqdars over a number of villages during the Mughal era. That Taluq or district usually comprised over 84 villages and a central town. The Talukdar was required to collect taxes, maintain law & order, and provide military supplies/manpower to the provincial government (similar to the role of feudal lords in Europe). In most cases the Talukdars were entitled to keep one tenth of the collected revenue. However, some privileged Talukdars were entitled to one quarter and hence were called Chaudhry, which literally means owner of the fourth part. In Rajasthan, Kathiawar and Bengal, a talukdar was next only to a Raja in extent of land control and social status; but in Punjab and the United Provinces talukdars were much more powerful and were directly under the provincial governor. The late Mughal era saw the rise of powerful talukdars in Oudh, northern India, such as Balrampur,Balrampur (Taluqdari) Bhadri,Bhadri (Taluq) Arkha, Nanpara , Itaunja and Bahuwa estate who seldom paid any collected revenue to the central government and became virtual rulers of their districts. Similarly, in northern Punjab, the talukdars of Dhanni, Gheb and Kot were extremely powerful. Interestingly, the Taluqdars of Sylhet District (Bangladesh) played second fiddle to no one. Namely the Taluqdars of Shiekhpur, Balagoinj and Fenchugoinj who enjoyed total power, influence and authority they became Nawabs and Maharajas (Imperial, Royal and Noble rank) in absolute terms. Eighteenth century Bengal witnessed the rise of great territorial land holders at the expense of smaller landholders who were reduced to the status of dependent taluqdars, required to pay their revenue to the government through the intermediary of the great landlords called Rais, Ranas, Rajas and Maharajas. However many old taluqdars paid revenues to government directly and were as powerful as the Rajas. Hyderabad State During the Rule of the Nizams in Hyderabad State the top of the administrator / tax revenue collector hierarchy was the Subedar who had responsibility for the largest divisions of the country i.e. (the Princely State of Hyderabad) of which there were five. Below this rank, the official title of the lower division (i.e. subdivisions of five above) post holder was Tehsildar and below that rank of Taluqdar, so in effect it could be equated to the three tier ranking from province administrator to county administrator to district administrator in size from the largest to smallest. These are further divided into villages, under a Village officer. Today, the names Talukdar and Choudhry (with variations in spelling) are common in India and in Indians settled overseas among the descendants of those who held this rank or role in times past.

feathers, red stroud cloth. A modern-day Cheyenne dog soldier wearing a feathered headdress during a pow wow at the Indian Summer festival in Henry Maier Festival Park, Milwaukee, Wisconsin. 2008. War bonnets (also called warbonnets or headdresses) are feathered headgear traditionally worn by male leaders of the American Plains Indians Nations who have earned a place of great respect in their tribe. Originally they were sometimes worn into battle, but they are now primarily used for ceremonial occasions. In the Native American and First Nations communities that traditionally have these items of regalia, they are seen as items of great spiritual and political importance, only to be worn by those who have earned the right and honour through formal recognition by their people. Life of George Bent: Written From His Letters, by George E. Hyde, edited by Savoie Lottinville, University of Oklahoma Press (1968), hardcover, 390 pages; trade paperback, 280 pages (March 1983), pp 214, 216, 239, 307. , .The Battle of Beecher Island and the Indian War of 1867‚Äì1869, by John H. Monnett, University Press of Colorado (1992), pages 46 to 48. . Ceremonial importance Unidentified Cree at a pow wow in Fort Qu'Appelle, Saskatchewan Many Native American tribes consider the presentation of an eagle feather to be one of the highest marks of respect. An honored person must have earned their feather through selfless acts of courage and honour, or been gifted them in gratitude for their work or service to their community or Nation. Traditional deeds that bring honour can include acts of valor in battle (including contemporary military service), but also political and diplomatic gains, or acts that helped their community survive and prosper. The esteem attached to eagle feathers is traditionally so high that in many cases, such as a warrior (e.g. Dog Soldiers of the Cheyenne), only two or three honour feathers might be awarded in a person's whole lifetime. Historically, the warrior who was the first to touch an enemy in battle and escape unscathed received an eagle feather. When enough feathers were collected, they might be incorporated into a headdress or some other form of worn regalia. Historically, headdresses were usually reserved exclusively for the tribe's chosen political and spiritual leaders. Roman Nose, who was one of the most influential Cheyenne warriors of the Plain Indian Wars of the 1860s, was known for his illustrious warbonnet that was said to protect him during battle. Several instances record how while wearing his war bonnet, he rode back and forth before soldiers of the United States Army and, despite being fired upon, was left unscathed. While women have traditional regalia that can include other types of headdresses, historically women did not wear the most common style of Plains warbonnet. However, in recent years a few First Nations women who have attained a very high level of respect in their communities have been ceremonially gifted with headdresses of the type that were formerly only worn by men.Behind First Nations headdresses: What you should know Due to their historical importance and status, traditional Native Americans now consider the wearing of headdresses without the express permission of tribal leaders to be an affront to their culture and traditions.Keene, Adrienne (April 27, 2010) \\"But Why Can‚Äôt I Wear a Hipster Headdress? \\" at Native Appropriations ‚Äì Examining Representations of Indigenous Peoples. Consequently, in cases where non-Native political leaders have been symbolically allowed to wear the headdress, this has caused controversy. Legality Plains-style war bonnets are made out of eagle feathers because the eagle is considered by most tribes of the Interior Plains to be the greatest and most powerful of all birds. Under current federal legislation, the Eagle feather law enables Native Americans to continue using eagle feathers in their traditional spiritual and cultural practices. The exemption is contained within the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918. In the United States, only enrolled members of a federally recognized Native American tribe may legally collect or possess eagle feathers. One traditional method of acquiring feathers for war bonnets is to pluck the maturest tail feathers young eagles while still in the nest. This can be done three times before the feathers do not grow back. As many as thirty six feathers can be collected in this manner. If care is taken in not disturbing the nest, this method can be repeated yearly.  Plains-style bonnets  In the collection of the Children's Museum of Indianapolis Plains Indians use eagle feathers as the most significant part of the headdress to represent honor and respect. Some Plains-style bonnet forms are the \\"horned\\" bonnet, \\"flaring\\" eagle feather bonnet, and the \\"fluttering feather\\" bonnet. The \\"horned\\" bonnet can consist of a buckskin skull cap, shaved bison or cow horns, and dyed horsehair with bunches of owl feathers beneath the skull cap. The \\"flaring\\" eagle feather bonnet is often made of golden eagle tail feathers connected to a buckskin or felt crown. There are slits at the base of the crown that allow the bonnet to have a \\"flaring\\" look. An unusual form of bonnet is the \\"fluttering feather\\" bonnet, with the feathers loosely attached to a felt or buckskin cap, hanging at the sides. Cultural appropriation Native American cultural representatives and activists have expressed offense at what they deem the cultural appropriation of wearing and displaying of such headdresses, and other \\"indigenous traditional arts and sacred objects\\" by those who have not earned them, especially by non-Natives as fashion or costume.\\"ReMatriate was started earlier this year by women from the Yukon and northern B.C. in response to offensive runway fashion shows and ‚Äúfestival wear‚Äù appropriated from indigenous traditional arts and sacred objects and sold as commodities without permission.\\" See The controversy is part of a wider effort by Native American activists to highlight what they view as the ongoing cultural genocide against indigenous peoples in the United States and Canada. The trend of musicians and festival-goers wearing warbonnets, in particular, has led to criticism by Native Americans, apologies by non- Natives, and the banning of the sale or wearing of them as costumes by several music festivals. > To explain Native peoples' discomfort with non-Indians wearing headdresses, > for example, it is necessary to go back to the indigenous perspective and > evaluate what the headdress means specifically to the various tribes, Crow > and Lakota to name two, that make and use them. Without such context, it's > impossible for non-Indians in contemporary settings to grasp the offense and > harm that indigenous people feel when sacred objects and imagery are co- > opted, commercialized, and commodified for non-Indians' benefit.

With an incumbency of 39 years, he was also the longest-serving Commissioner in the force's history, as well as the youngest on his appointment. Early life and career Mayne was born in Dublin, the son of Judge Edward Mayne. He gained his BA from Trinity College, Dublin in 1818Alumni Dublinis and his MA from Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1821. He was called to the Bar at Lincoln's Inn on 9 February 1822 and commenced practice on the Northern Circuit. In 1814 in the company of his eldest brother Charles Mayne, he made a tour of the continent. Second Joint Commissioner As a rising star of the English Bar, Mayne applied in 1829 to be one of the Joint Commissioners of the new Metropolitan Police, and was selected without interview. His senior colleague was to be Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Rowan. Rowan was to provide the discipline and organisational skills, while Mayne was to provide the legal expertise. They took up their new appointments on 7 July 1829 and were to become firm friends, working closely together until Rowan's retirement 21 years later. Later that month, they moved into their offices in 4 Whitehall Place and set about the monumental task of creating the new police force from nothing. On 29 August, they were sworn in as Justices of the Peace by Lord Chief Baron Sir William Alexander. On 16 September, the two Commissioners personally swore in their new constables at the Foundling Hospital. The new force first took to the streets at 6:00 p.m. on 29 September. Mayne was responsible for the second section of the General Instruction Book, which laid down the legal standing and powers of a police officer and the law he was required to enforce. These instructions are still the basis of the powers of a British police constable, and made it clear that police officers did (and do) not have carte blanche to give orders to private citizens without a warrant from a magistrate. Private citizens could make complaints against police officers and pursue them in the courts if necessary. It was not a police officer's job to enforce his own morality or that of a particular section of society. Mayne was a more rigid and abrasive man than Rowan, and frequently clashed with Samuel Philipps, the Permanent Secretary of the Home Office, who believed that the Commissioners should answer to him and his officials, and not just to the Home Secretary. It was a mutual dislike, and although Rowan was more tactful, the Metropolitan Police and Home Office were at odds for sixty years. In 1848, Mayne was appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB). Since Rowan was at the same time appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB), there were suggestions in the press that Mayne may have been deliberately passed over (although in fact Rowan had held the CB for his military services since 1815 and was therefore simply being promoted in the order). First Joint Commissioner In 1850, Rowan retired, and Mayne expected to become sole Commissioner. However, the Home Office decided that a military man should also be appointed and Captain William Hay became Second Commissioner. In 1851, Mayne took personal charge of policing at the Great Exhibition. This angered Hay, who believed that as military commissioner he should have had the job, and he immediately began protesting. However, Mayne's policing at the Great Exhibition was so successful that he was finally appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB). Sole Commissioner In 1855, Hay died, and the Metropolitan Police Act 1856 laid down that in future there should be a single Commissioner, with two Assistant Commissioners. For the next thirteen years, Mayne ran the Metropolitan Police single-handedly. As sole Commissioner, however, Mayne became increasingly aloof and distant from both the public and his men. He was feared and respected by his men, but not loved as Rowan had been, lacking the older man's talent for conciliation and explanation. He embraced the new Victorian 'morality' introduced by Prince Albert, and instructed his men to enforce regulations that were seen by many as petty and unnecessary (such as forbidding children to throw snowballs in public places). In fact, in many ways his new attitude was conflicting with the instructions written by him as a younger man; now the police were very much enforcing middle-class morality and were treating the gentry and aristocracy with a deference that sometimes interfered with their duties. Senior officers also started to be drawn from the officer classes, which conflicted with the original idea that only the Commissioners should be appointed from these classes. This issue was not resolved until the 1940s. In 1866, Mayne took personal charge of suppressing the Hyde Park demonstration, and lost control, suffering physical injury himself. The Home Secretary, Spencer Walpole, let him take full blame, although he did refuse his resignation. In 1867, his resignation was again refused after the police mishandling of the Clerkenwell bombing. Death and legacy Funerary monument, Kensal Green Cemetery, London Mayne died, tired and embittered, at his home in Chester Square on Boxing Day 1868. Although he had made mistakes, he had achieved astonishing things. The original force of less than 1,000 men had grown during his commissionership to nearly 8,000. The area it policed had increased to ten times its original area, and the idea had spread to every county and town in the country. Mayne was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery, London. He was survived by his widow, Georgina Marianne Catherine, eldest daughter of Thomas Carvick of Wyke Manor, Yorkshire, whom he had married in 1831, and children including his son, Rear- Admiral Richard Mayne of the Royal Navy. In the television film The Suspicions of Mr Whicher (2011) and its 2013 sequel he was played by Tim Pigott-Smith.

It is a wading bird endemic to the Chatham Islands, New Zealand. This species is rated by the IUCN as endangered, and has a current population of 310 to 325 birds (2004 census). The main threat is from introduced predators. Description The Chatham oystercatcher has distinctive black and white plumage and a long, thick orange-red beak. The head, neck, breast, back, wings and tail are black. The lower underparts are white with an unclear demarcation on the breast. The irises are yellow and the eyes have orange orbital rings. The short, thick legs are pink. Adults are about in length. Distribution The Chatham oystercatcher is only found on the Chatham Islands, an archipelago about south east of New Zealand. Each of the four main islands has small breeding populations. Behaviour Auckland Museum The Chatham oystercatcher feeds on molluscs and marine worms, digging them out of the sand with its beak and hammering the shells to open them. They prefer foraging on coastline to lagoon shoreline, foraging mostly on intertidal rock platforms and sandy beaches (though some birds preferred pasture). The nest is built on the beach on sandy or rocky shores and consists of a simple scrape. Sometimes it is built among low vegetation and may be rather more elaborate. Two or three eggs are usually laid. Young birds left their birth territory about 33 days after fledging. Juvenile birds become mature at about three years of age, and the lifespan is about eight years. The success rate of each pair averages 0.44 fledglings per breeding season, with flooding the main cause of egg loss. Status In the late 1980s, the total population was less than 110 birds, and was feared to be declining. By 2006 the total population on the four Chatham Islands was estimated to be 310 to 360 individuals of which fewer than 250 were mature individuals. The population is believed to be stable; the IUCN rates the Chatham oystercatcher as \\"Endangered\\", and the Department of Conservation as \\"Nationally Critical\\". The main threats faced by this bird are predation, particularly by feral cats on eggs and chicks, and the cattle and sheep which roam onto the beaches and may trample the nests. The flightless weka (Gallirallus australis) is also a nest predator.

Born in Manhattan, Bassford lived from age three in the Queens neighborhoods of Maspeth, Corona and Whitestone until his marriage in 1961, when he moved to Flushing. In 1975, Bassford settled in Cold Spring, New York. Comic books As a teenager, he took particular note of comic books drawn by Wally Wood, who became a major influence. In Manhattan, Bassford studied at the School of Industrial Art (which later became the High School of Art and Design), and he entered the commercial art field in the early 1950s with magazine gag cartoons and packaging art for toy boxes. His pen-and-ink illustrations were published in the magazine Amateur Art & Camera in 1954. Bassford's first work in comics came in 1957 with \\"What Happened on the Mountain!\\" for Atlas Comics' World of Mystery, reprinted in Atlas' World of Fantasy #13 (August 1958). At the Wally Wood Studio, Bassford was an artist on Tower Comics' T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents almost from the start. Beginning with the second issue, he assisted Wood on the penciling of \\"Dynamo Battles Dynavac\\" (reprinted in Tower's The Terrific Trio paperback). Bassford, Wood and Dan Adkins teamed on The Munsters, a comic book adaptation of the 1964-66 CBS television series.

Using a roundarm action, the bowlers extend their arm about 90 degrees from their body at the point where they release the ball. Roundarm fell into decline after 1864 when the current style of overarm bowling was legalised, although W. G. Grace continued to use it to the end of his career. Origin The spread of roundarm in the 1820s was a natural reaction to the growing predominance of batsmen over the age-old underarm style of bowling. Its adherents argued that the legalisation of roundarm was essential to restore the balance between batting and bowling. However, high-scoring matches were still comparatively rare owing to vagaries in pitch conditions. The idea of roundarm is sometimes attributed to Christiana Willes, sister of Kent cricketer John Willes. The story goes that when bowling to her brother in the garden at home in the 1800s, Willes found herself inconvenienced by her large, lead-weighted dress which prevented her from performing the underarm action. Elevating the arm to just above waist height, she bowled without interference from her attire. According to John Major in More Than A Game, the story is unlikely to be true for reasons of fashion more than cricket because hooped skirts were out of fashion during the period of the Napoleonic War. Roundarm was said to have been devised in the 1790s by Tom Walker, known as Old Everlasting.Ashley Mote, The Glory Days of Cricket, p.127 Walker was a famous opening batsman who had a solid defensive technique and was notoriously difficult to dismiss. He was also a more than useful bowler who was always looking for ways to improvise. Legend has it that he and some of his fellow players in the \\"Hambledon Era\\" used to practise in a barn during the winters. Walker worked out that he could generate more bounce and variation of pace if he bowled with his arm away from his body and soon realised that these deliveries gave the batsman added problems. He tried to use the style in important matches but was no-balled and had to return to his usual underarm lobs, with which he was by no means unsuccessful. Prohibition and eventual legalisation Whatever the origin, John Willes realised that the pace and bounce generated by this raised arm action made the delivery potentially more difficult to play than a conventional underarm one and so he adopted the style himself with his arm coming through at shoulder height. He tried, without success, to have it accepted in senior cricket. The matter was controversial enough for a law to be introduced in 1816 into the Laws of Cricket to prohibit roundarm: > The ball must be bowled (not thrown or jerked), and be delivered underhand, > with the hand below the elbow. But if the ball be jerked, or the arm > extended from the body horizontally, and any part of the hand be uppermost, > or the hand horizontally extended when the ball is delivered, the Umpires > shall call, \\"No Ball\\". On 15 July 1822, in the MCC v Kent match at Lord's, Willes opened the bowling for Kent and was promptly no-balled for using his roundarm action. He had been trying at various times to introduce the style since 1807. Being no-balled on this occasion was the final straw, for Willes reportedly threw the ball away and withdrew from the match, literally going straight to his horse and riding away. He refused to play again in any important fixture. Although Willes had quit the game, he had made his point and others were willing to pick his ball up and persevere. In 1826, Sussex had the best team in England and were acclaimed as the \\"Champion County\\" in some quarters. Their success owed much to the prowess of two top-class bowlers William Lillywhite and Jem Broadbridge, both of whom were champions of the roundarm style, when they could get away with it. Lillywhite was one of the all-time great bowlers and was nicknamed \\"the Nonpareil\\". In 1827, to test the validity of roundarm bowling, three All-England v Sussex roundarm trial matches were arranged, but no immediate decision was made about legalisation. Lillywhite and Broadbridge used roundarm to great effect against the England batsmen who made loud objections. But the batsmen were losing the argument. In 1828, following the Sussex v England roundarm trials, MCC modified Rule 10 to permit the bowler's hand to be raised as high as the elbow. Lillywhite, Broadbridge and their supporters continued to bowl at shoulder height and the umpires did not no- ball them. By 1835, powerless to prevent the use of roundarm, MCC finally amended the Laws of Cricket to make it legal. The relevant part of the Law stated: \\"if the hand be above the shoulder in the delivery, the umpire must call 'No Ball'.\\" It was not long before bowlers‚Äô hands started to go above the shoulder and the 1835 Law had to be reinforced in 1845 by removing benefit of the doubt from the bowler in the matter of his hand‚Äôs height when delivering the ball. Legacy Sri Lanka's Lasith Malinga bowling a round arm delivery against Pakistan Although underarm bowlers did not fade away, roundarm became the predominant style until another controversy erupted about overarm in 1864. Prominent roundarm bowlers to succeed Lillywhite and Broadbridge were Alfred Mynn, John Jackson and W. G. Grace. In the modern game, the Sri Lankan pace bowler Lasith Malinga has a very distinctive action which is authentic roundarm.CricInfo article This has earned him the name \\"Slinga Malinga\\". There are some who question the legality of this action, but it is legal, because his arm does not straighten from a bent position as he bowls. This is the strict definition of bowling vis-√†-vis throwing. In fact, many bowlers bowl with a slightly bent arm; the key is that they do not straighten it as they bowl.

The Guptas and the Kushans played a major role in the introduction and practice of feudalism in India, and are examples of the decline of an empire caused by feudalism.  Terminology  Use of the term feudalism to describe India applies a concept of medieval European origin, according to which the landed nobility held lands from the Crown in exchange for military service, and vassals were in turn tenants of the nobles, while the peasants (villeins or serfs) were obliged to live on their lord's land and give him homage, labor, and a share of the produce, notionally in exchange for military protection. Feudalism is most likely introduced to India when the Kushan Dynasty from Central Asia invaded India and introduced new policies of their own. The term Indian feudalism is used to describe taluqdar, zamindar, jagirdar, ghatwals, mulraiyats, sardar, mankari, deshmukh, chaudhary and samanta. Most of these systems were abolished after the independence of India and the rest of the subcontinent. D. D. Kosambi and R. S. Sharma, together with Daniel Thorner, brought peasants into the study of Indian history for the first time. Structure Starting from the Gupta period the term samanta (neighbour) came to be applied to those granted land or to subjugated feudatory rulers. Weak enforcement of power over the conquered regions led to the resumption of independence and some high administrative positions became hereditary., Encyclop√¶dia Britannica There is debate among historians whether the feudatory system in India qualifies as true feudalism, as apparently there was a lack of an economic contract between king, vassal and serf. Other historians however argue that the similarities are significant enough to describe it as feudalism. The essential characteristic was the decentralization of power. Samantas were officials granted lands instead of a salary and proceeded to seize ownership of the area while continuing to refer to themselves as vassals of their ruler. They were required to pay a small fraction of revenue and provide troops for the overlord. These lords often aped their royal suzerains, for instance, by constructing miniature royal palaces., Encyclop√¶dia Britannica This encouraged the fragmentation of authority and growing parochialism which has been suggested as a cause for the weak resistance against Muslim conquest., Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Bihar The Bihar region (now a state) of India was a hotbed for feudalism. Feudalism first started when the Kushans ruled over India and flourished when the Gupta Empire ruled over Northern India. Feudal lords ruled the region for decades; semi-feudal conditions still exist. As a result, child malnourishment is common, in spite of modern Bihar's status as having the fastest growth in gross domestic product in India. Telangana The Doraas and deshmukhs ruled the region until the annexation. They held all the land in their fief and everybody used to give their produce, and they used to be given only food barely sufficient for sustenance. The rebellion against feudal lords, known as Vetti Chakiri Udhyamam, from 1946 to 1951 in Telangana region called as Telangana Rebellion illustrates the feudal society in the region. The feudal lords used to reside in a high fortress called as Gadi, for entering it they leave their footwear at the threshold of the gadi. The madigas and other backward classes were required to carry their footwear in their hands if they were passing in front of the gadi or dora. A famous line which is repeated by the oppressed was ‚ÄúBanchen Dora n√©e Kalmoktha (will touch your feet my lord). A major Telugu film blockbuster, Maa Bhoomi, showed the society under feudal lords. The Srikrishna committee on Telangana says in its findings that there is still gross injustice to the land tillers of the region, the villains, in this case, were landlords of Telangana and not those of other regions.Panel finds no data to prove T backwardness, Deccan Chronicle  Kerala  There were a number of feudal states in Kerala in the Middle Ages between the end of Chera dynasty and the British rule. In Kerala, Nairs were prominent during feudalism as they acted as both feudals as well as warriors. The land was owned by Nair but was tilled by backward classes. Nairs in turn took the role of administration and defence.  Madras Presidency  Several zamindaris were established in the Madras Presidency (present-day Tamil Nadu and adjoining areas) from 1799 onwards. The largest of these were Arni, Ramnad, Ganapur and Sivaganga. The zamindari settlement was based on a similar settlement established in Bengal. The Zamindari settlement of Madras was largely unsuccessful and was wrapped up in 1852. However, a few Zamindaris remained till India's independence in 1947. North Arcot North Arcot region was under Jagirdars until the Indian independence. The largest estate was that of Arni, a deshastha royal family. Arni estate was larger than Sandur princely state. Northern Andhra The Northern Andhra region was under doras until the Indian Independence. The largest estate was that of Vizianagram under the Poosapati kshatriya family which was liberal and enlightened. Rayalaseema The Rayalaseema region was under Ayyagaru until the independence. The largest estate was that of Panyam; which was ruled by a deshastha royal family of Vishvamitra gotra and was liberal and enlightened. Vidarbha The feudal lords in Vidarbha region are notorious for their oppressive rule.

In 1999, the FDA had more than 6000 anecdotal reports of sudden animal death after usage of Pfizer‚Äôs Rimadyl brand of carprofen. As a result, the FDA requested that Pfizer advise consumers in their advertising that death is a possible side effect. Pfizer refused and pulled their advertising; however, they now include death as a possible side effect on the drug label. Plans call for a \\"Dear Doctor\\" letter to advise veterinarians, and a safety sheet attached to pill packages. Adverse effects include: * Loss of appetite * Vomiting * Diarrhea * Increase in thirst * Increase in urination * Fatigue and/or lethargy (drowsiness) * Loss of coordination * Seizures * Liver dysfunction: jaundice (yellowing of eyes) * Blood or dark tar-like material in urine or stools * Lethargy * Staggering, stumbling, weakness or partial paralysis, full paralysis * Change in skin (redness, scabs, or scratching) * Change in behavior (such as decreased or increased activity level, seizure or aggression) Effects of overdose include gastritis and ulcer formation. In healthy dogs given carprofen, no perioperative adverse effects on the cardiovascular system have been reported at recommended dosages. Perioperative administration of carprofen to cats did not affect postoperative respiratory rate nor heart rate. Carprofen should not be administered concurrently with steroids, as this can cause ulcers in the stomach. Dogs should be taken off carprofen for three full days before ingesting a steroid (such as prednisolone). Carprofen should not be given at the same time with other types of medications such as other NSAIDs (aspirin, etodolac, deracoxib, meloxicam, tepoxalin) or steroids such as dexamethasone, triamcinolone, cortisone or prednisone. Carprofen must be used with caution within the supervision of a veterinarian in dogs with liver or kidney disease, dehydration, bleeding deficits, or other health problems. It is not recommended for use in dogs with bleeding disorders (such as Von Willebrand's disease), as safety has not been established in dogs with these disorders. It has not been established whether carprofen can be safely used in pregnant dogs, dogs used for breeding purposes, or in lactating female dogs. Several laboratory studies and clinical trials have been conducted to establish the safety of using Carprofen. Clinical studies were conducted in nearly 300 dogs, coming from different breeds. The dogs were treated with Rimadyl at the recommended dose for 2 weeks. According to these studies, the drug was clinically well tolerated and the treated dogs did not have a greater incidence of adverse reactions when compared to the control group. A number of factors may contribute to the high incidence of adverse reports received for carprofen by the Center for Veterinary Medicine in the late 1990s. These include: * The type of drug; * Wide use; * Duration of use. While the side effects from carprofen are known to occur within a short period of time after administration, it is believed that long-term use may actually result in a higher risk for adverse reactions; * Senior dog use. Older dogs are generally more prone to side effects caused by carprofen. Human use Carprofen was used in humans for almost 10 years, starting in 1988. It was used for the same conditions as in dogs, viz., joint pain and inflammation. Side effects tended to be mild, usually consisting of nausea or gastro-intestinal pain and diarrhea. Carprofen was available only by prescription in 150 to 600 mg doses.Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products: Carprofen, European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products Dosage over 250 mg was only for relieving pain after severe trauma, such as post-surgery inflammation. 150 mg doses were commonly used to relieve the pain of arthritis, while 200 mg doses were commonly prescribed in cases of severe arthritis or severe inflammation pain. The drug was taken orally. Pfizer voluntarily removed it from the market for human use on commercial grounds. Equine use Carprofen may be administered intravenously to horses.McIlwraith CW, Frisbie DD, Kawcak CE. Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs. Proc. AAEP 2001 (47): 182‚Äì87. A single dose has been shown to reduce prostaglandin E2 production and inflammatory exudate for up to 15 hours, although there was less effect on eicosanoid production when compared to the effects produced by NSAIDs such as phenylbutazone or flunixin. Prostaglandin E2 and inflammatory exudate are also reduced and leukotriene B4 is inhibited. Carprofen can also be given orally, but intramuscular use may produce muscle damage.

Captain William Hay CB (1794 ‚Äì 29 August 1855) was the second and last junior Joint Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis, one of two heads of the London Metropolitan Police. Family He was descended from John Hay, 1st Marquess of Tweeddale (1626‚Äì1697), whose third son, Lord Alexander Hay (1663‚Äì1737) was his great-grandfather. Alexander married Katherine Kerr, an heiress with property in Berwickshire and East Lothian. Their third son, William (1699‚Äì?), married the daughter of Sir Robert Sinclair of Stevenson. William had three sons, including Robert, who later entered the 83rd Regiment of Foot, reached the rank of captain and married Catherine, the daughter of Ralph Babington, of Greenfort, County Donegal, in 1791. They had three children, of whom William was the eldest. Military career In 1807, Hay was enrolled into the Royal Military College, Great Marlow. He was commissioned as ensign without purchase, with seniority dated 30 January 1810, in the 52nd Light Infantry. His first active service occurred in 1810 as the result of threatened disturbances in London following the arrest of Sir Francis Burdett, a reformist politician, who was charged with libelling the House of Commons and sent to the Tower of London. All military units within several days marching of the capital were ordered to and to be quartered in London. The 52nd was ordered up from its base in Chatham and was billeted in a warehouse in Dean Street, Soho. Hay and his unit were to remain in London for three weeks, without incident, before returning to Chatham. From 1810 to 1811, Hay served with the 52nd Light Infantry during the Peninsular War. On 16 July 1811, while still abroad, he was promoted lieutenant and transferred to the 12th Light Dragoons. Hay continued to serve with the 12th throughout the war and also later at the Battle of Waterloo. He was later to write, for his daughter, a full account of his reminiscences of his time serving Wellington between 1808 and 1815. After the war, he was appointed as aide-de-camp on the staff of the Earl of Dalhousie, then Lieutenant-Governor of Nova Scotia. He took up this post in 1817 and served in the North American Provinces until 1823. Since 1822, Hay had held the rank of captain with the 37th Regiment of Foot, on half-pay by purchase, and in 1824 he was successful in effecting an appointment as a full-pay captain in the 5th Dragoon Guards. In 1829, Hay retired from military service and married Sarah Sparkes. Police career Having then lived for two years in Surrey, followed by seven in Scotland, Hay then came to London, where on 10 December 1839 he took up an appointment as the first inspecting superintendent of the Metropolitan Police. This post was effectively the chief deputy to the two joint commissioners, Lieutenant- Colonel Sir Charles Rowan and Richard Mayne, and broke the rule established by Sir Robert Peel that, apart from the two commissioners, all police officers should be promoted from the ranks. This was not the first time Hay had served under Rowan, who was his senior in the 52nd Light Infantry during the Peninsular War. In 1849, Hay was awarded the Military General Service Medal with five clasps (Fuentes D‚ÄôOnor, Vittoria, St Sebastian, Nivelle and Nive) for his service in the war.Military General Service Medal Roll, accessed December 2017 He was also awarded the Waterloo Medal, which had been instituted by order of the Prince Regent in 1816. In 1850, on the retirement of Sir Charles Rowan, Hay was made one of the joint commissioners of the Metropolitan Police and sworn in as a Justice of the peace. His position was junior to Richard Mayne, who had been appointed along with Rowan in 1829. Mayne and Hay did not get along, and Hay was soon complaining to the Home Office about his colleague. He was particularly angered that Mayne took personal charge of the policing of the Great Exhibition in 1851, a job which Hay, as a military man, thought should have gone to him. Hay was, however, appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in 1851 for his involvement in the Exhibition, although Mayne was appointed to the higher grade of Knight Commander for his involvement at the same time. In 1852, the crowds coming to pay their respects at the lying-in-state of the Duke of Wellington got out of hand and it was reported that one or two people had been crushed to death. There was criticism of the police, and Hay had a paragraph inserted into the newspapers claiming that Mayne had been responsible. Mayne was, unsurprisingly, furious. In 1853, Hay submitted plans for police reorganisation to the Home Office without first showing them to Mayne. Hay died at his home, 67 Cadogan Place, on 29 August 1855. His death certificate records the cause as \\"Scirrhus [a form of cancer] of the Oesophagus and Exhaustion\\".Death Certificate: Registration District, St Luke Chelsea, Vol 1a, Page 105 Following his death, it was decided that thereafter there should be only a single commissioner for the Metropolitan Police, as formalised by the Metropolitan Police Act 1856.

Sir John Norris or Norreys (ca. 1547 ‚Äì 3 September 1597), of Rycote, Oxfordshire, and of Yattendon and Notley in Berkshire,https://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1558-1603/member/norris- sir-john-1547-97 was an English soldier, the son of Henry Norris, 1st Baron Norreys, a lifelong friend of Queen Elizabeth. The most acclaimed English soldier of his day, Norreys participated in every Elizabethan theatre of war: in the Wars of Religion in France, in Flanders during the Eighty Years' War of Dutch liberation from Spain, in the Anglo-Spanish War, and above all in the Tudor conquest of Ireland. Early life The eldest son of Henry Norreys by his marriage to Marjorie Williams, Norreys was born at Yattendon Castle. His paternal grandfather had been executed after being found guilty of adultery with Queen Anne Boleyn, the mother of Queen Elizabeth. His maternal grandfather was John Williams, Lord Williams of Thame. Norreys's great uncle had been a guardian of the young Elizabeth, who was well acquainted with the family. She had stayed at Yattendon Castle on her way to imprisonment at Woodstock. The future Queen was a great friend of Norreys's mother, whom she nicknamed \\"Black Crow\\" on account of her jet black hair. Norreys inherited his mother's hair colour, so that he was known as \\"Black Jack\\" by his troops. Norreys grew up with five brothers, several of whom were to serve alongside him during Elizabeth's wars. He may briefly have attended Magdalen College, Oxford. In 1566, Norreys's father was posted as English ambassador to France, and in 1567, when he was about nineteen, Norreys and his elder brother William were present at the Battle of Saint Denis. They drew a map of the battle which formed part of their father's report to the Queen. Early military career When his father was recalled from France in January 1571, Norreys stayed behind and developed a friendship with the new ambassador, Francis Walsingham. In 1571, Norreys served as a volunteer under Admiral Coligny, fighting on the Huguenot side during the French Wars of Religion. Two years later, Norreys served as a captain under Sir Walter Devereux, recently created first Earl of Essex, who was attempting to establish a plantation in the Irish province of Ulster. He supported his elder brother William, who was in command of a troop of a hundred horse which had been recruited by their father, then serving as Lord Lieutenant of Berkshire. While here Norreys took part in the massacre of Sir Brian O'Neill's followers. Essex invited O'Neill and his household to a banquet at Belfast in October 1574. O'Neill reciprocated and held a feast which lasted for three days, but on the third day Norreys and his men slaughtered over 200 of O'Neill's unarmed followers. Essex took Sir Brian, his wife and others to Dublin where they were later executed. When Essex entered Antrim to attack Sorley Boy MacDonnell, it was to Rathlin Island that Sorley Boy and the other Scots sent their wives and children, their aged and sick, for safety. Lord Essex, knowing that the refugees were still on the island, sent orders to Norreys, who was in command at Carrickfergus, to take a company of soldiers with him, cross over to Rathlin, and kill what he could find. Norreys had brought cannon with him, so that the weak defences were speedily destroyed, and after a fierce assault, in which several of the garrison were killed. The Scots were obliged to yield at discretion and all were killed, except the chief and his family, who were reserved for ransom. The death toll was two hundred. Then it was discovered that several hundred more, chiefly women and children, were hidden in the caves about the shore: they too were attacked and all massacred. A fort was erected on the island, but was evacuated by Norreys, and he was recalled with his troops to Dublin within 3 months, when it was clear that the colonisation would fail. The English fury on the Grote Markt in Mechelen, 1580 In 1577 Norreys led a force of English volunteers to the Low Countries, where he fought for the States General, then in revolt against the rule of the Spanish King Philip II at the beginning of the Eighty Years' War. At the battle of Rijmenam (2 August 1578), his force helped defeat the Spanish under the command of John of Austria (Don Juan de Austria), the king's brother; Norreys had three horses shot from under him. Throughout 1579, he co-operated with the French army under Fran√ßois de la Noue, and was put in charge of all English troops, about 150 foot and 450 mounted. He took part in the battle of Borgerhout, where the Spanish army under Alexander Farnese was victorious. Later, he went on to match the Spanish in operations around Meppel and on 9 April 1580, his troops conquered Mechelen and brutally sacked the city in what has become known as the English Fury. On account of these successes, essentially as a mercenary, he boosted the morale in the Protestant armies and became famous in England. The morale of his own troops depended on prompt and regular payment by the States General for their campaign, and Norreys gained a reputation for forceful leadership. In February 1581, he defeated the Count of Rennenburg by relieving Steenwijk under siege and in July inflicted a further defeat at Kollum near Groningen. In September, 1581, however, he was dealt a serious defeat by a Spanish army under Colonel Francisco Verdugo at the Battle of Noordhorn, near Groningen. The following month Norris later checked Verdugo by repelling him at Niezijl. Later in the year he along with the Count of Hohenlohe helped to relieve the city of Lochem which had been under siege by Verdugo. After more campaigns in Flanders in support of Fran√ßois, Duke of Anjou, Norreys was sent back to the Netherlands as an unofficial ambassador of Elizabeth I. In 1584 he returned to England to encourage an English declaration of war on Spain in order to free the States General from Habsburg domination. Return to Ireland In March 1584, Norreys departed the Low Countries and was sent to Ireland in the following July, when he was appointed president of the province of Munster (at this time, his brother Edward was stationed there). Norris urged the plantation of the province with English settlers (an aim achieved in the following years), but the situation proved so unbearably miserable that many of his soldiers deserted him for the Low Countries. In September 1584 Norreys accompanied the Lord Deputy of Ireland, Sir John Perrot, and the earl of Ormonde into Ulster. The purpose was to dislodge the Scots in the Route and the Glynns, and Norreys helped seize fifty thousand cattle from the woods of Glenconkyne in order to deprive the enemy of its means of sustenance. The campaign was not quite successful, as the Scots simply regrouped in Kintyre before crossing back to Ireland once the lord deputy had withdrawn south. Norreys returned to Munster, but was summoned to Dublin in 1585 for the opening of parliament. He sat as the member for Cork County and was forcibly eloquent on measures to confirm the queen's authority over the country. He also complained that he was prevented from launching a fresh campaign in Ulster. Anglo-Spanish War Upon news of the siege of Antwerp, Norreys urged support for the Dutch Protestants and, transferring the presidency of Munster to his brother, Thomas, he rushed to London in May 1585 to prepare for a campaign in the Low Countries. In August he commanded an English army of 4400 men which Elizabeth had sent to support the States General against the Spaniards, in accordance with the Treaty of Nonsuch. He gallantly stormed a fort near Arnhem; the queen, however, was unhappy at this aggression. Still, his army of untried English foot did repulse the Duke of Parma in a day-long fight at Aarschot and remained a threat, until supplies of clothing, food and money ran out. His men suffered an alarming mortality rate without support from home, but the aura of invincibility attaching to the Spanish troops had been dispelled, and Elizabeth finally made a full commitment of her forces to the States General. In December 1585, the Earl of Leicester arrived with a new army and accepted the position of Governor-General of the Low Countries, as England went into open alliance. During an attack on Parma, Norreys received a pike wound in the breast, then managed to break through to relieve Grave, the last barrier to the Spanish advance into the north; Leicester knighted him for this victory during a great feast at Utrecht on St George's Day, along with his brothers Edward and Henry. But the Spanish were soon admitted to Grave by treachery, and Norreys advised against Leicester's order to have the traitor beheaded, apparently because he was in love with the traitor's aunt. The two commanders quarrelled for the rest of the campaign, which turned out a failure. Leicester complained that Norreys was like the Earl of Sussex in his animosity. His main grievance, though, was the corruption of Norreys's uncle, the campaign's treasurer. Leicester's urgings to recall both Norreys and his uncle, were resisted by the Queen. Norreys continued his good service and was ordered by Leicester to protect Utrecht in August 1586. The operation did not go smoothly because Leicester had omitted to put Sir William Stanley under Norreys's command. Norreys joined with Stanley in September in the Battle of Zutphen, in which Sir Philip Sidney - commanding officer over Norreys's brother, Edward, who was lieutenant in the governorship of Flushing - was fatally wounded. At an officers' supper, Edward took offence at some remarks by Sir William Pelham, marshal of the army, which he thought reflected on the character of his older brother, and an argument with the Dutch host flared up, with Leicester having to mediate between the younger Norreys and his host to prevent a duel. By the autumn of 1586 Leicester seems to have relented and was full of praise for Norreys, while at the same time the States General held golden opinions of him. But he was recalled in October, and the queen received him with disdain, apparently owing to his enmity for Leicester; within a year he had returned to the Low Countries, where the new commander, Willoughby, recognised that Norreys would be better for the job, with the comment, \\"If I were sufficient, Norreys were superfluous\\". Willoughby resented having Norris around and observed that he was, \\"more happy than a caesar\\". At the beginning of 1588, Norreys returned to England, where he was presented with the degree of Master of Arts at Oxford University. Later in the year, when the Spanish Armada was expected, he was, under Leicester, marshal of the camp at West Tilbury when Elizabeth delivered the Speech to the Troops at Tilbury. He inspected the fortification of Dover, and in October returned to the Low Countries as ambassador to the States-General. He oversaw a troop withdrawal in preparation for an expedition to Portugal designed to drive home the English advantage following the defeat of the Spanish Armada, when the enemy's fleet was at its weakest. Norreys's sketch of the Spanish fort El L√©on at Crozon 1594 On Wednesday 17 April 1589 (although another source gives the date of departure as 18 April), Norreys set out with Drake at the head of a 23,000 strong expeditionary force (which included 19,000 troops and is now termed the English Armada) on a mission to destroy the shipping on the coasts of Spain and to place the pretender to the crown of Portugal, the Prior of Crato, on the throne. Corunna was surprised, and the lower part of the town burned as Norreys's troops beat off a force of 8,000. Edward was badly wounded in an assault on O Burgo, and his life was only saved by the gallantry of his elder brother. Norreys then attacked Lisbon, but the enemy refused to engage with him, leaving him no option but to put back to sea. Running low on supplies and with his task force reduced by disease and death, Norreys abandoned the secondary objective of attacking the Azores, and the expeditionary force set out to return to England. By the start of July 1589 (Wingfield gives a date of 5 July) the taskforce had all arrived home, some landing back at Plymouth, some at Portsmouth and others London, having achieved little. This \\"English Armada\\", was thus an unsuccessful attempt to press home the defeat of the Spanish Armada and bring the war to the ports of Spain's northern coast and to Lisbon. From 1591 to 1594 Norreys aided Henry IV of France in his struggle with the Catholic League, fighting for the Protestant cause in Brittany at the head of 3000 troops. He took Guingamp and defeated the French Catholic League and their Spanish allies at Chateau Laudran. Some of his troops transferred to the Earl of Essex's force in Normandy, and Norreys's campaign proved so indecisive that he left for England in February 1592 and did not return to Brittany until September 1594. He seized the town of Morlaix after he had outmanoeuvred the Duke of Mercour and Juan del √Åguila. Afterwards he was part of force that besieged and brutally assaulted and captured Fort Crozon outside Brest, defended by 400 Spanish troops, as well as foiling the relief army under √Åguila. This was his most notable military success, despite heavy casualties and suffering wounds himself. His youngest brother, Maximilian, was slain while serving under him in this year. Having fallen foul of his French colleagues, Norreys returned from Brest at the end of 1594. Return to Ulster Norreys was selected as the military commander under the new lord deputy of Ireland, Sir William Russell, in April 1595. The waspish Russell had been governor of Flushing, but the two men were on bad terms. Sir Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex had wanted his men placed as Russell's subordinates, but Norreys rejected this and was issued with a special patent that made him independent of the lord deputy's authority in Ulster. It was expected that the terror of the reputation he had gained in combatting the Spanish would be sufficient to cause the rebellion to collapse. Norreys arrived at Waterford in May 1595, but was struck with malaria on disembarking. In June, he set out from Dublin with 2,900 men and artillery, with Russell trailing him through Dundalk. After flourishing his letters patent at Drogheda upon the proclamation of Hugh O'Neill, 3rd Earl of Tyrone, as a traitor, Norreys made his headquarters at Newry and fortified Armagh cathedral. On learning that artillery was stored at Newry, Tyrone dismantled his stronghold of Dungannon castle and entered the field. Norreys camped his troops along the River Blackwater, while Tyrone roamed the far bank; a ford was secured but no crossing was attempted because there was no harvest to destroy and a tour within enemy territory would have been futile. So long as Russell was with the army, Norreys refused to assume full responsibility, which prompted the lord deputy to return to Dublin in July 1595, leaving his commander a free hand in the conquest of Ulster. But already, Norreys had misgivings: he thought the task impossible without reinforcements and accused Russell of thwarting him and of concealing from the London government the imperfections of the army. He informed the queen's secretary, Sir William Cecil, that the rebels were far superior in strength, arms and munitions to those previously encountered, and that the English needed commensurate reinforcement. So quickly did the situation deteriorate, that Norreys declined to risk marching his troops 10 miles through the Moyry Pass, from Newry to Dundalk, choosing instead to move them by sea; but in a blow to his reputation, Russell confounded him later that summer by brazenly marching up to the Blackwater with little difficulty. More troops were shipped into Ireland, and the companies were ordered to take on 20 Irishmen apiece, which was admitted to be risky. But Norreys still complained that his units were made up of poor old ploughmen and rogues. Tyrone presented Norreys with his written submission, but this was rejected on the advice of the Dublin council, owing to Tyrone's demand for recognition of his local supremacy. Norris could not draw his enemy out and decided to winter at Armagh, which he revictualled in September 1595. But a second trip was necessary because of a lack of draught horses, and on the return march, while fortifying a pass between Newry and Armagh, Norreys was wounded in the arm and side (and his brother too) at the Battle of Mullabrack near modern-day Markethill, where the enemy cavalry was noted to be more enterprising than had been expected. (Norreys had once commented that Irish cavalry was fit only to catch cows.) The rebels had also attacked in the Moyry pass upon the army's first arrival but had been repelled. With approval from London, Norreys backed off Tyrone, for fear of Spanish and papal intervention, and a truce was arranged, to expire on 1 January 1596; this was extended to May. In the following year, a new arrangement was entered by Norreys at Dundalk, which Russell criticised since it allowed Tyrone to win time for outside intervention. To Russell's way of thinking, Norreys was too well affected to Tyrone, and his tendency to show mercy to the conquered was wholly unsuited to the circumstances. In May, Tyrone informed Norreys of his meeting with a Spaniard from a ship that had put into Killybegs, and assured him that he had refused such aid as had been offered by Philip II of Spain. Owing to troubles in the province of Connaught, Norreys travelled there with Sir Geoffrey Fenton in June 1596 to parley with the local lords. He censured the presidential government of Sir Richard Bingham for having stirred up the lords into rebellion - although the influence of Tyrone's ally, Hugh Roe O'Donnell, in this respect was also recognised, especially since Sligo castle had lately fallen to the rebels. Bingham was suspended and detained in Dublin (he was later detained in the Fleet in London). However, during a campaign of six months, Norreys failed to restore peace to Connaught, and despite a nominal submission by the lords hostilities broke out again as soon as he had returned north to Newry in December 1596. At this point Norreys was heartily sick of his situation. He sought to be recalled, citing poor health and the effect upon him of various controversies. As always, Russell weighed in with criticism and claimed that Norreys was feigning poor health in Athlone and seeking to have the lord deputy caught up in his failure. An analysis of this situation in October 1596, which was backed by the Earl of Essex, had it that Norreys's style was \\"to invite to dance and be merry upon false hopes of a hollow peace\\". This approach was in such contrast to Russell's instincts that there was a risk of collapse in the Irish government. In the end, it was decided in late 1596 to remove both men from Ulster, sending Russell back to England and Norreys to Munster. Being unclear as to how Dublin wanted to deal with him, Norreys remained at Newry negotiating with Tyrone, while Russell was replaced as lord deputy by Thomas Burgh, 7th Baron Strabolgi. Burgh too had been on bad terms with Norreys during his tour of duty in the Low Countries, and was an Essex man to boot, a point which had grated with Cecil, who maintained his confidence in the experience command of Norreys. Although he did meet the new lord deputy at Dublin \\"with much counterfeit kindness\\", Norreys felt the new appointment as a disgrace upon himself. Death Norreys returned to Munster to serve as president, but his health was fragile and he soon sought leave to give up his responsibilities. He complained that he had \\"lost more blood in her Majesty's service than any he knew\\". At his brother's house in Mallow, he developed gangrene, owing to poor treatment of old wounds, and was also suffering from a settled melancholia over the disregard by the crown of his 26 years service. On 3 September 1597 he went up to his chamber, where he died in the arms of his brother Thomas.Nolan, Sir John Norreys, p. 239 It was generally supposed that his death was caused by a broken heart. Another version, recounted by Philip O'Sullivan Beare, states that a servant boy, on seeing Norreys go into the chamber in the company of a shadowy figure, had listened at the door and heard the soldier enter a pact with the Devil. At midnight the pact was enforced, and on breaking in the door the next morning the frightened servants found that Norreys's head and upper chest were facing backwards. Norreys's body was embalmed, and the queen sent a letter of condolence to his parents, who had by now lost several of their sons in the Irish service. He was interred in Yattendon Church, Berkshire - a monument there has his helmet hanging above - and his effigy (portrait by Zucchero, engraved by J. Thane.) was placed on the Norreys monument in Westminster Abbey. Legacy In 1600, during the course of the Nine Years' War, Sir Charles Blount, Lord Mountjoy, the commander who eventually defeated Tyrone, built a double-ditch fort between Newry and Armagh, which he named Mountnorris in honour of Norreys. It was built on a round earthwork believed to have been constructed by the Danes on a site that Norreys had once considered in the course of his northern campaign. Mountjoy referred to Norreys as his tutor in war, and took note of his former understanding that Ireland was not to be brought to obedience except by force and large permanent garrisons. But Norreys's conduct at the start of the Nine Years' War suggests a mellowing during his maturity. Ironically, the aggressive Essex - an equally ill-fated hero of the people - also came to temporise with Tyrone, and it was Norreys's original notion that eventually succeeded under the generalship of Mountjoy. The most significant legacy of Norreys's long military career lay in his support of the rebellion in the Netherlands against the Habsburg forces, and later in helping the French in holding Brittany against the Catholic League and Habsburg Spain. Family Norreys never married, and he had no children. Norreys is pronounced \\"Norr-iss\\".

He was a member of the national team that won the 2007 Rugby World Cup in France in addition to winning two Tri Nations titles in the 2004 Tri Nations Series and the 2009 Tri Nations Series. Botha plays for RC Toulonnais in the Top 14 after signing from Blue Bulls provincial team in the Currie Cup competition and the Bulls Super Rugby team. Botha was also a member of the Toulon squad which won the 2013, 2014 and 2015 Heineken Cup/European Rugby Champions Cup Finals. Career Botha played for the under-19 and under-23 Springbok sides before being chosen for the South African \\"A\\" team that toured Europe at the end of 2001. The following year he was selected for the Springbok team and made his debut against France in Marseille on 9 September 2002, a game the Springboks went on to lose 30‚Äì10. Through the years Botha and Blue Bulls teammate Victor Matfield formed a formidable partnership at lock for both their province and country. Botha is known as one of the \\"hardest\\" locks in world rugby, and is nicknamed \\"The Enforcer\\" for his physical play. His confrontational style has resulted in a number of controversial incidents. He received a yellow card for stamping in his debut against France. Then in August 2003 he was accused of biting and then eye-gouging Wallabies hooker Brendan Cannon, and although there was insufficient video evidence to consider the biting charge, and he was found not guilty of gouging, he was still suspended for eight weeks for \\"attacking the face\\". Cannon has given interviews stating that Botha both bit and gouged him, and Botha himself gave an interview to The Times saying that his ban was \\"for an eye-gouge\\". In April 2009 he received a three-match ban for striking Phil Waugh in a 2009 Super 14 season match, In June 2009 whilst playing for South Africa in the second test against the British and Irish Lions, Botha was banned for two weeks for a dangerous charge on the Lions prop Adam Jones in a ruck which left the Welsh player with a dislocated shoulder requiring surgery. Botha's appeal against the ban was dismissed, and he missed the third test against the Lions. The injured Jones himself later came out in defence of Botha, saying: :\\"Botha shouldn't have been banned for it, nowhere near it. I don't have any complaints. He just cleared me out of the ruck and I got caught. Everyone counter-rucks nowadays and, if anything, I was in the wrong place. He just hit me and I was unlucky. So I was surprised to see he got banned. I know we didn't cite him so I don't know why the independent commissioner did. It was just a fair ruck from a hard player. When I have met him before he seems like a tidy enough bloke so I'm not seeing it as anything malicious.\\" In a controversial move, the whole South African team wore armbands with 'Justice 4' (a reference to Botha's shirt number) written on them in the third and final test against the Lions, in support of Botha and in protest over perceived inconsistencies in the citing process,https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/springboks-seek-justice-for- botha-1.1227958 for which the South African Rugby Union was charged with bringing the game into disrepute by the IRB. In May 2010, during the Bulls Super 14 game against the Stormers, Botha was suspended for four weeks following a dangerous clearout of wing Gio Aplon. This was Botha's first match as captain of the Bulls. The suspension meant Botha missed the playoffs. On 10 July 2010, in the 1st test of the 2010 Tri Nations Series against New Zealand, Botha was suspended from all rugby for 9 weeks by an IRB judiciary for head- butting All Black halfback Jimmy Cowan, ruling him out of the remainder of the 2010 Tri Nations Series. Botha played in three winning Currie Cup finals with the Bulls ('02, '04 & '09), and was also a member of the victorious Bulls team in the Super 14 in the 2007 Super 14 season, 2009 Super 14 season and 2010 Super 14 season. He also won the Heineken Cup/European Rugby Champions Cup with Toulon in 2013, 2014 and 2015. He is now one of the most decorated players in world rugby. Honours Nominee for SA player of the year in 2003, 2004 and 2005. Voted by the french publication Midi Olympique in 2013 as the best No. 4 lock to ever play the game.

It is situated in Richborough near Sandwich, Kent, in the United Kingdom. Rutupiae or Portus Ritupis was founded by the Romans after their invasion of Britain in 43\\\\. Because of its position near the mouth of the Stour, Rutupiae was the major British port under the Romans and the starting point for the road now known as Watling Street. Additional routes connected Durovernum (Canterbury) with further ports at Dubris (Dover), Lemanis (Lympne), and Regulbium (Reculver). Earth fortifications were first dug on the site in the 1st century, probably as a storage depot and bridgehead for the Roman army. This transformed into a civilian and commercial town, which was later replaced by a Saxon Shore fort around the year 277. The later fort is believed to have been constructed by the rebel Carausius.White, Donald. Litus Saxonicum; The British Saxon Shore in Scholarship and History, page 36. Madison: State Historical Society of Wisconsin for Dept. of History, University of Wisconsin, 1961. The site is now under the care of English Heritage. Etymology The meaning of the name Rutupiae is uncertain, although the first element may derive from the British Celtic *rutu- meaning \\"rust; mud\\" (cf. Welsh rhwd). An alternative attested name for the fort, Ritupiae, may represent a clearer British form, containing the word *ritus \\"ford\\" (Welsh rhyd), referring to a crossing point between the then island and the mainland. The meaning of the -piae element remains unknown. History =Roman Invasion= It has commonly been accepted that Richborough Castle was the landing site for the Claudian invasion in 43 AD. This is because of the existence of mid-1st century ditches and fortifications on the site, and because such a crossing would have exploited the shortest route over the English Channel. The ditches and fortifications are assumed to have been built to protect the Roman bridgehead and supply depot. However, explicit details on the site of the Claudian invasion have not survived and its location is a matter of scholarly debate. The cellar of the mansio =Civilian town= As the fighting moved north, Rutupiae became an increasingly large civilian settlement. There were temples, an amphitheatre (visible as a hummock in the grass 5 minutes' walk from the main site), and a mansio (first built in 100, it was a building that went through several phases, being a guest house for visiting officials, bath house and administration building). As a port, the town always competed with Portus Dubris (modern Dover), about south along the coast. However, Richborough was widely regarded throughout the Roman Empire for the quality of its oysters. They are mentioned as on a par with those from the Italian Lucrine Lake in Juvenal.Satires 4.141. \\"Rutupine shore\\" was used as a common metonymy for Britain in Latin writers.p. 39, Victoria County History of Kent: Romano- British Kent, 1932. Retrieved on 10 May 2007 =Triumphal arch= A major quadrifrons triumphal arch was erected straddling Watling Street, the main road from Richborough to London. Its position and size suggest it may have been built to celebrate the final conquest of Britain after Agricola‚Äôs victory at the Battle of Mons Graupius. Almost high, it had a facade of high quality, Italian granite. Standing as it did between the port and the province, passage through the arch signified formal entry into Britannia (cf the similarly maritime Arch of Trajan at Ancona). Only the foundations and mound of the Richborough arch are still visible. It was demolished by the Romans themselves, apparently to provide building materials for the later Saxon Shore fort on the site. =Saxon Shore fort= Ruins of Richborough Castle Carausian coin (c. 290) of the same type as those found at Richborough During the late 3rd century this (by now large) civilian town was remilitarized by its conversion into a Saxon Shore fort. The Saxon Shore forts were a series of forts built by the Romans along the Channel on the English and French sides to guard against invading Saxon pirates. Construction of the fort here is believed to have started in 277 and completed in 285. This involved the demolition and reuse as spolia of the triumphal arch, and numismatic evidence suggests it occurred during the reign of Carausius. The fort was in area and was surrounded by massive walls, forming an almost perfect square. However, the north and south walls were constructed differently. The north wall was built by separate gangs of laborers, while the south wall seems to have been built as a single unit. This suggests that the north wall of the fort was built sometime after the construction of the south wall. In some places, the walls reached over 25 feet (8 m) in height, and were built of small ashlar and double-tile courses. The main entrance of the fort was in the west wall. The walls stand to a great height and were of such high quality that they only recently needed repointing. Though some stone buildings existed in the interior of the fort, most of its buildings were made of timber. There existed a central rectangular building built of stone, which was probably the principia (headquarters). Small, stone-built baths were also present at Richborough. =Church at Richborough= There exists an unexplained structure at Richborough that is believed to be a font. Today, this structure is almost entirely destroyed. The hexagonal font discovered during the excavations at Richborough suggests that baptisms could have been a function of this church. The church was probably built at the end of the 4th century or at the beginning of the 5th century. It seems plausible that the church was built of wood. Roman Richborough on the 4th century Peutinger Map. =Roman withdrawal= During the decline of the Roman Empire, Richborough was eventually abandoned by the Romans and after this, the site was occupied by a Saxon religious settlement. =Excavations= Excavations carried out in late 2008 of a section of Roman wall uncovered the original Roman coastline along with the remains of a medieval dock. The discovery and excavation of the beach itself has pinpointed its geographical relationship to the site's earthworks, proving that the earthworks were a beachhead defence, protecting around of coast. The site is now two and half miles inland from the current coastline.BBC News - Dig Uncovers Roman Invasion Coast.The Independent - Roman Invasion Beach Found In Kent. In 2020, excavations by English Heritage were to have explored the amphitheatre. Senior Properties Historian Paul Pattison explained that the investigation was to find out \\"what did the amphitheatre look like, how was it constructed and what happened after it fell out of use?\\".

Created by writer/artist Todd McFarlane, the character first appeared in Spawn #1 (May 1992). The name Malebolgia is derived from the term in Dante's Inferno used to describe Malebolge, the ditches (bolge) in the eighth circle of Hell, where humans who committed the sin Fraud are punished. He is Spawn's former master who serves as one of the major Lords of Hell. Fictional character biography Thought to be the equivalent of Satan in the Bible, he is responsible for the creation of Spawn. It is eventually revealed that Malebolgia is one of Hell's many rulers, a being from the \\"Eighth Circle of Hell\\" who has been around for approximately 70,000 years, forming an army in his war against Heaven and God. It has been noted that Malebolgia is constantly at war with the rulers of the other spheres of Hell, as well as at odds with Mammon. Malebolgia was the creation of the previous ruler of the Eighth Sphere of Hell named Leviathan. Whom he created from a substance also of his creation called Necroplasm. Eventually Malebolgia killed his master and took over as ruler of the Eighth Sphere. Malebolgia is one of the few characters from the Spawn universe who has made an appearance or a cameo in other Image books outside the core Spawn title and its spin-offs. He is notably absent, but as mentioned, during Chapel's rise to power in Hell when he usurps control of Hell away from Lucifer and becomes Lord Chapel as part of a large Image crossover including Prophet, Supreme, and the groups Youngblood and Brigade. Lucifer also appears in the Angela mini-series, quite different from the Lucifer in the Liefeld-laden crossover. That leaves Malebolgia and Mammon as the highest-ranking devil-like characters in Spawn canon until the actual appearance of Satan in the Spawn Comics. =Death= Malebolgia is slain by Spawn in issue #100. Spawn is offered the crown of the Eighth Circle, and though he declines, Spawn still receives vastly enhanced powers and command over Hell itself. It has become known that Mammon is a far more commanding presence in Hell than Malebolgia and later on Satan himself being the true ruler of Hell. Though Malebolgia is given self-determination and rule over a level of Hell, he is far from the most powerful being in The Pit. =Return= As Spawn issue #199 ends, the now-returned \\"Freak\\" from early Spawn canon is attacked by Clown, who rips the Freak's arms off. The Freak laughs it off and lets Clown know that he is not scared of him or any other of the Spawns because they are all \\"his.\\" Clown quickly shies away as the Freak begins to transform. After reattaching his arm, the Freak transports Violator to Hell. Upon returning to Hell, Violator regains his full strength, as well as his senses. The Freak reveals his true identity to be Malebolgia. After being defeated by Al Simmons, the Lords of Hell cut off Malebolgia's power and set up \\"roadblocks\\" to ensure that he never returned. Betrayed, Malebolgia swears to regain his true power and form and kill all those who tried to prevent his return, including the Violator who had sided with Malebolgia's greatest rival, Mammon, after Malebolgia's fall. Malebolgia orders Violator to spread the word of his return in order to spread fear. Malebolgia would be later defeated by Leetha, who took over Downing, destroying the Freak's body, seemingly killing him. Presumably, Malebolgia is still around trying to reform himself in some other way. Powers and abilities Malebolgia is respected and feared as the most powerful of the rulers, and thus the de facto grandmaster of Hell. His powers include Necro Energies like raising the dead, matter manipulation, super strength, recuperative abilities, and abilities to morph and induce hallucinations. His standing in Hell's hierarchy gives him vast power while in the 8th Sphere. His mastery of necroplasm gives him the exclusive ability to create Hellspawn and during his rule, he creates an army larger and more powerful than anything Heaven or he himself could handle. In other media * Malebolgia appears in the 1997 film adaptation of Spawn, voiced by Frank Welker. * Despite his major role and frequent appearances in the comic during its early run, Malebolgia ironically does not appear in the Spawn television series; his name, however, is mentioned frequently throughout the show, and his presence and influence is greatly apparent, with frequent allusions and mentions of him; notably, in the episode 4, a brief glimpse of Malebolgia's face and his lair was seen. * Malebolgia appears in Spawn: In the Demon's Hand, voiced by Tony Daniels. * Malebolgia appears in Spawn: Armageddon, voiced by David Sobolov. * Appears in the Robot Chicken episode \\"Celebutard Mountain\\", voiced by Tom Root.

He was nicknamed \\"Peerless Pennington\\". Born in West Bromwich, Pennington was a left-back for West Bromwich Albion for 19 years, from March 1903 to May 1922. Although his career was interrupted by World War I, Pennington made 455 league appearances for the club, captaining them to the league title in 1919‚Äì1920. He had also been a part of the team promoted from the Second Division in 1911 and had received an FA Cup runners-up medal in 1912. During World War I, with regular league play suspended, Pennington was employed in Coventry to work in a munitions factory. While in the city he made a number of guest appearances for Coventry City in the 1918‚Äì19 Football League Midland Section, a temporary wartime division operating while the main league was suspended. On the international front, Pennington earned 25 caps for England between 18 March 1907 and 10 April 1920, captaining the side in his last two matches. At the time of his final cap he was, at 36 years and 231 days, England's oldest capped outfield player. This record has since been exceeded by Stanley Matthews, Leslie Compton and Stuart Pearce. After retiring, he worked as a scout for West Bromwich Albion from 1950 to 1960 and was made a life member of the club in 1969, a year before he died in Kidderminster. Pennington was named as one of West Bromwich Albion's 16 greatest players in a poll organised as part of the club's 125th anniversary celebrations in 2004. Until the shop was bought by the Co- operative in 1934, Pennington also owned a fishing tackle shop at 33 Smethwick High Street,Image reference PHS/2690, Sandwell Community History and Archives Service where his family had lived since 1911.1911 Census The Bioletti scandal In 1913, Pennington was approached by Pascoe Bioletti who offered ¬£5 per player for Albion corruptly to endeavour not to win their forthcoming game against Everton on 29 November. p.5 Pascoe's son, William Alfred Bioletti, was operator of a football betting business in Geneva. Pennington alerted the police and after the game, which ended in a draw, he met Bioletti, ostensibly for the payoff, at which point the police moved in to arrest Bioletti. Bioletti was sentenced to 5 months' imprisonment in 1914.

A keen traveller, Kristiansen was backpacking through Southeast Asia with the intention of travelling on to find work in Japan. Finding himself stranded in Singapore and short of money, he was reduced to drawing cartoons for tourists in Clarke Quay. He found there was a demand for his quirky, childlike vision of the world, and soon enjoyed some celebrity as a cartoonist for the Singapore newspaper, The Straits Times. His television career in Singapore began in the mid-1990s as an extra for Mediacorp drama productions, but he was not taken seriously in the local market until the year 2000, when Perth-based CVA Productions began production of the children's arts and crafts comedy show Art Factory for three seasons. Subsequently, Kristiansen, together with Art Factory director Mark Hillman, co-produced a new show for MediaCorp. Cows n Crayons, Earthtree's first successful show, ran for two seasons. It was followed by Super Einstein, a superhero-themed art show, which ran for two seasons, and \\"Einstein's Tingkat\\", a cooking and arts show.

Subsequent investigations suggest that Johnson may have been the literary creation of Vicki Johnson, who purported to be Johnson's adoptive mother. The book initially appeared as an autobiography, describing Johnson's survival of an abusive childhood at the hands of his parents and their friends, his adoption by a new family, and his subsequent contraction of HIV/AIDS. A second, lesser-known book was published under Johnson's name in 1994, a collaboration with Maya Angelou entitled Love Letters To Hawaii From Aboard The A-Train. Investigation Residence at the corner of Summit Avenue and 11th Street in Union City, New Jersey. The arrow points to the windows indicated by the 20/20 story to have been the apartment where Vicki Johnson lived. When several magazines and journalists, including Newsweek and Keith Olbermann, attempted to investigate the claims of the book and profile Anthony, they contacted the woman who claimed to be his adoptive mother, Vicki Johnson. Suspicion was raised when it was learned that no one other than Vicki Johnson had actually seen Anthony ‚Äì not his agent, his editor, nor his publicist. Further concerns were raised when a voice analysis expert analyzed calls from \\"Anthony\\" and identified the voice to be that of Vicki Johnson. As a result of these irregularities, Olbermann hired an investigator, who suggested that there was no Anthony and the story was fabricated. A Rock and a Hard Place claimed that Anthony's biological parents were arrested and tried for abusing him, and that his police officer father was killed in prison. An alleged conspiracy of rogue police officers trying to kill Anthony was Vicki Johnson's justification for zealously preserving Anthony's privacy. However, no case matching that description could be found at any social service agency. Many sources find it medically implausible that Anthony could be alive, given that he has supposedly been living with AIDS for over 19 years. Most long-term survivors are actually living with HIV but had not yet developed AIDS; furthermore the medications that slow the progress of the disease were not known at the time that Anthony's AIDS allegedly became severe. With so many similarities between the purported life of Anthony and proven hoaxes such as that of Kaycee Nicole and Kodee Kennings, the prevailing belief is that Anthony never existed. Further investigation by snopes.com has turned up still more evidence that Anthony never existed. No birth records are available for Anthony and adoption is a time consuming and lengthy legal process. The state of New York has no record of a boy by that name or fitting that description having ever been adopted by anyone with his supposed adoptive mother's name. Even in a time before computers, it would have been impossible to adopt a child without creating a paper trail. Also, in his book Anthony stated that his biological father was an ex-police officer in New York, and that he had been tried, convicted, and killed in prison. However, no record exists of a police officer with his supposed biological father's name, and the New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision lists no inmate by that name having ever been incarcerated, let alone killed in prison. Were these things true, verification could easily be obtained by internet searches or Freedom of Information Act requests. Lastly, no court records exist which list a couple with the names of Anthony's supposed biological mother and father, who were supposedly tried and convicted of the crimes Anthony alleged in his book. Aftermath Paul Monette wrote a foreword for an edition of A Rock and a Hard Place, later defending the book's veracity. Armistead Maupin, who wrote a blurb for an edition of A Rock and a Hard Place, later wrote The Night Listener, a novel subsequently made into a film, in which the main character begins correspondence with an HIV-positive boy who is not what he seems. The book parallels Maupin's experience with Johnson. The story was also adapted for a 2002 episode of Law & Order: Criminal Intent entitled \\"Faith\\", with the child's sex being changed to female and the illness to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. On January 12, 2007, the ABC newsmagazine program 20/20 revealed new evidence that Anthony was Vicki Johnson's fictional creation. The photo of \\"Anthony\\" that Vicki had sent to Anthony's supporters was revealed to be a childhood photo of a healthy adult man who was shocked to find his childhood photo being represented to people as that of Anthony Godby Johnson; one childhood teacher of this man had been Vicki Johnson, who was said to have taken pictures of the children in her class. Vicki Johnson, whose real name was Joanne Vicki Fraginals, had allegedly handed Anthony over to another caretaker in 1997 when she moved to Chicago and married Marc Zackheim, a child psychologist and owner of the Associates of Clinical Psychology. In 2004, Zackheim was indicted for abusing child patients at a treatment center for troubled children in Indiana; his trial began in 2006 at the Marshall County courthouse. He was acquitted of one felony count of practicing medicine without a license and three misdemeanor counts of battery for inappropriately touching boys.http://articles.southbendtribune.com/2006-06-17/news/26952308_1_psychologist- practice-psychology-group-homes/ \\" Psychologist relieved following acquittal\\" Three years later Zackheim was found in court again, confessing to accepting Medicaid for patients no longer in his clinic, accepting payments before services had been provided or for services never received, billing for therapeutic services when no licensed therapist was on site, billing for more expensive therapy services than provided, and fabricating diagnosis. In 2009 Marc Allen Zackheim was charged and sentenced to prison in federal court on felony charges for aiding and abetting health care fraud.United States of America vs Marc Allen Zackheim, Case Number: 3:09-CR-00021(01)RM, The US Attorney Charges, March 2, 2009, Chief Judge US District Court Robert L.

ABC also reported that Johnson and Zackheim have both died since their original 2007 story. Since the alleged death of Vicki Johnson, Anthony has seemingly vanished and has not been in contact with any of his previous supporters, lending credence to the assertion that he never existed. Since Vicki has supposedly died, the truth or fiction of Anthony and his story cannot be verified, leaving the story without resolution. Though the majority of people now believe that he never existed, there are still some people that believe that Anthony is/was real, and with the death of Vicki Johnson, their claims cannot be completely disproven.\\"Not Believing in 'Tony'\\" .

Esoteric is half the hip hop duo 7L & Esoteric, a third of Czarface and is a member of underground hip-hop collectives Army of the Pharaohs and Demigodz. He started his solo career in 2007. Career =1993-1996: Early career and \\"7L & Esoteric\\"= The duo formed in 1993 when Esoteric DJed a hip hop show at a college radio station, WMWM 91.7FM north of Boston. 7L, a DJ and producer who listened to the show, contacted Esoteric in the interest of collaborating. The two found they shared a common love of the golden age of hip-hop and decided to form a group. After performing for some time in the Boston/Cambridge underground, the duo, with MC Karma known at the time as God Complex, released their first single in 1996. The b-side \\"Secret Wars\\" gained a lot of attention as Esoteric paid tribute to the heroes of Marvel Comics in rhyme form. This led to the release of the Rebel Alliance LP, featuring acts such as Virtuoso, Mr. Lif, and Force Five. Also at this time the two dropped the God Complex moniker becoming simply 7L & Esoteric. =1997-1999: Rebel Alliance & Army of the Pharaohs= Soon after, 7L & Esoteric put out their first 12‚Äù with re-mastered versions of their Rebel Alliance songs ‚ÄúProtocol‚Äù and ‚ÄúBe Alert.‚Äù \\"Be Alert\\", the B-side on the record, began to receive significant radio play, due to its unique sampling of the Transformers' TV theme song. The track, which was produced by Beyonder, became very popular in the underground scene, leading the duo to several European tours, major label interest, and becoming one of the first New England hip-hop acts to appear on the world-famous Stretch & Bobbito WKCR radio show in NYC and get spins on the Wake Up Show with MTV's Sway & King Tech. URB Magazine had chosen 7L & Esoteric for their \\"Next 100\\" issue in 1997. The duo then dropped the ‚ÄúDef Rhymes‚Äù single though Landspeed Distribution which earned them press in the Source. ‚ÄúDef Rhymes‚Äù was also featured on the EP, Speaking Real Words, released in 1999. The album also featured Wu-Tang Clan member Inspectah Deck on the title track. During promotion for the 12\\", Esoteric had spent time in Philadelphia and formed the supergroup Army of the Pharaohs with Jedi Mind Tricks frontman Vinnie Paz. Esoteric would appear three times on Jedi Mind Tricks breakthrough album Violent By Design in 2000. =2000-2005: The Soul Purpose & DC2: Bars of Death= 7L & Esoteric released their debut LP The Soul Purpose in the summer of 2001. The single, \\"Call Me ES\\" charted at #83 on Billboard hip-hop singles.[ R & B / Hip-hop] The album received the Boston Music Award for ‚ÄúBest Hip-Hop Album,‚Äù and led to the duo headlining tours of the United States and Europe. Upon their return, they recorded and released their second LP in the fall of 2002 titled Dangerous Connection featuring Jedi Mind Tricks' Stoupe, Vinnie Paz, J-Live, Apathy, and others. After taking a break from recording the duo released their third LP DC2: Bars of Death in the spring of 2004 with Babygrande Records. The album received overall positive reviews and was lauded by long-time fans. In 2006, Esoteric compiled an album entitled \\"Moment of Rarities\\" which was also released with Babygrande. This CD was a collection of previously unreleased tracks. Esoteric featured on John Cena's album You Can't See Me on the track \\"BeanTown\\". =2006-2007: Solo career start= After A New Dope Esoteric embarked on a solo venture. In October 2007 he presented his debut Egoclapper on his own label Fly Casual Records, in which he took both the rhyming and production duties. A Limited Edition version was also available, packaged with bonus CD Esoteric Vs Gary Numan: Pterodactyl Tubeway. This featured Esoteric both rhyming and producing beats heavily sampling 1980s Electro icon Gary Numan. He has also sparked some comedic video entertainment with his YouTube series Pterovision which served as a bi-weekly broadcast to the 7LES fan base. The series was initially released as a buildup to the release of Egoclapper. =2008-2010: Esoteric vs. Japan, Prison Planet and Saving Seamus Ryan= On May 8, 2008, Esoteric released another solo venture, entitled Esoteric vs. Japan - Pterodactyl Takes Tokyo. This release featured Esoteric rhyming over beats sampled from Japanese music, TV and films, such as Godzilla, Gaiking, Force Five, Shogun Warriors and Rodan. Esoteric's next collaboration was with rapper Tha Trademarc and producer DC the Midi Alien. Together they form the group East Coast Avengers. Their debut album, Prison Planet, was released October 7, 2008, on underground rap label Brick Records. The album's lead single, \\"Kill Bill O'Reilly,\\" quickly gained notoriety for its abrasive lyrics, and the metaphorical murder of the right wing American television/radio host, Bill O'Reilly, and former guest commentator, Michelle Malkin. Following responses by Malkin another single was released, \\"Dear Michelle\\". MySpace, owned by O'Reilly's employers Fox, has censored the songs and taken down related graphics as they were deemed too offensive. Keith Olbermann had featured their track on MSNBC during his show Countdown as the presidential race was heating up. On February 10, 2009 Esoteric released his first solo instrumental album, Serve or Suffer which was dedicated to Marvel Comics' unsung artist Jack Kirby and was featured in the Jack Kirby Museum and the New York Comic Con. Esoteric released Saving Seamus Ryan on September 22, 2009, which featured dialogue created from sampling Harrison Ford's voice speaking to him throughout the entire album to tell a story. The CD came with a \\"short story\\" bundled in hardcover book with 50 pages. This is basically the lyrics with some extra content. The story goes from saying goodbye to his dying dog Max, in the first track (Studio Time/Goodbye) to Esoteric's character getting shot and robbed for an engagement ring. As the plot thickens, he joins up with Indie Solo, an odd character who speaks like Harrison Ford and guides Esoteric's career as the two hunt down the jewel thief, fictional character Benny Macko. The story introduces his real life dog Logan, who ultimately inspires him to see the good in the world, an example of art imitating life. The twist at the end of the book/album is that Indie Solo was indeed a figment of Esoteric's imagination. =2010-2013: Boston Pharaoh, The Unholy Terror and Killmatic= In 2010, Esoteric released the album Boston Pharaoh to support his European tour with the Army of the Pharaohs. Limited to 500 physical copies, and available only on the European tour, it is still highly sought after and considered very rare. The album was later released on iTunes and Amazon for digital release. The lone single from the album is called \\"Palin / Vick\\" and draws comparisons to Sarah Palin and NFL star Michael Vick, citing their affinity for animal cruelty. The song condemns dog- fighting and wolf-hunting, yet also suggests that racism is alive and well in America due to the media's varying portrayal of Palin and Vick, both animal murderers, yet one went to jail for killing dogs and the other repeatedly shot wolves from an airplane and still ran for office. =2013-Present: Czarface= Czarface is an American hip hop supergroup formed in 2013 by underground hip hop duo 7L & Esoteric and Wu-Tang Clan member Inspectah Deck.

History The group (whose name, according to Swayzack was chosen to join the word \\"scapegoats\\" and the saying \\"Don't get my goat,\\" concluding that they felt the government had definitely gotten their goat at the time of formation) began in 1991 with founding vocalists rappers OaTie Kato (James D'Angelo), Madd (a.k.a. \\"the M-A-the-double-D\\", Maxx Stoyanoff Williams), and Swayzack (Patrick Shupe). Earlier lineup formations during the 1991 era featured the sisters Love and Rucyl Mills and Oatie's Brother, Vinnie Angel. . Unusual for a rap group, the Goats had a full musical band as well, which later included drummer Chuck Treece. The group recorded on Columbia Records / Ruffhouse Records, and their first album, Tricks of the Shade (1992), is considered one of the best Philadelphia albums of all time. They released two studio albums. Tricks of the Shade (1992) was produced by OaTie Kato and producer Joe \\"the Butcher\\" Nicolo) and released by Ruffhouse Records. It peaked at No. 58 in the UK Albums Chart in August 1994. Their follow-up album was No Goats, No Glory (1994), released by Columbia Records. The Goats toured with Urge Overkill, Dog Eat Dog, Cypress Hill, Public Enemy, Beastie Boys and Luscious Jackson. In 1994, OaTie Kato departed The Goats, reportedly because the other members of the group were too involved in recreational substances for him. He was replaced by vocalist and drummer Derek \\"D'Recka\\" Pierce. Soon after, he founded the group Jimmy Luxury, which signed to Sony Records in 1999. As of 2009, he holds seminars on the use of Bitcoin and various other topics such as climate change. Swayzack would cease all musical activity after the band broke up. Remaining member Madd continued to perform and produce music until the early 2000s, first with the Goats spin-off group Incognegro and later with Black Landlord. In 2019, they released a live album, Live at Khyber Pass ‚Äî July 4th, 1993, which was featured on the iTunes UK landing page for a week. In the introduction to the 2019 book about Ruffhouse Records by Chris Schwartz, Roots lead man QuestLove writes that the Goats requested his band to warm up for them, resulting in their first live show.

The name is derived from the Greek chlaros, which means lively, in reference to the ability of the fish to live for a long time out of water. Taxonomy Clarias has been found to be paraphyletic. A species of Heterobranchus (H. longifilis) clusters deeply inside the Clarias group. Distribution They are found in inland waters throughout much of the Old World, and are one of the most widespread catfish genera in the world. The genus is found in Southeast Asia and East Asia westwards through India and the Asia Minor to Africa. The diversity of these catfishes is highest in Africa. Some (notably the walking catfish) have become pest species where they have been accidentally introduced, and particularly in Cuba were their introduction was intentional. Description Clarias species are recognized by their long- based dorsal and anal fins, which give them a rather eel-like appearance. These fish have slender bodies, a flat, bony head, and a broad, terminal mouth with four pairs of barbels. They also have a large, accessory breathing organ composed of modified gill arches. Also, only the pectoral fins have spines.

Background The concept which evolved into United Van Lines originated in 1928 when Return Loads Service, Inc. was formed in Cleveland, Ohio to arrange return shipments for independent moving companies. Orders were centrally registered and dispatched, and certificates of membership were sold to independent moving companies, which paid a revenue percentage on every order handled. The premise was to enable movers, once they had delivered a shipment, to obtain profitable tonnage to haul on the return trip, instead of operating an empty van. When similar return shipment companies began appearing around the country, the Cleveland firm adopted the distinctive title, \\"United Van Service.\\" The Depression spelled disaster for the fledgling firm, as United found itself unable to keep up service with depleted revenues, and many agents broke away to operate independently. In June 1933, United Van Service was dissolved, and its assets and liabilities were transferred to a new entity incorporated as United Van Lines. The new firm prospered and, in 1941, moved its headquarters to Fenton, Missouri even though the company website states that the headquarters is in St. Louis. Fenton, Missouri is a suburb of St. Louis, Missouri. In 1947, the ownership of United Van Lines passed from the few original stockholders who held the firm together during its formative stages to a larger group of United agents, establishing the current structure. Twenty-two years later, in 1969, United established a subsidiary, United Leasing, Inc. to provide trucks, uniforms, and other supplies needed by United and other professional movers. Chevrolet Silverado regular cab from the company. To support United agents in their primary business of moving household goods, the corporation in recent years created related operating companies which offer customized insurance for movers; sell and lease equipment needed by the moving industry; and provide global mobility management services. All of these entities are overseen by UniGroup, Inc., a holding company formed in 1988 and owned by UniGroup companies‚Äô affiliated agents and senior management. UniGroup is a $1.7 billion transportation and relocation services company with headquarters in suburban St. Louis, Mo. In addition to household goods carriers United Van Lines and Mayflower Transit, logistics company UniGroup Logistics and international relocation providers UniGroup Relocation and Sterling Relocation, UniGroup owns other subsidiaries that provide goods and services to professional movers. In 1995, the company had its first billion-dollar revenue year.

Labalmondi√®re was descended from an aristocratic French family who had established sugarcane plantations in the West Indies. He was educated at Eton College and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, where he passed out at the head of the list with exceptional honours, and was commissioned an ensign into the 83rd (County of Dublin) Regiment of Foot (later the Royal Irish Rifles). He served in the Canadas, 1837-1838, carried dispatches during Mackenzie's Rebellion and Papineau's Rebellion, and was promoted lieutenant. He was promoted captain in 1844. In 1846-1849, he served in Ireland during the Great Famine, as temporary inspector with special duties under the Poor Law Commissioners.

He was appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) for his services in policing the Great Exhibition in 1851 and in 1855 was selected to attend Queen Victoria in Paris. In 1856, after Hay's death and the reorganisation of the police, Labalmondi√®re was appointed Assistant Commissioner (Administrative). He was responsible for administration and discipline, with the Assistant Commissioner (Executive), Captain W. C. Harris, being responsible for supplies, buildings and other such business. Mayne was now the sole Commissioner. One of Labalmondi√®re's duties was to make quarterly inspections of every police station and station house, with every tour of inspection taking nineteen days. After Mayne's death on 26 December 1868, Labalmondi√®re acted as Commissioner until the appointment of Colonel Edmund Henderson three months later.

Any incidents such as injuries are also noted in the report. After rehearsal, the stage manager should check in with the director and record all the production notes that the director makes on the report. Rehearsal reports should be given to the heads of all departments and posted in a designated area for the production team as soon as possible.

It stretched over the whole of the cavea, the seating area in the Colosseum, to protect spectators from the sun. Precisely how the awning was supported is a matter of conjecture.Juvenal iv.121Suetonius, Life of Caligula 26 (Text). The velarium that covered the Colosseum in Rome provided shade from the sun for up to one third of the arena. The velarium also created a ventilation updraft, creating circulation and a cool breeze.

He received a doctorate from Trinity College, Dublin, where his contemporaries included poets David Wheatley, Caitriona O'Reilly and Sin√©ad Morrissey, and now lives with his wife and sons in Prague. He is a lecturer at Charles University and the University of West Bohemia. He has published seven poetry collections: The 'O'o'a'a' Bird (1995), Privacy (1999), Fuselage (2002), Waves & Trees (2006), The Months (2009), Close Quarters (2011) and Early House (2015). The 'O'o'a'a' Bird was nominated for the Forward Poetry Prize for Best First Collection. With David Wheatley, he was a founding editor of the influential journal Metre, which stressed internationalism and contributed to a burgeoning interest in formalism in Irish poetry. He has published three critical studies, Gathered Beneath the Storm: Wallace Stevens, Nature and Community, American Errancy: Empire, Sublimity and Modern Poetry and Between Two Fires: Transnationalism and Cold War Poetry. He has also translated extensively from Czech, in particular the work of Petr Borkovec and Bohuslav Reynek, and has written non-fiction prose on life in the Czech Republic for the Dublin Review. Quinn's work shows the influence of American writers such as, principally, Wallace Stevens, but also Anthony Hecht and James Merrill, as well as Irish writers such as W.B. Yeats and Paul Muldoon. It is characterised by a sensual lushness informed by an awareness of the violence of history, as inflected by the author's experiences of living in the Czech Republic. In its mix of formalist sophistication and openness to experiment, Quinn's work confounds perceptions of Irish poetry as rigidly dichotomised between formal conservatism and 1930s-derived innovation, a distinctiveness confirmed by the editorial decision to award him the single largest share of the 2004 Bloodaxe anthology The New Irish Poets. He has recently translated the work of Czech poet Ivan Blatn√Ω.

Irish Journal of Medical Science (1926-1967), 33(6): 288-292, June, 1958 Lison was born in Trazegnies, Belgium. He studied medicine at the Universite Libre de Bruxelles, graduating in 1931. Deciding for a career in experimental biological research, Lison started to work in histology, developing a number of new techniques for dyeing specific substances present in a slice of tissue. Before the advent of radiolabeling, this was the only group of techniques which could infer function based on biochemical activity and it represented a great promise not only for basic science, such as physiology and pharmacology, but for pathology and laboratory diagnosis of diseases, as well. He developed the Lison-Dunn stain, a technique using leuco patent blue V and hydrogen peroxidase to demonstrate hemoglobin peroxidase in tissues and smears. In 1936, Lison wrote a landmark paper, where he stated precisely the scientifically acceptable criteria to develop techniques of morphological evidence of cytochemical processes. In 1950, together with J. Pasteels, he developed a new histophotometer and a technique which he used extensively to quantify DNA content in several types of cells, present in chromatin (chromosomes in the nucleolus). This approach became a widely used laboratory tool in the beginning of the new science of molecular biology and genetics. In 1951, using this technique with the Feulgen reaction, both authors studied the amount of DNA in the nuclei of developing sea urchin eggs and showed for the first time the important fact that each time that morphogenesis is accompanied by an intense mitosis, the amount of nuclear DNA is increased in this region. Lison also contributed extensively to the understanding of metachromasy, the histochemistry of phosphatases and of lipids. In 1952, Lison published a truly monumental textbook on animal histochemistry, which became a classic in the field, unifying and integrating many concepts. With this, he was hailed as the \\"father of histochemistry\\". In 1953 he was invited by Prof. Zeferino Vaz, the founder and director of the Medical School of Ribeir√£o Preto, in the campus of Ribeir√£o Preto of the University of S√£o Paulo, to chair the Department of Histology. Europe was living through the difficult post-war years and the concept proposed by Vaz was revolutionary and intrinsically motivational for Lison and other Europeans who had accepted similar invitations. After a year of work, the Department of Anatomy of the new institution was merged with the Department of Histology, under the single denomination of Department of Morphology, under Lison's leadership. Dr. Lison became a full professor and chairman with the thesis titled \\"Influence of Fixative Agents on the Histochemical Reaction of Amine Groups\\", a very important work for neurochemistry. In 1960, he published a textbook, \\"Animal Histochemistry and Citochemistry, Principles and Methods\\", an expansion and update on his first book. Lison had a very active and eclectical mind, as well as a legendary memory. He also wrote a text on biostatistics in 1958, and 10 years later, he started also to experiment with new approaches to medical education and educational technology. In 1964 he created and was the first director of a new school in the campus of Ribeir√£o Preto, the Faculty of Philosophy, Sciences and Letters, which began with baccalaureate courses in biology and psychology. Following Zeferino Vaz's example, he invited several foreign professors to staff its faculty. After his retirement, Dr. Lison dedicated himself with his characteristic enthusiasm to agriculture. He acquired a farm near Ribeir√£o Preto and experimented with new techniques. After suffering a stroke, he famously declared his joy with it, because he had forgotten all the plots of his beloved detective books and could read them all again! Dr. Lucien Lison's only son, Michel Pierre Lison, is a neurologist and full professor at the School of Medicine of Ribeir√£o Preto. A scientific award and the main auditorium of the School of Philosophy, Science and Letters of Ribeir√£o Preto, and a street in the campus of the University of S√£o Paulo were named after him.

Simple instrumentation and signal converters carry out this conversion by filtering the signal into an average rectified value and applying a correction factor. The value of the correction factor applied is only correct if the input signal is sinusoidal. True RMS provides a more correct value that is proportional to the square root of the average of the square of the curve, and not to the average of the absolute value. For any given waveform, the ratio of these two averages is constant and, as most measurements are made on what are (nominally) sine waves, the correction factor assumes this waveform; but any distortion or offsets will lead to errors. To achieve this, a true RMS converter requires a more complex circuit. Digital RMS converters If a waveform has been digitized, the correct RMS value may be calculated directly. Most digital and PC-based oscilloscopes include a function to give the RMS value of a waveform. The precision and the bandwidth of the conversion is entirely dependent on the analog to digital conversion. In most cases, true RMS measurements are made on repetitive waveforms, and under such conditions digital oscilloscopes (and a few sophisticated sampling multimeters) are able to achieve very high bandwidths as they sample at much higher sampling frequency than the signal frequency to obtain a stroboscopic effect. Thermal converters The RMS value of an alternating current is also known as its heating value, as it is a voltage which is equivalent to the direct current value that would be required to get the same heating effect. For example, if 120 V AC RMS is applied to a resistive heating element it would heat up by exactly the same amount as if 120 V DC were applied. This principle was exploited in early thermal converters. The AC signal would be applied to a small heating element that was matched with a thermistor, which could be used in a DC measuring circuit. The technique is not very precise but it will measure any waveform at any frequency (except for extremely low frequencies). A big drawback is that it is low-impedance: that is, the power used to heat the thermistor comes from the circuit being measured. If the circuit being measured can support the heating current, then it is possible to make a post-measurement calculation to correct the effect, as the impedance of the heating element is known. If the signal is small then a pre-amplifier is necessary, and the measuring capabilities of the instrument will be limited by this pre-amplifier. In radio frequency (RF) work, the low impedance is not necessarily a drawback since 50 ohm driving and terminating impedances are widely used. Thermal converters have become rare, but are still used by radio hams and hobbyists, who may remove the thermal element of an old unreliable instrument and incorporate it into a modern design of their own construction. Additionally, at very high frequencies (microwave), RF power meters still use thermal techniques to convert the RF energy to a voltage. Thermal-based power meters are the norm for millimeter wave (MMW) RF work. Analog electronic converters Analog electronic circuits may use: * an analog multiplier in a specific configuration which multiplies the input signal by itself (squares it), averages the result with a capacitor, and then calculates the square root of the value (via a multiplier/squarer circuit in the feedback loop of an operational amplifier), or * a full-wave precision rectifier circuit to create the absolute value of the input signal, which is fed into a log amplifier, doubled and fed into an exponential amplifier as a means of deriving the square-law transfer function x^2 = e^{2 \\\\ln{x}}, and then the time-average and square root are performed, similarly to above, * a log-domain precision detector (Blackmer RMS detector) also computes logarithm of absolute value of the input signal, however, time- averaging is performed on the logarithm, rather than square, of input. Output is logarithmic (decibel scale), with a fast attack but slow and linear decay. * a field-effect transistor may be used to directly create the square-law transfer function, before time-averaging. Unlike thermal converters they are subject to bandwidth limitations which makes them unsuitable for most RF work. The circuitry before time averaging is particularly crucial for high-frequency performance. The slew rate limitation of the operational amplifier used to create the absolute value (especially at low input signal levels) tends to make the second method the poorest at high frequencies, while the FET method can work close to VHF. Specialist techniques are required to produce sufficiently accurate integrated circuits for complex analog calculations, and very often meters equipped with such circuits offer true RMS conversion as an optional extra with a significant price increase.

It is the most northerly cathedral in the United Kingdom, a fine example of Romanesque architecture built for the bishops of Orkney when the islands were ruled by the Norse Earls of Orkney. It is owned not by the church, but by the burgh of Kirkwall as a result of an act of King James III of Scotland following Orkney's annexation by the Scottish Crown in 1468. It has its own dungeon. Construction began in 1137, and it was added to over the next 300 years. The first bishop was William the Old, and the diocese was under the authority of the Archbishop of Nidaros in Norway. It was for Bishop William that the nearby Bishop's Palace was built. Before the Reformation, the cathedral was presided over by the Bishop of Orkney, whose seat was in Kirkwall. Foundation The Orkneyinga Saga tells how bloodthirsty intrigue and saintly piety led to the cathedral's foundation. Other accounts tell a similar, though slightly less saintly, tale. alt=Colour photograph of the exterior of St Magnus Cathedral, Kirkwall Orkney, showing the main entrance =Martyrdom of St Magnus= St Magnus had a reputation for piety and gentleness. On a raid led by the King of Norway on Anglesey, Wales, Magnus refused to fight and stayed on board singing psalms. King Eystein II of Norway granted him a share of the earldom of Orkney held by his cousin H√•kon, and they ruled amicably as joint Earls of Orkney from 1105 to 1114. Their followers fell out, and the two sides met at a thing (assembly) on Orkney Mainland, ready to do battle. Peace was negotiated and the Earls arranged to meet each other on the small island of Egilsay, each bringing only two ships. Magnus arrived on 16 April 1116 (or 1117) with his two ships, but then H√•kon treacherously turned up with eight ships. Magnus was captured and offered to go into exile or prison, but an assembly of chieftains insisted that one earl must die. H√•kon's standard bearer refused to execute Magnus, and an angry H√•kon made his cook Lifolf kill Magnus by striking him on the head with an axe. Magnus was buried in the Christchurch at Birsay. The rocky area around his grave miraculously became a green field, and there were numerous reports of miraculous happenings and healings. William the Old, Bishop of Orkney, warned that it was \\"heresy to go about with such tales\\", then was struck blind in his Birsay cathedral and subsequently had his sight restored after praying at the grave of Magnus, not long after visiting Norway (and perhaps meeting Earl R√∂gnvald Kolsson). =Earl R√∂gnvald founds the cathedral= Gunhild, sister of Magnus, had married Kol, and the king of Norway granted their son R√∂gnvald Kolsson the right to his uncle's earldom in 1129. Earl R√∂gnvald eventually took a fleet to Orkney, but the islanders resisted and Earl Paul who had succeeded H√•kon would not give up control without a fight. Then, Earl R√∂gnvald Kolsson was advised by his father Kol to promise the islanders to \\"build a stone minster at Kirkwall more magnificent than any in Orkney, that you'll have [it] dedicated to your uncle the holy Earl Magnus and provide it with all the funds it will need to flourish. In addition, his holy relics and the episcopal seat must be moved there [from Birsay]\\". Meanwhile, R√∂gnvald secretly had Paul kidnapped and shipped away, later to be murdered in Caithness. R√∂gnvald duly became Earl of Orkney. alt=Colour photograph of the interior of St Magnus Cathedral, Kirkwall Orkney In 1135, Magnus was canonised, with 16 April becoming St Magnus' day. His remains were moved east to St Olaf's Kirk in the small settlement known as Kirkjuv√°gr, meaning \\"church bay\\", now Kirkwall. Work on the cathedral began in 1137, under the direction of Kol. When funds ran short, Kol advised R√∂gnvald to restore odal rights for cash payment. In 1158, while work was still under way, R√∂gnvald was killed by a Scottish chieftain. His bones were brought to the cathedral and he was canonised in 1192, though the records of his sainthood are missing. R√∂gnvald's bones were found and re-interred during work on the building in the 19th century. Architecture and history alt=Florr plan of St Magnus Cathedral, Kirkwall Orkney The Romanesque cathedral begun in 1137 has fine examples of Norman architecture, attributed to English masons who may have worked on Durham Cathedral. The masonry uses red sandstone quarried near Kirkwall and yellow sandstone from the island of Eday, often in alternating courses or in a chequerboard pattern to give a polychrome effect. As completed during the 12th century, the original cathedral had three aisled bays to the chancel with the bay at the east end shorter, and apsed in a similar way to the original apse at Durham, a transept with single east chapel, and eight bays to the nave as at Durham and Dunfermline Abbey. When the cathedral was ready for consecration the relics of St Magnus were enshrined in it. In 1917, a hidden cavity in a column was found, containing a box with bones including a skull showing a wound consistent with a blow from an axe. The original cathedral comprises the choir of today's church. alt=Mary Young monument, St Magnus Cathedral, Kirkwall In the late 12th and early 13th century, the building was extended to the east with vaulting throughout, and, in the late 14th century, the present lower front was joined to the rest of the building. These later elements introduced the Gothic style with pointed arches. In 1468, when Orkney was annexed for Scotland by King James III, St Magnus Cathedral came under the control of the Archbishop of St Andrews; the Bishops of Aberdeen and Orkney were subsequently of Scots rather than Scandinavian origin. Most notable amongst them was Bishop Robert Reid, who presided at St Magnus from 1541 to 1558. The Protestant Reformation in 1560 had a less dramatic effect on St Magnus Cathedral than in some other parts of Scotland, but the church had a narrow escape in 1614. Government forces suppressing the rebellion of Robert, the son of Patrick Stewart, 2nd Earl of Orkney, had besieged and destroyed Kirkwall Castle and intended to destroy St. Magnus Cathedral after rebels had hidden inside. The bishop James Law intervened to prevent them from carrying out this plan. Major work was undertaken on the cathedral in 1908 by the architect George Mackie Watson: this included replacing the dumpy slated pyramid atop the tower with a taller spire clothed in copper sheeting. As a result, today's cathedral looks much more as it did until its original spire was struck by lightning in the late 17th century. Restoration and renovation work on the building continues, with increased urgency since it was discovered in the 1970s that the west end of the cathedral was in danger of collapsing away from the remainder of the structure. Other work has progressed further, and to celebrate its 850th anniversary in 1987 Queen Elizabeth II unveiled a magnificent new west window. St. Magnus is the only wholly mediaeval Scottish cathedral, and one of the best-preserved buildings of the era in Britain. alt=Doorway detail The cathedral contains memorials to prominent Orcadians including explorers William Balfour Baikie and Dr John Rae, writers Eric Linklater, George Mackay Brown and Edwin Muir, artist Stanley Cursiter and psychiatrist Sir Thomas Clouston. =Bishop's Palace= At the same time as the original cathedral was being constructed, the Bishop's Palace was built nearby for William the Old, with a large rectangular hall above vaulted store rooms. King Haakon IV of Norway, overwintering after his defeat at the Battle of Largs, died here in December 1263, marking the end of Norse rule over the Outer Hebrides. The King was buried in St Magnus Cathedral until the weather was good enough to return his remains to Bergen. The palace fell into ruins, then after 1540 was restored by Bishop Robert Reid who added a round tower, the \\"Moosie Toor\\". He presided at St Magnus from 1541 to 1558 and, incidentally, also founded the University of Edinburgh. The ruins of the Bishop's Palace are open to the public (see Historic Scotland). Opposite the Bishop's Palace, the ruins of the Earl's Palace give a reminder of the cruel reign of the Stewart Earls of Orkney during the late 16th and early 17th centuries; they too are open to the public. =Bells= There are four bells in St Magnus, donated in 1528 by Bishop Robert Maxwell. The smallest bell bears no inscription or date and was not hung. According to the antiquary Sir Henry Edward Leigh Dryden, fourth and seventh Dryden baronet (1818‚Äì1899), \\"They are not and probably never have been rung by the common processes of wheel or crank but by a rope applied so as by a lateral traction to make the tongue strike the side. One end of a short rope is fastened to the tongue and the other to the wall; a second rope is fastened to the middle of the first and the lower end of it pulled by the ringer, which of course pulls the tongue to one side. The notes produced by the bells are not at diatonic intervals, being about five quarter tones apart. They are about G ¬º tone sharp, A ¬Ω tone sharp, –° ¬º tone sharp. The second bell is used for the clock and is struck by the clock hammer on the outside, giving, when so struck, a note lower than that given when struck by the tongue.\\" The third bell is described as \\"tenor G ¬º tone sharp\\" and has a diameter of and height of . Dryden notes that the third bell bears an inscription in plain capitals raised in two lines, rendered here in the original spelling: \\"Made by master Robbert Maxwell, Bischop of Orkney, the year of God MDXXVIII. the year of the reign of King James the V. Robert Borthwik made me in the castel of Edinburgh.\\" In 1671, when the tower of the church was struck by lightning and burned, the bells fell into the church. It is said that townspeople hurried soft material into the church to catch the bells, should they fall, but despite their efforts, the largest bell did suffer a rift. Therefore, in July 1682, the church authorities contracted with Alexander Geddes, merchant in Kirkwall, to deliver the bell to Amsterdam, where it was recast by Claudius Fremy. On arrival in Amsterdam, the bell was weighed and was found to be . It lost in casting, but pounds of \\"new metal\\" was added, resulting in a finished weight of . The new tongue in the bell weighed . Geddes returned the bell to Kirkwall on 23 August of the same year. =Clock= The original turret clock was built in 1761 by an Aberdeen clockmaker named Hugh Gordon. =Organ= The organ was installed in 1925 and built by Henry Willis. It has been maintained by the same firm ever since. A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register.

Those who could not adjust to the new way of life after Independence and the coming of military rule are dispersed throughout the world. How many stayed in Myanmar is not accurately known The term Anglo-Burmese is also used to refer to Eurasians of European and other Burmese ethnic minority groups (e.g. Shan, Karen, Mon, Sino-Burmese) descent. It also, after 1937, included Anglo-Indian residents in Burma. Collectively, in the Burmese language, Eurasians are specifically known as bo kabya; the term kabya refers to persons of mixed ancestry or dual ethnicity. History =Earliest settlement= The first Anglo-Burmese community emerged in the early 17th century as the Portuguese and Bamar people intermixed. This multicultural community was collectively known as the Ba-yin-gyi. The community was established near Syriam (modern Thanlyin) on the outskirts of modern-day Yangon. The settlement was founded by Filipe de Brito e Nicote. De Brito is said to have gone mad, having declared himself king of Lower Burma and captured Natshinnaung in an attack on Syriam, causing his outpost to be destroyed and himself executed by the Burmese king Anaukpetlun in 1613. Most of his small community of European settlers and their families was banished inland to Shwebo, then known as Moksobo; they were employed as gunners by the king and their descendants settled along the Mu River. When the British Burma Army was established in 1937, it was the Anglo-Burmans who comprised the only anti-aircraft battery. Additionally, a small band of French soldiers captured in the late 18th century by Alaungpaya, founder of the Konbaung Dynasty, was provided with Bamar wives and established a new Eurasian community that is classified as Anglo-Burman. They were employed as elite gunners under Pierre de Milard. During the Mon-Bamar conflict in the 18th century, Sieur de Bruno was acting as a military advisor to the Mons and French warships participated in fighting against the Burmese in Syriam and Dagon (ancient Yangon). Alaungpaya managed to capture Syriam in July 1756. Sieur de Bruno and the other French with him were captured and tortured. Two French ships arriving two days after the capture of Syriam, Fleury and Galath√©e, with reinforcements and supplies were also captured by Alaungpaya when he forced Bruno to write a letter to trick them. The French captains were killed, Sieur de Bruno was roasted to death, and the 200 sailors were forced to join the Konbaung army. From his two ships, Alaugpaya managed to put his hands on 35 24-pounder long guns, five field guns, 1300 muskets and a large quantity of ammunitions. The French troops with their guns and muskets were incorporated in the Konbaung army as gunners and played a key role in the later battles between the Burmese and the Mons. They were treated well and received Burmese wives. They became an elite corps, which was to play an important role in the Burmese battles against Thailand and Qing China. One of them, Pierre de Milard, was ultimately nominated Captain of the Guard and Master of the Ordnance for the Konbaung Dynasty. When they reached old age, these French soldiers were able to retire to Shwebo villages with the spiritual support of a priest of the Catholic Church. To this day, some Catholic villages are still extant in the area where an awareness of some European ancestry remains. =British administration= A prominent Anglo-Burmese family, circa 1900. The first war with the British formally ended in 1826 with the Treaty of Yandabo, with the coastal provinces of Arakan and Tanintharyi (\\"Tenasserim\\") being annexed to British rule and Mawlamyine (\\"Moulmein\\") established as the British colonial capital. In 1852, the Second Anglo-Burmese War concluded with the annexation of the Bago Region to what became known as Lower or \\"British\\" Burma. The Third Anglo-Burmese War began in 1886 after a number of social and legal issues combined with the revelation of a commercial trade agreement King Thibaw Min had made with the French Third Republic. The British, fearing the French were going to annex Upper Burma as a French colonial province, responded by annexing the remainder of Burma. King Thibaw and most of his relatives of importance were exiled to India and Burma was made a province of British India. British settlers now began to settle in large numbers in Burma, intermixing with the Bamar and other local ethnic groups, and the Eurasian community grew larger, some say larger than the Anglo-Indian community in India.see Finding George Orwell by Emma Larkin Frequently, European men took Burmese women as \\"temporary\\" wives, often deserting them and their offspring after their tours of duty ended in Burma, not dissimilar to the Spanish and French practice of pla√ßage, but legal marriages did take place. Frequently, when a \\"temporary\\" relationship ended, the European father left behind a sum of money for the upkeep of their children. Sometimes the children were removed from their mothers and placed into convent schools run by Europeans, where their Burmese heritage was often undermined. The issue of mixed marriages, particularly between Bamar women and British males, was to become a major issue in the independence movement as it further developed. Anglo-Burmans represent a very diverse heritage, their Asian heritage primarily Bamar, but also Karen, Shan and Mon as well as other smaller Burmese ethnic groups like the Kuki, Jingpo and Rakhine. The European element included, aside from the English, other European influence, chiefly Greeks, the Dutch, Scandinavians, Irish (who left their country due to the Great Famine), Germans, Austrians, the French, the Portuguese, Italians and other non-European Russians. Armenians, Syrian, Egyptians and the Anglo-Indian were also represented among Anglo-Burmans. One unusual addition to the mix was Baghdadi Jews. By the 1920s, the Anglo-Burman community was a distinct ethnic group in Burma. In 1935, colonial Burma was plagued with riots due to the country having been swallowed into British India. In response, in 1937, as Burma separated officially from British India and formed a separate crown colony, Anglo-Burmans were officially recognised as an ethnic group under the Government of Burma Act. Having European blood, Anglo-Burmans were a privileged class and became one of the dominant ethnic groups in Burmese life. They began assimilating to European customs, in particular British. Most Anglo-Burmans (unlike Anglo-Indians and the Burgher people in Sri Lanka) were able to trace at least a grandparent, if not a parent, originating from outside of Burma's borders. As such, the connection with the West was strong, and many Anglo-Burmans did not settle down as a truly indigenous ethnic group. Of course, some Anglo-Burmans did, and most of the community felt Burma was their own country, with no wish to \\"repatriate\\" to their European homeland. In fact, after Independence, the Anglo-Burman Union carried out research among the community to gauge the feeling of its people with regard to nationality. It was discovered that around 60% intended to remain in Burma and take Burmese citizenship with the remaining 40% split between staying in Burma or leaving for Australia or the UK. Along with the British settlers, Anglo-Indians came into Burma during colonial times to work on the railways and customs departments; intermarriage between the groups (Anglo-Indian and Anglo-Burmese) was frequent, especially in Yangon (\\"Rangoon\\") as both communities were innately drawn to one another. Community clubs were a mainstay of life during British rule, with most attending what was commonly called the \\"Anglo- Indian/Domiciled European Club\\". Between 1935 and 1948, Burma quickly became the jewel of the East, with a flourishing economy based on agricultural produce (primarily rice, oil, timber, gems and other natural resources). At this time, Rangoon was said to be the most cosmopolitan city east of the Suez Canal; the city and its environs were estimated to hold at least 50% of the Anglo-Burmese community. During British rule, Yangon and Maymyo (modern Pyin Oo Lwin) became principal population centres for the Anglo-Burmese, although substantial communities existed in the Irrawaddy River delta towns as well as in Mandalay, Mawlamyine, Amherst (now Kyaikkami), Taunggyi, Kalaw, Taungoo, Pyinmana, Meiktila, Yenangyaung and the mining towns of the Shan States. Although prejudice existed among both colonial settlers and local populations, the Anglo-Burmese were not held in the same contempt as the Anglo-Indians were in India, despite their similar origins and heritage. This was reflected in the Burmese derogatory term bo kyet chee kala (\\"shit-colored Indians who think they are British\\") to refer to Anglo-Indians, in contrast to bo kabya which referred to Anglo-Burmans. Many Anglo-Indians in Burma never learnt to speak Burmese and managed to get by with Hindustani, which tended to alienate the locals. As far as the Burmese community was concerned, those willing to intermingle or blend in were as readily accepted as any kabya in the days of the Burmese kings, but those who looked down on the Burmese themselves were held in mutual contempt. =Japanese occupation and Allied liberation= In 1942, the Japanese invaded East and Southeast Asia, including Burma, in hopes of creating an Empire for itself throughout Asia. Because of their European connections and appearance and fearful of Japanese rule, most Anglo-Burmans began making frantic preparations to leave the country for safety in India alongside the retreating British army. A vast majority of Anglo-Burmans made their way out of Burma by their own means, some by sea and others by air. Many were employed by government departments or were married to government employees and were able to flee on official evacuation convoys. Others stayed at their posts and ran the telegraphs and phone operations, railways and other infrastructure systems until it was too late to escape. Sadly, of those who were left behind, many opted to walk through the jungles to safety in India. This exodus has become historically known as \\"The Trek\\", and many Anglo- Burmans alongside Europeans, Indians and Chinese died en route. Those who remained behind suffered horrendously. Many Anglo-Burmese during colonial times were concentrated in and around the town of Maymyo. As the Japanese took control of the country, they found many there and simply incarcerated them in concentration camps for fear of their loyalty to the British. However, Anglo- Burmese who resembled Bamar were incognito and managed to pass, acting like the Burmans. Indeed, many Bamar sheltered their Eurasian friends and relatives from the Japanese and after the war, many Anglo-Burmans were not to forget this, refusing to take back their European names and dress, appreciative of the security and protection offered to them, and disgraced with the manner in which the British handled the evacuation of the country and the abandonment of the community. Others less fortunate during the war were interned in prison camps whilst others, particularly the Anglo-Burman women, were taken as servants and mistresses by the Japanese army, most often unwillingly. In 1944, Burma's colonial government met in exile at Simla, India. Among those who attended were the governor of Burma, Sir Reginald Dorman Smith, along with Anglo-Burman leaders (including James Barrington who was to become the first ambassador for post-independence Burma to the U.S.A. and Canada), to discuss the future of Burma after the war and the status of the Anglo-Burmese community. After Japan was defeated, most Anglo-Burmans who had fled to India returned to Burma. =Simla Conference 1944= Sir Reginald Dorman-Smith, governor of Burma in exile, met Anglo-Burmese leaders in Simla in 1944, where the government of Burma in exile was stationed during the war, to discuss the future of the Anglo-Burmese community after the war. The Anglo-Burmese delegates were: *Mr G. Kirkham *Mr H.J. Mitchell BFrS *Mr J. Barrington ICS *Mr K.W. Foster BCS *Mr E.A. Franklin ICS *Mr. W.A. Gibson *Mrs K. Russell *Mr. H. Elliott *Mr C.H. Campagnac *Mr J.A. Wiseham *Mr J. F. Blake. One of the results of the conference was the giving of an assurance to the Anglo- Burmese community that they would be allowed to preserve their freedom of worship and allowed to teach their own religion, freedom to continue their own customs and maintain their own language of English. In the Constituent Assembly of 1947, Anglo-Burmans were to receive four assigned seats in the new parliament of independent Burma. =Post-independence= On 4 January 1948, the Union of Burma declared its independence from Great Britain, immediately leaving the Commonwealth and severing all ties with the British Empire. The British left protection clauses in the Constitution and the legislative makeup of independent Burma to take account of the Anglo-Burman people including, most importantly, reserved seats in the Parliament of the newly established Union of Burma and a disproportionate number of Anglo-Burmans running the bureaucracy of day-to-day government and military operations. Aung San addressed the Anglo-Burman Union to press the issue of acceptance and the fears the community had for their presence in independent Burma. His assurances went to help with the decision by most of the community to remain in Burma after British withdrawal. However, Aung San and his entire cabinet were assassinated before Independence. This sent a ripple effect through the country and among all ethnic minority groups, who Aung San had personally addressed to reassure them of their place in the new country. In February 1948, ethnic rebellions immediately erupted throughout Burma, with the Kayin taking most of the central part of the country, including Mandalay. For a time, it was feared that Rangoon would fall to the rebels. Due to the insurrection and erupting civil war, there immediately followed, however, a stream of Anglo-Burmans leaving the country, who were fearful of what awaited them and the country since the end of British rule. At this time, about 30% of the population of Rangoon were reckoned as Anglo-Burmese. This proportion was to decline steadily through to the late 1960s. Following the British withdrawal in 1948, some Anglo-Burmans left Burma, primarily for the United Kingdom. Many more remained behind in Burma and carried on with their lives. Through the 1950s, the situation steadily declined in the country, with armed insurrections and rebellions, principally among the Kayin people. Due to the perceived suffering the Bamar had encountered under British rule, affirmative action of sorts was introduced by the government of U Nu in the 1950s, primarily due to the disproportionate control the Anglo-Burmans had in government departments and the running of the country. Many Anglo-Burmans began to lose their jobs, to be replaced with pure Burmans as the bureaucracy of the country became increasingly Burmanized. Additional measures relating to the Burmese language were introduced so that to take the matriculation exam to enter Rangoon University, prospective students were required to be fluent in written Burmese (which many Anglo-Burmans had not been taught), even though all books and most teaching were still carried out in English. =Military rule= In 1962 General Ne Win overthrew U Nu's government and established strict military rule. It soon became apparent that this new military government had other plans as a socialist, xenophobic and isolationist regime was born. Many more Anglo-Burmans left due to discriminatory measures taken against minority groups, particularly those the military deemed as vestiges of colonial rule, specifically the Anglo-Burmese and the Karen. Anglo-Burmans already in the Armed Forces were dismissed and those who wanted to join were now barred. There were mass dismissals of Anglo-Burmans from the Civil Service in departments where they had previously dominated such as the Railways, the Union of Burma Airways, Customs Department, Division of Forestry and Mining and the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs. All schools were nationalised, the principal target being missionary schools, and English was no longer taught from kindergarten level. Standards began to fall in the education system and the previously highly esteemed University of Rangoon was closed for some time, after which the Rangoon University Student Union (RUSU), hotbed of the nationalist movement during the 1930s and 1940s, was broken up by the military. Once the university reopened its doors, English as the principal medium of instruction was abolished and foreign institutions no longer accepted degrees obtained from the university. The Anglo-Burman Social Club in Rangoon was subsequently requisitioned by the military and turned into an officer‚Äôs mess and the Anglo-Burman Union was banned. During this time, many Anglo-Burmans left for Australia and New Zealand, with small numbers emigrating to Canada and the U.S.A. =Present-day= Today, some people identifying themselves as Anglo-Burmans are believed to remain in Burma. Because of the similar heritage and roles played, and because Burma was part of the British Empire as part of India after British colonizations, Anglo- Burmans were once counted as Anglo-Indians; today, Anglo-Indians accept Anglo- Burmese as their \\"kith and kin\\". World reunions of Anglo-Indians usually include many who would be classed more correctly as Anglo-Burmese, to reflect their Burmese blood. Notable diaspora A passport photo showing George Orwell during his time in Burma. The world famous writer George Orwell was an Anglo-Burman by its original definition - he spent five years from 1922 to 1927 as a police officer in the Indian Imperial Police force in Burma, and wrote the book Burmese Days on his experiences as an Imperial officer in the country. British writer Hector Hugh Munro, better known by his pen name Saki, was born in Akyab, British Burma, and like Orwell served in the Indian Imperial Police in Burma. The most famous Anglo-Burmans today are to be found outside of Burma's borders such as the Bollywood actress Helen, the late British television actor Richard Beckinsale, his daughters the actresses Kate Beckinsale and Samantha Beckinsale, British writer and journalist Sue Arnold, Japanese-British music critic Peter Barakan (), the British TV personality Melanie Sykes, the jazz musician Jamie Cullum and his brother Ben Cullum and the singer Annabella Lwin. The alternative musician Get Cape. Wear Cape. Fly (n√© Sam Duckworth) is also Anglo-Burmese. The sons of Aung San Suu Kyi and Michael Aris, Alexander and Kim, are technically Anglo-Burmese, despite not stemming from the colonial era. There is also Zuleikha Robinson, a British actress raised in Thailand and Malaysia by a Burmese-Indian mother and an English father. American television host and liberal commentator Alex Wagner, who was born to a Burmese mother and a father of German and Irish descent, can be called Anglo-Burmese by basis of heritage. Burmese writer Wendy Law-Yone and her daughter Jocelyn Seagrave, who is a U.S. actress, are also Anglo- Burmese. Australian singer and former Xfactor contestant Reigan Derry is of Anglo Burmese descent. However, there are also Anglo-Burmans still living in Burma. They include famous singer and actress Rita Fairmen (Myint Myint Khin), and famous singers Marie Conway (Tin Moe Khaing) and Joyce Win (Nwe Yin Win). Educational system Anglo-Burmans were enrolled in missionary-run schools where English was the medium of instruction with Burmese as a second language. For some Anglo-Burmans who married full-blooded Burmese, their children, whilst still being counted as Anglo-Burmans, were usually more openly exposed to the indigenous culture and spoke and used the Burmese language more frequently than their more \\"Anglo\\" counterparts.

He continued there till 1942 when he gave up his practice to become a full-time member of the Radical Democratic Party. He resumed his legal practice in the Bombay High Court in 1948 after Independence and was elevated to the bench as a Judge of the Bombay High Court in September 1957. He stepped down voluntarily as Judge of the Bombay High Court in 1969 and set up practice in the Supreme Court of India where he continued till his resignation in 1977 at the age of 68. He was chiefly concerned with Public Interest Litigations and constitutional cases, most of which he conducted with little or no fees. Activism In 1933, he joined the Congress Socialist Party(CSP) and the Indian National Congress but later left the CSP disillusioned with their vote against Subhas Chandra Bose in the January 1939 Tripuri session of Congress. He then joined the League of Radical Congressmen led by his mentor M. N. Roy in April 1939.\\"Why I left the Congress\\", Through Humanist Eyes Vithal Mahadev Tarkunde.1st ed. New Delhi, Ajanta Publications,1997 In 1940, Roy and Tarkunde, along with several others, left the Congress after dissenting on the question of participation in the Second World War. Roy advocated participation in the war against the Axis powers, while simultaneously striving for Indian independence, and founded the Radical Democratic Party to further this cause. In 1942, Tarkunde gave up his legal practice to become a full-time member of the Radical Democratic Party and was elected General Secretary of the RDP in 1944, thereby migrating to Delhi. By 1946 Roy formulated the philosophy of New Humanism. By 1948 he and Roy decided that political parties were an inadequate instrument for promoting freedom of the people and so dissolved the RDP in December 1948. He returned to legal practice the same year. Radical Humanism In 1969, Tarkunde founded the Indian Radical Humanist Association as an organisation for radical humanists. He also began editing the Radical Humanist (founded in 1937 by Roy as Independent India) in April 1970, supporting it initially with his own income. In 1973 he was one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto. Emergency During the emergency, he worked closely with Jayaprakash Narayan, providing leadership to the NGOs Citizens for Democracy and People's Union for Civil Liberties, of which he was the founding president. He also worked on the Citizen's Justice Committee and played a principal part in resisting and investigating the excesses of the period, including the 1984 Anti-Sikh riots,Judge V.M. Tarkunde, et al., Oppression in Punjab: Report to the Nation, New Delhi: Citizens for Democracy, 1985 and human rights violations in the Punjab, Kashmir, and the North-East. His refusal to consider kashmiri pandits who had fled valley in 1990 as human right victims caused much controversy and led to his dubbing as \\" Terrorists' defender in chief\\" as he regularly attacked Indian army for fake encounters and extra judicial killings.In 1995, he departed from his earlier stand of considering firing by police as human rights violation and defended UP government in Muzaffarnagar police firing and rape on Uttarakhand state demand activists on 2 October 1994 in Supreme Court.His volte face was noted by honourable bench with humour and he won the case with court ruling that there was not adequate evidence of wilful human rights violation by State government.But it led to his breaking ranks with radical humanists. Tarkunde was a board member for the International Humanist and Ethical Union(IHEU), the world union of Humanist organisations for over 40 years.IHEU Glossary VM Tarkunde Awards and honours At the 1978 London Congress of the IHEU, VM Tarkunde received the International Humanist Award 1978. The Government of India awarded him the civilian honour of the Padma Bhushan in 1998.

Sometimes they were the people within the law, like Patrolman Durugas and Senator Cabalfin. Most times they were criminals, ex-lawmen, former military and even those of supernatural origin. Here are some of the supposed villains in Medina's strips, in chronological order. *Atong Damuho (Renate Domingo) - Wisedog/Dobermaxx's arch-enemy. He started as a small-time drug-pusher.Atong Damuho's first appearance in a comic strip compilation is in Pugad Baboy One. From there he graduated to other illegitimate professions selling stray dogs for Asocena (a local delicacy),Wisedog, Pugad Baboy 3 drug horticulturist,The Baguio Connection, Pugad Baboy 3 illegal logger and poacher.Apo Hikers, Pugad Baboy XI Though he was apprehended every time, he has managed to escape prison through bribery. *Lucifer - Medina's version of Satan. To reflect the devil's ambiguous nature, he portrayed him as a homosexual (for which he calls himself \\"Lucy\\"). He appears during periods of disasters and elections, when the mortality rates rise and the trading of souls for success is high.Lucy's first compilation appearance is in the section Lindol (from The Best of Pugad Baboy) He also appears in the online story arc,named Ang Punyal ni Devlino. *The Taokoy Tribe - A group of sea monsters encountered by the Pugad Baboy Gang during their seaside vacation. They regularly surface to find healthy human specimens for their dissection studies. \\"Taokoy\\" is a portmanteau of tao (human, pronounced \\"ta-o\\") and siokoy (a sea monster in folklore somewhat equivalent to mermen, oddly resembling the Creature from the Black Lagoon).Bakasyon, The Best of Pugad Baboy *The Taonggoy Tribe - A group of cannibals encountered by the Pugad Baboy Gang during their trip to Lubang Island. They claim to be an ethnic tribe undiscovered by anthropologists (an allusion to the Tasaday tribe). \\"Taonggoy\\" is a portmanteau of tao (human) and unggoy (ape).Pugad Baboy One; Lubang Island, PB4 *Sendong Langib (General Cresendo Lagumbay) - A strict general who first appeared in a strip series in Pugad Baboy 4 called Retraining.Retraining, Pugad Baboy 4 He used his reputation as a cover for an illegal pedophile smuggling operation he runs deep in the Mt. Makulot retraining ground. This was stopped by Tomas, Ka Noli, and Robin Hound and the General was arrested. Lagumbay was released years later to form a security guard recruitment agency and teamed up with Violeta Kainam during the \\"terrorist scare\\" period.Private Investigator!, PB13 *Ka Damuseyn (first name never mentioned) - He is technically not a villain, but a spoof of Saddam Hussein during the Pugad Baboy Gang's trip to Bangui, Ilocos. He claims the rights to a plot of land where a malunggay tree owned by Ka Kwate, Ka Noli's comrade, is planted. The struggle to reclaim his plot became known as The Malunggay Conflict.The Malunggay Conflict, Pugad Baboy 4 *Devlino (Mang Danilo, surname never mentioned) - The leader of the supernatural entities that reside around the village of Due√±as, Iloilo. He poses as a faith healer who once treated Bab of his drug addiction. He failed to have the Pugad Baboy gang in his \\"smorgasborg\\" so Lucifer turned him into a poisonous mushroom.Ang Hiwaga ng Due√±as, Pugad Baboy 4 He also appears during the online story arc,\\"Ang Punyal ni Devlino\\" as the main priest,turned WPG's rat in Lucy's legion. *Anton Damien - Atong Damuho's descendant in 2078. He continues his great-grandfather's profession by smuggling drugs, as overseen by him and his three clones, Adam Carlo, Adam Alfred, and Adam Berto.2078, PB5 *Cassius \\"G.I.\\" Jones - A rogue sailor from the US Navy who went AWOL to form a white slavery syndicate in Olongapo. He was arrested by Judge Tickolas Marshall (another spoof of Polgas spoofing Judge Nicholas Marshall) and was sentenced to death \\"in any way possible\\".The Olongapo Caper, Pugad Baboy 6 *Colonel Magti - The police chief who, seeing the low \\"revenue\\" acquired from their activities, initiates \\"Oplan Paglalanse\\". The Walang Payat Gang or WPG (No Thin Persons Gang), composed of Utoy, Joma, Paltik and Polgas, punished Magti's precinct for their acts of law mismanagement and corruption. One of his prime motivations was to support his four wives and eighteen children.Oplan Paglalanse, Pugad Baboy 7 *Col. Manyakis (Lt. Col. Violeta Kainam) - A female officer who became Tomas' boss. Initially, she seemed to lecherously have the hots for him. She's actually using him as a frame-up for her bank robbery/account fraud scheme.Col. Manyakis, pugad baboy 8 After recovering from a concussion she had when Tomas tried to expose her, she teamed up with General Lagumbay years later to aid on his security recruitment agency. Manyakis is the Tagalog corruption of maniac, used to connote an extremely lusty person (a sexual maniac). *Jonas (Jose Ignacio) - A former OFW (Overseas Filipino Worker) and leader of a doomsday cult whose actual purpose was to extort cash and belongings from his rich juvenile followers. Imitating the infamous suicide rite clich√© performed by the Heaven's Gate cult, Jonas tries to persuade his initiates to drink contaminated water (instead of Kool- Aid laced with cyanide) to die from severe diarrhea.Kulto, Pugad Baboy 9 *Luna (\\"King Louie\\" Lupito Nakpil) - During President Ferdinand Marcos' regime, Louie Nakpil was a rich customs inspector. When he was investigated for his \\"unexplained wealth\\" during the EDSA Revolution, Nakpil rushed to his Tagaytay estate to hide. He was considered missing in action until he rose to piracy, joining with the Red Marlin gang, a group of Muslim petty pirates. He once had a golden retriever named Cecilia (Polgas's mother). He appeared primarily in the graphic novel Pirata.Pirata *Mr. Chan (Chien Jie Yao) - A Kung Fu master and restaurant owner who trains Bab (aka Bruce Swine, Babman The Pork Knight) in the ways of the Stoned Dragon Kung Fu technique. Chan desires to acquire Philippine land but is prohibited to purchase, so he relies on a local aristocrat named Do√±a Fe to legally own them. His signature move is the Three Stooges-esque poke-in-the-eye (which he innocently doubles as a peace sign). Mr. Chan spoofs David Carradine's Shaolin master in the TV series Kung Fu. This is shown by his restaurant's name, \\"Shaolin Temple\\", and Bab is called \\"Grass-smoker\\", just as Carradine's character Kwai Chang Caine was nicknamed \\"Grasshopper\\". More broadly, Mr. Chan could be a parody of Batman's actual Asian trainers in DC Comics.Babman, Katorse! He was decapitated upon arrest. He along with the Do√±a, was part of a conspiracy against both squatters and landowners. *Agent Echo a.k.a. Helga (Eliseo) - Polgas' fellow canine OCB agent who runs a \\"magic mushroom\\" breeding operation deep within Mt. Arayat, Pampanga. He was exposed and was fired from the OCB.Aso, Kinse! *\\"Nap and Alex Ang\\" (\\"Napoleon and Alexander Ang\\") - a pair of jueteng lord brothers in Bulacan disguised as the Chinese-Filipino identical twins who are import- export traders. The fake pair wanted to bring Rudolf Cruz, their accountant, killed, which was why they hired Igno. Rudolf later revealed to Igno that the Nap and Alex Ang who hired him were not the real ones as the real ones speak Filipino with a Chinese accent (the fake brothers speak Filipino fluently). The fake Nap Ang further revealed during Rudolf and Igno's incarceration that he and his brother switched identities with the real twins in Thailand. Nap was shot by Rudolf using a pipe and the bullet the former sent to the latter; he was taken to the hospital to remove the bullet. Alex, on the hand, was last seen washing his hands after handling Rudolf, who happens to be gay; it was presumed that he was arrested along with his goons. The real names of the fake Ang twins were never mentioned. The Angs (the real twins) are Chinese immigrants to the Philippines; they named themselves after Napoleon Bonaparte and Alexander the Great as they believed that they are descendants of a Chinese emperor.Benigno Ramos: Bounty Hunter, Pugad Baboy Sunday Comics References Each item in this list pertains to the section or story arc in which the guise is found within a compilation followed by the name of the compilation itself.

Launched in 2011, C2ES is the successor to the Pew Center on Global Climate Change. C2ES works closely with policymakers and stakeholders to promote pragmatic, effective policies at the state, national and international levels. Leadership Bob Perciasepe, the former deputy administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), became the organization's president in August 2014, succeeding Eileen Claussen, the center's founding president. The chairman of the C2ES board of directors is Theodore Roosevelt IV. Strategies C2ES seeks to contribute to the effort to solve climate and energy challenges by: * Providing timely, impartial information and analysis on the scientific, economic, technological and policy dimensions of climate and energy challenges. Examples include resources on carbon pollution standards and on extreme weather and climate change. * Bringing together business, the environmental community, policymakers, and other stakeholders to achieve common understanding and consensus solutions. Examples include collaborative efforts to accelerate the deployment of plug-in electric vehicles and a broad coalition supporting the use of captured carbon dioxide in enhanced oil recovery. * Helping employees and consumers save energy and money and reduce their carbon footprints through its Make an Impact program. Highlighting the broad mix of approaches required to tackle the climate challenge, the Pew Center produced nearly 100 peer- reviewed reports and a broad collection of white papers and briefs by noted climate experts covering a range of critical topics including economics, environmental impacts, policy, science, business, and technology. The Pew Center regularly testified before the United States Congress and met with others to share ideas for addressing climate change. The Pew Center also was engaged with governments and business in exploring options for a post-2012 international climate agreement The Pew Center's Business Environmental Leadership Council (BELC) became the largest U.S.-based association of companies committed to advancing both policy and business solutions to climate change. The Council started with 13 members and by 2008 included ‚Äú44 companies with $2.8 trillion in market capitalization, a sizable chunk of the world economy,‚Äù according to McClatchy Newspapers. It now includes more than 30 mainly Fortune 500 companies with combined revenue of $2 trillion and 3.5 million employees. The Council now operates as the C2ES Business Environmental Leadership Council. The Pew Center also served as a founding and active member of the U.S. Climate Action Partnership (USCAP), an influential business-NGO coalition calling on Congress to establish a mandatory national climate policy. C2ES has also partnered with several companies, including Entergy and Alcoa, for its Make an Impact program, which engages employees and helps individuals take action to reduce their carbon footprints. C2ES, and previously the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, have consistently ranked among the world's top environmental think tanks in the Global Go To Think Tank Rankings, a survey of hundreds of scholars and experts conducted by the University of Pennsylvania.

Ryholt: The Political Situation in Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period, c.1800‚Äì1550 BC, Carsten Niebuhr Institute Publications, vol. 20. Copenhagen: Museum Tusculanum Press, 1997, excerpts available online here. during a time referred to as the late Middle Kingdom or early Second Intermediate Period, depending on the scholar. One of the best attested rulers of the 13th Dynasty, Neferhotep I reigned for 11 years. The grandson of a non-royal townsman from a Theban family with a military background, Neferhotep I's relation to his predecessor Sobekhotep III is unclear and he may have usurped the throne. Neferhotep I was likely contemporaneous with kings Zimri-Lim of Mari and Hammurabi of Babylon. Little is known of his activities during his decade-long reign and the most important document surviving from his rule is a stela from Abydos recounting the fashioning of an image of Osiris and Neferhotep's determination that it be made \\"as instructed by the gods at the beginning of time\\". Towards the end of his reign, Neferhotep I shared the throne with his brother Sihathor, a coregency that lasted a few months to a year. Sihathor died shortly before Neferhotep, who probably then appointed another brother, Sobekhotep IV, as coregent. In any case, Sobekhotep IV succeeded Neferhotep I soon afterwards, and reigned over Egypt for almost a decade. The reigns of the two brothers mark the apex of the 13th Dynasty.  Family  Scarab seals of the \\"Royal sealer, god's father Haankhef\\", father of Neferhotep I and the \\"member of the elite, king's daughter Kema\\", daughter of Neferhotep I.Flinders Petrie, Scarabs and cylinders with names (1917), available copyright-free here, pl. XVIII =Origins= Neferhotep I seems to have come from a non-royal family of Thebes with a military background. His grandfather, Nehy, held the title \\"officer of a town regiment\\". Nehy was married to a woman called Senebtysy. Nothing is known about her other than that she held the common title \\"lady of the house\\". Their only known son was called Haankhef. Haankhef always appears in the sources as \\"God's father\\" and \\"royal sealer\\" and his wife Kemi as \\"king's mother\\" indicating that neither of them was of royal birth. The parentage of Neferhotep and Haankhef is directly confirmed by a number of scarab seals from El-Lahun where the latter is said to be the father of the former. Haankhef is also explicitly recorded as the father of Neferhotep I in the Turin canon, a king list compiled during the early Ramesside era and which serves as the primary historical source for the rulers of this time period. This is an extremely rare occurrence as the Turin canon normally only names the pharaohs, while non-royal people are excluded from the list. Beyond Haankhef, the only other exception to this rule is the father of Sobekhotep II. Egyptologists have noted that instead of hiding their non-royal origins, Neferhotep I, his predecessor Sobekhotep III, and his successor Sobekhotep IV, remarkably, proclaimed them on their stelae and scarab seals. This is at odds with the traditional Egyptian system where the legitimacy of the new king rests mainly on his filiation. These proclamations of non-royal origins were possibly made to dissociate these kings from their immediate predecessors, in particular Seth Meribre whose monuments have been usurped and defaced. The reason for this remains unknown. =Descendants and succession= Inscriptions from Aswan indicate that Neferhotep I had at least two children, named Haankhef and Kemi like his parents, with a woman called Senebsen.Labib Habachi: New Light on the Neferhotep I Family, as Revealed by Their Inscriptions in the Cataract Area in: M√©lange Dunham, Londres 1981, pp. 77-81 He also possibly had another son named Wahneferhotep. In spite of this, Neferhotep I named his brother Sihathor as coregent in the last months of his reign and when both Sihathor and Neferhotep I died around the same time, they were succeeded by another brother, Sobekhotep IV.Michel Dewachter: Le roi Sahathor et la famille de Neferhotep I, Revue d'√©gyptologie, ISSN 0035-1849 (1976) vol.28, p. 66‚Äì73 Sobekhotep IV, whose reign marks the apex of the 13th Dynasty, mentions on a stela (Cairo JE 51911) that was placed in the temple of Amun at Karnak that he was born in Thebes:Pascal Vernus: \\"Sur deux inscriptions du Moyen Empire (Urk. VII, 36 ; Caire JE. 51911)\\", Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© d'√âgyptologie, Gen√®ve (BSEG) 13, 1989, p. 173‚Äì181, available online . > My majesty [came] to the Southern City since I wanted to see the august god; > it is my city in which I was born. ... I saw the vigor of his majesty (i.e. > Amun) at every single feast when I was a child who could not yet conceive.

There are also a few attestations from the Faiyum region where the capital of Egypt was located at the time, in particular a statuette of the king dedicated to Sobek and Horus of Shedet, now on display in the Archaeological Museum of Bologna. ;King lists Beyond these contemporary attestations, Neferhotep is listed on the 34th entry of the Karnak king listEntry 37th in the numbering followed by Baker in his encyclopedia of the pharaohs as well as the 7th column, 25th row of the Turin canon.Following Kim Ryholt's reconstruction of the Turin canon. This corresponds to the 6th column, 25th row in Alan H. Gardiner and J√ºrgen von Beckerath's reading of the canon. The Turin king list credits Neferhotep with a reign of 11 years and 1 to 4 months, the second or third longest of the dynasty after Merneferre Ay (23 years) and Sobekhotep IV (9-12 years). = Chronology = Inscription on Sehel island showing Anukis giving the life sign to Neferhotep I. Neferhotep I's relative chronological position is secured thanks to the Turin canon as well as contemporary attestations. He was the successor of Sobekhotep III and predecessor of Sobekhotep IV. Since his father Haankhef and mother Kemi are also well attested and not known to have had any title beyond those of \\"God's father\\" and \\"King's mother\\", respectively, Egyptologists such as Kim Ryholt and Darrell Baker believe that Neferhotep I was of non-royal birth and usurped the throne. The military background of his family might have played a role in this.Darrell D. Baker: The Encyclopedia of the Pharaohs: Volume I - Predynastic to the Twentieth Dynasty 3300‚Äì1069 BC, Stacey International, , 2008, p. 252-254 On the other hand, the absolute chronological position of Neferhotep is debated, with Ryholt and Baker seeing him respectively as the 26th and 27th pharaoh of the 13th Dynasty while Detlef Franke and J√ºrgen von Beckerath contend that he was only the 22nd ruler.Erik Hornung (editor), Rolf Krauss (editor), David A. Warburton (editor): Ancient Egyptian Chronology, Handbook of Oriental Studies, Brill 2012, , available online copyright-free, see p. 176 & p. 492.J√ºrgen von Beckerath: Handbuch der √§gyptischen K√∂nigsnamen, M√ºnchner √§gyptologische Studien, Heft 49, Mainz : Philip von Zabern, 1999, , see pp.96-97, king No 22. Similarly, the absolute dating of Neferhotep's reign varies by as much as 40 years between the scholars, with Kim Ryholt dating the beginning of his reign c. 1740 BC and Thomas Schneider c. 1700 BC. =Extent of rule= naos found in Karnak, now in the Egyptian Museum.Cairo CG 42022, M. Seidel: Die k√∂niglichen Statuengruppen, I, Hildesheim 1996, 112-113, pl. 28. Whether Neferhotep I usurped the throne at the expense of Sobekhotep III or inherited it, it's possible he acceded to power over a fragmented Egypt. The Egyptologist Kim Ryholt believes that the Canaanite 14th Dynasty was already in existence at the time, forming an independent realm controlling at least the Eastern Nile Delta. This could explain why Neferhotep's only attestation in Lower Egypt is a single scarab seal. While this analysis is accepted by some scholars, among whom are Gae Callender, Janine Bourriau and Darrell Baker,Janine Bourriau: The Second Intermediate Period (c.1650-1550 BC) in: Ian Shaw (editor): The Oxford History of Ancient Egypt, 2000, Oxford University Press, it is rejected by others, including Manfred Bietak, Daphna Ben-Tor and James and Susan Allen, who contend that Neferhotep I reigned over the whole of Egypt.Daphna Ben-Tor & James and Susan Allen: Seals and Kings, Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research (BASOR) 315, 1999, pp. 47‚Äì73.Manfred Bietak: Egypt and Canaan During the Middle Bronze Age, BASOR, 281 (1991), pp. 21‚Äì72, esp. p. 38, available onlineDaphna Ben-Tor: Scarabs, Chronology, and Interconnections: Egypt and Palestine in the Second Intermediate Period, Volume 27 of Orbis biblicus et orientalis / Series archaeologica: Series archaeologica, Academic Press Fribourg 2007, , excerpts available online Examples of evidence for this point of view are the several attestations of Neferhotep found northeast of Egypt, in the Levant, in particular the stela of the Governor of Byblos Yantinu and four scarab seals from Canaan, indicating that he retained enough power to maintain trade relations with this region. Alternatively, recent excavations have yielded seals of Neferhotep's brother Sobekhotep IV in proximity with seals of the powerful Hyksos king Khyan of the 15th Dynasty (c.1650-1550 BC) in a closed archaeological context,N. Moeller, G. Maround, N. Ayers: Discussion of Late Middle Kingdom and Early Second Intermediate Period History and Chronology in Relation to the Khayan Sealings from Tell Edfu, in: √Ñgypten und Levante XXI (2011), 87-121 online PDF possibly indicating that the two were contemporary.Robert M. Porter: The Second Intermediate Period according to Edfu, Goettinger Mizsellen 239 (2013), p. 75‚Äì80 If this is so, Neferhotep I would have been contemporary with either Khyan or one of his predecessors, such as Sakir-Har, and would not have reigned over the Nile Delta. This conclusion is strongly debated at the moment since Sobekhotep IV and Khyan are separated by c. 100 years in the conventional Egyptian chronology. =Activities= In spite of the numerous attestations known for Neferhotep I, relatively little is known of the activities he undertook during his decade-long reign. The pedestal of Neferhotep I and Sobekhotep IV as well as the naos of Neferhotep discovered by Georges Legrain in KarnakGeorges Legrain: Statues et statuettes de rois et de particuliers, Le Caire, 1906, Tome I, available online see item no. 42022. The naos is now in the Egyptian Museum CG 42022. indicate that he undertook some building works there. This is further confirmed by the 2005 discovery in Karnak of a second naos housing a tall double statue of Neferhotep holding hands with himself. The naos was located beneath the foundations of the northern obelisk of Hatshepsut.Nicolas Grimal and Fran√ßois Larch√©: Cahiers de Karnak 12, fascicule 1, Centre franco- √©gyptien d'√©tude des temples de Karnak (2007), available online.News of the discovery and photos herePress release of the discovery here The most important monument of the king surviving to this day is a large, heavily eroded stela dating to his second regnal year and found in Abydos. The inscription on the stela is one of the few ancient Egyptian royal texts to record how a king might conceive of and order the making of a sculpture. As usual, the stela begins with Neferhotep's titulary:Wolfgang Helck: Historisch- Biographische Texte der 2. Zwischenzeit undNeue Texte der 18. Dynastie, 2nd revised edition, Wiesbaden (1983), No. 32, 21-29Pieper Max: Die grosse Inschrift des K√∂nigs Neferhotep in Abydos, Helsingfors : J.C.

It then describes how Neferhotep, residing in his palace \\"Exalted of Beauty\\" likely located in Itjtawy, desires that an image of Osiris be made in order for it to participate in the yearly festival held in the god's honour in Abydos in Upper Egypt.The Neferhotep Stela in William Kelley Simpson (editor), Robert K. Ritner (translator), Vincent A. Tobin (translator), Jr. Edward Wente (translator): The Literature of Ancient Egypt: An Anthology of Stories, Instructions, Stelae, Autobiographies, and Poetry; Third Edition, Yale University Press; 3rd Revised & enlarged edition (October 11, 2003), . Translation of the stela available online To this end, Neferhotep first enquires to his officials about instructions regarding the making of divine images said to be contained in \\"the primeval writings of Atum\\". His officials then bring him to a temple library where the writings are located and he orders a messenger, the \\"Custodian of the Royal Property\\", to be sent to the Abydos festival. Meanwhile, or possibly before sending the messenger, the statue of Osiris is made of silver, gold and copper, the work being carried out under the supervision of the king. Finally, the king himself goes to Abydos to celebrate the festival of Osiris. More generally, Neferhotep's time on the throne was likely prosperous as there are many private monuments datable to his reign and that of his brother,Wolfram Grajetzki: Late Middle Kingdom, 2013, UCLA Encyclopedia of Egyptology, 1(1). UCLA: Department of Near Eastern Languages and Cultures, nelc_uee_8764, available online and especially in sculpture some remarkably high quality art works were produced. =Tomb= As of 2017, the tomb of Neferhotep I has not been formally identified, although a strong case now exists for it to be in Abydos. Since 2013 a team of archaeologists from the University of Pennsylvania under the direction of Josef W. Wegner has been excavating a Late Middle Kingdom‚ÄîSecond Intermediate Period royal necropolis in Abydos, at the foot of a natural hill known to the ancient Egyptians as the Mountain of Anubis. The necropolis is located just next to the massive funerary complex of Senusret III of the 12th Dynasty and comprises two further large tombs, likely to have been pyramids built during the mid-13th Dynasty, as well as no less than eight royal tombs, possibly dating to the Abydos Dynasty. One of the large tombs, which was extensively plundered of goods and stones during the Second Intermediate Period, known today as tomb S10, is now believed to belong to king Sobekhotep IV, Neferhotep's brother, on the basis of several finds showing Sobkehotep's name from the nearby royal tombs, such as that of Woseribre Senebkay. As a corollary, Wegner has suggested that the anonymous, large, neighboring tomb S9 could have belonged to Neferhotep I. Egyptologists have also noted that both kings were very active in the Abydos region during their reigns. Older hypotheses concerning the location of Neferhotep's tomb included that proposed by Nicolas Grimal, that Neferhotep was buried in a pyramid at el-Lisht, close to that of Senusret I,Nicolas Grimal: A History of Ancient Egypt, Wiley- Blackwell 1994, , p.184 an opinion shared by Michael Rice. This remains conjectural, as no artefact permitting the identification of Neferhotep as the owner of such a pyramid has been found. Grimal's hypothesis relies only on indirect evidence: the presence of scarabs of Neferhotep in Lisht as well as the discovery of a shawabti of a prince Wahneferhotep \\"(King) Neferhotep endures\\" close to the northern gateway of the mortuary temple of the pyramid complex of Senusret I.The shawabti is now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, see the online catalogDieter Arnold with contributions by Dorothea Arnold and an appendix by Peter F. Dorman: The Pyramid of Senwosret I, MET Publications 1988, available online see pp. 37-40 & 147-149 The shawabti was wrapped in linen and placed in a miniature coffin,The coffin is now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, see the coffin on the online catalog which is dated to the 13th Dynasty on stylistic grounds. This together with the name of Wahneferhotep and his title of \\"King's son\\" indicate that Wahneferhotep was likely a son of Neferhotep I, who may have been buried in the vicinity of his father's pyramid. Alternatively, Dawn Landua-McCormack suggested that the Southern South Saqqara pyramid could have been a candidate for Neferhotep's burial site. This pyramid, datable to the middle 13th Dynasty, was provided with two elaborate sarcophagus chambers which might have been destined for two wealthy brother kings of the dynasty such as Neferhotep I and Sobekhotep IV.Dawn Landua-McCormack, Dynasty XIII Kingship in Ancient Egypt: a study of political power and administration through an investigation of the royal tombs of the late Middle Kingdom, University of Pennsylvania 2008, p. 207 (dissertation). Coregencies Drawing by Karl Richard Lepsius of a rock inscription from Konosso showing Montu, Min and Satet with the cartouches of Neferhotep I. The circumstances of Neferhotep's death after a reign of eleven years are unknown. His successor was his brother, Sobekhotep IV, who is perhaps the most important ruler of the 13th Dynasty. Another brother, Sihathor, appears in the Turin canon as successor, but it seems that he only reigned for a few months as coregent with Neferhotep I and never became an independent ruler, likely because he predeceased his elder brother. After this, it is possible that Neferhotep I designated his younger brother Sobekhotep IV as coregent. There are two inscriptions from Sehel showing Neferhotep I, Sihathor and Sobekhotep IV, which could mean that they reigned for some time together,Wolfram Grajetzki: The Middle Kingdom of Ancient Egypt, London 2006 , p.71-73 although Sihathor is declared dead on both lists. Another piece of evidence is an inscription from the Wadi Hammamat showing the cartouches of Neferhotep I and Sobekhotep IV on par, next to each other.F. Debono: Expedition archeologique royale au desert oriental (Kef-Kosseir), ASAE 51 (1951): 1-33. Some Egyptologists see this as evidence of a coregency between these two kings, while others, including Ryholt, reject this interpretation and believe the inscription was made by Sobekhotep to honour his deceased brother. Historical synchronism A stela bearing Neferhotep I's name is of great importance to archaeologists and historians alike as it enables a concordance between the Egyptian and Near Eastern chronologies.William Stevenson Smith: Interconnections in the Ancient Near East: A Study of the Relationships Between the Arts of Egypt, the Aegean, and Western Asia, Yale University Press, 1965 This stela depicts the \\"Governor of Byblos, Yantinu ... who was begotten by Governor Yakin\\" seated upon a throne, in front of which are the nomen and prenomen of Neferhotep I. This is significant for two reasons: first, Yakin is plausibly identifiable with a Yakin-Ilu of Byblos known from a cylinder seal of Sehetepibre, indicating that this king and Neferhotep are separated by a generation. Second, a \\"King of Byblos Yantin-'Ammu\\" is known from the archives of Mari who is most likely the same person as the Governor of Byblos Yantinu of the stela.W. M. F. Albright: \\"An Indirect Synchronism between Egypt and Mesopotamia, cir. 1730 BC\\", BASOR 99 (1945) Indeed, Byblos was a semi-autonomous Egyptian governorate at the time and \\"the king of Byblos\\" must be the Semitic king of the city ruling it in the name of the pharaoh. The archives of Mari predominantly date to the reign of the last king of the city, Zimri-Lim, a contemporary of Hammurabi who ultimately sacked Mari. This provides the synchronism Neferhotep I - Yantinu - Zimri-Lim - Hammurabi.

Not all flowers with multiple ovaries form aggregate fruit; the ovaries of some flowers do not become tightly joined together to make a larger fruit. Aggregate fruits may also be accessory fruits, in which parts of the flower other than the ovary become fleshy and form part of the fruit. The individual parts of an aggregate fruit come in many forms.

The creature is often described as a \\"part-man, part-goat\\" with scales and long clawed fingers. History Reports of sightings by local citizens of \\"a half-man, half-goat, with fur and scales\\" in July 1969 led to the belief that a mysterious creature lived in Lake Worth. Newspapers reported the alleged sightings, including one in which the monster landed on a man's car after jumping out of a tree, and another in which it threw an automobile tire at a group of people. Newspapers also published a photograph purportedly taken of the creature by Allen Plaster, and locals began driving out to the lake at night to get a look at it.Bills, E. R. Texas Obscurities: Stories of the Peculiar, Exceptional and Nefarious. Charleston, SC: The History Press, 2013. Local police investigated the claims, but found no evidence of the monster in the Lake Worth and Greer Island area. According to one reporter, the Goatman legend was spread via summer camp stories, where camp counselors told children to ‚Äúlisten carefully...and you‚Äôll hear his cry on clear nights like tonight‚Äù. In a later interview, Allen Plaster commented on the photo, described as a man-sized \\"white furball\\", that he took while driving past the Nature Center in 1969. Plaster characterized the sighting as a prank, saying, ‚Äúwhatever it was, it wanted to be seen\\". Since reports of the monster ceased when school resumed, many suspected the incidents were pranks carried out by high school students. In 2005, a reporter at the received an anonymous letter from someone claiming to be one of three high school classmates who, in the summer of 1969, \\"decided to go out to Lake Worth and scare people\\" using a tinfoil mask. In 2009, magazine published a report about an unidentified man who said that he had been a perpetrator of the tire-throwing incident. Cryptozoologist-blogger Craig Woolheater said he believes the Lake Worth monster is an \\"undiscovered, uncataloged primate species that walks on two legs\\". Popular culture Since 2009 (the 40th anniversary of the sightings), the Fort Worth Nature Center and Refuge has held a Lake Worth Monster Bash each October.

Each flower in the inflorescence produces a fruit, but these mature into a single mass in which each flower has produced a true fruit. After flowering the mass is called an infructescence. Examples are the fig, pineapple, mulberry, osage-orange, and breadfruit. In languages other than English, the meanings of multiple and aggregate fruit are reversed, so that multiple fruits merge several pistils within a single flower. In some plants, such as this noni, flowers are produced regularly along the stem and it is possible to see examples of flowering, fruit development and fruit ripening together on a single branch As shown in the photograph of the noni on the right, stages of flowering and fruit development in the noni or Indian mulberry (Morinda citrifolia) can be observed on a single branch. First an inflorescence of white flowers called a head is produced. After fertilization, each flower develops into a drupe, and as the drupes expand, they become connate (merge) into a multiple fleshy fruit called a syncarp. There are also many dry multiple fruits. Other examples of multiple fruits: * Plane tree, multiple achenes from multiple flowers, in a single fruit structure * Mulberry, multiple flowers form one fruit * Jackfruit, multiple flowers form one fruit * Fig, multiple flowers similar to mulberry infructescence form a multiple fruit inside the inverted inflorescence.

Born in L'Abord-√†-Plouffe Lower Canada (now part of modern Laval Quebec), Tass√© as a young man studied the Classics at the Coll√®ge Bourget. Upon graduation he articled in law offices in Montreal, Plattsburgh, New York, and Ottawa. However, he never practised law, and instead pursued a career in journalism. From the 1860s, he was employed by newspapers such as Ottawa's Le Canada, and Montreal's La Minerve. Though he would eventually rise to become its editor, he was initially employed by La Minerve as a translator, a role he would revisit in 1872, when he became the official translator for the House of Commons of Canada. During this period, Tass√© also became interested in the history of the Canadian West, and began to publish a series of articles on French-Canadian explorers of the west. This culminated in the 1878 publication of his two-volume work Les Canadiens de l'Ouest. After six years as translator for the house, he resolved to himself enter politics. A Conservative, Tass√© served was twice elected to serve as a member of parliament in the House of Commons of Canada, representing the Ontario electoral district of City of Ottawa. He was first elected in the Canadian federal election of 1878, and successfully defended this seat in 1882. However, in 1887 he stood for the Quebec riding of Laprairie and was defeated by only 23 votes, ending his career in the House. The loss undoubtedly arose from his support of the Conservative government's handling of the Red River Rebellion and the subsequent hanging of Louis Riel.

Macdonald, and he served in the capacity representing the senatorial division of De Salaberry, Quebec until his death.

They provided ships, supplies, volunteers, search-and- rescue teams, and more. It has also accepted some evacuees to stay in Canada. Official Canadian government response The official response by the Government of Canada to the Gulf coast disaster came on September 2, following discussions between Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness Canada and the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency. The federal government announced it was deploying a task force comprising three warships--, and --along with the Coast Guard vessel and three Sea King helicopters and one BO-105 helicopter to the area. The Canadian Forces also provided several Griffon helicopters and crews to the New England States at the request of the United States Coast Guard whose search and rescue helicopters from that area have been assigned to Gulf Coast SAR operations. Canadian aircraft were deployed as part of a North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) military assistance pact. U.S. infantry led by the RCMP outside the Canadian Embassy on September 7 to raise funds for Katrina victims. The task force was organized under the name \\"Operation UNISON\\" and involved over 1,000 personnel from the Canadian Forces and Canadian Coast Guard who were placed under the operational command of their American counterparts who were coordinating relief operations. A precedent was established with a similar humanitarian aid response by the Government of Canada following Hurricane Andrew when the Auxiliary Oil Replenishment (AOR) ship participated in \\"Operation TEMPEST\\", providing relief supplies and personnel in southern Florida and the Bahamas. The ships and aircraft had the capacity to relocate people and deliver a broad range of supplies, including tents, cots, water containers and items such as men's and women's toiletries, sun screen and insect repellent. At the same time, the Public Health Agency of Canada was in contact with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and offered whatever support was required. \\"We are really prepared to operate on all fronts as requested and as co-ordinated by the United States,\\" said Prime Minister Paul Martin. In an interview on National Public Radio, Canada's Ambassador to the United States said that in addition to the basic desire to help a neighbor in need, many Canadians also remember the ancestors of Louisiana's Cajuns were expelled from what would become Canada by the British in the 18th century, which he felt gave an extra historical dimension to Canadians' desire to help the people of Louisiana during the recovery operation. On September 4, following a request from U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Government of Canada announced it was prepared to send thousands of beds, blankets, surgical gloves and dressings and other medical supplies. The Government of Canada announced it would also send 35 divers to help with the rescue effort. One of the divers' tasks would be to inspect levees. United States Navy personnel unload Canadian relief supplies from a Royal Canadian Air Force transport aircraft in Pensacola, Florida. On September 5, a team of 35 military divers was deployed from CFB Halifax and CFB Esquimalt to Pensacola, Florida. They were tasked with assisting their U.S. Navy counterparts to clear navigational hazards, including unsecured and sunken vessels and debris, and to inspect flood-damaged levees. On September 6 the Operation UNISON task force of navy and coast guard ships departed Halifax Harbour for the U.S. Gulf Coast. The naval ships arrived at Pensacola, Florida several days later, having been delayed by further tropical storm activity off the east coast of Florida. The coast guard ship arrived several days later, due to its slower cruising speed. The Operation UNISON task force unloaded relief supplies at Pensacola and was deployed to assist along the Mississippi coast. On September 19 it was announced that the three warships from the Operation UNISON task force would be returning to Halifax, leaving CCGS Sir William Alexander to continue its mission of clearing navigation hazards and repairing buoys. On September 28, the coast guard vessel was retasked to assist the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in repairing the network of weather buoys along the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic coasts of the United States, which had been severely damaged by the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season; these buoys are one of the most important tools for forecasting and gathering data from oceanic storms. CCGS Sir William Alexander returned to Canada on October 24. Vancouver Urban Search and Rescue One of the first things Canada did was to deploy Vancouver Urban Search and Rescue to Louisiana. They arrived on a WestJet Airlines aircraft in Lafayette, Louisiana on the evening of August 31, 2005. Due to security and logistics issues in the disaster area surrounding New Orleans, the team started operations on September 3; they saved 30 people that day. They were the first outside responders to arrive in St. Bernard Parish, beating American response teams. By the time they returned to Vancouver on September 6, they had reportedly saved over 110 people. Other help CCGS Sir William Alexander assisting in New Orleans, following Hurricane Katrina. The crew of CCGS Sir William Alexander pose for a picture shortly before arriving home after assisting in New Orleans, following Hurricane Katrina. * The Canadian Red Cross launched an immediate nationwide appeal for donations to enable the organization to provide aid to its American counterpart. 37 Canadian Red Cross personnel were transported by Canadian military aircraft to assist with efforts in Houston, Texas; they were followed by dozens of other Red Cross personnel once the situation assessment was completed. The American Red Cross asked Canadian Red Cross chapters in Quebec for cots for refugees staying at U.S. evacuation centres and other services were requested from chapters in Ontario. * The Government of Nova Scotia donated $100,000 towards the Red Cross effort. This was followed on September 8 when the Government of Alberta announced that it was donating $5 million to the Hurricane Katrina fund administered by former presidents Bush and Clinton. The cheque was personally given by Premier Ralph Klein to former president Clinton during a visit to Alberta in October. * Other provinces expressed interest in providing temporary housing to those left homeless. Some residents of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island offered shelter to the homeless survivors of hurricane Katrina. Anne McLellan, the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness, announced that her department was discussing with the U.S. National Security Advisor the possibility of Canadians billeting American storm evacuees. Big cities like Calgary, Ottawa, Vancouver, Toronto, and Montreal accepted 1,200 evacuees in all . * Universities across Canada offered to take in university students from New Orleans whose studies have been interrupted. Some institutions went so far as to offer full tuition scholarships and free room and board. * Ontario Hydro, Hydro-Qu√©bec, and Manitoba Hydro, along with other electrical utilities, sent repair crews to assist in restoring electrical power service. * Canada increased oil exports as requested by the IEA to help stabilize the world market in the wake of the crisis and its impact on North American oil production and refining capacity. * On September 2 Air Canada participated along with U.S. member airlines of the Air Transport Association, in a voluntary airline industry initiative to support rescue and relief operations. Air Canada was the first foreign carrier to land in New Orleans delivering water and supplies and lifting victims to safety. * On September 7, the Canadian Embassy started a Hurricane Katrina fund to support victims in the Gulf region.

Shell rings are curved shell middens wholly or partially surrounding a clear central area or plaza. The site includes one of the largest and most complex shell rings in North America,Russo:79 and one of the best preserved circular shell rings.Russo:81 Environment More than 30 shell-ring sites are known along the Atlantic coast from South Carolina to Florida. Almost all of the sites date from 4500 to 5000 years ago for the earliest, to about 3000 years ago for the latest.One shell ring, the Grand site on Big Talbot Island in Florida, dates to 900-1250 in the Mississippian period. (Parsons:ix) The Fig Island shell rings have been dated between 4400 years ago and 3600 years ago.Saunders:47-48, 51 The Fig Island site is surrounded by a salt marsh on a peninsula extending from Edisto Island along the North Edisto River. The sea level on the South Carolina coast was as much as 1.2 meters lower when the Fig Island shell rings were built and occupied than it is now. The rise in sea level since then has led to the marsh expanding over what was probably dry land that connected Fig Island to Edisto Island in the past. The Fig Island rings cover an area of 300 by 275 meters.Saunders:1, 4, 95 Shell rings Fig Island 1 is a large and complex shell ring structure, perhaps the largest and most complex in North America. The main structure is a large ring that reaches up to six meters high on the main ring, with steep sides. The base of the main ring is about 40 meters wide. There are at least five smaller rings attached to the main ring. One of the attached rings is entirely within another ring. An adjacent shell mound is attached to the main ring by a shell causeway or ramp. There is an unusual feature at the high point of the main ring, which local residents suggested was a Civil War gun emplacement dug into the shell. As is typical of shell rings, there was little or no evidence of shells or occupational debris in the \\"plazas\\" enclosed by the main and attached rings. The complex is 157 meters wide on its longest axis. Based on mapping and probing to determine the depth of shell deposits, archaeologists have estimated that the ring complex contains 22,114 cubic meters of shell. Fig Island 1 has been dated to between 4000 and 3500 years ago.Russo:78, 79Saunders:51, 75, 79, 81, 114-15 The youngest radiocarbon dates at Fig Island are for one of the small rings attached to the main ring of Fig Island 1. Those dates are significantly later than the dates for Fig Island 2 and Fig Island 3. There were more artifacts found in this attached ring than elsewhere on Fig Island. This particular attached ring may be from an occupation that was later and of a different nature than that for the rest of Fig Island.Saunders:114-15 Fig Island 2 is circular or hexangular, more symmetrical than most shell rings, and in \\"an excellent state of preservation.\\" There is a ramp on the north side of the ring that connects to a path of shell leading to the Fig Island 3 ring. This shell path is now below the surface of the marsh. There is a small gap in the ring opposite from the ramp leading to Fig Island 3. The ring is 82 meters in diameter and is between 10 and 25 meters wide at the base. The height varies between two meters and one meter above the ground. Archaeologists have calculated that the ring contains 2,178 cubic meters of shell. Fig Island 2 has been dated to between 4400 and 3600 years ago.Russo:80, 81Saunders:51, 81, 88, 89 The smallest shell-ring on Fig Island is Fig Island 3. It is \\"C\\"-shaped, approximately half of a circle. There is no evidence that Fig Island 3 was ever more than a half circle. (Half-circle rings have been found at several sites in South Carolina and Georgia.) There is a ramp from the center of the half-circle connecting to the shell path from Fig Island 2. Pottery found in the two rings and radiocarbon dates, as well as the connecting path, indicate that Fig Island 2 and 3 were in use during the same period. Fig Island 3 is 49 meters in diameter, and is slightly less than 2 meters tall. Archaeologists have calculated that the ring contains 1,202 cubic meters of shell. The ring has been dated to between 4200 and 3800 years ago.Russo:81, 82Saunders:51, 81, 89 Occupation Ceramics found in the mounds are primarily Thoms Creek, with some Stallings. Both ceramic traditions fall in the Late Archaic period, about 3000 to 5000 years ago on the South Carolina coast and coastal plain. The earliest evidence for pottery along the South Carolina coast is from about 4200 years ago.Saunders:12, 19Stallings (or Stallings Island) ceramics were primarily fiber-tempered, and are documented from about 4450 radiocarbon years Before Present, the oldest ceramics in North America. Thoms Creek ceramics closely resemble Stallings ceramics, but have more sand and less fiber as temper than Stallings ceramics. Thoms Creek ceramics were largely contemporary with Stallings ceramics, although no Thoms Creek ceramics have been found that are as early as the earliest Stallings. Thoms Creek ceramics overlapped Stallings ceramics in northern Georgia and southern South Carolina, but were the dominant tradition north of the Santee River and in North Carolina. (Saunders:19; Saunders and Hays:7-8) Groups living along the coast had become mostly sedentary by the Late Archaic period, living in permanent villages while making occasional foraging trips. Archaeologists have debated whether the shell rings resulted from the simple accumulation of middens in conjunction with circular villages, or if they were deliberately built as monuments. The start of mound building in the lower Mississippi River valley and in Florida by about 6000 years ago is cited as increasing the plausibility that the shell-rings were also monumental architecture. Excavations of the Fig Island rings revealed little evidence of habitation on the rings, and circumstantial evidence of rapid deposition of large quantities of shells in deliberate creation of the rings.Saunders:24, 85, 91, 101 Although the large size of shell middens gives the impression that the people associated with them lived primarily on shellfish, careful excavation of middens has revealed large quantities of fish bones, indicating that the people obtained more of their protein and calories from small fish than from shellfish. There is no evidence that the shell-ring dwellers practiced horticulture, but gathered plants were exploited. Nuts, fruits and seeds have been excavated from shell- ring sites.Saunders:26 Fig Island 2 and 3 were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970, when Fig Island 1 and some of the site's other features had not yet been discovered. Further investigation beginning in 2002 identified Fig Island 1 and the mound and causeway features, leading to the site's designation as a National Historic Landmark in 2007.

Population is 341,412 (2013 est) of which 141,360 live in the city of Niƒüde. The population was 348,081 in 2000 and 305,861 in 1990. It covers an area of 7,312 km2. Neighbouring provinces are Kayseri, Adana, Mersin, Konya, Aksaray and Nev≈üehir. The province is surrounded on three sides by mountain ranges: the Taurus Mountains, Mount Hasan, and the Melendiz mountains. To the west lies the plain of Emen, which opens up into the wide plain of Konya. The plain is covered with nutritious volcanic soil and Niƒüde is a successful agricultural region, particularly apples and potatoes. Surrounded by mountains and at a fairly high altitude the area has a dry and chilly climate and is exposed to snows brought by cold north winds in winter. Average rainfall 0.9 mm, 78.5 mm in April, practically zero in July and August. Therefore, the hillsides are more or less bare of vegetation, with some forest at the higher altitudes. (see Niƒüde for more information about the provincial capital city). Districts Niƒüde province is divided into 6 districts (capital district in bold): *Altunhisar *Bor *√áamardƒ± *√áiftlik *Niƒüde *Ulukƒ±≈üla Some of the towns within these districts are Bademdere, Bah√ßeli, √áiftehan, Darboƒüaz, Fertek and Kemerhisar. Etymology Known in antiquity as Nakita or Nahita the named has mutated through Nekid√¢, Nekide and Nikde to today's Niƒüde. History An old photograph of Niƒüde city center The area has been settled since the Neolithic period of 8000-5500 BC, as proved excavations of burial mounds h√∂y√ºk in the district of Bor, and tin mines on the district of √áamardƒ± -Keste. The area was later settled by the Hittites, who lived here for a thousand years up until 800BC. The name NigÀòde first occurs in written sources in the form na-hi-ti-ia in a Luwian inscription of king Saruanis from Andaval as was pointed out by Ignace Gelb (Hittite Hieroglyphs II [1935] pp. 17‚Äì18). Then came Assyrians and Phrygians, Greeks, Armenians, Persians, Alexander the Great, Romans, who built the city of Tyana with its palaces and waterworks. Roman rule persisted from the Eastern capital of Byzantium until the area was occupied by the Seljuk Turks from 1166 onwards. By the early 13th century Niƒüde was one of the largest cities in Anatolia and a number of impressive mosques and tombs date from this period. The area was brought within the Ottoman Empire in 1471 and thus passed into the territory of the Turkish Republic in the 1920s. In 2016, archaeologists discovered in Kƒ±nƒ±k Mound, an archeological site located in Ye≈üilyurt village of Altunhisar district at Niƒüde province, a temple dating back to the late Persian era. In 2018, they discovered an ancient Hellenistic temple and a bull statue made from ceramics.Ancient Hellenistic temple unearthed in central Turkey Niƒüde today A fa√ßade detail from Eskig√ºm√º≈ü Monastery Niƒüde benefits from its rich agriculture, its apples are particularly famous, and its location between the wealthy regions of Konya and Adana on the Mediterranean coast. Also because the province is near the tourist attractions of Cappadoccia it is close to the airports of Kayseri and Nev≈üehir. As well as apples important crops include potatoes, cabbages, grain and sugar beet. Niƒüde is Turkey's biggest potato growing region and has the most apple trees (although newer plantings in other provinces are achieving greater production). Meat and dairy are also important activities along with beekeeping and more recently trout farms. Niƒüde has a rich tradition of folk culture including song and dance and the famous proverb (the Turkish equivalent of \\"the early bird catches the worm\\") - \\"Bor's eastern market is over, ride your donkey to Niƒüde\\".Ge√ßti Bor'un pazarƒ± s√ºr e≈üeƒüini Niƒüde'ye Another Niƒüde tradition is to plum someone (Erikletmek) meaning if you have visitors sit them in the garden and fill them up with plums (or other fruit) so you don't have to give them dinner. Places of interest A view from Aladaƒülar in the province The Aladaƒülar and Bolkar mountain ranges in the Taurus mountains are popular for winter sports, climbing and trekking through the high meadows and mountain villages. The mountains are particularly attractive when the hills are covered in spring flowers. *The Aladaglar mountains in particular are one of the most popular climbing venues in Turkey. Although the Aladaglar mountains border on their namesake Aladaƒü District, in Adana Province, they are generally reached from the villages of Demirkazƒ±k and √áukurbaƒü in √áamardƒ±. *The Bolkar mountains have a 7 km ski-run and a crater lake. Niƒüde is part of Cappadoccia and does attract some tourists to its historical sites, although nothing like as many as the centre of the area in Nev≈üehir. Sites of historical importance in Niƒüde include many churches, mosques and underground cities (safe-havens cut deep down into the soft volcanic rock). Another important site is the ancient city of Tyana and a number of Roman waterways in the district of Bor. An important underground city and ancient monastery is located in G√ºm√º≈üler, Niƒüde, called G√ºm√º≈üler Monastery. In Ulukƒ±≈üla, √ñk√ºz Mehmet Pasha Complex, a k√ºlliye is a 17th-century structure. Niƒüde also has a number of mineral hot-springs and other attractions, so with a little investment in hotels and other infrastructure the province could attract more tourists than at present.

M√°ria Val√©ria Bridge The M√°ria Val√©ria bridge joins Esztergom in Hungary and ≈†t√∫rovo in Slovakia, across the River Danube. The bridge is some 500 metres in length. It is named after Archduchess Marie Valerie of Austria, (1868‚Äì1924), the fourth child of Emperor Franz Josef, and Elisabeth. The bridge was designed by J√°nos Feketeh√°zy in 1893; he built several bridges on the Danube, including the Liberty bridge in Budapest and the Elisabeth bridge between Kom√°rno and Kom√°rom. Since its opening on 28 September 1895, the bridge has been destroyed twice. On 22 July 1919 the bridge was destroyed by a detonation at its first pier on its western side but the bridge was renovated in 1922 and completely reconstructed in 1926. During World War II, retreating German troops blew up the bridge on 26 December 1944 along with other bridges near Esztergom. Decades of intransigence between the Communist governments of Hungary and Czechoslovakia meant that the bridge was not rebuilt until the new millennium, finally reopening on 11 October 2001. Half the costs of the project were covered by a 10 million Euro grant from the European Union, as part of the EU PHARE project to assist applicant countries in their preparations to join the EU. The re- opening was marked with the issue of a Slovak stamp.Postage stamps of the Slovak Republic The rebuilding of the bridge helped the local economy in the Ister-Granum Euroregion. Because Slovakia and Hungary are part of the Schengen Area there are no border controls on the bridge. Both countries became part of the Schengen Area on 12 December 2007, allowing all immigration and customs checks to be lifted. As a young man, the travel writer Patrick Leigh Fermor walked from the Hook of Holland to Constantinople in 1933/34.

Wressle village has a late 18th-century church, St John, and on the western fringe of the village is the Grade I listed structure and scheduled monument, the ruins of Wressle Castle. Wressle railway station is located within the village. The parish includes the hamlets of Brind, Newsholme and Loftshome. Wressle lies within the Parliamentary constituency of Haltemprice and Howden an area that mainly consists of middle class suburbs, towns and villages. The area is affluent, placed as the 10th most affluent in the country in a Barclays Private Clients survey, and has one of the highest proportions of owner-occupiers in the country. Geography The civil parish of Wressle is bounded by the civil parishes of Hemingbrough and Cliffe in the county of North Yorkshire to the west, separated by the River Derwent; by Bubwith to the north, separated by the Fleet Dike; by Spaldington and Howden to the east; and by Asselby and Barmby on the Marsh to the south.Ordnance Survey. 1:25000. 2006 The civil parish contains Wressle and the hamlets of Brind and Newsholme. The place of Loftsome lies less than south of Wressle on the bank of the Derwent. The Hull to Selby railway line runs east-west through the parish, passing Wressle on the southern edge, and the A63 also passes east-west through the southern part of the parish, skirting Newsholme, and passing Loftsome Bridge. The parish contains predominately agricultural land at around above sea level. According to the 2011 UK Census, Wressle parish had a population of 271, an increase on the 2001 UK Census figure of 261. History =Wressle Castle= Wressle Castle was a quadrangular castle originally was built for Thomas Percy in around 1380. =Wressle village= Church of St John of Beverley (2006) Wressle was listed as a Manor (Weresa) in the Domesday survey. An early church is thought to have been destroyed during the English Civil War as it represented a potential fortification; church services were then held in the chapel in the remains of Wressle Castle, until that was destroyed by fire (1796). The parish church of St John of Beverley, now a Grade II listed building, was built in 1799 of brick with stone dressings, as a replacement. Other 18th-century buildings still extant include the Castle Farmhouse (1796) built to house the farmer after the fire in Wressle Castle; and the Long Barn (late 18th century) near to the castle site, Holly Cottage in Wressle village (mid-18th century); all built of brick. Rowland Hall, east of the village was built in the late 18th century in brick with stone dressings and is now Grade II listed. In 1840 the Hull and Selby Railway was opened, passing south of Wressle, with a cast iron bridge over the Derwent; services calling at Wressle are recorded as early as 1843, with a full train service at Wressle station by 1855.See Hull and Selby Railway and Wressle railway station A school with an attached schoolmaster's house was erected in 1854. A windmill was built at Mill Farm, east of the village church in the 19th century, by 1890 it was out of use.Ordnance Survey. 1:2500. 1890 The village has had minimal urban growth in the industrial and modern age.Ordnance Survey. 1:2500. 1890‚Äì1, 1907‚Äì9, 1973 In 1997 planning permission was obtained for a new small street of 5 houses off Main Street, named 'Derwent Court'. =Loftsome= The Loftsome toll swing bridge Loftsome and Loftsome Bridge were small hamlets in the parish of Wressle. The Derwent was once crossed by a ferry at Loftsome. A swing bridge crossing of the Derwent was built at Loftsome in 1804, operated as a toll bridge. There has been an inn at Loftsome Bridge since at least the 1800s. By 1823 the inn was known as the Loftsome Bridge Inn. In the 1870s Loftsome's population was 20. The original Loftsome Bridge remained in use to the early 1930s, at which time a new bridge was built for the Hull-Selby road (part of the A63).Ordnance Survey. 1:2500. 1890‚Äì1, 1907‚Äì9, 1938, 1972 (In the parish of Barmby on the Marsh) In the early 1980s Yorkshire Water constructed a water supply treatment works \\"Loftsome Water Treatment Works\\" approximately southwest of Loftsome on the banks of the Derwent.

History  Atlas Van Lines traces its roots back to 1948 when a group of 33 entrepreneurs formed a cooperative for the interstate transportation of household goods from coast to coast. The group took the name \\"Atlas Van Lines\\" and opened a new headquarters building in Evansville, Indiana. The company changed ownership structure in the 1980s, when stock was offered to the public. After a hostile takeover attempt, in 1988 the company returned to ownership by its agents. Atlas expanded rapidly in the 1990s and established Atlas World Group as the holding company for Atlas Van Lines, Inc. and seven subsidiaries. On April 18, 1996 Atlas announced the purchase of Red Ball Corporation, which at the time was the 13th largest household mover in the United States. This included two subsidiaries: American Red Ball International, an international freight forwarder based in Seattle, Washington and American Red Ball Transit Co. based in Indianapolis, Indiana. Red Ball specialized in the moves of US military personnel. In 2001, Atlas sold American Red Ball Transit, the domestic subsidiary, to its management. In 1997 the company announced the two largest conversions in the history of the van line industry with the joining of Atlantic Relocation Systems (more than 600 vehicles) and Bekins Northwest (more than 250). In 2000, Atlas' parent organization \\"Atlas World Group\\" purchased a controlling interest in Cornerstone Relocation Group, a full service global relocation management company based in Basking Ridge, New Jersey. The purchase of Cornerstone allowed Atlas to offer expanded global relocation services to its corporate transportation clients. Over a two-year period, Atlas US implemented a document management system to better manage their paper-based documents, streamline business processes, and reduce operating costs. In late 2006, Atlas Canada successfully implemented its own imaging project. In 2009, Atlas agents, among the first in the industry, received the ProMover designation, a quality credential from the American Moving & Storage Association.

It is based on the 1928 play of the same name by Wilson Collison, and was adapted for the screen by John Mahin. Red Dust is the second of six movies Gable and Harlow made together. More than 20 years later, Gable starred in a remake, Mogambo (1953), with Ava Gardner starring in a variation on the role Harlow played and Grace Kelly playing a part similar to one portrayed by Astor in Red Dust. The film, set in French Indochina, provides a view into the French colonial rubber business. It includes scenes of rubber trees being tapped for sap, the process of coagulating the rubber with acid, native workers being rousted, gales that can blow the roof off a hut and are difficult to walk in, the spartan living quarters, the supply boat that arrives periodically, a rainy spell that lasts weeks, and tigers prowling the jungle. The film's title is derived from the large quantities of dust stirred up by storms. In 2006, Red Dust was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". Plot Mary Astor and Clark Gable in Red Dust On a rubber plantation in French Indochina during the monsoon season, the plantation's owner/manager Dennis Carson (Gable), a prostitute named Vantine (Harlow), and Barbara Willis (Astor), the wife of engineer Gary Willis (Gene Raymond) are involved in a love triangle. Carson abandons an informal relationship with Vantine to pursue Barbara, but has a change of heart and returns to Vantine. Vantine arrives at the plantation first, on the lam from the authorities in Saigon. She shows an easy comfort in the plantation's harsh environment, wisecracks continually, and begins playfully teasing Carson as soon as she meets him. He resists her charm at first, but soon gives in, and they quickly develop a friendly, casual relationship where they tease each other and pretend to be too tough for affection. They call each other \\"Fred\\" and \\"Lily\\", as though neither can be bothered to remember the other's name. However, Carson loses interest in Vantine when the Willises arrive. Gary Willis is a young, inexperienced engineer, and his wife Barbara a classy, ladylike beauty. Carson is immediately attracted to Barbara, and, after sending Gary on a lengthy surveying trip, he spends the next week seducing Barbara as Vantine watches jealously. He successfully persuades Barbara to leave Gary, but recants after visiting Gary in the swamp and learning how deeply he loves Barbara. Carson has also seen that Barbara is unsuited for the plantation's primitive conditions, as is Gary, and has a painful memory of his own mother's death on the plantation when he was a boy. He decides to send both of them back to more civilized surroundings. At the story's climax, Carson turns Barbara's feelings against him by pretending he never loved her, at which point she shoots him. This provides a cover for Vantine and Carson to save Barbara's marriage and reputation by insisting to Gary that Barbara rejected Carson's advances. The film ends after Carson has sent the Willises away, with Vantine reading bedtime stories to him as he recuperates from the gunshot wound, as he playfully tries to fondle her.

Another provocative scene shows Gable embracing Harlow with his hands just below her bosom. Reception Gable and Harlow in Red Dust Variety gave the film a lukewarm reception, stating: \\"Familiar plot stuff, but done so expertly it almost overcomes the basic script shortcomings and the familiar hot-love-in-the-isolated-tropics theme (from the play by Wilson Collison).\\"Variety magazine, December 31, 1931, edition Unimpressed with Mary Astor's performance, the reviewer wrote: \\"Astor is ok in the passive virtuous moments, but falls down badly on the clinches, sustained only by Gable.\\"Variety review However, they were complimentary towards Gable's performance, and liked Jean Harlow's portrayal of Vantine: \\"She plays the light lady to the limit, however, not overdoing anything.\\" Modern reviewers are more favorably disposed to the movie.

Accolades In 2002, the film was nominated for the American Film Institute's \\"100 Years...100 Passions\\" list. Remake Red Dust was remade by director John Ford in 1953 as Mogambo, this time set in Africa rather than Indochina, and shot on location in color, with Ava Gardner playing Harlow's role and Grace Kelly in Astor's part. Clark Gable returned to play the same character he portrayed twenty-one years earlier. Ford used African tribal music as the film's score.

Morrissette in 1943, and is still led by members of the Morissette family. It is based in Springfield, Virginia and handles storage and shipping for corporate and government clients, including AOL, Hewlett Packard and the US military. It is a subsidiary of Interstate Worldwide, a group company consisting of several other divisions which by 2009 was, amongst other things, responsible for the carriage of US$1 billion of computer equipment annually. Origins Arthur E. Morrissette started the business at a cost of US$450 when he left the Navy Department in 1943. The original name was Ace Van & Storage, based in south-east Washington, D.C.; the present name was used from 1967, when the company also introduced its \\"Top Hat\\" logo. For 29 years he fronted the company's radio and television commercials. He died on 24 April 1996, having resigned from his role in the company in 1993. Subsequent members of the Morrissette family who have been involved with the company include at least two who have been its president, Arthur E. Morrissette Jr. and John D. Morrissette. Size In 1998 the company had been awarded a US$40.7 million contract from Military Traffic Management Command for transport services. As at 2010 the company has a labor turnover figure of around 50%: with a total workforce of over 200, this equates to 100 job vacancies at any time due to workers leaving. Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration data shows that at February 2011 the company had 74 power units and 99 drivers. Previously, in 1999, it had 225 power units, and in 2004 the number had been 126. Recognition Interstate was accredited by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on December 22, 2010 in a deal which involved ICE offering free training. The accreditation recognizes that the company maintains systems to deter the employment of illegal workers. As at December 2010 there were already more than 100 companies accredited under this new scheme, known as IMAGE. Interstate had introduced mandatory urine testing for drugs in 1984. A press release issued by the company in 2009 announced that it was one of the winners of a National Defense Transportation Quality Award and that this was the eighth time it had been so recognised, The award was for implementing systems for dealing with Department of Defense commissions for the relocation of personnel based around Puget Sound, of which around 500 had been dealt with in the year 2008. The company was also awarded the American Moving & Storage Association's first Independent Mover of the Year Award, for 2007. Springfield has been a campaign stop for Republican election candidates. Interstate hosted a rally held by John McCain, Republican presidential nominee and his running mate, Sarah Palin in 2008. In 1996 it had hosted a similar event for GOP presidential nominee Bob Dole.  Court case  In March 2010, a Fairfax, Virginia jury ruled against Interstate Van Lines for wrongful allegations of theft that put a former Interstate driver in jail for 34 days, awarding the ex-employee $50,000 for malicious prosecution, $200,000 for false imprisonment and $340,000 in punitive damages.

Nazi memorabilia includes attachments featuring the Flag of Nazi Germany, items with Nazi symbolism such as SS-Ehrendolch, Nazi medals, and contemporary editions of Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf. During World War II, soldiers from opposing Allied forces often took small items from fallen enemies as war trophies. These and other items from this time period have since been acquired by museums and individual collectors. In recent years the market for buying and selling Nazi memorabilia has increased. As veterans pass away, some families have tried to get rid of their possessions. There are also those who don't want the Nazis to be forgotten thus they are pulling items out of hiding. With the growing demands for Nazi memorabilia, many Jewish groups are disapproving the sale and purchase of Nazi products for leisure purposes. While others such as Haim Gertner, director of Israel's Holocaust memorial, believe that some of the Nazi memorabilia are worth saving, claiming that anti-Semitic history shouldn't be forgotten. Legal restrictions The sale of Nazi memorabilia is strictly prohibited in parts of Europe. In France, the Internet portal site Yahoo! was sued in the case LICRA v. Yahoo! (2000) by the Union of Jewish Students and the International League against Racism and Anti- Semitism for \\"justifying war crimes and crimes against humanity\\" by allowing such memorabilia to be sold via its auction pages. Yahoo!'s response was to ban the sale of Nazi memorabilia through its website. A Paris court cleared Yahoo! in 2003. Fearing similar litigation, auction website eBay enacted new guidelines regarding the sale of Nazi memorabilia in 2003. eBay's policies prohibit items relating to Nazi media propaganda, items made after 1933 that contains a swastika, Nazi reproduction items such as uniforms, and all Holocaust-related products. Memorabilia such as coins, stamps, or printed period literature such as magazines, books, or pamphlets are not prohibited.

It is a contributing property to the Flemington Historic District. It was first constructed by Neal Hart in 1814, it served as a gathering place for well-to-do stagecoach passengers and socialites throughout the 19th Century, as well as many local characters and tourists visiting the area. The exterior of the present building dates to 1878. It gained national notoriety in the early months of 1935 when the trial of Bruno Hauptmann was conducted directly across the street at the Hunterdon County Courthouse and members of the national media covering the trial all stayed at the hotel. Decades later the property was purchased by new owners, renovated, restored, and converted into what is now officially known as the Union Hotel Restaurant. The second and third floors (which once housed hotel patrons) were left empty and unoccupied, adding to the growing mythos surrounding the widely recognized Hunterdon County icon. Murals created by Carl Ritz with the assistance of Kurt Wiese adorn the hotel. 2008 closure In July 2008, managing partner John Blanos announced that the Union Hotel Restaurant would sell its liquor license but remain open. However, in August he announced that the restaurant would close, and that the liquor license would be sold to Bensi, an Italian chain restaurant soon to open elsewhere in Flemington. At a special Flemington Borough Council meeting in September 2008, the transfer of the liquor license was rejected, but Blanos nonetheless stated that the restaurant would close immediately and that he was negotiating with a potential buyer. Blanos said that the Union Hotel had been steadily losing money since he and his partners bought it in 1999. Redevelopment In November 2012, the Flemington Borough Council selected Flemington Union Hotel LLC to revive and restore the once prominent Union Hotel on historic Main Street. Flemington Union Hotel LLC's principals Matt McPherson and Liam Burns envision to revive the Union Hotel as a 50- to 55-room hotel that would expand into the building next door at 78 Main St. The plan calls for adding a ballroom on the back and establishing an elegant steakhouse and a casual pub on the ground floor. A special legislative bill is proposed to allow for a liquor license. In February 2016 it was announced that the Union Hotel would be demolished and replaced with a new building on the site. This caused much controversy in and around Flemington, and despite this controversy, the Flemington council approved the plans. In May 2017, plans to demolish the hotel were scuttled and a new plan to utilize the building was introduced. Legends The belief that the hotel was haunted is quite prevalent, though few members of the public were ever allotted access to levels above the dining hall where a few rooms are used by management for business purposes and ghost sightings or poltergeist incidents have been reported by employees. One reported seeing a pair of shoes walk up a staircase all by themselves. Others have told of hearing or seeing small children in rooms despite the absence of hotel guests. The manager claimed to have felt an unseen presence in her office late one night when she knew she was all alone.

Michael Joseph Hornung was born in Carthage, New York in 1857. Prior to starting his career in Major League Baseball in 1879 with the Buffalo Bisons, Hornung played for the 1877 and 1878 London Tecumsehs in London, Ontario, Canada, winning the International Association title in 1877. Hornung ended his major league baseball career in 1890 with the New York Giants, but he spent most of his career (1881‚Äì1888) with the Boston Red Caps/Beaneaters. He also spent one season (1889) in the now-defunct American Association. After umpiring for a few seasons in the minor leagues he took on the roll of player / manager for the Batavia Giants franchise on May 25, 1897, making his playing debut on June 14th at the age of 40, he went hitless.

He led all National League outfielders in fielding percentage in 1881, 1882, 1883 and 1886, fielding as high as .948, a very high mark for a time in which most players (including Hornung), didn't wear gloves in the field.

History Navelim's church was first built by the Jesuits in the 1590s; the present, Portuguese-style whitewashed structure was constructed later on when the older building became too small. The reconstruction was apparently financed by a local merchant \\"Barreto\\" who was saved from bankruptcy through the intercession of Our Lady of the Rosary. According to legend, this church was built in mud similar to the other churches in Salcete between 1594 and 1598. The builders were Jesuits and it was financed by the villagers. The first parish priest of Navelim Church was a French Jesuit Fr. John Sena. (Mitras Lusitanas no Oriente) As time passed, the church became small for the growing population. Later on, it was reconstructed with laterite stones on a larger scale by a rich Goan merchant, whose name is not given. This merchant, according to legend, while passing through the main road running in front of the above church, received the message that he would lose a substantial amount of money in his business. As soon as he received this message, he entered the church and started praying to Our Lady of Rosary, requesting her to relieve him from this catastrophe. If his prayers were answered, he promised to reconstruct the original church, on a larger scale. In the event he not only recovered what he had lost, but realised double the amount. He then financed the entire reconstruction of the church and also renewed the statue of our Lady of Rosary. Information on further reconstruction of Navelim church, if any, are not known. Celebrations =Navelim feast= The celebration of the feast of Our Lady of Rosary begins every third Wednesday in November. This devotion of Our Lady comprises an extensive celebration which begins with traditional processions and novenas. Each year the family selected to celebrate the feast paints the church on the outside fifteen days before the feast. The inside of the church is also beautifully decorated and the outside is covered with fairy lights. Most of the houses and streets in the village are lit up with colourful lights during the celebrations. Every four years, the statue of Our Lady of Rosary is brought down from the altar and a procession takes Her to Holy Rosary School where mass is held in the playground. During this one day consecration of Our Lady, children from the school act out scenes from the Bible and the playground is filled with crowds of villagers. Every November a candlelight procession carries a statue of Our Lady towards the church; the celebration of the feast continues for several days. =Navelim fair= According to legend, in earliest times, this fair consisted mainly of three or four sheds and lasted only for a day, because there was superstition that on the same night of the feast day, there was a gathering of devils in the area in front of the church. Dr. Francisco Salvador Gomes, father of Dr. Francisco Lu√≠s Gomes, who was the administrator of Salcete, encouraged some of the owners of the sheds to extend the fair to three days. This was done, and fair gained in prominence so that today it is the most popular fair in Goa (Ultramor of 12-11-1869 no. 554 & Ultramor of 10-11-1900 year 42). Today the fair comprises stalls selling toys, food and clothing. There are booths for games as well as a Fun Fair with merry-go-rounds and Ferris wheels as well as other enjoyable rides.  Demographics  Navelim has population of 12 323 of which 6 875 are males while 5 448 are females as per report released by Census India 2011. It was formerly a large village of Salcete and is now one of the most populous towns in South Goa.

Beside's arts and commerce it also offers other courses like BBA (Bachelor of Business Administration), BCA (Bachelor of Computer Applications), M.Com etc. Rosary Higher Secondary, Rosary School and Perpetual Succour Convent are also located in that area.

Due to financial difficulties, the club ceased operation at the end of the 2002 Queensland Cup season, and merged with the Souths Magpies to form a new team, the Souths Logan Magpies. History The Scorpions made their debut in the third grade of the Brisbane Rugby League premiership (BRL) in 1987. After they made the grand final, which they lost to the Redcliffe Dolphins 4‚Äì18, it was decided to fully admit the club into first grade in 1988. However, the Scorpions were never able to become competitive in the higher class of competition owing to financial difficulties not permitting them to recruit the best players available, a problem enhanced by the fact that all of the BRL‚Äôs top talent had defected to the Brisbane Broncos or other Sydney-based NSWRL clubs. The Scorpions never made the semi-finals once in either the BRL First Grade or Queensland Cup; their most successful seasons being 1999 and 2000 when the club finished seventh out of twelve teams. They made the Brisbane A Grade grand final in 2000 but lost 10‚Äì28 to the Easts Tigers. Logan‚Äôs fortunes declined further in 2001 and 2002. In their final year they failed to win a single game in either the Queensland Cup or Brisbane A Grade, and suffered many huge losses, including losing 0‚Äì88 to the Redcliffe Dolphins at Dolphin Oval.

Early life He was born in Camp Le Jeune, North Carolina. His father was Italian and his mother was from New England.\\"As far as my Italian origins I wish no offense but I rarely think about it. I‚Äôm only half: my father was Italian, my mother New England American. I‚Äôm just a guy living in NYC, no more‚Äìno less than that.\\", from tomdicillo.com He studied creative writing at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia and went on to study filmmaking at New York University's Film School alongside Jim Jarmusch, Howard Brookner, Sara Driver and Spike Lee. Subsequently, he worked as an actor, then cinematographer, before making his own films. Career For his first film, Johnny Suede (1991), DiCillo cast the then-unknown Brad Pitt and Catherine Keener in what would be their first starring roles. It received a nomination for a Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival. For his second film, Living in Oblivion, DiCillo received acclaim for his satire of independent film-making. This 1995 black comedy, itself a low-budget independent film, features Steve Buscemi as a director driven to near-madness by his cast and crew, including a vain Hollywood actor. Describing the inspiration for and origin of Living in Oblivion in an interview with Salon, DiCillo described making a movie as \\"one of the most tedious, boring, painful experiences, and that's just when something goes right\\". In 2001, his film Double Whammy was released straight to video. Delirious (2006), a comedy starring Steve Buscemi, Michael Pitt, Alison Lohman and Elvis Costello, was screened at the San Sebastian Film Festival where it won three awards (Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, and the Signis Award for originality). The film also screened at the Sundance Film Festival in 2007 and won Best Director at the HBO Comedy Film Festival in Aspen, Colorado. DiCillo wrote and directed When You're Strange (2009), a documentary about the rock band The Doors, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival and was nominated for a Grand Jury Prize. It was subsequently nominated for both an Emmy Award, after airing on PBS' American Masters series, and a Grammy Award for Best Long Form Video. He has published books of two of his screenplays, Living in Oblivion and Box of Moonlight. Both books contain the full scripts along with commentary, stories and anecdotes. DiCillo also directed \\"Weeping Willow\\", a sixth season episode of the television series Law & Order: Criminal Intent, inspired by the lonelygirl15 videos on YouTube. In the episode, a vlogger named Weeping Willow (Michelle Trachtenberg) is kidnapped during a live Internet video, and the kidnappers demand ransom through additional videos.

Eerdmans Publishing, USA, 1993, page 246-247 She chose Los Angeles as the location of the Temple after receiving a vision of the California dream, \\"a little home in Los Angeles,\\" as she prayed beside her ill daughter, Roberta. When McPherson found the lot near Echo Lake, she paused silently and then said, \\"This is the place God would have us build.\\" McPherson hired Brook Hawkins from Winter Construction Company, the architect of the Culver Hotel, the Grauman's Metropolitan Theatre and the Pasadena Playhouse. The Angelus Temple building, seating 5,300 people, was opened in Echo Park in 1923.George Thomas Kurian, Mark A. Lamport, Encyclopedia of Christianity in the United States, Volume 5, Rowman & Littlefield, USA, 2016, p. 1471 On opening day, McPherson declared, \\"Today is the happiest day of my entire life. I can hardly believe that this great temple has been built for me!\\" She managed to raise $250,000 from wealthy followers to finance the construction. The temple is considered to be the first megachurch built in the United States, and its 125-foot-wide dome was the largest in North America. Attendance in McPherson's day reached as much as 10,000 people.Thomas, Lately Storming Heaven: The Lives and Turmoils of Minnie Kennedy and Aimee Semple McPherson, Ballantine Books, USA, 1970 page 32 According to church records, Angelus Temple received 40 million visitors within the first seven years.Bridal Call (Foursquare Publications, 1100 Glendale Blvd, Los Angeles.) October 1929, p. 27 At first, McPherson preached every service, often in a dramatic scene she put together to attract audiences. In 1972, the temple was renovated with a $500,000 budget. In November 2001, Matthew Barnett became the senior pastor. In 2015, the weekly attendance is 8,975 persons.Hartford Institute, Database of megachurches in the US, Official website, USA, Retrieved September 11, 2016  Social programs  The former Queen of Angels Hospital is the base of operations for the Dream Center, an organization who offers a food bank, clothings and assistance programs for disaster victims, victims of domestic violence, drug addiction and trafficking in human beings and prisoners.

Kurt Streeter, Angelus Temple Will Keep Historic Interior, latimes.com, USA, October 15, 2001  Buildings  Building in Los Angeles Angelus Temple was dedicated on January 1, 1923. The cornerstone of the building bears the inscription \\"Dedicated unto the cause of inter-denominational and worldwide evangelism\\". The temple, located opposite Echo Park Lake, had an original seating capacity of 5,300. In 2002, a renovation left the temple with a capacity of 3,500. According to the United States Department of Labor's Consumer Price Index, Angelus Temple's construction would cost $3,245,964.91 in 2014.Payne, Leah. Gender and Pentecostal Revivalism: Making a Female Ministry in the Early Twentieth Century, Palgrave Macmillan, 2015 Angelus Temple was the largest construction of its time in North America, rising \\"125 feet from the main floor\\". A panorama of clouds, the work of artist Anne Henneke, adorns the ceiling, and the temple has eight stained glass windows depicting the life of Jesus Christ, created by artist George Haskins. The building underwent renovations in 1972, while still retaining its original interior and exterior appearance.http://www.nps.gov/nr/feature/wom/2002/angelas.htm The lighted cross atop the temple's dome is a longstanding landmark. The entire temple was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1992. and The temple was a Class \\"A\\" fireproof building constructed of concrete and steel designed by Brook Hawkins. The structure's main architectural feature is its large, unsupported concrete dome coated with a mixture of ground abalone shells. The dome's interior was painted azure blue, with fleecy clouds, a reminder to \\"work while it's day\\" and \\"to look for His coming\\". McPherson insisted on a bright, joyous setting, avoiding any reminder of sin from either artwork or motto. In back of the pulpit was her theme verse from Hebrews 13:8: \\"Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and today and forever.\\" She later said that she loved \\"every stone in Angelus Temple,...I love to touch its walls, its altar,...I look to its high vaulted dome....\\"Blumhofer, p. 239 but no part of the church pleased her more than the magnificent Kimball pipe organ which always soothed her and brought her peace of mind.Blumhofer, pp. 246‚Äì247 After the temple's dedication in 1923, the 5,300-seat auditorium was filled three times each day, seven days a week. L.I.F.E. Bible College was founded in a building adjacent to Angelus Temple. This building is currently the home of the Angelus Temple Hispanic Church. McPherson lived in the parsonage adjacent to the Temple; it is currently open to visitors.

It offers all-inclusive services for relocations like packing, loading, moving, unloading, unpacking, arranging of items to be shifted. Additional services may include cleaning services for houses, offices or warehousing facilities. Overview According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 40 million United States citizens have moved annually over the last decade. Of those people who have moved in the United States, 84.5% of them have moved within their own state, 12.5% have moved to another state, and 2.3% have moved to another country. In the U.S. and Canada, the cost for long-distance moves is typically determined by the weight of the items to be moved, the distance, how quickly the items are to be moved, and the time of the year or month when the move takes place. In the United Kingdom and Australia, the price is based on the volume of the items rather than their weight. Some movers may offer flat rate pricing. The use of truck rental services, or simply borrowing similar hardware, is referred to as DIY moving. Typically, the parties who are moving borrow or rent a truck or trailer large enough to carry their household goods and, if necessary, obtain moving equipment such as dollies, furniture pads, and cargo belts to protect the furniture or to facilitate the moving process itself. The moving process also involves finding or buying materials such as boxes, paper, tape, and bubble wrap with which to pack boxable and/or protect fragile household goods and to consolidate the carrying and stacking on moving day. Self-service moving companies offer another viable option: the person moving buys space on one or more trailers or shipping containers. These containers are then driven by professionals to the new location.

Dr. Moor-Jankowski was Director of the Laboratory for Experimental Medicine and Surgery in Primates (LEMSIP) which he founded in 1965, the Director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Center for Hematology of Primate Apes, and the editor-in-chief of the Journal of Medical Primatology. Moor-Jankowski was the author and editor of many books, monographs and periodicals, and more than 200 papers on human genetics, hemophilia, blood groups, immunology and primate medical experimentation. Early life Moor-Jankowski was born in Warsaw and grew up in Czƒôstochowa. His father was an engineer and an architect, and his mother a concert pianist. When his mother's cousin developed cancer, at the age of five, Moor-Jankowski decided that he wanted to be a research physician in order to find a cure. When Germany invaded Poland in 1939, Moor-Jankowski joined the Polish Army, at the age of 15, and his family moved back to Warsaw. When Poland was overrun, the family moved back to Czƒôstochowa. With the Polish schools closed by the Nazis, he obtained a high school diploma without official government recognition. When his father disappeared in 1942, Moor-Jankowski joined the Polish Resistance. He would later write that he wanted something of himself to carry on, and so he fathered a son, Tadeusz, who was born in 1942. He saw the child once, when he was two weeks old, but did not see him again for 35 years. Moor-Jankowski was fighting in Warsaw uprising. He was injured by an explosive bullet in his knee, and he was forced to move from hospital to hospital, pretending to be a German officer in order to survive. Eventually, his impersonation was discovered, and he was imprisoned by the Germans, and then later by the Soviets. He finally escaped to Switzerland, where he earned a medical degree. Career Moor-Jankowski eventually moved to the United States, where he worked mainly at a New York University primate lab. It was there that he used chimpanzees for medical research, including work on the discovery of the first Hepatitis B vaccine and the development of techniques to freeze blood for storage. He was elected to the French Academy of Medicine in 1995, replacing Linus Pauling as the only American member. =The Journal of Medical Primatology= Moor-Jankowski founded the Journal of Medical Primatology. The journal published a letter from an animal rights advocate which criticized the Austrian drug company Immuno AG for its plans to capture wild chimpanzees for research. When Immuno AG sued for libel, Moor-Jankowski refused to settle the lawsuit, instead battling for seven years, with two appeals to the New York State Supreme Court and one to the United States Supreme Court. He eventually prevailed in the state courts, in a decision which many hailed as a victory for letters to the editor against libel lawsuits. The litigation, however dragged on for years, while Immuno AG petitioned the court for a rehearing. One of the longest, most bitter and expensive libel suits finally ended when Immuno AG's petition was ultimately denied on June 3, 1991. Recognition Moor-Jankowski was presented with the Trumpeldor medal by the Israeli Prime Minister's Office, Life Sciences Division in 1971, and the G. Bude medal by the College of France in 1979. In 1984, he was awarded the Knight of the French Order Ordre National du M√©rite for resistance activity in World War II and for scientific achievements.

Major multinationals have played and to some extent continue to play a significant role in the politics of global warming, especially in the United States, through lobbying of government and funding of global warming deniers. Business also plays a key role in the mitigation of global warming, through decisions to invest in researching and implementing new energy technologies and energy efficiency measures. (See also individual and political action on climate change.) Overview In 1989 in the US, the petroleum and automotive industries and the National Association of Manufacturers created the Global Climate Coalition (GCC) to oppose mandatory actions to address global warming. In 1997, when the US Senate overwhelmingly passed a resolution against ratifying the Kyoto Protocol, the industry funded a $13 million industry advertising blitz in the run-up to the vote. In 1998 The New York Times published\\"Industrial Group Plans to Battle Climate Treaty\\", The New York Times, March 26, 1998. Accessed 26 June 2018. an American Petroleum Institute (API) memo outlining a strategy aiming to make \\"recognition of uncertainty ... part of the 'conventional wisdom.'\\" Also available here and here The memo has been compared to a late 1960s memo by tobacco company Brown and Williamson, which observed: \\"Doubt is our product since it is the best means of competing with the 'body of fact' that exists in the mind of the general public. It is also the means of establishing a controversy.\\" Those involved in the memo included Jeffrey Salmon, then executive director of the George C. Marshall Institute, Steven Milloy, a prominent denialist commentator, and the Competitive Enterprise Institute's Myron Ebell. In June 2005 a former API lawyer, Philip Cooney, resigned his White House post after accusations of politically motivated tampering with scientific reports. In 2002, in the wake of both declining membership and President Bush's withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol, the GCC announced that it would \\"deactivate\\" itself. Ex-World Bank economist Herman Daly suggests that neoliberalism and globalisation bring about \\"a permanent international standard-lowering competition to attract capital\\". If accurate, this contemporary economic environment therefore also aids businesses who are hostile to action against climate change. They are able to relocate their activities to states which have less climate based regulations. At the same time, since 1989 many previously denialist petroleum and automobile industry corporations have changed their position as the political and scientific consensus has grown, with the creation of the Kyoto Protocol and the publication of the International Panel on Climate Change's Second and Third Assessment Reports. These corporations include major petroleum companies like Royal Dutch Shell, Texaco, and BP, as well as automobile manufacturers like Ford, General Motors, and DaimlerChrysler. Some of these have joined with the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions (formerly the Pew Center on Global Climate Change), a non-profit organization aiming to support efforts to address global climate change.\\"Business Environmental Leadership Council (BELC) Member Companies\\". Since 2000, the Carbon Disclosure Project has been working with major corporations and investors to disclose the emissions of the largest companies. By 2007, the CDP published the emissions data for 2400 of the largest corporations in the world, and represented major institutional investors with $41 trillion combined assets under management.\\"Carbon Disclosure Project: Homepage\\". The pressure from these investors had had some success in working with companies to reduce emissions. The World Business Council for Sustainable Development, a CEO-led association of some 200 multinational companies, has called on governments to agree on a global targets, and suggests that it is necessary to cut emissions by 60-80 percent from current levels by 2050. In 2017, after the election of Donald Trump, backing was shown in the business community for the Paris Agreement, which became effective November 4, 2016. In 2020 the demand for business action to stop climate change grow steadily. An organisation named \\"Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures\\" was created with a specific aim to show which companies are trying to stop climate change and which not. The bank of England launched an initiative for showing what investment can become non profitable with climate action. British Petroleum pledged to become carbon neutral by 2050 and the biggest finance management company BlackRock said it will not serve those who will not try to reduce GGG emissions. Investors with a capital of 5 trillion dollars pledged to have 100% fossil free investments by the year 2050. Global Climate Coalition A central organization in climate denial was the Global Climate Coalition (1989‚Äì2002), a group of mainly United States businesses opposing immediate action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The coalition funded deniers with scientific credentials to be public spokespeople, provided industry a voice on climate change, and fought the Kyoto Protocol. The New York Times reported that \\"even as the coalition worked to sway opinion [towards denial], its own scientific and technical experts were advising that the science backing the role of greenhouse gases in global warming could not be refuted.\\"Revkin, Andrew C. Industry Ignored Its Scientists on Climate, The New York Times. April 23, 2009. In the year 2000, the rate of corporate members leaving accelerated when they became the target of a national divestiture campaign run by John Passacantando and Phil Radford with the organization Ozone Action. According to The New York Times, when Ford Motor Company was the first company to leave the coalition, it was ‚Äúthe latest sign of divisions within heavy industry over how to respond to global warming.‚Äù After that, between December 1999 and early March 2000, the GCC was deserted by Daimler-Chrysler, Texaco, the Southern Company and General Motors. The organization closed in 2002, or in their own words, 'deactivated'.  World Economic Forum  In the beginning of the 21st century the forum begun to increasingly deal with environmental issues. In the Davos Manifesto 2020 it is said that a company among other things: \\"acts as a steward of the environmental and material universe for future generations. It consciously protects our biosphere and champions a circular, shared and regenerative economy.\\" \\"responsibly manages near-term, medium-term and long-term value creation in pursuit of sustainable shareholder returns that do not sacrifice the future for the present.\\" \\"is more than an economic unit generating wealth. It fulfils human and societal aspirations as part of the broader social system. Performance must be measured not only on the return to shareholders, but also on how it achieves its environmental, social and good governance objectives.\\" The forum launched the Environmental Initiative that covers climate change and water issues. Under the Gleneagles Dialogue on Climate Change, the U.K. government asked the World Economic Forum at the G8 Summit in Gleneagles in 2005 to facilitate a dialogue with the business community to develop recommendations for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This set of recommendations, endorsed by a global group of CEOs, was presented to leaders ahead of the G8 Summit in Toyako and Hokkaido held in July 2008.Black, Richard (20 June 2008). \\"Business Chiefs Urge Carbon Curbs\\" BBC News. Retrieved 25 January 2011.Szabo, Michael (19 June 2008). \\"Business Chiefs Call for G8 Climate Leadership\\" Reuters. Retrieved 25 January 2011. In January 2017, WEF launched the Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy (PACE), which is a global public private partnership seeking to scale circular economy innovations. PACE is co-chaired by Frans van Houten (CEO of Philips), Naoko Ishii (CEO of the Global Environment Facility, and the head of UN Environment (UNEP). The Ellen MacArthur Foundation, the International Resource Panel, Circle Economy and Accenture serve as knowledge partners. The Environment and Natural Resource Security Initiative was emphasized for the 2017 meeting to achieve inclusive economic growth and sustainable practices for global industries. With increasing limitations on world trade through national interests and trade barriers, the WEF has moved towards a more sensitive and socially minded approach for global businesses with a focus on the reduction of carbon emissions in China and other large industrial nations.Shaping the Future of Environment and Natural Resource Security The World Economic Forum Davos 2017. Retrieved 16 January 2017. The World Economic Forum is working to eliminate plastic pollution, stating that by the year 2050 it will consume 15% of the global carbon budget and will pass by its weight fishes in the world's oceans. One of the methods is to achieve circular economy. The theme of 2020 World Economic Forum annual meeting was \\"Stakeholders for a Cohesive and Sustainable World\\". Climate change and sustainability were central themes of discussion. Many argued that GDP is failed to represent correctly the wellbeing and that fossil fuel subsydies should be stopped. Many of the participants said that a better capitalism is needed. Al Gore summarized the ideas in the conference as: \\"I don‚Äôt want to be naive, but I want to acknowledge that the center of the global economy is now saying things that many of us have dreamed they might for a long time,\\" and \\"The version of capitalism we have today in our world must be reformed\\". In this meeting the World Economic Forum launched the Trillion Tree Campaign - an initiative aiming to \\"grow, restore and conserve 1 trillion trees around the world - in a bid to restore biodiversity and help fight climate change\\". Donald Trump joined the initiative. The forum stated that: \\"Nature-based solutions ‚Äì locking-up carbon in the world‚Äôs forests, grasslands and wetlands ‚Äì can provide up to one-third of the emissions reductions required by 2030 to meet the Paris Agreement targets,\\" adding that the rest should come from the heavy industry, finance and transportation sectors. One of the targets is to unify existing reforestation projects In 2020, the forum published an article in which it claims that the COVID-19 pandemic is linked to the destruction of nature. The number of emerging diseases is rising and this rise is linked to deforestation and species loss. In the article there are multiple examples of the degradation of ecological systems caused by humans. It is also says that half of the global GDP is moderately or largely dependent on nature. The article concludes that the recovery from the pandemic should be linked to nature recovery. In July 2020 the forum published the \\"Future of Nature and Business Report\\", saying that \\"Prioritizing Nature\\" can give to the global economy 10.1 trillion dollars per year and 395 million jobs by the year 2030. U.S. Climate Action Partnership The U.S. Climate Action Partnership (USCAP) was formed in January 2007 with the primary goal of influencing the regulation of Greenhouse gas emissions by the United States. Original members included General Electric, Alcoa, and Natural Resources Defense Council, and they were joined in April, 2007 by ConocoPhillips and AIG. Energy industry =ExxonMobil= ExxonMobil has been a leading figure in the business world's position on climate change, providing substantial funding to a range of global-warming-denialist organizations. Mother Jones counted some 40 ExxonMobil-funded organization that \\"either have sought to undermine mainstream scientific findings on global climate change or have maintained affiliations with a small group of \\"skeptic\\" (denialist) scientists who continue to do so.\\" Between 2000 and 2003 these organizations received more than $8m in funding. It has also had a key influence in the Bush administration's energy policy, including on the Kyoto Protocol, supported by both $55m spent on lobbying since 1999, and direct contacts between the company and leading politicians. It was a leading member of the Global Climate Coalition. It encouraged (and may have been instrumental in) the replacement in 2002 of the head of the IPCC, Robert Watson. It has also invested $100m into the Global Climate and Energy Project, with Stanford University, and other programs at institutions such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Carnegie Mellon University and the International Energy Agency Greenhouse Gas Research and Development Program. Some of Exxon's activities on climate change produced strong criticism from environmental groups, including reactions such as a leaflet produced by the Stop Esso campaign, saying 'Don't buy E$$o', and featuring a tiger hand setting fire to the Earth. The company's carbon dioxide emissions are more than 50% higher than those of British rival BP, despite the US firm's oil and gas production being only slightly larger. According to a 2004 study commissioned by Friends of the Earth, ExxonMobil and its predecessors caused 4.7 to 5.3 percent of the world's man-made carbon dioxide emissions between 1882 and 2002. The group suggested that such studies could form the basis for eventual legal action. =BP= BP left the Global Climate Coalition in 1997 and said that global warming was a problem that had to be dealt with, although it subsequently joined others in lobbying the Australian government not to sign the Kyoto Protocol unless the US did. In March 2002 BP's chief executive, Lord Browne, declared in a speech that global warming was real and that urgent action was needed, saying that \\"Companies composed of highly skilled and trained people can't live in denial of mounting evidence gathered by hundreds of the most reputable scientists in the world.\\" In 2005 BP was considering testing carbon sequestration in one of its North Sea oil fields, by pumping carbon dioxide into them (and thereby also increasing yields). Throughout 2006 BP, led by their CEO Lord John Browne, has continued to make statements on climate change. It has cut its own operational emissions of CO2 by 10%. It is investing $8 billion in renewable energy over the next 10 years. Most recently it has launched a 'target zero' campaign in the UK to encourage its customers to offset their vehicle emissions when they fill up at the petrol station. BP's American division is a member of the U.S. Climate Action Partnership (USCAP) (see above). BP pledged to become 100% climate neutral by 2050. =Koch Industries= From 2005 to 2008, Koch Industries donated $5.7 million on political campaigns and $37 million on direct lobbying to support fossil fuel industries. Between 1997 and 2008, Koch Industries donated a total of nearly $48 million to climate opposition groups. According to Greenpeace, Koch Industries is the major source of funds of what Greenpeace calls \\"climate denial\\". Koch Industries and its subsidiaries spent more than $20 million on lobbying in 2008 and $12.3 million in 2009, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan research group. =Others= American Electric Power, the world's largest private producer of carbon dioxide, said in 2005 that targets for carbon reduction \\"represent a common-sense approach that can begin the process of lowering emissions along a gradual, cost-effective path.\\" The company complained that \\"uncertainties over the cost of carbon\\" made it very difficult to make decisions about capital investment. DuPont has cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 65% since 1990, saving hundreds of millions of dollars in the process. \\"Give us a date, tell us how much we need to cut, give us the flexibility to meet the goals, and we'll get it done\\", Xcel Energy CEO Wayne Brunetti told Business Week in 2004. Duke Energy, FPL Group, and PG&E; Corporation are members of the U.S. Climate Action Partnership (USCAP) (see above). Transportation A large proportion of carbon dioxide emissions occur because of transportation. Several companies have formed or invested in electric substitutes for standard automobiles. The Tesla Roadster (2008) is an all-electric sports car, and Tesla also produces the Tesla Model S sedan. Vectrix produces and sells an electric scooter rated for 100 km/h (60 mph). There has also been greatly increased interest in personal rapid transit, which applies system engineering principles to reduce energy use, eliminate traffic jams, and produce an acceptable substitute to replace cars, all at the same time. Most systems fully meet Kyoto Treaty carbon emission goals now, 60 years ahead of schedule. Korean steel maker POSCO and its partner Vectus Ltd. have produced a working safety case, including test track and vehicles, that remains fully functional in Swedish winters. Vectus and Suncheon S. Korea signed a memorandum of understanding to install a system. Advanced Transportation Systems' ULTra passed safety certification by the UK Rail Inspectorate in 2003, and won a demonstration project at Heathrow Airport due to be in service in early 2010. ATS Ltd. estimates its ULTra PRT will consume 839 BTU per passenger mile (0.55 MJ per passenger km).The conversion is: 0.55 MJ = 521.6 BTU; 1.609 km = 1 mi; therefore, 521.6 x 1.609 = 839 By comparison, automobiles consume 3,496 BTU, and personal trucks consume 4,329 BTU per passenger mile. 2getthere Inc. sells automated electric freight handling and transit vehicles designed to share existing rights of way with normal traffic. The company recently won the personal rapid transit competition for Masdar.Mogge, John, The Technology of Personal Transit, \\"Figure 6.

JetBlue announced a plan to become carbon neutral on domestic flights in the US through use of carbon offsets, with longterm plans including the possibility of alternative fuels and other technologies. However, the International Air Transport Association reports that such alternative fuels are in short supply as of January 2020. Insurance industry In 2004 Swiss Re, the world's second largest reinsurance company, warned that the economic costs of climate-related disasters threatened to reach $150 billion a year within ten years. In 2006 Lloyd's of London, published a report highlighting the latest science and implications for the insurance industry. Swiss Re, has said that if the shore communities of four Gulf Coast states choose not to implement adaptation strategies, they could see annual climate-change related damages jump 65 percent a year to $23 billion by 2030. \\"Society needs to reduce its vulnerability to climate risks, and as long as they remain manageable, they remain insurable, which is our interest as well,\\" said Mark D. Way, head of Swiss Re's sustainable development for the Americas.US Gulf Coast could face average annual losses of up to US$23 billion by 2030 and cumulative economic damages of $350 billion from climate risks, says Swiss Re research ; 20 October 2010A City Prepares for a Warm Long-Term Forecast in The New York Times May 2011 AIG is a member of the U.S. Climate Action Partnership (USCAP) (see above). Zurich Insurance Group, according to Ben Harper, the head of the sustainability unit in the North American section of the company, has a program for reducing its carbon footprint: make the facilities 100% renewables in a few years, reduce the use of paper by 80%, stop using single-use plastic, invest $4.6 billion in green and social projects. The company already has many green products and services and want to make more. The work on the implementation was not stopped at the time of Coronavirus disease 2019 and the pandemic may result even in higher ecological consciousness, among other it increase demand for ecological products, walking, biking, simple living. The company was the leading insurer of the Trans Mountain pipeline, but stopped supporting it, in July 2020. Media In the UK, some newspapers (Daily Mail, Daily Telegraph) are significantly anti-science, while most others (with varying enthusiasm, The Independent giving it most prominence) support action on global warming. Overall, British newspapers have given the issue three times more coverage than US newspapers. In 2006 (British Sky Broadcasting (Sky) became the world's first media company to go 'climate neutral' by purchasing enough carbon offsets. The CEO of the company James Murdoch (son of Rupert Murdoch and heir apparent for the News International empire) is a strong advocate of action on climate change and is thought to be influential on the issue within the wider group of companies. In June 2006, to much industry interest, Rupert Murdoch invited Al Gore to make his climate change presentation at the annual News Corp (including the Fox Network) gathering at the Pebble Beach golf resort, (USA). In August 2007, Rupert Murdoch announced plans for News Corp. to be carbon neutral by 2010.  Finance management  = Black Rock = In January 2020 BlackRock, the largest finance management company in the world, announced that it would begin divestment from thermal coal and take another measures to make its assets more sustainable. Other companies that made similar statements include \\"Goldman Sachs, Liberty Mutual,... the Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.,... and the European Investment Bank‚Äîthe largest international public bank in the world \\" = JP Morgan = The company is the biggest investor in fossil fuels in the world, therefore many try to persuade it to take climate action. In 2017 the company committed to giving 200 billion dollars to clean finance by 2025 and take 100% of its energy from renewables by the end of 2020. It expects to reach both targets. In 2020 the company pledged to give 200 billion to support climate action and reaching Sustainable Development Goals in the year 2020, expand the restriction on investment in coal and stop investment in arctic oil and gas drilling, create a more sustainable investment portfolio, join the climate action 100+ coalition. It did not pledge to stop investments in tar sands, fracking and other fossil fuels. In October 2020 JPMorgan Chase declared that it begun to work on achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. = HSBC = In October 2020, HSBC, the biggest bank in Europe committed to achieve zero emission by 2050, e.g., by this year it would not only become carbon neutral by itself but also will work only with carbon neutral clients. It also committed to provide 750 - 1,000 billion dollar to help clients make the transition. It also pledged to achieve carbon neutrality in his own operations by 2030 More on business action Businesses take action on climate change for several reasons. Action improves corporate image and better aligns corporate actions with the environmental interests of owners, employees, suppliers, and customers. Action also occurs to reduce costs, increase return on investments, and to reduce dependency on uncontrollable costs. =Increased energy efficiency= For many companies, looking at more efficient energy use can pay off in the medium to long term; unfortunately, shareholders need to be satisfied in the short term, so regulatory intervention is often required, to encourage prudent conservation measures. However, as carbon intensity starts to show up on balance books through organizations such as the Carbon Disclosure Project, voluntary action is starting to take place. Recently there has been a spate of companies acting to improve their energy efficiency. Possibly the most prominent of these companies is Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart, the largest retailer in the US, has announced specific environmental goals to reduce energy use in its stores and pressure its 60,000 suppliers in its worldwide supply chain to follow its lead. On energy efficiency, Wal-Mart wants to increase the fuel efficiency of its truck fleet by 25% over the next three years and double it within ten years, moving from 6.5 mpg. This seems an attainable goal, and by 2020, it is expected to save the company $494 million a year. The company also wants to build a store that is at least 25% more energy efficient within four years. =Use of renewable energies= In August 2002, the largest gathering of ministers in the history of the world met at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg. The global environmental community discussed the role of renewables and energy efficiency in lowering carbon emissions, mitigating poverty reduction (energy access) and improving energy security. One result from WSSD was the formation of to carry forward the international dialogue on sustainable energy and its role in the energy mix. Partnerships formed include the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Partnership, the Global Village Energy Partnership, the Johannesburg Renewable Energy Coalition (JREC), and the Global Network on Energy for Sustainable Development. Renewable energies and renewable energy technologies have many advantages over their fossil fuel counterparts. These advantages include the absence of local pollution such as particulates, sulphur oxides (SOX's) and nitrous oxides (NOX's). For the business community, the economic advantages are also becoming clearer. Numerous studies have shown that the working environment has a significant effect on workforce morale. Renewable energy solutions are a part of this, wind turbines in particular being seen by many as a potent symbol of a new modernity, where environmental considerations are taken seriously. A workforce seeing a forward-looking and responsible company is more likely to feel good about working for such a company. A happier workforce is a more productive workforce. More directly, the high petroleum (oil) and gas prices of 2005 have only added to the attraction of renewable energy sources. Although most renewable energies are more expensive at current fuel prices, the difference is narrowing, and uncertainty in oil and gas markets is a factor worth considering for highly energy-intensive businesses. Another factor affecting the uptake of renewable energies in Europe is the EU Energy Trading Scheme (ETS or EUTS). Many large businesses are fined for increases in emissions, but can sell any \\"excess\\" reductions they make. Companies with high-profile renewable energy portfolios include an aluminium smelter (Alcan), a cement company (Lafarge), and a microchip manufacturer (Intel). Many examples of corporate leadership in this area can be found on the website of The Climate Group, an independent organization set up for promoting such action by business and government. =Carbon offsets= The principle of carbon offset is fairly simple: a business decides that it doesn't want to contribute further to global warming, and it has already made efforts to reduce its carbon (dioxide) emissions, so it decides to pay someone else to further reduce its net emissions by planting trees or by taking up low-carbon technologies. Every unit of carbon that is absorbed by trees‚Äîor not emitted due to funding of renewable energy deployment‚Äîoffsets the emissions from fossil fuel use. In many cases, funding of renewable energy, energy efficiency, or tree planting‚Äîparticularly in developing nations‚Äîcan be a relatively cheap way of making an event, project, or business \\"carbon neutral\\". Many carbon offset providers‚Äîsome as inexpensive as $0.10 per ton of carbon dioxide‚Äîare referenced in the carbon offset article of this encyclopedia. Many businesses are now looking to carbon offset all their work. An example of a business going carbon neutral is FIFA: their 2006 World Cup Final will be carbon neutral. FIFA estimate they are offsetting one hundred thousand tons of carbon dioxide created by the event, largely as a result of people travelling there. Other carbon neutral companies include the bank HSBC, the consumer staples manufacturer Annie's Homegrown, world leading society publisher Blackwell Publishing, and the publishing house New Society Publishers. The Guardian also offsets its carbon emissions resulting from international air travel. Many companies are trying to achieve carbon offsets by Nature-based solutions like reforestation, including mangrove forests and soil restoration. Among them Microsoft, Eni. Increasing the forest cover of Earth by 25% will offset the human emissions in the latest 20 years. In any case it will be necessary to pull from the atmosphere the CO2 that already have been emitted. However, it can work only if the companies will stop to pump new emissions to the atmosphere and stop deforestation.

The optimal material for batting cages is netting, and they are typically rectangular in shape. Chain-link fence is not required but can be useful to enclose the netting to prevent vandalism. However, this material is not suitable for the primary impact layer because it will warp the fencing and damage balls. The ideal netting for a batting cage is either diamond- or square-shaped. Both types of netting have their advantages and disadvantages. Usage A batter stands at one end of the cage, with a pitching machine (or, less often, a human pitcher) at the opposing end. The pitcher or pitching machine pitches baseballs to the batter, who hits them. It is recommended to use a protective pitcher's L-screen to prevent batted balls from striking the pitcher or machine. The cage is used to keep the loose baseballs within a certain range so that they're easy to pick up and are not lost. Batting cages are found both indoors and outdoors. The interior floor of a batting cage may be sloped, to automatically feed the baseballs back into the automatic pitching machine. The automatic pitching machines using sloped floors usually pitch out a synthetic baseball or softball, rather than an official solid core leather hardball. Commercial batting cages pitch with several different speeds, which can range from (for softball) to per hour. Cricket nets and tunnels, used by cricket batsmen are similar in purpose, but bowling machines are much less common than facing a live bowler (this reflects the fact that nearly half of the members of a cricket team are specialist bowlers, and therefore proportionately more bowling practice is needed in cricket than pitching practice in baseball). Netting can greatly vary in quality and durability. #21 Gauge is suitable for little-league players, #36 Gauge is suitable for High-School players, and #60 is recommended for Commercial facilities and Pro Players. Resources such as this Netting Infographic Guide are helpful for identifying the best netting for an application. Types =Indoor= Indoor batting cages are typically suspended by steel cable lines, 1 line every 6‚Äì8 feet. The anchor points being the most important component, typically connected using a steel plate to the wall. Without strong anchors, the netting will sag. =Outdoor= Outdoor batting cages are typically installed using steel pole sections (2 uprights and 1 cross-bar per section), spaced every 12‚Äì20 feet. The greater the span between supports, the more sag in the netting and less usable the cage becomes.

Life Senkovsky was born into an old family of Polish szlachta. During his study in the University of Vilno he became fascinated with all things oriental. Having mastered the Arabic, Persian, Turkish, and Hebrew languages, he was assigned to the Russian mission in Constantinople, which occupation gave him ample opportunities to travel in Syria, Nubia, and Egypt. In 1821 he returned to the Russian capital, where he got the chair in oriental languages at the University of St Petersburg. In the 1820s, Senkovsky started publishing in the popular periodicals of Kondraty Ryleyev and Faddei Bulgarin. He is best remembered for having edited the first Russian \\"thick journal,\\" Library for Reading (1833-1856), whose lively and humorous style (as Nikolai Gogol put it) attracted to literary journals even those people who had never held a book in their hands. Senkovsky encouraged new writers. He had a strong influence on Yelena Hahn and on Elizaveta Akhmatova. In the latter case he not only developed a writer but she regarded him as a parent, Akhmatova would eventually publish her own magazines and in time her own memoir of Senkowsky. A very prolific writer, Senkovsky contributed articles on a wide range of topics, from mathematics to medicine. Under the pen-name of Baron Brambeus he published a series of fantastic voyages, including one to the center of the Earth (The Sentimental Journey to Mount Etna) and another to an antediluvian Egyptian civilization flourishing on the now-frozen Siberian plain (The Scientific Journey to Bear Island). As a literary critic he had few principles, his motto being \\"easy reading and less thought\\". One day he would pronounce his friend Nestor Kukolnik to be Gogol's superior, only to place Gogol higher than Homer the very next day. He dismissed The Tale of Igor's Campaign as a clumsy fake, derogated Pushkin as a second-hand imitator, and declared the Tale of Bygone Years to be written in Polish. During his last years, Senkovsky turned from literature to music. He claimed to have invented a five-stringed violin and a new type of oven. He also published pioneering studies of Chinese, Mongolian, and Tibetan languages.

Since its January 2005 premiere at the Sundance Film Festival, this innovative feature film played a pivotal role in renewing debate about the need for a suicide barrier on The Golden Gate Bridge as well as garnering praise and earning awards for its unique filmmaking style. The film combines 16mm landscape cinematography with a lyrical voiceover (performed by LA-based artist/actor Harriet ‚ÄúHarry‚Äù Dodge) to share two San Francisco stories: the history of the Golden Gate Bridge as a suicide landmark, and the story of a butch dyke in San Francisco searching for love and self-discovery. The two stories are punctuated by Lawrence Ferlinghetti's reading of his ode to San Francisco, \\"The Changing Light\\" and bookended by opening and closing credits music from legendary 1950s icon (and probable Golden Gate suicide) Weldon Kees. The film is dedicated to the memory of Mark Finch who committed suicide by jumping from the Bridge in January 1995. Reception and aftermath The film was awarded several prizes including: the 2005 Marlon Riggs Award (for courage & vision in Bay Area filmmaking) by the San Francisco Film Critics Circle; the 2005 Outstanding Artistic Achievement Award by Outfest, the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Film Festival and the 2005 Best US Narrative Screenplay Award from The New Festival, New York Lesbian and Gay Film Festival. January 14, 2005 the San Francisco Chronicle published an op-ed by writer-director Jenni Olson (an excerpt from the script of the film) calling for a suicide barrier on the Golden Gate Bridge. The following week (on January 19) the Chronicle broke the news that filmmaker Eric Steel had been shooting suicide leaps from the bridge during the calendar year of 2004 for his film The Bridge, which would be released in 2006.

Early career The Vibrators were founded by Ian 'Knox' Carnochan, bassist Pat Collier, guitarist John Ellis, and drummer John 'Eddie' Edwards. They first came to public notice at the 100 Club when they backed Chris Spedding in 1976. On Spedding's recommendation, Mickie Most signed them to his label RAK Records. Most produced their first single, \\"We Vibrate\\". The band also backed Spedding on his single, \\"Pogo Dancing\\". The Vibrators recorded sessions for John Peel at BBC Radio 1 in October 1976, June 1977, and February 1978. They were one of the pioneering punk bands that played at London's Roxy Club. They headlined in January 1977, supported by the Drones, and in February they played twice at the venue. In March 1977, the band supported Iggy Pop on his British tour. Later that year, they backed ex-Mott the Hoople frontman Ian Hunter. Epic Records The band signed to Epic Records in early 1977. Their debut album, Pure Mania was co- produced with Robin Mayhew, the sound engineer for David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust live shows, and reached the top 50 of the UK Albums Chart. The album is well regarded by some music critics and, 17 years after its release, The Guinness Encyclopedia of Popular Music named Pure Mania one of the 50 best punk albums of all time. Their follow-up album, V2, narrowly missed the UK top 30. The only single to be taken from that album, \\"Automatic Lover\\", was the only Vibrators‚Äô single to reach the UK top 40 where it reached No. 35. It earned the band a TV appearance on the prime-time TV show Top of the Pops. The Vibrators‚Äô final single on Epic, \\"Judy Says (Knock You in the Head)\\", was released in June 1978. It reached No. 70 on the UK Singles Chart. Years later it was included in Mojo magazine's list of the best punk rock singles of all time. Later years A lack of further chart activity, and with only one UK top 40 single to their credit, saw the Vibrators join the list of one-hit wonders; a list that includes other UK punk and new wave acts such as the Banned, the Flying Lizards, Jilted John, 999, the Radio Stars, and the Rich Kids. During the 1980s, John Ellis recorded with Peter Gabriel, as well as recording and touring frequently with Peter Hammill, then subsequently the Stranglers, eventually joining the latter full-time in the 1990s. Pat Collier went on to work closely with the Soft Boys, producing their seminal album Underwater Moonlight, and Robyn Hitchcock, producing and mixing some of his solo albums (to which Knox also sometimes contributed). Phil Ram went on to form Able Ram and brought out two singles, \\"Disco in Moscow\\" and \\"Hope We Make It\\", although without any chart success. Despite numerous line-up changes, the Vibrators are still touring to this day as a three-piece, with \\"Eddie\\" being the only original member. Influence The band Stiff Little Fingers took its name from the Vibrators' song of the same title. The song was penned by John Ellis, and appeared on the Vibrators' debut album Pure Mania. Second wave punk band the Exploited covered the Vibrators' song \\"Troops of Tomorrow\\" and used it as the title track for their 1982 album. A cover of \\"Troops of Tomorrow\\" was also recorded by the Polish death metal band Vader, and released as a bonus track on the band's 2011 album, Welcome to the Morbid Reich.

Faraj ben SƒÅlim (), also known as Farragut of Girgenti, Moses Farachi of Dirgent,\\"Dirgent\\" is probably a corruption of the ancient Arabic names (Karkint and Gergent) for Agrigento. Ferragius, Farragus, or Franchinus or Ferrauto, was a Sicilian-Jewish physician and translator who flourished in the second half of the thirteenth century. He was engaged by Charles I of Naples as translator of medical works from Arabic into Latin. In this capacity he rendered a great service to medicine by making in 1279 a Latin translation of al-Razi's medical encyclopedia, Al-Hawi (later printed in 1486, under the title Continens, with a glossary by the translator). The translation is followed, between the same covers, by De expositionibus vocabulorum seu synonimorum simplicis medicin√¶, which Steinschneider supposes to form a part of the Continens. As a token of his esteem for the translator, Charles of Anjou ordered that on the original copy of the manuscript of the Continens (MS. Biblioth√®que Nationale, Paris, No. 6912) the portrait of Faraj should be drawn beside his own by friar Giovanni of Monte Cassino, the greatest illuminator of his time.

It is the official residence of the Governor of Queensland, the representative of the Australian monarch in Queensland. It was originally designed by Benjamin Backhouse and built 1865, but has been subsequently extended and refurbished. It is also known as Fernberg. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992. The Premier of Queensland must visit the Governor at Government House to request the dissolution of the Queensland Legislative Assembly and the calling of a general election. Following the outcome of such elections, the Governor appoints the Premier and Ministry and the swearing-in of Members of the Legislative Assembly which also takes place at Government House. Government House is open to the general public on certain open days, usually on Australia Day, 26 January and Queensland Day, 6 June. History The land on which the Government House stands was originally granted as two separate portions. Portion 223 was bought in May 1860 by Johann Christian Heussler, who also purchased the adjoining portion 291 two years later in partnership with George Reinhard Francksen. In 1864 Francksen died and the land passed to Heussler. At that time the landscape in this outlying suburb of Brisbane may have been close to undeveloped natural bushland. The Hon Johann (John) Christian Heussler, 1820-1907, was a native of Germany who emigrated to Victoria, Australia in 1852. Due to poor health he moved to Brisbane 1854 and established the mercantile firm Heussler and Co. Over two decades Heussler became a highly respected business man and citizen of Queensland. He was recognised as a founding member of the Queensland Club, Consul for the Netherlands, German Consul, and Emigration Agent for German shipping companies. In 1866 he was appointed to the Queensland Legislative Council. Perspective drawing of Villa Fernberg by Benjamin Backhouse, circa 1864 Heussler commissioned Brisbane architect Benjamin Backhouse to design a residence for Heussler, which was constructed in 1865. Heussler named his home Fernberg, giving it a name of German origin that meant \\"distant mountain\\". Benjamin Backhouse was an architect responsible for several substantial commissions in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria. Local examples of his work include other villa residences such as Baroona, Cintra House, Riversleigh and Old Bishopsbourne. Due to financial difficulties, Heussler was forced to leave the property by 1871 after which it was leased to Arthur Palmer, then the Premier of Queensland. In November 1877, the estate was advertised for sale; the house and grounds were described as being: > \\"The house is built of brick and stone, being four stories high, having > below kitchen and servants' room; on the ground floor spacious drawing, > dining, and breakfast rooms; on the first floor three large bedrooms, and > one large room on the second floor. The roof is covered with slates, the > verandahs and balconies being spacious, and presenting a delightful retreat > for the enjoyment of pure air, shade, and widespread and charming view. The > whole of the internal and external workmanship and materials are of the very > best description, and the out-offices are replete with every necessary. The > stable contains a great many stalls. There is also carriage-house, > storeroom, groom's room, harness-room, &c;, &c.;\\" > \\"The grounds are all enclosed, the timber having been thinned so as to give > the place a park-like appearance, and there is a shrubbery and garden round > the house. The Enoggera water pipes run through the property so that there > is an abundant supply of water in all seasons. The view from Fernberg is > something out of the common, both for extent, variety, and beauty; and one > of the best proofs that can be adduced in favor of this assertion is the > fact that, go where you will the house is seen towering aloft above every > tenement in the neighborhood.\\" The property was transferred to George and Nathan Cohen in 1878, neither of whom resided in the house.Ground Floor Plan, c 1884 First Floor Plan, c 1884 Basement plan, circa 1884 John Stevenson, a successful pastoralist, stock and station agent and a Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly, bought Fernberg in the mid 1880s and commissioned architect, Richard Gailey in 1888 to design extensive additions and alterations to the house. The scheme was a major undertaking which more than doubled the size of the original house, and altered the building from an 1860s villa to an Italianate Mansion. The new section had stuccoed detailing, faceted bays and the main entrance was orientated northwards and marked by a tower. These additions made the residence very close to the road; however following the \\"straightening\\" of Fernberg Road, the original road became the driveway. The road was transformed into a winding avenue that led to both the front and side entrances. In 1890 a fountain, gates and gate pillars were erected in the grounds that were well established with trees and shrubs. Various other outbuildings and structures were also developed on the property and included: a coach house, five stall stable, harness room, tool room, man's room, laundry, gymnasium, aviary, fowl house, closets, bush house, glass house and asphalt tennis court. The 1890s economic depression brought an end to Stevenson's fortune and by 1895 the property was mortgaged to William Pattison and Walter Russell Hall. Two years later Hall, a well-known philanthropist who had made his fortune from gold at Mount Morgan, took possession of the residence; however, he chose never to live at the property. View of Government House along main drive, 1950 The decision to lease Fernberg as a temporary Vice-regal residence was made in February 1910 following the formal dedication on 10 December 1909 of the original Government House as Queensland's first university, the University of Queensland. At the same time, plans for a new Government House to be erected at Victoria Park were being prepared; however work on the new House never progressed beyond the construction of footings. In June 1911, despite reports that Fernberg was too small, the government purchased Fernberg as a permanent government house. Alterations and renovations carried out immediately included painting, new floor coverings, the installation of electric light, metalling, gravelling, and rolling of roadways and fencing. Several buildings from the former Government House site were moved to Fernberg in 1910-11 to provide accommodation for offices, a billiard room and apartments for the private secretary and aide-de-camp. A lodge and servants' quarters were also relocated to the site. A chauffeur's cottage was built in 1923, and a commodious timber garage erected in 1935. Formal gardens were initially developed in 1910, primarily for the purpose of providing functional spaces for Vice-Regal garden parties and fund-raising events. Generally the selection of plant material in these garden areas was exotic, mostly ornamental and some native trees. Surrounding the gardens was the original bushland that covered about 70% of the entire grounds. In comparison to the formal gardens, the bushland received very little attention except for the successive clearing of the understorey plants and later of sapling and shrub regrowth. In 1928 \\"woodland walks\\" were created by Governor Sir John and Lady Goodwin through the bushland behind Government House. Paths were created, foot bridges constructed and various plants introduced, such as jacarandas, wattles and poinsettias. In September 1936, suggestions to relocate the Governor back to the original residence were raised by the then Governor, Sir Leslie Wilson. Despite serious consideration, the Premier and Cabinet rejected the idea and instead proposed substantial additions to Fernberg, thus settling the issue of a permanent Government House. Governor and Lady Wilson were both intimately involved in the plans for additions that were designed by the Department of Public Works. The extent of the 1937 additions included construction of a new eastern wing that contained a large reception room, billiards and supper room and a new bedroom with ensuite. To give coherency to the entire building, the entire exterior of Fernberg was painted cream. New maids' quarters and a laundry were built separate to the main house. Sir John and Lady Lavarack walking along the drive of Fernberg with their scotty dog, Monty, 1947 Minor internal alterations were carried out on Fernberg in the mid 1940s after a change of Governor and in anticipation of visits by various members of the Royal Family (Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester having been appointed as Governor-General of Australia in January 1945). Pressure for additional accommodation for the Governor's private staff in the late 1940s resulted in the construction of a single storied brick Auxiliary Building. This building replaced the earlier timber building that had been relocated onto the site in 1910 and was subsequently moved to another site in Bardon. In 1950 a brick administration building and a new coverway with port cochere were erected. The entire complex was painted white at this time. In 1953 a balcony with a concrete staircase leading to the ground level was constructed, opening off the reception room. Doors and windows in the billiards rooms were altered so that they opened out onto a terrace beneath the balcony. Additional residences for staff accommodation were introduced in 1959, 1984 and 1986. A tennis court and swimming pool were built in 1959-1960. Air conditioning services were first introduced in 1957 and were extended in 1978. Refurbishment of the original section of Fernberg, referred to as the guest wing, was carried out in 1981-82. A new guard house was constructed in 1987 and substantial internal works involving the refurbishment of the reception areas were also carried out in the same year. The main house underwent major external refurbishment and painting again in 1992. Late in 1992 one hectare of Government House grounds was taken over by the Department of Transport as part of the widening of Kaye Street. The result of these works is the construction of substantial retaining walls along the western perimeter of the property. = The Governors = In the period 1910-37, when Fernberg was considered a temporary Government House, it served as the home for five Governors: * 1909-1914 Sir William MacGregor, Scottish born governor who signed the University Act providing the newly inaugurated University of Queensland with a home at Old Government House. He reputedly chose Fernberg because of the grounds in which it stood. * 1915-1920 Sir Hamilton John Goold-Adams, Irish born governor who played a prominent role in Queensland's politics during his appointment. * 1920-1925 Sir Matthew Nathan * 1927-1932 Sir Thomas Herbert John Chapman Goodwin * 1932-1946 Sir Leslie Orme Wilson, Queensland's longest serving governor who prompted major additions to Fernberg. Following the declaration of Fernberg as the permanent Government House, the following Governors have resided at the property: * 1946-1957 Sir John Lavarack, first Australian born governor * 1958-1966 Sir Henry Abel Smith, Queensland's last English born governor * 1966-1972 Sir Alan Mansfield * 1972-1977 Sir Colin Hannah * 1977-1985 Sir James Ramsay * 1985-1992 Sir Walter Campbell * 1992-1997 Her Excellency Mrs Leneen Forde, first female governor * 1997-2003 Major General Peter Arnison * 2003-2008 Dame Quentin Bryce, later Australia's first female Governor-General * 2008-2014 Penelope Wensley * 2014- Paul de Jersey  Description  Ground floor plan, circa 1940 First floor plan, circa 1940 Fernberg is situated on a rise that is approximately above sea level overlooking the Brisbane CBD in the south-east and Mount Coot-tha to the west. The of grounds comprise formal, ornamental gardens around the main house, ancillary administration, staff and maintenance buildings, the whole of which is surrounded by native bushland. The site is bounded by Fernberg Road, Kaye Street, Baroona Road and Murruba Street. = The Main House = Government House is basically a two storied building with a basement level. Stylistically the building demonstrates Victorian Italianate characteristics such as asymmetrical massing, a prominent tower employing classical motifs, a balustraded roof parapet, bracketed eaves, segmental arch openings and a stucco wall finish. The earliest section of the house is the 1860s wing which is located at the southernmost part of the house. The formal entry to the house is via the 1880s section of the house and the 1937 addition form the eastern wing of the house. Reception Room, 1950 Reception Room, 2019 Internally the main focus of the building is its large central foyer that has a large fireplace, timber panelled dados and an intricately carved timber staircase, over shadowed by a large stained glass window depicting a life size Robert the Bruce. The principal rooms located at ground level are the formal reception and dining rooms, and the governor's study. Each of the rooms is substantially intact; however, their decorative schemes have been subject to several refurbishments. Original furniture from the Old Government House still remains in these rooms. At the upper level are the private bedrooms of the governor and several guest bedrooms that are located in the southern (earliest) wing of the house. These guest rooms were subject to major renovations in 1981-1982 and currently are furnished to reflect Australian interiors prior to 1900. Billiard room, 1950 The principal rooms in the basement level of the house are the investiture room, billiard room, private dining room and the kitchen. The interiors of these areas have been greatly altered and some alterations to the original layout have occurred. Original joinery, partitions, openings and fittings remain extensively through the entire house. = The Grounds = Government House from Fernberg Road Grounds of Government House, 1928 The Government House grounds consist mainly of two different types of gardens; formal and natural bushland. The formal gardens comprise about 25% of the property with the rest being bushland. The formal gardens include the developed garden areas as well as the drives, paths, retaining walls and steps. Generally, the selection of plant material in this section is exotic and decorative, with some old remnant native trees. There is extensive use of mown grass surfacing in these areas. The bushland areas are characterised by the presence of remnant eucalypt forest and the lack of extensive built development. Several paths meander through the area. Several gullies feed into a slightly larger stream in the bottom south-eastern corner.Staircase with stained glass window depicting Robert the Bruce, 1950 = The Ancillary Buildings = Entrance gates, 2005 The lodge (built before1910, relocated to this site from Old Government House) is a timber building located next to the vice-regal entrance gates. The building, which has two projecting gables, has been extensively altered over a long period of time. The chauffeur's residence (built 1923) is a spacious timber house with a gabled roof. The building has a verandah attached to two sides and has a faceted bay at the front. The garages (built 1935) are a timber structure with a galvanised iron roof crown with a fleche and weathervane. The garage contains space for seven cars in three separate rooms, and several other small rooms. The staff accommodation (built 1937) is a two storied brick and concrete building located south-west of the main house. The building is substantially intact despite several refurbishments. The administration cottage (built 1948) is a single storied brick building containing several offices, bedrooms and sitting room for the aide-de-camp, the personal assistant to the governor and some guest accommodation. The gardener's residence (built 1959) is a standard public service D Type residence. The butler's and the chef's residences (built 1984 and 1986) are recent constructions as are the two staff garages located nearby.  Heritage listing  Government House was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Government House, Brisbane, demonstrates the evolution of the government in Queensland, and is particularly important as the official residence of the Queensland Governor since 1911, and the place for many vice regal functions including Royal visits. It is the Queensland's symbol of British colonisation of Australia. The creation of an animal \\"Sanctuary\\" and the \\"Woodland Walks\\" by Sir John and Lady Goodwin contribute to the early appreciation of native flora and fauna in Queensland. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The main house, built in 1865 and originally known as Fernberg, is the only remaining substantial residence and villa estate, of almost original proportions, in Brisbane from the 1860s. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The residence, as a result of extensive additions in the 1880s, is regarded among the finest examples of a Victorian Italianate villa in Brisbane. Other buildings built in the grounds following the conversion of the house into a vice regal residence contribute to the understanding of the Governor's role and the complex of necessary auxiliary services. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Government House is important for its strong aesthetic qualities that symbolise the wealth and influence of its residents. The residence's setting, situated on a wooded hilltop position with a tower, has been a significant landmark since its construction. The layout of the grounds, particularly the formal gardens and the surrounding bushland contribute significantly to the intrinsic character of the property. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. Government House, Bardon has had important associations with the governors of Queensland since 1911. The house and grounds contain evidence of the contribution of each of the vice regal couples and also records the changes that were made for Royal Tours. The residence is important for its association with several prominent architects who have contributed to the evolution of Government House; Benjamin Backhouse (1865), Richard Gailey (1880s) and the Department of Public Works (1937). The house also has important associations with several early successful settlers in Brisbane. Among these were John Heussler, who built the house in 1865 and was prominent both in business and public life in Queensland and John Stevenson, a pastoralist, stock and station agent and member of the Legislative Assembly, who epitomised the success of the 1880s boom time by changing an 1860s villa to an Italianate Mansion.

The area derives its name from a local Indian tribe, the Machipungo, a branch of the Chesapeake tribe. It was named for a local Indian chief, Machiopungo. Because the community is located in an independent city, there is no individual census for the neighborhood, which was originally part of Princess Anne County until 1963, when the entire county became part of Virginia Beach. Like much of southern Virginia Beach, the area is surrounded by farmland. Pungo is known for its Pungo Strawberry Festival, which is held there every spring, and the Military Aviation Museum, which has a large collection of vintage warbirds. Also well known is the story of Grace Sherwood, the so-called \\"Witch of Pungo\\". Notable features of the area include the historic downtown intersection, United States Coast Guard communications master station, Verizon Communications transmitter site adjacent to the Coast Guard site, cut-your-own Christmas tree farms, pick-your-own fruit farms, roadside fruit and vegetable stands, Pungo Pizza & Ice Cream, a locally owned restaurant with a large game room that has become quite popular, and the Pungo Ferry Bridge. Nearby is Nimmo United Methodist Church (pronounced Nim-o), which was built in 1791 and expanded in the early 1990s; it is the oldest church with the original foundation in the area. Bishop Francis Asbury preached there.  Location  Pungo is located about ten miles (16 km) south of the heart of Virginia Beach, and is about southeast of the Norfolk International Airport. The \\"heart\\" of the Pungo area is its only intersection with a stoplight at Princess Anne Road and Indian River Road. Pungo lies south of Sandbridge road, which serves as Virginia Beach's \\"Green Line.\\"http://va.water.usgs.gov/online_pubs/FCT_SHT/FS173-99/fs173-99.html This helps to assure that Pungo will remain rural, as opposed to its neighbors in the Princess Anne area, such as Courthouse, Red Mill and Lago Mar, which lie just north of the Green Line. Witch of Pungo Grace Sherwood (1660‚Äì1740) is a local legend in the old Princess Anne County and Pungo, Virginia. The Associated Press reports that she was an unconventional woman in a number of ways, which drew attention to her. She was first accused in 1698 of having bewitched a neighbor's crop of cotton. Allegations against her grew, and the Princess Anne County government, along with her accusers decided that she would be tested by ducking, with Sherwood's consent. She was taken to what is now known as Witch Duck Point, tied crossbound, and tossed into the river, but she managed to untie herself and swim to the surface. Strawberry Festival The only stoplight in Pungo. The defunct Munden's store is in the background The Pungo Strawberry Festival began in 1984 and is held every year for three days on Memorial Day weekend. (One exception is 2020, when it was cancelled because of the COVID-19 pandemic.) Attendance at the festival's inception in 1984 was 50,000, and now it regularly attracts over 120,000 visitors. Strawberries prepared over 50 different ways are featured. Activities include a pie eating contest, strawberry bake-off, continuous entertainment on three stages, a parade, one of the largest carnivals on the east coast, livestock show and sale, a multimillion-dollar military display, pig races, youth art show, a 4-H area, pony rides, bands, and arts and craft booths. The sponsoring organization is a non-profit. All proceeds from the Festival are donated to non-profit community and service organizations. There are many food, youth, civic, and service organization booths. Each year, the festival has an honorary mayor, first lady, and witch of Pungo. In 2013, Fox News ranked it as the 3rd best spring food festival in America.\\"America's 10 Best Spring Food Festivals.\\", 10 Apr. 2013. Web. .

The Sunday strip ran in the New York Daily News from February 17, 1952, to May 13, 1955, initially as a full tabloid page and, near the end, as a half tab. It is set in the same universe as the Williamson novels Seetee Ship and Seetee Shock. The creation of Beyond Mars happened in an unusual way--because of a bad review. The New York Times reviewed a Williamson novel, stating that his writing \\"ranks only slightly above that of comic strip adventures.\\" The review was read by Daily News editor Ana Barker who immediately contacted Williamson, hired him to script a similar comic strip and teamed him with illustrator Elias. Characters and story The storyline was loosely based on Seetee Ship. Headquartered on Brooklyn Rock, in the new frontier of the asteroid belt during the year 2191, freelance pilot Mike Flint steered his antimatter-powered craft across the universe by counteracting the pull of gravity on other solar systems. Although Flint held a license as a spatial engineer, he became more of an outer space policeman, often getting an assist from several alien sidekicks. Comics historian Dave Karlen reviewed: :In 1952 the New York News wanted to celebrate their success from a steady increase in newspaper circulation and decided an exclusive feature created for their publication would be just the ticket... It is said Chester Gould suggested many of the story lines and helped Williamson from time to time on a proper way to present a comic strip plot. This colorful space-opera drama with a stellar Dick Tracy feel was beautifully rendered in the \\"Noel Sickles School\\" by Elias with its amazingly detailed exotic locals, amusing alien creatures, beautiful women and lots of two-fisted action. But as with many strips over time, the New York News believed their creation did not live up to its expectations and cut the size to a half-page in late 1954, which probably contributed to its untimely demise on March 13, 1955 as the creative team wrapped up some final loose ends in the last Sunday.\\"My Greatest Adventure: Beyond Mars,\\" June 1, 2009.

The company was based in Sunnyvale, California. History While Kalb was the vice-president of the division of Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) that built integrated circuits, some researchers in that division were building a supercomputer based on the Goodyear MPP (massively parallel processor) supercomputer. The DEC researchers enhanced the architecture by: * making the processor elements to be 4-bit instead of 1-bit John Culver. \\"MasPar: Massively Parallel Computers ‚Äì 32 cores on a chip\\". * increasing the connectivity of each processor element to 8 neighbors from 4. * adding a global interconnect for all of the processing elements, which was a triple-redundant switch which was easier to implement than a full crossbar switch. After Digital decided not to commercialize the research project, Kalb decided to start a company to sell this minisupercomputer. In 1990, the first generation product MP-1 was delivered. In 1992, the follow-on MP-2 was shipped. The company shipped more than 200 systems. MasPar along with nCUBE criticized the open government support, by DARPA, of competitors Intel for their hypercube Personal SuperComputers (iPSC) and the Thinking Machines Connection Machine on the pages of Datamation. Samples of MasPar MPs, from the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, are in storage at the Computer History Museum. MasPar offered a family of SIMD machines, second sourced by DEC. The processor units are proprietary. There was no MP-3. MasPar exited the computer hardware business in June 1996, halting all hardware development and transforming itself into a new data mining software company called NeoVista Software. NeoVista was acquired by Accrue Software in 1999, which in turn sold the division to JDA Software in 2001.Bloomberg Businessweek, Company Overview of Neovista Software, Inc.DSstar Vol. 5 No. 27 (July 3, 2001), JDA Software Buys Accrue Software's NeoVista DM Products Hardware MasPar architecture MasPar is unique in being a manufacturer of SIMD supercomputers (as opposed to vector machines). In this approach, a collection of ALU's listen to a program broadcast from a central source. The ALUs can do their own data fetch, but are all under control of a central Array Control Unit. There is a central clock. The emphasis is on communications efficiency, and low latency. The MasPar architecture is designed to scale, and balance processing, memory, and communication. The Maspar MP-1 PE and the later binary-compatible Maspar MP-2 PE are full custom CMOS chips, designed in-house, and fabricated by various vendors such as HP or TI. The Array Control Unit (ACU) handles instruction fetch. It is a load-store architecture. The MasPar architecture is Harvard in a broad sense. The ACU implements a microcoded instruction fetch, but achieves a RISC-like 1 instruction per clock. The Arithmetic units, ALUs with data fetch capability, are implemented 32 to a chip. Each ALU is connected in a nearest neighbor fashion to 8 others. The edge connections are brought off-chip. In this scheme, the perimeters can be toroid-wrapped. Up to 16,384 units can be connected within the confines of a cabinet. A global router, essentially a cross-bar switch, provides external I/O to the processor array. MasPar topology The MP-2 PE chip contains 32 processor elements, each a full 32-bit ALU with floating point, registers, and a barrel shifter. Only the instruction fetch feature is removed, and placed in the ACU. The PE design is literally replicated 32 times on the chip. The chip is designed to interface to DRAM, to other processor array chips, and to communication router chips. Each ALU, called a PE slice, contains sixty four 32 bit registers that are used for both integer and floating point. The registers are both bit and byte addressable. The floating point unit handles single precision and double precision arithmetic on IEEE format numbers. Each PE slice contains two registers for data memory address, and the data. Each PE also has two one-bit serial ports, one for inbound and one for outbound communication to its nearest neighbor. The direction of communication is controlled globally. The PEs also have inbound and outbound paths to a global router for I/O. A broadcast port allows a single instance of data to be \\"promoted\\" to parallel data. Alternately, global data can be 'or-ed' to a scalar result. The serial links support 1 Mbyte/s bit-serial communication that allows coordinated register-register communication between processors. Each processor has its own local memory, implemented in DRAM. No internal memory is included on the processors. Microcoded instruction decode is used. MasPar PE cluster The 32 PEs on a chip are clustered into two groups sharing a common memory interface, or M-machine, for access. A global scoreboard keeps track of memory and register usage. The path to memory is 16 bits wide. Both big and little endian formats are supported. Each processor has its own 64 Kbyte of memory. Both direct and indirect data memory addressing are supported. The chip is implemented in 1.0-micrometre, two-level, metal CMOS, dissipates 0.8 watt, and is packaged in a 208-pin PQFP. A relatively low clock rate of 12.5 MHz is used. The Maspar machines are front ended by a host machine, usually a VAX. They are accessed by extensions to Fortran and C. Full IEEE single- and double-precision floating point are supported. There is no cache for the ALUs. Cache is not required, due to the memory interface operating at commensurate speed with the ALU data accesses. The ALUs do not implement memory management for data memory. The ACU uses demand paged virtual memory for the instruction memory.

He is considered a national hero in Peru and was declared patron of the Army of Peru by the government of Peru on January 2 of 1951.  Early life and education  Bolognesi Square in Lima, Peru c. 1929 Francisco Bolognesi was born in Lima on November 4, 1816. He attended the Seminary of Arequipa until he was 16 and then entered into a career in commerce. His father, Andr√©s Bolognesi was of Italian-Peruvian background and was a violin player for the court of the Viceroy. Francisco Bolognesi had a son called Federico Pablo whose son was Federico Bolognesi Bolognesi (2nd Vicepresident of Peru). Federico Bolognesi Bolognesi had a daughter called Ana Maria Bolognesi who had two daughters called Ana Mamie and Selina Raguz Bolognesi.  Military career  He was involved with the military in July, 1844, in an action at Carmen Alto, a local district of Arequipa, south region of Per√∫.http://www.biografiasyvidas.com/biografia/b/bolognesi.htm While offered a position in the military, he elected to remain in civilian life. However, in 1853, he enlisted and was selected as second in command of a cavalry regiment during a period of tension between Peru and Bolivia. While no armed conflict with Bolivia ensued, Bolognesi elected to remain in the military and took part in the revolution against then-President Echenique. After the successful revolution, Bolognesi was a Lieutenant Colonel on the General Staff. In 1856, Bolognesi commanded the artillery involved in suppressing the revolt of General Manuel Ignacio de Vivanco, centered in the city of Arequipa, and was promoted to Colonel. After several missions to Europe to help acquire weapons for Peru (especially artillery), Bolognesi returned to Peru in May 1866. He fell afoul of President Don Mariano Ignacio Prado and was imprisoned briefly in 1867. After the fall of Prado, Bolognesi returned to military service, commanding various artillery units of the Peruvian army, retiring in 1871 as Commander-in-Chief of the Artillery.  War of the Pacific  War of the Pacific - 1880, Just Before The Battle of Arica \\"I have sacred duties to fulfill, and I will fulfill them until I fire the last round\\" When the War of the Pacific began in 1879 between Chile and the alliance of Peru and Bolivia, Bolognesi, now 62, rejoined the Peruvian Army and was active in actions against the Chilean forces, including the Battles of Dolores and Tarapac√° in November, 1879. In April, 1880, he was placed in command of the Peruvian port of Arica. He commanded the Peruvian forces surrounded in Arica by Chilean troops following the Chilean victory at Tacna. He organized and led a spirited defense of the port city by about 1,600 men against over 5,300 Chilean troops with extensive naval support. When Chilean messengers demanded surrender of Arica because of their 3 to 1 numerical superiority, he replied, \\"Tengo deberes sagrados que cumplir y los cumplir√© hasta quemar el √∫ltimo cartucho\\" (\\"I have sacred duties, and I will fulfill them until the last cartridge has been fired\\"). The expression \\"hasta quemar el √∫ltimo cartucho\\" (\\"Until the last cartridge has been fired\\") has passed into the Spanish language and is used today by the Peruvian Army as its official motto. Thus the Battle of Arica began. The Chileans struck first, attacking fort Ciudadela where the battalions of Grandaderos (Tacna) and Artesanos (Arica) fought fiercely. The old Colonel Justo Arias y Araguez died in combat, while Corporal Alfredo Maldonado was killed in the explosion of a powder keg, that killed Peruvian, as well as ten Chilean soldiers. The Chileans responded by issuing the command to take no prisoners. Bolognesi, Manuel J. La Torre, Alfonso Ugarte, Roque Saenz Pena y Juan Guillermo More gathered 400 Peruvian soldiers a top of the infamous hill known as El Morro. The Chileans stormed el Morro advancing from Cerro Gordo. In the midst of the fierce hand-to-hand combat that developed at the top of el Morro, Colonel Bolognesi was shot and wounded. Clenching his revolver he continued fighting until he was killed from a blow to the head (some speculate a bullet being the cause of death). His soldiers defended his remains until they too were eventually killed. Next to Bolognesi, Juan Guillermo More, Captain of the Navy and Chief of Artillery, fought to the end of his life with a revolver and sword in hand. On June 7, 1880, the Chilean assault took Arica at a cost of 474 troops. Almost 1,000 of the Peruvian defenders, including Colonel Bolognesi, were killed in defense of the town. The Peruvian casualty levels in the battle were so high because many of the wounded Peruvian prisoners were shot by the Chileans. The Chileans ransacked buildings, started fires and attacked Peruvian consulates amongst other crimes. The Chileans justified these acts saying they were seeking revenge for explosions caused by Peruvians in a few Chilean mines during the battle that caused some casualties. Bolognesi's sons Enrique and Augusto also fought in the War of the Pacific, and died later, during the Battle of San Juan and the Battle of Miraflores in Lima.

The gameplay revolves around surviving on a deserted island. The game features an open-ended structure that presents the player with multiple ways to progress through the game, all at the player's own pace. Gameplay The 2D view is characteristic of most adventure games of its generation such as The Legend of Zelda. The player must keep track of hunger, thirst and fatigue meters in addition to the traditional Health Points, which require the accomplishment of \\"every day\\" tasks such as eating, drinking, and sleeping, as well as hunting, gathering, and finding a place to rest. Another important aspect of the game is the item- crafting system. Many elements of the environment can be picked up and collected, although most objects serve no purpose in their original form. However, the game allows the player to combine two or three objects in order to form tools, weapons, and other items to assist in the player character's survival, known in-game as \\"merging.\\" For example, a vine and a flexible piece of tree can be combined to form a bow; a stick, bird feather and pointed rock can be combined to form arrows; and a flexible piece of tree can be combined with a discovered line of fishing gut to form a fishing rod. Many of the items, such as kindling, arrows and torches, degrade over time and ultimately break, making the building of additional items necessary. Foods, such as meats, can go rotten in just an in-game day, but the player can merge cooked meats with flora identified as spices in order to preserve them; although there are about 15 set types of flora in the game, their effects when eaten get switched around in every new game. The game features a non-linear structure, giving the player the freedom to progress through the game without specific goals in mind beyond attaining the basic necessities of survival. While the gameplay is free and unrestrained by any real plotline, there are a host of different endings dependent on discoveries the player makes, what objects the player has crafted, the current situation after a particular amount of time has elapsed, and so on. Plot The background of the game's story is minimal. All that is truly known is that the player character, either a boy named Ken (Kou in Japan), or a girl named Mery (Nami in Japan) (the names are optional), has become stranded on a deserted island after a storm capsizes the player's boat, and must actively work to survive and possibly find a way to escape back to civilization. Interaction with other characters is scarce or entirely absent, depending on how the player chooses to progress throughout the game. Reception The game received \\"favorable\\" reviews according to video game review aggregator GameRankings. Retro Gamer included it on their list of top ten Game Boy Color games.http://www.retrogamer.net/top_10/game-boy-color-games/ Sequels A sequel, Survival Kids 2: Dasshutsu! Futago Shima (\\"Survival Kids 2: Escape the Twin Islands\\") was released on July 19, 2000https://www.coolspotgaming.co.uk/products/survival-kids-2-game-boy-colour- english-translation. Like the original, it featured multiple endings, but also added multiple openings and Game Link Cable support. The series was continued on the Nintendo DS with Lost in Blue, Lost in Blue 2, and Lost in Blue 3 released worldwide in 2005, 2007, and 2008 respectively. The Japanese versions of the game retain the Survival Kids title. A Wii game titled Survival Kids Wii was released in 2008 for the series pre-release in Japan, and Lost in Blue: Shipwrecked for the North American release.

Bulgarin Thaddeus Venediktovich Bulgarin (; Polish Jan Tadeusz Krzysztof Bu≈Çharyn, - ), was a Russian writer, journalist and publisher of Polish, Bulgarian and Albanian ancestry. In addition to his newspaper work, he rejuvenated the Russian novel, and published the first theatrical almanac in Russian. During his life, his novels were translated and published in English, French, German, Swedish, Polish, and Czech. He served as a soldier under Napoleon, and in later life as an agent of the Czar's secret police.The secret police were known as the Third Department of the Personal Office of His Imperial Majesty, and were later replaced by the Okhrana. \\"–§–∏–≥–ª—è—Ä–∏–Ω\\" was a derogatory play on words from Bulgarin's first name and \\"—Ñ–∏–≥–ª—è—Ä\\" a jester or clown. This play on words was first made by the poet Vyazemsky, and immortalized in an epigram by Yevgeny Baratynsky, published in 1827. As a writer his self-imposed mission was to popularize the authoritarian policies of Alexander I and Nicholas I. Life and career Bulgarin was born into a noble Polish family near Minsk, Belarus (then Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth). His father, one of Kosciuszko's associates, was exiled to Siberia for having assassinated a Russian general. Bulgarin was educated in a St. Petersburg military school, took part in the Battle of Friedland but was arrested for theft soon afterwards. While his regiment was stationed in Finland, Bulgarin deserted to Warsaw, but on the way was drafted to the Grande Arm√©e. He fought under Napoleon's banners in the Peninsular War and the 1812 Lithuanian campaign. In 1812 Bulgarin was taken prisoner in Battle of Berezina and transported to Prussia. There is a 6-year lapse in his biography after that. In 1820, Bulgarin travelled from Warsaw to St. Petersburg, where he published a critical review of Polish literature and started editing The Northern Archive. He also made friends with the playwright Alexander Griboyedov and the philologist Nicholas Gretsch. The latter helped him to edit the newspaper Northern Bee (1825‚Äì39), the literary journal Fatherland's Son (1825‚Äì59), and other reactionary periodicals. Bulgarin's tomb in Tartu Bulgarin's unscrupulous manners made him the most odious journalist in Russia. Alexander Pushkin, in particular, ridiculed him in a number of epigrams, changing his name to Figlyarin (from a Russian word for \\"clown\\"). Bulgarin retorted with epigrams, in which Pushkin's name was rendered as Chushkin (from the Russian word for \\"nonsense\\"). Inspired by Sir Walter Scott, Bulgarin wrote the Vejeeghen (Vyzhigin) series of historical novels, which used to be popular in Russia and abroad. He followed these with two sententious novels Dmitry the Pretender (1830),The English translation of Dmitry the Pretender appeared in 1831 under the title Demetrius. about the False Dmitry, and Mazepa (1834) about Ivan Mazepa. In 1837 he published under his own name a lengthy description of Imperial Russia, although much of the work was actually by Nikolai Alexeyevich Ivanov, then a Ph.D. student at Dorpat University. Some of Bulgarin's stories are science fiction: Probable Tall-Tales is a far future story about the 29th century; Improbable Tall-Tales is a fantastic voyage into hollow Earth; The Adventures of Mitrofanushka on the Moon is a satire. After Nicholas I's death, Bulgarin retired from the department of stud farms, in which he had been serving for many years, and withdrew to his manor in Karlova (Karlowa in German) a suburb of Tartu at the time, but now incorporated within the city.

While the normal standards for numbering tropical depressions in the Atlantic indicate that the old name/number is retained when a depression dissipates and regenerates, satellite data indicated that the surface circulation from tropical depression ten had separated from the mid level low and dissipated as it moved ashore in Cuba. A second tropical wave combined with mid-level remnants of Tropical Depression Ten north of Puerto Rico to form a new, more dynamic system, which was then designated as Tropical Depression Twelve. Simultaneously, the trough in the upper troposphere weakened, causing wind shear in the area to relax, thereby allowing the new tropical depression to develop. In a later re- analysis, it was determined that the low-level circulation Ten had completely detached and dissipated, with only the remnant mid-level circulation moving on and merging with the aforementioned second tropical wave.

Biography Geddes was born in Edinburgh, Scotland. In his boyhood he was taken to Canada, but in 1843 he returned to Scotland. He then studied at Calcutta in the British military academy, entered the British Army in the Royal Horse Artillery, and after distinguishing himself in the Punjab campaign in the First Anglo-Afghan War, particularly at the Khyber Pass. He returned to Canada and was commissioned a colonel in a regiment of cavalry. He married New York native Margaret Moore on October 14, 1856, in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia. In 1857 he resigned from the army and moved to the United States, settling in Vinton, Iowa, where he taught school. In the American Civil War, Geddes served in the Union army, enlisting as a private in the 8th Iowa Infantry. He was promoted to captain and then lieutenant colonel, and after February 1862 as colonel of volunteers. He took part in the fighting at Shiloh, where he was wounded and captured. He was imprisoned for a time at Madison, Georgia, and in Libby Prison in Richmond, Virginia. After being exchanged, he fought at Vicksburg and Jackson. In October 1863, he was given command of a brigade and sent to Brownsville, Texas. Subsequently, he served as the provost marshal of Federal occupied Memphis, Tennessee, which he saved from seizure by Confederate cavalry under Nathan Bedford Forrest. He commanded a brigade in the Mobile Campaign and fought with distinction at the Battle of Spanish Fort. On January 13, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Geddes for appointment to the grade of brevet brigadier general of volunteers, to rank from June 5, 1865, and the United States Senate confirmed the appointment on March 12, 1866.Eicher, John H., and David J. Eicher, Civil War High Commands. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2001. . p. 746. After the war, Geddes was principal of the Iowa College for the Blind at Vinton, and until his death was connected with the Iowa College of Agriculture at Ames, being military instructor and cashier in 1870-1882, acting president in 1875-77, librarian in 1877-78, vice- president and professor of military tactics in 1880-82, and treasurer in 1884-87\\\\. He wrote a number of popular war songs, including The Soldiers' Battle Prayer and The Stars and Stripes. He died at Ames, Iowa on February 21, 1887.Eicher, 2001, p. 252.

One of the Dead Sea scrolls (4Q405) construes them as angels; late sections of the Book of Enoch (61:10, 71:7) portray them as a class of celestial beings who (along with the Cherubim and Seraphim) never sleep, but guard the throne of God. These \\"wheels\\" have been associated with (mentioned as galgal, traditionally \\"the wheels of galgallin\\", in \\"fiery flame\\" and \\"burning fire\\") of the four, eye-covered wheels (each composed of two nested wheels), that move next to the winged Cherubim, beneath the throne of God. The four wheels move with the Cherubim because the spirit of the Cherubim is in them. The late Second Book of Enoch (20:1, 21:1) also referred to them as the \\"many-eyed ones\\". The First Book of Enoch (71.7) seems to imply that the Ophanim are equated to the \\"Thrones\\" in Christianity when it lists them all together, in order: \\"...round about were Seraphim, Cherubim, and Ophannin\\".http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/boe/boe074.htm (accessed 11 April 2018)  Function  It is said that they were the actual wheels of the Lord's Heavenly Chariot (Merkabah). \\"The four wheels had rims and they had spokes, and their rims were full of eyes round about.\\" They are also frequently referred to as \\"many-eyed ones.\\"  Ophanim in specific spiritual traditions  = Ophanim in Judaism = Maimonides lists Ophanim as the closest of angels to God in his exposition of the Jewish angelic hierarchy. In prayer The kedushah section in the morning prayer (in the blessings preceding the recitation of the Shema) includes the phrase, \\"The ophanim and the holy living creatures with great uproar raise themselves up; facing the seraphim they offer praise, saying, 'Blessed be God's glory from His place.\\" The inspiration behind this particular passage is Ezekiel's vision (ch. i.). The theme of angels praising God was inserted into the passage by paytanim (Jewish liturgical poets). Ophanim are mentioned in the el adon prayer, often sung by the congregation, as part of the traditional Shabbat morning service. In the Jewish angelic hierarchy thrones and wheels are different. This is also true in the Kabbalistic angelic hierarchy. = Thrones in the Orthodox Church = De Coelesti Hierarchia refers to the Thrones (from the Old Testament description) as the third Order of the first sphere, the other two superior orders being the Cherubim and Seraphim. It is mentioned that \\"The name of the most glorious and exalted Thrones denotes that which is exempt from and untainted by any base and earthly thing, and the super mundane ascent up the steep. For these have no part in that which is lowest, but dwell in fullest power, immovably and perfectly established in the Most High, and receive the Divine Immanence above all passion and matter, and manifest God, being attentively open to divine participations.\\" This view was also accepted by the Catholic Church and by St Thomas Aquinas.The Nine Choirs of Angels (catholic.org)What are the categories of Angels (archangels, thrones, dominions, seraphim)?(http://catholicstraightanswers.com) = Lords of the Flame in the Western Wisdom Teachings = The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception refers that the \\"Lords of the Flame\\", the Hierarchy of Elohim astrologically assigned to Leo, are the Thrones (from the Old Testament description, \\"because of the brilliant luminosity of their bodies and their great spiritual powers.\\"); the other two superior hierarchies being also the Cherubim and Seraphim. According to this conception, the heavenly Seraphim and Cherubim as well as the Ophanim continue to aid humans in spiritual evolution; as do the heavenly Archangels and Angels.

It is an indirect topology that relies on the perfect shuffle interconnection algorithm. Omega network with 8 processing elements Connection architecture An 8x8 Omega network is a multistage interconnection network, meaning that processing elements (PEs) are connected using multiple stages of switches. Inputs and outputs are given addresses as shown in the figure. The outputs from each stage are connected to the inputs of the next stage using a perfect shuffle connection system. This means that the connections at each stage represent the movement of a deck of cards divided into 2 equal decks and then shuffled together, with each card from one deck alternating with the corresponding card from the other deck. In terms of binary representation of the PEs, each stage of the perfect shuffle can be thought of as a cyclic logical left shift; each bit in the address is shifted once to the left, with the most significant bit moving to the least significant bit. At each stage, adjacent pairs of inputs are connected to a simple exchange element, which can be set either straight (pass inputs directly through to outputs) or crossed (send top input to bottom output, and vice versa). For N processing element, an Omega network contains N/2 switches at each stage, and log2N stages. The manner in which these switches are set determines the connection paths available in the network at any given time. Two such methods are destination-tag routing and XOR-tag routing, discussed in detail below. The Omega Network is highly blocking, though one path can always be made from any input to any output in a free network. =Destination-tag routing= In destination-tag routing, switch settings are determined solely by the message destination. The most significant bit of the destination address is used to select the output of the switch in the first stage; if the most significant bit is 0, the upper output is selected, and if it is 1, the lower output is selected. The next-most significant bit of the destination address is used to select the output of the switch in the next stage, and so on until the final output has been selected. For example, if a message's destination is PE 001, the switch settings are: upper, upper, lower. If a message's destination is PE 101, the switch settings are: lower, upper, lower. These switch settings hold regardless of the PE sending the message. =XOR- tag routing= In XOR-tag routing, switch settings are based on (source PE) XOR (destination PE). This XOR-tag contains 1s in the bit positions that must be swapped and 0s in the bit positions that both source and destination have in common. The most significant bit of the XOR-tag is used to select the setting of the switch in the first stage; if the most significant bit is 0, the switch is set to pass-through, and if it is 1, the switch is crossed. The next-most significant bit of the tag is used to set the switch in the next stage, and so on until the final output has been selected. For example, if PE 001 wishes to send a message to PE 010, the XOR-tag will be 011 and the appropriate switch settings are: A2 straight, B3 crossed, C2 crossed. =Applications= In multiprocessing, omega networks may be used as connectors between the CPUs and their shared memory, in order to decrease the probability that the CPU-to-memory connection becomes a bottleneck. This class of networks has been built into the Illinois Cedar Multiprocessor, into the IBM RP3, and into the NYU Ultracomputer.

For example, toluidine blue becomes dark blue (with a colour range from blue-red dependent on glycosaminoglycan content) when bound to cartilage. Other widely used metachromatic stains are the haematological Giemsa and May-Grunwald stains that also contain thiazine dyes. The white cell nucleus stains purple, basophil granules intense magenta, whilst the cytoplasms (of mononuclear cells) stains blue. The absence of color change in staining is named orthochromasia. The underlying mechanism for metachromasia requires the presence of polyanions within the tissue. When these tissues are stained with a concentrated basic dye solution, such as toluidine blue, the bound dye molecules are close enough to form dimeric and polymeric aggregates. The light absorption spectra of these stacked dye aggregates differ from those of the individual monomeric dye molecules. Cell and tissue structures that have high concentrations of ionized sulfate and phosphate groups‚Äîsuch as the ground substance of cartilage, heparin-containing granules of mast cells, and rough endoplasmic reticulum of plasma cells‚Äîexhibit metachromasia. This depends on the charge density of the negative sulfate and carboxylate anions in the glycosaminoglycan (GAG). The GAG polyanion stabilizes the stacked, positively-charged dye molecules, resulting in a spectral shift as the conjugated double bond œÄ-orbitals of adjacent dye molecules overlap. The greater the degree of stacking, the greater the metachromatic shift. Thus, hyaluronic acid, lacking sulphate groups and with only moderate charge density, causes slight metachromasia; chondroitin sulfate, with an additional sulfate residue per GAG saccharide dimer, is an effective metachromatic substrate, whilst heparin, with further N-sulfation, is strongly metachromatic. Therefore, toluidine blue will appear purple to red when it stains these components. The metachromatic properties of dimethylmethylene blue, a thiazine dye closely related to toluidine blue, have been exploited to assay glycosaminoglycans extracted from cartilage and other connective tissues. The absorption peak shifts from about 630 nm (red absorption, therefore blue colour) to about 530 nm in the presence of GAG. Humbel and Etringer's original assay was developed by others to create a stable and widely used dimethylmethylene blue reagent. Although metachromasia was observed and described since 1875, by Cornil, Ranvier and others, it was the German scientist Paul Ehrlich (1854-1915) who gave its name and studied it more extensively. The modern understanding of metachromasia was advanced by Belgian histologist Lucien Lison, who studied it between 1933 and 1936 and ascertained its value in the quantitative determination of sulfate esters of high molecular weight. He also studied the metachromasia of nucleic acids. More recently, Karlheinz Toepfer published in 1970 spectral shifts with increasing concentration of the thiazine dyes that matched the spectra of dye:heparin mixtures, showing clearly that metachromasia, corresponding to the colour of stained cartilage, could be reproduced by high concentration of the dye alone in solution. Hence, proximity of the dye molecules was the key parameter in defining metachromasia. Another example of metachromatic dye (fluorochrome) is acridine orange. Under certain conditions it stains single- stranded nucleic acids fluorescing red (red luminescence) while when interacts with double stranded nucleic acids gives green fluorescence.

Dent has been compared to American historian Francis Parkman for his ability to write about Canadian history without being dull and dry. He was born in Kendal, Westmorland, England. Shortly after his birth, his family emigrated to the Canadian West. Dent received his primary education in Canadian schools, studied law in Brantford, Ontario, and became an attorney in 1865. He practised law for a few years, but found the profession did not suit him, and was drawn to pursue literary endeavours instead. He accordingly relinquished his practice as soon as he felt himself in a position to do so, and went to England. He developed his journalistic skills working for The Daily Telegraph. He also contributed a series of articles to the periodical Once a Week. He supported his wife and family as a writer, concentrating on work that could be quickly written and readily sold. Accordingly, Dent produced no particularly ambitious work in England. After remaining in England for several years, Dent and his family moved to the U.S. in 1867. He obtained a position in Boston, which he held for about two years. Then he went to Toronto, having accepted a position on the editorial staff of the Toronto Evening Telegram, which was then just starting. For several years Dent was a journalist for various newspapers, but principally the Toronto Weekly Globe. To that journal he contributed a very notable series of biographical sketches on \\"Eminent Canadians\\". In 1880, soon after the death of George Brown, founder of the Globe, Dent severed his connection with that paper and began his first ambitious undertaking, The Canadian Portrait Gallery (1880), which ran to four large volumes. It contained biographies of Canadian public figures, living and dead, carefully prepared, and written without partisanship. This book attained a considerable circulation, and brought to its author a comparatively large sum of money. Dent's second book was The Last Forty Years: Canada since the Union of 1841, which received praise. His third work was a History of the Rebellion in Upper Canada (1885-6). Through careful research, Dent was able to throw new light on the characters of the men who took part in the Upper Canada Rebellion. This work met with severe criticism when first published, as it contradicted commonly held beliefs at the time. In writing history, he was in accord with Thomas Babington Macaulay. He believed that a true story should be told as agreeably as a fictitious one; \\"that the incidents of real life, whether political or domestic, admit of being so arranged as, without detriment to accuracy, to command all the interest of an artificial series of facts; that the chain of circumstances which constitute history may be as finely and gracefully woven as any tale of fancy.\\" He also wrote sketches, essays and stories. A collection of his stories was published posthumously in The Gerrard Street mystery and other weird tales (1888). Dent was elected to fellowship in the Royal Society of Canada in 1887. He was said to be light-hearted, witty and genial. References This article contains material from the \\"Prefatory Sketch\\" in The Gerrard Street Mystery and Other Weird Tales.

Gun laying is the process of aiming an artillery piece or turret, such as a gun, howitzer, or mortar, on land, in air, or at sea, against surface or aerial targets. It may be laying for direct fire, where the gun is aimed similarly to a rifle, or indirect fire, where firing data is calculated and applied to the sights. The term includes automated aiming using, for example, radar-derived target data and computer-controlled guns. Description Eland armoured car. Gun elevation is controlled by the left traverse wheel, horizontal turret rotation by the right. Gun laying is a set of actions to align the axis of a gun barrel so that it points in the required direction. This alignment is in the horizontal and vertical planes. A gun is \\"traversed\\" (rotated in a horizontal plane) to align it with the target, and \\"elevated\\" (moved in the vertical plane) to range it to the target. Gun laying may be for direct fire, where the layer sees the target, or indirect fire, where the target may not be visible from the gun. Gun laying has sometimes been called \\"training the gun\\". Laying in the vertical plane (elevation angle) uses data derived from trials or empirical experience. For any given gun and projectile types, it reflects the distance to the target and the size of the propellant charge. It also incorporates any differences in height between gun and target. With indirect fire, it may allow for other variables as well. With direct fire, laying in the horizontal plane is merely the line of sight to the target, although the layer may make allowance for the wind, and with rifled guns the sights may compensate for projectile \\"drift\\". With indirect fire the horizontal angle is relative to something, typically the gun's aiming point, although with modern electronic sights it may be a north-seeking gyro. Depending on the gun mount, there is usually a choice of two trajectories. The dividing angle between the trajectories is about 45 degrees (usually between 0 degrees and 90 degrees), it varies slightly due to gun dependent factors. Below 45 degrees the trajectory is called \\"low angle\\" (or lower register), above 45 degrees is \\"high angle\\" (or upper register). The differences are that low angle fire has a shorter time of flight, a lower vertex, and flatter angle of descent. All guns have carriages or mountings that support the barrel assembly (called the ordnance in some countries). Early guns could only be traversed by moving their entire carriage or mounting, and this lasted with heavy artillery into World War II. Mountings could be fitted into traversing turrets on ships, coast defences or tanks. From circa 1900 field artillery carriages provided traverse without moving the wheels and trail. The carriage, or mounting, also enabled the barrel to be set at the required elevation angle. With some gun mounts it is possible to depress the gun, i.e., move it in the vertical plane to point it below the horizon. Some guns require a near-horizontal elevation for loading. An essential capability for any elevation mechanism is to prevent the weight of the barrel forcing its heavier end downward. This is greatly helped by having trunnions (around which the elevating mass rotates vertically) at the centre of gravity, although a counterbalance mechanism can be used. It also means the elevation gear has to be strong enough to resist considerable downward pressure but still be easy for the gun layer to use. Until recoil systems were invented in the late 19th century and integrated into the gun carriage or mount, guns moved substantially backwards when they fired, and had to be moved forward before they could be laid. However, mortars, where the recoil forces were transferred directly into the ground (or water, if mounted on a ship), did not always require such movement. With the adoption of recoil systems for field artillery, it became normal to pivot the saddle on the lower carriage, initially this \\"top traverse\\" was only a few degrees but soon offered a full circle, particularly for anti-aircraft guns. The introduction of recoil systems was an important milestone. History =Background= 36-pounder long gun at the ready. The earliest guns were loaded from the muzzle. They were typically little more than bare barrels moved in wagons and placed on the ground for firing, then wooden frames and beds were introduced. Horizontal alignment with the target was by eye, while vertical laying was done by raising the muzzle with timber or digging a hole for the closed end. Gun carriages were introduced in the 15th century. Two large-diameter wheels, axle-tree and a trail became the standard pattern for field use. The barrel was mounted in a wooden cradle with trunnions to mount it on the carriage. As technology improved, the trunnions became part of the barrel and the cradle was abandoned. Nevertheless, they were relatively large and heavy. Horizontal alignment was a matter of moving the trail. To achieve the required elevation angle, various arrangements were used. At the simplest, it was wedges or quoins between the breech and the trail, but wooden quadrants, or simple scaffolds mounted on the trail, were also used to support the breech and provided larger choice of elevation angle. Screw elevation devices were also used as early as the 16th century. naval cannon mounted on its gun carriage. The breech rope is visible. However, naval and some fortress carriages and mounting evolved differently. Field mobility was not required, so large wheels and trails were irrelevant. Headspace below decks was often low. This led to compact carriages, mostly on four small wheels. Obviously, large horizontal traverses were more difficult, but such things were unnecessary when shooting broadside. However, in fortresses wider traverse was required. One solution was platform and slide mountings. Wide traverse was also useful on some shipmounted guns. Laying required sights. At its simplest, this means nothing more than aiming the guns in the right direction. However, various aids emerged. Horizontal aiming involved sighting along the barrel, this was enhanced by a notch made in the ring around the barrel at the breech end and an 'acorn' on the ring around the muzzle. This was still used in the 19th century in some instances. The range with a flat trajectory was called 'point blank' range. However, while point blank may have been enough for some purposes, field artillery (whether mobile or static) and guns in fortresses needed longer range. This required ways to measure elevation angles and know the relationship between the elevation angle and the range. =Early mechanical gunnery aids= Various 16th-century artillery pieces, including culverin, falconet and mortar The first recorded device to measure an elevation angle was Niccol√≤ Tartaglia's invention of a gunners' quadrant circa 1545. This device had two arms at right angles connected by an arc marked with angular graduations. One arm was placed in the muzzle, and a plumb bob suspended against the arc showed the elevation angle. This led to many calculations relating elevation angle to range. The problem was that these calculations assumed what today is called an \\"in vacuo\\" trajectory ‚Äì they made no allowance for air resistance against the projectile. What was needed were range and accuracy trials to determine the actual relationship between range and elevation angle. The practical approach was conducted by William Eldred, Master Gunner at Dover Castle, in gunnery trials in 1613, 1617 and 1622. He used a wide variety of guns, including the culverin, demiculverin, falconet and Saker. From the results of these trials, he produced range tables for elevations up to 10 degrees for each type with a standard propelling charge weight. A problem affecting gun laying, was the tapered external barrel shape. This affected elevation when the gun was aimed by sighting along the top of the barrel. In the early 17th century, 'dispart sights' compensated for this. This was a piece of metal placed on the muzzle to make the line of sight parallel to the axis of the bore. Another technique involved measuring the depth of the barrel through the touchhole and at the muzzle, the difference being the wedge size needed to compensate for the tapered barrel. Ballistic pendulum, invented by Benjamin Robins to calculate muzzle velocity. The ballistic pendulum was invented in 1742 by English mathematician Benjamin Robins, and published in his book New Principles of Gunnery, which revolutionized the science of ballistics, as it provided the first way to accurately measure the velocity of a bullet. Robins used the ballistic pendulum to measure projectile velocity in two ways. The first was to attach the gun to the pendulum, and measure the recoil. Since the momentum of the gun is equal to the momentum of the ejecta, and since the projectile was (in those experiments) the large majority of the mass of the ejecta, the velocity of the bullet could be approximated. The second, and more accurate method, was to directly measure the bullet momentum by firing it into the pendulum. Robins experimented with musket balls of around one ounce in mass (30 g), while other contemporaries used his methods with cannon shot of . The first system to supplant ballistic pendulums with direct measures of projectile speed was invented in 1808, during the Napoleonic Wars and used a rapidly rotating shaft of known speed with two paper disks on it; the bullet was fired through the disks, parallel to the shaft, and the angular difference in the points of impact provided an elapsed time over the distance between the disks. A direct electromechanical clockwork measure appeared in 1840, with a spring-driven clock started and stopped by electromagnets, whose current was interrupted by the bullet passing through two meshes of fine wires, again providing the time to traverse the given distance. Tangent sights were introduced in the 19th century. These provided the rear sight used with an 'acorn' or similar foresight at the muzzle. The tangent sight was mounted in a bracket beside or behind the breech, the eyepiece (a hole or notch) was atop a vertical bar that moved up and down in the bracket. The bar was marked in yards or degrees. This direct-fire sight was aimed at the target by moving the trail horizontally and elevating or depressing the barrel. By the late 19th century the simple open tangent sights were being replaced by optical telescopes on mounts with an elevation scale and screw aligned to the axis of the bore. =Modern era of gunlaying= Canon de 75 mod√®le 1897 breech mechanism. Rifled and breech loading artillery were introduced from the mid-19th century, notably by William Armstrong, whose gun equipped Royal Navy warships from the 1850s. An important advance in the art of gun laying came with the introduction of the first recoil mechanisms. The barrel recoil was absorbed by hydraulic cylinders and then the barrel was returned to its firing position by a spring that had stored some of the recoil energy. This meant the gun did not have to be repositioned after each time it was fired. An early prototype incorporating this design feature was built in 1872 by Russian engineer, Vladimir Stepanovich Baranovsky. His 2.5-inch rapid-firing gun was also equipped with a screw breech, a self-cocking firing mechanism and it fired a fixed round (shell and cartridge case together). The recoil mechanism was contained in the gun cradle. Despite this effort, nothing followed from it, and it was only with the introduction of the French 75 mm in 1897, that recoil systems started to become normal. The gun's barrel slid back on rollers, pushing a piston into an oil-filled cylinder. This action absorbed the recoil progressively as the internal air pressure rose and, at the end of recoil, generated a strong, but decreasing, back pressure that returned the gun forward to its original position. By this time smokeless powder had replaced gunpowder as the standard propellant. Naval range-finding instruments of 1936. The first practical rangefinder was developed by Barr & Stroud a pioneering Scottish optical engineering firm. Archibald Barr and William Stroud became associated from 1888. In 1891 they were approached by the Admiralty to submit a design for a short-base rangefinder for trial, and in 1892 they were awarded with a contract for six of their rangefinders. The device, operated by one person, brought two images from a distance object into coincidence allowing the distance to be calculated from their relative motions. Eyepiece image of a naval rangefinder, showing the displaced image when not yet adjusted for range. Now that the barrel remained aligned with the target after firing, the more primitive tangent sight was replaced with the rocking-bar sight for direct-fire sighting. These were installed on QF 4.7-inch Gun Mk I‚ÄìIV quick firing gun from 1887. The rocking-bar (or 'bar and drum') sight had an elevation scale, could mount a telescope as well as the open sight, and provided a small amount of horizontal deflection. These provided 'independent line of sight' because they enabled data to be set on the mount and the telescope (or open sight) aimed at the target independent of the barrel elevation. A related problem, particularly for large and longer range guns, was that the wheels could be at different heights due to the slope of the ground, which caused inaccuracy. Before the First World War, the British BL 60-pounder gun was fitted with oscillating (reciprocating) sights, using sighting telescopes, a sight clinometer and range scale as well as a deflection drum for the telescope. These mounts could be cross-leveled, which removed the need for the gun commander to calculate a deflection correction for uneven wheels. Cross-leveling introduced the third axis into laying. Indirect artillery fire Recoil mechanism on the BL 60-pounder gun Mk. I, 1916. Modern indirect fire dates from the late 19th century. In 1882, Russian Lt Col KG Guk, published Field Artillery Fire from Covered Positions that described a better method of indirect laying (instead of aiming points in line with the target). In essence, this was the geometry of using angles to aiming points that could be in any direction relative to the target. The problem was the lack of an azimuth instrument to enable it; clinometers for elevation already existed. The Germans solved this problem by inventing the Richtfl√§che, or lining-plane, in about 1890. This was a gun-mounted rotatable open sight, mounted in alignment with the bore, and able to measure large angles from it. Similar designs, usually able to measure angles in a full circle, were widely adopted over the following decade. By the early 1900s the open sight was sometimes replaced by a telescope and the term goniometer had replaced \\"lining-plane\\" in English. The first incontrovertible, documented use of indirect fire in war using Guk's methods, albeit without lining-plane sights was on 26 October 1899 by British gunners during the Second Boer War. Although both sides demonstrated early on in the conflict that could use the technique effectively, in many subsequent battles, British commanders nonetheless ordered artillery to be \\"less timid\\" and to move forward to address troops' concerns about their guns abandoning them. The British used improvised gun arcs with howitzers; the sighting arrangements used by the Boers with their German and French guns is unclear. A 1904 Russian lining plane sight. Optical sights appeared in the first years of the 20th century, and the German Goerz panoramic sight became the pattern for the rest of the 20th century. They were graduated in degrees and 5 minute intervals, decigrads or mils (4320, 4000 or 6000/6300/6400 to a circle). A feature of 20th-century laying was the use of one- or two-man laying. The US was notable for using two-man laying, horizontal on one side of the gun, elevation on the other. Most other nations mostly used one-man laying. The laying drill, dealing with all three axes, typically adopted this sequence: \\"roughly for line, roughly for elevation, cross-level, accurately for line, accurately for elevation\\". The other main difference in sighting arrangements was the use of an elevation angle or alternatively the range. This issue became more complicated in World War I when the effects of barrel wear in changing muzzle velocity were fully recognised. This meant that different guns needed a different elevation angle for the same range. This led many armies to use an elevation angle calculated in a battery command post. However, in the 1930s the British adopted calibrating sights in which range was set on the sight, which automatically compensated for the difference of muzzle velocity from standard. An alternative to this was a 'gun rule' at each gun; in this case the range was set on the rule and an elevation angle read and given to the layer to set on the sight. The issue was finally resolved by the introduction of digital computers in the battery command post that calculated the correct elevation angle for the range and muzzle velocity accurately and quickly. Apart from calibrating sights, there was no significant difference in field artillery laying arrangements for most of the 20th century. However, in the 1990s new or modified guns started adopting digital sights, following their successful use in the multi-launch rocket system developed in the 1970s. In these the azimuth and elevation were entered manually or automatically into a layers computer, then guided the layer's use of horizontal and elevation controls until the barrel was in the required horizontal and vertical alignment. This computed a correction for the cross level of the gun and used feedback from electro- mechanical devices, such as gyroscopes and electronic clinometers, aligned to the axis of the bore. These devices were subsequently replaced by ring laser gyros. Coastal and naval gun laying advances St. David's Battery, Bermuda, captured data that was used in the plotting room to produce gun- laying data. Most coastal artillery was in fixed defences, \\"fortresses\\" in some form. Their targets moved in two dimensions, and the gun had to be aimed at the target's future position. Some guns were relatively small calibre and dealt with relatively close targets, others were much larger for long-range targets. Coast artillery employed direct fire, and until the late 19th century laying had changed little, apart from gaining telescopic sights, over the centuries. Nineteenth-century improvements in gun design and ammunition greatly extended their effective range. In 1879, Major HS Watkins of the Royal Garrison Artillery invented the depression range finder, the position-range finder and associated fire control systems. His description explains its essence: :\\"The position-finder traces the course of the ship, and when the guns are ready to lay, predicts the position the ship will occupy half a minute or more in advance. The dials on the gun floor automatically indicate the range and training to hit the predicted position. When the guns are laid an electric tube (i.e., primer) is inserted and the signal goes up to the observing station that all is ready for firing. The non-commissioned officer in charge of the position-finder watches for the appearance of the ship in the field of view of his telescope, and when she arrives at the cross wires presses a button, and the guns are fired.\\" It took almost 20 years to get it to full effectiveness, but its general principle became the norm for heavy artillery fire control and laying. Shorter-range guns retained conventional direct-fire laying with telescopes for much longer. In the 20th century, coast artillery, like field and the larger anti-aircraft guns, included corrections for non-standard conditions such as wind and temperature in their calculations.  Fire control systems Accurate fire control systems were introduced in the early 20th century. Pictured, a cut-away view of a destroyer. The below decks analog computer is shown in the centre of the drawing and is labelled \\"Gunnery Calculating Position\\". Naval artillery on board capital ships soon adopted gunlaying arrangements broadly similar to Major Watkins' coast artillery pattern. The introduction of breech-loading guns, then recoil systems and smokeless powder, completed the change in warship armament from hull-mounted to turreted guns. However, ships had a complication compared to land based guns: they were firing from a moving platform. This meant that their laying calculations had to predict the future position of both ship and target. Increasingly sophisticated mechanical calculators were employed for proper gun laying, typically with various spotters and distance measures being sent to a central plotting station deep within the ship. There the fire direction teams fed in the location, speed and direction of the ship and its target, as well as various adjustments for Coriolis effect, weather effects on the air, and other adjustments. The resulting directions, known as a firing solution, would then be fed back out to the turrets for laying. If the rounds missed, an observer could work out how far they missed by and in which direction, and this information could be fed back into the computer along with any changes in the rest of the information and another shot attempted. Rudimentary naval fire control systems were first developed around the time of World War I. Arthur Pollen and Frederic Charles Dreyer independently developed the first such systems. Pollen began working on the problem after noting the poor accuracy of naval artillery at a gunnery practice near Malta in 1900. Lord Kelvin, widely regarded as Britain's leading scientist first proposed using an analogue computer to solve the equations which arise from the relative motion of the ships engaged in the battle and the time delay in the flight of the shell to calculate the required trajectory and therefore the direction and elevation of the guns. Pollen aimed to produce a combined mechanical computer and automatic plot of ranges and rates for use in centralised fire control. To obtain accurate data of the target's position and relative motion, Pollen developed a plotting unit (or plotter) to capture this data. He added a gyroscope to allow for the yaw of the firing ship. Again this required substantial development of the, at the time, primitive gyroscope to provide continuous reliable correction. Trials were carried out in 1905 and 1906, which although completely unsuccessful showed promise. He was encouraged in his efforts by the rapidly rising figure of Admiral Jackie Fisher, Admiral Arthur Knyvet Wilson and the Director of Naval Ordnance and Torpedoes (DNO), John Jellicoe. Pollen continued his work, with tests carried out on Royal Navy warships intermittently. Admiralty Fire Control Table in the transmitting station of HMS Belfast. Meanwhile, a group led by Dreyer designed a similar system. Although both systems were ordered for new and existing ships of the Royal Navy, the Dreyer system eventually found most favour with the Navy in its definitive Mark IV* form. The addition of director control facilitated a full, practicable fire control system for World War I ships, and most RN capital ships were so fitted by mid 1916. The director was high up over the ship where operators had a superior view over any gunlayer in the turrets. It was also able to co-ordinate the fire of the turrets so that their combined fire worked together. This improved aiming and larger optical rangefinders improved the estimate of the enemy's position at the time of firing. The system was eventually replaced by the improved \\"Admiralty Fire Control Table\\" for ships built after 1927. By the 1950s gun turrets were increasingly unmanned, with gun laying controlled remotely from the ship's control centre using inputs from radar and other sources. Telescopic sights for tanks were adopted before World War II, and these sights usually had a means of aiming off for target movement and graticules marked for different ranges. Tank sights were of two general types. Either the sight was in fixed alignment with the axis of the bore with ranges marked in the sight, and the gunner laid the range mark on the target. Or during laying the gunner physically set the range to offset the axis of the bore from the axis of the sight by the correct amount and laid using the centre mark in the sight. Some sights had a means of estimating the range, for example using a stadiametric method. Other tanks used an optical coincident range-finder or after World War II, a ranging machine gun. From the 1970s these were replaced by laser range finders. However, tank guns could not be fired accurately while moving until gun stabilisation was introduced. This appeared at the end of World War II. Some were hydraulic, while others used electrical servos. During the 1970s tanks started being fitted with digital computers. Anti-aircraft gun laying A French anti-aircraft motor battery (motorized AAA battery) that brought down a Zeppelin near Paris. From the journal Horseless Age, 1916. The need to engage balloons and airships, from both the ground and ships, was recognised at the beginning of the 20th century. Aircraft were soon added to the list and the others fell from significance. Anti-aircraft was direct fire, the layer aiming at the aircraft. However, the target is moving in three dimensions and this makes it a difficult target. The basic issue is that either the layer aims at the target and some mechanism aligns the gun at the future (time of flight) position of the target or the layer aims at the future position of the aircraft. In either case the problem is determining the target's height, speed and direction and being able to 'aim-off' (sometimes called deflection laying) for the anti-aircraft projectile time of flight. German air attacks on the British Isles began at the beginning of the First World War. Anti-aircraft gunnery was a difficult business. The problem was of successfully aiming a shell to burst close to its target's future position, with various factors affecting the shells' predicted trajectory. This was called deflection gun-laying, 'off-set' angles for range and elevation were set on the gunsight and updated as their target moved. In this method when the sights were on the target, the barrel was pointed at the target's future position. Range and height of the target determined fuze length. The difficulties increased as aircraft performance improved. The British dealt with range measurement first, when it was realised that range was the key to producing a better fuse setting. This led to the Height/Range Finder (HRF), the first model being the Barr & Stroud UB2, a 2-metre optical coincident rangefinder mounted on a tripod. It measured the distance to the target and the elevation angle, which together gave the height of the aircraft. These were complex instruments and various other methods were also used. The HRF was soon joined by the Height/Fuze Indicator (HFI), this was marked with elevation angles and height lines overlaid with fuze length curves, using the height reported by the HRF operator, the necessary fuse length could be read off. A Canadian anti-aircraft unit of 1918, running to stations. However, the problem of deflection settings‚Äî'aim-off'‚Äîrequired knowing the rate of change in the target's position. Both France and UK introduced tachymetric devices to track targets and produce vertical and horizontal deflection angles. The French Brocq system was electrical, the operator entered the target range and had displays at guns; it was used with their 75 mm. The British Wilson-Dalby gun director used a pair of trackers and mechanical tachymetry; the operator entered the fuse length, and deflection angles were read from the instruments.v In 1925 the British adopted a new instrument developed by Vickers. It was a mechanical analogue computer Predictor AA No 1. Given the target height its operators tracked the target and the predictor produced bearing, quadrant elevation and fuze setting. These were passed electrically to the guns where they were displayed on repeater dials to the layers who 'matched pointers' (target data and the gun's actual data) to lay the guns. This system of repeater electrical dials built on the arrangements introduced by British coast artillery in the 1880s, and coast artillery was the background of many AA officers. Similar systems were adopted in other countries and for example the later Sperry device, designated M3A3 in the US was also used by Britain as the Predictor AA No 2. Height finders were also increasing in size, in Britain, the World War I Barr & Stroud UB 2 ( optical base) was replaced by the UB 7 ( feet optical base) and the UB 10 ( optical base, only used on static AA sites). Goertz in Germany and Levallois in France produced instruments. By World War II the situation was largely as follows: for targets up to a few thousand yards away, a smaller-calibre automatic gun was used, with simple sights that enabled a layer to judge the lead based on estimates of target range and speed; for longer-range targets, manually controlled predictors were used to track the target, taking inputs from optical or radar rangefinders, and calculating firing data for the guns, including allowance for wind and temperature. After World War II predictors changed from being electro-mechanical analogue computers to digital computers, but by this time heavy anti-aircraft guns had been replaced by missiles, but electronics enabled smaller guns to adopt fully automated laying.

Career  Ranvier was born and studied medicine at Lyon, graduating in 1865. He founded a small private research laboratory with Victor Andr√© Cornil, and together they offered a course in histology to medical students. They also wrote together an influential textbook on histopathology. In 1867, Ranvier entered the Coll√®ge de France and worked as an assistant to Claude Bernard. In 1875, he was appointed to its chair of general anatomy. In 1878, Ranvier discovered the nodes which received his name. Other anatomical structures bearing his name are the Merkel-Ranvier cells, melanocyte-like cells in the basal layer of the epidermis that contain catecholamine granules; and Ranvier's tactile disks, a special type of sensory nerve ending. In 1897, he founded the scientific journal Archives d'anatomie microscopique with Edouard-G√©rard Balbiani. Some of his most notable students were Ferdinand-Jean Darier, Justin Marie Jolly, Joaqu√≠n Albarr√°n, Luis Simarro Lacabra and Fredrik Georg Gade.

Imakuni? appeared in many promotional live events conducted in Japan between 1997 and 2002, although his appearance in front of public has declined since. His name is also credited in many of the Pok√©mon series songs, which can be found in the more than ten releases of CDs. In one of the releases in 1998, Imakuni? participated as one of the trio members of a one-time session group dubbed \\"Suzukisan\\", in which he sang together with popular enka singer Sachiko Kobayashi and Raymond Johnson. Imakuni? also appears sometimes as an enemy with his own personal trading card devoted to him in the Pok√©mon Trading Card Game series. While less \\"live\\" exposure is found today, Imakuni? continues his activity through a blog run by Creatures Inc., a creative and designing company mainly engaged in games, card games, 3D graphics and others. In 2003 he performed in the non-Pok√©mon related song , with animation produced by Creatures for NHK's Minna no Uta. Like most of the Japanese Pok√©mon songs up to that point (including anime opening and ending songs), this was composed by Hirokazu Tanaka. Costumes Over the years, he has had several costumes, all which have round, Mickey Mouse style ears. #Round ears, black costume with \\"„Ç§„Éû„ÇØ„ÉãÔºü\\" embroidered on the front.

This toxin belongs to the cysteine- rich secretory protein (CRISP) family. Ophanin weakly blocks the contraction of smooth muscles elicited by high potassium-induced depolarization, suggesting that it inhibits voltage-dependent calcium channels.  Etymology  King Cobra (Ophiophagus hannah) The toxin was named ophanin after the snake whose venom it is derived from, the King Cobra (Ophiophagus hannah).  Sources  Ophanin is produced in the venom glands of the King Cobra (O. Hannah). Although the venom has relatively low toxicity, this is compensated by the high amounts of it injected into the prey for each bite.  Chemistry  = Structure = Ophanin was successfully isolated from O. Hannah venom by gel filtration and cation-exchange chromatography. Its molecular weight is 25 kDa (from positions 19 ‚Äì 239), which conforms to the molecular mass predicted from its cDNA sequences. = Homology = Ophanin is a cysteine-rich secretory protein and therefore belongs to the CRISP family. These proteins possess 16 strictly conserved cysteines and contain 8 disulfide bonds. Ten of the 16 cysteine residues are clustered at the C-terminal end of the protein. Ophanin belongs to the ‚Äúlong‚Äù CRISPs subgroup, which consists of the 9 CRISPs with the longest sequences. Snake venom CRISPs belonging to different subgroups act on different biological targets, contributing in this way to the diversity of damaging effects of snake venoms. = Family = The phylogenetic tree constructed from the nucleotide sequences of all known snake venom CRISPs shows that ophanin is more closely related to the Viperidae branch than the Elapidae branch even though O. Hannah belongs to the Elapidae snakes. Ophanin, along with other specific snake toxins like triflin and ablomin, is also a helothermine-related venom protein (Helveprin) which was originally isolated from the skin of the Mexican beaded lizard.  Target  Ophanin is a weak blocker of the high potassium-induced contraction of smooth muscles. Snake venom CRISP family proteins inhibit depolarization-induced smooth muscle contraction to different extents. Compared to the normal contraction of smooth muscle, ophanin is able to reduce their force of contractility to 84% ¬± 1%, which is less than most other CRISPs. The differences between the inhibitory activity of CRISPs may be explained through sequence comparisons that suggest a site that may be critical for inhibition of channel activity. Phe189 and Glu186 are the most likely functional residues: strong blockers of smooth muscle contraction (ablomin, triflin, and latisemin) all have Phe189, and all blockers of smooth muscle contraction except ophanin have Glu186. The significance of this lack of the probable functional residues in ophanin has not yet been addressed. However, it is likely that the picture is more complex and other residues contribute to the inhibitory activity of CRISPs on smooth muscle contraction and some data supports this. For example, pseudecin, while also having Phe189, does not affect depolarization-induced contraction.  Mode of action  There is no direct evidence of a particular mode of action of ophanin blocking depolarization-induced contractions of the smooth muscles. However, based on the hypothesis of Yamazaki and colleagues in regards to ablomin, another snake venom toxin from the CRISP family that also blocks depolarization-induced smooth muscle contraction, we can postulate a similar mechanism might be in place for ophanin. Since ablomin only blocks contraction induced by depolarization, but not by caffeine, the effect of ablomin is likely to be caused by inhibition of voltage-gated ion channels. An activation of smooth muscle cells through caffeine activates ryanodine receptors of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, whereas an activation through high levels of extracellular potassium depolarizes the membrane (due to the change of the reversal potential for potassium towards more positive values) and would then activate voltage-gated calcium-ion channels leading to high levels of intracellular calcium ions. The intracellular calcium ion concentration correlates well with contraction force in the rat-tail artery. Thus, contraction following extracellular application of high-potassium solution depends on the influx of the extracellular calcium ions through voltage-gated calcium channels. Therefore, ablomin (and by extension ophanin) most likely targets voltage-gated calcium channels on smooth muscle.  Toxicity  The of the venom in mice is ~1.2 to 3.5 mg/kg via intravenous injection. The LD50 of ophanin is not yet known.

He anchored CBS's first network nightly television news broadcast from 1946‚Äì1962, which was later to be titled CBS Evening News. Early life and career A native of Oklahoma, Edwards grew up in Birmingham, Alabama. Edwards joined CBS Radio in 1942, eventually becoming anchor for the regular evening newscast The World Today as well as World News Today on Sunday afternoons. Edwards came to CBS, after stints as a newscaster and announcer at WSB in Atlanta, Georgia and WXYZ in Detroit, Michigan. In the mid-1940s, Edwards was host of the radio program Behind the Scenes at CBS. As anchorman of Douglas Edwards With the News (The CBS Evening News) In 1946, as CBS's top correspondents and commentators shunned the fledgling medium of television, Edwards was chosen to present regular CBS television news programs and to host CBS's television coverage of the 1948 Democratic and Republican conventions. The term \\"anchor\\" was not used until 1952, when CBS News chief Sig Mickelson used it to describe Walter Cronkite's role in the network's political convention coverage. At first, Edwards was eclipsed by John Cameron Swayze of NBC News's Camel News Caravan, but he eventually regained his ratings lead. By the mid-1950s, the nightly 15-minute newscast Douglas Edwards with the News was watched by nearly 30 million viewers. Among the events Edwards covered as a reporter in those years were the Miss America Pageant (five times), the attempted assassination of Harry S. Truman in November 1950, and the coronation of Elizabeth II in June 1953. He also received wide praise for his coverage, on both camera and radio, of the sinking of the SS Andrea Doria in July 1956. But by the end of the decade, viewership levels for the Edwards broadcast weakened severely as the Huntley-Brinkley Report began to attract a larger audience. Edwards' last newscast on the evening news was on April 13, 1962. On April 16, 1962, Edwards was replaced by Walter Cronkite, and the program became Walter Cronkite with the News. On September 2, 1963, the program was retitled CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite and became the first half-hour weeknight news broadcast of network television and was moved to 6:30 p.m. . For several years, both during his time as network anchor and after leaving the CBS anchor chair, Edwards anchored the local late news team on WCBS-TV, channel 2, the network's flagship television station in New York City. Return to CBS Radio Network Edwards subsequently moved back to CBS Radio, where he delivered the network's flagship evening newscasts The World Tonight for many years. Until his retirement on April 1, 1988, he maintained a daily midday role within CBS television news, anchoring a five-minute newsbreak known successively as CBS Afternoon News with Douglas Edwards (April 1962 ‚Äì Feb. 1968), The CBS Midday News with Douglas Edwards (Feb. 1968 ‚Äì April 20, 1979) at 11:55am Eastern time and The CBS Mid-Morning News with Douglas Edwards (April 23, 1979 ‚Äì May 30, 1980) at 10:55am Eastern.Douglas Edwards Chronology He also served, for a time, as a co-anchor of the CBS Morning News. His last radio newscast included a report of the death of singer Andy Gibb. Beginning June 2, 1980, Douglas Edwards anchored a daily one-minute- fourteen-second edition of Newsbreak at 11:57 a.m. Eastern Time. Edwards at home with his three children in 1955. From the left, Lynn, Donna and Bobby. In 1988, at the age of 70, Edwards retired from broadcasting work after 46 years with CBS. He appeared as himself in NPR's 1988 re-creation of Orson Welles' 1938 radio theater presentation of The War of the Worlds, directed by The Firesign Theater's David Ossman and starring Jason Robards and Steve Allen with various NPR announcers.Dennis McDougal, 50th-anniversary 'War Of The Worlds' To Air On NPR.

Many of his early CBS radio newscasts, including his World War II anchoring of World News Today, memorable broadcasts on D-Day and his Andrea Doria coverage, remain favorites of old-time radio collectors. Edwards was posthumously elected to the Radio Hall of Fame in 2006.

Early life Henley was born 25 February 1781 at Williamsburg, Virginia, the son of Leonard Henley and Elizabeth Dandridge (b. 1749) and the nephew of Martha Dandridge Custis Washington, the wife of George Washington. His younger brother was Robert Henley (1783‚Äì1828), also a naval officer. Career On 14 October 1799, at the age of 18, he was commissioned Midshipman by his uncle, George Washington. During offensive operations against Tripoli in 1804, he served in Gunboat No. 6, commanded by Lieutenant John Trippe. In a stirring attack 3 August against a larger enemy warship, the two officers with only nine other men boarded and took the enemy ship in hand- to-hand fighting, although outnumbered three to one. Midshipman Henley also took part in several other attacks in the months that followed as Commodore Edward Preble's squadron carried out aggressive and successful operations against the Tripolitan pirates that made them ready to end their aggression. Later in his career, during the War of 1812, Henley commanded schooner Carolina during the Battle of New Orleans. After the gallant delaying action by Lt. Thomas ap Catesby Jones at Lake Borgne, Carolina and other ships harassed the British with naval gunfire while protecting General Andrew Jackson's flank on the Mississippi River. Though his ship was destroyed, Henley contributed importantly to the large role the small squadron played in this last great victory of the war. On 5 March 1817, he rose to the rank of Captain. Early in 1819 Henley commanded U.S. man-of war Congress to China, the first U.S. warship to visit that country. He continued to serve with distinction until 23 May 1835 when he died on board Vandalia at Havana, Cuba. Personal life On March 31, 1816, he married Elizabeth Denison (1788‚Äì1838), the daughter of Gideon Denison (1752‚Äì1799), an attorney from Hartford, Connecticut. Together, they had three daughters: * Frances Henley (1818‚Äì1873), who married Rev. Edward Y.

He was the commanding officer of Company C, 1st Battalion, 20th Infantry of the 11th Brigade, Americal Division, the unit responsible for the My Lai Massacre of 16 March 1968. He was court martialed in 1971 for his role in that war crime, but acquitted the same year. Background Ernest Medina was born on August 27, 1936 into a Mexican-American family in Springer, New Mexico. After a variety of post‚Äìhigh school odd jobs, Medina joined the Army in 1956.

The Encyclopedia of the Vietnam War: A Political, Social, and Military History, 2nd Edition [4 volumes]: A Political, Social, and Military History ABC-CLIO, 20 May 2011 Court-martial According to the 1970 investigation by General William R. Peers, Medina: * \\"Planned, ordered, and supervised the execution by his company of an unlawful operation against inhabited hamlets in Son My village, which included the destruction of houses by burning, killing of livestock, and the destruction of crops and other foodstuffs, and the closing of wells; and impliedly directed the killing of any persons found there.\\" * \\"Possibly killed as many as three noncombatants in My Lai.\\" Medina was court-martialed in 1971 for willingly allowing his men to murder noncombatants. Medina denied all the charges and claimed that he never gave any orders to kill Vietnamese noncombatants. Medina's defense team, led by F. Lee Bailey, and a support staff that included Gary Myers, alleged that his men killed Vietnamese noncombatants under their own volition and not under Medina's orders. Medina also testified that he did not become aware that his troops were out of control at My Lai until the massacre was already well underway. Medina also strongly denied killing any Vietnamese noncombatant at My Lai, with the exception of a young woman whom two soldiers testified that they found hiding in a ditch. When she emerged with her hands up, Medina shot her because, he claimed, he thought she had a grenade. In fact, she was unarmed. The defense lawyers brought up many incidents during the Vietnam War of Viet Cong suspects and sympathizers faking surrender to use hidden pistols or grenades to harm or kill American military personnel. In August 1971, Medina was ultimately found not guilty of all charges. His jury deliberations lasted about 60 minutes. Despite his acquittal, the court martial and negative publicity brought Medina's military career to an end. He resigned his commission and left the Army shortly afterward. After the military After resigning from the Army, Medina went to work at an Enstrom Helicopter Corporation plant owned by F. Lee Bailey in Menominee, Michigan. Medina moved with his family to Marinette, Wisconsin. He worked in his family's real estate business: Medina, Inc. Realtor in Marinette, Wisconsin. He died on May 8, 2018, at the age of 81.

A pioneer of Russian and Estonian scientific mountaineering, he is best known for leading the first expedition to the summit of Mount Ararat in recorded history. Early career Born in Karlsruhe, in the Margraviate of Baden, Parrot was the son of Georg Friedrich Parrot, the first rector of the University of Dorpat (today the University of Tartu) and a close friend of Tsar Alexander I. He studied medicine and natural science at Dorpat and, in 1811, undertook an expedition to the Crimea and the Caucasus with Moritz von Engelhardt. There he used a barometer to measure the difference in sea level between the Caspian Sea and Black Sea. On his return he was appointed assistant doctor and, in 1815, surgeon in the Imperial Russian Army. In 1816 and 1817, he visited the Alps and Pyrenees. In 1821, he was professor of physiology and pathology, then in 1826 professor of physics at the University of Dorpat.Parrot, p. viii. Conquest of Ararat After the Russo-Persian War of 1826‚Äì28, Mount Ararat came under Russian control by the terms of the Treaty of Turkmenchay. Parrot felt that the conditions were now right to reach the peak of the mountain.Parrot, p. 14. With a team of science and medical students, Parrot left Dorpat in April 1829 and traveled south to Russian Transcaucasia and Armenia to climb Ararat. The project received full approval from Tsar Nicholas I, who provided the expedition with a military escort.Parrot, p. x. On the way to Russian Armenia, Parrot and his team split into two parts. Most of the team traveled to Mozdok, while Parrot, Maximilian Behaghel von Adlerskron, and the military escort Sch√ºtz traveled to the Manych River and the Kalmyk Steppe to conduct further research on the levels between the Black and Caspian Seas.Parrot, pp. 19-30. The two teams reunited at Mozdok and moved south, first to Georgia, then to the Armenian Oblast. An outbreak of plague in Russian Armenia and the vicinity of Erivan (Yerevan) delayed the expedition and the team visited the eastern Georgian province of Kakheti until it subsided.Parrot, pp. 52-66. They then traveled from Tiflis to Etchmaidzin, where Parrot met Khachatur Abovian, the future Armenian writer and national public figure. Parrot required a local guide and a translator for the expedition. The Armenian Catholicos Yeprem I assigned Abovian to these tasks.Parrot, p. 93. Accompanied by Abovian, Parrot and his team crossed the Arax River into the district of Surmali and headed to the Armenian village of Akhuri (modern Yenidoƒüan) situated on the northern slope of Ararat above sea level. Following the advice of Harutiun Alamdarian of Tiflis, they set up base camp at the Monastery of St. Hakob some higher, at an elevation of .Parrot, p. 103. Parrot and Abovian were among the last travelers to visit Akhuri and the monastery before a disastrous earthquake completely buried both in May 1840. Their first attempt to climb the mountain, using the northeast slope, failed as a result of lack of warm clothing. Six days later, on the advice of Stepan Khojiants, the village chief of Akhuri, the ascent was attempted from the northwest side. After reaching an elevation of , they turned back because they did not reach the summit before sundown. Accompanied by Abovian, two Russian soldiers, and two Armenian villagers, Parrot reached the summit on the third attempt at 3:15 p.m. on 9 October 1829.Parrot, p. 139. Abovian dug a hole in the ice and erected a wooden cross facing north.Parrot, pp. 141-142. He picked up a chunk of ice from the summit and carried it down with him in a bottle, considering the water holy. On 8 November, Parrot and Abovian climbed up Lesser Ararat.Parrot, pp. 183-184. Parrot was impressed with Abovian's thirst for knowledge and, after the expedition, arranged for a Russian state scholarship for Abovian to study at the University of Dorpat in 1830.Parrot, p. xxi. Later life In 1837, Parrot went to Tornio in the northern part of the Grand Duchy of Finland to observe oscillations of a pendulum and terrestrial magnetism. He invented a gasometer and a . In Livonia, he popularised the Catalan sundial, a small, cylindrical, pocket-sized instrument, approximately 8 cm in length and 1.5 cm in diameter. Parrot died in Dorpat in January 1841 and was buried at Raadi cemetery. He was survived by his daughter, Anna Magaretha Parrot, who married Conrad Jacob Strauch. Their descendants now reside in Australia. Today Parrot is regarded as a pioneer of Russian and Estonian mountaineering. In Armenia, he is celebrated for his role in the Ararat ascent and for his friendship with Abovian.

History =Etymology= The name \\"Morretes\\" is a geographical reference to the morros (Portuguese for \\"hills\\") that surround the city. Geography Morretes can be reached by road or by taking the historical Serra Verde Express train from Curitiba, or the touristic Paranagua-Curitiba Railway. Main sights =Overview= Saint Benedict's Church (Igreja de S√£o Benedito): There are a lot of attractions in Morretes. One of them is the Saint Benedict's Church. In 1760, the Brotherhood of Saint Benedict was founded in Morretes. Between 1865 and 1895 the chapel and the cemetery were built, not without some difficulty, as the region was going through a period of economic decadence. Its architecture is composed of the simplest edified scheme of the religious tradition: nave, bell-tower and main chapel. Inside there are many images from different times, including one of the patron saint, the \\"glorious St. Benedict\\". Old Bridge (Ponte Velha): A steel bridge over the Nhundiaquara river that gives access to restaurants like Madalozo. Pedestrians share space with cars, considering that there is just one lane. Touristic Train (Trem Tur√≠stico): Leaving Curitiba for Paranagu√°, it passes through and stopping in Morretes. The train, which travels around 74 km between both Paran√°'s cities, consists of 18 wagons divided in three classes: economic, touristic and executive. Marumbi Peak (Pico do Marumbi): Located in Paran√°‚Äôs sea mountain, the state park of Marumbi remains covered in natural Brazilian Atlantic forest vegetation. Activities such as waterfall bathing, trail walking and climbing are done in this place.

Right-wing authoritarians are people who have a high degree of willingness to submit to authorities they perceive as established and legitimate, who adhere to societal conventions and norms and who are hostile and punitive in their attitudes towards people who do not adhere to them. They value uniformity and are in favour of using group authority, including coercion, to achieve it. In the academic use of the term right-wing authoritarianism, the label right-wing does not automatically match the popular use of the label, with some academics allowing for either left- wing or right-wing politics to motivate people to submit.  History  The concept of right-wing authoritarianism was introduced in 1981 by Canadian- American psychologist Bob AltemeyerAltemeyer, Bob (1981). Right-wing Authoritarianism. University of Manitoba Press. as a refinement of the authoritarian personality theory originally pioneered by University of California, Berkeley researchers Theodor W. Adorno, Else Frenkel-Brunswik, Daniel Levinson and Nevitt Sanford.Adorno, T. W., Frenkel-Brunswik, E., Levinson, D. J., Sanford, R. N. (1950). The Authoritarian Personality. New York: Harper and Row. After extensive questionnaire research and statistical analysis, Altemeyer found that only three of the original nine hypothesized components of the model correlated together: authoritarian submission, authoritarian aggression and conventionalism. Researchers have traditionally assumed that there was just one kind of authoritarian personality, who could be either a follower or a leader. The discovery that followers and leaders are usually different types of authoritarians is based on research done by Sam McFarland.Altemeyer, Bob (1998). \\"The other 'authoritarian personality'\\". In M. Zanna (Ed.) Advances in Experimental Social Psychology. 30 (pp. 47‚Äì92). San Diego: Academic Press. Altemeyer describes another scale called \\"Social Dominance\\" which measures how domineering a person is. Altemeyer calls people who score highly on both his \\"Right-Wing Authoritarian\\" and \\"Social Dominance\\" scales as \\"Double Highs\\".  Assessment  Right-wing authoritarianism is measured by the RWA scale which uses a Likert scale response. The first scored item on the scale states: \\"Our country desperately needs a mighty leader who will do what has to be done to destroy the radical new ways and sinfulness that are ruining us\\". People who strongly agree with this are showing a tendency toward authoritarian submission (\\"Our country desperately needs a mighty leader\\"), authoritarian aggression (\\"who will do what has to be done to destroy\\") and conventionalism (\\"the radical new ways and sinfulness that are ruining us\\").Altemeyer, Bob (2007). The Authoritarians. University of Manitoba. p. 15. http://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~altemey/ Psychometrically, the RWA scale was a significant improvement over the F-scale which was the original measure of the authoritarian personality. The F-scale was worded so that agreement always indicated an authoritarian response, thus leaving it susceptible to the acquiescence response bias. The RWA scale is balanced to have an equal number of pro and anti authoritarian statements. The RWA scale also has excellent internal reliability, with coefficient alpha typically measuring between 0.85 and 0.94. The RWA scale has been modified over the years as many of the items lost their social significance as society changed. The current version is 22 items long.Altemeyer (2007). The Authoritarians. University of Manitoba. pp. 11‚Äì12 in Chapter 1 \\"Who Are the Authoritarian Followers?\\" http://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~altemey/ Although Altemeyer has continually updated the scale, researchers in different domains have tended to lock-in on particular versions. In the social psychology of religion, the 1992 version of the scale is still commonly used. In addition, the length of the earlier versions (30 items) led many researchers to develop shorter versions of the scale. Some of those are published, but many researchers simply select a subset of items to use in their research, a practice that Altemeyer strongly criticizes.Altemeyer, Bob (2007). The Authoritarians. University of Manitoba. http://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~altemey/ The uni-dimensionality of the scale has also been challenged recently. Florian Funke showed that it is possible to extract the three underlying dimensions of RWA if the double- and triple- barreled nature of the items is removed. Given the possibility of underlying dimensions emerging from the scale, it is then the case that the scale is no longer balanced since all the items primarily capturing authoritarian aggression are pro-trait worded (higher scores mean more authoritarianism) and all the items primarily measuring conventionalism are con-trait worded (higher scores mean less authoritarianism). Work by Winnifred R. Louis, Kenneth I. Mavor and Chris G. Sibley recently demonstrated that the existence of two or three factors in the RWA scale reflects real differences in these dimensions rather than acquiescence response bias.  Attitudes  Right-wing authoritarians want society and social interactions structured in ways that increase uniformity and minimize diversity. In order to achieve that, they tend to be in favour of social control, coercion and the use of group authority to place constraints on the behaviours of people such as political dissidents and immigrants. These constraints might include restrictions on immigration, limits on free speech and association and laws regulating moral behaviour. It is the willingness to support or take action that leads to increased social uniformity that makes right-wing authoritarianism more than just a personal distaste for difference. Right-wing authoritarianism is characterized by obedience to authority, moral absolutism and punitiveness towards dissidents and deviants. In parenting, right-wing authoritarians value children's obedience, neatness and good manners. In 2013, Boris Bizumic and John Duckitt wrote that RWA measures the support \\"for the subordination of individual freedom and autonomy to the collective and its authority\\". Their studies show that it can be split into three distinct factors: * Authoritarianism: tough attitude towards violations of social rules, norms and laws. * Conservatism: favoring obedient and respectful support for societal authorities. * Traditionalism: favoring traditional, religious social norms and values. The names of these three components of RWA resemble their standard use but actually correspond to the three statistical factors. Right-wing authoritarianism was previously split differently into three attitudinal and behavioral clusters which correlate together:Altemeyer, B. (1988). Enemies of freedom. Winnipeg: University of Manitoba PressAltemeyer, B. (1996). The authoritarian specter. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. # Authoritarian submission ‚Äî a high degree of submissiveness to the authorities who are perceived to be established and legitimate in the society in which one lives. # Authoritarian aggression ‚Äî a general aggressiveness directed against deviants, outgroups and other people that are perceived to be targets according to established authorities. # Conventionalism ‚Äî a high degree of adherence to the traditions and social norms that are perceived to be endorsed by society and its established authorities and a belief that others in one's society should also be required to adhere to these norms.Altemeyer, Bob (2006). The Authoritarians, p. 27. http://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~altemey/ The terminology of authoritarianism, authoritarian personality and right-wing authoritarianism tend to be used interchangeably by psychologists, although inclusion of the term personality may indicate a psychodynamic interpretation consistent with the original formulation of the theory.  Left and right  The phrase right-wing in right-wing authoritarianism does not necessarily refer to someone's specific political beliefs, but to his general preference vis-√†-vis social equality and hierarchy. The classic definition of left-wing describes somebody who believes in social equality and right-wing describes somebody who believes in social hierarchy. Altemeyer's personal distinction is that a right-wing authoritarian submits to the established authorities in society whereas left-wing authoritarians submit to authorities who want to overthrow the establishment. In his books, Altemeyer writes that right-wing authoritarians are drawn to domineering leaders, who by nature do not believe in equality and thus have something in common. Milton Rokeach's dogmatism scale was an early attempt to measure pure authoritarianism, whether left-wing or right-wing. The scale was carefully designed to measure closed-mindedness without regard to ideology. Nevertheless, researchers found that it correlated with British conservatism. In a similar line of research, Philip Tetlock found that right-wing beliefs are associated with less integrative complexity than left-wing beliefs. People with moderate liberal attitudes had the highest integrative complexity in their cognitions. There have been a number of other attempts to identify \\"left-wing authoritarians\\" in the United States and Canada. These would be people who submit to leftist authorities, are highly conventional to liberal viewpoints and are aggressive to people who oppose left-wing ideology. These attempts have failed because measures of authoritarianism always correlate at least slightly with the right. However, left-wing authoritarians were found in Eastern Europe.de Regt, S, Mortelmans, D, Smits, T (2011). Left-wing authoritarianism is not a myth, but worrisome reality. Evidence from 13 Eastern European countries. In Communist and Post- Communist Studies. Volume 44. Issue 4. December 2011. pp. 299‚Äì308. There are certainly extremists across the political spectrum, but most psychologists now believe that authoritarianism is a predominantly right-wing phenomenon.Stone, W. F., & Smith, L. D. (1993). Authoritarianism: Left and right. In W. F. Stone, G. Lederer, & R. Christie (Eds.). Strengths and weaknesses: The authoritarian personality today. New York: Springer-Verlag. Although authoritarians in North America generally support conservative political parties, this finding must be considered in a historical and cultural context. During the Cold War, authoritarians in the United States were usually anti- communist whereas in the Soviet Union authoritarians generally supported the Soviet Communist Party and were opposed to capitalism.McFarland, S., Ageyev, V., & Abalakina, M. (1993). The authoritarian personality in the United States and the former Soviet Union: Comparative studies. In W. F. Stone, G. Lederer, & R. Christie (Eds.). Strengths and weaknesses: The authoritarian personality today. New York: Springer-Verlag. Authoritarians thus generally favor the established ways and oppose social and political change, hence even politics usually labeled as left-wing or right-wing is not descriptive. While communism in the Soviet Union is seen as leftist, it still inspired the same responses. Furthermore, recent research indicates that political progressives can exhibit the qualities of authoritarianism when they are asked about conservative Christians. A 2017 study found evidence that was suggestive of the existence of left-wing authoritarians and a 2015 study suggested that support for political correctness (defined as censoring views that offend or disadvantage a particular group in society) could be a manifestation of left-wing authoritarianism.Brophy, Christine. \\"Political correctness: social-fiscal liberalism and left-wing authoritarianism.\\" PhD diss., 2015. A 2012 study criticised research into authoritarianism, arguing that there had been biased and inadequate research into left-wing authoritarianism.Lindgren, James. \\"The centrist authoritarian.\\" Available at SSRN 2029435 (2012), doi:10.2139/ssrn.2029435 A 2020 paper argued there was increasing evidence of existence of left-wing authoritarianism.Conway III, Lucian Gideon, Alivia Zubrod, and Linus Chan. \\"The Paradox of the Tribal Equalitarian.\\" (2020): 48-52.Costello, Thomas H., Shauna Bowes, Sean T. Stevens, Irwin Waldman, and Scott O. Lilienfeld. \\"Clarifying the Structure and Nature of Left-Wing Authoritarianism.\\" (2020). According to Karen Stenner, an Australian professor who specializes in authoritarianism, authoritarianism is different from conservatism because authoritarianism reflects aversion to difference across space (i.e. diversity of people and beliefs at a given moment) while conservatism reflects aversion to difference over time (i.e. change). Stenner argues that conservatives will embrace racial diversity, civil liberties and moral freedom to the extent they are already institutionalized authoritatively-supported traditions and are therefore supportive of social stability. Conservatives tend to be drawn to authoritarianism when public opinion is fractious and there is a loss of confidence in public institutions, but in general they value stability and certainty over increased uniformity. However, Stenner says that authoritarians also want difference restricted even when so doing would require significant social change and instability.  Research  According to research by Altemeyer, right-wing authoritarians tend to exhibit cognitive errors and symptoms of faulty reasoning. Specifically, they are more likely to make incorrect inferences from evidence and to hold contradictory ideas that result from compartmentalized thinking. They are also more likely to uncritically accept insufficient evidence that supports their beliefs and they are less likely to acknowledge their own limitations. Whether right-wing authoritarians are less intelligent than average is disputed, with Stenner arguing that variables such as high verbal ability (indicative of high cognitive capacity) have a very substantial ameliorative effect in diminishing authoritarian tendencies. However, one study suggested the apparent negative relationship between cognition and RWA could be partially explained by methodological issues.Burger, Axel M., Stefan Pfattheicher, and Melissa Jauch. \\"The role of motivation in the association of political ideology with cognitive performance.\\" Cognition 195 (2020): 104124. Measured against other factors of personality, authoritarians generally score lower on openness to experience and slightly higher on conscientiousness. Altemeyer suggested that authoritarian politicians are more likely to be in the Conservative or Reform party in Canada, or the Republican Party in the United States. They generally have a conservative economic philosophy, are highly nationalistic, oppose abortion, support capital punishment, oppose gun control legislation and do not value social equality. The RWA scale reliably correlates with political party affiliation, reactions to Watergate, pro-capitalist attitudes, religious orthodoxy and acceptance of covert governmental activities such as illegal wiretaps. Authoritarians are generally more favorable to punishment and control than personal freedom and diversity. They are more willing to suspend constitutional guarantees of liberty such as the Bill of Rights. They are more likely to advocate strict, punitive sentences for criminals and report that punishing such people is satisfying for them. They tend to be ethnocentric and prejudiced against racial and ethnic minorities and homosexuals. However, Stenner argues that authoritarians will support programs intended to increase opportunities for minority groups, such as affirmative action, if they believe such programs will lead to greater societal uniformity. In roleplaying situations, authoritarians tend to seek dominance over others by being competitive and destructive instead of cooperative. In a study by Altemeyer, 68 authoritarians played a three-hour simulation of the Earth's future entitled the Global Change Game. Unlike a comparison game played by individuals with low RWA scores which resulted in world peace and widespread international cooperation, the simulation by authoritarians became highly militarized and eventually entered the stage of nuclear war. By the end of the high RWA game, the entire population of the earth was declared dead. The vast majority of research on right-wing authoritarianism has been done in the United States and Canada. However, a 2003 cross-cultural study examined the relation between authoritarianism and individualism‚Äìcollectivism in samples (1,080) from Bulgaria, Canada, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, Poland and the United States. Both at the individual level and the societal level, authoritarianism was correlated with vertical individualism or dominance seeking and vertical or hierarchical collectivism which is the tendency to submit to the demands of one's ingroup. A study done on both Israeli and Palestinian students in Israel found that RWA scores of right-wing party supporters were significantly higher than those of left-wing party supporters and scores of secular subjects were lowest. Right-wing authoritarianism has been found to correlate only slightly with social dominance orientation (SDO). The two measures can be thought of as two sides of the same coin as RWA provides submissive followers and SDO provides power-seeking leaders. = Relationship to personality traits = Research comparing RWA with the Big Five personality traits has found that RWA is positively correlated with conscientiousness (r = 0.15) and negatively correlated with openness to experience (r = ‚àí0.36). SDO has a somewhat different pattern of correlations with the Big Five, as it is also associated with low openness to experience (r = ‚àí0.16), but is not significantly correlated with conscientiousness (r = ‚àí0.05) and instead has a negative correlation with agreeableness (r = ‚àí0.29). Low openness to experience and high conscientiousness have been found to be predictive of social conformity. People low in openness to experience tend to prefer clear, unambiguous moral rules and are more likely to support the existing social order insofar as it provides clear guidance about social norms for behavior and how the world should be. People low in openness to experience are also more sensitive to threats (both real and symbolic) to the social order and hence tend to view outgroups who deviate from traditional social norms and values as a threat to ingroup norms and values. Conscientiousness is associated with a preference for order, structure and security, hence this might explain the connection with RWA.  Criticism and development  A recent refinement to this body of research was presented in Karen Stenner's 2005 book, The Authoritarian Dynamic. Stenner argues that RWA is best understood as expressing a dynamic response to external threat, not a static disposition based only on the traits of submission, aggression and conventionalism. Stenner is critical of Altemeyer's social learning interpretation and argues that it cannot account for how levels of authoritarianism fluctuate with social conditions. She argues that the RWA Scale can be viewed as a measure of expressed authoritarianism, but that other measures are needed to assess authoritarian predispositions which interact with threatening circumstances to produce the authoritarian response.Stenner, K. (2005). The Authoritarian Dynamic. Cambridge University Press. Recent criticism has also come as a result of treating RWA as uni-dimensional even in contexts where it makes no sense to do so. This include RWA being used in regression analyses with fundamentalism as another predictor and attitudes to homosexuality and racism as the outcomes. This research seemed to show that fundamentalism would be associated with reduced racism once the authoritarian component was removed and this was summarized in a recent review of the field. However, since the RWA scale has items that also measure fundamentalist religiosity and attitudes to homosexuality, this undermines the interpretation of such analyses. Even worse is the possibility that the unrecognised dimensionality in RWA can cause a statistical artifact to arise in such regressions which can reduce or even reverse some of the relationships. Mavor and colleagues have argued that this artifact eliminates or even reverses any apparent tendency for fundamentalism to reduce racism once RWA is controlled. The implication is that in some domains such as the social psychology of religion it is not only preferable to think of RWA as consisting of at least two components, but it is essential in order to avoid statistical errors and incorrect conclusions. Several options currently exist for scales that acknowledge at least the two main underlying components in the scale (aggression/submission and conventionalism). Altemeyer's research on authoritarianism has been challenged by psychologist John J. Ray, who questions the sampling methods used and the ability of the RWA Scale to predict authoritarian behavior and provides evidence that the RWA Scale measures conservatism rather than \\"directiveness\\", a construct that John J. Ray invented and that he relates to authoritarianism. However, Ray's approach is a minority position among researchersStone, W. F., Lederer, G., & Christie, R. (1993). Strength and Weakness: The Authoritarian Personality Today. New York: Springer-Verlag. and other psychologists have found that both the RWA scale and the original F-scale are good predictors of both attitudes and behavior. In 2012, the American Journal of Political Science published an article discussing the correlation between conservatism and psychoticism which they associated with authoritarianism, among other traits. In 2015, they released an erratum showing mixed correlations. In 2017, the new Regality Theory suggested a reinterpretation of RWA in the light of evolutionary psychology. Regality theory agrees that authoritarianism is a dynamic response to external threats, but rather than seeing it as a psychological aberration, regality theory posits that authoritarianism is an evolved response to perceived collective danger. The tendency to support a strong leader when faced with common existential threats has contributed to Darwinian fitness in human prehistory because it helped solve the collective action problem in war and suppress free riders. It is argued that regality theory adds a deeper level of analysis to our understanding of authoritarianism and avoids the political bias that the research in the authoritarian personality and RWA is often criticized for. In 2019, Ronald Inglehart combined RWA with his theory of postmaterialism, arguing that both reflected the tendency of insecure environments to produce individuals whose worldview values conformism over self-expression. Although some earlier scholars had claimed that a comparable construct of left-wing authoritarinism (LWA) on the political left does not exist and compared the search for LWA to trying to find the Loch Ness monster, more recent work suggests the possibility that LWA does exist and that it predicts similar outcomes as RWA. This has spurred debate about whether liberals might be similarly authoritarian as conservatives.

It is one of six comprehensive public high school campuses in Oakland. Oakland Tech's attendance jurisdiction includes several neighborhoods, including Oakland Chinatown, Rockridge, North Oakland, and Temescal. Tech received the maximum 6-year accreditation from the Western Association of Schools and Colleges in 2009.School website announcement History Oakland Tech's main building was built in 1914 and resembles the main science building of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. During the 1970s, when many California schools were being demolished and rebuilt for earthquake safety, Tech's main building was determined to be too historic to tear down. Instead, it was gutted and rebuilt on the inside, while its historic exterior was preserved. The school was declared the 99thOakland California Landmarks historic landmark by the city of Oakland on July 23, 1985.Oakland Landmarks (pdf) University High School, where Tech moved temporarily during retrofitting in the 1970s While Tech was closed for earthquake retrofitting in the 1970s, the school was displaced to 5714 Martin Luther King Jr. Way (formerly Grove Street). This location is sometimes erroneously referred to \\"Old Tech\\" but was actually the campus of the now defunct University High School (1923-1948). That campus had then served as Merritt College from 1954 to 1966 and is considered the birthplace of the Black Panthers. In 1977 a group of students from a U.S. Government class at Tech launched a drive to create a California state holiday in honor of Martin Luther King, Jr.. The idea was not new - about a dozen states already had such holidays, and it had been proposed unsuccessfully at the national level - but it was still controversial. The students formed themselves into a group called \\"The Apollos\\" and lobbied for the holiday for four years; it was finally passed by the legislature and signed by the governor in 1981. In 2008 two students at other Oakland high schools heard about the Apollos and made an award-winning short documentary film about their successful quest. Academies Students at Oakland Technical High School have the option of enrolling in one of the school's academies, which operate as small subsets of the school. Students take one class within their academies and spend the rest of the day in normal classes. Academies at Tech include Computer Academy, Health Academy, Engineering Academy, Race Policy and Law (RPL) Academy, and Fashion, Arts, and Design (FADA) Academy. The Engineering Academy focuses on mechanical engineering. Starting in 10th grade, the students in this academy study engineering, physics (focused on mechanics), drafting, architecture, etc. Paideia is an advanced History and English program founded by Mary Ann Wolfe, a political science and government teacher who worked at Oakland Tech for over thirty years. In the sophomore year, students have the option to take English 2 Paideia and World Cultures. In 11th grade, students have the option to enroll in AP or HP English and US History. In 12th grade, students who are recommended may take the advanced senior block, consisting of AP Government, AP Literature, and HP Comparative Government, in which they analyze works of art and compare them to the government. In senior year, students, according to grades, are also able to take AP Government and AP English 4. Students can be jointly enrolled in Paideia within select academies in 10th grade and any academy in 11th and 12th grades. In 2008, over half of the advanced senior block was accepted to the prestigious UC Berkeley.Oakland Technical High School - Paideia Program Students regularly score 4s or 5s for AP classes taken in the Paideia program. The Race, Policy, and Law academy began in the 2017-18 academic year.  School profile  Oakland Technical High School is a Title I school and approximately 53% of the student body qualifies for free or reduced price lunches. The total school enrollment in 2016-17 was 2,037 students. Tech is a highly diverse school, with students comprising a range of racial, ethnic, and socio-economic backgrounds. In 2016-17, the student body was 32% African American, 24% white, 22% Asian, 16% Latino/Hispanic, 2% Pacific Islander, and 4% other.

Structure =Origin= The flexor carpi ulnaris has two heads; a humeral head and ulnar head. The humeral head originates from the medial epicondyle of the humerus via the common flexor tendon. The ulnar head originates from the medial margin of the olecranon of the ulnar and the upper two-thirds of the dorsal border of the ulnar by an aponeurosis. Between the two heads passes the ulnar nerve and ulnar artery. =Insertion= The flexor carpi ulnaris inserts onto the pisiform, hook of the hamate (via the pisohamate ligament) and the anterior surface of the base of the fifth metacarpal (via the pisometacarpal ligament). =Action= The flexor carpi ulnaris flexes and adducts at the wrist joint. =Innervation= The flexor carpi ulnaris is innervated by the ulnar nerve. The corresponding spinal nerves are C8 and T1. =Tendon= The tendon of flexor carpi ulnaris can be seen on the anterior surface of the distal forearm. On a person's distal forearm, just before the wrist, there are either two or three tendons. The tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris is the most medial (closest to the little finger) of these. The most lateral one is the tendon of flexor carpi radialis muscle, and the middle one, not always present, is the tendon of palmaris longus. Function The muscle, like all flexors of the forearm, can be strengthened by exercises that resist its flexion. A wrist roller can be used and wrist curls with dumbbells can also be performed. These exercises are used to prevent injury to the ulnar collateral ligament of elbow joint. Variability The muscle can be doubled as accessory flexor carpi ulnaris muscle and is often accompanied by concomitant variants. Clinical significance Ulnar entrapment by the aponeurosis of the two heads of the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle may cause cubital tunnel syndrome.

It is widely grown as an ornamental tree, almost always as a pendulous (or \\"weeping\\") cultivar, and is called by various common names, including willow- leaved pear, weeping pear, and similar. The tree is deciduous and of comparatively small stature, rarely reaching 10‚Äì12 meters in height. The crown is rounded. It has pendulous, silvery foliage, superficially similar to a weeping willow. The flowers are large and pure white highlighted with black- tipped stamens although the buds are tipped with red. The small green fruits are inedible, being hard and astringent. This tree is cultivated widely in gardens and landscapes. It grows well on infertile sandy soils due to its spreading root system. The trees flower in the spring, but during the rest of the year can be trimmed back and shaped almost like topiary. This species of tree is very susceptible to fireblight, a bacterial pathogen. Pyrus salicifolia may also be confused with Pyrus nivalis which is generally taller and hardly pendulous or with Pyrus elaeagnifolia which has broader entire leaves and longer petioles.

Scourge killed/dispersed him to protect the town of Burton Canyon, Colorado.Thunderbolts #47 Atlas' ionic form later begins haunting Riordan in much the same way Wonder Man's ionic form had haunted the Scarlet Witch.Thunderbolts #51 Later Atlas would possess Dallas and empower her with the ionic energy.Thunderbolts #56-74 Together they rejoin the other founding Thunderbolt members in defeating Graviton and are shunted to Counter Earth.Thunderbolts #58, 60 During the JLA/Avengers storyline Erik, as Goliath, is seen among the enthralled villains defending Krona's stronghold, along with other members of the Masters of Evil.JLA/Avengers #4 He is shown being struck by Plastic Man, who has turned into a giant ball. When they are separated upon returning from Counter Earth, Dallas takes the ionic energy, leaving Josten powerless, a situation which lasts until Fixer gives him a new dose of Pym particles.Thunderbolts #74-75 This lasts until the end of the Avengers/Thunderbolts limited series, when Erik asks Henry Pym to remove the particles from his system.Avengers/Thunderbolts #6 However, he regains the ability to change his size by reclaiming the ionic energy from Dallas, leaving her a paraplegic again.New Thunderbolts #1 Altered again by the Wellspring, during a battle against the Grandmaster in which he has to surrender his powers temporarily to Zemo, he is left stuck in a giant form, too heavy even to move and communicate. However he is able to send back some ionic energy to Dallas, restoring her legs.Thunderbolts #108-109 Atlas is restored to normal size by scientists at Camp Hammond, and registers Atlas as part of the Initiative. Though registered, Atlas's size changing powers are considered too unreliable to be placed on an Initiative team. However, Nighthawk hires him along with other questionable heroes after his Defenders team is decommissioned by S.H.I.E.L.D.Last Defenders #3 Atlas was later recruited by Wonder Man (whose ionic energy leaking problem was affecting his judgement) to join his Revengers.New Avengers Annual Vol. 2 #1 Atlas's reason for joining the Revengers was that his numerous requests to join the Initiative were denied.Avengers Annual Vol. 4 #1 During the Avengers: Standoff! storyline, Atlas was an inmate of Pleasant Hill, a gated community established by S.H.I.E.L.D. Using the Kobik project, S.H.I.E.L.D. transformed Atlas into an unnamed Pleasant Hill mailman.Avengers Standoff: Assault on Pleasant Hill Alpha #1 Following the Pleasant Hill incident, Atlas joined up with Winter Soldier's incarnation of the Thunderbolts with the goal to prevent S.H.I.E.L.D. from continuing the Kobik Project.Thunderbolts Vol. 3 #1 During the Monsters Unleashed storyline, Atlas was seen fighting the Leviathon Tide monsters in Washington, D.C.Monsters Unleashed Vol. 2 #2 Atlas was later approached by Baron Helmut Zemo and his third incarnation of the Masters of Evil in order to recruit him.

During the fight against the Masters of Evil, Atlas and the Thunderbolts were defeated and captured.Thunderbolts Vol. 3 #10 During the \\"Opening Salvo\\" part of the Secret Empire storyline, Atlas, Moonstone, and Fixer eventually defect to the Masters of Evil after Baron Helmut Zemo uses Kobik's abilities to send Winter Soldier back in time. After Kobik shattered, Atlas assisted in searching for her fragments in order for Baron Zemo to put her back together.Thunderbolts Vol. 3 #12 When the Masters of Evil become part of Hydra's Army of Evil, Atlas took part in the attack on Manhattan in retaliation for what happened at Pleasant Hill.Secret Empire #0. Marvel Comics. Powers and abilities Similarly to Wonder Man and Count Nefaria, Erik Josten is a virtually indestructible immortal made of \\"ionic energy\\", as a result of the application of mutagenic processes developed by Heinrich Zemo.Avengers Vol 1 #21 (1965) He possesses incredible superhuman dynamism regarding strength, coordination, stamina and durability. He is practically invulnerable even at normal size.Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z #1 (Mar, 2008) After losing his ionic powers to Nefaria,Avengers Vol 1 #164-165 (1977) Josten would gain new abilities as a result of Dr. Karl Malus' experimentations, additionally gaining the power to increase his size and mass at will.Iron Man Annual Vol 1 #7 (1984) Originally he was limited to convert his normal height to his maximum , but he later learned to increase this limit when he was angry.Thunderbolts #1 Josten psionically draws the additional mass from an extra-dimensional source of \\"Cosmos\\", to which it returns as he decreases in size. At his maximum height he is capable of greatly outmatching Namor,New Thunderbolts\\" #04 (Mar. 2005) or even defeating Hyperion with a single attack.New Thunderbolts\\" #16 (Feb. 2006) His durability also increases with his height, and if his physical state were ever to be disrupted in any way, he would eventually physically reincorporate himself even from death if need be, giving him an expedient regenerative ability capable of reconstructing his body given enough time.Thunderbolts #45 Once, when helping renegade Kosmossians, he was able to absorb the majority of the mass from their prison, allowing them to escape. His obsession with size and power made him their prisoner as they continually filled him with the mass from their prison. Encased in an extra dimension, and hundreds of miles tall, he was saved by the 100-foot Giant Man (Henry Pym) and was returned to normal size and in a coma. In a similar vein he could funnel Pym Particle energies through himself from Kosmos in order to cause all manner of mass shifting induction that affected everyone and everything differently (such as giving Clint Barton his size-shifting abilities without Pym Particle intake).Marvel Double Feature...The Avengers/Giant-Man #379-382 (1994-1995) After Nefaria had consolidated his ionic energy to be predominant, Eric gained access to the fullest effect of his latent abilities.Thunderbolts #43 (Oct, 2000) As his ionic force meshes with the growth particles in his system; Goliath also has access to certain abilities Simon and Nefaria do not, such as extra- dimensional breech generation, which can be turned against him if he grows too large or has his energy polarity shifted.Avengers Vol 1 #382 (1995)Wonder Man Vol 1 #25 (1993) Becoming pure ionic energy much like the Nefaria and Wonder Man; making him powerful enough to stalemate two superhero teams.Avengers Vol 3 #32 (Oct, 2000) Able to fly by force of will, maintain increased physicals while at normal height, lacking the need for physical sustenance and absorb, transfer or manipulate ionic energy at will.Thunderbolts #44 (Nov, 2000) After his energy form became unstable and he exploded, Atlas started using the crippled Dallas Riorden as an anchor in order to manifest in the living world,Thunderbolts #42-44 giving her some of his Atlas powers and an energy form to match. Powers beyond increased physical ability such as his size shifting, energy manipulation and flight.Thunderbolts Vol 1 74 Even while separated from her, Eric could still bestow on Riorden some of his ionic energy, giving her both mobility and slightly enhanced conditioning back.Avengers/Thunderbolts #2-4 Josten is a good hand-to-hand combatant, having received combat training in armed and unarmed offense when working both in the military and as a mercenary. He's an able pilot and aviation specialist, capable of flying most any kind of aerodynamic vehicle. And while preferring to serve rather than lead, Mr. Josten also excels as a combat strategist while on the field. Family Erik's parents were farmers who lost their farm as a result of Erik's crimes as Power Man making the news.Thunderbolts #16 No one in their town would do business with the Jostens. His older brother Carl became an alcoholic and a gambling addict. His younger sister Lindy was killed when she was 10 years old and Erik was 17. She tried to follow him and his friends on her bike and was eventually hit by a car.Thunderbolts #10 His younger brother Conrad was so ashamed of Erik that he ran away and changed his name. Carl was murdered by a loanshark he owed money to. Conrad was inducted into the Redeemers and took Erik's previous codename Smuggler and was given a suit that allowed him to access the darkforce dimension.Thunderbolts 48 Conrad and the majority of the Redeemers were killed by the villain Graviton.Thunderbolts #56 Years later Zemo coerced Erik into betraying the Thunderbolts by offering to save Conrad from the darkforce dimension.Thunderbolts #100 Conrad briefly serves a member of the Thunderbolts alongside Erik and they made peace with their past.Thunderbolts #101 Personality As a Thunderbolt Erik was the least assertive member despite being the physically strongest one on the team. He frequently runs from his problems. He ran away from home after his sister's death and joined the military, then he went AWOL and became a smuggler and later a mercenary working for Heinrich Zemo.Thunderbolts #18 It was at this time he first met Heinrich's son Helmut.Thunderbolts #-1: Distant Rumblings Erik betrays Baron Helmut Zemo when he tries to kill Jolt but later saves him from death after the Baron suffers a severe beating by Moonstone.Thunderbolts #12 Erik routinely demurrs to the leadership of others on his team as he does not like making decisions because, as he puts it, he's \\"just a grunt.\\"Thunderbolts #20 Erik usually is the first to empathize with a foe and often places his relationships with friends and family over doing the right thing. Instances of this include: when he knew Man Killer was pretending to be a bartender while she was lying low from the law;Thunderbolts #27 not telling the team about saving Zemo; refusing to tell the Thunderbolts about Techno being in Burton Canyon;Thunderbolts #30 betraying his team to save his brother; and \\"killing\\" Genis to prevent him from disrupting Abe and Melissa's relationship because he feared it would screw up Abe's reconstitution of the Thunderbolts.

The Ernest N. Morial Convention Center is in New Orleans, Louisiana, United States. The lower end of building one is located upriver from Canal Street on the banks of the Mississippi River. It is named after former Mayor of New Orleans Ernest Nathan Morial. As of 2006, it has about 1.1 million square feet (102,000 m¬≤) of exhibit space, covering almost 11 blocks, and over 3 million square feet (280,000 m¬≤) of total space. The front of the main building is 1 kilometer long. History The center was planned starting in 1978. It is the 5th-largest facility of its kind in the United States, and as of early 2005 was the second-busiest. The first portion of the building was constructed as part of the 1984 Louisiana World Exposition; a series of additions in subsequent decades expanded the center further upriver. The complex was named in honor of Ernest N. Morial, the city's first African American mayor, in 1992. In 2008, the Center was renamed the New Orleans Morial Convention Center in order to emphasize its New Orleans location. The New Orleans Morial Convention Center, and in the background, the Crescent City Connection bridge over the Mississippi River.From August 26 through 27, 2005, Wheel of Fortune came to tape three weeks of shows at the convention center. But as Hurricane Katrina threatened the area, they canceled the last week in order to evacuate. In the aftermath of Katrina, the Convention Center was the second most important shelter for survivors, after the Louisiana Superdome. After serving as a temporary medical clinic for some time, the structure again began welcoming conventions in early 2006, including that of the American Library Association. = Hurricane Katrina = After Hurricane Katrina passed through the city in 2005, thousands of evacuees were directed to the Convention Center as an unofficial evacuation center. In the confusion following the disaster, people escaping from flooded neighborhoods were directed to the Convention Center by police and word of mouth, with the expectation that there would be provisions, aid, and evacuation buses there. However no such resources were there for several days. Thousands gathered at the complex in difficult conditions with no power, no water, no food, no medical supplies, no proper sanitation, and no public order, only minimal occasional law enforcement presence within the center, resulting in incidents of crime and gang violence. There were reports of multiple deaths at the center, from causes including violence, dehydration, and lack of medication for the ill. The poor conditions and lack of prompt government response at the convention center were revealed to the nation on several TV news networks including CNN and Fox. Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff falsely claimed to be unaware of any problem with conditions even after the networks had been broadcasting images and live reports from the Convention Center. The Morial Convention Center was declared evacuated on September 4. = Post- Katrina = The Convention Center finished a complete renovation of the facility in November 2006. A previously scheduled expansion project, which would add of exhibition space in a new building, has been temporarily delayed. The 2006 renovations included the creation of the 4,032-seat New Orleans Theater, a concert hall used primarily for concerts, Broadway stage shows, and other special events.

Adsorption, sometimes is referred to solid sorption. It is very similar to absorption refrigeration (note that the second letter is different). The difference is that in adsorption refrigeration, the refrigerant or adsorbate vapour molecules adsorb onto the surface of a solid instead of dissolving into a liquid. In adsorption system, an adsorber adsorbs the refrigerant vapour into a solid, while in absorption system, an absorber absorbs the refrigerant vapour into a liquid. Adsoprtion refrigeration also includes a generation process where refrigerant vapour molecules desorbing from the solid. The characteristics of the adsorbate/refrigerant pair is crucial in determining the system performance of a adsorption refrigeration system. The typical system performance indicators for an adsorption refrigeration system are coefficient of performance and specific cooling effect. The refrigerants used in adsorption systems are ammonia, water, or methanol, etc, which experiences phase changes between vapor state and liquid state - the same as in vapor compression refrigeration; while the adsorbent is a solid, such as silicone gel, activated carbon, zeolite, For example, an adsorption refrigeration device with active carbon fiber being a adsorbent and ammonia being refrigerant was designed. The reasons adsorption refrigeration technology has been extensively researched in recent 30 years lie in that the operation of an adsorption refrigeration system is often noiseless, non-corrosive and environment friendly. The heat source for adsorption refrigeration can be: Fossil fuel, Bio fuel, Waste heat, Solar thermal energy. Adsorption refrigerators are available in the marketplace and are mainly used to produce chilled water from waste heat. Gas adsorption heat pumps are not currently available in the UK, but are just being introduced in Europe as small water or ground source packaged units for providing domestic low temperature space heating.

Lester was one of the Red Sox' top-rated prospects while in the minors, and other major league teams made efforts to acquire him. The Texas Rangers had demanded Lester be part of the proposed but ultimately rejected deal before the 2004 season for Alex Rodriguez.Go 2 Guy: Lester went from MLB to cancer ward and back again The Florida Marlins insisted he be included in the trade for Josh Beckett before the 2006 season, but again, the Sox were able to keep Lester. 2006 With a rash of injuries and general ineffectiveness of several Red Sox starters, the team recalled Lester on June 10 to make his major league debut against the Texas Rangers. He put up a 7‚Äì2 record and a 4.76 ERA in innings pitched in his rookie year. On August 27, 2006, Lester was scratched from his scheduled start against the Oakland Athletics due to a sore back. The following day he was placed on the 15-day disabled list, and was sent back to Boston for testing. At the time, Lester's back problems were thought to be the result of a car crash he was involved in earlier in the month. On August 31 it was reported that Lester had been diagnosed with enlarged lymph nodes and was being tested for a variety of ailments, including forms of cancer. A few days later, doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital confirmed that Lester had a treatable form of anaplastic large cell lymphoma.

It was the 18th no-hitter in Red Sox history. Lester threw 130 pitches in the game, allowing only two walks and striking out nine batters, and was charged with a throwing error on a pickoff attempt in the second inning. It was the first no-hitter thrown by a Red Sox left-handed pitcher since Mel Parnell in 1956, the first in MLB since teammate Clay Buchholz in September 2007, and the MLB-record fourth no-hitter caught by Jason Varitek.

The Ihanktonwana Dakota are the Upper Yanktonai, part of the collective of Wiciyena. The sixth- largest Native American reservation in land area in the US, Standing Rock includes all of Sioux County, North Dakota, and all of Corson County, South Dakota, plus slivers of northern Dewey and Ziebach counties in South Dakota, along their northern county lines at Highway 20. The reservation has a land area of and a population of 8,217 as of the 2010 census. There are 15,568 enrolled members of the tribe. The largest communities on the reservation are Fort Yates, Cannon Ball and McLaughlin. History Together with the Hunkpapa and Sihasapa bands, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is part of what was known as the Great Sioux Nation. The peoples were highly decentralized. In 1868 the lands of the Great Sioux Nation were reduced in the Fort Laramie Treaty to the east side of the Missouri River and the state line of South Dakota in the west. The Black Hills, considered by the Sioux to be sacred land, are located in the center of territory awarded to the tribe. In 1874, in direct violation of the treaty, General George A. Custer and his 7th Cavalry entered the Black Hills and discovered gold, starting a gold rush. The United States government wanted to buy or rent the Black Hills from the Lakota people, but led by their spiritual leader Sitting Bull, they refused to sell or rent their lands. The Great Sioux War of 1876 was a series of battles and negotiations that occurred between 1876 and 1877, with the Lakota Sioux and Northern Cheyenne warring against the United States. Among the many battles and skirmishes of the war was the Battle of the Little Bighorn, often known as Custer's Last Stand, the most storied of the many encounters between the U.S. army and mounted Plains Native Americans. It was an overwhelming Native American victory. The U.S. with its superior resources was soon able to force the Native Americans to surrender, primarily by attacking and destroying their encampments and property. The Agreement of 1877 (19 Stat. 254, enacted February 28, 1877) officially annexed Sioux land and permanently established Native American reservations. Under the Agreement of 1877 the U.S. government took the Black Hills from the Sioux Nation. In February 1890, the United States government broke a Lakota treaty by breaking up the Great Sioux Reservation, an area that formerly encompassed the majority of the state. It reduced it and divided it into five smaller reservations.Kehoe, The Ghost Dance, p. 15. The government was accommodating white homesteaders from the eastern United States; in addition, it intended to \\"break up tribal relationships\\" and \\"conform Indians to the white man's ways, peaceably if they will, or forcibly if they must\\".Wallace, Anthony F. C. \\"Revitalization Movements: Some Theoretical Considerations for Their Comparative Study\\", American Anthropologist n.s. 58(2):264-81. 1956 On the reduced reservations, the government allocated family units on plots for individual households. Although the Lakota were historically a nomadic people living in tipis, and their Plains Native American culture was based strongly upon buffalo and horse culture, they were expected to farm and raise livestock. With the goal of assimilation, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, they were forced to send their children to boarding schools; the schools taught English and Christianity, as well as American cultural practices. Generally, they forbade inclusion of Native American traditional culture and language. The children were beaten if they tried to do anything related to their native culture. The farming plan failed to take into account the difficulty that Lakota farmers would have in trying to cultivate crops in the semi-arid region of South Dakota. By the end of the 1890 growing season, a time of intense heat and low rainfall, it was clear that the land was unable to produce substantial agricultural yields. As the bison had been virtually eradicated a few years earlier, the Lakota were at risk of starvation. The people turned to the Ghost Dance ritual, which frightened the supervising agents of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Agent James McLaughlin asked for more troops. He claimed that spiritual leader Sitting Bull was the real leader of the movement. A former agent, Valentine McGillycuddy, saw nothing extraordinary in the dances and ridiculed the panic that seemed to have overcome the agencies, saying: \\"The coming of the troops has frightened the Indians. If the Seventh-Day Adventists prepare the ascension robes for the Second Coming of the Savior, the United States Army is not put in motion to prevent them. Why should not the Indians have the same privilege? If the troops remain, trouble is sure to come.\\" Thousands of additional U.S. Army troops were deployed to the reservation. On December 15, 1890, Sitting Bull was arrested for failing to stop his people from practicing the Ghost Dance.Kehoe, The Ghost Dance, p. 20. During his arrest, one of Sitting Bull's men, Catch the Bear, fired at Lieutenant \\"Bull Head\\", striking his right side. He instantly wheeled and shot Sitting Bull, hitting him in the left side, and both men subsequently died.\\"The Taming of the Sioux\\", by Frank Bennett Fiske, 1917, Bismarck Tribune, Bismarck ND The Hunkpapa who lived in Sitting Bull's camp and relatives fled to the south. They joined the Big Foot Band in Cherry Creek, South Dakota, before traveling to the Pine Ridge Reservation to meet with Chief Red Cloud. The 7th Cavalry caught them at a place called Wounded Knee on December 29, 1890. The 7th Cavalry, claiming they were trying to disarm the Lakota people, killed 300 people, including women and children at Wounded Knee. Governance and districts Standing Rock Administrative Service building, Fort Yates According to its constitution, Standing Rock's governing body is the elected 17-member Tribal Council, including the Tribal Chairman, Vice Chairman, Secretary, and 14 representatives. As of 2018, the current chairman is Mike Faith. They serve terms of four years, with elections providing for staggered replacement of members. Six members are elected at-large and eight from the regional single- member districts: * Fort Yates (Long Soldier) * Porcupine * Kenel * Wakpala * Running Antelope (Little Eagle) * Bear Soldier (McLaughlin) * Rock Creek (Bullhead) * Cannonball  Environmental issues  In the 1960s, the Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation built five large dams on the Missouri River, and implemented the Pick‚ÄìSloan Missouri Basin Program, forcing Native Americans to relocate from large areas to be flooded behind the dams. These dams were for flood control and hydroelectric power generation in the region. More than on the Standing Rock Reservation and the Cheyenne River Reservation in South Dakota were flooded by the Oahe Dam alone. As of 2015, poverty remains a problem for the displaced populations in the Dakotas. They have sought compensation for their towns submerged under Lake Oahe, and the loss of traditional ways of life.>  Dakota Access Pipeline  Lakota man locks himself to construction equipment to stop progress of the Dakota Access Pipeline near the Standing Rock Reservation in North Dakota, Summer 2016 The Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) was rerouted near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation after a proposed route near the state capital Bismarck was denied as being deemed too risky for Bismarck's water supplies. The tribe opposed the pipeline to be constructed under Lake Oahe and the Missouri River. On April 1, 2016, LaDonna Brave Bull Allard, an elder member of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, and her grandchildren established the Sacred Stone Camp to protest the DAPL, which they said threatens the upper Missouri River, the only water supply for the Standing Rock Reservation. The camp was on Allard's private land and served as a center for cultural preservation and spiritual resistance to the DAPL. Protests at the pipeline site in North Dakota began in the spring of 2016 and drew indigenous people from throughout North America, as well as many other supporters. It was the largest gathering of Native Tribes in the past 100 years. A number of planned arrests occurred when people locked themselves to heavy machinery in civil disobedience. Facebook was criticized for assisting the local authorities in censoring the protesters. In the summer of 2016, a group of young activists from Standing Rock ran from North Dakota to Washington, D.C., to present a petition in protest of the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline, which is part of the Bakken pipeline. They launched an international campaign called ReZpect our Water. The activists argued that the pipeline, which goes from North Dakota to Illinois, would jeopardize the water source of the reservation, the Missouri River. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe filed an injunction against the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to stop building the pipeline. In April 2016, three federal agencies -- U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Department of Interior, and Advisory Council on Historic Preservation‚Äîrequested a full Environmental Impact Statement of the pipeline. In August 2016, protests were held near Cannon Ball, North Dakota. By late September, it was reported that there were over 300 federally recognized Native American tribes and an estimated 3,000 to 4,000 pipeline resistance supporters residing in the camp, with several thousand more on weekends. A number of planned arrests occurred when people locked themselves to heavy machinery. On September 3, 2016, the DAPL brought in a private security firm. The company used bulldozers to dig up part of the pipeline route that was subject to a pending injunction motion; it contained possible Native graves and burial artifacts. The bulldozers arrived within a day from when the tribe filed legal action. When unarmed protesters moved near the bulldozers, the guards used pepper spray and guard dogs to attack the protesters. At least six protesters were treated for dog bites, and an estimated 30 protesters were pepper-sprayed before the security guards and their dogs exited the scene in trucks. The pipeline construction company claimed they hired the security company because the protests had not been peaceful. The Morton County Sheriff, Kyle Kirchmeier, described the September 3, 2016 protest, saying protesters crossed onto private property and attacked security guards with \\"wooden posts and flag poles.\\" He said, \\"Any suggestion that today's event was a peaceful protest, is false.\\" Shortly thereafter, on September 7, 2016, after the federal court denied the tribe's request for an injunction, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the United States Department of the Interior (DOI) and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation gave the order to halt the construction of the pipeline until further environmental assessments had taken place. There was no evidence of what role President Obama himself may or may not have played in this decision. Dakota Access agreed to temporarily halt construction in parts of North Dakota, until September 9, to help \\"keep the peace.\\" When a federal judge denied the injunction sought by the tribe on the 9th, the Department of the Interior, Department of Justice, and the Department of the Army (which oversees the Corps of Engineers) stepped in, halting construction of the pipeline around Lake Oahe, 20 miles (32 km) either side of the Lake, but not halting the project altogether. On the weekend of December 2, 2016, approximately 2000 United States military veterans arrived in North Dakota in support of the activists. The veterans pledged to form a human shield to protect the protesters from police.USA today: 2,000 veterans to give protesters a break at Standing Rock. December 2, 2016 In January 2017, an executive order was issued by President Donald Trump to streamline the approval to construct the pipeline, on the basis of creating more jobs. The order provoked a new wave of protests and response from leaders of the Sioux tribe. On February 3, 2017, the Army Corps of Engineers announced that it would close lands where protesters were camped near Lake Oahe by February 22, 2017. Over 4,000 U.S. veterans under the name Veterans Stand were camped at Standing Rock along with hundreds of protesters as well as the members of the Sioux Tribe. The veterans vowed to oppose the pipeline and protect the land of the American Indians and the water of the United States. Since August 2016, the total number of protesters arrested had surpassed 700, and on February 3, 2017, 39-year-old American Indian activist Chase Iron Eyes and more than 70 peaceably assembled protesters were arrested in a police raid ordered by the Trump administration, on charges of \\"inciting a riot\\" which is considered a felony and carries up to 5 years in prison. At that time more than 9.2 million Americans had signed a petition against DAPL. On February 7, 2017, President Trump authorized the Army Corps of Engineers to proceed, ending its environmental impact assessment and the associated public comment period.[12] The pipeline was completed by April and its first oil was delivered on May 14, 2017.[13] The tribe sued and in March 2020 a federal judge sided with them and ordered USACE to do a full environmental impact statement. In a 42-page decision Judge James Boasberg said the environmental analysis by both the companies behind the pipeline and the Corps was severely lacking. ‚ÄúIn projects of this scope, it is not difficult for an opponent to find fault with many conclusions made by an operator and relied on by the agency, but here, there is considerably more than a few isolated comments raising insubstantial concerns. The many commenters in this case pointed to serious gaps in crucial parts of the Corps‚Äô analysis ‚Äî to name a few, that the pipeline's leak- detection system was unlikely to work, that it was not designed to catch slow spills, that the operator's serious history of incidents had not been taken into account, and that the worst-case scenario used by the Corps was potentially only a fraction of what a realistic figure would be.\\" The case will continue. = Media attention and public awareness = A video was aired on June 22, 2017 showing how people were treated as part of the pipeline protest in September 2016, which included evidence of Dakota Access guard dogs with bloody mouths after attacking protesters. Democracy Now! journalist Amy Goodman filmed the incident, which she published in support of opposition to the pipeline. Following the publishing of her video, North Dakota Police issued an arrest warrant for Goodman under accusations of Criminal Trespass. Goodman responded, \\"This is an unacceptable violation of freedom of the press...\\" The 2016 Democratic and Republican presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump made no comments during the campaign regarding the DAPL. 2016 Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein protested at the site, including spray painting equipment; charges of criminal trespass and criminal mischief were made against both her and her running mate Ajamu Baraka. US Senator Bernie Sanders from Vermont, a 2016 Democratic presidential primary candidate, publicly spoke out against the pipeline and in favor of the \\"water protectors.\\" A variety of Hollywood celebrities also supported the protests. On September 20, 2016, Standing Rock Chairman Dave Archambault II addressed the Human Rights Council of the United Nations in Geneva, testifying about the United States' violation of treaties with regard to this project. Two days later Energy Transfer Partners purchased the property where protests were being staged, from David and Brenda Meyer of Flasher, North Dakota. Analysts believed the company was trying to deter further protests. The Standing Rock Nation said that the Meyers had permitted activists on their land. Presidential visit In June 2014, President Barack Obama, accompanied by First Lady Michelle Obama, made his first visit to a Native American reservation during the annual Cannon Ball Flag Day Celebration at Standing Rock. This was one of the few visits by a sitting American President to any Native American reservation. Some reservation residents felt that their specific concerns about treaty issues and government appropriations were not addressed.

While their flowers are small and not prominent, persoonias are best known in the Australian bush for the striking bright green foliage of many species. Description Persoonias are usually shrubs, sometimes small trees and usually have smooth bark. The adult leaves are simple, usually arranged alternately but sometimes in opposite pairs, or in whorls of three or four. If a petiole is present, it is short. The flowers are arranged singly or in racemes, usually of a few flowers, either in leaf axils or on the ends of the branches. Sometimes the raceme continues to grow into a leafy shoot. The tepals are free from each other except near their base, have their tips rolled back and are usually yellow. There is a single stigma on top of the ovary and surrounded by four stamens. The fruit is a drupe containing one or two seeds. Taxonomy and naming The genus Persoonia was first formally described in 1798 by James Edward Smith and the description was published in Transactions of the Linnean Society of London. The generic name is in honour of Dutch mycologist and botanist Christiaan Hendrik Persoon. Smith did not nominate a type species but in 1988, Persoonia lanceolata was nominated as the lectotype. The term geebung is derived from the Dharug language word geebung, while the Wiradjuri term was jibbong. The etymology of \\"snottygobble\\" is more obscure. The English Dialect Dictionary published in 1904 lists snotergob, snot-gob and snotty-gobble as \\"the fruit of the yew-tree, Taxus baccata\\" noting that \\"children devour quantities of the red part of these berries, which they call snotty-gobbles, and suffer no ill-effects\\". The pulp around the hard stone in the drupes of Persoonia is edible although \\"the operation is a little like nibbling sweet cotton wool\\". Molecular hylogenetic studies indicate that Toronia, Garnieria and Acidonia all lie within the large genus Persoonia.Holmes, G. D., Weston, P. H., Murphy, D. J., Connelly, C., & Cantrill, D. J. (2018). The genealogy of geebungs: phylogenetic analysis of Persoonia (Proteaceae) and related genera in subfamily Persoonioideae. Australian Systematic Botany, 31(2), 166-189. Distribution and habitat All species are endemic to Australia, though a closely related species, Toronia toru is found in New Zealand and has been described as a species within the genus Persoonia previously. They are widespread in non-arid regions. One species, P. pertinax, is found only in the Great Victoria Desert, while a few other species venture into the arid zone, but most are concentrated in the subtropical to temperate parts of south eastern and south western Australia, including Tasmania. Most species are plants of well-drained, acid, sandy or sandstone-based soils that are low in nutrients, although one, Persoonia graminea, grows in swampy habitats. Three species (P. acicularis, P. bowgada and P. hexagona) tolerate mildly calcareous soils, and several south eastern species sometimes grow on basalt-derived soils, and but these are unusual. The greatest diversity of species is found in areas with soils derived from sandstones and granites. Ecology Interactions between micro-organisms and Persoonia species are poorly known, and no mycorrhizal associations have been reported for any species of Persoonioideae. Several species of Persoonia (P. elliptica, P. gunnii, P. longifolia, P. micranthera, P. muelleri) are known to be highly susceptible to infection by an Oomycete, Phytophthora cinnamomi, in the wild and this pathogen is strongly suspected of being responsible for the deaths of many other species in cultivation. The sclerophyllous plant communities where Persoonia species usually live are fire-prone environments, hence Persoonia species have adapted to frequent bushfires. The most obvious adaptations are features that allow plants to survive fires, albeit in a more- or-less pruned state. Many species, especially in the south west, are lignotuberous, resprouting from ground level after fire. Several also develop thick bark that protects epicormic buds, which resprout from trunks and large branches after fire. The most eye-catching of these are the four ‚Äúpaper- barked‚Äù species: P. falcata, P. levis, P. linearis and P. longifolia. Branch resprouters with less conspicuous protective bark include P. amaliae, P. elliptica, P. katerae and P. stradbrokensis. Fire-sensitive species survive fires as buried seeds, which tend to germinate prolifically after disturbance. These species seem to require an interval of at least eight years between fires, allowing newly germinated plants to reach reproductive maturity and establish a replacement seed bank. The natural patterns and processes involved in this kind of life cycle, including seed longevity, the environmental cues that stimulate germination, and even the time from germination to first flowering are still poorly understood. The best studied interaction between animals and Persoonia species is that between the plants and their pollinators. All species that have been studied in detail have been found to be pollinated by a variety of native bees, but especially species of Leioproctus subgenus Cladocerapis (Colletidae), which rarely visit any plants but Persoonia. The behaviour of these bees on Persoonia flowers is quite predictable. Both males and females alight on the cross-shaped ‚Äúplatform‚Äù formed by the recurved anther tips, orient themselves to be facing one of the anther/tepals, then slide, face first, down between the anther and the style to reach the two glands at either side of the base of the tepal, and drink the nectar from them. Females gather pollen grains with their legs while drinking nectar. The insect then withdraws to the top of the flower, makes a 180¬∞ turn, then repeats the process on the other side of the flower. Another species group in Leioproctus, subgenus Filiglossa, also specialises in feeding on Persoonia flowers but these smaller bees seem to be nectar and pollen ‚Äúthieves‚Äù, not effective pollinators. The introduced honeybee (Apis mellifera) is also a frequent visitor of Persoonia flowers at most sites but it is still unclear whether this species is an effective pollinator. The fleshy fruits of Persoonia species are clearly adapted for animal dispersal but it is still unclear whether mammals such as possums and wallabies, or large flying birds such as currawongs are the most important dispersers. Parrots, also feed on Persoonia fruits, but the fruit (and seed) they eat are unripe, and hence their interaction with the plants is predatory rather than symbiotic.

Henley (DD-553), a Fletcher-class destroyer, was a ship of the United States Navy named for Captain John D. Henley (1781‚Äì1835). John D. Henley was laid down on 21 July 1941 by Gulf Shipbuilding Co., Chickasaw, Ala.; launched on 15 November 1942, sponsored by Miss Shelah Keith Kane, great-great-great-granddaughter of Captain Henley; and commissioned on 2 February 1944, Commander C. H. Smith in command. Service history Following exhaustive shakedown training out of Bermuda, the new destroyer arrived Norfolk on 28 March 1944. Sailing for the Pacific via the Panama Canal, she arrived Pearl Harbor on 23 April 1944. After operational training, John D. Henley escorted fleet oilers to Majuro and returned on 17 May. She departed on 27 May for Majuro once more and there became flagship of a refueling task group. Departing on 6 June 1944, the ships moved to the Marianas to refuel the fleet during the capture and occupation of Saipan and Tinian. During this long at-sea period the ships came under air attack 17‚Äì18 June. They returned to Eniwetok 14 August. As the Navy's mobile amphibious forces prepared to move into the Palaus, Henley joined Task Group 30.8 (TG 30.8) and departed Manus 1 September as flagship of the refueling group during strikes on Peleliu and its eventual capture. The oilers and their escorts continued to operate out of Ulithi well into November, supporting the vast aircraft carrier task forces striking the Philippines. This unit, headed by Captain J. T. Acuff, had much to do with the great success of the wide-ranging carrier forces. In December, the destroyer moved to Guam for independent operation as an escort and patrol ship in the Marshall and Mariana Islands. She then steamed to Ulithi, where she arrived 31 January 1945 to undergo operational training in covering Underwater Demolition Teams. She sailed 14 February for the next major landing on the island road to Japan, Iwo Jima. Arriving 2 days later, she took part in the pre-invasion bombardment and, after the assault on Iwo Jima 19 February, performed yeoman fire support, screening, and radar picket duties during the bitter fighting ashore. She returned to Ulithi on 5 March to prepare for the Okinawa invasion. Henley got underway on 21 March for the last and largest of the Pacific amphibious operations, Okinawa. Her assignment consisted of screening the light carriers as their planes provided vital air support to ground troops. Undergoing periodic air attacks, she continued to screen her carrier group, with occasional logistics stops at Kerama Retto until 24 June. She arrived Leyte Gulf 27 June 1945. The veteran ship returned to waters north of Okinawa on 1 July to cover minesweeping operations. Henley returned to Buckner Bay on 7 August and was there at war's end on 15 August. She took air- sea rescue station off Japan on 24 August, then departed on 2 September, the day of Japan's formal surrender, for the long voyage to California, arriving in San Francisco on 24 September. She was overhauled, and decommissioned at San Diego on 30 April 1946, then entered the Pacific Reserve Fleet, and was berthed at Bremerton, Wash. On 1 May 1968, the ship was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register, and in May 1970 she was sold and broken up for scrap. Honors John D. Henley received six battle stars for World War II service.

For example, pole figures in the form of stereographic projections are used to represent the orientation distribution of crystallographic lattice planes in crystallography and texture analysis in materials science. Definition Poles of the faces of a cube Consider an object with a basis attached to it. The orientation of the object in space can be determined by three rotations to transform the reference basis of space to the basis attached to the object; these are the Euler angles. If we consider a plane of the object, the orientation of the plane can be given by its normal line. If we draw a sphere with the center on the plane, then * the intersection of the sphere and the plane is a circle, called the \\"trace\\" ; * the intersection of the normal line and the sphere is the pole. A single pole is not enough to fully determine the orientation of an object: the pole stays the same if we apply a rotation around the normal line. The orientation of the object is fully determined by the use of poles of two planes that are not parallel. Stereographic projection Stereographic projection of a pole The upper sphere is projected on a plane using the stereographic projection. Consider the (x,y) plane of the reference basis; its trace on the sphere is the equator of the sphere. We draw a line joining the South pole with the pole of interest P. It is possible to choose any projection plane parallel to the equator (except the South pole): the figures will be proportional (property of similar triangles). It is usual to place the projection plane at the North pole. ; Definition : The pole figure is the stereographic projection of the poles used to represent the orientation of an object in space. Geometry in the pole figure Wulff net, step of 10¬∞ Wulff net, pole and trace of a plane diamond lattice in 111 direction. A Wulff net is used to read a pole figure. The stereographic projection of a trace is an arc. The Wulff net is arcs corresponding to planes which share a common axis in the (x,y) plane. If the pole and the trace of a plane are represented on the same diagram, then * we turn the Wulff net so the trace corresponds to an arc of the net; * the pole is situated on an arc, and the angular distance between this arc and the trace is 90¬∞. Consider an axis Œî, and planes belonging to the zone of this axis, i.e. Œî is in all these planes, the intersection of all the planes is Œî. If we call P the plane that is perpendicular to Œî, then the normals to the planes all belong to P. Thus, the poles of the planes belonging to the same zone are on the trace of the plane P perpendicular to the axis. Application =Planes of a crystal= The structure of a crystal is often represented by the pole figure of its crystallographic plane. A plane is chosen as the equator, usually the (001) or (011) plane; its pole is the center of the figure. Then, the poles of the other planes are placed on the figure, with the Miller indices for each pole. The poles that belong to a zone are sometimes linked with the related trace. =Texture= Pole figures displaying crystallographic texture of gamma-TiAl in an alpha2-gamma alloy, as measured by high energy X-rays. \\"Texture\\" in the context of Materials Science means \\"crystallographic preferred orientation\\". If a polycrystalline material (i.e. a material composed of many different crystals or grains, like most metals, ceramics or minerals) has \\"texture\\" then that means that the crystal axes are not randomly (or, more correctly, uniformly) distributed. To draw a pole figure, one chooses a particular crystal direction (e.g. the normal to the (100) plane) and then plots that direction, called a pole, for each and every crystal relative to a set of directions in the material. In a rolled metal, for example, the directions in the material are the rolling direction, transverse direction and rolling plane normal. If a large number of crystals are involved, then it is typical to make a contour plot, rather than plotting individual poles. The full determination of the texture requires the plot of two pole figures corresponding to planes that are not parallel and that do not have the same diffraction angle (thus different interplanar distances). =Diffraction figure= Pole figure and diffraction figure Consider the diffraction figure obtained with a single crystal, on a plane that is perpendicular to the beam, e.g. X-ray diffraction with the Laue method, or electron diffraction in a transmission electron microscope. The diffraction figure shows spots. The position of the spots is determined by the Bragg's law. It gives the orientation of the plane.

The law allowed local authorities to draw up lists of \\"hostages\\" who would be held responsible for certain criminal offences, and was particularly intended to be used against notables suspected of threatening the Directory's authority. Since local authorities were responsible for the law's execution, it was not always effective since local authorities often sympathized with those it was intended to be used against or they refrained because they did not want to cause strife in their community.

While in the town of Murphy in Appalachian North Carolina, Niles attended a fundraising meeting held by evangelicals who had been ordered out of town by the police. In his unpublished autobiography, he wrote of hearing the song: The girl, named Annie Morgan, repeated the fragment seven times in exchange for a quarter per performance, and Niles left with \\"three lines of verse, a garbled fragment of melodic material‚Äîand a magnificent idea\\". (In various accounts of this story, Niles hears between one and three lines of the song.Stulken, Marilyn K. With One Voice: Reference Companion. Augsburg Fortress (2000), p25. .) Based on this fragment, Niles composed the version of \\"I Wonder as I Wander\\" that is known today, extending the melody to four lines and the lyrics to three stanzas. His composition was completed on October 4, 1933. Niles first performed the song on December 19, 1933, at the John C. Campbell Folk School in Brasstown, North Carolina. It was originally published in Songs of the Hill Folk in 1934.

As a young prodigy, he started violin studies in Odessa with the eminent pedagogue, Pyotr Stolyarsky and continued them in Moscow Conservatory under Abram Yampolsky and Lev Tseitlin. As a teenager, Boris Goldstein was singled out by Heifetz as being USSR's most brilliant violin talent. Life and career Goldstein was born in Odessa in 1922, the son of Emanuel Goldstein from Leipzig, Germany, who moved to Odessa to become a professor for mathematics in Odessa. He won the fourth prize of the 1935 Henryk Wieniawski Violin Competition in Warsaw; Ginette Neveu from France came first, David Oistrakh second, and Josef Hassid from Poland received the honorary diploma. In 1937, at one of the most prestigious international competitions of its time, the International Ysaye Competition, Stolyarsky students caused a sensation. Top prizes were won by David Oistrakh, Boris Goldshtein (Goldstein), Yelizaveta Gilels and Mikhail Fikhtengoltz. \\"The results of the sessions created a profound impression: the Soviet school, with an assurance that bordered on arrogance, carried off all the prizes from the first down. The latter was awarded without the slightest discussion to the great David Oistrakh. Everyone else had to be content with crumbs; the Belgian violin school, though still a source of pride, failed, and its absence at the final was much commented on; Arthur Grumiaux and Carlo Van Neste, both young and inexperienced, were not able to convince the jury.\\" * The Queen Elisabeth Competition Later he was forced to emigrate from Russia to Germany, he taught but his solo career never recovered. The composer, violinist, and professor for violin Mikhail Goldstein was his brother. Notable students of Boris Goldstein include Zakhar Bron and Alexander Skwortsow.

It codifies many consular practices that originated from state custom and various bilateral agreements between states.Michael John Garcia, \\"Vienna Convention on Consular Relations: Overview of U.S. Implementation and International Court of Justice (ICJ) Interpretation of Consular Notification Requirements\\", CRS Report for Congress (May 17, 2004), https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/RL32390.pdf Consuls have traditionally been employed to represent the interests of state's or their nationals at an embassy or consulate in another country. The Convention defines and articulates the functions, rights, and immunities accorded to consular officers and their offices, as well as the rights and duties of \\"receiving States\\" (where the consul is based) and \\"sending States\\" (the state the consul represents). Adopted in 1963, and in force since 1967, the treaty has been ratified by 180 states. History The Convention was adopted on April 24, 1963 following the United Nations Conference on Consular Relations in Vienna, Austria from 4 March to 22 April 1963. Its official texts are in the English, French, Chinese, Russian and Spanish languages, which the Convention provides are equally authentic. Key provisions The treaty contains 79 articles. The preamble to the Convention states that customary international law continues to apply to matters not addressed in the Convention.Boleslaw Adam Boczek, International Law: A Dictionary (Scarecrow Press, 2014), pp. 41-42. Some significant provisions include. * Article 5 lists thirteen functions of a consul, including \\"protecting in the receiving State the interests of the sending State and of its nationals, both individuals and bodies corporate, within the limits permitted by international law\\" and \\"furthering the development of commercial, economic, cultural and scientific relations between the sending State and the receiving State.\\" * Article 23 provides that the host nation may at any time and for any reason declare a particular member of the consular staff to be persona non grata, and the sending state must recall this person within a reasonable period of time, or otherwise this person may lose their consular immunity. * Article 31 provides that the consular premises are inviolable (i.e., the host nation may not enter the consular premises, and must protect the premises from intrusion or damage). * Article 35 provides that freedom of communication between the consul and their home country must be preserved, that consular bags \\"shall be neither opened nor detained\\"; and that a consular courier must never be detained. * Article 36 addresses communications between consular officers and nationals of the sending state. The Convention provides that \\"consular officers shall be free to communicate with nationals of the sending State and to have access to them.\\" Foreign nationals who are arrested or detained be given notice \\"without delay\\" of their right to have their embassy or consulate notified of that arrest, and \\"consular officers shall have the right to visit a national of the sending State who is in prison, custody or detention, to converse and correspond with him and to arrange for his legal representation.\\" * Article 37 provides that with the host country must \\"without delay\\" notify consular officers of the sending state if one of the sending state's nationals dies or has a guardian or trustee appointed over him. The article also provides that consular officers must be informed \\"without delay\\" if a vessel with the sending state's nationality is wrecked or runs aground \\"in the territorial sea or internal waters of the receiving State, or if an aircraft registered in the sending State suffers an accident on the territory of the receiving State.\\" * Article 40 provides that \\"The receiving State shall treat consular officers with due respect and shall take all appropriate steps to prevent any attack on their person, freedom or dignity.\\" * Articles 58-68 deal with honorary consular officers and their powers and functions. =Consular immunity= The Convention (Article 43) provides for consular immunity. Some but not all provisions in the Convention regarding this immunity reflect customary international law. Consular immunity is a lesser form of diplomatic immunity. Consular officers and consular employees have \\"functional immunity\\" (i.e., immunity from the jurisdiction of the receiving state \\"in respect of acts performed in exercise of consular function\\"), but do not enjoy the broader \\"personal immunity\\" accorded to diplomats. State parties to the convention thumbright334px There are 180 state parties to the convention including most UN member states and UN observer states Holy See and State of Palestine. The signatory states that have not ratified the convention are: Central African Republic, Israel, Ivory Coast and Republic of Congo. The UN member states that have neither signed nor ratified the convention are: Afghanistan, Burundi, Chad, Comoros, Guinea-Bissau, Ethiopia, Palau, San Marino, Solomon Islands, South Sudan and Uganda. Application of the treaty by the United States In March 2005, following the decisions of the International Court of Justice in the LaGrand case (2001) and 'Avena case (2004), the United States withdrew from the Optional Protocol to the Convention concerning the Compulsory Settlement of Disputes, which confers the ICJ with compulsory jurisdiction over disputes arising under the Convention.Jan Wouters, Sanderijn Duquet & Katrien Meuwissen, \\"The Vienna Conventions on Diplomatic and Consular Relations\\" in The Oxford Handbook of Modern Diplomacy (eds. Andrew F. Cooper, Jorge Heine & Ramesh Thakur: Oxford University Press, 2013), pp. 515-16.Andreas Zimmermann, \\"Between the Quest for Universality and its Limited Jurisdiction: The Role of the International Court of Justice in enhancing the International Rule of Law\\" in Enhancing the Rule of Law through the International Court of Justice (eds. Giorgio Gaja & Jenny Grote Stoutenburg: Brill Nijhoff, 2014), p. 40. In 2006, the United States Supreme Court ruled that foreign nationals who were not notified of their right to consular notification and access after an arrest may not use the treaty violation to suppress evidence obtained in police interrogation or belatedly raise legal challenges after trial (Sanchez-Llamas v. Oregon).Sanchez-Llamas v. Oregon, 548 U.S. 331 (2006). In 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court further ruled that the decision of the ICJ directing the United States to give \\"review and reconsideration\\" to the cases of 51 Mexican convicts on death row was not a binding domestic law and therefore could not be used to overcome state procedural default rules that barred further post- conviction challenges (Medell√≠n v. Texas).Medell√≠n v. Texas, 552 U.S. 491 (2008). In 1980, prior to its withdrawal from the Optional Protocol, the U.S. brought a case to the ICJ against Iran--United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran (United States v Iran)--in response to the seizure of United States diplomatic offices and personnel by militant revolutionaries.International Court of Justice, 24 May 1980, Case Concerning United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in

In addition to having a number of offices in the U.S., the company also maintained offices in Europe and Asia. It was acquired by Rovi Corporation in 2010. thumb History Sonic Solutions was created by former Lucasfilm employees who developed the SoundDroid digital audio editing system as part of the Droidworks project. (Another notable spinoff of the project is Pixar.) Sonic developed and marketed The Sonic System, a professional non- linear digital audio workstation for music editing, restoration and CD preparation. Sonic received an Emmy Award for technical achievement in 1996. In the same year the company worked with numerous Hollywood studios and consumer electronic manufactures to introduce the first commercial DVD production system. Sonic extended its business to enterprise software areas with its DVD authoring systems for professional use (Sonic Scenarist and Sonic DVD Producer) as well as retail and PC OEM DVD software applications for home use (DVDit, MyDVD, and RecordNow). In 2002, Sonic spun off their entire audio division as Sonic Studio, LLC, to concentrate solely on the DVD marketplace, enterprise software and licensing of IP and source code. Notable customers included Microsoft, Apple, Google, Adobe and Avid. Its middleware and embedded chip included deals with Texas Instruments, Broadcom, Scientific Atlanta/Cisco, Marvell, and Intel. Sonic expanded to the consumer software business (photo, audio and video editing) in 2000, shipping roughly 50 million copies per year through direct web sales and over 15,000 retail store fronts including Apple Store, Walmart, Costco, Best Buy, Target, Dixon's and MediaMart. It grew to command a 64% market share in its category. Since its IPO, the company has generated over $1.5 billion in revenue in the digital media category and has been named one of Forbes, Fortune and BusinessWeek's fastest growing companies on multiple occasions. In 2005, Sonic began moving its consumer software business to a SAAS model. By 2010 Sonic was one of the largest providers of premium movies via the Web and CE devices, in partnership with major movie studios. Sonic held the rights to the movies and provided cloud delivery as a white label provider. Acquisitions Sonic‚Äôs major acquisitions include the Desktop and Mobile Division (DMD) of VERITAS Software Corporation in 2002, Roxio in 2003 (consumer applications for Windows and Mac OS), and Simple Star (online slideshow creation) and CinemaNow in 2008 (digital movie delivery). In October 2010, the company acquired DivX Inc. in a $326 million stock and cash deal as the digital-media provider moves to enhance online video offerings. Sale On December 23, 2010, Rovi Corporation announced its intention to acquire the company. The sale was a cash stock deal for just under $1 billion. According to a February 2011 article in Business Insider, Sonic yielded the highest return of any publicly traded company on the NYSE or NASDAQ markets. Both stocks rose on the deal announcement, creating a 66% premium above market. The acquisition was completed early the next year. In January 2012, Rovi announced that it would be selling the Roxio division and product line to Corel.

Childhood Born on 28 December 1923 to Jewish parents in Suwa≈Çki, Poland, as Joseph or J√≥zef Chasyd, he was the second youngest of four children. He lost his mother when he was ten and was brought up by his father, Owsiej, who took charge of his career. After lessons with a local violin teacher he studied from 1934 at the Chopin School of Music in Warsaw under Mieczys≈Çaw Micha≈Çowicz (born 1872) and Irena Dubiska (1899‚Äì1989). In 1935 he entered the first Henryk Wieniawski International Violin Competition in Warsaw, but suffered a memory lapse; he received an honorary diploma. His father arranged for him to play for fellow Pole Bronis≈Çaw Huberman, who was much impressed and he arranged for Hassid to study under the Hungarian virtuoso Carl Flesch at his summer course in 1937 at Spa, Belgium, where fellow students included Ivry Gitlis, Ginette Neveu and Ida Haendel. London studies and concerts Hassid came to London with his father in 1938 at Flesch's invitation, to continue studies with him. Flesch concentrated on his musical and interpretative development rather than technical skills. Musical celebrities who heard him play at Flesch's house and were astonished at his ability included Joseph Szigeti, Jacques Thibaud, David Oistrakh and Fritz Kreisler. In a passage supplementing his father's memoirs Carl F. Flesch wrote that \\"Hassid was no doubt one of the strongest violin talents of his time. Indeed Fritz Kreisler, after hearing him at my father's house, said: 'A fiddler like Heifetz is born every 100 years; one like Hassid every 200 years.'\\"Carl Flesch: Memoirs (1973, pp. 360‚Äì1). The violinist with whom Hassid was compared is usually cited as Jascha Heifetz, but in a letter published in The Gramophone (Aug. 1987, p. 531) Brian Crimp (who contributed the booklet notes to the Testament CD) states that a witness to the original conversation assured him that Heifetz's name was not mentioned; furthermore, in a letter published in the December 1987 issue (p. 869), Artur W. Vered, the biographer of Heifetz, confirms that he can say with certainty it was not him. Kreisler lent Hassid for the remainder of his career a violin of 1860 by the French maker Jean-Baptiste Vuillaume, which was a great improvement on the instrument he had played up until then. He gave a private recital with the pianist Ivor Newton on 9 March 1938 as \\"Yossef Hassid\\" at the home of Mr L.L. Gildesgame, 41 Clifton Hill, South Hampstead, where the guests included Sir Henry Wood.The Times 12 March 1938 After giving a private recital at the home of Sir Philip Sassoon, Hassid made his public debut at a recital with Gerald Moore in the Wigmore Hall on 3 April 1940, billed as the \\"Polish Boy Violinist\\",Margaret Campbell: The Great Violinists (1980) playing works by Corelli (La Follia variations), Debussy, Schubert (Sonata in G), Bach (adagio and fugue from one of the unaccompanied sonatas), Paganini (I palpiti) and others. The next day The Times wrote Hassid \\"showed imagination and musical insight\\" and that \\"his performance created a strong impression.\\" Many years later Moore commented that Hassid was \\"the greatest instrumental genius I've ever partnered. I don't know how to explain his incandescence. He had technical perfection, marvellous intonation, glorious tone ‚Äì but there was something above that which was quite incredible, a metaphysical quality. Sadly he had an unhappy love affair which literally drove him mad. But then maybe the unrest inside him made him play so fantastically.\\" (Interview in The Gramophone, April 1973.) Three weeks later, on the evening of 25 April, he made his orchestral debut at the Queen's Hall in a Polish Relief Fund concert (broadcast on the BBC Home Service) playing the Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto with the LPO under Grzegorz Fitelberg (during which he suffered a memory lapse). The concerto was preceded by two short items by Chabrier and Kondracki and followed by Beethoven's Seventh Symphony. The next day The Times reported that Hassid \\"showed some signs of nervousness at the outset\\", but \\"the beauty of his tone was striking and the brilliance of the finale\\" earned him generous applause. On 9 June 1940 he was due to appear with Eileen Joyce as a supporting artist for Richard Tauber in a concert at the Colston Hall, Bristol, but was replaced in the event by the cellist Eleanor Warren. He gave a few recital broadcasts on the BBC and played the Beethoven Violin Concerto during an afternoon concert in the Queen's Hall with Sir Adrian Boult conducting the London Philharmonic Orchestra on 5 January 1941. Three days later The Times commented of Hassid's as \\"a technically accomplished performance, but he has not yet attained to the purity of style, especially in the matter of sustaining an even tone throughout a phrase that the music needs.\\" Hassid's final concert was also at the Queen's Hall, on the afternoon of 1 March 1941, where he played the Brahms Violin Concerto with the Sidney Beer Symphony Orchestra of about thirty players under Sidney Beer. The Times review (4 March) noted that the concerto was \\"the least satisfactory part of the concert, because neither the young violinist nor the conductor seemed to have a determined view of Brahms to present to their hearers. The solo performance was scarcely more than that of a clever student who has worked hard to memorize the concerto but is still liable to be thrown off his stroke, even to the point of forgetting his notes occasionally. The rhythm throughout was indecisive and the last pages of the Finale became almost a race between soloist and orchestra.\\" Illness and death Although originally shy and introverted, Hassid was described as a carefree, likeable young man when he first came to London, but by February 1941 it became apparent that he was suffering from a severe mental disorder characterised by violent mood swings, often becoming sullen and withdrawn, and turning against his violin, his father and his religion. An inability to recognise close friends rapidly led to complete withdrawal from the world at large. He was diagnosed with schizophrenia and on June 19, withdrawn and uncooperative, he was admitted to St Andrew's Hospital in Northampton for insulin coma therapy and electroconvulsive therapy. Hassid's agent, the impresario Harold Holt, wrote to the superintendent of St Andrew's: \\"He is nothing short of a violinistic genius and of such exceptional quality that we want to make the greatest effort possible to cure him. I would particularly like to stress that he is most exceptional, and might have ‚Äì had this illness not developed ‚Äì been one of the greatest figures in the violinistic world.\\" His condition improved for a time and he left the hospital on 2 May 1942, but on 9 December that year he was certified insane and admitted to Moorcroft House, a private asylum in Hillingdon, Middlesex, three days later, for further treatment. On 13 July 1943 Hassid was transferred to an asylum in Epsom (Long Grove Hospital), morose, indifferent and evasive, either silent or laughing inanely. He remained there for the rest of his life. His father died in 1949, causing his condition to deteriorate to the point that on 20 October 1950 psychosurgeons subjected him to a bilateral prefrontal lobotomy. Hassid developed a postoperative infection that progressed into meningitis, and he died on 7 November, shortly before his twenty-seventh birthday. Recordings Fred Gaisberg of EMI arranged for a test recording of Elgar's La Capricieuse (Op. 17) with accompanist Ivor Newton at the Abbey Road Studios on 9 January 1939 when Hassid had just turned 15; and then Walter Legge produced a further eight recordings on 12 and 28 June and 29 November 1940, this time accompanied by Gerald Moore. The delay was due to Hassid's agent Harold Holt, who thought he should continue his studies for another year. Some who heard Hassid perform live say that the records do not show him at his best. Even so, his performances of Joseph Achron's Hebrew Melody, Sarasate's Zapateado and Kreisler's Caprice viennois in particular are superb and show virtuosity of the highest order in expressive phrasing. To quote from Bryan Crimp's note with the Testament CD: \\"The moment Hassid puts bow to string he beguiles the ear via a captivating and uniquely individual sound ... a peerless technique and an arresting and frequently original interpretative approach. His technical security and cleanness of attack are awesome, his tone at once vibrant, virile and indescribably pure and sweet.\\" Hassid apparently thought that his vibrato sounded too fast on record, but this is probably just a matter of taste.

Many of the tools used in woodworking have steel blades which are sharpened to a fine edge. A cutting edge is created on the blade at the point at which two surfaces of the blade meet. To create this cutting edge a bevel is formed on the blade, usually by grinding. This bevel is subsequently refined by honing until a satisfactorily sharp edge is created. The purpose of the sharpening jig is to hold the blade or tool at the desired angle while grinding or honing the bevel. In some cases, the angle of the bevel is critical to the performance of the cutting edge‚Äîa jig allows for repeatability of this angle over a number of sharpening sessions. There are many styles of jig available commercially. Fundamentally, all jigs are similar to allow the user to clamp the blade or tool in some way. The jig then has some means of referencing the clamped blade to the grinding or honing apparatus so that the bevel angle is maintained. One of the more common approaches is to have the jig ride on a roller. These types of jigs are usually used with a sharpening stone or plate, such as a waterstone, oilstone or diamond abrasive surface. Other types of jigs are used to present the blade to the wheel of a grinder. There are generally two types of hand sharpening jigs, push jigs and side to side jigs. Push jigs run perpendicular to the length of the stone and a side to side jig runs with the blade parallel to the length of the stone. Many woodworkers prefer to learn the technique of sharpening by hand. This method does not require a jig, but requires a lot of practice to achieve satisfactory results - especially in situations where the bevel angle is critical.

The carol was first published in 1848 in her hymnbook Hymns for Little Children. A year later, the English organist Henry John Gauntlett discovered the poem and set it to music. Text Hymns for Little Children was a collection of poems aimed to elucidate parts of the Apostles' Creed for use in Sunday schools or in the home - \\"Once in Royal David's City\\" told the story of the Nativity of Jesus to illuminate \\"Born of the Virgin Mary\\". Other well-known hymns in the collection included \\"All Things Bright and Beautiful\\" (\\"Maker of Heaven and Earth\\") and \\"There is a Green Hill Far Away\\" (\\"Was crucified dead and buried\\"). Alexander was married to the Anglican clergyman William Alexander, who was Archbishop of Armagh, and her most famous poems are commemorated in a memorial window at St Columb's Cathedral, Derry.Hymns and Carols of Christmas Irby Henry John Gauntlett was organist at a number of London churches, including St Olave's in Tooley Street, Southwark from 1827 to 1846, Christ Church Greyfriars and Union Chapel, Islington from 1852 to 1861. He edited many hymnbooks and wrote over a thousand hymn tunes, although his setting of \\"Once in Royal David's City\\" to the tune Irby is his most famous. Since 1919, the Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols at the King's College Chapel Cambridge has begun its Christmas Eve service, with Dr Arthur Henry Mann's arrangement of \\"Once in Royal David's City\\" as the Processional hymn. Mann was organist at King's between 1876 and 1929. In Mann's arrangement, the first verse is sung by a boy chorister of the Choir of King's Chapel as a solo. The second verse is sung by the choir, and the congregation joins in the third verse. Excluding the first verse, the hymn is accompanied by the organ. In The English Carol, Erik Routley notes that Mann's unaccompanied arrangement of Gauntlett's original hymn changes the character of the work into one which emphasises the acoustic space of the chapel: \\"with subtle art that arrangement turns the homely children's hymn into a processional of immense spaciousness.\\" According to the tradition of the King's College Choir, the soloist of this hymn is usually chosen on the day of the performance, when the choirmaster decides whose voice is the strongest on the day right before the broadcast. This carol was the first recording that the King's College Choir under Boris Ord made for EMI in 1948.King's College Chapel, Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols References  External links  * Free typeset sheet music from Cantorion.org Category:English Christian hymns Category:Christmas carols Category:1848 songs Category:19th-century hymns Category:Irish Christmas songs ","title":"Once in Royal David's City"},{"id":"2616380","text":"The National Fed Challenge is an academic competition that provides high school students (grades 9-12) with an insider's view of how the United States central bank, the Federal Reserve, makes monetary policy.

It combines the lighter A√©rospatiale Alouette II airframe with Alouette III components and powerplant. The Lama possesses exceptional high altitude performance. The helicopters have been built under licence by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) in India, known as the Cheetah; HAL later developed an upgraded variant, powered by the Turbomeca TM 333-2M2 engine, which is known as the Cheetal. An armed version, marketed as the Lancer, was also produced by HAL. It was also built under licence by Helibras in Brazil as the Gavi√£o. Design and development The SA 315B Lama was originally designed to meet a Nepalese Army Air Service and Indian Air Force requirement for a rotorcraft capable of undertaking operations at hot and high conditions. Both countries possessed extreme mountain ranges in the form of the Himalayas in which even relatively powerful medium-sized helicopters could not be effectively operated within, thus there was an expressed desire for an aerial vehicle capable of operating in this challenging environment.Robinson, Skip. \\"The Mountain King.\\" Vertical, 17 November 2016. To achieve the desired performance, Aerospatiale elected to combine elements of two existing popular helicopters in their inventory, the A√©rospatiale Alouette II and the A√©rospatiale Alouette III to produce a new rotorcraft specialised for high altitude performance. Specifically, the new helicopter, named Lama, was equipped with the Alouette III's Turbomeca Artouste turboshaft powerplant and its dynamic systems, and was furnished with a reinforced version of the Alouette II's airframe.\\"A√©rospatiale SE 313B Alouette II.\\" Flight International, 17 July 1975. p. 84. On 17 March 1969, the first SA315B, powered by an Artouste IIB engine, undertook its maiden flight. On 30 September 1970, the type received its airworthiness certificate, and it was introduced to operational service in July 1971. Due to its favourable high altitude performance, the Lama quickly became popular with operators worldwide, often being deployed within mountainous environments. As with the Alouette series, the type can be fitted for various roles, such as light passenger transport, agricultural tasks, oil-and-gas exploration, aerial firefighting, and other specialised duties. The military variants of the Lama include liaison, observation, photography, air/sea rescue, transport and ambulance duties. The SA315B is particularly suited to mountainous areas due to its performance and can carry underslung loads of up to 1000 kg (2,205 lb). By December 1976, 191 Lamas had been ordered by 68 operators.\\"SA.315B Lama.\\" Flight International, 27 November 1976. p. 1589.

In 2006, HAL proposed a modernised variant to the Indian Army, designated as Cheetal, the principal change of which was the adoption of a modern, more powerful Turbomeca TM 333-2M2 powerplant in the place of the Artouste; HAL promoting the Cheetal's capabilities for operating in high altitude environments, such as the Siachen Glacier. Other improvements include new warning indicates, a cockpit voice recorder, flight monitoring system, artificial horizon, and modernised electronics.

Operational history SA315B Lama, 2003 The Lama was developed specifically to provide a rotorcraft with exceptional high- altitude performance. In practice, the type found considerable use within regions that possessed extensive mountain ranges, such as South America and India, being capable of lifting loads and deploying personnel in areas that had been previously impossible to have otherwise achieved. During 1969, a series of early demonstration flights involving the SA315B were performed in the Himalayas; during one such flight, a single rotorcraft carrying a crew of two and 120kg of fuel landed and then took off at what was then the highest altitude to be recorded, 7,500m (24,605ft). On 21 June 1972, a Lama with a single pilot (Jean Boulet) aboard established a helicopter absolute altitude record of 12,442m (40,814ft), a record which still stands as of December 2018.\\"\\"FAI Record ID #754 Altitude without payload.

During the same flight, the Lama's engine flamed out at the peak altitude of the flight, which led to an inadvertent record being set for the longest ever autorotation after which the rotorcraft was brought to a safe unpowered landing.FAI Records set by SA-315B Days before, the same pilot and aircraft had set a similar record at a higher weight.\\"\\"FAI Record ID #788 - Altitude without payload.

Following in the aftermath of the records set by the helicopter, a major order was placed by the Indian government in 1971. The Indian order included an arrangement for the indefinite licence production of the SA315B to be conducted by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) at their facility in Bangalore, India. The first Indian-assembled SA315B flew on 6 October 1972, with deliveries starting in December 1973; Indian-produced helicopters were given the name Cheetah. Operated by both the Indian Air Force and the Indian Army's Aviation Corps, the Cheetah have proved capable, operating in difficult and remote areas such the mountainous Siachen region, and during times of conflict with neighbouring Pakistan. Cheetahs have also been operated for civil purposes, such as aerial agriculture.Kjelgaard 1982, p. 1774. HAL-built Lamas have also been procured by neighbouring Nepal for military use. Sales have included a quantity of an armed variant, marketed as the HAL Lancer; one batch was reportedly delivered to Nepal between June 2003 and September 2004. The sale of Lancers to Nepal encountered international controversy due to allegations that these rotorcraft have participated in combat operations against members of the Communist Party of Nepal during the Nepalese Civil War.\\"The EU Code of Conduct fails to prevent French Helicopters being produced under licence in India and transferred to Nepal.\\" Amnesty International, September 2004. SA315B Lama, 2003 In addition to India, other countries have participated in licence production activities. In 1978, an export agreement was reached with Brazilian aircraft manufacturer Helibras, under which it would perform domestic assembly of the Lama. Such Helibras- produced SA 315Bs were marketed under the designation Gavi√£o; several examples of which were successfully exported to neighboring Bolivia. In later life, the Lama's commercial appeal waned in favour of the newer Eurocopter AS350 √âcureuil, which had lower maintenance requirements and was capable of higher speeds but incapable of equalling the Lama's high altitude performance. The type remained in commercial service into the 21st century, being only slowly retired as it typically continued to be adequate for its given tasks. According to Vertical Magazine, popular qualities of the Lama included its capable engine, favourable stability while hovering, and its ability to effectively convey payloads at altitude even during peak temperatures. In 2009, due to issues with the newly introduced HAL Dhruv helicopter, the Indian Army increased operational usage of their older Cheetah/Cheetal rotorcraft to meet the temporary shortfall. In September 2012, it was reported that an ever- decreasing amount of spare parts compatible with the Cheetah has led to the type's operators being required to cannibalise helicopters in order to provide components for others.Matthews, Neehlam, \\"Spares Unavailability Threatens India‚Äôs Aging Helo Fleet.\\" AIN Online, 14 September 2012.

The formulation has a longer history, however, see Belchier v Parsons (1754) 96 ER 908, regarding a trustee in bankruptcy The prudent man rule, written by Massachusetts Justice Samuel Putnam (1768-1853), directs trustees \\"to observe how men of prudence, discretion and intelligence manage their own affairs, not in regard to speculation, but in regard to the permanent disposition of their funds, considering the probable income, as well as the probable safety of the capital to be invested.\\" Under the Prudent Man Rule, when the governing trust instrument is silent concerning the types of investments permitted, the fiduciary is required to invest trust assets as a \\"prudent man\\" would invest his own property with the following factors in mind: *the needs of beneficiaries; *the need to preserve the estate (or corpus of the trust); and *the amount and regularity of income. The application of these general principles depends on the type of account administered. The Prudent Man Rule continues to be the prevailing statute in a small number of states, in particular with regards to investments permitted by mutually- chartered institutions such as savings banks and insurance companies. Investment Choices The Prudent Man Rule requires that each investment be judged on its own merits and that speculative or risky investments must be avoided. Under the Prudent Man Rule, certain types of investments, such as second mortgages or new business ventures, are viewed as intrinsically speculative and therefore prohibited as fiduciary investments. As with any fiduciary relationship, margin accounts and short selling of uncovered securities are also prohibited. In contrast with the modern Prudent Investor Rule, isolated investments in a portfolio may be imprudent on individual merits at the time of acquisition, however, as a part of a portfolio, the investment could be prudent. Thus, a fiduciary may not be held liable for a loss in one investment. Trend Since the Prudent Man Rule was last revised in 1959, numerous investment products have been introduced or have come into the mainstream. For example, in 1959, there were 155 mutual funds with nearly $16 billion in assets. By year-end 2000, mutual funds had grown to 10,725, with $6.9 trillion in assets.as reported by CDA/Wiesenberger In addition, investors have become more sophisticated and are more attuned to investments since the last revision of the Rule. As these two concepts converged, the Prudent Man Rule became less relevant. This discounting of the relevance of the prudent man rule is more the result of market forces than it is of the needs of individuals for \\"safety of capital\\". The 10,000+ mutual funds of 2000 have grown to over 15,000 mutual funds in 2006. The Prudent Man Rule in its broader interpretations implies that the fiduciary should perform enough due diligence to ensure that the company meets the investment needs of the investors. Typical due diligence includes discussions with management, vendors and customers, as well as proper evaluation of any risk factors that might affect the performance of the company or its securities. The modern interpretation of the \\"Prudent Man Rule\\" goes beyond the assessment of each asset individually to include the concept of due diligence and diversification. This is sometimes referred to as the \\"Prudent Investor Rule\\". The logic is this: an asset may be too risky to put all your money in (thus failing the Prudent Man Rule) but may still be very diversifying and therefore beneficial in a small proportion of the total portfolio.

The main writer was William Kendall Clarke. The show, originating from Philadelphia and later retitled Martinsville, U.S.A., aired for 15 minutes at 3:00 p.m. ET on weekdays, and starred Susan Peters, who had previously garnered critical acclaim as a film actress before suffering an accidental gunshot wound that left her paraplegic. It was the first program with a handicapped person as the star. Premise Susan Martin is an attorney who moved back to her hometown of Martinsville, Ohio to practice law after she was paralyzed following an auto accident. Soon after Susan returned to town, she had to decide whether or not the family housekeeper, Laura, was an art thief. When not dealing with these matters, Susan agonized over marrying Bill Carter who wanted to have many children, but Susan is unsure if she is able to bear children due to her disability. Cast *Susan Peters as Susan Martin *Mark Roberts as Bill Carter *Helen Ray as Laura *Kathryn Gill as Mrs. Peck *Natalie Priest as the Housekeeper *Betsy Palmer *Joseph Foley *Robert Pike Production Actress Susan Peters had garnered attention in films such as Random Harvest before a 1945 hunting accident left her permanently paralyzed from the waist down. Peters returned to films in 1948, with little success. In 1951 NBC approached her to star in her own series. Peters agreed, later elaborating in an interview: \\"I'll play a woman lawyer who was injured in an automobile accident. It won't be one of those tearful serials, though. Production on the first episode began in Philadelphia on March 5, 1951. The production however was temporarily delayed after Peters developed the flu and laryngitis upon arriving in Pennsylvania. The program was filmed in the studios of WPTZ-TV. Cancellation Some viewers at the time were critical of the series, alleging that NBC had exploited Peters's real-life tragedy. In response, NBC shifted the focus from Susan to other peripheral characters, subsequently retitling the series Martinsville, U.S.A.. However, after these changes failed to attract larger ratings, Colgate, the main sponsor of the series, cancelled it in late 1951, replacing it with The Big Payoff. Peters, who had been in declining health during the series' run, died less than a year after the final episode.

The full name of the municipality was created in 1997 and is meant to highlight the presence within its territory of the 5th century BC Doric temple of Segesta, widely regarded as one of the most intact of its type. Adjoining the temple, on a nearby hilltop, there is a 2nd-century Roman amphitheater. History The town developed during the age of the Muslim emirate of Sicily, when it was known as Qal øat Fƒ´mƒ´ (), referring to the defensive castle overlooking the town, now partially restored from ruins. One hypothesis for the castle's name derives it from ‚Äì a stronghold protecting the territory of a Roman period nobleman mentioned by Cicero, Diocles Phimes. Another hypothesis derives it from \\"Castle of Euphemius\\", possibly referring to the 5th-century Byzantine patriarch by that name or, more likely, to the 9th-century Byzaantine commander, who brought Muslim troops to Sicily in 827, helping begin the Muslim conquest of Sicily. Calatafimi's part of Sicily was one of the first to be occupied by the Aghlabids from Ifriqiya in their conquest of the island, and was one of the last centres of Islamic culture after the end of the Norman rule. The excavations near Segesta have revealed a 12th-century Islamic necropolis and mosque. There are also references to an Islamic-period town called Calathamet (Qal øat al-·∏§amma, ), on the border of the territories of Calatafimi and Castellammare del Golfo, possibly equating the modern Terme Segestane. From 1336 until 1860, Calatafimi was a feudal territory under Habsburg and Spanish nobles, despite three attempts to regain an independent status (in 1399, 1412 and 1802). It was on a hill near Calatafimi, called Pianto Romano, that, in 1860, Giuseppe Garibaldi and his Mille first encountered the troops of the Bourbons on a battlefield (see the Battle of Calatafimi). This was the first significant battle for the Italian unification (or Risorgimento) and it was in this battle that Garibaldi was said to have uttered the famous battle cry: \\"Here we make Italy, or we die\\" (in Italian \\"\\"). A memorial, in the form of large stone obelisk containing an ossuary of the remains of those fallen in the battle, currently marks the hilltop. In his later life, the 19th-century English novelist Samuel Butler made annual trips to Calatafimi, and a street of the town was named after him. Summer theatres is held in the Roman amphitheatre at Segesta every other year. A new archaeological museum is being created that will show findings from the Segesta archaeological excavations. Population In 1901 the population of Calatafimi was recorded as 11,426. Subsequent major emigrations due to poverty and unemployment kept the number from growing and, after 1950, the population began decreasing. Prior to 1900, the main destination was Tunisia, later it was the United States and Argentina. After World War II, Canada and Australia became destinations, as did Germany and Great Britain and the major cities of the Italian mainland. On 31 December 2015 there were only 6,712 permanent residents, although the physical size of the town had grown, as families occupied larger residences. Following severe damage in the 1968 Belice Valley earthquake, a new section of town, Sasi, was built on former farmlands about from the old town centre. Main sights =Civil buildings and sites= Segesta Temple of Segesta It is an archeological site including an unfinished Doric temple built between 430-420 BCE, 61 metres long and 26 wide. It is also without a roof: scholars are in disagreement as to whether the temple was deliberately planned this way. Other sights include an amphitheatre, also built by the Greeks at about 400 BC, and a sanctuary. Pianto Romano Pianto Romano, the memorial of the battle of Calatafimi The mausoleum of Pianto Romano is situated on a hill a few kilometres from the town of Calatafimi to the southwest. It is a monument in memory of the Battle of Calatafimi between the Thousand and the Sicilian army (1860). Designed by the architect Enrico Basile, it was inaugurated on May 15, 1892. Castle Eufemio A typical example of Norman-Hohenstaufen defensive architecture, it is located on a hill dominating the town. There are written documents about it only since the middle of the 12th century when Muhammad al-Idrisi, an Arab traveller and geographer, describes it as ‚Äúan ancient and primitive with a populated village‚Äù. In the middle of the 12th century it was one of the imperial castles used by Frederick II's troops against the Muslim rebels. Later it was the castle of the feudal lords of Calatafimi and of the governors who run it on behalf of the Crown for certain periods. In 1282, during the rebellion of the Sicilian Vespers, the Proven√ßal feudal lord Gugliemo Porcelet lived in it; the rebels spared his life and he was sent back to Provence together with his family. Subsequently, it became a military garrison and a prison until 1868, when it was abandoned. Casa Garibaldi museum It is located in via Marconi, near the Town Hall: it was the house of the parish priest Don Antonino Pampalone (1810-1866), a fervent liberal and deputy for Calatafimi at the Sicilian Parliament of 1848. On May 16, 1860 Garibaldi and four of his officers were given hospitality here and on the same day the General spoke, with the applause of the people of Calatafimi, about Italy's unity from its balcony. In July 1862 Garibaldi stayed in this house again and visited Pianto Romano. =Religious buildings= Calatafimi Segesta has about 30 churches in which there are several marble statues from the school of Antonello Gagini and different paintings. The most important are the following: The Mother Church (Chiesa Madre) The Mother Church or San Silvestro Papa (dedicated to Pope Sylvester, the saint), was restored at about 1500. Its origin dates back to the 12th century and is dedicated to Saint Sylvester the Pope, the oldest patron of Calatafimi who, according to the popular tradition, protected the town from the incursions of Muslims who rebelled against the imperial power. As the primitive urban nucleus enlarged and the population increased, the original building was amplified and modified several times between the XV and the 18th century because it was too small to hold the believers. Thanks to its width it was the place of popular assemblies, like the one in 1655 which led to the election of Maria Santissima di Giubino as the patroness of Calatafimi against the invasion of grasshoppers that were destroying crops. The marble polyptych inside the Mother Church The fa√ßade has no decorations. With a nave and two aisles separated by columns, the interior is in Renaissance style, though there are also simple Baroque elements. In the apse there is a marble polyptych, made by Bartolomeo Berrettaro and Giuliano Mancino in 1516. Moreover, the Church hosts a marble sarcophagus with the mortal remains of Giuliano Truglio, dating back to the 18th century. The church of Santissimo Crocifisso It was built to house the so-called \\"Most Holy Crucifix\\" (see Culture) in 1741-1759. It is a sanctuary in Baroque style with Neoclassical influences, situated where once stood the small and ancient Church Saint Catherine of Alexandria. According to tradition, in the sacristy of the latter church, an old wooden Crucifix worked a series of miraculous recoveries. The plan was carried out by Giovanni Biagio Amico, an architect from Trapani. The church has a longitudinal plan with one nave; there are three altars on each side. The high altar is closed by a classical aedicula with a curvilinear tympanum, inserted in the group, with stuccoes and gilt decorations on the walls. Chiesa di San Michele (Saint Michael's Church) Once the devotion for Saint Michael was very deep at Calatafimi and his feast falling on May 8 was accompanied by \\"iorni quindici di franchezza di ogni gabella\\", that is people did not pay the duty on goods for 15 days. This Church, which originally was a property of the confraternity of Saint Michael Archangel,[6] kept the mortal remains of the blessed Arcangelo Placenza from Calatafimi for a certain period, then they were moved to Chiesa di Santa Maria di Ges√π (Alcamo) in Alcamo. In 1596 the confraternity gave the Church to the Friars of the Third Order of Saint Francis who enlarged it and built their monastery next to the Church. As it suffered considerable damages owing to the 1968 Belice earthquake, the present timber- trussed roof is due to a subsequent restoration.[7] The interior of the church, with a nave and two aisles, is in neoclassical and baroque style with three portals.[6] Inside it there is a holy water stoup of the 16th century[6], a statue of Saint Michael Archangel dated 1490 and different stuccoes and paintings.[6] Sanctuary of Maria Santissima di Giubino It is located at about 2 kilometres from Calatafimi Segesta, on the northern side of the hill Tre Croci and is one of the most known Marian sanctuaries in Sicily. Its fame is linked to the memory of the Blessed Archangel Placenza from Calatafimi, who lived here for some time, and to the devotion to the Most Holy Mary of Giubino, patroness of this town. Church of Saint Julian the martyr It dominates piazza Francesco Cangemi and has been a parish church since 1619. The fa√ßade has a stained-glass window with holy motifs and the main door is framed by Corinthian square pilasters, surmounted by a triangular pediment. Internally, the Church houses several wooden statues and paintings. Church of Maria Santissima di Giubino (co-patroness of the town) It was built in 1721 to house an allegedly miraculous marble-relief icon of the Madonna, which is brought to a country chapel during the summer. (A copy of the relief is housed in the Church of St. Joseph in Brooklyn, New York, giving testimony to the large emigrant community of Calatafimesi who lived in Brooklyn in the early 20th century). Ex convento di San Francesco di Assisi (Saint Francis' ex monastery) It was founded by Giovan Giacomo Gullo, baron of Arcauso in 1543, and belonged to the Friars Minor Conventual. After the abolition of the monastery, the building was used as a public school. Today it is the seat of the picturesque and important Ethnic-Anthropological Museum and displays old work-tools, home objects and furniture. In this way it transmits the heritage, customs and memories of past generations, in a direct and effective way. = Other sights = *Segesta archaeological area, including the Doric temple, the amphitheatre and the sanctuary. *Angimb√® Wood, made of cork oaks and holm- oaks. *Santa Maria's pine-wood. *Chiesa del Carmine *Chiesa di Mary Magdalene (former church of Saint Augustine) *Church of the Virgin of Aid *Church of Saint Isidore Agricola *Church of Saint Roch *Church of the Most Holy Mary the Immaculate Conception *Church of Saint Vito *Itinerary of lanes (Itinerario dei Vicoli) Culture Religious events at Calatafimi-Segesta include: *the Most Holy Crucifix: it is held every 5‚Äì7 years from 1 to 3 May. *Corpus Domini *Procession of Our Lady of Assumption: on 15 August. *Procession of Madonna del Giubino: on the fourth Sunday of September. *The festivity in honour of the Blessed Child Mary, held every two years (from 5 to 8 September) in the small Church of Our Lady of Graces. *Procession of the Immaculate (day and night): on 8 December. *The Living Crib.

Approach This approach allows fiduciaries to utilize modern portfolio theory to guide investment decisions and requires risk versus return analysis. Therefore, a fiduciary's performance is measured on the performance of the entire portfolio, rather than individual investments. Adoption As of May 2004, the Uniform Prudent Investor Act has been adopted in 44 States and the District of Columbia. Other states may have adopted parts of the Act, but not the entire Act. According to the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, the most common portion of the Act excluded by states concerns the delegation of investment decisions to qualified and supervised agents. Comparison to Prudent Man Rule The Uniform Prudent Investor Act differs from the Prudent Man Rule in four major ways: #A trust account's entire investment portfolio is considered when determining the prudence of an individual investment. Under the Prudent Investor Act standard, a fiduciary would not be held liable for individual investment losses, so long as the investment, at the time of acquisition, is consistent with the overall portfolio objectives of the account. #Diversification is explicitly required as a duty for prudent fiduciary investing. #No category or type of investment is deemed inherently imprudent. Instead, suitability to the trust account's purposes and beneficiaries' needs is considered the determinant. As a result, junior lien loans, investments in limited partnerships, derivatives, futures, and similar investment vehicles, are not per se considered imprudent. However, while the fiduciary is now permitted, even encouraged, to develop greater flexibility in overall portfolio management, speculation and outright risk taking is not sanctioned by the rule either, and they remain subject to criticism and possible liability. #A fiduciary is permitted to delegate investment management and other functions to third parties. Not adopted by... As of 1995 the following states have not adopted the Uniform Prudent Investor Act or Substantially Similar *Delaware, *Georgia, and *Louisiana.  Suitability  In enacting the Uniform Prudent Investor Act, states should have repealed legal list statutes, which specified permissible investments types. (However, guardianship and conservatorship accounts generally remain limited by specific state law.) In those states which adopted part or all of the Uniform Prudent Investor Act, investments must be chosen based on their suitability for each account's beneficiaries or, as appropriate, the customer. Although specific criteria for determining \\"suitability\\" does not exist, it is generally acknowledged, that the following items should be considered as they pertain to account beneficiaries: * financial situation; * current investment portfolio; * need for income; * tax status and bracket; * investment objective; and * risk tolerance.

KHTI airs a Hot AC music format. It is owned by All Pro Broadcasting, a corporation headed by the estate of Pro Football Hall of Fame member Willie Davis, which also owns several other businesses. KHTI is a sister station to KATY-FM in Temecula, California. History In 1978, 103.9 signed on as KBON with a beautiful music format to represent the rapidly growing Riverside-San Bernardino radio market's full potential. The signal was strong enough to reach the Morongo Basin and the Victor Valley areas. In 1984, KBON changed to an adult contemporary format under the name K-104. In 1987, KBON again changed formats to traditional oldies. On September 1, 1992, KBON became KCKC-FM, making 103.9 a full AM/FM simulcast with KCKC 1350 AM. KCKC had been broadcasting in San Bernardino for 25 years (from 1966 to 1992) with a country music format. On October 31, 1993, KCKC-FM became KABE as it changed to a simulcast of KACE (also on 103.9 FM), which broadcast to the nearby Los Angeles area. Covering most of Los Angeles and the Inland Empire, the simulcast briefly experimented with a hip hop/R&B; format as \\"The New V103.9\\". On October 2, 1994, KABE became KAEV, commensurate with Willie Davis learning that sister station WLUM-FM in Milwaukee had personalities playing uncensored tracks and cursing on-air in late night FCC safe harbor hours, along with personal disapproval of the hardcore rap becoming prevalent in hip-hop. After a transitional format of lighter 'positive' rap, on January 1, 1995, KAEV became KCXX and ended its simulcast with KACE by flipping to alternative rock as \\"X103.9\\", with the first song played being \\"Closer\\" by Nine Inch Nails (this matched WLUM's post-1995 programming direction). 2015 marked KCXX's 20th (and, as it would turn out, last) year as an alternative station. On December 21, 2015, KCXX announced it would end its alternative format the following morning after two decades, citing falling ratings and increased Internet music services for the reasoning behind the change. On December 22, 2015, at 7 a.m., after playing \\"Snuff\\" by Slipknot, KCXX flipped to Rhythmic Hot AC as \\"Hot 103.9.\\" The first song on \\"Hot\\" was \\"Time of Our Lives\\" by Pitbull. The station changed its call sign to KHTI on the same day as the flip.X103.9 Becomes Hot 103.9 An automated alt-rock format continued as a separate mobile app under the former X103.9 brand, but the mobile app has been removed from app store from Google and Apple as of May 2018. As of fall 2018, the station has reverted to a more conventional hot adult contemporary format.

During that time, the Cardinals rose from languishing as one of the National League's doormats to a premier power in baseball, winning nine NL pennants and six World Series championships. Breadon also had the highest regular season winning percentage of any owner in franchise history at .570. His teams totaled 2,470 wins and 1,830 losses. Successful Pierce-Arrow dealer Born in New York City and raised in a working-class family in Greenwich Village, Breadon moved to St. Louis at the turn of the 20th century and entered the automobile industry by opening a repair garage. Moving into sales, he founded the Western Automobile Company,Newspapers.com prospered as the owner of Pierce-Arrow dealerships and became a self-made millionaire. In 1917, he also became a minority investor ‚Äì for $2,000 ‚Äì in the Cardinals, then a struggling, second-division team chronically strapped for resources. But the club's enterprising young president, Branch Rickey, discovered that the team could compete successfully against richer opponents by developing its playing talent on an assembly line of minor league teams, from Class D to Class AA (then the highest-ranking minor league level), that it owned and controlled. This was the creation of the farm system, perfected by the Cardinals and ‚Äî when the Redbirds came to dominate the National League ‚Äî copied by the 15 other MLB teams. President/owner of the Cardinals Rickey also served as manager of the Cardinals from 1919‚Äì25, and Breadon, who had bought out most of his partners to become majority owner, succeeded him as club president in 1920. In , on May 31, Breadon moved Rickey into the front office full-time as business manager ‚Äî general manager in contemporary terms ‚Äî and promoted star second baseman Rogers Hornsby to playing manager. The move was highly successful. Rickey would forge a Baseball Hall of Fame career as a general manager, while, in 1926, Hornsby's Redbirds won the franchise's first-ever National League pennant and World Series championship, a seven-game triumph over the New York Yankees of Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig. But during the offseason, Breadon traded Hornsby to the New York Giants, the result of a heated confrontation between owner and player-manager in September 1926 over the playing of exhibition games during the September pennant race.Lowenfish, Lee, Branch Rickey: Baseball's Ferocious Gentleman. Lincoln, Neb.: University of Nebraska Press, 2007. Page 162 Rickey worked for Breadon until the end of 1942 and enjoyed wide-ranging authority, but Breadon always reserved the right to choose the team's field manager. In addition to Hornsby, he would select men such as Bill McKechnie, Billy Southworth, Gabby Street, Frankie Frisch (obtained from the Giants in the Hornsby trade) and Eddie Dyer to run the Cardinals' bench. All save McKechnie (the Cards' losing skipper in the 1928 World Series) won world championships for St. Louis, and McKechnie (like Southworth) was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame as a manager. (Hornsby and Frisch were elected to the Hall of Fame on the strength of their brilliant playing careers.) Built NL power Under Breadon, the Cardinals ruled the baseball world in 1926, 1931, 1934, 1942, 1944 and 1946, and earned NL pennants in , and . In addition to Hornsby and Frisch, they would feature such standout players as Jim Bottomley, Chick Hafey, Dizzy Dean, Pepper Martin, Joe Medwick, Johnny Mize, Enos Slaughter, Marty Marion, Red Schoendienst, Stan Musial, Terry Moore, Harry Brecheen, Howie Pollet, Whitey Kurowski, Murry Dickson, and Walker and Mort Cooper. His Cardinals won more than 100 games four times: the 1931 world champions, and then the juggernaut 1942‚Äì43‚Äì44 teams of the World War II era that won 106, 105 and 105 games in consecutive years, along with their three NL pennants and two World Series championships. The 1942 Cardinals were the only National League champion to ever defeat Joe McCarthy's Yankees in a Fall Classic, taking the series four games to one. That season marked the last year of the Breadon-Rickey tandem; their relationship had begun to fray during the late 1930s, when Breadon sold his automobile dealerships and became more involved in his baseball team, and Commissioner of Baseball Kenesaw Mountain Landis cracked down on Rickey's farm system, making 74 players free agents. With Rickey's contract as general manager set to expire at the end of October 1942, Breadon notified him that he would have to take a cut in pay. Instead, Rickey moved to the Brooklyn Dodgers, where he would make history as the club's president and top baseball executive. Despite their success on the field, the 1931‚Äì1945 Cardinals were frequently plagued by low attendance. Although they were by far the dominant team, they shared St. Louis, the smallest, two-team market in the major leagues, with the American League Browns. Their home attendance also was devastated by the Great Depression, with the 1934 world champions‚Äîthe colorful \\"Gashouse Gang\\", one of the most memorable teams in MLB historyFeldmann, Doug (2000).

McFarland & Co. ]‚Äîdrawing only 325,000 fans.BaseballAlmanac.com, \\"St. Louis Cardinals Attendance Data\\" Breadon seriously explored selling the team in 1934;Retrosimba (March 19, 2015), \\"Why the Cardinals Considered Relocating to Detroit\\" then, after his Cardinals had defeated the Detroit Tigers in that year's World Series, Breadon, with his connections within the auto industry, openly pondered moving the Redbirds to Detroit.Ferkovich, Scott, \\"The Cardinals Briefly Considered Leaving St. Louis ... and Moving to Detroit\\". VintageDetroit.com Both ideas came to nothing, however; the team remained in St. Louis and continued to struggle at the turnstiles, drawing only 291,000 fans in during a rare losing season, and not reaching pre-Depression attendance levels until the pennant-contending edition. But World War II interrupted the momentum and ‚Äî despite their three pennants and two World Series titles ‚Äî the Cardinals treaded water in attendance, although exceeding the National League average, from 1942‚Äì1945. However, with their on-field success and the advent of radio in the 1930s, they would develop a fanatical regional following, their appeal extending beyond Missouri and throughout the lower Midwest, Arkansas, Louisiana, the Great Plains states and much of the Southwest. Postwar years After Rickey's departure, Breadon played an active role in the Cardinals' baseball operations through World War II and into the postwar era. But, apart from winning the 1946 championship, Breadon's final two years as the Redbirds' owner were fraught with difficulty. The Cardinals remained pennant contenders through (the year of Breadon's death and two years after he sold the club), but off-field issues dogged the franchise. =Mexican League raids= Attendance was about to spike in with another championship team and the postwar baseball boom, but the Cardinals maintained their reputation for a tight-fisted control on player salaries.Gonzalez Echevarria, Roberto (2001), The Pride of Havana: A History of Cuban Baseball, page 21 That season, the \\"outlaw\\" Mexican League, operating outside the \\"organized baseball\\" structure and its reserve clause, signed away three important Cardinal players: starting pitcher Max Lanier, swingman Fred Martin and second baseman Lou Klein. When Lanier defected in May, he had thrown six complete game victories in six starts, with an earned run average of 1.93. The Mexican League might have done even greater damage to the Redbirds. Jorge Pasquel, the league's founder, offered Musial (then making $11,500 a year) a $50,000 bonus to jump the Cardinals; the young superstar was tempted, but rejected Pasquel's offer. Page 114 In June 1946, Breadon flew to Mexico City ‚Äî without the permission of Commissioner of Baseball Happy Chandler and National League president Ford Frick ‚Äî for a \\"fact-finding\\" meeting with Pasquel; the raids on the Cardinals stopped, but Breadon was hit with a $5,000 fine and a 30-day suspension by Chandler, although both punishments were quickly rescinded.Carvalho, John P., Frick*: Baseball's Third Commissioner. Jefferson, NC, McFarland & Company (2016). , pp. 111‚Äì112 Lanier, Klein and Martin, meanwhile, were banned by Chandler from Organized Baseball for jumping their contracts; they would not be reinstated until June 5, 1949. =Abortive strike against Robinson= Then, in 1947, Breadon learned that some of his players planned to strike rather than take the field against Jackie Robinson of Rickey's Dodgers, the first African-American to play Major League Baseball since the 1880s. The idea of a strike had originated with Robinson's disaffected teammate, Dixie Walker, but it had sympathizers across the league and widespread support among the Cardinals. Breadon flew to New York, conferred with NL president Frick, and then met with his team, where he read a strongly worded message from Frick vowing to suspend all the strikers from baseball. The threat then evaporated. Pages 253‚Äì264 =Sale to Saigh and Hannegan= For his entire tenure as owner, the Cardinals played in Sportsman's Park as tenants of the American League Browns. By the 1940s, Breadon chafed at this arrangement, since the Cardinals had long since passed the Browns as St. Louis' favorite baseball team. He set aside $5 million to build a new park, but was unable to find any land. By November 1947, he was facing the prospect of having to pay taxes on his fund unless he started construction on a park. When tax attorney Fred Saigh learned of this, he persuaded Breadon‚Äîwho by this time was terminally ill from prostate cancer‚Äîto sell the Cardinals to him, under the pretense of avoiding the potentially hefty tax bill. To ease Breadon's nerves, Saigh took on another prominent St. Louisan, former Postmaster General Robert Hannegan, as a minority partner. Satisfied, Breadon sold the Cardinals to Saigh and Hannegan for $3 million‚Äìa handsome return on his original investment of 30 years earlier. Breadon died in St. Louis 18 months later at the age of 72. As it turned out, the ballpark fund nearly forced the Cardinals out of town. When the tax dodge that made the purchase possible came to light, Saigh‚Äîwho by this time was sole owner‚Äîwas forced to put the Cardinals on the market. Just as it appeared they were moving to Houston, Texas, Anheuser-Busch and its president, Gussie Busch, stepped in to buy the team in 1953 and keep it in St. Louis.

Described by John Gould in 1837, it is a black and white bird long with a long hooked bill. Its head and throat are black, making a distinctive hood; the mantle and much of the tail and wings are also black. The neck, underparts and outer wing feathers are white. The juvenile and immature birds are predominantly brown and white. As they mature their brown feathers are replaced by black feathers. There are two recognised subspecies of pied butcherbird. Within its range, the pied butcherbird is generally sedentary. Common in woodlands and in urban environments, it is carnivorous, eating insects and small vertebrates including birds. A tame and inquisitive bird, the pied butcherbird has been known to accept food from humans. It nests in trees, constructing a cup-shaped structure out of sticks and laying two to five eggs. The pied butcherbird engages in cooperative breeding, with a mated pair sometimes assisted by several helper birds. The troop is territorial, defending the nesting site from intruders. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the pied butcherbird as being of least concern on account of its large range and apparently stable population. Taxonomy Painting by John Gould The pied butcherbird was first described by the ornithologist John Gould in 1837 as Vanga nigrogularis. The type specimen was collected near Sydney. The species name is from the Latin words niger (black), and gula (throat). Gould described Cracticus picatus in 1848 from northern Australia, calling it \\"A miniature representative of, and nearly allied to, but distinct from, Cracticus nigrogularis.\\" The word picatus is Latin for \\"daubed with pitch\\", hence \\"black patches. This was reclassified as a subspecies of C. nigrogularis. Gregory Mathews described subspecies inkermani from Queensland and subspecies mellori from Victoria and South Australia in 1912, on the basis of smaller and larger size than the nominate subspecies respectively. Both are now regarded as inseparable from the nominate subspecies. Mathews described subspecies kalgoorli from Kalgoorlie in 1912 on the basis of its longer bill than the nominate subspecies, but is regarded today as part of subspecies picatus. Two subspecies are recognised today. The nominate subspecies nigrogularis is found across eastern Australia, and subspecies picatus is found in the Northern Territory, Western Australia and northern South Australia. The latter subspecies has a broader ( wide) white collar and a more whitish rump, with specimens becoming smaller in the more northern parts of the range. The border between the two subspecies lies in the Gulf Country and is known as the Carpentarian Barrier. Although there is a demarcation in physical characters, this is not borne out genetically, and birds from northwestern Australia have affinities with the eastern subspecies. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA sequences indicates the pied butcherbird has expanded rapidly from many refugia during the Pleistocene. The pied butcherbird is one of six (or seven) members of the genus Cracticus, known colloquially as butcherbirds. Within the genus, it is most closely related to the Tagula butcherbird (C. louisiadensis) and hooded butcherbird (C. cassicus). The three form a monophyletic group within the genus, having diverged from ancestors of the grey butcherbird around five million years ago. The butcherbirds, Australian magpie (Gymnorhina tibicen) and currawongs (Strepera spp.) were placed in the family Cracticidae in 1914 by John Albert Leach after he had studied their musculature. American ornithologists Charles Sibley and Jon Ahlquist recognised the close relationship between woodswallows and the butcherbirds in 1985, and combined them into a Cracticini clade, which became the family Artamidae in 1994. \\"Pied butcherbird\\" has been designated the official name by the International Ornithological Committee (IOC). Black- throated butcherbird is an alternative common name, as are Break o'day boy and organbird. Leach also called it the black-throated crow shrike, a name used by Gould for subspecies nigrogularis while calling subspecies picatus the pied crow-shrike. ‚ÄòJackeroo‚Äô is a colloquial name from the Musgrave Ranges in Central Australia. Gould recorded Ka-ra-a-ra as a name used by indigenous people of Darwin. The Ngarluma people of the western Pilbara knew it as gurrbaru.* In the Yuwaaliyaay dialect of the Gamilaraay language of southeastern Australia, it is buubuurrbu. Names recorded from central Australia include alpirtaka and urbura in the Upper Arrernte language. Description Subsp picatus at Slate Range (Gibson Desert) Like other butcherbirds, the pied butcherbird is stockily built with short legs and a relatively large head. It ranges from long, averaging around , with a wingspan and weight of around . The wings are fairly long, extending to half-way along the tail when folded. Its plumage is almost wholly black and white, with very little difference between the sexes. It has a black head, nape and throat, giving it the appearance of a black hood, which is bounded by a white neck collar, which is around wide. The black hood is slightly glossy in bright light, can fade a little with age, and is slightly duller and more brownish in the adult female. The neck collar in the female is slightly narrower at around and is a grey-white rather than white. Several stiff black bristles up to long arise from the lower lores. The upper mantle and a few of the front scapulars are white, contrasting sharply with the black lower mantle and the rest of the scapulars. The rump is pale grey, and the upper tail coverts are white. The tail is rather long, with a rounded or wedge-shaped tip. It has twelve rectrices, which are black in colour. The tail tip and outer wing feathers are white. The underparts are white. The eyes are a dark brown, the legs grey and the bill a pale bluish grey tipped with black, with a prominent hook at the end. The juvenile pied butcherbird has dark brown instead of black plumage, lacks the pale collar and has a cream to buff lores, chin, and upper throat, becoming more brown on the lower throat and breast. Its underparts are off- white to cream. The bill is dark brown. In its first year, it moults into its first immature plumage, which resembles that of the juvenile, but has a more extensive dark brown throat. Its bill is blue-grey with a dark brown or blackish tip. =Voice= Immature bird - City Botanic Gardens - Brisbane, Australia The pied butcherbird has been considered the most accomplished songbird in Australia, its song described as a \\"magic flute\\" by one writer, richer and clearer than the Australian magpie. Song melodies vary across the continent and no single song is sung by the whole population. There is no clear demarcation between simple calls and elaborate songs: duets, and even larger choirs, are common. The species improvises extensively in creating new and complex melodies. One of its calls has been likened to the opening bars of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. Singing often takes place at dawn, and rarely late in the day. Pied butcherbirds sometimes sing on moonlit nights. Three types of song have been described: the day song is the most common, sung by birds alone or in pairs as a chorus or an antiphonal duet, generally over the course of the day and while the birds are in flight. It appears to promote bonding and act as communication. The whisper song is sung more commonly in wet or windy weather, the singer sitting in a tree warbling soft and complex harmonies for up to 45 minutes, often mimicking many other bird species as well as dogs barking, lambs bleating or even people whistling. In the breeding season, pied butcherbirds sing the breeding song at night until dawn, when they switch to the day song. This song is longer and more complex than the day song. In response to threats, pied butcherbirds may chatter or make a harmonic alarm call composed of short, loud descending notes. =Similar species= The black hood helps distinguish the pied butcherbird from other butcherbirds, the Australian magpie and much smaller magpie-lark, the latter of which also has a much smaller beak. It has a higher-pitched call than the grey butcherbird and inhabits more open habitat. The juvenile pied butcherbird resembles the grey butcherbird: it has a buff upper throat and dark brown instead of black plumage. Distribution and habitat The pied butcherbird is found across much of Australia, excepting the far south of the mainland, and Tasmania. It is only rarely recorded in the Sydney Basin, and absent from the Illawarra, Southern Tablelands and south coast of New South Wales. In Victoria it is found along the Murray Valley and west of Chiltern. In South Australia it is not found in the northeast of the state, nor on the Adelaide plain. It is found across Western Australia, though is absent from the Great Sandy Desert. It is generally sedentary across most of its range, with minimal seasonal movements. It is a bird of open sclerophyll forests, eucalypt and acacia woodlands and scrublands, with sparse or no understory, or low cover with shrubs such as Triodia, Lomandra or Hibbertia. It is less common in mallee scrub. In arid areas and northern Australia, it is more restricted to woodland alongside rivers and billabongs. It has become more common in southwest Western Australia with land clearing, though has become rare around Darwin on account of urban development. =Conservation status= The pied butcherbird is listed as being a species of least concern by the IUCN, on account of its large range and stable population with no evidence of any significant decline. Behaviour The pied butcherbird is thought to be monogamous, though its breeding habits have not been much studied. There is evidence of cooperative breeding, with some mated pairs being assisted by up to several other helper birds. These individuals help feed young and defend the nest. These pairs or small groups defend their territory from intruders, mobbing and chasing raptors and other birds, and occasionally dogs or people. They may attack animals (and people) that venture too close to the nest, with one bird coming front-on while the other may approach from behind. The maximum age recorded from banding has been 22 years 1.7 months, for an individual banded in Rockhampton in June 1988 and recovered in August 2010‚Äì7 km away. The bird was injured and had to be euthanased. =Breeding= Rush Creek, SE Queensland, Australia Across most of its range, the pied butcherbird can generally be found breeding from winter to summer; eggs are laid anywhere from July to December, but mostly from September to November, and young can be present in the nest from August till February. There are reports of breeding outside these months, however. The nest is constructed of dry sticks with a finer material such as dried grass, black roly poly (Sclerolaena muricata), bark and leaves forming a cup-shaped interior. It is located in the fork of a tree, often among foliage and inconspicuous. The clutch consists of two to five (most commonly three or four) oval eggs blotched with brown over a base colour of various shades of pale greyish- or brownish-green. Larger clutches have been recorded, such as at Jandowae in Queensland, where two pairs laid eggs and were sharing incubation duties. Eggs of subspecies nigrogularis are larger, at around 33 mm long by 24 mm (1.3 by 0.95 in) wide, while those of subspecies picatus are around 31 mm long by 22 mm (1.2 by 0.85 in) wide. Incubation takes 19 to 21 days, with the eggs laid up to 48 hours apart and hatching at a similar interval. Like all passerines, the chicks are altricial‚Äîthey are born naked or sparsely covered in down and blind. They spend anywhere from 25 to 33 days in the nest before fledging, though may leave the nest early if disturbed. They are fed by parents and helper birds. Brood parasites recorded include the pallid cuckoo (Cacomantis pallidus) and channel-billed cuckoo (Scythrops novaehollandiae). =Feeding= The pied butcherbird is carnivorous, and eats insects such as beetles, bugs, ants, caterpillars, and cockroaches, as well as spiders and worms. It preys on vertebrates up to the size of such animals as frogs, skinks, mice, and small birds such as the silvereye (Zosterops lateralis), house sparrow (Passer domesticus), double-barred finch (Taeniopygia bichenovii), willie wagtail (Rhipidura leucophrys), and grey teal (Anas gracilis) duckling. It has been looked upon favourably by farmers as it hunts such pests as grasshoppers and rodents. Some individuals look for scraps around houses and picnic sites, and can become tame enough to be fed by people, either by hand or by tossing food in the air. The pied butcherbird also eats fruit, such as those of sandpaper figs (Ficus coronata), native cherry (Exocarpos cupressiformis), African boxthorn (Lycium ferocissimum) and grapes (Vitis vinifera), and nectar of the Darwin woollybutt (Eucalyptus miniata). The pied butcherbird often perches on a fencepost, stump or branch while foraging for prey. It generally pounces on victims on the ground and eats them there. At times, it may hop or run along hunting ground-based food, and occasionally seize flying insects. It generally forages alone, or occasionally in pairs. The pied butcherbird has been observed hunting collaboratively with the Australian hobby, either picking off common starlings or rufous-throated honeyeaters disturbed by the larger hobby, or flushing out small birds from bushes, which the larger bird then hunts. The pied butcherbird sometimes stores food items by impaling them on a stick or on barbed wire, or shoving them in a nook or crevice. Cultural significance Several Australian and international composers have been inspired by and written music incorporating the songs of the pied butcherbird, including Henry Tate, David Lumsdaine (who described it as \\"a virtuoso of composition and improvisation\\"), Don Harper, Olivier Messiaen, Elaine Barkin, John Rodgers, Ron Nagorcka, and John Williamson. In the dance 'Bird Song' by Siobhan Davies, the main central solo was accompanied by the call of a pied butcherbird and this same sound provided inspiration to much of the dance, including the improvisational aspects. Composer and researcher Hollis Taylor has studied pied butcherbird song for 12 years, and has released a double CD called Absolute Bird based on fifty-plus pied butcherbird nocturnal solo songs. Taylor's 'Is Birdsong Music? Outback Encounters with an Australian Songbird' offers portraits of the remote locations where the species is found. In the now extinct Warray language spoken on the Adelaide River in Arnhem Land, Cracticus Nigrogularis was known as lopolopo.

She fulfills the stereotypical role of a housewife, and it is strongly suggested that she married Daddy for his money. *Daddy: Mommy's submissive husband. It is suggested that he works a high-paying administrative job. *Grandma: Mommy's mother. She is portrayed as the most intelligent character in the family, and is the only character to physically break the fourth wall. *Mrs. Barker: Mommy's friend. Mrs. Barker is the caricature of the dim-witted socially responsible american housewife. *The Young Man: Ostensibly an itinerant worker, The Young Man enters Mommy and Daddy's apartment looking for work, and is accepted into their family. Overview The play, a satire on American family life, concerns a married couple and their elderly mother. On a particular day, they are visited by two guests who turn their worlds upside down. The central family consists of a Mommy, a domineering wife, Daddy, an emasculated and submissive husband, and Grandma, the half-senile mother of Mommy. The play opens with the three of them discussing Mommy's day around a pile of boxes. An honorary member of the community and idol to Mommy, Mrs. Barker, enters and the dialogue continues with the occasional interjection by Grandma. Mommy and Daddy exit, leaving Mrs. Barker and Grandma alone. Grandma apparently knows why Mrs. Barker has been asked to come by and explains to her that Mommy and Daddy had adopted a son from her many years previously. As the parents objected to the child's actions, they mutilated it as punishment, eventually killing it. After Mrs. Barker exits, a Young Man appears at the door, looking for work. After hearing his life story, Grandma realizes that this Young Man, whom she dubs \\"The American Dream,\\" is the twin of Mommy and Daddy's first child. As the first child was mutilated, he too suffered pain and has been left as an empty shell of a man. After seeing this Young Man as a way out, she moves her things and leaves. The Young Man is introduced to the family as a suitable replacement for the original child. The play ends with Mommy and Daddy celebrating the Young Man's arrival, with Grandma already forgotten. Albee explores not only the falsity of the American Dream but also the status quo of the American family. As he states in the preface to the play, \\"It is an examination of the American Scene, an attack on the substitution of artificial for real values in our society, a condemnation of complacency, cruelty, emasculation, and vacuity; it is a stand against the fiction that everything in this slipping land of ours is peachy-keen.\\" Press notes state: \\"It is a ferocious, uproarious attack on the substitution of artificial for real values, a startling tale of murder and morality that rocks middle-class ethics to their complacent foundations. In it, Albee explores the hollowness of the American dream, as well as the fallacy of the ideal American family.\\"Gans, Andrew. \\"Albee's 'Dream' and 'Sandbox' Begin Previews March 21\\" Playbill, March 21, 2008 Critical response David Finkle, in reviewing the 2008 production for TheatreMania, wrote that the play takes on Albee's \\"abiding theme: the stultifying American family....Mommy and Daddy are, to say the least, unsympathetic.... the major impression with which an Albee fan will leave is how solidly in place Albee's need was to work out his psychological knots as an adopted child -- and how strong that compulsion has remained for almost 50 years. It now seems almost an after-thought that he's made theatergoers everywhere the lucky beneficiaries of his obsessive search for psychic balm.\\"Finkle, David. \\"Review. 'The American Dream' and 'The Sandbox'\\" theatermania.com, April 1, 2008 The \\"New York Theatre Guide\\" reviewers wrote of the 2008 production: \\"Though hardly great theater, these one-acts give important insight into the budding playwright... Though 'American Dream' and 'Sandbox' are autobiographical, Albee is too complex a playwright to leave it there. He is not just trashing parents who didn't understand the unconventional young man they adopted, he is also trashing The American Dream, vilifying the people who took 'Father Knows Best,' 'Donna Reed,' and 'The Ozzie and Harriet Show' as their model for the best of all possible worlds... Taking our norms and turning them inside out and upside down is Albee's signature, and 'The American Dream' reminds us that we must constantly refine our own version of the American Dream before we eventually dive into the finality of the Sandbox.\\"Mehlman, Barbara and Manus, Geri. \\"Review\\" newyorktheatreguide.com, accessed November 23, 2015 Hilton Als, in The New Yorker, wrote about the play : \\"...is less about what happens than about how it happens‚Äîwhich, in the theatre, means how it‚Äôs said. Mommy and Daddy speak in rhythmic banalities. Greeting a guest named Mrs. Barker, Mommy asks, progressively, if she‚Äôd like a smoke, a drink, to cross her legs, and to remove her dress. Mrs. Barker responds to each inquiry in the same way: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mind if I do.‚Äù Albee is showing us the trauma of repetition: the noxious glue that holds his married couples together, despite their rage‚Äîor because of it.\\"Als, Hilton. \\"Just the Folks\\" New Yorker, December 1, 2014 Notes References *Albee, Edward.

Previously placed in the genus Avicularia, C. versicolor is native to Martinique in the Caribbean Sea. Antilles pinktoe tarantulas are arboreal (tree-dwelling). They spin elaborate funnel webs in which they spend most of their time. Spiderlings of C. versicolor are bright blue, with a black tree trunk pattern on the abdomen. As they grow, they gradually lose their blue coloration; the carapace turns green, the abdomen red, and the legs turn green with pink tarsi and a covering of purple hairs. Males usually are slightly more brightly colored than females. As in most tarantula species, males do not grow as large as females, and their abdomens are smaller than those of females, even in proportion to their size. Taxonomy Mygale versicolor was first described by Charles Athanase Walckenaer in 1837. In the description, Walckenaer used a female he said was from Guadeloupe and a male from Brazil. However, the two actually belong to different species. This causes nomenclatural problems, since when later workers synonymized Mygale versicolor or transferred it to another genus, they may have ultimately based their decisions on either the female or the male. Caroline Fukushima and Bertani in 2017 treated Mygale versicolor as the female specimen (actually believed to be from Martinique), designating a neotype. On this basis, it is synonymous with Avicularia rutilans. It was transferred to the genus Avicularia by Eug√®ne Simon in 1892 and to the new genus Caribena in 2017.

The game was created in collaboration between the film's director Peter Jackson and the game's director Michel Ancel. The game follows New York scriptwriter Jack Driscoll through Skull Island, as he attempts to save love interest Ann Darrow who has been sacrificed by the island's natives to the giant gorilla King Kong. The game allows players to play as both Jack Driscoll and King Kong. Players use firearms and spears as Jack; and punch, grab and use objects/corpses as Kong, to defend against and fight creatures on Skull Island. The King Kong segments are played from a third-person perspective, while the Jack levels are played from a first-person perspective. The game de-emphasizes the role of a heads-up display, with the developers explaining that this conceivably would help players to get further immersed into the game (although the HUD can be turned on in the settings). It was released on PC and sixth generation platforms and a Nintendo DS version on November 21, 2005, while it was released on November 22, 2005, on the Xbox 360 as a launch title, as well as a Game Boy Advance version titled Kong: The 8th Wonder of the World; also, a PlayStation Portable version was released December 20, 2005. The film's cast members reprise their roles. Upon release, the console and PC versions received positive reviews, with critics praising the game's immersive environments and audio, voice acting (with the cast winning the \\"Best Cast\\" award at the 2005 Spike Video Game Awards) and ability to play as Driscoll and Kong throughout the game. However, the DS version received negative reception due to bugs, poor AI and technical issues, while the PSP version received mixed reviews, with critics liking the inclusion of a multiplayer mode, but criticizing the shorter campaign length. Gameplay In the game, the player assumes the roles of both New York scriptwriter Jack Driscoll and the giant gorilla, King Kong, as they struggle to survive the threats of Skull Island in 1933. Human levels are controlled from a first person perspective. The game de-emphasizes the role of a heads-up display: it lacks a life bar, aiming reticle, and ammunition readout (the ammo readout and aiming reticule can be turned on and off at the player's will, but is disabled by default), further adding to the challenge and encouraging the player to find alternate weapons and techniques. Interspersed with human adventure are levels in which the player controls Kong himself, traversing Skull Island's unique geography, battling various giant monsters while defending Ann. The Kong levels take place in a third-person view, as the player directs Kong to punch, grab and use objects/corpses as weapons. He can also bite, climb, charge, hurl enemies and even pound his chest to go into fury mode. When Kong is sent into fury mode, the sky becomes tinted with a golden hue and Kong becomes more powerful and less vulnerable to attack. Many of the Kong sequences fulfill the role of boss fights, as the giant ape is able to effectively battle the gigantic creatures that Jack's weapons cannot harm. The game features an alternate ending where Kong can be saved during the Empire State Building shootout and safely returned to Skull Island. The ending was approved by Peter Jackson. To unlock the alternate ending, players must complete the entire game and then go back and play through various maps and earn a total of 250,000 points. It can also be accessed by using the cheat codes. Plot In 1933, film director Carl Denham (Jack Black), has acquired a mysterious map, which reveals the secret location of a large island known as Skull Island, located in the far reaches of the Pacific Ocean. Carl hires playwright Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody) to write his script and plucks a starving, out-of-work actress Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts) to play the part of leading lady and a tramp steamer called the Venture to take them to the island. The ship, controlled by Captain Englehorn (Thomas Kretschmann) arrives at the island on October 12. Three lifeboats containing the cast, crew and sailors are dispatched to the island. Due to stormy seas and large rocks, the lifeboat containing Jack, Carl, Ann, Hayes (Evan Parke), and Briggs smashes into a chunk of rocks, killing Briggs. Hayes shoots out a distress signal, causing Englehorn to come looking for them via the ship's plane and drop ammo supplies for them. The group, after fighting off giant crabs, head onto a rocky outcrop. Carl suggests shooting some test shots for his movie, asking Ann to scream. Her classic damsel-in-distress style wailing is answered by a loud roar. The party progresses forward, meeting up with the second lifeboat containing Preston (Colin Hanks), Jimmy (Jamie Bell) and Lumpy (Andy Serkis), although it cannot land because of the strong current of the sea. The team continue traversing the island, battling with many vicious creatures, and are eventually forced to split up. After a huge battle with Megapedes and Scorpiopedes through a seemingly abandoned village, Jack and Ann are captured by the island natives. Jack is tied to a stake, and watches helplessly as Ann is taken by Kong, a gorilla during a native sacrifice. Carl saves Jack and the two give chase. During the dangerous journey through the jungle, they have an encounter with Venatosaurus who are feasting on a dead Ferrucutus. Jack and Carl reunite with Hayes after defeating a pack of Venatosaurus with a .45 caliber Thompson submachine gun. Soon after, they find Preston, Lumpy, Jimmy and Baxter, who are crossing a bridge, but they are attacked by a Vastatosaurus rex. Lumpy is torn apart, Jimmy and Baxter fall down into the crevasse, but Preston gets to the other side. Jack is separated from Carl and Hayes, who tell him to continue looking for Ann. Jack eventually finds Ann, but she is kidnapped by a Terapusmordax. Kong comes to the rescue and saves Ann. Jack continues on into the canyon, where he sees a migrating herd of Brontosaurus, and also battles Megapedes and Scorpio-Pedes. A V. rex attacks the sauropods and Jack meets up with Carl and Hayes, and continue on their path. In the jungle, they save Jimmy, who is being attacked by the Venatosaurs. They eventually get on a raft, where Jimmy tells the group that everyone else is dead. After escaping the Skull Islanders, the team are pursued by two V. rexes. Kong battles and kills them. As the team continue their journey, they enter a swamp, and fight against Udusaurs. After leaving the swamp, Kong interrupts their log crossing and tips them into a huge ravine. Carl's camera is broken and he gives up, heading downstream towards the Venture. Jack, Jimmy and Hayes continue their pursuit of Ann. Jack eventually saves Ann from a V. rex, and the party attempt to find a long stretch of water of which Englehorn's seaplane can land on. After fighting off some Venatosaurus and a juvenile V. rex in a cave, and leaving a swamp, they finally come across a long stretch of water. Englehorn lands on the water, but is forced to take flight as a V. rex arrives on the scene and chases the group. Ann signals for Kong to come. Eventually, Kong comes to the rescue while Jack shoots some Terapusmordax to distract the carnivore. As Hayes tries to stop the fight, opening fire on Kong, the V. rex charges at Kong and inadvertently steps on Hayes, injuring him. Jack and Jimmy stand over Hayes, who tells Jimmy before he dies to get back to the ship. Jack and Jimmy fight many raptors and head back to the stretch of water and find the seaplane. Jimmy leaves with Englehorn and Jack climbs up into the mountains to save Ann. Jack discovers Kong's lair and kills two juvenile V. rexes and the Skin-Birds roosting above the entrance. He rescues Ann while Kong fights several cave serpents. After leaving the jungle, Ann is captured by the natives once again but Kong saves her. He then heads for the shore where he gets gassed by sailors. He eventually passes out and is taken to New York City, where he is put on display on Broadway. Kong escapes and rampages New York destroying many army trucks. He eventually finds Ann and takes her up the Empire State Building. He tries to destroy a swarm of biplanes but is eventually shot down. Carl stands beside Kong's body and says \\"It wasn't the airplanes. It was Beauty that killed the Beast.\\" An alternate ending is possible. This ending can be unlocked by gamers when they replay through various maps and earn a total of 250,000 points. If the player defeats enough biplanes as Kong, the army will light up searchlights on the building so that the biplanes can get clearer shots at Kong, causing Jack and Englehorn to appear in the Venture's seaplane. The player will switch to Jack piloting the seaplane and destroying the searchlights, and shooting down the remaining biplanes to save Kong. Although emergency searchlights are set up, Kong climbs down the Empire State Building. Kong is taken back aboard the Venture and is safely returned to Skull Island. Ann and Jack (or Englehorn) on board the seaplane fly around Kong's lair to see Kong one last time to bid farewell to him, as Kong roars triumphantly. The seaplane returns to the departing Venture. Release The Xbox 360 release features improved graphics and audio over the sixth generation console releases. The second PC version, known as the \\"Gamer's Edition\\", (originally only available with select graphics cards and later offered on game download services) also includes these improved features. The \\"Special Edition\\" version of the game was available for a limited time. Along with the two standard game discs, included are a bonus disc, containing concept art and a screensaver, and a making-of disc, containing a featurette with Peter Jackson. There was an error in the printing of the discs and the disc labelled \\"Making of\\" was actually the \\"Bonus\\" disc and vice versa. The signature edition also comes with a Topps trading card of King Kong, a code for a downloadable ringtone, and a cover signed by Peter Jackson. =Technical issues= Symptomatic of early seventh generation console games, the Xbox 360 version is only set up for HDTV, leaving the image on standard-definition TVs very dark and unsatisfactory for gameplay. As a result, Ubisoft recommended fans buy the Xbox version until a fix for the problem was produced. The patch was eventually released. The Xbox version is not backwards compatible with the Xbox 360. In June 2019, Microsoft added the Xbox 360 version to the Xbox One backwards compatible library.Xbox One Backward Compatible Game Library  Xbox The retail PC version utilizes the StarForce copy protection system, which may cause unforeseen difficulties for players, especially those using Microsoft Windows 7. No patch has been released by the publisher to remedy this problem. The Gamer's Edition of the game is playable on Windows 7 and in Windows 10 with no issues. The Xbox 360 version of the game has poorly coded shaders, allowing homebrew and unsigned code to run on the Xbox 360 through modified disc images of the game, which exploited the aforementioned shader engine. Reception Peter Jackson's King Kong was a commercial success, selling more than 4.5 million copies by the end of March 2006. The PlayStation 2 version received a \\"Platinum\\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 300,000 copies in the United Kingdom. The PC and console versions received positive reviews, with critics praising the game's immersive environments, action sequences, and ability to play as two protagonists throughout the game. However, the Nintendo DS version was widely panned by reviewers because of bugs and glitches, poor level design and enemy AI. The DS version was listed in the 'Flat-Out Worst Game' list of GameSpot's Best & Worst of 2005. The PSP version received mixed reception, mainly for a shorter length, as well as cut down features from the console and PC versions. Non-video game publications gave the game generally positive reviews as well. The New York Times gave it a favorable review and stated, \\"The sense of immersion is increased by the game's first-person perspective and an absence of on-screen clutter. There is no health gauge blocking your view; if a dinosaur bites you, your vision blurs, indicating that one more bite will kill you.\\" The A.V. Club gave it a B+ and called it \\"an instant classic.\\" The Sydney Morning Herald gave it three-and-a-half stars out of five and said of the game, \\"With a rather abrupt final sequence it does seem to rush to its climax, but despite its brevity, this is an unforgettable trip through the realm of Kong.\\" Detroit Free Press gave the Xbox 360 version three stars out of four and called it \\"A decent effort. And if you're a gamer who likes movies, this one's got all the cinematic feel and production value of a big-budget film.\\" Maxim, however, gave the PSP version a score of four out of ten and stated that \\"while the PSP version adds a two-player Co-op mode, it also has wonkier controls than its console cousin, which weren't great to begin with.\\" = Accolades = Along with receiving positive reviews, the game and cast received many awards and nominations. {class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" style=\\"border:none; margin:0; - valign=\\"bottom\\" !

It was founded in 1908The Cambridge Encyclopedia of The English Language. Ed. David Crystal. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995. p. 277. as the Simplified Spelling Society. Its aims are to raise awareness of the problems caused by the irregularity of English spelling, and to seek remedies to improve literacy, including spelling reform. The Society publishes leaflets, newsletters, journals, books and bulletins. Its spokespersons feature regularly on TV, radio and in print. The Society considers that the fundamental justification for any changes to traditional English spelling is that it will improve literacy and reduce learning costs. In addition to being faster for children and foreign students to learn, reform must not place unnecessary obstacles in the way of those already familiar with traditional spelling. Aims The Society's main priority at present is to draw attention to the economic and social costs of traditional spelling, with the object of opening up minds to the possibility and desirability of some change. On this matter, the Society believes that recent research, together with the continuing concern of governments in the English-speaking world (ESW) about literacy rates, strengthens its position. In particular it points to evidence that children throughout the ESW take significantly longer than children who speak other major Indo-European languages to learn the basic aspects of reading and writing their native tongue.\\"How do children learn to read? Is English more difficult than other languages\\"? Seymour, Philip H K (2001) presented at the British Festival of Science, Glasgow, Sep. British Journal of Psychology 2003. It quotes evidence that dyslexia is less of a problem in countries such as Italy, which have a highly phonemic spelling system compared with English. (English spelling has the unique disadvantage among Indo-European systems of having letter patterns that represent more than one sound and sounds that can be represented by more than one letter pattern - the so-called \\"spelling double whammy\\".)\\"Understanding English Spelling\\", Masha Bell: p45. pub Pegasus 2004 Finally, it points to a recent studyKPMG Foundation: \\"The long term costs of literacy difficulties\\" December 2006 by the KPMG Foundation that estimates the total costs to the public purse to age 37 arising from failure to read in the primary school years at ¬£1.73 billion to ¬£2.05 billion a year. Specific reform systems Since 1960, the Society has not endorsed any specific alternative English spelling system. However, through its \\"Personal View\\" series, it provides a forum for authors of alternative systems to publish their works and submit them to peer review.Spelling Society : West African & Britic These schemes vary from regularising a few words to a nearly 100% phonemic dictionary key spelling. Most schemes fall between these two extremes. The attitude of the Society to this and other aspects of English spelling is set out in a Position Paper that is accessible on the Society's web site.The Spelling Society : Spelling Society Position Statement Subjects covered include: the objects of the Society, its attitude to alternative systems, the principles to be followed by alternative systems, a response to the attitude that the obstacles to reform are insurmountable, the responsibilities of Government, the question of an International Spelling Commission, how to deal with regional differences in pronunciation, texting, free spelling, synthetic phonics and other teaching aids, the need for further research and the merits of British versus American spellings. In the November 1983 edition of the Society's newsletter, it printed a five-part reform proposal called Stage 1. One of these was Harry Lindgren's SR1 proposal.\\"The Society's 1984 Proposals\\" . Journal of the Simplified Spelling Society (February 1988). In April 1984 they were adopted as the 'house style' of the Society at its yearly meeting. The Society said that the reforms could be used either together or individually (as a step-by- step change).\\"Tough Though Thought - and we call it correct spelling!\\" . Simplified Spelling Society (1984). For a description of Stage 1 see here. Spelling bee protests Protesters from the Society have regularly taken good-humoured action against orthodox English spelling and its promotion (e.g. by demonstrating, most conspicuously in the form of 'BeeMan,' at the annual Scripps National Spelling Bee in Washington, D.C.). Structure The Society is based in the United Kingdom, but has a worldwide membership, including Ireland, the USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. It is governed by a Committee elected at its Annual General Meeting.

It is also known as the asparagus fern caterpillar. It is native to Asia, but has been introduced worldwide and is now found almost anywhere its many host crops are grown. The voracious larvae are the main culprits. In the British Isles, where it is an introduced species and not known to breed, the adult moth is known as the small mottled willow moth. Discovery Thought to have originated in south-east Asian countries, it was first discovered in North America about 1876, when it was found in Oregon, and it reached Florida in 1924. Larva Description The adult is a drab brown or grey moth with a wingspan of 26‚Äì32 mm. Forewing is greyish ochreous in color, washed with dull yellow and sprinkled with black scales. Inner and outer lines are double, indistinct, filled in with pale yellowish color. A dark waved median shade visible before lower half of outer line. Cell is dark brown. Orbicular stigma is pale or bright yellow, and round, whereas reniform has a curved brown lunule in centre. The submarginal line is pale grey. There is the darker shade preceding it with dark streaks between the veins. Terminal spots are black. Hindwings semihyaline are white, with the veins dark brown. All three margins are shaded with fuscous color. Larvae are pinkish brown, clotted with black. Spiracular line pale ochreous, with dark upper edge. They are greenish-brown cutworms, soft and bulging caterpillars with dark longitudinal stripes.Seitz, A. Ed., 1914 Die Gro√üschmetterlinge der Erde, Verlag Alfred Kernen, Stuttgart Band 3: Abt. 1, Die Gro√üschmetterlinge des palaearktischen Faunengebietes, Die palaearktischen eulenartigen Nachtfalter, 1914 Damage The larvae feed on the foliage and fruits of plants, and can completely defoliate small ones. Smaller larvae devour the parenchyma of leaves, so all that remains is the thin epidermis and veins. Larger larvae tend to burrow holes through thick areas of plants. For example, they will burrow straight into a head of lettuce rather than neatly removing tissue from one particular leaf, rendering the produce unmarketable. Larvae also attack buds and new growth on plants, preventing flowers from opening, new leaves from sprouting, and vegetables from developing. As the smaller larvae move about they leave strands of silk behind, netting the leaves with a silvery film. Illustration Ecology The wide host range of the beet armyworm includes asparagus, beans and peas, sugar and table beets, celery, cole crops, lettuce, potato, tomato, cotton, cereals, oilseeds, tobacco, cannabis, many flowers, and a multitude of weed species. The beet armyworm does not tolerate cold. It can overwinter in warm areas, such as Florida and Hawaii, but in colder areas, it dies off during the winter and the region is reinvaded by the adult moth as the weather warms and crop plants sprout. Control Pheromone traps and mechanical hand picking of adults and caterpillars are extensively used. Parasitoids such as Chelonus insularis, Cotesia marginiventris, Meteorus autographae, Lespesia archippivora lay eggs on the caterpillars, and their larvae feed and emerge. Predators like Orius sp., Geocoris sp., Nabis sp., Podisus maculiventris are also effective controlling measures. Pupal stages can be eliminated by introducing Solenopsis invicta to the field. Apart from biological control, many chemical pesticides are extensively used. Larvae are susceptible to neem products. Eggs can be killed by using petroleum oil concentrations. Applying cottonseed oil to leaves can eliminate both eggs and larvae.

It is set in 19th-century England, particularly in London. The main hero is a young English gentleman Arthur Pendennis, who is born in the country and sets out for London to seek his place in life and society. The novel took two years for Thackeray to write and, in line with other Thackeray's works, most notably Vanity Fair, it offers an insightful and satiric picture of human character and aristocratic society. The characters include the snobbish social hanger-on Major Pendennis and the tipsy Captain Costigan. Miss Amory and Sir Francis Clavering are somewhat reminiscent of Becky Sharp and Sir Pitt from Vanity Fair. Plot summary Arthur Pendennis (\\"Pen\\" to his friends) is the only child of a prosperous physician and former apothecary now deceased. He and his foster sister Laura are raised in the village of Fairoaks by his indulgent mother, Mrs. Pendennis. The family has risen to gentility in the past generation or two but is not wealthy: the late Mr. Pendennis left only a house and investments producing about 500 pounds a year. The Pendennises, however, claim descent from an ancient family, and Arthur's uncle Major Pendennis, though he has only his retired Army pay, associates with wealthy and titled people. As Pen and Laura grow up, Mrs. Pendennis tells them she hopes they will marry someday. At age 18, however, Pen falls in love with an actress, Emily Fotheringay (a stage name), who is about ten years his senior. Emily's father, Captain Costigan, believes Pen is rich and wants Pen to marry his daughter, but Pen's mother is horrified. She summons Major Pendennis from London, and the Major derails the marriage simply by telling Costigan his nephew is not rich. Emily jilts Pen. Pen, heartbroken, leaves home to study at St Boniface's college in Oxbridge. There he lives extravagantly, unwittingly causing his mother and Laura to live in near poverty. After two years, Pen fails his final examination and remorsefully returns home where, unfortunately, his mother and Laura easily forgive him and Laura sacrifices her small personal fortune to pay Pen's debts. He soon returns to Oxbridge, retakes the exam, and obtains a degree, but returns to Fairoaks as his mother thinks earning a living is both beneath her son and harmful to his health. Soon a large house in the neighbourhood that has stood empty for years is reoccupied by its owners, the Clavering family, consisting of Sir Francis, a baronet and Member of Parliament addicted to gambling; his rich and kindly but low-born wife, whose father earned his fortune in India; their young son; and Lady Clavering's daughter from her first marriage, Blanche Amory. The Pendennises become friendly with the Claverings and Pen becomes infatuated with Blanche, but the flirtation doesn't last long. To please his mother, Pen at this point languidly proposes to Laura but she turns him down essentially because she thinks he's not mature enough. Pen then sets out for London, where he meets George Warrington, a journalist, with whom Pen takes cheap lodgings and who helps Pen get started as a writer. Pen achieves some success and starts to support himself, swearing he'll take no more of his mother's or Laura's money. The Clavering family also comes up to London, where they live very well, and Blanche continues to flirt with Pen and many other men. One of them, Pen's college friend Henry Foker, falls in love with Blanche but cannot propose to her as his father will disinherit him unless he marries his cousin Ann. Pen‚Äîby now rather cynical about love and life‚Äîtoys with the idea of a marriage of convenience to Blanche, and his uncle encourages him in this, but‚Äîpartly because he knows Harry Foker loves Blanche‚ÄîPen doesn't propose. Foker leaves England for a year or two, unable to marry Blanche but unwilling to marry his cousin. A new character, Colonel Altamont, is introduced at this point: he knows a secret about the Clavering family and uses it to extort money from the baronet. Major Pendennis meets Colonel Altamont, recognises him from his Army service in India, and knows \\"Altamont\\" is Lady Clavering's supposedly dead first husband Mr. Amory. He is an escaped convict and a murderer as well. Major Pendennis, however, doesn't act on his knowledge. In addition to being blackmailed, Sir Francis Clavering loses a tremendous sum of money at the races and hides from his wife and creditors in an obscure part of London. Thackeray's dedication to his friend John Elliotson, the editor of The Zoist‚Äîthe model for Dr Goodenough, in The Adventures of Philip (1862)‚Äîwho attended him when suffering a life-threatening illness 1849.Schneck, J.M., \\"John Elliotson, William Makepeace Thackeray, and Doctor Goodenough\\", International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis, Vol.11, No.2, (April 1963), p.122-130. doi=10.1080/00207146308409236 Meanwhile, Pen meets Fanny Bolton, who is pretty and young, but ignorant and lower-class. They fall in love a little, but after a very short and innocent relationship, Pen decides not to see her any more for the good of both. Brooding and keeping to his comfortless room to avoid seeing Fanny, Pen falls very ill. When malicious gossip reaches Helen and Laura that Pen is \\"entangled\\" with a girl of low station, they rush to his side: they find Fanny in his room, where she has just arrived to nurse him, but Helen and Laura think the worst and treat Fanny very rudely. Pen, unconscious, is unable to defend Fanny and himself. Recovering after several weeks of illness, Pen takes a journey with his mother, Laura, and Warrington, who falls in love with Laura but cannot marry her because of his own catastrophic early marriage. (He is separated from his venal wife and her children‚Äîof whom he is only legally, not biologically, the father. He supports them but does not see them, and has no ambition because if he earns more money, his wife will demand it.) Helen's health deteriorates because of her belief in Pen's immoral connection with Fanny. Pen finally discovers how Helen treated Fanny; he is very angry at his mother and tells her he and Fanny are innocent. She is overjoyed to hear it, and soon mother and son forgive each other. Helen's health is nevertheless too much shaken and she dies soon afterward. Pen thus comes into possession of the family property of 500 pounds a year. He leases his house at Fairoaks to tenants and returns to London, while Laura goes to live as companion to a Lady Rockminster. Pen does send a small amount of money to Fanny Bolton with his thanks; she eventually marries a Mr. Huxter (who had started the gossip about her and Pen). Major Pendennis, still hoping to arrange a profitable marriage between Pen and Blanche Amory, meets Sir Francis and threatens to divulge his secret‚Äîthat he is not really married to Lady Clavering‚Äîif Sir Francis will not retire and turn over his seat in Parliament to Pen. Sir Francis consents. Major Pendennis' shrewd valet Morgan overhears the conversation and makes plans to extort everyone‚Äîthe Major, Pen, Altamont, Sir Francis, and Lady Clavering. When Morgan tries this on Major Pendennis, however, the Major won't stand for it, as he has as much to threaten Morgan with (theft) as Morgan has to threaten others with. At this point, Pen has finally become engaged to Blanche though they do not love each other. Then he learns, through Morgan, of the scandal concerning the Claverings. Pen does what he considers the honourable thing: he maintains his engagement with Blanche, but refuses her family money and the seat in Parliament. Now Henry Foker comes back into the picture: his father has died and his fiancee-cousin Ann has eloped with another man, leaving Harry rich and free to marry as he likes. He returns to England and immediately proposes to Blanche. She accepts because he is richer than Pen. On learning that Blanche has broken their engagement, Pen proposes to Laura, whom he has come to love, and is accepted, because she has long loved him‚Äîeven when she refused his first marriage proposal. The secret of the Clavering family finally becomes known to everybody and Henry Foker breaks his engagement to Blanche‚Äînot because of her disreputable father, but because she deceived him and doesn't love him. There is one final surprise: Altamont/Amory, although he is Blanche's father, was bigamously married to several women before he \\"married\\" Blanche's mother, so the Clavering marriage is legal after all‚Äîbut Blanche is illegitimate. Blanche leaves for Paris, where she apparently marries a con man. Foker remains unmarried. Pen and Laura marry; soon their income increases, and he enters Parliament through his own honest efforts.

In four dimensions, the minimal N=1 supersymmetry may be written using a superspace. This superspace involves four extra fermionic coordinates \\\\theta^1,\\\\theta^2,\\\\bar\\\\theta^1,\\\\bar\\\\theta^2, transforming as a two-component spinor and its conjugate. Every superfield‚Äîi.e. a field that depends on all coordinates of the superspace‚Äîmay be expanded with respect to the new fermionic coordinates. There exists a special kind of superfields, the so-called chiral superfields, that only depend on the variables \\\\theta but not their conjugates. The last term in the corresponding expansion, namely F \\\\theta^1\\\\theta^2, is called the F-term. Applying an infinitesimal supersymmetry transformation to a chiral superfield results in yet another chiral superfield whose F-term, in particular, changes by a total derivative. This is significant because then \\\\int{d^4x\\\\, F(x)} is invariant under SUSY transformations as long as boundary terms vanish. Thus F-terms may be used in constructing supersymmetric actions.

Most of the north-south signed route is an urban four-lane highway which passes through both commercial and residential properties. For some of its path, SR 444 passes through Wright- Patterson Air Force Base. The highway was first signed in 1959 on much the same alignment as today. SR 444 replaced the SR 4 designation of the highway, which dated back to 1927. In 1927, SR 4 replaced SR 52, which was established in 1923. The northern terminus was moved to its current location when a section of Interstate 675 (I‚Äì675) opened in 1976. In 2012 a section of the road was rerouted away from the base, using city streets in Fairborn. Route description SR 444 begins at an interchange on SR 4, in Montgomery County. The highway heads southeast as a four-lane divided highway, passing through woodland and entering Greene County. The road passes through Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, then curves northeast, having an interchange with SR 844\\\\. SR 444 turns southeast crossing a railroad track, before turning northeast again, as a two-lane highway. The highway heads northeast through Fairborn, passing residential properties, before curving due north and becoming a four-lane undivided highway. As the highway heads north it crosses the railroad track again. The route turns due west towards the base, before turning due north. SR 444 begins a concurrency with SR 235, west of downtown Fairborn. The concurrency heads northeast, passing through commercial properties, before SR 235 turns due north. SR 444 continues northeast, passing through commercial properties, before becoming a two-lane highway. As a two-lane highway SR 444 passes through woodland, before having an interchange with I‚Äì675. This interchange is the northern terminus of SR 444. SR 444 is designated \\"Freedom Memorial Highway\\", in honor of the 52 U.S. hostages held for 444 days during the 1979-1981 Iran hostage crisis and of the eight service members who died during a 1980 rescue attempt. The entire length of SR 444 is part of the National Highway System, a system of routes important to the nation's economy, mobility and defense. The highway is maintained by the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT). History In 1923 the route that became SR 444 was signed as SR 52. SR 52 was changed to SR 4 in 1927. SR 444 was originally signed in 1959, from its current southern terminus to Interstate 70, at the time it was U.S. Route 40.

The name Dervorguilla or Devorgilla was a Latinisation of the Gaelic Dearbhfhorghaill (alternative spellings, Derborgaill or Dearbhorghil). Family Dervorguilla was one of the three daughters and heiresses of the Gaelic prince Alan, Lord of Galloway. She was born to Alan's second wife Margaret of Huntingdon, who was the eldest daughter of David, Earl of Huntingdon and Matilda (or Maud) of Chester. David in turn was the youngest brother to two Kings of Scotland, Malcolm IV and William the Lion. Thus, through her mother, Dervorguilla was descended from the Kings of Scotland, including David I. Dervorguilla's father died in 1234 without a legitimate son (he had an illegitimate son Thomas). According to both Anglo-Norman feudal laws and to ancient Gaelic customs, Dervorguilla was one of his heiresses, her two sisters Helen and Christina being older and therefore senior. Because of this, Dervorguilla bequeathed lands in Galloway to her descendants, the Balliol and the Comyns. Dervorguilla's son John of Scotland was briefly a King of Scots too, known as Toom Tabard (Scots: 'puppet king' literally \\"empty coat\\"). Life The Balliol family into which Devorguilla married was based at Barnard Castle in County Durham, England. Although the date of her birth is uncertain, her apparent age of 13 was by no means unusually early for betrothal and marriage at the time. In 1263, her husband Sir John was required to make penance after a land dispute with Walter Kirkham, Bishop of Durham. Part of this took the very expensive form of founding a College for the poor at the University of Oxford. Sir John's own finances were less substantial than those of his wife, however, and long after his death it fell to Devorguilla to confirm the foundation, with the blessing of the same Bishop as well as the University hierarchy. She established a permanent endowment for the College in 1282, as well as its first formal Statutes. The college still retains the name Balliol College, where the history students' society is called the Devorguilla society and an annual seminar series featuring women in academia is called the Dervorguilla Seminar Series. While a Requiem Mass in Latin was sung at Balliol for the 700th anniversary of her death, it is believed that this was sung as a one-off, rather than having been marked in previous centuries. Devorguilla founded a Cistercian Abbey 7 miles south of Dumfries and Galloway Scotland, in April 1273. It still stands as a picturesque ruin of red sandstone. It is claimed that she was also responsible for the establishment of the first library in Dundee.Scott, Andrew Murray (2003), Dundee's Literary Lives, Volume 1: Fifteenth to Nineteenth Century, Abertay Historical Society, p. 79 alt= When Sir John died in 1269, Dervorguilla had his heart embalmed and kept in a casket of ivory bound with silver. The casket travelled with her for the rest of her life. In 1274‚Äì5 John de Folkesworth arraigned an assize of novel disseisin against Devorguilla and others touching a tenement in Stibbington, Northamptonshire. In 1275‚Äì6 Robert de Ferrers arraigned an assize of mort d'ancestor against her touching a messuage in Repton, Derbyshire. In 1280 Sir John de Balliol's executors, including Devorguilla, sued Alan Fitz Count regarding a debt of ¬£100 claimed by the executors from Alan. In 1280 she was granted letters of attorney to Thomas de Hunsingore and another in England, she staying in Galloway. The same year Devorguilla, Margaret de Ferrers, Countess of Derby, Ellen, widow of Alan la Zouche, and Alexander Comyn, Earl of Buchan, and Elizabeth his wife sued Roger de Clifford and Isabel his wife and Roger de Leybourne and Idoine his wife regarding the manors of Wyntone, King‚Äôs Meaburn, Appleby, and Brough-under-Stainmore, and a moiety of the manor of Kyrkby-Stephan, all in Westmorland. The same year Devorguilla sued John de Veer for a debt of ¬£24. In 1280‚Äì1 Laurence Duket arraigned an assize of novel disseisin again Devorguilla and others touching a hedge destroyed in Cotingham, Middlesex. In 1288 she reached agreement with John, Abbot of Ramsey, regarding a fishery in Ellington. In her last years, the main line of the Royal House of Scotland was threatened by a lack of male heirs, and Devorguilla, who died just before the young heiress Margaret, the Maid of Norway, might, if she had outlived her, have been one of the claimants to her throne. Devorguilla was buried beside her husband at New Abbey, which was christened 'Sweetheart Abbey', the name which it retains to this day. The depredations suffered by the Abbey in subsequent periods have caused both graves to be lost. A replica is to be found in the covered south transept.

Historical notes *In 1619, Falling Creek Ironworks (located just east of the modern-day Jefferson Davis Highway) became the first iron furnace in North America. The site is now part of a park owned by Chesterfield County. *In 1621, Falling Creek was the site of the first lead mines in North America. *From 1750-1781, the port town of Warwick was located at the confluence of Falling Creek with the James River. During this period it was also the site of Chesterfield or Cary's Forge. This was a finery forge used to convert high carbon pig iron to low carbon iron which was built and operated by Archibald Cary of Ampthill Plantation. On April 30, 1781, General Benedict Arnold's British troops burned the town, destroying ships, warehouses, mills, tannery storehouses, and ropewalks. The Lost Town of Warwick no longer exists, but its place in history is noted on a Virginia Historical Marker nearby.

KMB's Trident 3 with Alexander ALX500 body. :For 2-axle, transverse-engined Dennis Trident which is mainly built for the UK market, see Dennis Trident 2. Dennis Trident 3The vehicle type shown on the manufacturer's plate is either \\"TRIDENT\\" or \\"TRIDENT 3\\". (marketed as 3-axle Dennis Trident), is the first low floor tri-axle double-decker bus chassis built by Dennis in the United Kingdom, with a large number purchased by bus companies in Hong Kong, Singapore, the United States and Canada. Design The Trident 3 chassis was developed from Dennis Lance. It had a longitudinally-mounted rear engine, with a radiator mounted on the right hand side of the engine. An auxiliary axle was mounted behind the second axle to cope with the weight at the rear and reduce the rear overhang. Trident 3 was available in 4 different body lengths: 10.3m, 10.6m, 11.3m and 12m. It could be fitted with Alexander ALX500 or Duple Metsec DM5000 bodywork with either a closed top or an open top. =Engine= The engines used for these double-decker buses were all manufactured by Cummins. Earlier models use the M11-305E, a 305 hp engine which complies with Euro II standards, or an ISM-330 330 hp engine for the buses delivered to North America. The M11-305E engine was replaced by the Cummins ISMe Euro III-standard engine in 2001. A 330 hp version (the ISMe330) was used initially, but later models in Hong Kong adopted a 335 hp (ISMe335) version. =Gearbox= For original Euro 2 Cummins M11 Units, the options of gearbox included Voith DIWA 863.3/864.3 and ZF Ecomat 5HP590. For Later Euro 3 Cummins ISMe/ISM Units, the options of gearbox included Voith DIWA 864.3E and ZF Ecomat 2 5HP602C. The prototypes Six prototype Dennis Trident 3 chassis were built in 1996. The first Trident 3 chassis was delivered to Alexander in late 1996 and received a body with the front resembled to R-type design. It was retained by Dennis as a development vehicle. In 2005, it was converted to open top and sold for promotion of British newspaper The Sun. The prototype was sold to a buyer in Hong Kong and arrived Hong Kong in October 2019. The other 5 were all delivered to Hong Kong, two went to Kowloon Motor Bus and three to Citybus. Hong Kong =Kowloon Motor Bus and Long Win Bus= Prototypes The assembly of the first Trident for Hong Kong was finished in February 1997. It has an Alexander ALX500 bodywork and had Kowloon Motor Bus (KMB) air-conditioned bus livery. However, Dennis reserved this bus for tests initially. The second prototype was finished and delivered to Hong Kong in May 1997, also having an ALX500 body and the KMB air-conditioned bus livery. When it arrived Hong Kong, it was repainted with a golden colour. A red line indicating the floor of bus compartment was added, with people-like figures (designed with computers) situated just above the red line. This decoration work was for the purpose of showing that this bus is a \\"Super-low-floor\\" bus, which has better accessibility for passengers. The bus was assigned for several open activities for promotion before getting licensed in September 1997. It entered service two months later and had been in service on route 1A before being reallocated in 2005. KMB adopted the class code ATR for Trident 3, which would also be used to number the production models. The first prototype was delivered to Hong Kong later and entered service in 1999, with fleet number ATR101, meaning it is the 101st Trident 3 registered under KMB. First batch (1997 to 1999) For the first batch, KMB purchased 186 Tridents for its local services, and another 150 for the new Hong Kong International Airport services under the name of Long Win Bus. All 336 buses of this batch are 12 metres in length. The KMB batch is assorted with Alexander and Duple Metsec bodies, while the entire Long Win batch is Alexander-bodied. Furthermore, 25 of the Long Win Tridents were built with coach standard, and are used for express services into the airport. The Long Win batch entered service first between 1997 and 1998, followed by the KMB batch from September 1998 to 1999. KMB adopted the code ATR for its own Tridents, and assigned the code LW for the Long Win batch with ordinary standard (The numbering of LW class starts from 11, continuing from the 10 Volvo Olympians acquired by Long Win earlier in 1997). The coaches were assigned with the fleet code LWA. Later, Long Win has its fleet number system revised, with the ordinary Tridents getting 1xx or 2xx fleet numbers, while the \\"coaches\\" got 5xx fleet numbers. Further purchase (1999 to 2001) Several KMB Trident 3's at Wan Chai Ferry Pier, Hong Kong. The next batch of Tridents for KMB consists of 160 Duple Metsec-bodied productions. The first 50 of them have a length of 10.6 metres (the code ATS was being assigned for them), and entered service between late 1999 and 2000. These buses are the last batch of KMB buses fitted with plastic route number and destination displays. The next 110 of them are again 12 metres in length, and fitted with electronic route displays (This became the standard of all future buses bought by KMB). Another 50 Alexander-bodied 10.6m Tridents entered KMB fleet in 2001. These Tridents' Alexander bodies were of a modified model, and all of them have electronic route displays. Two of them were experimentally fitted with Cummins ISMe Euro III standard engines and have special livery. Last batch (2002 to 2003) The last batch for KMB consists of 150 Alexander-bodied Tridents. These buses are fitted with electronic displays and Cummins ISMe Euro III standard engines, and have their bodies similar to the last 10.6-metre batch. 50 of the Tridents are 10.6 metres long, while the other 100 are 12 metres long. However, the order of 12 metres long Tridents was revised later and only 80 of them were ordered finally. The remaining 20 became the later TransBus Enviro500. Transfers It was soon found that Long Win did not get expected ridership and was in an excess of buses, so from 1999, 20 Tridents of Long Win were leased to KMB. 14 of them were officially acquired by KMB in December 2002, and the rest were returned to Long Win by 2005. From December 2009 to 2015, Long Win had mass transferred 103 of the first batch of buses to KMB (ATR393 - ATR495). Withdrawals Both KMB and Long Win have some of their Tridents withdrawn prematurely due to fire. Long Win lost one [Fleet number 197 (HT7970)] in July 1999 and got a replacement a year later. This replacement was Duple Metsec-bodied and with electronic displays, and received the fleet number 301 (JV7629). One KMB Alexander-bodied Trident [Fleet number ATR6 (HV6943)] was destroyed by fire accidentally on 27 November 2002. The accident was caused by the leakage of flammable liquid brought by a passenger into the engine compartment. The bus was officially written off in the following year. In July 2008, two Duple Metsec-bodied KMB's 12-metre Tridents [Fleet number ATR54 (HX7649) and ATR195 (JM8323)], one of KMB's Alexander- bodied 12-metre Trident (ex-Long Win vehicle) [Fleet number ATR358 (HR8939)] and one Duple Metsec-bodied 10.6-metre Trident [Fleet number ATS36 (JK6249)] were written off after being burnt out in KMB's depot in Tin Shui Wai on 31 March 2008. Starting from August 2015, KMB withdrew the first Dennis Trident 3s out of service. =Citybus= Cityflyer routes. Citybus's Trident fleet was not the largest, but often considered with greatest variety. Prototypes After KMB's first Trident was introduced, Citybus also had its prototype Tridents. The first prototype for Citybus was fleet-numbered as 2100. Having a Duple Metsec DM5000 body with coach specifications, it was introduced in November 1997. The second and third prototypes were with ordinary bus specifications, and got their licenses one month after the first. The second prototype was fitted with Alexander ALX500 bodywork while the third was fitted with a Duple Metsec body. They got fleet numbers 2200 and 2201 respectively, in order to distinguish from the \\"coach\\" standard model. Production batch The production batches of Citybus Tridents entered service between 1997 and 1999. For the coach standard branch, 11 Alexander- bodied Tridents entered service in late 1997, followed by 50 Duple Metsec- bodied examples. Numbered after the first prototype, their fleet numbers were 21-prefixed. All these buses were used for \\"Cityflyer\\" express services into Airport, although the Alexander-bodied frames are often substituted for semi- coaches described below. Fleet numbers 2101 and 2102 were later repainted in a special livery and reserved for route E22A. The first batch of 22-prefixed production Tridents are often considered as \\"semi-coaches\\", as they have higher seat standards. A total of 60 semi-coaches entered service in 1998 to 1999 (although one of them stayed in Britain until its final delivery in 2000), while the following 40 (The last two were essentially 23-prefixed) were considered as ordinary standard buses. Citybus also purchased the first 10.6m Trident 3 built by Dennis, which has Duple Metsec semi-coach body. It was introduced in 1999 with fleet number 2700. This bus retired at 27th of April, 2017. Later purchases In 2003, Citybus acquired 9 buses from NWFB and numbered them as 2302 to 2310, following its own production batch. They were fitted with luggage racks in the lower deck in 2007 to facilitate the introduction of new cross-border routes B3 and B3X from Tuen Mun via the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Western Corridor. Withdrawal Eleven Citybus Dennis Trident 3 buses were withdrawn due to fire and traffic accidents between the years 2010 and 2015, and was replaced by Alexander Dennis Enviro500s. The coach standard buses began withdrawal when the Alexander Dennis Enviro500 MMC was introduced in June 2013 and 10 were sold to New Lantao Bus and Kwoon Chong Motors for usage on Lantau Island due to the requests of double deckers. The remaining semi-coach and ordinary standard buses started retirement in 2014, and the last were retired in 2018. The transferred batch (2302-2310) were the last to be withdrawn. The last two (2309, 2310) were retired in April 2019. =New World First Bus= It was rumoured that China Motor Bus (CMB) had thought about purchasing ten Tridents in late 1996, but due to unpredictable delivery time Condors were bought instead. When New World First Bus won China Motor Bus's franchise in early 1998, plan was put forward of buying Tridents. Between 1999 and 2015, Tridents had accounted for over 50% of buses in NWFB's fleet. All of them have been fully withdrawn by 2020. First batch (1998 - 1999) Three batches of NWFB Tridents are 12 metres in length, including the first batch of 160 Alexander-bodied Tridents and 42 Duple Metsec-bodied Tridents, both entering service starting from late 1998. NWFB assigned two different number schemes for these Tridents according to their bodywork (1001 onwards for Alexander bodied ones, and 3001 onwards for Duple bodied ones). Second batch: Shorter variations (1999 - 2000) NWFB's 10.3m Trident 3 (3309) with Duple Metsec bodywork. The second NWFB batch entered service throughout 1999 as well as early 2000. NWFB adopted a policy of purchasing shorter variations of Tridents in its second batch. 50 buses of this batch were still 12 metres in length (30 with Alexander ALX500 bodywork, and 20 with Duple Metsec bodies), but all others have a shorter length. Thirty 11.3-metre Tridents (Fleet Numbers 1401-1430) entered service in 1999, along with sixty- two 10.6-metre ones (Fleet numbers 1601-1662). All these 92 buses were with Alexander ALX500 bodywork, and quickly replaced the old buses inherited from CMB. A slightly later batch of 40 Tridents (Fleet numbers 3301-3340) were fitted with specially-designed Duple Metsec bodywork. They were 10.3 m (34 ft) in length and 4.17 m (13.7 ft) in height, about a feet lower than standard models. These buses were designed for both height and length restrictive road conditions in the hills of Hong Kong Island, including the ones leading to The Peak. These buses' fleet numbers originally included an \\"L\\" (for Low height) at the end, but removed some years later. Last batch (2000 - 2002) NWFB's 12m Trident 3 (1220). A 10.6m Trident prototype (Fleet number 3601) was acquired by NWFB in 2000, but the next Trident batch came only two years later. 41 Tridents with Euro III standard engines entered NWFB in 2002. 21 of them were of Alexander-bodied 12m version, while the other 20 were 10.3m special editions. Essentially, the last special edition buses are also the last of Duple Metsec-bodied Tridents. Withdrawals NWFB's expansion in its early years proved to be too fast, and redundancy grew up fairly quickly. Many of its buses were sold elsewhere in order to achieve better utilisation. Nine 12-metre Tridents in the last batch (fleet number 1201-1209) were transferred to Citybus in 2003, only one year after their entry of service. 53 Tridents were transferred to the bus division of KCRC starting in 2004. All of them were shorter Alexander-bodied versions, with forty-seven 10.6m ones and six 11.3m ones. NWFB has withdrawn most of its Tridents in the 2010s. As of 2020, all franchised NWFB Tridents have been retired, with the last batch (1215-1219) retired in February 2020. In the meantime, some NWFB Tridents have been transferred to Citybus' non-franchised department, including 14 10.3 m Tridents (3341-3354) and 6 Euro III 12 m Tridents (1210, 1212-1214, 1220 and 1221). 1220 was converted to an open-top bus for tourist and hiring services and the fleet number was changed to 25. 4 of the 10.3 m Tridents (3357-3360) were repurposed as Training Buses for Citybus and NWFB. =KCRC= KCRC introduced twenty-two 11.3m Tridents (601-622) in 2000, as an expansion of the company's bus services. They were the first Tridents to be fitted with modified Alexander ALX500 bodywork. Between 2004 and 2005, KCRC acquired forty-seven 10.6m Tridents from NWFB and numbered them 701-747. In August 2005, the company also acquired six 11.3m Tridents from NWFB and numbered them 748-753. This was the largest bus acquisition of KCRC since its first purchase of buses back in 1987, and was partly because of the retirement of that particular batch of buses. All Tridents from KCRC has been retired by 2015. Other overseas orders =Canada= In 1999, BC Transit of British Columbia, Canada, became the first North American transit agency to use double-decker transit buses, ordering 11 Dennis Tridents with Duple Metsec DM5000 bodywork assembled by Alexander. As one of them was damaged in transit, only ten of them reached BC, where they were allocated to the Victoria Regional Transit System in Victoria (being assigned fleet numbers 9001-9010) and entered service in 2000. In 2002, BC Transit ordered a further 19 Dennis Tridents, also with Duple Metsec DM5000 bodywork, one of which was meant to replace the Trident from the previous batch damaged in transit. The first 16 (vehicles 9021-9036) were allocated to Victoria from the outset, while the last three were originally allocated to Kelowna Regional Transit System based in Kelowna (as vehicles 0251-0253) and later transferred to Victoria in 2009 (and renumbered as 9037-9039). 9036 was briefly loaned to GO Transit in Ontario as a demonstration vehicle in May 2002. BC Transit was the only North American operator to order transit-type Trident 3s, before the model was discontinued and replaced with the Enviro500. =Singapore= A SBS Transit 12m Trident 3 in Singapore. This bus was withdrawn earlier due to an accident in early 2017. In 1998, Singapore Bus Services ordered 20 Dennis Trident IIIs with Duple Metsec DM5000 bodywork, as of which were Singapore's first low floor double deck buses. However, due to the large number of Trident orders from Hong Kong, these buses only entered revenue service in July 2001 and were deployed to Hougang Bus Depot throughout their lifespan. When delivered, all buses featured advanced specifications such as Transit Media electronic display signages, and a fully low floor configuration, which was a rarity for SBS buses at the time of introduction. In 2013, some buses have their display signages replaced with Cool-Air or Hanover EDS units. All units were fully retired by August 2018. =United States= Gray Line of the United States introduced 30 Trident 3s for its sightseeing services. These were equipped with open-top Duple Metsec bodywork assembled by Alexander. These were followed by a further 10 buses with the same specifications. They entered service in 2001 and were allocated to cities such as New York City and San Diego.

Supersymmetric gauge theory generalizes this notion. Gauge theory A gauge theory is a mathematical framework for analysing gauge symmetries. There are two types of symmetries, viz., global and local. A global symmetry is the symmetry which remains invariant at each point of a manifold (manifold can be either of spacetime coordinates or that of internal quantum numbers). A local symmetry is the symmetry which depends upon the space over which it is defined, and changes with the variation in coordinates. Thus, such symmetry is invariant only locally (i.e., in a neighborhood on the manifold). Maxwell's equations and quantum electrodynamics are famous examples of gauge theories. Supersymmetry In particle physics, there exist particles with two kinds of particle statistics, bosons and fermions. Bosons carry integer spin values, and are characterized by the ability to have any number of identical bosons occupy a single point in space. They are thus identified with forces. Fermions carry half-integer spin values, and by the Pauli exclusion principle, identical fermions cannot occupy a single position in spacetime. They are identified with matter. Thus, SUSY is considered a strong candidate for the unification of radiation (boson-mediated forces) and matter. This mechanism works via an operator Q, known as supersymmetry generator, which acts as follows: Q\\\\text{boson}\\\\rangle = \\\\text{fermion}\\\\rangle Q\\\\text{fermion}\\\\rangle = \\\\text{boson}\\\\rangle For instance, the supersymmetry generator can take a photon as an argument and transform it into a photino and vice versa. This happens through translation in the (parameter) space. This superspace is a {\\\\mathbb{Z}_2} -graded vector space \\\\mathcal{W}=\\\\mathcal{W}^0 \\\\oplus \\\\mathcal{W}^1 , where \\\\mathcal{W}^0 is the bosonic Hilbert space and \\\\mathcal{W}^1 is the fermionic Hilbert space. SUSY gauge theory The motivation for a supersymmetric version of gauge theory can be the fact that gauge invariance is consistent with supersymmetry. The first examples were discovered by Bruno Zumino and Sergio Ferrara, and independently by Abdus Salam and James Strathdee in 1974. Because both the half-integer spin fermions and the integer spin bosons can become gauge particles. Moreover the vector fields and the spinor fields both reside in the same representation of the internal symmetry group. Suppose we have a gauge transformation V_{\\\\mu} \\\\rightarrow V_{\\\\mu} + \\\\partial_{\\\\mu} A , where V_{\\\\mu} is a vector field and A is the gauge function. The main problem in construction of SUSY Gauge Theory is to extend the above transformation in a way that is consistent with SUSY transformations. The Wess-Zumino gauge provides a successful solution to this problem. Once such suitable gauge is obtained, the dynamics of the SUSY gauge theory work as follows: we seek a lagrangian that is invariant under the Super-gauge transformations (these transformations are an important tool needed to develop supersymmetric version of a gauge theory). Then we can integrate the lagrangian using the Berezin integration rules and thus obtain the action. Which further leads to the equations of motion and hence can provide a complete analysis of the dynamics of the theory.  SUSY in 4D (with 4 real generators) In four dimensions, the minimal supersymmetry may be written using a superspace. This superspace involves four extra fermionic coordinates \\\\theta^1,\\\\theta^2,\\\\bar\\\\theta^1,\\\\bar\\\\theta^2, transforming as a two-component spinor and its conjugate. Every superfield, i.e. a field that depends on all coordinates of the superspace, may be expanded with respect to the new fermionic coordinates. There exists a special kind of superfields, the so- called chiral superfields, that only depend on the variables but not their conjugates (more precisely, \\\\overline{D}f=0). However, a vector superfield depends on all coordinates. It describes a gauge field and its superpartner, namely a Weyl fermion that obeys a Dirac equation. :V = C + i\\\\theta\\\\chi - i \\\\overline{\\\\theta}\\\\overline{\\\\chi} + \\\\tfrac{i}{2}\\\\theta^2(M+iN)-\\\\tfrac{i}{2}\\\\overline{\\\\theta^2}(M-iN) - \\\\theta \\\\sigma^\\\\mu \\\\overline{\\\\theta} v_\\\\mu +i\\\\theta^2 \\\\overline{\\\\theta} \\\\left( \\\\overline{\\\\lambda} - \\\\tfrac{i}{2}\\\\overline{\\\\sigma}^\\\\mu \\\\partial_\\\\mu \\\\chi \\\\right) -i\\\\overline{\\\\theta}^2 \\\\theta \\\\left(\\\\lambda + \\\\tfrac{i}{2}\\\\sigma^\\\\mu \\\\partial_\\\\mu \\\\overline{\\\\chi} \\\\right) + \\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\theta^2 \\\\overline{\\\\theta}^2 \\\\left(D + \\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\Box C\\\\right) is the vector superfield (prepotential) and is real (). The fields on the right hand side are component fields. The gauge transformations act as :V \\\\to V + \\\\Lambda + \\\\overline{\\\\Lambda} where is any chiral superfield. It's easy to check that the chiral superfield :W_\\\\alpha \\\\equiv -\\\\tfrac{1}{4}\\\\overline{D}^2 D_\\\\alpha V is gauge invariant. So is its complex conjugate \\\\overline{W}_{\\\\dot{\\\\alpha}}. A non-supersymmetric covariant gauge which is often used is the Wess‚ÄìZumino gauge. Here, and are all set to zero. The residual gauge symmetries are gauge transformations of the traditional bosonic type. A chiral superfield with a charge of transforms as :X \\\\to e^{q\\\\Lambda}X, \\\\qquad \\\\overline{X} \\\\to e^{q\\\\overline{\\\\Lambda}}X Therefore is gauge invariant. Here is called a bridge since it \\"bridges\\" a field which transforms under only with a field which transforms under only. More generally, if we have a real gauge group that we wish to supersymmetrize, we first have to complexify it to then acts a compensator for the complex gauge transformations in effect absorbing them leaving only the real parts. This is what's being done in the Wess‚ÄìZumino gauge. =Differential superforms= Let's rephrase everything to look more like a conventional Yang‚ÄìMills gauge theory. We have a gauge symmetry acting upon full superspace with a 1-superform gauge connection A. In the analytic basis for the tangent space, the covariant derivative is given by D_M=d_M+iqA_M. Integrability conditions for chiral superfields with the chiral constraint :\\\\overline{D}_{\\\\dot{\\\\alpha}}X=0 leave us with :\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\overline{D}_{\\\\dot{\\\\alpha}}, \\\\overline{D}_{\\\\dot{\\\\beta}} \\\\right\\\\\\\\}=F_{\\\\dot{\\\\alpha}\\\\dot{\\\\beta}}=0. A similar constraint for antichiral superfields leaves us with . This means that we can either gauge fix A_{\\\\dot{\\\\alpha}}=0 or but not both simultaneously. Call the two different gauge fixing schemes I and II respectively. In gauge I, \\\\overline{d}_{\\\\dot{\\\\alpha}}X=0 and in gauge II, . Now, the trick is to use two different gauges simultaneously; gauge I for chiral superfields and gauge II for antichiral superfields. In order to bridge between the two different gauges, we need a gauge transformation. Call it (by convention). If we were using one gauge for all fields, would be gauge invariant. However, we need to convert gauge I to gauge II, transforming to . So, the gauge invariant quantity is . In gauge I, we still have the residual gauge where \\\\overline{d}_{\\\\dot{\\\\alpha}}\\\\Lambda=0 and in gauge II, we have the residual gauge satisfying . Under the residual gauges, the bridge transforms as :e^{-V}\\\\to e^{-\\\\overline{\\\\Lambda}-V-\\\\Lambda}. Without any additional constraints, the bridge wouldn't give all the information about the gauge field. However, with the additional constraint F_{\\\\dot{\\\\alpha}\\\\beta}, there's only one unique gauge field which is compatible with the bridge modulo gauge transformations. Now, the bridge gives exactly the same information content as the gauge field. Theories with 8 or more SUSY generators ()  In theories with higher supersymmetry (and perhaps higher dimension), a vector superfield typically describes not only a gauge field and a Weyl fermion but also at least one complex scalar field.

His ideas concerning individual reclamation were greatly influential in later shaping illegalism. According to Paul Albert, \\"The story of Clement Duval was lifted and, shorn of all politics, turned into the bestseller Papillon.\\" Biography Duval served as a member of the fifth infantry battalion in the Franco-Prussian War, where he was wounded by a mortar and contracted smallpox. As a result, he spent four of the next 10 years in a hospital. Unable to work, Duval turned to theft. Subsequent to his spending a year in prison for the theft of 80 francs, Duval joined the anarchists of The Panther of Batignolles. On 25 October 1886, Duval broke into the mansion of a Parisian socialite and stole 15,000 francs before accidentally setting the house on fire. He was caught only two weeks later after trying to fence the stolen goods, stabbing a policeman named Rossignol several times during his arrest. (The policeman survived his wounds.) Duval's trial drew crowds of supporters and ended in chaos when Duval was dragged from the court, crying, \\"Long live anarchy!\\" He was condemned to death, but his sentence was later commuted to hard labor on Devil's Island, French Guiana. In a letter printed in the November 1886 issue of the anarchist paper Le R√©volt√©, Duval famously declared: \\"Le vol n'est que la restitution, op√©r√© √† son profit par un individu conscient des richesses produites collectivement, et ind√ªment accapar√©e par quelques-uns.\\" (\\"Theft is but restitution carried out by an individual to his own benefit, being conscious of another's undue monopolization of wealth.\\") Duval spent the next 14 years in prison, attempting escape over 20 times. In April 1901, he succeeded and fled to New York City, where he lived until the age of 85. Memoir In 1929, Duval's memoir, Memorie Autobiografiche, was translated by Luigi Galleani and published in Italian. In 1980, Marianne Enckell, at C.I.R.A. in Lausanne, recovered part of Duval's original manuscript, and had it published as Outrage: An Anarchist Memoir of the Penal Colony.

They were first used by the British during World War II. The mine flail consists of a number of heavy chains ending in fist-sized steel balls (flails) that are attached to a horizontal, rapidly rotating rotor mounted on two arms in front of the vehicle. The rotor's rotation makes the flails spin wildly and violently pound the ground. The force of a flail strike above a buried mine mimics the weight of a person or vehicle and causes the mine to detonate, but in a safe manner that does little damage to the flails or the vehicle. World War II Matilda Scorpion Mk 1. The position of the flail operator is outside the tank. The idea is commonly attributed to a South African soldier, Captain Abraham du Toit. A test rig was constructed in South Africa and results were so encouraging that du Toit was promoted and sent to England to develop the idea. Report Number: A045744 Before du Toit left for England, he described his idea to Captain Norman Berry, a mechanical engineer who had been sent to South Africa in 1941 to evaluate the system. Berry later served in the British Eighth Army during the Western Desert Campaign. He had become an enthusiast for the mine flail idea; he lobbied senior officers to authorize development of a flail and carried out his own experiments with mine flails in the spring of 1942. Later Major L. A. Girling was given the task of developing a similar device after it had been independently re- invented by another South African officer. When Berry heard of this, he handed over his work to Girling (who had had no idea he was duplicating du Toit's current work in England, as that was still highly secret). David Gustanski made the device that connected to the side of the tank and made the flail raise and lower. =Matilda Scorpion= Development by Girling's team in Egypt continued over the summer of 1942 and resulted in the \\"Matilda Scorpion\\" (the name came from a senior officer's remark on the tank's appearance). This was a Matilda tank fitted with a rotor, mounted on two arms, roughly 6 feet (1.8 m) in front of the tank. The rotor carried 24 flails and was driven at 100 rpm by a 105-horsepower (78 kW) Ford V8 engine. This second engine was fitted in an armoured box mounted on the right side of the tank, the outside box included space for a crewman who operated the device. Although the mine sweeping process was slow, the Scorpions raised such a huge dust cloud when used in the desert that they obscured themselves from German gunners. The cloud also blinded the drivers; the crews had to resort to wearing their gas masks in order to breathe. Twenty-five Matilda Scorpions, operated by the 1st Army Tank Brigade's 42nd Royal Tank Regiment and 44th Royal Tank Regiment, were available by October 1942 and took part in the Second Battle of El Alamein. German minefields around El Alamein contained around three million mines and had been named the Devil's gardens by the German commander, Erwin Rommel. Breaching these minefields was vital to the Allied battleplan. During the battle, the Scorpions were less successful than hoped. While reasonably effective at mine clearing, the hastily developed flail system was unreliable and broke down frequently. Also, there were frequent engine failures, as the air filters were overwhelmed by the volume of dust produced by flailing or the engines overheated because of the desert environment. Much of the mine clearing that was critical to the Commonwealth victory still had to be carried out by hand. One unexpected effect was that the noise, dust and terrifying appearance of an approaching flail tank caused several Axis infantry units to surrender without resistance. After the battle, a Mark II version of the Scorpion was produced by removing the main gun, as that was thought to be unnecessary. Controls for the flail were moved into the turret so the flail operator could be moved inside the tank, taking the place of the gunner. Engine air filters were improved and unreliable components strengthened. Mark III and Mark IV Scorpions were later developed that were based on the M3 Grant. This larger tank was a more suitable mount for a flail than the Matilda and many became available for modification as, by this time, they were being replaced on the battlefield by the M4 Sherman. A small number of these Grant Scorpions were produced and were used during the remainder of the North African campaign and later during the Allied invasion of Sicily. Turretless Matilda Baron under test - 13 August 1943. Meanwhile, in Britain, du Toit (as unaware of developments in North Africa as they were of his), working with AEC Limited, had developed the Matilda Baron. The Baron's problem was that, like the Scorpion, the rotor was powered by external, auxiliary engines that made it too wide to cross a Bailey bridge and which had to be removed if it was to be transported by rail. Curran Brothers of Cardiff constructed 60 Barons, but they were only used for demonstrations and training. =Sherman crab= A number of experimental flail tanks were produced, including the Valentine Scorpion, based on the Valentine tank and several designs based on the M4 Sherman ‚Äì the Sherman Mark IV and Mark V Scorpions and the \\"Sherman Lobster\\". Eventually one of these, the Sherman Crab, went into full production at the request of General Hobart and saw active service. Du Toit himself had become a strong advocate of a concept called the parambulator mine flail - a self- contained device with its own engine, that could be pushed ahead of any tank that was available. However, the consensus of opinion favored special-purpose tanks with a permanently mounted flail system and he returned to South Africa in 1943. In 1948, du Toit would receive an award of ¬£13,000 from the Royal Commission on Awards to Inventors for his work on the flail. Nine others (including four South Africans) would share a further ¬£7,000.¬£20,000 For Inventors of Flail Tanks -- Ten Men to Share. The Times newspaper, 11 August 1948 p4 column F. Experimental flail mounted on a Valentine tank; the Valentine Scorpion was never used operationally. Unlike the Matilda Scorpion and Matilda Baron, the Crab's flail was powered by the main engine, the Sherman's transmission being modified to add a power take off and removing the need for an outside, auxiliary engine. The Crab's rotor carried 43 flails and was driven at 142 rpm by a driveshaft running down the right hand side of the tank. The addition of a gearbox was required to maintain the correct flail speed when the tank was traveling slower, such as while climbing.Fletcher, The Universal Tank 1993 HMSO 0 11 290534 X pp 93 An innovation was the addition of cutters to the rotor that cut barbed wire and stopped the flail from becoming tangled. This feature made the Crab very effective at tearing up barbed wire obstacles. In the initial Crab design, the flail arms were raised and lowered hydraulically to set the height of the flail. The Mark II version of the Crab, developed as \\"Contouring Crab\\", switched to a counterweighted jib that naturally assumed the right height in balance to the force exerted by the rotating flail. This ensured mines buried under a dip in the ground would not be missed. A blast shield between the flail and the tank gave added protection from detonating mines. The hull machine gun was removed, as the blast shield and flail blocked its field of fire. The Crab weighed 32 tons \\\\- around two tons more than a normal Sherman. Sherman Crab under test. The flail has been lowered to work in a dip in the ground. Great attention was paid to marking the cleared path through the mine field. Crabs carried a pair of bins filled with powdered chalk that slowly trickled out to mark the edges of the safe route. They were also equipped with a hopper that periodically dropped smoke grenade markers and a system that automatically fired illuminated poles into the ground at intervals. A pair of lit masts were mounted at the back for station-keeping when several Crabs were flailing together in echelon. Dust clouds reduced visibility to a minimum, and careful control was essential to make sure the tanks' paths did not drift apart, leaving an uncleared strip of ground between them. In north-west Europe, Crabs were operated by the Lothians and Border Horse, the 22nd Dragoons and the Westminster Dragoons, all of whom were part of the 79th Armoured Division's 30th Armoured Brigade; in Italy, they were operated by the 51st Royal Tank Regiment. A flail squadron of the Royal Armoured Corps, as established on 29 March 1944, comprised seven ordinary Shermans (squadron HQ and a four-tank pilot troop) and four troops of four flail-equipped tanks. In July 1944, the new establishment removed the pilot troop and one of the flail troops; on the plus side, the squadron gained an armoured recovery vehicle. In 1945, in light of experience, each gained a fifth flail tank. Scorpion regiments had been formed of three flail troops.http://www.armouredacorn.com/orbatscdnww2.html Commonwealth Orders of Battle and War Establishments of WW2 In combat, the usual tactic was to use Crabs in groups of five. Three would go forward in echelon formation, clearing a broad path through the minefield. The other two would hang back on the flanks and give fire support, but were ready to move forward to replace one of the flailing tanks if it was disabled. The Crab had disadvantages; flailing did not remove all mines. A Teller mine buried up to deep would be set off, but the resulting explosion would destroy a single flail chain, which would have to be replaced at some point.Delaforce, Patrick, Churchill's Secret Weapons The story of Hobart's Funnies Pen & Sword The Crab could only move at when flailing, and the gun had to point to the rear, so the tank could not fire even if the gunner could see his target. As with the Scorpion, flailing raised a huge cloud of dust. Despite all this, it was an effective and valuable vehicle during and after D-Day, especially as the Germans made extensive use of minefields to slow the Allied advance through France and the Low Countries. By the final months of the war, German minefields had ceased to be a major problem, and it was proposed that the surviving Crabs should have their flail equipment removed and be converted back to regular Shermans \\\\- an idea that was bitterly resented by the Crab crews, who considered themselves to be a highly trained elite. In the end, this never occurred, and the Crabs spent the last part of the war clearing old minefields behind Allied lines. IJA prototype Type 97 Chi-Yu, a copy variant of the Crab The Sherman Crab saw limited use by the American army; the Crab Mark 1 was designated the Mine Exploder T3 Flail and the Crab Mark II the Mine Exploder T4. The flail idea was also copied by the Japanese, who produced a prototype known as the Type 97 Chi-Yu that was based on a Type 97 Chi-Ha tank. In the 1950s, the British Army used heavily armoured Churchill tanks fitted with flails - this was the Churchill Flail FV3902 or Toad. Modern use Hydrema 910 mine clearing vehicle in Afghanistan. Mine flails continue to be used, although their role has changed. During World War II, they were used in combat to clear paths through a defender's mine-field during a large-scale assault. The modern equivalents are used both by armies and by non-military organisations engaged in humanitarian demining. Unlike their World War II predecessors, modern mine flails are not intended for use in combat areas; they are unarmed and only carry the armour necessary to protect the operator from mine explosions. Many modern mine-flail vehicles are intended to destroy only anti-personnel mines and receive significant damage if they encounter a larger anti-tank mine. Mine flail vehicles that can cope with anti-tank mines tend to be larger, heavier, more cumbersome and more expensive to operate. Several designs, such as the Danish Hydrema 910, are based on a truck chassis with an armoured cab and a flail mounted behind on what would otherwise be the cargo space. They are able to drive to the mined site like any other road vehicle. During flailing operations, they slowly drive in reverse over the mine field - in this way, the cab is kept as far as possible from any detonations. Some mine-flail vehicles are operated under remote-control for safety. Vehicles of this type developed by DOK-ING are used worldwide in service with different armies, state agencies, humanitarian organizations and companies. Two main products are the light MV-4 and medium MV-10 types. The Swiss Digger DTR D-250 is a smaller, four ton, remote-controlled vehicle that is more easily moved to remote or inaccessible locations and may be used in more confined areas. Keiler, flail tank; based on the M48 Patton Tanks are still used to carry flails; examples include the Norwegian Army's Leopard AMCV ‚Äì a Leopard tank that was modified by Hagglunds to carry an Aardvark flail system. The German Army is equipped with the Keiler ' (mine clearing tank \\"wild boar\\"), based on a M48 Patton main battle tank. The first of 24 Keilers was supplied to the German Army by Rheinmetall in 1997. However, tanks have the disadvantage of having the driver at the front, close to the flail and any explosions, and they can not go slow enough for effective mine clearance. Also, the weight of tanks makes them difficult to transport (by contrast, the 18-ton Hydrema 910 is light enough to be moved by air in a C-130 Hercules.) The tanks used have generally been obsolete models that have been highly modified - some work under remote control, others have had the driver's station moved to the rear. In modern times, there has been little military interest in an updated equivalent of the Sherman Crab or Matilda Scorpion - a substantially unmodified tank still capable of combat. In battle, the modern preference is to detonate mines with explosive devices (mine-clearing line charges), such as the Antipersonnel Obstacle Breaching System or the Giant Viper. During the Gulf War, the U.S. 2nd Marine Division made an attempt to breach an Iraqi mine field with a mine flail mounted on an armored bulldozer. But the flail was destroyed and the bulldozer crippled by an Iraqi anti-tank mine. Mine flails have the advantage of being able to clear most mines from an area comparatively rapidly - the manufacturer of the British Aardvark Mark 4 quotes a maximum rate of per hour, however per hour is more usual. Also, flails don't place their operators at significant risk, unlike manual demining. However they have come under criticism. They represent a large cost for non government, humanitarian organisations (an Aardvark Mine flail costs around $500,000 US.) They consume a lot of fuel, as a powerful engine is needed to drive the rotor if the flails are to strike the ground with enough force to be effective. Mine flails can be unreliable and require spare parts that are difficult to obtain in remote regions. This leads to high operating costs and possibly lengthy periods when the flails are out of service. Bo≈æena 4 UGV with mine flail in Polish service. It is known that flails don't reliably detonate all the mines in the area being swept, leaving it potentially hazardous. Some mines, such as the Italian MAT/6 mine, are designed to be flail resistant. Mines that have been buried for many years may become unreliable and fail to detonate when struck, yet they may still be hazardous. Also, some mines are smashed without being detonated. This is referred to as a disruptive strike and still renders the mine harmless, but the ground is contaminated with metal debris and undetonated explosive material. This makes it harder to carry out the necessary manual check of the area after the flail had finished, either with metal detectors or explosive sniffer dogs. There were also anecdotes of mine flails flinging live mines out of the mine field and into safe areas. An experiment with inert mine-analogues demonstrated that this could happen; some mines were thrown over by the flail and, in one case, . An additional problem is the vulnerability of some current mine flail vehicles to anti-tank mines. This means that, if the presence of anti-tank mines is suspected, the mine-field must, paradoxically, be manually checked first to make it safe for the mine flail. These problems have led many humanitarian demining organisations to abandon the use of flails. The clearance rate of mine flails can approach 100%, although rates as low as 50%-60% have been reported. Effective clearance requires both suitable conditions and experienced flail operators. Current mine flails do not operate effectively on a gradient greater than 30% or on ground that is especially dry or boggy. A large number of rocks, greater than around in diameter, will also hamper flailing, as they will tend to shield mines from flail blows. This is a particular problem in Lebanon, so the United Nations mine clearing operations in the south of that country have barred the use of flails. Assessing flail effectiveness is difficult, as it is hard to distinguish between a mine that has been missed by the flail and an aged, malfunctioning mine that has been struck but has failed to detonate. To be sure which is the case, it would be necessary to disassemble the mine and examine its fuze - a lengthy and dangerous procedure that is hardly ever carried out in the field. Because of this, all apparently intact mines are reported as being 'missed' by the flail and it has been suggested that this leads to an under-reporting of the mine flail's clearance reliability. Experience in Afghanistan suggests that, despite the disadvantages, mine flailing can, in certain circumstances, be a valuable step in a multi-stage demining process. They remove most mines, but the area must still be checked manually. This is made easier by the fact that the flails strip most vegetation from the minefield and are very effective at disposing of trip-wire triggered booby trap devices.

It generalizes the electro-magnetic symmetry of Maxwell's equations by stating that magnetic monopoles, which are usually viewed as emergent quasiparticles that are \\"composite\\" (i.e. they are solitons or topological defects), can in fact be viewed as \\"elementary\\" quantized particles with electrons playing the reverse role of \\"composite\\" topological solitons; the viewpoints are equivalent and the situation dependent on the duality. It was later proven to hold true when dealing with a N = 4 supersymmetric Yang‚ÄìMills theory. It is named after Finnish physicist Claus Montonen and British physicist David Olive after they proposed the idea in their academic paper Magnetic monopoles as gauge particles? where they state: S-duality is now a basic ingredient in topological quantum field theories and string theories, especially since the 1990s with the advent of the second superstring revolution. This duality is now one of several in string theory, the AdS/CFT correspondence which gives rise to the holographic principle, being viewed as amongst the most important. These dualities have played an important role in condensed matter physics, from predicting fractional charges of the electron, to the discovery of the magnetic monopole.  Electric‚Äìmagnetic duality  The idea of a close similarity between electricity and magnetism, going back to the time of Andr√©- Marie Amp√®re and Michael Faraday, was first made more precise with James Clerk Maxwell's formulation of his famous equations for a unified theory of electric and magnetic fields: : \\\\begin{align} abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{E} &= \\\\rho \\\\quad & abla \\\\times \\\\mathbf{E} + \\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{B}} &= 0  abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{B} &= 0 \\\\quad & abla \\\\times \\\\mathbf{B} - \\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{E}} &= \\\\mathbf{j}. \\\\end{align} The symmetry between \\\\mathbf{E} and \\\\mathbf{B} in these equations is striking. If one ignores the sources, or adds magnetic sources, the equations are invariant under \\\\mathbf{E} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbf{B} and \\\\mathbf{B} \\\\rightarrow -\\\\mathbf{E}. Why should there be such symmetry between \\\\mathbf{E} and \\\\mathbf{B}? In 1931 Paul Dirac was studying the quantum mechanics of an electric charge moving in a magnetic monopole field, he found he could only consistently define the wavefunction if the electric charge e and magnetic charge q satisfy the quantization condition: : \\\\begin{align} eq=2\\\\pi\\\\hbar n \\\\quad \\\\quad & n = 0, \\\\pm1, \\\\pm2 ...  \\\\end{align} Note that from the above if just one monopole of some charge q exists anywhere, then all electric charges must be multiples of the unit 2\\\\pi\\\\hbar/q. This would \\"explain\\" why the magnitude of the electron charge and proton charge should be exactly equal and are the same no matter what electron or proton we are considering, a fact known to hold true to one part in 1021. This led Dirac to state: The magnetic monopole line of research took a step forward in 1974 when Gerard 't Hooft and Alexander Markovich Polyakov independently constructed monopoles not as quantized point particles, but as solitons, in a \\\\operatorname{SU}(2) Yang‚ÄìMills‚ÄìHiggs system, previously magnetic monopoles had always included a point singularity. The subject was motivated by Nielsen‚ÄìOlesen vortices. At weak coupling, the electrically and magnetically charged objects look very different: one an electron point particle that is weakly coupled and the other a monopole soliton that is strongly coupled. The magnetic fine structure constant is roughly the reciprocal of the usual one: \\\\alpha_{m}q^{2}/4\\\\pi\\\\hbar=n^{2}/4\\\\alpha In 1977 Claus Montonen and David Olive conjectured that at strong coupling the situation would be reversed: the electrically charged objects would be strongly coupled and have nonsingular cores, while the magnetically charged objects would become weakly coupled and point like. The strongly coupled theory would be equivalent to weakly coupled theory in which the basic quanta carried magnetic rather than electric charges. In subsequent work this conjecture was refined by Ed Witten and David Olive, they showed that in a supersymmetric extension of the Georgi-Glashow model, the N = 2 supersymmetric version (N is the number of conserved supersymmetries), there were no quantum corrections to the classical mass spectrum and the calculation of the exact masses could be obtained. The problem related to the monopole‚Äôs unit spin remained for this N = 2 case, but soon after a solution to it was obtained for the case of N = 4 supersymmetry: Hugh Osborn was able to show that when spontaneous symmetry breaking is imposed in the N = 4 supersymmetric gauge theory, the spins of the topological monopole states are identical to those of the massive gauge particles.  Dual Gravity  In 1979-1980, Montonen‚ÄìOlive duality motivated developing mixed symmetric higher-spin Curtright field. For the spin-2 case, the gauge- transformation dynamics of Curtright field is dual to graviton in D>4 spacetime. Meanwhile the spin-0 field, developed by Curtright‚ÄìFreund, is dual to the Freund-Nambu field, that is coupled to the trace of its energy‚Äìmomentum tensor. The massless linearized dual gravity was theoretically realized in 2000s for wide class of higher-spin gauge fields , especially that is related to \\\\mathrm{SO}(8), E_7 and E_{11} supergravity. A massive spin-2 dual gravity, to lowest order, in D = 4 and N-D is recently introduced as a theory dual to the massive gravity of Ogievetsky‚ÄìPolubarinov theory. The dual field is coupled to the curl of the energy momentum tensor.  Mathematical formalism  In a four-dimensional Yang-Mills theory with N = 4 supersymmetry, which is the case where the Montonen‚ÄìOlive duality applies, one obtains a physically equivalent theory if one replaces the gauge coupling constant g by 1/g. This also involves an interchange of the electrically charged particles and magnetic monopoles. See also Seiberg duality. In fact, there exists a larger SL(2,Z) symmetry where both g as well as theta-angle are transformed non- trivially. The gauge coupling and theta-angle can be combined together to form one complex coupling : \\\\tau = \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2\\\\pi}+\\\\frac{4\\\\pi i}{g^2}. Since the theta-angle is periodic, there is a symmetry : \\\\tau \\\\mapsto \\\\tau + 1. The quantum mechanical theory with gauge group G (but not the classical theory, except in the case when the G is abelian) is also invariant under the symmetry : \\\\tau \\\\mapsto \\\\frac{-1}{n_G\\\\tau} while the gauge group G is simultaneously replaced by its Langlands dual group LG and n_G is an integer depending on the choice of gauge group. In the case the theta-angle is 0, this reduces to the simple form of Montonen‚ÄìOlive duality stated above.  Philosophical implications  The Montonen‚ÄìOlive duality throws into question the idea that we can obtain a full theory of physics by reducing things into their \\"fundamental\\" parts. The philosophy of reductionism states that if we understand the \\"fundamental\\" or \\"elementary\\" parts of a system we can then deduce all the properties of the system as a whole. Duality says that there is no physically measurable property that can deduce what is fundamental and what is not, the notion of what is elementary and what is composite is merely relative, acting as a kind of gauge symmetry. This seems to favour the view of emergentism, as both the Noether charge (particle) and topological charge (soliton) have the same ontology. Several notable physicists underlined the implications of duality:  Notes   References   Further reading  ; Academic papers         ; Books * Category:Quantum field theory Category:Duality theories ","title":"Montonen‚ÄìOlive duality"},{"id":"2616637","text":"Timothy W.

The practice may involve rapid-fire weapons such as machine guns, indirect-fire weapons such as mortars and some other types of artillery, and it may be applied to successive aerial bombing runs. It may be implemented by a single individual. The weapon operator (gunner) fires one or more rounds of ammunition, and the impact point is noted, either by an observer or by the gunner. The aiming point of the weapon is adjusted, and the process is repeated as necessary. Small caliber automatic weapons, either belt or magazine fed, may include a small amount of tracer ammunition (usually 5% or less) in with regular munitions, to facilitate the process under low-light conditions. The main role of an artillery observer is to assist friendly artillery in accurately attacking a target. The observer will communicate instructions to the friendly forces to adjust their fire, \\"walking\\" it onto the target. Similarly, a forward air controller will help friendly air units adjust their aim in subsequent airstrikes. The name results from the fact that the sequence of rounds striking near the target appear to be walking toward the target. It contrasts with the aimed shots of semi- automatic (or bolt action, single-shot, etc.) fire, in which the first shot is placed on target through the use of a targeting device, which may be as simple as iron sights, or as sophisticated as smart-bomb technology.

Philip Wharton, 4th Baron Wharton (18 April 1613 ‚Äì 4 February 1696) was an English soldier, politician and diplomat. He was a Parliamentarian during the English Civil War. Wharton was the son of Sir Thomas Wharton of Aske Hall and his wife Lady Philadelphia Carey, daughter of Robert Carey, 1st Earl of Monmouth. His father died in 1622 and he inherited the peerage on the death of his grandfather in 1625. Parliamentarianism Wharton was appointed as the Lord Lieutenant of Buckinghamshire by Parliament in July 1642. He led an armed force to seize the local magazine at Manchester, a puritan stronghold. However Lord Strange arrived first. Nevertheless, some of the local inhabitants resisted his entry to the town and suffered one casualty in repelling him.

He was involved in unmasking a plot involving Thomas Ogle, which aimed to separate any unity between the Scottish Covenanters and the English Parliament, while simultaneously drawing the Independents to support the King in exchange for religious toleration. He was a Puritan and a favourite of Oliver Cromwell. After the restoration Following the restoration of the monarchy he frequently ran into difficulty with the Crown. In 1676 he was imprisoned in the Tower of London and later (in 1685) fled the country when King James II came to the throne. He spent time while abroad in the Court of the Prince of Orange and subsequently his family line was back in Royal favour when the latter came to the throne of England in 1688. He was unfailing in his admiration for Cromwell, and his belief that Parliament had been in the right in the Civil War: in 1689 he angrily demanded that Henry Hyde, 2nd Earl of Clarendon, withdraw a reference to the Civil War as a rebellion. He had one surviving daughter, Elizabeth, by his first wife, Elizabeth Wandesford.Clark, J. Kent (2004).Whig's Progress: Tom Wharton between Revolutions, pp.11,17-19. Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, Madison, N.J. By his second wife, Jane, only daughter of Colonel Arthur Goodwin and heiress to the extensive Goodwin estates in Buckinghamshire, he had seven additional children: Anne, Margaret, Thomas Wharton, 1st Marquess of Wharton, Mary, Goodwin, Philadelphia, and Henry. On 21 April 1658, his second wife Jane died and on 26 August 1661, he married for the third time. Lord Wharton married Anne Popham (n√©e Carr), the widow of Colonel Edward Popham. Anne brought two children from her marriage with Edward: Letitia aged 13 and Alexander aged 12. Alexander was a deaf mute and under the guidance of Dr. John Wallis in Oxford, was one of the first deaf people in the world to learn to speak. Lord Wharton and his third wife had a son named William, born around June/July 1662. William died on 14 December 1687, killed in a duel. Lord Wharton was a prominent art collector and patron.

Below: Beyond the Standard Model tau decay via flavor-changing neutral current mediated by a new S boson. An example of a hypothetical (i.e., not yet observed) flavor-changing neutral current process in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. A strange quark emits a bino, turning into a sdown-type squark, which then emits a Z boson and reabsorbs the bino, turning into a down quark. If the MSSM squark masses are flavor-violating, such a process can occur. In theoretical physics, flavor-changing neutral currents or flavour-changing neutral currents (FCNCs) are hypothetical interactions that change the flavor of a fermion without altering its electric charge. Details If they occur in nature (as reflected by Lagrangian interaction terms), these processes may induce phenomena that have not yet been observed in experiment. Flavor-changing neutral currents may occur in the Standard Model beyond the tree level, but they are highly suppressed by the GIM mechanism. Several collaborations have searched for FCNC. The Tevatron CDF experiment first observed the FCNC decay of the strange B-meson to phi mesons in 2005. FCNCs are generically predicted by theories that attempt to go beyond the Standard Model, such as the models of supersymmetry or technicolor. Their suppression is necessary for an agreement with observations, making FCNCs important in model-building. Example Consider a toy model in which an undiscovered boson S may couple both to the electron as well as the tau () via the term :S\\\\bar\\\\psi_e\\\\psi_\\\\tau Since the electron and the tau have equal charges, the electric charge of S clearly must vanish to respect the conservation of electric charge. A Feynman diagram with S as the intermediate particle is able to convert a tau into an electron (plus some neutral decay products of the S). The MEG experiment at the Paul Scherrer Institute near Zurich will search for a similar process, in which an antimuon decays to a photon and an antielectron (a positron). In the Standard Model, such a process proceeds only by emission and re-absorption of a charged , which changes the into a neutrino on emission and then a positron on re-absorption, and finally emits a photon that carries away any difference in energy, spin, and momentum. In most cases of interest, the boson involved is not a new boson S but the conventional boson itself.FCNCs involving the photon cannot occur at zero momentum transfers, because of the unbroken electromagnetic gauge symmetry; as such, FCNCs involving the photon at a non-zero momentum transfer are relatively suppressed compared to FCNCs involving the boson. This can occur if the coupling to weak neutral currents is (slightly) non-universal. The dominant universal coupling to the Z boson does not change flavor, but sub- dominant non-universal contributions can. FCNCs involving the boson for the down-type quarks at zero momentum transfer are usually parameterized by the effective action term :\\\\frac{g}{2\\\\cos \\\\theta_\\\\text{W}}\\\\overline{d}_{L\\\\alpha}U_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}\\\\gamma^\\\\mu d_{L\\\\beta}Z_\\\\mu This particular example of FCNC is often studied the most because we have some fairly strong constraints coming from the decay of mesons in Belle and BaBar. The off-diagonal entries of U parameterizes the FCNCs and current constraints restrict them to be less than one part in a thousand for Ubs. The contribution coming from the one-loop Standard Model corrections are actually dominant, but the experiments are precise enough to measure slight deviations from the Standard Model prediction. Experiments tend to focus on flavor-changing neutral currents as opposed to charged currents, because the weak neutral current ( boson) does not change flavor in the Standard Model proper at the tree level whereas the weak charged currents ( bosons) do. New physics in charged current events would be swamped by more numerous boson interactions; new physics in the neutral current would not be masked by a large effect due to ordinary Standard Model physics.

In some cases, the reasons are political. Sometimes the two individual names are from different languages; in some cases this is because the country has more than one official language, and in others, one language has displaced another. In several countries dual naming has only been applied recently, where a colonial settler community displaced the indigenous peoples and started using names in the settler language centuries ago, and efforts have now been made to use names in the indigenous language alongside the newer names, as an act of reconciliation. Australia  In Australia, a dual naming policy is often now used officially to name landmarks that are of significance to local Indigenous Australians, but for which the most common name is European. For example, the landmark with the Pitjantjatjara name Uluru and English name Ayers Rock is now officially named Uluru / Ayers Rock. In the city of Adelaide, the Adelaide City Council began the process of dual naming all of the city squares, each of the parks making up the parklands which surround the Adelaide city centre and North Adelaide, and other sites of significance to the Kaurna people (the \\"Adelaide tribe\\") in 1997. The naming process, which assigned an extra name in the Kaurna language to each place, was mostly completed in 2003, and the renaming of 39 sites finalised and endorsed by the council in 2012. New Zealand  Similarly, some places in New Zealand have dual Maori and English names, such as Aoraki / Mount Cook. The practice of officially giving certain New Zealand places dual names began in the 1920s, but dual names have become much more common in the 1990s and 2000s, in part due to Treaty of Waitangi settlements. Northern Ireland  \\"Derry/Londonderry\\" has been used unofficially to circumvent the Derry/Londonderry name dispute, in which Irish nationalists used \\"Derry\\" and Ulster unionists use \\"Londonderry\\" for the city and county in Northern Ireland. The \\"Derry stroke Londonderry\\" spoken form of this has in turn engendered the city's nickname \\"Stroke City\\". Romania  In Romania, the city of Cluj was renamed Cluj-Napoca for political reasons in the 1970s, as the communist government wanted to emphasize the city's Roman origins. Spain  Another example of the phenomenon can be seen in the name of the capital of the Spanish Basque Country, Vitoria-Gasteiz. This combines the city's Spanish name of Vitoria and Basque name of Gasteiz. France and Switzerland  The official names of bilingual areas of Alsace, France, and Switzerland also apply. For instance, the German and French Swiss town of Biel/Bienne is the combination of its German name (Biel) and its French name (Bienne). Finland  In Finland, many towns have two names, one in Finnish and one in Swedish (the two official languages of the country). The two names are considered equally correct but are not used as a formal duality of names. United States  The Denali‚ÄìMount McKinley naming dispute is an example of a dual naming issue in the US.

His name means \\"the face of God\\". Narrative Phanuel was one of the four voices Enoch heard praising God. Interpretations As an angel, Phanuel is reputedly a member of the four Angels of Presence. In 1st Enoch, he is also listed as an angel of exorcism (he is heard \\"expelling Satans\\"). Phanuel has also been linked with the Angel of Penance mentioned in the Shepherd of Hermas. Some associate Phanuel with Uriel, however, the Book of Enoch clearly distinguishes the two. Uriel means 'the Light of God' while Phanuel has a different meaning. Phanuel's duties include bearing up God's throne, ministering Truth, and serving as an angel of judgement. Furthermore, as The Book of Enoch attests, Phanuel is the angel of repentance unto hope of those who have inherited eternal life. Piecing together the writings of Enoch and the Revelation of John, Phanuel, along with Michael, Gabriel and Raphael will all drink from the 'winepress of the Wrath of God', strengthening them in that day, the Day of the Lord. Phanuel's arch- rival in the demonic hordes is Belial the Devil and father of lies. During the Battle of Armageddon, Phanuel will relinquish this rivalry, to fulfill the prophecy that Christ will destroy Belial with the word of His mouth. It is often thought that Phanuel is among the angelic voices in Revelation 11:15 saying \\"And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever.\\" According to The Book of Enoch, Phanuel is the fourth angel \\"set over repentance and those who hope to inherit eternal life\\" [Enoch, Chapter 40:9].

The I.Ae. 27 Pulqui I prototype in 1951 Background In the late 1940s, Argentina benefited from the recruitment of prominent German aerospace scientists and engineers, fleeing Europe following the defeat of the Nazis and seeking sanctuary in Latin America. The first group of these refugees had also included French designer √âmile Dewoitine, punished as a collaborator in his homeland, who headed the IAe 27 Pulqui I experimental fighter program with Argentine engineers Juan Ignacio San Mart√≠n, Enrique Cardeilhac and Norberto L. Morchio.\\"FMA I.Ae.27 Pulqui 1.\\" machtres.com. Retrieved: 27 April 2010. The Pulqui I was the first jet aircraft designed and built in Latin America.

Retrieved: 27 April 2010. The Aerotechnical Institute (), under the leadership of Morchio, persevered with its efforts to build a successful indigenous jet fighter and, at first, attempted to modify the earlier aircraft. When it became apparent that the Pulqui I had little potential for further development, the Aerotechnical Institute initiated a new design utilizing the more powerful () Rolls-Royce Nene II turbojet engine. In early 1948, the Institute completed a scale model of what it called the IAe-27a Pulqui II. This design featured trapezoidal wings, swept back at an angle of 33¬∞, and used a NACA 16009 laminar flow airfoil section. A revised model was built later that year with the wings relocated to a shoulder-mounted position and the tailplane changed to a T-tail configuration.Rivas 2008, pp. 166‚Äì167. =Kurt Tank= Like Dewoitine, German designer Kurt Tank, the former technical director of the Focke-Wulf Flugzeugbau AG, had been similarly hired in 1947 to work on a jet fighter project for Argentina. Tank, along with 62 of his compatriots at Focke- Wulf,Wilkinson 2010, p. 32. had emigrated to Latin America to restart his career in aerospace ventures.Newton 1992, p. 376. Surreptitiously entering the country with a passport identifying him as Pedro Matthies, he found a warm welcome and did not maintain the subterfuge of a secret identity. Along with his former employees, he was instrumental in the evolution of the Instituto Aerot√©cnico into Argentina's military aircraft factory, the F√°brica Militar de Aviones at C√≥rdoba.\\"Argentina: Old Hands, New Directions.\\" Time magazine via time.com, 23 October 1950.

Pulqui II glider Design and development After his appointment as project director for a new indigenous fighter program, Tank adapted the basic Ta 183 airframe for the Nene II engine, resulting in a new design that bore only a passing resemblance to its forebear. The Nene was larger, heavier and more powerful than the Heinkel HeS 011 turbojet that had been planned for use in the Ta 183, and therefore required a new, redesigned fuselage with a larger cross-section primarily due to the Nene's centrifugal compressor rather than the HeS 011's axial compressor design. Due to the similarity of the IAe-27a and Tank's redesign of the Ta 183, Juan Ignacio San Mart√≠n, the director of the Institute merged the two parallel projects as the IAe 33 Pulqui II. The fuselage of Tank's design was further adapted to use the IAe-27a's undercarriage.Rivas 2008, p. 167. The shoulder-mounted wings were swept back 40¬∞, an even greater sweep angle than that of the Ta 183, and given a small amount of anhedral. Comparable to the Ta 183's engine placement, the Nene engine was situated aft of the cockpit, near the center of gravity with engine maintenance and service facilitated through the removal of the tail section. The airframe featured a graceful, 50¬∞ swept-back T-shaped empennage and a pressurized cockpit topped by a clear bubble-type canopy, faired into the dorsal fuselage. Armor was provided around the cockpit and a bulletproof windscreen was incorporated.Donald 1997, p. 384. Fuel capacity was initially 1,250 l (275 Imp. gal.) internally and 800 l (176 Imp. gal.) in the wings. Armament was planned to include four 20 mm cannon, a pair mounted in a staggered, near-ventral position along each side of the fuselage slightly set back from the jet intake.Rivas 2008, pp. 167‚Äì168. Pulqui II without tail section, revealing its Rolls-Royce Nene II turbojet Pulqui II at first flight, 27 June 1950 =Testing and evaluation= To prove the soundness of the IAe 33 design, two gliders built under contract by another expatriate, Reimar Horten, were constructed and used for aerodynamics testing in 1948‚Äì1949, including flights by Tank himself. These tests revealed significant problems with lateral stability, resulting in modifications to the tail to address this problem before construction began on two prototype airframes. Due to the lack of modern machinery, the all-metal fabrication relied heavily on handcrafting, and fabricating the prototypes was a labor-intensive procedure. President Per√≥n envisioned that a benefit of setting up an aviation factory in Argentina would be to introduce production standards comparable to world-class manufacturing facilities. However, Tank realized that production tools and jigs were not feasible at this stage and relied instead on essentially hand- built examples.Rathkolb 2004, p. 220. The first airframe (No. 01) reserved for static testing, was subsequently destroyed during the tests.Paul 1960, p. 145. The first of the \\"flying\\" IAe 33 prototypes, (No. 02) built in 1950, completed its maiden flight on 27 June of that year, with Captain Edmundo Weiss at the controls. On the second flight, ex-Focke-Wulf test pilot Otto Behrens encountered severe lateral stability problems at speeds over and returned to the airfield as a precaution. Landing at very high speed, the aircraft bounced with sufficient force to cause the right main undercarriage strut to fail. During repairs to the aircraft, in order to rectify the \\"tricky\\" landing characteristics, the front undercarriage strut was increased in length, which served to alter the angle of incidence of the aircraft, while the shock absorbers were adjusted to have a greater \\"throw\\". Although never considered docile, the modifications improved the takeoff, landing and low-speed characteristics of the IAe 33. More serious aerodynamic problems persisted, stemming from tip stall‚Äî in which the wingtip stalled before the wingroot resulting in an unpredictable \\"rolling moment\\"‚Äî leading to a change in the wing leading edge near the wingroot, while the rudder was modified in an attempt to resolve the interminable lateral instability issues. In addition, the canopy was reinforced with two external frames and a small fairing was installed above the engine exhaust.Rivas 2008, p. 168. The second prototype (No. 02m) note extended oleo strut c. 1951 Tank, himself a capable development test pilot,Wilkinson 2010, p. 24. took over the test program to investigate the aircraft's stalling characteristics, although the requisite airframe changes took several months to complete, with the Pulqui II N. 02(m) so modified not able to undertake its third proving flight until 23 October. During the ensuing high-altitude test, on two successive occasions, the IAe 33 stalled inadvertently, although Tank had sufficient height at 9,000 m for recovery. Adding ballast to the nose of the aircraft cured the problem. On 8 February 1951, Tank publicly demonstrated the IAe 33 before Per√≥n at the Aeroparque Jorge Newbery in Buenos Aires. The audience also included government officials, legislators and the foreign diplomatic corps in the military attaches of the embassies, along with a large crowd of spectators. Both the IAe 27 Pulqui I and IAe 33 Pulqui II flew during the demonstration.Moyano, Miguel Angel. \\"El Proycto 'Pulqui': Propaganda peronista de la epoca.\\" (Project 'Pulqui': Peronist propaganda of the time) lucheyvuelve.com.

The second prototype (No. 02), c. 1951 With the successful completion of the proving test flights, the Argentine Air Force requested a pre-production order of 12 IAe 33 aircraft. In 1951, the air force established a team of service pilots to test fly the new aircraft in a series of acceptance flights. The first flight by Commander Soto on 31 May 1951 revealed severe vibration at about . Tank declared the sole prototype unserviceable pending an investigation into the problem, although this stricture appears to have been overlooked and the prototype continued to fly. On the eve of its 28th flight, Captain Vedania Mannuwal, assigned to the test program, was advised not to stress the aircraft, as the source of the vibrations experienced during the previous flight in the morning had not been discovered. Determined to \\"better\\" his team leader's recent performance, however, he ignored the precautions and began practising aerobatic maneuvers near C√≥rdoba during his afternoon flight. Consequently, in a high g-force turn, a structural failure occurred with the wing separating from the fuselage. After struggling with the Martin-Baker Mk I ejection seat, Mannuwal ejected at low altitude while the aircraft was inverted. His parachute did not fully deploy, however, and he was killed. The defect in the Pulqui II was traced to faulty workmanship related to welding the joint pin that fastened the wing to the fuselage. Welding had been a dichotomy in the manufacturing process necessitated by the paucity of modern forging and pressing equipment in Argentina.Rivas 2008, pp. 168‚Äì169. Photograph of Pulqui II that appeared in many publications Construction of a third prototype (No. 03) began immediately after this loss. The design team initiated a number of changes to rectify design flaws found in the first \\"flying\\" prototype, including an incorporating a larger rudder to improve lateral stability, increasing the size of the exhaust fairing and adding a unique air brake that rotated out from the sides of the fuselage near the tail, along with further reinforcement of the canopy. More fuel was also carried internally to extend the range from . The new IAe 33 prototype completed its first flight on 23 September 1952, piloted by Capt. Jorge Doyle. Flight testing resumed although the aircraft was prepared for a demonstration before President Per√≥n on 11 October 1952.

Two days prior to the exhibition, while practising his display routine, Behrens stalled the Pulqui II at low level and was killed in the resulting crash, which destroyed the prototype.Rivas 2008, p. 169. The third prototype (No. 03), c. 1953 In 1953, Tank constructed a fourth prototype (No. 04) and, in an attempt to resolve the design's deep stall problems at high angles of attack, added stall fences on each wing and four strakes on the rear fuselage. Other refinements included a pressurized cockpit, additional fuel capacity and it was also the first prototype to be fitted with the definitive four 20 mm Hispano Mark V cannon armament. Lt. Jorge Doyle piloted the fourth IAe 33 on its maiden flight on 20 August 1953 and, along with Lt. Gonzalez and Lt. Balado, began armament testing in 1954. While an \\"all- weather\\" IAe 33 version adding a radar was considered,Bridgman 1954, p. 141. the Argentine Air Force made tentative plans for the acquisition of 100 Pulqui II aircraft, with the production version to be a dedicated interceptor, featuring an uprated Nene engine fitted with an afterburner and giving it an anticipated maximum speed of Mach 0.98.Green and Cross 1955, p. 116. A number of foreign buyers had equally expressed interest in the IAe 33, including the Netherlands in 1951 and Egypt in 1953, but the lack of a clear commitment to a production series hampered prospects for export sales, with both nations eventually settling on other readily available fighter aircraft. Evita\\" during his second inaugural parade, June 1952. =Political ramifications= The IAe 33 Pulqui II project was inexorably linked to the machinations and fortunes of the Peronist regime.Green and Fricker 1958, p. 13. Although the F√°brica Militar de Aviones was charged with bringing aviation projects to completion, constant political interference contributed to the delays and disarray in aviation programs. Severe economic problems led in 1951 to the Per√≥n government using the F√°brica Militar de Aviones to build cars, trucks, and motorcycles,Artopoulos 2012, p. 45. including the IAME Rastrojero. Moreover, Tank's team was not primarily focused on the IAe 33, completing the design of the FMA IA 35 Huanquero multi-purpose aircraft (transport, trainer and reconnaissance roles), that eventually entered production at the Direcci√≥n Nacional de Fabricaci√≥n e Investigaci√≥n Aeron√°utica (DINFIA) (Spanish: \\"National Directorate of Aeronautical Manufacturing and Research\\"). The most devastating political decision was to divert the entire manufacturing program \\"seemingly overnight\\" to automotive products and agricultural equipment, essentially closing the aviation divisions. The competing DINFIA projects such as automotive manufacture served to further drain resources in time, money and personnel from the Pulqui II project. Pulqui II (No. 04), c. 1955 While Argentina's finances were extremely strained at this juncture following the economic crisis in 1953, the most serious setback to the project came in January 1955 when Tank's contract expired. He reputedly requested almost twice as much money to continue but President Per√≥n instead canceled his contract outright. Despite four years of development and trials, the IAe 33 project was still encountering teething problems and its status remained unclear although no final decision had been made to abandon a project that had reached iconic stature in the Per√≥nist era. Operational history In September 1955, the sole remaining Pulqui II prototype was pressed into action in the Revoluci√≥n Libertadora, a coup d'√©tat led by General Eduardo Lonardi against Per√≥n.Crassweller 1987, p. 282. The exact details of its participation are unknown, but when rebel forces commanded by Lonardi captured C√≥rdoba as their first conquest, together with the Meteor F 4s fighter-bombers stationed at the C√≥rdoba Escuela De Aviaci√≥n - SACE (Military Aviation School), the IAe 33 was enlisted in the struggle.Cooper, Tom. \\"Argentina, 1955‚Äì1965.\\" Central and Latin America Database, 1 September 2003. Retrieved: 26 April 2010. After flying combat missions against Per√≥nist stalwarts, it later appeared in a flyover during the victory parade at C√≥rdoba celebrating the triumph of the coup over loyalist forces. Pulqui II (No. 04) possibly in camouflage, c. 1955 When the military junta came to power, the IAe 33 project was thrown into disarray. The new government released many of the leading air force staff; similarly, most of Tank's team was forced to leave Argentina with Tank himself going to India, where he worked for Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, and later developed the HF-24 Marut supersonic fighter. In 1956, the air force, in an effort to gain political support, planned a record flight from C√≥rdoba to Buenos Aires to demonstrate the combat potential of the IAe 33. The Pulqui II would fly 800 km, strafe an air force practice range in the Buenos Aires area, and then return to C√≥rdoba using only internal fuel. The only oxygen equipment available for such a long flight was scrounged from a FMA Meteor under repairs. Lt. Balado successfully completed the flight (including the strafing demonstration) at an average cruise speed of around 900 km/h, but the oxygen system failed on the return leg. The semi-conscious pilot managed to perform an emergency landing at high speed, but the heavy landing and resulting stress broke the landing gear, with the Pulqui II overrunning the end of the runway, the aircraft being damaged beyond repair.Rivas 2008, pp. 170‚Äì171. Pulqui IIe (No. 05) on a test flight, c. 1959 Cancellation Shortly after Balado's record flight, the Argentine Air Force reviewed its decision to acquire 100 Pulqui IIs for its fighter force. Based on the spares and wing and fuselage components at hand, the F√°brica Militar de Aviones asserted that ten aircraft could be constructed relatively quickly, however, the remainder of the order would take five years to complete. Meanwhile, plans for an alternative replacement of the hundred aging Meteor F4s obtained in the late 1940s that constituted the backbone of the Air Force continued, initially centered on the acquisition of 36 Canadair CL-13B Mk 6 Sabres, an idea which was dropped in 1956 because the Central Bank was unable to provide the necessary foreign exchange.Paul 1960, p. 179. With the Canadair Sabre no longer a viable option, the F√°brica Militar de Aviones seriously considered having the Pulqui II enter series production. A new prototype was ordered in 1957, despite the United States having offered 100 combat-proven F-86 Sabre fighters with Orenda engines that were available immediately. The fifth IAe 33 Pulqui II (No. 05) prototype, designated Pulqui IIe, was constructed in 1959 (visually identical to the fourth prototype although retaining the original frameless, clear canopy) and entered flight testing after its first flight on 18 September of that year, with Lt. Roberto Starc at the controls. The continual evolution of the Pulqui II had resulted in the design team solving its inherent instability at high angles of attack,Green and Swanborough 1994, p. 213. as well as increasing fuel capacity through the use of a wet wing, to provide sufficient range. However the fighter was now not only considered obsolete, but also politically tainted due to its association with Per√≥n.\\"IAe.33 Pulqui II.\\" machtres.com. Retrieved: 27 April 2010.

He is mentioned in the Hebrew Bible book of First Samuel, chapters 21 and 22, where he is depicted as an antagonist of David responsible for the deaths of a large number of priests. Biblical account After parting from Jonathan, David fled from Saul's jealous anger and hid in Nob. He went to Ahimelech, the High Priest, claiming to be on a clandestine royal mission. Ahimelech fed David and his men with the showbread, and gave David the sword of Goliath. By doing this, David endangered Ahimelech's life, since Doeg was present (\\"detained before the Lord\\") and witnessed Ahimelech's service to David. () Later, Saul asked about the whereabouts of David, prompting Doeg to respond: :Then answered Doeg the Edomite, which was set over the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub. () Therefore, Saul summoned Ahimelech and his entire company, asking him why he decided to conspire against him by protecting David. Ahimelech, possibly in an attempt to save himself, claimed that he was uninvolved in the controversy between Saul and David. Saul coldly rejected his claim and ordered Ahimelech and the priests to be executed. His officials refused to raise their hands against the priests, and Saul turned to Doeg, who carried out the executions. Saul followed that up with an attack on the city of Nob, the city of the priests, and the families of the priests ‚Äì men, women, and children ‚Äì were put to the sword. Only Abiathar escaped, and fled to join David. The death of Ahimelech, as the great-grandson of Eli, is seen as fulfilling part of the curse on the House of Eli that none of his male descendants would live to old age ().Jewish Encyclopedia article on Ahimelech David later showed remorse for his part in the incident: :And David said unto Abiathar, I knew it that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul: I have occasioned the death of all the persons of thy father's house. () The heading above records that David wrote it after Doeg the Edomite betrayed Ahimelech to Saul. In Rabbinical literature Doeg is the subject of many rabbinical legends, the origins of which are to be found in part in Psalm 52. Though he died at the early age of thirty-four years,Sanh. 69b he is regarded by the rabbis as the greatest scholar of his time, a strong description being supposedly applied to him because he made every one with whom he disputed \\"blush\\".Midrash Tehillim lii. 4; ed. Buber, p. 284. He could bring forward 300 different questions with reference to one single ritual case.·∏§ag. 15b. But he was lacking in inward piety, so that God was \\"anxious\\" concerning his end, and \\"mourned\\" for him.Sanh. 106b. His most unfortunate qualities, however, were his malice, jealousy, and calumnious tongue. He sounded the praise of David before Saul only in order to provoke his jealousy, ascribing to David qualities that Saul lacked.Sanh. 93b; compare Midrash Shmuel 19, end. He cherished a grudge against David, whose opinion prevailed over his own in determining the site for the Temple at Jerusalem,Zeb. 54b and he had well-nigh succeeded in proving by his arguments that David, as a descendant of Ruth the Moabite, could not, according to the Law, belong to the congregation of Israel, when the prophet Samuel interposed in David's favor.Yeb. 76b, 77a; Midrash Shmuel xxii. He also declared David's marriage with Michal to be invalid, and induced Saul to marry her to another. Doeg not only disregarded the sanctity of marriage, but he also slew with his own hands the priests of Nob, after Abner and Amasa, Saul's lieutenants, had refused to do so.Genesis Rabbah 32; Midrash Tehillim 52. 4. As it often happens with those who strive for something to which they are not entitled, he lost that which he possessed.Gen. R. 20. God sent the three \\"angels of destruction\\" to Doeg; the first caused him to forget his learning, the second burned his soul, and the third scattered the ashes.Sanh. 106b; differently, Yer. Sanh. 10. 29a. According to some he was slain by his own pupils when they found that he had forgotten his learning;Yal·∏≥., Sam. 131 others maintain that he was slain by David when he (Doeg) informed him of the death of Saul and of Jonathan.; Pesi·∏≥., ed. Buber, iii. 28b; Ginzberg, \\"Die Haggada bei den Kirchenv√§tern,\\" i. 38. According to another Midrash, Doeg tried to preserve the life of Agag, the king of the Amalekites-Edomites, by interpreting into a prohibition against the destruction of both the old and the young in war.Midrash Tehillim 52.4. Doeg is among those who have forfeited their portion in the future world by their wickedness.Sanh. x. 1; compare ib. 109b. Doeg is an instance of the evil consequences of calumny, because by calumniating the priests of Nob he lost his own life, and caused the death of Saul, Ahimelech, and Abner.Yer. Peah 1.16a; Midrash Tehillim 120.9 [ed. Buber, p. 504]. Later, Jehoash (Joash) was the only one of Jehoram's male descendants to escape extermination at the hand of Athaliah. The slaughter was considered a divine retribution for David's role in causing the death of the priests at Nob,Compare but Jehoash escaped death because on that earlier occasion one priest, Abiathar, had survived.Sanh. 95b.

These include the physical environment; the ethnographic background of Belarusians (the merger of Slavic newcomers with Baltic natives); the paganism of the early settlers and their hosts; Eastern Orthodox Christianity as a link to the Byzantine literary and cultural traditions; the country's lack of natural borders; the flow of rivers toward both the Black Sea and the Baltic Sea; and the variety of religions in the region (Catholicism, Orthodoxy, Judaism, and Islam).Jan Zaprudnik and Helen Fedor. \\"Culture\\", A Country Study: Belarus, Federal Research Division, Library of Congress; Helen Fedor, ed. Research completed June 1995 An early Western influence on Belarusian culture was Magdeburg Law‚Äîcharters that granted municipal self-rule and were based on the laws of German cities. These charters were granted in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries by grand dukes and kings to a number of cities, including Brest, Grodno, Slutsk, and Minsk. The tradition of self-government not only facilitated contacts with Western Europe but also nurtured self-reliance, entrepreneurship, and a sense of civic responsibility. In 1517-19 Francysk Skaryna (ca. 1490-1552) translated the Bible into the vernacular (Old Belarusian). Under the communist regime, Skaryna's work was vastly undervalued, but in independent Belarus he became an inspiration for the emerging national consciousness as much for his advocacy of the Belarusian language as for his humanistic ideas. From the fourteenth to the seventeenth centuries, when the ideas of humanism, the Renaissance, and the Reformation were alive in Western Europe, these ideas were debated in Belarus as well because of trade relations there and because of the enrollment of noblemen's and burghers' sons in Western universities. The Reformation and Counter-Reformation also contributed greatly to the flourishing of polemical writings as well as to the spread of printing houses and schools. During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, when Poland and Russia were making deep political and cultural inroads in Belarus by assimilating the nobility into their respective cultures, the rulers succeeded in associating \\"Belarusian\\" culture primarily with peasant ways, folklore, ethnic dress, and ethnic customs, with an overlay of Christianity. This was the point of departure for some national activists who attempted to attain statehood for their nation in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The development of Belarusian literature, spreading the idea of nationhood for the Belarusians, was epitomized by the literary works of Yanka Kupala (1882‚Äì1942) and Yakub Kolas (1882‚Äì1956). The works of these poets, along with several other outstanding writers, became the classics of modern Belarusian literature by writing widely on rural themes (the countryside was where the writers heard the Belarusian language) and by modernizing the Belarusian literary language, which had been little used since the sixteenth century. Postindependence authors in the 1990s continued to use rural themes widely. Unlike literature's focus on rural life, other fields of culture‚Äîpainting, sculpture, music, film, and theater‚Äîcentered on urban reality, universal concerns, and universal values. Music The first major musical composition by a Belarusian was the opera Faust by Antoni Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç. In the 17th century, Polish composer Stanis≈Çaw Moniuszko composed many operas and chamber music pieces while living in Minsk. During his stay, he worked with Belarusian poet Vintsent Dunin- Martsinkyevich and created the opera Sialianka (Peasant Woman). At the end of the 19th century, major Belarusian cities formed their own opera and ballet companies. The ballet Nightingale by M. Kroshner was composed during the Soviet era. After World War II, the music focused on the hardships of the Belarusian people or on those who took up arms in defense of the homeland. This was the time period that Anatoly Bogatyrev, the creator of the opera 'In Polesia Virgin Forest', served as the \\"tutor\\" of Belarusian composers. The National Academic Theatre of Ballet, in Minsk, was awarded the Prix Benois de la Danse in 1996 as the top ballet company in the world.Virtual Guide to Belarus - Classical Music of Belarus. Retrieved March 21, 2007. Popular Soviet Belarusian music was composed by several prominent bands, many of whom performed Belarusian folk music. Folk rock act Pesniary, formed in 1969 by guitarist Vladimir Mulyavin, became the most popular folk band of the Soviet Union, and often toured over Europe. Pesniary's example inspired Syabry and Verasy to follow their way. The tradition of Belarus as a centre of folk and folk rock music is continued today by Stary Olsa, Vicious Crusade and Gods Tower, among others. Siarhei Mikhalok Rock music of Belarus arose in Perestroika times. Bands like Bi-2 (currently living in Russia), Lyapis Trubetskoy, Krama and ULIS were founded in the late 1980s or early 1990s. Though rock music has risen in popularity in recent years, the Belarusian government has suppressed the development of popular music through various legal and economic mechanisms. Because of these restrictions, many Belarusian bands prefer to sign up to Russian labels and to perform in Russia or Ukraine. Researchers Maya Medich and Lemez Lovas reported in 2006 that \\"independent music-making in Belarus today is an increasingly difficult and risky enterprise\\", and that the Belarusian government \\"puts pressure on ‚Äòunofficial‚Äô musicians - including ‚Äòbanning‚Äô from official media and imposing severe restrictions on live performance.\\" In a video interview on freemuse.org the two authors explain the mechanisms of censorship in Belarus. Since 2004, Belarus has been sending artists to the Eurovision Song Contest.National State Teleradiocompany Page on the 2004 Belarusian entry to the Eurovision Song Contest . Published 2004. Retrieved March 18, 2007. Dress Traditional Belarusian shirt The traditional two-piece Belarusian dress originated from the time of Kievan Rus', and continues to be worn today at special functions. Due to the cool climate of Belarus, the clothes were made out of fabrics that provide closed covering and warmth. They were designed with either many threads of different colors woven together or adorned with symbolic ornaments. Belarusian nobles usually had their fabrics imported and chose the colors of red, blue or green. Males wore a shirt and trousers adorned with a belt, while females wore a longer shirt, a wrap-around skirt called a \\"paniova\\", and a headscarf. The outfits were also influenced by the dress worn by Poles, Lithuanians, Latvians and other European nations and have changed over time due to improvements in the techniques used to make clothing. Embroidery plays an important role in Belarusian traditions. World Heritage Sites Belarus has four World Heritage Sites, with two of them being shared between Belarus and its neighboring countries. The four are the Mir Castle Complex, the Nesvizh Castle, the Bia≈Çowie≈ºa Forest (shared with Poland), and the Struve Geodetic Arc (shared with Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Moldova, Russia, Sweden and Ukraine). Literature Svetlana Alexievich was awarded the 2015 Nobel Prize in Literature Belarusian literature began with 11th- to 13th-century religious writing; the work of 12th-century poet Cyril of Turaw is representative. Rhyming was common in these works, which were generally written in Old Belarusian, Latin, Polish or Church-Slavic.UNESCO Preservation of Belarusian Literary Heritage . Retrieved October 6, 2007. By the 16th century, Polotsk resident Francysk Skaryna translated the Bible into Belarusian. It was published in Prague and Vilnius between 1517 and 1525, making it the first book printed in Belarus or anywhere in Eastern Europe.Belarus - Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online The modern period of Belarusian literature began in the late 19th century; one important writer was Yanka Kupala. Many of the writers at the time, such as U≈Çadzimir ≈Ωy≈Çka, Kazimir Svayak, Yakub Kolas, ≈πmitrok Biadula and Maksim Haretski, wrote for a Belarusian language paper called Nasha Niva, published in Vilnius. After (Eastern) Belarus was incorporated into the Soviet Union, the government took control of Belarusian culture, and until 1939 free development of literature occurred only in the territories incorporated into Poland (Western Belarus). Several poets and authors went into exile after the Nazi occupation of Belarus, not to return until the 1960s. In post-war literature, the central topic was World War II (known in Belarus as the Great Patriotic War), that had particularly left particularly deep wounds in Belarus (Vasil‚Äô Bykaw, Ales Adamovich etc.); the pre-war era was also often depicted (Ivan Melezh). A major revival of the Belarusian literature occurred in the 1960s with novels published by Vasil‚Äô Bykaw and Uladzimir Karatkievich. Theater Belarusian theater also began to gain popularity in the early 1900s. One of Belarus's most famous plays, Paulinka (written by Yanka Kupala), was performed in Siberia for the Belarusians who were being sent to the region. Documentation of Belarusian folk music stretches back to at least the 15th century. Prior to that, skomorokhs were the major profession for musicians. A neumatic chant, called znamenny, from the word znamena (Russian: –∑–Ω–∞–º—ë–Ω–∞ - signs), meaning sign or neume, was used until the 16th century in Orthodox church music, followed by two hundreds of stylistic innovation that drew on the Renaissance and Protestant Reformation. In the 17th century, Partesnoe penie, part singing, became common for choruses, followed by private theaters established in cities like Minsk and Vitebsk. Popular music groups that came from Belarus include Pesniary, Dreamlin and NRM. Currently, there are 27 professional theater groups touring in Belarus, 70 orchestras, and 15 agencies that focus on promoting concerts. In 2005, playwrights Nikolai Khalezin and Natalya Kolyada founded the Belarus Free Theatre, an underground theatre project dedicated to resisting pressure and censorship by government of Belarus. The group performs in private apartments and at least one such performance was broken up by special forces of the Belarusian police The Belarus Free Theatre has attracted the support of notable Western writers such as Tom Stoppard, Edward Bond, V√°clav Havel, Arthur Kopit and Harold Pinter. Russian impact Following the Partitions of Poland, Imperial Russia enacted a policy of de-polonisation of the Ruthenians. However, even after many cases when the Belarusian peoples were subjected to what some call Russification, it was clear that this created a distinct ethnicity and a distinct culture that was neither Polish nor Russian. In 1897 census most of the population referred to their language as Belarusian rather than Ruthenians (and interpreted as Russian by Tsarist authorities), as they did during Polish rule. It was the 20th century that fully allowed Belarus to show its culture to the world. Notable Belarusian poets and writers included Yanka Kupala, Maksim Bahdanoviƒç, Vasil‚Äô Bykaw, and Uladzimir Karatkievich. Also helped was the korenizatsiya policy of the Soviet Union which encouraged local level nationalism. The Belarusian language was numerously reformed to fully represent the phonetics of a modern speaker. However, some contemporary nationalists find that the Russian influence has taken its toll too much. At present the Russian language is being used in official business and in other sections of Belarusian society. Festivals The 2015 Minsk Victory Day Parade on Victors Avenue. Victory Day (9 May) celebrations are a major part of cultural life in the capital. The Belarusian government sponsors many annual cultural festivals: Slavianski Bazaar in Vitebsk; \\"Minsk Spring\\"; \\"Slavonic Theatrical Meetings\\"; International Jazz Festival; National Harvesting Festival; \\"Arts for Children and Youth\\"; Competition of Youth Variety Show Arts; \\"Muses of Nesvizh\\"; \\"Mir Castle\\"; and the National Festival of the Belarusian Song and Poetry. These events showcase talented Belarusian performers, whether it is in music, art, poetry, dance or theater. At these festivals, various prizes named after Soviet and Belarusian heroes are awarded for excellence in music or art. The contemporary nationalists argue that most of these sponsored events have nothing to do with the Belarusian culture, let alone the culture as such, however all the events are subject to the expertise of the Belarusian Ministry of Culture. Several state holidays, like Independence Day or Victory Day draw big crowds and include various displays such as fireworks and military parades. Most of the festivals take place in Vitebsk or Minsk. Sport Belarusian tennis player Victoria Azarenka From the 1952 Helsinki Games until the end of the Soviet era, Belarus competed in the Olympic Games as part of the Soviet Olympic squad.

It is known for steak, seafood, and salad bar items. Since 2011, Sizzler restaurants outside of the United States are currently owned by Australia-based Collins Foods and are no longer related to the American firm. In September 2020, Sizzler USA, filled for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection blaming the coronavirus for hurting sales. The bankruptcy filing does not affect the similarly named Collins Foods affiliated restaurants that are located outside of the United States. History The chain was founded in 1958 as Sizzler Family Steak House by Del and Helen Johnson in Culver City, California. The chain is composed of more than 270 locations throughout the U.S. Most of Sizzler's U.S. locations are in the West. Steak and lobster with fries from Sizzler In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Sizzler promoted steak and combination steak dinners with an optional salad bar. The restaurant wanted to give customers the feel of a full-service restaurant at a price slightly more than a fast food chain. To control costs, many restaurants had in-house meat cutters that would cut steaks and grind beef. Into the early to mid 1980s, competition appeared: Ponderosa Steakhouse and Bonanza Steakhouse. After promotions, such as all-you-can-eat fried shrimp, the chain expanded its salad bar into a full buffet promoted as the \\"Buffet Court.\\" Patrons began to use the buffet as a meal instead of an add-on to an entree. In response, Sizzler lowered the quality in other menu areas. Sizzler also introduced a free grilled cheese bread roll at the start of the experience which was intended to line the stomach, curbing appetite. Customers took notice, and Sizzler's reputation suffered. Sizzler filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1996 (\\"to escape costly leases on unprofitable restaurants\\"), and closed over 130 of its locations. The company reemerged from Chapter 11 in 1997. During the late 1990s, new management upgraded the quality of food and increased prices. Twenty one locations closed in 2001. Sizzler began an image makeover circa 2002. A new restaurant concept was created, featuring a lighter and more open dining room. The changes were accompanied by a new menu. In an effort to return to its roots, steaks, seafood, and the salad bar were emphasized, while the all-you-can-eat buffet was phased out in some locations, however it still remains today in many others. In the 1990s, Sizzler ran upscale locations with the Buffalo Ranch Steakhouse brand. Sizzler was sold to Pacific Equity Partners, an Australian-based investment firm, in 2005. In January 2008, Sizzler announced it was planning to take action against the Multi-State Lottery Association (MUSL) of Urbandale, Iowa, over the use of the name The Sizzler (Hot Lotto). In June 2011, Sizzler USA announced that a US management group led by the Sizzler CEO, would buy the American portion of the chain of 178 restaurants from Pacific Equity Partners with the remaining 100 restaurants located outside of the United States remaining with Pacific Equity Partners. The headquarters initially remained in Culver City, California where the chain was founded, but moved to Mission Viejo, California in 2012. Sizzler has launched its \\"ZZ\\" food truck to expand sales and test market new dishes. In September 2020, Sizzler USA announced that they had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, citing impacts of COVID-19, namely forcing it to temporarily close its restaurants' dining rooms. The company also cited problems paying rent. Most of the company-owned restaurants are located in highly COVID-19 infected areas of California that did not permit restaurants to even partially open dining rooms as recently as September 2020. International locations Musashino, Japan Sizzler also has restaurants throughout the world including Australia, Canada, China, Indonesia, Japan, South Africa, South Korea, and Thailand. After Sizzler USA's separation from Sizzler International in 2011, all locations outside the United States are operated by Collins Foods. The Australian Sizzlers were reasonably popular from the 1980s to the 2000s. In the 2013, financial year Collins Foods reported stalling revenue for their Sizzler operations in Australia, blaming the downturn of the casual dining sector in the country. By 2015, Collins Foods wrote down the value of Sizzler by AU$37.5 million. In an investors meeting by Collins Foods, CEO Graham Maxwell states: \\"We no longer consider Sizzler to be a strategic growth prospect in Australia and therefore we will not be investing further capital\\". Collins Foods began to close a number of Sizzler restaurants in Australia. Meanwhile, Collins Foods' Sizzler operations in Asia continued to thrive, with further expansion planned in China. Collins Foods will close all its remaining Sizzler restaurants in Australia by November 15, 2020. Collins Foods said of the three restaurant brands that it operates, Sizzler had been hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. Controversy =Food safety= In 2000, more than 60 people became ill and one person died in an outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 that originated at a Sizzler restaurant in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Health officials said that the most likely source of contamination was meat supplied by the Excel Corporation meat packer. The health officials believed that cross contamination to other food items occurred when Sizzler employees handled the meat near areas where salad bar items were prepared. This was similar to an outbreak in Washington and Oregon in 1993. In the 1993 case, as in 2000, the tainted meat apparently came from Excel, and contaminated salad bar items. This ultimately lead to Sizzler closing the chain's remaining Midwest locations including those in Wisconsin, Illinois, and Indiana.

Entering service in 1987, the vessel is currently assigned to CCG Maritimes Region and is homeported at CCG Base Dartmouth, in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia. The vessel is named after Scottish explorer Sir William Alexander, 1st Earl of Stirling, who was an early colonizer of Nova Scotia. Description and design Designed as a light icebreaker and buoy tender, Sir William Alexander and sister ship differ from the rest of the class by having one less deck in the superstructure and their buoy-handling derricks mounted forward. Sir William Alexander had her derricks replaced by a crane in 1998.Maginley and Collin, p. 177 Sir William Alexander displaces fully loaded with a and a .

The ship is also equipped with one Caterpillar 3306 emergency generator. This gives the ship a maximum speed of . Capable of carrying of diesel fuel, Sir William Alexander has a maximum range of at a cruising speed of and can stay at sea for up to 120 days. The ship is certified as Arctic Class 2. The icebreaker is equipped with one Racal Decca Bridgemaster navigational radar operating on the I band. The vessel is equipped a cargo hold. Sir William Alexander is equipped with a flight deck and a hangar that can house two light helicopters of the MBB Bo 105 or Bell 206L types. However, the vessel is only allotted one helicopter. The ship has a complement of 26, with 10 officers and 16 crew. Sir William Alexander has nine additional berths. Operational history The ship was constructed by Marine Industries at their yard in Tracy, Quebec with the yard number 451. Sir William Alexander was launched on 23 October 1986 and entered service on 13 February 1987. The ship is registered in Ottawa, Ontario, and homeported at Dartmouth, Nova Scotia. =Hurricane Katrina relief mission= On 6 September 2005, CCGS Sir William Alexander left Halifax Harbour, together with the Canadian warships , and , to participate in a humanitarian aid mission named Operation Unison, which provided relief to part of the devastated Gulf of Mexico coast of the United States following Hurricane Katrina.Tracy, p. 282 Sir William Alexander participated in the mission as a supply vessel, and also to effect repairs to aids to navigation (navaids). The decision to assign Sir William Alexander to the Operation Unison task force was unprecedented in Canadian Coast Guard history as no icebreaker from the service has operated for an extended period of time in southern tropical waters such as the Gulf of Mexico, aside from transiting the Panama Canal to and from British Columbia. On 19 September 2005, it was announced that the three warships were no longer needed in the Gulf of Mexico, given the massive U.S. military response as well as increasing civilian aid flowing into the region. Sir William Alexander was exempted from returning to Canada however, as her heavy lift capabilities were considered useful for ongoing repairs to aids to navigation which were destroyed by Hurricane Katrina, and later Hurricane Rita (23 September). On 28 September, the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans announced that Sir William Alexander was being retasked from relief efforts and navigation systems repair to assist the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in repairing the damaged network of weather buoys along the Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Sea, and Atlantic coasts. She returned to CCG Base Dartmouth from Operation Unison on 24 October 2005. =Post-Katrina operations= Sir William Alexander was involved in a fatal towing incident involving the fishing vessel L'Acadien II during the 2008 Canadian commercial seal hunt. On 30 September 2014, a Canadian Armed Forces Bell CH-146 Griffon helicopter clipped Sir William Alexanders antenna during a training exercise in Mahone Bay. The helicopter was forced to make an emergency landing in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia. In February 2017, Sir William Alexander was dispatched to aid the merchant vessel Thorco Crown, which had caught fire in the Cabot Strait. The engine room fire was extinguished but the merchant was disabled. When a tugboat arrived to take Thorco Crown in tow, the tugboat was unable to secure the towline. Sir William Alexander then took Thorco Crown in tow during the night, transferring the tow to the tugboat in the morning. References =Notes= =Citations= =Sources=  External links Category:Martha L.

In particular, the more general high energy theory must be well-defined at arbitrarily high energies. The word \\"ultraviolet\\" in this so-called \\"ultraviolet regime\\" is only figurative, and refers to energies much higher than ultraviolet light per se. Rather, by analogy to the relationship between ultraviolet and visible light, it refers to energies higher than (and wavelengths shorter than) those \\"visible\\" to laboratory experiment. The ultraviolet theory must be renormalizable; it can have no Landau poles; and most typically, it enjoys asymptotic freedom in the case that it is a quantum field theory (or at least has a nontrivial fixed point). However, it may also be a background of string theory whose ultraviolet behavior is at least as good as that of renormalizable quantum field theories. Besides these two known examples (QFT and string theory), it could be a completely different theory than string theory that behaves well at very high energies.

John IV, Duke of Brabant (11 June 1403 - 17 April 1427) was the son of Antoine of Burgundy, Duke of Brabant, Lothier and Limburg and his first wife Jeanne of Saint-Pol. He was the second Brabantian ruler from the House of Valois.  Succession as Duke of Brabant  John was born in Arras, and succeeded as duke of Brabant in 1415, after his father's death at the Battle of Agincourt. However, his succession was not immediately accepted by everyone. The holy Roman emperor Sigismund contested his succession, as he wished to curb the Valois influence (read: the influence of the duke of Burgundy, John's uncle) in the region. John the Fearless, the duke of Burgundy, naturally supported his nephew, as did the States of Brabant. Their joint support prevented a second succession war in the duchy.De Brabantse Leeuw sluimert (1356-1430) in: Geschiedenis van Brabant, van het hertogdom tot heden (2004), p. 164 Furthermore, through their support of John as the new duke, the States of Brabant gained regency over the duchy until the coming of age of the still underage duke.Geschiedenis van Brabant, van het hertogdom tot heden, p. 164-165  Marriage to Jacqueline, Countess of Hainaut  In 1418, he married Jacqueline, Countess of Hainaut. Jacqueline's supporters hoped that the marriage would provide a protector - in the person of John IV of Brabant - of Jacqueline's inheritance against the claims of her uncle John III. Through their marriage, the counties of Holland, Zeeland and Hainaut and the duchies of Brabant and Limburg were united in a personal union. However, the marriage did not provide the stability sought after by Jacqueline and her supporters and eventually led to estrangement of the couple in 1420. One of the reasons was his incapability to protect her rights in Holland and Zeeland. His attempts in the first year of their marriage, such as the disastrous Siege of Dordrecht (summer of 1418), were insufficient against the force of Jacqueline's uncle, John III. Another reason why their marriage and John's attempts to defend Jacqueline's rights in Holland and Zeeland did not succeed was that John's closest advisors were all part of the Cod faction, while Jacqueline's supporters were of the Hook faction in the Hook and Cod disputes. This meant an inevitable political struggle. Under influence of his advisors, John appointed Jacqueline's uncle, John III, as regent (Dutch: ruwaard) of Holland in 1420. This open support of her uncle caused Jacqueline to flee her husband's court and declared their marriage annulled.A. Janse, Een Pion voor een Dame, Jacoba van Beieren (1401-1436), 2009, p. 179-195 After the death of John III in 1425, the county of Holland once again fell to John IV. However, he immediately appointed his cousin Philip the Good, duke of Burgundy, as the new regent as well as his heir in case he died without issue.A. Janse, p. 238  Tensions in the Duchy of Brabant  Coat of Arms of the Dukes of Brabant of the Burgundy family. That John's advisors were of the Cod faction did not only cause friction in John's marriage to Jacqueline, but also caused tensions in the Duchy of Brabant. There was a great discontent amongst the cities and the aristocracy who had been powerful under his father's reign against these powerful advisors.Geschiedenis van Brabant, van het hertogdom tot heden, p. 165‚Äì166 When Jacqueline left her husband in 1420, the States of Brabant sided with her. They appointed John's brother, Philip of Saint-Pol, regent of Brabant. A forceful reaction of the duke against these measures was prevented by the uprising of the Brussels guilds. This meant that, for the time being, John had to bend to their wishes.Geschiedenis van Brabant, van het hertogdom tot heden, p. 166 A reconciliation treaty was made in 1421 and John was restored to his full ducal powers. In return, he expanded the city privileges and the powers of the States of Brabant in 1422, a measure called the Nieuw Regiment. With this reconciliation, the States of Brabant supported their duke in his fight against Jacqueline and her new husband, Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester. He never accepted the annulment of their marriage, and was post- mortem backed up by the pope in 1428.A. Janse, p. 279‚Äì280 John died in Brussels in 1427, aged 23, without issue. This meant his claims on Holland, Zeeland and Hainaut, as husband of Jacqueline, were transferred to Philip the Good. His duchies of Brabant and Limburg were inherited by his younger brother, Philip of Saint-Pol. Double groat, struck in Maastricht under the reign of John IV, Duke of Brabant and Limburg (1415‚Äì1427) Legacy He is often typified as a weak prince, who was easily influenced by more shrewd and politically able men, such as Philip the Good and John III of Holland. His age and inexperience would have played a major role in this characterization.Geschiedenis van Brabant, van het hertogdom tot heden, p. 167-168 In 1425, he founded the University of Leuven. Though it was dissolved during the French Revolutionary Wars, it has two successor institutions that are considered to be the oldest universities in the Low Countries, and the oldest Catholic universities in the world still in operation.

A Democrat, Broussard is known nationally for appearances he made in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.  Life and career  Broussard was born in Marksville, the seat of Avoyelles Parish in south central Louisiana. He moved to Kenner, a city in Jefferson Parish, in 1958. He received a law degree from Loyola University New Orleans in 1973. The following year he was elected to the Jefferson Parish School Board and reelected in 1976. In 1977, he was elected as a district chairman to the Jefferson Parish Council and re-elected in 1981. He successfully ran for mayor of Kenner in 1982, and he was reelected in 1986, 1990, and 1994. Broussard was elected Chairman of the Jefferson Parish Council in 1995, and reelected in 1999. In 2003, Broussard was elected Jefferson Parish president. He defeated Republican John M. McDonald by a huge margin, 72-28 percent, even though Jefferson Parish is considered a GOP stronghold in Louisiana.http://www.sos.louisiana.gov:8090/cgibin/?rqstyp=elcpr&rqsdta;=10040326 Broussard was president of Parishes Against Coastal Erosion (PACE) and in a June 14, 2005, press release predicted: :With the National Hurricane Center predicting another active hurricane season, PACE President Aaron Broussard said he fears that it is going to take a major storm and significant loss of life before the nation acts responsibly.  Hurricane Katrina lawsuit  Many Jefferson Parish residents joined in a class action lawsuit against Broussard after he followed a years-old \\"doomsday plan\\" in the wake of Hurricane Katrina and evacuated more than 200 drainage pump operators north to Washington Parish. The pumps remained off for more than two days and sections of the parish, including Metairie and Kenner, experienced severe flooding as a result of rain water, backflow from Lake Ponchartrain and flood waters from the broken 17th Street Canal. Broussard defended his actions, saying that he wanted to protect the pump operators' lives, even though some pump operators were willing to stay. Other public officials, such as police and fire departments, did not evacuate. Water department workers also stayed.  September 4, 2005, Meet the Press appearance  The most famous of Broussard's post Katrina interviews was one on the television program Meet the Press. In the course of that interview, he was critical of the disaster-response effort. He finished with a tearful account of the death by drowning of his emergency services manager's mother. Broussard's account of that incident was subsequently shown to be inaccurate, in that the long sequence of telephone calls to the mother that he described as having taken place in the aftermath of the hurricane could not have happened, since she apparently drowned before the dates in question. In an appearance on Meet the Press three weeks later, Broussard was questioned about his account. He said that the story had been relayed to him by his staff, and that he had chosen not to ask his emergency manager for the exact circumstances of her death. Broussard and his employees were directly involved in the initial disaster-recovery efforts that followed Hurricane Katrina. On September 4, 2005 he was interviewed on NBC's Meet the Press, still inside his parish. Broussard called the response to Katrina ‚ÄúOne of the Worst Abandonments of Americans on American Soil Ever‚Äù and went on to say that FEMA had not only failed to meet his parish's need but actively withheld aid and cut his lines of communication: :Three quick examples. We had Wal-Mart deliver three trucks of water. FEMA turned them back. They said we didn‚Äôt need them. This was a week ago. FEMA, we had 1,000 gallons of diesel fuel on a Coast Guard vessel docked in my parish. When we got there with our trucks, FEMA says don‚Äôt give you the fuel. Yesterday ‚Äî yesterday ‚Äî FEMA comes in and cuts all of our emergency communication lines. They cut them without notice. Our sheriff, Harry Lee, goes back in, he reconnects the line. He posts armed guards and said no one is getting near these lines... after this, Broussard began to break out in tears. He said: :The guy who runs this building I'm in, Emergency Management, he's responsible for everything. His mother was trapped in St. Bernard nursing home, and every day she called him and said, 'Are you coming, son? Is somebody coming?' And he said, 'Yeah, Momma, somebody's coming to get you. Somebody's coming to get you on Tuesday. Somebody's coming to get you on Wednesday. Somebody's coming to get you on Thursday. Somebody's coming to get you on Friday' ‚Äî and she drowned on Friday night. She drowned on Friday night. Nobody's coming to get us, nobody's coming to get us. The secretary has promised, everybody's promised. They've had press conferences ‚Äî I'm sick of the press conferences. For God's sake, shut up and send us somebody! Other local politicians criticized the way the federal government handled the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin and Parish Presidents Junior Rodriguez from St. Bernard and Benny Rousselle from Plaquemines are among the most notable ones.  Subsequent reporting about the St. Rita's nursing home deaths  Subsequent news reports identified the son in the story as Tom Rodrigue, Jefferson Parish's emergency services director. Rodrigue's 92-year-old mother, Eva, lived in the St. Rita's nursing home. It appears from a CNN interview with Rodrigue that he made phone calls to the nursing home on Saturday, August 27, 2005, and on Sunday, August 28, 2005, and urged that the home be evacuated. That evacuation did not take place, and at least 30 residents of the nursing home drowned on Monday, August 29, 2005. A September 19, 2005, MSNBC story quotes Rodrigue as saying, in response to being told about Broussard's statements on Meet the Press, \\"No, no, that's not true.\\" A Broussard spokesperson described Broussard's statements about Rodrigue's mother on Meet the Press as \\"a misunderstanding.\\"  September 25, 2005, Meet the Press appearance  On September 25, 2005, Broussard reappeared on Meet the Press, and host Tim Russert challenged Broussard's account of the tragedy on the basis that his anecdote about the woman in the nursing home contained factual discrepancies noted in the MSNBC story. Broussard did not directly account for those discrepancies, repeating the statement that \\"this gentleman's mother died on that Friday before I came on the show.\\" In his subsequent remarks, though, he said that: * The story as related by him in his earlier appearance was the story told to him by his staff. * Tom Rodrigue was very distraught over his mother's death, and he (Broussard) wasn't inclined to interrogate him as to the specifics because of that. * Mistakes were made at all levels of the disaster response, including the evacuation of Jefferson Parish pump operators. * He hadn't had a full night's sleep in the past 30 days, and would be happy to debate someone as to the specifics of his story after having one. Broussard has never acknowledged making an error in his original appearance though he did give this response: :Sir, with everything I said on Meet the Press, the last punctuation of my statements were the story that I was going to tell in about maybe two sentences. It just got emotional for me, sir. To date, Broussard's comments with regard to the federal government have not been formally addressed. Broussard was also excluded from the formal investigation conducted into the response to Hurricane Katrina and thus was not called to explain his role in the $3 billion of flood damage to the East Bank of Jefferson Parish. Recall petition On December 6, 2005 the Jefferson Parish Action Committee filed a petition with the Louisiana Secretary of State to recall Broussard and remove him as President of Jefferson Parish. The group cited numerous lapses in judgment by Broussard both pre and post Katrina, including the following: * Federal investigators issued grand jury subpoenas to Broussard and 24th District Judge Kernan \\"Skip\\" Hand for records of political donations to Hand's campaigns from Bail Bonds Unlimited.http://www.nola.com/news/t-p/frontpage/index.ssf?/base/news-4/1124345510247860.xml * Broussard ordered the evacuation of pump operators prior to Hurricane Katrina to Washington Parish. As a consequence the pump operators were not on duty at the pumping stations until 3:30 am August 30, 2005. * The resulting flooding of Jefferson Parish has been estimated by insurance industry sources at $3 to $5 billion. * Under emergency powers granted to the Parish President, Broussard appropriated the Meadowcrest hospital to use as a hotel for parish employees. When Meadowcrest notified the parish that it was planning on re- opening the hospital, Broussard moved to block this reopening despite a dire need for both hospital and emergency medical services. He cited his need for hotel accommodations for parish employees. He declined to return control of the hospital, forcing Meadowcrest Hospital to lay off employees and inform over 800 employees that they may face layoffs. * In four full-page ads in the [Times-Picayune] costing $38,000, Broussard defended his actions taken during Hurricane Katrina, including his decision to evacuate the pump operators. Broussard's spokesman, Greg Buisson, said that the cost of the ads could be reimbursed by FEMA. FEMA spokesman Mike McCormick said that he knew of no category under which the cost of the ads would be reimbursed.http://www.nola.com/news/t-p/frontpage/index.ssf?/base/news-4/1129615779205800.xml * Broussard also appropriated private property to use for various post hurricane clean up purposes. Several of these property owners sued Jefferson Parish for compensation to repair significant damage to their property caused by parish operations. Broussard acknowledged the damage but told the property owners to collect the debt from FEMA. The recall campaign obtained over 49,000 signatures, but this was fewer than the 93,000 signatures (1/3 of the registered voters in Jefferson parish) required under Louisiana law. Re- election campaign *Allen Leone, a Republican and an Owner of a Keller Williams Realty Franchise in Laplace LA, announced on May 2, 2007, that he was entering the race to challenge Broussard for president of Jefferson Parish. Broussard won re-election narrowly with 52 percent of the vote over Leone. The East Bank of Jefferson went for Leone while Broussard carried the West Bank [14] At the Alliance for Good Government forum Broussard refused to say he would stop taking money from Parish contractors. The alliance instead endorsed Leone but it was not enough to carry him to victory. [15] Resignation Broussard resigned his position on January 8, 2010 in the face of a grand jury investigation of his staff.\\"Jefferson Parish President Broussard resigns\\", Times-Picayune, January 8, 2010.\\"Broussard to resign\\", WWL.com, January 8, 2010.

Lone Star opened its first restaurant in 1989 in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. In March 1992, Lone Star became a public company with eight restaurants opened. At its maximum, 267 Lone Star Steakhouses were in operation. The company filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy on September 7, 2017. , the still-operating company website advertised four locations, all of which are independently confirmed closed. Also , only one independently owned and operated location of this restaurant still exists according to Yelp in Tamuning, Guam. On October 6, 2019, the second-to-last location in Knightdale, North Carolina officially closed, which was the last Lone Star location in the continental United States. The location became a Saltgrass Steakhouse.  History  Lone Star was founded by Jamie B. Coulter, who started his restaurant career as a major franchisee of the Pizza Hut chain. Separately, a company called Creative Culinary Concepts opened a prototype Lone Star Steakhouse & Saloon restaurant in Winston-Salem, North Carolina in 1989. in 1991, Coulter signed an agreement with Creative Culinary Concepts to open 4 Lone Star restaurants, which would have a Texas Roadhouse- style ambiance. Coulter incorporated Lone Star Steakhouse & Saloon in January of 1992, becoming the President, CEO, and Chairman of the chain. The chain, at this point featuring eight restaurants, went public in March of 1992 to raise the cash for expansion. The initial public offering raised $91 million. In 1993, 1994, and 1995, Lone Star was awarded the distinction of \\"best small business in the country\\" by Forbes magazine, and in 1994 ranked #6 in Fortune magazine's list of fastest-growing companies - a higher rank than any other restaurant. Coulter himself was named chief executive of the year in 1996 by Restaurants and Institutions. By the end of 1995, there were 182 restaurants in operation, which expanded further to 205 locations by March of 1997 and further yet to 265 by the end of that same year. However, Lone Star faced problems with market saturation, rising food and labor costs, declining same- store sales, and management turnover as the company entered the late 90s. The company's growth came to a sudden halt, with the chain reaching its maximum extent of 267 restaurants after opening just two in all of 1998, and ended the 1990s with 265 restaurants after closing two in 1999. During this time, the company's stock price plummetted from $46 in 1996 to just $6 by the end of 1998. As a result of this turmoil, a minor shareholder in Lone Star, Guy W. Adams, waged a successful battle to unseat Coulter as Chairman of the Board of Directors of the company he had founded, though Coulter maintained his position of CEO. Lone Star had begun to seek a buyer to take the company private in 2002. = Private buyout = On August 18, 2006, the 222-restaurant large Lone Star Steakhouse chain signed an agreement to be acquired by Lone Star Funds, an unaffiliated, Dallas-based private equity firm, for $27.10 per share in cash. This initial agreement was opposed by some major shareholders.TheDealBlogs -- The Deal Blogs Network On November 11, 2006, Lone Star Funds raised its offer to $27.35 per share. On December 12, 2006, shareholders voted to accept the offer. Because it became private, Lone Star Steakhouse has been de-listed from NASDAQ. This is also the reason Lone Star stopped sponsoring the #40 Dodge of David Stremme. Following the buyout, new and remodeled Lone Star Steakhouse locations switched from the classic \\"Texas Roadhouse\\" theme to a more urban-style restaurant, abandoning most of the Texas and cowboy themes in its older restaurants. The newer restaurant design is more upscale, with virtually none of the Americana seen in the pre-2006 restaurants. Under Lone Star Funds' ownership, and largely in response to the Great Recession, Lone Star significantly reduced its restaurant locations. This included closures in early 2009 that totaled 27 restaurants, bringing the chain down to 152 stores. The closures continued, including another large- scale store closing in September of 2010 that saw another 19 units close, bringing the chain down to 112 stores. In December 2013, Lone Star Steakhouse and Texas Land & Cattle restaurant chains were acquired by the newly formed Day Star Restaurant Group, at which point there were 78 Lone Star Steakhouses in operation. Day Star co-founder Scott Smith left Day Star in March 2016 due to disagreements with his business partners over the direction of the company. After Smith's departure, restaurant closures accelerated, with the Lone Star brand declining from 64 locations at the end of December 2015 down to 16 locations in January 2017. Among these closures was the closure of the original Lone Star Steakhouse in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, which shut down in the summer of 2016. After closing most of the remaining restaurants, Lone Star Steakhouse filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on February 13, 2017. The company claimed that the remaining restaurants were sold to a new owner on July 31, 2017, and for that reason explained that any gift cards would no longer be honored. The Chapter 11 restructuring was converted to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing on September 7, 2017. , the company website lists 4 locations, all of which have closed. The website lists locations in Mount Vernon, Illinois, which closed in March 2019; in Mount Pleasant, Michigan, which closed on October 5, 2018; in Asheville, North Carolina, which closed on July 2, 2018; and in Middletown, Ohio, which closed in September of 2018. Yelp indicates that one instance of this restaurant still exists by name in Tamuning, Guam.  Associated restaurants  = Sullivan's = Sullivan's Steakhouse was conceived of by Lone Star founder Jamie Coulter in 1995, who sought to introduce a new restaurant brand that would cater to the lower end of the upscale steakhouse market, where checks would average $35 per patron. The restaurants, named after boxer John L. Sullivan, were inspired by 1940's interior decor that was designed with an 80% male clientele in mind. The first Sullivan's opened its doors in May of 1996 in Austin, Texas. Sullivan's hit an all-time high of 20 restaurants by 2011. Sullivan's separated from Lone Star in 2012, when the Del Frisco's Restaurant Group, consisting of 32 restaurants under the Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steak House, Del Frisco's Grille, and Sullivan's Steakhouse banners, went public. The original Sullivan's Steakhouse in Austin closed on January 9, 2018. The Del Frisco's Restaurant Group sold its then-14 unit Sullivan's Steakhouse division to Romano's Macaroni Grill in September 2018 in order to pay off debts. As of July 2019, there are 13 Sullivan's Steakhouses in operation. = Del Frisco's = Del Frisco's was founded in 1981, and was bought out by Lone Star Steakhouse & Saloon shortly before the launch of the Sullivan's Steakhouse brand. Del Frisco's would serve as the most upscale of the Lone Star Steakhouse family of restaurants. The Del Frisco's Restaurant Group, including restaurants under the Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steak House, Del Frisco's Grille, and Sullivan's Steakhouse banners, separated from Lone Star when it went public in 2012. As of July 2019, there are a total of 16 Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steak House restaurants and 24 Del Frisco's Grille restaurants in operation. = Texas Land & Cattle = As of 2002, Texas Land and Cattle steakhouses (stylized TXLC) were part of The Steak Company, a corporate umbrella that also owned the Lone Star, Sullivan's, and Del Frisco's brands. Texas Land & Cattle was purchased along with Lone Star Steakhouse from Lone Star Funds by Day Star Restaurant Group in December 2013; at the time of the sale, there were 27 Texas Land & Cattle restaurants, most of which were in the state of Texas. At the end of December 2015, 25 TXLC remained in operation, but this figure dropped to 15 units by January of 2017. TXLC entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection along with Lone Star in February of 2017. The company claimed that the remaining restaurants were sold to a new owner on July 31st, 2017, and for that reason any gift cards were no longer being honored. The bankruptcy converted to Chapter 7 in September of 2017, and the case continues to this day. As of July 2019, the Texas Land & Cattle website lists 3 open locations, although one of them has reportedly permanently closed.  Lone Star Steakhouse & Saloon Australia  Lone Star Steakhouse & Saloon first opened in Australia, at Parramatta in January 1993 after acquiring the naming rights from a Melbourne-based franchise of the same name. Over the next seven and a half years, Lone Star expanded to 21 stores across Australia. However, following an August 2000 business review of its operations Lone Star shut down 10 stores across Australia. On December 22, 2003, the American parent sold the 11 remaining Lone Star Restaurants operating in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland to Robert LaPointe and Tim Smith. In April 2010, Outback Jacks Bar & Grill purchased all five New South Wales-based restaurants, intending to rebrand them once franchisees were found.Outback Jacks takes over Lone Star in Sydney On 1 July 2011, Lone Star Steakhouse announced that they would close all Queensland stores immediately. In September 2017 the rebranded Lone Star Rib House opened a store in North Lakes shopping centre in Brisbane's north adding to its other stores in Mackay, Springfield and the Gold coast. Tossing your free peanut shells on the floor has also made a comeback. In late 2011, Outback Steakhouse added the former Lone Star site of Penrith to its growing list of restaurants after extensive remodelling. In October 2011, the original Parramatta store closed its doors.

Illegalism is a tendency of anarchism that developed primarily in France, Italy, Belgium and Switzerland during the early 1900s as an outgrowth of individualist anarchism.\\"The illegalisis in this study,...As anarchist individualists, they came from a milieu whose most important theoretical inspiration was undoubtedly Max Stimer‚Äîwhose work The Ego and Its Own remains the most powerful negation of the State, and affirmation of the individual, to date.\\"‚ÄîRichard Parry, The Bonnot Gang: the history of the French illegalists], 1987, p. 5.\\"Parallel to the social, collectivist anarchist current there was an individualist one whose partisans emphasized their individual freedom and advised other individuals to do the same...Some individualists rebelled by withdrawing from the economy and forming voluntary associations to achieve self-sufficiency. Others took the route of illegalism, attacking the economy through the direct individual reappropriation of wealth. Thus theft, counterfeiting, swindling and robbery became a way of life for hundreds of individualists, as it was already for countless thousands of proletarians.‚Äî\\"The \\"Illegalists\\"\\" by Doug Imrie (from Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed, Fall-Winter, 1994‚Äì95) Illegalists embrace criminality either openly or secretly as a lifestyle. Illegalism does not specify the type of crime, though it is associated with theft and shoplifting. Illegalism is founded on egoist anarchism and the philosophy of Max Stirner as justification for criminal behaviour. However, not all illegalists are supporters of Stirner and his philosophy. Jules Bonnot and the Bonnot Gang are recognised as notable illegalists. As left-wing anarchists, the illegalists strongly oppose wage labour and markets.  Emergence  Illegalism first rose to prominence among a generation of Europeans inspired by the unrest of the 1890s, during which Ravachol, √âmile Henry, Auguste Vaillant and Caserio committed daring crimes in the name of anarchism, in what is known as propaganda of the deed. Influenced by theorist Max Stirner's egoism,\\"a new generation of anarchists, spurred on by the individualist' ideas of Max Stirner, were to take as their point of departure exactly what Jean Grave objected to, that the rebel who secretly stole was no more than an ordinary thief. The developing theory of 'illegalism^ had no moral basis> recognizing only the reality of might in place of a theory of 'right'. Illegal acts were to be done simply to satisfy one's desires, not for the greater glory of some external 'ideal'. The illegalists were to make a theory of theft without the embarrassment of theoretical justifications.\\" ‚Äî Richard Parry. The Bonnot Gang: the history of the French illegalists. 1987. the illegalists in France broke from anarchists like Cl√©ment Duval and Marius Jacob who justified theft with a theory of individual reclamation (la reprise individuelle). Instead, the illegalists argued that their actions required no moral basis and illegal acts were taken not in the name of a higher ideal, but in pursuit of one's own desires. In Paris, this milieu was centred on the weekly papers L'Anarchie and the Causeries Populaires (regular discussion groups meeting in several different locations in and around the capital each week), both of which were founded by Albert Libertad and his associates.Richard Parry. The Bonnot Gang: the history of the French illegalists. 1987. p. 5. L'Anarchie, 3 January 1907 After Peter Kropotkin along with others decided to enter labor unions after their initial reservations,\\"This inability to break definitively with collectivism in all its forms also exhibited itself over the question of the workers' movement, which divided anarchist-communism into a number of tendencies.\\" \\"Anarchist- Communism\\" by Alain Pengam there remained the anti-syndicalist anarchist- communists, who in France were grouped around Sebastien Faure's Le Libertaire. From 1905 onwards, the Russian counterparts of these anti-syndicalist anarchist-communists become partisans of economic terrorism and illegal expropriations. Illegalism as a practice emerged and within it \\"[t]he acts of the anarchist bombers and assassins (\\"propaganda by the deed\\") and the anarchist burglars (\\"individual reappropriation\\") expressed their desperation and their personal, violent rejection of an intolerable society. Moreover, they were clearly meant to be exemplary, invitations to revolt\\".\\"The \\"illegalists\\" by Doug Imrie. From \\"Anarchy: a Journal Of Desire Armed\\", Fall‚ÄìWinter, 1994‚Äì95 In another less dramatic sense, \\"[at] that time this term was used to indicate all those practices prohibited by law that were useful for resolving the economic problems of comrades: robbery, theft, smuggling, counterfeiting money and so on\\".\\"Beyond the Law\\" by Penelope Nin on Various Authors Articles from ‚ÄúCanenero‚Äù Such acts of rebellion which could be individual were in the long run seen as acts of rebellion which could ignite a mass insurrection leading to revolution. Proponents and activists of this tactic among others included Johann Most, Luigi Galleani, Victor Serge and Severino Di Giovanni. In Argentina, these tendencies flourished at the end of the 1920s and during the 1930s, \\"years of acute repression and of flinching of the once powerful workers movement‚Äîthis was a desperation, though heroic, of a decadent movement\\". Caricature of the Bonnot Gang France's Bonnot Gang was the most famous group to embrace illegalism. The Bonnot Gang (La Bande √† Bonnot) was a French criminal anarchist group that operated in France and Belgium during the Belle √âpoque from 1911 to 1912. Composed of individuals who identified with the emerging illegalist milieu, the gang utilized cutting-edge technology (including automobiles and repeating rifles) not yet available to the French police. Originally referred to by the press as simply \\"The Auto Bandits\\", the gang was dubbed \\"The Bonnot Gang\\" after Jules Bonnot gave an interview at the office of Petit Parisien, a popular daily paper. Bonnot's perceived prominence within the group was later reinforced by his high-profile death during a shootout with French police in Nogent-sur-Marne.  Criticism  Following his arrest for harbouring members of the Bonnot Gang, Victor Serge, once a forceful defender of illegalism, became a sharp critic. In Memoirs of a Revolutionary, he describes illegalism as \\"a collective suicide\\".Memoirs of a Revolutionary, by Victor Serge Similarly, Marius Jacob reflected in 1948: \\"I don't think that illegalism can free the individual in present-day society... Basically, illegalism, considered as an act of revolt, is more a matter of temperament than of doctrine\\".The \\"Illegalists\\" , by Doug Imrie (published by Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed)  Influence  Illegalism has been updated by currents such as insurrectionary anarchism and post-left anarchy. In Spain and Latin America, a campaign called Yomango has appeared, which advocates shoplifting and thus updates individual reclamation. Horst Fantazzini\\"Horst Biography\\" was an Italian-German individualist anarchist\\"He always considered himself an individualist anarchist.\\" \\"Horst Biography\\" who pursued an illegalist lifestyle and practice until his death in 2001. He gained media notoriety mainly due to his many bank robberies through Italy and other countries.

A theta structure is an intermediate structure formed during the replication of a circular DNA molecule. Two replication forks can proceed independently around the DNA ring and when viewed from above the structure resembles the Greek letter \\"theta\\" (Œ∏). Originally discovered by John Cairns, it led to the understanding that (in this case) bidirectional DNA replication could take place. Proof of the bidirectional nature came from providing replicating cells with a pulse of tritiated thymidine, quenching rapidly and then autoradiographing. Results showed that the radioactive thymidine was incorporated into both forks of the theta structure, not just one, indicating synthesis at both forks in opposite directions around the loop. References Category:DNA replication ","title":"Theta structure"},{"id":"2616811","text":"This is a list of fictional characters who were companions of the Doctor, in various spin-off media based on the long-running British science fiction television series, Doctor Who. A =Amy= Amy, portrayed by Ciara Janson, is a companion of the Fifth Doctor in the Key 2 Time series, which includes the plays The Judgement of Isskar, The Destroyer of Delights and The Chaos Pool. She is a human \\"tracer\\", a device designed to track down the segments of the Key to Time across the universe. When the Doctor meets Amy, she is just a few seconds old and recruits the Doctor as her companion to find the Key. At the end of The Chaos Pool, Romana invites Amy to live on Gallifrey and enroll in their Academy. Amy (now renamed Abby) and her sister Zara return in their own mini-series Graceless. =Antimony= Antimony was a companion of the Seventh Doctor and appeared in the webcast story Death Comes to Time by Colin Meek (widely understood to be a pseudonym for Dan Freedman). At the start of the story, the listener was not aware of the circumstances of his and the Doctor's meeting. Antimony appeared to be a young humanoid male who was slightly unworldly and naive, for example believing there were still Allosauruses roaming the Earth. During Antimony and the Doctor's battle against the renegade Time Lord, General Tannis, it was revealed that Antimony was in fact an android constructed by the Doctor. The Doctor in Death Comes to Time was very old and, saddened by the death and departure of many companions, had built Antimony as a companion who would never leave him. Tannis totally destroyed Antimony, leaving the Doctor grief-stricken over Antimony's death. Kevin Eldon provided the voice of Antimony. The illustrations, by Lee Sullivan, depicted Antimony as a humanoid with purplish skin, nonetheless bearing a slight resemblance to Eldon. =Antranak= Antranak was the name Erimem gave to the stray cat she brought aboard the Fifth Doctor's TARDIS at the end of The Eye of the Scorpion. Erimem had adopted the cat, who had in the course of events absorbed a malevolent alien intelligence harmlessly into its mind. Erimem and Peri were quite fond of the cat, the Doctor less so. Antranak departed in Nekromanteia, swapping places with the non-corporeal manifestation of a being called Shara, thereby saving the planet Talderun from destruction. The Doctor later wondered if the alien creature in the cat's mind forced him to act. Erimem, however, remained firm in her belief that her noble cat sacrificed himself of his own accord. =ARC= ARC was an alien creature who travelled with the Eleventh Doctor, Alice Obiefune and John Jones in several 2014/2015 Titan Comics stories. =Aristedes= Captain Lysandra Aristedes was introduced as a member of the Forge in the standalone Forge novel Project: Valhalla (2005).

She initially hates the Doctor, believing him to be responsible for the deaths of her friends when the Forge's previous headquarters were destroyed. However, she learns to respect the Doctor when she sees him develop a cure for a mutating plague sweeping London where her supervisor Nimrod explicitly modified the cure to kill those infected, and ultimately orders the final destruction of the Forge. Three months later, the Doctor returns and invites her to travel with him, as explained in Black and White. She and the Doctor also travel with another military companion, Private Sally Morgan. They are heard together in the Companion Chronicles story Project: Nirvana and their final story Gods and Monsters. =Arnold= Arnold, a boy from the 30th century, was a short-lived companion for the Third Doctor in the pages of TV Comic in 1973.

He accompanied Dr Who, together with Dr Who's niece Louise and granddaughter Susan, to the year 2150, where they discovered that the Daleks had invaded Earth. After helping to defeat the Daleks, Dr Who returned him to London a few minutes before the robbery was due to take place, enabling him to catch the thieves.

After helping The Doctor discover a Dalek weapons factory where they were building a de-mat weapon, a temporal cannon, in order to destroy Gallifrey, they escaped and warned the Time Lords of the danger. After meeting Rassilon and the High Council on Gallifrey, Cinder was kidnapped by the Time Lords Karlax and The Castellan, and subjected to a mind probe to verify The Doctor's story. The Doctor rescued her from them and they fled to the Death Zone on Gallifrey, and took Borusa, who was being used by Rassilon as a possibility engine, from his captivity in the Dark Tower at its center. After the Time Lords decided that the best course of action was to destroy Moldox, and all the surrounding systems by using the Tear of Isha on the Eye of Tantalus, a black hole being used by the Daleks to power their temporal cannon, and thereby killing billions of sentient beings, she and the doctor fled with the Time Lords' possibility engine. During their time together The Doctor and Cinder realised that there was more to life than fighting the time war and planned to travel together after the Daleks where defeated. However she was shot and killed by Karlax, a Time Lord who had been sent to kill The Doctor, in order to remove the random elements from possibility engine predictions, before this could happen. She threw herself between them, taking the shot meant for The Doctor. After her death the Doctor left Karlax to die at the hands of the Dalek Eternity Circle. After the liberation of Moldox, The Doctor located the remains of Cinder's family and buried them at their homestead.

After several adventures with the Doctor it is revealed in the final issue that she is in fact a living painting rescued by the Twelfth Doctor and Clara, the Twelfth Doctor sending her to his younger self to keep her safe and help her find her owne identity, the older Doctor recognizing that his younger self was 'better qualified' to help Josie explore her humanity.

Eventually, with the help of Rassilon, Merlin, and the Matrix-powered Time Lord agent known as Shayde, the Doctor confronts Melanicus in a time-altered version of a Stockbridge church. During the ensuing fight the Doctor is knocked unconscious, while Justin kills Melanicus at the cost of his own life. With the time stream restored the Doctor regains consciousness in the church, now named St. Justinian's, wondering if it has all been a dream.

In it, she travelled from her version of 1965 back to 1944, where the Seventh Doctor erased her alternate timeline. She survived, however, and later resurfaced in Kenya, 1953 in the 2010 story A Thousand Tiny Wings, where the Doctor takes her on as a travelling companion. However, after she steals the Doctor's TARDIS and uses it to create a new timeline in which the Nazis rule the galaxy in The Architects of History, the Time Lords take action and send the Doctor of that alternate timeline to totally remove her from history. In the correct timeline, Elizabeth Klein was a member of UNIT in the 1970s. This version of Klein reappears in the 2012 audio play UNIT Dominion, where she learns of the existence of her alternate self. In July 2013, Klein returned for another trilogy of taleshttp://www.bigfinish.com/releases/v/persuasion-713 with the Seventh Doctor, also accompanied by her assistant Will Arrowsmith, the Doctor wanting her aid to both investigate the remaining anomalies of her paradoxical existence and help him tie up some loose ends in this life out of concern that his successor will be unable to be as ruthless as he has been. =Kroton= Kroton is a character appearing the Doctor Who Magazine comic strip. He is a Cyberman that has retained human emotions and becomes a companion of the Eighth Doctor. L =Larna= Larna was a Time Lord who assisted the Doctor during The Infinity Doctors, and later appeared in The Gallifrey Chronicles. A Larna also appeared in Unnatural History, and recognised the Doctor, but it is unclear if this was the same character. A short story, \\"Birth of a Renegade\\" by Eric Saward published in the Radio Times special commemorating the 20th anniversary of Doctor Who, had previously established Lady Larna as the true Gallifreyan name of Susan Foreman. =Lorenzo= A companion of the Eighth Doctor first mentioned in a flashback sequence in the novel The Year of Intelligent Tigers by Kate Orman, which took place in the South Seas in 1935. Lorenzo is mentioned again in The Gallifrey Chronicles by Lance Parkin. =Louise= Louise (portrayed by Jill Curzon) is the niece of Dr. Who in the film Daleks' Invasion Earth 2150 A.D.. In the plot Louise takes the role filled by Barbara Wright in the television serial The Dalek Invasion of Earth, on which the film is based. The character also appears in the Doctor Who Magazine comic strip story Daleks Versus the Martians. M =Trix MacMillan= Beatrix (Trix) Macmillan is a companion of the Eighth Doctor, appearing in the Eighth Doctor Adventures series of Doctor Who novels.

An \\"eco-warrior\\", she was rescued by the Valeyard from being hit by a police car during an environmental protest, and she accompanied him on his quest to conquer time. He later killed her, to make the point that he was no longer the Doctor. It is hinted she might have known the Doctor before he became the Valeyard as she frequently refers to him, much to the Valeyard's annoyance, as the Doctor, \\"Champion of Justice\\". In Big Finish's regular Doctor Who continuity, Martin is a friend of Sarah Jane Smith, and appeared in the first series of Sarah Jane audio adventures. When the Sarah Jane audios were initially announced, the role of Ellie Martin was listed as (books companion) Sam Jones; her \\"eco-warrior\\" past may be a reference to that former origin. =Heather McCrimmon= Heather McCrimmon was a companion of the Tenth Doctor in the comic strips printed in the Doctor Who Adventures magazine. A history student at Edinburgh university, she was created by a reader as part of a competition to create and design a new companion for the strip. She debuted in the issue on sale 31 December 2008. During her travels she was joined by another companion Wolfgang 'Wolfie' Ryter, who was likewise designed by a reader of the magazine. It is also suggested she's a descendant of Second Doctor TV companion Jamie McCrimmon. She departed in the story \\"Dead Line\\" which was published in the issue on sale 4 February 2010. However, she returned for a final appearance in the story \\"Lucky Heather\\" published on 25 March 2010 which, unusually for a Doctor Who Adventures comic story, took place during the Tenth Doctor's final TV story The End of Time. =Robert McIntosh= Played by Christian Coulson, Robert McIntosh was a young science student from Scotland, who assisted the Fifth Doctor in The Haunting of Thomas Brewster.

Mila was a human prisoner of the Daleks, who experimented on her using bio-engineered viruses. As a result of these endeavours, she lost most of her memories and eventually became invisible and non-corporeal, as well as gaining other strange abilities. She escaped from the Daleks and sneaked on board the First Doctor's TARDIS, possibly during the events of The Chase. She remained in the TARDIS, unseen by anyone for centuries. She silently watched the Doctor, growing obsessed by his heroics and longing to be a real companion. During the Sixth Doctor's life, she met Charley Pollard, the only companion unprotected by the TARDIS' biological defences. Mila managed to transfer her afflictions to Charley, while simultaneously adopting Charley's physical form. She was then able to travel with the Doctor, pretending to be Charley, while the real Charley was left invisible and alone. Eventually Charley was cured by the Viyrans and Mila gave her life to save the Doctor. The Viyrans also altered the Sixth Doctor's memories so that he remembers his adventures with Charley as being with Mila's name and face, thus avoiding the potential temporal paradox of the Sixth Doctor meeting an older Charley before his eighth incarnation would save the younger one. =Lucie Miller= Lucie Miller is a companion of the Eighth Doctor, who appears in a series of Doctor Who audio plays produced by Big Finish Productions. The character is voiced by Sheridan Smith. The Eighth Doctor mentions her by name in the 2013 mini-episode, \\"The Night of the Doctor\\", which features his regeneration into the War Doctor. =Ruth Mills= Ruth Mills (played by Siri O'Neal) was the companion and foster daughter of an alternate version of the Doctor in the Big Finish Productions Doctor Who Unbound audio play Full Fathom Five by David Bishop. This Doctor (played by David Collings) had raised Ruth since 2039, when her father, Dr Vollmer, was lost in the destruction of the Deep-sea Energy Exploration Project (DEEP) undersea naval base. When the DEEP was rediscovered in 2066, the Doctor hired a mini-sub to get to the base before the naval recovery team. However, Ruth stowed away on board the mini-sub against the Doctor's wishes. After Ruth and the Doctor reached the base, Ruth eventually discovered that the Doctor was responsible for her father's death. There had been illegal genetic experimentation going on in the base and the Doctor had killed Vollmer to prevent any information on the experiments from getting out. Still believing that the ends justified the means, the Doctor had simply returned to the DEEP base to regain his TARDIS, which had been left there when he abandoned the base. Horrified that the man who raised her had been lying to her, Ruth shot the Doctor and watched his face change. Ruth shot the new incarnation of the Doctor, and as he changed again, wondered how many times she would have to shoot him before he stayed dead. =Miranda= Miranda is a companion and the adopted daughter of the Eighth Doctor, appearing in the Eighth Doctor Adventures series of novels series published by BBC Books. The character also featured in her own short-lived comic book. =Tara Mishra= =Sally Morgan= Private Sally Morgan met the Seventh Doctor while she was undergoing a military experiment involving psychic abilities in the year 2020.

The character first appears in Dark Eyes (2012), an audio box set from Big Finish Productions. She first meets the Doctor in the battlefields of France, subsequently becoming involved in a chase across time pursued by the Daleks. She is described as having extremely dark eyes, which are revealed to be caused by \\"retrogenitor particles\\" which the Daleks have implanted in her in an attempted to destroy the Time Lords. Ultimately the plan backfires when the Dalek Time Controller rewrites time, eliminating the particles. Molly subsequently returns to the First World War battlefields, later being reunited with the Doctor in 1918 in the midst of a Viyran incursion. Following this she once more becomes the Doctor's travelling companion, helping him to defeat the Eminence with the assistance of Liv Chenka, who subsequently joins Molly and the Doctor on their travels. She is mentioned by the Eighth Doctor in the TV mini-episode \\"The Night of the Doctor\\". =Olla= Olla was very briefly a companion of the Seventh Doctor in the Doctor Who Magazine comic strips.

A-Lux was a resort planet which the Ice Warriors were planning to freeze and turn into a new Mars. Olla helped the Doctor and Frobisher defeat the Ice Warriors, and when Frobisher elected to stay behind, the Doctor took her on board as his newest companion. The Doctor, however, was mildly disturbed by the way Olla kept waiting on him hand and foot. Her stint in the TARDIS was short-lived. In the very next story, Redemption (DWM #134), Olla's former master, the Vachysian warlord Skaroux (a legal enforcer for the Galactic Federation), intercepted the TARDIS and demanded her return. It transpired that Olla had stolen Skaroux's money and then become a fugitive. The Doctor agreed to hand her over on the condition that she receive a fair trial, and Skaroux and Olla left together. P =Majenta Pryce= Majenta Pryce is introduced in the Doctor Who Magazine issue 394 comic strip \\"Hotel Historia\\" as an alien entrepreneur running an illegal time-travel operation on Earth. Her organisation is shut down by the Tenth Doctor, and she swears revenge against him when she is arrested. The character returns in \\"Thinktwice\\", a three-part story beginning in DWM issue 400. She is now a convict on a space-station prison where the inmates are subject to repeated memory wipes, supposedly to rehabilitate them but actually to feed parasitic lifeforms called the Memovax. The Doctor defeats the Memovax and rescues Majenta. Her memories do not return, however, and holding the Doctor responsible for this, she insists on staying with him until he finds a way to reverse the process. Elements of Majenta's past subsequently come to light in the stories \\"Mortal Beloved\\" (DWM #406-407), \\"The Age of Ice\\" (DWM# 408-410) and \\"The Crimson Hand\\" (DWM# 416-420), in which it is revealed that she is part of a powerful crime organisation called the Crimson Hand, a group of ruthless beings who possessed the Manus Mallificus, a hand-shaped device that can reshape reality. Having accepted their invitation to join the group, Majenta is horrified by their use of the Malus to destroy an inhabited planet. She attempts to escape but at the last minute accepts the Crimson Hand's offer to rejoin them, and seemingly destroys the Doctor. Majenta then attempts to use the Malus to convert her home planet, Vessica, into a utopia. When a spatial rift threatens Veccia, and the inhabitants rebel against her rule, Majenta calls back the Doctor, who in reality she has only sent away. With the Doctor's help, Majenta cuts the rest of the Hand off from their power source, destroying them and nearly dying in the process. Majenta then settles on the planet Redemption (\\"The Deep Hereafter\\", DWM #412). =Charley Pollard= Charlotte (Charley) Pollard is a companion of the Eighth Doctor, appearing in a series of Doctor Who audio plays produced by Big Finish Productions.

A temporary solution is found in Sword of Orion, but the Doctor and Charley know that he must ultimately be returned to his natural habitat. As they approach the centre of the vortex, however, he attacks Charley. Ramsay has sensed the fracturing web of time around her, the result of the Doctor's intervention preventing her death in the Airship R101 crash. The Doctor manages to expel Ramsay through the open doors of the TARDIS, but the ship and the Doctor are damaged in the process, leading to the events of Minuet in Hell. =Ria (Lies in Ruins)= Ria is a companion to the Eighth Doctor appearing in Big Finish audio story Lies in Ruins.

Along with that future Doctor, she met the Seventh Doctor and Ace who were also attending the party and was involved in the subsequent brawl provoked by an inebriated Beep the Meep. Nothing else is known about her, although her Doctor's appearance was subsequently used as a disguise in a complex ruse by the Eighth Doctor against the time-travelling mercenaries known as the Threshold. The appearance of Ria was a sly reference to the series of unofficial audio plays produced as the Audio Visuals series in the 1980s, which featured Nicholas Briggs as the Doctor. Ria was played by several different actresses including Liz Knight, Patricia Merrick and Heather Barker. =Ruby Duvall= Assisted the Doctor in the Virgin New Adventures Novel Iceberg; after having one adventure, the Doctor left her behind in 2006.

Serena is a member of an eminent but un-influential Time Lord family, who has ambitions to become President of the Time Lord High Council. She is assigned to accompany the Second Doctor on a mission for the Celestial Intervention Agency, to improve her political credentials. Serena and the Doctor initially have an uneasy relationship. She is effectively his parole officer, having the authority to give him orders, and objects to him calling her his assistant. The Doctor resents having a companion forced upon him. During the course of their mission, however, they begin to appreciate each other's talents. Uncovering a plot to assassinate the Duke of Wellington at a ball held on the eve of Waterloo, Serena is killed when a shot intended for Wellington destroys both of her hearts, preventing her from regenerating. She is buried in a simple grave marked only with her name; SERENA. Once back on Gallifrey, the Doctor refuses to go on any more missions for the Agency unless various conditions are met, including the placing of Serena's name on the Gallifreyan Honour Roll, and that he be allowed to tell her family how she died. =Sheena= Sheena is a companion to the Eighth Doctor during the early stages of the Time War. How she came to join the Doctor is thus far unknown. She is seen with him during Big Finish Productions audio drama The Starship of Theseus, in which the timelines begin to change due to the war.

When he begs the Doctor to save him the Doctor declines saying he's \\"never known anyone of that name\\" and Sharpe is presumed dead. =Helen Sinclair= Helen Sinclair is a companion of the Eighth Doctor in the Doom Coalition series. Initially working as a museum assistant in 1963, but frustrated at her inability to advance further due to gender stereotypes, Helen assists the Doctor and his companion Liv Chenka in investigating a mystery surrounding a collection of artefacts, and is subsequently invited to travel with them after she is accused of the theft of the artefacts.

The character also appears in the Dell comic strip adaptation of the film, the follow-up film adaptation Daleks' Invasion Earth 2150 A.D. (1966), the Doctor Who Magazine comic strip story Daleks Versus the Martians and the short story The House on Oldark Moor by Justin Richards.

She reappeared in the audio drama Dust Breeding, at the end of which she travels to the 20th century with the Seventh Doctor and Ace. She seems to have made at least one more journey in the TARDIS, as she is next heard of in the 27th century in Big Finish's Bernice Summerfield audio drama The Bellotron Incident, where it is revealed that \\"a mutual friend\\" has brought her to Bernice's time. All three of these stories were written by Mike Tucker. Tarrant later became a regular character in the Bernice Summerfield books and audio dramas, where she was played by Louise Faulkner. Her surname is an in-joke based on the fan perception that Terry Nation, the creator of the Daleks, was overly fond of using the name \\"Tarrant\\" in his scripts. =Stacy Townsend= Stacy Townsend is a companion of the fictional character in the Eighth Doctor, appearing in the Radio Times Doctor Who comic strip. =Fey Truscott-Sade= Fey Truscott-Sade is a companion of the Eighth Doctor, appearing in the Doctor Who Magazine comic strip .

Formerly a possessed pawn of the Hornet Queen, she first encountered the Doctor in Cromer in 1932, where she was the curator of the Palace of Curios, a small curiosity shop. Released from the Hornets' influence, she was taken by the Doctor to his house in Sussex, in the early 21st century. She joined him and Mike Yates in their descent into the papier- m√¢ch√© brain of a stuffed zebra where the Hornets had built their primary nest. After they defeated the Queen and put paid to the Hornets' nefarious schemes, she settled into the house and took care of it while the Doctor continued his travels. He returned to check in on her a year later in the sequel, Demon Quest, whereupon she traded one of the vital components of his TARDIS to a mysterious figure. The Doctor insisted that she accompany him on a chase through time to retrieve it. While on the journey, she exhibited odd flashes of insight, such as making a prescient prediction while posing as the goddess \\"Wibbsentia\\" in pre-Roman Britain. This was later shown to be an effect of the Demon and the Hornets, who were trying to lure the Doctor to the dead world Sepulchre, there to turn the Doctor into a dimensional atlas. Mrs Wibbsey was nearly killed in the attempt to rescue the Doctor after she was again infested with the Hornets. She returns in Serpent Crest, where she and the Doctor are kidnapped by robots and taken through a wormhole in time and space. The Doctor eventually returns her to present day Nest Cottage, giving the house to her as he leaves in his TARDIS. =Will Arrowsmith= Played by Christian Edwards, Will begins travelling with the Seventh Doctor and Klein in the Big Finish audio drama Persuasion, as Klein's Assistant at UNIT =William Hoffman= William Hoffman, also known as Isaac, first appears in the short story Euterpe: An Overture Too Early by Simon Guerrier in the Big Finish Short Trips anthology The Muses. He later appears in most of the short stories in Short Trips: Time Signature, edited by Guerrier. Though the Doctor has met him previously in his own timeline, William's association with the Time Lord begins when, as a young man, he encounters the Sixth Doctor and agrees to join him on a fishing trip. This expedition takes them to a future Earth, populated by an advanced hunter-gatherer society. They next visit London in William's near future, and a walking city in the distant future. During their travels William develops a latent talent for music, and becomes fascinated with a tune which acts directly upon the time vortex. He parts company with the Doctor in an Eastern European country in the 1950s. Now using the name \\"Isaac\\" he becomes a prominent composer in his adopted country, his compositions incorporating the music of the vortex. He meets the Doctor on two subsequent occasions, both of them earlier in the Doctor's timeline than their original meeting. His meeting with the Third Doctor in London in the 1970s (their first, from the Doctor's point of view) takes place shortly before Isaac's murder by forces wishing to protect the vortex. After scattering Isaac's ashes, the Eighth Doctor deals with the powers attempting to excise Isaac's compositions from the universe. This process entails changing the young William's timeline so that he never joined the sixth Doctor on his fishing trip, but instead developed his musical talent without the influence of the vortex. The effects of this action upon history are not made clear. =Jenny Wilson= Jenny was one of the Doctor's companions in the stage play Doctor Who and the Daleks in the Seven Keys to Doomsday. She was played by Wendy Padbury, who had previously played Zoe Heriot. Not to be confused with Jenny from the 2008 episode \\"The Doctor's Daughter.\\" In the Big Finish audio adaptation, she was played by Wendy Padbury's daughter Charlie Hayes. =Guinevere Winchester= Guinevere Winchester, known as Guin, appears in the short story \\"Revenants\\" by Peter Anghelides. She was a historian, before becoming a companion of the red-haired future Doctor mentioned in Battlefield, and has an ex-husband named Lance. Given that this Doctor took the identity of Merlin, it is unlikely that her name, and that of her husband, is a coincidence. =Wolsey= Wolsey the Cat, in a humanoid form from Oh No It Isn't! Wolsey (named for Cardinal Wolsey) was a cat given to the Seventh Doctor by Joan in the novel Human Nature by Paul Cornell. Wolsey travelled in the TARDIS until the events of The Dying Days by Lance Parkin. The Eighth Doctor then gave Wolsey to Bernice Summerfield, and the cat remained with her for the remainder of the New Adventures. Wolsey also appeared in some of the Bernice Summerfield audio dramas and books from Big Finish Productions. In the audio drama Oh No It Isn't! by Paul Cornell, Wolsey is voiced by actor Nicholas Courtney, better known for his role as Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart. Z =Zog= Zog, an alien slave, appeared in the stage play Doctor Who - The Ultimate Adventure, written by Terrance Dicks. Zog was a slave who served at the Bar Galactica run by Madame Delilah.

The Holman Christian Standard Bible presents two interpretations, either \\"‚ÄúWhat has this concern of yours to do with Me?\\" or \\"You and I see things differently\\" : HCSB whereas in the Weymouth New Testament, Jesus' words are \\"Leave the matter in my hands\\".John 2:4 in the Weymouth New Testament The Orthodox Jewish Bible highlights a connection with the narrative of the fall in : [God] \\"will put enmity between you (Adam) and the woman, and between your offspring and her offspring\\". Nevertheless, Jesus' mother still tells the servants to do whatever he asks, so he tells them to fill up the empty wine containers with water. Afterwards, the head waiter of the wedding tastes it and remarks to the groom that they have saved the best wine for last. John tells his audience that the water was there for the Jewish rite of purification. According to John, this was his first sign or miracle (in Cana). It occurs immediately after Jesus has told Nathanael in chapter 1:50 that \\"You shall see greater things than that.\\" According to the hypothesis of the Signs Gospel, this miracle was originally in that document. John uses the Greek word semeion meaning sign, or ergon meaning work, instead of the term the synoptics use, dynamis or act of power, for miracle.Brown, page 339 This miracle only occurs in John's Gospel, not in any of the synoptics. The story can be understood as John's fulfillments of prophecies in the Old Testament, such as in Amos 9:13-14 and Genesis 49:10-11 about the abundance of wine that there will be in the time of the messiah (Brown 340). Messianic wedding festivals are mentioned in Isaiah 62:4-5.Brown et al. page 954 One can also perhaps see this in the synoptics in for instance Mark 2:21-22 where Jesus speaks about \\"new wineskins\\". Jesus' mother, not named in the gospel, appears again in John 19:25-27 at Jesus' crucifixion. This begins a series of stories about Jesus' role as the new way that last until his second miracle or sign, the healing of the official's son in John 4. Interlude then says that Jesus went with his mother and brothers and disciples to Capernaum for \\"not many days\\", but does not relate what went on there. Cana is about 25 miles from Capernaum using modern roads.Highway 77 and Highway 90 - source: Google Maps, accessed 6 February 2016 The synoptic gospels make no mention of Jesus attending the wedding before going to Capernaum, nor that his mother or brothers went there with him. Luke 4 and Matthew 4 report Jesus going to Nazareth and then Capernaum after Jesus' baptism and temptation. Mark 1 has him going to Galilee from the wilderness (where he had been tempted by Satan) and visiting several places in Galilee before reaching Capernaum (Mark 1:25, 31, 34). After the authority and power of Jesus had been demonstrated, He and His disciples went throughout Galilee preaching and casting out demons (). Mark later records that they return to Capernaum, after going throughout the neighboring lands. Jesus cleanses the Temple Jesus vertreibt die H√§ndler aus dem Tempel by Giovanni Paolo PanniniChrist drives the Usurers out of the Temple, a woodcut by Lucas Cranach the Elder in Passionary of Christ and Antichrist.The references cited in the Passionary for this woodcut: , , and The Apology of the Augsburg Confession, Article 8, Of the Church The story of Jesus overturning the tables of the money changers in the Temple is related next. Jesus and his disciples go to Jerusalem for the Passover, the first of three visits to Jerusalem recounted in this gospel, the others being John 7, where he goes for the Feast of Tabernacles, and the final Passover during which he is crucified. He enters the Temple courts and sees people selling livestock and exchanging money. He explodes: :So he made a whip out of cords, and drove all from the temple area, both sheep and cattle; he scattered the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables. To those who sold doves he said, \\"Get these out of here! How dare you turn my Father's house into a market! (15-16) \\"It is worth remembering that on the eve of the Passover the head of every family carefully collected all the leaven in the house, and there was a general cleansing. Jesus was doing in His Father‚Äôs house, it may be, what was then being done in every house in Jerusalem\\".Charles Ellicott, Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers on John 2, accessed 8 February 2016 John says that Jesus' disciples remembered the words of Psalm 69:9, \\"zeal for your house will consume me\\", perhaps a bit of wordplay interposing the ideas of \\"'demanding all my attention' and 'leading to my destruction'\\".Miller, page 204 Whether the disciples remembered this during the incident or afterward is not clear: theologian Hermann Olshausen suggested that the recollection took place afterwards, but Heinrich Meyer disagreed: this saying was remembered \\"at the very time of the occurrence\\", in contrast to their recollection about Jesus' foretelling of his resurrection (), which happened afterwards.Meyer's NT Commentary on John 2, accessed 8 February 2016 Jesus is asked for \\"a sign\\" to prove that he has authority to expel the money changers. He replies \\"Destroy this temple, and I will raise it again in three days\\". The people believe he is talking about the official Temple building, but John states that Jesus meant his body, and that this is what his disciples came to believe after his resurrection. John then says that during the Passover Feast Jesus performed miraculous signs, but does not list them, that caused people to believe in him, but that he would \\"not entrust himself to them, for he knew all men\\". Perhaps John included this statement to show Jesus possesses a knowledge of people's hearts and minds, an attribute of God.Brown et al. page 955 This introduces the antagonism between Jesus and \\"the Jews\\", as John calls them, a sign perhaps of a non-Jewish audience. This is over the nature of the Temple. The Temple is already destroyed by the time of the writing of John, and John is trying to show right from the start that the old Temple has been replaced by the new Temple, Jesus' resurrected body and the new Christian and Johannine community. This shows to most scholars the split between John's community and Judaism in general. Some of the Dead Sea scrolls also speak of the community as the temple. John mentions the incident with the money changers as occurring at the start of Jesus' ministry, while the synoptic gospels have it occurring shortly before his crucifixion. Some scholars suggest that this shows that Jesus fought with the money changers twice, once at the beginning and once at the end of his ministry. The incident in the synoptics occurs in Mark 11:12-19, Matthew 21:12-17, and Luke 19:45-48. Perhaps John has relocated the story to the beginning to show that Jesus' arrest was for the raising of Lazarus in John 11, not the incident in the Temple. The discerner of hearts The chapter ends with a brief section which the New King James Version sub-titles \\"The Discerner of Hearts\\" (). Whilst Jesus stayed in Jerusalem for the Passover feast, he performed various unrecorded signs,\\"Of these we have no record: Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary on John 2:23, accessed 9 February 2016; cf.: There are also many other things that Jesus did, which if they were written one by one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that would be written. and many \\"believed in His name\\". Swedish-based commentator Ren√© Kieffer suggested that the evangelist \\"probably includes what [had] happened in Cana\\" among these signs.Kieffer, R., John in Barton, J. and Muddiman, J. (2001), The Oxford Bible Commentary, p. 966 This theme is continued into chapter 3, where the Pharisee Nicodemus acknowledges that \\"no one can do these signs that You do unless God is with him\\" ().

He was a coach for the Dodgers from 1980 through 2013. His 34 consecutive seasons as a Dodgers coach was the longest in team history and the second-longest such streak in MLB history behind Nick Altrock, who spent 42 straight seasons listed as a coach for the old Washington Senators. Mota is currently a minor league hitting instructor and Spanish language television broadcaster for the Dodgers. Playing career =San Francisco Giants= Minor leagues At the age of 19, Mota signed as an amateur free agent with the New York Giants on February 21, 1957. He began his minor league career that season with the Class-D Michigan City White Caps of the Midwest League, where he hit .314 in 126 games. In 1958, he was promoted to the Class-B Danville Leafs of the Carolina League, where he hit .301 in 103 games. Mota began 1959 with the Class A Springfield Giants of the Eastern League and was later promoted to the AAA Phoenix Giants of the Pacific Coast League. In 86 games combined, he hit .304. In 1960, he played in 141 games for the AA Rio Grande Valley Giants of the Texas League, hitting .307. In 1961, with the AAA Tacoma Giants, he hit .289 in 142 games. Major leagues After beginning 1962 with the El Paso Sun Kings, Mota made his Major League debut on April 16, 1962 for the now San Francisco Giants against the Los Angeles Dodgers, and he hit a flyball to centerfield in his first at-bat. His first hit was an RBI single off Jim Brosnan of the Cincinnati Reds on April 21, 1962. He had 13 hits in 74 at-bats for a .176 batting average in 47 games for the Giants. On November 30, 1962, the Giants traded him to the Houston Colt .45's (with Dick LeMay) for infielder Joey Amalfitano. =Pittsburgh Pirates= Mota as a member of the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1965. Before he ever appeared in an official game with Houston, he was dealt to the Pittsburgh Pirates for outfielder Howie Goss and cash on April 4, 1963, and he quickly established himself as one of the league's premiere hitters. In six years with the Pirates, Mota appeared in 642 games and hit .297. His first career home run was hit off Chris Short of the Philadelphia Phillies on May 26, 1964. =Montreal Expos= On October 14, 1968, Mota was the second player selected in the expansion draft by the Montreal Expos. In 31 games, he hit .315. =Los Angeles Dodgers= On June 11, 1969 Mota was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers (along with Maury Wills) for Ron Fairly and Paul Popovich.Dodgers finally bring Wills back home Once in L.A., Mota became the number one pinch hitter there and hit over .300 during the next five seasons. On May 16, 1970, Mota hit the first batted ball in major league history to cause a fatality. In the bottom of the third against the Giants at Dodger Stadium, Mota fouled one off of Gaylord Perry along the first base line. The ball struck 14-year-old Alan Fish in the left temple. Four days later, Fish died of an inoperable head injury. In 1973, Mota was selected to the National League All-Star team after leading the league in batting average. From 1974 through 1979, Mota was continuously called upon for late inning heroics, where he averaged 10 pinch hits for six straight seasons. The Dodgers appeared in the 1974, 1977, and 1978 World Series. In 1979, he established his place in the record books by becoming the all-time leader in pinch hits. He had a compact swing and often half-swung just to push the ball beyond the reach of the first baseman for a hit. In 1981, Manny appeared in his fourth World Series, this time as a coach. Mota retired as a player from the Dodgers after the 1982 season, a year in which he had only one plate appearance. He ended his playing career holding the all-time major league record for career pinch-hits (150), which has since been broken by Mark Sweeney and Lenny Harris, an overall lifetime batting average of .304, and a .297 pinch-hitting average. His .315 batting average is second best (1,800 or more at bats) in Los Angeles Dodgers history, trailing only Mike Piazza. Post-playing career Mota served as a player-coach for the Dodgers during his final seasons on the diamond, then remained a coach after retiring as a player. Mota coached LA in the 1988 World Series, his fifth in Dodger uniform. He retired as a coach in 2013 to become a full-time broadcaster (see below). Mota's fame as a pinch-hitter was immortalized in the 1980 movie Airplane!, when Ted Stryker tries to \\"concentrate!\\" on flying the plane, then hears an echo in his head (\\"concentrate...!\\"), which morphs into a baseball public address announcer intoning, \\"Pinch-hitting for Pedro Borbon...(Borbon)...Manny...(Manny)...Mota...(Mota)...!\\" (This did not actually ever occur in a real big-league game, as Mota and Borbon never played for the same MLB team at the same time; however, they did play together for Tigres del Licey in the Dominican Republic for several winter seasons.) In the off-season, Mota and his wife Margarita reside in the Dominican Republic, where they run the Manny Mota International Foundation. Established over 30 years ago, this humanitarian organization provides needed resources and other assistance to disadvantaged youth and their families in both the Dominican Republic and the United States. Mota was inducted into the Hispanic Heritage Baseball Museum Hall of Fame on August 23, 2003, in a pre-game on-field ceremony at Dodger Stadium. Mota was inducted into the Baseball Reliquary's Shrine of the Eternals in 2013.\\"Shrine of the Eternals ‚Äì Inductees\\". Baseball Reliquary. Retrieved 2019-08-14. Mota worked as a color commentator on the Fox Sports en Espanol television broadcast of the 2007 World Series and worked as a Spanish-language broadcaster for the Dodgers on select PrimeTicket broadcasts; he became a full-time broadcaster on the Spanish-language feeds of SportsNet LA in 2014. Family Two of Mota's sons, Andy and Jos√©, also played in the Major Leagues. Manny's youngest son, Tony, played extensively through the Minor Leagues and has also coached for the Dodgers organization. Manny, and his wife, Margarita, recently celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary. Mota's nephew, Santiago Taveras, is an educator and former deputy chancellor in New York City, and was the principal of DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx until his ouster in a grade-fixing scandal in November 2016.

This gradually emerged out of various political and armed movements throughout most of the Spanish East Indies‚Äîalbeit has long been fragmented and inconsistent with contemporary definitions of such nationalism‚Äîas a consequence of more than three centuries of Spanish rule. These movements are characterized by the upsurge of anti- colonialist sentiments and ideals which peaked in the late 19th century led mostly by the ilustrado or landed, educated elites, whether peninsulares, insulares, or native (Indio). This served as the backbone of the first nationalist revolution in Asia, the Philippine Revolution of 1896. The modern concept would later be fully actualized upon the inception of a Philippine state with its contemporary borders after being granted independence by the United States by the 1946 Treaty of Manila. Background In the years before the 11th century, the Philippines was divided into numerous principalities known as barangays, a name derived from Malayan boats called balangays. These small political units were ruled by datus, rajahs or sultans.Philippine History by Maria Christine N. Halili. \\"Chapter 3: Precolonial Philippines\\" (Published by Rex Bookstore; Manila, Sampaloc St. Year 2004) In 1565, European colonization began in earnest when Spanish explorer Miguel L√≥pez de Legazpi arrived from Mexico and formed the first European settlements in Cebu. Beginning with just five ships and five hundred men accompanied by Augustinian monks, and further strengthened in 1567 by two hundred soldiers, he was able to repel competing Portuguese colonizers and to create the foundations for the Spanish colonization of the Archipelago. In 1571, the Spanish occupied the kingdoms of Maynila and Tondo and established Manila as the capital of the Spanish East Indies. This Spanish colonization united the Philippine archipelago into a single political entity. The start of Filipino nationalism (1760s‚Äì1820s) The term \\"Filipino\\" originally referred to the Spanish criollos of the Philippines. During their 333-year rule of the Philippines, the Spanish rulers referred the natives as indios. Also during the colonial era, the Spaniards born in the Philippines, who were more known as insulares, criollos, or Creoles, were also called \\"Filipinos.\\" Spanish-born Spaniards or mainland Spaniards residing in the Philippines were referred to as Peninsulares. Those of mixed ancestry were referred to as Mestizos. The Creoles, despite being regarded by the Peninsulares as inferior to them, had enjoyed various government and church positions, and composed the majority of the government bureaucracy.Renato Constantino, The Philippines: A Past Revisited The sense of national consciousness came from the Creoles, who now regard themselves as \\"Filipino\\". It was brought to its advent by three major factors: 1) economy, 2) education and 3) secularization of parishes. These factors contributed to the birth of the Filipino Nationalism. The opening of the Philippines to the international or world trade, the rise of the middle class, and the influx of Liberal ideas from Europe were only a few examples of how the Philippines developed into a stable country. \\"The first manifestation of Philippine nationalism followed in the decades of the 1880s and the 1890s, with a reform or propaganda movement, conducted both in Spain and in the Philippines, for the purpose of ‚Äúpropagandizing‚Äù Philippine conditions in the hopes that desired changes in the social, political and economic life of the Filipinos would come about through peaceful means.\\" Effect of the progress during the period (2000s‚Äì2001) The earliest signs of the effect to Filipino Nationalism by the developments mentioned could be seen in the writings of Luis Rodr√≠guez Varela, a Creole educated in liberal France and highly exposed to the Age of Enlightenment. Knighted under the Order of Carlos III, Varela was perhaps the only Philippine Creole who was actually part of European nobility. The court gazette in Madrid announced that he was to become a Conde and from that point on proudly called himself El Conde Filipino. He championed the rights of Filipinos in the islands and slowly made the term applicable to anyone born in the Philippines. =Economy= The Manila-Acapulco trade route started in 1568 and Spanish treasure fleets (white) and its eastwards rivals, the Portuguese India Armadas routes of 1498-1640 (blue) The decline of Galleon trade between Manila and Acapulco was caused by the arrival of the ship Buen Consejo in 1765. The Buen Consejo took the shorter route via Cape of Good Hope, a rocky headland on the Atlantic coast controlled by Portugal. The journey through the Cape of Good Hope takes three months from Spain to the Philippines, whereas the journey of the galleon trade takes five months. The event proved that Portugal was already past its prime in controlling the route via the Cape of Good Hope, which was already under Dutch control as early as 1652. Shorter journeys to and from Spain brought faster trade and quicker spread of ideas from Europe. Also, the growing sense of economic insecurity in the later years of the 18th century led the Creoles to turn their attention to agricultural production. The Creoles gradually changed from a very government- dependent class into capital-driven entrepreneurs. Their turning of attention towards guilded soil caused the rise of the large private haciendas. Various government and church positions were transferred to the roles of the Peninsulares who were characterized mostly in the 19th century Philippine history as corrupt bureaucrats. Jose Basco, the 44th governor-general of the Philippines under Spanish colonial rule During the 1780s, two institutions were established in order to enhance the economic capacity of the Philippines. These were the Economic Societies of Friends of the Country and the Royal Company of the Philippines. The former, introduced by Governor-General Jose Basco in 1780, was composed of leading men in business, industry and profession, the society was tasked to explore and exploit the natural resources of the archipelago. It offered local and foreign scholarships, besides training grants in agriculture and established an academy of design. It was also credited to the carabao ban of 1782, the formation of the silversmiths and gold beaters guild and the construction of the first papermill in the Philippines in 1825. The latter, created by Carlos III on , was granted exclusive monopoly of bringing to Manila; Chinese and Indian goods and shipping them directly to Spain via the Cape of Good Hope. It was stiffly objected by the Dutch and English who saw it as a direct attack on their trade of Asian goods. It was also vehemently opposed by the traders of the Galleon trade who saw it as competition., \\"The charter of the Royal Philippine Company was promulgated on to last for 25 years.\\" =Education= During the administration of Governor-General Jose Raon, a royal order from Spain, which stated that every village or barrio must have a school and a teacher, was implemented. The implementation of the order expanded the reach of basic education during the Spanish era. Also, during the 18th century, modern agricultural tools made many people leave farming for pursuing academic and intellectual courses. After the arrival of Buen Consejo, the Philippines had more direct contact to Europe and the ideas circulating. Thus, the Philippines was influenced by the principles during the Age of Enlightenment and radical changes during the French Revolution. =Secularization of parishes= Portrait of Charles III of Spain, 1761 By royal decree on February 27, 1767, King Carlos III ordered the Jesuits to be expelled from Spain, and from all her colonies. The decree reached the Philippines in early 1768, wherein Governor-General Raon tried to do the Jesuits a favor by delaying the implementation of the royal order in exchange of bribes. This gave the Jesuit priests to hide all of their possessions and destroy documents that could be held against them, which were supposed to be confiscated. The first batch of Jesuits, numbered 64, left Manila only by May 17, 1768. This event caused Raon to face prosecution from the next Governor-General, as ordered by the King of Spain. Raon died before the judgment for him was laid. The expulsion of Jesuit priests from the country resulted to a shortage of priests in the parishes. This prompted the current Manila archbishop, Basilio Sancho de Santa Justa, to launch his favorite project: secularization of Philippine parishes. Sancho reasoned out that priests were only sent to facilitate missions to areas that are not yet much Christianized. Native priests must be ordained to facilitate the parishes since the Philippines was already a Christian country. Sancho recruited every Indio he got to become priests. There was even a joke at the time that there were no one to man the galleons anymore, since Sancho had made them all priests. The secularization partly failed because many members of the newly formed native clergy soiled the parishes with their ignorance, sloth, and the like. One achievement of Sancho's secularization project was the establishment of a school for native boys who aspire to become priests. Further progress of Filipino Nationalism (1820s‚Äì1860) At this stage, the Creoles slowly introduced their own reforms. Parishes began to have native priests at the time of Archbishop Sancho. The Philippines was given representation in the Spanish Cortes three times (last time was from 1836-1837). However, on June 1, 1823, a Creole revolt broke out in Manila led by the Mexican-blood Creole captain Andres Novales. The revolt, caused by an order from Spain that declared military officers commissioned in the Peninsula (Spain) should outrank all those appointed in the Colonies, saw Manila cheering with Novales's cry of \\"Viva la Independencia\\" (). The revolt prompted the government to deport Varela together with other Creoles [allegedly known as Los Hijos del Pa√≠s ()], after being associated with the Creole reformists. The Novales Revolt would soon be followed by another Creole plot of secession known as the Palmero Conspiracy, which was caused by the replacement of Creole public officials, especially provincial governors, with Peninsulars. Painting of a Spanish galleon during Manila-Acapulco Trade Economic developments also did a part in making up the shape of Filipino Nationalism. Before the opening of Manila to foreign trade, the Spanish authorities discouraged foreign merchants from residing in the colony and engaging in business.. * In 1823, Governor-General Mariano Ricafort promulgated an edict prohibiting foreign merchants from engaging in retail trade and visiting the provinces for purposes of trade. However, by the royal decree of September 6, 1834, the privileges of the Company were abolished and the port of Manila was opened to trade. Shortly after opening Manila to world trade, the Spanish merchants began to lose their commercial supremacy in the Philippines. In 1834, restrictions against foreign traders were relaxed when Manila became an open port. By the end of 1859, there were 15 foreign firms in Manila: seven of which were British, three American, two French, two Swiss and one German. In response to Sinibaldo de Mas' recommendations, more ports were opened by Spain to world trade. The ports of Sual, Pangasinan, Iloilo and Zamboanga were opened in 1855. Cebu was opened in 1860, Legazpi and Tacloban in 1873. Like Japan that rushed into modernization and national transformation during the Meiji Restoration, the Philippines and its people saw that the Spanish and its government is not as invincible as it was two centuries before. The Indios and the Creoles became more influenced by foreign ideas of liberalism as the Philippines became more open to foreigners. Foreigners who visited the Philippines had noticed the speed of the circulation of the ideas of Voltaire and Thomas Paine. Songs about liberty and equality were also being sung at the time. Some Spanish who foresaw a \\"fast verging\\" Indio takeover of the archipelago began to send money out of the Philippines. First Propaganda Movement (1860‚Äì1872) Padre Jos√© Apolonio Burgos Varela would then retire from politics but his nationalism was carried on by another Creole, one Pedro Pel√°ez, who campaigned for the rights of Filipino priests (Creoles, Mestizos and Indios) and pressed for secularization of Philippine parishes. He reasoned out the same point Sancho had, friars are for missions on areas that are still pagan. The Latin American revolutions and decline of friar influence in Spain resulted in the increase of the regular clergy (Peninsular friars) in the Philippines. Filipino priests (Creoles, Mestizos and Indios) were being replaced by Spanish friars (Peninsulares) and Pel√°ez demanded explanation as to the legality of replacing a secular with regulars‚Äîwhich is in contradiction to the Exponi nobis. Pel√°ez brought the case to the Vatican and almost succeeded if not for an earthquake that cut his career short. The earthquake struck on June 3, 1863, during the feast of Corpus Christi. The ideology would be carried by his more militant disciple, Jos√© Burgos. Demonstrations became a norm in Manila during the 1860s. One of the first of a series of demonstrations was during the transfer of the remains of former Governor- General Sim√≥n de Anda y Salazar from the Manila Cathedral after the 1863 earthquake. Anda was a hero for the natives because he fought friar power during his term, and he established a separate government in Bacolor during the British occupation of Manila. On the day of the transfer, a young Indio priest approached the coffin and laid a laurel wreath dedicated by \\"The Secular Clergy of the Philippines\\" to Don Sim√≥n de Anda. Then, a young Indio student went to the coffin and offered a crown of flowers. Lastly, a number of gobernadorcillos went to do their own salutations for Don Sim√≥n de Anda. Since none of those acts were in the program, the Spanish saw that it was a secretly planned demonstration. Though no one told who the mastermind was, there were rumors that it was Padre Burgos. The demonstrations got more frequent and more influential during the liberal regime of Governor-General Carlos Mar√≠a de la Torre (1869-1871). Only two weeks after the arrival of de la Torre as Governor-General, Burgos and Joaquin Pardo de Tavera led a demonstration at the Plaza de Santa Potenciana. Among the demonstrators were Jose Icaza, Jaime Baldovino Gorospe, Jacobo Zobel, Ignacio Rocha, Manuel Genato and Maximo Paterno. The demo cry was \\"Viva Filipinas para los Filipinos!\\". In November 1870, a student movement, denounced as a riot or motin, at the University of Santo Tomas formed a committee to demand reforms on the school and its curricula. It later announced support of Philippine autonomy and recognition of the Philippines as a province of Spain. The committee was headed by Felipe Buencamino. Carlos Mar√≠a de la Torre y Nava Cerrada, the 91st Governor-General of the Philippines During this period, a secret society of reformists met in a cistern under a well at the house of Father Mariano G√≥mez. The society, headed by Jose Maria Basa, worked mainly on a Madrid journal called the Eco de Filipinas (not to be confused with the El Eco de Filipinas that was published much later, in September 1890). The journal exposed problems in the Philippines and pressed on reforms that they seek for the country. Among the members were Burgos, Maximo Paterno, Ambrosio Rianzares Bautista, and Father Agustin Mendoza. It served as a precursor to La Solidaridad. However, Burgos died after the infamous Cavite Mutiny, which was pinned on Burgos as his attempt to start a Creole Revolution and make himself president of the Philippines or Rey Indio. The death of Jos√© Burgos, and the other alleged conspirators, Mariano G√≥mez and Jacinto Zamora on , seemingly ended the entire Creole movement. Governor-General Rafael de Izquierdo y Guti√©rrez unleashed his reign of terror in order to prevent the spread of the Creole ideology‚ÄîFilipino nationalism. Another event in history created an impact on Filipino nationalism during this period. Before 1869, the route through the Cape of Good Hope proved to be a shortest available journey to Europe by Indios and Creoles alike. The journey takes 3 months travel by sea. On , the Suez Canal opened after 10 years of construction work. At its advent, the journey from the Philippines to Spain was further reduced to one month. This allowed a much faster spread of European ideology and an increase of Filipino presence in Europe itself. The Propaganda Movement would later benefit from the Suez Canal for the shorter route it provided. Second Propaganda Movement (1872‚Äì1892) Filipino expatriates in Europe formed the Propaganda Movement. Photographed in Madrid, Spain in 1890. The events of 1872 however invited the other colored section of the Ilustrados (intellectually enlightened class), the growing middle-class natives, to at least do something to preserve the Creole ideals. Seeing the impossibility of a revolution against Izquierdo and the Governor-General's brutal reign convinced the Ilustrados to get out of the Philippines and continue propaganda in Europe. This massive propaganda upheaval from 1872 to 1892 is now known as the Second Propaganda Movement. Through their writings and orations, Marcelo H. del Pilar, Graciano L√≥pez Jaena and Jos√© Rizal sounded the trumpets of Filipino nationalism and brought it to the level of the masses. The propagandists mainly aimed for representation of the Philippines in the Cortes Generales, secularization of the clergy, legalization of Spanish and Filipino equality, among others. Their main work was the newspaper called La Solidaridad (Solidarity), which was first published at Barcelona on December 13, 1888. Rizal, the foremost figure of the propagandists, created the Noli Me T√°ngere (published 1887) and El filibusterismo (published 1891). It rode the increasing anti-Spanish (anti- Peninsulares) sentiments in the islands and pushed the people towards revolution, rather than discourage them that a revolution was not the solution for independence. Post-propaganda era By July 1892, Rizal returned to the Philippines and established a progressive organization he called the La Liga Filipina (The Philippine League). However, the organization collapsed after Rizal's arrest and deportation to Dapitan on July 7. At the same day, a Philippine revolutionary society was founded by Ilustrados led by Andr√©s Bonifacio, Deodato Arellano, Ladislao Diwa, Teodoro Plata and Valent√≠n D√≠az. The main aim of the organization, named Katipunan, was to win Philippine independence through a revolution and establish a republic thereafter. The rise of the Katipunan signaled the end of peaceful propaganda for reforms. =Philippine Revolution= Original flag of the Philippines, as conceived by Emilio Aguinaldo. The Katipunan reached an overwhelming membership and attracted almost the lowly of the Filipino class. In June 1896, Bonifacio sent an emissary to Dapitan to reach Rizal's support, but the latter refused for an armed revolution. On , Katipunan was discovered by a Spanish friar which started the Philippine Revolution. The revolution flared up initially into the eight provinces of Central Luzon. General Emilio Aguinaldo, a member of the Katipunan, spread an armed resistance through Southern Tagalog region where he liberated Cavite towns little by little. Leadership conflicts between Bonifacio and Aguinaldo culminated in the Imus Assembly in December 1896 and Tejeros Convention in March 1897. Aguinaldo was elected in absentia as President of an insurgent revolutionary government by the Tejeros convention. Bonifacio, acting as Supremo of the Katipunan, declared the convention proceedings void and attempted to reassert leadership of the revolution. In late April Aguinaldo fully assumed presidential office after consolidating his position with revolutionary leaders. Aguinaldo's government then ordered the arrest of Bonifacio, who stood trial on charges of sedition and treason against Aguinaldo's government and conspiracy to murder Aguinaldo, resulting in his conviction and execution In December 1897, Aguinaldo agreed to the Pact of Biak-na-Bato with the Spanish colonial government. Aguinaldo and his revolutionary leadership were exiled to Hong Kong. However, not all of the revolutionary generals complied with the agreement. One, General Francisco Makabulos, established a Central Executive Committee to serve as the interim government until a more suitable one was created. =Independence declaration and the Philippine-American War= Revolutionaries gather during the Malolos congress of the First Philippine Republic. In 1898, as conflicts continued in the Philippines, the , having been sent to Cuba because of U.S. concerns for the safety of its citizens during an ongoing Cuban revolution, exploded and sank in Havana harbor. This event precipitated the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. After Commodore George Dewey defeated the Spanish squadron at Manila, a German squadron, led by Vice Admiral Otto von Diederichs, arrived in Manila and engaged in maneuvers which Dewey, seeing this as obstruction of his blockade, offered war‚Äîafter which the Germans backed down. The U.S. invited Aguinaldo to return to the Philippines in the hope he would rally Filipinos against the Spanish colonial government. Aguinaldo arrived on May 19, 1898, via transport provided by Dewey. By the time U.S. land forces had arrived, the Filipinos had taken control of the entire island of Luzon, except for the walled city of Intramuros. On June 12, 1898, Aguinaldo declared the independence of the Philippines in Kawit, Cavite, establishing the First Philippine Republic under Asia's first democratic constitution, the Malolos Constitution, an insurgency against Spanish rule. Spain and the United States sent commissioners to Paris to draw up the terms of the Treaty of Paris which ended the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. In the treaty, Spain ceded the Philippines, along with Guam and Puerto Rico, to the United States. Cession of the Philippines involved payment by the U.S. of US$20,000,000.00. U.S. President McKinley described the acquisition of the Philippines as \\"... a gift from the gods\\", saying that since \\"they were unfit for self-government, ... there was nothing left for us to do but to take them all, and to educate the Filipinos, and uplift and civilize and Christianize them\\", in spite of the Philippines having been already Christianized by the Spanish over the course of several centuries. Filipino forces under Aguinaldo as President of the insurgent Philippine Republic resisted the U.S. occupation, resulting in the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War (1899-1913). The poorly-equipped Filipino troops were easily overpowered by American troops in open combat, but they were formidable opponents in guerrilla warfare. Malolos, the revolutionary capital, was captured on . Aguinaldo and his government escaped however, establishing a new capital at San Isidro, Nueva Ecija. On , Antonio Luna, Aguinaldo's most capable military commander, was killed by Aguinaldo's guards in an apparent assassination while visiting Cabanatuan, Nueva Ecija to meet with Aguinaldo.; Aguinaldo dissolved the regular army on and ordered the establishment of decentralized guerrilla commands in each of several military zones. Another key general, Gregorio del Pilar, was killed on in the Battle of Tirad Pass‚Äîa rear guard action to delay the Americans while Aguinaldo made good his escape through the mountains. Aguinaldo was captured at Palanan, Isabela on March 23, 1901 and was brought to Manila. Convinced of the futility of further resistance, he swore allegiance to the United States and issued a proclamation calling on his compatriots to lay down their arms, officially bringing an end to the war. However, sporadic insurgent resistance to American rule continued in various parts of the Philippines, notably insurgencies such as the Irreconcilables and the Moro Rebellion, until 1913. The Insular Government and the Commonwealth era (1901‚Äì1941) =Insular Government= William Howard Taft addressing the audience at the First Philippine Assembly in the Manila Grand Opera House The 1902 Philippine Organic Act was a constitution for the Insular Government, as the U.S. civil administration was known. This was a form of territorial government that reported to the Bureau of Insular Affairs. The act provided for a governor general appointed by the U.S. president and an elected lower house. It also disestablished the Catholic Church as the state religion. Two years after completion and publication of a census, a general election was conducted for the choice of delegates to a popular assembly. An elected Philippine Assembly was convened in 1907 as the lower house of a bicameral legislature, with the Philippine Commission as the upper house. Every year from 1907 the Philippine Assembly and later the Philippine Legislature passed resolutions expressing the Filipino desire for independence. Philippine nationalists led by Manuel Quez√≥n and Sergio Osme√±a enthusiastically endorsed the draft Jones Bill of 1912, which provided for Philippine independence after eight years, but later changed their views, opting for a bill which focused less on time than on the conditions of independence. The nationalists demanded complete and absolute independence to be guaranteed by the United States, since they feared that too-rapid independence from American rule without such guarantees might cause the Philippines to fall into Japanese hands. The Jones bill was rewritten and passed Congress in 1916 with a later date of independence.Wong Kwok Chu, \\"The Jones Bills 1912-16: A Reappraisal of Filipino Views on Independence\\", Journal of Southeast Asian Studies 1982 13(2): 252-269 The law, officially the Philippine Autonomy Act but popularly known as the Jones Law, served as the new organic act (or constitution) for the Philippines. Its preamble stated that the eventual independence of the Philippines would be American policy, subject to the establishment of a stable government. The law maintained the Governor General of the Philippines, appointed by the President of the United States, but established a bicameral Philippine Legislature to replace the elected Philippine Assembly (lower house); it replaced the appointive Philippine Commission (upper house) with an elected senate. The Filipinos suspended their independence campaign during the First World War and supported the United States against Germany. After the war they resumed their independence efforts. The Philippine legislature funded an independence mission to the U.S. in 1919. The mission departed Manila on and met in the U.S. with and presented their case to Secretary of War Newton D. Baker. U.S. President Woodrow Wilson, in his 1921 farewell message to Congress, certified that the Filipino people had performed the condition imposed on them as a prerequisite to independence, declaring that, this having been done, the duty of the U.S. is to grant Philippine independence. (Note: 1. The book cover incorrectly lists author as \\"Maximo M Lalaw\\", 2. Originally published in 1921 by The McCullough Printing Co., Manila) After the first independence mission, public funding of such missions was ruled illegal. Subsequent independence missions in 1922, 1923, 1930, 1931 1932, and two missions in 1933 were funded by voluntary contributions. Numerous independence bills were submitted to the U.S. Congress, which passed the Hare‚ÄìHawes‚ÄìCutting Bill on December 30, 1932. U.S. President Herbert Hoover vetoed the bill on January 13, 1933. Congress overrode the veto on January 17, and the Hare‚ÄìHawes‚ÄìCutting Act became U.S. law. The law promised Philippine independence after 10 years, but reserved several military and naval bases for the United States, as well as imposing tariffs and quotas on Philippine exports. The law also required the Philippine Senate to ratify the law. Quezon urged the Philippine Senate to reject the bill, which it did. Quezon himself led the twelfth independence mission to Washington to secure a better independence act. The result was the Tydings‚ÄìMcDuffie Act of 1934 which was very similar to the Hare‚ÄìHawes‚ÄìCutting Act except in minor details. The Tydings‚ÄìMcDuffie Act was ratified by the Philippine Senate. The law provided for the granting of Philippine independence by 1946. =Commonwealth era= March 23, 1935: Constitutional Convention. Seated, left to right: George H. Dern, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Manuel L. Quezon The Tydings- McDuffie Act provided for the drafting and guidelines of a Constitution, for a 10-year \\"transitional period\\" as the Commonwealth of the Philippines before the granting of Philippine independence. On May 5, 1934, the Philippines legislature passed an act setting the election of convention delegates. Governor General Frank Murphy designated July 10 as the election date, and the convention held its inaugural session on . The completed draft constitution was approved by the convention on February 8, 1935, approved by U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt on March 23, and ratified by popular vote on May 14. On , presidential elections were held. Candidates included former president Emilio Aguinaldo, the Iglesia Filipina Independiente leader Gregorio Aglipay, and others. Manuel L. Quezon and Sergio Osme√±a of the Nacionalista Party were proclaimed the winners, winning the seats of president and vice-president, respectively. The Commonwealth Government was inaugurated on the morning of , in ceremonies held on the steps of the Legislative Building in Manila. The event was attended by a crowd of around 300,000 people. Japanese occupation and the Second Republic (1941‚Äì1945) Japan launched a surprise attack on the Clark Air Base in Pampanga on , just ten hours after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Aerial bombardment, which destroyed most of the American aircraft in the islands, was followed by landings of ground troops on Luzon. The defending Philippine and United States troops were under the command of General Douglas MacArthur. Under the pressure of superior numbers, the defending forces withdrew to the Bataan Peninsula and to the island of Corregidor at the entrance to Manila Bay. On , General MacArthur declared the capital city, Manila, an open city to prevent its destruction. The Philippine defense continued until the final surrender of United States-Philippine forces on the Bataan Peninsula in April 1942 and on Corregidor in May of the same year. Jos√© Paciano Laurel was the only president of the Second Philippine Republic. The Philippine Executive Commission was established in 1942 with Jorge B. Vargas as its first Chairman. The PEC was created as the temporary care-taker government of the Greater Manila area and eventually of the whole Philippines during the Japanese occupation of the country during World War II. On May 6, 1943, Japanese Premier Hideki Tojo during a visit to the Philippines pledged to establish the Republic of the Philippines. This pledge of Tojo prompted the \\"KALIBAPI,\\" to call for a convention on and twenty of its members were elected to form the Preparatory Commission for Independence. The commission tasked to draft a constitution for the Philippine Republic and elected head was Jos√© P. Laurel. The Preparatory Commission presented its draft Constitution on September 4, 1943 and three days later, the \\"KALIBAPI\\" general assembly ratified the draft Constitution. The Japanese-sponsored establishment of the Republic of the Philippines was proclaimed on October 14, 1943 with Jos√© P. Laurel being sworn-in as President. On the same day, a \\"Pact of Alliance\\" was signed between the new Philippine Republic and the Japanese government that was ratified two days later by the National Assembly. The Philippine Republic was immediately recognized by Japan, and in the succeeding days by Germany, Thailand, Manchukuo, Burma, Croatia and Italy while neutral Spain sent its \\"greetings.\\" In October 1944, General Douglas MacArthur, the overall commander of American forces in the Pacific, had gathered enough additional troops and supplies to begin the retaking of the Philippines, landing with Sergio Osme√±a who had assumed the Presidency after Quezon's death. The battles entailed long fierce fighting; some of the Japanese continued to fight until the official surrender of the Empire of Japan on September 2, 1945. The Second Republic was dissolved earlier, on August 14. After their landing, Filipino and American forces also undertook measures to suppress the Huk movement, which was founded to fight the Japanese Occupation. Third Republic (1946‚Äì1972) Proclamation of independence ‚Äì General Douglas MacArthur to Carlos Romulo at the recognition of the independence of the Philippines. On , representatives of the United States of America and of the Republic of the Philippines signed a Treaty of General Relations between the two governments. The treaty provided for the recognition of the independence of the Republic of the Philippines as of , and the relinquishment of American sovereignty over the Philippine Islands. From 1946 to 1961, the Philippines observed Independence Day on . However, on May 12, 1962, President Diosdado Macapagal issued Presidential Proclamation No. 28 proclaiming June 12, 1962 as a special public holiday throughout the Philippines. In 1964, Republic Act No. 4166 changed the date of Independence Day from to and renamed the holiday as Philippine Republic Day. ‚Äì President Manuel Roxas addressing the crowd after the flag-raising ceremony on July 4, 1946 Despite eventual success of Filipinos to claim political and social independence, a new type of colonialism rose in the country. It is known as neocolonialism. Neocolonialism is defined as the practice of using economic, linguistic, and cultural forces to control a country (usually former European colonies in Africa or Asia) in lieu of direct military or political control. Since most of the country was ravaged by the Second World War, the Philippines depended mainly on the United States to restore her industries and businesses. The country only began to build local industries to reduce economic dependence on foreign nations during the term of President Ferdinand Marcos. Nationalism in the real sense remained stuck up in a false Filipinistic posture. Examples of governmental efforts to enforce nationalistic policies began with former President Ramon Magsaysay sworn into office wearing the Barong Tagalog, a first by any Philippine president. It was fervently followed by the nationalist program \\"Filipino First Policy\\" of Carlos P. Garcia. =Radical nationalism= After World War II, the Hukbalahap () guerillas continued the revolutionary struggle to establish a Communist government in the Philippines. Nationalism in the real sense remained stuck up in a false Filipinistic posture. The radical wing of the nationalists, led by peasant leader Luis Taruc, renamed themselves as the Hukbong Magpalaya ng Bayan (English: Army to Liberate the People). At its heyday, the Huk movement commanded an estimated 170,000 armed troops with a base of at least two million civilian supporters. Ramon Magsaysay, which was then the Secretary of National Defense during the Quirino administration, was instrumental in halting the Communist movement. In 1964, Jose Maria Sison co-founded the Kabataang Makabayan (Patriotic Youth) with Nilo S. Tayag. This organization rallied the Filipino youth against the Vietnam War, against the Marcos presidency, and corrupt politicians. On December 26, 1968, he formed and chaired the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP), an organization within the Communist Party founded on Marxist‚ÄìLeninist-Mao Zedong Thought, stemming from his own experiences as a youth leader and a labor and land reform activist. This is known as the \\"First Great Rectification\\" movement where Sison and other radical youths criticized the existing Party's leadership and failure. The reformed CPP included Maoism within the political line as well as the struggle for a National Democratic Revolution in two-stages, consisting of a protracted people's war as its first part to be followed by a socialist revolution. Radical nationalism in the Philippines emphasized the Philippine Revolution under Bonifacio as unfinished and henceforth continued, under working class leadership. Writers such as Teodoro Agoncillo and Renato Constantino advocated patriotism by means of revisiting Filipino history in a Filipino perspective. Martial law and the Fourth Republic (1972‚Äì1986) Martial law under Ferdinand Marcos was a period marked by massive government corruption, cronyism, economic recession, and gross violations of human rights. On September 22, 1972, then-Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile was reportedly ambushed by communists in San Juan, killing his driver but leaving him unscathed. The Enrile ambush was widely believed to have been faked. The assassination attempt, the growing threat of the New People's Army, and citizen unrest, were used by Marcos as justification to declare Proclamation No. 1081, which he signed on September 17 (postdated to September 21), the same day. Marcos, who henceforth ruled by decree, curtailed press freedom and other civil liberties, abolished Congress, shut down media establishments, and ordered the arrest of opposition leaders and militant activists. The first years of martial law saw an increase in military hardware and personnel in the Philippines. Agricultural production, especially in rice production (which increased 42% in 8 years), was increased to decrease dependence on food importation. Philippine culture and arts were promoted with the establishment of institutions such as the National Arts Center. However, to help finance a number of economic development projects, the Marcos government borrowed large amounts of money from international lenders.See Thus, proving that the country was not yet fully independent economically. The Philippines' external debt rose from $360 million (US) in 1962 to $28.3 billion in 1986, making the Philippines one of the most indebted countries in Asia. The Fifth Republic (1986‚Äìpresent) From February 22‚Äì25, 1986, many demonstrations against Marcos took place on a long stretch of Epifanio de los Santos Avenue. The event, known as the People Power Revolution, involved many famous figures such as Archbishop Jaime Sin, Lt. Gen. Fidel Ramos and Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile. Finally, on February 25, the Marcos family was transported by U.S. Air Force HH-3E rescue helicopters to Clark Air Base to Angeles City, Pampanga, about 83 kilometers north of Manila, before boarding US Air Force DC-9 Medivac and C-141B planes bound for Andersen Air Force Base in Guam, and finally to Hickam Air Force Base in Hawaii where Marcos arrived on . Many people around the world rejoiced and congratulated Filipinos they knew. Corazon Aquino succeeded as president of the Philippines. In 1986, Aquino adopted Original Pilipino Music (OPM, defined as \\"any musical composition created by a Filipino, whether the lyrics be in Pilipino, English or in any other language or dialect\\") by requiring hourly broadcasts of OPM songs on all radio programs having musical formats in order to conserve, promote and popularize the nation's historical and cultural heritage and resources, as well as artistic creations, and to give patronage to arts and letters. Singers like Regine Velasquez, Randy Santiago, Ogie Alcasid, Gary Valenciano, Manilyn Reynes, Donna Cruz and others are contributed to the President's implementation of Filipino music over the airwaves. Stations like DZOO-FM, DWLS, etc., are adopted hourly OPMs effectively after the implementation. Aquino also encouraged the tourism sector to boost the national economy. Under her six-year term, the Department of Tourism launched a program called The Philippines: Fiesta Islands of Asia in 1989, offers tourist visits in the country to show their natural wonders, to protect their indigenous peoples, to preserve heritage sites and to contribute historical importance. In 1987, then President Corazon C. Aquino penned Executive Order No. 118 creating the Presidential Commission on Culture and Arts. Five years later, in 1992, this presidential directive was enacted into law‚ÄîRepublic Act 7356, creating the National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA). On June 12, 1998, the nation celebrated its centennial year of independence from Spain. The celebrations were held simultaneously nationwide by then President Fidel V. Ramos and Filipino communities worldwide. A commission was established for the said event, the National Centennial Commission headed by former Vice President Salvador Laurel presided all events around the country. One of the major projects of the commission was the Expo Pilipino, a grand showcase of the Philippines' growth as a nation for the last 100 years, in the Clark Special Economic Zone (formerly Clark Air Base) in Angeles City, Pampanga. During his term, President Joseph Estrada ordered to the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) to adopt a Filipino language-based radio format known as masa‚Äînamed for his icon term Masa (or Masses). All radio stations adopted the masa format in 1998. Many stations continued to use the masa format after President Estrada left the presidency in 2001 because the masa format resonated with listeners. Some in the radio industry decry the effects masa formatting has had. (requoted with permission) On August 14, 2010, President Benigno Aquino III directed the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) and the NTC to fully implement Executive Order No. 255, issued on July 25, 1987 by former Philippines President Corazon Aquino, requiring all radio stations to broadcast a minimum of four original Filipino musical compositions in every clock hour of programs with a musical format. On April 13, 2012, The Manila Times, the oldest English language newspaper in the Philippines, published an editorial titled \\"Unpatriotic editing and reporting,\\" taking the Filipino journalistic community to task for their reporting of what it described as \\"confrontation between our Philippine Navy and 'law enforcement' ships of the People's Republic of China\\" in the Spratly Islands. The editorial opined that Philippine reports should state that disputed territories are Philippine territory, and characterized those who refer to disputed territories as \\"being claimed by the Philippines\\" as \\"unpatriotic writers and editors\\". On February 14, 2013, National Book Store, the Philippines' largest bookstore chain, has withdrawn Chinese-made globes, which reflect China's nine-dotted line encompassing the South China Sea, from its shelves. Department of Foreign Affairs spokesman Raul Hernandez said in a statement that, \\"[National Bookstore] has taken a patriotic position to proactively support the Philippine government in advancing Philippine foreign policy objectives.\\" He said the decision to pull out the globes came after a dialogue with the bookstore management, which claimed they were unaware of the ‚Äúmisinformation‚Äù contained in the educational materials.

She also acts as the moral center of an otherwise amoral and chaotic household, as well as a running gag where Franny is a frequent object of lust to perverted men like Blazer who repeatedly attempts (and fails) to hit on her. *Spalding ‚Äì One of the more stable members of the group, he is Reilly's personal caregiver. He is a homosexual with a well-built physique and is originally from Australia. Although good-intentioned, he is a drama queen who craves attention and allows his overt sexuality to get the best of him at times. *Blazer ‚Äì Having lost his entire body as a result of gambling debts, he has been reduced to a head on a skateboard, which he uses as a means of mobility. He is a crude, ill-mannered, and cantankerous pervert who will go to any length to proposition women for even the most obscene sexual favors (such as asking Deborah if he can watch her go to the bathroom). Blazer is also the most nihilistic and amoral of the group, thus making him extremely manipulative and deceptive. As such, he is not above habitually lying to and exploiting his friends (or anyone, for that matter) for his own personal gain (financial, sexual, or otherwise). *Lefty ‚Äì Formerly a professional masseur, he lost his hands after having mistaken a rabid dog's behind for his client's back and were bitten off (an event he still has nightmares about, as shown in one episode). He is an educated and cultured individual that typically finds himself at odds with his housemates, who contrast him personality-wise. *Fontaine ‚Äì A blind Black man with a gentle and caring demeanour. Due to his blindness and trusting nature, he is frequently taken advantage of by the others (especially Reilly and Blazer) in their many escapades. In one episode, it is revealed he has an illegitimate son who is also blind. *Griz ‚Äì The epitome of unrefined, Griz is a large, disheveled oaf of a man who speaks with an Irish accent and rivals Blazer in his crassness. According to him in one episode, he changes his shirt only once every leap year. He runs a seedy, dilapidated dive bar, infested with rats and cockroaches, that the group frequent for their drinking needs. Griz is perpetually drunk and, as a result, prone to fits of alcoholic rage and extremely poor judgment, the latter of which includes driving severely intoxicated and encouraging the dishonest deeds of others. On the rare occasion Griz is seen sober, he is quick to \\"fix\\" this by immediately consuming large quantities of alcohol to return to what he perceives to be his natural state, as he looks upon sobriety with contempt. He also has a sister who is equally repugnant in the way she carries herself. *Mort Bromberg ‚Äì The man responsible for running Reilly over with his car, crippling him. Feeling guilty, Mort unwittingly buys Reilly an extravagant mansion next to his own, much to the chagrin of his wife, Liz, who despises Reilly and his friends. Despite caring for his wife and doing anything he can to please her, he is often met with Liz's callous indifference to his efforts and even well-being (such as Liz opting to go shopping for a black dress instead of calling for help when Mort suffered a heart attack, in one episode). *Liz Bromberg ‚Äì Mort's cold-blooded wife. Liz detests Reilly and his friends for the mere fact they are disabled and feels their disadvantaged nature does not jell with the environment of their affluent neighborhood. She initially tried to have the group evicted, but subsequent episodes revolved around her finding some way to take advantage of them. *Deborah ‚Äì The group's physical therapist who runs a rehabilitation clinic the group frequent for sessions with. She is cheerful and positive, yet addresses the group in a patronizing manner, especially Fontaine, who she speaks to in Ebonics, perhaps assuming he cannot understand standard English. *Sister Butch ‚Äì A Catholic nun who resides in the cathedral next door to Reilly's house and frequently spies on him and his activities using a pair of binoculars. A harsh and vindictive disciplinarian who believes she is doing God's work, she is often seen attempting to proselytize and force her views down the throats of others. Like Liz Bromberg, Sister Butch is contemptuous of Reilly and his friends, yet, however, does come to his aid on several occasions and even saves his life twice. This is most likely an ulterior motive to persuade Reilly into attending church more regularly.

Judson Research Center, Peace Studies Center, and Gender Studies Center are parts of Myanmar Institute of Theology. MIT's library has over 30,000 usable volumes and more than 30 periodical subscriptions for students and faculty. Myanmar Institute of Theology  History  Myanmar Institute of Theology Myanmar Institute of Theology, originally known as Baptist Divinity School, was founded in June 1927, on Seminary Hill, Insein. With only four students to begin with, the school used the facilities of Karen Theological Seminary currently known as Kayin Baptist Theological Seminary. Shortly after its opening the school became affiliated with Northern Baptist Theological Seminary in Chicago, Illinois. This affiliation lasted until the Second World War. The first president was Dr. W. E. Wiatt, an American missionary who served from 1927 to 1939. The school was renamed in 1939 as the Willis and Orlinda Pierce Divinity School (1939-1949). The second president of the school was Dr. C. F. Chaney who served from 1939 to 1941, when the Japanese occupied Burma. In 1948, the school reopened with Thra Chit Maung as chairperson of the Curriculum Committee. In 1952, with the arrival of Dr. Paul D. Clasper, Thra Chit Maung was made president and Dr. Clasper, vice-president. The school was renamed in 1949 as the Burma Divinity School (1949-1976). In 1955, it became affiliated with Central Baptist Theological Seminary of Kansas City, Kansas. This affiliation lasted until 1960, when the school became an accredited member of the Association for Theological Education in South East Asia. Since 1960, the school has been conferring degrees on its graduates. Since 1966, with the departure of American Baptist missionaries from Myanmar, the school has been entirely staffed by nationals. The seminary has faithfully carried out its education mission, adapting and responding to the challenges of the new day. In 1976, the name was again changed to Burma Institute of Theology (1976-1989) as it was deemed more appropriate to the situation in Burma. In 1977, on Dr. Chit Maung‚Äôs retirement, Thramu Esther Lwin was made acting-president and then president from June 1978 to the end of 1983. In January 1984, Rev. Victor San Lone, who had been serving as general secretary of the Burma Baptist Convention, became president and served in that capacity until his sudden death in 1987. Thramu Eh Wah, the vice-president, was made acting-president until March 1988, when she was officially appointed President. The seminary‚Äôs name was changed to Myanmar Institute of Theology in 1989, when the country changed its name to Myanmar. Dr. Eh Wah retired in 1998. The then vice- principal Dr. Anna May Say Pa was elected the principal. Rev. Dr. Simon Pau Khan En succeeded in 2006, and when he retired in 2010, Rev. Dr. Samuel Ngun Ling became President of MIT effective from 2010-2011 academic year. Throughout its history, the school has served as an institution of higher theological education. More than 20 ethnic groups and not less than 10 Christian denominations are represented each year in the student body. Until 1962, only the BTh program was offered. That year the Bachelor of Religious Education program was introduced and in 1976, the BD program was initiated. In 1996, no new BTh applicants were accepted for the BTh program as the Board of Trustees had decided that the seminary would offer only graduate programs. In 1997, MIT started the MDiv, and MTS degree programs and replaced the BD program. March 1999 saw the last batch of B.Th. graduates and the first batch of MTS graduates. March 2000 marked the graduation of the first batch of the Master of Divinity class. Year 2000 is a milestone for launching new programs such as Summer School, Summer Seminar and Bachelor of Arts in Religious Studies (BARS). In 2004, MIT launched the Doctor of Ministry (DMin) program in partnership with the Union Theological Seminary, Manila, the Philippines. The program ended in 2008 when MIT started a new partnership for Doctor of Ministry program with the Central Baptist Theological Seminary, Kansas, USA, to take effect from 2010-2011 academic year. Master of Ministry (MMin) degree program was inaugurated in 2006 in respond to the needs of the churches and communities to promote a quality leadership in the church and society. The year 2010 saw the opening of a new program called Master of Theological Librarianship (MTL) and the termination of the old program called Master of Theological Studies (MTS). In 2014, MIT launched the PhD degree program in the commemoration of the 200th anniversary of the arrival of the American Baptist missionaries, Adoniram and Ann Judson in the soil of Myanmar. Academics =Liberal Arts Program= In response to the current education crisis of the country, MIT planned to offer a four-year B.A. Religious Studies degree program with a Liberal Arts curriculum. This degree program was officially accepted by the Board of Trustees on December 14, 1999. The program was inaugurated in October 2000 introducing BARS degree curriculum. In 2010, the name was changed to Liberal Arts Program (LAP) because it tended to focus on offering Master courses. It is well known as BARS.

He was born September 17, 1943 in Baltimore, Maryland. He served as Professor of Theoretical Ecology at the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science's Chesapeake Biological Laboratory in Solomons, Maryland until his retirement in 2008. Ulanowicz received both his BS and PhD in chemical engineering from Johns Hopkins University in 1964 and 1968, respectively. Ulanowicz currently resides in Gainesville, Florida, where he holds a Courtesy Professorship in the Department of Biology at the University of Florida. Since relocating to Florida, Ulanowicz has served as a scientific advisor to the Howard T. Odum Florida Springs Institute, an organization dedicated to the preservation and welfare of Florida's natural springs. Overview Ulanowicz uses techniques from information theory and thermodynamics to study the organization of flows of energy and nutrients within ecosystems. Although his ideas have been primarily applied in ecology, many of his concepts are abstract and have been applied to other areas in which flow networks arise, such as psychology and economics. Though Ulanowicz began his career modeling ecological systems using differential equations, he soon reached the limits of this approach.Mann, K.H., T.C. Platt and R.E Ulanowicz, (eds) 1981, Mathematical Models in Biological Oceanography, UNESCO Monographs on Oceanographic Methodology, 7 UNESCO Press, Paris, 157 p. Realizing that any ecosystem is a complex system, he decided to move away from what he saw as the inappropriate use of the reductionist approach, and instead began to work towards development of theoretical measures of the ecosystem as a whole, such as ascendency. Gradually, he came to appreciate the ecosystem behavior is not simply a matter of \\"mechanics with noise,\\" but rather an intricate interplay between opposing tendencies‚Äîautocatalytic-like self-organization and entropic decay. This natural conversation could be followed quantitatively using information- theoretic measures applies to networks of trophic processes. Following Gregory Bateson, Ulanowicz points out how ecology differs significantly from physics in that constraints that are absent play important roles in ecosystem dynamics. He also argues how the homogeneous laws of physics only constrain the behavior of very heterogeneous ecosystems but are incapable by themselves of determining outcomes. He goes so far as to suggest that an entirely new metaphysics, which he calls Process Ecology, is required to understand complex living systems.Ulanowicz, Robert E. \\"Process Ecology: Making Room for Creation.\\" Sophia (2016): 1-24. One pertinent discovery by Ulanowicz was that ecosystems do not progress to maximum efficiency. Ecosystems that channel too much activity along the most efficient pathways do so at the expense of redundant, less-efficient processes that can function to take over vital activities in the event that the more efficient processes are disrupted. Ecosystems that persist are those that achieve a balance between the mutually exclusive attributes of efficiency and reliability.Ulanowicz, R.E. 2009. \\"The dual nature of ecosystem dynamics Ecological Modelling 220: 1886-1892. This result from nature poses a significant challenge to mainstream economics, wherein market efficiency is held to be the sine qua non.Goerner, S.J., Lietaer, B., and Ulanowicz, R.E. 2009. \\"Quantifying economic sustainability: Implications for free-enterprise theory, policy, and practice.\\" Ecological Economics 69:76-81.

AAJ's stated mission is to \\"promote a fair and effective justice system.\\" Focused on opposing tort reform, the organization is one of the Democratic Party's most influential political allies, according to the Washington Post. History In 1946, a group of plaintiffs' attorneys involved in workers' compensation litigation founded the National Association of Claimants' Compensation Attorneys (NACCA). As their work broadened beyond workers' compensation, in 1960 the NACCA changed its name to the National Association of Claimants' Counsel of America, and four years later, to the American Trial Lawyers Association. In 1972, these groups merged as the Association of Trial Lawyers of America (ATLA). In 1977, ATLA's headquarters moved from Boston to Washington, D.C. In 2006, ATLA became the American Association for Justice (AAJ). Around the same time, a group of attorneys quietly began forming a competitor organization to AAJ. The competitor organization called itself The American Trial Lawyers Association, or TheATLA. TheATLA solicited thousands of AAJ's members to join. AAJ filed suit to force TheATLA to drop the name, arguing it was confusing AAJ members and infringing a trademark held by AAJ. Activities Members of the AAJ have been responsible for multibillion-dollar settlements in cigarette cases and millions of asbestos injury claims. The association has been criticized by organizations such as the United States Chamber of Commerce for its role as a special interest and lobbying group promoting the interests of plaintiffs' lawyers. In 2006, ATLA's membership voted to change their name to the American Association for Justice. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce responded by again criticizing the organization.

He has also played with Van Halen frontman David Lee Roth and the L.A. band Lizzy Borden in addition to leading his own bands, Terriff, and currently, Farmikos. Biography Born in New Jersey and raised in Los Angeles, Holmes took lessons from guitarist Randy Rhoads in 1979. Holmes formed Terriff in 1983 but left to join Lizzy Borden in 1987, appearing on the Visual Lies album. He left Lizzy Borden in 1988 and reformed Terriff, staying with the latter group until 1990. =David Lee Roth= Holmes then joined David Lee Roth's band for a tour in 1991, replacing Jason Becker who was diagnosed with ALS while recording the album A Little Ain't Enough. Back in L.A., Holmes once again re-activated Terriff trying out and rehearsing with different singers, including former Badlands vocalist Ray Gillen. Eventually, the band recruited Jeff Biebuyck to be their new frontman and changed the name from Terriff to Dogma and, finally, Alien Ink recording an album's worth of material with producer Rich Mouser. =Ozzy Osbourne= In 1995, after Ozzy Osbourne had finished recording the Ozzmosis album, a replacement for Zakk Wylde was needed for the tour. While working on his own band, Joe got a call from Deen Castronovo (Ozzy's drummer) to let him know they were seeking a guitar player. Joe went down to Audible Studios in Los Angeles and played three Ozzy classics. Holmes did not mention that he had taken lessons from Randy Rhoads (former guitarist for Osbourne) as he thought it would hurt his chances at the job. He succeeded though and got the part. In Ozzy's book \\"Diary of a Madman: Ozzy Osbourne - The Stories Behind the Songs\\" it says \\"Always on the lookout for a bright, new talent, Ozzy spotted a guitarist who plays like a motherfucker\\" referring to Joe Holmes who had previously worked with David Lee Roth and was a pupil of Randy Rhoads. While on tour, Rhoads would himself take classical guitar tuition and arrange workshops in which he gave lessons to young players. \\"It's really spooky.\\" said Ozzy, \\"because when Joe plays the Randy Rhoads stuff, he plays just like him - it's like I can see Randy's fingers.\\" Holmes performed on the Ozzmosis tour with Osbourne. He started the tour 19 August 1995 at the Austin Music Hall in Austin, Texas. He remained Ozzy's guitarist playing Ozzfest 96 through 2000 tours. Holmes left the band while recording and writing the Down to Earth album. While Holmes does not play on the album, the songs \\"Can You Hear Them?\\", \\"Junkie\\", and \\"That I Never Had\\", which were co-written by Holmes, appear on the album. The only songs from his work with Ozzy that have been released is \\"Walk on Water\\", which first appeared on the Beavis and Butt- Head Do America soundtrack, before appearing on the bonus disc for Ozzy's 1997's compilation The Ozzman Cometh and \\"Perry Mason\\" live from the 1997 Ozzfest Live CD. =Farmikos= In late December 2012, news broke of Holmes' new band Farmikos, featuring former Laidlaw vocalist Robert Locke. The band's name has no particular meaning and was derived from their song \\"Scapegoat\\", which was originally titled \\"Pharmikos\\". \\"Pharmikos\\" was then changed to \\"Farmikos\\" for aesthetics. It became the band's name. In early January 2013, the band's website began to stream the song \\"Scapegoat\\", the first Farmikos song to surface, with guest contributions from Holmes' former Ozzy Osbourne bandmate, Metallica bassist Robert Trujillo, and Bad Religion drummer Brooks Wackerman. Another song, \\"The Sound Of My Gun\\", also featuring Trujillo and Wackerman, premiered in early March 2013. Farmikos continues to record new music with longtime Holmes studio affiliate, engineer/producer Rich Mouser. In late July 2013 Farmikos released a video teaser for the song \\"Exit Stencils\\" on the official FARMIKOS YouTube channel. The Video features footage of Holmes recording solo tracks in the studio. In December 2013 two more video teasers were released on the official FARMIKOS YouTube channel for the songs \\"Spoon and Sun\\" and \\"Scapegoat\\". An EP was announced for February 2014. Recorded at the Mouse House in Pasadena, California with engineer/mixer Rich Mouser (SPOCK'S BEARD, TRANSATLANTIC, VAST), the EP also features guest contributions from Holmes' former Ozzy Osbourne bandmate, bassist Robert Trujillo, and drummer Brooks Wackerman. However, on March 18, 2014, instead of an EP, Farmikos released four digital singles: \\"Scapegoat\\", \\"Kings Of Dust\\", \\"Exit Stencils\\" and \\"The Sound Of My Gun\\". The band then continued to release new singles: \\"Spoon and Sun\\" was released in May and \\"Am I One\\" was released in July, adding, \\"Fragile\\", \\"Ascension\\" and \\"I Was Them\\" as the year went on. In early January 2015, they released \\"Facing East\\", just before an album became available on January 15, 2015. This album compiles all the songs released as singles, to date. On Eddie Trunk's radio show, January 12, 2015, Joe Holmes revealed his intentions to shoot a couple videos in February for the songs \\"Scapegoat\\" and \\"Am I One\\", as well as doing some live shows in 2015. He also mentioned that the band has six or seven songs almost finished, ready for a future release.

Most of The Fighting 69th was filmed at Warner Brothers' Calabasas Ranch location, which served as Camp Mills, the regiment's training base, various French villages, and numerous battlefields.The Fighting 69th at TCM.com Plot The plot centers on misfit Jerry Plunkett (James Cagney), a tough-talking New Yorker who displays a mixture of bravado and cowardice. Caught up in patriotic fervor when the United States enters WWI, he proves to be a coward in battle. The chaplain, Father Francis P. Duffy (Pat O'Brien) attempts to reform Plunkett. Sgt. \\"Big Mike\\" Wynn (Alan Hale, Sr.) loses both his brothers in action due to Plunkett's blunders. Major Donovan ultimately orders Plunkett to be court- martialed. While he is awaiting execution, his jail cell is destroyed by a German shell, freeing him. He then sees Father Duffy ministering to several wounded troops, urging them to keep their faith and have courage. Shamed and inspired by Donovan's forbearance, Plunkett runs to rejoin his unit at the front. Coming across a mortar whose crew have almost all been killed, he forces the only surviving soldier, Sgt. \\"Big Mike\\" Wynn, to show him how to operate it. He then uses it to save his entire unit. Finally, he sacrifices his life to protect \\"Big Mike\\" by covering a grenade with his body. While Jerry Plunkett was a fictional character, Father Duffy, Major Donovan, Lt. Ames, and poet Joyce Kilmer were all real members of the 69th. Many of the events depicted (training at Camp Mills, the Mud March, dugout collapse at Rouge Bouquet, crossing the Ourcq River, Victory Parade, etc.) actually happened.

The keys to the first houses to be occupied, in Homefield Road, were handed over to their tenants in February 1950. The Queens Square shopping parade was visited by Queen Elizabeth II on 20 July 1952, to lay the first foundation slab of St. Barnabas Church. The area Part of Queens Square neighbourhood shopping centre at Adeyfield Adeyfield is mainly a mixture of New Town properties built to the south of Adeyfield Road and houses built privately in the 40s, 50s and 60s on the north side. There are also a few older terraced cottages near the junction of Adeyfield Road and Great Road. There is one large Victorian house and this is shown on the 1898 Ordnance Survey map as being the only house in the area at the time, apart from Adeyfield Farm. The neighbourhood spans from the Hemel Hempstead Industrial Estate in the east, to Queensway in the north, to the A414 (St Albans Road) in the south, to the Town Centre in the west. It borders the neighbourhoods of Highfield, Bennetts End, Leverstock Green and the town centre (known locally as Paradise). The location was originally farmland occupied by Coxpond Farm and Adeyfield Farm. It was planned by the chief architect for the new town, Mr H Kellet Ablett who received the 'Urban Medal' for his work from the Eastern Housing Region. As well as housing the area has new town built shops, schools, churches, a community centre and playing fields. By 1956 the development corporation described the area as complete. In order to provide some quick, easy and cheap accommodations after the Second World War, the easternmost part of Adeyfield was the chosen site for a set of temporary tin houses known as pre-fabs. The houses remain to this day, however the exterior tin has now been covered up by sheets of white wood and cladding on most of the houses. Places of worship There are four churches in the District, St Barnabas, in the Queen's Square, Jubilee Christian Fellowship which is also in Queens Square in the Community Centre, the Adeyfield Free Church, on the border of the district on Leverstock Green Road, and the Catholic Church on St Albans Road. Schools Adeyfield is home to Adeyfield School, the major secondary school in the area and two primary schools (see Primary schools in Dacorum). Public houses Adeyfield boasts three pubs, one corporately owned and the other two private. The Crabtree, located on Leverstock Green Road, is part of the Ember Inns chain. The other two pubs are The Jubilee in the Queen's Square, and The Midland on Midland Road (across the road from the old location of the Nicky Line's \\"Midland Station\\", correctly known as Hemel Hempstead). Until 2013, The Jubilee was called The New Venture. The Midland was originally called The Midland Hotel, then The Mayflower, before partly reverting to the original name. The Queen's Square In common with the rest of the planned neighbourhoods in Hemel Hempstead, Adeyfield has a village centre, known as the Queen's Square. There are many different convenience stores in the square, most notably the Co-operative Supermarket, and two branches of Lloyd's Pharmacy. The square was named after the visit paid by The Queen in 1952 when she laid the foundation stone for the Church of St Barnabas. Evelyn Sharp House During the 1970s the Commission for New Towns and Dacorum Borough Council invested in developing sheltered housing provision for the elderly in the town - a ground-breaking development at the time. The first of these was Evelyn Sharp House, located in Field Road, Adeyfield. A full-time, on-site Warden was available to support the needs of the residents. The first Warden of ESH was Jean Roberts, who was there for 18 years from its opening until her retirement. Arrangements for supporting residents and managing the property have changed since, and there is no longer an on-site Warden.

Character overview Aura is the daughter of the series' villain, Ming the Merciless, but saves Flash Gordon from her father. She soon realizes that her love for Flash is unrequited, but later falls in love with Prince Barin, the rightful heir to the throne of Mongo. She and Barin are eventually banished to the forest world of Arboria. Appearances =Comic strips= Princess Aura first appeared in the fourth installment of the 1934 comic strip Flash Gordon. She defies her father and saves Flash, but finds that she cannot seduce him away from Dale Arden. Aura later falls in love with Prince Barin and marries him. =Film= In 1936, Princess Aura was portrayed by Priscilla Lawson in the Flash Gordon film serial. In 1940, the role was portrayed by Shirley Deane in the third Flash Gordon serial, Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe. In 1980, Princess Aura was portrayed by Ornella Muti in the film Flash Gordon produced by Dino De Laurentiis and is shown to have numerous lovers. She saves Flash from death with the help of one of her lovers, a royal doctor who revives Flash after Ming tries executing him in a gas chamber. =Television= Melendy Britt provided the voice of Princess Aura in the 1979 Filmation animated series. She was portrayed as Ming the Merciless' daughter, who at first assists her father in battling Flash and company, but turns against him and joins the rebel forces of Mongo. She also has an elite guard of female warriors under her command known as the Witch-Women. After Ming is removed from power, the Witch-Women remain in Princess Aura's service. Princess Aura also initially resents Dale Arden and rejects Prince Barin's affections, but would become the former's friend and the latter's love interest as the series progressed. Consequently, her attraction to Flash is downplayed and does not resurface after her desertion of her father. In the 1996 Flash Gordon animated series, Princess Aura is a sympathetic character, who often defies her father because of her attraction to Flash, or for the sake of her mother. In this version, Aura has green skin, but is otherwise perfectly human, even though her father Ming is reptilian. She is voiced by Tracey Hoyt. Anna Van Hooft portrayed Princess Aura in the 2007 Flash Gordon television series. She is once again portrayed as a sympathetic character. Unlike the comic, she has a brother and her mother is alive. She vainly seeks her father's approval but Ming, like most other characters on the show, regards her with a mixture of pity and contempt. She also has a crush on Flash and a rivalry with Dale who looks down on her as a \\"royal little brat\\".

In American usage such divisions are generally referred to as colleges (e.g., \\"college of arts and sciences\\") or schools (e.g., \\"school of business\\"), but may also mix terminology (e.g., Harvard University has a \\"faculty of arts and scienceshttps://www.fas.harvard.edu/\\" but a \\"law school\\"). History The medieval University of Bologna, which served as a model for most of the later medieval universities in Europe, had four faculties: students began at the Faculty of Arts, graduates from which could then continue at the higher Faculties of Theology, Law, and Medicine. The privilege to establish these four faculties was usually part of medieval universities‚Äô charters, but not every university could do so in practice. The Faculty of Arts took its name from the seven liberal arts: the triviumThe three of the humanities (grammar, rhetoric, dialectics) and the quadriviumThe four of the natural sciences (arithmetic, music, geometry and astronomy). In German, Scandinavian, Slavic and related universities, it would more often be called the Faculty of Philosophy.The medieval university Arts/Philosophy faculty soon expanded its curriculum with the three Aristotelian philosophies: physics, metaphysics and moral philosophy. The degree of Magister Artium (Master of Arts) derives its name from the Faculty of Arts, while the degree of Doctor Philosophiae (Doctor of Philosophy) derives its name from the Faculty of Philosophy, German name of the same faculty. Whether called Faculty of Arts or Faculty of Philosophy, it taught a range of subjects with general and fundamental applicability. The higher Faculty of Law and Faculty of Medicine were intended, much like today, for specialized education required for professions. The Faculty of Theology was the most prestigious, as well as least common in the first 500 years‚Äîand generally one that popes sought most to control. Although also \\"professional\\" education for clergy, theology (until the Enlightenment) was also seen as the ultimate subject at universities, named \\"The Queen of the Sciences\\", and often set the example for the other faculties. The number of faculties has usually multiplied in modern universities, both through subdivisions of the traditional four faculties and through the absorption of academic disciplines that developed within originally vocational schools, in areas such as engineering or agriculture.  Faculty of Arts  A Faculty of Arts is a university division teaching in areas traditionally classified as \\"liberal arts\\" for academic purposes (from Latin , \\"worthy of a free person\\", and , \\"art or principled practice\\"), generally including creative arts, writing, philosophy, and humanities. A traditional division of the teaching bodies of medieval universities (the others being Law, Medicine and Theology), the Faculty of Arts was the lowest in rank but also the largest (the higher faculties admitted only Arts graduates).The Faculty of Arts - Catholic Encyclopedia article Instead of \\"Arts\\", this faculty often had the name \\"Philosophy\\".

Ollman attended the University of Wisconsin, receiving a BA in political science in 1956 and an MA in political science in 1957. He went on to study at Oxford University, earning a B.A. in Philosophy, Politics and Economics in 1959, an MA in political theory in 1963, and a PhD in political theory in 1967. He already had gained much teaching experience before receiving his PhD, and began teaching at NYU in 1967, immediately after earning his PhD.

The column had characterized his teaching style as indoctrination, including an anonymous quote from another professor saying, \\"Ollman has no status within the profession, but is a pure and simple activist.\\" Ollman's suit was defeated in the D.C. Circuit Court, which held that Novak and Evans's column was protected speech.Ollman v. Evans - AltLaw In 2001, he won the first Charles McCoy Life Achievement Award from the New Political Science section of the American Political Science Association. In 2005, as a protest against Israel, Ollman wrote and published a Letter of Resignation from the Jewish People, stating: \\"Socialist and ex-Jew that I am, I guess I still have too much respect and love for the Jewish tradition I left behind to want the world to view it in the same way as they rightly view and condemn what the ex-Jews who call themselves Zionists are doing in its name. And if changing my status from ex- Jew (current) to non-Jew (projected) stirs even ten good people (God's minyan) into action against the Zionist hijacking of the Jewish label, then this is a sacrifice I am ready to make.\\" Sean Hannity dispute Ollman appeared on \\"Hannity & Colmes\\" to face the accusation that as Sean Hannity's professor in the 1980s, he had given Hannity a lower grade for being a politically conservative supporter of Ronald Reagan. Ollman pointed out that he had been a Professor of Political Science at New York University for 40 years and claimed that had he discriminated against conservative students, he \\"would not have lasted long.\\" Ollman gave a detailed account of his teaching and an explanation of why his non-Marxist students \\"do at least as well as the rest of the class\\" in a 1978 letter to the editor of the Washington Post.A Marxist without Devil's Horns Works * Alienation: Marx's Conception of Man in Capitalist Society, Cambridge University Press, 1971; 2nd ed., 1976 (This book has gone through thirteen printings, sold close to 30,000 copies, and been translated into Spanish, Italian, and Korean) * (co-ed.), Studies in Socialist Pedagogy, Monthly Review Press, 1978 * Social and Sexual Revolution: Essays on Marx and Reich, South End Press, 1978 * Class Struggle Is the Name of the Game: True Confessions of a Marxist Businessman, Wm.

Chemistry Flowers distilled oil contains phenylethyl alcohol (27%), benzyl alcohol (12%), eicosane (5.6%), eugenol (5.6%), n-tetracosane (4.4%), caryophyllene oxide (3.1%), 1-hexadecanol (2.7%), methoxyeugenol (2.45%), benzaldehyde (2.32%). Flowers alcohol extract contains cytotoxic steroids. Pharmacology =Toxicity= Ingestion of C. nocturnum has not been well documented, but there is some reason to believe that caution is in order. All members of the family Solanaceae contain an alkaloid toxin called solanine,What is solanine. Wisegeek though some members of the family are routinely eaten without ill-effect. The most commonly reported problems associated with C. nocturnum are respiratory problems from the scent, and feverish symptoms following ingestion. Some people, especially those with respiratory sensitivities or asthma, have reported difficulty breathing, irritation of the nose and throat, headache, nausea, or other symptoms when exposed to the blossom's powerful scent. Some Cestrum species contain chlorogenic acid, and the presence of this potent sensitizer may be responsible for this effect in C. nocturnum. Some plant guides describe C. nocturnum as \\"toxic\\" and warn that ingesting plant parts, especially fruit, may result in elevated temperature, rapid pulse, excess salivation and gastritis. Spoerke et al. describe the following toxic effects reported from ingesting C. nocturnum: Ingesting 15 lb of plant material caused a cow to salivate, clamp its jaws, collapse, and eventually die. A postmortem showed gastroenteritis and congestion of liver, kidneys, brain, and spinal cord. Although the berries and the sap are suspected of being toxic, several cases of ingestion of the berries have not shown them to be a problem, with one exception. Morton cites a case where children ate significant quantities (handfuls) of berries and had no significant effects and another two where berries were ingested in smaller amounts, with similar negative results. Ingestion of green berries over several weeks by a 2-year-old child resulted in diarrhea, vomiting, and blood clots in the stool. Anemia and purpura [discoloration of the skin caused by subcutaneous bleeding] were also noted. A solanine alkaloid isolated from the stool was hemolytic to human erythrocytes. Plant extracts have shown larvicidal activity against the mosquito Aedes aegypti while showing no toxicity to fish. Plant extracts cause hematological changes in the freshwater fish when exposed to sub lethal concentrations. =Psychoactivity= The mechanisms of the plant's putative psychoactive effects are currently unknown, and anecdotal data are extremely limited and include an aphrodisiac power. In a rare discussion of traditional entheogenic use of the plant, M√ºller-Ebeling, R√§tsch, and Shahi describe shamanic use of C. nocturnum in Nepal. They describe experiencing \\"trippy\\" effects without mentioning unpleasant physical side effects. R√§tsch's Encyclopedia of Psychoactive Plants also describes a handful of reports of ingestion of the plant without mentioning serious adverse side effects. Invasive potential Cestrum nocturnum has become widely naturalized in tropical and subtropical regions throughout the world, including Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, southern China and the southernmost United States, and is difficult to eradicate. It is classed as a weed in some countries. In Auckland, New Zealand, it has been reported as a seriously invasive weed to the Auckland Regional Council and is under investigation. NS Forest and Bird is compiling an inventory of wild cestrum sites in order to place the plant on the banned list. The inventory can be viewed via Google Maps.Cestrum wild locations ‚Äì Google Maps.

His younger sister was Anne Parr (1515-1552) wife of William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke (c.1501-1570). Career His father died in 1517 when William was aged 4 and he became a ward of King Henry VIII, from whom his mother re-purchased his marriage, at great expense.G. E. Cokayne, The Complete Peerage, n.s., IX, p.672, note (a) Parr took part in suppressing the rising in the North of England in 1537, when he attracted the favourable notice of Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk (uncle of both Queen Anne Boleyn and Queen Catherine Howard), encouraging his uncle Sir William Parr (c.1483-1547) of Horton, Northamptonshire, to obtain a place for him as a courtier in the king's privy chamber.G.

In December 1543, just after his sister had married the king, he was created Earl of Essex, a title held by his late father-in-law Henry Bourchier, 2nd Earl of Essex, who had died without male issue in March 1540. He was King Edward VI's \\"beloved uncle\\" (in fact step-uncle, being the brother of that king's step-mother) and one of the most important men at Edward's court, and the leader of the Protestant party, especially during the time of John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland's time as leader of the government. Parr served as Lord Lieutenant in 1549 of five of the eastern counties (Cambridgeshire, Huntingdonshire, Bedfordshire, Northamptonshire and Norfolk), of Surrey in 1551, of Berkshire and Oxfordshire in 1552 and of Hertfordshire and Buckinghamshire in 1553. He served as Lord Great Chamberlain from 1550 to 1553, in which role in 1551 he welcomed Mary of Guise, Regent of Scotland, to Hampton Court Palace on behalf of the King. Parr, and especially his wife, were leaders in the attempt to put the Protestant Lady Jane Grey (daughter-in-law of Northumberland) on the throne after Edward's death (as that king had desired) in place of the other contender his half-sister the Roman Catholic Queen Mary. However his attempt failed and after the accession of Mary I in 1553 he was convicted of high treason, was attainted and sentenced to death on 18 August 1553. However he was released within a few months and following the accession of the Protestant Queen Elizabeth I, his title of Marquess of Northampton was recreated for him in 1559.

If the broker is a member of the National Association of Realtors, the agreement must include all of the following terms: #A beginning date and a termination date. #The list price at which the property will be offered for sale. #The amount of compensation offered to the broker, whether it is in the form of a flat fee or percentage of the sales price. #The terms and conditions under which the brokerage fee shall be paid by the seller. #Authorizes the broker to co-operate with other brokers as sub-agents or buyer's agents and details the compensation to be offered to those brokers in the event they procure a buyer. #Authorizes the broker to reveal or not to reveal the existence of offers previously received. In addition, other terms which may appear in the agreement can include: *Authorization to the broker to post a sign, to advertise the property, and to put a lockbox on the door, as well seller's obligations to advise the broker on the condition of the property, and broker's obligations to advise the seller about regulations and laws which may affect the sale. Typically, separate listing agreements exist for the sale of residential property, for land, and for commercial or business property. Upon listing the property, the real estate agency tries to obtain a buyer for the property and, in consideration of successfully finding a satisfactory buyer, the broker anticipates receiving a commission (fee) for the services the brokerage provided. Payment of a commission or fee Although the terms of the contract could vary, usually the payment of a commission (or fee) to the brokerage is contingent upon: *the successful negotiation of a purchase contract between a satisfactory buyer and seller and the subsequent ability and willingness of the buyer to close the deal, or *finding a satisfactory buyer who is ready, willing, and able to pay the full listing price (or more) for the real estate for sale without any contingencies. If the seller refuses to sell the real estate when one of the above two conditions applies, it is typically considered that the real estate agent has done their job of finding a satisfactory buyer and the seller must still pay the commission, although the details are determined by the listing contract. Unless closing (or \\"settlement\\" or \\"close of escrow\\", as it is known in some parts of the country) is a condition of the listing agreement, the buyer's failure to complete the transaction may not require the seller to pay a commission to the broker. The commission is usually a percentage of the sales price of the property ranging from 2 or 3% up to about 10%, but usually in the range of about 3 - 7% for houses. The commission could also be a flat fee or some combination of flat fee and percentage, based on the rate you negotiate. Commission rates and fees are negotiable and not regulated. The average days to sale in your market, advertising, labor costs, length of term, and competition may influence the rate acceptable by the listing real estate broker before entering a listing agreement. The commission is paid by the seller to the listing real estate broker, who will then compensate their listing agent and any co-operating brokers/agents from this commission by separate agreements with them. Listing price and final contract price The listing contract typically also includes a listing price for the property and a date of expiration by which the contract expires. However, if the property is sold at a lower or higher price, the seller pays a commission at a proportionally lower or higher amount. If the seller does not accept a price lower than the listing price, then the broker will have to wait until a satisfactory sale to earn the commission. In the event of multiple offers being presented, the seller may accept whichever offer is most suitable to him/her, even if the price is not the highest. The percentage commission will be paid according to the accepted price. The seller, often in concurrence with the real estate agent, may choose to accept an offer that is lower than the highest offer for various reasons, such as terms or contingencies in the purchase contract offered or perceived differences in financial qualification of the competing buyers. Typically, the real estate agent has the experience and data to determine a suitable listing price for the seller's property and will recommend a listing price to the seller. The seller can accept, reject, or try to negotiate a different listing price for the contract. If the seller's price is unrealistically high and the agent cannot convince the seller otherwise, the agent can decline to list the property. Sunday, August 23, 2020 Expiration date Listing a property commonly incurs certain expenses for the listing broker and takes some time and effort for the listing salesperson. To make it worthwhile, they want a certain minimum listing time period to have a good chance of selling the property. However, the listing contract must have an expiration date. A typical listing period is often three to six months. If the property is not sold or under a purchase contract by then, the seller may decide to re-list the property, perhaps with a different listing price, with the same or a different broker or agent, or not list it at all. The listing of the property can start at a date later than the date the listing contract is signed to allow the seller time to prepare the property for showing or sale. Types of listing contracts There can be several types of listing contracts: *Exclusive right to sell: The seller must pay the brokerage a commission if, by the expiration date in the listing contract, the real estate is sold, regardless of whether the buyer is obtained through the agency or not. Even if the seller finds the buyer him/herself, a commission is still owed to the brokerage. Furthermore, the seller cannot list the property with any other broker until the listing expires with the property unsold. :Brokers who are REALTORS and, thus, are members of NAR are obliged to enter the property into the local MLS system and offer compensation to co-operating brokers. *Exclusive Agency: The seller can only list the property with one brokerage until the listing contract expires with the property unsold. The seller must pay the broker a commission if the real estate is sold to a buyer obtained through that brokerage. By agreement, if the seller finds the buyer him/herself, the seller does not have to pay a commission. Since there will be no co-operating broker involved, the property will not be listed in the MLS. *Open Agency: A seller can enter into an agreement to sell their property with more than one brokerage in open agency listings. The seller must pay a commission only to the brokerage which brings the buyer for the real estate. Typically, if the seller finds the buyer him/herself, the seller does not have to pay a commission.

Its population during the 2000 Census was 47, and an estimated 38 as of 2009. History Alder was originally settled around 1882, when Charles Adler and four associates acquired land in the area and proposed to start a new settlement, to be named Adler, roughly halfway between the present day cities of Petersburg and McVille. Adler itself comes from the German word for eagle. A post office was established in May 1882, with Mr. Adler as its first postmaster. A tavern and hotel soon followed. Adler soon grew to a small town of around 30 residents, and Mr. Adler expected continued growth since the site was located along the planned route for the Great Northern Railroad. He was quoted as saying \\"we shall break up at least 1500 acres and push the opening of good farms at once\\" and that a schoolhouse \\"second to none\\" would be built. However in the fall of 1882 railroad officials opted to build their line to the north, and further settlement of Adler diminished. Adler's post office closed in 1905. The township, however, continued to attract settlers in the early 1900s, growing from 77 residents in 1890 to a peak population of 305 in 1910.

He has been active since the mid-1970s, when he was part of the New York City punk rock scene with his original band, Testors. Vincent is currently active in music, film, multi-media art, and writing. His pedigree includes mid-70s Testors' performances at C.B.G.B. and Max's Kansas City. Always active in his own bands, Vincent also spent time touring and recording for 9 years as Maureen \\"Moe\\" Tucker and Sterling Morrison's guitar player (both of the Velvet Underground.) Members of Vincent's bands include a vast range of players/characters, from the drummer of the Stooges, Scott Asheton, to Charles Manson's one-time guitar player, Ernie Knapp. Early life and career Sonny Vincent was born in New York City and had difficult relationships with his foster parents, teachers, and other adult authority figures. Vincent formed Testors in 1975 with Gene Sinigalliano (guitar) and Gregory R (drums). Later line-ups included Surrealist Ron Pieniak (Rex Pharaoh) on bass, Jeff Couganour (Jeff West) on drums, and Kenneth Huebner (Kenneth Brighton) on bass. Testors played New York clubs such as Max's Kansas City, and CBGB and Philadelphia's Hot Club with groups such as: Mink DeVille, Teenage Jesus and the Jerks, The Cramps, and Suicide. They also toured nationwide with the Dead Boys. Testors released a 7\\" single in 1976, \\"Together\\" b/w \\"Time Is Mine.\\" In 1981, Testors disbanded and Vincent moved to Minneapolis. In 1982, he formed Sonny Vincent and the Extreme with Michael Phillips (guitar), Jeff Rogers (drums) and Mort Bauman (bass guitar). The group toured the U.S. and released another single, \\"SVE\\", with the songs, \\"Wingdale,\\" \\"Top Dog,\\" and \\"Phantom\\". In 1983, while still living in Minneapolis/St. Paul, Vincent became involved with film-making and multimedia arts. The group made a film titled Mannequin World on the streets of Minneapolis. In 1984-1985, Vincent was involved in a performance art project that saw him banned from the grounds of the Minneapolis College of Art and Design. After the Extreme disbanded, Vincent went on to form other groups, such as Model Prisoners 1987-1989 (with a line-up including, Bob Stinson from the Replacements, Mike Henderson, and Jim Michels) and Shotgun Rationale 1989-1990, which had a revolving line-up that included, Mort Bauman, Mike Henderson, Stinson, Cheetah Chrome of the Dead Boys, and Greg Norton of H√ºsker D√º. During the early 1990s, Vincent and drummer Jeff Rogers relocated from Minneapolis to Los Angeles where they formed a band for a short time with Ernie Knapp on bass. Late career In the early 1990s, Vincent moved to the Netherlands. He formed a group, The Dons, with two Dutch musicians. Other line-ups during this period were Sonny Vincent and His Rat Race Choir, which included Scott Asheton, Cheetah Chrome, and Captain Sensible. In addition to releasing over 20 albums under his own name, Vincent toured and recorded for nine years with Maureen \\"Moe\\" Tucker of The Velvet Underground. During this time, although Vincent continued to record his own albums and tour his own show, he dedicated many years to Tucker. He recorded several albums with her and did many tours across the United States and Europe as her guitar player. Although the line-ups Tucker used often changed, Vincent and John Sluggett were permanent members. Having two original members of the Velvet Underground (Tucker and Morrison) and members of Testors (Vincent) and Half Japanese (Sluggett) brought new life to the band. Victor DeLorenzo of the Violent Femmes also briefly joined the band. After touring with Moe Tucker became less frequent, Vincent recorded a new album, Pure Filth, with drummer Scott Asheton of the Stooges and Captain Sensible of the Damned. After this release Vincent and Asheton, along with Steve Baise of the Devil Dogs, toured the United States and Europe playing songs from the album and from Vincent's catalog. Vincent has continued touring and playing his music for audiences in Europe and the United States. In 2012 Vincent formed Sonny Vincent and the Bad Reactions. The band toured the United States during the summer and recorded three songs, released by tREND iS dEAD! records on 7\\" vinyl. 2012 also saw Hozac records initiate the \\"Archive\\" branch of its label. The first release in this category was by Vincent's \\"Proto-Punk\\" band, Fury, recorded in 1972. In January 2020 Hozac records released a full length LP compiling unreleased tracks from three of Vincent's pre-Testors bands, Distance (1969-71), Fury (1972), and Liquid Diamonds (1973-75), as well as one of the earliest Testors demos from 1976.

The parish is on the county boundary with Oxfordshire. The River Evenlode forms the southwest boundary of the parish. The village is on a stream that flows southwest to join the river. The A436 road, which links the A44 road in Oxfordshire with Stow-on-the-Wold, passes through the parish just south of the village. The Cotswold Line railway passes along the Evenlode valley southwest of the village and until 1966 had a station here. Since 1935 the parish of Adlestrop has included the village of Daylesford. The 2011 Census recorded the parish population as 120. Archaeology About northeast of the village is a tumulus about long and wide. The tumulus is low, only high at one end and at the other. It is near the Iron Age hill fort in the adjoining Oxfordshire parish of Chastleton. Romano-British pottery and a coin of the usurper-emperor Allectus (died 296) have been found at the tumulus. The tumulus is a Scheduled Monument. Place-name The Domesday Book of 1086 records the place-name as Tedestrop. A Charter Roll of 1251 records it as Tatletrop and the Codex Diplomaticus Aevi Saxonici records it as Tatlestrop. The name is derived from the Old English √ærop for a village, combined with the name of a person called TƒÅtel or T«£tel. Manor King Coenred of Mercia is said to have granted the manor of Adlestrop to Evesham Abbey in AD 708. In the 10th century the manor was assessed at seven hides. The Abbey continued to hold the manor until 1540 when it surrendered all its estates to the Crown in the Dissolution of the Monasteries. In 1553 the Crown sold Adlestrop manor to Sir Thomas Leigh, who in 1558 was elected Lord Mayor of London. The manor descended in the Leigh family to Chandos Leigh (1791‚Äì1850), who in 1839 was created Baron Leigh. Adlestrop remained in the Leigh family in 1960. Adlestrop Park Adlestrop Park in 1818 In 1632 Sir William Leigh, grandson of Sir Thomas, died and left the manor to his son, also called William. The younger William chose to live at Adlestrop, and had a barn near the parish church converted into a manor house. In 1759‚Äì62 much of the house was demolished and rebuilt on a larger scale to designs by the Gothic Revival architect Sanderson Miller. Later Humphry Repton (1752‚Äì1818) remodelled the gardens. The house and garden are Grade II* listed. Parish church Inside the parish church of St Mary Magdalene, looking east The Church of England parish church of St Mary Magdalene is cruciform, with a chancel, nave, west tower and north and south transepts. The tower arch may be early 13th-century. The chancel arch is 13th- century but has been rebuilt. The tower is 14th-century. The church was rebuilt in about 1750, but the work was re-done in 1765, possibly by Sanderson Miller. The south transept is 18th-century Gothic Revival. The building was restored again in the early 1860s. =Bells= The west tower has a ring of six bells hung for change ringing. Until 2012 they were a ring of five. Abraham I Rudhall of Gloucester cast four of them including the treble in 1711. Thomas II Mears of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry cast the tenor bell in 1838. By about 1975 dry rot and woodworm had made the frame unsafe and the tenor bell was cracked, so the bells were listed as unringable. In 2015 the Whitechapel Bell Foundry re-cast the tenor and treble bells to make three new ones, increasing the ring from five to six. The frame was rebuilt, the bells re-hung and the ring of six was first rung in May 2016. Before the restoration the bells were: * Treble (smallest bell), note F: cast in 1711 by Abraham Rudhall * 2nd bell, note E: cast in 1711 by Abraham Rudhall * 3rd bell, note D: cast in 1711 by Abraham Rudhall * 4th bell, note C: cast in 1711 by Abraham Rudhall * Tenor (largest bell), note B flat (but cracked and toneless): cast in 1838 by Thomas Mears (Gloucester). Adlestrop House Adlestrop House, formerly the rectory Adlestrop House was built in the 17th century as the Rectory. It was altered in the 18th century and extended in the 19th and 20th centuries. Thomas Leigh, a member of the manorial family, was Rector of Adlestrop from 1762 until his death in 1813. A cousin of his was the mother of the novelist Jane Austen, who visited the then rectory at least three times between 1794 and 1806. She is thought to have drawn inspiration from the village and its surroundings for her novel Mansfield Park.Adlestrop, Gloucestershire at astoft2.co.uk Amenities Adlestrop has a post office and village shop that sells groceries and in the summer months serves teas. There is a village hall. Adlestrop Cricket Club plays at Adlestrop Park. Railway and former station Adlestrop bus shelter with the station sign In 1853 the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway was built along the Evenlode valley. A station was opened about southwest of Adlestrop village where the main road (now the A436) crosses the river. The station was called \\"Addlestrop\\" and Stow Road (note the double \\"D\\") until 1862, when it was shortened to \\"Addlestrop\\". The Great Western Railway took over the line in 1863 and changed the spelling to \\"Adlestrop\\" with a single \\"D\\" in 1883. British Railways closed the station in 1966 but the railway remains open. The nearest station is now at , about south of the Adlestrop. Adlestrop was immortalised by Edward Thomas's poem \\"Adlestrop\\", which was first published in 1917. The poem describes an uneventful journey that Thomas took on 24 June 1914 on the Oxford to Worcester express. The train made a scheduled stop at Adlestrop railway station, which the poet thought was unscheduled. He did not alight from the train, but describes a moment of calm pause in which \\"a blackbird sang close by, and... all the birds of Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire\\". One of the station signs and one of the benches that used to be on the station platform are now in the village bus shelter. A plaque on the bench quotes Thomas‚Äôs poem. These are all that remain of the former station. Site of Adlestrop railway station Adlestrop Yes. I remember Adlestrop The name, because one afternoon Of heat, the express-train drew up there Unwontedly. It was late June. The steam hissed. Someone cleared his throat. No one left and no one came On the bare platform. What I saw Was Adlestrop‚Äîonly the name And willows, willow-herb, and grass, And meadowsweet, and haycocks dry, No whit less still and lonely fair Than the high cloudlets in the sky. And for that minute a blackbird sang Close by, and round him, mistier, Farther and farther, all the birds Of Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire.

Prior to that it was called Berkeley Baptist Divinity School. History The earliest roots of Berkeley School of Theology lie in the chartering of California College, Vacaville, in 1871. In 1887 the college moved to Oakland, and in 1912 to Berkeley, at which time it changed its name to Berkeley Baptist Divinity School (BBDS), keeping this name until 1968. In 1915, BBDS merged with the Pacific Coast Baptist Theological Seminary, which had begun in Oakland in 1890 and had moved to Berkeley in 1904. In 1968, BBDS merged with California Baptist Theological Seminary (founded in 1944 in Los Angeles, and located in Covina since 1951). To reflect the fact that the school was no longer wholly in Berkeley, it was renamed the American Baptist Seminary of the West, but six years later the Covina faculty moved to the Berkeley campus, effecting considerable cost savings and at the same time availing themselves of the resources of the Graduate Theological Union.

Korean admiral Yi Sun-sin destroyed at least 47 Japanese ships, capturing 12. Yi's success in this battle became a turning point in Hideyoshi's first campaign. This battle is also the first in Admiral Yi's 3rd Naval Campaign. Prelude Admiral Yi Sun Shin, along with the small fleet of seven ships of Admiral Won Gyun, had fought two campaigns across the southern coast of Korea. For the third campaign, Yi Eok-gi joined with Yi Sun-sin at Yeosu on August 10 before rendezvousing with Won Gyun at Noryang on August 12. In all, the Koreans sank over 60 Japanese ships. Admiral Yi and the combined Korean fleet did not lose any ships and suffered only 11 killed and 26 wounded up to this point. Given the importance that the Japanese navy had in supplying the army as it advanced along the Korean peninsula and prepared to invade China, Toyotomi Hideyoshi made it absolutely imperative to his commanders that the naval situation must be brought under control, the Korean fleets destroyed, and the supply routes through the Yellow Sea secured. The Japanese commander, Wakizaka Yasuharu, was ordered to wait and combine his fleet with the forces of Kat≈ç Yoshiaki and Kuki Yoshitaka to seek out and destroy the Korean fleet. However, it would have taken some time for Kat≈ç and Kuki to assemble their ships, so Wakizaka went out alone with 73 ships. Wakizaka's fleet probably had the best warships fielded by the Japanese up to that point in the war. Out of the 73 ships, 36 were the large multi-decked atakebune, 24 the medium-sized seki bune, and 13 small kobaya scout ships. In the meantime, Admiral Yi was planning a third campaign and worked with Admirals Won and Yi Eok Ki in combined operations and practiced arranging their fleets in a \\"crane's wing\\" battle formation. The formation was often used on land, but not normally used at sea. The combined fleets had a total of 54 panokseons and 2 or 3 turtle ships. Battle =First phase= At Dangpo, Admiral Yi received intelligence from a local farmer that a large Japanese fleet (Wakizaka's ships) was making its way west towards him and was anchored north of the Gyeonnaeryang Strait, a narrow channel between Geoje Island and the mainland. On August 14, the next morning, Admiral Yi sent out six panokseon battle ships through the channel to lure out Wakizaka's fleet. Wakizaka took the bait and his ships chased Yi's six panokseons through the channel and into the broad open sea in front of Hansan Island. Wakizaka saw Admiral Yi's fleet before him and pressed to engage the Koreans. At that time, Admiral Yi began to arrange the fleet in the crane wing formation. Crane wing formation In the two previous campaigns, the Koreans had either met the Japanese ships in a straight battle line or, if space was limited, with a circular or rolling method of attack, where their ships attacked in relays to sustain a continuous bombardment. Although these tactics were effective, considerable numbers of Japanese had escaped and swum ashore. The crane wing formation, also known as the hagikjin (ÌïôÏùµÏßÑ), was designed to not just sink ships, but to annihilate the enemy without losing a lot of men. The formation itself resembled a \\"U\\" shape (thus the crane), with the heaviest battleships in the center and lighter ships on the wings. There was a turtle ship at the end of each side, anchoring the flanks. Reserves were placed behind the central ships and would plug gaps as the formation expanded. Ships at the front of the formation would face broadsides to maximize the number of cannons that would be aimed at the enemy. Furthermore, the \\"U\\" shape itself would allow for interlocking fields of fire so that many Japanese ships would be enfiladed and hit from several angles. In this sense the Crane Wing formation shared similarities with the late-19th- and early-20th-century battleship tactic of 'Crossing the T'. The Japanese tactic was to put their fastest ships in the vanguard to keep the Korean ships occupied, then move their larger ships rapidly to close in, grapple, and board the Korean ships. However, this tactic played right into Admiral Yi's plan, as the Japanese rowed deeper into the trap. The volume and range of Korean cannon fire prevented the Japanese from employing their favorite tactic and the two wings of the crane formation would envelop, surround, and finally have the effect of \\"crowding in\\" the Japanese ships, making it difficult to maneuver or retreat and \\"packing\\" in the ships and present an easier target for Korean cannons. =Second phase= Wakizaka Yasuharu was a highly aggressive commander and one of the legendary \\"Seven Spears of Shizugatake,\\" having gained fame in the battle that solidified Hideyoshi's claim to be Oda Nobunaga's successor. It is clear from his tactics in the Battle of Hansan Island that Wakizaka tried to get as close as possible to the Korean ships so he could have his men grapple and board them, which was a traditional Japanese naval tactic. Wakizaka not only followed the six decoy Korean ships through the Kyonnaeryang Strait with his entire fleet of 73 ships into the ambush, but pressed as quickly as possible into the center of the crane wing formation, oblivious to the fact that he was exposing his ships and his flanks to the Korean fleet's concentrated and longer-range firepower. The battle continued from the mid-morning to the late afternoon. Some boarding of Japanese ships by the Koreans did take place, but Admiral Yi only allowed it if the ship was already crippled and damaged. Wakisaka Yasuharu's commanders Wakizaka Sabei and Watanabe Shichi'emon were killed. Commander Manabe Samanosuke committed seppuku aboard his burning, sinking ship. Wakizaka Yasuharu himself was hit by several arrows, but none penetrated his armor. After losing 59 ships, Wakizaka abandoned his flagship and boarded a faster, lighter ship. He managed to withdraw to Gimhae. In total, 14 Japanese ships were able to retreat from the immediate area of the battle. However, many of the surviving ships were damaged so badly that they had to be abandoned in some of the surrounding islands that dotted the southern Korean coast. Only a few ships ever made it back to the Japanese base at Pusan Harbor. Aftermath Admiral Yi's victory at Hansan Island effectively ended Hideyoshi's dreams of conquering Ming China, which was his original goal in invading Korea. The supply routes through the Yellow Sea had to be open in order for his troops to have enough supplies and reinforcements to invade China. Thus, Konishi Yukinaga, the commander of the contingent of troops in Pyongyang could not move further north due to lack of supplies, nor could more troops be sent to him because there was not enough food to feed them. It took five times the resources in food and men to move supplies via the land route over Korea's primitive roads. Furthermore, moving supplies overland left them vulnerable to attacks by regular Chinese and Korean forces as well as Korean irregular or guerrilla forces (the Righteous Armies, ÏùòÎ≥ë, Áæ©ÂÖµ) that were becoming increasingly active as the war progressed. After the battle of Hansan Island (and the Battle of Angolpo shortly afterwards), Hideyoshi found it necessary to give a direct order to his naval commanders to cease all unnecessary naval operations and limit activity to the immediate area around Pusan Harbor. He told his commanders that he would come to Korea personally to lead the naval forces himself, but Hideyoshi was never able to carry through on this as his health was deteriorating rapidly. The battle of Hansan Island was the most important battle of the Imjin War. It ensured that all the fighting would be in Korea, not China, and that Pyongyang would be the furthest northwestern advance of the Japanese armies (to be sure, Kat≈ç Kiyomasa's second contingent's brief march into Manchuria was Japan's northernmost advance, however, Manchuria was not a part of Imperial China in the 16th century). It can be argued that the battle was one of the most important in Korean history up to that point. While Hideyoshi was unlikely to be able to invade China and conquer a large part of it, the battle of Hansan Island checked his supply routes and hindered his movements in Korea. Hideyoshi's larger war plans, supported in much written documentation, was nearly identical to Imperial Japan's blueprint for conquest in the second half of the 20th century. International recognition George Alexander Ballard (1862‚Äì1948), a vice admiral of British Royal Navy, complimented Admiral Yi's winning streaks by the Battle of Hansando highly: : \\"This was the great Korean admiral's crowning exploit. In the short space of six weeks [actually about 9 weeks, May 7, 1592 ‚Äì July 7, 1592] he had achieved a series of successes unsurpassed in the whole annals of maritime war, destroying the enemy's battle fleets, cutting his lines of communication, sweeping up his convoys, imperilling the situation of his victorious armies in the field, and bringing his ambitious schemes to utter ruin. Not even Nelson, Blake, or Jean Bart could have done more than this scarcely known representative of a small and cruelly oppressed nation; and it is to be regretted that his memory lingers nowhere outside his native land, for no impartial judge could deny him the right to be accounted among the born leaders of men.\\"The Influence of the Sea on The Political History of Japan, 57p References * Hawley, Samuel 2005 The Imjin War: Japan's Sixteenth-Century Invasion of Korea and Attempt to Conquer China.

Only two of the aircraft were ever built, both prototypes. Although these two planes went into service with the Navy, the Constitution design ultimately proved underpowered and too large for practical airline use at the time.

For instance, tunnels led through the thick wings to all four engines. The aircraft was designed by a team of engineers led by Willis Hawkins and W.A. Pulver of Lockheed and Commander E. L. Simpson, Jr. of the Navy. The name Constitution was given to the project by Lockheed president Robert E. Gross.Wainwright 2009, p. 60. The Constitution design had a \\"double bubble\\" fuselage, the cross section of which was a \\"figure eight\\". This unorthodox design, originally created in 1937 by Curtiss-Wright's chief aircraft designer George A. Page Jr. and first introduced with the Curtiss C-46 Commando, utilized the structural advantages of a cylinder for cabin pressurization, without the wasted space that would result from a single large cylinder of the same volume. The original contract from the Bureau of Aeronautics called for 50 Constitutions for a total price tag of $111,250,000. On VJ Day, however, the contract was scaled back to $27,000,000 for only two aircraft. Operational history =Ship No. 1= 1946 newsreel BuNo. 85163 at NAS Jacksonville in 1949 The first Constitution, BuNo 85163, was built in the summer of 1946 at the Lockheed plant in Burbank, California. Due to the aircraft's large size‚Äîthe tail towered ‚ÄîLockheed had to build a special hangar for final assembly. The hangar, Lockheed-California's Building 309, measured long, wide, and the equivalent of six stories tall. The footprint of the hangar covered . It cost $1,250,000. The R6O made its first flight on 9 November 1946, powered by interim 3,000 hp R-4360-18 radials.Wainwright 2009, p. 61 Joe Towle and Tony LeVier flew the aircraft on a leisurely course to Muroc Air Force Base.Wainwright 2009 pp. 60‚Äì61. Once there, the aircraft underwent a carefully documented test program. At this time, electronic data recording technology was not well developed, so instrument readings were recorded by a movie camera pointed at the instrument panel. Additional movie cameras were carried to record test results. The first Constitution made a nonstop flight from NAS Moffett Field, California to NAS Patuxent River, Maryland on 25 July 1948, a distance of . The pilot for the flight was Commander William Collins, USN and the copilots were Lieutenant Commander James W. Robinson, USN and Roy Wimmer, Lockheed engineering test pilot. Four days later, the ship was formally christened by Mrs. John L. Sullivan, wife of the Secretary of the Navy, at Washington National Airport.by daughter Marijane Robinson McBride who was at Lockheed the day actor Robert Montgomery gave the pilots a model of the USS Constitution sailing ship. The first test flights revealed that the aircraft was underpowered so the engines were changed for 3,500 hp (with water injection) R-4360-22-W engines. The R6O also tested assisted takeoffs with six rockets mounted on the wings near the fuselage. At full gross weight, the rockets shortened the takeoff run by 24%. Ship No. 1 was delivered to Navy Transport Squadron 44 (VR-44), based at Naval Air Station Alameda, on 2 February 1949. Both it and its sister ship, Ship No. 2 (which followed six months later), flew the route between California and Hawaii, approximately . =Ship No. 2= The two XR6V Constitutions in flight over San Francisco in 1950 The second Constitution, BuNo 85164, first flew on 9 June 1948, reaching 25,000 feet during a two-hour flight.United Press, \\"Lockheed Finishes Second Constitution\\", San Bernardino Daily Sun, San Bernardino, California, Tuesday 15 June 1948, Volume LIV, Number 248, page 1. Unlike Ship No. 1, the upper deck was fully furnished as a luxury passenger transport, with accommodations for 92 passengers and 12 crew. Accommodations on the upper deck of the first Constitution were decidedly more spartan. On the rear of the forward bulkhead, in front of the spiral staircase leading to the lower deck, there was a permanent display case containing a scale model of the original sailing ship. The lower deck had of cargo space, and it was loaded by an electrical hoist. The lower deck could also be converted to seat an additional 76 passengers. The second Constitution, like its predecessor, also made a non-stop transcontinental flight. On 3 February 1949, the aircraft flew 74 members of the press from Moffett Field to Washington National Airport. At the time, this was the largest number of people flown across the United States in a single flight. This flight inaugurated six months of regular service between Washington, D.C. and San Francisco. In 1949, Ship No. 2 made a Navy recruiting tour of 19 cities. The side of the fuselage proudly advertised \\"Your Navy‚ÄîAir And Sea.\\" Some 546,000 toured the aircraft's interior.Yenne 1987, p. 58. =Final disposition= The Constitution had operational difficulties which prevented it from meeting its original design objectives. The large airframe needed more power than the four Pratt & Whitney R-4360s could deliver, and the engines had cooling problems. While this could be compensated for by flying with engine cowl flaps partially open, it increased drag and decreased range. The Navy operated the two Constitutions through the end of the 1940s and into the 1950s. By 1949 the Navy announced that it could no longer afford to operate them, and offered them to airlines on a five-year lease. There was no interest from airlines in using the Constitutions (the airline version was named the Model 189), so the Navy retired both aircraft in 1953. They went into storage at NAS Litchfield Park, Arizona in 1955. Both aircraft and 13 spare engines were sold for $97,785. Lockheed proposed the Model 389 and Model 489 airliners based on the Constitution, which would have accommodated up to 169 passengers. Neither of these \\"paper\\" projects received much interest from civil operators. The first Constitution was brought to Las Vegas, where it served as an enormous billboard for Alamo Airways,\\"Constitution.\\" Goleta Air & Space Museum. Retrieved: 2 October 2011. before being scrapped by Howard Hughes when he acquired the property.Wainwright 2009, p. 64. The second Constitution was flown to Opa-Locka Airport, Florida, where it was damaged by an internal fire. It was stored on the airfield until the mid-1970s, then was towed to an empty lot several miles from the airport. There were plans to convert it to a restaurant and museum theme park. The project never materialized and the airplane was destroyed due to lack of funding and pressure from the city to have it removed.Frank Sosa-Last Owner of Constitution No.164, Opa-Locka Florida Operators ; *United States Navy VR-5 VR-44 Specifications (R6V BuNo 85164) 200px See also  Footnotes  References ;Notes ;Bibliography *Boyne, Walter J.

The most well-known contrade are probably the 17 contrade of Siena, whose representatives race on horseback in the Palio di Siena, run twice every year in July and August. Each is named after an animal or symbol, with a long history and complicated heraldic and semi-mythological associations. History In the summer, as excitement for the Palio builds, it is customary for members of the various contrade to dress in ceremonial garb and parade through the city in the Corteo Storico. The contrade districts were set up in the Middle Ages in order to supply troops to the many military companies that were hired to defend Siena as it fought to preserve its independence from Florence and other nearby city states. With the passage of time, however, the contrade have lost their administrative and military functions and have become areas of localised patriotism. The communities are held together by their histories, and the emotions and sense of civic pride of the residents. Their roles have broadened so that in the 21st century, every important event - baptisms, deaths, marriages, church holidays, victories at the Palio, even wine or food festivals - is celebrated only within one's own contrada. Every contrada has its own museum, church, fountain and baptismal font, motto, allied contrada (only Oca and Lupa have no allies) and adversary contrada, typically a neighbor (only four, Bruco, Drago, Giraffa and Selva, have no declared adversaries). Siena contrade =Aquila (Eagle)= 50px Aquila is situated immediately to the south-west of the Piazza del Campo in the centre of the city, and is home to the duomo (cathedral).

Its Sede is at Via del Comune, 44. Its patron Saint is the Madonna (Visitation of the Sainted Mary), and the Titulary feast is on 2 July. Its motto is \\"Come rivoluzion sona il mio nome\\" (As revolution sounds my name). It is allied to the Istrice, Nicchio and Torre contrade and not officially opposed to any other contrade.

Abolished contrade Originally 59 contrade were established, taking on functions like a clan in a tribal society. Consolidation over the centuries as needs changed has resulted in the number being reduced to 17 in the early 21st century. During the seventeenth century, some contrade were slowly dying out before their abolition, which took place officially in 1729. These districts were Gallo (Rooster), Leone (Lion), Orso (Bear), Quercia (Oak), Spadaforte (Strong Sword), and Vipera (Viper). The Corteo Storico Parade for the memory of the Abolished Contrade The representatives of Oak, Spadaforte and Viper parade in the Corteo Storico The abolition of six quarters has always been surrounded by uncertainty. The deletion is traditionally traced to disorders related to the Palio of 1675. Some sources say that Contrada Spadaforte (with support of five other Contrade), despite the victory of Lupa, claimed the victory for itself. According to others, Spadaforte was forbidden to compete in the Palio, it can not rely on its actual influence area.ilpalio.org The six \\"rebel\\" districts were therefore deleted. This tradition is not supported by contemporary records. The abolition came about because of poor organization among the contrade and their lack of participation in the larger public life of the city. This is discussed in the book of Balia.ilpalio.org The six quarters were officially abolished by the edict issued by Violante Beatrice of Bavaria (known as Notice of Violante of Bavaria) in 1729. It defined the boundaries of the New Division of Contrade, which are still valid. The six were incorporated into other contrade as follows; * Gallo was incorporated into Civetta, Oca, and Selva. * Leone was incorporated into Istrice. * Orso was incorporated into Civetta. * Quercia was incorporated into Chiocciola. * Spadaforte was incorporated into Leocorno and Torre. * Vipera was incorporated into Torre. Today the six abolished contrade are remembered in the historical procession preceding the Palio di Siena: six riders with their helmets lowered, accompanied by a groom, parade in the ninth group of the Corteo Storico Historical Parade.

Character history Julia is Sean McNamara's (Dylan Walsh) wife of 17 years, with the couple divorcing for the last time in season four. She has three children: Matt (John Hensley), Annie (Kelsey Lyn Batalaan) and Connor. =Season One= Housewife Julia McNamara's life is already in freefall, dissatisfied with her marriage to plastic surgeon Sean McNamara, and in love with his partner Christian Troy (Julian McMahon), with whom she had a one-night stand in college. Due to her unhappiness, Julia flushes her daughter Annie's gerbil down the toilet, and tries to instigate an affair with Christian. Julia returns to college in an effort to finish her doctorate and meets a fellow student named Jude (Phillip Rhys). Julia discovers his attraction to her, and uses it to make Sean jealous. Their friendship ends when Julia discovers that Jude is a professional gigolo who targets middle-aged housewives. Julia drops out of college, and later rallies against her housewife friends when they try and bar Sofia Lopez, a trans woman, from their women-only gym. At the end of the season, Julia decides to get a paternity test done on Matt. =Season Two= Julia's narcissistic mother, Erica Noughton (Vanessa Redgrave), comes to Miami and proceeds to degrade her and make her feel worthless for not becoming a doctor. Their already fragile relationship is made even worse when Erica sleeps with Christian. Meanwhile, Julia finds she can only orgasm with Sean when thinking about Christian. After Christian loses baby Wilber in the custody battle, Julia reveals to him that he already has a son: Matt. Thanks to lifecoach Ava Moore (Famke Janssen), Matt soon discovers the truth as well. When Julia reveals the truth to Sean, he pushs Julia against the freezer and throws her out of the house. Moving into a small apartment which Erica unsurprisingly mocks, Julia self-destructs, gets a boob job and starts to drink heavily. One drinking binge results in an accident where she falls through a glass door. While undergoing surgery to repair her face and remove her implants, Julia is guided through an alternate universe by Ava, where she sees what her life would be like if she married Christian. While she is a rich, successful plastic surgeon, she is also a cocaine addict, unable to have children, and unfulfilled by Christian. An attempt to seduce a happily married Sean also goes awry. Coming out of her dream, Julia admits that she is never satisfied with what she has, always wondering how life would be on the other side. However, she realizes that she would be much more unhappy with Christian, than with Sean. Despite remaining problems between her and Sean, they reconnect when Julia requires saving after being attacked by a kinky blind date, and later team up in an effort to protect Matt from his potentially dangerous lover, Ava. =Season Three= Still single, Julia has decided to resort to sleeping with Jude. She also asks Sean for a divorce. In an effort to bring some purpose to her life, Julia teams up with Gina Russo (Jessalyn Gilsig) to create and develop De La Mer, a luxury spa. She also poaches anesthesiologist Liz Cruz (Roma Maffia) from McNamara/Troy, and the three of them create a signature face cream made of semen which they market to Joan Rivers. While running the spa, Julia is romanced by Sean and Christian's new colleague, bisexual doctor Quentin Costa (Bruno Campos), who goes to work for her. After discovering his affair with a male soldier, Julia dumps and fires him. After a tumultuous argument with her mother, Julia is shocked to discover that the plane Erica was supposed to board has crashed just after take-off. Julia joins Sean and Christian in helping the many injured victims, and finds a horrifically burned woman who she believes is her mother. Putting her out of her misery, Julia suffocates the woman, later confessing to Sean that she feels free. Returning home, Julia is shocked to discover her mother waiting for her, claiming that she delayed her flight due to their argument. Soon after, Julia discovers she is pregnant with Sean's child, the result of a brief sexual encounter earlier in the year. A terrifying nightmare provokes Julia into getting her unborn baby checked for any deformities. =Season Four= Julia reveals to Sean that their unborn child is suffering from ectrodactyly, a congenital malformation of the hands. The baby, named Conor, is born but the decision on whether he should undergo plastic surgery creates friction between them. Finding herself yet again dissatisfied with her life despite renewing her wedding vows with Sean, Julia starts an affair with Conor's dwarf nanny Marlowe Sawyer. As she falls deeper in love with Marlowe, she plans to leave for Florence with him, Annie and Conor. However, Julia eventually decides against this, instead leaving Marlowe to live with her mother in New York City, taking Annie and Connor. =Season Five= Julia visits Los Angeles and reveals to Sean and Christian that she is in a relationship with a woman, Olivia Lord (Portia de Rossi). Olivia encourages Julia to sleep with Christian one last time to \\"get him out of her system\\", which she does. After Annie bonds with Olivia's teenage daughter Eden (AnnaLynne McCord) and expresses a desire to go to school with her, Julia permanently moves to the city. Annie and Eden's friendship results in Sean and Julia clashing over Eden's dangerous influence, which results in Annie performing sexual acts on a classmate and worrying about her body image. Julia initially ignores Sean's worry, after Olivia blames Sean's profession for making Annie act out. After a violent encounter with a carjacker, Julia purchases a gun and initiates an affair with Christian. She also threatens Eden after discovering her relationship with Sean. Enraged, Eden begins poisoning Julia with mercury-laced fruitcake. Julia's mystery illness tears apart her affair with Christian, and Julia finally realizes that she was not in love with him, but instead in love with a fantasy of him. Olivia returns to Los Angeles, and helps Julia discover that she has mercury poisoning. Julia works out that she had been poisoned through eating the fruitcake and confronts Eden. In desperation Eden uses Julia's gun to shoot her in the head. Julia is rushed to hospital where she is diagnosed with having retrograde amnesia. Visiting her bedside, Sean tells her that he is her husband, and that their family has never been happier. Four months later, Julia has been made aware of Sean's lie and is slowly regaining her memory yet cannot remember the night of her shooting. Julia's relationship with Olivia is ended when Olivia dies on the operating table, having failed to tell Sean and Christian that she was secretly using prescription medication. Olivia is cremated. Eden tells Julia that Olivia had been taking anti-depressants due to accidentally shooting Julia in a drunken rage, believing her to be an intruder. Julia believes Eden's story, though Eden throws Olivia's ashes in her face. Despite Olivia's death, Julia continues to live in New York with Annie and Conor. =Season Six= Julia returns to Los Angeles when Matt is arrested for a series of robberies. Soon after, Julia's mother, Erica, arrives and announces that she is petitioning for custody of Annie and Conor, believing Sean and Julia are not capable parents. During this time, Julia and Sean sleep together, but their romantic reunion is short-lived. At the same time, Sean proposes a plan to frame Erica's new husband Renaldo for cocaine possession. Julia vetoes the idea. Later, Erica gives up on her decision to seek custody of her grandchildren after accidentally endangering Annie's welfare. As Erica prepares to leave, Julia plants the cocaine originally intended for Renaldo on her mother, and Erica is arrested by police while boarding the plane to leave Los Angeles. Following her mother's arrest, Julia returns to New York with Annie and Conor. Julia arrives in Los Angeles in preparation for Matt's wedding, and immediately reveals to Sean and Christian that she is engaged to a wealthy older man named Edmond, who resides in London. Therefore, she is planning on moving to the country with Annie and Conor, angering Sean. Later, Christian makes a move on Julia while they're at a bar, but Julia stops him from going any further. She explains that while she fantasized about him repeatedly when she was with Sean, there is no longer any electricity between them. Soon after, Julia rejects a similar advance from Sean, even after he suggests they both move to New York and start afresh as a family once again. Eventually, Sean gives his legal permission for Julia to leave the country with the kids. Before leaving, Julia confides in Christian that she is worried about Sean, especially as she knows he isn't happy working at McNamara/Troy and is in denial about his true feelings. Julia tells Sean and Christian that it will feel like a day hasn't gone by when they all meet up again, and leaves for London with the kids. =Reduction in appearances= By 2010, Julia's role in the series had greatly diminished compared to the importance of her character when the show first began, a result of actress Joely Richardson's contracts with the series. In 2006, mid-way through the filming of the series' fourth season, Richardson announced that she wished to leave the series for an indefinite period of time to take care of her then ailing daughter. FX agreed to accommodate the request, and Julia was written out. In 2007, and with her daughter's health improved, Richardson renegotiated her contract with the series, agreeing to appear in 13 of the 22-episode fifth season. In fall 2008, further contract negotiations occurred,Nip/Tuckers Hope to Carve Out Pay Raise with Richardson agreeing to appear in 5 of the 19-episode sixth season, completing filming in June 2009.

He is king of a region of Mongo called Arboria. Barin becomes one of Flash's best friends, and is deeply in love with Princess Aura. In his appearance, Barin resembles the character of Robin Hood. Barin appears regularly in the Flash Gordon comic strip, becoming the ruler of Mongo after Ming's overthrow. In other media Prince Barin was first portrayed by Richard Alexander in the 1936 Flash Gordon film serial. He reprised the same role in the 1938 sequel Flash Gordon's Trip to Mars. In the 1940 sequel Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe, the role was portrayed by Roland Drew. Alan Oppenheimer provided the voice of Prince Barin in the 1979 Filmation animated series. Barin was depicted as a master archer, armed with arrows encasing any item they strike in ice. His fortress city in Arboria is highly advanced, and almost equal in technology to Mingo City. The city is protected by a defensive energy shield and by squadrons of formidable airships called Leaf Fighters. Barin also makes use of a gigantic tank-like drilling machine called the Mecha-Mole. In 1980, Prince Barin was portrayed by Timothy Dalton in the film Flash Gordon produced by Dino De Laurentiis. The prince becomes the heir to the throne of Mongo, but evil Ming the Merciless steals the throne. Barin is banished to the forest moon of Arboria. He is in love with Ming's daughter, Princess Aura, and she decides to hide Flash there after saving him from execution. Jealous of Aura's love for Flash he tries to kill him, but they are captured by Hawkmen and forced to fight. After Flash saves Barin from falling to his death during the fight, the Prince becomes an ally. He is sentenced to execution by Ming with Zarkov, but Aura frees them. The prince eventually joins forces with Flash Gordon, Dale Arden, Dr. Hans Zarkov and Prince Vultan of the Hawkmen in order to overthrow Ming, and at the end he becomes Mongo's apparent ruler, and makes Vultan the leader of his armies. Steve Bacic portrayed Prince Barin in the 2007 Flash Gordon television series. Although Ming plans a union between Barin and Aura at one point, the two despise each other and the wedding is called off following an assassination attempt by Barin on Ming. Barin is then saved from execution when Flash organizes a fake prophecy to imply that killing Barin would jeopardize Ming's rule.

While many of the same characters and plot twists are maintained, a few smaller occurrences are left out. Filmed under communist Chinese censorship, some portions of Clavell's story were considered too offensive to be filmed as written and considerable changes were made. The De Laurentiis Entertainment Group handled the production and were actively seen battling the Chinese Government and Labor boards over the film during shooting. The results fared poorly at the box office and in critical reviews. Duke believed that a mini-series √† la Sh≈çgun or Noble House would have been a far superior means of covering the complexity of Clavell's novel. Plot The film begins in 1842, following the British victory of the First Opium War and the seizure of Hong Kong. Although the island is largely uninhabited and the terrain unfriendly, it has a large port that both the British government and various trading companies believe will be useful for the import of merchandise to be traded on mainland China, a highly lucrative market. Although the film features many characters, it is arguably Dirk Struan and Tyler Brock, former shipmates and the owners of two massive (fictional) trading companies who are the main focal points of the story. Their rocky and often abusive relationship as seamen initiated an intense amount of competitive tension. Throughout, both men seek to destroy each other in matters of business and personal affairs. Struan is referred to as tai-pan (which author Clavell translates as \\"Supreme Leader\\", although this is not the accepted translation of the term) indicating his position as head of the largest and most profitable of all the trading companies operating in Asia. Brock, owner of the second largest of the trading companies, constantly vies to destroy Struan's company and reputation in an attempt to both exact revenge on Struan and become the new \\"Tai-Pan\\" of Chinese trade. While the film follows a similar structure as the novel, one major and notable event is left out. Struan's meeting with Jin Qua early in the film to obtain the forty lac dollars of silver to pay Brock omits Jin Qua's stipulation that four special coins be broken in half, with Struan keeping four halves and the other four being distributed by Jin Qua. When a half coin is presented to Struan that matches his own half, he is obligated to do a favor to the bearer. The first favor is called in later in the novel, by the pirate Wu Kwok. The film does not convey this.

Clavell would write the script and co-produce. (At the time Clavell was also working as a filmmaker, directing Sidney Poitier in To Sir, with Love.) Patrick McGoohan was announced to play Dirk Struan (the first of a two-picture deal he had with MGM) with Michael Anderson attached to direct. Carlo Ponti came in as co-producer. However the movie would have cost an estimated $26 million (later reduced to $20 million) and was postponed. It lingered on for a number of years before being finally cancelled when James T. Aubrey took over as president and cancelled the project. =Late 1970s proposed version= In 1975 it was announced Run Run Shaw had bought the rights from MGM and would collaborate with Universal Studios to make a $12 million film. Carl Foreman wrote a screenplay. However no film was made. In the late 1970s Georges-Alain Vuille obtained the rights and George MacDonald Fraser was hired to adapt the novel. Fraser's script met with approval ‚Äì Vuille hired him to write a sequel ‚Äì Richard Fleischer was attached to direct, and Steve McQueen agreed to star for a reported fee of $3 million. McQueen dropped out of the project but was still paid $1 million. Roger Moore became briefly attached, with John Guillermin mentioned as director of a possible mini series. However finance could not be arranged. \\"If it's offered to me again I'll do it\\", said Moore. \\"Quite frankly, it's one of the best scripts I've ever read.\\" For a time Sean Connery was mooted as star for director Martin Ritt. \\"I've always wanted Sean to do it\\", said Clavell. Vuille eventually lost the rights and Fraser's script was not used in the final film.George MacDonald Fraser, The Light's On at Signpost, HarperCollins 2002 p198-212 =Dino De Laurentiis= The popularity of the novel and TV series of Shogun made Tai Pan continually attractive to filmmakers. In late 1983 it was announced Dino De Laurentiis had the rights. He set up the film with Orion. Sean Connery turned down the lead role. The film was directed by Daryl Duke and starred Bryan Brown, who had worked together on The Thorn Birds. It was the first English-language movie shot in China. Shooting was extremely difficult, due in part to abundant red tape. De Laurentiis later claimed filming in China was a big mistake. Reception The film gained poor reviews. Walter Goodman of The New York Times said of it, \\"You have to say this for Tai-Pan: it's ridiculous ‚Äì but in a big way. It's two hours of Super Comics: Bearded Brutes! Busty Belles! Bloody Blades! Exotic Settings! Colorful Costumes! A Beheading! A Castration! A Typhoon!\\" Roger Ebert called it \\"the embodiment of those old movie posters where the title is hewn from solid rock and tiny figures scale it with cannons strapped to their backs, while the bosoms of their women heave in the foreground. [...] Of the women of 'Tai- Pan,' it can be said that Joan Collins could have played each and every one of them at some point in her career.\\" The Los Angeles Times' Kevin Thomas said, \\"anyone who enjoyed James Clavell's epic novel of the early China traders can only wish that it had never arrived. So truly and consistently terrible is 'Tai-Pan' that it could stand as a textbook example of how not to adapt a historical adventure-romance into a movie.\\" Chen was nominated for two Golden Raspberry Award as Worst Actress and Worst New Star. =Box office= The film was not a box office success. \\"I haven't seen the film\\", said Clavell in 1986. \\"It just hasn't been convenient for me to see it... I would like to get the rights to my book back and turn it into a mini-series.\\" References External links  * Tai Pan Film article Category:1986 films Category:1980s adventure drama films Category:American films Category:American adventure drama films Category:English-language films Category:Films based on American novels Category:Films based on works by James Clavell Category:Films directed by Daryl Duke Category:Films set in 1842 Category:Films set in Hong Kong Category:Films produced by Raffaella De Laurentiis Category:De Laurentiis Entertainment Group films Category:Asian Saga Category:First Opium War Category:1986 drama films ","title":"Tai-Pan (film)"},{"id":"2617063","text":"Circa 1905 Madison Julius Cawein (March 23, 1865 ‚Äì December 8, 1914) was a poet from Louisville, Kentucky.

Thus as a child, Cawein became acquainted with and developed a love for local nature. After graduating from high school, Cawein worked in a pool hall in Louisville as a cashier in Waddill's New-market, which also served as a gambling house.Perkins, David.

A History of Modern Poetry: From the 1890s to the High Modernist Mode. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1976: 384. He soon earned the nickname the \\"Keats of Kentucky\\".Ellis, William E. The Kentucky River. The University Press of Kentucky, 2000: 153. He was popular enough that, by 1900, he told the Louisville Courier-Journal that his income from publishing poetry in magazines amounted to about $100 a month.Perkins, David. A History of Modern Poetry: From the 1890s to the High Modernist Mode. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1976: 98. In 1912 Cawein was forced to sell his Old Louisville home, St James Court (a -story brick house built in 1901, which he had purchased in 1907), as well as some of his library, after losing money in the 1912 stock market crash. In 1914 the Authors Club of New York City placed him on their relief list. He died on December 8 later that year and was buried in Cave Hill Cemetery. Influence In 1913, a year before his death, Cawein published a poem called \\"Waste Land\\" in a Chicago magazine which included Ezra Pound as an editor. Scholars have identified this poem as an inspiration to T. S. Eliot's poem The Waste Land, published in 1922 and considered the birth of modernism in poetry.Hitchens, Christopher. Unacknowledged Legislation: Writers in the Public Sphere. New York: Verso, 2001: 297. The link between his work and Eliot's was pointed out by Canadian academic Robert Ian Scott in The Times Literary Supplement in 1995. The following year Bevis Hillier drew more comparisons in The Spectator (London) with other poems by Cawein; he compared Cawein's lines \\"...come and go/Around its ancient portico\\" with Eliot's \\"...come and go/talking of Michelangelo.\\" Cawein's \\"Waste Land\\" appeared in the January 1913 issue of Chicago magazine Poetry (which also contained an article by Ezra Pound on London poets). Cawein's poetry allied his love of nature with a devotion to earlier English and European literature, mythology, and classical allusion. This certainly encompassed much of T. S. Eliot's own interest, but whereas Eliot was also seeking a modern language and form, Cawein strove to maintain a traditional approach. Although he gained an international reputation, he has been eclipsed as the genre of poetry in which he worked became increasingly outmoded. Works =Volumes of poetry= *Blooms of the Berry, J. P.

He was killed during the Boxer Rebellion. Early life Ketteler was born at M√ºnster in western Germany on 22 November 1853 into a noble M√ºnsterland family. He was the son of C√§cilie von Luck und Witten (1822‚Äì1908) and August Joseph von Ketteler (1808‚Äì1853), who died shortly before his birth. His uncle, Wilhelm Emmanuel Freiherr von Ketteler, was a theologian and Zentrum politician who served as Bishop of Mainz. His nephew, the diplomat Wilhelm Freiherr von Ketteler, was murdered by the Sicherheitsdienst des Reichsf√ºhrers SS (SD) in Vienna in 1938 for his opposition to Hitler. Another relative was the French marshal Louis Franchet d'Esp√®rey. A cousin, Marguerite Watson, was married to Prince Charles Philippe, Duke of Nemours (son of Prince Emmanuel, Duke of Vend√¥me). Career Following his graduation in M√ºnster and Coesfeld in 1873, Ketteler entered the Prussian Army and served in it until he was appointed to join the Imperial German diplomatic corps in 1882. Between 1880 and 1889 he served as an interpreter in the German consulates in Canton (Guangzhou) and Tientsin. After working in the German Department of Foreign Affairs for a short period, he was posted to Washington, D.C., between 1892 and 1896 and then to Mexico from 1896 to 1899. =German Minister to China= Dongdan from 1903 to 1918. The stone archway erected by the Chinese government (Qing) at the time to commemorate Baron von Kettler, killed during the Yihetuan Movement in 1900 after being moved to Zhongshan Park. Ketteler returned to China in 1899 as Plenipotentiary at Beijing, from where he pointed out in vain the dangerous situation for the Europeans. On 12 June 1900, when the Boxers moved to the inner city and burned down Christian church buildings, Ketteler reacted by ordering German embassy guards to hunt them down. On 18 June, German troops captured a Chinese civilian suspected of being a Boxer in the inner city and took him to the Legation Quarter, where he was detained. On 17 June, the Chinese Muslim Kansu Braves mounted an assault on Ketteler and his German Marines at the Legations. After stones were hurled at the Germans by the Chinese Muslims, Ketteler told his men to shoot back at Muslim forces. The Muslim troops were feared by the Westerners, so the British minister Sir Claude Macdonald warned that \\"When our own troops arrive we may with safety assume a different tone, but it is hardly wise now.\\" He thus warned Ketteler about his shooting incident with the Muslim army. Ketteler flogged a Chinese who appeared to be a Boxer, and beat a boy who was with him after taking him to the Legations. Ketteler then shot him dead. In response, thousands of Chinese Muslim Kansu Braves under General Dong Fuxiang of the Imperial Army and Boxers went on a riot. The Kansu braves and Boxers then attacked and killed Chinese Christians around the legations in revenge for foreign attacks on Chinese. Angry at the Chinese Christians for collaborating with foreigners who were murdering Chinese, the Boxers burned some of them alive and attacked and ransacked their property. Some Muslims also assassinated the secretary of the Japanese legation, Sugiyama Akira, tearing him apart. At 8.00 a.m. on 20 June, Ketteler, together with his interpreter and other associates, headed for the Zongli Yamen (the Ministry of Foreign Affairs) accompanied by armed escorts. At the western end of Xizongbu Hutong, only one block away from the ministry, the party was intercepted by a cart with what appeared to be Chinese Imperial lancers, though another source states they were Manchu Hushenying bannerman. One of them approached Ketteler's palanquin and shot Ketteler at point blank range. Ketteler was specifically targeted by the Manchu captain En Hai for assassination, in revenge for Ketteler having murdered the boy. En Hai later gave himself up to the Allied occupying forces. He was subsequently tried and convicted, and was executed in Beijing on 31 December 1900 by beheading. He showed no emotion during interrogation, and was fully composed and calm, admitting to killing Ketteler, and even requested execution, saying \\"I received orders from my sergeant to kill every foreigner that came up the street...I am glad to die for having killed one of the enemies of my country.\\" When questioned about whether he had consumed alcohol during the incident, En Hai said he had not \\"touched a drop\\". En Hai was praised as \\"brave and dignified\\", and called a \\"hero\\". Ketteler was succeeded by Dr. Alfons Mumm von Schwarzenstein as ambassador of the German Empire in Beijing, who signed the Boxer Protocol on behalf of Germany. After his death, his widow returned to America to be with her family. Personal life On 24 February 1897, he was married to the American heiress Matilda Cass Ledyard (1871‚Äì1960) in Detroit. Matilda, a descendant of the Livingston and the Schuyler family, was the daughter of Mary (n√©e L'Hommedieu) Ledyard and Henry Brockholst Ledyard Jr., president of the Michigan Central Railroad and the Union Trust Company.\\"Ledyard Given Quiet Funeral,\\" Detroit Free Press, May 28, 1921, pg. 11. Her paternal grandfather was Henry Ledyard, a former mayor of Detroit, and her uncle, Lewis Cass Ledyard, was the personal lawyer of J. Pierpont Morgan. After returning to her family in America after his death, his widow, who never remarried, later lived at a villa in Florence, Italy, before leaving shortly before World War II. In 1938, she bought a 90 acre estate in Canaan, Connecticut where she died in 1960. =The Ketteler memorial in Beijing= After China's loss to the Eight-Nation Alliance in 1901, treaties were signed between China and eleven nations (the Eight Nations plus Spain, Belgium and the Netherlands). Prince Chun, father of the last emperor Puyi, travelled to Germany in his official capacity as ambassador extraordinary to express the regrets of the Guangxu Emperor over the death of Ketteler to Kaiser Wilhelm II. A paifang or \\"memorial gate\\" called the Ketteler Memorial (German: Ketteler-Denkmal) was erected at the location where he fell. Work on this gate began on 25 June 1901 and was completed on 8 January 1903. On 13 November 1918, two days after Germany signed an armistice with the Allies, the Ketteler Memorial was officially abolished. The following year, the gate was moved to the present-day Zhongshan Park and renamed \\"The Victory of Justice Gate\\" (). In 1953, on the occasion of the Asia-Pacific Peace Conference in Beijing, it was renamed once again as \\"The Protection of Peace Gate\\".

The word Ghrneshwara means \\"lord of compassion\\". The temple is an important pilgrimage site in the Shaiva tradition of Hinduism, which considers it as the last or twelfth Jyotirlinga (linga of light). This pilgrimage site is located in Ellora (also called Verul), less than a kilometer from Ellora Caves ‚Äì a UNESCO World Heritage site. It is about north-west of the city of Aurangabad, and about east- northeast from Mumbai. The temple structure was destroyed by the Delhi Sultanate in 13th and 14th-century. The temple went through several rounds of rebuilding followed by re-destruction during the Mughal-Maratha conflict. It was rebuilt in the current form in the 18th century under the sponsorship of queen Ahilyabai Holkar of Indore, after the fall of the Mughal Empire. It is presently an important and active pilgrimage site of the Hindus and attracts long lines of devotees daily. Anyone can enter the temple premises and its inner chambers, but to enter the sanctum sanctorum core (garbha-ghrya) of the temple, the local Hindu tradition demands that men must go bare-chested. Grishneshwar Shiva temple is next to the Ellora Caves. The Grishneswar temple is an illustration of south Indian temple architectural style and structure. The temple, built of red rocks, is composed of a five-tier shikara. The temple was re-constructed by Maloji Bhosale of Verul, (grandfather of Shivaji) in the 16th century and later again by queen Ahilyabai Holkar in the 18th century. She is credited with rebuilding some of major Hindu temples such as the Kashi Vishvanath temple in Varanasi, a Vishnu temple in Gaya, and a much larger Shiva Jyotirlinga temple in Somnath Temple. This 240 ft x 185 ft temple is the smallest Jyotirlinga temple in India. Halfway up the temple, Dashavataras of Vishnu are carved in red stone. A court hall is built on 24 pillars.

Gilchrest's reputation as a moderate Republican built up his popularity and he was overwhelmingly re- elected in this conservative, Eastern Shore-based district. District 2 thumb In this heavily-gerrymandered and relatively liberal district, incumbent Democratic Congressman Dutch Ruppersberger faced no serious threat from Republican candidate Jimmy Mathis. Ruppersberger won a third term in this district that includes small parts of Baltimore and some of the Baltimore metropolitan area in a landslide. District 3 thumb Incumbent Democratic Congressman Ben Cardin declined to seek an eleventh term so that he could run for Senate. John Sarbanes, the son of retiring Senator Paul Sarbanes and an attorney, won a crowded Democratic primary and became the Democratic nominee. Annapolis marketing executive John White was the Republican nominee, and, true to the liberal nature of this district based in the Baltimore metropolitan area, Sarbanes beat White. District 4 thumb In this district, which has a majority African-American population and is based in Prince George's County and Montgomery County, is heavily liberal. Incumbent Democratic Congressman Al Wynn survived a tough primary challenge from lawyer Donna Edwards, and since the Democratic primary is tantamount to election, Wynn was the heavy favorite to win the general election, which he ultimately did. District 5 thumb House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, who has served in Congress since he was elected in a 1981 special election to fill the seat previously held by Gladys Spellman, did not face a Republican opponent in this election. Hoyer's election to his fourteenth term was never in doubt, however, seeing as this district, based in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area and southern Maryland, is heavily liberal. Hoyer beat out Green Party candidate Steve Warner and Constitution Party candidate Peter Kuhnert to win another term in Congress. District 6 thumb This district, based in the heavily conservative Maryland panhandle and the moderately conservative northern suburbs of Baltimore, has sent incumbent Republican Congressman Roscoe Bartlett back to Washington with solid margins of re-election, and this year proved no different. Congressman Bartlett faced United States Army veteran Andrew J. Duck in the general election, and though he ultimately beat Duck out, it was by a thinner margin than usual. District 7 thumb Incumbent Democratic Congressman Elijah Cummings, who has represented this heavily liberal district based in Baltimore, Baltimore County and Howard County since previous Congressman Kweisi Mfume resigned in 1996. This year, the popular Cummings did not face any opponent of any kind in the general election and he coasted to a seventh term. District 8 thumb Democratic Congressman Chris Van Hollen, considered by many to be a rising star in the Democratic Party, has represented this staunchly liberal district based in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area since his initial election in 2002. Van Hollen faced no serious threat to his bid for a third term from Republican Jeffrey Stein or Green Party candidate Gerard Giblin, and he crushed both of them in the general election.

Elizabeth Fackelman, Ed. Edward Peters, (University of Pennsylvania Press, 1999), 91. He had already been given Saint-Pol and Ligny as an appanage on the death of his grandfather, Waleran III of Luxembourg, Count of Ligny, in 1415 at the Battle of Agincourt. He commanded the Burgundian forces occupying Paris in 1419, but he returned to Brabant in 1420, where the populace complained of his brother's misadministration. He was then declared ruwaard (regent) of Brabant. In 1421, he was reconciled with his brother and resigned the regency. The citizens were pacified by John's \\"Nieuw Regiment\\" in 1422. During his own reign, Philip was forced to grant concessions to the nobility in 1428. Wary of the rise of his cousin and heir Philip the Good in the Hook and Cod wars, he sought a marital alliance with Louis II, Duke of Anjou, against Burgundy, marrying his daughter Yolande of Anjou. Because this marriage produced no children, his death in 1430 placed Brabant in the hands of his cousin Philip the Good, the next heir, whilst Saint-Pol and Ligny went to his great-aunt, Joan of Luxembourg, by proximity of blood.Willem Pieter Blockmans and Walter Prevenier, The Promised Lands: The Low Countries Under Burgundian Rule, 1369-1530, 91. His wife Yolande was placed in the guardianship of Philip the Good, until she remarried in 1431 to Francis I, Duke of Brittany.

Founded in 1964, it is the third oldest comprehensive high school in the Antelope Valley Union High School District. Campus The basic layout of Quartz Hill High School's campus is a courtyard surrounded by several quads and athletic buildings, a design that is typical of high schools in Southern California. The school's campus was originally designed for 1,800 students, but over two times that number are currently enrolled. In the school year 2008-2009, there is a reported number of over 3000 students now attending the school, some being foreign exchange students. From the summer of 2003 to the fall of 2004, Quartz Hill High School's campus underwent a $15 million modernization that updated a majority of the school's classrooms. Student body Quartz Hill High School consists of approximately 3,200 students and growing.

The men's cross country team is known as the most successful and most accomplished sports programs in the past ten years at Quartz Hill. Under the helm of Head Coach Matthew Bierowicz, the Quartz Hill cross country team has risen to one of the most prominent and dominant cross country programs in all of California. In 2015, boys' volleyball went undefeated in league play. The team competed in the CIF Southern Section playoffs where they went to the finals. Teams began interscholastic competition in the mid-1960s. The mascot of Quartz Hill High School was formerly the Rebel, a Confederate soldier, beginning in the late 1950s. On June 18, 2020, school district administrators announced that the Rebel mascot and name would no longer be used by the school. The change came during a wave of protests in the wake of the killing of George Floyd. A new mascot will be selected by the school's students and staff. Planned school attack On December 15, 2005, two former Quartz Hill students were arrested for planning a Columbine style massacre at the school. The two youths allegedly intended to attack the school on February 14, 2006. News reports described them as goths and indicated that they had accumulated knives, ammunition, a gas mask and bomb-making instructions. They were charged on December 19, 2005 with conspiracy to commit murder. Tensions flared again on January 13, 2006, when a rumor that the former students who had been arrested would again attempt to attack the school using pipe-bombs. According to Principal Mark Bryant, the planned attacks were merely \\"rumor, upon rumor, upon rumor.\\" This \\"Friday the 13th\\" rumor was passed between students via internet messages and cell-phone text messages. In response to the threat, nearly 50% of the student body was absent from the campus by the time the school day had finished. In the end, the only disruption to the day was a firecracker explosion within a trash can during the school's lunch break.

Biography Born in Brighouse Farm Borgue near Kirkcudbright, Scotland, he arrived on Vancouver Island in 1860, where he helped to found the first sawmill in Port Alberni, British Columbia. On 24 July. 1863 he was made a justice of the peace for the Colony of Vancouver Island. When the sawmill burnt down in 1865, Sproat returned to England, but maintained his interest in the affairs of the colony, which was united with the mainland in 1866. Sproat's fascination with the First Nations people he encountered on Vancouver Island, led to his best remembered book, The Nootka:Scenes and studies of savage life, which appeared in 1868. In 1870 he wrote Education of the Rural Poor which argued for the extension of elementary education to all, including agricultural laborers. Following British Columbia's entry into Canadian Confederation in 1871, Sproat became the new province's agent general in London, a position he held from 1872 until his return to the province in 1876. Beginning in 1883, Sproat began travelling to the Interior of British Columbia, especially to the Kootenay region, where he held several regional offices. After 1898, Sproat returned to Victoria, where he spent the majority of his time writing. He died there on 4 June 1913.

The eastern portion of Loudoun would retain its name and county government. Purcellville would become the seat of the new county's government.

Early life and education Born in Cedar Rapids, Iowa Baron and his mother moved to Smithville, Texas when he was fifteen. A high school football player, he continued his education at the University of Texas at Austin. Then he attended the University of Texas School of Law, where he was an editor of the law review. Career Baron was one of the founders of Baron & Budd, P.C., a Dallas, Texas law firm and a former president of the Association of Trial Lawyers of America. Fred Baron sold his interest in Baron & Budd and retired from the firm in December 2002.http://www.bizjournals.com/dallas/stories/2008/10/27/daily60.html His former firm has become one of the largest firms in the country representing victims of toxic and chemical exposure particularly claims of asbestos exposure. As a young lawyer in 1975, Baron became a pioneer in the application of strict liability causes of action in asbestos litigation using the then- recently adopted Restatement Second of Torts Section 402a.https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2008-11-19/pdf/CREC-2008-11-19-pt1-PgE2262.pdf He represented workers and widows of deceased workers at Pittsburg Corning's Tyler, Texas plant.\\"Outrageous Misconduct: The Asbestos Industry on Trial\\", Paul Brodeur, 1985, Pantheon Books, NY One academic estimated that Baron & Budd, along with Ness Motley, was one of two firms responsible for half of the hundreds of thousands of asbestos litigation claimants in the country.Samuel Issacharoff, ‚Äò‚ÄòShocked‚Äô‚Äô: Mass Torts and Aggregate Asbestos Litigation After Amchem and Ortiz, 80 Tex. L. Rev. 1925, 1930 (2002). Baron convinced the United States Supreme Court to de-certify nationwide asbestos class action settlements involving future claims of people who are not yet ill, but who may later develop asbestos-related illnesses. The decertification addressed the problem that asbestos-related illnesses like pleural mesothelioma (a fatal cancer of the lining of the lung) or peritoneal mesothelioma (a similar cancer of the lining of the abdomen), have a latency period of 20‚Äì40 years from the date of exposure. In 1985, Baron reached a $20 million (some argue $45 million after payments with interest are included over a 30-year period) agreement with RSR Corporation for one of the largest community lead contamination cases ever. In the mainly impoverished and minority community of West Dallas, he represented 370 children and some 40 property owners. Most clients resided in the West Dallas public housing complex that was located directly in the path of the prevailing southerly winds that had blown lead particles released in the air by RSR Corp. into the lives of the children in the neighborhood. The case did not however make it all the way through the court systems. The actual agreement came in an out-of-court settlement with Baron and RSR Corp. The children benefiting from Barons work receive interest included periodical payments over a 30-year period. In 2002, Baron left Baron & Budd along with his wife, Lisa Blue.

Charcuterie is part of the garde manger chef's repertoire. Originally intended as a way to preserve meat before the advent of refrigeration, they are prepared today for their flavors derived from the preservation processes.Ruhlman, 19. Terminology The French word for a person who practices charcuterie is , generally translated as \\"pork butcher\\". This has led to the mistaken belief that charcuterie can only involve pork. The Food Lover's Companion, however, says, \\"it refers to the products, particularly (but not limited to) pork specialties such as , etc., which are made and sold in a delicatessen-style shop, also called a charcuterie.\\" The 1961 edition of Larousse Gastronomique defines it as \\"[t]he art of preparing various meats, in particular pork, in order to present them in the most diverse ways.\\" History A modern charcuterie display In the first century AD, Strabo recorded the import of salted meat from GaulJane Grigson Charcuterie and French Pork Cookery and the Romans may have been the first to regulate the trade of charcuterie as they wrote laws regulating the proper production of pork joints, but the French have also had some influence. In 15th-century France, local guilds regulated tradesmen in the food production industry in each city. The guilds that produced charcuterie were those of the . The members of this guild produced a traditional range of cooked or salted and dried meats, which varied, sometimes distinctively, from region to region. The only \\"raw\\" meat the were allowed to sell was unrendered lard. The prepared numerous items, including p√¢t√©s, rillettes, sausages, bacon, trotters, and head cheese (brawn). These preservation methods ensured the meats would have longer shelf lives. Charcuterie became symbolic then to lower status peasantry. Products created with forcemeats =Forcemeat= Forcemeat is a mixture of ground, lean meat emulsified with fat. The emulsification can be accomplished by grinding, sieving, or pur√©eing the ingredients. The emulsification may either be smooth or coarse in texture, depending on the desired consistency of the final product. Forcemeats are used in the production of numerous items found in charcuterie. Meats commonly used in the production of forcemeats include pork, fish (pike, trout, or salmon), seafood, game meats (venison, boar, or rabbit), poultry, game birds, veal, and pork livers. Pork fatback is often used for the fat portion of forcemeat, as it has a somewhat neutral flavor.The Culinary Institute of America, 299. In US usage, there are four basic styles of forcemeat. Straight forcemeats are produced by progressively grinding equal parts pork and pork fat with a third dominant meat which can be pork or another meat. The proteins are cubed and then seasoned, cured, rested, ground and then placed into desired vessel. Country- style forcemeats are a combination of pork, pork fat (often with the addition of pork liver) and garnish ingredients. The finished product has a coarse texture. The third style is gratin, which has a portion of the main protein browned; the French term connotes a \\"grated\\" product that is browned. The final style is mousseline, which are very light in texture using lean cuts of meat usually from veal, poultry, fish, or shellfish. The resulting texture comes from the addition of eggs and cream to this forcemeat. =Sausage= Sausage making The word sausage is derived through French from the Latin , as the sausage-making technique involves placing ground or chopped meat along with salt into a tube. The tubes can vary, but the more common animal-derived tubes include sheep, hog, or cattle intestinal linings. Additionally, animal stomachs and bladders, as well as edible artificial casings produced from collagen and inedible plant cellulose or paper are also used. Inedible casings are primarily used to shape, store, and age the sausage.McGee, 169‚Äì170. The two main variants of sausage are fresh and cooked. Fresh sausages involve the production of raw meat placed into casings to be cooked at a later time, whereas cooked sausages are heated during production and are ready to eat at the end of production.McGee, 170. Emulsified sausage Emulsified sausages are cooked sausages with a very fine texture, using the combination of pork, beef, or poultry with fat, salt, cure, flavorings, and water. These ingredients are emulsified at high speed in a food processor or blender. During this process, the salt dissolves the muscle proteins, which helps to suspend the fat molecules. Temperature is an important part of the process: if the temperature rises above 60 ¬∞F (16 ¬∞C) for pork or 70 ¬∞F (21 ¬∞C) for beef, the emulsion will not hold and fat will leak from the sausage during the cooking process. =P√¢t√©, terrine, galantine, roulade= Various p√¢t√©s and terrines P√¢t√© and terrines are often cooked in a pastry crust or an earthenware container. Both the earthenware container and the dish itself are called a terrine. P√¢t√© and terrine are very similar: The term p√¢t√© often suggests a finer-textured forcemeat using liver, whereas terrines are more often made of a coarser forcemeat. The meat is chopped or ground, along with heavy seasoning, which may include fat and aromatics. The seasoning is important, as they will generally be served cold, which mutes the flavors.McGee, 172. The mixture is placed into a lined mold, covered, and cooked in a water bath to control the temperature, which will keep the forcemeat from separating, as the water bath slows the heating process of the terrine. P√¢t√© and terrine are generally cooked to 160 ¬∞F (71 ¬∞C), while terrine made of foie gras are generally cooked to an internal temperature of 120 ¬∞F (59 ¬∞C). After the proper temperature is reached, the terrine is removed from the oven and placed into a cooling unit topped with a weight to compact the contents of the terrine. It is then allowed to rest for several days to allow the flavors to blend. Duck galantine Galantine is a chilled poultry product created after the French Revolution by the chef to the Marquis de Brancas. The term galant connotes urbane sophistication. Other origins are suggested: the older French word for chicken g√©line or galine or the word gelatin. Sources suggest the spelling of gelatin transformed into the words galentyne, galyntyne, galandyne, and galendine. The galantine is prepared by skinning and boning a chicken or other poultry. The skin is laid flat, with the pounded breast laid on top. A forcemeat is then placed on top of the pounded breast. The galantine is then rolled with the ends of the breast meeting one another. The galantine is then wrapped in cheesecloth and poached in poultry stock until the proper internal temperature is reached.The Culinary Institute of America, 317‚Äì318. Roulade is similar to a galantine. The two major differences are instead of rolling the poultry evenly for the ends of the breasts to meet, the bird is rolled into a pinwheel shape, and the roulade is cooled by chilling it after it has been removed from the poaching liquid. Salt-cured and brined products Homemade charcuterie & cheese board, containing salt-cured and brined meats Salt serves four main purposes in the preservation of food in the charcuterie kitchen. The first is inducing osmosis: This process involves the movement of water outside of the membranes of the cells, which in turn reabsorb the salted water back into the cell. This process assists in the destruction of harmful pathogens. The second is dehydration, which means the salt pulls excess water from the protein, which aids in the shelf life of the protein, as there is less moisture present for bacterial growth. Fermentation is the third, in which salt assists in halting the fermentation process which would otherwise completely break the meat down. Finally, salt assists in denaturing proteins, which in essence means the structure of the proteins is effectively shifted, similar to the effects of cooking.The Culinary Institute of America, 190‚Äì191. Before the discovery of nitrates and nitrites by German chemists around 1900, curing was done with unrefined salt and saltpeter. As saltpeter gives inconsistent results in preventing bacterial growth, nitrate and nitrite (in the forms of sodium nitrite and sodium nitrate) have increased in popularity for their consistent results. Nitrates take a considerably longer period of time to break down in cured foods than nitrites. Because of this, nitrates are the preferred curing salts for lengthy curing and drying periods. Nitrites are often used in foods that require a shorter curing time and are used for any item that will be fully cooked.The Culinary Institute of America, 191. Eventually, a portion of the nitrates will be converted into nitritesMcGee, 173. by bacterial action. Nitrite has multiple purposes in the curing process. One purpose is flavor, the nitrites giving a sharp, piquant flavor to the meat. Second, the nitrites react with substances in the meat to produce nitric oxide. Nitric oxide prevents iron from breaking down the fat in the meat, thus halting rancidity. The binding also creates the characteristic reddish color found in most cured meat. Finally, the nitrite inhibits the growth of botulism-causing organisms that would ordinarily thrive in the oxygen-deprived environment in the sausage casing. German scientists originally named botulism poisoning (\\"sausage poisoning\\"). The term ' derives its name from the Latin term for sausage.McGee, 174. Eating cured and processed meat products has been linked to a small increase in gastric cancer, as well as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and colorectal cancer. \\"What is processed meat? - BBC News\\". 2015-10-26. Retrieved 2015-11-19. The negative effects are presumed to be caused by nitrates and nitrites, as well as nitrosamines which are formed by nitrites reacting with meat. These risks are generally regarded as minimal, and regulations in the United States limit ingoing nitrites to 156 parts per million (0.0156%) (less for bacon) as a precautionary measure. =Curing salt blends= Two main types of curing salt mixture are used by the charcutier. The first is known by multiple names, including \\"tinted cure mix\\", \\"pink cure\\", \\"prague powder\\", or \\"insta-cure #1\\". The mixture is 93.75% sodium chloride and 6.25% sodium nitrite. When used, the recommended amount is a ratio of 4 oz for each 100 lb (1 kg for each 400 kg) of meat or 0.25% of the total weight of the meat. This blend is colored bright pink to keep the charcutier from confusing the mixture with regular salt.The Culinary Institute of America, 192. The second curing salt blend is called \\"prague powder II\\" or \\"insta-cure #2\\". Also colored pink to differentiate it from table salt, it contains 6.25% sodium nitrite, 4% sodium nitrate, and 89.75% table salt. This mixture is used for dry sausages that require a longer drying period which requires the presence of nitrate. =Seasoning and flavoring agents= Sweeteners and other flavoring agents are necessary in the production of many cured products due to the harsh flavors of the salt. A number of sweeteners can be used in curing foods, including dextrose, sugar, corn syrup, honey, and maple syrup. Dextrose is seen often in cured meat, as it not only mellows the harshness, but it also increases the moisture content of the cured product while adding less sweetness to the cured meat. The sweeteners also assist in stabilizing the colors in meat and help the fermentation process by giving a nutrient to the bacteria.The Culinary Institute of America, 193. Numerous spices and herbs are used in the curing process to assist with the flavor of the final product. The sweet spices regularly used include cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, mace, and cardamom. Other flavoring agents may include dried and fresh chilies, wine, fruit juice, or vinegar. =Fermented sausage= saucisson Fermented sausages are created by salting chopped or ground meat to remove moisture, while allowing beneficial bacteria to break down sugars into flavorful molecules. Bacteria, including Lactobacillus species and Leuconostoc species, break down these sugars to produce lactic acid, which not only affects the flavor of the sausage, but also lowers the pH from 6.0 to 4.5‚Äì5.0, preventing the growth of bacteria that could spoil the sausage. These effects are magnified during the drying process, as the salt and acidity are concentrated as moisture is extracted.  See also   * * Notes References * The Culinary Institute of America.

Adlingfleet is a drained, fertile, former marshland village in the East Riding of Yorkshire, England, that forms part of the civil parish of Twin Rivers. It is east-southeast of Goole town centre. Its sea wall along the far north-east is set back from the Ouse estuary leaving the largest single reedbed in England. Geography Adlingfleet is on a minor road set back from the final, southern bank of the Ouse estuary. From Goole the road passes Swinefleet, Reedness, Whitgift and Ousefleet before turning to the south by Blacktoft Sands RSPB reserve to reach the village. The road continues southwards, to Fockerby and Garthorpe, all in similar multiple-drains fields. The boundary between the East Riding of Yorkshire and North Lincolnshire comes to a point south of the village centre. It weaves such as along the eastern edge of the housing, then runs east to reach the Trent estuary. At its north-eastern tip are mud banks, short of Trent Falls, where Trent and the Ouse meet - forming the Humber.Ordnance Survey, 1:25000 map, 2006 All of the surrounding land is low- lying and flat. It is protected from flooding by sea walls along the banks of: the Trent to the east; and the Ouse to the north. To north and north east the sea wall is set back, leaving to nature the largest tidal reedbed in England. This is managed by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. It is a haven for wildlife. Before the drainage schemes of the 18th century, much more of the area was saltmarsh, leaving soils with varying pH and high concentrations of metals, including ochre. History The village was written as \\"Adelingesfliet\\" in the Domesday Book. From this we know before the Conquest the lord of the manor was Siward Barn; after, as at 1086, Geoffrey de la Guerche. \\"Documents Online: Adlingfleet\\", Folio: 326r, 379v, Great Domesday Book; The National Archives.

All Saints Church, Adlingfleet The parish church of All Saints is a Grade I listed building. The building has a cruciform plan, with a nave, a chancel, a south aisle, north and south transepts, and a square tower at the west end. Much of it is 13th century, with some re-used 12th-century doors. The aisle and tower were built in the 15th century, and various amendments were made in 1792-94, in 1828 and in 1955-57\\\\. Internally, the building contains monuments including a very fine knight effigy, to a Haldenby, who died in 1596. At south is a raised platform for the remains of a rectory, dating from the mid-13th century. It is grade II* listed, and was constructed of ashlar and coursed rubble by John le Franceys, who was Adlingfleet's rector and also a king's counsellor. The remains, which have not had a roof since the 1970s, and the platform on which they stand, are a scheduled ancient monument, as there are thought to be the remains of other structures below the surface. West is the old vicarage, built by Tyson in 1796. Red-brick modifications were made in 1835-37 by Erskine Neal. The original structure is in yellow-brown brick. Adlingfleet Drainage Adlingfleet Level is of principally former marshland south west of the Trent-Ouse-Humber confluence. In 1764, landowners contacted the civil engineer John Smeaton, who drew up proposals for a drainage scheme. This formed the basis for an Act of Parliament, which the landowners obtained in March 1767. The Act authorised Drainage Commissioners to be appointed, and they asked Smeaton's colleague, John Grundy, Jr., to act as engineer for the project. David Buffery was the resident engineer and Charles Tate the land surveyor. Grundy made few changes to Smeaton's plans. By July, he had drawn the plans and specifications for the sluice which would connect the main drain to the Trent, and work began on it in August. A contract for the excavation of the main drain was awarded to James Pinkerton and John Dyson in October. This was the first known civil engineering contract for both men, but they went on to work together on a number of schemes, including the Driffield Navigation and the Laneham Drainage project, and seem to have acted as management contractors, organising and supplying labour to these schemes. By April 1769, all the major elements of the project had been completed, and the project had cost around ¬£7,000 (). The Commissioners retained Buffery, to ensure that some remaining minor works were completed to a satisfactory standard. On 13 June 1903 the Commissioners asked J Simmons, an engineer from Doncaster, to estimate the cost of a pumping plant, which would be built at the head of the drain. He produced plans and drawings, liaising with suppliers to obtain costings for the pumps. The engine house would have been with a boiler house which was wide. He submitted the scheme to the Commissioners at a meeting in Goole on 30 June, but they decided that it was too costly, and so he produced a revised scheme, which included a chimney at the engine house. The cost was estimated at ¬£1,452, and another meeting at Goole on 15 July asked him to obtain formal tenders for the engine and pump house. However, the scheme was again considered to be too costly, and the Commissioners wrote to Simmons on 29 July to tell him that it had been cancelled. He invoiced them for 2.5% of the estimate cost, plus travelling expenses, which amounted to ¬£37 1s (¬£37.05).Doncaster Archive Service, Document DY/SIM/3/2 Following a half- yearly meeting on 10 May 1904, they wrote to say they were willing to pay 10 guineas (¬£10.50).Doncaster Archive Service, Document DY/SIM/3/4 =1927 Upgrade= After periodic flooding in the 1920s, a survey was made, indicating that the fall on the main drain was around 2 inches per mile (30 mm per km), which was not sufficient for good drainage by gravity. Based on the premise that a pumping scheme had an annual cost for running and maintenance, whereas lowering the cill was essentially a one-time cost, the Commissioners of the Adlingfleet and Whitgift Drainage Board asked for tenders for a new sluice in December 1926. The cill would be lower than the existing one, and the contract was for construction of the sluice and work on the drain itself, to make it wider and deeper. Near the sluice, the channel would be wide at the top, wide at the bottom and deep. Decreasing sizes were specified for six sections over its length, with the final section being wide at the bottom and only deep. Various bridges would need their foundations lowered and other improvements to be made, while Gill's Close bridge was to be dismantled and not replaced. The previous sluice was wide, built of masonry, and was in an unstable condition by this time. The new one would be wide, with wing walls making the entire structure wide. It would be long, and the cill would be below the highest tide level. Construction would be of reinforced concrete, and the sluice would be built slightly to the north of the existing one, so that it could be completed without interrupting the discharge from the drain. Eleven quotations were received, and the contract was awarded to H. Arnold and Son of Doncaster on 15 February 1927, whose estimate was for ¬£13,847. Having built the sluice structure, a new channel was excavated by mechanical excavator, to connect it to the existing drain. On the river side, the new channel was dredged by the Aire and Calder Navigation Company and covered with stone. They had the necessary plant to complete this part of the work. The benefits were expounded by Simmons, the engineers for the work, in an article which appeared in The Concrete Way in 1929, where he stated that following the work, the water levels in winter were several inches below the normal summer levels. In August 1932 Simmons produced a specification for sluice doors to be installed at Willowbank bridge,Doncaster Archive Service, Document DY/SIM/3/16 but they were not installed. =Current state= The outlet sluice into the River Trent A sluice with pumps was eventually built to the north of Cowlane bridge in Adlingfleet.Ordnance Survey, 1:2500 map, 1969 The control building carries the date 1984 on a large stone built into the walls. Construction of a sewage treatment works next to the sluice was well advanced in 2011. The bridges at Hoggards Lane, Cowlane and Willowbank have been replaced by corrugated steel tubes, backfilled up to the level of the road surface. Mains bridge is still a single arched brick structure, while at the end of the drain, Whinsgate bridge consists of the main brick arch under the A161 road, with arches in both wing walls, which enable tracks to cross Dodds Dyke and Eastoft Drain. The southern track over Eastoft Drain was formerly the course of the Fockerby Branch of the Axholme Joint Railway until its closure in 1965. At the outfall, the pointed gates have gone, replaced by a circular opening through a massed concrete infill, with a flap gate on the outlet side, and a vertical lifting steel gate on the inland side. Responsibility for the drain changed in 2005, when the Adlingfleet and Whitgift Drainage Commissioners amalgamated with five other Internal Drainage Boards, to become part of the Isle of Axholme Internal Drainage Board. It changed again on 1 April 2011, when the new body amalgamated with three more Internal Drainage Boards to become the Isle of Axholme and North Nottinghamshire Water Level Management Board. =Eels= The presence of barriers across waterways has been identified as one of the factors behind the decline in eel populations, and following new regulations introduced in 2009, a study was carried out to assess which catchments bordering the Humber could provide suitable habitat for eels. Those with pumps were eliminated, but eight waterways were identified as possible candidates for the fitting of eel passes to aid eel migration. On Adlingfleet drain, the entrance sluice acted as a barrier, and there was a second barrier at the sluice and pumping station by Cowlane Bridge. Although rectification was deemed to be difficult, the drain was ranked fourth in a list of tributaries that could support the migration of eels and other migratory fish. By May 2011, an innovative fish-flap had been fitted, which does not compromise the flood protection, but allows fish to pass at certain states of the tide.

The school is a teacher training school in connection with Manchester Metropolitan University in Manchester. History The school opened as Bramhall County Grammar School on Seal Road in 1967 as a co-educational three- form entry grammar school. It became The Bramhall County High School in 1971 with a ten-form entry with a sixth form. New buildings were added to prepare for the comprehensive intake. Until April 1974 it was administered by Cheshire Education Committee. By 1973 it had a 12-form entry with around 1400 boys and girls. With the new LEA of Stockport, it became known as Bramhall High School in 1974. In 1975 it was a 9-form entry school with around 300 in the sixth form, and again was 12-form entry in 1980. Similar to Marple Hall School in Marple, the sixth form was closed in the early 1990s. Since the introduction of Academies under the educational reforms of Michael Gove a few secondary schools in Stockport have opened Sixth Form centres. Bramhall High School have started the consultation process into opening a sixth form at the school, with the view of opening in September 2015. Press The school came under the spotlight in 2002, when they asked parents of pupils to pay ¬£10 per annum to help following cuts in funding from Stockport Education Authority under the Labour government. The school was initially criticised after the installation of unisex toilets in 2000, as a move to tackle bullying and smoking. Subsequently, this development has become accepted Government policy, and the school features on the 'Bog Standard' website, was selected as a case study in good design by the Design Council and in 2007 was the subject of a follow-up documentary for the BBC Breakfast Programme. The unisex toilets were segregated again in August 2013. The school also was the focus of critical news headlines after it introduced sniffer dogs to search the school premises for traces of illegal drugs. In March 2007, the school was in the news after banning traditional knotted ties from the school uniform and replacing them with clip-on ties. A spokesperson for the school later declared that the move to introduce clip-on ties was \\"more about student appearance than health and safety\\". OFSTED Report An OFSTED inspection in 2014 rated the school as \\"Requires improvement\\" in all categories. Following the previous OFSTED inspection (2010) the school had been described as \\"a good and improving school with some outstanding features.\\" Academic performance The percentage of students gaining the top grades has reached the highest ever at 79.4%.

The species is endemic to South America. It is the most common species of horned frog, in the grasslands of Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil. A voracious eater, it will attempt to swallow anything that moves close to its wide mouth, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and other frogs, even if this predator would suffocate in the process. It is also kept as an exotic pet. The nickname \\"pacman frog\\" is a reference to the popular 1980's arcade game Pac-Man, where Pac-Man himself eats quite a lot, and has a mouth that takes up most of its body, much like the Argentine horned frog. right Description The females of C. ornata can grow to be 16.5 centimeters (6.5 inches) snout to vent (SV) and the males 11.5 centimeters (4.5 in) SV. The average lifespan is 6 to 7 years, however they can live up to 10 years or more in captivity.Argentinian Horned Frog (Pacman Frog) (Ceratophrys ornata) Common Frog Species A horned frog's most prominent feature is its mouth, which accounts for roughly half of the animal's overall size. Coloration is typically bright green with red markings, though dark green, parti-color black and albino versions also exist. Sexing this species is very difficult before sexual maturity is reached. Dimorphism traits between the two sexes are size difference and males possessing dark pigmented throats and nuptial pads on the forelimbs. Feeding An Argentine horned frog All horned frogs, species of the genus Ceratophrys, hunt by remaining motionless, and waiting for prey. They will try to eat anything that can fit in their mouths, and some things that can't. In the wild, their typical diet would include rodents such as mice, small reptiles, as well as large spiders, and insects such as locusts. Horned frogs are well known for their fearless reputation. They will attempt to consume animals, sometimes even the size of themselves. If threatened by a larger animal such as a human, these frogs can deliver a painful bite as they have several odontoid projections (not teeth per se) along their bottom and top jaws. Sometimes they will even jump towards their attacker, no matter their size and power. However, in captivity these frogs' natural diet is fairly easy to recreate. When kept as a pet, the horned frogs are usually fed mainly on large adult locusts, black and brown crickets, and mice; they also enjoy ‚Äì depending on size ‚Äì live fish. However, studies have proven primarily feeding a horned frog mice causes fat build-up, which often results in blindness and death. Reproduction Argentine horned frogs reproduce sexually. The Argentine horned frog's females deposit about 2,000 eggs in water and within two weeks they become tadpoles.

One is a optical telescope, equipped with a CCD for observations in visible light and an infrared detector used for infrared astronomy. The other is a radio dish used for an undergraduate radio astronomy course. The observatory has been used to perform professional astronomy research, such as orbit determination of small solar system bodies in the early 1900s and supernova surveys in the 1980s and 1990s. It has also served as a primary tool in the education of graduate and undergraduate students at UC Berkeley. History Plaque at the site of the original Students' Observatory The Students' Observatory was constructed in 1886 on the Berkeley campus, with the original funds provided by the California legislature in order for the observatory to provide practical training to civil engineers. Very quickly, the Students' Observatory became seen as a training ground for students studying astronomy, so that they would be better prepared to go on to use the facilities at Lick Observatory. This contributed to the separation of the departments of civil engineering and astronomy in the mid-1890s, with the Students' Observatory becoming the home of the Berkeley Astronomy Department. In 1898, Armin Otto Leuschner was appointed the director of the Students' Observatory, a post that he held until his retirement in 1938. During this time, \\"the observatory became a center for the computation of the orbits of comets, minor planets, and satellites.\\" Astronomer Simon Newcomb said that Leuschner organized the department and observatory into \\"a thorough school of astronomy, than which [...] there is none better.\\" After he stepped down, the observatory was directed by a series of well regarded astronomers, including Otto Struve from 1950‚Äì59 and Louis G. Henyey from 1959‚Äì64. The Students' Observatory was renamed Leuschner Observatory by the Regents of the University of California in 1951 in honor of A. O. Leuschner. The Space Sciences Lab, which operates SETI, began operations in 1960 at Leuschner Observatory until a permanent home in the Berkeley hills was completed in 1966. In 1965, the observatory was relocated a short distance east of the Berkeley campus in the hills of Lafayette, California, on the Russell Reservation. In 1968, the observatory was equipped with a new Ritchey-Chretien telescope built by Tinsley Laboratories. Since, the observatory has been used as a testing ground for a variety of experiments and instruments. The predecessor to the Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope was tested at Leuschner Observatory in the early 1990s, and in the early 2000s, the first prototype of the telescopes used at the Allen Telescope Array was unveiled at Leuschner. Leuschner Observatory's telescope continues to be regularly used in undergraduate astronomical instruction, while the telescope was decommissioned and is in disrepair. In 2012, the physics and astronomy department of San Francisco State University bought into the telescope. SF State and UC Berkeley staff jointly refurbished and upgraded the motors and control system of the larger telescope; SF State also installed a remote observing station based in its frequently fog-laden San Francisco campus. Instruments Rapid Prototype Array at Leuschner Observatory. =Optical/infrared= Leuschner Observatory houses two optical telescopes, one with a diameter and the other with a diameter. As of 2010, the telescope is not usable, and the telescope is undergoing upgrades. The telescope is of Ritchey-Chretien design, and is equipped with both a charge coupled device (CCD) for observations in visible light and an infrared detector that was fabricated in 2000 in order to create an infrared laboratory course for undergraduate students at UC Berkeley. Both optical telescopes are also outfitted with control systems which allow them be automated, meaning observations are made with minimal human intervention. =Radio= Leuschner Observatory is home to a single radio telescope. The telescope was one of the prototypes for the Allen Telescope Array that were tested at Leuschner, and has since been used in the undergraduate radio astronomy lab. The telescope operates between 1320‚Äì1740 MHz and uses an 8192 element spectrometer with spectral resolution of about 1.5 kHz and a 12 MHz bandwidth. The operating range allows for it to be used to observe the 21-cm hydrogen line as well as hydroxyl lines from astrophysical masers. Research and discoveries =Orbit determination= Research at the Students' Observatory under A. O. Leuschner was primarily focused on performing astrometry in order to determine orbits for newly discovered comets. When Clyde Tombaugh reported the discovery of Pluto in 1930, Leuschner began observing it using the instruments at Students' Observatory to determine its orbit. Within months of its discovery, Leuschner cast the first doubt on Pluto's status as a planet, suggesting instead that it was unclear whether Pluto was a large asteroid, a planet, or a comet. Using a few weeks of observation at the Students' Observatory, he and his students Fred Whipple and E. C. Bower determined the orbital elements for Pluto and an upper limit of one half the mass of Earth. This mass meant Pluto was insufficiently massive to be the Planet X thought to cause discrepancies between the predicted and observed orbit of Neptune. =Supernova= The observatory was for a time home to two automated supernova surveys. The Berkeley Automated Supernova Search, led by Saul Perlmutter, who went on to head the Supernova Cosmology Project, used the telescope at Leuschner to scan the skies nightly for supernova. The Leuschner Observatory Supernova Search (LOSS) began in 1992, as the Berkeley Automated Imaging Telescope (BAIT) also searched for supernova, in this case under Alex Filippenko. Both were used as testing grounds for automated searches at other sites, with BAIT eventually being succeeded by the Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope located at Lick Observatory. While LOSS operated at Leuschner, it discovered SN 1992bt, SN 1993G, SN 1993R, SN 1993X, SN 1993Z, SN 1994D, and SN 1994ae. The telescope was also used as part of a program called Hands-On Universe that allows elementary and high school students to request observations on the telescope. In late March 1994, two high school students in Oil City, Pennsylvania, requested observations of the Whirlpool Galaxy. When astronomers discovered SN 1994I in the Whirlpool Galaxy a few days later, they realized that the observations made with the telescope at Leuschner had captured the earliest images of the supernova. Even more, the images provided astronomers some of \\"earliest supernovae light curve data on record.\\" =SETI= Leuschner Observatory is also home to an optical SETI experiment, carried out under the direction of UC Berkeley astronomer Dan Werthimer. The program consists of a targeted search for bright pulses of short duration around 2500 nearby stars using the automated telescope. Similar efforts are carried out at Lick Observatory using the Nickel telescope. The first optical probe SETI study was also conducted at Leuschner in 1979 . =Maffei 1 and 2= In 1968, Italian astronomer Paolo Maffei reported observing two strange objects. A graduate student at Berkeley used the telescope at Leuschner Observatory to make the first identification of the two objects as being elliptical galaxies. Once it was known what they were, the two objects were named Maffei 1 and Maffei 2 after their discover. In identifying the nature of the objects, astronomers realized they were very nearby objects, perhaps even belonging to the Local Group. While eventually membership in the Local Group was ruled out, Maffei 1 is now recognized as being the nearest major elliptical galaxy. =Nemesis= In 1984, paleontologists David M. Raup and Jack Sepkoski suggested that extinction events on Earth followed a periodic trend. Richard Muller, a professor of physics at Berkeley, was part of a team that suggested that the Sun had an unseen stellar companion which caused this periodicity, with this hypothetical companion being dubbed Nemesis. Muller was already involved in the automated supernova searches underway at Leuschner, and began the search for Nemesis using the optical telescopes at Leuschner Observatory.

The scheme allowed at least 50,000 persons, and their spouses and children, to become British citizens by means of registration under the 1990 Act. British nationals who were permanent residents of Hong Kong with the right of abode, who also met certain eligibility criteria, could apply to be selected to become registered as British citizens, under Section 1(1) of the 1990 Act, during two three- month periods: *1 December 1990 to 28 February 1991 *3 January 1994 to 31 March 1994 The Governor and the Government of Hong Kong retained the power to invite, accept, process and approve applications after 31 March 1994. However, no person could be registered by the British Home Secretary as a British citizen under that Section of the 1990 Act after 30 June 1997. Spouses and children of those who were granted British citizenship under Section 1(1) could apply for registration under Section 1(4) of the Act. All applications from spouses and children for registration under S. 1(4) were required to be made on or before 31 December 1996.  Eligibility criteria  To be considered for registration as a British citizen under s. 1(1), a person was required to be settled in Hong Kong and to be one of the following: *A British Dependent Territories Citizen (BDTC) by virtue of a connection with Hong Kong, or an applicant for registration or naturalisation; *A British National (Overseas) (BN(O)), British Overseas Citizen (BOC), British Subject (BS), or British Protected Person (BPP) There were four classes of eligible s. 1(1) applicants: *General Occupational Class (GOC), for managers and professionals. *Entrepreneurs Class (EC), for businessmen and women. *Disciplined Services Class (DSC), for Hong Kong civil servants in the police, fire, immigration, customs, and correctional services. *Sensitive Service Class (SSC), for those in public or private sector roles with particular vulnerabilities on account of their positions. Selection of persons in the GOC and DSC classes was primarily based on a \\"points system\\". Applicants who, in addition to British nationality, held, claimed or possessed, voluntarily or involuntarily, nationality or citizenship of another country, other than (and excluding) the nationality of the People's Republic of China (PRC), were penalised in the points test, although it was not a bar to acceptance, selection and registration. Spouses and children of family heads who registered under s. 1(1) were eligible for registration under s. 1(4) regardless of their nationality. However, a spouse who married the family head after that person was registered under s. 1(1) was required to be settled in Hong Kong on the date of the marriage to be eligible for registration under s. 1(4).

Under Chinese nationality law and the respective explanations made by the National People's Congress, those who were selected by BNSS would be treated as Chinese nationals on and after 1 July 1997 if they meet all the criteria outlined under the explanations. Those who wishes to be treated as a foreign national must apply for renunciation of Chinese nationality.

It falls under the jurisdiction of Valley of Springs Regional Council. In it had a population of . Name Tirat Zvi means Zvi's Fort. It was named after Rabbi Zvi Hirsch Kalischer (1795-1874), one of the fathers of the Zionist Movement and a leader of Hovevei Zion, while the tira or \\"fort\\" refers to a two-story mud-brick structure purchased from the Arab landowner, Musa al-Alami.History of Kibbutz Tirat Zvi Yorav History Tirat Zvi 1939 Tirat Zvi 1937 Palmach members training at Tirat Zvi at the end of 1947 The kibbutz was founded on 30 June 1937 as part of the Tower and Stockade settlement enterprise. The founders were Jews from Germany, Poland and Romania and came from three groups: Kvutzat near Petach Tikva, Kvutzat Shahal near Rehovot, and Kfar Yavetz. The Rodges group was named after the German village where the Religious Zionist Hakhshara centre (agricultural farm preparing youth for aliyah, or resettlement in Mandate Palestine) was located through which many of the founders of Tirat Zvi had passed. Kvutzat Shahal was named after the founder of the Mizrachi movement, Shmuel Chaim Landau (1892‚Äì1928), known by his Hebrew acronym \\"ShaChaL\\", or \\"lion\\". The kibbutz was attacked on 28 February 1938 by an armed Arab mob during the Arab revolt. The attack was repelled with many casualties on both sides. On 20 February 1948, before the neighboring Arab nations officially joined the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, a battalion of the Arab Liberation Army led by Muhammed Safa attacked Tirat Zvi. The Arabs were repelled, after 60 of the attackers were killed. One kibbutz member, Naftali Friedlander, was killed in the fighting. The settlement of Tirat Zvi was established on the land of the depopulated villages of al-Khunayzir and al- Zarra'a. Climate Tirat Zvi sits 220 meters below sea level. On 21 June 1942, it recorded the highest daytime temperature in Asia (54¬∞C; 129.2¬∞F), although the validity of this measurement has been questioned, and based on the published thermograph data it seems to have been somewhere between 52.0 to 54.4¬∞C. The record is questioned by Christopher C. Burt (one of the initiators of the WMO investigation into the now-disqualified El Azizia world record), who claims that the thermograph reading was incorrectly read and the correct reading is only 53¬∞C, in which case Sulaibya in Kuwait holds the record for highest temperature in Asia with 53.6¬∞C. Economy The kibbutz operates a meat processing factory, Tiv, which sells its products locally and abroad. Tirat Zvi is the largest date-palm grower in Israel, with 18,000 trees. The kibbutz also has a lulav business. Working with scientists from the Volcani Institute, Tirat Zvi developed a method of preserving the palm fronds for several months, allowing them to be harvested in the spring and sold in the fall, for use on the holiday of Sukkot. In 2009, it produced 70,000 lulavs. References *Edna Margolis, Isidor Margolis, R. Cohen & J.

Somerset Maugham, is a comedy whose modern and amusing take on marriage and infidelity gives a quick-witted, alternative view on how to deal with an extramarital affair. A ‚Äúsparkling comedy of ill manners‚Äù , The Constant Wife features the resourceful and charming Constance Middleton, who has long known that her husband had been having an affair with her best friend, Marie-Louise. When the affair is publicly acknowledged, rather than reprimanding or divorcing him, she embraces the opportunity to create an independent life, starting a new job, paying her husband for room and board, and taking on her own lover. The Constant Wife was later published for general sale in April 1927. The Constant Wife was most recently on Broadway in 2005, where Variety described it as \\"an antecedent to the women of Sex and the City‚Äù. The production's Kate Burton (Constance) and Lynn Redgrave (her mother) were nominated for Tony Awards.  Plot  Called one of Maugham‚Äôs ‚Äúmost clever and captivating creations‚Äù , Constance is the calm, intelligent, and self-possessed wife of John Middleton, a successful London doctor. Knowing full well of her husband's infidelity with her best friend Marie-Louise, Constance purposefully pretends that she has no idea of the affair. When Marie-Louise's jealous husband publicly confronts Constance about their spouses‚Äô affair, Constance protects both her husband and Marie- Louise by cleverly lying to disprove his evidence. She later reveals to her family that she has known of the affair all along, and further confounds them by demonstrating a total lack of sentiment on the subject of matrimony. Resolving to establish her own economic independence (\\"which she considers the only real independence\\"), she goes into business as an interior decorator with her friend Barbara. After taking London by storm in her new role, she determines to pay her husband for her room and board, and then announces she is going off for an Italian vacation with a longtime admirer. Her husband is, in turn, shocked and outraged at this turn of events, but finally capitulates to her outrageous charm‚Äîand to their unusual arrangement‚Äîas the curtain falls. Production history  The play was first produced in Cleveland, Ohio, at the Ohio Theatre, on November 1, 1926, with Ethel Barrymore playing the title role, and Mabel Terry-Lewis and C. Aubrey Smith in support. It subsequently opened on Broadway, running for 295 performances, and was successfully toured by Ms. Barrymore afterwards. When the first edition of the play was published in 1927, Maugham dedicated it to her. Years later, he said that her performance was the best he had seen in any of his plays. The Constant Wife has been produced multiple times in London‚ÄîRuth Chatterton (Globe Theatre, 1937); Ingrid Bergman (Albery Theatre, September 1973), Jenny Seagrove (Apollo Theatre, April 2002, then transferring to the Lyric Theatre, June 2002)‚Äîdespite a rocky premier starring Fay Compton at the Strand Theatre in April 1927, in part due to the theater‚Äôs muddling of seating arrangements and Ms. Compton‚Äôs insulting the audience. In December 1951, a U.S. revival starring Katharine Cornell was staged for a summer festival in Colorado. It was such a success that Cornell took the production to the National Theatre on Broadway starring herself and Brian Aherne. It grossed more money for Cornell's production company than any play she and her husband-director Guthrie McClintic ever produced. In addition to the 2005 revival on Broadway, other revivals include John Gielgud's staging, also starring Ingrid Bergman and Jack Gwillim, at the Shubert Theatre on Broadway (1975), Minneapolis (2005), Charleston, SC (2007) and the Gate Theatre, Dublin (2016) starring Tara Blaise.

It is the most religious Buddhist country in terms of the proportion of monks in the population and proportion of income spent on religion.Cone & Gombrich, Perfect Generosity of Prince Vessantara, Oxford University Press, 1977, page xxii Adherents are most likely found among the dominant Bamar people, Shan, Rakhine, Mon, Karen, and Chinese who are well integrated into Burmese society. Monks, collectively known as the sangha, are venerated members of Burmese society. Among many ethnic groups in Myanmar, including the Bamar and Shan, Theravada Buddhism is practised in conjunction with nat worship, which involves the placation of spirits who can intercede in worldly affairs. With regard to the daily routines of Buddhists in Myanmar, there are two most popular practices: merit- making and vipassanƒÅ. The weizza path is the least popular; it is an esoteric form somewhat linked to Buddhist aspiration that involves the occult. Merit- making is the most common path undertaken by Burmese Buddhists. This path involves the observance of the Five precepts and accumulation of good merit through charity and good deeds (dana) to obtain a favourable rebirth. The vipassana path, which has gained ground since the early 1900s, is a form of insight meditation believed to lead to enlightenment. The weizza path is an esoteric system of occult practices (such as recitation of spells, samatha and alchemy) believed to lead to life as a weizza (also spelt weikza), a semi- immortal and supernatural being who awaits the appearance of the future Buddha, Maitreya (Arimeitaya). Demography Buddhism is practiced by approximately 90% of the country. According to Burmese census data dating back to 1891, between 84% to 90% of the population have practiced Buddhism.  History  LokanƒÅtha Illustration of a bhikkhu (1795) The history of Buddhism in Myanmar probably extends more than two thousand years. The SƒÅsana Va·πÉsa (Burmese Thathana Win), written by Pinyasami in 1834, summarises much of the history of Buddhism in Myanmar. According to the Mahavamsa, a Pali chronicle of fifth century Sri Lanka, Ashoka sent two bhikkhus, Sona and Uttara, to Suvarnabhumi around 228 BC with other monks and sacred texts, including books. An Andhra Ikshvaku inscription from about the 3rd century refers to the conversion of the Kiratas to Buddhism, who are thought to have been Tibeto-Burman-speaking peoples of Myanmar.Sylvain L√©vi, \\"Concept of Tribal Society\\" in Early Chinese texts of about the same date speak of a \\"Kingdom of Liu-Yang,\\" where all people worshiped the Buddha and there were several thousand sama·πáas. This kingdom has been identified with a region somewhere in central Burma. A series of epigraphic records in Pali, Sanskrit, Pyu and Mon datable to the 6th and 7th centuries, has been recovered from Central and Lower Burma (Pyay and Yangon). From the 11th to 13th centuries, the Bamar kings and queens of the Pagan Kingdom built countless stupas and temples. The Ari Buddhism era included the worship of bodhisattvas and nƒÅgas. Theravada Buddhism was implanted at Bagan for the first time as early as the 11th century by the Bamar king Anawrahta (1044-1077). In year 1057, Anawrahta sent an army to conquer the Mon city of Thaton to obtain theTipi·π≠ƒÅka of the PƒÅli Canon. He was converted by a Mon bhikkhu, Shin Arahan, to Theravada Buddhism. Shin Arahan's advice led to acquiring thirty sets of Pali scriptures from the Mon king Manuha by force. Mon culture, from that point, came to be largely assimilated into the Bamar culture based in Bagan. Despite attempts at reform, certain features of Ari Buddhism and traditional nat worship continued, such as reverence for the bodhisattva Avalokite≈õvara (Lawka nat). Successive kings of Bagan continued to build large numbers of monuments, temples, and pagodas in honour of Buddhism, and there is inscriptional evidence of a Theravadin vihara for bhikkhunis from 1279. Burmese rule at Bagan continued until the first Mongol invasion of Burma in 1287. Towards the end of the 13th century, Buddhism declined due to the invading Tatars. In the 14th century, another forest lineage was imported from Sri Lanka to Ayutthaya, the capital of the Thai Ayutthaya Kingdom. A new ordination line was also imported into Burma. The Shan, meanwhile, established themselves as rulers throughout the region now known as Myanmar. Thihathu, a Shan king, established rule in Bagan by patronising and building many monasteries and pagodas. The Mon kingdoms, often ruled by Shan chieftains, fostered Theravada Buddhism in the 14th century. Wareru, who became king of Mottama, patronised Buddhism, and established a code of law, the Dhammasattha, compiled by Buddhist monastics. King Dhammazedi, formerly a Mon bhikkhu, established rule in the late 15th century at Inwa and unified the sangha in Mon territories. He also standardised ordination of monks set out in the Kalyani Inscriptions. Dhammazedi moved the capital back to Hanthawaddy (Bago). His mother-in-law, Queen Shin Sawbu, was also a great patron of Buddhism. She is credited for expanding and gilding the Shwedagon Pagoda, giving her own weight in gold. The Bamars, who had fled to Taungoo before the invading Shan, established a kingdom there under the reigns of Tabinshwehti and Bayinnaung, who conquered and unified most of modern Myanmar. These monarchs also embraced Mon culture and patronised Theravada Buddhism. Mandalay's Kuthodaw Pagoda, which houses marble slabs containing all of the Tipitaka scriptures, was constructed during the reign of King Mindon. In the reigns of succeeding kings, the Taungoo Dynasty became increasingly volatile and was overthrown by the Mon. In the mid-18th century, King Alaungpaya defeated the Mon, expanded the Bamar kingdoms, and established the Konbaung Dynasty. Under the rule of Bodawpaya, a son of Alaungpaya, a unified sect of monks (\\"Thudhamma\\") was created within the kingdom. Bodawpaya restored ties with Sri Lanka, allowing for mutual influence in religious affairs. During the reigns of the Konbaung kings that followed, both secular and religious literary works were created.Charney, Michael W. (2006) Powerful Learning. Buddhist Literati and the Throne in Burma's Last Dynasty, 1752-1885. Ann Arbor: The University of Michigan. http://www.press.umich.edu/titleDetailDesc.do?id=225773 King Mindon Min moved his capital to Mandalay. After Lower Burma had been conquered by the British, Christianity began to gain acceptance. Many monks from Lower Burma had resettled in Mandalay, but by decree of Mindon Min, they returned to serve the Buddhist laypeople. Schisms arose in the sangha; they were resolved during the Fifth Buddhist Synod, held in Mandalay in 1871. The Fifth Council was convened at Mandalay in Myanmar on the first waning day of Tazaungmone, 1232 Myanmar Era, 2415 B.E (November 1871). The scriptures inscribed on palm-leaves could not last for a long time. Besides there might be many variations in rewriting the scriptures from copy to copy. Therefore, the scriptures were inscribed on marble slabs to dispel these disadvantages. Two thousand and four hundred bhikkhus led by Venerable Jagarabhivamsa Thera (Tipitakadhara Mahadhammarajadhirajaguru) of Dakkhinarama Monastery, Mandalay, convened, to recite and approve the scriptures. King Mindon initiated and supported the Fifth Great Council to the end. The scriptures were first inscribed on seven hundred and twenty-nine marble slabs ) in the precinct of Lokamarajina Pagoda at the foot of Mandalay Hill. From 1860 to 1868, the Tipitaka was engraved on 729 marble slabs and assembled in the Kuthodaw Pagoda. It took seven years, six months and fourteen days to finish this work. Then the bhikkhus recited to approve the inscriptions for five months and three days. In 1871, a new hti (the gold umbrella that crowns a stupa) encrusted with jewels from the crown was also donated by Mindon Min for the Shwedagon now in British Burma. After the Fifth Great Council. the Pali Texts were translated into Myanmar language, and the Doctrinal Order was promulgated to the whole country for purpose of purification and propagation of the Buddha's Teachings. In February 2012, 1000 Buddhist monks and followers gathered for the 18th annual Shwegyin Nikaya Conference at the compound of Dhammaduta Zetawon Tawya Monastery in Hmawbi Township, Yangon Region. During the British administration of Lower and Upper Burma, also known as Burma Proper, government policies were secular which meant monks were not protected by law. Nor was Buddhism patronised by the colonial government. This resulted in tensions between the colonised Buddhists and their European rulers. There was much opposition (including by the Irish monk U Dhammaloka) to the efforts by Christian missionaries to convert the Burmese people, Bamar, Shan, Mon, Rakhine and plains Karen, with one exception - the hill tribes. Today, Christianity is most commonly practised by the Chin, Kachin, and the Kayin. Notwithstanding traditional avoidance of political activity, monks often participated in politics and in the struggle for independence. Since 1948 when the country gained its independence from Great Britain, both civil and military governments have supported Theravada Buddhism. The 1947 Constitution states, \\"The State recognizes the special position of Buddhism as the faith professed by the great majority of the citizens of the Union.\\" The Ministry of Religious Affairs, created in 1948, was responsible for administering Buddhist affairs in Myanmar. In 1954, the prime minister, U Nu, convened the Sixth Buddhist Synod at Kaba Aye Pagoda in Rangoon (Yangon), which was attended by 2,500 monks, and established the World Buddhist University. During the military rule of Ne Win (1962‚Äì1988), he attempted to reform Myanmar under the Burmese Way to Socialism which contained elements of Buddhism. In the 8888 Uprising, many monks participated and were killed by Tatmadaw soldiers. The succeeding military regime, the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) patronised Buddhism, although persecution of Buddhists contrary to the regime, as well as persons of other religions, namely Islam and Christianity, continues. Traditions Monks throughout Myanmar make alms rounds around the community in the early morning. The culture of Myanmar is deemed synonymous with its Buddhism. There are many Burmese festivals all through the year, most of them related to Buddhism. The Burmese New Year, Thingyan, also known as the Water Festival, has its origins in Hinduism but it is also a time when many Burmese boys celebrate shinbyu, a special rite of passage by which a boy enters the kyaung for a short time as a sƒÅma·πáera. =Veneration= A typical home altar consists of a simple shelf on which statues of the Buddha and offerings are placed.. A Burmese Buddhist household contains an altar or shrine to the Buddha, with at least one dedicated image of the Gautama Buddha. The Buddha image is commonly placed on a \\"throne\\" called a gaw pallin (, from Pali pallanka). Before a Buddha statue is used for veneration at home, it must be formally consecrated, in a ritual called buddhƒÅbhiseka or anay gaza tin (). This consecration, led by a Buddhist monk, who recites aneka jƒÅti sa·πÉsƒÅra·πÉ (translated as 'through the round of many births I roamed'), the 153rd verse of the Dhammapada (found in the 11th chapter). The consecration rite, which can last a few hours, is held in the morning and consists of four primary parts: # Offerings (candles, flowers, incense, flags) made to the Buddha # Chanting of paritta (typically Mangala Sutta, Metta Sutta, Ratana Sutta, Pubbhana Sutta) # Recitation of aneka jƒÅti sa·πÉsƒÅra·πÉ # Recitation of the Twelve NidƒÅnas The consecration rituals are believed to imbue the Buddha image with a sacred quality that can protect the home and surroundings from misfortune and symbolically embody the powers of the Buddha. =Shinbyu= A traditional Buddhist altar at a kyaung in Taunggyi, Shan State. It is the most important duty of all Burmese parents to make sure their sons are admitted to the Buddhist Sangha by performing a shinbyu ceremony once they have reached the age of seven or older. A symbolic procession and ceremony of exchanging princely attire with that of an ascetic follows the example of Gautama Buddha. He was born a royal prince named Siddartha Gautama, but left his palace on horseback followed by his loyal attendant Chanda () after he found out that life is made up of suffering (dukkha) and the notion of self is merely an illusion (anatta) when one day he saw the \\"Four Great Signs\\" () - the old, the sick, the dead, and the ascetic - in the royal gardens. All Buddhists are required to keep the basic Five Precepts (), and novices are expected to keep the Ten Precepts (). Parents expect them to stay at the kyaung immersed in the teachings of the Buddha as members of the Sangha for three months or longer. They will have another opportunity to join the Sangha at the age of 20, taking the upasampada ordination, to become a fully ordained bhikkhu, keeping the 227 precepts of the full monastic rules or PƒÅtimokkha and perhaps remain a monk for life. =Buddhist holidays= Vesak, the full moon of Kason, is celebrated by watering the Bodhi Tree Thingyan usually falls in mid-April and tops the list of Public holidays in Myanmar. Vesak, the full moon in May, is the most sacred of all as the Buddha was born, became enlightened, and entered parinibbana (died) on the same day. It is celebrated by watering the Bodhi Tree. Pagoda festivals ( Paya pw√®) held throughout the country also usually fall on full moon days and most of them will be on the full moon of Tabaung (February/March) including the Shwedagon Pagoda. They attract not only crowds of pilgrims from near and far, often in caravans of bullock carts, but they also double as great market fairs where both local and itinerant traders set up their stalls and shops among food stalls, restaurants, and free open-air stage performances as well as theatre halls. =Vassa= The three monsoon months from mid-July to mid-October is Vassa (, ), a time when people are busy tilling their land and planting the rice paddies and bhikkhus remain in kyaungs. New robes are offered to bhikkhus at the beginning of Vassa, the end of which is marked by the Thadingyut Festival. After the harvest, robes are again offered at Kathina (), usually held during October or November. Uposatha days are observed by keeping the Eight Precepts by laypersons during Thingyan and Vassa and by devout Buddhists all the year round. Parents and elders also receive obeisance from younger members of the family at the beginning as well as the end of lent, after the tradition established by the Buddha himself. It was during Vassa that he ascended to the TƒÅvati·πÉsa Heaven to preach a sermon, as an act of gratitude, to his mother, who had become a deva, and he was welcomed back to earth with a great festival of lights. Teachers receive the same obeisance, a tradition started by National Schools founded in defiance of the colonial administration and continued after independence by state schools. Wedding ceremonies - nothing to do with religion and not conducted by the Sangha - are not held during the three months of Vassa, a custom which has resulted in a spate of weddings after Thadingyut or Wa-kyut, awaited impatiently by couples wanting to tie the knot. =Buddhist education= Monks take an examination in Bago. Theravadins send their children to kyaungs to receive a Buddhist education, learning the PƒÅli Canon, the life story of Gautama Buddha, the 550 Jataka tales - most importantly the 38 Buddhist Beatitudes - as soon as they have a good grounding of the three Rs. Monks were the traditional teachers of the young and old alike until secular and missionary schools came into being during the British colonial administration. There has been a revival of monastic schools since the 1990s with the deepening economic crisis. Children from poor families that can ill afford fees, uniforms and books have renewed the demand for a free monastic education, and minority groups such as the Shan, Pa'O, Palaung, Lahu and Wa are benefitting from this revival.  Monasticism  Monks at the Mahagandhayon Monastery in Amarapura are ordained into the Shwegyin Nikaya, one of the more orthodox monastic orders. Buddhist monks are venerated throughout Burmese society. According to 2016 statistics published by the State Sangha Maha Nayaka Committee, the Sangha included 535,327 members, evenly split between 282,347 fully-ordained Buddhist monks (bhikku) and 252,962 novice monks (samanera). There were also 60,390 thilashin (female renunciants). The majority of Buddhist monks belong to one of two primary monastic orders ( gaing): Thudhamma Nikaya (87.24% of Buddhist monks) and the more orthodox Shwegyin Nikaya (9.47% of Buddhist monks). Other minor monastic orders include the Dwara Nikaya in Lower Burma, and Hngettwin Nikaya in Mandalay, both of which have a few thousand member monks. There are nine legally recognised monastic orders in Burma today, under the 1990 Law Concerning Sangha Organizations. Burmese monastic orders do not differ in doctrine but in monastic practice, lineage and organisational structure. There are also esoteric Buddhist sects or weizza not recognised by any authority that incorporate non-Buddhist elements like alchemy, magic and occultism. The overwhelming majority of Burmese monks wear maroon robes, while others wear ochre, unlike in neighbouring Theravada countries like Thailand, Laos and Sri Lanka, where monks commonly wear saffron robes.  Women  Thilashin during alms round in Yangon. Young Thilashin before alms round in Pyin Oo Lwin train station. The full bhikkhuni (nuns) lineage of Theravada Buddhism died out, and for various technical and social reasons was therefore permanently absent. The governing council of Buddhism in Myanmar has ruled that there can be no valid ordination of women in modern times, though some Burmese monks disagree. However, as in many other Theravadin countries, women have created a niche for themselves as renunciants not recognised by the state-empowered Sangharaja or even the Sangha in general. In Myanmar, these women are called thilashin.The Buddhist world of Southeast Asia By Donald K. Swearer A thilashin (, , \\"possessor of morality\\", from Pali sƒ´la) is a female lay renunciant whose vows are the same as those of sƒÅma·πáerƒ´s \\"novitiate nuns\\". Like the maechi of neighbouring Thailand and the dasa sil mata of Sri Lanka, thilashin occupy a position somewhere between that of an ordinary lay follower and an ordained monastic. However, they are treated more favourably than most maechi, being able to receive training, practice meditation and sit for the same qualification examinations as the monks. Thilashins observe the ten precepts and can be recognised by their pink robes, shaven head, orange or brown shawl and metal alms bowl. Thilashins go out on alms rounds on uposatha and receive uncooked rice or money. Thilashins are addressed with the honorifics sayale (, \\"little teacher\\") and daw (, ). These are used as honorifics to the Buddhist name given. Thilashins often reside in either separate quarters or in segregated kyaung (temple-monasteries). They do not have to look after the monks, but may help cook if required. Although ranked lower than the monks, they are not subservient to them. There have been efforts by some thilashins to reinstate the bhikkhuni lineage, although there are reservations from the government and general populace. A new Theravada bhikkhuni sangha was first convened in 1996, and since then many more have taken the full vows. However, within Myanmar, thilashins remain the only monastic option for women at this time. In 2003, Saccavadi and Gunasari were ordained as bhikkhunis in Sri Lanka, thus becoming the first female Myanma novices in modern times to receive higher ordination in Sri Lanka.  Politics  The Pariyatti Sasana University in Mandalay, operated by the Ministry of Religious Affairs, is supported by the state. Buddhism made major contributions in the development of Burmese politics. Burmese nationalism first began with the formation of the Young Men's Buddhist Associations (YMBA) - modelled on the YMCA - which started to appear all over the country at the start of the 20th century. Buddhist monks along with students had been in the forefront of the struggle for independence and later for democracy, the best known leaders in history being U Ottama and U Seinda in Rakhine State, and U Wisara who died after a protracted hunger strike in Yangon prison. A major thoroughfare in Yangon is named after U Wisara. The League of Young Monks ( Yahanpyo) based in Mandalay is a well known activist organisation. The Burmese word for boycott is thabeik hmauk (), which literally means to turn the monk's alms bowl upside down - declining to accept alms in protest. Buddhist monks were at the forefront of the so-called Saffron Revolution in 2007, in protest of living and economic conditions in the country. Civilian governments, after the country gained independence, patronised Buddhism, donating large sums to fund the upkeep and building of Buddhist monuments. In addition, leaders of political parties and parliamentarians, in particular U Nu, passed legislation influenced by Buddhism. He declared Buddhism the state religion which alienated minority groups, especially the Kachin. This added yet another group to the growing number of ethnic insurgencies. The present military government has been so keen to be seen as patrons of Buddhism that it has become a joke- \\"Burmese TV has only two colours, green and yellow\\" - describing the military green uniforms and monk's yellow robes or golden pagodas which dominate the screen. Shwedagon Pagoda has been an important venue for large public meetings where both Aung San and his daughter Aung San Suu Kyi had made their famous speeches. During the second university strike in history of 1936, the students camped out on the Shwedagon terraces. Aung San Suu Kyi returned from London to lead the National League for Democracy which was founded during the 1988 popular uprising, but was placed under house arrest in 1989; since she is a devout Buddhist and leader of the opposition, she is considered a socially engaged Buddhist. =Saffron Revolution= In September 2007, Buddhists again took to the streets in the Saffron Revolution, a mass protest against the military government. Thousand of junta military and police forces poured into Yangon to try to control the situation, which rapidly deteriorated. A curfew was imposed and on 25 September troops surrounded Sule Pagoda. The protest continued to grow with regular citizens joining to support and defend the Buddhists. Overnight, junta forces invaded all the kyaungs in the country and imprisoned thousands of monks. It was reported that Nobel prize winning human rights activist and Buddhist Aung San Suu Kyi was removed from her home where she languished under house arrest and moved to the infamous Insein Prison. Mass protests erupted over this and junta troops began firing on monks, civilians, and demonstrators in the largest clash since 1988, which left thousands injured and hundreds dead. Images of the brutality were aired worldwide. Leaders around the world condemned the junta's actions and many nations imposed economic sanctions on Myanmar in protest. The President of the United States, George W. Bush, addressed the United Nations, stating, \\"Every civilized nation has a responsibility to stand up for people suffering under a brutal military regime like the one that has ruled Burma for so long.\\" The Burmese junta responded by trying to control media coverage, curtail travel, censor news stories, and shut down access to the Internet. In November 2008, U Gambira, a leader of the All Burma Monks' Alliance, was sentenced to 68 years in prison, at least 12 years of which will be hard labour; other charges against him are still pending. In early 2009, his sentence was reduced to 63 years. His sentence was protested by Human Rights Watch, and Amnesty International considers him a prisoner of conscience. Both groups called for his immediate release. Gambira was released during a mass pardon of prisoners on 13 January 2012 as part of the 2011‚Äì2012 Burmese political reforms. He ceased to be a monk in April 2012, stating that he had been unable to find a monastery to join due to his status as a former prisoner. He was re-arrested at least three times in 2012, and as of 11 December 2012, was released on bail.

She was the first steamship to operate in the Pacific Northwest of North America, and made remote parts of the west coast of Canada accessible for maritime fur trading. At one point she was chartered by the Royal Navy for surveying the coastline of British Columbia. She served off the coast from 1836 until 1888, when she was wrecked. Construction and delivery Beaver was built in Blackwall, England of British oak, elm, greenheart and teak, and was copper-fastened and sheathed. Her length was , and the beam over her paddle boxes was . She was launched at Blackwall Yard on 9 May 1835 and left London on 29 August under the command of Captain David Home, and with the company's barque, Columbia, built at the same time and commanded by Captain Darby. Beaver was outfitted as a brig for the passage out, paddles unshipped, and came out via Cape Horn under sail alone. After calling at the Juan Fern√°ndez Islands and Honolulu, she arrived off the Columbia River on 18 March 1836 and anchored off Fort Vancouver on 10 April. Here the paddles were shipped and boilers and engines connected. Service Beaver served trading posts maintained by the Hudson's Bay Company between the Columbia River and Russian America (Alaska) and played an important role in helping maintain British control in British Columbia during the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush of 1858-59. In 1862 the Royal Navy chartered her to survey and chart the coast of the Colony of British Columbia. She also provided assistance to the Royal Navy at Bute Inlet during the Chilcotin War. Initially she had a rectangular boiler, generating steam pressure at under 3 psi, and was fed by seawater. Boulton and Watt engines are not pressure engines, rather they are vacuum engines. (Salt water feed was common in the early days and could be done with low pressure and frequent boiler blowdowns to prevent salt scale build up on the plates.) The salt water played havoc with the boilers as the salinity rusted the wall thickness of the boiler, which would rot out. Beaver had to have a new boiler every seven years or so and went through multiple installations over her career. Over time the boiler pressure was increased, and 36 inch diameter cylinders replaced the original 42 inch cylinders. Beaver played roles in the establishment of coal mines at Fort Rupert, and later in 1853, Nanaimo. She helped the Hudson's Bay Company establish Fort Victoria as a post in 1843. She would also ferry dignitaries such as the Governor back and forth between the Colony of Vancouver Island and the mainland, which until 1858 and the establishment of the Colony of British Columbia had come to be known as New Caledonia after the Oregon Treaty of 1846. In her later life Beaver burned coal and would hire young men of the Skwxwu7mesh (Squamish) people of North Vancouver to work the holds as coal passers. The Hudson's Bay Company finally sold her in 1874. Loss Side lever engine off PS Levan; Beaver's engine had two cylinders and was built by Boulton and Watt. The wreck of S.S. Beaver A consortium that became the British Columbia Towing and Transportation Company in 1874 purchased her, and used her as a towboat until 25 July 1888. On that day an inebriated crew ran her aground on rocks in Burrard Inlet at Prospect Point in Vancouver's Stanley Park. The wreck finally sank in July 1892 when the wake of the passing steamer Yosemite struck it, but only after enterprising locals had stripped much of the wreck for souvenirs. The Vancouver Maritime Museum houses a collection of Beaver remnants including the boiler and two drive shafts for the paddle wheels, one raised in the 1960s and the other returned from a collection in Tacoma, along with the boiler. A plaque commemorates the site of the sinking. Divers surveyed the wreck in the 1960s. However, when the Underwater Archaeological Society of BC did so in the 1990s, they found she had mostly disintegrated due to rot and currents.

He is known as a rationalist who offered natural explanations for the biblical miracles of Jesus. Career Paulus was a professor of theology and oriental languages at the University of Jena (1789‚Äì1803), then professor at the University of W√ºrzburg (1803‚Äì1807). He spent time in Bamberg, N√ºrnberg and Ansbach before becoming professor of exegesis and church history at the University of Heidelberg (1811‚Äì44), where he was instrumental in hiring Hegel in 1816. His theological rationalism greatly influenced Hegel's own theology. As a Lutheran in the Age of Enlightenment, he firmly believed in the autonomy of the individual and freedom of the individual (through reason) from the dogma of the church. Charges of anti-semitism have been levelled at Paulus for his advocacy of assimilation of Jewish people into German culture. In his published pamphlet \\"The Jewish National Separation: Its Origin, Consequences, and the Means of its Correction.\\" he argued that \\"Jews were a nation apart, and would remain so as long as they were committed to their religion, whose basic intent and purpose were to preserve them in that condition. In a country that was not their own, therefore, Jews could not claim more than the bare protection of their lives and possessions.

It is considered to be part of the authoritative religious text of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith. The work was lithographed in Bombay in 1882 and received wide circulation in Iran under the Persian title Risali-yi-madaniyyih or the Treatise on Civilization.  Background  The original text was written under an anonymous author, and the first English translation was published in London in 1910, and Chicago in 1918, under the title Mysterious Forces of Civilization written by \\"an Eminent Bahai Philosopher\\". The currently used translation was completed by Marzieh Gail and published in 1957, with an introduction by Horace Holley. According to Peter Smith, \\"the book was written at a time when genuine reform of Iran seemed possible as Mirza Husayn Khan was still politically influential and Nasser al-Din Shah Qajar had just made his first visit to Europe\\" in 1873. The reform process petered out in the late 1870s and  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° did not pursue his plan to write other books on related themes such as education. See the full online text here.  Overview  The book was widely known in its time as an attempt to improve the degraded condition of Persia. The author frequently references current issues that were being debated, such as whether to modernize and accept Western technology, or to reject Western culture and rely on technology developed in Persia and the Islamic world. Among the topics discussed is the honor of an individual and a nation. \\"The happiness and pride of a nation consist in this, that it should shine out like the sun in the high heaven of knowledge... And the honor and distinction of the individual consist in this, that he among all the world's multitudes should become a source of social good.\\" The text highlights the importance of a nations ability to learn from its history, and from other nations in the formation of its social structure, and the importance of education and altruism of the nation's individuals. Attention is also given to the reformation of academic curriculum and the methods of studying, advising that schools and universities should stay away from idle disputes and debates on subjects that are based on pure supposition which are not relevant to the current societies need, and that certain valuable subjects are neglected in the process. His counsel on this is that \\"the individual should, prior to engaging in the study of any subject, ask himself what its uses are and what fruit and result will derive from it.

It was initially the second largest federal employer during its time. After staff reductions in the 1980s, the staff was reduced to roughly 543,200 employees in 1985. The corporation was dissolved in 1995 under the first and second postal reforms that took place in the German Post Office. Following the reforms, the former Deutsche Bundespost was broken into three publicly traded corporations: Deutsche Post AG (German Post), Deutsche Telekom (German Telecom), and Deutsche Postbank AG (German Post Bank).  History  It was created in 1947 in the Trizone as a successor to the Reichspost (German imperial post office). Between 1947 and 1950 the enterprise was called Deutsche Post (German post office). Until 1989 the Deutsche Bundespost was a state-owned operation. = Organization = The Bundespost was developed according to a three-tier principle common in public administration in the Federal Republic of Germany. The upper stage consisted of the federal ministry for the post office and telecommunication system. The middle stage consisted of regional directorates (Bundespostdirektionen) and the state post office management (Landespostdirektion) under western Allied authority in West Berlin (see Deutsche Bundespost Berlin) as of 1949/1955). The post office technical central office, telecommunication engineering central office, postal administration social office, and post offices) were on an equal level with the directorates. The lower stage consisted of post office branches, postal giro (akin to a checking account) savings bank offices and telecommunications office branches. = Legal basis = The legal basis for the administrative activity of the Bundespost was the postal administration act (Postverwaltungsgesetz, abbreviated PostVwG). A central goal of public administrative policy after 1924 was financial self-sufficiency. Political goals, however, often superseded this goal. According to the PostVwG, the federal postal system was to be administered \\"according to the principles of the policy of the FRG, in particular trade, economic, financial and social policies\\" and \\"the interests of the German national economy.\\" The Deutsche Bundespost was the largest employer in the Federal Republic. In 1985 it employed 543,200 people. = Reforms = In the first post office reform (July 1, 1989), the Bundespost was divided into three divisions (also called public enterprises): * Deutsche Bundespost Postdienst ‚Äì postal service * Deutsche Bundespost Telekom ‚Äì communications service * Deutsche Bundespost Postbank ‚Äì postal bank The central authorities remained as described above. The divisions were privatized in the second post office reform (January 1, 1995), resulting in: * Deutsche Post AG from the postal service * Deutsche Telekom AG from the communications service * Deutsche Postbank AG from the postal bank The federal ministry for post office and telecommunications (Bundesministerium f√ºr Post und Telekommunikation) retained oversight responsibility for postal services and telecommunications. After the dissolution of that ministry on 1 January 1998, those tasks were taken over by a new federal network regulatory agency (Bundesnetzagentur, formerly RegTP) under the federal ministry for economics and technology.

The tablet (as Bah√° ºu'll√°h's works are often called) was written during his time in Baghdad (1853-1863) in Arabic, and was published in English in 2002. Background The work was written in reply to a question from Siyyid Y√∫suf-i-Sidih√≠ Isfah√°n√≠, a religious leader of the Shi ªas in Najaf, who had asked the question of how the promised Mahdi could have been \\"transformed\\" (meaning: the return of the Promised One in a different human guise) into Ali-Muhammad the (B√°b). The work was written on the same day as the question had been received and delivered through an intermediary. According to a compilation published in 2000 by researchers at the Wilmette Institute, Siyyid Y√∫suf-i-Sidih√≠ Isfah√°n√≠, who was residing in Karbila when the tablet was written, recognized the divinity of Bah√° ºu'll√°h after reading the tablet.

Since May 2018, it operates as a brand of Deutsche Bank's retail arm. It serves 13 million customers in around 1,000 branches and 700 advisory centers. History The Postscheckdienst was introduced in 1909 by the German Reich establishing accounts for payment transactions by mail and linking postal and banking services in German states. In 1990, following the German Postal Services Restructuring Act (Poststrukturgesetz) of 1989, the German Postal Service (Deutsche Bundespost) was divided into three companies, Deutsche Post, Deutsche Telekom and Postbank. Later that year, Deutsche Post Postbank of the former East Germany was merged with Postbank. From 1990 to 1997, Dr. Guenter Schneider was chairman of the board. The first board of Postbank consisted of Guenter Schneider, Rudolf Bauer and Bernhard Zurhorst. On 1 January 1995, following the new postal reform legislation (Gesetze zur Postreform II) of 1994, Postbank became an independent, joint stock company. Postbank then extended operations, and engaged in loans, insurance and homes savings. In 1999, Deutsche Post became the owner of Postbank.

Along with the change in ownership, around 9,600 employees switched employer, bringing Postbank's workforce to over 25,000 employees. In September 2008, 30% of Postbank was sold to Deutsche Bank for ‚Ç¨2.8 billion. In October 2010, Postbank put its Indian finance business up for sale.

There was no significant opposition from the Imperial Japanese Navy, nor from the Japanese Army and Navy Air Forces, except for kamikaze (suicide) attacks on American ships. The Japanese force in Mindoro was not large, and was eliminated in three days. The Army was assisted in the campaign by guerrillas from the local Filipino population. The U.S. captured Mindoro to establish airfields there, which would be in fighter range of Lingayen Gulf in northern Luzon Island, where the next major amphibious invasion of the Philippines was planned. Ground-based fighter cover was necessary for this operation. Mindoro could also serve as the advanced base for U.S. troops going to fight in Luzon. Background For the invasion of Luzon, U.S. forces needed air bases that were closer to the northern island than Leyte Island. Mindoro was the logical choice. Located not too far south of Luzon, and being about one-half the size of New Jersey, Mindoro is mostly covered by hills and mountains, with a few narrow plains along its seacoasts. Almost daily rains and high humidity, caused by clouds moving up from the south trapped by the high peaks made it a breeding ground for malaria and other tropical diseases. However, Japanese defenses on the island were minimal. The airfields recently constructed at Leyte were deemed unreliable, so potential additional airfields in Mindoro appealed to General of the Army Douglas MacArthur, the commanding general of this theater of operations. But taking Mindoro was a daunting task. The northeastern coast was best suited for amphibious landings, but was exposed to what was left of Japanese air power on Luzon, so this was ruled out. The town of San Jose on the southwest corner, though nearer to Mangarin Bay, Mindoro's best deepwater port, was the spot chosen by his planners. The U.S. Sixth Army under Lieutenant General Walter Krueger was assigned to seize Mindoro. Krueger, in turn, gave the task to Major General Roscoe B. Woodruff's 24th Infantry Division, with the 19th Infantry and the separate 503rd Parachute Regimental Combat Team of Lieutenant Colonel George M. Jones to spearhead the assault. The main threat to the amphibious assault vessels and supporting warships was land-based Japanese kamikaze planes. The Japanese had begun the deadly practice as a desperate measure during the final stages of the Battle of Leyte and widened its use by December 1944. In early December, USAAF and USN airplanes attacked Japanese air bases to destroy potential kamikazes before they could attack. U.S. aviators claimed more than 700 planes destroyed on the ground. On 13 December 1944, two days before the scheduled assault on the island, kamikazes struck at the Navy task force bringing the landing force. The light cruiser USS was hit by a kamikaze, killing over 130 men and wounding another 190. Brigadier General William C. Dunkel, the commander of the landing force, was among the injured. Other kamikaze attacks damaged two tank landing ships (LSTs, for Landing Ship, Tank) and disabled several other ships. Battle A map of Allied and Japanese movements during the Battle of Mindoro and the occupation of the Marinduque Islands On 15 December, the invasion of Mindoro began. The clear weather allowed the full use of American air and naval power, including six escort carriers, three battleships, six cruisers and many other support warships against light Japanese resistance. Because of inadequate airstrip facilities in Leyte, the 503rd Parachute Regimental Combat Team came ashore in Mangarin Bay with the landing force instead of jumping. Destroyers provided fire support for the troop landings and anti-aircraft protection for the ships in the transport area. Two LSTs struck by kamikazes were abandoned and sank. In one heroic action, the destroyer USS (DD-693), under the command of Commander Walter M. Foster, went alongside the burning (which was loaded with aviation fuel and ordnance) to rescue crewmembers. Several explosions aboard LST-738 caused damage to Moale as she pulled away. Some pieces of shrapnel were two feet square and they put four holes in Moales hull. Gunner's Mate Ed Marsh reported that a one-gallon jar of vaseline from the LST's cargo splattered on one barrel of his twin 40 mm Bofors AA gun, providing unwelcome lubrication. Moale suffered one fatality and thirteen wounded. In addition, Moale also rescued 88 survivors. There were 1,000 defending Japanese soldiers stationed on Mindoro. Another 200 survivors from ships sunk off Mindoro en route to Leyte were also present. The defenders were outnumbered and outgunned. Some 300 Japanese manning an air raid warning station at the island's northern end put up a stiff fight against a company of the 503rd, but except for mopping up, the island was secure within 48 hours. Aftermath The defending Japanese forces on Mindoro suffered some 200 killed and 375 wounded. The survivors fled into the jungles, where they lurked till the end of the war. The 24th Infantry Division lost 18 men and had 81 wounded. By the end of the first day, Army engineers were at work preparing airfields. Two were completed in thirteen days. These airfields allowed U.S. aircraft to provide direct support for the Luzon invasion. The Mindoro airfields were also used by long-range bombers, especially USAAF B-24 Liberators, to attack Japanese shipping from Formosa to Luzon. These bombers also operated over the South China Sea, and combined with the Navy to blockade shipping between Japan and south-east Asia. References * Sandler, Stanley.

Robert Carradine made his film debut with fellow child actor Stephen Hudis as cowboys. It was filmed at various locations in New Mexico, Colorado, and at Warner Brothers Studio in Burbank, California. Based on the 1971 novel by William Dale Jennings, the screenplay was written by Irving Ravetch, Harriet Frank Jr., and Jennings and directed by Mark Rydell. The film is also notable for being one of the few in which John Wayne‚Äôs character is killed and the only one where he is killed by the main antagonist. Plot When his ranch hands abandon him to join a gold rush, aging rancher William ‚ÄòWil‚Äô Andersen (John Wayne) is forced to find replacement drovers for his upcoming long cattle drive. He rides into deserted Bozeman, Montana. There, his friend Anse Peterson (Slim Pickens) suggests using local schoolboys. Andersen visits the school but departs unconvinced by the boys' immature behavior. The next morning, the boys arrive at Andersen's ranch to volunteer for the drive. Andersen reluctantly tests the boys' ability to stay on a bucking horse. As the boys successfully take turns, Cimarron (A Martinez), another young man slightly older than the others, rides up. After successfully subduing and riding the test horse, Cimarron gets into a fight with Slim (Robert Carradine), the oldest of the boys, after Cimarron refers to Slim's mother as a prostitute. Andersen, though impressed by Cimarron's abilities, has misgivings because of his angry nature and sends him away. With no other options, Andersen decides to hire the boys. While Andersen and the boys prepare for the cattle drive, a group of mysterious men led by Asa \\"Long Hair\\" Watts (Bruce Dern) show up asking for work. Andersen catches Long Hair in a lie about his past and refuses to hire them. Jebediah \\"Jeb\\" Nightlinger (Roscoe Lee Browne), a Black camp cook arrives with a chuck wagon, making Anderson's trail crew complete. Under Andersen's continued tutelage, the boys learn to rope, as well as brand and herd the cattle and horses, and the group later officially sets off on the cattle drive. Much to Andersen's concern, Cimarron follows the drive from afar. However, while crossing a river, Slim slips off his horse and, unable to swim, starts to drown. Although Slim is saved by Cimarron, Andersen berates one of the boys, Bob, for his stuttering problem (which nearly caused Slim's death as he was unable to alert Andersen in time) and delivers an ultimatum to either quit stuttering immediately or else go back home alone. Bob then swears at Andersen repeatedly in anger and loses his stutter in the process. Satisfied, Andersen decides to let Cimarron and Bob stay. As the cattle drive progresses, the boys steal Nightlinger's whiskey and drink it, all of them getting severely drunk. Afterwards, one boy named Charlie falls off his horse and is trampled to death by the herd. Cimarron and another boy named Homer encounter a group of traveling prostitutes led by Madame Kate Collingwood but leave after Nightlinger intervenes. Slowly, the boys become rather good cowhands through their experiences and Andersen's guidance, impressing both Andersen and Nightlinger. Meanwhile, one of the boys, Dan, discovers a gang of cattle rustlers led by Long Hair are secretly following the herd from a distance but keeps quiet after Long Hair threatens to slit his throat if he says anything to Andersen. Soon after, the chuck wagon throws a wheel. While the rest of the boys continue to drive the herd, Nightlinger stays behind with Homer to fix the wagon. Long Hair then announces his presence to Andersen by openly paralleling the herd with his gang. Knowing the rustlers are after the herd, Andersen sends a boy named Weedy back to find Nightlinger, with instructions to make his way back to the herd with his rifle as soon as possible. When Nightlinger and Weedy don't show up several hours later, Andersen gathers the boys together and tells them that no matter what happens, if they act like boys and don‚Äôt resist, the rustlers should spare their lives. That night, Long Hair's gang surrounds Andersen and the boys in their camp with a captured and beaten Weedy. After forcing Andersen to surrender his gun, Long Hair announces his intention to steal the herd and taunts Dan and the rest of the boys, who follow Andersen's instructions and don‚Äôt resist. When Long Hair crushes Dan's glasses, Andersen intervenes and tells Long Hair his argument is with him and not the boys, leading to a brutal fist fight while the boys and the rustlers watch. Long Hair initially dominates the fight, but Andersen ultimately gains the upper hand by beating Long Hair repeatedly against a tree. An infuriated Long Hair then grabs a gun from one of his men and shoots the unarmed Andersen in both arms and the leg before shooting him twice more in the torso. The rustlers steal the herd and abandon the boys. The following morning, Nightlinger and Homer catch up to the group to find the boys tending to the dying Andersen. Before he dies, Andersen tells the boys with his last breaths how proud he is of all of them, that every man wants his children to be better than he was, and that they have become so. Following Andersen's funeral and on a prearranged signal, the boys overpower Nightlinger and seize the firearms stored in his chuck wagon, vowing to avenge Andersen's death and finish the trail drive as he hired them to do. When the group catches up to the herd and the rustlers, Nightlinger offers to help the boys make a plan to take back the herd. Using ruses and trickery, Nightlinger and the boys kill three of the outlaws and lure Long Hair and the rest of his gang into an ambush. In the ensuing shootout, all of the rustlers are killed while Long Hair finds his leg broken beneath his fallen horse and tangled up in the harness. Long Hair pleads for help from Dan, but Cimarron shoots a gun in the air that spooks the horse and drags the screaming Long Hair to his apparent death. After the boys complete the drive to Belle Fourche and sell the cattle, they use some of the proceeds to pay a stonemason to carve a marker with Andersen's name and the legend \\"Beloved Husband and Father\\", in clear reference to the position that Andersen had earned in their lives. They place the marker in the approximate location of Andersen's grave and head for home as the credits roll.

The film received praise for the musical score, original plot, and John Wayne's performance. In addition, several critics debated the film's implication that boys become men or confirm their manhood through acts of violence and vengeance. Jay Cocks of Time Magazine and Pauline Kael of The New York Times were especially critical of these aspects of the film. Film historian Emanuel Levy noted that Wayne frequently appears in a fatherlike role: > \\"Aware of his repetitive screen roles as a paternal figure, [Wayne] said the > movie was based on a formula that worked in Goodbye Mr. Chips and Sands of > Iwo Jima. In all three films, an adult takes a group of youngsters and > initiates them into manhood by instructing them the 'right' skills and > values. Wayne did not hesitate to appear in The Cowboys, despite the fact > that 'no actor in his right mind, would try to match the antics of eleven > kids on screen,' but for him it became 'the greatest experience of my > life.'\\"\\"The Cowboys: The Making of the John Wayne Western\\". emanuellevy.com; > Retrieved on 2014-05-17 from http://www.emanuellevy.com/comment/the-cowboys- > the-making-of-john-waynes-western-1/#sthash.bIL1BRPV.dpuf. The film won the Bronze Wrangler Award (best theatrical motion picture of the year) from the Western Heritage Awards. The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists: * 2005: AFI's 100 Years of Film Scores ‚Äì Nominated * 2006: AFI's 100 Years...100 Cheers ‚Äì Nominated Television adaptation In 1974, Warner Bros. developed The Cowboys as a television series for ABC starring Jim Davis, Diana Douglas, and Moses Gunn. David Dortort, best known for Bonanza, The High Chaparral, and The Restless Gun, produced the series. Only A Martinez, Robert Carradine, Sean Kelly and Clay O'Brien were in both the film and the television series; the first two reprised their roles from the film, but the latter two did not. At the last moment, ABC decided to change the show's format by reducing its run time from one hour to a half hour, a change which made it difficult to tell stories effectively with the show's large cast. Only 13 episodes were filmed before the series was cancelled.

Yuja tea is popular throughout Korea, especially in the winter. This tea is created by curing yuja into a sweet, thick, pulpy syrup. It does not contain caffeine. It is often sold in markets (in large jars) and used in households as a common cold remedy. Yuja tea is made from the fruit Yuja, citron, or Yuzu (in Japanese). These fruits do not contain much juices, unlike other citrus fruits. They are able to cook in high temperatures without losing its tart flavor. Yuja fruits have a strong fragrance. Its scent comes from the zest, juices, and essential oils. Yuja tea is both bitter and sweet. In addition, Yuja tea is a preservative, so it can be left out on a shelf or counter.  History  The history of the yuja tea took place in China, where it is known as youzi tea (ÊüöÂ≠êËå∂). A man was carrying a shipment of yuja trees from China to Korea until a storm came and hit his boat. The yuja trees were destroyed, but some of the seeds went into the man's coat. As the man continued on Korea's soil, the seeds fell on the ground and grew into yuja trees. Koreans saw the benefits the leaves had and used the yuja leaves for the common cold by crushing it. Because of its bitter taste, they began to preserve the leaves in sugar and honey, which later developed into the yuja tea. King Sejong, who was responsible for the creation of the Korean Hangul script, was its greatest advocate.  Names  Occasionally, the term yuja-cha can also be used to refer to the jarred yuja marmalade used to make the tea. The drink's name is sometimes translated into \\"citron tea\\" or \\"honey citron tea\\" in English, but yuja and citron are different citrus fruits.  Benefits  Yuja tea is well known for its health benefits, albeit medically unproven. It is said to have more vitamin C (2.3 times more) than raw lemon juice.https://advance.lexis.com/document/?pdmfid=1516831&crid;=075260e2-1017-4cbb-9bab- cd79f4d676c3&pddocfullpath;=/shared/document/news/urn:contentItem:5S92-X3M1-JDH3-S532-00000-00&pddocid;=urn:contentItem:5S92-X3M1-JDH3-S532-00000-00&pdcontentcomponentid;=438431&pdteaserkey;=sr1&pditab;=allpods&ecomp;=5ynk&earg;=sr1&prid;=7e83de79-3698-4846-b539-86e8f6eb6618 The vitamin C in yuja tea allegedly helps the immune system to fight against infections and other diseases/illnesses. Other various alleged health benefits include: * Common cold * Sore throats * Fever * Blood Circulation * Seasickness * Enhance skin complexion * Strengthen bones * Digestive problems, such as constipation and diarrhea * Lowering blood pressure * Improve discoloration  Preparation  Yuja tea can be made at home from scratch. The ingredients needed are citrus fruit (can be lemon or grapefruit) or yuja, honey, and sugar. The first step is thoroughly clean the fruits. Next, cut the yuja into thin slices and remove the seeds. Put the yuja slices into a bowl, and mix in the honey and sugar. Lastly, put the mixture in a container and store it in a cool, dark until the syrup is created (about six months). When ready, stir in 1-2 tablespoon of Yuja tea into hot water.

Its address was 231 N. Crawford Avenue, Chicago, Illinois. Located near the intersection of West Madison Street and Crawford (now Pulaski Road) in the West Garfield Park area of Chicago's West Side. History The Paradise Theatre was built by the Balaban and Katz chain of movie theaters and opened on September 14, 1928. It was promoted as the world's most beautiful theater for its stunning interior and exterior beauty. It is regarded as one of the finest designs by architect John Eberson, as the sheer opulence and intricate craftsmanship that went into the theater made it a showpiece in and of itself. Unfortunately, flaws in the design (blamed on the vast domed ceiling in the over 3,500-seat auditorium) were exposed with the advent of talking pictures. Poor acoustics eventually cost the theater its attendance as neighborhood movie-goers would eventually turn to the nearby Mark Brothers showplace, the Marbro Theatre. As a result, business at the Paradise never recovered. The Paradise Theatre's demise came in 1956, when Balaban and Katz closed the theater, demolished the building and sold the land to be developed as a supermarket. The theater that was \\"built to stand forever\\" almost lived up to that claim: what was estimated to have been a six-month demolition job ended up taking two years. Organ The Paradise Theatre was home to a large Wurlitzer theatre organ, catalog number Opus 1942. The organ console contained five manuals (keyboards), one of only three such instruments ever made by the Wurlitzer company. The organ, which had 21 ranks of pipes, was removed from the theater in 1948. It was installed in the Los Angeles home studio of Richard Vaughn, an executive at the Hi-Fi Records label.https://www.mmdigest.com/Archives/Digests/199901/1999.01.04.10.html The organ was utilized by Hi-Fi to record a series of noted stereo record albums in the 1950s featuring organist George Wright.https://www.mmdigest.com/Archives/Digests/199901/1999.01.04.11.html In 1969 the instrument was reinstalled in the Phoenix, Arizona home of William Brown. Brown enlarged the organ to 34 ranks. Since 2007, the organ has been in storage in Phoenix.http://database.organsociety.org/OrganDetails.php?OrganID=59362 Styx album Despite its financial issues, the Paradise Theatre remains a part of popular culture. Much of its notability is due to the Chicago-based rock band Styx's highly successful 1980 album Paradise Theatre. Lead singer and keyboardist Dennis DeYoung described the concept album as a fictional account of Chicago's Paradise Theatre from its opening to closing (and eventual abandonment), serving as a metaphor for changing times in America from the late 1970s into the 1980s.http://ultimateclassicrock.com/styx-paradise- theatre/ The theater on the album's cover art doesn't resemble the real Paradise Theatre, appearing closer to another 1920s Chicago movie palace, the Granada Theatre.

Its official name was Zeitschrift f√ºr vergleichende Sprachforschung auf dem Gebiete des Deutschen, Griechischen und Lateinischen from 1852 to 1874. For most of this period it ran in parallel to its sister publication Beitr√§ge zur vergleichenden Sprachforschung auf dem Gebiete der arischen, celtischen und slawischen Sprachen (known colloquially at Kuhn-Schleichlers Beitr√§ge), which existed from 1858 to 1876.R.D.

They are believed to be the spirits of ancestors of the people living there. Legend has it that they haunt the forest because they have some grudge to settle with the living and are generally quite vicious. Biloko live in the densest and darkest part of the rain forest in central Za√Øre, jealously and ferociously guarding their treasures: the game and the rare fruits of the forest. Only intrepid hunters are said to enter the deepest forest and survive, because in order to be successful, hunters have to possess strong magic, without which they would never see any game at all. There are many tales about wives who insist upon joining their husbands in the forest only to faint as soon as they see their first Eloko. The Biloko live in hollow trees and are dressed only in leaves. They have no hair; only grass grows on their bodies; they have piercing eyes, snouts with mouths that can be opened wide enough to admit a human body, alive or dead, and long, sharp claws. They possess little bells, which, in Central Africa are believed to be able to cast a spell on passers-by. Possessing an amulet or a fetish can offer protection from this type of magic. A typical Eloko tale: > One day a hunter took his wife, at her insistence, into the forest, where he > had a hut with a palisade around it. When he went out to inspect his traps, > he told her: \\"When you hear a bell, do not move. If you do, you will die!\\" > Soon after he had left, she heard the charming sound of a little bell coming > closer, for the Eloko has a good nose for feminine flesh.

And the matching principle instructs that an expense should be reported in the same period in which the corresponding revenue is earned, and is associated with accrual accounting. By recognizing costs in the period they are incurred, a business can see how much money was spent to generate revenue, reducing \\"noise\\" from timing mismatch between when costs are incurred and when revenue is realized. Conversely, cash basis accounting calls for the recognition of an expense when the cash is paid, regardless of when the expense was actually incurred.Accounting Principles by Wild, Shaw, Chiappetta If no cause-and-effect relationship exists (e.g., a sale is impossible), costs are recognized as expenses in the accounting period they expired: i.e., when have been used up or consumed (e.g., of spoiled, dated, or substandard goods, or not demanded services). Prepaid expenses are not recognized as expenses, but as assets until one of the qualifying conditions is met resulting in a recognition as expenses. Lastly, if no connection with revenues can be established, costs are recognized immediately as expenses (e.g., general administrative and research and development costs). Prepaid expenses, such as employee wages or subcontractor fees paid out or promised, are not recognized as expenses; they are considered assets because they will provide probable future benefits. As a prepaid expense is used, an adjusting entry is made to update the value of the asset. In the case of prepaid rent, for instance, the cost of rent for the period would be deducted from the Prepaid Rent account. Expense vs. cash timing Two types of balancing accounts exist to avoid fictitious profits and losses that might otherwise occur when cash is paid out not in the same accounting periods as expenses are recognized, because expenses are recognized when obligations are incurred regardless when cash is paid out according to the matching principle in accrual accounting. Cash can be paid out in an earlier or later period than obligations are incurred (when goods or services are received) and related expenses are recognized that results in the following two types of accounts: * Accrued expense: Expense is recognized before cash is paid out. * Deferred expense: Expense is recognized after cash is paid out. Accrued expenses is a liability with an uncertain timing or amount, but where the uncertainty is not significant enough to qualify it as a provision. An example is an obligation to pay for goods or services received from a counterpart, while cash for them is to be paid out in a later accounting period when its amount is deducted from accrued expenses. It shares characteristics with deferred income (or deferred revenue) with the difference that a liability to be covered latter is cash received from a counterpart, while goods or services are to be delivered in a latter period, when such income item is earned, the related revenue item is recognized, and the same amount is deducted from deferred revenues. Deferred expenses (or prepaid expenses or prepayment) is an asset, such as cash paid out TO a counterpart for goods or services to be received in a latter accounting period when fulfilling the promise to pay is actually acknowledged, the related expense item is recognized, and the same amount is deducted from prepayments. It shares characteristics with accrued revenue (or accrued assets) with the difference that an asset to be covered latter are proceeds from a delivery of goods or services, at which such income item is earned and the related revenue item is recognized, while cash for them is to be received in a later period, when its amount is deducted from accrued revenues. Examples * Accrued expense allows one to match future costs of products with the proceeds from their sales prior to paying out such costs. * Deferred expense (prepaid expense) allows one to match costs of products paid out and not received yet. * Depreciation matches the cost of purchasing fixed assets with revenues generated by them by spreading such costs over their expected life. =Accrued expenses= For example, goods supplied by a vendor in one accounting period, but paying for them in a later period results in an accrued expense that prevents a fictitious increase in the receiving company's value equal to the increase in its inventory (assets) by the cost of the goods received, but unpaid. Without such accrued expense, a sale of such goods in the period they were supplied would cause that the unpaid inventory (recognized as an expense fictitiously incurred) would effectively offset the sale proceeds (revenue) resulting in a fictitious profit in the period of sale, and in a fictitious loss in the latter period of payment, both equal to the cost of goods sold. Period costs, such as office salaries or selling expenses, are immediately recognized as expenses (and offset against revenues of the accounting period) also when employees are paid in the next period. Unpaid period costs are accrued expenses (liabilities) to avoid such costs (as expenses fictitiously incurred) to offset period revenues that would result in a fictitious profit. An example is a commission earned at the moment of sale (or delivery) by a sales representative who is compensated at the end of the following week, in the next accounting period. The company recognizes the commission as an expense incurred immediately in its current income statement to match the sale proceeds (revenue), so the commission is also added to accrued expenses in the sale period to prevent it from otherwise becoming a fictitious profit, and it is deducted from accrued expenses in the next period to prevent it from otherwise becoming a fictitious loss, when the rep is compensated. =Deferred expenses= A Deferred expense (prepaid expenses or prepayment) is an asset used to costs paid out and not recognized as expenses according to the matching principle. For example, when the accounting periods are monthly, an 11/12 portion of an annually paid insurance cost is added to prepaid expenses, which are decreased by 1/12 of the cost in each subsequent period when the same fraction is recognized as an expense, rather than all in the month in which such cost is billed. The not-yet-recognized portion of such costs remains as prepayments (assets) to prevent such cost from turning into a fictitious loss in the monthly period it is billed, and into a fictitious profit in any other monthly period. Similarly, cash paid out for (the cost of) goods and services not received by the end of the accounting period is added to the prepayments to prevent it from turning into a fictitious loss in the period cash was paid out, and into a fictitious profit in the period of their reception. Such cost is not recognized in the income statement (profit and loss or P&L;) as the expense incurred in the period of payment, but in the period of their reception when such costs are recognized as expenses in P&L; and deducted from prepayments (assets) on balance sheets. =Depreciation= Depreciation is used to distribute the cost of the asset over its expected life span according to the matching principle. If a machine is bought for $100,000, has a life span of 10 years, and can produce the same amount of goods each year, then $10,000 of the cost (i.e. $100,000/10 years) of the machine is matched to each year, rather than charging $100,000 in the first year and nothing in the next 9 years. So, the cost of the machine is offset against the sales in that year. This matches costs to sales and therefore gives a more accurate representation of the business, but results in a temporary discrepancy between profit/loss and the cash position of the business.

In July 2002 the label was founded and co-owned by John Butler; The Waifs' members Josh Cunningham, Donna Simpson, and her sister Vikki Thorn; and the artists' common manager, Philip Stevens. Initially it was established to handle their releases for the territory of the United States by 2003 it expanded . History Jarrah Records' founders are John Butler (leader of John Butler Trio); The Waifs' band members Josh Cunningham, Donna Simpson, and her sister Vikki Thorn; and the artists' common manager, Philip Stevens. The label was established in Fremantle in July 2002, initially, to release John Butler Trio and The Waif's material into the United States market. The Waifs had formed in 1992 as a folk rock band in Albany by Cunningham, Simpson and Thorn. Butler initially performed as a busker in Fremantle in mid-1996. Since the mid-1980s Stevens was involved in the local music scene, he became a music promoter and by 1996 was the owner of Mojo's Bar in North Fremantle. In 1998 Stevens gave Butler a regular Tuesday night gig at his venue and soon became the artist's manager. Also that year Butler formed his trio as a roots and jam band. In 2001 The Waifs hired Stevens as their manager. In the following year both groups were due to tour the US and wanted to release material into that market on their own independent label. Jarrah Records re-issued The Waifs third studio album, Sink or Swim, into the US ‚Äì it had appeared in Australia in June 2000. The group's first new work for Jarrah was a five-track extended play, London Still, released in July 2002, which reached the top 50 on the ARIA Singles Chart. In October London Still received two nominations at the ARIA Music Awards of 2002 for 'Best Independent Release' and 'Breakthrough Artist ‚Äì Single'. In February the following year John Butler Trio issued a 2√ó CD live album, Living 2001‚Äì2002, on the label for the Australian market. It peaked at No. 6 on the ARIA Albums Chart. According to The Ages Patrick Donovan by March 2004 John Butler Trio and The Waifs had \\"proved that mainstream airplay and huge sales are not reliant on the backing of a big record company\\". The label continued to issue work by both acts, including subsequent solo material from Butler and Cunningham.

In books and journal articles, she challenged Christian orthodoxy, espousing the view that new findings present alternative answers to its supernatural beliefs. Her analysis has been rejected by both New Testament scholars and scholars in Judaism. Background Born in Sydney, Australia, as Barbara Houlsby, she married Barry Thiering in the late 1940s. She graduated in 1952 from the University of Sydney with First Class Honours in Modern Languages, was a high school teacher of languages for several years, and then, while caring for her three young children, continued study and research privately. She obtained an external B.D. degree from the University of London, a M.Th. degree from Melbourne College of Divinity, and a Ph.D. degree from the University of Sydney in 1973. Pesher technique Thiering claimed to have discovered, from her specialty study of the pesharim of the Dead Sea Scrolls (DDS), their semiotics, and their hermeneutics, a \\"pesher technique\\" for decoding the New Testament stories. Whereas Qumran-style pesher of the DDS decodes ancient prophetic writings to find contemporary apocalyptic meanings, Thiering's \\"pesher technique\\" claims that the gospel writers encoded contemporary facts in miracle stories to be told in the future. She also claims that the early Christian Church was a natural development of \\"Sons of Light\\" of the Qumram community. The theory argues that the miracles, including turning water into wine, the virgin birth, healing a man at a distance, the man who had been thirty-eight years at the pool, and the resurrection, among others, did not actually occur (as miracles), as Christians believe, nor were they legends, as some skeptics hold, but were \\"deliberately constructed myths\\"Jesus the Man, p. 46. concealing (yet, to certain initiates, relating) esoteric historic events. She alleges that they never actually happened (that is, that the events they chronicle were not at all miraculous), as the authors of the Gospels knew. According to her interpretation, the pesher style of interpretation used by the Qumran community was also used by the authors of the Gospels; thus, they wrote on two levels. For the \\"babes in Christ,\\" there were apparent miracles, but the knowledge of exact meanings held by the highly educated members of Gnostic schools gave a real history of what Jesus actually did. Work In view of her research publications in academic journals, she was invited to lecture at Sydney University, at first in the Department of Semitic Studies, then in the School of Divinity (now the Department of Religious Studies) where she continued until her retirement. During this time she was a member of the Board of Studies in Divinity and the Board of Continuing Education, and served for twelve years as a lay member of the New South Wales Equal Opportunity Tribunal. When her work became known in the United States, she was made a fellow of the Jesus Seminar. In 1990 a documentary film about her research, Riddle of the Dead Sea Scrolls, was shown by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.  Academic reception  Thiering's thesis attracted some controversy in the media when Jesus the Man was published in 1990, and her ideas have not received acceptance by many of her academic peers. In a response to a letter Thiering wrote to The New York Review of Books objecting to a review by G√©za Vermes, Vermes outlined the academic reception of her work stating: > \\"Professor Barbara Thiering's reinterpretation of the New Testament, in > which the married, divorced, and remarried Jesus, father of four, becomes > the \\"Wicked Priest\\" of the Dead Sea Scrolls, has made no impact on learned > opinion. Scroll scholars and New Testament experts alike have found the > basis of the new theory, Thiering's use of the so-called \\"pesher technique\\", > without substance.\\"The New York Review of Books, December 1st, 1994. In 1993 N. T. Wright, New Testament historian and former Bishop of Durham, wrote: > It is safe to say that no serious scholar has given this elaborate and > fantastic theory any credence whatsoever. It is nearly ten years since it > was published; the scholarly world has been able to take a good look at it: > and the results are totally negative. James F. McGrath, an Associate Professor in the Religion and Philosophy department at Butler University in his 1996 review of the book states that Thiering's thesis lacks proof, and that she herself acknowledges that the pesher of the Revelation of St. John is her own composition.James F. McGrath. \\"Review of Barbara Thiering, 'Jesus of the Apocalypse. The Life of Jesus after the Crucifixion'\\" Qumran Chronicle Jan. 1996: 170-172.

Primerica, Inc. is a United States- based multi-level marketing company that sells insurance and financial services. The company's headquarters are located in Duluth, Georgia. Business model Primerica, Inc. is an insurance and financial services company that uses multi-level marketing to sell financial products and services. Headquartered in unincorporated Gwinnett County, Georgia,\\"Duluth city, Georgia .\\" U.S. Census Bureau. Retrieved on July 6, 2011.\\"Contact Us.\\" Primerica. Retrieved on March 16, 2017. \\"Corporate Address Primerica, Inc. #1 Primerica Parkway, Duluth, GA 30099 United States\\" Primerica spun off from its former parent company Citigroup through an initial public offering on April 1, 2010. Primerica reported having 120,000 independent representatives in 2017,Primerica's History, http://www.primerica.com/public/our-history.html through Primerica's securities broker-dealer affiliate PFS Investments, Inc. in the United States, and through PFSL Investments Canada Ltd. in Canada. The company primarily sells term life insurance, as well as mutual funds, annuities, segregated funds, managed accounts, long-term care insurance, pre- paid legal services, auto insurance, home insurance, credit monitoring and debt management plans. Primerica was listed by Forbes as one of \\"Americas 50 Most Trustworthy Financial Companies\\" in 2015 but was not included in the 2017 list. Founding A.L. Williams & Associates (A.L. Williams), the progenitor of Primerica, was founded in 1977 by Arthur L. Williams Jr. The company employed a mass-marketing concept of \\"buy term and invest the difference\\", to illustrate how its mostly middle-income client base could purchase sufficient protection with term life insurance and systematically save and invest in separate investment vehicles, such as mutual fund Individual Retirement Accounts. A.L. Williams was established as a privately held general agency, at first selling term life insurance policies underwritten by Financial Assurance, Inc. (FAI). In 1980, A.L. Williams entered into a contract with Boston-based Massachusetts Indemnity and Life Insurance Company (MILICO), a larger underwriter of life insurance and a subsidiary of Santa Monica-based PennCorp Financial Services. In 1981, the company established First American National Corporation (later renamed The A.L. Williams Corporation) as a holding company for First American Life Insurance (later renamed A.L. Williams Life Insurance Company) and First American National Securities (later renamed PFS Investments, Inc). In 1982, The A.L. Williams Corporation (ALWC) underwrote a public stock offering, listed in the Over the Counter (OTC) market under the symbol ALWC. In 1983, the company became listed on the NASDAQ exchange under the same symbol. PennCorp finalized a merger agreement with American Can Company in 1983, and became its subsidiary along with MILICO. In 1986 Triangle Industries bought American Can's packaging division and the rights to the company's name, and in 1987 American Can announced that it would change its 86-year-old name to Primerica Corporation, giving birth to the name \\"Primerica.\\" Mergers and acquisitions =Acquisition by Commercial Credit= After encountering legal and cultural roadblocks to expanding outside the United States, ALWC began selling the insurance products of Pennsylvania Life Insurance Company, a Primerica subsidiary, in Canada in 1986. Primerica announced in May 1987 that it intended to purchase Wall Street brokerage firm Smith Barney for $750 million and move into the financial services sector. On November 30, 1988, ALWC acquired MILICO from Primerica Corporation through a stock merger acquisition for 44.58 million shares of ALWC stock, making Primerica Corporation the majority shareholder of ALWC. In December 1988, Sanford Weill's Commercial Credit acquired Primerica Corporation for $1.54 billion, retaining the Primerica name. At this time, the major businesses under Primerica Corporation were A.L. Williams, Smith Barney and Commercial Credit. On February 6, 1989, Primerica Corporation began trading on the New York Stock Exchange. =Travelers and Citigroup era= In November 1989, Primerica purchased the remaining 30% of ALWC that it did not previously own and the privately held General Agent, A.L. Williams, Inc. In 1991, Primerica Corporation changed the name of A.L. Williams to Primerica Financial Services. The following year MILICO, Primerica's life insurance underwriter, changed its name to Primerica Life Insurance Company, and its broker-dealer FANS changed to PFS Investments, Inc. In December 1993, Primerica acquired the remaining 73% of Travelers Insurance Corporation and adopted the name Travelers Inc., which was changed to Travelers Group the following year. Travelers Group included Primerica Financial Services, Smith Barney, Travelers Life and Annuity, Travelers Property/Casualty, Commercial Credit and other financial businesses. Joe Plumeri was Chairman and CEO of Primerica Financial Services from 1995 to 1999. In 1998, Primerica had net income of $398 million on net sales of $1.65 billion, compared to a 1994 $209 million net income on net sales of $1.28 billion. In December 1997, Primerica announced it was going to begin offering pre-paid legal through Pre-Paid Legal Services, Inc., at the time both subsidiaries of Travelers Group, Inc. In 1998, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) censured and fined PFS Investments Inc., the securities arm for Primerica, for failure to properly supervise a group of registered representatives in Dearborn, Michigan. The SEC found that PFS Investments Inc. had failed to have in place effective policies and procedures to follow up adequately on three complaints received about the Dearborn registered representatives, \\"selling away\\" activities. Prior to the SEC's ruling, PFS Investments Inc. hired an independent consultant to review its supervisory and compliance policies and procedures to prevent and detect violations of the federal securities laws. By the date of the ruling, PFS Investments reported it had complied with the final recommendations made by the independent consultant.SEC Release No.40269 - July 28, 1998 In 1998, Travelers Group and banking giant Citicorp merged creating Citigroup (). Primerica and its affiliates continued to operate as subsidiaries of Citigroup, although the Travelers insurance business was spun off in 2002. Along with Primerica, other major brand names under Citigroup included Citibank, CitiFinancial, Citicorp Trust Bank, Smith Barney, and Banamex. John Addison and Rick Williams were hired as co-CEOs in 2000, and Glen J. Williams was promoted to President in 2005. =Separation from Citi= Citigroup attempted to sell Primerica in 2008, having received several bids from life insurance companies and private equity firms interested in buying. At the time the market value of the company was estimated to be $7 billion, roughly 15 times its annual earnings and Citi was trying to match various bidders in groups that could bid for the unit together. Initially, a sale to JC Flowers & Co. LLC and Protective Life Corp was underway until the deal was canceled last minute for publicly undisclosed reasons. In May 2009 the Primerica executive team led by co-CEOs John Addison and Rick Williams approached private equity firm J.C. Flowers & Co. yet again, as well as Blackstone Group LP and TPG Inc in a new attempt to sell the company, a plan which Citigroup did not endorse. =Initial public offering= On November 5, 2009 Citi announced that it intended to spin off Primerica through an initial public offering. The first trading occurred on April 1, 2010. The expected share price was in the $12 ‚Äì $14 range, and ended up priced at $15 a share on March 31, 2010, resulting in Citi raising 27 percent or $30 million more than $290 million projected through the IPO by selling 3.36 million more shares than the anticipated 18 million. The first day of trading saw the stock surge 31 percent to close at $19.65 a share. In a separate offering, private equity firm Warburg Pincus bought 17.2 million shares, resulting in a 23 percent stake in Primerica, and up to 33 percent if Warburg decides to exercise warrants to purchase an additional 4.3 million shares from Citi. Following the IPO, Citi's stake was between 32 percent and 46 percent and expected to divest its interest in Primerica \\"as soon as possible\\" to fulfill its original goal of raising cash by shedding assets to improve financial performance. On December 19, 2011, Citigroup sold its remaining equity stake in Primerica (approximately 8 million shares of Primerica's common stock), completing the separation from Citi. Sales force A Primerica convention in 2007. In Primerica's eleven- tiered multilevel-marketing system, the company's sales representatives receive a commission for selling financial products, while a portion of the sale is also paid to the representative's recruiter, the recruiter's recruiter, and so on, up to eleven levels. Sales agents are tasked with selling the company's products to a \\"warm market‚Äù including their family and friends. As of 2010, Primerica required its sales representatives to pay a $25 monthly fee, and it is estimated that these fees netted the company revenue of $2.5 million per month from its own employees. In 2010, Primerica was reported to have over 100,000 representatives selling the company's financial products, with individual earnings averaging $5,156 per year. More than 190,000 new sales recruits paid a fee to sign up for Primerica in 2014, but the company only boosted its total licensed sales force by 3,700 that year, and each member of the sales team earned an average of $6,030. As of September 2017, the company reported having 124,436 independent representatives. In October 2015, James Wilcox, a school district superintendent in Longview, Texas and other Primerica representatives were censured by the Longview school district for holding Primerica recruitment pitch meetings at a local high school. The meetings generated numerous complaints and violated the school district's employee policy manual . The district's school board banned Primerica from Longview ISD campuses and directed Wilcox to \\"not allow any meetings of this type on any LISD property in the future\\". In 2017 a freshman student at Brooklyn College alleged that Primerica representatives tried to recruit him on Brooklyn's campus, in violation of the college's rules. A warning was issued to Brooklyn College Public Safety shortly after an inquiry on the matter. A representative from Primerica alleged that the discussion did not occur on Brooklyn's campus, but rather, occurred \\"on the corner near the elementary school‚Äîin the area around the high school and middle school\\", with the representative adding that \\"there might have been some new volunteers on the campus, but it was not me.\\" In 2017, registered investment adviser Mike Lundy, a representative of Primerica and manager of its Rapid City, SD office, was sentenced to 5 years in federal prison after pocketing $4.2 million in clients‚Äô money. Lundy pleaded guilty to wire fraud and filing a false tax return. He admitted encouraging clients to put money into a fake investment company from the early 2000s to 2014, depositing the money in his bank account. Lundy was ordered by the court to pay back $1.3 million owed to the victims and to pay taxes owed to the Internal Revenue Service. 2012 Florida lawsuit and settlement In 2012, Primerica was the target of multiple lawsuits alleging that the company's representatives sought to profit by earning commissions after convincing Florida firefighters, teachers and other public workers to divest from safe government-secured retirement investments to inappropriate high-risk retirement products offered by Primerica. In January 2014, the company set aside $15.4 million to settle allegations involving 238 cases.

Description At Flat Rock Brook Nature Center, New Jersey, United States Its wingspan ranges from .Great Spangled Fritillary, Butterflies of Canada It is characterized by its orange color above with five black dashes near forewing base and several irregular black dashes at the base of the hindwing. In addition, two rows of black crescents run along the edges of the wings. Below, the forewing is yellowish orange with black marks similar to the upperside, with a few silver spots on the tip of the wing. The hindwing is reddish brown with silver spots on the base and middle of the wing. A broad yellow band and silver triangles are the most notable qualities on the wing, next to the brown margin. Females tend to be darker than males and individuals from the western reaches of this species range tend to be brighter orange. Similar species include the Aphrodite fritillary (Speyeria aphrodite), the Atlantis fritillary (Speyeria atlantis) and the northwestern fritillary (Speyeria hesperis). It is distinguished from the Aphrodite and Atlantis fritillaries by a wide light submarginal band on the hindwing and instead of black spots, black dashes form on the margins of the forewing.

As a sequel Super Contra, it is the first portable installment in the Contra series and features gameplay and graphics similar to the Nintendo Entertainment System versions of Contra and Super Contra. Gameplay The game has a total of five stages, many of which share design similarities to Super C (the NES version of Super Contra). The three odd-numbered stages (1, 3, and 5) are played from a side-view perspective, while the two even-numbered ones (2 and 4) are top-view. The soundtrack consists primarily of arranged background music from the original Contra, with the exception of a few tunes (namely the Area 2 theme, the Stage Select theme, the sub-boss theme in Area 3, and the ending theme). Operation C was the first Contra game to feature auto-fire as a default feature, resulting in the removal of the Machine Gun power-up from previous games. The Laser Rifle is also removed, leaving only the Spread Shot and Fire Gun from Super C. However, the game introduces a new Homing Gun that fires bullets that chase after enemies. The Spread Shot starts out as a three-way shot, but it can be upgraded to a five-way version after picking it up a second time. Unlike Super C, the Fire Gun does not have chargeable shots, while the Barrier and Rapid Bullets power-ups are not featured in this installment either. Plot The player takes the role of Bill Rizer, who must neutralize an enemy force that is secretly storing an alien cell in their base. As with the previous Contra games for the NES, the exact details of the game's settings varies between supplemental materials: in the Japanese version, the enemies are identified as the army of an unnamed hostile nation that is seeking to use an alien cell to produce weapons; in the American version, the enemies are working for an alien entity calling itself \\"Black Viper\\". Likewise, the main character's identity was changed from Bill (the Player 1 character from the previous arcade and console games) to Lance (the Player 2 character from the previous installments as well).The Database mode of Contra: Shattered Soldier uses the original Japanese plot of the game (as with other Contra games released up to that point), whereas the instruction manual for the American developed Contra 4 reinterprets the events of Operation C as a previous mission of Mad Dog and Scorpion (the two new characters of Contra 4) against the alien invader Black Viper. Versions and re-releases The Japanese version, simply titled Contra, allows the player to begin the game at any of the first four stages. The American version only allows the Stage Select feature to be available by inputting the Konami Code. While the rest of the game was left unchanged for the American version, the plot of the game as featured in the manual was altered for the American localization (as detailed above). The European version, Probotector, changed the main character and some of the enemies into robots, much like the European localizations of the NES installments. Operation C is included in the Game Boy compilation Konami GB Collection Vol. 1 released in 1997 in Japan and in 2000 in Europe. The Japanese version is identical to the original release, but with added Super Game Boy border support. While the version of the game included with the European compilation is titled Probotector, it retains the original human characters from the Japanese release and adds full Game Boy Color support. The game is included in the 2019 Contra Anniversary Collection for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and Steam. Reception Nintendo Life gave the game an 8/10 score, praising the gameplay, controls, enemies, weapons and music, while suggesting that the game borrowed from Super C a bit too much. It also criticized the game's lack of multiplayer option.

The condition is most likely to affect pilots of high performance fighter and aerobatic aircraft or astronauts but is possible on some extreme amusement park rides. G-LOC incidents have caused fatal accidents in high performance aircraft capable of sustaining high g for extended periods. High-G training for pilots of high performance aircraft or spacecraft often includes ground training for G-LOC in special centrifuges, with some profiles exposing pilots to 9 gs for a sustained period. Effects of g-forces A simulation of the effects of g-forces on humans. As time progresses, tunnel vision occurs and nearly progresses to complete blackout. Under increasing positive g-force, blood in the body will tend to move from the head toward the feet. For higher intensity or longer duration, this can manifest progressively as: * Tunnel vision ‚Äì loss of peripheral vision, retaining only the center vision * Greyout ‚Äì a loss of color vision * Blackout ‚Äì a complete loss of vision but retaining consciousness. * G-LOC ‚Äì where consciousness is lost. Under negative g, blood pressure will increase in the head, running the risk of the dangerous condition known as redout, with too much blood pressure in the head and eyes. Because of the high level of sensitivity that the eye‚Äôs retina has to hypoxia, symptoms are usually first experienced visually. As the retinal blood pressure decreases below globe pressure (usually 10‚Äì21 mm Hg), blood flow begins to cease to the retina, first affecting perfusion farthest from the optic disc and retinal artery with progression towards central vision. Skilled pilots can use this loss of vision as their indicator that they are at maximum turn performance without losing consciousness. Recovery is usually prompt following removal of g-force but a period of several seconds of disorientation may occur. Absolute incapacitation is the period of time when the aircrew member is physically unconscious and averages about 12 seconds. Relative incapacitation is the period in which the consciousness has been regained, but the person is confused and remains unable to perform simple tasks. This period averages about 15 seconds. Upon regaining cerebral blood flow, the G-LOC victim usually experiences myoclonic convulsions (often called the ‚Äòfunky chicken‚Äô) and often full amnesia of the event is experienced.http://goflightmedicine.com/pulling-gs/ Brief but vivid dreams have been reported to follow G-LOC. If G-LOC occurs at low altitude, this momentary lapse can prove fatal and even highly experienced pilots can pull straight to a G-LOC condition without first perceiving the visual onset warnings that would normally be used as the sign to back off from pulling any more gs. The human body is much more tolerant of g-force when it is applied laterally (across the body) than when applied longitudinally (along the length of the body). Unfortunately most sustained g-forces incurred by pilots is applied longitudinally. This has led to experimentation with prone pilot aircraft designs which lies the pilot face down or (more successfully) reclined positions for astronauts. Thresholds The g thresholds at which these effects occur depend on the training, age and fitness of the individual. An un-trained individual not used to the G-straining manoeuvre can black out between 4 and 6 g, particularly if this is pulled suddenly. A trained, fit individual wearing a g suit and practicing the straining manoeuvre can, with some difficulty, sustain up to 12-14g without loss of consciousness. The \\"Blue Angels\\" have to perform their maneuvers without the aid of flight-suits, and regularly sustain 3‚Äì5 second bursts of 10 g thresholds.

It is a major east‚Äìwest corridor connecting the Twin Cities and the Chippewa Valley with Wausau and Green Bay. A multi-year project to upgrade the corridor to a four-lane freeway or expressway from Elk Mound to Green Bay was completed in 2005. The expansion served to improve safety on the route, which was over capacity as a two-lane road. The remainder of WIS 29 is two-lane surface road or urban multi-lane road.  Route description  = Prescott to Elk Mound = WIS 29 begins at its western terminus at U.S. Highway 10 (US 10), on the north side of Prescott. From this point, WIS 29 follows WIS 35 northeast to River Falls, passing the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìRiver Falls campus. At the junction with WIS 65, WIS 35 turns northbound with WIS 65 while WIS 29 continues east. WIS 29 joins briefly with US 63 west of Spring Valley and turns eastbound upon its split south to head into Spring Valley. Upon leaving Spring Valley and Pierce County, Wisconsin, the highway heads northwardward into St. Croix County and turns east towards Menomonie. WIS 29 does not pass through any municipalities while in this county, but it does cross WIS 128. Upon entering Dunn County, the route passes through rural terrain and enters Menomonie's west side as Hudson Road. The highway turns northward onto Main Street and passes west and north of the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìStout campus. WIS 29 turns east onto Stout Road along with US 12 and leaves the city to the east. US 12/WIS 29 proceeds east for about and junctions with Interstate 94 (I-94). This interchange is the westernmost point of the multi-lane WIS 29 corridor. It is also the westernmost point of WIS 29 as a backbone route in Corridors 2020. = Elk Mound to Wausau = West of County Highway T (CTH-T), the highway is an expressway. It passes into the Chippewa Valley metropolitan area and south of Chippewa Falls as a freeway and crosses US 53 at a cloverleaf interchange in Lake Hallie. WIS 29 junctions with the southern terminus of WIS 178 southeast of Chippewa Falls then passes to the south of Lake Wissota State Park before crossing under WIS 27 in Cadott. WIS 29 passes south of Boyd and Stanley before exiting the county to the east. In Clark County, WIS 29 meets WIS 73 in Thorp. The two highways run concurrently and exit the village to the east, and WIS 73 splits to the south in Withee about east. WIS 29 continues east and passes south of Owen and Curtiss. At Abbotsford, WIS 29 and WIS 13 meet at a partial cloverleaf interchange between Abbotsford and Colby on the Clark‚ÄìMarathon county line. east of Abbotsford, WIS 29 and WIS 97 meet at a diamond interchange. This is a key route for travelers between Wausau and Marshfield. East of this junction, WIS 29 follows a straight course that passes Edgar and meets WIS 107 at a diamond interchange on the north side of Marathon City, approximately west of Wausau. WIS 29 enters Wausau as a freeway, junctions with the western terminus of WIS 52 approximately west of US 51 at an eastbound off/westbound on style half-interchange. WIS 29 then immediately enters the new US 51 interchange, and turns south onto and follows US 51 for , bypassing the downtown area to the south. = Wausau to Green Bay = WIS 29 interchange on I-39 and US 51 South of Wausau, WIS 29 turns off US 51 to the east at the northern terminus of I-39 and continues as freeway, passing through the villages of Rothschild and Weston. The freeway section ends at Ringle. As an expressway, the highway passes just south of Hatley and turns southeast for about four miles (6 km) before turning east again at the northern terminus of WIS 49. The highway enters Shawano County about east of this junction. WIS 29 passes north and around Wittenberg. US 45 joins with the highway north of Wittenberg and the two routes run concurrently to where US 45 splits to the south at about east of the village. WIS 29 bypasses Tilleda and Thornton on the way towards Shawano. At Shawano, the expressway becomes a freeway at the junction with CTH-MMM (WIS 29 Business) and turns southeast to bypass Shawano to the south, diamond interchanges link the highway with WIS 22 and WIS 47 north/WIS 55 north as it pass south of the city. WIS 47 south and WIS 55 south follow WIS 29 east. WIS 47 splits to the south at the diamond interchange junction with WIS 117 south of Bonduel. WIS 29 (along with WIS 55) then returns to an expressway at the junction with CTH-BE (WIS 29's former route). WIS 55 splits to the south at the diamond interchange junction with WIS 160 at Angelica and WIS 29 heads southeast to the Brown County line. Flyovers completed at WIS 29-US 41 interchange in 2014 as part of the US 41 project About into Brown County, WIS 29 collects WIS 32 eastbound at the diamond interchange with WIS 156 and CTH-Y. WIS 29 very briefly passes through the northeast corner of Outagamie County and enters the village of Howard. The multilane expressway and the Backbone Corridor route end at Interstate 41/US 41. WIS 32 turns south onto I-41/US 41 as WIS 29 continues into Green Bay as Shawano Avenue. = Green Bay to Kewaunee = Eastern terminus in Kewaunee In downtown Green Bay, WIS 29 turns north onto South Monroe Avenue for four blocks, joining with WIS 54 and turns east onto Main Street, splitting from WIS 54 and joining US 141 to leave the city to the southeast. The highways pass over I-43 without an interchange. WIS 29 splits to the east from US 141 at about north of US 's southern terminus at I-43 in Bellevue. This provides the only access from I-43 to WIS 29\\\\. The highway passes through Poland and Henrysville as it exits Brown County to the east. In Kewaunee County, WIS 29 passes due east through Pilsen and north of Krok as a two-lane road. The highway ends in downtown Kewaunee at WIS 42 on the shores of Lake Michigan.  History  Prior to 1926, WIS 29 was numbered WIS 116 from Minnesota to Chippewa Falls, WIS 16 from Chippewa Falls to Bellevue, and WIS 146 from Bellevue to Kewaunee. WIS 16 continued southeast from Bellevue along what became US 141 in 1926 to Manitowoc. What had been WIS 29 before 1926 became US 16 across the state. WIS 29 has long been known as \\"Bloody 29\\" because of the prevalence of grisly fatal traffic crashes along significant portions of the highway. In 1988, a study was commissioned to examine upgrading the highway to a four-lane divided highway. The changes would be made along of road from I-94, west of Elk Mound, to US 41 in Howard (suburban Green Bay). The final segment of the highway, connecting the east side of Chippewa Falls with the segment running north of Eau Claire, was opened to traffic on August 16, 2005. Of the total length, about of the highway meets Interstate Highway standards. Most of the expansion was completed with only minor additions to the already- existing easements, and as a result, the expanded roadway almost exactly matches the highway's original course. The portion of WIS 29 between Chippewa Falls and Abbotsford roughly follows what used to be the Yellowstone Trail. Future Long range plans call for WIS 29 to be converted to a full freeway between I-94 in Elk Mound and I-41 in Green Bay, however, there is no timetable for the entire corridor to be completed.

It is the administrative headquarters of the district. The city is on the bank of the river Hathmati. History Himatnagar was founded in 1426 by Ahmed Shah I of Gujarat Sultanate and named it Ahmednagar after himself. He founded the town to keep Raos of Idar State in check. It is said that he was so fond of the place that he thought of making it, instead of Ahmedabad, the capital of Gujarat Sultanate. When the Rao dynasty took Idar in 1728, Ahmednagar soon fell into their hands. After the death of Maharaja Shivsing, in 1792, his brother Sangramsing took Ahmednagar and the country around; and, in spite of the efforts of his nephew Gambhirsing, became an independent chief. Sangramsing was succeeded by his son Karansing. The later died in 1835, and Erskine, the British Agent, who was in the neighbourhood with a force, moved to Ahmednagar to prevent the queens from becoming satis. The sons of the deceased Maharaja begged Erskine not to interfere with their customs. Finding him resolved to prevent the sati practice, while pretending to negotiate, they secretly summoned the Bhils and other turbulent tribes, and in the night, opening a way through the fort wall to the river bed, the queens burnt themselves with their deceased husband. The sons of the deceased Maharaja fled, but subsequently gave themselves up, and, after entering into an engagement with the British Government, Takhtsing was allowed to succeed his father as Maharaja of Ahmednagar. Some years later he was chosen to fill the vacant throne of Jodhpur State. He tried to keep Ahmednagar and its dependencies, but, after a long discussion, it was, in 1848, ruled that Ahmednagar should revert to Idar State. In 1912, the town was renamed Ahmednagar to Himatnagar after prince Himmat Singh by Sir Pratap Singh, the Maharaja of Idar. The state was under Mahi Kantha Agency during British rule which subsequently became part of Western India States Agency. Among various old businesses with relevance to history of Himatnagar, Himat Vijay Printing Press (established in 1931) was named after King Himat Singh and was owned and operated by Late Shri Chhotalal Narsinhdas Shah (and his family still runs it) and he was longest servicing President of Himantagar Panchyant before it became municipality. The main road through City across to Municipal office has been named as C N Shah Road and parallel road has been named after famous Dr Nalinkant Gandhi, as Dr Nalinkant Gandhi Road. Municipal Town Hall has also been named as \\"Dr Nalinkant Gandhi Town Hall\\". After independence of India in 1947, Idar State was merged with Union of India. From 1947 to 1956, it was a part of Bombay State as Idar district. Himatnagar was the largest city and the administrative headquarters of the Dungarpur district, Rajasthan from 1956 to 1960. Since 1961, Himatnagar is the administrative headquarter and part of Sabarkantha district of Gujarat. Places of interest Government library of himmatnagar, founded in 1942 at Tower road Daulat Vilas Palace Hanuman Temple located at Tower Chowk, Diwali, 2016 Old Temple of Harsiddhi Mata The white sandstone and cement walls of the original fort, though much ruined in parts still surround the heart of town. The gateways, especially the Prantij or Ahmedabad gate, are specimens of Muslim architecture. The bastions are hollow the inside occupied by pillared rooms in two stories which take up so much space that the walls of the bastions are composed of single layers of stone. In the town, a small stone building, with richly carved bow windows, was once the residence of the Maharajas of Ahmednagar. There are also some interesting Jain temples. Further on is a well, known as the Kazi ni Vavdi, with inscriptions on the side walls, one in Arabic and the other in Devnagri, bearing respectively the dates 1417 (820 Hijri year) and 1522 (Samvat 1578). The second inscription shows that the well was built in 1522 by Shamsher-ul-Mulk, who is stated by tradition to have been a son of Sultan Ahmed Shah. Further, the citadel or inner fort, known like that in Ahmedabad as the Bhadra, contains some very fine though ruinous buildings, the principal lacing that traditionally known as the Mulla or Mohina Rani's palace. Tho windows of these buildings are very fine, of stone carved with the delicacy of lace. There are several wells hewn out of the solid rock, and, though dry, in good preservation. In 1858, the principal building in the Bhadra was occupied as a mess-house by a small force sent to keep order in the Mahi Kantha during the troubled times of the Mutinies. It has since become a ruin. Outside, at some distance from the Bhadra and opening immediately on the Hathmati river, is the Idar gate, is close to it is a small mosque in perfect preservation, its windows worthy of notice, being each ornamented outside with a carved stone canopy while the frame is filled with carved stone work representing trees with foliage, through the interstices of which, a tempered light streams into the building. This mosque is said to have been built by Nasar-ul-Mulk, the eldest son of Sultan Ahmed Shah I. East of this mosque is the Navlakha Kund. It is an oblong hollow or pit about 100 feet broad and 500 feet long. At the foot of the flight of steps, which form one of the sides of the pit, is a stone basin, filled with water from a perennial spring and with stone cloisters round three of its sides. At the back of the west cloister is a ladies gallery hidden from sight by carved open stone screens. On the south side is a building with a stone canopy intended for the king or chief man of the place, who during the heat of the day came with his ladies to enjoy this cool retreat. The cloister on the north has disappeared, but the others, in fair preservation, are fine specimens of architecture. Tradition ascribes the work to Taj-ul-Mulk, another of the sons of Sultan Ahmed. Close to this place are the remains of buildings said to have been stables or cavalry lines. At one side of these, large arched doorways, now built up, led to an outwork facing the north, and immediately over the river, which was evidently at one time covered with a pillared roof. This was probably a place of resort, being cool, except at noon-day, and commanding a fine view of the Idar hills.

Lexmark International Inc.,03-16987 D.C. No. CV-01-04626SBA/JL OPINION 421 F.3d 981 (9th Cir. 2005) was a decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit which ruled that an End User License Agreement on a physical box can be binding on consumers who signal their acceptance of the license agreement by opening the box. Background Over the lifetime of modern computer printers, the cost of the ink cartridges can in typical usage be much more than the printer itself. Consumers have a motivation to refill their own cartridges either themselves or through third parties. Lexmark produced \\"Prebate\\" ink cartridges with a purchase contract that states that in exchange for purchasing the ink cartridge at a lower price, the consumer agrees not to tamper with the cartridge, and to return it to Lexmark for refurbishing and repackaging. Arizona Cartridge Remanufacturers Association Inc. (ACRA), a consumer group, brought suit that alleges it was deceptive for Lexmark to claim that its restriction was enforceable. Lexmark has since renamed the Prebate cartridges to Lexmark Return Program Cartridges.Lexmark Return Program Cartridges Ruling The appeals court upheld the district court's finding that \\"ACRA ha[d] not offered evidence that Lexmark's advertisements constitute[d] deceptive or unfair business practices\\" and granted summary judgment in favor of Lexmark. The court found that ACRA failed to show that Lexmark's post-sale restriction had no legal basis, and that ACRA's claim that \\"Lexmark want[ed] consumers to believe that the Prebate discount reflect[ed] the benefit that accrue[d] to Lexmark by getting an empty cartridge back\\" was not supported by the record. In addition, the appeals court affirmed the district court's finding that \\"Lexmark could restrict the post-sale use of its patented cartridge,\\" finding that \\"ACRA ha[d] not attempted to show that the use of the lock-out chip [...] impermissibly exceed[ed] the patent grant to produce anticompetitive effects.\\" Conclusion It is sometimes overlooked that this ruling only applies to Lexmark's \\"Prebate\\" ink cartridges, where the contract states that in exchange for purchasing the ink cartridge at a lower price, the consumer agrees to not tamper with the cartridge and return it to Lexmark for refurbishing and repackaging. The Electronic Frontier Foundation has concerns that this decision will allow patent owners to \\"impose over- reaching restrictions on formerly permitted post-sale uses\\".https://www.eff.org/cases/acra-v-lexmark See also * Bauer & Cie. v.

The dredged channel is in red; the canal itself is in yellow. The Sturgeon Bay Ship Canal is a shipping canal connecting Sturgeon Bay on Green Bay with Lake Michigan, across the Door Peninsula, at the city of Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin, United States.Historical Marker The canal allows shipping to transit directly from Lake Michigan to Green Bay, avoiding the dangerous Porte des Morts strait. The canal is approximately 1.3 miles in length, dug through the eastern side of the Door Peninsula in a northwest to southeast orientation. At its northwestern end, it connects to a dredged channel in Sturgeon Bay which in turn leads to Green Bay. The canal was dug by a private group headed by then- president of Chicago and North Western Railway, William B. Ogden, between July 8, 1872 and the late fall of 1881. Although smaller craft began using the canal in 1880, it was not open for large-scale watercraft until 1890. The cost of completing the 1.3 mile cut in 1881 was $291,461.69. In 1893, the Ogden private investors group sold all interest in the canal to the United States government. Since that time, the canal has been maintained by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The original canal was wide and deep. As of May 2016, the canal was wide and deep. A jetty extends into Lake Michigan and wide at the mouth. Several famous lighthouses mark the course of the canal and channel, including the Sturgeon Bay Canal Lighthouse at the eastern entrance on the northern side of the canal (approximately 230 feet from Lake Michigan) next to the Coast Guard Station Sturgeon Bay; the Sturgeon Bay Canal North Pierhead Light on the Lake Michigan coastline; and the Sherwood Point Lighthouse in Idlewild, on the far western end, on the southern shore of the outer edge of Sturgeon Bay.

(1990) Passions of the Cut Sleeve. University of California Press. Most scholars agree that Dong's quick career advancement came mostly because of his personal relationship with Emperor Ai, very likely a romantic & sexual one, rather than a demonstration of abilities. Both men were married to women, but Emperor Ai, at least, was childless. An idiomatic term for homosexuality in Chinese is duanxiu zhi pi (Êñ∑Ë¢ñ‰πãÁôñ, literally, \\"passion of the cut sleeve\\"), derived from an episode involving Dong and Emperor Ai. They often slept together on the same straw mat. One afternoon, after Emperor Ai woke up from a nap, Dong was still sleeping, and Emperor Ai's sleeve was stuck under Dong's head. Rather than waking Dong up, Emperor Ai cut off his sleeve to allow Dong to continue to sleep without disturbance. Early career It is unclear when Dong became a court official, but it is known that early in Emperor Ai's reign (which lasted from 7 BCE to 1 BCE), Dong was a minor imperial secretary (ÈÉé, lang), and he was a colleague of the later-posthumously famous Confucian scholar Yang Xiong. By 4 BCE, at the age of 19, he was an imperial attendant (‰æç‰∏≠, shizhong) and the director of imperial equine operations (ÈßôÈ¶¨ÈÉΩÂ∞â), fuma duwei. (In later dynasties, this became a title for princesses' husbands. That was not true during the Han Dynasty, and it is, in any case, clear that Dong did not marry a princess.) His relationship with Emperor Ai would allow him to suddenly increase his power and prestige. Relationship with Emperor Ai and quick ascension to great power Circa 4 BCE, Dong had by this point become a favorite of Emperor Ai's. It was described that whenever Emperor Ai visited places outside the palace, Dong would accompany him, and once Emperor Ai returned to the palace, he would attend to the emperor. Emperor Ai rewarded him with large sums of money. Dong's wife was given unprecedented permission to enter and leave the palace as she wished, and she set up a residence with Dong inside the palace. Emperor Ai also made Dong's sister an imperial consort (with the prestigious title zhaoyi (Êò≠ÂÑÄ)), ranked just below his wife Empress Fu. The three members of the Dong family thereby spent day and night near the emperor. Dong's father Dong Gong (Ëë£ÊÅ≠) was made the minister of palace supplies and created an acting marquess (ÈóúÂÖß‰æØ). Emperor Ai further ordered the imperial architect to build a luxurious residence for Dong just outside the main imperial palace, Weiyang Palace. The residence was described to be so spacious that it was like an imperial palace. Emperor Ai also gave Dong the best weapons and the most precious jewels from the imperial treasury - so much so that what Dong used was even more precious than what Emperor Ai personally used. Further, imperial burial tools were pre-awarded to Dong in preparation for his eventual burial, and Dong's future tomb was built right next to Emperor Ai's tomb. In 3 BCE, Emperor Ai became intent on creating Dong a marquess, but could find no good excuse to do it. At the suggestion of a member of his grandmother's clan named Fu Jia (ÂÇÖÂòâ), a plan was hatched. In 4 BCE, informants Xifu Gong (ÊÅØÂ§´Ë∫¨) and Sun Chong (Â≠´ÂØµ) had, through the eunuch Song Hong (ÂÆãÂºò), reported that Liu Yun (ÂäâÈõ≤), the Prince of Dongping, was using witchcraft; as a result, Prince Yun was demoted to commoner status and committed suicide. Emperor Ai announced that the plot was reported through Dong, not Song, and then created Dong, Xifu, and Sun acting marquesses. Later that year, over Prime Minister Wang Jia's objection, Emperor Ai created the three of them marquesses. A good number of officials tried to curb Dong's power by begging Emperor Ai not to overly reward him, and they suffered for it. There is no evidence indicating that Dong was behind the punishment of these officials; rather, it appears that Emperor Ai was personally offended that these officials attacked his lover and therefore punished them for it. The officials included: * Zheng Chong (ÈÑ≠Â¥á), the palace secretary general, who was arrested and who died while in prison in 3 BCE; the governor of the capital province, Sun Bao (Â≠´ÂØ∂), who tried to get Zheng released, was himself relieved of his post. * Wujiang Long (ÊØãÂ∞áÈöÜ), the security chief for the capital Chang'an, who refused to transfer the weapons to Dong and was demoted to the post of security chief for the Commandery of Pei. * Wang Jia (ÁéãÂòâ), the prime minister, who several times tried to prevent Dong from being created a marquess and being promoted; he was imprisoned and committed suicide within the prison in 2 BCE; Emperor Ai's own uncle Ding Ming (‰∏ÅÊòé), the commander of the armed forces, who was friendly with Wang and grieved for his death, was relieved of his post and returned to his march. However, Wang Hong (ÁéãÈñé), an imperial attendant and grandnephew of Grand Empress Dowager Wang Zhengjun, the step-grandmother of Emperor Ai, who also made similar requests of Emperor Ai, was not punished (because Emperor Ai was impressed by his bravery) but was also not listened to. In late 2 BCE, after Ding's successor Wei Shang (ÈüãÂ∞ö) died of an illness, Emperor Ai made Dong, at the age of 22, the commander of the armed forces (Â§ßÂè∏È¶¨, da sima) - one of the Three Excellencies, along with the prime minister (Â§ßÂè∏Âæí, da situ) and the prime examiner (Â§ßÂè∏Á©∫, da sikong) - and the security chief for the capital. The edict read: :Heaven gave you to be the helper for Han Dynasty. I know your faithfulness, and I hope that you can guide the great affairs of the empire and follow what is good. The edict's wording followed that of the alleged wording of Emperor Yao when he passed his throne to Emperor Shun, and greatly surprised and shocked all who read it. Despite his ascension to such great post, Dong continued to accompany Emperor Ai at all times in the palace, not handling the important matters that his post should have required him to handle. At the same time, his father Dong Gong was promoted to an honorary post while his younger brother Dong Kuanxin (Ëë£ÂØ¨‰ø°) was made the director of imperial equine operations, succeeding Dong Xian. Many members of the Dong clan were made imperial attendants or deputy ministers. Death In summer 1 BCE, Emperor Ai suddenly died without an heir. Dong Xian, as the commander of the armed forces, was the most powerful official at court, but he was paralyzed by this sudden event. Grand Empress Dowager Wang took decisive action; she proceeded to Weiyang Palace and seized the imperial seal. She then summoned Dong, who was caught by surprise and was unable to act. Grand Empress Dowager Wang summoned her nephew Wang Mang back to the palace as well and transferred the command of the imperial guard from Dong to Wang. Wang Mang then ordered the palace secretary to issue an article of impeachment against Dong, accusing Dong of failing to attend to Emperor Ai when he had been ill. Dong was prohibited from entering the palace, and was relieved of his post the next day. That night, he and his wife committed suicide, and were buried quickly. Wang Mang disinterred him to make sure that he was in fact dead, and then had him reburied within a prison. The entire Dong clan was exiled to Hepu (ÂêàÊµ¶, in modern Zhanjiang, Guangdong) and their assets forfeited to the imperial treasury.

The vernacular name refers to the prominent joints in the long greenish-grey legs, and bistriatus to the two stripes of the head pattern. Subspecies There are four subspecies, differing in size and plumage tone, but individual variation makes identification of races difficult. Range and habitat It is a resident breeder in Central and South America from southern Mexico south to Colombia, Venezuela and northern Brazil. It also occurs on Hispaniola and some of the Venezuelan islands, and is a very rare vagrant to Trinidad, Cura√ßao and the USA. It prefers arid grassland, savanna, and other dry, open habitats. Description At the Milwaukee County Zoological Gardens The double-striped thick-knee is a medium-large wader with a strong black and yellow bill, large yellow eyes, which give it a reptilian appearance, and cryptic plumage. The adult is about long and weighs about . It has finely streaked grey-brown upperparts, and a paler brown neck and breast merging into the white belly. The head has a strong white supercilium bordered above by a black stripe. Juveniles are similar to adults, but have slightly darker brown upperparts and a whitish nape. The double-striped thick-knee is striking in flight, with a white patch on the dark upperwing, and a white underwing with a black rear edge. Habits and food This is a largely nocturnal and crepuscular species. It flies only reluctantly, relying on crouching and camouflage for concealment. The double-striped thick-knee eats large insects and other small vertebrate and invertebrate prey. It is sometimes semi-domesticated because of its useful function in controlling insects, and has benefited from the clearing of woodlands to create pasture. The song, given at night, is a loud kee-kee-kee. Nesting The nest is a bare scrape into which two olive-brown eggs are laid and incubated by both adults for 25‚Äì27 days to hatching. The downy young are precocial and soon leave the nest.

The bridge was named in honour of Thomas Dufferin Pattullo, the 22nd Premier of British Columbia. A key link between Surrey and the rest of Greater Vancouver, the Pattullo Bridge handles an average of 75,700 cars and 3840 trucks daily, or roughly 20 percent of vehicle traffic across the Fraser River as of 2013. History The first regular crossing of the Fraser River started in 1882, and was operated by a steam ferry named K de K, which transported residents and livestock from Brownsville to New Westminster. During the late 1890s, the need for a new bridge became apparent after the existing ferry was deemed insufficient to handle future traffic demands. The first bridge, a combined steel two deck road and rail span, started construction in 1902, with completion in 1904. The bridge was built with two decks, the upper deck handling vehicular traffic and the lower deck functioning as a railway bridge. Again, growing traffic demands prompted the construction of a second bridge in 1936. The bridge was designed by supervising engineer Major W.G. Swan, and construction was tendered to the Dominion Bridge Company and Northern Construction & J.W. Stewart Ltd. The Pattullo Bridge was opened to traffic on November 15, 1937 by Premier \\"Duff\\" Pattullo, with a total cost of $4 million. The bridge was originally tolled at 25¬¢ per crossing, but was then removed in 1952. The old bridge, now known today as the New Westminster Rail Bridge was converted to rail use only, and highway traffic was moved to the Pattullo Bridge. About The Pattullo Bridge is in total length, and consists of four lanes, with two in each direction. The bridge has no barrier of any sort in the centre, making it highly prone to head-on collisions, especially at excessive speed or in bad weather. In recent years, TransLink has closed the middle lanes to traffic from 10:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m. in an effort to lower the high number of head-on collisions, and installed a series of plastic pillars to raise the visibility of the centre-lane divider. On 2 January 2006, four people were killed in a T-bone collision between two cars on the southern approach lane. In response to the high number of crashes on the bridge, TransLink studied the idea of reducing the number of lanes on the bridge from four to three using a counterflow operation, similar to that used on the Lions' Gate Bridge, with the number of lanes varied depending on traffic flow and volume. However, traffic analysis showed that significant congestion would result in Surrey and New Westminster, and the idea was abandoned. TransLink also examined a number of options to install a centre-line barrier and, in concert, to ban truck traffic from the bridge because the barrier would further narrow the traffic lanes, but that too was proven impractical. A more controversial proposal is to install photo radar on the bridge to enforce the existing speed limit. Thus far, the provincial government has ruled out the idea of bringing back photo radar, which it eliminated province-wide in 2001. Oversized commercial vehicles are prohibited from using the bridge, as mandated by the British Columbia Commercial Vehicle Safety and Enforcement agency. =2009 bridge fire= Around 3 a.m. on 18 January 2009, a fire started on the south end of the bridge in the structure under the bridge deck. The -long wooden trestle on the south side of the bridge connecting the steel and concrete structure to the earthen berm sustained damage, and had to be completely rebuilt. Initially, it was estimated that the bridge would be closed for 4‚Äì6 weeks. However, by reusing a temporary bridge structure used on the Canada Line project, the bridge was reopened on Monday, January 26. =Rehabilitation and replacement efforts= On 31 July 2008, TransLink opted to replace the bridge, rather than try to refurbish the aging structure. In June 2014, the Metro Vancouver Mayors' Council determined that a new, 4-lane, tolled replacement bridge was to be built, and to demolish the existing structure. Construction is expected to take place between 2019 and 2023, with the $1.3 billion funding finalized in 2018. Over the course of 2016, rehabilitation work commenced on bridge deck repairs to keep the bridge operational until a replacement is built. From May 2 to August 26, the bridge was reduced to one lane of traffic in each direction, with full bridge closures on selected days. The bridge reopened one month ahead of schedule, on August 29. On 3 January 2020, the government of British Columbia contracted Fraser Crossing Partners - a joint partnership between Acciona Infrastructure Canada and Aecon Group Inc. - to design and construct the replacement bridge. The contract also includes the construction of new road connections at the bridgeheads in New Westminster and Surrey. The bridge will include pedestrian access and allow for future widening from 4 lanes to 6 lanes.

It lies on the border between the counties of Gwynedd and Conwy. With a height rising to 944m it is officially the eleventh highest summit in Wales. Foel-fras is located at the northern end of the main ridge of the Carneddau, between Drum to the north and Foel Grach to the south, with the subsidiary summit of Garnedd Uchaf (926 m) between it and Foel Grach. Due south and 400 m below lies the reservoir of Llyn Dulyn, while the smaller reservoir of Llyn Anafon lies to the north. Because of its position, it is the first of the Welsh 3000s reached when doing this walk from the northern end. It can be climbed by driving up the small road signposted \\"Aber Falls\\" in the village of Abergwyngregyn, passing the car park for the falls and continuing to a small car park at the end of the road. From there it is possible to take the track bearing left, later turning right to the summit of Drum and continuing along the ridge, or to take the track leading straight on to Llyn Anafon and then climbing up to the ridge between Drum and Foel Fras. An alternate route up the mountain is to start at the Western end of the Bwlch-y- Ddeufaen pass and take the steep track up the side of Drosgyl, following the fence line all the way to where the ground levels off. Here the views open up and the fence changes direction, running off at almost a right angle to the Southeast (left). From here, follow a small track Southwest until it intersects the larger track previously mentioned - marked by a small quartz- peppered cairn - which will lead you to Drum. From Drum the walk to the summit of Foel Fras is simply parallel to the fence line, which changes into a dry stone wall as you are nearing the summit. Car parking is available at the Eastern end of the pass. The summit plateau has some ornithological interest in that it is one of the best places in Wales to observe dotterel on their spring and less frequent autumn migration.Nuttall, John & Anne (1999). The Mountains of England & Wales - Volume 1: Wales (2nd edition ed.). Milnthorpe, Cumbria: Cicerone. . Foel Fras can also be reached from Llanfairfechan, an equally as beautiful route as that from Aber Falls. Follow the road up through the village of Llanfairfechan until Terrace Walk, take the path from Terrace Walk that takes you past Hengae Farm, then follow the path that can take you to the summit of Garreg Fawr, Drum, Foel Fras and more.

Monique Richard, having become the SPQ Libre spokeswoman, was elected president of the Parti Qu√©b√©cois at the 2005 National Council, something seen by the SPQ Libre as a left-wing victory in the PQ. It declared its intent to field a sharply progressive candidate for the Parti Qu√©b√©cois leadership election of 2005, who ended up being editor of L'aut'journal and Secretary of the SPQ Libre Pierre Dubuc. After continued criticism of Pauline Marois perceived shift to the right on certain policy issues, the PQ expelled the group in March 2010, saying the attacks on Marois leadership and policies were \\"undermining party unity\\".https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/pq-ousts-left-wing- political-club/article1500370/ = Identity question = After the PQ‚Äôs defeat in 2007, factions of the SPQ criticized the party leadership for allowing the ‚Äúidentity question‚Äù and defence of \\"Qu√©b√©cois de souche\\" to be led by the Action d√©mocratique du Qu√©bec.http://www.wsws.org/articles/2007/nov2007/pq-n16.shtml  Description  The SPQ Libre is explicitly left-wing, pro labour unions and in favour of Quebec independence and with a strong determination to achieve it. Being a political club with the intent of assuring a strong left-wing presence in a party and to influence it, its nature is notably reminiscent of the New Democratic Party's New Politics Initiative or, to a lesser extent, of the New Democratic Party Socialist Caucus. Its creation represents in many ways a response to the creation of the Union des forces progressistes (and Option citoyenne), as well as to the discontent of some militants of the PQ leftist faction. Thus, a goal of the SPQ Libre is to demonstrate that stronger leftists have their place in the Parti Qu√©b√©cois, portrayed by the SPQ Libre as the only party able to achieve sovereignty.

Side view showing depth of the relief The relief is displayed in the British Museum in London, which has dated it between 1800 and 1750 BCE. It originates from southern Mesopotamia, but the exact find-site is unknown. Apart from its distinctive iconography, the piece is noted for its high relief and relatively large size making it a very rare survival from the period. However, whether it represents Lilitu, Inanna/Ishtar, or Ereshkigal is under debate. The authenticity of the object has been questioned from its first appearance in the 1930s, but opinion has generally moved in its favour over the subsequent decades. Provenance Initially in the possession of a Syrian dealer, who may have acquired the plaque in southern Iraq in 1924, the relief was deposited at the British Museum in London and analysed by Dr. H.J. Plenderleith in 1933. However, the Museum declined to purchase it in 1935, whereupon the plaque passed to the London antique dealer Sidney Burney; it subsequently became known as the \\"Burney Relief\\".Frankfort 1937. The relief was first brought to public attention with a full-page reproduction in The Illustrated London News, in 1936.Davis 1936. From Burney, it passed to the collection of Norman Colville, after whose death it was acquired at auction by the Japanese collector Goro Sakamoto. British authorities, however, denied him an export licence. The piece was loaned to the British Museum for display between 1980 and 1991, and in 2003 the relief was purchased by the Museum for the sum of ¬£1,500,000 as part of its 250th anniversary celebrations. The Museum also renamed the plaque the \\"Queen of the Night Relief\\".Collon 2003. Since then, the object has toured museums around Britain. Unfortunately, its original provenance remains unknown. The relief was not archaeologically excavated, and thus we have no further information where it came from, or in which context it was discovered. An interpretation of the relief thus relies on stylistic comparisons with other objects for which the date and place of origin have been established, on an analysis of the iconography, and on the interpretation of textual sources from Mesopotamian mythology and religion. Description Detailed descriptions were published by Henri Frankfort (1936), by Pauline Albenda (2005),Albenda 2005. and in a monograph by Dominique Collon, former curator at the British Museum, where the plaque is now housed. The composition as a whole is unique among works of art from Mesopotamia, even though many elements have interesting counterparts in other images from that time. =Physical aspect= The relief is a terracotta (fired clay) plaque, large, thick, with the head of the figure projecting from the surface. To manufacture the relief, clay with small calcareous inclusions was mixed with chaff; visible folds and fissures suggest the material was quite stiff when being worked.Collon 2003, 13. The British Museum's Department of Scientific Research reports, \\"it would seem likely that the whole plaque was moulded\\" with subsequent modelling of some details and addition of others, such as the rod-and-ring symbols, the tresses of hair and the eyes of the owls.quoted in Collon 2007b The relief was then burnished and polished, and further details were incised with a pointed tool. Firing burned out the chaff, leaving characteristic voids and the pitted surface we see now; Curtis and Collon believe the surface would have appeared smoothed by ochre paint in antiquity.Curtis 1996 In its dimensions, the unique plaque is larger than the mass-produced terracotta plaques ‚Äì popular art or devotional items ‚Äì of which many were excavated in house ruins of the Isin- Larsa and Old Babylonian periods.Such plaques are about in their longest dimension. Cf. the plaque AO 6501 at the Louvre, the plaque BM WA 1994-10-1, 1 at the British Museum, or an actual mould: BM WA 1910-11-12, 4, also at the British Museum (Curtis 1996) Approximate colour scheme of the painted relief Overall, the relief is in excellent condition. It was originally received in three pieces and some fragments by the British Museum; after repair, some cracks are still apparent, in particular a triangular piece missing on the right edge, but the main features of the deity and the animals are intact. The figure's face has damage to its left side, the left side of the nose and the neck region. The headdress has some damage to its front and right hand side, but the overall shape can be inferred from symmetry. Half of the necklace is missing and the symbol of the figure held in her right hand; the owls' beaks are lost and a piece of a lion's tail. A comparison of images from 1936 and 2005 shows that some modern damage has been sustained as well: the right hand side of the crown has now lost its top tier, and at the lower left corner a piece of the mountain patterning has chipped off and the owl has lost its right-side toes.cf. Davis 1936; Collon 2005 However, in all major aspects, the relief has survived intact for more than 3,500 years. Traces of red pigment still remain on the figure's body that was originally painted red overall. The feathers of her wings and the owls' feathers were also colored red, alternating with black and white. By Raman spectroscopy the red pigment is identified as red ochre, the black pigment, amorphous carbon (\\"lamp black\\") and the white pigment gypsum.Collon 2007b. Black pigment is also found on the background of the plaque, the hair and eyebrows, and on the lions' manes.cf. the color-scheme reconstruction on the British Museum page The pubic triangle and the areola appear accentuated with red pigment but were not separately painted black. The lions' bodies were painted white. The British Museum curators assume that the horns of the headdress and part of the necklace were originally colored yellow, just as they are on a very similar clay figure from Ur.According to the British Museum, this figure - of which only the upper part is preserved - presumably represents the sun-god Shamash (cf. details of 1931,1010.2) They surmise that the bracelets and rod-and-ring symbols might also have been painted yellow. However, no traces of yellow pigment now remain on the relief. =The female figure= Detail of bust with traces of pigment on the left hand The nude female figure is realistically sculpted in high- relief. Her eyes, beneath distinct, joined eyebrows, are hollow, presumably to accept some inlaying material ‚Äì a feature common in stone, alabaster, and bronze sculptures of the time,cf. the Male Worshiper and Standing Female Figure in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art but not seen in other Mesopotamian clay sculptures. Her full lips are slightly upturned at the corners. She is adorned with a four-tiered headdress of horns, topped by a disk. Her head is framed by two braids of hair, with the bulk of her hair in a bun in the back and two wedge-shaped braids extending onto her breasts. The stylized treatment of her hair could represent a ceremonial wig. She wears a single broad necklace, composed of squares that are structured with horizontal and vertical lines, possibly depicting beads, four to each square. This necklace is virtually identical to the necklace of the god found at Ur, except that the latter's necklace has three lines to a square. Around both wrists she wears bracelets which appear composed of three rings. Both hands are symmetrically lifted up, palms turned towards the viewer and detailed with visible life-, head- and heart lines, holding two rod-and-ring symbols of which only the one in the left hand is well preserved. Two wings with clearly defined, stylized feathers in three registers extend down from above her shoulders. The feathers in the top register are shown as overlapping scales (coverts), the lower two registers have long, staggered flight feathers that appear drawn with a ruler and end in a convex trailing edge. The feathers have smooth surfaces; no barbs were drawn. The wings are similar but not entirely symmetrical, differing both in the number of the flight feathersThe right wing has eight flight feathers, the left wing has seven. and in the details of the coloring scheme.The lower register of the right wing breaks the white-red- black pattern of the other three registers with a white-black-red-black-white sequence. Her wings are spread to a triangular shape but not fully extended. The breasts are full and high, but without separately modelled nipples. Her body has been sculpted with attention to naturalistic detail: the deep navel, structured abdomen, \\"softly modeled pubic area\\"Albenda (2005) notes \\"a tiny vertical indentation\\" but Collon (2007b) clarifies that this is merely a missing flake over a repaired fracture. the recurve of the outline of the hips beneath the iliac crest, and the bony structure of the legs with distinct knee caps all suggest \\"an artistic skill that is almost certainly derived from observed study\\". A spur-like protrusion, fold, or tuft extends from her calves just below the knee, which Collon interprets as dewclaws. Below the shin, the figure's legs change into those of a bird. The bird-feet are detailed,cf. image of the foot of an Indian falcon with three long, well-separated toes of approximately equal length. Lines have been scratched into the surface of the ankle and toes to depict the scutes, and all visible toes have prominent talons. Her toes are extended down, without perspective foreshortening; they do not appear to rest upon a ground line and thus give the figure an impression of being dissociated from the background, as if hovering. =The animals and background= Detail showing lions on bottom of the relief Detail of owl on bottom right of relief The two lions have a male mane, patterned with dense, short lines; the manes continue beneath the body.D. Opitz (1936) interprets this mane pattern as depicting the indigenous Barbary lion. D. Collon prefers an interpretation as the related Asiatic lion and notes that a skin in the Natural History Museum in London shows the distinctive whorl in the mane that is often represented in Mesopotamian art (Collon 2005, 34), but also in Egyptian art (cf. Tutanhkamun headrest). Distinctly patterned tufts of hair grow from the lion's ears and on their shoulders, emanating from a central disk-shaped whorl. They lie prone; their heads are sculpted with attention to detail, but with a degree of artistic liberty in their form, e.g., regarding their rounded shapes. Both lions look towards the viewer, and both have their mouths closed. The owls shown are recognizable, but not sculpted naturalistically: the shape of the beak, the length of the legs, and details of plumage deviate from those of the owls that are indigenous to the region.Iraq's indigenous owls without ear-tufts include the Barn owl (Tyto alba) ‚Äì this is the owl that D. Collon believes to be represented in the relief (Collon 2005, 36) ‚Äì the Little owl (Athene noctua lilith) and the Tawny owl (Strix aluco). Their plumage is colored like the deity's wings in red, black and white; it is bilaterally similar but not perfectly symmetrical. Both owls have one more feather on the right-hand side of their plumage than on the left-hand side. The legs, feet and talons are red. The group is placed on a pattern of scales, painted black. This is the way mountain ranges were commonly symbolized in Mesopotamian art. Context The Burney Relief inside a display case in the British Museum in London =Date and place of origin= Stylistic comparisons place the relief at the earliest into the Isin‚ÄìLarsa period,Van Buren 1936. or slightly later, to the beginning of the Old Babylonian period.The relief is therefore neither Sumerian or Akkadian - that would have been even earlier - nor Assyrian - that would located it to northern Mesopotamia. Frankfort especially notes the stylistic similarity with the sculpted head of a male deity found at Ur, which Collon finds to be \\"so close to the Queen of the Night in quality, workmanship and iconographical details, that it could well have come from the same workshop.\\"Collon 2005, 20. Therefore, Ur is one possible city of origin for the relief, but not the only one: Edith Porada points out the virtual identity in style that the lion's tufts of hair have with the same detail seen on two fragments of clay plaques excavated at Nippur.Porada 1980.cf. Plates 142:8 and 142:10 in McCown 1978. By stratification with dated clay-tablets, one of these similar fragments has been assigned to the Isin‚ÄìLarsa period (dates between 2000 and 1800 BCE), the other to the adjacent Old Babylonian period (dates between 1800 and 1700 BCE) (short chronology). And Agn√®s Spycket reported on a similar necklace on a fragment found in Isin.quoted in Collon 2007b. =Geopolitical context= A creation date at the beginning of the second millennium BCE places the relief into a region and time in which the political situation was unsteady, marked by the waxing and waning influence of the city states of Isin and Larsa, an invasion by the Elamites, and finally the conquest by Hammurabi in the unification in the Babylonian empire in 1762 BCE. 300 to 500 years earlier, the population for the whole of Mesopotamia was at its all-time high of about 300,000. Elamite invaders then toppled the third Dynasty of Ur and the population declined to about 200,000; it had stabilized at that number at the time the relief was made.Thompson 2004. Cities like Nippur and Isin would have had on the order of 20,000 inhabitants and Larsa maybe 40,000; Hammurabi's Babylon grew to 60,000 by 1700 BCE.George Modelski, quoted in Thompson 2004. A well-developed infrastructure and complex division of labour is required to sustain cities of that size. The fabrication of religious imagery might have been done by specialized artisans: large numbers of smaller, devotional plaques have been excavated that were fabricated in molds. Even though the fertile crescent civilizations are considered the oldest in history, at the time the Burney Relief was made other late Bronze Age civilizations were equally in full bloom. Travel and cultural exchange were not commonplace, but nevertheless possible.cf. the Egyptian 12th dynasty story of Sinuhe To the east, Elam with its capital Susa was in frequent military conflict with Isin, Larsa and later Babylon. Even further, the Indus Valley Civilization was already past its peak, and in China, the Erlitou culture blossomed. To the southwest, Egypt was ruled by the 12th dynasty; further to the west the Minoan civilization, centred on Crete with the Old Palace in Knossos, dominated the Mediterranean. To the north of Mesopotamia, the Anatolian Hittites were establishing their Old Kingdom over the Hattians; they brought an end to Babylon's empire with the sack of the city in 1531 BCE. Indeed, Collon mentions this raid as possibly being the reason for the damage to the right- hand side of the relief.Collon 2005, 22. =Religion= The size of the plaque suggests it would have belonged in a shrine, possibly as an object of worship; it was probably set into a mud-brick wall.Frankfort 1937; Jacobsen 1987. Such a shrine might have been a dedicated space in a large private home or other house, but not the main focus of worship in one of the cities' temples, which would have contained representations of gods sculpted in the round. Mesopotamian temples at the time had a rectangular cella often with niches to both sides. According to Thorkild Jacobsen, that shrine could have been located inside a brothel.Jacobsen 1987. siren made in Myrina (Mysia), 1st century BCE =Art history= Compared with how important religious practice was in Mesopotamia, and compared to the number of temples that existed, very few cult figures at all have been preserved. This is certainly not due to a lack of artistic skill: the \\"Ram in a Thicket\\" shows how elaborate such sculptures could have been, even 600 to 800 years earlier. It is also not due to a lack of interest in religious sculpture: deities and myths are ubiquitous on cylinder seals and the few steles, kudurrus, and reliefs that have been preserved. Rather, it seems plausible that the main figures of worship in temples and shrines were made of materials so valuable they could not escape looting during the many shifts of power that the region saw.Spycket 1968, 11; Ornan 2005, 60 ff. The Burney Relief is comparatively plain, and so survived. In fact, the relief is one of only two existing large, figurative representations from the Old Babylonian period. The other one is the top part of the Code of Hammurabi, which was actually discovered in Elamite Susa, where it had been brought as booty. A static, frontal image is typical of religious images intended for worship. Symmetric compositions are common in Mesopotamian art when the context is not narrative.A narrative context depicts an event, such as the investment of a king. There, the king opposes a god, and both are shown in profile. Whenever a deity is depicted alone, a symmetrical composition is more common. However, the shallow relief of the cylinder seal entails that figures are shown in profile; therefore, the symmetry is usually not perfect. Many examples have been found on cylinder seals. Three-part arrangements of a god and two other figures are common, but five-part arrangements exist as well. In this respect, the relief follows established conventions. In terms of representation, the deity is sculpted with a naturalistic but \\"modest\\" nudity, reminiscent of Egyptian goddess sculptures, which are sculpted with a well-defined navel and pubic region but no details; there, the lower hemline of a dress indicates that some covering is intended, even if it does not conceal. In a typical statue of the genre, Pharaoh Menkaura and two goddesses, Hathor and Bat are shown in human form and sculpted naturalistically, just as in the Burney Relief; in fact, Hathor has been given the features of Queen Khamerernebty II. Depicting an anthropomorphic god as a naturalistic human is an innovative artistic idea that may well have diffused from Egypt to Mesopotamia, just like a number of concepts of religious rites, architecture, the \\"banquet plaques\\", and other artistic innovations previously.Kaelin 2006. In this respect, the Burney Relief shows a clear departure from the schematic style of the worshiping men and women that were found in temples from periods about 500 years earlier. It is also distinct from the next major style in the region: Assyrian art, with its rigid, detailed representations, mostly of scenes of war and hunting. The extraordinary survival of the figure type, though interpretations and cult context shifted over the intervening centuries, is expressed by the cast terracotta funerary figure of the 1st century BCE, from Myrina on the coast of Mysia in Asia Minor, where it was excavated by the French School at Athens, 1883; the terracotta is conserved in the Mus√©e du Louvre (illustrated left).

Less frequently, gods are identified by a written label or dedication; such labels would only have been intended for the literate elites. In creating a religious object, the sculptor was not free to create novel images: the representation of deities, their attributes and context were as much part of the religion as the rituals and the mythology. Indeed, innovation and deviation from an accepted canon could be considered a cultic offense.Ornan 2005, 8 ff. The large degree of similarity that is found in plaques and seals suggests that detailed iconographies could have been based on famous cult statues; they established the visual tradition for such derivative works but have now been lost.Collon 2007. It appears, though, that the Burney Relief was the product of such a tradition, not its source, since its composition is unique. Frontal nudity The \\"Ishtar Vase\\", early 2nd millennium BCE, Larsa. Note how the schematic depiction of the goddess' feet corresponds to the feet of the birds walking above her. Louvre, AO 1700\\\\. The frontal presentation of the deity is appropriate for a plaque of worship, since it is not just a \\"pictorial reference to a god\\" but \\"a symbol of his presence\\". Since the relief is the only existing plaque intended for worship, we do not know whether this is generally true. But this particular depiction of a goddess represents a specific motif: a nude goddess with wings and bird's feet. Similar images have been found on a number of plaques, on a vase from Larsa, and on at least one cylinder seal; they are all from approximately the same time period.Van Buren (1936) shows three such examples, Barrelet (1952) shows six more such representations and Collon (2005) adds yet another plaque to the canon. In all instances but one, the frontal view, nudity, wings, and the horned crown are features that occur together; thus, these images are iconographically linked in their representation of a particular goddess. Moreover, examples of this motif are the only existing examples of a nude god or goddess; all other representations of gods are clothed.cf. Ornan 2005, Fig. 1-220. The bird's feet have not always been well preserved, but there are no counter-examples of a nude, winged goddess with human feet. Horned crown The horned crown ‚Äì usually four-tiered‚Äì is the most general symbol of a deity in Mesopotamian art. Male and female gods alike wear it. In some instances, \\"lesser\\" gods wear crowns with only one pair of horns, but the number of horns is not generally a symbol of \\"rank\\" or importance. The form we see here is a style popular in Neo-Sumerian times and later; earlier representations show horns projecting out from a conical headpiece.Black 1992. Wings Winged gods, other mythological creatures, and birds are frequently depicted on cylinder seals and steles from the 3rd millennium all the way to the Assyrians. Both two-winged and four-winged figures are known and the wings are most often extended to the side. Spread wings are part of one type of representation for Ishtar.Collon 2007, 80. However, the specific depiction of the hanging wings of the nude goddess may have evolved from what was originally a cape.Barrelet 1952. Rod and ring symbol This symbol may depict the measuring tools of a builder or architect or a token representation of these tools. It is frequently depicted on cylinder seals and steles, where it is always held by a god ‚Äì usually either Shamash, Ishtar, and in later Babylonian images also Marduk‚Äì and often extended to a king. In its totality here perhaps representing any sort of a measured act of a \\"weighing\\" event, further suggestion of an Egyptian influence. Lions Lions are chiefly associated with Ishtar or with the male gods Shamash or Ningirsu. In Mesopotamian art, lions are nearly always depicted with open jaws. H. Frankfort suggests that The Burney Relief shows a modification of the normal canon that is due to the fact that the lions are turned towards the worshipper: the lions might appear inappropriately threatening if their mouths were open. Owls No other examples of owls in an iconographic context exist in Mesopotamian art, nor are there textual references that directly associate owls with a particular god or goddess. Mountains A god standing on or seated on a pattern of scales is a typical scenery for the depiction of a theophany. It is associated with gods who have some connection with mountains but not restricted to any one deity in particular. Identification A different photograph of the relief The figure has initially been identified as a depiction of Ishtar (Inanna)Inanna is the Sumerian name and Ishtar the Akkadian name for the same goddess. Sacral text was usually written in Sumerian at the time the relief was made, but Akkadian was the spoken language; this article therefore uses the Akkadian name Ishtar for consistency, except where \\"Inanna\\" has been used by the authors whose sources are quoted. but almost immediately other arguments have been put forward: =Lilitu= The identification of the relief as depicting \\"Lilith\\" has become a staple of popular writing on that subject. Raphael Patai (1990)Patai 1990, 221. believes the relief to be the only extant depiction of a Sumerian female demon called lilitu and thus to define lilitu's iconography. Citations regarding this assertion lead back to Henri Frankfort (1936). Frankfort himself based his interpretation of the deity as the demon Lilith on the presence of wings, the birds' feet and the representation of owls. He cites the Babylonian Epic of Gilgamesh as a source that such \\"creatures are inhabitants of the land of the dead\\".Gilgamesh, Plate VII, col. IV In that text Enkidu's appearance is partially changed to that of a feathered being, and he is led to the nether world where creatures dwell that are \\"birdlike, wearing a feather garment\\". This passage reflects the Sumerians' belief in the nether world, and Frankfort cites evidence that Nergal, the ruler of the underworld, is depicted with bird's feet and wrapped in a feathered gown. However Frankfort did not himself make the identification of the figure with Lilith; rather he cites Emil Kraeling (1937) instead. Kraeling believes that the figure \\"is a superhuman being of a lower order\\"; he does not explain exactly why. He then goes on to state \\"Wings [...] regularly suggest a demon associated with the wind\\" and \\"owls may well indicate the nocturnal habits of this female demon\\". He excludes Lamashtu and Pazuzu as candidate demons and states: \\"Perhaps we have here a third representation of a demon. If so, it must be Lil√Ætu [...] the demon of an evil wind\\", named ki-sikil-lil-laki- sikil-lil-la (Krealing) and ki-sikil-lil-la-ke (Albenda) appear to be mistaken readings of the original Sumerian passage from the Gilgamesh epos: ki-sikil lit. ki- earth-untouched/pure i.e. virgin or maiden, lil2 wind; breath; infection; phantom; -la- is gen. case marker and -ke4 erg. case marker, both are required by the grammatical context (in this passage: \\"kisikil built for herself\\") but the case markers are not part of the noun.

This ki-sikil-lil is an antagonist of Inanna (Ishtar) in a brief episode of the epic of Gilgamesh, which is cited by both Kraeling and Frankfort as further evidence for the identification as Lilith, though this appendix too is now disputed. In this episode, Inanna's holy Huluppu tree is invaded by malevolent spirits. Frankfort quotes a preliminary translation by Gadd (1933): \\"in the midst Lilith had built a house, the shrieking maid, the joyful, the bright queen of Heaven\\". However modern translations have instead: \\"In its trunk, the phantom maid built herself a dwelling, the maid who laughs with a joyful heart. But holy Inanna cried.\\"Gilgame≈°, Enkidu and the nether world, lines 44-46 The earlier translation implies an association of the demon Lilith with a shrieking owl and at the same time asserts her god- like nature; the modern translation supports neither of these attributes. In fact, Cyril J. Gadd (1933), the first translator, writes: \\"ardat lili (kisikil-lil) is never associated with owls in Babylonian mythology\\" and \\"the Jewish traditions concerning Lilith in this form seem to be late and of no great authority\\".Gadd 1933. This single line of evidence being taken as virtual proof of the identification of the Burney Relief with \\"Lilith\\" may have been motivated by later associations of \\"Lilith\\" in later Jewish sources. The association of Lilith with owls in later Jewish literature such as the Songs of the Sage (1st century BCE) and Babylonian Talmud (5th century CE) is derived from a reference to a liliyth among a list of wilderness birds and animals in Isaiah (7th century BCE), though some scholars, such as Blair (2009)Judit M. Blair De-demonising the Old Testament; an investigation of Azazel, Lilith, Deber, Qeteb and Reshef in the Hebrew Bible 2009Isaiah 34:14 consider the pre-Talmudic Isaiah reference to be non-supernatural, and this is reflected in some modern Bible translations: :Isaiah 34:13 Thorns shall grow over its strongholds, nettles and thistles in its fortresses. It shall be the haunt of jackals, an abode for ostriches. 14 And wild animals shall meet with hyenas; the wild goat shall cry to his fellow; indeed, there the night bird (lilit or lilith) settles and finds for herself a resting place. 15 There the owl nests and lays and hatches and gathers her young in her shadow; indeed, there the hawks are gathered, each one with her mate. (ESV) Today, the identification of the Burney Relief with Lilith is questioned,Lowell K. Handy article Lilith Anchor Bible Dictionary and the figure is now generally identified as the goddess of love and war.Bible Review Vol 17 Biblical Archaeology Society - 2001 \\"LILITH? In the 1930s, scholars identified the voluptuous woman on this terracotta plaque (called the Burney Relief) as the Babylonian demoness Lilith. Today, the figure is generally identified as the goddess of love and war \\" =Ishtar= 50 years later, Thorkild Jacobsen substantially revised this interpretation and identified the figure as Inanna (Akkadian: Ishtar) in an analysis that is primarily based on textual evidence. According to Jacobsen: *The hypothesis that this tablet was created for worship makes it unlikely that a demon was depicted. Demons had no cult in Mesopotamian religious practice since demons \\"know no food, know no drink, eat no flour offering and drink no libation.\\"cf. line 295 in \\"Inanna's descent into the nether world\\" Therefore, \\"no relationship of giving and taking could be established with them\\"; *The horned crown is a symbol of divinity, and the fact that it is four-tiered suggests one of the principal gods of the Mesopotamian pantheon; *Inanna was the only goddess that was associated with lions. For example, a hymn by En-hedu-ana specifically mentions \\"Inanna, seated on crossed (or harnessed) lions\\"Jacobsen quotes Inana C, line 23 and the motif of Inana standing on lions is well attested from seals and plaques (cf. the image of Ishtar, above); *The goddess is depicted standing on mountains. According to text sources, Inanna's home was on Kur-m√πsh, the mountain crests. Iconographically, other gods were depicted on mountain scales as well, but there are examples in which Inanna is shown on a mountain pattern and another god is not, i.e. the pattern was indeed sometimes used to identify Inanna.Ornan 2005, 61 f. *The rod-and-ring symbol, her necklace and her wig are all attributes that are explicitly referred to in the myth of Inanna's descent into the nether world.Jacobsen 1987, (original at \\"Inana's descent to the nether world\\") *Jacobsen quotes textual evidence that the Akkadian word e≈°≈°ebu (owl) corresponds to the Sumerian word ninna, and that the Sumerian Dnin-ninna (Divine lady ninna) corresponds to the Akkadian Ishtar. The Sumerian ninna can also be translated as the Akkadian kilili, which is also a name or epithet for Ishtar. Inanna/Ishtar as harlot or goddess of harlots was a well known theme in Mesopotamian mythology and in one text, Inanna is called kar-kid (harlot) and ab-ba-[≈°√∫]-≈°√∫, which in Akkadian would be rendered kilili. Thus there appears to be a cluster of metaphors linking prostitute and owl and the goddess Inanna/Ishtar; this could match the most enigmatic component of the relief to a well known aspect of Ishtar. Jacobsen concludes that this link would be sufficient to explain talons and wings, and adds that nudity could indicate the relief was originally the house-altar of a bordello. =Ereshkigal= In contrast, the British Museum does acknowledge the possibility that the relief depicts either Lilith or Ishtar, but prefers a third identification: Ishtar's antagonist and sister Ereshkigal, the goddess of the underworld. This interpretation is based on the fact that the wings are not outspread and that the background of the relief was originally painted black. If this were the correct identification, it would make the relief (and by implication the smaller plaques of nude, winged goddesses) the only known figurative representations of Ereshkigal. Edith Porada, the first to propose this identification, associates hanging wings with demons and then states: \\"If the suggested provenience of the Burney Relief at Nippur proves to be correct, the imposing demonic figure depicted on it may have to be identified with the female ruler of the dead or with some other major figure of the Old Babylonian pantheon which was occasionally associated with death.\\"Porada 1980, 260. No further supporting evidence was given by Porada, but another analysis published in 2002 comes to the same conclusion. E. von der Osten-Sacken describes evidence for a weakly developed but nevertheless existing cult for Ereshkigal; she cites aspects of similarity between the goddesses Ishtar and Ereshkigal from textual sources ‚Äì for example they are called \\"sisters\\" in the myth of \\"Inanna's descent into the nether world\\" ‚Äì and she finally explains the unique doubled rod-and-ring symbol in the following way: \\"Ereshkigal would be shown here at the peak of her power, when she had taken the divine symbols from her sister and perhaps also her identifying lions\\".Von der Osten-Sacken 2002. Authenticity The 1936 London Illustrated News feature had \\"no doubt of the authenticity\\" of the object which had \\"been subjected to exhaustive chemical examination\\" and showed traces of bitumen \\"dried out in a way which is only possible in the course of many centuries\\". But stylistic doubts were published only a few months later by D. Opitz who noted the \\"absolutely unique\\" nature of the owls with no comparables in all of Babylonian figurative artefacts.Opitz 1936. In a back-to-back article, E. Douglas Van Buren examined examples of Sumerian art, which had been excavated and provenanced and she presented examples: Ishtar with two lions, the Louvre plaque (AO 6501) of a nude, bird-footed goddess standing on two Ibexes and similar plaques, and even a small haematite owl, although the owl is an isolated piece and not in an iconographical context. A year later Frankfort (1937) acknowledged Van Buren's examples, added some of his own and concluded \\"that the relief is genuine\\". Opitz (1937) concurred with this opinion, but reasserted that the iconography is not consistent with other examples, especially regarding the rod-and-ring symbol. These symbols were the focus of a communication by Pauline Albenda (1970) who again questioned the relief's authenticity. Subsequently, the British Museum performed thermoluminescence dating which was consistent with the relief being fired in antiquity; but the method is imprecise when samples of the surrounding soil are not available for estimation of background radiation levels. A rebuttal to Albenda by Curtis and Collon (1996) published the scientific analysis; the British Museum was sufficiently convinced of the relief to purchase it in 2003. The discourse continued however: in her extensive reanalysis of stylistic features, Albenda once again called the relief \\"a pastiche of artistic features\\" and \\"continue[d] to be unconvinced of its antiquity\\". Her arguments were rebutted in a rejoinder by Collon (2007), noting in particular that the whole relief was created in one unit, i.e. there is no possibility that a modern figure or parts of one might have been added to an antique background; she also reviewed the iconographic links to provenanced pieces. In concluding Collon states: \\"[Edith Porada] believed that, with time, a forgery would look worse and worse, whereas a genuine object would grow better and better. [...] Over the years [the Queen of the Night] has indeed grown better and better, and more and more interesting. For me she is a real work of art of the Old Babylonian period.\\" In 2008/9 the relief was included in exhibitions on Babylon at the Pergamon Museum in Berlin, the Louvre in Paris, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.\\"British Museum collection database\\" See also *Religions of the Ancient Near East *Mesopotamian mythology *History of Mesopotamia *Lion of Babylon Notes References Bibliography  *\\"British Museum collection database\\" Queen of the Night/Burney Relief website page, accessed Feb 7, 2016       * External links *The Queen of The Night (ME 2003-7-18,1 at the British Museum) *Nude Winged Goddess (AO 6501 at the Louvre) *\\"Ishtar Vase\\" from Larsa (AO 17000 at the Louvre) Category:18th-century BC works Category:1933 archaeological discoveries Category:Babylonian art and architecture Category:Sculpture of the Ancient Near East Category:Ancient Near and Middle East clay objects Category:Middle Eastern objects in the British Museum Category:Terracotta sculptures in the United Kingdom Category:Nude sculptures in the United Kingdom Category:Reliefs in the United Kingdom Category:Birds in art Category:Lilith Category:Forgery controversies ","title":"Burney Relief"},{"id":"2617808","text":"Michael W.

The United States Supreme Court has defined it as \\"an agreement 'implied in fact'\\" as \\"founded upon a meeting of minds, which, although not embodied in an express contract, is inferred, as a fact, from conduct of the parties showing, in the light of the surrounding circumstances, their tacit understanding.\\" Although the parties may not have exchanged words of agreement, their conduct may indicate that an agreement existed. For example, if a patient goes to a doctor's appointment, his actions indicate he intends to receive treatment in exchange for paying reasonable/fair doctor's fees. Likewise, by seeing the patient, the doctor's actions indicate he intends to treat the patient in exchange for payment of the bill. Therefore, it seems that a contract actually existed between the doctor and the patient, even though nobody spoke any words of agreement. (They both agreed to the same essential terms, and acted in accordance with that agreement. There was mutuality of consideration.) In such a case, the court will probably find that (as a matter of fact) the parties had an implied contract. If the patient refuses to pay after being examined, he will have breached the implied contract. Another example of an implied contract is the payment method known as a letter of credit. Generally, an implied contract has the same legal force as an express contract. However, it may be more difficult to prove the existence and terms of an implied contract should a dispute arise.

Founded in 1969 after the bankruptcy of pioneering toy manufacturer Marusan, the company was also known simply as Bull by many people as their logo of a bull was stamped on the bottoms of the feet of many of its toys. Products Bullmark's vinyl Godzilla and Ultraman toys are extremely popular among Japanese toy collectors; some currently retail for thousands of dollars. Bullmark's vinyl toys were produced in a variety of sizes from \\"mini\\" (3-4\\") to \\"standard\\" (8-9\\") to \\"giant,\\" (usually 12\\" or more) with smaller runs produced with different colorways for export to Hawaii and the West Coast of the United States. These so-called \\"Hawaiian\\" versions of the characters, which were produced in relatively small numbers, feature brighter colors than their Japanese counterparts, and therefore are popular among collectors both in Japan and abroad. When the fad for soft-vinyl monsters began to fade in the mid-1970s, despite gimmicks such as sparker figures and magnets embedded in their palms (each of which included a tin friction-motor car), Bullmark began re-thinking the concept and released a series of soft-vinyl toys containing missile launchers, and other play gimmicks. These were sold under the brand \\"Mecha Machine,\\" among other names. In an attempt to compete in a changing toy marketplace, in 1973 Bullmark also branched out into die-cast toys, which were sold under the brand name of \\"Zinclon.\\" Perhaps most famous among these are a small line of diecast metal renditions of characters from the Godzilla films. Bullmark co-founder Saburo Ishizuki explained in the afterword to the book Super #1 Robot that the diecast Mechagodzilla toy was \\"so popular that I could hardly keep up with demand... [so] I updated the look of the [other] monster characters with more robotic appearances and incorporated all-new action features.\\" The Zinclon series would eventually incorporate a variety of giant robot characters as well as monsters. Bullmark closed shop in 1977. The same year, Saburo Ishizuki took Bullmark's sales and marketing subsidiary Ark and turned it into a full-fledged toy manufacturer in its own right. During the 1990s, Ishizuki assisted the Japanese toy manufacturers M-1 (M-Ichigo) and Bandai in producing licensed reissues of many classic Bullmark vinyl toys, which proved to be exceedingly popular, from both the Godzilla and Ultraman lines. Ishizuki officially revived the brand as an independent company once again, with manufacturing and consulting support from Yuji Nishimura of M-1, in 2009.

When the software detects a cheat on a player's system, it will ban them in the future, possibly days or weeks after the original detection. It may kick players from the game if it detects errors in their system's memory or hardware. No information such as date of detection or type of cheat detected is disclosed to the player. After the player is notified, access to online \\"VAC protected\\" servers of the game the player cheated in is permanently revoked and additional restrictions are applied to the player's Steam account. During one week of November 2006, the system detected over 10,000 cheating attempts. History In 2001, Even Balance Inc., the developers of the anti- cheat software PunkBuster designed for Counter-Strike and Half-Life mods, stopped supporting the games as they had no support from Valve. Valve had also rejected business offers of integrating the technology directly into their games. Valve started working on a \\"long-term solution\\" for cheating in 2001. VAC's initial release was with Counter-Strike in 2002. During this initial release, the system only banned players for 24 hours. The duration of the ban was increased over time; players were banned for 1 year and 5 years, until VAC2 was released in 2005, when any new bans became permanent. VAC2 was announced in February 2005 and began beta testing the following month. On November 17, 2006, they announced that \\"new [VAC] technology\\" had caught \\"over 10,000\\" cheating attempts in the preceding week alone. During the early testing phase in 2002, some information was revealed about the program via the Half-Life Dedicated Server mailing lists. It can detect versions of \\"OGC's OpenGl Hack,\\" OpenGL cheats, and also detects CD key changers as cheats. Information on detected cheaters is sent to the ban list server on IP address 205.158.143.67 on port 27013, which was later changed to 27011. There is also a \\"master ban list\\" server. RAM/hardware errors detected by VAC may kick the player from the server, but not ban them. Eric Smith and Nick Shaffner were the original contacts for game administrators. In February 2010, the VAC Team consisted of Steam's lead engineer John Cook and his team of 16 engineers. In July 2010, several players who successfully used information leaked from Valve to increase their chances of finding a rare Team Fortress 2 weapon called the Golden Wrench were banned by VAC. During the same month, approximately 12,000 owners of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 were banned when Steam updated a DLL file on-disk after it had been loaded into memory by the game, causing a false positive detection. These bans were revoked and those affected received a free copy of Left 4 Dead 2 or an extra copy to send as a gift. In February 2014, rumors spread that the system was monitoring websites users had visited by accessing their DNS cache. Gabe Newell responded via Reddit, clarifying that the purpose of the check was to act as a secondary counter-measure to detect kernel level cheats, and that it affected fewer than 0.1% of clients checked which resulted in 570 bans. As of May 2016, the system began banning accounts that were registered with the same phone number. Additionally, a phone number that was used on an account at the time it was banned will not be allowed to be re-registered on other accounts for three months. The system has been criticized for failing to detect LMAOBOX, a popular cheat program for Team Fortress 2, until May 2016, which resulted in a wave of bans. In February 2017, Valve announced plans to introduce a machine-learning approach to detecting cheats in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, and that an initial version of the system was already in place, which would automatically mark players for manual detection by players through the \\"Overwatch\\" system. In March 2018, Valve publicized said machine-learning based approach in a talk at the Games Developer Conference, naming it VACNet. Design Valve rarely discusses the software, as it may help cheaters write new code or conduct social engineering. The software sends client challenges to the machine; if the appropriate response is not received, it is flagged as a possible violation. It uses Signature Scanning to detect possible cheats when scanning the computer's memory and processes. Whenever an anomaly is detected, an incident report is created and compared to a database of banned applications and/or analyzed by Valve engineers. The engineers may inspect the code and run it on their own copies of the game. If the code is confirmed as a new cheat, it is added to the database of cheat codes. According to Steam's lead engineer John Cook, to stop the anti-cheat software itself from being exploited, \\"The software is constantly updated and sent down in small portions for the servers as needed, so hackers only get to see small portions of it running at any particular time. So while they may be able to work around pieces of it, they can never hack everything.\\" Valve also accepts submissions of cheat programs and cheat websites from players by email. Players may also report players they suspect of cheating through their Steam Community profile, although players are not banned from these reports alone. If a cheat is found, the player's Steam account will be flagged as cheating immediately, but the player will not receive any indication of the detection. It is only after a delay of \\"days or even weeks\\" that the account is permanently banned from \\"VAC Secure\\" servers for that game, possibly along with other games that use the same engine (e.g. Valve's Source games, GoldSrc games, Unreal engine games). Valve never discloses which cheat was detected. Players have criticized the system for taking weeks to months to ban cheaters. Large numbers of flagged accounts may also be banned in \\"waves\\". =Additional restrictions= Players that are banned face additional restrictions. Steam Family Sharing allows users to share their video game library with another Steam user to download and play, but games that the player is VAC banned from cannot be shared. If a user shares their games with another user, then cheats or fraud are detected on the recipients account, the original owner of the games being shared may be VAC banned and the sharing function revoked. Banned users also cannot contribute to the Steam Translation Server project, that allows users to contribute new translations of Steam and its games. Users banned from a game are not allowed to refund it. Over 100 games support VAC; players that are banned from the following games face additional restrictions: * Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 * Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 * Counter-Strike (video game) * Counter- Strike: Condition Zero * Counter-Strike: Source * Counter-Strike: Global Offensive'''' * Day of Defeat * Day of Defeat: Source * Deathmatch Classic * Half-Life 2: Deathmatch * Half-Life Deathmatch: Source * Ricochet * Team Fortress 2 * Team Fortress Classic Mods based on the games above may inherit VAC support from the host game. Denotes GoldSrc games, if a player is banned in one of these games they are banned from all of them. Denotes Source engine games, if a player is banned in one of these games they are banned from all of them. Denotes games that have a stricter policy of having all servers VAC protected, and additionally bans players for editing of any game files except config files. Denotes games that face digital goods restrictions and or revocation. =Social impact= The user's Steam profile is also marked with \\"ban(s) on record\\", which is publicly visible and cannot be hidden, regardless of the profile visibility of the banned account. VAC bans become hidden to other users after seven years of not getting another VAC ban. An analysis of 43,465 users that had been banned between April 2011 and October 2011 showed that the more VAC banned players a user is friends with, the more likely they will also be VAC banned themselves in the future. After they were banned, they lost more friends, were more likely to increase their privacy settings and also had more VAC banned friends than non-banned players. Banned players are also sometimes referred to as going on \\"VACation\\". Banned players are also excluded from competing in most electronic sports tournaments. In 2014, professional player Joel \\"Emilio\\" Mako was banned during a live stream; he initially denied using a cheat, claiming it was caused by \\"a friend of his played on one of his smurfing accounts which mail is linked to his main account\\" Then in 2015, he admitted to using a cheat. Hovik \\"KQLY\\" Tovmassian, Simon \\"smn\\" Beck and Gordon \\"SF\\" Giry were banned shortly before they were scheduled to play at DreamHack Winter 2014. The ESEA League claimed the bans were a result of working with Valve directly. Simon \\"smn\\" Beck and Hovik \\"KQLY\\" Tovmassian both admitted to using cheats. In March 2020, Elias \\"Jamppi\\" Olkkonen filed a lawsuit against Valve, alleging that a lifetime VAC ban negatively affected his esports career, specifically his inability to play in Valve-sanctioned Major tournaments, which subsequently prevented him from signing onto the esports team OG. The VAC-ban is tied to an account which he previously owned when he was 14, and then sold to a friend who incurred the ban; the lawsuit alleges that a lifelong VAC ban for a minor, particularly without the ability to first plead his case, is unreasonable. A few users used to collect VAC bans, but this was eventually made VAC bans less prolific as Valve updated the interface, now showing \\"Multiple VAC bans on record\\" instead of the actual number.

In more abstract language, this means that the group homomorphism \\\\rho: G\\\\to GL(V) is injective (or one- to-one). Caveat: While representations of G over a field K are de facto the same as K[G]-modules (with K[G] denoting the group algebra of the group G), a faithful representation of G is not necessarily a faithful module for the group algebra. In fact each faithful K[G]-module is a faithful representation of G, but the converse does not hold. Consider for example the natural representation of the symmetric group S_n in n dimensions by permutation matrices, which is certainly faithful. Here the order of the group is n! while the n\\\\times n matrices form a vector space of dimension n^2. As soon as n is at least 4, dimension counting means that some linear dependence must occur between permutation matrices (since 24 > 16); this relation means that the module for the group algebra is not faithful. Properties A representation V of a finite group G over an algebraically closed field K of characteristic zero is faithful (as a representation) if and only if every irreducible representation of G occurs as a subrepresentation of S^nV (the n-th symmetric power of the representation V) for a sufficiently high n.

The aircraft was 24 years old at the time of the accident and had a Certificate of Airworthiness valid until November 2005. The aircraft had been involved in several incidents before the crash. On 29 January 2003, while rolling to take off from Achmad Yani International Airport in Semarang, the left engine caught fire. The tower tried to inform the crew of the situation, but the pilots were busy, and so they did not respond. After the aircraft was airborne, the tower repeated the information and the pilots answered, explaining that the No. 1 engine had failed. The pilot said that they would make a right turn to base. The aircraft landed safely. After inspection, it was found that the No. 1 engine was covered by animal wool. = Airline = Mandala Airlines was established in 1969 and is one of several low-cost airlines that serve the Indonesian archipelago. At the time of the accident it was 90% owned by a foundation set up by the Indonesian Army strategic reserve Kostrad (Komando Strategis Angkatan Darat). In 2006 it was acquired by Cardig International and Indigo Partners. It had 1,000 employees as of March 2007. = Crew = The captain was 34-year-old Askar Timur who had 7,552 flight hours, including 7,302 hours on the Boeing 737. The first officer was 31-year-old Daufir Efendi who had 2,353 total flight hours, with 685 of them on the Boeing 737. Accident Flight 091 departed for Soekarno-Hatta Airport, Jakarta from Medan. The plane's previous flight was from Jakarta and arrived at Medan uneventfully. The same crew had the flight scheduled on the same day and returned to Jakarta. The flight was a regular scheduled passenger flight and was attempting to take-off from Polonia Airport, Medan, North Sumatra to Jakarta, and it was the second trip of the day for the crew. At 10.02 WIB, Flight 091 received clearance for take-off with additional clearance from ATC to turn left heading 120 and maintain 1500 ft. The crew read back the clearance heading 120 and maintaining 1000 ft. The ATC corrected the clearance to ‚Äúone thousand five hundred feet.‚Äù The crew re-read it back as 1500 ft. The plane later took off. Some of the passengers and other witnesses stated that the aircraft had lifted its nose in an up attitude and take off roll was longer than that normally made by similar airplanes. Most of them stated that the aircraft nose began to lift-off a few meters from the end of the runway. The ATC tower controller recalled that after rotation the plane began to ‚Äúroll‚Äù or veer to the left and to the right. Eyewitnesses on the ground also reported the same. Witnesses stated that the plane shook violently (possibly indicating a stall). The airplane then overran the departure end of Runway 23, impacted several approach lights, traveled through a grass area and over a river. Some witnesses on the ground recalled that the airplane left wing struck a building before it struck in the busy road, then heard two large explosions and saw the flames. As the airplane came to rest, it fractured into three parts. The airplane was considered a total loss due to the impact forces and post-crash fire. The aircraft had been separated due to impact along the flight track beginning from the end of the runway 23, and then the aircraft came to a halt 540 m from the end of runway. Most of the fuselage section was destroyed by post-impact fire. The remaining part of the fuselage was only the tail section. Both engines detached from the aircraft due to the impact to the ground. The right engine was found about 300 m and the left engine about 400 m from the end of the Runway 23. =Rescue operation= At 10.25 AM local time, the ATC declared the airport closed. The airport fire brigade immediately responded to the crash bell activated by the ATC. When they arrived at the end of Runway 23 they realized that the crash site was outside the airport perimeter, and there was no access road to reach the accident site. When they arrived, the fire was still burning at the crash site. Several fire fighting units of the local government and ambulances participated in rescue operation. The local people, police and others were involved in the first hour of the rescue, and later on the Indonesian Air Force and Army assisted. Some victims were evacuated using commercial as well as private cars; it was due to the late arrival of the ambulances at the crash site and their limited number. At the crash site, there was no person in charge as the coordinator among the rescue teams. The overly crowded situation caused difficulties for the rescue teams in evacuating the victims. According to the witnesses, there were no labels for the victims and no triage area set-up as mentioned in the AEP. Moreover, the rescue team did not know where the uninjured passengers should be transferred to the collection area. The records/labels and the location of the victims were not well documented. The local people tried to rescue one of the pilots; however they were unable to release the pilot from his harness. It was because they were not familiar with aircraft components. While they were trying to save the pilot, the fire blast suddenly came from behind. When they saw the fire, they ran away to avoid the flames. According to them, one of the pilots was still alive at the time they found him. However, after the fire was extinguished, the pilot‚Äôs body was not found. The pilot seat was totally burnt. A person who stood close to a store saw that the fire started a few minutes after the aircraft crashed. He could not recall the exact time of the crash. He tried to rescue one of the victims to avoid the fire. According to other witnesses, the fire started a few minutes after the crash.  Passengers  Most of the flight's passengers were Indonesian, though the roster includes several passengers of other nationalities, including three Chinese and up to 20 others from different countries. All five crew members, 95 of the 112 passengers, and 49 people on the ground were killed. 15 of the 17 surviving passengers were injured. Twenty-six people on the ground were seriously injured in the accident. = Survivors = A passenger told Indonesian news channel MetroTV from hospital that he and five other people seated in the back of the plane in Row 20 had all survived. \\"There was the sound of an explosion in the front and there was fire and then the aircraft fell,\\" he said. The survivor said he escaped the blazing wreck by jumping through the torn fuselage and fleeing on foot as four large explosions erupted behind him. Another survivor stated that the aircraft seemed to be experiencing mechanical difficulties after take-off. \\"After take-off, the noise of the engine suddenly became very loud and the aircraft began shaking intensely before it suddenly fell,\\" he said. Investigation Fully extended flaps of a Boeing 737 The FDR and the CVR were found and sent to Washington to be read out by the NTSB in United States. They were found in good condition; however, the team experienced difficulty reading the Cockpit Area Microphone (CAM). The team also found that the channel from the CAM was masked by hum and noise dominating the signal. There were some voices heard on the CAM track; there were a number of step changes in background noise level and character that may have been consistent with an intermittent electrical connection in the CAM wiring circuit. As a result, the team was not able to conclude that the CAM was providing input to the CVR throughout the entire 30 minutes. Such a poor quality in CVR record failure makes it impossible to find out whether the flight crews made proper take-off configuration procedures including checklist execution. However several crew words, cockpit switch activations, engine noise, and cabin chime sounds heard on the CAM channel of the CVR were typically at a volume level much lower than the standard take off warning horn of the Boeing 737-200. The typical sound of the take-off configuration warning was not heard in the CVR CAM channel. The stick-shaker warning (typically as loud as or louder than the takeoff warning horn) was also not heard on the CVR CAM channel. Knowing that the aircraft had an incident involving one of its engines, investigators tore both engines down to know if there was any abnormalities on them. However, not a single indication of an engine failure was found on the engines. Hence, engine failure was ruled out by investigators. A cargo of durian was initially suspected of causing an overloaded condition The disassembly examination of both engines revealed there was no defect with the engines that contributed to the accident. Observers reported smelling durian fruit in the crash, leading to suggestions that the plane was overloaded with the fruit. The director of the airline initially denied that durian was on board, but later admitted that 2.7 tonnes were loaded. The NTSC confirmed that 2 tonnes of durian were on board. However, weight and balance examination also revealed that the actual aircraft take-off weight and center of gravity met the requirements and standards for take-off performance. The weather itself was not a factor in this accident. The official final report on the accident was released by the National Transportation Safety Committee (NTSC) of Indonesia on 1 January 2009. According to it the probable causes of the accident were the following: > *The aircraft took off with an improper take-off configuration, namely with > retracted flaps and slats causing the aircraft failed to lift off. *Improper > checklist procedure execution had led to failure to identify the flap in > retract position. *The aircraft's Take-off warning system horn was not heard > on the CAM channel of the CVR. It is possible that the take-off > configuration warning was not sounding.

After Bullmark's bankruptcy in 1977, Bullmark co-founder Saburo Ishizuki took charge of Ark and turned it into a full-fledged toy manufacturer. Ark released a variety of toys during the mid-to-late 1970s, including die-cast, soft vinyl, and inexpensive plastic toys. The Arklon toys were imported to the United States by the Marukai Trading Company. With one exception, King Kong (sold under the generic name \\"Mech-Gorilla\\" in the USA), all of the Arklon toys were based upon kaiju characters from the Ultraman television series. The unique designs, which Ishizuki has described as \\"my attempt to create character toys that could be enjoyed even by those unfamiliar with the given film or television series,\\" have made them favorites among Japanese toy collectors. The toys * King Joe (from Ultra Seven) - King Joe, one of Ultra Seven's popular foes, was the first character to be represented in toy form by Ark. The toy was released in two editions, one with show-accurate colors, and another far more colorful design. The latter was the only version released in the United States, whereas both versions were released in Japan. * Mecha Baltan Seijin (from Ultraman) - The name is a misnomer, both because it is one of the more organic-looking of the Ark designs, and because the toy is an inaccurate rendering of the Baltan of the original Ultraman series. * Mecha Black King (from Return of Ultraman) - Features a notoriously fragile waist joint. The head sculpt has attracted some praise. This toy was nicknamed \\"Yojimbo-Kaiju\\", meaning roughly \\"Bodyguard Monster\\"; the nickname derives from his role in Return of Ultraman, where Black King acted as a bodyguard to Nakuru Seijin). * Mecha Red King (from Ultraman) - Based on one of Ultraman's famous foes, Red King. Though similar to Mecha Black King, the two toys share very few actual pieces. Red King was nicknamed \\"Skull Monster.\\" * Mecha Gomora (from Ultraman) - One of the most esoteric portrayals of an Ultraman character in Ark's lineup, Gomora's hands are shovel-like scoops, his neck can extend a great length, and the toy includes a spring-powered car that can launch from Gomora's chest. * King Kong- Based on the famous film monster King Kong, this toy features a pair of spring-loaded \\"knives\\" that emerge from its nipples, a cardboard plane that can be launched from its stomach, and a ball-and-chain accessory. The King Kong toy was released in the United States under the name \\"Mech-Gorilla\\", so as to avoid the high costs of officially licensing the King Kong character.

The studio recording, featured on the Relics compilation album, was originally released in mono in 1968 as the B-side of the group's single \\"Point Me at the Sky\\"; live versions can also be found on various releases. Pink Floyd re-recorded the track for Italian director Michelangelo Antonioni's film Zabriskie Point, retitling it \\"Come In Number 51, Your Time Is Up\\" on the film's soundtrack album.Albums: Zabriskie Point (1970), Pink Floyd: Roger Waters revisited this theme in \\"One Of My Turns\\" from the Wall, in a lyric that reads \\"Run to the bedroom, in the suitcase on the left, You'll find my favourite axe.\\" The song was one of several to be considered for the band's \\"best of\\" album, Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd, but it was left off that compilation. It was included on the multi-artist Harvest compilation, A Breath of Fresh Air ‚Äì A Harvest Records Anthology 1969‚Äì1974 in 2007. Composition The music consists of a light, organ-based jam, with Richard Wright using the Phrygian mode and an accompanying bass guitar playing just one tone (in this case, D) in octaves, with a segue into the song's only lyrics: the title of the song whispered; followed by Roger Waters' scream. The song becomes much louder and more intense before gradually settling down again. In the heavier parts and later, quieter parts, David Gilmour can be heard with guitar and scat vocals; in concert, Gilmour would often sing along with his guitar line. For the soundtrack to the film The Committee, recorded in early 1968 (before the released version), one piece has the band playing a long instrumental featuring a very similar riff to this song. In the re- recording made for Zabriskie Point, retitled \\"Come In Number 51, Your Time Is Up\\", whispering and a choir were added. Gilmour and Waters provided the vocals, and Waters' screaming is noticeably louder. It is a complete instrumental; unlike the original \\"Careful with That Axe, Eugene\\", \\"Come in Number 51, Your Time Is Up\\" does not feature the spoken words \\"Careful with that axe, Eugene\\", and is in the key of E minor instead of the original D minor. In the film, it plays at the end during an explosion sequence filmed in slow motion. In the booklet of the soundtrack's reissue, David Fricke writes: \\"'Come In Number 51, Your Time Is Up' is a cryptically titled remake of the Floyd's volcanic 1968 B-side 'Careful With That Axe, Eugene.' But its bonfire sound‚Äîall roaring guitars, crashing drums, and death-throe screaming‚Äîis the perfect complement to the movie's cataclysmic finish.\\" The name \\"Come In Number 51, Your Time is Up\\" was a surrealistic line by comedian Spike Milligan shouted through a megaphone as part of his act in the BBC TV show Q5. Milligan's phrase, and means of delivery, was based on the type of command issued on boating lakes to individual boat renters to return to shore because their hourly rental period had expired. Yet another wholly instrumental remake was attempted during the Zabriskie Point sessions, and was eventually released as \\"Explosion\\" on The Early Years 1965‚Äì1972 box in 2016, as part of the 1970: Devi/ation volume. Live history Pink Floyd performed the song frequently in concert from 1968 to 1973 in progressively slower and alternative formats, and once at the Oakland Coliseum in 1977. An embryonic form was performed as early as 31 May 1968 (captured in a recording at the Paradiso in Amsterdam), under the original title of \\"Keep Smiling People\\",http://pinkfloydhyperbase.dk/unreleased/index.html#KEEP SMILING PEOPLE and another version was recorded on 25 June 1968 at the BBC Piccadilly Studios and broadcast on John Peel's Top Gear radio programme on 11 August 1968 with the title \\"Murderotic Woman\\", later re-titled \\"Murderistic Woman\\".Hodges, Nick and Priston, Ian (1999), Embryo: A Pink Floyd Chronology 1966‚Äì1971. Cherry Red Books, p. 126. A version was recorded live in May 1969 for the Ummagumma live disc. This version is considerably longer than its studio counterpart, as well as having the organ parts played on Wright's Farfisa Compact Duo rather than a Hammond. Footage also exists of the group performing the song live in Australia on GTK. The song was also played on their 1969 The Man and The Journey Tour, under the name \\"Beset by Creatures of the Deep\\". The live renditions on a whole were much slower, with the piece gradually building in intensity before a drum fill signalled Waters' screams. In the version recorded for Ummagumma the scream cues in the drum roll. Release history \\"Careful with That Axe, Eugene\\" was often performed under different titles and of varying durations. Until the release of The Early Years 1965‚Äì1972 only three versions had been officially released while many other versions were available on bootlegs. \\"Careful with That Axe, Eugene\\" has been released on the following releases: Audio only: * \\"Point Me at the Sky\\" single, B-side of the single; mono (5:46) * Relics, single version; stereo remix (5:46) * Ummagumma, a live rendition of the track (8:50) * Zabriskie Point, a re- working for the film soundtrack, re-titled \\"Come in Number 51, Your Time Is Up\\" (5:01) * The Early Years 1965‚Äì1972 ‚Äì various versions, see below  Volume 2 ‚Äì 1968: Germin/ation, appears as the single version (5:46) and a BBC session under the title \\"Murderotic Woman\\" (3:38)  Volume 3 ‚Äì 1969: Dramatis/ation, appears as live renditions from a BBC session (3:21), 'Live at the Paradiso' (10:09) and as part of The Man and The Journey under the title \\"Beset by Creatures of the Deep\\" (6:27)  Volume 4 ‚Äì 1970: Devi/ation, appears as live renditions from a BBC session (8:25) and as a re-working for the Zabriskie Point soundtrack under the title \\"Explosion\\" (5:47)  Volume 6 ‚Äì 1972: Obfusc/ation, appears on the Live at Pompeii CD.

Originally scheduled for release in July 2000, the album was intended to be their third studio album, following 1998‚Äôs Tin Planet. The album, briefly known as Bulletproof, was later rescheduled for 4 December 2001 but was never released. Most of the 14 tracks on the album were short love songs. The album was produced by Edwyn Collins. Only one single \\"Diary of a Wimp\\", was released from the intended album, reaching #49 in the UK. For many years, the album was set as license free, due to an early promo, CD-R, so it could be freely downloaded from the internet if a copy can be found. This was confirmed by the singer Tommy Scott, who when asked in Bristol in October 2009, apparently told a fan: \\"Oh God, that was meant to be released about ten years ago...

During the time of Prince Henry the Navigator, the cross came to be associated with the Portuguese discoveries and the Portuguese Empire. The cross can be considered a variant of the cross patt√©e or the cross potent. History Replica of a Portuguese caravel used during the Portuguese discoveries. Manueline balcony of Bel√©m Tower. As the Order of Christ, led by Prince Henry, the Navigator, was a leading developer of the Portuguese Discoveries, the Christ Cross was used on the sails of the Portuguese caravels, carracks and other ships involved in the exploration of the seas. Because of this, the emblem was forever associated with the Portuguese discoveries, making it one of the main symbols of the discoveries and of the Portuguese Overseas Empire. After, Manuel, duke of Beja and governor of the Order of Christ, having become King of Portugal, the Cross of Christ came to be regarded and used as a national emblem of Portugal. It has since become a generic Portuguese and, later, Brazilian emblem. After Pedro declared the independence of Brazil, and became Emperor of Brazil, the Cross of Christ was also present in the coat of arms and flag of the former Empire of Brazil. Since 1789, the Cross of Christ is depicted on the Sash of the Three Orders. It was also the symbol of the Movimento Nacional- Sindicalista, a Portuguese political movement of the early 1930s. Usage Today, the Cross of Christ is present in many flags and emblems of Portugal and Brazil. Examples are the flags of the city of S√£o Paulo and the Portuguese Autonomous Region of Madeira, the coat of arms of several Portuguese and Brazilian cities and municipalities, the badges of the Portuguese and Brazil national football teams and the roundels of the Portuguese Air Force aircraft.

The Japanese had captured the bastion from the United States Army Forces in the Far East during their 1942 invasion. The retaking of the island, officially named Fort Mills, along with the bloody battle to liberate Manila and the earlier recapture of the Bataan Peninsula, by invading U.S. forces from the occupying Japanese, marked the redemption of the American and Filipino surrender on 6 May 1942 and the subsequent fall of the Philippines. The surrender of Corregidor in 1942 and the ensuing fate of its 11,000 American and Filipino defenders led to a particular sense of moral purpose in General Douglas MacArthur, and as shown in the subsequent campaigns for the liberation of the Philippine archipelago, he showed no hesitation in committing the bulk of US and Philippine forces under his command. To the American soldier, Corregidor was more than a military objective; long before the campaign to recapture it, the Rock had become an important symbol in United States history as the last Pacific outpost of any size to fall to the enemy in the early stages of the Pacific War. Background =Capture of Corregidor= The Japanese opened their attack on Corregidor with an aerial bombardment on 29 December 1941, several days after MacArthur moved his headquarters there, but the heaviest attacks throughout the siege were from artillery based on nearby Cavite and later, on Bataan. When the last American and Filipino troops on the peninsula surrendered on 9 April 1942, the Japanese were able to mass artillery for an all-out attack of the Rock and its antiquated batteries. Including the Malinta Tunnel, the tunnel network that ran through the island's hills afforded protection to the defending garrison, but much of the defense activity had to be carried out in the open. By 4 May, many of the guns had been knocked out, the water supply was low, and casualties were mounting. Heavy shellfire preceded Japanese attempts to land the next night, the Japanese later admitted their amazement at the savage resistance, which accounted for the sinking of two thirds of their landing craft and losses amounting to 900 killed and 1,200 wounded, against US losses of 800 dead and 1,000 wounded. =Strategy for recapture= Corregidor in 1945‚Äîthough it lacked in importance to the defensive strategy of the Japanese that it previously had held for the Americans in early 1942‚Äîremained a formidable sentinel to the entrance to Manila Bay. Consequently, American planners thought it merited a separate attack. MacArthur's strategy was to make a combined amphibious and airborne assault‚Äîamong the most difficult of all modern military maneuvers‚Äîto retake the island. Although this particular plan of action had been used to good effect during the Luzon landings, the airborne phase was risky. As small as it was, at just over five square miles, the tadpole-shaped island made a difficult target for a parachute drop. Complicating the strategy, was that the paratroopers were required to land on a hill known as 'Topside', the island's foremost dominant terrain feature. MacArthur's staff balked at the proposal, but on the other hand, there was little choice. From 'Topside', the Japanese could dominate all possible amphibious landing sites. The American premise was that the Japanese would certainly not expect an airborne landing on such an unlikely target. The honors for recapturing the Rock went to the 503rd Parachute Regimental Combat Team of Lieutenant Colonel George M. Jones and elements of Major General Roscoe B. Woodruff's 24th Infantry Division, the same units which undertook the capture of Mindoro island. The 503rd PRCT included the 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment, Co. C, 161st Airborne Engineer Battalion, and elements of the 462nd Parachute Field Artillery Battalion with 75 mm pack howitzers.Smith 1963 also lists the 162nd Parachute Field Artillery Battalion, but it is not in the Rock Force list, and Stanton 1991, p. 401 shows this was not a parachute unit and it served in Europe. This may refer to fire support from fire support from Corregidor in the later recapture of Caballo Island by the 163rd Field Artillery Battalion, as listed at RockForce.org. They were airlifted by C-47 aircraft of the 317th Troop Carrier Group. The amphibious assault was by the reinforced 3rd Battalion, 34th Infantry Regiment, carried by Landing Craft Mechanized (LCMs) of the 592nd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment.Smith 1963, p. 341List of Rock Force units at Rockforce.org Battle =Bombardment= On 23 January 1945, the aerial bombing to soften up the defenses on Corregidor commenced. Daily strikes by heavy bombers of the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) continued until 16 February, with of bombs dropped. Estimated figures since the bombing campaign started up to 24 February showed 2,028 effective sorties, with of bombs dropped on Corregidor. On 13 February, the United States Navy added to the bombardment, with cruisers and destroyers shelling from close to shore and braving sporadic Japanese artillery counterfire, with minesweepers operating around the island by the next day. The softening up, or gloucesterizingfrom gloucesterize‚Äîa new verb coined for intense pre-invasion bombardment, after the same procedures were carried-out prior to the Marine landings on Cape Gloucester, New Britain in December 1943 (so-called after an intense pre-invasion bombardment of Cape Gloucester the previous December), of the island of Corregidor lasted for three more days. On 14 February, while assisting minesweeping operations prior to landings on Corregidor Island, the destroyer was hit by an enemy shell and set afire. Watertender First Class Elmer Charles Bigelow fought the blaze, contributing greatly to saving his ship, but was badly injured and died the next day. For his valor and personal sacrifice he was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. At sunrise on 16 February, attacks by Consolidated B-24 Liberators and an hour of low-altitude bombing and strafing runs by Douglas A-20s preceded the landings. =Touchdown on Topside= At 08:33 on 16 February, barely three minutes late from their intended time, and facing 16‚Äì18 knot winds over the drop zones, the first of one thousand troopers of the 503rd PRCT based at Mindoro, began dropping out of C-47 troop carriers of the US 317th Troop Carrier Group of the 5th Air Force and to float down on the surprised Japanese defenders, remnants of Maj. Gen. Rikichi Tsukada's Kembu Group at the two tiny go-point areas of Topside's western heights. However, some paratroopers were blown back into Japanese held territory. No troopers drowned, although some who were unable to climb the cliffs through hostile territory, or had fallen close to the rocks, had to be rescued near Wheeler Point. Paratroopers of the 503rd PRCT descend on Corregidor, 16 February 1945. Despite the grueling air and naval bombardment that left the defending troops dazed and scattered, they vigorously rallied, and fierce fighting erupted almost immediately. At one point that same morning, they threatened to drive a salient into the paratroopers' tenuous foothold on 'Topside'. Paratroopers and infantrymen waged a tenacious battle with the well dug-in and determined enemy. Private Lloyd G. McCarter, a scout attached to the 503rd, during the initial landing on 16 February, crossed of open ground under intense fire and at point-blank range silenced a machine gun with hand grenades. In the next few days, he inflicted heavy casualties on the Japanese, but was seriously wounded; McCarter was awarded the Medal of Honor. =Battle of Banzai Point= The most ferocious battle to regain Corregidor occurred at Wheeler Point on the night of 18 February and early the next morning, when D and F Companies, 2nd Battalion, 503rd PRCT, settled down in defensive positions near Battery Hearn and Cheney Trail. At 22:30 under a black, moonless night, 500 Japanese marines came out of the Battery Smith armory and charged the American and the Philippine positions. (This was also the night Pvt. McCarter earned his Medal of Honor). F Company stopped the attacks by the Japanese trying to break through to the south. Any minor breakthrough by the charge would have been cut short by the rear echelons. Aside from flares fired throughout the night by warships laying offshore, the three-hour battle was decided by the weapons of the 50 paratroopers ranged against the Japanese Special Landing Force, among the best of the Empire's fighting men. Not all men of the company were involved in the fighting because of the ensuing confusion. The savage encounter ended in failure with more than 250 Japanese corpses strewn along a stretch of Cheney Trail. F Company suffered 14 dead and 15 wounded. This was the first significant attack by the Japanese on Corregidor. Official historians of the 503rd refer to Wheeler Point as \\"Banzai Point\\". =Seizure of Malinta Hill= 34th Infantry lands at San Jose Point At the same time the 503rd paratroopers touched down at 'Topside', the first wave of 3rd Battalion under Lt. Col. Edward M. Postlethwait of the 24th Infantry Division's 34th Infantry Regiment (under Col. Aubrey S. \\"Red\\" Newman) waded ashore and established a beachhead at San Jose Point on the eastern end of Corregidor named 'Black Beach'. The succeeding waves of troops took the brunt of the hastily organized Japanese defense, and several landing craft and infantrymen became victims of landmines. The battalion pushed inland against sporadic resistance, mostly from groups coming out of the subterranean passages of the island to waylay the advancing American troops. Two 3rd Battalion units‚ÄîK and L Companies under Captains Frank Centanni and Lewis F. Stearns, respectively‚Äîmanaged to secure the road and both northern and southern entrances to Malinta Hill, while Capt. Gilbert Heaberlin's A Company stationed itself near the waterline. I Company‚Äîunder 1st Lt. Paul Cain‚Äîoccupied the North Dock and guarded the harbor. They intended to keep the Japanese troops inside the tunnel as other units moved inland, accompanied by tanks and flamethrowers; weapons that devastated pillboxes and tunnels in the surrounding areas held by the Japanese. For eight straight days until 23 February, these units staved off successive banzai charges, mortar attacks, and a suicide squad of soldiers with explosives strapped to their bodies; they killed over 300 Japanese. On 21 February at 21:30 near Malinta Hill, a few dozen Japanese survivors were killed attacking US positions following a large explosion. Two nights later, a similar attack happened. Subsequently, American engineers poured and ignited large quantities of gasoline down the tunnels. The lack of Japanese activity afterwards implied that the Japanese garrison had been wiped out. There were no more organized Japanese attacks for the rest of the campaign. Only isolated pockets of resistance continued to fight on until 26 February, when Corregidor was declared secured. Aftermath The remains of a Japanese cave Large numbers of Japanese troops drowned while attempting to swim away from the Rock. Many of them, estimated in the thousands, sealed themselves in the numerous subterranean passages of the island. In compliance with the philosophy of Bushid≈ç, the defenders, hiding in caves and tunnels like the ones at Malinta Hill, preferred to commit suicide rather than surrender. Corregidor reverberated with many underground explosions for days afterward. There were very few Japanese soldiers captured. An M4 Sherman tank fired a shell into a sealed tunnel suspected of harboring Japanese soldiers but which instead contained tons of stored ammunition. The subsequent explosion threw the tank several dozen feet, killing its crew and 48 US soldiers nearby, and wounded more than 100 others in the immediate area. By 1 March, the devastated island bastion, with its harbor, the finest in the East, was officially opened to Allied shipping. Six days later, on 7 March, Gen. MacArthur returned to the island fortress he had been forced to leave three years before. \\"I see that the old flagpole still stands. Have your troops hoist the colors to its peak and let no enemy ever again haul it down\\", he said, at the ceremonial raising of the Stars and Stripes. The perfectly coordinated triphibious American assault to recapture Corregidor left the 503rd PRCT with 169 dead and 531 wounded. The 34th Infantry Regiment suffered 38 killed and 153 wounded. Of the 2,065 men of both lifts by the 503rd PRCT, about 280 were killed or severely injured. Three men suffered parachute malfunctions, and two men who collided with buildings died. Eight men were killed either in the air or before they were able to get free of their chutes, a further 50 were wounded in the air or upon landing. Several men were missing in action at the drop. The total injuries (not by wounding) on the drop were 210. Japanese sources have estimated that there were about 6,700 Japanese on the island when the 503rd PRCT and 34th Infantry landed, of which only 50 survived. Another 19 were taken prisoner, and 20 Japanese holdouts surfaced after the war on 1 January 1946. Corregidor today is a premium tourist destination in the Philippines. Over the years, most of the decrepit artillery pieces and significant battle sites on the island have been restored as important historical landmarks.

The ALAB is headquartered in Monroeville, Alabama and is owned and operated by Pioneer Railcorp of Peoria, Illinois. The railroad operates of railroad from Flomaton, Alabama to Peterman, Alabama. On April 18, 2019, the railroad filed to abandon its entire line. History The route of the Alabama Railroad was originally constructed over several years (between 1880‚Äì1901) as the Pensacola & Selma Railroad and quickly became a part of the Louisville & Nashville Railroad network. The original line proceeded north from Corduroy, Alabama, to Selma, Alabama. That portion of the line was abandoned by the Seaboard System prior to the merger with CSX in 1986. There was also a L&N; branch that went to Camden from a junction just northeast of Corduroy that was abandoned prior to the merger into the Seaboard System in 1986. The remainder of the line north of Peterman, Alabama, was abandoned in approximately 1994 to include an 800+ foot tunnel built in 1899 located at Tunnel Springs, Alabama. The ALAB connects with CSX Transportation at Flomaton, Alabama. The railroad serves three industries located in Monroeville, Alabama, and stores railcars for other railroads. The ALAB serves Temple Inland with outbound shipments of particle board and veneer, a cement powder transload operated by Gate Precast, and Harrigan Lumber after its re- opening in 2010. The railroad operates three EMD GP20 locomotives on a bi- weekly basis. The Alabama Railroad had several bridges and trestles found to be deficient in late 2016, and subsequently the railroad has had an embargo placed on loaded freight cars. Many empty surplus oil tank cars have been placed into storage on the ALAB's tracks and the storage fees now compose much of the company's revenue. Tracks through the Tunnel Hill tunnel and northwards have been removed; a local plan exists to make the tunnel part of a rails-to- trails project.Trains magazine, February 2017.

A complex magnesium silicate, a typical chemical formula for which is Mg4Si6O15(OH)2¬∑6H2O, it can be present in fibrous, fine- particulate, and solid forms. Originally named meerschaum by Abraham Gottlob Werner in 1788, it was named sepiolite by Ernst Friedrich Glocker in 1847 for an occurrence in Bettolino, Baldissero Canavese, Torino Province, Piedmont, Italy. The name comes from Greek sepion (œÉŒÆœÄŒπŒøŒΩ), meaning \\"cuttlebone\\" (the porous internal shell of the cuttlefish), + lithos (ŒªŒØŒ∏ŒøœÇ), meaning stone, after a perceived resemblance of this mineral to cuttlebone. Because of its low specific gravity and its high porosity, it may float upon water, hence its German name. It is sometimes found floating on the Black Sea and rather suggestive of sea-foam, hence the German origin of the name as well as the French name for the same substance, √©cume de mer.  Characteristics  Sepiolite is opaque and off-white, grey or cream colour, breaking with a conchoidal or fine earthy fracture, and occasionally fibrous in texture. Due to the fact it can be readily scratched with the finger nail, its hardness is ranked at about 2 on the Mohs scale. The specific gravity varies from 0.988 to 1.279, but the porosity of the mineral may lead to error. Sepiolite is a hydrous magnesium silicate having the chemical formula Mg4Si6O15(OH)2¬∑6H2O. When first extracted, sepiolite is soft. However, it hardens on exposure to sun heat or when dried in a warm room.  Location  Most of the sepiolite of commerce is obtained chiefly from the plain of Eski≈üehir in Turkey, between Istanbul and Ankara. It occurs there in irregular nodular masses, in alluvial deposits, which are extensively worked for its extraction. It is said that in this district, there are 4000 shafts leading to horizontal galleries for extraction of the sepiolite. The principal workings are at Sepet√ßi Ocaƒüƒ± and Kemik√ßi Ocaƒüƒ±, about 20 miles southeast of Eski≈üehir. The mineral is associated with magnesite (magnesium carbonate), the primitive source of both minerals being a serpentine. Sepiolite is also found, though less abundantly, in Greece, as at Thebes, and in the islands of Euboea and Samos. It occurs also in serpentine at Hrubschitz near Kromau in Moravia. Additionally, sepiolite is found to a limited extent at certain localities in France and Spain, and is known in Morocco. In the United States, it occurs in serpentine in Pennsylvania (as at Nottingham, Chester County) and in South Carolina and Utah. Sepiolite occurs as a secondary mineral associated with serpentine. It can occur as a precipitate in arid environments. It may be associated with dolomite and opal. Owing to its fibrous mineral nature, sepiolite veins may contain the hazardous material asbestos; however, this is true of only a very rare form of sepiolite, as the two are formed in very different environments. Even where asbestos is not present, sepiolite is often mistaken for it. Careful analytical techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD) are able to easily distinguish the two. Carved Turkish meerschaum products traditionally were made in manufacturing centers such as Vienna. Since the 1970s, though, Turkey has banned the exportation of meerschaum nodules, trying to set up a local meerschaum industry. The once famous manufacturers have therefore disappeared and European pipe producers turned to others sources for their pipes. In the African Great Lakes region, large deposits of meerschaum were found in Tanganyika. The main deposit comes from the Amboseli basin surrounding the Lake Amboseli. Tanganyika Meerschaum is normally stained in shades of brown, black and yellow, and is considered to be somewhat inferior to Meerschaum from Turkey. The raw material was primarily mined by the Tanganyika Meerschaum Corporation and uncounted pipemakers throughout the world were supplied with Amboseli Meerschaum.  Applications  smoking pipe carved from meerschaum. = Carved pipes = Meerschaum has occasionally been used as a substitute for soapstone, fuller's earth, and as a building material; but its chief use is for smoking pipes and cigarette holders. The first recorded use of meerschaum for making pipes was around 1723 and quickly became prized as the perfect material for providing a cool, dry, flavorful smoke. The porous nature of meerschaum draws moisture and tobacco tar into the stone. Meerschaum became a premium substitute for the clay pipes of the day and remains prized to this day, though since the mid-1800s briar pipes have become the most common pipes for smoking. When smoked, meerschaum pipes gradually change color, and old meerschaums will turn incremental shades of yellow, orange, red, and amber from the base on up. When prepared for use as a pipe, the natural nodules are first scraped to remove the red earthy matrix, then dried, again scraped and polished with wax. The crudely shaped masses thus prepared are turned and carved, smoothed with glass-paper, heated in wax or stearine, and finally polished with bone-ash, etc. = Other uses and substitutes= In Somalia and Djibouti, sepiolite is used to make the dabqaad, a traditional incense burner. The mineral is mined in the town of El Buur, the latter of which serves as a center for quarrying. El Buur is also the place of origin of the local pipe-making industry. Imitations are made in plaster of Paris and other preparations. The soft, white, earthy mineral from L√•ngbanshyttan, in V√§rmland, Sweden, known as aphrodite (), is closely related to sepiolite. In construction, sepiolite can be used in lime mortars as water reservoir. Processes for bacterial transformation based on the Yoshida effect can utilize sepiolite as an acicular nanofiber.

Kelton Flinn is an American computer game designer who is a major pioneer in online games. He is a co-founder (with his University of Virginia classmate John Taylor) of the seminal online game company Kesmai, which they began in 1982. His best known title is the first graphical multi-player online game offered by a major service, Air Warrior (1987). 1970s university mainframe games Like Marc Blank, Will Crowther, Don Daglow and Gregory Yob, Flinn and Taylor were key innovators in the 1970s university gaming culture, where students played for free on college mainframe computers. Flinn took advantage of his pursuit of an advanced degree (a PhD in Applied Mathematics) to build a long series of games across his undergraduate and graduate school career. Most students lost all access to computers after graduation in the days before personal computers were invented, but Flinn's extended years of study gave him the chance to build a large body of major works. Key games Flinn and Taylor created during this time include: * Air (1977‚Äì1979) ‚Äî a text air combat game that foreshadowed Air Warrior. The first version was created in 1977 and worked on through 1979. As Flinn has said: \\"If Air Warrior was a primate swinging in the trees, AIR was the text-based amoeba crawling on the ocean floor. But it was quasi-real time, multi-player, and attempted to render 3-D on the terminal using ASCII graphics. It was an acquired taste.\\"Mulligan, Jessica Bridgette Patrovsky Developing Online Games: An Insiders Guide New Riders 2003 p. 443 * S ‚Äî a multi-player space colonization and combat game (1979). Flinn and Taylor wrote the game over their summer vacations at the University of Virginia. MegaWars III would be based on S after they founded Kesmai. * Dungeons of Kesmai (1980) ‚Äî a text adventure game with very little puzzle solving and an emphasis on exploration and combat. The game's name would also appear later as a text-based online adventure from Kesmai. Flinn and Taylor had seen and played Adventure and Zork, but chose to emphasize action in their title, again written during their summer vacations as college students. * Island of Kesmai (1981) ‚Äî expands on their gaming system, in this case trying to use all the power of the university's new VAX computer. They added rich text descriptions to the ASCII graphic maps and minimal combat feedback text of their prior games. The university reported‚Äîto its dismay‚Äîthat the game did indeed use all the processing power of the new VAX. Founding of Kesmai In 1982 Flinn and Taylor founded the game developer Kesmai, and began working with CompuServe to offer multi-player games on a fee-per-hour basis. But once they began porting their code it turned out that the code that ran for free on the university's computer was hugely inefficient, and they burned $100,000 USD in computer time on CompuServe's system in three days before concluding they needed to rewrite their engine. Kesmai's major titles include: * Mega Wars III (1983) ‚Äî Ironically, it was the chance to create Mega Wars III for CompuServe in 1983 that allowed Kesmai to adapt S for the system and make it available for online play. Another irony: Not one of the Mega Wars games are related to each other except by name; the original was based on the old university mainframe game DECWAR. * Island of Kesmai (1985) ‚Äî The rewrite of Flinn and Taylor's old text action adventure game went live at the end of 1985 after a long internal test cycle. It cost $6 an hour at 300 baud (the slow dial-up modems of the day), $12 for 1200 baud (the fast dial-up modems). * Stellar Warrior (1985) ‚Äî This rewrite of Mega Wars III introduced substantially simplified game play to expand its potential audience, and debuted on the GEnie online service the same day that Islands of Kesmai went live on CompuServe. * Air Warrior (1986) ‚Äî This game, offered on GEnie, is a key milestone in the history of computer games because it was the first commercial multiplayer online game to add graphics, displaying a 3D airplane dogfight environment. (The original Neverwinter Nights, which was the first MMORPG to use graphics, was not to debut until a full five years later in 1991). The original game was on the Apple Macintosh, and was followed by Amiga and Atari ST versions; the IBM PC version debuted in 1987. In another major innovation, Kesmai combined Mac, Amiga, Atari ST, and IBM PC players all in the same game, flying against each other. * Multiplayer BattleTech: EGA (1991) ‚Äî This title takes the Air Warrior concept to land-based Mech combat. The game had some problems with frame rate and latency due to the need for the computer to draw more terrain in land- based displays than it needed to draw when planes are flying in the air and much of the background is plain blue sky.

He taught at the Institute of Cultural and Linguistic studies at Keio University in Tokyo, the Iranian institute of Philosophy in Tehran, and McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. He was fluent in over 30 languages, including Arabic, Persian, Sanskrit, Pali, Chinese, Japanese, Russian and Greek.  Life and academic career  He was born on 4 May 1914 in a wealthy family in Tokyo, Japan. From an early age, he was familiar with zen meditation and k≈çan, since his father was also a calligrapher and a practising lay Zen Buddhist. He entered the faculty of economics at Keio University, but transferred to the department of English literature wishing to be instructed by Professor Junzabur≈ç Nishiwaki. Following his bachelor's degree, he became a research assistant in 1937. In 1958, he completed the first direct translation of the Qur'an from Arabic to Japanese. (The first indirect translation had been accomplished a decade prior by Okawa Shumei.) His translation is still renowned for its linguistic accuracy and widely used for scholarly works. He was extremely talented in learning foreign languages, and finished reading the Qur'an a month after beginning to learn Arabic. Between 1969-75, he became professor of Islamic philosophy at McGill University in Montreal. He was the professor of philosophy in the Iranian institute in philosophy, formerly Imperial Iranian Academy of Philosophy, in Tehran, Iran. He came back to Japan from Iran after the Revolution in 1979, and he wrote, seemingly more assiduously, many books and articles in Japanese on Oriental thought and its significance. In understanding Izutsu's academic legacy, there are four points to bear in mind: his relation to Buddhism, particularly Zen Buddhism, his interest in language, his inclination towards postmodernism, and his interest in comparative philosophy. In Sufism and Taoism: A comparative study of key philosophical concepts (1984), he compares the metaphysical and mystical thought-systems of Sufism and Taoism and discovers that, although historically unrelated, the two share features and patterns.

It is situated halfway between Walsall and Wolverhampton on the busy main A4124 and A462 roads. History About the name \\"New Invention\\": > This hamlet owes its strange name to a simple circumstance. The tennant of > the first house erected there was annoyed by a smoky chimney, and he > contrived an ingenious apparatus to remedy the evil. ... he invited every > visitor to see his 'new invention' as he called it. ... it was applied to > distinguish his house ... and others ... adopted it also.Timmins, S., > Birmingham and the Midland hardware district, Routledge, 1968, p. 88n. Hackwood states that the invention was \\"a hawthorn bush which was pushed out the top of his chimney.\\"Hackwood, FW., The annals of Willenhall, 1908, Reprinted by Echo publications, 2010, p. 148. It has rich coal deposits and a significant mining past, with many extensive mines being located in the area during the 19th and early 20th centuries, including primarily 'The Sneyd Colliery'. One present day landmark still running through the area, having extensive ties with the coal mining history, is the Wyrley and Essington Canal. The 'Curly Wyrley' was once used to transport coal via narrowboat to fuel industry in the neighbouring industrial havens of Walsall, Wednesbury and Dudley, seeing that New Invention, and Black Country, coal played a key part in the success of the British Empire. The coal and industry has now disappeared and the canal serves as a pathway toward the factory lined towpaths of Walsall. There are also strong links to the area's lock and key making history, with two major factories formerly being located here, 'Yale' locks and 'Squires' locks. Yale closed during the 1980s and Squires was demolished during the mid-2000s, due to the age of the building, and relocated in Essington. The urban development of New Invention mainly began during the 1950s; prior to this it was a largely rural settlement dominated mainly by farmland and rural collieries. However, following a population increase in Willenhall and a need for new housing, New Invention was developed. The most recent major housing development to be completed was the Coppice Farm estate, which was mainly built throughout the 1980s and early 1990s. Methodist preacher John Wesley once stopped in the village after being stoned and forced out of Willenhall. New Invention being, in those days, considerably more isolated from Willenhall than it is today. According to Wesley \\"I proceeded thence to New Invention, where I met with civility and kindness.\\" Perhaps in recognition of John Wesley part of the present day A462 road is in fact named Wesley Road. Transport The area is well served by transport links, being only 3 miles from the M6 motorway - linking it with the North, South and East of the country, and is also close to the M54 motorway, linking the area to the West and Wales. A number of public transport services operate in New Invention, due to its location on the busy main Lichfield Road. These are mostly operated by National Express West Midlands and Diamond West Midlands. The nearest railway station is Bloxwich railway station and the nearest West Midlands Metro tram stop is in Wolverhampton. Facilities The main shopping area is based around The Square, a small parade with shops on three sides. New Invention Methodist Church is now closed but the area is served by two other churches, Short Heath Methodist Church and Holy Trinity Short Heath. Several pubs in the locality include The Broadway and The Milestone. A former early 18th century inn, 'The Gate', has been redeveloped into a Chinese and Indian takeaways. Two doctors surgeries and a dentist's practice also operate in the area. Education The area also has a number of schools, including New Invention Infant School, New Invention Junior School and Beacon Primary School. The nearest Secondary school was the Black Country University Technical College (formerly Sneyd Community School), located on the border of New Invention and Bloxwich, that provided technical courses to 14- to 19-year- olds. This facility closed as an educational establishment several years ago and now serves only as a community centre. Geography The area has some green spaces including Coppice Farm open space, the Wyrley & Essington canal and Sneyd reservoir (developed to provide water to the locks of the former Wyrley branch of the canal).

Recall that a Fourier series is only suitable to the analysis of periodic (or finite-domain) functions f(x) with period 2œÄ. It can be expressed as an infinite series of sinusoids: :f(x) = \\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} F_n \\\\,e^{inx} where F_n is the amplitude of the individual harmonics. In SCA however, one decomposes the spectrum into optimized discrete frequencies. As a consequence, and as the period of the sampled function is supposed to be infinite or not yet known, each of the discrete periodic functions that compose the sampled function fragment can not be considered to be a multiple of the fundamental frequency: :f(x) = \\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} F_n \\\\,e^{i \\\\omega_n x}. As such, SCA does not necessarily deliver 2 \\\\pi periodic functions, as would have been the case in Fourier analysis. For real-valued functions, the SCA series can be written as: :f(x) = \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty\\\\left[A_n \\\\cos(\\\\omega_n x)+B_n \\\\sin(\\\\omega_n x)\\\\right] + C(x) where An and Bn are the series amplitudes. The amplitudes can only be solved if the series of values \\\\omega_n is previously optimized for a desired objective function (usually least residuals). C(x) is not necessarily the average value over the sampled interval: one might prefer to include predominant information on the behavior of the offset value in the time domain. Etymology SCA deals with the prediction problem of continuing a frequency spectrum beyond a sampled (usually stochastic) time series fragment. Unlike ordinary Fourier analysis that infinitely repeats an observed function period or time domain, SCA filters the exact composing frequencies out of the observed spectrum and let them continue (resp. precede) in the time domain. In the scientific terminology, therefore preference is given to the term continuation rather than for instance extrapolation. Algorithm An algorithm is required to cope with several problems: detrending, decomposition, frequency resolution optimization, superposition, transformation and computational efficiency. * Detrending or trend estimation. * Decomposition. Since discrete Fourier transform is inherently related to Fourier analysis, this type of spectral analysis is by definition not suitable for spectrum decomposition in SCA. DFT (or FFT) may provide however an initial approximation, which often speeds up the decomposition. * Improving frequency resolution. After decomposition of a discrete frequency, it should be filtered for optimal resolution (i.e. varying three parameters: frequency value, amplitude and phase). * Transformation. Spectrum dispersion Compared to DFT (or FFT), which is characterized by perfect spectral resolution, but poor temporal information, SCA favours temporal information, but yields higher spectrum dispersion. This property shows where the analytic strength of SCA is located. For instance, discrete composing frequency resolution is by definition far better in SCA than in DFT.

Xian composed in all the major musical forms (two symphonies, a violin concerto, four large scale choral works, nearly 300 songs and an opera), and is best known for the Yellow River Cantata upon which the Yellow River Concerto for piano and orchestra is based. Early life and education Xian was born in Portuguese Macau in 1905, to Tanka parents whose ancestors were from Panyu, Guangdong. He moved frequently in his early life with his mother as his father had died before Xian was born. Xian moved with his mother to Singapore when he was six years old, he was enrolled in Yangzheng Primary School for his primary education. It was while at Yangzheng Primary School that he took his first step into his musical career. His teacher, Ou Jianfu, first noticed Xian Xinghai's musical talent, and he was enrolled into the school's military band. Xian received training in both musical instruments as well as musical theory. He was later brought to Guangzhou for further education by his then school principal, Lin Yaoxiang, along with 19 other students. Xian started learning the clarinet in 1918 at the YMCA charity school attached to the Lingnan University in Guangzhou (Canton). In 1924 he studied in Saint Andrew's School of Singapore. In 1926 he joined the National Music Institute at Peking University to study music and in 1928 he entered National Shanghai Conservatory of Music to study violin and piano. The same year he published his well-known essay The Universal Music. In 1929 he went to Paris (where he met Ma Sicong who introduced him to many artists there) and in 1934 became the first Chinese student to be admitted to the Paris Conservatory to study senior composition with Paul Dukas; prior to this, he had studied with Vincent D'Indy. During this period he composed Wind, Song of a Wanderer, Violin Sonata in D Minor, and other works.  Career  Xian returned to China in 1935 to the Japanese occupation of the northeastern part of the country (known then as Manchuria). Using his music as a weapon to protest the occupation, he took part in patriotic activities. During the Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945), he wrote vocal works that encouraged the people to fight the Japanese invaders, including Saving the Nation, Non-Resistance the Only Fear, Song of Guerrillas, The Roads Are Opened by Us, The Vast Siberia, Children of the Motherland, Go to the Homefront of the Enemy, and On the Taihang Mountains, among others. He worked for film studios before going to the Communist headquarters in Yan'an, where he became dean of the Music Department at Lu Xun Institute of Arts in 1938. It is at this time that he composed the famous Yellow River Cantata and the Production Cantata. Tomb of Xian Xinghai In 1940, Xian used the assumed name Huang Xun. In 1940 Xian went to the Soviet Union to compose the score of the documentary film Yan'an and the Eighth Route Army. Before departure Mao Zedong invited him to dinner. In 1941 the German invasion of the Soviet Union disrupted his work and he attempted to return to China by way of Xinjiang but the local anti-communist warlord, Sheng Shicai, blocked the way and he got stranded in Almaty, Kazakhstan. It was here that he composed the symphonies Liberation of the Nation and Sacred War, and the suites Red All Over the River and Chinese Rhapsody for winds and strings. During Xian's career, he has composed over 300 works and published 35 papers, including Nie Er-the Creator of New Chinese Music.  Works  * 1939 Yellow River Cantata  Personal life  Xian developed pulmonary tuberculosis due to overwork and malnutrition. After the war, Xian return to Moscow for medical treatment but died of pulmonary disease on October 30, 1945 at the age of 40. Legacy Xian's influence in Chinese music won him the title People's Composer. During the Cultural Revolution (1966‚Äì1976), when all the Western and some Chinese art was forbidden, the pianist Yin Chengzong arranged the Yellow River Cantata into a concerto for piano and orchestra, by the name of Yellow River Piano Concerto (1969). After China opened its doors to the world in late 1970s, Yin planned the performance of the piano concerto. There was a debate whether some politically incorrect anthems like \\"The East Is Red\\", which Yin interpolated into the concerto, should be removed. It was decided that the work itself was a cultural legacy of the time when it was created, the melodies reminding listeners of that period and creating a unique sense of history. Hence, the work remained intact as it was originally arranged. Beginning in the 1970s, the Yellow River Concerto has been heard in the West, often performed by Yin Chengzong himself, and in 1988 the Italian pianist Riccardo Caramella became the first Western pianist who performed it in China with a Chinese orchestra, the Beijing Radio Symphony Orchestra. In 2009, the epic film The Star and The Sea was created by directors Qiankuan Li and Guiyun Xiao. The film is about the hard childhood and suffering of Xian in that period of his life and the efforts of his mother to help him developing his musical talents. In 2011, the film won the Huabiao Film AAwardfor Outstanding Children's Film. In May 2019, a movie titled The Composer directed by Xierzhati Yahefu was released. The movie relate Xian's life story from 1941, when he was in Moskow, to his death in 1945.

It ceased operating in 2012 when its assets were acquired by Watco Companies' Birmingham Terminal Railway. History The Birmingham Southern Railroad Company was organized on March 3, 1899. The line was originally built between 1878 from Birmingham to Pratt City, AL to haul coal to the steel mills in Birmingham. The line was extended to Ensley in 1887. The Louisville and Nashville Railroad and the Southern Railway jointly purchased and operated the Birmingham Southern shortly after the Birmingham Southern's organization. The Birmingham Southern was later sold to the Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company, which in 1906 became a part of the United States Steel Corporation and remained a U.S.S. Corp. subsidiary until 1988. The railroad expanded its lines in the western industrial section of Jefferson County by 1910. In 1966, the Birmingham Southern acquired the 18-mile Federal Barge Lines (also known as the Barge Line Railroad) that ran from Ensley to Port Birmingham, giving the Birmingham Southern access to Mobile, AL via the barge lines of the Warrior River. The Barge Line Railroad track was formerly owned by the Southern Railway. In 1988 the Birmingham Southern was sold to Transtar, Inc., the transportation subsidiary of United States Steel. In 1989, United States Steel sold Transtar and Transtar became a privately held company specializing in the operation of short line railroads and barge lines that primarily serve United States Steel and its successors. On May 17, 2007, Birmingham Southern Railroad was awarded a Gold E. H. Harriman Award in the S&T; Group for the railroad's 2006 safety record.

All of what is now Midori Ward was part of the holdings of Owari Domain during the Edo period. The T≈çkaid≈ç post town of Narumi-juku prospered under the Tokugawa shogunate. After the Meiji Restoration, the area was organized into villages under Aichi District or northern Chita District within Aichi Prefecture. Narumi became a town in 1889, followed by Arimatsu in 1890 and Odaka in 1895. Efforts to merge these towns with the neighboring city of Nagoya began in 1953 and 1955, but were virulently opposed by the local residents, resulting recall motions for town mayors, and eventually violent riots. On April 1, 1963, after a third referendum, Narumi was annexed by Nagoya, becoming the new ward of Midori. Narumi was followed by Odaka and a portion of Arimatsu on December 1, 1964 with each of the former towns retaining its own local sub-ward office and considerable local autonomy. These sub-ward offices were amalgamated into a new Midori Ward office on January 21, 1974; however, the sub-wards were retained as local administrative divisions until 2007.

She led her troops in a rebellion against late Roman rule, riding at the head of her army into Phoenicia and Palestine. After reaching the frontiers of Egypt and repeatedly defeating the Roman army, the Romans finally made a truce with her on conditions she stipulated.Jensen, 1996, pp. 73-75. The Romans later called upon her for assistance when being attacked by the Goths, to which she responded by sending a force of cavalry. Considered to be \\"the most powerful woman in the late antique Arabia after Zenobia,\\"Bowersock et al., 1999, p. 569. much of what is known about Mavia comes from early, almost contemporaneous accounts, such as the writings of Rufinus, thought to be derived from a now lost account by Gelasius of Caeserea. Later authors transformed her into a Christian of Roman stock, though she was evidently Arab, and perhaps initially pagan. Biography The ancestors of Mavia, whose Arabic name was Mawiyya, were Tanukhids, a loose affiliation of Arab tribes that migrated northwards from the Arabian peninsula a century before Mavia was born, because of growing Sassanian influence in Eastern Arabia. Mavia's husband was al-Hawari, the last king of the semi-nomadic Tanukh confederation in southern Syria in the latter half of the fourth century.Ball, 2001, p. 98-102. When he died in 375 CE without leaving an heir, Mavia rose to command the confederation in a revolt against Roman rule that extended throughout the Levant. The reasons for the revolt are thought to have been religious. After al-Hawari's death, the Roman emperor Valens, an Arian heterodox, decided to disregard the requests of the Arabs for an orthodox bishop, insisting on the appointment of an Arian bishop instead. Mavia withdrew from Aleppo into the desert with her people, forming alliances with desert Arabs and gaining support throughout much of Arabia and Syria, in preparation for the fight against Roman rule. It is unclear as to whether Mavia herself was Christian at this time or not. Some historians report that it was during her military exploits that she met an ascetic monk who so impressed her that she converted to orthodox Christianity. All agree, however, that the conditions she set for any truce with Rome, was this monk's appointment as bishop over her people. =Details of the revolt= It was in the spring of 378 CE that Mavia launched the massive revolt against the central government, often compared to that launched by Zenobia a century earlier. Her forces, which she often led personally, swept into Arabia and Palestine and reached the edges of Egypt, defeating the armies of Rome many times. Because she and the Tanukhids had left Aleppo to use the desert as their base, the Romans were left without a standing target upon which to inflict retribution. Mavia's highly mobile units, using classic guerilla warfare tactics, conducted numerous raids and frustrated Roman attempts to subdue the revolt. Mavia and her forces proved themselves to be superior to Roman forces in open battle as well. A century of having fought alongside Roman forces meant that they were familiar with Roman tactics and easily defeated the forces of the Roman governor over Palestine and Phoenicia, the first to be sent in to crush the revolt. She gained favour among townspeople in the region, sympathetic to her cause as well, and it seemed as though the whole Roman East would break away to be ruled by Mavia and her Arabs. A second force, led by the Roman military commander of the East himself, was sent out to meet Mavia's forces in open battle. Personally leading her forces into battle, Mavia proved to be not only an able political leader but also a strong field tactician. Her forces, using a mixture of Roman and native fighting tactics, often employed highly mobile lancers with devastating effect. The Romans were defeated, and unlike in their war against Zenobia, had few native allies to call upon, as one of their most valuable regional ally, the Tanukh, was the very group fighting them. Valens had no choice but to sue for peace. As recorded by church historians Church historians record Mavia's exploits, focusing in particular on the condition she set for the truce she procured from the Romans, which is considered to be important to early Christian evangelical efforts in the Levant. For example, Rufinus writes, > \\"Mavia, queen of the Saracens, had begun to convulse the villages and towns > on the border of Palestine and Arabia with a violent war and to ravage the > neighboring provinces. After she had worn down the Roman army in several > battles, had felled a great many, and had put the remainder to flight, she > was asked to make peace, which she did on the condition already declared: > that a certain monk Moses be ordained bishop for her people.\\" Socrates of Constantinople writes of these same events, and notes that Moses, \\"a Saracen by birth, who led a monastic life in the desert\\" had become \\"exceedingly eminent for his piety, faith and miracles.\\" He suggested that Mavia was \\"therefore desirous that this person should be constituted bishop over her nation, and promised on this condition to terminate the war.\\" Mavia's firm commitment to the truce, as exemplified in her marrying her daughter to Victor, the commander-in-chief of the Roman army, is also noted by Socrates. Sozomen provides even more detail on Mavia, referred to in his text as Mania, describing her rule, and the history of her people, whom he calls \\"Saracens\\". He writes that they are Ishmaelites, descended from the son of Hagar, Abraham's concubine, and that they name their children after Sarah, so as not to be regarded as sons of Hagar, and therefore as slaves. Of battle with \\"Mania, who commanded her own troops in person,\\" Sozomen writes that it was considered \\"arduous\\" and \\"perilous\\", and that the general of the entire cavalry and infantry of the East had to be \\"rescued with difficulty\\" from battle against her and her troops by the general of the troops of Palestine and Phoenicia. =Aftermath= Moses was appointed the first Arab bishop of the Arabs, and an incipient Arab church began to emerge in the Roman East, attracting many Tanukh from Mesopotamia. Mavia also managed to regain the Tanukh's allied status and the privileges they enjoyed prior to Julian's reign. At the war's conclusion, Mavia's daughter, Princess Khasidat, was married to a devout Nicene commander in Rome's army, Victor, to cement the alliance. It was thus that Mavia brought the Arabs a just peace; however, it did not last long. As part of the truce agreement, Mavia sent her forces to Thrace to help the Romans fight the Goths. Her forces proved less effective outside of their native territory and the Goths pushed the Romans back to Constantinople, even killing Valens, the emperor, in the process. Mavia's forces returned home, badly bruised and depleted in number. The new emperor, Theodosius I, favored the Goths, giving them many positions within the Roman establishment, at the expense of the Arabs. After having demonstrated their loyalty to Rome, the Arabs felt increasingly betrayed and mounted another revolt in 383 CE. This revolt was quickly put down and the Tanukh-Roman alliance ended for good, as Rome courted another Arab tribe, the Salih. It is not known whether Mavia commanded this second revolt or not as there is no mention of its leadership. It is known that she died in Anasartha, east of Aleppo in the heart of the Tanukh tribal territory, where there is an inscription recording her death there in 425 CE. Comparisons with Zenobia More recent scholarship has approached Mavia within the context of the history of Arab warrior queens who preceded her, most prominent among them, Zenobia. For example, Irfan Shahid notes that the armies of both queens reached the same waterway dividing Asia from Europe, with Mavia even crossing the Bosporus into Byzantium. Noting the absence of any mention of Mavia in the work of Zosimus, who was familiar with the writings of Sozomen and Socrates, Shahid concludes this omission is deliberate since it did not accord with Zosimus' thesis regarding the destructive effects of the Christianization and barbarization he associated with Constantine I's reforms. Shahid writes that, \\"The contrast between the careers of the two Arab queens - the first belonging to the world of the third century, pagan and disloyal to Rome, the second belonging to the new world of the fourth century, Christian and loyal - would have been attributed only to the success of the Constantinian experiment.\\"Shahid, 1984, pp. 120-121.
