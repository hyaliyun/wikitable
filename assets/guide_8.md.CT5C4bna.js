Purdy's work Memoir, descriptive and explanatory, to accompany the New Chart of the Atlantic Ocean was adapted and improved; continuing to be released in its fifteenth edition fifty years after his death. Life The son of a bookseller at Norwich, Purdy took up the study of naval charts and similar subjects. Before 1812 he succeeded De la Rochette as hydrographer to Messrs. Laurie & Whittle, of 53 Fleet Street, London. Purdy does not seem to have taken part in hydrographic expeditions himself, and his work consisted in writing works and constructing charts based upon the reports of others; but eventually he became a leading authority of his time on hydrography. He was mainly instrumental in bringing Rennell's Current before the notice of navigators, and in 1832 James Rennell's daughter, Lady Rodd, asked Purdy to edit his Wind and Current Charts. Purdy died on 29 January 1843. Works A map of Cabotia. In 1812 Purdy published a Memoir, descriptive and explanatory, to accompany the New Chart of the Atlantic Ocean.

This was facilitated by the performance of shows in Gikuyu, as well as staging drama and musical productions that featured song, dance, and mimes. The center was most famous for its production of Ngaahika Ndeenda (I Will Marry When I Want) co-written by Ng≈©gƒ© wa Thiong'o and Ngugi wa Mirii in collaboration with community members of Kamiriithu and directed by Dr. Kimani Gecau. The production premiered on October 2, 1977, and took place in an open-air theater at Kamiriithu, housing an audience of around 10,000 people. Due to the play's critique of justice for Kenyan people within society and the massive attendance of the production, the Kenyan government banned the center from holding any public gatherings. This made it impossible for the center to continue performing Ngaahika Ndeenda. Ngugi wa Thiong'o was later arrested on December 31, 1977 for being a potential political threat to the Kenyan government at the time. However, even after the government interventions, the Kamiriithu Community Center continued its trajectory by beginning on a production of Maitu Njugira (Mother Sing for Me) which was co- directed by Dr. Kimani Gecau and Waigwa Wachiira and set to premiere at the Kenyan National Theatre on February 19, 1982. The government withdrew the center's license for public performance in November 1977 and banned all theatre activities at the Kamiriithu Community Education and Cultural Centre (and neighboring areas) on March 11, 1982. On March 12, 1982, three truckloads of armed police arrived at the Kamiriithu Community Education and Cultural Centre and razed their open-aired theatre to the ground.

The Purdy Islands, Mole, Mouse, Rat, plus Bat and Alim (or North Bat and South Bat), form part of the Admiralty Islands group, in Manus Province. History The islands are owned by the Mbuke people. They were named after hydrographer John Purdy by his friend Captain Abraham Bristow on 16 February 1817. Bat Island was the site of RAAF radar station 340 RS between March 1944 and April 1944 during the Second World War.url=http://radarreturns.net.au/archive/Radar%20YarnsRRWS.pdf It was one of five such radar stations located within the Admiralty Islands to support the American Invasion. Bat Island proved to be a very dangerous location because it was infested with rats that carried mites which in turn carried Scrub typhus. The majority of the 30 or so strong unit succumbed to Scrub typhus and the station was abandoned after just over a month of service. A contingent of survivors and reinforcements returned in May 1944 to collect the mobile LW-AW radar station and all the equipment that had been left behind. There is one survivor of this radar station still living in Australia as at July 2018. Geography Located in the Bismarck Sea, the Purdys are part of the Admiralty Islands group, which also contains Admiralty Island, Jesus Maria Island, Los Reyes Islands, La Vandola Island, Hayrick Island, Platform Island, Small Round Island, High Island, Low Island, San Miguel Island, Elizabeth Island, Anachoretes Island, Los Monjos Island, Boudeuse Island, L'Echiquier Island, Los Eremitanos Islands, Matty Island, Durour Island, and Tiger Island. The Purdy Island group lies to the southwest of Manus Island and belongs administratively to Manus Province. The Purdy group includes five islands. These are Alim and Bat (or North Bat and South Bat), as well as Mole, Mouse, and Rat. Bat Island is to the west, Mouse and Mole Islands are to the east, Mole Island is to the northwest of Mouse and Mole. About west of Mouse Island can be found Latent Reef. Another reef is southwest of Bat Island. Other formations nearby include the shoals named Sherburne and Sydney, as well as the reefs named Circular and Albert. They consist of coral formations. Fauna and flora The uninhabited islands are a breeding ground for the green sea turtle. The islands are visited by people only to exploit the turtle and coconut palm oil.

It is a notable example of Pueblo Revival style, executed in adobe with richly detailed interiors and hand-made hardware. The house was designed by Edward C. Morgan, an architect from Phoenix who specialized in what he called \\"the Mexican style.\\" The interiors were decorated and embellished by illustrator and sculptor Raymond Phillips Sanderson, who had collaborated with Morgan on previous commissions. Description The ranch is about southeast of Sierra Vista, Arizona, and originally comprised . Its primary structures are the main house, the guest house, and the foreman's house. The main and guest houses have a marked \\"handmade\\" appearance, while the foreman's house is of the same style, but with less attention to detail. Several outbuildings complete the ensemble. Additional structures, not included in the National Register boundaries, included an adobe entrance arch on the driveway, barn, an adobe-walled corral, a four-hole irrigated golf course, and a pump house. An airstrip, located about to the southeast, featured a hangar and another corral. The land is generally level grassland with occasional trees and a view of the Huachuca Mountains. The main house is a rambling, mostly one-story structure with the main public rooms laid out in line, starting at the south end with service areas, the kitchen and the pantry. The dining room adjoins the kitchen, with a projecting round breakfast room on the east side, then an entry room with a fireplace and a living room with a fireplace. An office is located above the entry room, reached by an exterior stairway. A bedroom wing is appended to the north side of the living room, extending to the east with a guest bedroom and master bedroom and attendant bathrooms and closets, both with rounded projecting bays. The guest house features a \\"kiva room,\\" circular in shape and resembling a Native American kiva, then an entry, a living room, a small kitchen and a bedroom and bath. The foreman's house is roughly square in arrangement, with living room, dining room, kitchen and three bedrooms, and porches on three sides. Exterior walls are rounded adobe with irregular parapets and projecting vigas. Sanderson's artwork features motifs borrowed from Native American themes, with the strongest resemblance to Navajo art. Sanderson executed painted wall decorations, carved doors, tiles, light fixtures and door and cabinet hardware. The adapted style has been described as \\"pueblo Deco.\\" History Rufus Riddlesbarger was a former airmail pilot who invented a contraceptive diaphragm device in the 1930s. His company, Lanteen Laboratories, was a success and Riddlesbarger acquired the land for his ranch in 1937 with some of the proceeds. Riddlesbarger had intended to make the Lanteen Ranch his primary home, but sold the property in 1947 to Margaret W. Herschede of Cincinnati, Ohio. Riddlesbarger moved to Tucson, where he ran into trouble in 1948 over a relationship with an underage house servant, eventually leaving the United States. Herschede and her husband used the ranch as a working cattle ranch and lived on the site. The ranch was sold in 1972, following the deaths of the Herschedes, for subdivision and development. Some lots were sold, but the houses were eventually sold without land to another company in 1985. In 1990 Evans and Olga Guidroz bought the buildings and of land and resumed ranching. The ranch is presently known as Kinjockity Ranch. Kinjockity Ranch was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 19, 1996.

The album was recorded throughout December 2012 at Studio La Vache in Toulouse, Southern France and was released on vinyl/digital download on Monday 10 June 2013 on the French independent record label Boudoir Moderne. The record represents the band's first release since 2009 and the first ever Neils Children album to be released on vinyl.  Background  After a three-year hiatus, founder Neils Children members John Linger and Brandon Jacobs played shows with original bassist James Hair, focusing on material from their 2003‚Äì2005 period. The shows put the band in touch with French promoter and label owner Damien Louchet, who proposed the group recording an album for his label Boudoir Moderne. Once the decision was made to record a new album Linger completed demos for various songs that feature on the album, and once the material was chosen the sessions for the album were booked. Without Hair on board (who decided against further band work in favour of building up his homemade food business) Linger and Jacobs decamped to Toulouse, France to record an album's worth of new material as a two piece, sharing the instrumental duties of drums, bass, guitar, percussion and keyboards between them.  Musical style  The material differs from the band's previous work and focuses on much more melodic instrumental parts, performed on vintage synthesizers and keyboard sounds such as Roland Juno, harpsichord, mellotron and hammond organ whilst sidelining the importance and prominence of guitar. The song 'The Beat of the Boulevard' also features the unique sounds of the autoharp based iPhone app AutoArp. The album incorporates elements of psychedelia, library music recordings, jazz and krautrock. Bands such as Stereolab, Broadcast and Silver Apples have been noted as being an influence on the album, which can be heard in the drum patterns, keyboard lines and vocal melodies, as well as in the production of the songs which feature strong use of spring reverb, valve amplifiers and tape delay. The short, hauntology-esque vignettes between various songs also bear resemblance to releases from the Ghost Box record label, such as those by The Focus Group and Belbury Poly. Studio La Vache, the studio at which the album was recorded in rural Toulouse, uses a mixing desk once belonging to the famous cabaret venue Moulin Rogue.

After recording  After the recordings were completed, the pair recruited former Strange Idols guitarist David Smith and French musician Syd Kemp (on keyboards and bass respectively) to form the nucleus of the current live band which have played exclusive one-off shows in support of the album. The first of these was an intimate sold-out show at London's Power Lunches venue where the full album was played in sequence. Since the primary Dimly Lit shows the band have pared down the number of songs in the live set, but the set still consists only of material from the album. They played Bad Vibrations' all-dayer at The Shacklewell Arms with Novella, YoungHusband and The Tambourines. On Monday 10 June 2013, the release date of Dimly Lit, they returned to the same East London venue with support from YoungHusband and Lost Harbours. It was announced that in July 2013 the group would play as part of the East End Live festival line-up featuring Toy, The Monochrome Set and Pere Ubu among others. The video for the lead single \\"Trust You\\" was featured on The Pirate Bay's \\"The Promo Bay\\" home page and received over 60,000 views.  Critical reception  The album has received widespread critical acclaim from various important music publications such as Q Magazine, Loud and Quiet, Louder Than War, Artrocker and Shindig! Magazine. Q Magazine gave the album 4/5 in their August 2013 issue claiming the album as being \\"unexpectedly brilliant\\". Drowned in Sound gave the album 9 out of 10 and declared it 'One of this years finest albums'.

Digital magazine Artrocker awarded the album 4/5, stating that the album exhibits \\"... a maturity and coming of age ... a contemporary record which would fit snugly alongside Tame Impala\\". Shindig! Magazine gave the album a favourable review in their April 2013 edition, with writer Neil Hussey noting the eclectic blend of sounds featured; \\"Neils Children are musical magpies ... mixing and matching with verve and intelligence.

Life Carswell was born at Paisley, Scotland, on 3 February 1793, and studied medicine at the University of Glasgow. While a student he employed by Dr. John Thompson of Edinburgh to make a collection of drawings illustrating morbid anatomy. He travelled to the continent, and spent two years (1822‚Äì3) working at the hospitals of Paris and Lyon, while working on this collection. He returned to Scotland, and took his degree of M.D. at Marischal College, Aberdeen, in 1826. After this he went again to Paris, and resumed his studies in morbid anatomy under Pierre Charles Alexandre Louis. Around 1828 Carswell was chosen by University College, London as professor of pathological anatomy; but before entering on his teaching duties was commissioned to prepare a collection of pathological drawings. He therefore remained in Paris after receiving this commission till 1831, when he had completed a series of two thousand water-colour drawings of diseased structures. He then took the duties of his professorship. At the same time, or soon afterwards, he became physician to the University College Hospital. About 1836 Carswell took up private medical practice, but did not meet with great success. In poor health, he in 1840 resigned his professorship, and was appointed physician to the Leopold I of Belgium and his royal family. He lived at Laeken, near Brussels, making several journeys to the south in search of health. Carswell made no further contributions to medical science. He was knighted in July 1850 by Queen Victoria for his services to Louis-Philippe I when an exile in the United Kingdom. He died on 15 June 1857, of chronic lung disease. He married Marguerite Chardenot, who survived him, but left no issue. Works One of the illustrations from Illustrations of the Elementary Forms of Disease Carswell's major work, published in 1837, was Illustrations of the Elementary Forms of Disease, with coloured plates. He wrote also journal articles, and in the Cyclop√¶dia of Practical Medicine the articles \\"Induration\\", \\"Melanosis\\", \\"Mortification\\", \\"Perforation\\", \\"Scirrhus\\", \\"Softening\\", and \\"Tubercle\\".

Losing his vision suddenly at 17, he left the sport of football for athletics. He first raced competitively in 1998 Vigo half marathon. He went on to compete at IPC European and World Championships. He also competed at the 2000, 2008, 2012 and 2016 Summer Paralympics, but did not medal in any of these Games.  Personal  Nieves was born on March 9, 1982Some sources, including Romano (2012) and La Voz de Galicia (June 13, 2009), indicate that he was born in 1984. in Vilalba, Lugo. Shortly after his birth, his parents emigrated to Germany. His father remained in Germany and was still there as of 2009, but Gustavo Nieves returned to Spain when he was five years old. Nieves has a disability: he has partial vision. He lost his vision when he was 17 years old. The onset of vision loss was sudden and unexpected, and there is no clear reason why or if his vision will continue to deteriorate. Prior to that, he played football as a midfielder for S√°rdoma in Spain's Divisi√≥n de Honor Juvenil de F√∫tbol, and had tried out for Celta de Vigo. He quit the sport following the vision loss. In the period between 2004 and 2012, Nieves was a student training to be a mining engineer at the University of Vigo. His initial preference was to study biology but his vision issues meant he could not use a microscope, so he made the academic program switch. He has a functional proficiency in English, and is able to argue with people in the language at athletic events.  Athletics  Nieves is a T12/B2 track and field athlete, who took up athletics at the age of 17 following sudden onset vision loss. With no one in his family having participated in the sport, he initially started the sport casually by running at a park in Castrelos Vigo. His first competitive race was the 1998 Vigo half marathon. He was a member of the Celta Vigo athletics club, then joined the Gymnastic Society of Pontevedra athletic club. before leaving the club to join the Alejandro Gomez Athletics Club. Nieves competed in the 2000 Summer Paralympics in Sydney, Australia where he finished sixth in the 10,000 meter race. He focused on his educational work in 2004 and did not compete 2004 Summer Paralympics. He was trying to get the credentials that would enable him to get a job as athletics did not provide enough money for him to live off the sport. Following the 2004 Games, more money was made available to Paralympic athletes and he was able to dedicate more time to the sport. Competing at the 2008 Spanish national championships, Nieves finished first in the 10,000 meter T12 race. He competed at the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing, China. Following the 2008 Games, he switched coaches to Pablo Diaz and joined Gymnastic Society of Pontevedra athletic club. He based his 2009 training in Pontevedra and Lugo, where he continued to be coached by Pablo Diaz. During the season, he had a goal of trying to prepare for qualifying for the 2012 Summer Paralympics. He competed in the 2009 Spanish national athletics championships. At the 2009 IPC European Athletics Championships, he won two gold medals and one silver medal while setting a world record in the 10,000 meters. His second gold was in the 5,000 meters and the silver was in the 1,500 meters. In 2009, he set a world record in the T12 10,000 meter event during a race in Galicia. In 2010, Nieves set a world record in the T12 10,000 meter race and then bettered his own world record 40 days later at a race in Jerez de la Frontera. He competed in the 2011 Pontevedra half marathon. In 2011, he injured the third metatarsal of the left foot as a result of athletics. His physical therapy following the injury involved training in the pool. He started competing again after the injury- imposed break in late September 2011 at a race in Berlin. In 2012, he was a recipient of a Plan ADO ‚Ç¨2,500 coaching scholarship. In March 2012, Nieves was training up to four hours a day at the Galician Sports Modernization Center (CGTD). Prior to the start of the London Games, he trained with several other visually impaired Spanish track and field athletes in Logro√±o. He finished first in the 2012 San Silvestre Candelaria 4,500 meter race. He competed at the 2012 Spanish national Paralympic athletic championships where he came in first in the 5,000 meters. A few months prior to the London Paralympics, he had problems with his tendons. He opted to not compete in the 2012 European Championships as a result. The city of Pontevedra held a sending off ceremony prior to the start of the Games where Nieves was honoured. He raced at the 2012 Summer Paralympics, finishing fourth in the 5,000 meters. His time was 4 seconds slower than his personal best. Nieves competed in the 2013 San Silvestre Candelaria 4,500 meter race. In May 2013, he was attempting to qualify at the Kern Sauleda Pharme-Grand Prix for the IPC Athletics World Championships in Lyon, France in the 5,000 meter race. Later that month, he attempted to qualify for the World Championships in the 10,000 meter race at a race in Huesca.

Their main focus is to support vulnerable adults to live independently. This is done by assisting their integration into a community as well as teaching them skills (i.e. financing, being healthy, staying safe, etc.) that promote self-support. KeyRing focus on connection, flexible support and skill-builidng. KeyRing is now supporting over 1200 people in 85 Networks across the UK. KeyRing also provides a range of specialist support services which are adapted to the needs of the local population. One example of this is the Ancora project in Oldham which supports people through crisis.  Vision and Mission  Vision - A welcoming world with communities that celebrate the skills and talents of everybody. Mission ‚Äì KeyRing connects people and inspires them to build the life they want.  History  In 1990 Carl Poll asked people with a learning disability what they wanted from life. At the time many people were being told that they couldn‚Äôt possibly do this or that. And they certainly couldn‚Äôt live on their own. When Carl asked these people what they wanted from life, they overwhelmingly said that they wanted their own front door. They wanted support when they wanted it and the option to say no when they did not. ‚ÄòSounds reasonable‚Äô thought Carl so with some equally forward thinking people in Wandsworth, London, he set up the very first KeyRing Network. In 1996 KeyRing became a registered Charity and Company Ltd by Guarantee. KeyRing grew rapidly and now has Networks all over England and Wales. We started by providing support to people with learning disabilities. Then in 2006 we decided that everyone deserved access to KeyRing support. Today, around two thirds of the people we support have a learning disability and we also work with people who have mental health issues, people who experience homelessness, older people, people with addictions and other people. We‚Äôre not keen on labels but we know that they help people decide whether we are right for them, so we work with them. The people and the labels. We continue to change people‚Äôs lives and challenge what people can do, as well as what others think they can do. KeyRing's current Chief Executive is Karyn Kirkpatrick. Karyn is passionate about people having their own homes lives and voices in their local community. Having started her career as a Learning Disability Nurse, Karyn moved to work with Advocacy and advice organisations. From there, she joined KeyRing where people were getting the type of support and connection that Karyn felt they needed.  Structure  A KeyRing Living Support Network helps people develop their independent living skills. People who live in a network are called Members. Members choose who they live with. Many Members choose to live on their own. Each network has about 9 Members. There is local KeyRing support from volunteers, Members, the community and paid staff teams. KeyRing can support Members to get housing in the network area through the supportive housing or support them in their current property. Most Members are within walking distance of each other. \\"The support varies: it can mean helping Members with letters and bills or meeting them for tea... They encourage Members to help each other and involve themselves in the community, and enable quick access to specialist help.\\"(Harris, Carol) The organisation is a charity and is governed by a board of trustees.  Achievements  KeyRing has won awards for their involvement in projects for vulnerable adults across England. These projects are intended to benefit KeyRing Members and their local communities as well as spreading awareness of the organisation and demonstrating that vulnerable adults are capable of living with a degree of independence. These projects include: = Awareness Training for Prison Officers and Staff = KeyRing together with the Skillnet Group were commissioned by the Valuing People Support Team; part of the Department of Health‚Äôs Care Service Improvement Partnership, to jointly develop and deliver a training package for Prison Officers and staff in Young Offenders Institutions to raise awareness of the needs and issues of prisoners with Learning Disabilities. = In Control = KeyRing was involved in ‚ÄòIn Control‚Äô pilots in Oldham. As a result of the pilot, KeyRing opened 13 new Networks in Oldham. KeyRing developed a Personal Budget contract in collaboration with Oldham MBC supporting the Members' understanding of the process. = Investors in People = KeyRing achieved the Award of Investors in People in 2008. In 2011 KeyRing was given the IiP Silver Award. = Investors in Diversity = KeyRing achieved the Investors in Diversity Award in January 2010. = Think Local Act Personal = KeyRing is amongst a range of community centred providers who feature in the directory of innovations. https://www.thinklocalactpersonal.org.uk/innovations-in-community-centred- support/  References   External links  * KeyRing: Living Support Website * KeyRing on Facebook Category:Charities for disabled people based in the United Kingdom ","title":"KeyRing"},{"id":"39839062","text":"This is a list of unicorns in modern popular culture, chiefly literature, film and television, arranged chronologically: * 1871: Through the Looking-Glass by Lewis Carroll, features the nursery rhyme characters of \\"The Lion and the Unicorn.\\" *1940 (November 13): Fantasia depicts unicorns and a unicorn donkey in the Pastoral Symphony segment of the film. * 1940: Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe, unicorns are seen being ridden by Princess Aura and Lady Sonja in the sixth chapter, ‚ÄúFlaming Death.‚Äù * 1956 (March 15) Forbidden Planet makes reference to a virgin's ability to tame unicorns. * 1956 (September 4) The Last Battle, by C.

He served as the Premier of the Free State, one of South Africa's nine provinces, from 2009 until 2018. Magashule has been the subject of many journalistic investigations alleging his involvement in corrupt activities. Early life Magashule attended Tumahole Primary School (now Lembede Primary) in Parys and Phehellang Secondary School. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree from Fort Hare University After graduating, he taught at Moqhaka High School in Sebokeng, and later at Phehellang High School in Tumahole. Anti-apartheid activism From a young age, Ace Magashule showed a deep concern for the plight of his people, and for the suÔ¨Äering that they endured under the repressive and racist apartheid regime. While at the University of Fort Hare, in 1982, he was arrested following a protest against a visit by Ciskei Prime Minister Lennox Sebe, and convicted of public violence. His official ANC biography claims that he was charged with high treason. Magashule was a member of Tumahole Youth Congress in the 1980s and played a role in United Democratic Front in Northern Free State in the 1980s and participated in organising rent boycotts in Tumahole. He was detained for his role in UDF activities in 1985. He went to exile in 1989 and returned in 1991 after unbanning of ANC/SACP and PAC. Political career * Elected Chairperson of ANC‚Äôs Northern Free State Region in 1991. * Elected Deputy-Chairperson of ANC in the Free State in 1994. * Served as MEC of Economic Affairs between 1994 and 1996 * Served as MEC of Transport. * Deployed to National Assembly, August 1997. * Provincial Chairperson of the African National Congress (ANC) in the Free State, 1998. * Re-elected as Chairperson of ANC PEC in Free State in 2002. * Served as MEC of Agriculture between 2004 and 2005 * Re-elected as Chairperson of ANC PEC in Free State in 2005. * Elected to ANC National Executive Committee during the 52nd ANC National Conference in 2007 at Polokwane. * Re-elected as Chairperson of ANC PEC in Free State in 2008 * Served as MEC of Sports, Arts and Recreation between 2007 and 2008. * Served as MEC of Safety and Security in 2008. Magashule was appointed as Premier of the Free State on 6 May 2009, replacing Beatrice Marshoff. As Premier, he initiated Operation Hlasela, a campaign to fight poverty in the Free State, and established a bursary fund for tertiary students in the Premier's office. He was elected Secretary General of the African National Congress in December 2017 during the party's elective conference. Corruption allegations Magashule has been the subject of many journalistic investigations alleging his corrupt activities. In 2011 Magashule and Mohloua Seoe were linked to a government property deal that was awarded to a company of which both were once co-directors. In November 2017 the winner of a tender from the provincial government Magashule headed alleged that Magashule had personally encouraged him to act as a front for the contract. In January 2018, the Hawks unit of South Africa's Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation raided Magashule's offices in connection with the Vrede Dairy Project, calling it a \\"scheme designed to defraud and steal monies\\" from the Free State Department of Agriculture. =Children= One of his sons, Tshepiso \\"Gift\\" Magashule, was employed as a consultant by the Gupta family since November 2010, shortly after Duduzane Zuma was brought under their influence. In 2011 Gift joined the Gupta brothers on a three-week holiday to New York and Venice, and he was later appointed as a director in a Gupta company, earning R90,000 a month. Ace Magashule alleged that Gift's link to the Guptas was no secret. In 2015 the Guptas treated Gift and his brother Thato to an eight-day stay in the Oberoi Hotel, Dubai. In 2015 a busy Shell fuel station in Phuthaditjhaba, owned by the Free State Development Corporation (FDC), was acquired by Ace's 27-year old daughter Thoko Alice Malembe. As the deal involved an R11.5 million upfront rental fee from Shell, and a purchase price of R2.9 million, reportedly below its market value, it resulted in a windfall of some R8.9 million for Malembe's MMAT trust. Magashule denied any involvement, despite a security video of 18 December 2014 which confirmed his exploratory visit to the fuel station, in the company of two FDC board members, and apparently, Malembe. The fuel station's 60 employees had to be entrenched by their former employer, when it lost its case against the FDC. After she was reunited with her father in 2011, Malembe registered Botlokwa Holdings in 2013, which managed to secure a series of government tenders and property deals from the Free State provincial government. Malembe's trust or company also acquired a Botshabelo fuel station from the FDC for R2.88 million (or R4 million according to the FDC), despite an offer of R5.5 million from another investor. =Associates= Ace Magashule is a long-time friend of Hantsi Matseke, chairperson of the FDC. Matseke owns Maono Construction which has been awarded contracts worth R515 million by government departments and municipalities in the Free State. Magashule has denied influencing any of these. Maono Construction has however subcontracted work to Malembe's Botlokwa Holdings. Racism In 2019, Ace Magashule urged voters not to \\"waste your vote on the white man\\" by supporting the opposition Democratic Alliance. His remarks were condemned as racist by ANC veterans.

Bikowsky's identity is not publicly acknowledged by the Agency but was deduced by independent investigative journalists in 2011. In January 2014, the Washington Post named her and tied her to a pre-9/11 intelligence failure and the extraordinary rendition of Khalid El-Masri. The Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture, released in December 2014, showed that Bikowsky was not only a key part of the torture program but also one of its chief apologists, resulting in the media's giving her the moniker \\"The Unidentified Queen of Torture.\\" Bikowsky married her former boss Michael Scheuer in December 2014.  CIA career  Bikowsky started her CIA career in the 1990s as a Soviet analyst. She was brought into the Bin Laden Issue Station when it was created in 1996 by its first Chief, Michael Scheuer. Sometime after the USS Cole bombing in October 2000, she was promoted to Deputy Chief of the Bin Laden Issue Station. By March 2003, she had been appointed Chief of the station. The station was closed in late 2005. Ken Silverstein reported that Bikowsky was a top candidate to be CIA Deputy Chief of Station in Baghdad in 2007. However, a CIA spokesman later wrote to Silverstein to say Bikowsky was not considered for the position and to dispute the characterization of her in the post. In 2008, Jane Mayer reported that Bikowsky held \\"a top post handling sensitive matters in the Middle East.\\" It was reported in 2011 that Bikowsky had been promoted to the head of the CIA's Global Jihad unit. She was characterized as a \\"top CIA official,\\" equivalent to a general in the military. According to the Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture, Bikowsky was at the center of the CIA's effort to justify its use of \\"enhanced interrogation\\" techniques. She testified to the Senate Intelligence Committee in February 2007 that enhanced interrogation saved at least hundreds of American lives. The report listed three other claims Bikowsky made in that hearing, calling them all inaccurate. Bikowsky's pseudonym was redacted at least three dozen times in the report. = Blocking intelligence sharing before September 11, 2001 = Bikowsky was a senior staff member at the Bin Laden Issue Station in January 2000. She was the direct supervisor of Michael Anne Casey, a CIA staff operations officer who was assigned to track future 9/11 hijacker Khalid al-Mihdhar at an al-Qaeda operatives' meeting in Malaysia in early January 2000. Casey blocked a draft cable written by Doug Miller, an FBI agent detailed to the Bin Laden Issue Station, to the FBI warning that al-Mihdhar had a multiple-entry visa for travel to the U.S. Michael Anne Casey is \\"Michelle,\\" Doug Miller is \\"Dwight,\\" and Mark Rossini is \\"Malcolm.\\" Mark Rossini, another FBI agent first assigned to the Bin Laden Issue Station in 1999, testified that Casey also verbally ordered him to not share information with FBI headquarters about al-Mihdhar or Nawaf al-Hazmi, who was traveling with al-Mihdhar. Rossini further stated that Bikowsky told congressional investigators in 2002 that she hand-delivered al- Mihdhar's visa information to FBI headquarters. This was later proven false by FBI log books. The CIA shared some details about al-Mihdhar with the FBI at that time, but not that he had a valid visa to enter the U.S. = Rendition of Maher Arar = Former CIA officer John Kiriakou was interviewed about the arrest and extraordinary rendition of Canadian citizen Maher Arar, which occurred in September 2002 at John F. Kennedy International Airport. Kiriakou said a \\"senior female CIA counter-terrorism officer\\" (presumably Bikowsky) ordered the rendition over the objections of her subordinates. Arar was sent to Syria, where he was tortured and held for almost one year. In reference to the episode, he referred to the film Zero Dark Thirty. = Interrogation of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed = Bikowsky has been identified as \\"the redheaded former Soviet analyst who had been in the Bin Laden Unit during Michael Scheuer's supervision\\" in Jane Mayer's book, The Dark Side. After Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was captured in March 2003, Mayer writes of Bikowsky: > Despite the CIA's insistence on the professionalism of its interrogation > program, according to two well-informed Agency sources, one particularly > overzealous female officer had to be reprimanded for her role. After > Mohammed was captured, the woman, who headed the Al Qaeda unit in the CTC, > was so excited she flew at government expense to the black site where > Mohammed was held so that she could personally watch him being waterboarded. > ... Coworkers said she had no legitimate reason to be present during > Mohammed's interrogation. She was not an interrogator. \\"She thought it would > be cool to be in the room,\\" a former colleague said. (p. 273) The Senate torture report claims Bikowsky participated in the interrogation and that claims she made about the results were \\"almost entirely inaccurate.\\" = Rendition of Khalid El-Masri = In late January 2004, Bikowsky, as head of the Bin Laden Issue Station, made the decision to extraordinarily render Khalid El-Masri to Afghanistan for four months without any evidence in hand. El-Masri's name was a different transliteration of Khalid al-Masri, the name of a person who had supposedly met Ramzi bin al-Shibh and Marwan al-Shehhi on a train in Germany. Even after El-Masri's passport was checked and his identity as a different person was confirmed in March, Bikowsky still wanted him held in detention in Afghanistan. El-Masri was eventually released in late May on a country road in Albania. The CIA Inspector General determined that there was no legal justification for rendering El-Masri. Bikowsky received no reprimand for the incident, because then-CIA Director Michael Hayden said he didn't want to deter the initiative of counter-terrorism employees. In 2015, the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights, a German non-profit human rights organization, filed a criminal complaint in Germany asking for a federal criminal investigation of Bikowsky for the rendition and torture of El-Masri. Germany's Code of Crimes against International Law does not require the accused to be in Germany or the crime to have been committed there. The complaint cited the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee report on torture as proof of Bikowsky's involvement. Who is Rich Blee? In 2011, independent journalists Ray Nowosielski and John Duffy planned to release an audio documentary entitled Who is Rich Blee? The documentary focused on the CIA's Bin Laden Issue Station before 9/11 and how certain CIA officials blocked information on future 9/11 hijackers from reaching the FBI. They planned to be the first to reveal the identity of two CIA agents, including Bikowsky, who had previously only been identified as \\"Frances\\" in an AP news story from 2011 or as a red-headed CIA agent in Jane Mayer's The Dark Side. However, after receiving threats of prosecution from the CIA under the Intelligence Identities Protection Act, Duffy and Nowosielski decided to release the documentary with the names redacted. They claim that their webmaster later posted an email containing the identities by accident. The identities then spread to the wider Internet.  Representations  Bikowsky's career and personality were the main models for the character Maya (portrayed by actress Jessica Chastain) in the film Zero Dark Thirty (2012), although Maya is a composite character of several women involved in finding Osama Bin Laden. The film aroused controversy for its depiction of the use of torture to elicit information from terrorist suspects. She is also a basis for the character Diane Marsh (portrayed by Wrenn Schmidt) in the Hulu miniseries The Looming Tower (2018). In the dramatization, she is depicted as being one of the two people primarily responsible for the lack of intelligence sharing between the FBI and CIA in the lead up to 9/11. In The Report, a film adaptation of the Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture, a character played by Maura Tierney appears to be based on Bikowsky.

Life Dienes was born in Torja, Kingdom of Hungary (present-day Turia, Romania), on December 18, 1913, and left home at 15 after the suicide of his mother. Dienes travelled across Europe mostly on foot, until his arrival in Tunisia. In Tunisia he purchased his first camera, a 35mm Retina. Returning to Europe he arrived in Paris in 1933 to study art, and bought a Rolleiflex shortly after. Dienes began work as a professional photographer for the Communist newspaper L'Humanit√©, and was employed by the Associated Press until 1936, when the Parisian couturier Captain Molyneux noted his work and urged him to become a fashion photographer. In 1938 the editor of Esquire, Arnold Gingrich offered him work in New York City, and helped fund Dienes' passage to the United States. Once in the United States Dienes worked for Vogue and Life magazines as well as Esquire. When not working as a fashion photographer Dienes travelled the USA photographing Native American culture, including the Apache, Hopi, and Navajo reservations and their inhabitants. Dissatisfied with his life as a fashion photographer in New York, Dienes moved to California in 1944, where he began to specialise in nudes and landscapes. As well as Monroe, Dienes also photographed such notable actors as Elizabeth Taylor, Marlon Brando, Henry Fonda, Shirley Temple, Ingrid Bergman, Ronald Reagan, Jane Russell, Anita Ekberg and Fred Astaire. De Dienes married twice, and died of cancer on April 11, 1985, in Hollywood. =Marilyn Monroe= In 1945 Dienes met the nineteen-year-old Marilyn Monroe, then called Norma Jeane Baker, who was a model on the books of Emmeline Snively‚Äôs Blue Book Model Agency. Snively told Dienes of Norma Jeane, and suggested her for his project of photographing artistic nudes. In his memoirs Dienes described the first time he met Monroe saying \\"...it was as if a miracle had happened to me. Norma Jeane seemed to be like an angel. I could hardly believe it for a few moments. An earthly, sexy-looking angel! Sent expressly for me!\\". His series of pin-up shots of her at Long Island's Tobay Beach, in Oyster Bay, New York became notable.Churchwell  p. 36. Retrieved July 28, 2012. \\"De Dienes took many of the Monroe's most famous early photographs as 'Norma Jeane,\\"' including those of her climbing a hillside in khakis and green sweater, and sitting on the highway, as well as the shots on Tobay Beach in August 1949. ... Those pictures of Marilyn in a bathing suit recall the art picture, but they also subvert the pinup, in being far more active, playful, even romping, than the usually static pinup girl.\\" Norma Jeane had recently separated from her husband, James Dougherty and told Dienes of her wish to become an actress. Dienes suggested that they go on a road trip to photograph her in the natural landscapes, for which Dienes paid her a flat fee of $200. Dienes had earlier been present at the first meeting of Monroe and her mother in six years, and had presumptuously announced to her mother that he and Monroe were to be married. His photographs of Monroe from this trip sold widely and he made far more money from the images, and did not offer Monroe a percentage of the sales, or paid her on the profits. Dienes next met her on Labor Day in 1946, with her new name of Marilyn Monroe, they next worked together in 1952, where he shot her at the Bel Air Hotel and 1953, where she telephoned him at 2am, and took him to a darkened street where he used his car headlights to illuminate her, taking pictures her wide-eyed and unmade up. Dienes last saw her alive in June 1961. Of their last meeting he said that \\"...her success was a sham, her hopes thwarted...the next day she left a bouquet outside my door: a selection of her latest photos. Smiling, radiant - utterly misleading; I little guessed that this was our last goodbye\\". = Legacy = In recent years, Dienes' photography has received overdue critical attention from a variety of sources. In 2002, Taschen published an 848-page two-volume monograph titled Marilyn, noting \\"his original, inspired style\\" and how Dienes \\"soon built up a huge portfolio of stunning photographs of the smiling brunette which helped to launch her model career and, a few years later, a film career that was to make her a legend.\\" An exhibition, entitled \\"Andr√© de Dienes: Marilyn and California Girls,\\" opened June 9, 2016 at the Steven Kasher Gallery in New York City, representing the first solo show of Dienes' photography in New York in over ten years.

It was issued in conjunction with the Year of Faith proclaimed by Pope Benedict XVI to be observed from October 2012 to November 2013. It was the first encyclical in the history of the Catholic Church written by two popes, being begun by Pope Benedict XVI and finished by Pope Francis.Hahn, Scott. Evangelizing Catholics: A Mission Manual for the New Evangelization (p. 17). Our Sunday Visitor. Kindle Edition. Subject According to Francis X. Rocca, \\"Pope Francis' first encyclical, 'Lumen Fidei' (‚ÄúThe Light of Faith‚Äù), is a celebration of Christian faith as the guiding light of a 'successful and fruitful life', inspiring social action as well as devotion to God, and illuminating 'every aspect of human existence', including philosophy and the natural sciences.\\"Rocca, Francis X., \\"Lumen Fidei: an overview of Pope Francis‚Äôs first encyclical\\", Catholic Herald, July 5, 2013 The encyclical focuses on faith and completes what his predecessor Pope Benedict XVI had previously written about charity and hope, the other two theological virtues, in his encyclicals Deus caritas est and Spe Salvi. Francis worked from a first draft completed by Benedict before his resignation and makes the authorship clear: \\"These considerations on faith ‚Äî in continuity with all that the Church's magisterium has pronounced on this theological virtue ‚Äî are meant to supplement what Benedict XVI had written in his encyclical letters on charity and hope. He himself had almost completed a first draft of an encyclical on faith. For this I am deeply grateful to him, and as his brother in Christ I have taken up his fine work and added a few contributions of my own.\\" It is divided into four chapters, with an introduction and a conclusion. The encyclical traces the history of the faith of the Church (from the call of God to Abraham and the people of Israel, to the resurrection of Jesus), discusses the relationship between reason and faith, the Church's role in the transmission of the faith, and the role faith plays in the building of societies in search of the common good. The text concludes with a prayer to the Virgin Mary, who is presented as a model of faith. Content The metaphor of life as a journey has been used by Pope Francis before, notably in his address to the bishops of Brazil in July 2013. In Lumen fidei, he observes that faith was formerly viewed as a light that dispels the darkness and illuminates the way, but later came to be \\"understood either as a leap in the dark, to be taken in the absence of light, driven by blind emotion, or as a subjective light, capable perhaps of warming the heart and bringing personal consolation, but not something which could be proposed to others as an objective and shared light which points the way.\\"Pope Francis. Lumen fidei, ¬ß3, June 29, 2013, Libreria Editrice Vaticana Part of the purpose of the encyclical is to restore the light of faith to an understanding of its place in the common journey of mankind.

In 1914 he was the subject of the second successful recall attempt in California history, in which he was replaced by Ed Wolfe. Grant's recall was sparked by his cosponsorship of the Red Light Abatement Act, legislation purportedly aimed at curbing prostitution, a stance at odds with constituents in a San Francisco red-light district he represented. Wolfe, who had previously run against Grant in 1912 and lost by just 95 votes, was elected with 53 percent voting for recall. Grant lost by a margin of three-to-one in San Francisco's vice and financial districts.

History The first Miix was announced in June 2009. Lenovo said it would be released sometime during the summer of the same year. Lenovo said the device would be priced at approximately US$500. In October 2009, Lenovo launched an additional Miix tablet by the name Miix 2, which is an 8-inch Windows 8.1 tablet. The Miix 2 is powered by a 1.8 GHz Intel Atom processor. Lenovo stopped selling this tablet in July 2014 in the United States, citing \\"a low demand\\".  Miix 3  The Lenovo Miix 3-830 was launched in September 2014, with a 7.85-inch screen, 1024x768 pixel display, Windows 8.1, and an Intel Atom Z3735F processor. Lenovo Miix 3-1030 then followed in October 2014, with a 10.1-inch screen, 1920x1200 pixel display, Windows 8.1, and an Intel Atom Z3745 processor.  Miix 310 and 320  During Mobile World Congress 2016 Lenovo presented the Miix Ideapad 310 superseded by Lenovo Miix Ideapad 320 in 2017. Design and performance The Miix 10 has a 10.1-inch touchscreen with a resolution of 1,366 x 768 that supports five touch points. It is powered by a dual-core \\"Clover Trail\\" Atom processor from Intel, comes with 64GB of eMMC solid state memory that can be supplemented with up 32GB more storage using a microSD card, 2 GB of LP-DDR2 RAM, and runs Microsoft Windows 8. Bluetooth 4.0 and Wi- Fi networking come standard. 3G cellular data and GPS are optional. The Miix gets its multi-mode functionality from its \\"quick-flip\\" detachable folio keyboard that allows it to quickly switch from PC mode to tablet mode. The device weights only 1.2 pounds and has a battery Lenovo claims will last 10 hours. The battery has 6800 mAh capacity and uses Li-Pol technology. The Miix has a 1 megapixel front-facing camera for chat and stereo speakers. Reviews In a review for PC Pro, Barry Collins wrote, \\"So what to make of the Miix 10? It has several advantages over the Surface Pro, not least when it comes to paying off the credit card bill at the end of the month. The absence of a trackpad or stylus is a major oversight, and renders the Windows desktop near inoperable without outside assistance from a Bluetooth mouse, which adds to the weight and cost. Yet we remain enamoured with Lenovo's Miix 10. It‚Äôs a capable performer for work, and for sitting back on the sofa and keeping an eye on Twitter feeds, and it's light enough for both purposes. It falls short of an award, but by a margin slimmer than its slender frame.\\" References Miix ","title":"Lenovo Miix"},{"id":"39839531","text":"Anopina eleonora is a moth of the family Tortricidae.

It operated as a vaudeville theater and movie house before being torn down in 2013. History Signora Antonietta Pisanelli opened the theater in 1907 or 1909 as the Washington Square Theater, a vaudeville or Italian theater. It was built on the site of the first Holy Trinity Orthodox Cathedral, which was completed in 1888 but destroyed in the San Francisco earthquake and fire of 1906. The theater could seat 1,000 patrons for dramas and opera. In 1909, the theater hosted a benefit concert for Emilio Rivola. When \\"Sunny Jim\\" Rolph ran for mayor of San Francisco, several rallies were held for Rolph at the Washington Square Theater in 1911. It was converted into a movie theater in 1928, and changed its name several times over its history, being called the Milano Theater (at the end of the 1920s) and the Palace Theater (in 1938 or 1939) before finally becoming the Pagoda Palace in 1967. As the Pagoda Palace, it specialized in Chinese-language films and hosted The Cockettes, a midnight drag revue, from 1969 to 1971. In 1986, the theater began showing films on a repertory basis as The Palace (dropping \\"Pagoda\\") after the Renaissance Rialto chain assumed operations. The theater discontinued operations and the building was vacant starting in 1994; various conversion plans, including a Rite Aid drugstore, fell through after opposition from local government and neighborhood groups. Rite Aid had initially planned to convert the building into a 24-hour pharmacy; after that proposal was withdrawn, civic leaders floated the idea of a combined cinema/cafe/bookstore complex. In 1999, plans were announced to rebrand the building as Muriel's Theater, specializing in live theater. The front facade was removed in preparation for the rebranding, but the project fell through following the collapse of the dot-com bubble in 2000, and the temporary plywood became the public face of the Pagoda Palace. Joel Campos purchased the building in 2004 and proposed several different projects, none of which came to fruition due to neighborhood opposition, despite receiving approval in 2009 to convert the building into condominiums. By that time, the theater had been stripped of its interior and exterior furnishings and decorations, and retained very little historical integrity. The vacant building served as a campaign sign for Lynn Jefferson in 2008, a candidate to replace the termed-out Board of Supervisors member Aaron Peskin. Jefferson had adopted the slogan \\"Enough with the plywood\\" and posted it on the theater in reference to Peskin's policies and the notorious opposition to Pagoda redevelopment by the neighborhood group Telegraph Hill Dwellers, led at that time by Peskin's wife, Nancy Shanahan. After Campos's insurance firm refused to underwrite the policy because of the building's corroded blade sign, the local architecture firm Page & Turnbull evaluated the sign's historical significance in 2009, stating that it could be removed to address liability concerns, but further recommending the sign be dismantled and stored. =Central Subway Tunnel Boring Machine Extraction Site Special Use District= The theater's vertical sign as seen from Columbus Avenue in 1992. The site was reclassified as the Central Subway Tunnel Boring Machine Extraction Site Special Use District in 2013 by the San Francisco Board of Supervisors as part of a compromise agreement between the City of San Francisco and the property owner, Joel Campos. Under the terms of the agreement, the city would lease the property to extract the tunnel boring machines (TBMs) \\"Big Alma\\" and \\"Mom Chung\\" (named, respectively, for \\"Big\\" Alma Spreckels and Dr. Margaret \\"Mom\\" Chung), and in return, the property would be reclassified to exempt the planned condominium building from certain Planning Code regulations, including off-street parking and building height. The exemptions allowed the new planned building to match the features, footprint, and height of the demolished theater. The extraction of the TBMs was controversial, as other notable tunnel excavation projects have ended with the TBMs entombed underground, and extension of the Central Subway tunnel could potentially threaten the foundations of neighboring buildings. Nevertheless, a two-year, $3.15 million lease agreement was made between the City and Campos, the property owner. Extending the tunnel to the Pagoda site would lay the groundwork for a potential future Muni Metro station in North Beach, and was offered as a compromise instead of digging up Columbus Street to retrieve the TBMs, which would have disrupted traffic and slowed local business. =Demolition= The theater was torn down later in August 2013 after being vacant for 20 years and the site was used for removal of the Central Subway's tunnel boring machines. The National Trust for Historic Preservation cited the site as one of ten historic sites lost in 2013. =Redevelopment= The owner of the site received approval in 2009 from the City Planning Commission to build an eighteen-unit luxury condominium complex, with a ground-floor restaurant. After the building was razed, City Supervisors Julie Christensen and Scott Wiener raised the idea for the city to purchase the site in preparation for the third phase of T-Third line expansion, which has been proposed to run the Muni Metro line past North Beach to Fisherman's Wharf. The city lease on the property expired on May 10, 2015. A spokesman for Campos, the site's owner, stated in 2015 that construction of a condominium complex (revised to nineteen units) would go forward as approved under the 2009 plans. A November 2015 policy analysis report commissioned by Supervisor Christensen identified three neighboring alternate sites that could be used to construct a proposed North Beach station for T-Third. Despite speculation that Campos never intended to build on the site and may have been negotiating for a better price from the city, construction of the new The Palace at Washington Square luxury condominiums commenced in March 2016.

The four pairs of legs are short and stubby in shape and have five segments. At the ends of the extremities, males have unjointed grippers and suckers, while females have claws. Life K. pilae lives off the substance of the beak, which it dissolves by means of a keratinase. They live primarily in the cere and at the base of the beak of the infected birds. They inhabit a single host throughout their life cycle; infection of new hosts occurs by contact.

During the time between his two seasons in Finland he trialed with a couple of 2. Bundesliga clubs and Arminia Bielefeld made an offer to buy Colley. An agreement was not reached however as they could not agree on the transfer fee. As his contract with the Finnish club was nearing the end Colley was described as \\"perhaps our best foreign signing ever\\" by the KuPS club president. =Djurg√•rdens IF and Genk= In August 2014, Colley signed a three-year contract with Swedish side Djurg√•rdens IF, starting the first of January 2015. He played his debut game for the club on 22 February 2015 against √Ñngelholms FF in the Swedish Cup. On 12 August 2016, Colley travelled to Belgium to complete a medical with top-tier club K.R.C. Genk and by doing that Colley missed the training session ahead of the match versus IF Elfsborg which was against the will of Djurg√•rden. Later that day the Director of Sport of Djurg√•rden Bo Andersson told the football site Fotbollskanalen.se that Djurg√•rden were prepared to take the case to FIFA due to the fact that K.R.C Genk without the permission and knowledge of Djurg√•rden booked a flight and hotel for Colley which violated the contract between Colley and Djurg√•rden. Andersson stated that Djurg√•rden would refuse to sell Colley to Genk after that incident. On 14 August, Colley started the match against IF Elfsborg on the bench due to the recent event. The following day Colley was sold to Genk despite the promise not to sell Colley to Genk. The transfer sum was reported by the Swedish newspaper Expressen to be ‚Ç¨2 million and a resale clause which would make Colley the third most expensive defender ever sold by an Allsvenskan team after former Djurg√•rden player Daniel Amartey and IF Elfsborg player Jon J√∂nsson. = Sampdoria = On 19 June 2018 he signed for Sampdoria. He has been found positive to COVID-19 on 13 March 2020. International career Colley was part of the Gambia national under-17 football team that won the 2009 African U-17 Championship as well as the Gambia national under-20 football team that played in the 2011 African Youth Championship. In 2012, he made his debut for the senior Gambia national team in a friendly game against Angola. Personal life Colley is Muslim.

As one of the leaders of the China Democracy Party, Xu organized and participated in the Democracy Wall movement and acted as the chief editor for the journal April Fifth Forum. Xu was twice arrested by the Chinese government and sentenced to a total of 28 years in jail, of which he served 16. After his exile to the United States on 24 December 2002, Xu received an honorary doctorate degree from Brown University, and has since worked there at the Watson Institute for International Studies as a senior research fellow.  Early life and imprisonment  Xu Wenli's ancestral home is in Anqing, Anhui Province, China. He was born in Anfu County, Jiangxi Province, China, on 9 July 1943, during China's War of Resistance against Japan. His father, Xu Yuwen, was a general officer in the War of Resistance against Japan, serving as a surgeon and the director of the Rear Hospital. After Chinese victory on 15 August 1945, Xu and his parents relocated to Nanjing, the new capital of the Kuomintang National Government. Afterwards, Xu successively lived in Chu County in Anhui Province, Fuzhou City in Fujian Province and Anqing City in Anhui Province, where he graduated from elementary school. In 1957, he left for Changchun City in Jilin Province to study at the High School Affiliated to Northeast Normal University, together with his eldest sister. In 1960, he left for Beijing to live with his mother and his second eldest sister and brother, while studying at Beijing No.7 High School (Bei Jing Shi Di Qi Zhong Xue). In 1963, after finishing high school with an outstanding performance, Xu decided not to apply for college because of his dissatisfaction towards the Chinese higher education system and its teaching methods. Determined to be an independent thinker and learner, Xu self-taught himself philosophy, political science, history, world literature, and supported himself on several study trips to the Chinese countryside from 1963 to 1964. Between the years of 1964 and 1969, Xu served in the People's Liberation Army Naval Air Force. After his demobilization, Xu worked at the Beijing Railroad Branch from 1969 to 1981. In 1977, he applied to the publication history major in the Journalism Department at Beijing University. On 9 April 1981, Xu was arrested.

As a result, Xu was found guilty in 1981 of the crime of organizing counterrevolutionary groups. On 15 November 1980, Xu proposed a comprehensive reform of Chinese society in his \\"Gengshen Reform Proposal\\". On 1 October 1979, he participated in organizing and leading a series of events including the \\"Stars\\" (Xingxing) art exhibition demonstration. Therefore, in 1981, Xu was found guilty of spreading counter revolutionary propaganda and incitement. Xu was arrested on 9 April 1981, and sentenced to 15 years in prison with revocation of all political rights for 4 years in 1982. He was emancipated on 26 May 1993, after which he dedicated his time travelling to prepare for and advance ideas of forming a Chinese opposition party.

Cole, a drag queen, entertainer and cabaret owner and operator in Portland, Oregon, United States, Guinness World Records has certified her as the oldest drag queen performer on the West Coast, and her career as an entertainer spans 51 years. Biography Cole was born in 1930 and raised in the Linnton neighborhood and served in the United States Armed Forces, and was discharged after the during Korean War in the late 1950s, after which he lived a \\"conventional\\" life in southeast Portland with his wife and two children. Funds he received from the military helped Cole start new business ventures. He first purchased a coffeehouse called Caff√© Espresso, which later relocated and was expanded to include a basement jazz club called Studio A. In 1967, due to urban renewal Cole purchased a tavern in northwest Portland called Demas, which became Darcelle XV Showplace. Cole first wore a woman's dress at age 37. By 1969, he had developed the \\"alter ego\\" Darcelle and came out as gay. He left his wife and began a relationship with his artistic director Roxy Neuhardt, although they remained legally married, his relationship with his children was strained. During the 1970s, the Showplace became a popular destination for cabaret and drag performance. In 1999, Darcelle became the oldest female impersonator on the West Coast, after the closing of San Francisco's drag venue Finocchio's Club. In 2010, Darcelle served as grand marshal of the Portland Rose Festival's Starlight Parade and received the city's Spirit of Portland Award. That same year, Cole and Sharon Knorr published his memoir, Just Call Me Darcelle; Knorr also served as director of Cole's 2010 one-person show of the same name. During his childhood, where he was described as a shy, \\"four-eyed sissy boy\\". Cole was discharged from the military in the late 1950s following the Korean War, Cole worked at a Fred Meyer store and described himself as having \\"a crew cut and horn-rimmed glasses\\". =Darcelle= Entrance to Darcelle XV Showplace Cole, who had an interest in acting and had worked at Portland Civic Theater, developed his \\"alter ego\\" Darcelle and came out as gay. The name \\"Darcelle\\" honors French actress and singer Denise Darcel. Darcelle wore false eyelashes, jewelry, and shiny clothing. Cole has described Darcelle's persona as having \\"sequins on the eyelids, lots of feathers, big hair, big jewels, and lots of wisecracks\\". Avoiding an Oregon law that prohibited the use of more than one instrument during performances, entertainers at Darcelle XV Showplace lip-synched. The business was fined after Neuhardt performed a \\"ballet-like adagio\\" with another man. Darcelle and the Showplace have become part of Portland's culture over the years. Darcelle attends many social functions throughout the city. In 2011, she served as grand marshal of the Portland Rose Festival's Starlight Parade and received the city's Spirit of Portland Award. That same year, Cole and Sharon Knorr published his memoir, Just Call Me Darcelle. The book recalls Cole's life, including his childhood, military service, and experiences as Darcelle. Cole also shared stories of Portland's culture, from his visit to Old Town Chinatown with his mother in the 1930s, to Magic Garden as a lesbian club in the 1960s, to his description of the Hoyt Hotel. Reception Darcelle XV Showplace has hosted the longest-running drag show on the West Coast. In 2011, Willamette Week Kelly Clarke called Darcelle the \\"unofficial welcome wagon\\" to Portland for forty years. She wrote that Just Call Me Darcelle reads blandly, \\"like a plainspeak transcription\\", but also acknowledged the value of his recollections of Portland culture, spanning more than 75 years. In her review of Cole's memoir, Clarke described him as \\"an energetic businessman whose desire for a life less ordinary catapulted him from a job at Fred Meyer to become the proprietor of a counterculture coffee shop, an after-hours jazz club, a rough-'n'-ready 'dyke bar' and, finally, a nationally known drag revue, without ever leaving Portland. Darcelle XV was recognized by Guinness World Records as the world's oldest drag queen in 2016, at the then age of 85 years and 273 days.

On 29 November 1735 he was appointed chancellor of the diocese of Winchester, and was ordained deacon by his father on the following 7 December, and priest the 21st of the same month. He was immediately received into Frederick, Prince of Wales's household as his chaplain, as he afterwards was in that of the Princess Dowager, on 6 May 1751. Hoadly accumulated preferments. He obtained the rectory of Mitchelmersh, Hampshire, on 8 March 1737, that of Wroughton, Wiltshire, on 8 September, and that of Alresford, Hampshire, and the eighth prebendal stall in Winchester Cathedral on 29 November of the same year. On 9 June 1743 he was instituted to the rectory of St. Mary, near Southampton, and on 16 December 1746 to the vicarage of Overton, Hampshire. On 4 January 1748 Thomas Herring, archbishop of Canterbury, conferred on him the degree of LL.D. In May 1760 he was appointed to the mastership of St. Cross, Winchester. All these preferments he retained until his death (16 March 1776), except the rectory of Wroughton and the prebend of Winchester, which he resigned in June 1760. Associates David Garrick was a friend and correspondent of Hoadly's. Hoadly, Garrick and William Hogarth once enacted together Ragandjaw, a parody on the ghost scene in Shakespeare's Julius C√¶sar. Hoadly wrote the verses for A Rake's Progress, the printed set of engraving by Hogarth. He was also a friend of Sarah Fielding. Works Hoadly assisted his brother Benjamin Hoadly M.D. in writing The Contrast; or, a tragical comical Rehearsal of two modern Plays, and the Tragedy of Epaminondas, which was brought out at the theatre in Lincoln's Inn Fields on 30 April 1731, and performed three times without success. It ridiculed living poets, especially James Thomson. At the desire of their father the bishop it was suppressed. The Contrast was never printed. It is extant in manuscript, in the Bodleian Library, having been rediscovered in 2004. Other works by Hoadly were: * Love's Revenge: a dramatic pastoral (anon.), 1734 ([1737] and 1745); set to music by Maurice Greene. * Jephtha, an oratorio (anon.), 1737; music by Greene. * Phoebe, a pastoral opera (anon.), 1748; music by Greene. * The Force of Truth, an oratorio (anon.), 1764. He wrote the fifth act of James Miller's tragedy Mahomet the Imposter (1744), and completed and revised George Lillo's adaptation of Arden of Feversham (1762). He is said to have assisted his brother Benjamin in the composition of The Suspicious Husband.‚Äô He left several dramas in manuscript: among others The Housekeeper, a Farce, on the plan of James Townley's High Life Below Stairs (in favour of which it was rejected by Garrick); and a tragedy on the life of Thomas Cromwell. Some of his poems are in James Dodsley's Collection; they include a translation of Edward Holdsworth's Muscipula. He also edited his father's works (three volumes, 1773), to which he prefixed a short Life originally in the Biographia Britannica.

It provides social services, youth and senior programs, cultural learning, and meeting opportunities for Indian peoples. For many years, it was located Uptown and is now in the Albany Park, Chicago community area. History Founded in 1953 by Native Americans with assistance from the American Friends Service Committee, the Center was a response to an increasing influx of native people into Chicago. This migration was largely prompted by the Indian termination policy and the Indian Relocation Act of 1956, which sought to assimilate Native Americans into urban America. As noted by the AIC, \\"Native people from tribes throughout the country, arrived in Chicago. In addition to the Oneida, Ojibwa, Menominee, Sac and Fox, and Potawatomi of the north woods, Lakota, Navajo, Blackfoot, Papago, and many others were represented. The result was (and is) a multi-tribal community (including members of more than 50 tribes) searching for a common social and cultural ground.\\" The center provided, and provides, a way for the people it serves to build community organizations and support in the city. From its start, the Center has been overseen by the Native American members, from a variety of tribes, who make up its board. One of its longest running social and educational programs is the annual pow-wow, and it has also organized study opportunities, exhibits and conferences with academic institutions. The Center has also collaborated with Chicago Public Schools to establish alternative education programs for Native American students, including Little Big Horn High School in 1971. In addition to its present center in Chicago, which opened in 1966, in 2005 it opened the Trickster Gallery in Schaumburg, Illinois, to showcase contemporary Native American artists. Trickster Gallery is no longer affiliated with AIC. The AIC is a member of the Chicago Cultural Alliance. Archery at the American Indian Center hosts a Junior Olympic and Adult Achievement program.

Writing According to an interview Ashbery gave to The Paris Review, he wrote the poem largely on typewriter. > when I was writing ‚ÄúThe Skaters,‚Äù the lines became unmanageably long. I > would forget the end of the line before I could get to it. It occurred to me > that perhaps I should do this at the typewriter, because I can type faster > than I can write.

I don't want to be forever bound to this machine.John Ashbery > interviewed by Peter A. Stitt. Interviews: John Ashbery, The Art of Poetry > No. 33 in The Paris Review No. 90 (Winter 1983). Ashbery later described the poem as \\"A meditation on my childhood which was rather solitary\\" and he often associated his childhood not as a painful experience but one of boredom.Ashbery, John. Interview with Janet Bloom and Robert Losada, in Packard, William (editor) The Craft of Poetry Interviews from The New York Quarterly. (New York: Doubleday, 1974), 119. Ashbery agreed with that boredom was formative to his art, similar in vein to the statement of Larry Rivers to fellow New York School poet Frank O'Hara that \\"the history of art and the history of each artist‚Äôs development are the response to the discomforts of boredom.\\"Rivers, Larry and Weinstein, Arnold. What Did I Do? The Unauthorized Autobiography. (New York: HarperCollins, 1992), 113. It is thought by several critics that the title \\"The Skaters\\" refers to a passage in British poet William Wordsworth's autobiographical long poem The Prelude (1805), or possibly to a passage by American transcendentalist writer Henry David Thoreau in WaldenHerd, David.

This 100-year storm dropped Pakistan's highest 24-hour rainfall ever reported in the neighboring city of Islamabad accumulating to an astounding , while Rawalpindi at Shamasabad (Northern Rawalpindi) received during the same storm, while Chaklala, Rawalpindi recorded .http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/DPS/TC-DPFS-2002/Papers- Posters/Topic3-NaeemShah.pdf =August= August is the wettest month with an average rainfall of as the monsoon peak during this month. August is a hot and humid month, however, thunderstorm activity reaches its peak primarily due to the monsoon. On average a thunderstorm happens every other day also attributing it as the wettest month of the year. Slightly lower mean maximum temperature of is recorded, while average minimum of has been observed. Record high temperature for August is was recorded on 11 August 1987 and the record low of on 3 August 1976. Similarly to July, some of the strongest thunderstorms are formed during this month that result in severe wind storms. One such powerful thunderstorm was reported from Northerly direction on 26 August 2005, which not only caused most of the city to lose power, but motorists faced hazardous conditions due to falling trees. Pakistan Meteorological Department recorded wind gusts of 90 knots or . Record rainfall for the month is a massive recorded in 2013. Furthermore, it is not unusual to experience + rain showers within 24 hours during July and August. The highest dew point was of was recorded on the morning of 7 August 2015, which made the temperature of felt like an oppressive . Flooding in lower elevations of the city is common as well. The temperature by mid August becomes comfortable enough that plantation season begins in the city. =September= September is cooler and relatively less humid than the subsequent two monsoon months. It is referred as a post monsoon month, which usually entertains less moisture than the peak season. However, Western Disturbance interact more with the monsoons during this month resulting in strong thunderstorm activity and heavy wind and rain. Not only do the temperatures begin to decrease from August, but the drop in humidity makes the outdoors more comfortable. This month holds plenty of sunshine as the average high of , while average low is recorded at . the record high and low temperature is was recorded 5 September 1982, and was recorded on 26 September 1984, respectively. Rainfall during this month is plenty at . However, recent years have experienced a spike in post monsoon rainfall activity. On 14 September 2011, a severe thunderstorm struck Rawalpindi with a maximum gust of 85 knots (157 km/h) and caused torrential downpour recording a total of in a matter of couple of hours. In 2011, a total was recorded, which was at that time a recent record . However, in 2014, this monthly rainfall record shattered completely by a low air pressure system that moved and stalled over the North East Punjab region causing cloud burst conditions in some areas between 3 and 5 September. At Chaklala, the 24 hour rainfall was recorded at an astounding , while Shamasabad weather station recorded . The total accumulation for the month was setting a new record for 2014. =October= October is a warm and dry month with plenty of sunshine throughout the day. Humidity drops rapidly as the monsoons recede from the country and is replaced by westerly winds. Typically, wind speed increase around noon and usually dies down by night time. However, these winds are dry as western disturbance activity also drop significantly. Some of the lowest relative humidity values are experienced during this month. Therefore, average rainfall is scanty at . Temperature range is high during this month as nights begin to enter the cool temperature range with warm sunny days. The average low is a cool at while a warm is the average high. Record high for the month is hot recorded on 1 October 2009. and a record low of has been recorded on 31 October 1984. The previous record rainfall for the month was a shy recorded in 1997. However, October is witnessing erratic rainfall patterns in recent years increasing its monthly average. One such example happened in 2015 between the 25th and 26th of the month when of rain fell in just 24 hours on 25 October 2015.Lai Nullah Flood Forecasting and Warning System Pakistan Meteorological Department Islamabad This 24 hour accumulation alone was 4 times higher than monthly average of the month. The record set for 2015 totalled an impressive . =November= November is a pleasant; however the driest month of the year as the mean rainfall is barely . Therefore, relative humidity during this month is also the lowest throughout the year. This month receives the greatest amount of sunshine hours as overcast days during both October and November are very rare. Moreover, November demonstrates a continuation of very similar weather pattern observed in October, but with significantly cooler day and night temperatures. A few thundershowers cool down the weather further and officially sets cold weather during this month. But more recently, not only has the month exhibited warmer temperatures during the day and night, it is also becoming even drier. The average low for November is . Day temperature ;however, due to high temperature range, is still warm at an average of Record low for this month recorded on 28 November 1970, while the record high of has been recorded on 2 November 1999. =December= December is the second coldest month in Rawalpindi after January with a record low temperature of recorded on 25 December 1984. The average low for the month is a chilly , while comfortable highs of are typically recorded during the day. The record high has been recorded at on 7 December 1998. Typically on a sunny day temperature range during the last three months can be in excess of that results in the comfortable outside temperature during day time. During the least active weather periods, lack of rainfall, low wind speeds and cool temperatures during the month results in foggy/smoggy conditions during early morning times. It is the second least windiest month of the year. It is not uncommon for people of all age groups to enjoy the afternoon and evening sun because of its irreplaceable warmth. Western Disturbances begin to affect the city more frequently, but strong thunderstorms are rarely experienced. Mean rainfall increases significantly from the month of November to an average of , most of which happens in the last fortnight of the month. Heat island effect Like most major cities of Pakistan, Rawalpindi not only lack vegetation, but experiences a phenomenon known as the Urban Heat Island. Urban Sprawl and lack of adequate vegetation has witnessed a rise in both day and especially night temperatures. Although some of the above normal temperatures can be attributed to climate change. However, in comparison to its green neighbour Islamabad, Rawalpindi can experience nights up to 2-5 ¬∞C warmer. During the recent years (after 2012), Rawalpindi on average is starting to experience warmer temperatures at an average of 1.5 degree Celsius. Not long ago (up until the late 1990s), Rawalpindi was merely 0.5 to maximum 1 degree Celsius warmer than its twin city, Islamabad. In 2015, during the month of May, Rawalpindi's night temperatures were on average 21.6 degrees Celsius, while Islamabad (only 8 kilometers north in a much vegetated area) recorded an average low of 18.1 degrees Celsius. To show the extremity of this phenomenon, on 8 May 2015, Islamabad experienced a minimum temperature of 18 degrees, while Rawalpindi recorded 25.5 degrees Celsius. This is the highest temperature difference experienced on a clear night between the two cities.

Besides genetics he has worked in wildlife conservation and river management. He has been a Director of the Test and Itchen Association, and a panel member of the European Food Safety Authority. He is an elected Fellow of the Institute of Biology and the Linnaean Society. Served as the editor of the Molecular and Cell Science section of the Journal of Fish Biology, and also on editorial boards of other journals in the past. Norman was also a Trustee of Marwell Wildlife Park for many years, and served as its Honorary Scientific Advisor. Maclean has authored, co-authored and edited over a dozen textbooks and reference books in genetics and cell biology. Between 1984 and 1991 he edited an annual review entitled 'Oxford Surveys on Eukaryotic Genes' (published by Oxford University Press) and most recently edited Silent Summer (Cambridge University Press, 2010). His most recent book A Less Green and Pleasant Land (Cambridge University Press, 2015) was published in early 2015. Biography Maclean was born in 1932 in Edinburgh, Scotland. He was educated at George Heriot's School before going on to obtain a Scottish Diploma in Agriculture at Edinburgh University. Changing track he graduated with a 1st Class Honours in Zoology, and later completed his PhD on ribosome/messenger RNA specificity. Following the completion of his doctorate, Norman spent a year at Rockefeller University, New York as a Sir Henry Wellcome fellow. Maclean married Jean Kay Smith in 1962. Jean has worked as a medical general practitioner for most of her married life, and together they have two children; Lorna, born in 1965, and Gavin born in 1967 Although reared in a Protestant sect called the 'Exclusive Brethren'; Maclean is an active member of Humanists UK and currently serves as a chair of the local branch. Maclean began his career as a lecturer at the University of Southampton at the [then] Department of Zoology under the headship of Professor Leslie Brent, was later promoted to a personal chair in Genetics, and eventually went on to become Head of the Department of Biology. During his career he has been a visiting fellow and professor at Universities including; the University of California at Davis; the University of Dalhousie, Canada; the Institute of Hydrobiology, Wuhan, China; the Oceanographic Institute, Cumana, Venezuela; the Institute of Cell Biology, Moscow; and the Biotechnology Institute, Godollo, Hungary.

In the vast majority of vertebrates there are distinct embryonic, foetal and adult globins. His early work was directed at trying to reactivate foetal globin expression, chiefly working with the amphibian Xenopus and chickens. He was, however, unsuccessful in this project; and indeed the problem remains largely unsolved until the present. Moving on and with the advent of molecular genetics and the availability of cloned gene sequences, Maclean worked ‚Äì for a time ‚Äì with Professor Steve Wratten on the use of DNA fingerprinting in understanding aphid infections of cereal crops. For a few years he also collaborated with Dr David Oscier (a medical consultant at Bournemouth Hospital) on the haematological disease of polycythaemia. Maclean is best known for his pioneering work on transgenic fish, along with his friend and colleague Zuoyan Zhu. Using rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), zebrafish (Danio rerio) and tilapia; he used molecular methods to study gene regulation in fish, and was successful in producing growth-enhanced transgenic tilapia for use in the third world. He also collaborated with Aquagene in the United States in producing transgenic tilapia expressing human factor VII (a clotting factor) in their livers. Bibliography * Maclean, N. (1976).

Enrique Moles is considered as one of the foremost Spanish chemists of his time. Life =Early life= Enrique Moles was born on 26 August 1883 in Vila de Gr√†cia near Barcelona to Pedro Moles Alrich and Maria Ormella Figuerola, both of which died while he was still infant. =Studies= Moles obtained the bachelor's degree from Colegio Iberico in Barcelona, and in 1900 he entered to study pharmacy at the Complutense University of Madrid. In 1906 he obtained the Doctor of Pharmacy. In 1909 Moles went to study in the University of Munich and in 1910 he attended the University of Leipzig to work on determination of atomic weights under Dr. K. Drucker. In 1916, Moles studied with Prof. Philippe A. Guye at the University of Geneva to establish the atomic weight of bromine, and he received the degree Doctor of Physics from the University of Geneva that year. In 1920, after combining all previous studies of chemistry (in Munich, Leipzig, and Zurich), Moles qualified for the third doctoral degree, Doctor of Chemistry. The title of his chemistry doctoral thesis was ‚ÄúPhysico-chemical revision of the atomic weight of fluorine: contribution to the chemistry of this element‚Äù, and he formally received the degree from the University of Madrid only in 1926. =Career= Moles represented Spain in the 2nd General Conference of IUPAC (1921) and later served as the vice-president of IUPAC from 1934-1938. In 1949, Moles attended the meeting of the International Atomic Weight Commission as a prospective member and was elected the first Secretary of the Commission (the Secretary position was created during that meeting). Moles served as the secretary of the Commission until his death in 1953. =Civil war= The Spanish Civil War was a turning point in Moles' career. In 1936, he was a professor and vice-rector of the Complutense University of Madrid, department head of the National Institute of Physics and Chemistry, the Secretary of the Spanish Society of Physics and Chemistry, a member of the Spanish Royal Academy of Sciences. At the time of the outbreak, Moles took over the leadership of the National Institute of Physics and Chemistry (Blas Cabrera Felipe had moved to Paris), and in 1937 Moles was appointed Director of Explosives at this institution, which was now used for military purposes by the Republican government. In 1937, Moles was appointed Director of Explosives. In 1939 Moles fled to France where he signed the manifesto \\"Against the Fascist barbarity,\\" published by El Socialista newspaper on the day after the aerial bombardment of Madrid. This made him the object of reprisals by the Nationalist government upon his return from France in December 1941. He was expelled from the University in January 1944, and joined the Instituto de Biolog√≠a y Sueroterapia (IBYS) as technical advisor. Honors The Institute for Organometallic Chemistry of University of Oviedo was named after Enrique Moles in 1992.

The Centuro gets a remote lock with a flip key, the remote lock uses a 96-bit secure access just like four wheelers. The Centuro has already created a buzz in the market with its design and features and is likely to give leaders Hero MotoCorp, Bajaj, TVS and Honda some serious competition. The bike has been designed and developed from the ground-up at their R&D; facility in Pune, in view of demands and much criticism received from thousands of customers in the segment. Unveiling the new bike, Mahindra Group Chairman Anand Mahindra said the company's success in the two-wheeler territory had disproved sceptics who had advised him against venturing into the segment. Engine Under the tank of the Centuro, there is an indigenously developed, 106.7-cc, MCi-5 (Micro Chip Ignited-5 Curve) single- cylinder, air-cooled four-stroke motor developing 8.4PS and a four-speed transmission. The bike has a five-step rear suspension to provide greater riding comfort on Indian roads. It produces 8.5 bhp at 8500 rpm and a maximum torque of 8.5 Nm at 5500 rpm. It has a four-speed manual transmission and can zoom to 60 kmph from rest in 8.9 seconds. Anti-theft key A striking feature of the Mahindra Centuro is a Central Locking Anti-Theft System with Engine Immobiliser and multifunctional (car-like) flip key with 96-bit encryption, something that is first not just in the segment but a first for all motorcycles made in India. This encryption key invented by Mr. Anik Majumdar. He is a young genius from Konnagar, District : Hooghly, West Bengal, India. He invented many things in his home laboratory, named Holuni. Find-me lamp The bike key can be used to start follow-me-home lights that stay on for while after the key is removed from the ignition, flashing lights with an alarm that aids locating the motorcycle in crowded parking lots, and a LED torch on the key to help find the ignition slot when in a poorly lit area. Fully lit digital dashboard The bike sports an advanced, fully lit digital dashboard which is divided into three parts. The left part hosts the DTE and the fuel gauge. The middle has a big-font digital speedometer with one indicator each for service due and for economy mode. The right toggles between a trip meter, odometer and a clock. It is an unusually comprehensive feature set for an entry-level motorcycle where most bikes offer little more than a speedo, fuel gauge and the idiot lights.

Phelan is an American attorney, town administrator, and politician. He served as Mayor of Quincy, Massachusetts from 2002 to 2008 when he was defeated by challenger Thomas P. Koch in November 2007 and town administrator of Holbrook, Massachusetts, from 2011 to 2015. Early life Phelan graduated from North Quincy High School in 1978. He was a standout basketball player and was elected to the school's athletic hall of fame. Phelan earned a bachelor's degree from Suffolk University and a law degree from the Suffolk University Law School. He worked as a counselor for the Massachusetts Department of Youth Services before beginning a law practic in Quincy in 1989. Phelan married Tracy Tobin, the daughter of former Quincy mayor Arthur Tobin and the brother of state representative A. Stephen Tobin. Quincy school committee Phelan first ran for public office in 1999 as a candidate for the Quincy school committee. During his term on the school board, Phelan clashed with mayor James A. Sheets over the location of the new high school. Phelan successfully blocked Sheets' plan to build the school on contaminated land at a former industrial site in Quincy Point. Mayor of Quincy =First term= In 2001, Phelan challenged Sheets for mayor. It was the first time that Sheets had faced a competitive election since he was first elected in 1989. During the campaign, Phelan criticized Sheets for rising taxes, the unsuccessful effort to reopen the Fore River Shipyard, and for \\"putting the interests of the developers ahead of the people\\". Sheets in turn faulted Phelan for his lack of experience, running a negative campaign, and for not putting forward ideas of his own. Phelan defeated Sheets by fifteen votes in the general election. After a recount, the margin of victory was increased to seventeen votes and Sheets conceded the election. During Phelan's first days in office he was faced with a $4 million budget deficit due to reduced revenue from taxes and fees, including a $1.5 million reduction in the fees paid by the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority, as well as a reduction in local aid from the state government. He was able to avoid layoffs by instituting an early retirement program for city employees, which reduced the city's workforce by over 100 employees. He also had to deal with anger arising from an increase in local property taxes. In September 2002, Phelan suspended eight Quincy police officers for misconduct, which included drinking while on duty, firing weapons in the air, driving under the influence of alcohol, allowing one of the officers girlfriend's to drive a police cruiser, and attempting to cover up the incident, that occurred while they were working a paid detail at a nightclub. In 2003, Phelan negotiated a new lease with Quarry Hills Associates, which ran the newly-opened Granite Links Golf Club at Quarry Hills, that would give the city 10% of the club's gross revenues. That June he vetoed a proposed ordinance that would've implement minimum staffing requirements for the fire department, stating that the city could not afford the cost of the requirements (which he stated would be $8 million over five years). The veto was criticized by the president of the Quincy Firefighters Association, who accused Phelan of not making public safety a priority. Fire Chief Paul O'Connell also objected to the ordinance, citing the cost as well as the fact that only two other municipalities in the country had adopted these staffing requirements. In July 2003, Phelan presented a city budget that called for no layoffs, preserved most city services, and increased the amount of money in the city's reserves. =Second term= In the 2003 election, Phelan faced a last-minute challenge from city councilor Joseph F. Newton. Newton criticized Phelan for moving slowly with plans for a new Quincy high school as well as the poor condition of the city's infrastructure. Phelan was reelected with 73% of the vote, defeating Newton 13,117 votes to 4,775. In 2004, facing pressure from the Quincy Taxpayers Association, the Quincy city council voted to make $700,000 in specific cuts and cut the budget by another $2.1 million without identifying where the cuts would be made. Phelan criticized the council, stating that \\"Rather than do the job and identify cuts, the City Council decided to take credit for the cuts but not take responsibility for the pain the cuts will cause.\\" Councilor Joseph G. Finn countered, stating \\"The mayor's the guy in charge. We don't manage. We're not the administrators.\\" The cuts came after Quincy residents saw their property taxes increase over 45% in four years, the highest of all South Shore communities, due to an increase in property value. The city solicitor, based on an opinion from the Massachusetts Department of Revenue, ruled that the council's vote to cut the budget without specifying what was to be cut was invalid, but upheld the $700,000 in specific cuts. By 2005, the city's reserves had tripled and its bond rating had improved. Phelan used the reserves to pay for a road rebuilding program and increase the school department budget. He also began working on plans for a 65-acre park on the Broadmeadows marshes and the improvement and reconstruction of downtown Quincy. He was also rumored to be a candidate for Lieutenant Governor or another state-wide office in the 2006 election. He ran unopposed in that year's election. =Third term= In 2007, seventeen of the eighteen city worker unions were working without a contract due to conflicts over health insurance costs, which had grown from $18 million in 2002 to $40 million. That June, all 890-members of the teachers union went on strike, which resulted in the closure of all nineteen of the city's schools. The strike ended after four days when the union and school committee reached a tentative contract agreement. In February 2007, Phelan's park's commissioner, Thomas P. Koch (a holdover from the Sheets administration), resigned and declared his candidacy for mayor. The race between Phelan and Koch was marked by personal attacks. Koch questioned whether a home owned by Phelan's wife was properly assessed for tax purposes. Phelan accused Koch of being involved with unsavory deals during the administration of James A. Sheets. Koch also criticized Phelan for showing a \\"lack of respect and a poor tone\\" by clashing with local officials and ineffectively negotiating with unions and for his inaction on building a new high school and dealing with increasing drug-related crime. The race was the most expensive in Quincy history. Phelan spent $441,636 and Koch spent $281,937. Koch defeated Phelan 54% to 46%. =2009 election= On June 2, 2009, Phelan announced that he would challenge Koch in that year's election. The race between Koch and Phelan was described by Boston Globe reporter Robert Preer as \\"one of Quincy's most rancorous mayoral elections in decades\\". The two candidates sparred over the issue of property taxes - Phelan criticized Koch for implementing the largest tax increase in city history while Koch blamed Phelan's administration for leaving him with a large budget deficit that necessitated the increase. They also accused each other of engaging in patronage and deceptive campaigning. During the campaign, WCVB-TV reported that supporters and relatives of Koch who resided outside of the city had voted in the previous election. Both sides challenged the residency of a few of the other's supporters. Koch again defeated Phelan 54% to 46%. Holbrook town administrator In March 2011, Phelan was offered the position of town administrator of Holbrook, Massachusetts. The Holbrook board of selectmen voted 5 to 0 on March 8, 2011, to appoint Phelan as interim town administrator. That October he was offered the permanent position. In December 2011, Phelan was criticized by members of Holbrook's school committee for discussing school regionalization with the town manager of Abington, Massachusetts, after town meeting voted against it. In April 2013, the chairman of the Holbrook finance committee filed an ethics complaint against Phelan, alleging that an e-mail Phelan sent to him in error demonstrated at least an appearance of conflict with regard to the school committee election. A spreadsheet attached to the e-mail appeared to be a contact list for the purpose of influencing the election. Phelan said he wrote the e-mail on his own time and sent it from a personal account. No violation of state ethics laws was found to have occurred. Phelan resigned as town administrator on May 15, 2015, in order to run for mayor of Quincy in the city's 2015 election, where he was defeated by a 55.9% to 43.1% margin by incumbent Thomas Koch.

He later received his MFA in Writing from the University of San Francisco in 2002.http://www.azcentral.com/community/ahwatukee/articles/2008/03/04/20080304tr- refreshments0305.html?nclick_check=1 Musician The first Tempe band Edwards joined‚Äîtwo weeks after moving to Phoenix‚Äîwas the Solemines with Jim Gerke (singer, guitarist), Tim Anthonise (guitarist, later of Gloritone) and Dan Lancelot (drummer). The Solemines played its first Tempe gig in May 1990, mere days after Art‚Äôs twenty-first birthday. The Solemines led off for Tempe favorites the Gin Blossoms many times, made a six-song demo funded by Gin Blossoms‚Äô then manager Laura Liewen, and disbanded in 1991. A short-lived version of the Solemines, dubbed ‚ÄúSolemines II,‚Äù involved the same lineup minus Lancelot on drums, who was replaced by Dustin Denham, formerly of the Mortals. In 1992, Edwards formed the Hanson Brothers with Jim Gerke and Dustin Denham. The band played gigs sporadically in 1992-1993, and Edwards utilized his time in the trio to hone his songwriting skills. He wrote ‚ÄúCarefree,‚Äù which would later be recorded on the Refreshments album Fizzy Fuzzy Big & Buzzy, during this time. The Refreshments formed when, in May 1993, Denham suggested Art and he bring in Roger Clyne to sing lead. The trio played five songs at their first rehearsal, ‚ÄúCarefree‚Äù and four Clyne/Mortals songs including ‚ÄúPsychosis‚Äù and ‚ÄúGirly.‚Äù They added Brian Blush, formerly of August Red, later in 1993 to round out their sound, and played their first gig in January 1994 leading off for Flathead at Long Wong's. Edwards married Raquel Edwards in 1995, days before the Refreshments drove to Los Angeles to record its first album for Mercury Records. The band recorded two albums for Mercury in the mid-1990s and toured extensively in the U.S. in 1996-1997.http://www.azcentral.com/community/ahwatukee/articles/2008/03/04/20080304tr- refreshments0305.html?nclick_check=1 After The Refreshments broke up in early 1998, Edwards didn‚Äôt play music again until 2004, when he performed as a solo artist, sideman, and with Art Edwards and his Defunct Band. He released his first solo album Songs from Memory in 2008, and is currently working on his second album. He hasn‚Äôt played publicly since 2009. Writer Edwards' first novel, Stuck Outside of Phoenix, was released in 2003, and re-released on his own imprint Defunct Press in 2008. It has been made into a feature film, which premiered May 2, 2013. The film was produced by Nico Holthaus, directed by Dean Mongan and stars Brandon Hannifin. Ghost Notes, Edwards' second novel, was released on Defunct Press in 2008, and won the 2009 PODBRAM Award for best work of contemporary fiction.http://podbram.blogspot.com/2010/01/2009-podbram- awards.html Edwards' third novel, Badge, was named a finalist in the Pacific Northwest Writers Association's Literary Contest for 2011,http://www.pnwa.org/displaycommon.cfm?an=1&subarticlenbr;=382 was released February 4, 2014 release. Badge is published by Thirteenth Note, a joint venture of Edwards and his wife. All of Edwards' novels are part of a series, and he intends to write ten of them, each \\"rooted in the West, and to be rock novels in the loose sense that the protagonists will at minimum have had their ethos formed by their early experiences with rock music and playing in bands.\\" Edwards will dedicate 2014 to releasing and promoting Badge. Edwards is currently finishing the screenplay version of his second novel Ghost Notes, is halfway through a memoir project, and just finished a draft of his fourth novel One Star. His shorter work has appeared in The Writer and Salon, among many others.

Paul Kellenberger is the company's current CEO and President. History  zSpace was founded as Infinite Z in 2007. Infinite Z's virtual- holographic platform, the zSpace, was created with backing from the Central Intelligence Agency's In-Q-Tel fund, which invests in technology startups. Infinite Z formally changed its name to zSpace in 2013. zSpace found its place among relatively untapped \\"geospatial markets\\" with users who would make use of 3-D manipulation technologies. Although the initial target markets were enterprise-based, prospective clients began to recognize a nearly limitless potential for zSpace applications in any endeavor where 3-D study and interaction would be beneficial. zSpace soon found its way into a variety of sectors including government, medicine, education and gaming. In 2012, zSpace was a featured product for NASA's \\"TechBriefs\\". The company collaborated with NASA to be tested as interface technology for future robots, using the program to interact with simulated objects in virtual environments using its imaging displays. In November 2012, zSpace released an independent software development kit. In 2014, zSpace collaborated with researchers at the University of Tokyo to develop a high speed gesture tracking system. The technology is being used in hospitals by surgeons before procedures. zSpace All-in-One for Education In September 2015, zSpace announced a partnership with Leopoly, a 3D content provider and modeling platform, to create an application that enabled users to create and customize digital objects for 3D printing. That same year, the company released an updated version of its desktop All-In-One (AIO) system, zSpace for Education. The new platform allowed users to manipulate an array of virtual, 3D objects including building circuitry and experimenting with gravity. The release included more than 250 STEAM (science, technology, art and math) lesson plans aligned to the Common core, Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and other state standards for K-12 education. In January 2016, zSpace released a virtual reality internet browser it developed in partnership with Google Chrome's WebGL team. zSpace and GeoGebra announced the release of VR Math, a mathematics application designed for all levels of education in February 2016. The software includes subjects like geometry, algebra, spreadsheets, graphing, statistics and calculus. At the ISTE conference in June 2016, zSpace announced new Human Anatomy Atlas content as a result of its partnership with Visible Body. The company also announced that it had partnered with Google to combine zSpace's VR technology with the Google Expeditions Pioneer Program. Beginning that same year, zSpace demonstrated its technology to schools across the country via its Mobile Classroom Tour. The tour allows K-12 students around the country to engage with the company's STEAM applications in a lab setting and experience a variety of different simulations. The company partnered with Shenzhen GTA Education Tech Ltd., and Mimbus in 2017 on automotive training and welding applications. In 2018, zSpace announced integration with Autodesk Tinkercad as well as a partnership to bring Merriam-Webster's online dictionary. Product  zSpace 200 display At ISTE 2015, zSpace released the All-in-One for Education in collaboration with Foxconn Technology Group. The system previously consisted of a virtual reality monitor and separate computer. The updated system provides students with a realistic learning environment that aligns to the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), Common Core and state standards. The virtual-holographic images can be lifted from the screen and manipulated with the accompanying stylus. The solution allows for group interaction as participants only need 3D glasses as opposed to VR headsets. The zSpace system uses a 1920 x 1080 pixel LCD screen, and the hardware switches between the left and right images through a circularly polarized light that enters the eye. The glasses contain small reflective tabs that the computer uses to track where users are looking. This software prevents nausea and headaches by keeping the image focused. At ISTE 2018, the company launched its first Windows 10 laptop for schools that integrates elements of augmented and virtual reality, to manipulate images from the screen with a stylus. In 2019, zSpace added Career and Technical Education (CTE) to its K-12 STEAM applications, which prepare students for certifications and supplementary trainings through VR learning.zSpace Expands AR/VR Apps for CTE Students have graduated from high school with a certified nursing assistant certification using zSpace.How VR and AR take CTE programs to the next level Recognition A boy studying with zSpace display The company's technology has been awarded Tech & Learning's \\"Best in Show\\" at the ISTE conference from 2015-19 and the magazine's \\"Award in Excellence\\" in 2016, 2017 and 2018.

David Garrick wrote a prologue for it, and acted the part of Ranger. It hit the popular taste, was often repeated on the stage, and was published in 1747 with a dedication to the king. The critics Samuel Foote and John Genest also praised it. A farce by Charles Macklin, The Suspicious Husband Criticized, was produced at Drury Lane on 24 March 1747. Hoadly also wrote a comedy The Tatlers, which was acted at Covent Garden on 29 April 1797 for Joseph George Holman's benefit, but was never printed.

He was a pioneer of the River Murray steamboat trade. Albert Landseer was born in London in 1829 the only son of Henry Landseer and his wife Lucy. He was a cousin of the noted animal painter Sir Edwin Landseer, who sculpted London's famed Trafalgar Square lions. He studied sculpture under a Mr Johnson, but abandoned art and migrated to South Australia in 1848. Member of the South Australian Parliament in 1881 Business ventures A.H. Landseer Limited warehouse at Morgan, now the Morgan Museum ‚Äì one of several buildings built by Albert Landseer along the River Murray Landseer started a business as a small building contractor for a time before joining the gold rush to Forest Creek, Victoria, about 1850; he was successful there and subsequently on occasional journeys to other goldfields. In 1858 his attention turned to the steamboat trade, then in its infancy, and started a mercantile business, initially in Port Elliot, with his brother-in-law J. P. Tripp. He acted as an agent for Captain Francis Cadell's River Murray Navigation Company and built up his company through wider ventures based on the river. Its headquarters were in Milang, which he had founded in 1856, and woolsheds and offices were in Goolwa, Morgan, and the sea port of Port Victor from where wool was shipped to Europe. He also had extensive interests in flourmills in Milang and elsewhere on Lake Alexandrina, and he owned barges and river steamers, including Bourke, Despatch, Eliza, Gertrude and Industry. Parliamentary career Landseer was elected in 1875 to the South Australian House of Assembly as the senior representative in the multi-member electoral district of Mount Barker.As senior MP for the District he was partnered with W. A. E. West Erskine, who was succeeded in May 1876, by J. G. Ramsay. Other partners were successively F. W. Stokes, Sir Lancelot Stirling, MLC, Dr (later Sir) John Cockburn and C. M. R. Dumas. In 1880 he was appointed to a parliamentary select committee to investigate the building of a railway line to connect Strathalbyn ‚Äì hence the whole agricultural district ‚Äì to the Adelaide‚ÄìMelbourne inter-colonial railway line then under construction. He made sure the committee heard evidence supporting a branch line to Milang in addition to the main connecting line, and in November 1881 the enabling Act authorised both. By then, however, Morgan, with its direct rail link to Adelaide, held primacy over the downstream ports. Moreover, the river trade was on the eve of decline. He retired from parliament in 1898 after 23 years' continuous membership, a record at the time. In an obituary, he was described as: > always fearless in his advocacy of what he considered just, and equally > courageous in opposing anything of which he could not approve. Mr Landseer > was a picturesque figure. His snowy white hair and beard, his pink and white > complexion, and a pleasant, dignified manner lent fitting presence to his > position as Father of the House. As he grew eloquent his flowing, winding, > and almost interminable sentences would remind one of his beloved Murray > River ‚Äî swift and serviceable, but not deep. Landseer was probably too inflexible on matters of principle to succeed in government: his private correspondence reveals distaste for the sharp practices of politics and a refusal to countenance underhand activity on his behalf. His support for Charles Kingston's ministry of 1893-99 was tempered by doubts about the premier's personal integrity. Barely veiled contempt for the land-owning gentry of Strathalbyn and Mount Barker almost certainly cost his business dearly. After Landseer's resignation from parliament in 1899, his health was undermined by rheumatism and, later, heart disease; and his fortune by the decline of the river trade and reckless speculation in the Western Australian gold boom. He died on 27 August 1906 and is buried in Milang cemetery. His estate was sworn for probate in Victoria and South Australia at ¬£15,716 (about $2.3 million in 2018).Based on the Australian Retail Price Index. Personal Landseer married twice: to Rosina Masson (ca.1830 ‚Äì 29 April 1871) on 4 November 1856, and Harriet Sarah Taylor (ca.1852 ‚Äì 15 September 1928) on 15 August 1872.

He represented Bossier Parish in the lower house of the legislature from 1904 until his accidental death in 1930. Hughes was born in the Rocky Mount community of Bossier Parish to William Josiah Hughes (1837-1921), a captain in the Confederate Army, and the former Mary Ann Clark (1843-1923). His home in Rocky Mount remained in the family until 1972, when it was donated to the Bossier Restoration Foundation. In 1995, the house was relocated to Benton, the seat of Bossier Parish government. There the Hughes House sets in Benton Square near the Bossier Parish School Board office. Hughes and his first wife, Lula Dubois Hughes (1869-1899), had three daughters: Mary Virginia (born and died 1894), Martha \\"Mattie\\" L. Hughes Dowdell (1895-1970), and Margery Hughes O'Kelley (1896-1973). Hughes later married Annie Oliver, who was born 1882 in Giles County, Tennessee. They had one daughter, Annie Elizabeth Hughes Hale Tucker, who was born in 1906 in Shreveport, Louisiana. Hughes' legislative service traversed the administrations of seven governors from Newton C. Blanchard to Huey Pierce Long, Jr. He was Speaker of the House under Long's short-term predecessor, Oramel H. Simpson; in Louisiana despite the presumed separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches, the governor handpicks the Speaker. Long chose his lieutenant, John B. Fournet, a freshman member from Jeff Davis Parish in southwestern Louisiana, who later became the long-term Chief Justice of the Louisiana Supreme Court. Hughes operated the Kingston Plantation in the Bossier Parish community known as Hughes Spur, presumably named for Hughes' father. In 1930, at the age of sixty-two and still serving in the legislature, he was struck dead by touching a metal cistern which had been electrically charged in a lightning storm. He had intended to use the cistern to fight a lightning-induced fire on his farm. Hughes is interred at the Rocky Mount Cemetery.

Plot Daniel was just an average guy. He was a great videogame player, a big fan of sci-fi movies, and a novice RPG player. In the midst of an RPG, he was teleported to a castle. At first, Daniel believed that he was having a massive hallucination. Eager to keep playing within the RPG to create his own adventure, he decides to go along for the ride until his delirium comes to an end. Once inside the castle, Daniel is inhabited by a mysterious shadow. This dark spirit can communicate with Daniel, but not control him. The shadow has a simple goal: to escape from the prison of Daniel's body. There's a catch, though the dark spirit can only escape if Daniel perishes. Struggling against enemies in the castle, with the dark spirit attempting to murder him at every turn. Daniel finally discovers his goal: to kill Harnakon, the master of the castle, and free the Pure-Spirits who are trapped within.

It is designed to enable a view of the glottic opening without aligning the oral with the pharyngeal, and laryngeal axes as an advantage over direct endotracheal intubation and allows for intubation with minimal head manipulation and positioning.D. Gravenstein, S. Lampotang, AIRTRAQ Laryngoscope,University of Florida Department of Anesthesiology, 2 July 2011, retrieved 2 July 2013  Description  Airtraq was developed by Pedra A. Gandarias and produced and marketed by Prodol Meditec S.A., Vizcaya, Spain. The standard Airtraq is a disposable article with an eyepiece optic, while the AirtraqAvant allows re- use of the optical system as well as external video monitoring and recording. The Airtraq blade is anatomically formed, with a battery-powered light source at the tip of the blade. The battery power reserve is sufficient to power the bulb for 90 minutes, according to the product information. The light bulb is designed to reach an operating temperature of 40 ¬∞C in order to suppress fogging of the optical system. The visual image is transmitted from a lens at the distal tip of the blade to the optical eyepiece (or monitor) via a series of prisms and mirrors. Apart from the integrated optical system, the handle and blade of the Airtraq laryngoscope also contain a channel for the placement and insertion of the endotracheal tube. The Airtraq laryngoscope is available in four sizes ranging from Infant (size 0) to large Adult (size 3). The large adult size requires a minimal mouth opening of 18 mm. Any type of endotracheal tube can be used with the Airtraq. Endotracheal tubes of inner diameter (ID) sizes 7.0 mm to 8.5 mm can be used with the large adult size.  Use and efficacy  The light source of the Airtraq is turned on at least 30 seconds before use to allow the anti-fogging device and lightsource to reach optimal operation temperature. Unlike in direct laryngoscopy, where the laryngoscope blade is inserted into the mouth laterally, the Airtraq is inserted into the mouth in the mid line and passed over the center of the tongue. While some sources state that the use of the Airtaq is easy and can be adequately and quickly learned by novice personnel, other sources caution that the clinical learning process of the Airtraq laryngoscope is much longer than reported in the literature. The Airtraq has been found to be advantageous over conventional direct laryngoscopy in situations were the cervical spine has been immobilized by a spine board or cervical collar, with movement of the cervical spine being reduced by between 44% and 66% while using the Airtraq.

Gameplay  The player controls DEA agent Victor Corbet. He fights narkomafia in Colombia. The gameplay is similar to Max Payne. The player can use Bullet time and make jumps with aiming. It is also possible to use your guns in both hands. The game has realistic physics and a destructible environment. The game also features boss combats, with the bosses being highlighted with a health meter beneath their portrait. They can intake more damage than the average game enemy, and move faster and deal more damage towards the player. http://www.computerandvideogames.com/148231/reviews/el-matador-review/  Plot After a successful raid to rescue DA daughter in a nightclub owned by a drug lord Alberto Entiendez, Victor Corbet is sent to Colombia to assist the local police in taking down La Valedora Cartel, who were involved in a massacre that killed Victor brother. The police department includes captain Carlos Enterrador, ADA Mia Rodriguez, Sgt. Gabriel Montego and Ricardo \\"Rico\\" Altemetra, a close friend of Victor. Victor first assignment consists of eavesdropping a secret meeting of the Cartel in Hotel Paradiso, Bogota, hosted by drug lord nicknamed \\"El Corsario\\". During the meeting, Victor team is attacked by the Cartel, with Victor being the only survivor. Victor raids the Hotel on his own, and kills \\"El Corsario\\" and several of his men, but the remaining leaders of La Valedora escape by Helicopter. Due to Victor heroic actions at the hotel, he is nicknamed \\"El Matador\\" by his comrades. Rico and Victor are then sent to raid an abandoned factory which serves as a secret drug factory for La Valedora. Victor and Rico are tasked to arrest Guillermo Toro, a drug kingpin who is controlling the operations. During the raid, Victor manages to destroy the factory with C-4, but Toro escapes. Victor and the rest of the team, including Enterrador and Mia, corner Toro in a church. The police raids the church, and in the ensuing shootout Toro is heavily wounded. Victor proceeds to arrest him, but is shot by Enterrador. The police finds out that La Valedora has a training camp in Colombia ¬¥s jungle. Due to Enterrador distrust of the police force, orders Victor to go on his own to dismantle the training camp, run by a former Israeli agent. Victor raids the camp, killing all hostile forces. Thanks to information retrieved by Victor, the DEA finds out that the leader of La Valedora is Helmut K√∂ch, a former SS soldier who lives in his island fortress. The DEA, with Victor and Montego leading the team, raids the island. Victor kills K√∂ch in a gunfight. Documents found in K√∂ch lair reveal that a big drug cargo is being transported in a freighter. Enterrador gathers all police forces to retrieve the cargo, instead of destroying it. Two teams, one led by Rico and Victor, and the other led by Montego, raid the harbor, while Mia serves as air support. During the raid, Rico is shot and killed by an unknown assailant. Victor backfires on him, and unmasks him, turning out to be Montego. Montego reveals to Victor that Carlos pretends to steal the cargo before dying from his wounds. Victor, with the help of Mia, raids the freighter, where Enterrador and several of his Special Ops men are gathered. He manages to make his way, killing all of his men, and wounds Enterrador. Enterrador justifies all of his actions to Victor, claiming that the justice he served is controlled by men worse than the drug lords he has been fighting. Unbeknownst to Victor, Enterrador plans to shoot him with a gun concealed in his pants. Enterrador takes his gun and points it towards Victor before the screen turns into black and a gunshot is heard. A mid- credits title card reveals that Mia was promoted after the downfall of the Cartel. Victor seemingly killed Enterrador in the gunfight, and is now working as an international observer in Asia.  Reception  The game was met with mediocre reviews from critics. It currently holds 54/100 on Metacritic and 57.56% on GameRankings.

John Ballance arrived in Wanganui in August 1866; he was to become New Zealand's prime minister in 1891. Ballance aimed for a career in journalism, had strong political views, and occasionally wrote for the Wanganui Times. The established newspaper at the time was the Wanganui Chronicle founded in 1856. On 3 June 1867, Ballance published the first issue of The Evening Herald after having purchased a printing press. The last edition of The Evening Herald was published on Thursday, 23 March 1876 (volume X, issue 2737) and with issue 2738, the newspaper continued under the new title The Wanganui Herald. On the occasion of commissioning a new printing press that enabled an \\"enlarged paper\\", the title was changed with the following rationale: > A slight modification of the title has long been pressed upon us by numerous > friends, who think that the word Wanganui should form part of the name, > their contention being that the place from whence the paper issues should > appear prominent to those at a distance. After careful consideration, and > not without reluctance arising from an early bias, we have acceded to the > suggestion, The Wanganui Herald being now the designation of our daily > issue. From 1869 to 1906, the evening newspaper was supplemented by a weekly edition. From 1926 onwards, The Wanganui Herald had a children's newspaper as an insert. In 1971, the ownership of The Wanganui Herald and the Wanganui Chronicle came into one company. In 1986, the period of the city having two daily newspapers came to an end with The Wanganui Herald turning into a community newspaper, leaving the commercial market to its long-standing rival, the Wanganui Chronicle. The name of the community newspaper later changed to Wanganui Midweek. Both the Chronicle and Wanganui Midweek are owned by New Zealand Media and Entertainment (NZME).

The reader was released on June 26, 2013 as a response to Google Reader shutting down. The reader is web- based and also has iOS and Android applications as well as a Google Chrome extension. The beta for the reader has received mostly positive reviews. On March 26, 2018, Digg shut down Digg Reader. History Digg Reader was created in response to Google Reader shutting down. Andrew McLaughlin, CEO of Digg, saw a blog post in Fall of 2012 speculating that Google Reader was shutting down. He sent a note to one of his friends at Google jokingly offering to buy the reader. McLaughlin was sent a serious reply that said there was nothing to buy. In February 2013, McLaughlin's friend from Google said, referring to Google Reader,\\"I‚Äôm not telling you anything, but we‚Äôre not going to keep this thing around forever and maybe you want to have something ready by the end of the year.‚Äù When Google announced Google Reader was shutting down on July 1, 2013, Digg announced development of Digg Reader that same night. Digg officially announced development of the reader on March 13, 2013, instead of their original plan of late 2013, moving the project to the top of their priority list. They promised to simulate the best features of Google Reader while also updating it to fit 2013. Digg Reader initially launched on June 21, 2013 as an invite only service and launched publicly on June 26, 2013. On July 2, 2013, Digg Reader announced they are crawling 7.7 million feeds. On March 14, 2018, Digg announced that it would be shutting down Digg Reader on March 26, 2018. =iOS= On June 27, 2013, Digg Reader was integrated into the Digg iOS app in the form of an update. Digg decided not to make the reader a separate app because the company sees Digg.com and Digg Reader as complementary products. Cnet gave the app a 3/5 stating \\"Digg is a beautiful app that blends social news with RSS subscriptions, but bugs and missing features make it suitable only for the most committed Digg users.\\" The app's current version has a rating of 4.5 out of 5 on iTunes. The app received an App Store Best of 2013 award from Apple as well as a Best of 2013 award from TechCrunch. =Android= On August 29, 2013, Digg released an Android app for Digg Reader. Digg says an Android app was the most common request from users. The app has a rating of 3.9 out of 5 on Google Play. =Google Chrome= On October 9, 2013, Digg released a Google Chrome extension for Digg Reader. The extension has a rating of 4 out of 5 on the Chrome Web Store. Reception Early reviews for the beta have been mostly positive. Mashable liked it saying they were \\"extremely impressed\\", but criticized its lack of features such as search and tagging. PC Magazine gave it a 4/5 praising its clean design, speed, and free price tag, but criticized its lack of OPML support, the inability to log in with an email address, and required connection to Google. Autostraddle gave it a thumbs up citing its neat and streamlined look, free price tag, and speed, but was disappointed it didn't have a share feature for Facebook or Twitter. TechCrunch was impressed that Digg was able to produce a functional Google Reader alternative, but said in its current form Digg Reader was not a replacement for Google Reader. Blinklist.com said it is a good way to get the news you want, but lacked a certain appeal when compared to other free apps. MacLife was very critical giving it a 2/5 stating it \\"just barely accomplishes what its creators set out to do\\" and \\"There‚Äôs little doubt Digg Reader will improve with time, but out of the gate, it disappoints. Despite the clean user interface, there are too many basic features lacking, especially for the kind of RSS solution that power users depended upon Google Reader to provide.\\" References External links * Category:News aggregators Category:IOS software Category:Android (operating system) software Category:Web software ","title":"Digg Reader"},{"id":"39841367","text":"NeoSensory exoskin haptic jacket. An ultrathin, breathable garment for immersive VR A haptic suit (also known as tactile suit, gaming suit or haptic vest) is a wearable device that provides haptic feedback to the body. History =Aura Interactor (1994)= alt=A photo of an Aura Interactor vestIn 1994 Aura Systems launched the Interactor Vest, conceived by Aura's VP of Audio and Video Technologies, Larry Shultz to feel sound from video games and TV shows. The Interactor was a wearable force-feedback device that monitors an audio signal and uses Aura's patented electromagnetic actuator technology to convert bass sound waves into vibrations that can represent such actions as a punch or kick. The Interactor vest plugs into the audio output of a stereo, TV, or VCR and the user is provided with controls that allow for adjusting of the intensity of vibration and filtering out of high frequency sounds. The Interactor Vest is worn over the upper torso and the audio signal is reproduced through a speaker embedded in the vest. Sales numbers are unclear, but have numbers as low as 5000 of its Interactor Vest sold in Toys R Us and other electronics stores. Aura later began shipping the Interactor Cushion, a device which operates like the Vest but instead of being worn, it's placed against a seat back and the user must lean against it. Both the Vest and the Cushion were launched with a price tag of $99. ARAIG (2013) haptic suit prototype =HugShirt (2002)= In January 2002, Francesca Rosella and Ryan Genz, then researchers at the Interaction Design Institute Ivrea in Italy, designed the HugShirt . The Hugshirt is a wearable haptic telecommunication device that allows a wearer to send the feeling of a hug to a distant loved one. HugShirts feature touch sensors and haptic actuators that work together to capture and recreate touch over distance. Sensor areas placed on the garment capture the touch of the wearer, the data is transferred to their mobile device where the Hug App creates a Hug message that is delivered to the receiving wearer of a second HugShirt in another location across the world. Actuators in the receiving HugShirt recreate the touch that was created by the first wearer. The HugShirt was awarded first prize at the Cyberat Bilbao Festival, and subsequently awarded by Time Magazine as one of the Best Inventions of the Year 2006. HugShirt (2002) haptic garment for remote touch =3RD Space Vest (2007)= In November 2007, TNGames released the 3RD Space Vest. The vest uses eight trademarked \\"contact points\\" that simulate gunfire, body slams or G-forces associated with race car driving. It is unique because unlike traditional force feedback accessories, the vest is directional, so that action taking place outside the player's field of view can also be felt. A player hit by gunfire from behind will actually feel the shot in his back while he may not be otherwise aware of this using standard visual display cues. Currently, players have three ways to use the vest. Playing games with Direct Integration, such as TN Games' own 3rd Space Incursion, using the 3rd space game drivers whilst playing a game (drivers currently in Beta 2), or installing specially made mods for a game. As of current, the vest works with: Call of Duty 2: 3rd Space Edition, 3rd Space Incursion, Half-Life 2: Episodes 1 & 2, Crysis, Enemy Territory: Quake Wars, Clive Barker's Jericho, Unreal Tournament 3, F.E.A.R., Medal of Honor: Airborne, Quake 4 and Doom 3. =Tactile Gaming Vest (2010)= Demonstrated at Haptics Symposium 2010, the Tactile Gaming Vest (TGV) is a haptic feedback device designed to increase the immersiveness of first- and third-person shooter games and was developed by Saurabh Palan and his team from the Haptics Lab at the University of Pennsylvania. The vest can simulate gunshots, slashing and blood flow sensations. Other sensations, such as punch/kick, body blows, and surrounding environment (temperature, impacts due to artilleries and ammunitions) are also being developed. HAPTIKA haptic feedback suit =ARAIG (2013)= On May 31, 2013, a Kickstarter campaign was launched to raise funds for the development of ARAIG (As Real As It Gets), a force-feedback and electrical muscle stimulation wearable device for use in video games. It features 16 points of feedback on the front, 16 on the back and 8 on each side. The Kickstarter campaign failed, as it only raised $126,625 of its $900,000 goal. =KOR-FX (2014)= The KOR-FX Gaming Vest uses award-winning 4DFX technology that transforms the audio coming from your games or media into pinpointed high- definition haptic (tactile) feedback. This project was funded on Kickstarter in 2014. = Teslasuit (2018) = Teslasuit is a full body haptic feedback platform for Virtual and Augmented Reality. It can transfer sensation from virtual reality to a human body through electric impulses controlled by a mini computer (control unit) with an advanced motion capture system on board. Teslasuit gives the ability not only to observe and experience virtual reality, but to act on their own and feel sensations that are generated in the virtual world.The technology is based on neuro-muscular stimulation that is widely used in electro-therapy, medicine and professional sport.See also Electrical muscle stimulation Teslasuit incorporates a mesh of sensors that could deliver wide range of sensations such as touch, wind, water, heat, cold as well as the force with mild electric pulses. It can also collect data from the body for real time motion tracking and various biometric parameters. Teslasuit was released for use in enterprise and government services XR training in Q1 2019. Teslasuit has won a number of prestigious international awards including best VR/AR product at CES 2019 and Red Dot Award for best of the best (2019) in industrial design.

HAPTIKA feedback vest has been commercialize in March 2016 and they are expecting to commercialize their full body haptic feedback system in July 2016. = SoundShirt (2016) = The SoundShirt is a shirt that allows deaf and hearing audience members to experience music and AR enhanced by touch (haptic) sensations. The SoundShirt was used for its first performance by the Junge Symphoniker Orchestra in Hamburg, Germany. During a live or virtual performance the shirt maps different musical sounds to haptic sensations on different parts of the body, allowing media to be felt physically. The SoundShirt features 30 haptic multi-force actuators embedded into a garment. The SoundShirt is the winner of the 2019 UNESCO NETEXPLO Innovation award, and the Audience of the Future INNOVATE UK Innovation Grant. = Rapture (2016) = The Rapture haptic vest is under development for use in The VOID virtual reality entertainment centers. It is based on vibration motors and transducers. = NullSpace VR (Hardlight Suit) (2016) = NullSpace VR develops a full upper-body haptic feedback suit and gloves with stand-alone tracking for virtual reality. A total of 32 haptic feedback pads are placed around the body with 117 built-in haptic effects. The Developer SDK is currently available for developers to create their own \\"haptic animations\\". NullSpace VR ran a successful kickstarter in March 2017. This project went bankrupt in September 2018.https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/morgansinko/hardlight-vr-suit-dont- just-play-the-game-feel-it/posts/2292833 =AxonVR (2016) = AxonVR, now HaptX, is developing a full body haptic feedback suit based on miniature hydraulic actuators =bHaptics TactSuit (2017) = bHaptics released three products which are a vest based on 40 haptic points, a haptic mask, and a haptic arm band with 20 haptic points. = Woojer (2017) = Woojer is developing a haptic vest with a three-fold patented transducer, the Osci.

It was released in Japan by Bandai Namco Entertainment on March 19, 2014 for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita in celebration of Weekly Sh≈çnen Jumps 45th anniversary. It was re-released for western territories as J-Stars Victory VS+ for the PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, and PlayStation Vita, with an additional Arcade Mode for the international release. It was released in Europe on June 26, 2015 and in North America on June 30, 2015. A follow-up game, Jump Force, released on February 15, 2019 to tie in with the 50th anniversary of Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump. Gameplay J-Stars Victory VS lets up to four players battle it out against one another using a gameplay and graphical style similar to those of Dragon Ball: Zenkai Battle Royale. Fighters can move and fight in all directions on one of twelve 3D battle fields, each based on a location from a different Jump series. Players should learn the lay of the land and formulate a battle plan with a character suited to it. A defeated character comes back after a set amount of time passes. To win the battle, all three sections of the WIN gauge at the top of the screen have to be filled; the gauge fills one section each time an opponent is defeated. Fighters can use regular attacks, power attacks, area- based attacks, and finishing moves. Regular attacks are the main part of the battle, and all combos begin with them. Power attacks leave the user open, but they have a big impact if they connect and their power can be increased by charging them up. Area-based attacks allow to hit opponents over a wide area. By using different techniques, the player can lead his team to victory; learning each character's different power, range, and effects is the first step towards being unbeatable. Playable game modes include \\"J-Adventure\\", a multi-player story mode divided between four campaigns in which players explore a world map, battle various opponents, and collect in-game cards to power up their characters; \\"Victory Road\\", a multi-player battle mode in which players must complete certain predetermined objectives during battles; and a free-battle mode which supports up to two players in local offline play and up to four players via online multiplayer. An additional single-player Arcade Mode is exclusive to J-Stars Victory VS+. Plot The game's story mode, \\"J-Adventure,\\" takes place in Jump World, an amalgamation of the different characters' universes. As the story begins, each of the characters is preparing for the Jump Battle Tournament, a fighting competition organized by the God of Jump World, who promises to grant the wishes of the team that wins. The narrative is split between four different arcs, each focusing on a different team exploring Jump World, gathering more teammates to compete, and working to achieve their own personal goals. The Dynamic Arc focuses on Monkey D Luffy, Portgas D Ace and Seiya; the Hope Arc on Naruto Uzumaki, Yusuke Urameshi, and Gon Freecss; the Investigation Arc on Toriko, Zebra, and Goku; and the Pursuit Arc on Ichigo Kurosaki, Tatsumi Oga, and Hiei. To progress, each team defeats tournament examiners to acquire upgrades for their ships so they can reach the arena; they also acquire additional allies in the wake of a mysterious enemy that can possess them. When one of the teams wins the tournament, the God of Jump World reveals the true purpose of the competition: to gather warriors to combat the Dark Phantoms, an evil force capable of impersonating strong fighters. Using the keys of Effort, Bravery and Friendship, the heroes travel to the Dark Phantoms' world and seal them away. With the Dark Phantoms defeated, all the heroes are offered a wish. They collectively wish to have another tournament so they can fight again and get stronger. Granting it, the God of Jump World rewards the heroes with a feast. Characters The game features 52 characters from 32 different Jump series. 39 of these characters are playable, while 13 of them can be summoned by players to provide support. =Playable characters= ;Assassination Classroom *Koro-sensei ;Beelzebub *Tatsumi Oga paired with Baby Beel ;Bleach *Ichigo Kurosaki *S≈çsuke Aizen ;Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo *Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo paired with Don Patch ;Chiny≈´ki: Tar≈ç to Yukai na Nakama-tachi *Taro Yamada ;Dr. Slump *Arale Norimaki paired with Gatchan ;Dragon Ball *Son Goku *Vegeta *Frieza ;Fist of the North Star *Kenshiro *Raoh ;Gin Tama *Gintoki Sakata ;Hell Teacher N≈´bƒì *Meisuke Nueno (N≈´bƒì) ;Hunter √ó Hunter *Gon Freecss *Killua Zoldyck ;JoJo's Bizarre Adventure *Jonathan Joestar *Joseph Joestar ;Kochira Katsushika-ku Kameari K≈çen-mae Hashutsujo *Kankichi Ryotsu ;Medaka Box *Medaka Kurokami ;Naruto *Naruto Uzumaki *Sasuke Uchiha *Madara Uchiha ;One Piece *Monkey D.

Other characters from each series make non-playable cameo appearances in the game's story mode. Development The game was first announced in December 2012 under the title of Project Versus J, in Weekly Sh≈çnen Jumps second issue of 2013. It was made to commemorate the 45th anniversary of Jump, and has been presented as the \\"ultimate Jump game.\\" J-Stars Victory VS features characters and settings from various Jump manga, both past and present, ranging from older properties such as Dragon Ball, YuYu Hakusho, and Kochira Katsushika-ku Kameari K≈çen-mae Hashutsujo, current long-running series such as Naruto, Bleach, One Piece, and JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, to newer series such as Medaka Box, Assassination Classroom, and Beelzebub. The first three characters that were unveiled and used to promote the game were Son Goku, Monkey D. Luffy, and Toriko. Also in December, it was announced that fans could vote for some of the characters that they want to be included in J-Stars Victory VS. Several other characters were announced over the following months via the \\"Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump\\" and \\"V Jump\\" magazines, as well as characters' transformations which would be available as special moves. The game's adventure mode also features other non- player characters from the various series. Producer Koji Nakajima stated that getting the rights to the multiple franchises was not hard, but rather determining which actions the characters make in the game was the most difficult part. Since some of the characters do not fight in their series, their actions and motions had to be approved by each licensee after many negotiations. He also stated that he originally hoped to include a much larger roster of characters. A limited edition \\"Anison\\" version of the game includes the theme songs from the player characters' television series, such as \\"Cha-La Head-Cha-La\\" and \\"We Are!\\", as music that can be played in-game during battles. The game's own theme song is \\"Fighting Stars\\", performed by Hironobu Kageyama, Hiroshi Kitadani, and Akira Kushida. =J-Stars Victory VS+= In December 2014, Bandai Namco announced that the game would be released in North America and Europe under the name J-Stars Victory VS+. Released in summer 2015, VS+ retains the original Japanese voice-over track and adds an additional single-player Arcade Mode not present in the original release. VS+ also marks the game's first appearance on the PlayStation 4, in addition to the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita as with its predecessor. The new release features an identical character roster to the original, while also incorporating game balance adjustments based on feedback from Japanese players. A J-Stars Victory VS+ Compendium art book and set of PlayStation themes were offered as a pre-order bonus. Reception The game was given a review score of 32/40 by Famitsu. Following its first week of release, the PS3 version of the game sold 118,240 units in Japan while the Vita version sold 97,821 units. Japanese sales tracker Media Create reported that the PS3 version of the game sold through 86.55% of its shipment, while the Vita version sold through 89.25% of its shipment. For a multiplatform release, the Vita version did well, Media Create says. Richard Eisenbeis of Kotaku praised the game's roster for taking from many different series and how each character has a unique fighting style. However, he said that despite this each character plays the same, with strong, weak and knockdown attacks, and titled his review \\"J-Stars Victory VS Gets Real Old Real Fast.\\" He also noted the lack of a meaningful plot in the story mode. The western PlayStation 4 release has a score of 61 on Metacritic while the PlayStation Vita version has a 74; both indicating mixed or average reviews. IGN awarded it a score of 5.0 out of 10, saying \\"Despite a great cast of characters, J-Stars Victory Vs.+ fails to leverage their charm on or off the battlefield.\\" References External links *Official website * *Game Manual (PS3, PS4) Category:2014 video games Category:Bandai Namco games Category:Bleach (manga) video games Category:Crossover video games Category:Dragon Ball games Category:Fist of the North Star video games Category:JoJo's Bizarre Adventure games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Naruto video games Category:One Piece games Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:PlayStation Vita games Category:Saint Seiya video games Category:Spike Chunsoft video games Category:Versus fighting games Category:Video games based on anime and manga Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump (video game series) Category:YuYu Hakusho games ","title":"J-Stars Victory VS"},{"id":"39841479","text":"Dooland Philip Buultjens (23 August 1933 - 25 April 2004) was a Sri Lankan cricket umpire.

He is Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Capstone Financial Group, Inc. His family owned the Pepsi-Cola Buffalo Bottling Corp. and the Buffalo Bison Hockey Club. Pastor has worked at the financial firms American Mortgage Affiliates, JPMorgan Chase & Co., and Prudential. He submitted a bid to acquire the NHL‚Äôs Phoenix Coyotes franchise in 2013. Early life Pastor was born in Buffalo, New York to Sydney and Miriam (O'Mahony) Pastor, the eldest of two children. He is of Irish and Jewish descent and attended St. Andrews Episcopal Academy in Oceanside, New York. He has a younger sister and a half-brother. His paternal grandfather was a Jewish immigrant and entrepreneur, eventually securing the Buffalo Pepsi- Cola franchise in his 40s. Pastor's father and grandfather were both owners of Pepsi-Cola Buffalo Bottling Corporation, and held various other business interests, including a professional hockey team, trucking company, bottling plant, and a Miller Beer franchise located in Cherry Hill, New Jersey. Pastor majored in psychology and sociology at Drexel University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and worked full-time in the family's Pepsi-Cola business. He enrolled in executive management programs and earned certificates from the University of Pennsylvania, Wharton School of Business. Career Pastor began his career working at the family-owned Pepsi-Cola Buffalo Bottling Corp, where he became a Division Manager and Owner. In 1996, after working at the plant for seven years, Pastor became the owner of American Mortgage Affiliates, opening seven retail financial center locations throughout New York state. Pastor sold American Mortgage Affiliates to his partner in 2004. Pastor worked at JPMorgan Chase & Co. for four years, where he was senior vice president and senior investment manager. In 2009 Pastor became Chase's top- selling senior investment manager in the nation. In 2010, Pastor left Chase to become territory sales manager for the greater Los Angeles area with Colonial Life & Accident Insurance Company, and then Managing Director at the Prudential Insurance Company of America. In 2011, Prudential ranked him as their No. 1 managing director in the nation, measured by year-over-year sales growth. In October 2012, Pastor and five financial advisors founded Capstone Affluent Strategies. Within a year of the company‚Äôs launch, Capstone's staff grew to sixty advisors. The firm's post-graduate tuition reimbursement and Financial Advisor Associates programs helped attract new advisors. In 2013, Pastor was recognized as one of On Wall Street‚Äôs ‚ÄúTop 100 Branch Managers‚Äù for his leadership, commitment to advisors, and ability to recruit and retain talent. He was also nominated in 2013 for the Excellence in Entrepreneurship Award hosted by the Orange County Business Journal. In September 2013, Pastor and his associates founded Capstone Financial Group, Inc., a holding company that uses its own capital to acquire outstanding stock of other companies via primary market and private securities transactions. Capstone Financial Group began publicly trading on the OTC Bulletin Board in late 2013 after acquiring Creative App Solutions and its ticker symbol CAPP. Capstone Financial Group, Inc. is a 36.6% beneficial owner of Twinlab Consolidated Holdings, Inc., which owns Twinlab. Pastor currently owns a 74.5% stake of Capstone Financial Group, Inc. and has a current net worth of $70-$140 million. On October 23, 2015, Mr. Pastor filed a provisional patent application with the United States Patent and Trademark Office for a process related to the capture of carbon dioxide emissions, electricity, and water byproducts from gas-to-liquid synthetic fuel manufacturing and its application within vertical farming. Mr. Pastor intends to use this patent-pending methodology to create the first ever mass-producing and emission-free fuel and agricultural manufacturing facility and to license this technology to customers worldwide. Family Ruby, Sam, and Al Pastor, Darin‚Äôs grandfather and great-uncles, bought the Buffalo Bison Hockey Club of the American Hockey League in 1956 when the previous owner threatened to move the team. With many future National Hockey League stars on the roster, the team went on to win the Calder Cup in 1960, 1964, and 1970 and became one of the top clubs in minor league hockey with an average attendance of 10,500 per game. The Pastor family sold the Bisons in 1971 shortly after the franchise joined the NHL as the expansion Buffalo Sabres. The family established the Sam Pastor Pepsi Memorial Hockey Tournament in 1975, which was the area‚Äôs largest youth hockey event, attracting approximately 12,500 people every spring. Held in March and April, the two-month-long tournament attracts as many as 300 teams from Canada, Pennsylvania, and Ohio and provided an estimated $6.75 million boost to the local economy each year. The Pastor family owned the Pepsi-Cola Buffalo Bottling Corp., a regional Pepsi distribution business that grew from a single-truck operation in 1936 to a successful upstate New York plant in 1954, until they eventually sold the company in 2002. Pepsi Buffalo won the naming rights to the Amherst skating and recreational center on May 11, 1998, bidding $550,000 plus incentives that included scoreboards, marketing dollars, and tournament underwriting for the $18.3 million center that opened in the fall of 1998. Phoenix Coyotes Pastor announced on March 29, 2013 that he had formed an exploratory committee in an effort to acquire the Phoenix Coyotes franchise of the NHL. Pastor‚Äôs group, which included several seasoned municipal financing veterans, as well as immediate family members, formally submitted its bid to purchase the team to the NHL on May 10, 2013. Pastor, who hired Scottsdale-based law firm Kutak Rock LLP to help guide the submission of his proposal, sought to keep the Coyotes in Glendale and developed a plan to boost youth hockey participation in the region by partnering with schools, charities, and team sponsors in this area. Pastor‚Äôs bid to purchase the team was declined by the NHL on May 13, 2013.

It was one of the highest educational facilities of various sciences such as theology, law, medicine, astronomy, physics and mathematics, and was founded by the astronomer Ali Qushji who was invited by the Ottoman sultan Fatih Sultan Mehmed to his court in Istanbul. History The medrese are visible next to the garden of the Fatih mosque. The medrese are visible next to the garden of the Fatih mosque (large building in the middle) as the square courtyard buildings covered by dozens of small domes. The medrese complex consisting of eight large and eight smaller (tetimme) medrese were built by order of Mehmed II and completed in 1470. Till the construction of the medreses of the Suleymaniye complex (K√ºlliye) the Sahn-ƒ± Seman medreses were considered as the most prestigious schools in the Ottoman Empire. They were a very large Islamic theological complex, grander in scale and organisation then earlier Ottoman medreses, constructed in the newly conquered (1453) former Byzantine capital city of Constantinople which became the new Ottoman capital. The goal of the complex was to make the city a center of Islamic science. The buildings are part of the symmetrical Fatih complex () and each four of them are located at the northern and southern sides of the Fatih Mosque. Each medrese has a square plan with 19 student rooms and consist of a colonnaded courtyard surrounded by the student cells, each room is covered by a small dome and has a chimney, one large domed room was the \\"dershane\\" (classroom). Each medrese has next to it a smaller medrese consisting of eight student cells whose students received lower education, when they advanced they were given a room of the Sahn-ƒ± Seman medrese. Each room was occupied by one or two students. At the eastern side of the complex there is a hospital (d√¢r√º≈ü≈üif√¢) and a lunatic asylum (tabh√¢ne) who have a similar architecture as the medrese. The Sahn-i Seman complex has in total 216 student rooms, 152 in the eight large and 64 in the eight smaller medrese. If each would be occupied by two, total students would be 432. This medrese complex can be compared to a kind of university of its time. With hundreds of Muslim students studying various sciences such as theology, law, medicine, and the rest of the traditional Islamic sciences. The students (called Suhte or Talebe) trained for scholarship and also for a career in the Ottoman administration, graduates could become medrese teachers themselves or Kadƒ± (judge). The students were lectured by eight teachers (m√ºderris) who had a daily salary of 50 Akche until the reign of Bayezid II. Approximately 40 Akche were considered to be equal to a golden Ducat at that time. During their study, which took several years, the students were given free housing (rooms) and daily free meals at the Imaret (public charity kitchen) of the Fatih complex. There were eight stages during the education, the students of the first seven ranks were called suhte or softa while the highest rank was called by the honorable name of danƒ±≈üman (learned man). The medrese complex was in use till 1924 when they were closed. In 1924 the new secular republic of Turkey (independence in 1923) in an effort to reduce Islamic education, approved the law of Tevhid-i Tedrisat which compelled the closing of all medreses in Turkey. Today the medrese are in a dilapidated state, four of the tetimme medrese have been demolished after World War II to make way for a new road.

It is based on the second part of Ir√®ne N√©mirovsky's 2004 novel of the same name. The film stars Michelle Williams, Kristin Scott Thomas, Matthias Schoenaerts, Sam Riley, Ruth Wilson, Lambert Wilson and Margot Robbie. It concerns a romance between a French villager and a German soldier during the early years of the German occupation of France. Suite Fran√ßaise was filmed on location in France and Belgium. It was released theatrically in the UK on 13 March 2015 and premiered in the US through Lifetime cable network on 22 May 2017. Plot In German-occupied France, Lucile Angellier (Michelle Williams) and her domineering mother-in-law Madame Angellier (Kristin Scott Thomas) await news of her husband Gaston, who was serving in the French Army. While visiting tenants, Lucile and Madame Angellier escape an air raid by German Ju 87 stuka bombers. Following the French surrender, a regiment of German soldiers arrives, and promptly moves into the homes of the villagers. Wehrmacht Oberleutnant Bruno von Falk (Matthias Schoenaerts) is billeted at the Angelliers' household. Lucile tries to ignore Bruno but is charmed by his kindly demeanor and his piano music. Lucile later learns that her husband Gaston's unit has been imprisoned at a German labor camp. Elsewhere, the farmer Benoit (Sam Riley) and his wife Madeleine (Ruth Wilson) chafe under the German officer Kurt Bonnet (Tom Schilling), who harasses Madeleine. Benoit, who was denied the chance to fight because of his leg wound, hides a rifle. As an act of resistance, he steals the German soldiers' clothes while they are bathing. When Lucile discovers that one of her mother-in-law‚Äôs tenants Celine (Margot Robbie) is having sex with a German soldier, Celine reveals that Gaston has been having an extramarital affair and has fathered a girl named Simone. Angry with Madame Angellier for withholding her son's indiscretions, Lucile develops romantic feelings for Bruno and he gifts her a piece of his music score. At Lucile's request, Bruno confronts Kurt over his harassment. Lucile's relationship with Bruno draws the hostility of many of the townfolk. The Viscountess de Monfort (Harriet Walter) later catches Benoit stealing a chicken from her coop. When Benoit points a gun at her, she tells her husband, the collaborationist Viscount de Monfort (Lambert Wilson), who sends the German soldiers after Benoit. While hiding in a barn, Benoit kills Kurt with his gun and flees into the forest. The Germans launch a manhunt and give the town's population 48 hours to surrender Benoit. The German Major (Heino Ferch) takes the Viscount hostage and threatens to execute him if Benoit is not found. At Madeleine‚Äôs request, Lucile hides Benoit in the attic of the Angellier mansion with the help of the reluctant Madame Angellier. Despite a massive manhunt, the Germans fail to capture Benoit and the Viscount is executed by firing squad. With the Germans planning to withdraw from the town, Lucile takes part in a plan to smuggle Benoit into Paris, where the French Resistance is gathering. She manages to convince Bruno to issue her travel pass to Paris. However, Bruno‚Äôs suspicious orderly suspects that Lucile is harboring Benoit and issues special instructions for the checkpoint guards to search her car. At the checkpoint, Benoit manages to shoot the German soldiers dead with his pistol but is wounded in the shoulder. Bruno arrives on a motorcycle. Lucile faces him with her pistol but is unable to bring herself to kill him. To Lucile‚Äôs relief, Bruno helps her lift the wounded Benoit into the car and allows them to escape to Paris. As she drives away, Lucile smiles at Bruno in gratitude. Lucile and Benoit later join the French resistance and help drive out the Germans. While Lucile later learns that Bruno perished during the war, she treasures the memory of his music score Suite Fran√ßaise.

Ronald Harwood, who wrote the script for The Pianist, was set to write the screenplay, with Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall producing the film. The following year, TF1 Droits Audiovisuels acquired the rights to the novel from publisher √âditions Deno√´l. The novel was adapted for the screen by Saul Dibb and Matt Charman, with Dibb directing. In 2013, the film, produced by France's TF1 Droits Audiovisuels and UK's Entertainment One, was given a budget of ‚Ç¨15 million ($20 million). Mick Brown of The Daily Telegraph noted this was \\"big by European, if not American, standards\\". In May 2013, it was reported that Suite Fran√ßaise would be a co- production between France, U.K. and Belgium, with Xavier Marchand, Romain Bremond, Michael Kuhn and Andrea Cornwell producing the film along with American Harvey Weinstein of The Weinstein Company serving as the executive producer. Dibb focused his adaptation on book two of N√©mirovsky's novels, which explores the relationships between the French women and the German soldiers who occupied their village, in particular the story of Lucile Angellier. She is awaiting news of her husband, who went to war, when a German officer is billeted in her home. Dibb said Dibb used the account of the discovery of the manuscript of the novel by N√©mirovsky's daughter, Denise Epstein, to book-end the film. N√©mirovsky's original manuscript is shown during the credits. Epstein died shortly before production began, but she read drafts of the script. =Casting= Varietys Jeff Sneider reported in October 2012 that actress Michelle Williams was in talks to star in Suite Fran√ßaise as the protagonist Lucile Angellier. Shortly after she joined the project, Kristin Scott Thomas was attached to appear as Lucile's \\"domineering\\" mother- in-law. In an interview with Moviefone's Erin Whitney, Scott Thomas commented that the character was similar to herself. Actor Matthias Schoenaerts joined the cast as Bruno, a German officer and Lucile's love interest in November 2012. On 14 June 2013, Dominic Patten from Deadline Hollywood reported that actor Sam Riley had joined the cast as a French soldier called Benoit. Riley's wife Alexandra Maria Lara also joined the cast, along with fellow actresses Margot Robbie as Celine and Ruth Wilson as Madeleine. Actors Tom Schilling and Lambert Wilson will also appear in the film as Kurt Bonnet and Viscount de Montmort respectively. Harriet Walter has been cast as Viscountess de Montmort, while Eileen Atkins will appear as Denise Epstein and C√©dric Maerckx as Gaston Angellier. =Filming= Filming took place in Marville. Principal photography commenced on 24 June 2013. The shoot lasted until late August. The cast and crew spent eight weeks shooting in Belgium and eight days in France. From 10 July, filming took place in the village of Marville in the Meuse department. In August, the cast and crew spent three-and-a-half weeks filming scenes in a house in Belgium. Dibb commented that the hot weather helped create \\"its own weird, uncomfortable, claustrophobic atmosphere which you hope is going to feed into the atmosphere of the scenes.\\" Leo Barraclough from Variety reported that principal photography was completed on 2 September 2013. =Costumes and make-up= English costume designer Michael O'Connor, who previously worked with Dibb on The Duchess, designed and created the clothing for the film. O'Connor used photographs, magazines and movies of the time to make the clothing and accessories as authentic as possible. His major influences were N√©mirovsky's novel, which describes the clothing in detail, and Jean Renoir's 1939 film The Rules of the Game. The costumes use authentic French fabrics from Paris. The film's countryside setting led Jenny Shircore, the hair and make-up designer for the production, to invoke a sense of sobriety in place of glamor. Shircore used quite little make-up on Williams, who understood she must look quite \\"natural, simple, in a sense resigned.\\" =Music= French composer Alexandre Desplat was originally attached to compose the film's musical score. Dibb wanted Bruno's piano piece to be composed before shooting began, and he wanted it to be played during the film as \\"a developing theme\\" and then at the end in its full form. Desplat wrote Bruno's Theme, but was unable to write the final score for the entire film and was replaced by Rael Jones. Jones's score was recorded at the Abbey Road Studios in London. Sony Classical released the soundtrack album on 16 March 2015. It features original music composed by Jones, a piano piece composed by Desplat and songs performed by Lucienne Boyer, Josephine Baker and Rosita Serrano. Dibb explained that music plays a crucial part in the film and called the score \\"subtle and atmospheric.\\" Release On 16 April 2013, it was reported that The Weinstein Company had pre-bought the U.S. distribution rights for the film. On 19 May 2013, it was announced that The Weinstein Company would also handle the distribution rights in Latin America, Australia, Russia and Germany, while Entertainment One would release the picture in the U.K., Spain and Canada. The first trailer for the film was released on 24 October 2014. Suite Fran√ßaise had its world premiere at the Cinema UGC Normandie in Paris on 10 March 2015. The film was originally scheduled to be released theatrically in the UK through Entertainment One on 23 January 2015, but it was postponed to 13 March 2015, and it was released on DVD on 27 July 2015. It was released in France by UGC Distribution on April 20, 2015. Although it had been acquired by The Weinstein Company, the film did not have a theatrical release in the US. It was scheduled to premiere on Lifetime cable network on 10 October 2016, but the release was postponed to 22 May 2017. Reception =Box office= Suite Fran√ßaise earned ¬£503,928 upon its opening weekend in the United Kingdom. The film opened to 425 locations and landed at number four in the UK box office top ten. The following week the film played at a further 21 screens and earned ¬£268,607 for a total of ¬£1,293,408. It fell three places to seven in the box office chart. As of August 2015, Suite Fran√ßaise has earned over $9 million worldwide. =Critical reception= The film received mostly positive reviews from critics. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 76% of 46 critics have given the film a positive review, with an average rating of 5.94/10. The website's critical consensus states, \\"Suite Fran√ßaise takes an understated approach to its period romance, which ‚Äì along with strong performances from a talented cast ‚Äì pays absorbing dividends.\\" Metacritic assigned a weighted average score of 63 out of 100 based on 8 reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews.\\" The Guardians Peter Bradshaw gave the film two stars out of five and likened the central love story to \\"a damp haddock on a slab\\". He continued, \\"This adaptation of Ir√®ne N√©mirovsky's acclaimed bestseller about French folk collaborating with the Nazis is flabby, sugary ‚Äì and passion-free.\\" Emma Dibdin from Digital Spy gave the film three stars and commented, \\"Suite Fran√ßaise works far better as the story of a community in flux than it does as a brooding romance, the shifting loyalties between villagers and soldiers escalating towards a somewhat compelling third act.\\" Anna Smith from Empire rated the film \\"good\\" and said \\"Sterling performances lift the occasionally soapy storyline in this semi-successful adaptation.\\" Varietys Guy Lodge found the film \\"fusty but enjoyably old-fashioned\\", adding \\"iffy scripting decisions can't thwart the romantic allure of this handsomely crafted, sincerely performed wartime weeper.\\" Writing for The Hollywood Reporter, Leslie Felperin's consensus was \\"[Suite Fran√ßaise] has sturdy production values, a tony cast and middlebrow tastefulness up the wazoo, but barely any soul, bite or genuine passion.\\" The \\"Desire\\" trailer for Suite Fran√ßaise created by eOne Films International and Create Advertising London earned a nomination for Best Foreign Romance Trailer at the 16th Golden Trailer Awards. Jones's score was nominated for the Public Choice Award at the 2015 World Soundtrack Awards. Film postscript The film's postscript reads as follows: Suite Francaise was written in secret as the Nazis occupied France. It was never completed. In 1942 its author Irene Nemirovsky was arrested for being Jewish and died in Auschwitz. Her handwritten manuscript lay unread in a suitcase for nearly sixty years until it was discovered by her daughter. Suite Francaise was finally published in 2004 and became a worldwide bestseller. The daughter is quoted to say: \\"It is an extraordinary feeling to have brought my mother back to life. It shows the Nazis did not truly succeed in killing her. It is not vengeance, but it is a victory.\\" Denise Epstein-Dauple References External links * Suite Fran√ßaise at BBC Films * Suite Fran√ßaise at BFI * Suite Fran√ßaise at LUMIERE  Category:2015 films Category:2015 romantic drama films Category:2015 war drama films Category:British films Category:British romantic drama films Category:British war drama films Category:French films Category:French historical romance films Category:French romantic drama films Category:French war drama films Category:British historical romance films Category:Belgian films Category:Belgian romantic drama films Category:English-language films Category:German-language films Category:Films directed by Saul Dibb Category:Films based on French novels Category:Films set in France Category:Films set in the 1940s Category:Films shot in Belgium Category:Films shot in France Category:BBC Films films Category:Qwerty Films films Category:English-language French films Category:2015 drama films ","title":"Suite Fran√ßaise (film)"},{"id":"39841809","text":"Oliver Lloyd (c.1527-89?), of Leighton, Montgomeryshire, was a Welsh politician from Pontyclun.

In a racing career which lasted from September 1974 until November 1976 she won six of her fourteen races and established herself as one of the best British race mares of the 1970s. After winning once as a two-year-old she won the Nell Gwyn Stakes on her first run in 1975 and then appeared to be a very unlucky loser of the 1000 Guineas. She returned from injury to show her best form in autumn, winning the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes over one mile and then defeated a top-class international field in the ten furlong Champion Stakes. She won a second Queen Elizabeth II Stakes and was narrowly beaten in the Champion Stakes in 1976, when her season was again disrupted by injury. She was then retired from racing and became a successful and influential broodmare. Background Rose Bowl was a good-looking bay mare bred in Kentucky by the Engelhard family's Cragwood Estates. She was sired by Habitat, an American-bred, British-raced miler who became one of the leading European stallions of the 1970s and 1980s. His other progeny included Habibti, Marwell, Flying Water and Steinlen and he was the British Champion broodmare sire on three occasions. Rose Bowl's dam Roseliere was one of the leading fillies of her generation in Europe, winning the Prix de Diane and the Prix Vermeille. Timeform rated her the best three-year-old filly of 1968, with a rating on 127. Apart from Rose Bowl, Roseliere also produced the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes winner Ile de Bourbon. Both Habitat and Roseliere were owned by Charles W. Engelhard, Jr. (1917-1971) and Rose Bowl raced in the colours of his widow Jane. The filly was sent to Europe and was trained by Fulke Johnson Houghton at the Woodway Stable near Blewbury in Wiltshire. Racing career =1974: two-year-old season= Rose Bowl, was an extremely late foal, being born on 24 May, and did not race until late September when she finished second in a race over six furlongs at York and then recorded her first success in the Harwell Maiden Stakes over five furlongs at Newbury. She was then moved up sharply in class to contest the Group One Cheveley Park Stakes over six furlongs at Newmarket in October. She started a 25/1 outsider but exceeded expectations by finishing third behind Cry of Truth and Delmora. She was strongly fancied for the Group Three Cornwallis Stakes at Ascot later that month, but ran poorly, finishing fifth behind Paris Review. In the Free Handicap, a rating of the best two-year-olds to race in Britain, Rose Bowl was given a weight of 119 pounds, fourteen pounds behind the top colt Grundy and twelve pounds behind Cry of Truth. =1975: three-year-old season= Rose Bowl began her three-year-old season at Newmarket in the seven furlong Nell Gwyn Stakes, a trial race for the 1000 Guineas. Ridden by Lester Piggott, she started the 7/4 favourite and won impressively by three lengths from Posy with Cry of Truth unplaced. On 1 May, over the Rowley Mile course at Newmarket, Rose Bowl again started 7/4 favourite, but finished fourth behind Nocturnal Spree, Girl Friend and Joking Apart. Piggott had been unable to obtain a clear run on the favourite, who was boxed in on the rail and Rose Bowl appeared to have been an unlucky loser. The filly then sustained a muscle injury which kept her off the racecourse for almost three months. Rose Bowl returned to racing in the Group One Sussex Stakes over one mile at Goodwood in which she was matched against colts and older horses. Ridden again by Piggott she finished second in a three-way photo-finish, a \\"fast-diminishing\\" neck behind the 2000 Guineas winner Bolkonski and a short-head in front of the leading sprinter Lianga. A month later, over the same course and distance, she and Piggott finished second to Gay Fandango in a \\"muddling race\\" for the Waterford Crystal Mile, with Roussalka (winner of the Coronation Stakes and the Nassau Stakes) in third place. In the autumn of 1975, Rose Bowl established herself as the outstanding filly in Europe. In September she ran in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes (then a Group Two race) over one mile at Ascot. Ridden by Willie Carson as Piggott had chosen to ride Gay Fandango she started at odds of 9/2 in a field of five runners and won from Gay Fandango, Anne's Pretender and Bolkonski. In October, Rose Bowl was moved up in distance for the Group One Champion Stakes at Newmarket, in which she was matched against the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe winners Allez France and Star Appeal. Ridden again by Carson, she won the race from Allez France with the Prix d'Ispahan winner Ramirez in third and Star Appeal unplaced. =1976: four-year-old season= Rose Bowl began her third season by finishing fourth in a blanket finish for the Prix Ganay and then won the second running of the Clive Graham Stakes over ten furlongs at Goodwood in May, easily beating Red Ransom and Anne's Pretender. On 15 June she was sent to Royal Ascot where she was injured when finishing third to the subsequently disqualified Trepan in the Prince of Wales's Stakes. In autumn she returned to form to beat Ricco Boy and Dominion in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes, becoming the second horse, after Brigadier Gerard to win the race twice. In the Champion Stakes she came close to a second repeat win, but finished second of the nineteen runners, a neck behind the winner Vitiges. On her final appearance, Rose Bowl was sent to the United States for the Washington, D.C. International. Racing over one and a half miles for the first time she failed to reproduce her best form and finished unplaced behind the French-trained three-year-old Youth. Assessment In 1975, the independent Timeform organisation gave Rose Bowl a rating of 133, making her the highest-rated three-year-old filly of the season: up to that time the only three-year-old fillies to have been rated more highly had been Coronation in 1949 and Petite Etoile in 1959. In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Rose Bowl the sixteenth best British or Irish filly of the 20th century. Stud record On her retirement from racing, Rose Bowl became a broodmare for the stud of Paul Mellon. She was consistently successful, producing at least eight winners: *Golden Bowl (bay filly foaled 1978, sired by Vaguely Noble), won 3 races including the LR Lupe Stakes at Goodwood and placed 3 times including 2nd G3 Cheshire Oaks at Chester from 12 starts in Britain 1980-81 *Crystal Cup (bay filly, 1981, by Nijinsky (CAN) - unplaced both starts, dam of winners including Iktamal and Crystal Cross (1989, by Roberto) *Rose Reef (chesnut colt, 1984, by Mill Reef), won 4 races including the G3 Gladness Stakes at the Curragh and placed 4 times from 11 starts in Britain and Ireland. At stud in Japan. *Antigua Rose (bay filly 1985, by Mill Reef), winner *Rose Campion (bay filly 1986, by Mill Reef), won one race *Sunset Rose (bay filly 1987, by Shirley Heights), won two races *Rokeby (bay colt 1989, by Lomond), won two races, 3rd in the Wood Memorial Stakes *Pure Bravado (bay colt 1990 by Dancing Brave), winner *Rokeby Bowl (bay colt 1992 by Salse), won six races Golden Bowl produced the Prix Exbury winner Nero Zilzal, while Antigua Rose was the grand-dam of the Queen's Plate winner Strait of Dover.

Early life The son of Thomas Holdsworth, rector of North Stoneham, Hampshire, he was born there on 6 August 1684, and baptised on 3 September. He was educated at Winchester College, and in 1694 was elected a scholar at the age of nine. On 14 December 1704 he matriculated at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, but in July of the following year migrated to Magdalen College on his election as a demy, graduating B.A. on 22 June 1708, and M.A. on 18 April 1711. For some years he remained at Oxford as tutor of his college, but in 1715, when his turn came to be chosen fellow, he resigned his post and left the university, because he wasn't prepared to take the oath of allegiance after the Hanoverian succession. Private tutor and scholar For the rest of his life Holdsworth was tutor in households of those who shared his political opinions, or travelled abroad with their children. Alexander Pope wrote to him (December 1737), asking him to support Walter Harte's candidature for the poetry professorship at Oxford. Joseph Spence met Holdsworth in Florence in 1732, and in his Polymetis praised him for his understanding of Virgil. Holdsworth visited Rome in 1741, in the company of George Pitt, and in September 1742 he paid, in company with Thomas Townson and others, long visits to France and Italy, returning home with Townson by way of Mont Cenis in the autumn of 1745. They were met on their last visit to Rome by James Russel, son of Richard Russel, the reputed author of Letters from a Young Painter Abroad. Death Holdsworth died of fever at Lord Digby's house, near Coleshill, Warwickshire, on 30 December 1746, and was buried in the church on 4 January. Works Holdsworth's most famous production was the Muscipula sive Cambro-muo-machia (anonymous, London 1709), a mock-heroic satire on the Welsh people. It appeared first without his consent, and without a printer's name. It was then republished in a corrected form by its author, with a dedication to Robert Lloyd, a fellow-commoner of Magdalen College; and also was immediately reproduced by Edmund Curll, all three editions being dated 1709. Thomas RichardsWelsh Biography Online, Richards, Thomas (1687?‚Äì1760). of Jesus College, Oxford retaliated against this ridicule of his Welsh fellow-countrymen, and issued the same year ŒßŒøŒπœÅŒøœáœâœÅŒøŒ≥œÅŒ±œÜŒØŒ±, sive Hoglandi√¶ descriptio, a satire on Hampshire, Holdsworth's native county. Muscipula was then often reprinted and translated.Muscipula was republished in 1712, in Curll's Collection of Original Poems, 1714, in Curll's Mus√¶ Britannic√¶, Edward Popham's Selecta Poemata Anglorum, ii. 1‚Äì14, Edward Cobden's Discourses and Essays, and in the collections of Holdsworth's works, published in 1749 and 1768. Translations were made by Samuel Cobb of Oxford, in 1709 and 1722 (Taffy's Triumph, and then The Cambro-Britannic Engineer); by a \\"Cantab\\" in 1709; by an anonymous versifier in that year; by Cobden in 1718 (later included in his Discourses and Essays, with a poetic letter to Holdsworth, his \\"chum\\" at Winchester College); by R. Lewis in 1728; by John Hoadly in Holdsworth's Dissertation, 1749, and in James Dodsley's Collection of Poems, v. 258‚Äì68; and by Richard Graves in 1793. Of these versions the author preferred Hoadly's. The other writings of Holdsworth dealt with Virgil. There appeared in his lifetime a volume entitled Pharsalia and Philippi.Pharsalia and Philippi; or the two Philippi in Virgil's Georgics, attempted to be explain'd and reconciled to History. In several letters to a friend [i.e. Charles Jennens], and published at his request. By Mr. Holdsworth, 1742. After his death came out Dissertations upon eight verses in the Second Book of Virgil's Georgics [i.e. lines 65‚Äì72]. To which is added a New Edition of the Muscipula, together with a New Translation, 1749.Both of these treatises, with other articles, were contained in Remarks and Dissertations on Virgil, with some other Classical Observations, by the late Mr. Holdsworth. Published, with several Notes and additional Remarks, by Mr. Spence, 1768, for which Spence was helped by Robert Lowth. Many of these notes had previously appeared in the edition of Virgil by Joseph Warton of Winchester (1753 and 1763, in 4 vols.), and several were included in Spence's Anecdotes (ed. Malone, 1820), pp. 256‚Äì71, but most of them were later omitted by Samuel Weller Singer in his editions of the collection. The substance of the 1768 edition of Remarks was embodied in Miscellanea Virgiliana. By a Graduate of Cambridge, editor of the Theatre of the Greeks and Miscellanea Gr√¶ca Dramatica, Cambridge, 1825, a collection compiled by Philip Wentworth Buckham. Memorial and legacy Charles Jennens of Gopsall in Leicestershire, to whom Holdsworth left his notes on Virgil, placed a plain black marble stone above his grave. In 1764 a monument to his memory, with a long Latin inscription, and with a figure of Religion by Louis-Fran√ßois Roubiliac, was erected in an Ionic temple built by Jennens in the wood at Gopsall known by the name of the Racecourse. The temple fell down in 1835, when the cenotaph was removed into the gardens on the east side of the mansion. The monument still exists, but has been moved to the gardens of Belgrave Hall Museum.British Listed Buildings, Monument to Edward Holdsworth at East End of Garden at Belgrave Hall Including Statue of Religion, Leicester Gopsall Hall Temple today, with an architect's drawing of the original Holdsworth's plan of rebuilding Magdalen College in the Palladian style was approved of, and began in 1733, but only one block, called the New Buildings, was executed.

He lived in southern Massachusetts, where he painted numerous portraits between 1790 and 1795. He later studied medicine and established himself as a doctor at Duxbury. Hathway was born in Freetown, Massachusetts, and was the eldest of six children born to Asa Hathaway and Mary Phillips; his father and grandfather were ship carpenters.'Primitive' artist's work offers glimpse of past. Donna MacLearn, The Patriot-Ledger, June 17, 1987. Retrieved 7 February 2015. The family moved several times, settling in Bristol, Rhode Island in the mid-1780s. The source of Hathaway's artistic training is unknown, though it is believed he may have worked as a decorative artist or apprentice ship-carver; as a painter he appears to have been self-taught. He is known to have been active in the vicinity of Taunton, Massachusetts in 1790. Hathaway arrived in Duxbury in 1791, and began painting portraits of members of locally prominent families. In 1795 he married Judith Winsor, the daughter of a locally important merchant. He took up medicine at this time, possibly at the behest of his new wife's family, studying with Dr. Isaac Winslow of Marshfield. He seems to have abandoned painting, as very few works by his hand are known after the time of his marriage, although paintings dating to as late as 1808 have been documented. Hathaway had twelve children by Judith; at one time the only physician in Duxbury, he was highly respected in the field, and was elected Honorary Fellow of the Massachusetts Medical Society shortly before his death. One of his granddaughters was the abolitionist and suffragist Judith Winsor Smith, and surgeon Frederick Winsor was a great-nephew. Thirty- three portraits by Hathaway are known to exist, dating almost exclusively to the years between 1790 and 1795; all are of relatives and friends, among them the educator and politician George Partridge. He also painted landscapes, portrait miniatures, and overmantels. One genre painting, the Welch Curate of about 1800, is documented; it was adapted from an English mezzotint. Furthermore, he is known to have created at least one wood carving, a figure of an eagle used to crown a temporary arch constructed to inaugurate a new bridge over the Bluefish River, and he carved the frames to some of his paintings. Hathaway died of a hernia incurred while lifting a patient, traditionally held to be Ezra Weston, and is buried in the Mayflower Cemetery in Duxbury. His epitaph, which he may have composed himself, relates to his career as a physician. He was survived by Judith, who would go on to live to be 102, and left his heirs a little more than 700 pounds at his death. A bill of sale for six portraits of the Weston family exists, dating to 1793; it indicates that the paintings cost six pounds, and that Hathaway charged a further three shillings for the frame on the portrait of Ezra Weston. In 2006, a pair of portraits, of Josiah Dean III and his wife, Sarah, were sold at Sotheby's, together fetching $380,000.

A number of further traits, such as a thick winter coat, a small, fur-covered udder or scrotum, efficient thermoregulation, and low metabolic rates at low temperatures, lead to the Yakutian cattle‚Äôs extreme tolerance towards freezing temperatures.

This group of cattle may represent a fourth Aurochs domestication event (and a third event among Bos taurus‚Äìtype aurochs) and may have diverged from the Near East group some 35,000 years ago. Yakutian cattle are the last remaining native Turano-Mongolian cattle breed in Siberia, and one of only a few pure Turano-Mongolian breeds remaining worldwide. Of the five mtDNA haplogroups (T, T1, T2, T3, T4) found in existing taurine cattle breeds, T2, T3 and T4 appear in Yakutian cattle, as in the Turano-Mongolian group in general. T4 is found only in the East Asian breeds, T1 is only found in Near Eastern breeds and T is found in both Near Eastern and European breeds. T2 and T3 appear in the breeds of all three regions. Studies of autosomal DNA markers show a high genetic distinctiveness and point to a long- term genetic isolation from other breeds; geographic isolation beyond the normal northern limit of the species range can be assumed to be the cause.genomic-resources ENAC (14 August 2012): ‚Ä≥Success case study ‚Äì Yakutian Cattle in the land of permafrost.‚Ä≥ 1 picture.

The average milk yield is approximately 1,000 kg per year. Yakutian cows have a rich milk, with an average fat content of 5.03% and an average protein content of 4.69%. The meat of Yakutian cattle is known for its natural marbling.  History  The Yakutian cattle are descended from the indigenous Siberian cattle breeds. The Sakha (i.e. Yakuts) brought it from the southern Baikal region to the lower reaches of the Lena, the Yana, the Indigirka and the Kolyma rivers when they migrated northward in the 13th century. Together with the Yakutian horse, it was the basis of the Sakha culture of meat and dairy livestock in the harsh conditions of the Russian Far North. Yakutian cattle were purebred until 1929, but then an extensive crossbreeding with the more productive Simmental cattle and Kholmogory cattle began. While many other landraces were lost in this era, the Yakutian cattle was saved by traditional cattle breeders and individual scientists.  Present situation  Currently there are approximately 1200 purebred Yakutian cattle, all of them in the Sakha Republic (Yakutia) of the Russian Federation. The breeding population consists of only 525 breeding cows and 28 breeding bulls, the rest are mostly dairy cows. Consequently, the Yakutian cattle are classified as an endangered breed by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). 74% of the cattle are to be found the Eveno-Bytantaysky District, 150 km north of the polar circle on the lower reaches of the Lena River and close to the northern pole of cold (see climate data), the others were moved to the southern part of the Sakha Republic in the first years of this century. They are kept by private farmers and by farming co-operatives and it is also common for non-farming households to keep a few head for private use. The largest herd is held on the experimental farm of the Agricultural Research Institute of Yakutia. The breeding records are maintained by the Laboratory of Cattle Breeding of the Yakutian Research Institute of Agriculture in Yakutsk. Their adaption to the extreme climatic conditions of northern Siberia, their genetic distinctiveness and resulting high genetic value for the maintenance of cattle diversity, and their cultural value have led to conservation efforts which resulted in the Russian Federation passing a law to protect and conserve them, the world‚Äôs first conservation law for a domestic breed.

Biography Gordon is the son of pianist Anita Gordon and composer Louis B. Gordon. Gordon began playing the cello at the age of eight. His first teacher was Mary GIli in Millburn, NJ, and in high school he studied with Jerome Carrington in the pre-college division of the Juilliard School. As an undergraduate and graduate student he studied with Harvey Shapiro at the Juilliard School in New York followed by studies with Joel Krosnick. His principal chamber music teachers were Samuel Sanders, Paul Zukofsky, and the Juilliard String Quartet. He cites George Neikrug as a particularly influential teacher in applying the physical principles of Demetrios Dounis to cello playing. During his freelance years in New York City, Gordon received critical acclaim for his work with various new music ensembles, made a series of recordings for The Group for Contemporary Music, and became a resident cellist for the annual Composers Conference and Chamber Music Center at Wellesley College where he has been every summer since 1989. In 2002, Gordon was appointed cellist of the Naumburg Award winning Lydian String Quartet, joined the music faculty of Brandeis University in Waltham, MA, and quickly became an active participant in the Boston and New England chamber music scene. In 2005 he began performing in a duo with pianist Randall Hodgkinson which has been described as \\"insightful and impassioned\\" by The New Yorker; their New World recording, \\"Leo Ornstein: Complete Works For Cello and Piano,\\" was named one of the top 10 classical recordings of 2007 by the All Music Guide. In 2012 he was appointed an Artist Member of the Worcester Chamber Music Society.

Medical conditions are normally defined pathologically (liver inflammation) or clinically (excessive urination) and not etiologically, and therefore it is normal to have more than one cause for them. The word is used as an opposition to homogeneous, meaning that given a group of patients, the disease is the same for all of them. When a condition is heterogeneous, it is normally divided in endotypes. Endotype An endotype is a subtype of a condition, which is defined by a distinct functional or pathobiological mechanism. This is distinct from a phenotype, which is any observable characteristic or trait of a disease, such as morphology, development, biochemical or physiological properties, or behavior, without any implication of a mechanism. It is envisaged that patients with a specific endotype present themselves within phenotypic clusters of diseases. One example is asthma, which is considered to be a syndrome, consisting of a series of endotypes. This is related to the concept of disease entity Heterogeneity in medical conditions The term medical condition is a nosological broad term that includes all diseases, disorders, injuries and syndromes, and it is specially suitable in the last case, in which it is not possible to speak about a single disease associated to the clinical course of the patient. While the term medical condition generally includes mental illnesses, in some contexts the term is used specifically to denote any illness, injury, or disease except for mental illnesses. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), the widely used psychiatric manual that defines all mental disorders, uses the term general medical condition to refer to all diseases, illnesses, and injuries except for mental disorders. This usage is also commonly seen in the psychiatric literature. Some health insurance policies also define a medical condition as any illness, injury, or disease except for psychiatric illnesses. As it is more value-neutral than terms like disease, the term medical condition is sometimes preferred by people with health issues that they do not consider deleterious. It is also preferred when etiology is not unique, because the word disease is normally associated to the cause of the clinical problems. On the other hand, by emphasizing the medical nature of the condition, this term is sometimes rejected, such as by proponents of the autism rights movement. The term is also used in specialized areas of the medicine. A genetic or allelic heterogeneous condition is one where the same disease or condition can be caused, or contributed to, by varying different genes or alleles. In clinical trials and statistics the concepts of homogeneous and heterogeneous populations is important. The same applies for epidemiology See also * Endotype, each one of the etiological subclasses of a given heterogeneous condition.

They inhabit both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans at abyssal depths, and also occur in the Southern Ocean and around Antarctica at slightly shallower depths. The family was named after Br√≠singamen, a necklace belonging to Freya from Norse mythology that was stolen by Loki and hidden in the sea. Characteristics Novodinia pacifica Members of this family have a small, Ophiurida-like disc, clearly demarcated from the arms, which number more than five. The disc is approximately circular with a rim of fused plates which gives rigidity. The madreporite is near the margin of the disc. The arms are long and tapering with the ratio of the arm length to the disc radius being greater than 6/1. There is an acute angle between them and they can be shed at the base where they are separated from the disc by a deep groove. After a narrow cylindrical portion, the part of the arms closest to the disc accommodates the gonadal tissues and widens out somewhat. Beyond this area, the arms taper to a long point. The plates on the aboral (upper) side of the arms are small, and are much smaller than the marginal plates, which are armed with spines. The ambulacral groove on the underside of each arm is broad and there is a row of tube feet with suckers on either side of the groove. The pedicellariae are crossed. Biology Members of this family live on hard surfaces at depths between . They raise their arms vertically above their discs to filter feed on suspended organic particles drifting past. They are able to raise their arms in this way because of the small size of its plates on the aboral surfaces of their arms which gives them flexibility in a vertical plane. Novodinia is less adept at raising its arms, because of a different arrangement of the plates; in contrast, members of the other brisingid family, Freyellidae, have not been detected raising their arms in this way.

The Bussigny‚ÄìLausanne connecting curve was opened in 1856. The Jougne-Ecl√©pens Railway started work on the Cossonay‚ÄìVallorbe section in 1870. A cross-border connection to the French rail network was opened in 1875 with the completion of the tunnel under the Col de Jougne. However, the trains from France to Switzerland had to make a zig zag turn until 1915, when the opening of the Mont d‚ÄôOr Tunnel and the new line to Frasne created a direct route. The SNCF initially maintained the line to Pontarlier via the Tunnel de Jougne, but this suffered significant damage in the Second World War, including the blowing up of the Tunnel de Jougne by the French army, and it was not rebuilt. = Lausanne‚ÄìBrig = The first section of the line went in operation on 10 June 1857 when the Compagnie de l'Ouest Suisse opened the Villeneuve‚ÄìBex section. The line was completed by the OS, the Compagnie de la Ligne d'Italie (\\"Company of the Italian line\\") and the Compagnie du chemin de fer du Simplon (\\"Simplon Railway Company\\") in subsequent stages, ending with the closing of the Leuk‚ÄìBrig gap in 1878. The upgrade to two continuous tracks between Lausanne and Brig was completed in 2004. The construction of the L√∂tschberg Railway was completed in 1913 and, in preparation, Brig was upgraded to be a junction station. After 1919, the Sion‚ÄìBrig section was electrified at 3000 Volt 16 Hertz three phase, but between 1923 and 1927 the line was electrified throughout at the modern SBB standard single-phase 15 kV 16.7 Hz AC system. With the opening of the L√∂tschberg Base Tunnel in 2007, Visp station became an interchange station between services from the Bern region to Zermatt and services towards Sion. Since then all trains to and from the Base Tunnel have run over the Simplon line between Visp and Domodossola. = Brig‚ÄìDomodossola = Construction of the Simplon tunnel The first tube of the Simplon Tunnel was completed after eight years of construction and, along with the continuation of the line to Domodossola, it was opened in 1906. The connection to Domodossola included the Varzo elicoidale, which was probably the longest spiral tunnel in the world. The Simplon tunnel was electrified with 3000 Volt 16 Hertz three-phase AC power from the beginning of operations until 1930. The second tube of the Simplon tunnel was built between 1912 and 1921 and opened to traffic in 1922. In 1930, the route from Brig to Domodossola was electrified throughout with the standard Swiss system of 15 kV/16 Hz AC, which with its high voltage better suited the steep south ramp than the Italian 3,000 Volt DC system. The dispatcher at the nearby Italian south ramp (Iselle‚ÄìDomodossola) has worked under Swiss regulations since the establishment of the SBB. Until the electrification in 1930, the 2.5 percent grade on the section was worked by steam, using a large number of C 5/6 locomotives that had been reallocated to the Brig depot after the electrification of the Gotthard Railway. The section, which is equipped with the Swiss train protection system belongs to Ferrovie dello Stato (FS), which also provides the ground personnel. Even in the 21st century, with open access, the majority of traffic on the Italian section is hauled by Swiss locomotives. Since 1992, there has been a single-track link, electrified on the Swiss system, from Domodossola I station to the Domodossola II marshalling yard to provide access for Swiss locomotives. The marshalling yard mainly provides changes of traction for through freight trains.  Operations Since the closure of the Trans Europ Express service from Paris to Milan, only nightly passenger trains have run the full distance. These trains are operated by Trenitalia under the name of Thello and run on the Paris‚ÄìDijon‚ÄìMilan‚ÄìVenice route, which was also used by the former Venice- Simplon Orient Express. These services are operated with ETR 610 stock. = Long-distance services= Between Vallorbe and Lausanne long-distance TGV services run to/from Paris, which are extended in the winter season to Brig. Between Cossonay and Bussigny or Lausanne the route is still operated by ICN trains, which run over the Jura Foot Railway. Between Lausanne and Brig, InterRegio services run to and from Geneva Airport. Between Lausanne and Domodossola, EuroCity services run from Geneva to Milan or Venice. With the opening of the L√∂tschberg Base Tunnel in 2007, InterCity services running on the Romanshorn‚ÄìBrig route and EuroCity services running on the Basel‚ÄìMilan route use the section between the south portal in Visp and the north portal of the Simplon Tunnel in Brig. = Regional services= In the Rhone Valley Regional services run from Brig to Sion or Saint-Gingolph. In addition, five of the seven lines of the R√©seauExpressVaudois run on sections of the Simplon railway between Lausanne and Renens. The S2 runs between Vallorbe and Lausanne, the S1 between Cossonay and Villeneuve, the S3 between Renens and Villeneuve, the S4 between Renens and Lausanne and the S11 between Cossonay and Lausanne. = Freight = Freight trains run on the line.  Route = Vallorbe‚ÄìLausanne = Le Day Viaduct The line includes the section from the border station of Vallorbe to its northern connection to the RFF line from Dijon. After crossing the Le Day Viaduct, the line reaches station of the village of Le Day. Immediately afterwards is the junction to the line of the Pont‚ÄìBrassus railway to Le Brassus. Between the stations of La Sarraz and Cossonay, the Jura Foot Railway from Olten connects with the line. The two routes run together to Bussigny, where there is connection to the line to Geneva at a wye junction. This allows trains running between the Jura Foot Railway and Geneva to avoid reversing at Lausanne. The line reaches Lausanne via Renens. = Lausanne‚ÄìBrig = At St. Saphorin on Lake Geneva After Lausanne station, the line to Fribourg and Bern branches off to the left in the middle of the SBB rolling stock depot, while the Simplon line remains on the shore of Lake Geneva. Some Lavaux communities have stations on both lines, such as Pully (Pully and Pully Nord) or Lutry (Lutry and La Conversion). Vevey is reached via Pully, Lutry and Cully. The Vevey‚ÄìChexbres railway, which ends here, is a one-track connection to the line to Bern and can also function as a bypass of Lausanne for the Simplon Railway, but it is rarely used as such. In addition, the narrow-gauge MVR line runs from here to Les Pl√©iades. The line reaches Montreux via La Tour-de-Peilz, Burier and Clarens (which is within the Montreux municipal boundary); it is the only Swiss station with three different gauges. Here, the MVR Montreux‚ÄìGlion‚ÄìRochers-de-Naye railway branches off to Rochers de Naye and the Montreux Oberland Bernois Railway to Lenk. After Montreux, the line runs past Chillon Castle and the former H√¥tel Byron to Villeneuve. Three narrow gauge lines branch off in Aigle to Leysin, Les Diablerets and Champ√©ry. In Bex, the narrow-gauge Bex‚ÄìVillars‚ÄìBretaye Railway runs to the Col-de-Bretaye. The line from Saint-Gingolph connects with the Simplon line in Saint-Maurice. The line then reaches Martigny, where two lines branch off. Both are operated by the TMR, the narrow gauge Martigny‚ÄìCh√¢telard Railway towards Chamonix and a standard gauge line to Orsi√®res with a branch to Le Ch√¢ble. A few kilometres later, the line reaches Sion and shortly later Sierre, before reaching the language border between French and German. The first stop in the Upper Valais is Leuk. In Visp station there is a connection to the Matterhorn-Gotthard-Bahn (MGB) from Zermatt and the L√∂tschberg Base Tunnel connects with the line. The MGB runs from Brig, where the L√∂tschberg Mountain Railway connects with the Simplon line towards the Upper Valais. = Brig‚ÄìDomodossola = Although the line crosses from the property of the SBB to that of the Ferrovie dello Stato in Iselle, Domodossola is electrified with the Swiss electrical system and uses Swiss operating rules. The ground staff, however, are provided by FS. BLS class Re 485 locomotive passing through Iselle. After Brig, the line runs into the Simplon Tunnel, in the middle of which is the national border between Switzerland and Italy. The tunnel ends at Iselle di Trasquera where, as in Brig, there is a terminal for the carriage of cars through the tunnel. This is followed by the 1.7 km-long Trasquera Tunnel and the 3.0 km-long Varzo Spiral Tunnel. The line reaches Domodossola via the halts of Varzo and Preglia. The catenary of the section on Italian territory is built to the Italian overhead line standards‚Äîbut it is charged at 15 kV / 16.7 Hz AC. The signals comply with SBB standards. The trains continue from Domodossola over the Domodossola‚ÄìMilan railway, which is owned by the Italian infrastructure company RFI.

A primary consideration for firefighters addressed by these orders is to be able to gain timely warning of a danger allowing the firefighter to safely escape. The orders were developed from lessons learned in a number of major wildland fires that led to the deaths of trapped firefighters including the Shoshone National Forest Blackwater fire of 1937 and the Helena National Forest Mann Gulch Fire in 1949. The order can be a basis for evaluating the aftermath of a firefighting situation, although some firefighters have criticized the orders as being difficult to follow.

His signing bonus of $1,000 was so little, after taxes, that he needed to ask his mom for some additional money so that he could have enough to buy an iPhone. When he was promoted to the majors two years later, Blue Jays general manager Alex Anthopoulos said: \\"Clearly ... and I say that respectfully, we got him wrong.

Pillar made several highlight reel catches throughout the season, including scaling the left field wall to rob Tim Beckham of a home run on April 15. Blue Jays fans voted it the play of the year and Pillar called the catch a \\"life-changing moment\\" that brought him from obscurity to prominence in Toronto and around the league. On June 2, Pillar recorded his first career two-home run game, and became the first right-handed batter to hit two home runs in one game off of Washington Nationals' ace Max Scherzer. He was named the Blue Jays Player of the Month for June, as voted on by the Toronto Chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA), for a month in which he batted .365 (4th in the AL) with 5 stolen bases (tied for 7th in the AL) and 18 RBIs (tied for 10th in the AL).

She created over 30 ballets, of which almost nothing remains. Early life Andr√©e Howard was born in London on 3 October 1910. Her career as a dancer began as a pupil of Marie Rambert and she also studied in Paris where she danced in early performances of L√©onide Massine's '. Career Her ballet Death and the Maiden (choreography and costumes) for Ballet Rambert based on the music by Franz Schubert was premiered at the Duchess Theatre, London, on 23 February 1937, danced by herself as The Maiden, and John Bryon as Death. On 18 January 1940, it received its American Ballet Theatre premiere at The Center Theatre, New York, danced by Howard, and with Kurt Karnakoski as Death. Her 1939 Lady into Fox was based on David Garnett's 1922 first novel under his own name Lady into Fox. Reviewing the 2006 reinterpretation, Judith Mackrell of The Guardian called it \\"a seminal Ballet Rambert work\\". Unfortunately, all that choreographer Mark Baldwin could find of the original choreography was a 12-minute jerky silent film. Baldwin stated: \\"There are all these fabulous ballets like Lady Into Fox still waiting for us to dip into. The past is such a fabulous resource.\\" Her best known work is ', based on an episode in Alain Fournier's novel '. It was created in 1940 for London Ballet, with stage design and costumes by Sophie Fedorovitch. It has been performed over 200 times by The Royal Ballet, and by Scottish Ballet. In 1938, she was one of the founding members of Antony Tudor's London Ballet along with Hugh Laing, Agnes de Mille, Peggy van Praagh, Maude Lloyd and Walter Gore. With the onset of World War II, in 1940 was invited with them to New York, joining Richard Pleasant's and Lucia Chase's reorganised Ballet Theater. Chase's company was later to become the American Ballet Theatre. In 1946, Mardi gras featured Nadia Nerina's first created role, dancing alongside John Cranko, Kenneth MacMillan and Peter Darrell. In 1947, Howard created The Sailor's Return for Ballet Rambert, based David Garnett's 1925 novel, The Sailor's Return. The story involves a West African princess marrying an English sailor and then encountering racial prejudice in England. In Dance Research, Susan Jones noted that the ballet \\"offers a striking critique of racism in a realist mode\\" and comments on \\"her important contribution to narrative ballet and the distinctiveness of her presentation of female experience in the period\\". In 1948, the Crown Film Unit released the film, Steps of the Ballet, with choreography by Howard, music by Arthur Benjamin, directed by Muir Mathieson, decor and costumes by Hugh Stevenson, and narration by Robert Helpmann. The dancers were Gerd Larsen, Alexander Grant, Gordon Hamilton, Elaine Fifield, Michael Boulton, Michael Bayston, Jeanne Artois, Peter Wright, Moyra Fraser, Leila Russell A Mirror for Witches premiered on 4 March 1952, with the Sadler's Wells Ballet, at the Royal Opera House. It was based on the novel A Mirror for Witches by Esther Forbes, and consisted of a prologue and five scenes, with music by Denis ApIvor and set design by Norman Adams RA. The Spectator described Howard as \\"both brave and wise in her selection, because ballets of such serious import seldom enjoy a popular appeal, and because we are sick to death of those eternal period frolics which challenge neither choreographer, dancer nor spectator.\\" ' premiered on 4 September 1958, with the Edinburgh International Ballet, Empire Theatre, Edinburgh. The Royal Ballet premiere was on 2 September 1959. The composer was Alexander Goehr. It was based on the poem of the same title by John Keats. Howard also designed the sets and the costumes. Clive Barnes for The Spectator called it a \\"weak- kneed, indeterminate work\\".

History Westlake Mall was built on a former lake bed, along US Highway 11. The mall opened in 1969 with three anchors, Sears, Grant's, and Loveman's. In 1970, former Governor George Wallace held a campaign event for re-election at the mall that was estimated to be attended by 10,000 people, one of the biggest turnouts during his last gubernatorial race. In the late 1970s and 1980s, the mall saw decline. In November 1983, an 18 year old female was raped after being kidnapped near the mall by masked abductors. All three original anchors closed by 1989, making it a dead mall or deserted mall. Continuing urban sprawl southwestward toward the Tuscaloosa County line and increased crime and poverty in the city of Bessemer all contributed to the mall's demise. During the mid 1980s, there was an effort to turn the mall into a factory outlet center, though many regular stores were still open.(19 March 2009). West Lake mall's owner dreams of revival in Bessemer, Alabama, Birmingham News In 1994, Bruno's Supermarkets opened a flagship store in the former Sears anchor location. It was the company's largest store. The mall continued to operate with a small assortment of stores, including a Goody's Family Clothing store in the former Loveman's anchor location. The Goody's store relocated elsewhere in the late 2000s, and Bruno's filed bankruptcy in 2009, closing its store at the mall. The center was sold to Bessemer used-car dealership owner Anthony Underwood, who wants to revive the center once again as an outlet mall. , the mall sits vacant and sealed, with several of its entrances blocked.

G√©nissiat dam is the largest, to the left The G√©nissiat dam is a hydroelectric dam on the Rh√¥ne in France near the village of Injoux-G√©nissiat. Construction began in 1937, but was delayed by World War II, and the dam did not start generating power until 1948. By 1949 it had the greatest capacity of any dam in Europe. Background The concept of damming the Rhone had been discussed since the 19th century. In 1906 the Harl√©- Blondel-M√§hl group published a proposal for a great dam at G√©nissiat. They were supported by the Groupe Giros-Loucheur and by Schneider. They had to compete with a rival proposal by a Franco-Swiss group, and both groups appealed to geologists to support their claims. The French speleologist and expert on limestones √âdouard-Alfred Martel declared that the G√©nissiat scheme was pure folly: It would be impossible to anchor the dam in the limestone, which was anyway porous and would not retain the water. The Swiss Maurice Lugeon, a specialist in large dams, refuted his arguments, declaring that the limestone would hold and calling Martel an amateur experimental geologist. There was no immediate outcome to this debate, but later Lugeon's views were confirmed by tests by the Compagnie Nationale du Rh√¥ne. Preparatory work The Compagnie Nationale du Rh√¥ne (CNR) was founded in 1933 to undertake construction and operation of the dam. In 1934 the state granted the concession to harness the river. The architects were L√©on Bazin, Pierre Bourdeix and Albert Laprade. Pierre Danel was the engineer of the spillways and Paul Galabru was the overseeing engineer. Preliminary work began in February 1937, and official authorization to undertake the project was granted on 21 June 1938. The L√©on Chagnaud et fils company was given the contract to divert the Rhone from the site. They built a temporary dam from steel rods and rock to divert the water into two underground channels, both wide, high and long. The diversion was opened successfully in April 1939, handling per second of water. World War II (1939-1940) caused delays. On 21 March 1940 the Entreprise de Construction du Barrage de G√©nissiat (ECBG) was created, a consortium of public works companies. In June 1940 the site was flooded. After the armistice between France and Germany of 22 June 1940, work resumed slowly. Many of the workers joined the underground resistance, and there were several incidents, including a deadly one on 12 February 1944. Construction The project restarted in 1945 after the war ended. Three housing estates were built for the workers, with health services and sports and cultural facilities. Most of the concrete was poured between 1946 and 1947, using aggregate delivered by two cable cars from a gravel pit in Pyrimont, downstream. Two spillways were built: an underground channel carrying per second and an open channel carrying per second, which joins the river over an impressive \\"ski jump\\". The dam handles water volumes that vary from over per second down to under per second depending on snow run-off volumes and rainfall. The hydroelectric station, wide by high, was designed for six main groups of turbines, each supplied with water by a vertical conduit. The dam was completed in late 1947, and after being impounded was filled on 19‚Äì20 January 1948 in under 36 hours. The power plant was connected to Lyon and Paris via high-voltage lines. The first turbine was started in March 1948, and the others between May 1948 and 1957. The crest of the dam supports a road, and can be crossed on foot or by car. By the end of 1949, G√©nissiat was the largest hydroelectric power plant in Europe. Between 1954 and 1961 the artery from G√©nissiat to Paris was upgraded in stages from 225 kv to 380 kv. A monument to the people who died during the dam's construction was consecrated in October 1995. It stands at the entrance to the G√©nissiat cemetery. The names show that workers came from Italy, Algeria and Poland to help in the construction.

While Kapoor, Patekar and Rawal have reprised their roles from the previous film, Abraham and Hassan are new additions to the lead cast. Made on a budget of ‚Çπ80 crore, the film was largely shot in and around Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Welcome Back was released worldwide on 4 September 2015. Plot Uday Shetty (Nana Patekar) and Majnu Pandey (Anil Kapoor) end a life of crime and become honest businessmen, settling in Dubai after being duped by Uday's brother-in-law Rajiv (Akshay Kumar). Two conwomen from India, Poonam (Dimple Kapadia) and Babita (Ankita Shrivastav), present themselves as Maharani Padmavati and Rajkumari Chandni of Najafgarh in order to con Uday and Majnu of their money. Babita causes the two men to fall in love with her, thus getting them to finance herself and Poonam's luxurious lifestyle. Later, it is revealed that Uday has another sister Ranjana (Shruti Haasan) from his father, Shankar Shetty's third marriage and Majnu and Uday are emotionally blackmailed by Uday's father into arranging the marriage of Ranjana and are also forced to do so as Poonam makes that one of her conditions for getting Babita married to either one of them. The movie then shifts to Rajiv's uncle, Dr. Ghunguroo (Paresh Rawal), who has found out that he has a step son from his wife's previous marriage that he was unaware of, Ajju (John Abraham). Unlike Rajiv, Ajju is a local goon of Mumbai, where Ranjana studies. Through a chain of hilarious events, they both fall in love with each other. Meanwhile, Majnu and Uday arrange the marriage of Ranjana with the step-son of Doctor Ghunguroo, not knowing that he is a goon. However, at the engagement ceremony, Majnu reveals the truth of Ajju, to which Ajju resists with a fight, threatening to marry Ranjana without any of the brothers' consent. In order to keep Ajju at bay, Uday and Majnu visit Wanted Bhai, (Naseeruddin Shah), who is an infamous blind don. They also return to their old, violent ways in order to kill Ajju. The brothers are shocked to find that Wanted's son Honey (Shiney Ahuja) likes Ranjana and would like to marry her. They decide to arrange the marriage of Ranjana to some other decent man, in order to sidestep Ajju as well as Wanted's son. However, due to Ajju and Dr. Ghunguroo, who are in league with Babita and Poonam, they are caught by Wanted Bhai, who summons them to his island. There, Ajju and Dr. Ghunguroo try to convince Honey that he no longer loves Ranjana and that Babita is his true love. Meanwhile, Uday and Majnu try to kill Ajju, but are frightened at the graveyard in a ghost act planned by Dr. Ghunguroo, Ajju and Ranjana. Unbeknownst to all of them, their activities have been recorded by closed-circuit television, causing Wanted Bhai and Honey to plan to finish them off. However, in a hilarious climax scene, Honey is kidnapped by all of them and they escape towards the desert where they are chased by Wanted Bhai. In the midst of saving himself, Dr. Ghunguroo pushes Wanted Bhai, causing him to faint. Meanwhile, a group of camels heavily march there. Ajju is successful in saving Wanted Bhai from the stampede of camels, and restoring his sight. Wanted Bhai himself, as a form of gratitude, arranges the marriage of Ajju with Ranjana, calling Ajju his 'second son'.

Critical reception Bollywood Hungama gave the film 3.5 stars out of and wrote, \\"if you enjoy slapstick comedy that defies logic and have enjoyed Welcome, then Welcome Back is surely a paisa vasool entertainer for you\\". Dhriti Sharma, writing for Zee News, stated, Welcome Back is vibrant and the ensemble cast keeps it gripping. The screenplay is brilliant, just a little bit of loops in editing in the first song. The comic flavour of the movie has been kept intact and the direction has been profoundly beaded into scenes\\". Ananya Bhattacharya from India Today gave it 3 stars out of 5 and wrote, \\"Welcome Back is quite the laugh riot that can de- stress you after the atrocities of the week. Leave the brains aside, and you have (at least) two hours of hardcore fun\\". Rohit Vats from Hindustan Times gave the film 2.5 out of 5 and wrote, \\"Welcome Back is funny in parts, but that Welcome fluidity is missing big time. There are moments but they are very limited in number. Welcome Back's pace is its biggest asset and that may make you enjoy this 153-minute long film\\". Deepanjana Pal from Firstpost wrote, \\"At 153 minutes, Welcome Back is just a shade too long and the ending is a sandstorm of stupidity. But you'll forgive Bazmee and gang because for at least 120 minutes, this comedy keeps you in splits. Welcome Back might be 2015's silliest film and this is the best reason to watch it\\". Shilpa Jamkhandikar, writing for Reuters, stated, \\"Welcome Back is sporadically funny, one that ebbs and flows; but it just about passes the 'guilty pleasure' test thanks to Kapoor and Patekar\\". Filmfare wrote, \\"watch the film if you like cornball comedies. It's a pure massy, masala entertainer that's good to go on a lazy weekend\\". Rediff's Raja Sen, while giving the film 2 stars out of 5, wrote, \\"Welcome Back is dumb yet entertaining, utterly silly but made with a kind of absurd, warm energy\\". Shubha Shetty-Saha from Mid-day called the film \\"a blazing example of the 'Leave your brains at home' variety\\" and \\"a fun watch which will keep you snorting and giggling even after you exit the theatre\\". Rajeev Masand for News 18 gave the film 2 stars out of 5 and wrote, It's Nana and Anil, in fact ‚Äì along with the impossibly gifted Paresh Rawal ‚Äì who're the real stars of this film, bringing so much manic energy and good- natured stupidity to a familiar, shopworn premise\\". Shubhra Gupta writing for The Indian Express gave the film 1.5 stars out of 5 and stated, Welcome had a welcome lightness in most of its steps. And it made us laugh. Welcome Back, minus Akshay and Katrina, plus John and Shruti, and Dimple and a new girl, and Naseer and Shiney, clomps about, looking for the laughs. And failing, mostly, to find them\\". Saibal Chatterjee from NDTV wrote, \\"nothing that this nonsensical action comedy unleashes, not even the in-form Anil Kapoor-Nana Patekar pair, can compensate for its absence of substance. Welcome Back...is as appealing as a dunk in a garbage dump\\". Livemint's Uday Bhatia wrote, \\"Over its cruelly prolonged 150-minute running time, Welcome Back treats human intellect with the sort of disdain that's remarkable even for Bollywood. It's not just that these are old gags; they've been repurposed so lazily that you can see the actors tiring of a scene even as they perform it\\".

The design of Plersch's sculptures refers to some extent to the so-called \\"School of Lviv\\" in sculpture. A symbolic tombstone of Governor Jan Tar≈Ço in the church portal of the Jesuit Church, Warsaw (destroyed during World War II, merged and reconstructed in 2010) is comparable to the best achievements of the 18th century European sculpture, both in terms of content and execution. Other important works by Plersch include the Marriage of Maria and the pulpit for the Carmelite Church, Warsaw, and sculpture from the upper floor of the facade of the Church of the Visitation of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Warsaw, renovated in 2009. That included Elizabeth and Mary from the scene of the Visitation and Saint Joseph, Saint Joachim and Saint Anne, and Zechariah. He also produced some works for the Holy Cross Church, Warsaw and St. Martin's Church, Warsaw.

Although the early 1990s were a period of great violence in Turkey due to the Kurdish‚ÄìTurkish conflict, 1993 saw a series of suspicious deaths: of President Turgut √ñzal, leading military figures, and journalists. Particularly in the context of the Ergenekon trials from 2008 onwards and related investigations into the Turkish deep state and the suspicious deaths from this period, claims of a \\"covert coup\\" intended to prevent a peace settlement (and to protect the covert relationships between the Turkish military, intelligence services including JITEM, Counter-Guerrilla, certain Kurdish groups including Kurdish Hizbollah, and the Turkish mafia) have been made. Fikri Saƒülar, a former member of the parliamentary commission which investigated the Susurluk scandal which first began to shed light on the Turkish deep state, is one who has made such claims, describing \\"a covert military coup\\".Today's Zaman, 26 April 2011, Saƒülar says he does not understand nomination of Ergenekon suspects.

In addition to the assassination of key figures supporting a peace process, several massacres took place in 1993, which it is claimed were intended as part of an alleged \\"strategy of tension\\". These include the May 24, 1993 PKK ambush, and the Sivas and Ba≈übaƒülar massacres in early July. Overview In the early 1990s, President Turgut √ñzal agreed to negotiations with the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), the events of the 1991 Gulf War having changed some of the geopolitical dynamics in the region. Apart from √ñzal, himself half-Kurdish, few Turkish politicians were interested in a peace process, nor was more than a part of the PKK itself.en.internationalism.org, 10 April 2013, Internationalism is the only response to the Kurdish issue.

With the PKK's ceasefire declaration in hand, √ñzal was planning to propose a major pro-Kurdish reform package at the next meeting of the National Security Council. The president's death on 17 April led to the postponement of that meeting, and the plans were never presented.Michael M.

Former PKK commander ≈ûemdin Sakƒ±k maintains the attack was part of the Doƒüu √áalƒ±≈üma Grubu's coup plans. Under the new Presidency of S√ºleyman Demirel and Premiership of Tansu √áiller, the Castle Plan (to use any and all means to solve the Kurdish question using violence), which √ñzal had opposed, was enacted, and the peace process abandoned. Further massacres (notably the Sivas massacre and Ba≈übaƒülar massacre in early July) and assassinations ensured that the peace process was well and truly buried.

Jan was one of the most powerful and influential magnates in Poland during the 18th century. He was the owner of 12 cities, 257 villages, 17 palaces and two primeval forests. In 1726, he built the Branicki Palace, the \\"Versailles of Podlasie\\". He also laid out the central part of the town of Bia≈Çystok with its triangular market.

C. Shanmughadas (5 January 1939 ‚Äì 27 June 2013) was an Indian politician. He was Kerala MLA for Balussery from 1970 until 2006. Early life Aniyeri Cheenan Shanmughadas was born on 5 January 1939 in Dharmadom near Thalassery, Kannur district, as the son of Cheenan Kunjiraman and Aniyeri Vengilatt Saradamma. After completing school education, he started college education in Kottakkal Arya Vaidya Sala College. Like most of the politicians in India, he also started his political career through campus politics. He was one of the founding members of Kerala Students Union (KSU). After completing his college education, he became an active politician. He also participated in the Goa Liberation Struggle in 1961. Political life Shanmughadas was first elected from Balussery constituency in 1970. He later went to get elected for seven times consecutively from the same constituency - from 1980 to 2006. He served as minister thrice - all in the governments headed by E. K. Nayanar. In the first Nayanar ministry which came in 1980, he was the minister for Health, Employment & Sports. He resigned his post on 16 October 1981, when his party, along with Kerala Congress (M) and Kerala Congress (B), withdrew the support for the ministry, which resulted in the fall of Nayanar ministry. In the second and third Nayanar ministries, which came in 1987 and 1991 respectively, he got the same portfolios as in the first ministry (with the exception of employment). From 1982 to 1999, he was the legislative leader of the party. Shanmughadas served as the State Secretary of K.S.U. and Indian Youth Congress during 1966-69 period, with A. K. Antony as the President. He briefly served as the secretary of Malappuram district Congress Committee, and later served as the President of Kozhikode from 1973 to 1978. When Congress party was split in 1978, he joined the faction led by D. Devaraj Urs, called Indian Congress (Socialist) a.k.a. Congress (S). He later stood firmly with Left Democratic Front until his death. When Congress (S) was split in 1986, he joined the faction headed by Sarat Chandra Sinha. It was this faction which led to the formation of Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) headed by Sharad Pawar in 1999. When this party was formed, a rift occurred, and Shanmughadas, then the state cabinet minister of Kerala, resigned his post. His colleague V. C. Kabeer, then the member from Ottapalam legislative constituency, and the member of a faction which continued to be known as Congress (S), succeeded him. Shanmughadas was also the Chairman of KANFED and a member of Kerala Granthasala Sangham and Kozhikode Regional Transport Authority. He also served as the editor of various weeklies like 'Dharmachakra', 'Yuvatha' and 'Nireekshanam' weeklies. During his last days, he worked as the state President of NCP. Death Shanmughadas died of a cardiac arrest on 27 June 2013 at the age of 74.Former minister Shanmughadas passes away He was not keeping good health for a while, due to various problems like diabetes, hypertension and high cholestrol. He also suffered from cirrhosis and heart disease. On the day of his death, he conducted a memorial programme in memory of his political mentor C. K. Govindan Nair, and collapsed while speaking. He was immediately rushed to Kozhikode Medical College Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 9:15 PM. Shanmughadas was cremated with full state honours at his home premises the next day.

These goals are accomplished by dynamically selecting the best algorithms to use at runtime, clean API, and multiple interfaces. EJML is free, written in 100% Java and has been released under an Apache v2.0 license. EJML has three distinct ways to interact with it: 1) procedural, 2) SimpleMatrix, and 3) Equations. Procedure provides all capabilities of EJML and almost complete control over memory creation, speed, and specific algorithms. SimpleMatrix provides a simplified subset of the core capabilities in an easy to use flow styled object-oriented API, inspired by Jama. Equations is a symbolic interface, similar in spirit to Matlab and other CAS, that provides a compact way of writing equations.

The standard was originally published jointly by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission(IEC) in 2005 and then revised in 2013. It details requirements for establishing, implementing, maintaining and continually improving an information security management system (ISMS) ‚Äì the aim of which is to help organizations make the information assets they hold more secure. A European update of the standard was published in 2017. Organizations that meet the standard's requirements can choose to be certified by an accredited certification body following successful completion of an audit. How the standard works Most organizations have a number of information security controls. However, without an information security management system (ISMS), controls tend to be somewhat disorganized and disjointed, having been implemented often as point solutions to specific situations or simply as a matter of convention. Security controls in operation typically address certain aspects of information technology (IT) or data security specifically; leaving non-IT information assets (such as paperwork and proprietary knowledge) less protected on the whole. Moreover, business continuity planning and physical security may be managed quite independently of IT or information security while Human Resources practices may make little reference to the need to define and assign information security roles and responsibilities throughout the organization. ISO/IEC 27001 requires that management: * Systematically examine the organization's information security risks, taking account of the threats, vulnerabilities, and impacts; * Design and implement a coherent and comprehensive suite of information security controls and/or other forms of risk treatment (such as risk avoidance or risk transfer) to address those risks that are deemed unacceptable; and * Adopt an overarching management process to ensure that the information security controls continue to meet the organization's information security needs on an ongoing basis. Note that ISO/IEC 27001 is designed to cover much more than just IT. What controls will be tested as part of certification to ISO/IEC 27001 is dependent on the certification auditor. This can include any controls that the organisation has deemed to be within the scope of the ISMS and this testing can be to any depth or extent as assessed by the auditor as needed to test that the control has been implemented and is operating effectively. Management determines the scope of the ISMS for certification purposes and may limit it to, say, a single business unit or location. The ISO/IEC 27001 certificate does not necessarily mean the remainder of the organization, outside the scoped area, has an adequate approach to information security management. Other standards in the ISO/IEC 27000 family of standards provide additional guidance on certain aspects of designing, implementing and operating an ISMS, for example on information security risk management (ISO/IEC 27005). History of ISO/IEC 27001 BS 7799 was a standard originally published by BSI Group in 1995. It was written by the United Kingdom Government's Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), and consisted of several parts. The first part, containing the best practices for information security management, was revised in 1998; after a lengthy discussion in the worldwide standards bodies, it was eventually adopted by ISO as ISO/IEC 17799, \\"Information Technology - Code of practice for information security management.\\" in 2000. ISO/IEC 17799 was then revised in June 2005 and finally incorporated in the ISO 27000 series of standards as ISO/IEC 27002 in July 2007. The second part of BS7799 was first published by BSI in 1999, known as BS 7799 Part 2, titled \\"Information Security Management Systems - Specification with guidance for use.\\" BS 7799-2 focused on how to implement an Information security management system (ISMS), referring to the information security management structure and controls identified in BS 7799-2. This later became ISO/IEC 27001:2005. BS 7799 Part 2 was adopted by ISO as ISO/IEC 27001 in November 2005. BS 7799 Part 3 was published in 2005, covering risk analysis and management. It aligns with ISO/IEC 27001:2005. Very little reference or use is made to any of the BS standards in connection with ISO/IEC 27001. Certification An ISMS may be certified compliant with ISO/IEC 27001 by a number of Accredited Registrars worldwide. Certification against any of the recognized national variants of ISO/IEC 27001 (e.g. JIS Q 27001, the Japanese version) by an accredited certification body is functionally equivalent to certification against ISO/IEC 27001 itself. In some countries, the bodies that verify conformity of management systems to specified standards are called \\"certification bodies\\", while in others they are commonly referred to as \\"registration bodies\\", \\"assessment and registration bodies\\", \\"certification/ registration bodies\\", and sometimes \\"registrars\\". The ISO/IEC 27001 certification,The ISO/IEC 27001 Certification Process. like other ISO management system certifications, usually involves a three-stage external audit process defined by the ISO/IEC 17021ISO/IEC 17021. and ISO/IEC 27006ISO/IEC 27006. standards: * Stage 1 is a preliminary, informal review of the ISMS, for example checking the existence and completeness of key documentation such as the organization's information security policy, Statement of Applicability (SoA) and Risk Treatment Plan (RTP). This stage serves to familiarize the auditors with the organization and vice versa. * Stage 2 is a more detailed and formal compliance audit, independently testing the ISMS against the requirements specified in ISO/IEC 27001. The auditors will seek evidence to confirm that the management system has been properly designed and implemented, and is in fact in operation (for example by confirming that a security committee or similar management body meets regularly to oversee the ISMS). Certification audits are usually conducted by ISO/IEC 27001 Lead Auditors. Passing this stage results in the ISMS being certified compliant with ISO/IEC 27001. * Ongoing involves follow- up reviews or audits to confirm that the organization remains in compliance with the standard. Certification maintenance requires periodic re-assessment audits to confirm that the ISMS continues to operate as specified and intended. These should happen at least annually but (by agreement with management) are often conducted more frequently, particularly while the ISMS is still maturing. Structure of the standard The official title of the standard is \\"Information technology ‚Äî Security techniques ‚Äî Information security management systems ‚Äî Requirements\\" ISO/IEC 27001:2013 has ten short clauses, plus a long annex, which cover: :1. Scope of the standard :2. How the document is referenced :3. Reuse of the terms and definitions in ISO/IEC 27000 :4. Organizational context and stakeholders :5. Information security leadership and high-level support for policy :6. Planning an information security management system; risk assessment; risk treatment :7. Supporting an information security management system : 8. Making an information security management system operational :9. Reviewing the system's performance :10. Corrective action :Annex A: List of controls and their objectives This structure mirrors other management standards such as ISO 22301 (business continuity management) and this helps organizations comply with multiple management systems standards if they wish. Annexes B and C of 27001:2005 have been removed. Controls Clause 6.1.3 describes how an organization can respond to risks with a risk treatment plan; an important part of this is choosing appropriate controls. A very important change in ISO/IEC 27001:2013 is that there is now no requirement to use the Annex A controls to manage the information security risks. The previous version insisted (\\"shall\\") that controls identified in the risk assessment to manage the risks must have been selected from Annex A. Thus almost every risk assessment ever completed under the old version of ISO/IEC 27001 used Annex A controls but an increasing number of risk assessments in the new version do not use Annex A as the control set. This enables the risk assessment to be simpler and much more meaningful to the organization and helps considerably with establishing a proper sense of ownership of both the risks and controls. This is the main reason for this change in the new version. There are 114 controls in 14 groups and 35 control categories; the 2005 standard had 133 controls in 11 groups. :A.5: Information security policies (2 controls) :A.6: Organization of information security (7 controls) :A.7: Human resource security - 6 controls that are applied before, during, or after employment :A.8: Asset management (10 controls) :A.9: Access control (14 controls) :A.10: Cryptography (2 controls) :A.11: Physical and environmental security (15 controls) :A.12: Operations security (14 controls) :A.13: Communications security (7 controls) :A.14: System acquisition, development and maintenance (13 controls) :A.15: Supplier relationships (5 controls) :A.16: Information security incident management (7 controls) :A.17: Information security aspects of business continuity management (4 controls) :A.18: Compliance; with internal requirements, such as policies, and with external requirements, such as laws (8 controls) The controls reflect changes to technology affecting many organizations‚Äîfor instance, cloud computing‚Äîbut as stated above it is possible to use and be certified to ISO/IEC 27001:2013 and not use any of these controls.

Biography Webb was born on 9 July 1850 in Monmouth. He was the son of Thomas Webb (born 1812) and Hannah Edwards.Varrall family records He graduated from the Monmouth Grammar School and entered St John's College, Cambridge in 1868.

He produced memorable lectures on the theory of elasticity. Students recalled that \\"jokes were repeated\\", seasoning his lectures with \\"attic salt\\", though they \\"retained their freshness\\".

The case and the legal principles it affirmed have been described as opening up the secret world of tribunals and National Health Service secure units, and as having substantial ramifications for mental health professionals and solicitors, though how frequently patients will be willing or able to exercise the right is not yet clear.Secrecy of tribunals challenged by Broadmoor patient‚Äôs hearing Mental Health Practice, Colin Parish, November 2011 (Full Text ) The detention of Haines under the Mental Health Act had been continuous since 1986, mainly at Broadmoor Hospital run by West London Mental Health NHS Trust. The tribunal panel ultimately decided there were sufficient grounds for continued psychiatric detention but recommended better collaborative work towards psychiatric rehabilitation and gradual supported pathways to lower security then release to community mental health services.Broadmoor patient Albert Haines loses appeal bid The Independent, Jerome Taylor, 26 October 2011 Legal process =Gaining the right= Haines's request for his mental health tribunal to be fully open to the public was first made in 2009 but was turned down twice by the First-tier Tribunal. The justification for the refusal included claims that: Haines's primary intention was to air 'subjective grievances'; his evidence would not be 'objectively sensible'; he would be more difficult to control; the public would not be accurately informed; and the cost and the risk to the patient's health and conduct were disproportionate to any possible benefits.Open justice - the future of mental health tribunals AH v West London Mental Health Trust 17.02.11, Kennedys Law LLP, 28 March 2011 In 2010 the Upper Tribunal ruled that the First Tier had erred in law, having not correctly identified or applied the principles it should have. In effect it had failed to uphold the fundamental principle that open justice is a right and it is the exceptions that must be justified, rather than vice versa. In addition to such a principle in common law, under Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights (Right to a fair trial), reinforced by the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (Article 13 Access to justice), detained psychiatric patients have the same right as non-disabled detainees to have their case heard in public, provided they are mentally capable of giving informed consent for their right to patient confidentiality to be waived.Open and Shut: When a detained patient applies to the tribunal, there might have to be a public hearing Sallie Harrington, Associate, Weightmans solicitors, March 2011A Clinician's Brief Guide to the Mental Health Act (2012) Zigmond, T. RCPsych Publications. Mr H case Pgs 86/87.First Tier Tribunal Public Hearings Explained: The Haines Case ‚Äì Analysis . Written on 23 May 2013 by Farida Peregrino-Brimah, Trainee Solicitor with Blavo & CO's. The Upper Tribunal therefore set aside the First Tier's decision, and was then at liberty to substitute its own decision. A short hearing was held for that purpose in February 2011, taking testimony from Broadmoor staff and Haines by video link. The panel concluded there was a sufficient rationale in Haines's case to grant an open appeal hearing, and that this was not offset by possible risks or extra costs. Broadmoor Hospital, run by West London Mental Health NHS Trust since 2001, had fought the decision. =Engaging in the hearing= The appeal hearing itself, the first ever to be open to the public and media, commenced in September 2011 in central London and lasted for two days. Mr Haines's consultant psychiatrist, Dr Jose Romero-Urcelay, was cross-examined for one day. Haines's ward clinical nurse manager, social worker and hospital 'independent' patient advocate also testified. Haines himself submitted a written report and testified for 20 minutes. Evidence was also heard from an independent social worker and from Albert Haines's brother Leigh, who was offering to house and support him should he be released. The decision was that Haines should not yet be released, even conditionally to a lower security facility. The reasons for the decision were published two weeks later, for the first time ever and contrary to a written representation submitted on behalf of Haines.Patient remains detained as Mental Health Tribunal publishes ruling for the first time Local Government Lawyer, 26 October 2011 Mental health tribunal publishes first-ever panel ruling PA Media Lawyer 27 October 2011 The three-member panel headed by Judge McGregor-Johnson, Honorary Recorder, concluded that under the Mental Health Act Mr Haines was still considered to have a mental disorder of a nature or degree to justify detention in hospital for treatment, and that he still presented a sufficient risk to others and himself. However, Broadmoor Hospital staff were urged to find a way to better engage with Haines, even if that meant starting treatment on his own terms, and to put a clear pathway in place so that Haines could see an acceptable way to progress to lower security facilities and eventual release. Haines's solicitor, Kate Luscombe of the firm Duncan Lewis, said her client had received fair public support, had been able to air his grievances, and had followed the proceedings appropriately throughout; however she said Haines was disappointed at the final judgements and questioned whether his treatment over 25 years had promoted his rehabilitation. A spokesperson for West London NHS stated they were pleased the hearing was over due to the burden it being public put on the hospital's resources, that they thought the verdict agreed that Broadmoor was the best treatment environment presently, but that they would continue to seek ways to engage Haines in treatment. Albert Haines's sister Denise, however, stated that she believed Albert cannot get the kind of help he needs at Broadmoor and fears he won't come out alive.Family fears Broadmoor patient Albert Haines will die in custody BBC News, 26 October 2011 Personal background The legal process made extensive reference to Haines's life as a child and adult, and he was the focus of some national press coverage which included personal interviews.Broadmoor patient fighting for right to tell his story The Independent, Jerome Taylor, 23 September 2011 Born in 1959 in Hammersmith, London, Albert Haines suffered neglect and abuse from a young age. He was put in residential care for many years, as were his three sisters and two brothers. A mental health assessment at just five years of age described him as 'emotionally maladjusted'. He was sexually and physically abused. After leaving residential homes once an adult, Haines stayed in hostels, bedsits or on the streets. He drank alcohol and took cannabis, cocaine and amphetamines. He was convicted of criminal damage in 1979 and in 1980 for possession of an offensive weapon. He was in and out of psychiatric hospitals. In May 1986 while a patient of the Maudsley Hospital run by South London and Maudsley NHS Trust, Haines went in carrying a machete and a small knife. There is some disagreement between media reports as to whether he threatened staff and gave himself up, or tried to attack a member of staff but was prevented. No one was physically hurt. Later that year he pleaded guilty to attempted wounding. Rather than being sentenced to prison, he was sent to Broadmoor high secure psychiatric hospital for treatment under the Mental Health Act. In 1992 Haines was transferred to the medium secure Three Bridges Unit in Ealing, London, also now run by West London Mental Health NHS Trust. While there he made successful visits out of hospital and worked in catering without incident, but after a confrontation with hospital staff involving being put in seclusion after brandishing a fire extinguisher and climbing onto the roof, he was returned to Broadmoor in 2008. Psychiatric context According to the tribunal, Albert Haines was long diagnosed with a personality disorder - meaning an enduring and pervasive difficulty that developed by at least adolescence/early adulthood and which especially affects social interaction. The panel noted that several psychiatric reports have concluded that Haines demonstrates features of either emotionally unstable personality disorder and/or antisocial personality disorder. They also referred to childhood conduct disorder being demonstrated by his historical records. References were also made to 'psychopathic disorder', a legal category in the Mental Health Act 1983 which could cover any persistent mental disorder if it appeared to lead (in the individual case) to abnormally aggressive or irresponsible conduct; the category was abolished by amendments in the Mental Health Act 2007 which came into force in 2008. A separate political-administrative category of \\"Dangerous and Severe Personality Disorder\\" had been introduced in the UK from the turn of the 21st century, and one of four DSPD units nationwide is at Broadmoor Hospital although it is not clear whether Haines is being considered under this category. According to the tribunal, Mr Haines was also long found to have a mental illness in addition to underlying personality disorder, but in 2008 was rediagnosed as having a personality disorder only. Dr Romero-Urcelay of Broadmoor testified that Haines does suffer from a psychotic illness with specific persecutory delusions, at least since he was returned to Broadmoor from Three Bridges in 2008 and refused to accept any treatment from them. Other psychiatrists have not concluded that he has a psychotic illness at all, while others have gone further in concluding that he has a generalised psychosis which meets the criteria for schizoaffective disorder. At his hearing, Haines disputed the diagnoses of personality disorder and psychosis, although he accepted that he had difficulties. He refused to accept the type of treatment offered by Broadmoor even if any release or step-down in security was conditional on it. He said that as a vulnerable young man he had looked to the experts for help but had been given multiple diagnoses, forced medication and incarceration. He said that trauma from his childhood abuse hadn't been properly recognised or reported for 25 years and that non-directive counselling had never been offered despite his asking for it ever since he could remember.

Any previous full-time service in the Regular Army did not count, although service in other volunteer, territorial or auxiliary forces could be counted, provided that five years immediately preceding the award were served with the Militia. Breaks of service of under one year were allowed. In 1906 eligibility was extended by Royal Warrant to certain militia forces overseas, including Bermuda and Malta. The medal ceased to be awarded when, as part of the Haldane Reforms, the Militia was abolished and replaced by the Special Reserve on 1 April 1908. The Special Reserve Long Service and Good Conduct Medal was then introduced for service in the new force. The Militia Long Service Medal was again awarded from 1921 when, as part of the reform of part-time forces, the Special Reserve again became the Militia, being restructured in 1924 as a Supplementary Reserve providing specialist technical support to the Regular Army. The Militia Long Service Medal was finally superseded by the Efficiency Medal with bar \\"Militia\\" in 1930. Awards were published in Army Orders, with a total of 1,587 medals awarded: 1,446 bearing the effigy of King Edward VII, (awarded 1904‚Äì1908); and 141 with that of George V, (awarded 1921‚Äì1930). In terms of unit, the following were conferred: Royal Garrison Artillery: 341; Royal Engineers: 15; Royal Engineer Submarine Miners: 8; Infantry: 988; Channel Islands (Jersey and Guernsey): 89; Malta: 131; Bermuda:15. Appearance The Militia Long Service and Good Conduct Medal is an oval shaped silver medal with a fixed ring suspender at the top, of the following design: The obverse depicts the bust of the King in uniform facing left. Originally Edward VII was shown, with the legend, EDWARDVS VII REX IMPERATOR. In 1911 the image was changed to that of George V, the legend reading GEORGIVS V BRITT: OMN: REX ET IND: IMP:. The reverse bears the words MILITIA FOR LONG SERVICE AND GOOD CONDUCT. The medal hangs from a 32 mm light blue ribbon threaded through the top ring suspender. The recipient's service number, rank, name, and unit were impressed on the edge of the medal.

He was later ordained as priest on 2 June 2001, and served for three years in the Province of Ja√©n in Spain, with a desire to be posted to a ministry in an Arabic region afterwards. This was following a visit to the Sahara area as a student. Western Sahara Upon the completion of the Ja√©n posting, he moved to the Sahara region and began to learn Arabic, French and English in order to better serve his parishioners. When he first arrived in the area, he was taken for a walk by Fr. Acacio Valbuena Rodr√≠guez and told \\"these are your parishioners, all Muslims. Being with them is what you have to do\\". On 24 June 2013, he was appointed by Pope Francis as Apostolic prefect of Western Sahara, prefecture of which he had been the administrator since the resignation of Rodr√≠guez in 2009. He took possession of the position on 29 September, at a celebration at St. Francis of Assisi Cathedral, Laayoune. Dorado is the third Apostolic prefect of the region, following Rodr√≠guez and F√©lix Erviti Barcelona.

Career  Known for a \\"distinct and gutsy\\" raw brute force that combines archetypal historic and psychological themes together with diverse, often opposing dance techniques, Spiegelschrift's choreographic \\"punk rock ballet - just !@#$ the ballet part!\\" projects have often involved collaborations and performances with many musicians from diverse genres and styles including Rhea's Obsession, Malhavoc, cellist Elinor Frey, as well as Ashley MacIsaac & the Paper Boys for the CBC duMaurier Concert Stage. A collaboration with filmmaker Justin Stephenson in the early 1990s resulted in several experimental dance films such as \\"five short movements\\" (1993) and \\"Tabulae Anatomicae Sex\\" (1995). Since 2004 Spiegelschrift's works have featured dancer Karen Rose (dancer). = 1989-1995 = Spiegelschrift moved to Toronto in 1989 for the dance program at Claude Watson School for the Arts at Earl Haig High School but dropped out 2 months later after attending the live presentation of Gerhard Bohner's revision (1977) of Oskar Schlemmer‚Äôs \\"Triadisches Ballett\\" (1922), ending his formal dance education. Initial choreographic works were often created for erotic dance performers and club kids presented alongside Toronto fashion designer Honey Garlic's Alternative Fashion Shows at RPM(The Government) and The Boom Boom Room before expanding to site specific and more traditional venue presentations. Often billed as the \\"Royal Bad Ass Ballet\\" Spiegelschrift created THEVARS as a working ensemble name for the dance theatre projects in 1991. Creations during this period include: \\"Young Man Intrigued by the Flight of the Non-Euclidean Fly\\" (1992) inspired by the same titled Max Ernst painting this solo was premiered at the opening of the Acrobat - 1221 Bay Street, Toronto along with follow Canadian performers such as Jaymz Bee and Kiki Bonbon. The stylized fractured poses simulating Giorgio de Chirico figures contrasted with rapid fluid porte bras and multi-revolution turns and jumps would be used again in the short dance film \\"five short movements\\" (1993) collaboration with film maker Justin Stephenson. The dance film, still one of Spiegelschrift's favourite works, matched the choreography with Stephenson's multimedia editing and animation effects. The contrasting Butoh influenced solo \\"Icarus:landed\\"'(1993) was presented at Circle Ball Fair as a contrasting second part to \\"Young Man...\\" set to live accompaniment of cellist Hayley MacLean. The elemental duets \\"Fire and Water - Duet #7\\" (1993) and \\"Luft und Erde - Duet #11\\" - Air and Earth (1994) developed and performed with Sonya Biernath and Nichole LaRochelle respectively were created as street performances for the Circle Ball Fair Street Festival Toronto. Both would be adapted for more traditional theatrical presentations such as the 8:08 Dance series (Toronto) and Dancing on the Edge (Vancouver). Fire and Water was filmed for Justin Stephenson's \\"Nearly home\\" (1994) and Luft und Erde in \\"Tabulae Anatomicae Sex\\" (1995) featuring the music of Rhea's Obsession. The natural migration to experimental dance films and performances with musical groups allowed accessibility to non traditional dance presentation venues and broadcasts throughout Canada and Internationally. = 1996-2006 = Disenchanted after the collapse of several production developments due to funding and management issues, Spiegelschrift would withdraw from larger products to sporadically present intimate works. As a refreshing change he started teaching social dancing at Dancing on King before creating studios1.ca as a resource for his classes. During this period Spiegelschrift spent time in Ireland researching. Highlights include the 1996 collaboration with Irish step dancer Michael Patrick Farrell to create and star in a contemporary/Irish step dance fusion work for the CBC Television duMaurier Concert Stage (Vancouver) performed with Ashley MacIsaac & the Paper Boys and the live performance of \\"Eat Me - Duet #14\\" (1996) with industrial metal band Malhavoc to their same titled track. Produced by Leesa Berry, the \\"eccentric\\" Spiegelschrift choreographed a chronological tribute to burlesque dancing, \\"Grynde Haus\\" (1999) . Utilizing a mixture of contemporary dancers with erotic performers and the musical accompaniment of Tyler Yarema & His Rhythm the performance at The Opera House (Toronto) was hosted by Adrian and featured Miss Joa, the Dangerettes, Ottilie Mason, Nichole LaRochelle and DJ Aki. \\"Tang√≥ na dTuaitin√≠ Uimh. 4\\" - The Bogmen's Tango #4 (2005) : for bickering couple and marching band was premiered with dancer Karen Rose at the River Run Centre in Guelph with the Guelph Concert Band.

The collaboration with cellist Elinor Fry, \\"he misses her\\" (2007) was presented at the CAMMAC faculty concert at Lake Field College.

In the 17th and 18th centuries it became one of the most important haciendas in the nation and has been declared a Historical Monument by the INAH. Coordinaci√≥n Nacional de Monumentos Hist√≥ricos - INAHLas Haciendas de Morelos, Alfonso Toussaint History = Pre-Hispanic era = Located in the municipality of Yautepec, in the state of Morelos, San Jose Cocoyoc is now a former estate, which after 1960 was restored and adapted to house an extensive hacienda resort. The known history of San Jose Cocoyoc goes back to the times of the Nahua tribes and xochimilcas tlahuicas, occupied the valleys and Huaxtepec Cuauhn√°huac. According to Peter Gerhard, tlahuicas occupied the western part of the region (which extended to Malinalco) and its most important political center was Cuauhn√°huac. The xochimilcas were located in the center and in the eastern part. Yauhtpec formed states, Yacapixtlan, Tepuztl√°n, Ocuituco and Huaxtepec, the latter being the head of the other dependent. The tlahuicas and xochimilcas formed an agricultural society. They cultivated the fertile valley lands, raised turkeys and dogs escuintles and were engaged in hunting, fishing and gathering. The main food crops that were planted were corn, beans, various vegetables, fruits and grains, such as chili, pumpkin, squash, tomato, and cocoa. In hot areas the main crop was cotton. His social and political organization was similar to that of other peoples of the Central Highlands. They were grouped in local states (tlatocayotl), which in turn depended on the political and administrative centers and Huaxtepec Cuauhn√°huac. The Mexica domination over the region began in the late 14th century, when Acamapichtli able to submit to the lordship of Cuauhn√°huac. Apparently Mexica lords felt the imperative to achieve mastery of this region to meet their expectations of having the cotton they needed to make their clothing, which was grown in this region. According to some sources, Mr. Mexica Huitzilihuitl, eager to have cotton grown in Morelos, asked for the hand of Miahuaxihuitl, daughter Ozomatzinteuctli (Tezcacohuatzin Itzcoatzin or, according to other sources), lord of Cuernavaca and Miyauaxiuitl, woman Toltec origin. To be denied recourse to war, achieving Cuauhn√°huac subject Mr. and marry his daughter. From this union was born llhuicamina Moctezuma, who years later in his capacity as Mexican emperor, he developed a great appreciation for the fertile lands of their ancestors. =Colonial era = When completing the conquest of Tenochtitlan in 1521, Cort√©s immediately showed a decided preference for the territory of the current state of Morelos. He founded the city of Cuernavaca, in the Indian village of Cuauhn√°huac, and established his residence in this city. Some years later, King Charles I of Spain would grant him immense dominion over property, under the name of Marquis del Valle, covering territories in the states of Oaxaca, Guerrero, Morelos and the Federal District itself.Isabel Moctezuma, the last Aztec princess, Sara Garcia Knowing the demand that existed in Spain and in the rest of Europe, for refined sugar, Cort√©s introduced the cultivation of this plant, establishing a mill in the valley of Cuernavaca, which would be the second of its kind in New Spain. Soon discover that the land of this valley offered the best conditions for growing sugar cane and to the establishment of mills or mills, which required the existing streams abundant in this area. In the example of the Marqu√©s del Valle, and under the land grants given by the king and the perpetual censuses granted by Hern√°n Cort√©s and his descendants, in the second half of the 16th century and early 17th centuries, emerged in this area countless mills or mills.Las Haciendas colinial sugar of the time, Gisela Von Woebeser With respect to San Jos√© Cocoyoc, the sources placed the formation of the mill and the farm in the early 17th century. In this sense that mention is made in these years was granted a perpetual census Isabel Ruiz and Francisco Bernal, for middle ground in Guajoyuca cavalry (who later would be attached to Cocoyoc). Also mentioned that \\"the June 22, 1619 Francisco de Sequera was licensed to transform the mill he had in terms of Cocoyoque, on the way passing by Guastepec\\" The truth is that, according to research by Gisela Von Woebeser, around the sugar plantations of Morelos, was Admiral Pedro de Izaguirre who established the Finance and San Jos√© Cocoyoc mill in the second decade of the 17th century, to acquire and Guanacastitl√°n Tlacomille grounds that belonged to Francisco de Sequera cavalry property that belonged to the clerk of Cuautla Men√© P√©rez Solis, and land belonging to Diego Ferralde, who had in turn purchased the Convent Santo Domingo de Oaxtepec. Additionally, Admiral Izaguirre had made a valuable acquisition, buying the Indian chieftain Maria Cantia, Xalmile property, which included a dam, and an aqueduct apantle that allowed water to bring Tecuaque Canyon. At the death of Izaguirre, the estate would be inherited by his widow, Mrs. Nicolasa de Izaguirre, while in the year of 1655 we know that belonged to Catherine de Ordaz, who in that year lost a lawsuit against the friars of San Hip√≥lito, owners of neighboring Hacienda del Hospital. It will be in the 18th century that San Jos√© Cocoyoc achieved a remarkable growth and development, becoming one of the most successful sugar companies in the region. Between the years of 1711 and 1714, Cocoyoc will record a major expansion with the annexation of the neighboring ranch Pantitl√°n. Links With An agrarian past: the Hotel Hacienda Cocoyoc estate and four centuries of continuity and change, Douglas Murphy =Sugar crisis= Throughout the colonial period, the activity of the sugar estates was subject to instability affecting its operation. In the late 16th century the Crown banned all exports of sugar from New Spain, which determined that all production was reoriented to the domestic market. Similarly, in 1714, the Crown banned the production of brandy, a product that was an important part of the economy of Wits. Like other branches of production, sugar production in the 18th century suffered the consequences of overproduction coupled with low product demand, causing the price drop and the consequent crisis for estates. Over the next century the estate Cocoyoc came among the twelve plantations major sugar producing country around the early 19th century and its importance grew with the installation of new machinery and a waterwheel in sugar refinery bringing water sources neighbors by an aqueduct that is still under served. =19th century= In 1785, the estate was acquired by the enabler of mine, Antonio Velasco de la Torre, while in 1801 it was inherited by his son, Antonio Velasco de la Torre, with whom he began a period of expansion. Velasco obtained a loan of 30,000 pesos for improvements to the property and in the year of 1823 introduced coffee cultivation. Known as the \\"coffee Velasco\\", would be very well accepted in the region and Mexico City itself. On the death of Antonio, the estate was inherited by his three daughters, Margaret, Josefa and Guadalupe, who nevertheless fail to have the success that his father had made and end up losing the property for debt, fronts the landowner of the region John Goribar, who is in turn the owner of the neighboring ranch Casasano. It is at this time that the estate is visited by Frances Inglis Elskine Calderon de la Barca, who makes an interesting description of it. After the death of John Goribar, the estate was inherited by his son Jesus Goribar, who in 1875 sold it to Isidoro de la Torre, who in turn was the owner of the neighboring estates of St. Charles Borromeo and St. Nicholas Pantitl√°n. Years later, the property would be inherited by his son Tomas de la Torre, who must suffer the dissolution and disappearance of the Treasury, before the land redistribution that takes place as a result of the Mexican Revolud√≥n, which will enable the creation of 13 ejidos. As was common in these cases, following the implementation of agrarian reform, the hull of the property was abandoned, until 1957, when a real estate entrepreneur, Mr. Paulino Rivera Torres, acquired, starting from the time its restoration and empowerment, with a view to creating an original farm was to be resort that opened in 1967 and remains offering this served to date.The Sugar Hacienda Morelos, Irving Reynoso, Jaime =Madame Calderon de la Barca in San Jose Cocoyoc= In February 1841, Ms. Frances Erskine Inglis Calderon de la Barca, as part of a long journey through the countryside and villages in the center of the Mexican Republic, visit the Hacienda San Jos√© Cocoyoc and write a short story and excited about the impression that causes this visit. Madame Calderon de la Barca was attended by Juan Goribar, owner of the estate, who Ilevo to know the most representative of his estate as the mill, coffee grinder and liquor factory. But what impact this British visitors were the orange, with about three thousand trees, fruit trees, the many streams and flowers. In his account exclaims excitedly that \\"I had never seen a sight so beautiful\\". Through his story, Madame Calderon de la Barca confirms that after the critical stages that crossed the property when her owners were the daughters of Don Antonio Velasco de la Torre, San Jose Cocoyoc was in a period of splendor, the industrial facilities qualify as \\"first-order\\" and to describe the beauty and perfection of its fruit √°boles. =20th century= La Hacienda Cocoyoc continued to grow and prosper until the outbreak of the 1910 revolution, when the agrarian leader Emiliano Zapata, Morelos native and established his headquarters in neighboring Cuautla, declared war on all the sugar plantations. When the revolution finally ended eleven years later, the Hacienda Cocoyoc was reduced by the distribution of land among the farmers and peasants and the remainder, 68 acres was purchased in 1957 by Mr. Paulino Rivera Torres, who has now realized his dream to convert a portion of this property, about 28 acres in a superb and well provided Hacienda Resort called \\"Paradise of America.\\" Cocoyoc has another attraction - El Universal The Ten Escapes to the Exotic: Mexico - New York Times Infrastructure The aqueduct Like other neighboring farms as Tlayacapan, Tepoztlan or Tlaquiltenango, San Jose Cocoyoc was built imitating the medieval European forts. This was due to the simple fact that there was at that time the builders enough that could make the architectural design of a hacienda. =El Ingenio= At that time mills were appointed to those establishments that had equipment or machine moved by animal traction or hydraulic. These required a very specialized job and the \\"understanding\\" of a specialist to build and to repair. Hence, by extension, in general, words or art mills in these centuries were synonymous with \\"complex machines\\". =Finances= The Hacienda helmet. Following the pattern of the hacienda in New Spain, consider the hacienda of San Jose Cocoyoc was a property that met the architectural spaces, machinery and workers needed to be a self-sufficient economic unit in which even exercised the judicial authorities and decided who punish and how, which resulted in the existence of a prison within the estate. =Main house= During colonial and 19th century, houses economically powerful people both in the cities and in the countryside consisted of a lower and high arranged around a central courtyard with a garden or front. The bedrooms are located on the top, and the other rooms of the owners or their guests, rooms and pantries, stored, and so on. At the bottom were the kitchen, next to a water fountain in the courtyard, rooms and spaces dedicated or trade, the store or the same output spaces (purge) or artisans offices, stables and corrals, even Hence integrated jail cell where they kept the workers according to the owner or his representative had done something wrong. Of course this, as in so many farms, nowadays we find no trace of the rooms of the Indians and slaves, because these were made of perishable materials. The House and Chapel. =Chapel= The building of this was closely linked with the social and economic status of the owner, for at that time could not have prospered without wit chapel or church to represent the peak. =El Trapiche= El Trapiche. La Hacienda de San Jos√© Cocoyoc was basically dedicated to the cultivation and processing of sugar cane, to get the grain of sugar would be sold both domestically and internationally. The processing of sugar cane was achieved through a complex process as beginning at the mill, where freshly cut reeds arrived, they were introducias by an operator at the mill. The canes were crushed by the action of two wheels found, yielding cane juice, which in turn was driven by wooden troughs to the boiler room. Furthermore, the rods or rod fragments that remained after this process were pressed in a press of large dimensions, to obtain the juice that had not been achieved by the action of the mill. In the boiler room, the juice was poured into 5 or 6 boilers, color receiving large ovens - for 3-4 m height - called burners, bringing the cane juice is heated and concentrated. In the last of these boilers, called trash, you gave the point to Roan. Boiler, the juice obtained was taken to the house drain and mud poured into forms that had a hole in the bottom, covered with banana leaf. In these earthen vessels, crystallized sugar, giving, by runoff, a honey that was again poured over sugar loaves thereby achieving whitening purging or sugar. Finally, the crystallized sugar pieces were placed in a solarium, which concluded the drying process, being ready for consumption. It is important to note that in the sugar plantations of the New Spain, in the 17th century preferably use water mill water wheel, in combination with the press, while in the 18th century, it was common to use the mill animal traction. The house manager =The value of the hacienda= Importantly, according to studies conducted by Dr. Gisela Von Woebeser, specializing in sugar plantations of Morelos, San Jose Cocoyoc was one of the most valuable estates that were in the region and at a time ranked first place. And also notes that \\"great wits were comparable, in terms of value, the property belonging to the most prominent members of the landed elite of the city of Mexico, ranging from 75,000 to 15.00 pesos.\\" Work The processing of sugar cane hacienda such, required a variety of skilled workers to carry out: =Administrators= Administrator: Usually a relative of the owner; Steward: Responsible for enforcing the orders of the Administrator =In the fields= Corporals, captains, Irrigators, Planters, Cutters, carretoneros, cane Lifters =The Trapiche= Grinders, Master of sugar, or meleros Boilermakers, wheeler-dealers, Homers, Ashtrays, Drain Master, Officers craftsmen: carpenters, arches, blacksmiths. One of the biggest problems I face the sugar planter in colonial labor was. The first mills or mills employed Indian labor that gave them their own parcel. Indians also used rebels who had been enslaved and forced distribution resorted to Indians. However, the use of Indian labor was hampered by the dramatic decline in the Indigenous population that occurred especially in the 16th century and the restrictions imposed by the colonial authorities that privileged the use of Indian labor for the mining sector. Given the difficulties faced by the indigenous labor employment, farmers resorted to buying African slaves. These slaves performed a variety of jobs, working as wheeler-dealers, prenseros, bakers, tinkers, ashtrays and artisans. Also carried out field work, livestock and shepherds, or were serving as cocheres, carretoneros and carriers. Women slaves, meanwhile, performed jobs like cooking, child care and provide them the catechism. The purchase of slaves used to represent a very strong monetary investment for the landowner and it was common for the highest value of the sugar mills represent what precisely their slaves and machinery and land. Slavery in the estates was not exempt from abuse and cruelty. They lived in miserable huts and could not ever leave the I√≠mites of the hacienda. To ensure the survival of the slaves, they were often marked as the cattle, with a hot iron on his face. Their living conditions were so deplorable that many victims died of disease, while some chose suicide to end their suffering. And it was common to avoid having children, to spare these penalties to which they would be subjected. Among the slaves of the sugar mills, the situation calls attention guarding who played the position of Master of sugar, since that work experience required. This worker had to recognize when he was just right juice boiling sugar cane and had been in different boilers or copper pots. It motivated her condition was of great consideration from the rest of the workers whether slaves or free, and even in some cases have reached a power and respect so that they were seen as witches.

As a Knight Hospitaller, joining the order in the Langue de Provence, he fought with distinction against the Turks at Rhodes. As Grand Master, Valette became the Order's hero and most illustrious leader, commanding the resistance against the Ottomans at the Great Siege of Malta in 1565, sometimes regarded as one of the greatest sieges of all time. The foundation stone of Valletta was laid by Grandmaster La Valette in 1566. He did not live to see Valletta completed, as he died in 1568 and was succeeded by Grandmaster Pierre de Monte. Early life La Valette He was born into the noble La Valette family in Quercy, South-western France, which had been an important family in France for many generations, various members having participated in the Crusades. Jean Parisot's grandfather, Bernard de La Valette, was a Knight and King's Orderly, and his father Guillot was a Chevalier de France. Jean Parisot was a distant cousin (through their mutual ancestor Almaric, Seigneur de Parisot) of Jean Louis de Nogaret de La Valette, first Duke of √âpernon. Although his birth year is usually given as 1494, both chroniclers of the Great Siege of Malta, Francisco Balbi di Correggio and Hipolito Sans, say he was 67 at the time, thereby implying that he was born in 1498. In his history of the Order of St. John, the 18th-century historian Abbe Vertot (whose history is largely based on - but often confuses - the earlier one of Giacomo Bosio) indicates that Valette was indeed the same age as both Suleiman I and Kƒ±zƒ±lahmedli Mustafa Pasha (the commander of the Ottoman land forces), which would mean that he was actually 70 years old at the time of the siege. Early career and rise within the Order La Valette's armour at the Palace Armoury. La Valette joined the Order when he was 20 years old in around 1514, and he never returned to France or his family estates from that day on. Jean de La Valette was present during the Great Siege of Rhodes in 1522, and accompanied Grand Master Philippe Villiers de L'Isle-Adam, after the Order's expulsion from Rhodes by the Ottoman Turks under Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent. After the loss of Rhodes, the Order was granted the Maltese Islands and Tripoli by Emperor Charles V. In 1537 La Valette became Governor of Tripoli, where he tried to restore order within the vulnerable city. In 1538 he was imprisoned in the Gozo prison for four months after attacking a man. In 1541 La Valette was involved in a naval battle against Abd-ur-Rahman Kust Aly, in which he was wounded and his galley, the San Giovanni, was captured. La Valette was taken as a galley slave for a year by Barbary pirates under the command of Turgut Reis but was later freed during an exchange of prisoners. In 1554 he was elected Captain General of the Order's galleys. This was a great honour to the Langue of Provence, as throughout most of the Order's history, the position of Grand Admiral was usually held by a Knight Grand Cross of the Italian Langue. In that capacity he won a name that stood conspicuous in that age of great sea captains, and was held in the same regard as the Chevalier Mathurin Romegas - one of the greatest Christian maritime commanders of the age. In fact both sides had extremely talented sailors. If La Valette, Romegas and Juan de Austria could be considered the best commanders that the Christian forces could bring to the sea, the forces of Islam were able to call on the equally outstanding maritime and leadership skills of admirals such as Barbarossa and Dragut. La Valette was described by Abbe de Branthome as being a \\"very handsome man, speaking several languages fluently including Italian, Spanish, Greek, Arabic and Turkish.\\" Grandmastership Coat of arms of La Valette as Grandmaster In 1557, upon the death of Grand Master Claude de la Sengle, the Knights, mindful of the attack that was sure to come, elected La Valette to be Grand Master. In 1560 he formed an alliance with the Habsburg Empire to reconquer Tripoli, but the expedition resulted in a Christian defeat at the Battle of Djerba. Despite this the Order's galleys were able to rescue several other Christian vessels, and later on in his reign, La Valette greatly strengthened the Order's navy. =Great Siege of Malta= He organised the defence of Malta, fought during the siege, and successfully repulsed the Turks at the Great Siege of Malta in 1565. During the siege the vastly outnumbered Christians held out for over 3 months against an Ottoman force containing no less than 30,000 soldiers, including the Janissaries, as well as the Sultan's fleet of some 193 ships. The battle saw the fall of Fort St. Elmo after about a month of fierce fighting, but the Order managed to hold out in Birgu and Senglea until a relief force arrived. Ottoman specialist engineers had originally assessed the fortification of Saint Elmo, from local informants and conducting reconnoitring missions, saying it would fall in three days. Knight Commander Le Sande, who had sailed from Sicily with reinforcements, ordered a general charge from the Maltese hills toward the end of the siege. They attacked the Ottoman forces until the Ottoman forces retreated to the sea, and at that point the sea had completely changed colour to red (from the sheer volume of blood lost). It was at that point the Ottoman forces boarded their ships, directed their course back to Constantinople, and had lost the siege. Whilst shaping course back to Constantinople they momentarily contemplated counterattacking. However, they had lost too many men, supplies, and morale at that point to launch any substantial counterattack. During the first days after the siege a Maltese soldier sitting around a campfire at night began to frame the words of a song which would later become famous in the Mediterranean: And from her ramparts a voice replied: As a result of the Order's victory La Valette gained much prestige in Europe, but he declined the offer of a cardinal's hat in order to maintain independence from the papacy. This has been attributed to his sense of modesty and his humility as a warrior monk. Building of Valletta and death After the great siege, he commissioned the construction of the new city of Valletta in 1566, laying the first stone with his own hands. This took place on the slopes of Mount Sciberras, where the flower of the Turkish army had died whilst trying to storm Fort Saint Elmo, which the Turks thought would fall within three or four days, but which, due to the bravery of the defenders, held out for 30 days. The city named after its founder - Humilissima Civitas Vallettae - became known as the most aristocratic and exclusive fortress in Europe - a city most often referred to as \\"Superbissima\\" - the \\"Most Proud\\". Valletta remains the Maltese capital to this day. La Valette suffered a stroke while praying in a chapel and died soon after on 21 August 1568, exactly eleven years after he became Grandmaster. La Valette never saw the completed city of Valletta. His tomb (in the form of a sarcophagus) can be found in the Crypt of the Conventual Church of the Order (now St. John's Co-Cathedral), situated within the walls of Valletta. The inscription on his tomb, which was composed by his Latin Secretary, Sir Oliver Starkey, the last Knight of the English Langue at the time of the Great Siege, states in Latin: Personal life La Valette has been referred to as one who never broke his vows, but it has been claimed that he had a mistress while in Rhodes called Catherine nicknamed Greque (Greek), and that he had an illegitimate son from her who was called Barth√©lemy de La Valette. Documentary evidence has been found by Bonello that proves Barth√©lemy was legitimatized in 1568 by a decree of King Charles IX of France. Claims have also been put forth that La Valette had at least another daughter, Isabella Guasconi, after a presumed affair with the wife of a Rhodiot nobleman of Florentine descent. Isabella later married a Florentine gentleman Stefano Buonaccorsi, but he murdered her on 31 July 1568, some time after their marriage. After the murder Buonaccorsi escaped the islands with Isabella's wealth and was never heard from again. Legacy Pjazza Jean de Valette, Valletta. La Valette is well known for being the Grandmaster who won the Great Siege and founded Valletta. A street in the town of Naxxar as well as the flagship of Virtu Ferries are both named after him. La Valette was also featured on Maltese stamps, coins, banknotes and telecards a number of times. =Jean de Valette Square= In 2012, a square was inaugurated in Valletta named Pjazza Jean de La Valette which also features a statue of the Grandmaster. The statue is 2.5m high and was cast in bronze by the local sculptor Joseph Chetcuti. In the statue La Valette is shown armour and holding Valletta's plan in one hand and a sword in the other.Rix, Juliet (2015). Malta and Gozo. Bradt Travel Guides. . . p. 118. The new square in Valletta named after the Grandmaster uses the name de Valette instead of de La Valette For many years, the widely accepted version of the Grandmaster's surname was de La Valette. However, during the unveiling of the statue at Pjazza Jean de Valette in November 2012, judge and historian Giovanni Bonello stated that the Grandmaster always signed his name as de Valette without the La. A week later, D√©sire√© von la Valette Saint Georges, a descendant of the Grandmaster, stated that the family name was de la Valette not de Valette and since then, a dispute has started as to what his name actually was. Members of the various branches of the Valette family actually used both versions at the time, but the Grandmaster himself never used the La. In fact, all 138 coins and 19 medals minted by the Order during de Valette's reign show the names de Valette, de Valetta or just Valette. Bonello additionally stated that the La possibly originated since the city of Valletta was commonly called La Valletta, so people started including the La and sometimes the double l in the Grandmaster's name. It is worth noting that an interesting development had occurred in 1539 when de Vallette was some 45 years old and already in Malta. It was then that Francis I, seeing the wide linguistic disparity in the use of various Romance and Germanic languages in France, enacted the Ordinance of Villers-Cotter√™ts which prescribed the use of standard French, mostly as spoken in northern France and in the Paris area where the langues d'oui prevailed. The name de Valette is now used in Malta, although many still refer to him as de La Valette due to the collective memory. The Order's successor, the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, call the Grandmaster Fra' Jean de La Vallette-Parisot. In literature Due to his key role in holding Malta during the siege of 1565, de Valette has appeared as a main and supporting character in several works of literature: *Angels in Iron is a 1997 pseudo- historic novel by Nicholas Prata; De Valette is the main character.Angels in Iron *Ironfire: An Epic Novel of War and Love is a 2005 adventure novel by David Ball.
