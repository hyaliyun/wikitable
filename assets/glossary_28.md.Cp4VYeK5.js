It first aired on CBS on February 24, 2011. The episode features a cameo appearance by LeVar Burton. Plot Due to Leonard and Priya's relationship, the gang begins to have dinner at Raj's place instead of Leonard and Sheldon's apartment. This upsets Sheldon, who dislikes change and makes numerous complains when eating dinner at Raj's apartment. Sheldon goes to the Cheesecake Factory where he tries to get Penny to agree with him. Amy calls Sheldon and they have a conversation. Penny tells Sheldon that he will have to deal with \\"hanging out\\" at Raj's more often, and Amy agrees, claiming that Leonard is the \\"nucleus\\" of their social group and that \\"where he goes, the group goes\\". Sheldon invites round several other friends to have dinner in his apartment and sends a tweet to LeVar Burton, asking him to come. After the other guests have arrived, they introduce themselves, although it is apparent that Sheldon does not particularly like his guests. Stuart came because he is in financial distress and wanted a hot shower; Barry came solely because Sheldon said there would be a raffle; Zack is extremely unintelligent. Sheldon's plans are dismissed: instead, Zack tells dating stories and they sing karaoke. Sheldon eventually leaves. At Raj's apartment, the gang realise they miss Sheldon and his eccentric habits. They reminisce about previous events (such as Sheldon getting a loom). When Sheldon arrives to have dinner with them, he slowly begins to warm up to Priya after being slightly impressed with her knowledge and her cooking. Meanwhile, Bernadette and Amy try to take Penny out dancing to get her mind off Leonard and Priya. Penny agrees to go provided that they don't pester her about it, but Amy finds the snowflake Leonard gave Penny when he went to the North Pole, causing Penny's feeling for Leonard to resurface. Penny goes out anyway with the intention of having a one-night stand. In the final scene, LeVar Burton arrives at Sheldon's apartment, but upon seeing Sheldon's guests singing \\"Walking on Sunshine\\" badly, he leaves immediately and says \\"I'm so done with Twitter\\".

The game is an action shooter video game, and has been compared to paintball by Gematsu and Senran Kagura by Siliconera. Bullet Girls takes place in a school that serves upper class girls, and focuses on the Ranger Club, whose members undertake military missions in their spare time. Noted for its ample amounts of ecchi and fanservice content, Bullet Girls game was released on August 21, 2014, in Japan. A sequel, titled Bullet Girls 2, was released on April 21, 2016.

Characters can hold up to four different weapons, which can be exchanged during missions. Military vehicles, such as tanks, armoured vehicles, and helicopters can be found in the game as well. Many game maps feature in Bullet Girls, ranging from the schoolyard to the desert. A notable gameplay mechanic of Bullet Girls is clothes degradation.

The game's story begins on the first day after students have officially become club members, thus starting the adventures of the Ranger Clubs and their activities. = Characters = * (voiced by M.A.O), a happy-go-lucky girl who takes everything in stride and always gives her all. She aspired to join the First Aid Club, but accidentally joined the Ranger Club after misaddressing her application and her advisor forced her to stay. However, over time, she finds herself charmed by the other club members. * (voiced by Aya Uchida), a mysterious girl who is somewhat smart but also a bit of an airhead. Yurina isn't always the quickest of thinkers but occasionally demonstrates aptitude. Outside of school, she lives with her older brother and is a talented cook. * (voiced by Kaori Fukuhara), an extremely energetic girl who is considered to be a mood maker of sorts for those in the Ranger Club, due to being easily excitable and having unmatched levels of energy. She is also known for being out of control when something sets off her temper. * (voiced by Sachika Misawa), a tsundere-type of girl who often creeps behind other club members and is not unlike a ninja, being quick on her feet. She has a habit of squeezing the chests of the other girls. * (voiced by Aya Suzaki), an immature girl who considers herself highly. She has a habit of penchant of not showing up to Ranger Club meetings when they don't suit her, much to the annoyance of other members, and often sulks around as if she's still in middle school. However, once she sets her eyes on something, there's no stopping her until she gets what she wants. * (voiced by Emi Uema), a \\"samurai warrior at heart\\" who has traded her blade for a gun. Minagi is a tactician within the Ranger Club with a strong independent streak and a cool and collected demeanor. She sometimes expresses her feelings in the form of haikus. * (voiced by Asami Tano), a dashing young woman who has managed to court her own horde of fans at school. She is the vice president of the Ranger Club, though often stands in as interim president due to the actual president often being absent. Aki grew up hearing war stories told from her grandmother and is interested in all things military. * (voiced by Yuiko Tatsumi), the president of the Ranger Club. She is the daughter of a famous family and holds her looks in high regard, considering them to be a cut above those of her fellow high schoolers. She is routinely absent from club activities due to official activities, but is a hard worker. * (voiced by Yui Makino), a supporting character and advisor to the Ranger Club. She is a graduate from the academy, and despite being a bit careless was considered to be one of the top members in her time. * (voiced by Muta Minami), a supporting character and manager of the in-game shop that handles equipment necessary for club activities.

Jelinek, Paul R. Magocsi. The Carpathian Diaspora: The Jews of Subcarpathian Rus' and Mukachevo, 1848‚Äì1948. East European Monographs (2007). p. 5-6.

OCLC 352874902. pp. 23-24. Unterland, or \\"Lowland\\", was named so by the Oberlander, in spite of being topographically higher: According to Dr. Menahem Kratz, it served to reflect the scorn of the educated westerners to their poor and unacculturated brethren. While refugees from the 1648 Khmelnytsky Uprising were the first Jews to settle in these regions, the vast emigration from the adjacent Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, following its annexation by Empress Maria Theresa in 1772, shaped the character of the Unterlander, in addition to the area's \\"backwardness\\". Throughout the 19th century, the northeast remained under-developed by any parameter. While hundreds of modern Jewish schools, teaching in German, were established by the authorities in 1850, there were only 8 in the entire Kaschau school district, which covered most of Unterland. The linguistic shift from Yiddish to vernacular, which was over in the rest of Hungary by the mid-19th century, was little felt in the province.Michael K. Silber. The Emergence of Ultra- Orthodoxy: The Invention of Tradition. In: Jack Wertheimer, ed. The Uses of Tradition: Jewish Continuity since Emancipation (New York-Jerusalem: JTS distributed by Harvard U. Press, 1992). pp. 41-42. Other Hungarian Jews derisively called them \\"Finaks\\" or \\"Fins\\", based on their pronunciation of the phrase \\"Von [fin in Unterland accent] Wo bist du?\\" (\\"From where are you?\\"); In Fatelessness, Imre Kert√©sz recalled the Yiddish-speaking, devout \\"Fins\\" in Auschwitz.Imre Kert√©sz. Fateless. Northwestern University Press, 1992. p. 101. The boundary which separated Unterland from the rest of Hungarian Jewry ran between the Tatra Mountains and Kolozsv√°r (present-day Cluj-Napoca). It paralleled the linguistic demarcation line of Western and Middle Yiddish.Jechiel Bin-Nun. Jiddisch und die Deutschen Mundarten: Unter Besonderer Ber√ºcksichtigung des Ostgalizischen Jiddisch. Walter de Gruyter (1973). p. 93. While the locals' dialect resembled the Galician one, it was laced with Hungarian vocabulary, and more influenced by German grammar.Robert Perlman. Bridging Three Worlds: Hungarian-Jewish Americans, 1848‚Äì1914. University of Massachusetts Press (2009). p. 65. Its sibboleth was the pronunciation of R as an Apical consonant. Unterland Yiddish is conserved today mainly by the Satmar Hasidim's educational network.Steffen Krogh. How Satmarish is Satmar Yiddish? Jiddistik Heute. D√ºsseldorf Uni. Press, pp. 484-485. The influence of Hasidism was strong in the region, though its adherents never constituted a majority. They were known as \\"Sephardim\\", owing to their different prayer rite, while the non-Hasidim were called \\"Ashkenazim\\" in Hungary. Many of the locals belonged to Hasidic sects from outside the region, like Belz or Vizhnitz. Later on, native courts sprang up in Unterland, mainly Kaliv, Sighet-Satmar, Munkatsch, and Spinka. While there were tensions between the Hasidim and the Ashkenazim, they never reached the levels of hostility which characterized the Lithuanian Misnagdim, both due to the movement's local nature and the lack of opposition from Hungary's most important rabbi, Moses Sofer. He did not approve of the sects, but refrained from action. In the 19th century, any discord between Sofer's disciples and the Hasidic rebbes was marginalized by the need to oppose the progressive and modernized Neologs. The Unterlander, who were poor and traditionalist, had no inclination toward Neology: Only two such communities existed in the region, in Kassa (present-day Ko≈°ice) and Ungv√°r (present-day Uzhhorod), the largest cities.Kinga Froimovich.

Thomas was born to Stephen Bloomer Balch and Elizabeth [Beall] Balch on February 28, 1793 at Georgetown, District of Columbia, US. Thomas was a graduate of the College of New Jersey in 1813 and Princeton Theological Seminary in 1817, where he was a member of the American Whig Society. Hampden- Sydney College conferred an honorary DD on him in 1860. Daniel Webster is supposed to have described him as the most learned man he had ever known. Baltimore Presbytery ordained Thomas on October 31, 1816. For several years he assisted his father in the church at Georgetown, Virginia. He accepted a call to Snow Hill, Rehoboth and Pitts Creek, Maryland July 19, 1820. Snow Hill is the oldest Presbyterian Church in America. Thomas Balch was listed as a missionary in Fairfax County, Virginia from 1829 to 1836. His brother-in-law, Septimus Tuston, had been a regular preacher at Greenwich, Virginia between 1825 and 1842. This connection may have led to Thomas becoming the stated supply at Warrenton and Greenwich, Virginia 1836-38 and again 1874-78\\\\. He also supplied in Prince William and Nokesville. Just after he accepted the call to the churches in Maryland, Thomas Balch married Susan Carter of Fairfax, Va. (8/21/22) Susan was the daughter of Charles Beal Carter of Shirley. Charles Beale Carter was an uncle of General Robert E. Lee. No doubt the marriage into the prominent and wealthy family helped Thomas financially. When Thomas and Susan moved to Prince William and Fauquier Counties, they bought a place between Auburn and Greenwich. He called the property Ringwood. He along with Jane Alexander Milligan ran a boarding school for girls there. Part of the structure was later remodeled. Thomas and his wife were direct observers of the American Civil War and interacted with both Confederate and Federal troops. Thomas wrote of their personal experiences in My Manse During the War. He died February 14, 1878 at his home, Ringwood. His wife, Susan, had expired the year before. His friend William Wilson Corcoran provided stones for the couple and they are buried in the Greenwich Presbyterian Cemetery in Greenwich, Virginia. During his lifetime Thomas Balch had ‚Äòbecome almost as highly regarded by Virginia Presbyterians as his famous father had been by the citizens of Georgetown and Washington.' Dr. Thomas B. Balch frequently wrote for the Southern Literary Messenger, The Christian World, and published in Christianity and Literature.

Currently released on Steam are these titles: * Chantelise ‚Äì A Tale of Two Sisters (2006) * Recettear: An Item Shop's Tale (2007) * Fortune Summoners: Secret of the Elemental Stone (2008) * This Starry Midnight We Make (2013) Carpe Fulgur consists of founders Andrew Dice and Robin Light-Williams.  History  The following history is largely based on an interview Andrew Dice gave to Gamasutra. Andrew Dice and Robin Light-Williams met through the Something Awful forums. Dice had been interested in English translations of Japanese games and following in the footsteps of Ted Woolsey in the translation of several Square Japanese titles. After attempting to gain employment at a localization company in California, Dice contacted Light-Williams and proposed the idea of forming their own company for performing localizations. Dice said he saw value in bringing Japanese titles to the West as \\"above all what the Western gaming audience likes is a unique experience\\", an opportunity afforded by the growing d≈çjin market in Japan. After forming Carpe Fulgur, Dice and Light-Williams considered approaching Gust Corporation, offering their services to translate games from the Atelier series, but ultimately decided against the idea. Light-Williams suggested the idea of approaching d≈çjin soft developers, as while titles from major Japanese developers have often been localized in English, there had been no effort for doing the same with the d≈çjin market. Williams specifically suggested Recettear, which had favorable word-of-mouth in Japan, and whose developers, EasyGameStation, were eager to open the game to the Western market. Though there was some trepidation due to the distance between countries and between Dice and Light-Williams (who, at the time, lived on opposite sides of the United States), EasyGameStation agreed to work with Carpe Fulgur for the translation. The company was formally registered in June 2010 just before the group's first release, Recettear.

Rodger stabbed three men to death in his apartment, apparently one by one on their arrival. About three hours later he drove to a sorority house, and after failing to get inside shot three women outside, two of whom died. He next drove past a nearby deli and shot to death a male student inside. He then began to drive through Isla Vista, shooting and wounding several pedestrians from his car and striking several others with his car. He exchanged gunfire with police twice, and was injured in the hip. After his car crashed into a parked vehicle, he was found dead inside with a self- inflicted gunshot wound to the head. Before driving to the sorority house, Rodger uploaded to YouTube a video titled \\"Elliot Rodger's Retribution\\", in which he outlined his planned attack and his motives. He explained that he wanted to punish women for rejecting him, and sexually active men because he envied them. He also emailed a lengthy autobiographical manuscript to acquaintances, his therapist, and family members; the document appeared on the Internet and became widely known as his manifesto. In it, he described his childhood, family conflicts, frustration over inability to find a girlfriend, his hatred of women, his contempt for couples (particularly interracial couples) and his plans for what he described as \\"retribution\\".  Elliot Rodger  = Early life= Elliot Oliver Robertson Rodger was born in London, United Kingdom, and moved to the United States with his parents when he was five years old. He was raised in Los Angeles. His father is British filmmaker Peter Rodger, his paternal grandfather photo-journalist George Rodger. His mother is a Malaysian Chinese research assistant for a film company. A younger sister was born before his parents divorced. After his father remarried, he and his second wife Soumaya Akaaboune, a Moroccan actress, had a son together. Rodger attended Crespi Carmelite High School, an all-boys Catholic school in Encino, Los Angeles, and then Taft High School in Woodland Hills. He graduated from Independence Continuation High School in Lake Balboa in 2009, and briefly attended Los Angeles Pierce College and Moorpark College before moving to Isla Vista in 2011. He attended Santa Barbara City College; in his manifesto he said that he dropped out of his classes in February 2012; after the killings the school said he had no longer been taking classes. = Mental health and social problems = According to his family's attorney and a family friend, Rodger had seen multiple therapists since he was eight years old, but the attorney said he had never been formally diagnosed with a mental illness. He was diagnosed with pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified, an autism spectrum disorder, in 2007. By the ninth grade, Rodger was \\"increasingly bullied\\", and wrote later that he \\"cried by [himself] at school every day\\"; at this time he developed an obsession with the multiplayer-online game World of Warcraft, which dominated his life for most of his teenage years, and briefly into his 20s. At Crespi Carmelite High he was bullied; in one incident his head was taped to a desk while he was asleep. According to Rodger, in 2012, \\"the one friend [he] had in the whole world who truly understood [him]... said he didn't want to be friends anymore\\" without offering any reason. Rodger had a YouTube account, and a blog titled \\"Elliot Rodger's Official Blog\\", through which he expressed loneliness and rejection. He wrote that he had been prescribed risperidone but refused to take it, stating, \\"After researching this medication, I found that it was the absolute wrong thing for me to take.\\" After turning 18, Rodger began rejecting mental health care and became increasingly isolated. He said that he was unable to make friends, although acquaintances said that he rebuffed their attempts to be friendly. Family friend Dale Launer said that he counseled Rodger on approaching women, but that Rodger did not follow the advice; Launer also commented that when he met Rodger at eight or nine, \\"I could see then that there was something wrong with him... looking back now he strikes me as someone who was broken from the moment of conception.\\" = Early incidents = In 2011, Rodger threw coffee on a couple he was jealous of; in another incident, he splashed coffee on two girls for not smiling at him. In 2012 Rodger used a Super Soaker filled with orange juice to spray a group playing kickball at Girsh Park. Referring to an incident in July 2013, Rodger wrote that after being mocked at a party he tried but failed to shove some girls over a ten-foot ledge; instead other boys pushed him over and his ankle was injured. When he went back for his sunglasses he was again mocked, and beaten. A neighbor saw Rodger come home crying and vowing to kill the men involved and then himself. He wrote in his manifesto that the incident was the final trigger for his planning the attack. In January 2014, Rodger accused Cheng Yuan Hong, one of his roommates, of stealing some candles; Hong pleaded guilty to petty theft. On April 30, Rodger's parents contacted police after becoming alarmed by his behavior and YouTube videos. Sheriff's deputies who visited Rodger determined that he did not meet the criteria for an involuntary mental health commitment; Rodger had told them he had a \\"misunderstanding\\" with his parents. = Manifesto and online posts = Rodger emailed his 107,000-word manifesto, My Twisted World: The Story of Elliot Rodger, to 34 people, including his therapist, Charles Sophy, his parents and other family, former teachers, and childhood friends. In it he said he'd originally sought to carry out an attack on Halloween of 2013, but reconsidered because he thought there would be too many police about. In his last YouTube video, \\"Elliot Rodger's Retribution\\", he complained of being rejected by women and envying sexually active men, and described his planned attack and the motives behind it. In the video, he says: He wrote in My Twisted World that being of mixed race made him \\"different from the normal fully white kids\\". On one online forum, he said that he opposed interracial dating and made several racist posts regarding African-American, Hispanic, South Asian and East Asian people, stating that seeing men of these ethnic groups socializing with white women \\"makes you want to quit life.\\" In one online post, Rodger wrote: In his manifesto, Rodger made a racist comment regarding another boy, outlining some of his plans: A \\"War on Women\\" was the second phase of his plan: Rodger stated in his manifesto that in his ideal world, he imagined that he would \\"quarantine all [women] in concentration camps. At these camps, the vast majority of the female population will be deliberately starved to death. That would be an efficient and fitting way to kill them all off... I would have an enormous tower built just for myself... and gleefully watch them all die.\\" He also dreamed of \\"a pure world, [where] the man's mind can develop to greater heights than ever before. Future generations will live their lives free of having to worry about the barbarity of sex and women, which will enable them to expand their intelligence and advance the human race to a state of perfect civilization\\". He further said that he planned to kill his half-brother and stepmother, but was not mentally prepared to kill his father. =Preparations= In September 2012, Rodger visited a shooting range to practice firing handguns. In November 2012 he purchased his first handgun, a Glock 34 pistol, in Goleta after doing research on handguns, choosing it as \\"an efficient and highly accurate weapon\\". In early 2013, Rodger bought two additional handguns, both SIG Sauer P226 pistols, writing that they were \\"of a much higher quality than the Glock\\" and \\"a lot more efficient\\". He purchased the weapons legally in Oxnard and Burbank California. Rodger claimed to have saved $5,000, which was given to him by his parents and grandmothers, in order to purchase the weapons and supplies for the attacks. Gun law experts in California have said that there was nothing in his known history that prevented him from making legal firearm purchases.  Attacks  Rodger began his attacks at his apartment on Seville Road, where three men were killed by numerous stab wounds to their upper bodies. Bloodstains later found in the building's hallway suggested that one or more of the victims had been attacked as he entered, and a bloody bath towel and paper towels in the bathroom suggest Rodger had attempted to clean the hallway. Their positions suggested that each was killed separately as he entered. Two of the victims were confirmed to be Rodger's roommates according to an apartment lease, while police were investigating whether the third was also a resident or visiting the apartment on the night of the killings. After the stabbings, Rodger purchased coffee at a coffee shop, then at around 8:30 p.m., he was seen working on his laptop in his car in the parking lot of his apartment building. He uploaded his \\"Retribution\\" video at 9:17 and sent his manifesto e-mail at 9:18. After receiving a copy of the manifesto, Rodger's therapist phoned his mother, whofinding the \\"Retribution\\" video on Rodger's YouTube channelcontacted Rodger's father. In separate cars they left Los Angeles for Santa Barbara, calling Isla Vista police while enroute. Rodger drove to the Alpha Phi sorority house at Embarcadero del Norte and Segovia Road near UCSB, where he knocked on the front door for a few minutes then began shooting people nearby. Two women were killed and a third was injured. Rodger began driving again. He fired into an unoccupied coffee shop on Pardall Road, then several times into a delicatessen; a man was struck seven times and killed. Rodger drove south on Embarcadero del Norte on the wrong side of the street, striking a pedestrian and firing at, but missing, two persons on the sidewalk. He shot a couple exiting a pizzeria and a female cyclist. He drove south on El Embarcadero and shot at and missed a woman, turned east on Del Playa Drive, and made a U-turn to drive west. He then exchanged fire with a sheriff's deputy responding to a telephone report, and struck two pedestrians. Turning north on Camino del Sur, Rodger shot and wounded three people at Sabado Tarde Street, and also struck a skateboarder and two cyclists with his car. Turning east on Sabado Tarde, he struck another skateboarder with his car and shot two other men at the intersection with Camino Pescadero. On Sabado Tarde near Little Acorn Park, Rodger exchanged gunfire with three sheriff's deputies, and was shot in the hip. Pursued by police, he turned south a second time onto El Embarcadero, then west again on Del Playa. He struck a cyclist, then crashed on the north sidewalk just east of the intersection of Del Playa and Camino Pescadero. At 9:35, police found Rodger dead inside his car from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to his head. In the car were three pistols, knives, six empty ten-round magazines, and 548 rounds of unspent ammunition.  Victims  All six murder victims were students at UCSB. The men killed at Rodger's apartment were George Chen (), 19; Cheng Yuan \\"James\\" Hong (), 20; and Weihan \\"David\\" Wang (), 20. The three who died from gunshot wounds were Katherine Breann Cooper, 22; Christopher Ross Michaels-Martinez, 20; and Veronika Elizabeth Weiss, 19. Cooper and Weiss were the women killed outside the Alpha Phi sorority house, while Michaels-Martinez was the victim inside the Isla Vista Deli Mart. Fourteen other people were injured; seven from gunshot wounds and seven by blunt trauma sustained when Rodger struck them with his vehicle. Eleven of the injured were taken to hospitals. Seven went to Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital, where two were admitted in serious condition, one in fair condition, and two others in good condition, and one patient was released on the same day. The remaining four injured were taken to Goleta Valley Cottage Hospital, where they were all treated and released.  Reactions and discussion  = Controversy over video airing = Several news networks limited the use of the \\"Retribution\\" video posted by Rodger for fear of triggering copycat crimes. The New Statesman posited that the manifesto may influence a \\"new generation of 'involuntary celibates'\\". = Memorial services = Memorial service at Harder Stadium, May 27 Students and community members gathered at Anisq'Oyo' Park in Isla Vista on the evening of May 24 for a candlelight memorial to remember the victims. On May 27 some 20,000 people attended a memorial service at UCSB's Harder Stadium. On May 23, 2015, the first anniversary of the attacks, hundreds of people gathered at UCSB for a candlelight vigil commemorating the six slain victims. The mother of George Chen was scheduled to speak at the event. = Gun control and mental health = The attacks renewed calls for gun control and improvements in the US health care system, with Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal saying, California Senator Dianne Feinstein blamed the National Rifle Association's \\"stranglehold\\" on gun laws for the attack and said \\"shame on us\\" in Congress for failing to do something about it. Pennsylvania Congressman Timothy F. Murphy, a clinical psychologist, said his bipartisan mental health overhaul would be a solution and urged Congress to pass it. Richard Martinez, the father of victim Christopher Michaels-Martinez, gave a speech in which he placed the blame of the attacks on \\"craven, irresponsible\\" politicians and the National Rifle Association. Martinez later urged the public to join him in \\"demanding immediate action\\" from members of Congress regarding gun control. He also expressed his sympathy towards Rodger's parents. Doris A. Fuller, the executive director of the Treatment Advocacy Center, said that California law permitted emergency psychiatric evaluations of potentially dangerous individuals through provisions, but such actions were never enabled during the initial police investigation of Rodger. She said, Some California lawmakers called for an investigation into the deputies' contact with Rodger on April 30, at which time the California gun ownership database reflected the fact that Rodger had bought at least two handguns. Deputies did not check the database, nor did they view the YouTube videos that had prompted Rodger's parents to contact them. In September 2014 California legislators passed a \\"red flag law\\" to enable judges to have guns seized from persons who are a danger to themselves or to others. = Misogyny = The attack sparked discussion of broader issues of violence against women and misogyny. Rodger frequented online forums such as PUAHate and ForeverAlone where he and other men posted misogynistic statements, subscribed to several \\"pick-up artist\\" YouTube channels, and described himself online as an \\"incel\\"a member of an online subculture based around its members' perceived inability to find a romantic or sexual partner. He wrote that after purchasing his first gun he \\"felt a new sense of power. I was now armed. Who's the alpha male now, bitches? I thought to myself, regarding all of the girls who've looked down on me in the past.\\" He also described his plan to invade a sorority house: He wrote, \\"I will slaughter every single spoiled, stuck-up, blond slut I see inside there. All those girls I've desired so much. They have all rejected me and looked down on me as an inferior man.\\" Mary Elizabeth Williams objected to Rodger being labeled the \\"virgin killer\\", saying that implies that \\"one possible cause of male aggression is a lack of female sexual acquiescence\\". Amanda Hess, writing for Slate, argued that although Rodger killed more men than women, his motivations were misogynistic because his reason for hating the men he attacked was that he thought they stole the women he felt entitled to. Writing for Reason, Cathy Young countered with \\"that seems like a good example of stretching the concept into meaninglessness ‚Äì or turning it into unfalsifiable quasi-religious dogma\\" and wrote that Rodger also wrote many hateful messages about other men. National Post columnist Barbara Kay criticized the focus on the female victims and pointed to gendered massacres targeting males, such as in wartime Srebrenica and a school massacre carried out by Boko Haram. Comments and coverage of misogyny as a root cause have generated criticisms of oversimplification and distortion of the events, which included the killings of more men than women and Rodger's mental health issues. Some writers used the #NotAllMen hashtag on Twitter to express the fact that not all men are misogynistic and not all men commit murder. Others criticized use of this hashtag, as it was considered to derail from discussion of the issue of violence against women. Someone created the Twitter hashtag #YesAllWomen on May 24 to express the idea that all women experience misogyny and sexism, although not all men are sexist.

It is located at Nagpur in the state of Maharashtra which has been famous for Mandarin oranges. The centre provides for research in the field of citrus agriculture; it also offers consultancy towards the field. It is a research institute under the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) which is an autonomous body under the Ministry of Agriculture of the Indian Government. History Central India has appropriate conditions for growing citrus. The city of Nagpur and the region of Vidarbha produces the bulk of India's citrus tonnage, which is the fifth largest producer in the world. In 1980, a task force appointed by the Ministry of Agriculture suggested the need of strengthening of research on citrus in central India after their survey during 24 to 26 April. Dr. D.J. Hutchison, and UNDP consultant on citrus recommended the establishment of Citrus Research Station at Nagpur to investigate problems concerning citrus fruits in the region. The Maharashtra state government also requested the Director General of Indian Council of Agricultural Research for the same. Similarly, quinquennial review team (QRT) of Indian Institute of Horticulture Research (IIHR), Bangalore furthered the recommendation. Consequently, ICAR agreed for the establishment of the Research Station at Nagpur in VIth Plan. Initially named the Central Citrus Research Station a committee constituted by ICAR selected suitable land at Nagpur and Government of Maharashtra agreed to provide the 100 hectares of land for the station to be established during VIIth Plan. The foundation stone was laid on 29 July 1985 formally by P.V. Narasimha Rao, the then Minister of Defence. The Centre was functional from 29 November 1985. The centre started functioned from part of the building of rabbit breeding centre of the Veterinary College at Seminary Hills, Nagpur which was under Dr. PDKV, Akola. Initially, pathology, entomology, horticulture and Post-harvest technology laboratories were established. On 1 April 1986 the status of Central Citrus Research Station which was functioning under IIHR, Bangalore was upgraded to National Research Centre for Citrus with an outlay of Rs.74.00 lakhs in VII Plan. In 1996, the Centre was shifted from the building of rabbit breeding centre of the Veterinary College at Seminary Hills to present site at Amravati Road. Mandate The institute was created amidst the so-called 'citrus decline' in India resulting in reduction in the cropped area under citrus. The 2030 Visio document for the institute notes that of the erstwhile undergoing research activities at various universities none was able to contribute to this important region as also that the research was not linked by any framework. The newly created institute has now been the nodal body of citrus research in India. The National Mission on Citrus and concurrent research activities has allowed a concurrent doubling in yield in Maharashtra. The initial mandate of the 'station' was limited: Controversy The centre has been accused by farmers to not having tested methods in a real farm. Its recommendation of chemicals (pesticides and fertilizers) has been criticized for its continued recommendations of the use of pesticides against the latent and now widespread Phytophthora fungus, which in the past threatened in tandem with such factors as low rainfall or drought, selection of non-robust mother plant for rootstock and a prolonged use of chemicals, a near complete wipeout of the Nagpur orange. The NRCC has insisted that experimental studies of organic vs chemical cultivation has produced no significant differences in its own run farms. The farmers differ by their experiences by media accounts, reporting robustness against the fungus and high yields after a switch to organic methods. Ensuing the 1995-2005 drought In the NRCC warned the government in 2005 about the problem of nurseries stocking up on impure and undesirable rootstock varieties like galgal or (Kumaon lemon), the government did not do anything about it.

The Recorder was the chief magistrate of Cork city: his principal duty was to keep the peace. The office was similar to that of the Recorder of Dublin, except that the Recorder of Cork, unlike his Dublin counterpart, did not have power to conduct any trial involving a capital crime. A statute of 1877 stated that wherever possible the Recorder should also be the Chairman of the Cork East Riding Quarter Sessions.County Officers and Courts (Ireland) Act 1877 s.86 The office, like its counterpart in Dublin, was an onerous one, involving at least two sittings of the Court every week; at certain times the Recorder had a Deputy Recorder to assist him.Act for the Regulation of Cork 1772 :\\"Recorder or Deputy Recorder\\" As with the Recordership of Dublin, it could be combined with another legal office, such as that of King's Serjeant-at-law.

Like the Recorder of Dublin, he was elected by the City Corporation, rather than being appointed by the Crown.

It has been the episcopal seat of the diocese of Celje since the creation of the diocese in 2006. History and description As early as the 12th century there was a small basilica on the site. This was replaced in 1306 by the present building, which served as the church of the abbey which during the Middle Ages stood on the edge of the town. In 1379 the rib vaulted roof was created. The church was altered several times up to the 16th century. In 1413 the Gothic chapel of the Mater Dolorosa was added, which was dedicated in 1420 by the bishop of Freising, Hermann von Cilli.Mittheilungen der Kaiserl. K√∂nigl.

The three-aisled nave has a flat roof and a separate space for the segregated use of nuns. The ceilings are decorated with frescoes of the 15th century, but those of the choir are older than those of the nave: the fragment of the figure of Christ in the middle of the choir ceiling may even date from the 14th century. Other frescoes depict the Three Kings. During the Baroque period a brightly-decorated chapel of Saint Francis Xavier was added. The painting of the chancel is by Michael Rosenberger, an artist who restored it in 1851. In 1858 the church was given its present Gothic Revival appearance. Various gravestones from the Middle Ages and the Renaissance (up to the 17th century) decorate the inside and outside walls. The 39th bishop of Freising, Hermann von Cilli, who died in Celje on 13 December 1421 after an operation, was buried in the church. His monument is now in the presbytery on the Gospel side.Mittheilungen der Kaiserl. K√∂nigl. Zentral-Kommission f√ºr Denkmalpflege in Wien, K.K. Hof- und Staatsdruckerei, 1901, p. 227.

It had a moment magnitude of 6.9 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of VIII (Severe). Serious damage was reported on the Turkish island of Imbros and the cities of Edirne and √áanakkale, as well as on the Greek island of Lemnos. The earthquake was felt in Bulgaria and southern Romania. Several aftershocks followed the main shock, the strongest measuring 5.3 ML. This aftershock struck the Gulf of Saros at 12:31 local time.  Tectonic setting  The northern part of the Aegean Sea shows a transition from the strike-slip tectonics associated with the North Anatolian Fault (NAF) to the extensional tectonics that characterise the area north of the Hellenic arc. The location of this earthquake is on the westward continuation of the NAF on the boundary between the Anatolian Plate and the Eurasian Plate. Other earthquakes on this part of the NAF include an M6.6 event in 1975 and an M5.7 event in 2003.  Earthquake  The distribution of aftershocks, combined with the observed focal mechanism, indicate dextral (right lateral) strike-slip on a WSW-ENE striking fault, assumed to be a continuation of the NAF. Analysis by backprojection of strong motion waveforms has been used to understand the detailed propagation history of the earthquake rupture. Two separate fault segments have been identified using this method. The shorter segment to the west of the hypocenter ruptured first followed by rupture to the east along the 65 km segment. Propagation of the longer eastern segment occurred at speeds well in excess of the S-wave velocity, making this an example of a supershear earthquake.  Damage and casualties  A British tourist was injured in Lemnos, Greece. A shelter at the Lemnos International Airport collapsed. Many abandoned houses and a church were also damaged. Almost three hundred houses were damaged in Turkey and 11 houses collapsed in Greece. Doƒüan News Agency said the tremor caused damage to some old houses on the island of Imbros, off Turkey's northern Aegean coast, and 30 people were taken to a hospital with minor injuries. Early reports talked about a heart attack in the greater earthquake area, but the death has not been confirmed. The Governor of √áanakkale reported a total number of 324 injuries. Two churches and 13 mosques were damaged to various extents. Minor damage was also inflicted in Bulgaria.

Badminton Mygdonia) is a badminton club based in Drymos, Thessaloniki, Greece. It was started in February 2000 and officially founded on March 22, 2002. Its emblem is an olive wreath, and its colors are orange and black. Mygdonia A.C. has achieved success at both the national and international levels. Many of the club's athletes have received national commendations in various age categories. Some have won the Greek Championship while others have been requested by the national badminton team of Greece. History = Founding and early history = Mygdonia A.C. was the first badminton sport club to be based in Drymos, Thessaloniki. The first coach of the team, Evangelia Tetradi, managed to staff the first sections of the academy with children, especially from primary and high school, after several badminton exhibitions at schools in the Mygdonia region. 100 kids were gathered during the debut training of the team. There was high interest in badminton in the region, and the club soon created a charter and officially established. In 2002, Mygdonia A.C. obtained an official form and joined the Hellenic Badminton Federation. In the club's early years, the athletes of Mygdonia A.C. participated in official contests and friendly tournaments, and the first accomplishments and medals in local school games created optimism for establishment among national leaders. Many new athletes joined the club; the first participants joined between March 31 and April 1, 2001, during the National Greek Championship U-15 at Sidirokastro. =First commendations and medals= By 2005, a batch of players, who were trained at academy sections, started winning medals at both national and international contests. The work inside the academy during the previous years proved successful, and the first commendations were awarded. The first national champion commendation was achieved by Sotiria Rofalikou in 2005. The next year, Marina Karypidou and Magdalini Tsioumleki received national commendations. By the late 2000s, the club had matured. Similar awards were later achieved by Maria Marou, Fotini Stavrousi, Eleutheria Giannopoulou, Nikoleta Diamela, and Syntridis Georgios, while Christos Polyzos, Stefanos Galanis, Ioannis Galanis, and Alexandros Varelas managed to enter the quarter-finals of National Individual Championship Contest.

The cars featured a distinctive glazed roof area meant to capture the ambience of a dome car in a lower profile, as tunnels on the East Coast of the United States prevented the use of dome cars there. The Seaboard employed all three Sun Lounges on its flagship Silver Meteor between New York City and Miami, Florida. The cars later saw service with the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad and Amtrak. Two of the three survive in private ownership.  Design  The first successful dome design in the United States was the \\"Vista Dome\\", which began test runs in 1945. The Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad (\\"CB&Q;\\") rebuilt a stainless steel Budd-built coach in their shops in Aurora, Illinois, with the Vista Dome design imagined and sketched by Cyrus Osborn. The dome area featured seats positioned lengthwise in the cabin facing double-pane windows which were designed to improve insulation. While popular with travelers, dome cars could not be used on most railroads in the Eastern United States because of the low clearance on various tunnels. Even the low-slung \\"Strata-Domes\\", designed by Pullman-Standard for the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway, could not travel north of Washington, D.C. due to low tunnel clearances in Baltimore and New York City. The concept of a \\"sun lounge\\" or a \\"sun parlor\\" was not new in railroading. The Illinois Central Railroad's Panama Limited, introduced in 1911, included a \\"sun-parlor\\" observation car, with wrap-around windows and a mahogany interior. In 1931 the Seaboard itself added a \\"lounge sun-parlor car\\" to the Southern States Special, one of its New York-Florida trains. The Seaboard turned to Pullman to design a sleeper-lounge which captured the ambiance of a dome car in a single-level car. The resulting Sun Lounge was split into two parts. At one end were five double bedrooms. At the other was a lounge for use by sleeping car passengers on the train. The lounge was unique, enclosed by large picture windows and glass windows on the roof, creating the effect of a dome without a dome. The lounge interior included such Floridian touches as light fixtures made of driftwood. In contemporary advertising the Seaboard touted the Sun Lounges as \\"unlike anything on the rails at present.\\"  Service history  Pullman delivered three Sun Lounges to the Seaboard: Miami Beach, Palm Beach, and Hollywood Beach. All three entered service in 1956 on the Silver Meteor. When the Seaboard merged with its rival the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad in 1967 to create the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad the cars remained in service but were renamed, becoming the Sun View, Sun Beam, and Sun Ray, respectively. Amtrak inherited all three lounges in 1971. It retired Sun View in 1977; Sun Beam and Sun Ray in 1981. None of three were converted to head-end power under the Heritage Fleet program. The Sun Beam (Palm Beach) was scrapped in the 1980s. The other two cars are privately owned.

Biography Diamond was born in 1931 at Sinai Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland, the only child of Max Sokol, a lawyer, and Anne Hirschhorn Sokol, a Hebrew Teacher. She was born with constriction ring syndrome, a congenital abnormality causing the loss of several of her fingers and toes before birth. She underwent more than 25 surgical procedures before reaching the age of 13. In addition to traditional surgical methods, she also visited ‚ÄúEmerson‚Äôs farm‚Äù, where young calves sucked on her fingers to soften the scars incurred by surgery. Liebe Diamond's early life was shaped by many different cultural influences, one of which was the stream of European Jewish refugees who passed through her home as her parents helped as many Jews as possible flee Europe during the increasing crisis of the 1930s. Dr. Diamond recalled in an interview one occasion in which her father and a wealthy family friend forged a letter from their synagogue, thus risking criminal prosecution, to bring eight Jewish families into the United States. The interaction and exposure to so many different individuals shaped her literary, artistic, cultural and intellectual education. Recognized for being intellectually gifted, Diamond enrolled in Baltimore City School #49, an accelerated junior high school. She then went on to Western High School, an all-girls school, and graduated in 1947 at the age of 16. Showing a great aptitude for science, Diamond enrolled at Smith College when she was 16 years old and completed a bachelor's degree with a major in chemistry and a double minor in physics and zoology, graduating magna cum laude in 1951 with Phi Beta Kappa and Sigma Psi . She then attended the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania; after graduating, she decided to pursue surgery and, with the encouragement of her own orthopedic surgeon, returned to the University of Pennsylvania to obtain a degree in orthopedics. After graduating in 1955, she became the first female resident at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, and the hospital's first female orthopedic surgical resident in 1957. After completing her residency in 1960, she became a certified orthopedic surgeon in 1963. Diamond became the 14th woman to become certified by the American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery. Working at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Diamond specialized in pediatric orthopedics, and in 1971, she founded the Pediatric Orthopedic Society of North America with seven other surgeons. From 1971 to 1972, she also served as the president of the Maryland Orthopedic Society. She later worked at the Curtis National Hand Center in Baltimore, specializing in children's hand and limb deformities; children with hand abnormalities were often brought to Diamond by their parents, not only for treatment but to illustrate how she had overcome her handicap. She was renowned for her innovative techniques for correcting limb deformities. She has worked as a consultant at Maryland General Hospital, Greater Baltimore Medical Center, Franklin Square Hospital and Union Memorial Hospital. She was also the director of residency training at University of Maryland Rehabilitation & Orthopaedic Institute from 1962 to the 1970s. She went on to run the Department of Clinical Research at Kernan Hospital for many years where she worked on reconstructive surgery and pediatric orthopedics research. Throughout her career, she authored numerous academic publications that continue to influence modern-day orthopedic surgical practice. In 1968 she became the chairman of the board of the Baltimore Hebrew University, and served for several years. Diamond served as a clinical associate professor in orthopedic surgery and pediatrics at the University of Maryland for 35 years, from 1961 until 1996. She became the first President of the Ruth Jackson Society of Women Orthopedic Surgeons in 1983. In 1996, she was awarded a Smith College medal, for making the best use of a liberal arts education. She was inducted into the Maryland Women's Hall of Fame in 2006. Personal life Diamond was raised in the Judaic faith. Near the end of her residency in 1959, she met Earl L. Diamond, a doctor working at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, marrying in the fall of 1960. She gave birth six years later to a son named Joshua Moses on July 16, 1966. She and her family were fans of the outdoors; they camped, hiked, paddled canoes, rode horses, skied cross country, among many other activities. In the summer, they were regular fixtures in Grand Teton National Park as well as Yellowstone National Park, where she was an authority on Great Fountain Geyser. She was also a fixture at the Everglades National Park in the winter. Enamored with the outdoors, she often drove long distances across the United States from her home in Maryland to various national and state parks.

The purpose of the campaign was to ensure that Carleton as an employer treated Canadian citizens equitably and that Canadians would remain or become at least a two-thirds majority of the teaching staff. Although Carleton was the particular institution addressed in the recommendations of Mathews and Steele, they were concerned about fairness for Canadian scholars in the hiring practices of all Canadian universities and about a lack of Canadian content in many courses. Although their recommendations were rejected at Carleton, concern about Canadianization was widespread. Eventually, all universities in Canada were required by the Canadian government to follow employment practices that were more fair for Canadians, and the number and percentage of courses with Canadian content in Canadian universities increased remarkably. The problem of Canadianization was the subject of a three-volume report prepared by the Commission on Canadian Studies chaired by Professor T.H.B. Symons (formerly President of Trent University). Between 1960 and 1980, many other cultural organizations \\"Canadianized\\" in one way or another. The movement has remained a subject of discussion in recent years, and the term \\"Canadianization\\" has been applied, often retrospectively, to analogous or similar movements.  The meeting at Carleton and five motions  \\"Canadianization\\" or the \\"Canadianization Movement\\" began when two Carleton professors circulated recommendations in a memorandum addressed to all members of the Carleton University Academic Staff Association (C.U.A.S.A.).\\"Memorandum to C.U.A.S.A. on de-Canadianization ‚Ä¶ .\\" in The Struggle for Canadian Universities: A Dossier eds. Robin Mathews and James Steele (Toronto: New Press, 1969), 15-20. This document noted there was strong evidence that Canadian citizens were becoming a rapidly diminishing proportion of the faculties of arts and science in Canadian Universities and requested a meeting of C.U.A.S.A. to discuss five remedial motions.Struggle. 19-20. Mathews and Steele first asked the University to ensure that, in hiring new professors, Canadian citizens would eventually form a two-thirds majority of faculty. Because this motion had no time limit, its recommendation was for a goal not a quota.See also \\"The Problem: a Statement by the Editors.\\" Struggle. 7. The second motion recommended that, before the appointment of a non-Canadian, a vacancy be well advertised in Canada. The other three asked that Canadian citizenship be made a necessary qualification for all future appointments to administrative positions, that Carleton keep a record of the citizenship of faculty, and that the Canadian Association of University Teachers (C.A.U.T.) gather information about the citizenship-composition of Canadian universities and \\"consider the formulation of a national policy with respect to this matter.\\" Adoption of these measures was intended to assure the place of Canadians as faculty members at Carleton University. = Reasons for the motions = Mathews and Steele argued that during the decade of the 1960s, Canadians had become an ever smaller proportion of faculty in Canadian universities. In 1961, census data indicated that the proportion of Canadians on faculty was about 75%. By 1967-68, there were strong indications that the proportion of Canadians in faculties of arts and science in some 15 universities had fallen to 49%.Struggle. 15-21; \\"Statistics, Numbers, Estimates [Correspondence between A.E. Safarian and James Steele].\\" in Struggle. 85-106\\" They noted in their Memorandum and in a later introductory chapter to their book that this decline in the proportion of Canadians had occurred in a national context of conditions that threatened Canada's sovereignty.\\"The Problem.\\" in Struggle. 1-11 Canada's status as a branch-plant economy had been described in the report of the Task Force on Foreign Ownership and the Structure of Canadian Investment headed by Professor Mel Watkins. Senator Grattan O'Leary had described the extent to which Canadian communication media had become inundated with American content. The two professors argued that the national allegiances of faculty members could affect scholarly priorities‚Äîa matter subsequently well discussed in relation to Political Science by two students at York University and the University of Toronto, James MacKinnon and David Brown.\\"Political Science in the Canadian University, 1969\\" in Struggle. 151-162. In later statements, Mathews and Steele observed that Canadian materials were often neglected in university departments employing few Canadian faculty.\\"The Universities: Takeover of the Mind.\\" in Close the 49th Parallel etc: The Americanization of Canada ed. Ian Lumsden (Toronto: Univ. of Toronto Press, 1970), 171-177; Robin Mathews. \\"Americanization of the Universities.\\" in The Star-Spangled Beaver. 24 Canadians Look South. ed. John H. Redekop (Toronto: Peter Martin Associates, 1971). 55-69. They likewise explained that many university positions in Canada were being filled without advertising in Canada. Instead, informal networks were frequently used to recruit scholars from outside the country. Yet Canadians were often prevented from competing in those same foreign jurisdictions because of exclusionary regulations and practices favoring the nationals of those countries. The two professors argued that their motions would help to level the playing field while providing ample space for the hiring of foreign applicants. They suggested that, if hiring practices were fair for Canadians, Canadian candidates would often be successful.Struggle. 2, 65; see also \\"History: A statement by Professor J. Laurence Black.\\" in Struggle. 175-177. Mathews and Steele recommended that university administrators be citizens of Canada for two reasons. This qualification would help to ensure that administrators, who are concerned with the logistics of scholarship, would be familiar with the needs and aspirations of the Canadian community. It would also guarantee that when administrators exercise regulatory, judicial, financial, and disciplinary powers they would have the civil qualification of at least a voter. Steele observed that making this civil status a requirement would also be in accordance with a recommendation of a former Ontario Chief Justice, the Honourable James Chalmers McRuer.\\"Article ... in the Toronto Daily Star, June 18, 1969.\\" in Struggle. 64-67.  Reception of the motions at Carleton  The memorandum and motions presented by the two men were greeted with general hostility at the C.U.A.S.A. meeting. Many colleagues argued that because scholarship, science, and learning are international and because some members of faculty were non- Canadian, the motions were anti-academic and offensive. The two proponents were accordingly described as racist, anti-American, immoral, and more. One colleague even attempted to present a motion to refer Mathews and Steele to the Ontario Human Rights Commission with the suggestion they should be criminally charged. Yet two of the few people who supported the motions were non-Canadians who understood the problem being addressed. The meeting ended with a vote to change and amend the recommendations in order to destroy their intention. The original motions were defeated by votes of 135 to five and even, in one case, by 138 to 2.\\"Extract form the minutes of the C.U.A.S.A. general meeting, December 11, 1969.\\" Struggle. 35-36. = Concern elsewhere = It later became evident that scholars in Canada in disciplines ranging from Chemistry to History to Zoology were concerned about the Canadianization problem but had not expressed their thoughts publicly.\\"Letters and Statements (written by scholars in a variety of disciplines).\\" Struggle. 165-179. At Carleton, the proposals were strongly supported by Professor Antonio Gualtieri, a member of Carleton's Department of Religion.\\"Academic Objectivity and the de-Canadianization of the University.\\" in Struggle. 57-60. See also his letters in Struggle. 127,129]. Even before the Carleton meeting, Professor Anthony Raspa discussed the problem publicly in Le Devoir.Anthony Raspa. \\"Le Colonialisme Am√®ricain dans les Universit√©s Anglophone,\\" Le Devoir Thursday, October 17, 1968, p.4. The negative response he elicited from colleagues was an early indication of the strong emotions it could arouse. Raspa, then a member of the English Department of Loyola College (now part of Concordia), had to contend with one \\"violent\\" colleague, with several others who signed a petition stating he \\"imperil[ed] the reputation of the College,\\" with a Chair who asked the College senate to investigate and possibly censure him, and with a President who informed him by letter‚Äîlater retracted‚Äîthat his teaching contract would not be renewed.For a record of these events, see C.A.U.T. Papers. Library and Archives Canada, MG28 I 208, Vol. 127. After completing his contract at Loyola, Professor Raspa, a distinguished Renaissance scholar, taught for many years at Dalhousie University, at the Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Chicoutimi and at Laval University. Between 1969 and 1972, Mathews and/or Steele spoke widely on the subject of Canadianization at teach-ins and/or special meetings, participating as guest speakers, individually or together, at many universities and colleges and occasionally at teacher conventions. (Institutions where they spoke included the following: the University of Victoria, the University of British Columbia, Simon Fraser University, Calgary University, the University of Alberta, the University of Saskatchewan, the University of Manitoba, the University of Toronto, York University, Queen's University, Seneca College, the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, McGill University, Bishop's University, Dawson College, Marianopolis College, Sir George Williams University, the University of New Brunswick, Mount Allison University, Dalhousie University, and Memorial University.) They also did radio, television, and print media interviews across the country so that the public could become aware of the problem.Robin Mathews Papers. Library and Archives Canada: MG31 D 190 [Vols/Boxes] 18-35; Jeffrey J. Cormier.

In addition to these public communications, Mathews corresponded privately with members of nearly all the institutions mentioned above as well as with members of a dozen other colleges and/or organizations. His correspondents included students, faculty members, chairs, and presidents; and his letters were about hiring practices and/or curricular matters.For a record of this correspondence, see the Mathews Papers. Library and Archives Canada: MG31 D 190 18-35. Many scholars wrote to Mathews and Steele requesting detailed information about the meeting at Carleton.Mathews and Steele. \\"The Problem.\\" Struggle. 9-10 Others, in letters and other publications, described a lack of employment opportunities for Canadians and lamented a lack of interest in Canadian matters in certain departments.\\"Letters and Statements.\\" Struggle. 165-181. After Mathews and Steele received so many requests for the information that the correspondence was becoming unmanageable, they edited The Struggle for Canadian Universities: A Dossier. As well as being a record of events at Carleton, it included a selection of correspondence and many related publications. In the age of the mimeograph machine, the purpose of the book was to meet numerous requests for information and to facilitate a process of reform.Mathews and Steele. \\"The Problem.\\" Struggle. 1-11.  Changes in hiring practices and curriculum  As news of the Carleton meeting was widely reported and hotly debated outside of academia, attention to the issue bore fruit. The federal department called Employment and Immigration Canada‚Äîthen referred to as the Department of Manpower and Immigration‚Äîintroduced rules to ensure fairer procedures in the hiring practices of Canadian universities. In 1977, it made the advertising of all vacancies mandatory,T.H.B. Symons. Some Questions of Balance: Human Resources, Higher Education and Canadian Studies (Ottawa: Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada [A.U.C.C.], 1984 [Symons Report Vol. III,]. 64. In 1977, Bud Cullen was the Minister of Manpower and Immigration (later renamed the Department of Employment and Immigration) when the advertising of university vacancies became mandatory. and in 1981 it stipulated that a search for Canadian applicants would be necessary before it would approve a job offer to a foreign candidate.\\"Hiring university faculty: A new 'Canadians first' policy\\" [Lloyd Axworthy interviewed by Donald C. Savage]\\" CAUT Bulletin ACPU, October 1981. 9-10. In 1969, the Canadian Association of University Teachers (C.A.U.T.) also published a position paper \\"'Canadianization' and the University\\" drafted by its Executive and Finance Committee. It re-affirmed the support of the C.A.U.T. for the advertising of all academic vacancies while asserting that \\"competence\\" should be the principal criterion in employing both Canadian and foreign scholars.Struggle. 116-119. In 1977, the C.A.U.T. published a revised \\"Guidelines on Canadianization and the University\\"‚Äîa policy statement recommending again that all vacancies be advertised and that \\"the appointment of a person who is not a Canadian or legally a resident of Canada should be justified to the satisfaction of a university or faculty committee.\\" Such appointment-review committees‚Äîone in each institution‚Äîshould likewise ensure (i)that Canadian citizens and landed immigrants are treated equally,(ii) that job descriptions are clearly stated (and not worded so as to place Canadians at an unfair disadvantage)and(iii)that an \\"active search\\" for a qualified Canadian for each position has been made.T.H.B. Symons. Some Questions [Symons Report III] Appendix I; see also section F As these changes in hiring procedures were being considered or introduced, \\"Canadianization\\" came to include more than a concern about hiring. It drew attention to the serious neglect of Canadian materials and courses across the Canadian university community and, of course, to the lack of materials (and knowledge about existing materials) available in libraries and archives. It came to include demands for a greater range and depth of course offerings that engage research and subject matter relating to Canada. For instance, Professor J. Laurence Black observed that in 1969 Laurentian University's Political Science department offered only a half course in Canadian government, its Geography department offered no courses in Canadian geography, and its English department offered none in Canadian literature.\\"History: A Statement by Professor J. Laurence Black . . .\\" in Struggle. 177. Professor R. L MacDougall noted that in the early 1970s, \\"undergraduate courses in Canadian literature represented only 8% of the total offerings of departments of English.\\"\\"Literature in English\\" The Canadian Encyclopedia (Edmonton: Hurtig Publishers, 1985) II, 1020. Courses in Quebec literature were also hard to find even in Quebec.Sinclair Robinson et al.

A copy is deposited in Library and Archives Canada. Between 1970 and 1980, through the work of scholars across the country and pressure from concerned students active in campus radio, campus newspapers, and student organizations, the Canadian content of Canadian university courses increased significantly. In 2006, when Steele and Mathews surveyed the calendar descriptions of courses in five disciplines at six universities for the years 1970, 1975, and 1980, they found that by 1975 the number of courses listing Canadian content had increased by 73% and that such courses had more than doubled by 1980.\\"Canadianization Revisited: A Comment on Cormier's \\"The Canadianization Movement in Context\\" Canadian Journal of Sociology / Cahiers canadiens de sociologie 31(4) 2006: 493-497. Responding to the wide-ranging debate and the growing concern over the inadequate study of Canadian matters in many disciplines, the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada (AUCC)--an organization of university executive heads representing their respective institutions‚Äîdecided to consider the question of Canadian resources for treating Canadian material.  The Commission on Canadian Studies  With an expectation of funding by the Canada Council, the AUCC decided in 1970 or even earlier to establish a Commission on Canadian Studies.\\"Letter to ...

Symons to serve as Chair.To Know Ourselves. I,2. The Commission was staffed with a research coordinator, four research associates, 10 research assistants, three consultants, and an advisory panel of 35. It held more than 40 hearings across the country, received \\"more than 1000 briefs and close to 40,000 letters.\\" It also had some 58 liaison persons in almost as many universities across the country.To Know Ourselves.

In 1976, the AUCC released the first two volumes of the Commission's report: To Know Ourselves: Report of the Commission on Canadian Studies or the Symons Report (as it is better known). It describes university hiring practices, analyzes the Canadian content in the courses of many different disciplines, and describes the state of \\"Canadian Studies\\" both within Canada and abroad. It also makes more than a 1000 recommendations for the addition of more Canadian content in teaching and research. It says little, however, about the responsibilities of university administratorsCarman Miller, \\"And what about university administrators, Tom?: A critical comment on the Symons Report.\\" McGill Journal of Education / Revue des sciences de l' √©ducation McGill, Vol. 12, n001 (1977): 170-176. or about their citizenship. The first two volumes of the Symons Report were also published in a shorter version two years later.The Symons report: an abridged version of volumes 1 and 2 of To Know Ourselves, the report of the Commission on Canadian Studies (Toronto: The Book and Periodical Development Council, 1978. In 1981, James E. Page, a consultant to the Commission, wrote Reflections on the Symons Report The State of Canadian Studies: A Report Prepared for The Department of Secretary of State of Canada.(Ottawa: Minister of Supply and Services Canada, 1981). In 1984, the Commission on Canadian Studies published a study by Professor Symons and James E. Page. This third volume of the Symons Report, entitled Some Questions of Balance: Human Resources, Higher Education and Canadian Studies, makes a plea‚Äîstill unanswered‚Äîfor \\"the collection of adequate statistical information about Canadian postsecondary education and about current and future requirements for highly qualified personnel.\\"Some Questions [Symons Report III,]. 15. The authors also discuss, among other topics, the historical context of Canadianization and the matter of citizenship. With respect to the latter, their recommendations include an endorsement of a later version of the C.A.U.T.'s \\"Guidelines on Canadianization and the University\\" (1977) (see section E above). They note, however, that neither university administrations nor faculty associations have given much support to these Guidelines in practice.Some Questions [Symons Report III]. 68. By 1984 \\"only one or two of the seventy Canadian universities and degree-granting institutions\\" had followed the C.A.U.T.'s second recommendation and established an appointments review committee which would monitor the wording of job descriptions for fairness to Canadians and ascertain whether or not the \\"appointment of a person who is not a Canadian or legally a resident of Canada\\" was justified.Some Questions [Symons Report III]. 69, and Appendix I. Although Symons and Page observe that university administrators had not adopted these reasonable employment practices, the third volume of their Report, like the first two, includes little discussion of this matter. After the Commission on Canadian Studies ended its work, Professor Symons transmitted its copious fonds to the archives of Trent University Library where they now occupy some 19 meters of shelf space in 73 boxes (see the list of Archival Sources below).  Related developments  The support of organizations outside the universities also helped to keep the debate alive and to keep public interest focused on the need for change. Help came from such associations as the Committee for an Independent Canada,\\"Committee for an Independent Canada.\\" The Canadian Encyclopedia (Edmonton, Alberta: Hurtig Publishers, 1985) I , 179. the Confederation of Canadian Unions, The Waffle in the New Democratic Party, and from some MPs in the House of Commons. The Progressive Conservative Robert Stanfield, Leader of the Opposition, asked a question about the subject in Question Period on April 24, 1969House of Commons Debates, 28th Parliament, 1st Session Vol.7, 7902. and soon thereafter discussed the problem at length in a speech to an Ottawa Rotary Club.\\"Statement by the Leader of the Opposition.\\" in Struggle. 76-77. On May 29, Mr. Mark Rose of the New Democratic Party spoke at length about matter in the House of Commons\\"Commons address by Mr. Mark Rose, M.P.\\" in Struggle. 78-83. and the Liberal government's Lloyd Axworthy, as responsible minister, put in place the regulations (as mentioned above) to assure a consistent policy of fairness to Canadian applicants for academic positions (see Part E). The years before 1968 had seen a growing concern with foreign participation in, especially, the economy of Canada and also with the state of Canadian social and cultural life. The famous Walter Gordon federal budget of 1963 (quickly withdrawn) sought to repatriate Canadian ownership of the economy and engendered an intense national debateWalter Gordon. A Political Memoir (Toronto, McClelland and Stewart, 1977), 143-156. and, ultimately, in 1968 the Watkins Report on foreign ownership.See the articles entitled \\"Economic Nationalism\\" and \\"Foreign Ownership and the Structure of Canadian Industry\\" in www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca The 1957 creation of the Canada Council for the Arts encouraged increased cultural activity, and so did the formation of provincial councils of the arts. Celebration of the Canadian Centennial in 1967 focused popular attention on the country and its achievements. A. Birnie Hodgetts had written What Culture?: What Heritage? A Study of Civic Education in Canada; the Report of the National History Project.Toronto: Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, 1968. Attention to Canadian sovereignty in all dimensions of Canadian life sharpened in the 1960s and continued after them. Concern with \\"Canadianization\\" was not confined to education and educational opportunities. A wide range of organizations concerned with Canadianization were formed. These included the Writers' Union of Canada, the National Farmers Union, the Confederation of Canadian Unions, the League of Canadian Poets, the Canadian Artists' Representation/Le Front des artistes canadiens (CARFAC), and the National Action Committee on the Status of Women (NAC), the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, the Canadian Liberation MovementRyan Edwardson. Canadian Content. 172. ‚Ä¶ and more. During the 1970s, interest in Canadianization was also spurred by the Cold War, then at its height. Canadians were aware that this conflict could have easily escalated, either by design or accident, into a nuclear war, which could have been a devastating, transpolar conflict fought mainly in Canadian skies. In this context, knowledge relating to Canada had a bearing on both personal and national survival. Many Canadians were concerned, for example, when contradictory answers to a question in theoretical physics‚Äîabout whether or not the Bomarc missiles stationed at North Bay in Northern Ontario, if armed with nuclear warheads, could successfully \\"cook\\" the incoming warheads of hostile missiles‚Äîwere given along national lines.Derek Manchester and Lynn Trainor. \\"The Forgotten Bomarc Story: Martin government should apply lessons of Bomarc to Bush's NMD [National Missile Defense]\\" CCPA [Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives] Monitor March, 2004.  Later discussion of Canadianization  Canadianization has remained a subject of both discussion and controversy, even while Canadian universities remain the most international in the world. In 1996, historian J.L. Granatstein describes the movement and its rationale in Yankee Go Home?: Canadians and Anti- Americanism.(Toronto: HarperCollins, 1996), 192-216. Jeffrey Cormier, a sociologist, analyses the campaign in a book-length study, The Canadianization Movement: Emergence, Survival, and Success (2004)--a work also concerned with the movement as it related to changing conditions of employment in Cormier's own discipline of Sociology. Cormier takes a wider view of the campaign in \\"The Canadianization Movement in Context\\" (2005).Canadianization Movement. 91-159. For other comments on Sociology, see T.H.B. Symons.

Paul Grayson and Dennis William Magill, One Step Forward, Two Steps Sideways: Sociology and Anthropology in Canada (An update of the 1975 Symons Report... prepared for the Canadian Sociology and Anthropology). Cormier takes a wider view of the campaign in \\"The Canadianization Movement in Context\\" (2005).Canadian Journal of Sociology / Cahiers canadiens de sociologie 2005 30(3): 351-370.

Dirk Hoerder, in From the Study of Canada to Canadian Studies: To Know Our Many Selves Changing Across Space and Time(2005), traces the history of Canadian studies from the early nineteenth century to modern times in an analysis written from a post-national and \\"transcultural\\" point of view.Augsburg: Wi√üner, 2005; Revised edition: Univ. of British Columbia Press, 2010.

Previously the building had been thought to be 17th century.Hubbard E, The Buildings of Wales: Clwyd, Penguin/ Yale 1986, 226 It has recently been restored by the Denbighshire County Council, with European and other grant funding, as part of a small workshop complex. Description It is a 5-bay cruck structure. The building was originally a house consisting of an inner room (one bay), a hall with passage (2 bays), and a cow house (2 bays).E Wiliam, Traditional Farm Buildings in North-East Wales (1982) p.89 The end gables were replaced in stone, probably in the 18th century with side walls that are 3-panel high timber-framing, infilled originally with brick nogging, resting on a plinth of rubble stonework. To the north side the timber-framing is largely intact, but to the south, much of the timber-framing has had to be replaced. Timbers at the upper end show signs of smoke blackening, indicating that it was formerly a house. Mortices survive for wind-braces ‚Äì two to each bay. The matching ‚Äòblades‚Äô of each cruck truss are sawn on only one surface, with the other surface curved. This is a result of the vertical separation of the matching curved branch that formed the cruck, after being cut from a tree..

The unit conducted crew training for special operations, then forward air control from 1970 through 1972. The unit was first activated as the 424th Night Fighter Squadron. The squadron was one of the first dedicated night fighter operational training squadrons of the Air Force. It trained replacement night fighter pilots who were then deployed overseas into combat until its inactivation in March 1944 due to a reorganization of Army Air Forces training units.Pape, Campbell & Campbell History =World War II= The squadron was activated on 24 November 1943 at Orlando Army Air Base, Florida as the fourth night fighter training squadron of the 481st Night Fighter Operational Training Group. Its mission was to be a Replacement Training Unit (RTU) for Night Fighter pilots. It accepted Army Air Forces Training Command's twin-engine flying training and B‚Äì25 transition school graduates and trained them as night fighter pilots. It was initially equipped with Douglas DB-7s and Douglas P-70s. As 1943 progressed additional aircraft and equipment arrived and the program expanded. In September, the first American-built dedicated night fighter began to arrive, the Northrup YP-61 Black Widow and a few production P-61As. In January 1944 the entire program moved to Hammer Field, California and was placed under IV Fighter Command. The move placed the squadron near Northrop manufacturing facility at Hawthorne, California and most programmed P-61 squadrons were planned for operations in the Pacific and China Burma India Theaters. In March 1944 the 420th was disbanded when the AAF found that standard military units, based on relatively inflexible tables of organization were proving less well adapted to the training mission. Accordingly, a more functional system was adopted in which each base was organized into a separate numbered unit during a reorganization of units in the United States.Craven & Cate, The squadron's personnel and equipment were transferred to Squadron C of the 450th Army Air Forces Base Unit (Night Fighter Replacement Training Unit). =Lineage= * Constituted as the 424th Night Fighter Squadron on 23 November 1943 : Activated on 24 November 1943 : Disbanded on 31 March 1944Maurer, Combat Squadrons, p. 521 * Redesignated 424th Special Operations Training Squadron on 9 June 1970 : Activated on 1 July 1970 : Redesignated 424th Tactical Air Support Training Squadron 15 Jul 1972 : Inactivated 31 Oct 1972 =Assignments= * 481st Night Fighter Operational Training Group, 24 November 1943 ‚Äì 31 March 1944 * 1st Special Operations Wing 1 July 1970Ravenstein, p. 3 * 68th Tactical Air Support Group, 1 January 1972 ‚Äì 31 October 1972 =Stations= * Orlando Army Air Base, Florida, 24 November 1943 * Hammer Army Airfield, California, 28 January‚Äì 31 March 1944 * Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, 1 July 1970 ‚Äì 31 October 1972Mueller, p. 141 =Aircraft Assigned= * P-70 Havoc, 1943‚Äì1944 * YP-61 Black Widow, 1944 See also * Operational - Replacement Training Units References ; Notes =Bibliography=  * External links Category:Tactical air support squadrons of the United States Air Force ","title":"424th Tactical Air Support Training Squadron"},{"id":"42851737","text":"The 2014 South Lakeland District Council election took place on 22 May 2014 to elect members of South Lakeland District Council in England.

Herk (or Isadore, Izzy; 1882 ‚Äì 5 July 1944) was a burlesque manager who played a major role in the evolution of this entertainment before World War II. His show at the Gaiety Theatre, closed in 1941, was the last burlesque show on Broadway. Early years Herk was born around 1880. Herk's first job was treasurer of the Valentine Theatre in Toledo, Ohio. He moved to Chicago and became the personal assistant of the producer Herman Fehr, head of the Empire burlesque circuit, or Western Wheel. In 1913 the Eastern and Western wheels were consolidated into the Columbia Amusement Company, headed by Samuel Scribner and Isidore Herk. The combined operation put on fairly clean shows, as had the Eastern Wheel. During World War I (1914‚Äì18) Hirk staged burlesque shows for the Empire circuit such as Pacemakers, which featured a game of strip poker played on stage. However, Herk was primarily a manager rather than a producer. American and Mutual wheels In May 1915 the Columbia circuit transferred its No. 2 circuit, the former Western wheel, which had forty theaters and thirty-four touring companies, to a new subsidiary corporation called the American Burlesque Association, or American wheel. Gus Hill was named president of the new entity. Herk was put in charge of the American wheel, set up to provide an illusion of competition. The American wheel played raunchier shows than its owner, with runways, hootchy-kootchy dancers and risqu√© comedians. Herk pointed out that \\"We're not producing Sunday school shows.\\" The American circuit faced competition from stock burlesque theaters like Minsky's Burlesque National Winter Garden, whose shows went farther than Columbia would allow, and had to close in 1922. Herk wanted to move into the more respectable vaudeville. In April 1922 Herk left Columbia and joined with the Shubert Organization and E. Thomas Beatty to form the Affiliated Theatres Corporation, which would book Shubert Advanced Vaudeville. Faced with fierce competition from the B.F. Keith circuit, the Shuberts closed their vaudeville operation in February 1923. Herk was left bankrupt. He moved to the newly formed Mutual burlesque circuit, then to the American circuit, and when that closed down back to the Mutual circuit. At the Mutual Herk cut costs, paid low salaries and eliminated elaborate costumes and scenery. Performers for the Mutual wheel became the first to expose their breasts. Billboard said the Mutual \\"polluted public morals\\". Herk said it was not musical comedy, but was the \\"jazz of American entertainment.\\" Herk claimed that these were \\"clean working class entertainments\\". The Mutual grew fast. With headquarters in New York, it began to buy up Columbia theaters across the country. In a few years Herk built up the Mutual to fifty franchises. In 1925 Herk ordered the Mutual houses to not engage any black acts or companies. By the mid-1920s cinemas were providing shows that combined film and live entertainment with ticket prices lower than any burlesque show. Columbia and Mutual merged in 1927 to form the United Burlesque Association. By the 1927‚Äì28 season the combined circuit was struggling financially. In 1930‚Äì31 the combined wheel decided to revive clean burlesque. The experiment failed and the circuit closed. Despite its low costs, the Mutual could not survive the Great Depression. Burlesque on Broadway In the 1930s Herk helped create the Burlesque Artists Association, a union. Around 1932 Herk rented the Central Theater on 42nd street, Manhattan, from the Shuberts. He was planning to open a burlesque house when he was bought out by the Minskys. In 1936 the police closed the burlesque show at the Gotham Theatre at 125th street in New York, the start of a move to clean up entertainment in New York. On 1 May 1937 New York fourteen burlesque theaters were forced to close when their licenses were not renewed. Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia said \\"This is the beginning of the end of incorporated filth.\\" On 3 May 1937 Herk, then owner of the Gaiety Theatre in Times Square, proposed a compromise where the shows would be cleaned up. For a few years the three remained houses were allowed to run under a system of self-censorship. Herk's show at the Gaiety Theatre finally closed in 1941, marking the end of burlesque on Broadway. Wine, Women and Song In 1942 Herk and the Shuberts co-produced a Broadway show called Wine, Women and Song, starring Jimmy Savo and Margie Hart. The show was advertised as a combination of vaudeville, burlesque and Broadway revue, and ran for seven weeks. The revue included striptease, which shocked some of the audiences. Wine, Women and Song was closed by court order in December 1942. Herk was convicted of presenting an indecent show and sentenced to six months in prison. Herk was then aged 59, and was suffering from a heart condition. The Billboard commented that \\"...his show was certainly clean when compared to the really dirty burly shows that played New York for years. In fact, Wine Women and Song was hardly obscene--it was just plain dull.\\" On 2 January 1943 Herk was released on bail so he could arrange a show similar to that for which he was convicted. The jury could then see the show in the surroundings in which it was presented, rather than rely on a verbal description. In the end, Herk was jailed for several months. Isadore H. Herk died in Post Graduate Hospital, New York, on 5 July 1944. He was aged 61.

(SPMCIL) is a Mini- Ratna Central Public Sector Enterprise (CPSE). It is a wholly owned by Government of India Schedule \\"A\\" Company of the Government of India and was incorporated on 13 January 2006 with its registered office at New Delhi. The Corporation is engaged in the manufacture / production of Currency and Bank Notes, Security Paper, Non-judicial Stamp Papers, Postal Stamps & Stationery, Travel Documents viz., Passport and Visa, Security Certificates, Cheques, Bonds, Warrants, Special Certificates with Security Features, Security Inks, Circulation & Commemorative Coins, Medallions, Refining of Gold, Silver and Assay of Precious Metals, etc. The company was formed in 2006 as the result of corporatisation of security presses and mints functioning under the Indian Ministry of Finance. It contains nine units, four mints, four presses and a paper mill.  History  The Corporation was incorporated by taking over two security presses at Nashik and Hyderabad, two currency note presses at Dewas and Nashik, four mints at Mumbai, Kolkata, Hyderabad and Noida and one security paper mill at Hoshangabad which were working under the direct administrative control of the Ministry of Finance and the Department of Economic Affairs. The Expenditure Reforms Commission in its 3rd Report dated 23 December 2000 gave a set of nine recommendations concerning mints and presses and suggested the exploration of the option of placing India Security Press, Nashik and four India Government Mints under a corporate body. The commission also recommended the government to explore the feasibility of the Department of Posts taking over the Security Printing Press at Hyderabad. The Commission further recommended for the two currency note presses at Dewas and Nashik to be transferred to the control of Bharatiya Reserve Bank Note Mundran Private Limited, setting up of a new security paper mill by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and phasing out or privatization of Security Paper Mill, Hoshangabad. Neither the RBI nor the Department of Posts agreed to take over the security presses as per the recommendations of the Expenditure Reforms Commission. The feasibility of hiving off the security paper mill at Hoshangabad could not fructify due to operational and logistic constraints. On subsequent review of functions and performance of the Units, it was realized that the main constraints in the existing system of keeping these units as government entities were low productivity, obsolete technology, outdated financial systems and procedures, besides delay in responding technologically to the challenges of counterfeiting. All these factors, in combination, were resulting in inefficient capacity utilization and consequential higher cost of production. = Corporatisation = In view of the above, the Industrial Finance Corporation of India (IFCI) Limited was appointed as consultant to study the working of the nine units and present a feasibility report for their corporatisation. Accordingly, it was decided to form a wholly owned corporation by taking over all the nine security presses/mints/security paper mill. The Union Cabinet in its meeting held on 2 September 2005 approved the formation of a wholly owned corporation, namely, the Security Printing and Minting Corporation of India Limited (SPMCIL). The corporation was incorporated under the Companies Act on 13 January 2006. Following the corporatisation of the India Security Press and the four India Government Mints on 10 February 2006, the newly constituted SPMCIL was saddled with excess and untrained manpower and outdated machinery.  Organisation structure  Corporate Structure of SPMCIL SPMCIL is headed by a board of directors, presided by the chairman and managing director. The other board members include three functional directors who head the departments of technology, finance and human resource. Apart from the four functional directors, two independent directors are nominated by the Ministry of Finance and one by the Ministry of External Affairs. The board also commissions a Chief Vigilance Officer (CVO) who heads the organisation's internal vigilance department. His functional responsibilities include managing production planning, maintenance, technology, R&D;, logistics, procurement and marketing.

Units  According to the information made available, SPMCIL broadly operates through four production verticals i.e. currency printing presses, security printing presses, security paper mill and India Government mints. = Currency Printing Presses = SPMCIL consists of two currency printing presses: the Currency Note Press (CNP) in Nashik and the Bank Note Press (BNP) in Dewas. The two units are engaged in production of bank notes for India as well as a few foreign countries including Iraq, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Myanmar and Bhutan. More than 40% of Currency Notes circulated in India are printed by the two units. These units are equipped with designing, engraving, complete Pre-printing and Offset facilities, Intaglio Printing machines, Numbering & Finishing machines etc. The CNP was established in 1928 as the first printing press for bank notes in India. They are currently responsible for the printing of the new 500 rupee notes following the demonetisation of the old 500 rupee and 1000 rupee note. Currency is also printed by the two presses of Bharatiya Reserve Bank Note Mudran Private Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Reserve Bank of India. They are currently responsible for the printing of the new 2000 rupee notes, and speculations suggest that the printing of the 500 rupee notes will also shift to these presses for better speed and fewer errors. BNP also has an ink factory that produces ink for security printing. = Security Printing Presses = There are two Security printing presses of SPMCIL, namely the India Security Press (ISP) at Nashik and Security Printing Press (SPP) at Hyderabad. These presses print the 100% requirement of passports and other travel documents, non-judicial stamp papers, cheques, bonds, warrants, postal stamps and postal stationery and other security products. The Security Printing Presses have the capability of incorporating security features like chemically reactive elements, various Guilloche patterns, micro lettering, designs with UV inks, bi-fluorescent inks, optical variable inks, micro perforation, adhesive/glue, embossing, die-cutting and personalization, etc. = Mints = SPMCIL comprises four units of India Government Mint located in the cities of Mumbai, Kolkata, Hyderabad and Noida. These mints produce circulation coins, commemorative coins, medallions and bullion, as required by the Government of India. = Paper mill = Security Paper Mill was established in 1968 at Hoshangabad, Madhya Pradesh. It produces papers for banknotes and non‚Äìjudicial stamps and further prints with new enhanced unit.

Description A female specimen with eggs protected by oostegites This species grows to a maximum length of 1.8 cm and is brown or greenish brown in colour. Distribution Orchestia gammarellus is widely distributed from Norway and Iceland in the north, in coastal waters of European countries, and down to southwest Africa. It also occurs in the Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea. Habitat This amphipod lives in a wide range of habitats, occurring in marine environments such as shallow waters, the intertidal zone, and in estuaries. It also lives in semi-terrestrial areas away from water, provided those areas are damp enough. It can be commonly found on shingle shores, under decaying debris concentrated around the high water mark. Role in plastic pollution A study by the University of Plymouth found that organisms such as O. gammarellus may contribute to the production of secondary microplastics. The creatures can shred discarded plastic bags of various sorts into around 1.75 million microscopic fragments. In the presence of a biofilm, this activity increased fourfold.

Background In the 7th century, the Turkic Empire (G√∂kt√ºrks) was divided into two rival states and eventually both states were defeated by Tang China. But both sections of the empire soon gained their independence. The eastern part was called Second Turkic (Kutluk Khaganate) and the western part Turgesh (or more loosely Onoq, the ten tribes which were dominated by the Turgesh). According to old Turkic traditions, the eastern sections were considered as the main khaganate and the western sections were considered as the vassals of the eastern section. Thus Turgesh leaders were apprehensive of the Kutluk Khaganate and they sought alliances (like Yenisei Kirghiz and Tang China) against the growing power of the east. Early moves Turgesh khagan Suoge (also called Soko) had given his brother Zhenu √ºl√º≈ü (fief). His brother however asked for more and fled to Kutluk Khaganate.G√ºmiliev, p369 Kapagan, the khagan of the Kutluk khaganate was occupied in the east (against Khitan people) and Suoge saw this as an opportunity to strike. The army of Turgesh and the allies was a large army. According to Bain Tsokto inscriptions its manpower was about 100,000.Ergin, p.58 Probably this figure was exaggerated, but it was certainly more powerful than the Kapagan's army of 20,000. Moreover, the khatun (queen) was dead and the khagan was busy in burial services. He appointed Tonyukuk the chancellor as the commander. Kapagan‚Äôs son Inel, as well as his nephews Bilge (both future khagans) and Kul Tigin, were with Tonyukuk. According to historian Lev Gumilev, Kapagan was not sure about the victory and Tonyukuk was given orders for attrition warfare. Battle The vanguard units of the Tonyukuk‚Äôs army won a minor victory against Turgesh vanguard units. But this victory demoralized the commanders in the Tonyukuk army who learned about the strength of the Turgesh army. Tonyukuk however was determined and attacked the Turgesh army. The final clash was in Dzungaria, close to the Bolchu River (probably Bolchu River was the former name of the Urungu River, Xinjiang, China). After two days' fighting Tonyukuk defeated the Turgesh army. Both the Turgesh khagan Suoge and his brother Zhenu were executed.Klyashtorny-Sultanov, p. 108 The other leaders of Onoq paid obedience and all western Turkestan fell under the Kutluk khaganate. According to Bain Tsokto inscriptions, Temir Kapig in Transoxania (now in Uzbekistan) was also captured.Elgin, p. 59 Aftermath Although Kapagan was able to unite all territory of the first Turkic Khaganate under his rule, Turkic rule in Transoxania was short. It was soon checked by the Arabs who were also conquering Transoxania from the south. Although Turkic prince K√ºl Tigin was able to save the Turkic army, Turkic hegemony diminished and Turgesh (now under Suluk) regained strength. In later years it was Suluk who fought against the invading Arabs.

The 2¬Ω-story wood frame house was built in 1867, by a farmer turned businessman and a prosperous owner of a factory and lumberyard, and is an exceptionally elaborate Italianate villa. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Description and history The Thomas Russell Hubbard House is located in a residential area northeast of downtown Manchester, on the north side of Myrtle Street and across Maple Street from Wagner Park. It is a 2¬Ω-story wood frame structure, with a complex roofline. It is notable for its four-story tower, with quoined corners and an open fourth level with round arch windows. It has the deep, bracketed eaves typical of the Italianate style, and irregular massing with many projecting sections. The interior of the house is a showcase of its original owner's lumber products, with high quality woodwork using a wide variety of woods, and fine marble fireplace surrounds. The house was built in 1867 on an entire city block of land purchased by Thomas Russell Hubbard in 1864 from the Amoskeag Manufacturing Company. Hubbard grew up on a farm, and was a self-made businessman producing wooden window sashes, doors, and window blinds, as well as operating a local lumber yard. When built, the house lot afforded fine views to west, over the Merrimack River to the nearby hills. A later owner of the house was David B. Varney, who served as mayor of Manchester in the 1890s. The house originally had a period carriage house, but that was demolished when the property was subdivided for further development.

Born and raised in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, Beatty graduated from Tuscaloosa High School in 1939. He was enrolled as a student at the University of Alabama when he and his friends listened to the news broadcast of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. They immediately went to Van De Graft Airfield and took the Army Air Corps Air Cadet entrance examination. He passed. After qualifying as a B-25 pilot, Beatty was sent to the Solomon Islands as part of the 69th Bomb Squadron of the 13th Air Force, where he flew 62 combat missions against Japanese air fields such as Kahili and Japanese shipping. He was sent home in 1944 to become a B-25 instructor at Turner Air Field in Albany, GA. He was discharged in 1945 and returned home to Tuscaloosa, where he took full advantage of the G.I. Bill to complete his studies at the University of Alabama. He received his B.S. in 1948. During 1949 he served as a Veterans Service Office and married Maude Applegate Beatty, also from Tuscaloosa, whom he met at the University. He enrolled in the University of Alabama School of Law in 1950. He graduated first in his class in 1953. Beatty practiced law in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, with the firm of Dominick, Rosenfeld & Nicol from 1953 to 1955. At the request of Dean Leigh Harrison, in 1955 Beatty left law practice and joined the faculty at the University of Alabama School of Law, where he taught until 1970. Again at Dean Harrison's suggestion, Beatty applied for and was awarded a Ford Foundation fellowship to pursue graduate studies at Columbia University during the school year 1958-9. He received his LL.M. from Columbia in 1959, and his J.S.D. from Columbia in 1964. His faculty advisor at Columbia was Herbert Wechsler. Beatty was a visiting professor of law at the University of Cincinnati School of Law during 1966-7. In 1970, he left Tuscaloosa to become Dean of the Walter F. George School of Law at Mercer University. Beatty left Mercer to become the Senior Trust Officer at Trust Company Bank in Macon. In 1974, he returned to Alabama to become an Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Civil Division under then Attorney General Bill Baxley (a former law student at Alabama). In 1975, he returned to Tuscaloosa to open a law firm. In 1976, a group of former students, including Edward L. Hardin, Jr., persuaded Beatty to enter the Democratic primary to run for a seat on the Alabama Supreme Court, which he won. The incumbent, Pelham J. Merrill, then retired, and Governor Wallace appointed Beatty on June 1, 1976, to serve the remainder of Merrill's unexpired term. Beatty was reelected in 1982, and retired from the court in 1989.

The property exhibits 150 years of agricultural history, with a well-crafted c. 1800 farmhouse built using regionally distinctive joinery skills. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Description and history The Kennedy Hill Farm is located in a rural setting in eastern Goffstown, on both sides of Kennedy Hill Road north of Addison Road. The property, now in size, includes the main house, a barn, and a 19th-century shed. Most of the land is open fields; Kennedy Hill Road is lined by a row of mature maples. The main house, located on the west side of the road, is a two-story wood frame structure, with a hip roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. The interior follows a central chimney plan, with parlors on either side. These rooms are richly decorated in Federal period wood carving that is stylistically distinctive to the region, with especially fine fireplace surrounds and window molding. The barn is located across the street. The main house was built c. 1800 by Thomas Kennedy, a joiner. Kennedy was a well-known and successful builder in the area, who was responsible for the construction of several area public buildings, including churches and town halls. The interior of this Federal- style house retains many examples of his craft, which is rooted in a melding of traditions from New England's early settlers and those of Scottish Presbyterians who settled Londonderry early in the 18th century.

Zawzani died in 1054.  Biography  Mahmud. =Origins and service under Mahmud= The son of a prominent religious scholar from Zawzan named Husayn or Hasan, Zawzani is first mentioned as serving as the lecturer to the sons of Sultan Mahmud's vizier Ahmad Maymandi, whom two of them are known; Abd al-Razzaq Maymandi and Sa'id Maymandi. However, when Ahmad Maymandi and his sons fell into disfavor and were imprisoned, Zawzani eulogized Ahmad's successor Hasanak Mikali. Zawzani later became the assistant of prince Mas'ud I, who then served as the governor of Herat. Zawzani quickly rose to high prominence, but this resulted in him being suspected of heresy by his jealous opponents. However, the historian Abul-Fazl Bayhaqi, who knew Zawzani, dismiss this accusation. =Service under Mas'ud I= Mahmud later died in 1030, and a civil war shortly ensured between his two sons, the youngest one being Mohammad Ghaznavi, and the oldest one being Mas'ud I. Zawzani, who supported Mas'ud I, left the Ghaznavid capital of Ghazni, and arrived to Damghan, where Mas'ud and his supporters were preparing an attack on Ghazni. Several other statesmen and military officers such as Ali Daya shortly joined Mas'ud, thus increasing his strength on his march to Ghazni. During this period, in the words of the historian Yusofi, \\"Zawzani became a sort of vizier and rose in prestige and influence. He also became feared, since he exercised his bent toward vengefulness, spite, and intrigue\\". Coin of Mas'ud I. Mas'ud I shortly marched towards the Ghazni, where he successfully defeated Mohammad and imprisoned the latter. He then had Hasanak, who had supported Mohammad, imprisoned in Balkh. Through the efforts of Zawzani, Mas'ud had Hasanak charged of infidelity, and had him executed. Meanwhile, Zawzani helped Ahmad Maymandi, who had been released from prison, to regain the vizier office. Although Ahmad did not trust Zawzani, appointed Zawzani as the chief administrator of the Ghaznavid army. Filled with dissatisfaction about the office, Zawzani used his angry mood to turn Mas'ud against the people he did not like. Despite the opposition of Ahmad, Zawzani managed to make Mas'ud regain riches from several officers which Mohammad had given to them in order to gain support. This choice heavily decreased the honor of Zawzani. Khorasan, Transoxiana and Tokharistan. In 1032, Zawzani managed to urge Mas'ud to assassinate the Ghaznavid governor of Khwarazm, Altun Tash, whom Zawzani suspected of treachery. However, Altun Tash managed to survive the assassination and have the assassin captured. Mas'ud, who feared that Altun Tash would declare independence after the failed assassination attempt, had Zawzani imprisoned at Marw in order to avoid a rebellion. He also took Zawzani's wealth and servants, which had spread in many places such as Marw, Nishapur, Ghur, Badghis, Ghazni, and Balkh. However, Zawzani was later freed, and after some time, once again rose into high favor under Mas'ud. In 1040, Zawzani succeeded the deceased Abu Nasr Mushkan as the chief secretary. During this period, Zawzani had good relations with the historian Abul-Fazl Bayhaqi, and helped him in some of his problems. Because of this, Bayhaqi also helped Zawzani in his secretarial tasks. In 1040, Zawzani was present at the disastrous Battle of Dandanaqan against the Seljuq Turks, who managed to emerge victorious during the battle. During the same period, a rebellion occurred under Abu'l-Fadl Kurnaki, which Zawzani was blamed for by Mas'ud, and was dismissed from his office, and sent to Bust. However, the army of Mas'ud shortly revolted against him, and had his brother Mohammad restored to the Ghaznavid throne. Mohammad then had Mas'ud imprisoned at Giri, where he was shortly executed either on the orders of Mohammad or Mohammad's son Ahmad. = Service under Mawdud and the latter's successors = Mas'ud's son Mawdud, shortly avenged his father's death by defeating and killing Mohammad. He then crowned himself as the new ruler of the Ghaznavid Empire, and restored Zawzani to the chief secretary office. After this, Zawzani is much less mentioned in sources, but is known to have been living during the reign Sultan Mas'ud II, Ali, Abd al-Rashid, Toghrul, and Farrukh-Zad. Zawzani later died in 1054.

Estimated to have been built c. 1740, this 1-1/2 story Cape style house is one of the oldest buildings in Nashua, and one of a small number of houses from that period in the region that is relatively unaltered. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. Description and history The Killicut-Way House is located in a residential subdivision south of the Everett Turnpike and east of East Dunstable Road in southern Nashua, at the very end of Tempo Drive. (Old House Lane appears to be a truncated roadway that formerly ran perpendicular to Tempo Drive.) The house is 1-1/2 stories in height, with a timber frame, gabled roof, central chimney, and shingled exterior. The wooden shingles cover what appears to be the house's original exterior siding, variable width wooden planking. The main entrance is at the center of its three-bay facade, with an original vertical board door fastened by iron hinges. A four-light transom window separates the doorway from the eave. Windows are sash, set close to the eave on the front and back. The interior follows a typical central chimney plan, with a narrow entry vestibule, parlor spaces to either side of the chimney, and a long kitchen space behind it. Some of the rooms still have original wide floor boards, and the southwest parlor retains original carved paneling. The house's exact construction date is not known. Long thought to have been built in the late 17th century or around 1700, its construction methods suggest a later date. If it was built by Killicut, it must date to no earlier than the 1740s, when Thomas Killicut, the first of the family to settle here, arrived. Killicut served in the French and Indian War as one of Rogers' Rangers, and also in the American Revolutionary War. The house remained in the hands of Killicut descendants into the 20th century. It is one of two 18th-century houses in Nashua.

The former are metasediments of the Burundian and Malagaarasian Supergroups which are of Meso- and Neoproterozoic age, respectively. Granites intrude the rocks from the Burndian Supergroup along a 350 km zone of mafic and ultramafic intrusions. Just like Tanzania, the Malagarasian Supergroup has Neoproterozoic rocks. The top of this group contains the Kibago Group, which consists of sandstones, quartzites, shales, and a basal conglomerate. The Western Rift around and northwards of Bujumbura is partly filled by Cenozoic sediments.  Tectonics  A fault system crosscuts the Kibaran Belt in the center of the country from North to South, and is known as the N-S accident. The fault system is either a late Kibaran suture or a late Kibaran lateral strike-slip deformation.  Economic geology  Minerals are not a significant contributor to Burundi's economy, accounting for less than 1% of GDP. Although insignificant to the country's output, mining began in the 1920s. Among other minerals, mining in Burundi yields tungsten, tin, tantalum and niobium and possesses resources of nickel, uranium and rare earths. The mineral and petroleum industry is mostly stagnant due to poor infrastructure and transportation, as well as a civil war that has been occurring since the 1990s. Many studies into mineral extraction feasibility have occurred, including gold lodes near Myinga and alluvial gold deposits in the northwest. Nickel laterite has been found near Musongati that could yield 30,000 mt/a of ore.

He was involved in the Coorg War of 1834 and the town of Kushalnagar was for sometime named after him as Fraserpet. James was born at Edinburgh, the youngest son of Colonel Charles Fraser belonging to the Clan Fraser of Lovat, a naval officer who later joined the Madras army who died at Masulipatnam on 5 May 1795. James was one of six sons and three daughters through his wife Isabella Hook. James went to school at Ham, Surrey before joining Glasgow University where he showed a talent in languages and astronomy. Joining as a cadet, he went to India in 1799 and became a lieutenant in the 18th Madras native infantry by December 1800 before becoming an aide-de-camp to Sir George Barlow. His knowledge of French led him to be involved in discussions and negotiations with the French in Pondicherry. While posted at Pondicherry, he married Henrietta James at Cuddalore on 18 May 1826. In 1828 he was deputed to Mah√© and made a special agent. In 1834 he saw action in the Coorg War and was appointed resident at Mysore and commissioner of Coorg on 6 June 1834. Coorg was administered from Mercara most of the year but during the monsoon, the office was shifted west to Kushalnagar which went for a period by the name of Fraserpet. He became a major-general by June 1838, considered a rapid rise for that time. From the end of 1839 he served as Resident at Hyderabad in the Nizam's kingdom. This period was a difficult one and disputes with Lord Dalhousie led him to resign in 1852 and return to England.

The Weather Channel has been empirically shown, and has also admitted, to having a wet bias in the case of low probability of precipitation (for instance, a 5% probability may be reported as a 20% probability) but not at high probabilities of precipitation (so a 60% probability will be reported as a 60% probability). Some local TV stations have been shown as having significantly greater wet bias, often reporting a 100% probability of precipitation in cases where it rains only 70% of the time. Discovery In 2002, Eric Floehr, a computer science graduate of the Ohio State University, started collecting historical data of weather forecasts made by the National Weather Service, The Weather Channel, and AccuWeather for the United States, and collected the data on a website called ForecastWatch.com., Page 131-136 Floehr found that the commercial forecasts were biased: they consistently predicted a higher probability of precipitation than actually occurred. The National Weather Service forecasts were unbiased, whereas those at The Weather Channel were biased for low probabilities of precipitation: when the Weather Channel predicted a 20% probability of precipitation, it had historically rained only 5% of the time, but a 70% probability of precipitation could be taken at face value. Blogger Dan Allan noted that The Weather Channel is also biased at the upper end: a probability of 90% or higher will be rounded up to 100%. On the other hand, local TV stations tended to exaggerate the probability of precipitation throughout (except when they forecast a probability of 0%, in which case it still rained about 10% of the time). The findings on wet bias, though informally well known within the weather forecasting community for some time, were first popularized outside the weather forecasting community in Nate Silver's 2012 book The Signal and the Noise. The term wet bias is used because this is a systematic bias in the direction of the weather being wetter than it actually is. Reasons for wet bias According to Silver, The Weather Channel has openly admitted to deliberately exaggerating the probability of precipitation when it is low. This is because of biased incentives: if the correct low probability of precipitation is given, viewers may interpret the forecast as if there were no probability of rain, and then be upset if it does rain. In other words, The Weather Channel compensates for the people that have greater loss aversion than they think they do, and therefore miscalculate their cost-loss ratio when it is low, by deliberately inflating probabilities. Silver quotes Dr. Rose of The Weather Channel as saying, \\"If the forecast was objective, if it has zero bias in precipitation, we are in trouble.\\" References Category:Bias Category:Precipitation Category:Weather forecasting ","title":"Wet bias"},{"id":"42852511","text":"The 481st Night Fighter Operational Training Group (481 NFOTG) was a unit of the United States Army Air Forces. It was inactivated on 31 March 1944 at Hammer Field, California. The group was the primary night fighter Operational Training Unit (OTU)/Replacement Training Unit (RTU) of the Army Air Forces during World War II. Its mission was to train either new graduates of Training Command advanced flying schools or transition experienced pilots into the P-61 Black Widow night fighter. It trained them in the flight characteristics of the aircraft and also night fighter interceptor techniques prior to the operational squadrons or replacement pilots being deployed to one of the overseas combat theaters. History =Origins= Specialized training in night fighter interceptor tactics began in March 1942 upon the return of Air Corps observers from England prior to the United States' entry into World War II. During World War I, the 1st Pursuit Group 185th Aero Squadron had flown night interception of enemy aircraft, primarily bombers and observation aircraft. It was engaged in combat for less than a month before the 1918 Armistice with Germany.Series \\"E\\", Volume 27, Supplemental History of the 10th‚Äì636th Squadrons. Gorrell's History of the American Expeditionary Forces Air Service, 1917‚Äì1919, National Archives, Washington, D.C. In the 1920s and 1930s night fighting became the responsibility of regular Pursuit squadrons. These units had enough problems preparing for day war, much less confronting the obstacles of darkness. Yet, despite minimal budgets, pioneering airmen still strove to conquer the night by developing blind-flying techniques, primarily at the Army Air Service‚Äôs Engineering Division at McCook Field, and later at the Army Air Corps‚Äô Materiel Division at Wright Field, both in Ohio. Upon review of the recommendations presented by the observers, the Air Defense Operational Training Unit was established by Third Air Force on 26 March; it was re-designated as the Interceptor Command School on 30 March. Initially established at Key Field, Mississippi, the school was moved to Orlando Army Air Base, Florida.Northrop P-61 Black Widow‚ÄîThe Complete History and Combat Record, Garry R. Pape, John M. Campbell and Donna Campbell, Motorbooks International, 1991. \\"To fly these night fighters, the United States needed a different breed of aviator. So difficult and dangerous was the assignment that the AAF relied on volunteers only. Yet the mission was so exciting that there were always plenty of volunteers.\\"McFarland p16 V Interceptor Command was given initial responsibility for night training at Orlando. En route to the Philippines in 1941 when the Japanese launched their invasion, the unit was ordered back to Orlando, Florida, to train personnel for defense wings. =Operational/Replacement Training= Army Air Force School of Applied Tactics Night Fighter Training began in July, 1942 at the Fighter Command School, Night Fighter Division, Army Air Force School of Applied Tactics (AAFSAT) at Orlando Army Air Base, Florida. AAFSAT was ordered to develop a training program to produce pilots with night fighting skills. Immediate requirements were to train night fighter pilots for two operational squadrons that were destined for Hawaii and for Panama. By the end of September, AAFSAT had re-designated the program as the Night Fighter Department (Dark) and the first training was carried out by the 50th Pursuit Group, which was assigned to the AAFSAT Fighter Command School. Initially, the school received a B-18 Bolo and a number of Douglas P-70 Havocs to initiate the program. Production delays at Northrop for the P-61 Black Widow fighter aircraft required the unit to use what it had until the first YP-61s were received in early 1944. In October, it was decided to form specialized night fighter training squadrons, and the 348th and 349th Night Fighter Squadrons were formed, largely from elements of the 50th Fighter Group, 81st Fighter Squadron. In January 1943 the school was expanded from Orlando to Kissimmee Army Airfield due to the expansion of AAFSAT and the Fighter Command School. At Kissimmee, the first operational night fighter combat squadrons were activated (414th and 415th NFS) and Operational Training was carried out. Each squadron was manned with graduates of Training Command's twin-engine flying training and Training Command‚Äôs B‚Äì25 transition school before beginning night fighter training. Once accepted for night fighter training, the student received eight weeks of training in the Douglas DB7 or P-70s. Training consisted of two phases; night flying and night fighting. First came 78 daylight flying hours and 137 hours of ground school, followed by 76 flying hours and 30 hours of ground school in night fighting. Subjects included instruments, airborne radar, night navigation, meteorology, aircraft recognition, searchlight coordination, and ground control radar coordination. Lacking real nighttime combat experience, the AAF created a training program that was ad hoc from the beginning. In all, the night fighter crew would receive 93 hours of instrument flying, 90 hours in a Link trainer, 15 hours of night interceptions, and 10 ground control radar intercepts. The initial group of four squadrons (414th, 415th, 416th and 417th NFS) were the first graduates of the hastily organized training program at Orlando. When deployed to England, they were sent with the P-70 night fighters they trained in, however, when they got there, these squadrons were re-equipped with used Bristol Beaufighter Mk VIF radar-equipped nightfighters obtained from Britain under Reverse Lend-Lease. From there they were deployed to their combat assignments with Twelfth Air Force in North Africa to provide protection for the combat airfields in Algeria and Tunisia against Luftwaffe night attacks.Thompson and Stalling (1998), P-61 Black Widow Units of World War 2 (Osprey Combat Aircraft 8), Osprey Publishing, On 1 April 1943, AAFSAT expanded the Night Fighter Division, placing it under the Air Defense Department, and transferred all training from the Night Fighter Section to the new Division. Beginning in May 1943, orders from HQ AAF were received that the training needed to be expanded to accommodate one new night fighter squadron per month. The school at Kissimmee was expanded with a third OTU, the 420th Night Fighter Squadron at Dunnellon Army Air Field. With the expansion of the Night Fighter Training Division, tasks were divided into three major functions. The 348th NFS at Orlando AAB provided the initial Operational Training for new Training Command pilots. The 349th at Kissimmee AAF carried out two-engine transition training, while the 420th at Dunnellion AAF provided Replacement Training (RTU). On 15 July 1943, the 481st Night Fighter Operational Training Group was activated to give the school better organizational structure. In September, the first American-built dedicated night fighter, the Northrup YP-61 Black Widow, began to arrive. The YP-61 and a few production P-61As were assigned to the school for both the training programs as well as flight-testing of various turret/gun configurations. Also a second RTU was established in November when the 424th Night Fighter Squadron was formed. The SCR-720 Radar Operators for the P-61 were first sent to the Radar School at Boca Raton AAF then came back to Orlando for flight training. The second group of squadrons (418th, 419th, and 421st NFS) completed their training in the YP-61 and were sent to the Pacific Theater in November and December, operating from bases on Guadalcanal and New Guinea. Fourth Air Force With the arrival of the P-61 Black Widow, it was decided to move the school to California. This would situate the school closer to the Northrup manufacturing plant at Hawthorne, and was more efficient because the new squadrons programmed for Operational Training would be deploying to either the Pacific or CBI Theaters and would depart from the US west coast. In addition, the Air Staff had decided that the School of Applied Tactics should not be in the training business, although the SCR-720 radar training program would remain at Orlando due to its proximity to the basic Radar School at Boca Raton Army Airfield. The 481st NFOTU and its training squadrons were moved to Hammer Field, near Fresno California on 1 January 1944 and were placed under Fourth Air Force IV Fighter Command. Under the overall supervision of Fourth Air Force night fighter crews were organized into squadrons and entered three phases of training. Phase One consisted of familiarization training at Bakersfield Municipal Airport. Phase Two was designed to weld pilots and R/Os into teams, and included instruction at Hammer Field, while Phase Three consisted of advanced training, including intensive night flying practice, and took place at Salinas Field. Each phase lasted approximately one month. Finally, after two more months of organizational training at Santa Ana Field, the night fighter squadrons were ready for transfer overseas. The third group of squadrons, trained both in Florida and California, were sent to England as part of Ninth Air Force shortly before D‚ÄìDay. They would be employed after the Normandy Invasion to initially provide night air defense over France. Three months after the move to California, on 31 March the 481st was disbanded when the AAF found that standard military units, based on relatively inflexible tables of organization were proving less well adapted to the training mission. Accordingly, a more functional system was adopted in which each base was organized into a separate numbered unit during a reorganization of units in the United States. The 319th Wing, activated on 1 April, took over the duties of the 481st, disbanding the group and all of its squadrons on 31 March. It was replaced by the 450th Army Air Forces Base Unit (Night Fighter Replacement Training Unit) as the P-61 RTU, and the squadron designations replaced by letters (A, B, C, D). The 319th Wing completed training for six new Night Fighter Squadrons: the 426th, 427th, 547th, 548th, 549th, and 550th which deployed to both the China and Pacific Theaters. A major new mission for the units was to protect the new XX Bomber Command B-29 bases in China and later in the Marianas from Japanese night attacks. The unit transitioned to replacement training (RTU) only on 1 December 1944 when the 550th Night Fighter Squadron was deployed to New Guinea, ending the Operational Training Mission. The training syllabus was expanded in early 1945 to include training in offensive day and night interdiction missions, as by this point in the war, enemy aircraft attacks at night were becoming less and less frequent. The well-armed P-61s carried out attacks on shipping, railroads and enemy movements, both day and night, with devastating effect.

Headquartered at the Ohio History Center in Columbus, Ohio, Ohio History Connection provides services to both preserve and share Ohio's history, including its prehistory, and manages over 50 museums and sites across the state. An early iteration of the organization was founded by Brigadier General Roeliff Brinkerhoff in 1875. Over its history, the organization changed its name twice, with the first occurring in 1954 when the name was shortened to Ohio Historical Society. In 2014, it was changed again to Ohio History Connection, in what members believed was a more modern and welcoming representation of the organization's image. History 1898 seal of The Ohio State Archaeological and Historical Society In its early history, Ohioans made several attempts to establish a formal historical society. On February 1, 1822, the Ohio General Assembly passed legislation creating the Historical Society of Ohio. Well-known Ohio political leaders at the time, Jeremiah Morrow and Duncan McArthur, were members. The society's formation was brief, however, as it held only one meeting. The state legislature made another attempt in 1831, when it authorized Benjamin Tappan to form its replacement. He established the Historical and Philosophical Society of Ohio, which met regularly in Columbus. Participation declined sharply following the Panic of 1837, and the organization decided to move to Cincinnati in 1848 in hopes that the city's larger population would help revive interest. The decision led to period of prosperity for the organization, and it worked closely with the Cincinnati Historical Society for many years. In 1875, a new organization called the Archaeological Society was founded in the home of Brigadier General Roeliff Brinkerhoff in Mansfield, Ohio. The Ohio state legislature had procured $2,500 in funds, at the request of General Brinkerhoff, to finance the creation of an exhibit for the upcoming Centennial International Exhibition of 1876 in Philadelphia. The society was active until 1883 when its secretary, Professor John T. Short of the Ohio State University, died. It was revived two years later at the request of Governor George Hoadly, who organized two meetings in the state's capital with scholars and professors from around the state. Sixty men attended the second meeting which had sessions spanning two days. On March 13, 1885, the Ohio State Archaeological and Historical Society was officially incorporated. Allen G. Thurman was elected its first president. The state government began appropriating funds to assist the private organization in 1888. This led to a closer partnership with the state, in which the government was permitted to appoint six of the fifteen members serving in the board of trustees. It also led to the organization being granted oversight responsibilities for historical sites across Ohio, beginning with Fort Ancient State Memorial in 1891. The Ohio State Archaeological and Historical Society was originally headquartered at the Ohio Statehouse but later moved to Ohio State University's Orton Hall in 1894. On May 30, 1914, the organization dedicated the Ohio State Archaeological and Historical Society Building, a large museum building by Orton Hall. The society stayed at the building until 1970, when the facility became part of OSU and was renamed Sullivant Hall.https://library.osu.edu/biclm/history-of- sullivant-hall In 1954, the organization's name was shortened to Ohio Historical Society. On May 24, 2014, the name was changed again to the Ohio History Connection, after research suggested that \\"society\\" carried a negative connotation. The organization's image as a whole was perceived as \\"exclusive, inaccessible and antiquated\\", and the rebranding was an attempt to better reflect the organization's mission from a modern perpective and appeal more inviting to the state's citizens. The change was also part of a national trend that saw historical societies across the United States drop \\"society\\" from their title. the Ohio History Connection manages 58 museums and historical sites across Ohio, spanning 40 of the state's 88 counties. This includes approximately 1.6 million artifacts, of stored records, and 250,000 images. Also from 2010‚Äì2014, membership of the nonprofit organization increased more than 20 percent to a total of 7,563. Ohio History Center The Ohio History Center in Columbus, Ohio The Ohio History Connection operates dozens of state historic sites across Ohio. Its headquarters is the 250,000-square-foot (23,000 m¬≤) Ohio History Center in Columbus, Ohio, a Brutalist concrete structure. Extensive exhibits cover Ohio's history from the Ice Age to the present. The Center includes state archives and library spaces, a gift shop, and administrative and educational facilities. The 1989 Smithsonian Guide to Historic America described the Center as \\"probably the finest museum in America devoted to pre-European history.\\" The society's first permanent home was in Sullivant Hall on the Ohio State University campus. The society operated a museum and library there. Later, the archives moved to the Old Governor's Mansion on Broad Street. In 1965, voters approved a bond for a new structure to be built. W. Byron Ireland designed a Brutalist building with post-tensioned concrete structures, allowing for a cantilevered design. The building remains mostly as built, including its exterior use of silo tiles made in Ohio. Ohio Village Ohio Village, a reconstructed 1890s-era town, is a living museum area of the Ohio History Center campus. In 2002, budget cuts forced the Ohio Village to close except for special events, school and tour groups. In the summer of 2012, it reopened to the public, relying on volunteers instead of paid staffing, who purchase their own costumes and dedicate at least 16 hours of work per season. The Ohio Village attempts to \\"animate history\\" in the sense of taking what is perceived as one-dimensional and converting it into three dimensions, with the volunteers portraying characters that represent people who truly existed during the mid-to-late 19th century. It is open to the public from Memorial Day weekend through Labor Day weekend and for special events such as All Hallows Eve and Dickens of a Christmas. The village houses home games for the Ohio Village Muffins, a vintage base ball club formed in 1981 that competes each year against other vintage teams from Ohio and around the country. The team's name is derived from the phrase muff, a term often used during the era to refer to an \\"error\\". A team's third string was typically labeled the \\"muffin nine\\". The Ohio Village Muffins promote the preservation of the game as it was played in 1860, using underhanded pitching, foregoing the use of gloves, and wearing uniforms that match the time period. Ohio Village also hosts a women's team called The Diamonds. A league for women, as teams formed at colleges across the country, began in 1866. Ohio History Connection resources The Ohio History Connection also provides educators with resources for the state's schools. Field trips, outreach programs, and educational kit trunks are available to assist teachers with supplemental learning in their classrooms. Also offered are distance learning courses. Affiliated with the Ohio History Connection is the Ohio Educational Resources Center, which loans materials to assist teachers with their lessons. The society also provides public programs that include speakers, theatrical productions, conferences, workshops, holiday gatherings, and presentations. The topics of these programs range from the Underground Railroad to the role of the state in other historical events. The Ohio History Connection publishes Ohio History Central, an extensive online encyclopedia of Ohio history. Ohio History Central consists of over 3,000 entries about Ohio's natural history, prehistory, and history. The entries are complemented by nearly 2,000 images. The site is fully searchable, and users may browse entries by category, topic, media, time period, or geographic region within the state. Special features include image galleries, Ohio Quick Facts, Ohio Across Time (a time line of events that occurred in Ohio or that impacted Ohio‚Äôs history), and Useful Links (to Ohio History Connection websites; Ohio county and local history websites; and other state, municipal, and regional encyclopedias). Registered users can also create personal scrapbooks using any of the encyclopedia's entries and images.

Long Plain First Nation (Ojibway) is a First Nation identified by AANDC as Indian Band No. 6. The community is located in the Central Plains region of Manitoba, to the southwest of Portage la Prairie along the Assiniboine River, and lies between the Rural Municipality of Portage la Prairie and the Rural Municipality of South Norfolk. Each year before the celebration, Long Plain celebrates their Annual Treaty Day which commemorates the signing of Treaty #1 that took place on August 3, 1871. The main pow wow event is planned by a volunteer pow-wow committee that gathers for meetings throughout the year. The goal of the pow- wow each year is to be bigger and better. Along with the many dancers and singers from United States and Canada, the event includes the Friday Midnight Men's Fancy Dance special. The dance competitions are judged by Long Plain band members and since the band members do not compete they have a showcase of local dancers.

The Libyan parliament designated much of the Libya Shield Force as terrorist and elements of the Libya Shield Force were identified as linked to al-Qaeda as early as 2012. Since the outbreak of the Second Libyan Civil War, the Libya Shield Force has been associated with the Islamic fundamentalist side. In 2019, it reportedly aided the Government of National Accord in defending Tripoli from an LNA offensive.

Although some buildings are ruined, the church and accommodation buildings have been restored. The monastery was founded in 1794 by a group of Kollyvades monks, who had left the monastery of Mount Athos after disagreements about matters of Christian ritual. They were led by an ordained monk, Niphon of Chios, and included Gregorios Hatzistamatis, a local monk who had inherited land on Skiathos from his father. In 1807, a group of Greek freedom fighters met at the monastery and swore the Oath of Freedom on a newly designed Greek flag, a white cross on a sky-blue background, which was woven on a loom at the site. The fighters included Theodoros Kolokotronis, Andreas Vokos Miaoulis, Thymios Vlachavas, Nikotsaras and others. The Catholicon of the monastery is a Byzantine-style cross-in-square three-aisled church, with three domes, and stands at the centre of the complex. The iconostasis is wood carved and bears icons dating from the 17th and 18th centuries. The loom on which the first Greek flag was made. The museum houses ecclesiastical artefacts and presents information on the history of the Monastery such as priests' vestments, rare books and manuscripts from the 17th century, gospels from the 18th century, silver and wooden crosses and Byzantine icons. The loom on which the first Greek flag was created can be seen. There is also a photographic record of the subsequent Greek War of Independence, which lasted from 1821 until 1829. Vineyards have been created for the production of Alypiakos, a red Muscat which was first produced on the island in the 5th century BC. The wine is named after Father Alypos, the fourth abbot of the monastery. Output has increased year on year, some of which is used within the Monastery on religious occasions. Today, the monastery is served by only four resident monks; three others associated with the monastery reside elsewhere. On 15 August each year the ceremony of the Annunciation of the Virgin Mary takes place. Access is by foot from Skiathos town up a steep metalled road or by public minibus from Skiathos town bus terminus. Entrance to the monastery itself is usually free.

Plot In Paris, Lucas is a talented and successful computer scientist who is diagnosed with a rare and fatal brain disorder, which means he will rapidly lose his memory and his ability to speak coherently. Going from the hospital to a caf√©, he is struck by a beautiful but eccentric young woman called Blanche. When she walks out on him just after he orders them dinner, he waits in the street until dawn. Driving by, she stops and weeps at his devotion, but has to go to work. Her job is in a hotel at Biarritz, where she does a clairvoyant act removing her clothes. He follows her there and takes a luxury suite. At dawn she comes in exhausted and falls asleep. Just after he orders them breakfast she walks out, not realising that his awkward remarks are through failing mental powers. Later she returns and the two make love. She too is under heavy stress, forced by her promiscuous mother into an exploitative act she detests. That night she breaks down on stage and at dawn comes to find Lucas.

The road was expanded after an ambush near Kiryat Arba that took place in November 2002. The expansion required that adjacent Palestinian land be expropriated, which resulted in a legal battle.

PDF Kiryat Arba was built at the edge of the area which the 1967 Allon Plan envisioned as being annexed to Israel, while Hebron itself would be part of an enclave with Palestinian self-rule. Originally, the settlers used a route running from the northern entrance via Al-Shuhada Street (which was closed to Palestinians) to the Cave of the Patriarchs.

Plans after the 2002 Hebron ambush One day after the 2002 Hebron ambush, Zvi Katzover, the head of Kiryat Arba, called on the government to \\"clean up the area\\" between Kiryat Arba and the Tomb of the Patriarchs and to destroy the hundreds of Palestinian homes along this short stretch of road.PM calls for territorial continuity from Kiryat Arba to Hebron.

He said that ‚Ä≥a window of opportunity existed in the coming 48 hours to establish a \\"compact\\" zone of Jewish territorial contiguity between Kiryat Arba and the Jewish enclave in the heart of Hebron, including the Tomb of the Patriarchs‚Ä≥.

Contradictory to the original promenade plan, 22 buildings of architectural and historical value, dating back to the Mamluk-Ottoman period would be demolished in the old town of Hebron \\"for military needs\\". A 730 meters long and 6 to 12 meters wide corridor was planned on 8.2 dunams of expropriated land, about a quarter of which in the old town of Hebron. According to the High Court, the total width of the alley was originally planned to amount 8 meters. Thirteen buildings along the south‚Äìwestern part of the route were to be demolished, and a concrete wall was to be built along the north‚Äìeastern part of the route. According to the American administration and Israeli sources close to the planning, the aim of the expropriation of the land and the building of the promenade was to create territorial contiguity between Kiryat Arba and Hebron.

Haaretz, 10 December 2002 On 11 December 2002, the Municipality of Hebron and Palestinian landowners issued a petition (HCJ 10497/02) at the High Court against the sequestration. Another petition (HCJ 10356/02) was issued by Israeli conscientious objectors of Yesh Gvul.

Yossi Wolfson, HaMoked: Center for the Defence of the Individual, 1 December 2012 In February 2003, the High Court prohibited the demolition of the 22 houses from to the Mamluk- Ottoman period. According to UNESCO, eventually three of them were destroyed and eleven others damaged.Progress report on the protection of the Palestinian cultural and natural heritage, par. 24. UNESCO, July 2005 In its decision of 4 March 2004, the High Court stipulated that praying in the Tomb was part of the constitutional right to freedom of religion and worship for the residents of the area. It even stated that ‚Ä≥The freedom of religion is a constitutional basic right of the individual, of a status even higher than other constitutional human rights‚Ä≥. The Court decided that the right to freedom of religion and worship for the settlers of Kiryat Arba, including a safe route to the Tomb, prevailed over the right to private property for the Palestinian landowners. It found that the ‚Ä≥relative impingement upon property rights of the property owners along the route, which was limited to a minimum‚Ä≥ justified the expropriation of the Palestinian lands. After the High Court decision, on 7 May 2004, the IDF ordered the demolition of 11 houses in the Wadi Al-Nassara and Haret Jaber neighborhoods, and the confiscation of 700 square meters of Palestinian land close to the Ibrahimi Mosque belonging to the Waqf, all located in the area between Kiryat Arba and the Mosque.Israel Orders Demolition of 11 Houses and Land Seizure in Hebron.

Initially, the State ordered the IDF to remove the path, but the IDF ignored the orders. When the Palestinian land owners went to the Israeli High Court (HCJ) in 2007, the State first declared that the path would be demolished, but later said it was needed for military reasons. The IDF declared that it was a military security road, with a secondary use by worshippers as a pedestrian path.Using \\"security grounds\\" to legalize illegal settler building: HCJ 4331/10 City of Hebron v. State of Israel (judgment rendered February 1, 2012). Yotam Ben Hillel, HaMoked‚ÄìCenter for the Defence of the Individual, 30 December 2012 In May 2010, the land owners received a land seizure order, which in effect legalized the already existing dirt road. On 1 February 2012, the High Court ruled on a petition against the 2010 land seizure order and approved the path, based on security reasons, as a more secure alternative to Worshippers Way. Criticism Human rights organization HaMoked criticized the role of the High Court as supporting the Israeli state in institutionalizing the presence of the settlers in the territory, which is illegal under international law. While international law forbids to destroy or seize the enemy's property if not necessary for imperative operational military needs, the state argued that the expanded road was needed for the safety of the settlers; the state itself, however, was party to the illegal presence of the settlers. HaMoked blamed the Court for accepting, without a \\"second guess\\", the state's and the army's assertion that the road was not meant to create Jewish territorial contiguity, but was based purely on security considerations and was meant to protect the lives of the worshippers using the road.

Educated at King's School, Canterbury and Christ's College, Cambridge, Glennie made little impact in his solitary first-class cricket match, which came against a team of Kent amateurs: he scored one run in his two innings and failed to take a wicket. There are no records of him appearing in any other cricket matches, first-class or non-first-class. Glennie was ordained as a Church of England clergyman after leaving Cambridge, and was a church inspector of schools for some years, later recording his experiences in a book. From 1869 to his death in 1903 he was the vicar of Croxton, Staffordshire. His son, Reginald, was also a first-class cricketer and clergyman.

The underlying true crime is the Hans Reiser murder case. The film stars James Franco, Ed Harris, Amber Heard and Christian Slater. The film had its world premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 16, 2015. The film was released on DirecTV Cinema on March 10, 2016, prior to opening in a limited release on April 15, 2016, by A24. Plot Stephen Elliott is a successful author with a troubling childhood. His mother died when he was a child and his father was physically and psychologically abusive. He has lived most of his life behaving very destructively and abusing drugs and committing petty vandalism. He had recently gotten a deal to write his next book and decided to write about Hans Reiser, a software guru who developed the Reiser filesystem. He had a volatile marriage and his wife has gone missing. Despite his claims that his wife has simply gone into hiding to hurt him, the cops arrested him for her murder and he is now on trial. Stephen is attending court every day and following the case, in hopes of writing a best seller. His previous book was a memoir about his childhood that is about to get released. At the release party, he is reading from his book talking about how his late father hurt and abused him and his father Neil Elliott stands up in the crowd and calls him a liar. This causes him to question his childhood memories. In despair, he gets high, goes to a club, and sleeps with a random person. He wakes up in the middle of the next day and checks his voicemails, which include his publisher dropping him for missing an important meeting, and a girl he was starting a relationship with dumping him. To make matters worse, he realizes that he also slept through the jury announcing their verdict on Hans Reiser, finding him guilty of murder. He connects with his father and realizes that he is dying and wants to make amends. While talking, he figures out that while Neil made some parenting mistakes, Stephen is falsely remembering his father being downright abusive. A recurring memory of his father handcuffing him until he bled was because Stephen was trying to kill himself and Neil was desperately trying to restrain him. In the end, he writes over the course of two days about making amends with his father. His agent reads it and loves it. She agrees to find him another publisher. Meanwhile, it is revealed in the news that Hans has finally admitted to killing his wife because she was going to leave him and take his kids and he killed her in anger. He has shown the cops where her body is buried in exchange for a lesser sentence.

History The barracks are situated in the grounds of Moston Hall, a house built in 1789 for Richard Massey. The house was acquired by the Swetenham family who sold it to the Lockett family in 1918. During the First World War, the house was used as a military hospital. The rest of the site was occupied by a house known as The Dale which was built in the 1880s and was bought by the War Office in 1938. The Dale became the depot of the Cheshire Regiment who arrived from Chester Castle in 1939. During Second World War the Machine Gun Training Centre was established there and after the War it became a Primary Training Centre for infantry training. Between 1956 and 1987 the Dale was used as a secure asylum after which it was returned to military use as the officer's mess for the barracks of the 1st Battalion the King's Regiment. The 1st Battalion Royal Welsh moved out of the barracks in April 2014 and the 2nd Battalion Mercian Regiment arrived in July 2014. The 2nd Battalion Mercian Regiment itself left in Summer 2018 and was replaced by 1st Battalion The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment which arrived in November 2018.

She served primarily as a convoy escort in the Battle of the Atlantic. She was named in honour of the town of Dartmouth, Nova Scotia. She could not be named HMCS Dartmouth for fear of confusion with HMS Dartmouth, and so was named after a famous early resident, Nova Scotia Lieutenant Governor Sir John Wentworth. Her name is often mistakenly associated with Wentworth County, Ontario, in honour of the city of Hamilton. Wentworth was ordered in April 1942 as part of the 1942‚Äì1943 River- class building program. She was laid down on 11 November 1942 by Yarrows Ltd. at Esquimalt, British Columbia and launched 6 March 1943. She was commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 7 December 1943 at Victoria, British Columbia. Background The River-class frigate was designed by William Reed of Smith's Dock Company of South Bank-on-Tees. Originally called a \\"twin-screw corvette\\", its purpose was to improve on the convoy escort classes in service with the Royal Navy at the time, including the Flower-class corvette. The first orders were placed by the Royal Navy in 1940 and the vessels were named for rivers in the United Kingdom, giving name to the class. In Canada they were named for towns and cities though they kept the same designation. The name \\"frigate\\" was suggested by Vice-Admiral Percy Nelles of the Royal Canadian Navy and was adopted later that year. Improvements over the corvette design included improved accommodation which was markedly better. The twin engines gave only three more knots of speed but extended the range of the ship to nearly double that of a corvette at at 12 knots. Among other lessons applied to the design was an armament package better designed to combat U-boats including a twin 4-inch mount forward and 12-pounder aft. 15 Canadian frigates were initially fitted with a single 4-inch gun forward but with the exception of , they were all eventually upgraded to the double mount. For underwater targets, the River-class frigate was equipped with a Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar and depth charge rails aft and four side-mounted throwers. River-class frigates were the first Royal Canadian Navy warships to carry the 147B Sword horizontal fan echo sonar transmitter in addition to the irregular ASDIC. This allowed the ship to maintain contact with targets even while firing unless a target was struck. Improved radar and direction-finding equipment improved the RCN's ability to find and track enemy submarines over the previous classes. Canada originally ordered the construction of 33 frigates in October 1941. The design was too big for the locks on the Lachine Canal so it was not built by the shipyards on the Great Lakes and therefore all the frigates built in Canada were built in dockyards along the West Coast or along the St. Lawrence River below Montreal. In all Canada ordered the construction of 60 frigates including ten for the Royal Navy that transferred two to the United States Navy. War service After transiting from Victoria to Halifax Wentworth departed for Bermuda to work up. However while training, she developed defects and was forced to return to Halifax to undergo repair. Following that, she completed working up in St. Margaret's Bay. In June 1944 Wentworth was assigned to the Mid-Ocean Escort Force escort group C-4. She began service as a trans-Atlantic convoy escort that month, and was made Senior Officer's Ship of the group in August 1944. The vessel remained in this function until February 1945, when she returned to Canada to undergo a significant refit at Shelburne, Nova Scotia. This refit lasted from 7 March until 9 August. By then the war in Europe had come to an end. Her services no longer needed, she was paid off 10 October 1945 and laid up in Bedford Basin. She was sold for scrap on 17 November 1947 and taken to Sydney, Nova Scotia to be broken up by Dominion Steel Corp. in 1948. References ;Notes ;References *Macpherson, Ken; Burgess, John.

Synopsis In the small principality of Immendingen in Germany in 1847, the annual court concert at the palace is in danger of being cancelled, because the court singer Tamara Pinelli has lost her voice due to a broken heart. The Prince sends to Munich for a renowned singer named Belotti, to replace Pinelli. At the same time, the young Christine Holm arrives in Immendingen. Christine's mother has recently died, and she is looking for her father, who met her mother in Immendingern. At the border, Christine meets a border guard, Lieutenant Walter von Arnegg, who falls in love with her. When Christine is accused of being a loose woman by a fellow traveler on her coach, Walter defends Christine and pretends to be her fiancee in order to protect her honor. Walter and Christine begin dating and fall in love. Christine has brought a poem with her to Immendingen that her mother always carried with her as the only memento of Christine's father. Christine traces the poem's origin to an impoverished poet named Knips, who writes poems for cash for local lovers. Christine visits Knips in his garret apartment and tells him about her search. Knips tells Christine that her mother was once a singer at the royal court. He knew her briefly, and he only knows that Christine's father was a high-ranking man from the royal court. Before Christine can investigate any further, she is expelled from the principality by Minister of State von Arnegg, who wants to end his son's improper relationship with this illegitimately born woman, who does not know her own father, as soon as possible. Walter escorts Christine to the border, on orders from his father. At the border they encounter the coach that was sent to Munich to find Belotti. The driver complains that he failed, but Christine laughs and explains that Belotti is her own stage name. Christine is Belotti. Christine returns to the court of Immendingen with an escort of honor and is presented to the Prince. Christine continues her search for her father, but her mother's files are locked away in the city archives by order of State Minister von Arnegg. Christine comes to believe that von Arnegg is her father and ends her relationship with Walter, believing him to be her brother. During the rehearsals for the court concert, Pinelli becomes angry at having been replaced and burns the only text of the song that is performed every year, but Christine stuns everyone when she knows the lyrics to the song, which was never performed outside of the palace - it was her mother's favorite song. During the concert, the Prince learns the name of Christine's mother and is overcome with emotion as he listens to Christine sing the same song her mother did, on the same stage her mother did. After the concert, the Prince invites Christine to stay on at court as a chamber singer and tells her she can marry Walter, but Christine refuses because she could not marry her brother. The Prince then reveals that he is her father, and Christine and Walter get engaged. The Prince also invites Knips to live at court, at Christine's suggestion, and appoints him the court poet.

The film is a reboot of the Kikaider franchise created by Shotaro Ishinomori. Plot In the near future, the Japanese government develops the ARK Project, led by Dr. Nobuhiko Kohmyoji, to create androids to help public citizens. Two prototypes are constructed: one by Dr. Kohmyoji, Jiro/Kikaider, an android built with an experimental Conscience Circuit, and another by Professor Gilbert Kanzaki, Mari, a combat-based android. Dr. Kohmyoji mysteriously dies and his children, Mitsuko and Masaru are suddenly targeted by Japan's Defense Minister. Jiro comes to their aide and vows to protected them, a final request from Dr. Kohmyoji. Masaru becomes fond of Jiro but Mitsuko becomes wary of him. Mari eventually finds Jiro and nearly destroys him but spares him after Mitsuko and Masaru agree to go with her without resistance. A data chip is then retrieved from within Masaru's body, containing all of Dr. Kohmyoji's research. The Defense Minister then turns the ARK Project into the DARK Project (Developing Advanced Research by Kohmyoji) and forces Professor Gil to complete his work. Jiro is then attacked by another android named \\"Hakaider\\", who is revealed to be Professor Gil, having surgically placed his brain within an android body. Hakaider proceeds to destroy the ARK Project facility where he is counter- attacked by Jiro. Mitsuko tries to stop him from fighting but Jiro finally realizes his own free-will and chooses to protect by fighting. Jiro manages to defeat Hakaider but at the cost of his life. Mitsuko vows to one day rebuild him. In a post-credit scene, the Defense Minister, having escaped the demise of the facility with Mari, confirms the official start of the true android project.

Early life Howard Richards was born in Pasadena. California, United States, the eldest child of Kenneth F. Richards, a truck mechanic, originally from Connecticut, and his wife Donna.(McCune) It was his mother's intellectual interest in philosophers such as Henri Bergson which prompted the family to break its ties with mormonism. His paternal grandparents fell into unemployment in Connecticut during the Great Depression and moved to Pasadena in 1932. It was his uncle Jack from his mother's side, who died during World War II,p 257 in Understanding the Global Economy and under \\"The Holocaust\\" in Richards, 2002. and especially his mother who fostered his early intellectual interest.see eg TOPICA Academic background After graduating from Redlands High School, CA, in June 1956, Richards enrolled in the same year as a Philosophy undergraduate at Yale. Being a top student, he was allowed to skip one year of the normal three year Major in Philosophy course. Afterwards he was admitted to Stanford Law School in 1958, graduating with a Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree in 1961. Later in that year he enrolled in graduate school at the University of California Santa Barbara, earning an M.A. in Philosophy there in 1964 with a thesis on Jean-Paul Sartre. (MA Philosophy Thesis). Simultaneously he worked at the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions think tank where he contributed several articles to the in-house Center Magazine.a.o. an article entitled \\"A normative Economics\\" - see Richards Bibliography Articles.

Major works and ideas * In his first major work, The Evaluation of Cultural Action (1984), Richards \\"unveils throughout the text the rationale for using an 'illuminative' approach (Parlett and Hamilton, 1974) rather than a conventional 'systems' assessment\\". The long dialogue with a \\"reasonable social scientist\\" gravitates around how to evaluate education and community development efforts inspired by the Brazilian adult educationist Paulo Freire's philosophy, combined with an empirical study of one such effort, namely PPH (Parents and Children Program) that flourished among peasants in the south of Chile in the 1970s and 1980s. * Richards' two-volume Letters from Quebec: a Philosophy for Peace and Justice (1994) , Bloomberg books, also published by International Scholars Press, 1996 . Letters from Quebec Vol 1 & 2 can be read online on Scribd. aspires to be both literary entertainment and a history of rationality in western culture and philosophy, illuminating the possibilities for transformative and humanistic action. The subtitle of volume Two of Letters from Quebec is 'Methods for Transforming the Structures of the Modern World'. Taking leads from Paulo Freire and Antonio Gramsci, the philosopher is seen - borrowing a phrase from Paulo Freire - as a 'cultural activist' who invents rationalities. * Building on the premise that standards of rationality are historically constructed social norms, he went on, in Understanding the Global Economy (2004), (Peace Education Books) was originally published by Maadhyam in 2000. to argue that causal explanations in economics invariably rely, as premises, on cultural norms, and particularly on constitutive rules \\"Constitutive rules constitute (and also regulate) an activity the existence of which is logically dependent on the rules.\\" Richards, 2010. Richards proposes to understand institutions by following out the consequences of the rules that organize them. Understanding the Global Economy reviews the principal schools of economic thought with respect to the causal explanations they offer of the phenomena of today's global economy.Betty Reardon, (foreword). * The Dilemmas of Social Democracies: Overcoming Obstacles to a More Just World (2008) co-authored with Joanna Swanger, applies the philosophical ideas of Richards' earlier works, particularly a concept of basic cultural structure,Basic cultural structure: see eg Richards What the World Needs Now. \\\\- where 'basic' identifies those cultural structures that govern the satisfaction of the basic needs of life - to historical case studies of Spain, Sweden, Austria, South Africa, Indonesia, Venezuela, and the World Bank. The upshot is that social democracy is not feasible with the framework provided by the constitutive rules of modernity. Social democracy can only become feasible by adopting an approach Richards and another co-author, Gavin Andersson, will later call unbounded organization.. * Gandhi and the Future of Economics (2011) \\"makes a case for incorporating Gandhi's insights into mainstream economics. Gandhi and the Future of Economics is not meant to be a research study of Gandhian economics. It is rather that kind of felicitous publication that breathes new life into a known theme, and, in doing so, brings out its implications for praxis. It does all this in dialogue with a set of contemporary thinkers and actors from the Indian sub-continent: Jawaharlal Nehru, Jayaprakash Narayan, Tariq Ali, Vandana Shiva, Amartya Sen, Arundhati Roy, Manmohan Singh.\\" (Ivo Coelho). * The Nurturing of Time Future (2012) defines itself as \\"a short book about everything\\", addressed to educated people of good will who see the need for paradigmatic change. It proposes a philosophy in the old-fashioned sense of articulating a synthesis of the social and natural sciences that provides an overall framework for deciding what to do. It is a 'belles lettres' exercise written in the style of Marcel Proust.Jane Stillwater (review) * Rethinking Thinking: Modernity's \\"Other\\" and the transformation of the University (2012) co-authored with Catherine Hoppers, further develops a theme found in early works ‚Äì that modernity has much to learn from pre-modernity. It includes an account of how the constitutive rules of markets presupposed by economics developed in Roman Law. They are contrasted with indigenous African cultural norms. Rethinking also argues that bringing modernity's \\"other\\" into the curriculum of the university will transform the curriculum, transform research and transform community engagement.T. Pilay and van der Westhuizen (reviews). * Richards' most recent book Unbounded Organizing in Community (2015), co- authored with Gavin Andersson of South Africa's Seriti Institute, offers a combination of a down to earth, practical guide to doing community organizing inspired by the Organization Workshops of Clodomir Santos de Morais, with an elementary introduction to Andersson's theory of unbounded organization. Emphasis is on practical examples and guidelines for organizers and participants. Other books and articles Richards has also published fourteen other books some in English and some in Spanish, among the latter, Richards, 1987, √âtica y Econom√≠a (Ethics and Economics), and Gonz√°lez Meyer & Richards (2012) Hacia otras Economias.

George Petrie from Brewer, Vol. 2: where it is stated that it was published by Sherwood 1 May 1826 and engraved by James Sargant Storer and Henry Sargant Storer Sir John Esmonde, 10th Baronet (16 May 1826 ‚Äì 9 December 1876) was an Irish nationalist politician. He sat in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom from 1852 until his death 25 years later.  Early life and family  Esmonde was the son of Royal Navy officer James Esmonde and his wife Anna Maria, n√©e Murphy. He was educated at Clongowes Wood College and at Trinity College, Dublin, where he graduated in 1850 with an honours degree in classics. He was called to the bar of Ireland in the same year. In 1861 he married Louisa Grattan, the fourth daughter of Henry Grattan MP, and granddaughter of 18th-century parliamentary leader Henry Grattan. They had four sons and two daughters, Thomas, Laurence, Walter, John, Ellice, and Annette. In 1868, he inherited the baronetcy and estates of his uncle Thomas.  Career  He was elected at the 1852 general election as one of the two members of parliament (MPs) for County Waterford. Both Esmonde and his fellow Waterford MP Nicholas Mahon Power were elected as candidates of the Irish Liberal Party, which had been in alliance with nationalists. Power was accused of acting selfishly and parsimoniously\\" to Esmonde, who was described at the time as hoisting \\"free trade and liberal colours\\". Esmonde's election was the subject of a petition by the defeated Conservative candidate Richard Hely-Hutchinson, who alleged personation and intimidation. The names of people who were not entitled to vote were struck off the return, but Esmonde's election was upheld. The alliance of nationalists and liberals faltered after the election, and Esmonde was one of 40 Irish Liberals who transferred their support to the new Independent Irish Party. The new party foundered, and Esmonde was re-elected as a Liberal at the next 4 general elections. In January 1866, Esmonde was appointed as High Sheriff of Wexford. On 2 June, he was appointed by as a Junior Lord of the Treasury in the Liberal Government of Earl Russell. As an office of profit under the Crown, the Parliamentary rules of the time required him to seek re-election, and on 9 June he was returned unopposed. However, his time in office was short, because Russell's government fell before the end of June, to be replaced by a Conservative government. In 1869, he was appointed as a deputy lieutenant of County Wexford, succeeding his uncle Thomas. Described by The Times newspaper of London as a \\"zealous and attached member of the Roman Catholic communion\\", Esmonde was listed in 1869 as one of 50 Catholic baronets, and 38 Catholic MPs. He was one of the speakers at a rally in Dublin in November 1870 to protest at the loss of the temporal power of the Pope. At the 1874 general election, he was returned again for Waterford, this time as a candidate of the newly reconstituted Home Rule Party. He died in office two years later, aged 50. Esmonde had also been a justice of the peace for counties Waterford, Wexford, and Wicklow, a captain in the Wexford militia, and a member of the Royal Irish Academy. His parliamentary seat was won at the resulting by-election by the Home Rule candidate James Delahunty, and he was succeeded in the baronetcy by his son Thomas.

As Hasbro's head of research and development, Levine guided G.I. Joe through its design and development. Levine served with the United States Army in the Korean War and Hasbro's employees also included many military veterans, so it was decided the toy should be outfitted in the uniforms of the Army, Navy, Marines, and Air Force and their respective accessories. In 2005-2006, Levine designed and manufactured an action figure of Osama bin Laden for a Central Intelligence Agency psychological warfare program called Devil Eyes. Levine developed a twelve-inch lifelike figure whose face was painted with a material that, when heated, would peel off to reveal a demon-like visage with green eyes and black markings. When asked in 2014 about Levine's involvement in the program, his family said in a statement, \\"Don Levine was a dedicated Patriot, and proud Korean War veteran. When called on, he was honored to assist our country.\\" In 2014 Levine died from cancer at a Providence, Rhode Island hospice. He is survived by Nan, his wife of nearly 60 years.

Aim of the concept and project  The aim is to provide a zero local emission mass public transportation bus system with high passenger capacity and no overhead line. The concept supports same operating timetable and frequency as line operated with diesel buses, trolleybuses and operating conditions of Bus Rapid Transit systems. The following aspects have been considered to comply with a sustainable mobility approach: * Minimise use of raw material throughout the life cycle: lithium-titanate battery technology has been selected accordingly. * Energy efficiency: High passenger capacity, low vehicle weight (small battery), conductive energy transfer and grid connection with peak shaving. * Safety and health: Low emission of radiation Non-ionizing radiation during energy transfer at bus stops (conductive connection) and battery technology; zero local emission of particles; low noise; small visual impact.

Later he became a prolific motion picture producer. Early years Bobby North was born in New York City. He joined a vaudeville company at the age of twelve as a boy balcony singer. As North explained, \\"... there was a vogue of a soubrette, as we called her, singing on the stage, and a kid would get up from the gallery and sing the chorus. The Gallery Gods, of course, thought he was one of them and applauded loudly. I was the kid in the gallery. I had the voice and I could sing.\\" North traveled around the US with the company playing in small town opera houses or theaters for one- or two-night stands. He developed a song and dance act. Theater success Bobby North in the New York production of Emmerich K√°lm√°n's operetta The Gay Hussars (1909) In January 1909 North performed as a \\"Hebrew impersonator\\" at the Colonial Theatre in New York. In this act he told humorous stories with a Jewish accent and sang parodies of popular songs. He would continue to perform this act between other roles. These include a part in 1909 in the Emmerich K√°lm√°n operetta The Gay Hussars, and a straight role in 1910 in the play Just a Wife. North was a star of the Ziegfeld Follies of 1910. In one number he acted as a Jew in love with an Irish girl, and sang My Yiddisha Colleen to Shirley Kellogg. The song illustrates the common stereotypes and ethnic humor of the period, with verses like \\"I'll jig and Irish reel each morning, if you'll dance Kazotski ev'ry dawn ... And I'll even kiss the Blarney stone, if you'll change your name to Maggie Cohn.\\" North closed the second act of the Follies of 1910 with a solo performance of the Gus Edwards song The Waltzing Lieutenant. Variety editor Sime Silverman praised North's performance. The 1910 Ziegfeld Follies played in over twenty theaters in major cities around the country, including Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Chicago, Des Moines, Kansas City and San Francisco, where Bobby North was the local favorite. The company of over one hundred traveled in style in a special train, and stayed at the best hotels. Bobby North married Stella Maury, another vaudeville and Ziegfeld Follies trouper. Their son Edmund H. North was born in Manhattan on March 12, 1911 (later Edmund became a successful screenwriter). In 1911 North and Cliff Gordon were managing the Columbia Theatre on Broadway, one of the Eastern Burlesque Wheel's houses. They decided to offer a \\"higher\\" class of show with a fresh version of The Merry Whirl, which opened on June 12, 1911. The biggest song hit was Alexander's Ragtime Band by Irving Berlin. According to Variety the show was \\"as classy as burlesque ever held--classier even.\\" The Merry Whirl was very profitable, but on August 12 it was announced that it would end its run in New York and \\"proceed over the regular Eastern Wheel route assigned to it ... much to the regret of the house and the management.\\" North was a comedian in Hanky Panky (1912). Other stars were Carter DeHaven and Myrtle Gilbert. This \\"Jumble of Jollification\\" produced by Lew Fields opened at the Broadway Theatre on August 5, 1912 and ran there for 104 performances. Hanky Panky then moved to another theatre in New York before going on the road for a further 32 weeks. In 1913 North played at the Winter Garden Theatre in the Lew Fields' revue The Pleasure Seekers. The show was not successful and closed after two months. In 1914 he headlined at the Palace Theatre on Broadway with his \\"Hebrew impersonator\\" act. In 1915 Bobby North was among the cast of Lew Fields' musical review Hands Up, as were Fanny Brice and her brother Lew Brice. The show played in New Haven, Connecticut, June 7‚Äì9, but did not open in New York the next day as planned. Eventually Hands Up did make it to New York City, but without North and the Brices. The reason given was that they each used a very similar \\"Hebrew accent\\", and it was hard to distinguish them on stage. Film Poster for Show Girl in Hollywood (1930) Due to the stress of traveling with a pregnant wife and a young son, North turned to making films in 1915. Bobby North, L. Lawrence Weber, Aaron Hoffman and Harry J. Cohen organized Popular Plays and Players, the precursor of Metro Pictures. In 1915 North started to produce Olga Petrova's silent films. He worked as studio manager with George Irving as director in making Petrova's movies. In January 1917 North's Popular Plays and Players, part of the Metro Picture Corporation, was filming in a rented building on West 35th Street, Manhattan, when there was an explosion in the film cutting room. The building filled with dense smoke, and the actors had to grope their ways to the exits. There were no serious injuries, but Olga Petrova said she had lost jewels and clothes worth $25,000. North reported total losses of about $250,000. Other early films were shot in Fort Lee, New Jersey. Later North moved to California and produced films for United Artists, and then for First National and Columbia. He produced many films in most genres. North produced Paris (1929, First National), a musical play directed by Clarence G. Badger. The film has been lost, but sound discs and sound tapes have been preserved. North produced Wedding Rings (First National), a drama directed by William Beaudine that was released on December 29, 1929. North worked for the First National and Warner Bros. film studios in the 1930s, and made many feature films. In 1930 he produced Those Who Dance (Warner Bros), another drama directed by Beaudine, and A Notorious Affair (First National) directed by Lloyd Bacon and starring Billie Dove, Basil Rathbone and Kay Francis. That year he also produced Show Girl in Hollywood and Dawn Patrol, directed by Howard Hawks. In 1931 he produced Beaudine's Father's Son starring Leon Janney, Lewis Stone, Irene Rich, John Halliday and Mickey Bennett. North was an active producer throughout the 1930s and the first half of the 1940s. The Black Room (1935, Columbia) directed by Roy William Neill was the first horror film starring Boris Karloff. He produced the crime drama Penitentiary (1938, Columbia), directed by John Brahm, starring Walter Connolly, John Howard, Jean Parker and Robert Barrat. In 1942 he produced In Old California for Republic Pictures, directed by William C. McGann and starring John Wayne. The following year he produced War of the Wildcats for Republic, also called In Old Oklahoma, directed by Albert S. Rogell and again starring John Wayne. His Someone to Remember (1943, Republic), directed by Curt Siodmak and based on Prodigal's daughter by Ben Ames Williams, was called \\"an exceptionally good 'B.

She was active on behalf of married women teachers' rights to promotion and maternity leave. Early life and education Henrietta Rodman was born in Astoria, New York, the daughter of Rev. Washington Rodman and Henrietta Blackwell Rodman. Her father was a Protestant Episcopal clergyman in West Farms, Bronx, and founder of St. Barnabas Hospital in the Bronx. She was a 1904 graduate of Teachers College, Columbia University. Career Rodman taught English and was a vocational counselor at Wadleigh High School for Girls in New York City.Rodman, Henrietta. \\"Self-Analysis by High School Girls\\", in Proceedings of the Second National Conference on Vocational Guidance, October 23-26, 1912. Volume 2, p. 101.Emma Goldman's essay \\"The Social Importance of the Modern School\\" includes an anecdote about Rodman teaching literature, and getting in trouble for discussing George Eliot's personal life. Opposed to the school board's restrictive policies on married women teachers, she married a psychologist friend, Herman de Fremery (a.k.a. Herman Defrem), in February 1913, and announced it to the press, saying, \\"If the married state affects a woman's work, the authorities can mark her accordingly. If it does not affect her work, and if she is as good a teacher as she was before, she deserves promotion, if it comes to her.\\" She also referred to the Board of Education, in print, as \\"mother baiters.\\" She was suspended according to New York City Board of Education policy; a well- publicized and lengthy appeal followed, serving Rodman's purpose by keeping the issue in headlines.Carter, Patricia. \\"Henrietta Rodman and the Fight to Further Women's Economic Autonomy\\", in Tanya Fitzgerald and Elizabeth M. Smyth, eds., Women Educators, Leaders, and Activists: Educational Lives and Networks, 1900-1960. 2014: Palgrave Macmillan, . Rodman was a member of the Liberal Club and of Heterodoxy.Churchill, Allen (1959). \\"The Female Reformed: Henrietta Rodman's M√§dchen\\", in C√©sar Gra√±a and Marigay Gra√±a, eds., On Bohemia: The Code of the Self-Exiled. 1990: Transaction Publishers, , pp. 277-279. She agitated in the Liberal Club for the inclusion of African- American members, and for support of feminist causes; in 1913 she was successful in leading the relocation of the Liberal Club to MacDougal Street in Greenwich Village. In 1914 Rodman formed the Feminist Alliance, uniting several feminist causes to work together. Rodman took special interest in the collective housing, childcare, and communal kitchens, following the writings of Charlotte Perkins Gilman. She made serious plans for an apartment building to demonstrate those feminist principles, hiring an architect and rounding up financial backers, but stiff opposition and the onset of war scuttled any chance of success. During World War I, she was a member of the executive board of the Woman's Peace Party, and wrote and lectured on pacifism. Personal life Playwright Floyd Dell said that Rodman \\"had an extraordinary gift for stirring things up. Incredibly na√Øve, preposterously reckless, believing wistfully in beauty and goodness, a Candide in petticoats and sandals.\\" Her Bohemian public persona was considered eccentric at best: she wore sack-like dresses and sandals long before they were in fashion; her hair was bobbed; she smoked cigarettes. She threw crowded dinner parties in her top-floor apartment; Mary Austin recalled attending one such dinner, and meeting James Weldon Johnson there. Margaret Sanger also remembered attending a tea hosted by Henrietta Rodman, whom she called \\"Feminist of Feminists\\", in Rodman's Greenwich Village apartment. During her marriage to Herman de Fremery, the couple lived with Herman's earlier common-law wife, in an apartment on Bank Street. Rodman adopted two children and was known as \\"Mrs. Rodman\\" in her personal life. She died after unsuccessful surgery for a brain tumor in March 1923, at age 45.

Distribution  U. concentricus occurs in Costa Rica, Puerto Rico, Colombia, Argentina, Chile, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. The species' type locality, according to d'Orbigny (1835), is close to Montevideo, near the island Isla de Ratas, at the mouth of the R√≠o de la Plata.  Description  U. concentricus has a high, thin, transparent shell, with growth lines and radial ribs, which may in certain cases appear somewhat fuzzy, especially when it inhabits torrential environments. The apex is acute, quite recurved, moved back from the midpoint and flexed on the right side. The aperture is oval, broad, with somewhat wavy edges. The colour is typically light brown to tawny. The radula has a central bicuspid tooth, with the left cusp predominating and hinting at the birth of two others, one on each side.Fernandez, D. (ed.). 1981. Mollusca, Gasteropoda, Ancylidae. In: Ringuelet, R.A. (ed.), Fauna de Ague Dulce de la Rep√∫blica Argentina. pp. 99-114. Fundaci√≥n para la Educaci√≥n, la Ciencia y la Cultura, Buenos Aires. The lateral tooth has three rather noticeable cusps and a fourth, very small outer cusp. The species is hermaphrodite; the genitalia are a key diagnostic character at the species level. The ovotestis contains around 25 follicles and the seminal vesicle is located in the middle portion of the ovisperm duct. The prostate usually has five elongated follicles.  Habitat and ecology  U. concentricus inhabits shady places on rocks or leaves of aquatic plants, leaves in the process of decomposition, including submerged tree trunks. It occurs in springs, mountainous streams, and medium-sized rivers. It may also be found in stagnant waters, lakes or ponds where a surface that allows adhesion exists; no specimens were observed on silty or sandy substrates. Dos Santos (2003) has associated the species with environments with little current, not polluted, with meso- to oligotrophic features. U. concentricus associates with the roots of the common Water Hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes), and can withstand periods of low water in lentic habitats. It also associates with Chaetogaster sp., Carchesium sp. (Ciliophora) and green hydra and algae that grow densely on its shell. Regarding parasitism, U. concentricus has been reported to act as the intermediate host of several families of Trematoda (Digenea).

It is an exempt charity, regulated by the Department for Education. The trust was founded in 2009, led by Sir Michael Wilkins who was principal of the trust's namesake, Outwood Grange Academy. Its current CEO is Martyn Oliver, who previously served as a principal of schools within the trust. The trust operates using an \\"80:20\\" principle, where about 80% of how its schools operate is standardised and 20% is open to local innovation. Windfall In 2015, the Conservative Education Minister, Nicky Morgan, announced she was giving five multi-academy trusts, including Outwood Grange Academies Trust, a million pounds each for ‚Äúimproving performance for pupils in some of the most challenging and disadvantaged areas of the country‚Äù. The money was awarded to raise standards in deprived areas in South Yorkshire, Bradford, Greater Manchester, Northumberland and Tees Valley. The Northern Powerhouse minister said, James Wharton said, \\" 'experience, leadership, and the chains‚Äô strong track record of success' will mean northern school children can now fulfil their potential.\\" It was pointed out at the time that Sir Michael Wilkins had been previously criticised for taking ¬£500,000 consultancy fees over and above his salary; then a financial audit by Wakefield Council reportedly uncovered an ‚Äúexcessive rewards culture‚Äù with lavish spending on foreign trips. Academic performance In July 2016, a report by the Education Policy Institute found that at the secondary level \\"Outwood Grange is the best large academy group (10 schools or more)\\". In the multi-academy trust league tables released January 2017, the trust was ranked in the top 5 nationally for secondary progress, and also for both primary writing and maths progress. Discipline The academy trust operates a zero tolerance discipline policy with children internally isolated or excluded and sent home for any minor breach of the uniform code as well as serious offences. In September 2018 the Guardian published an article criticising the use of isolation booths as a form of punishment within schools, describing them as a form of internal exclusion (where exclusion is a policy by which pupils are forbidden from attending school for a period of time as a punishment). A report from the Department for Education, highlighted in the Guardian article in August 2018 revealing that 45 English schools had excluded over 20% of their pupils in the last academic year. Outwood Grange was stated to run 9 of them, with Outwood Academy Ormesby in Middlesbrough topping the list by excluding 41% of pupils in the last academic year. Notes were drawn in the earlier article to the risk of disabled pupils with challenging behaviour being overly at risk of exclusion. The trusts' policy for ‚Äúconsequence rooms‚Äù, as isolation booths were called, stated pupils must not \\"tap, chew, swing on their chairs, shout out, sigh, or [engage in] any other unacceptable or disruptive behaviour\\" and a spokesperson stated \\"The trust employs all reasonable adjustments for students with special needs within their behaviour policy\\". However the banned activities include many self-stimulatory behaviours used by people on the Autism Spectrum to cope when under stress, and would be considered reasonable adjustments under the Equality Act 2010. A parent of a child who was subjected to this treatment for 35 school days, has taken a Yorkshire school to court to challenge the legitimacy of ‚Äúconsequence rooms‚Äù, lawyers have applied for a judicial review. The issues to be judged are to be loss of education, the lack of a review procedure, the lack of monitoring by Department of Education who is now responsible as academies are free of Local Authority oversight. The trust has failed to promote the pupil‚Äôs welfare and did so in an ‚Äúirrational‚Äù manner. The trust failed to have regard to the Equality Act 2010, as pupils with special educational needs or poor mental health are being placed in isolation against their best interests. The trust has failed to comply with article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights. The school trust responded saying \\"other of their schools were outstanding\\". In September 2019, the Trust launched a new behaviour policy. Schools Week reported that the new policy included \\"more praise, a further safeguard to pick up ‚Äì and provide support for ‚Äì those pupils stuck on the ‚Äúmerry go round‚Äù of sanctions, and more teaching for pupils about how to behave.\\" Ofsted noted that this resulted in much-improved behaviour and, consequently, a significant reduction in the need to use exclusions.\\" In 2019 former teachers at Outwood Academy Bishopsgarth reported a practice of intimidating and humiliating assemblies, which the trust denied; other teachers reported that these assemblies were trust policy and took place at other schools in the trust. On 1st May 2019, the trust announced its intention that pupils will have to repeat a year, and be separated from their peer group, if their behaviour is deemed inadequate. The trust insists this is their legal right, no extra support is being provided for the students in spite of a warning that this type of zero tolerance creates child mental health problems, and violence against teachers.

In October 2018 the trust announced plans to open a new free school in central Middlesbrough with capacity for 900 pupils, ages 11 to 16.

History  Pandolfo Petrucci was a rich Sienese aristocrat and effectively ruled the city from 1487 to 1512. The palace was built in 1508 by Domenico di Bartolomeo to a design by Giacomo Cozzarelli and was among the most magnificent Italian mansions of the time. The main salon was decorated by the best artists then active in Siena, including Pinturicchio, Luca Signorelli, and Girolamo Genga. The decorations were probably completed in 1509 to mark the wedding of Petrucci's son, Borghese Petrucci to Vittoria Piccolomini on 22 September. Pandolfo Petrucci died in 1512 and his son Borghese Petrucci was ousted from power in Siena only months later. Starting in 1512 the precious interior decorations underwent dispersion, culminating in tearing out the frescoes and dismantling of decorations in the hall.  Description  The facade was decorated with many bells and refined bronze bracelets, which are now in the Palazzo Pubblico. The living room was a large room with a ceiling painted by Pinturicchio and his workshop in a series of compartments with mythological scenes that elaborated the scheme of the Volta gold in the Domus Aurea which Pinturicchio had seen in Rome. It included eight scenes on frescoed walls, which are now partly lost and partly divided between the Pinacoteca Nazionale (Siena) and museums around the world. The paintings were surrounded by a wooden structure carved by the famous Barili workshop and majolica tiles lined the floor. Overall, the theme of the decoration was derived from epic poetry, ancient history and the fourteenth-century literary tradition and drew on examples of civil and military virtue. = Ceiling of the hall = The ceiling of the hall was divided into squares by gilded stucco with fresco figured panels of various shapes. It is now in the Metropolitan Museum of New York City. At the center is a coat of arms within a wreath. On the four sides of the central compartment are ovals with scenes of the Rape of Europa, Helle rides the ram, Nymph riding a seahorse and the Judgment of Paris. Two additional compartments depict Hercules and Omphale and the Calydonian boar hunt. Among the oval and curved panels are pairs of irregular hexagons with Triumphs and other scenes with chariots, a total of eight, including a Triumphs of Alexander the Great, the Rape of Proserpine and Triumphs of Cybele, Proserpine, Amphitrite and the Sun. Finally, the corners are four medallions within boxes decorated with grotesques, which depict couples and groups of mythological characters: Bacchus and Silenus, Pan', Priapus Satyr and Nymph, Venus and Cupid, the Three Graces. The set, although updated to modern schemes, provided a refined antique effect. Other mythological figures were in the spandrels between the stucco, along with episodes of Roman history and heraldic eagles of Petrucci. Designed by Pinturicchio, the execution was probably left to assistants including Sienese local Pacchiarotto and perhaps the young Genga. = Walls of the hall = The layout for the panels decorating of walls of the main salon are known from the 18th-century descriptions made by Guglielmo Della Valle and Giovanni Girolamo Carli, made before their dispersal. In 1840 the frescoes were detached by Joly de Bammeville, and some were sold to the National Gallery in London, others are now in the town gallery: *Luca Signorelli, Love defeated triumph of Chastity, National Gallery (London) *Pinturicchio, Return of Ulysses, National Gallery (London) *Pinturicchio or Luca Signorelli, Reconciliation of Coriolanus, National Gallery (London) *Girolamo Genga, Redemption of prisoners by the son of Fabius Maximus, Pinacoteca Nazionale (Siena) *Girolamo Genga, Flight of Aeneas from Troy, Pinacoteca Nazionale (Siena) *Luca Signorelli, Calumny of Apelles, lost *Luca Signorelli, Feast of Pan, lost *?, Scipio and the girl Celtiberiana The fresco cycle celebrated Pandolfo Petrucci and his family. The Return of Ulysses for example, alludes to the return from exile before Pandolfo and then by his son Borghese, while the Escape of Aeneas from Virgil in the characters evokes three generations of Petrucci. The redemption of prisoners seems to be a hope that the virtuous Borghese will follow his father's footsteps, as well as a dynastic theme also alludes to the Reconciliation of Coriolanus. The Calumny of Apelles cautions to the proper administration of justice and Love defeated with the triumph of Chastity was a tribute to the wedding with echoes of the Triumphs of Petrarch, as well as the theme of the Continence of Scipio, a typical scene from the wedding chest.

Three of them, an Israeli couple on holiday and a French woman, died at the scene. The fourth victim, a Belgian employee of the museum, was taken to the hospital but died of his injuries on 6 June. A little less than a week later, on 30 May 2014, a suspect was arrested in the French city of Marseille in connection with the shooting. The suspect was Mehdi Nemmouche, a 29-year-old French national of Algerian origin. A second suspect, Nacer Bendrer, was identified and arrested later. Prior to the shooting, Nemmouche had already spent time in French prisons, where he became involved in radical Islam. After his imprisonment, he also spent more than a year in Syria. It is also in prison where he met Bendrer, who was suspected of having supplied Nemmouche with the weapons used in the attack. Investigators identified a third suspect as well, but the charges against the third suspect were later dismissed due to the evidence against him being considered too weak. Nemmouche and Bendrer were formally indicted in April 2018, and tried before the court of assizes of Brussels in early 2019. After two months of trial hearings, a verdict was rendered: Nemmouche was found guilty of having committed the attack, whilst Bendrer was found guilty of being the co-author of the attack by having supplied Nemmouche with the weapons used in the attack. The theory that Nemmouche was framed by foreign intelligence officials, put forward by Nemmouche's defence, was rejected. Subsequently, Nemmouche was sentenced to life imprisonment whilst Bendrer was sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment. Both were later also sentenced to pay close to one million euro in damages to the victims' next of kin. Shooting A man wearing a cap, carrying several bags and armed with a handgun and a Kalashnikov rifle arrived at the Jewish Museum of Belgium, near the Sablon in central Brussels, at around half past three. He then opened fire, killing three people on site and critically wounding a fourth, who was soon taken to hospital and who died of his injuries on 6 June. The attack lasted less than 90 seconds, after which the shooter fled the scene on foot and was partially captured by security cameras. According to police, he headed into a different part of downtown Brussels before disappearing. According to security camera footage, the attacker appeared to wear a baseball-type cap covering-up his head, and a chest-mounted camera, like Mohammed Merah, who filmed his acts during the 2012 Toulouse and Montauban shootings, although it was stated that the camera failed during filming. The Belgian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Didier Reynders, happened to be in the vicinity of the museum and heard the gunshots. The Minister of the Interior, Jo√´lle Milquet, was also nearby and arrived on the scene a few minutes later. = Victims = Four people were killed in the shooting. Two of the victims were Israelis, Emmanuel and Miriam Riva, a middle-aged couple on holiday from Tel Aviv, while a French woman named Dominique Sabrier was the third victim. A young Belgian man who worked at the museum, Alexandre Strens, was critically wounded and died of his wounds on 6 June. He was born in Morocco to a Jewish mother and Algerian Berber father, and his body was returned to Taza, Morocco, for burial in a Muslim cemetery.  Investigation  A nationwide manhunt was launched for the attacker, who was described as being of medium height and athletic build, and wearing a dark baseball cap. His image, partly obscured, was captured on CCTV. A man who was seen driving from the museum was detained, but released after questioning, and remains a witness in the investigation. Deputy prosecutor Ine Van Wymersch said the shooter \\"probably acted alone, was armed and well prepared.\\" She stated that the motive for the attack was still \\"open\\". The attack was being investigated as a terrorist incident. = Perpetrator = Mehdi Nemmouche (; born 17 April 1985), a 29-year-old French citizen, was arrested on 30 May 2014 at the Saint-Charles railway station in Marseille in connection with the shooting. Nemmouche is suspected to have returned to France from fighting for Islamist rebels in the Syrian Civil War in 2013. He appears to have recorded a video bearing the flag of the rebel group Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Nemmouche was born in Roubaix. His father abandoned his mother before he was born and he was raised primarily by his grandmother and in group homes. Prior to leaving for Syria, he already had a long criminal history, including arrests for armed robbery, vehicle theft, and vandalism. He reportedly told hostages in Syria he was planning an attack in Paris on Bastille Day. Nemmouche had previously spent five years in prison where he is suspected to have been radicalized. He left for Syria only three weeks after being released from prison in September 2012. He was the first European volunteer in the Syrian war who committed attacks upon returning to Europe. A number of items were recovered from a bag he was carrying while being detained, including a Kalashnikov rifle, a .38 Special revolver, nearly 330 rounds of ammunition for both weapons, gun parts, cameras, clothing, and a gas mask. A hidden file containing a 40-second video was discovered in one of the cameras; in it, Nemmouche's weapons are recorded and a voice, believed to belong to Nemmouche by police, claimed responsibility for the museum shooting in an audio commentary. He was said to have had a white sheet emblazoned with the name of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Nemmouche, who has Algerian as well as French citizenship, resisted extradition to Belgium. He has denied the charges against him.Of guns and ballot boxes: Jews are unnerved, but Europe is not sinking into violent anti-Semitism , economist.com. On 29 July 2014, Nemmouche was extradited to Belgium. Analysis of a telephone call made by Abdelhamid Abaaoud established that he was in contact with Nemmouche during January 2014. Abaaoud was the ringleader of a series of coordinated terrorist attacks in Paris that occurred on 13 November 2015. = Indictment = The Belgian federal prosecutor's office, which was responsible for the investigation, requested the council chamber of the tribunal of first instance of Brussels to start indictment proceedings for Nemmouche and Bendrer at the end of 2017. The federal prosecutor's office also requested that the charges against a third suspect, a friend of Bendrer who had been implicated, be dismissed. On 25 January 2018, the council chamber ruled on the requests: Nemmouche and Bendrer were referred to the chamber of indictment of the court of appeal of Brussels, but so was the third suspect. Despite the request of the federal prosecutor's office, the charges against the latter were thus not dismissed. On 19 April 2018, the chamber of indictment ruled on the issue: Nemmouche and Bendrer were formally indicted, but contrary to the council chamber the chamber of indictment considered the evidence against the third suspect to be too weak. The third suspect was thus not indicted and the charges against him dismissed. This meant that only Nemmouche and Bendrer would stand trial for the terrorist attack before the court of assizes.  Court trial  = Hearings =  Preliminary proceedings  In January 2019, the trial of Mehdi Nemmouche and Nacer Bendrer, who was accused of being an accomplice, started before the court of assizes of Brussels. In the Belgian criminal justice system, a court of assizes holds jury trials for the most serious crimes. It is a non-permanent court that is only composed once a case has been referred to it by means of an indictment. A few weeks before the actual start of the trial, a preliminary hearing took place on 20 December 2018, during which a list of about 120 witnesses, which were to be heard in the case, was decided on. A request by Nemmouche's defence attorneys to adjourn the case was refused. On 7 January 2019, three days before the start of the actual trial, the members of the jury were selected. For the jury selection, 200 Belgian citizens were summoned to the Palace of Justice of Brussels, where the trial was held. After a dozen of prospective jurors were challenged by both the defence and the prosecution, eight men and four women were eventually empaneled as jurors. An additional twelve people were also selected as alternate jurors.  Accusation  On 10 January 2019, the actual trial started with the prosecution reading the 195-page \\"act of accusation\\" to the court and jury, wherein it described the charges brought against the two men and the evidence gathered during the investigation. On 15 January, the defence attorneys of Nemmouche, amongst which Henri Laquay and Sebastien Courtoy, presented their \\"act of defence\\" in turn, in which they listed seven main arguments against the charges. They focused on the perceived lack of DNA traces on some of the material evidence, and accused the Mossad (foreign intelligence agency of Israel) of having set up Nemmouche. According to the defence, the Riva couple that were killed in the shooting were not tourists, but members of the Mossad. They also accused the Belgian investigators of being complicit and having doctored the evidence to frame Nemmouche. After the presentation of the defence, the presiding judge questioned both accused. Nemmouche admitted to being in the possession of the weapons, but denied having committed the attack. He refused to answer any further questions. Bendrer in turn answered the questions of the judge. He admitted Nemmouche asked to provide him with weapons, but denied having done so.  Testimonies  Over the next weeks, the court heard the testimonies of the firsthand witnesses, first responders, investigators, experts, and family members of both the victims and the accused. An important testimony was that of two French journalists, Didier Fran√ßois and Nicolas H√©nin, who had been held hostage from 2013 to 2014 in Syria by ISIS operatives. They testified that Nemmouche, under the alias \\"Abu Omar\\", was one of their guards and torturers, and described him as being \\"sadistic, playful and narcissistic\\". The former director of the prison in Salon-de-Provence, France, in which both accused had been incarcerated in the past, testified that Nemmouche had radicalised during his prison stay. There was disagreement whether Bendrer also adhered to radical Islamic beliefs at the time. During the hearings, the investigators also rejected the assertion that the Riva couple were intelligence officers for the Mossad, as did attorneys of the Riva couple's family. Whilst the wife, Miriam Riva, did work for the Mossad until her retirement, she did so as an accountant and never came into contact with any intelligence operations, they stated. A few incidents occurred during the trial hearings as well. Specifically, some jurors had to be replaced by alternate jurors for various reasons, such as illness or speaking out of court. In addition, on 29 January 2019, a dossier related to the case was stolen from the office of an attorney for one of the civil parties. The theft did not have an impact on the trial though.  Closing arguments  After all witnesses were heard, closing arguments were presented by all parties starting from 18 February 2019. First the attorneys for the civil parties (aggrieved parties seeking compensation, such as the victims' families) presented their arguments, and the following week the prosecution and defence did so too. According to the prosecution, it was clear that Nemmouche was the perpetrator of the attack. Bendrer on the other hand was not aware of what Nemmouche was going to do with the weapons he supplied, according to the prosecution, and should therefor not be found guilty of being a co-author but rather of being an accomplice in the attack (i.e. Bendrer's help was not indispensable in committing the attack). The defence of Nemmouche in turn brought up a number of arguments that in their view would prove Nemmouche was not the perpetrator, but rather the victim of an elaborate set-up. Amongst other things, they mentioned a lack of footage from security cameras other than those of the museum, accused the two French journalists who testified during the trial of lying, and suggested Nemmouche's DNA material was planted at the scene after the attack. According to the defence, Nemmouche was recruited by Iranian and Lebanese security services after being released from prison in 2012, and went to Syria to infiltrate ISIS on their behalf, after which he was sent to Brussels. They claimed that the victims were in fact Mossad operatives who were liquidated by the aforementioned security services, and that Nemmouche was used as a scapegoat. On 4 March 2019, all parties were given the opportunity to reply to each other's arguments. The civil parties and the prosecution decried the defence's claims that Nemmouche was set up as conspiratorial, incoherent and false. They also took offence to the defence trying to shift the blame for the attack to the victims. The defence in turn held on to its arguments. The next day, the accused were given the last word before the jury would retire to consider its verdict. Whilst Nemmouche had remained silent throughout the trial up to that point, he did speak shortly. He endorsed the plea of his attorneys and stated he was indeed framed. Bendrer also spoke and stated he was afraid to be convicted. = Verdict =  Mehdi Nemmouche  Jury verdict (in French) On 7 March 2019, Mehdi Nemmouche was found guilty by the jury of the terrorist murders of the four individuals in the museum attack, and of the illegal possession of the weapons used in the attack. In the reasoning the jury gave for its verdict, required by Belgian law, the main evidence against Nemmouche was summed up. The evidence against Nemmouche that convinced the jury included the fact he was carrying the weapons used in the attack with him when he was arrested in Marseille, together with the clothing the perpetrator worn as seen on the security footage from the museum. Both the weapons and the clothing had his DNA on them, and gunshot residue was also found on the clothing in question. A footprint of the sneakers he had with him was found on the entrance door of the museum. When he was arrested, he was also carrying some electronic media with him, on which videos were discovered wherein Nemmouche claimed responsibility for the attack in the name of ISIS. An ISIS flag used in the videos was found along the weapons Nemmouche had with him upon his arrest. On other electronic media belonging to Nemmouche data was discovered, such as web browsing history, which proved Nemmouche had been planning the attack. Eyewitnesses identified Nemmouche as being the perpetrator. Lastly, on a computer belonging to Najim Laachraoui, one of the suicide bombers of the 2016 Brussels bombings, conversations were discovered wherein Nemmouche was described as a \\"brother\\", and plans were discussed to liberate him from his incarceration. The jury considered that the material evidence and eyewitness testimony proved Nemmouche was the perpetrator of the attack. Based on the security footage of the museum, the expert testimony of the medical examiners who examined the bodies of the victims, and the type of weapons used, the jury found Nemmouche had the intention to kill. The jury furthermore affirmed the premeditated nature of the killings based on the preparatory acts Nemmouche carried out, such as the procurement of the weapons he used. The terrorist intentions of Nemmouche were upheld based on his jihadist stay in Syria from 2013 to 2014, the videos he made in which he claimed responsibility for the attacks in the name of ISIS, and the conversations about Nemmouche retained from Najim Laachraoui's computer. The verdict also rejected the claim that Nemmouche was set up by intelligence officials. The jury lamented that the defence did not bring forward any element that would support those allegations. The existence of a set-up was therefor deemed to lack \\"sufficient plausibility and credibility\\".  Nacer Bendrer  Aside from Nemmouche, the jury also found Nacer Bendrer guilty of weapons crimes and of being the co-author, and not just the accomplice, of the terrorist attack by supplying the weapons and ammunitions Nemmouche used. According to Belgian law, being the co-author of a crime means that one's aid was indispensable in the commission of the crime, i.e. that the crime would not have happened without this aid. The verdict stated Bendrer was aware of Nemmouche's radicalisation and adherence to Islamic extremist beliefs from when they got to know each other in 2009, during their incarceration in Salon-de-Provence, France. Telephone data showed that, after having had no contact for four years, Nemmouche sought contact again with Bendrer on 9 April 2014, after which Bendrer traveled to Brussels a few days later. After numerous contacts since, Nemmouche traveled to Bendrer's hometown Marseille, France on 24 April 2014, and telephone data pinpointed him in the area of Bendrer's home around that time. After Nemmouche's return to Brussels, all contact ceased between them two. Investigators testified they took steps to hide their communications and encounters, by for example switching between multiple phone numbers and SIM cards. The jury concluded their encounters could only have served to provide Nemmouche with weapons, because of the absence of any other plausible reason Bendrer had to travel to Brussels, because of the absence of any other source where Nemmouche could have procured the weapons from, and because Bendrer had later also admitted to investigators to have supplied Nemmouche with the weapons. As to the defence's argument that Bendrer did not know to which crime he would contribute, the jury retorted that Bendrer wilfully omitted to inform himself. The jury found that Bendrer should have known the weapons would be used to perform a terrorist act, based on their nature and based on the radicalisation of Nemmouche that Bendrer was aware of. = Sentence = Sentencing judgment (in French) After the guilty verdict for both men, a sentencing hearing was held on 11 March 2019. Nemmouche and Bendrer could both have been sentenced to life imprisonment for the crimes they had been found guilty of. The prosecution did not see any mitigating circumstances on the part of Nemmouche, and requested a sentence of life imprisonment for him. Regarding the second accused, the prosecution requested a somewhat lighter sentence of 30 years of imprisonment for Bendrer because he did not directly participate in the killings. The prosecution also requested to sentence both men to a 15-year period of judicial surveillance. This provision would mean that if they would ever be released on parole, they would be monitored by a sentence enforcement court, which could potentially revoke their release and order their incarceration for an additional 15 years. Bendrer's defence stressed he should not be treated the same way as Nemmouche, and that him having to live with the label of \\"terrorist\\" for the rest of his life was already a punishment in itself. Nemmouche's defence chose not to present any argument about the sentence. After the court deliberated with the jury on the penalty, as per Belgian law, both men were sentenced on 12 March 2019: Nemmouche was sentenced to life imprisonment, while Bendrer received a 15-year prison sentence. In addition, Nemmouche was sentenced to a 15-year period of judicial surveillance, and Bendrer to a 5-year period of such surveillance. In its judgment, the court stated that the terrorist attack on the Jewish Museum constituted an attack on the fundamental values of Belgian society, in particular the freedom of religion of the Jewish community of Belgium. The court considered Nemmouche's troubled upbringing to be no mitigating circumstance for such a grave act, and it also took into account the violent nature of the murders, Nemmouche's rejection of the rechtsstaat, and his complete lack of empathy and respect for his victims, amongst other factors. According to the court, he presented a high risk of recidivism. Regarding Bendrer on the other hand, the court described him as having played a decisive role in the attack by supplying the weapons used to Nemmouche. The court considered he knew what they would be used for, and was indifferent to the consequences to others. However, the court also upheld some mitigating circumstances, such as Bendrer having steered clear of any Islamic extremism since his arrest, and him having shown empathy and regret for the victims. Bendrer was deemed to present a low risk of recidivism. = Damages = Bendrer later lodged an appeal in cassation against his conviction with the Court of Cassation. This meant the civil part of the proceedings before the court of assizes (without the jury) with regards to damages had to be postponed. On 18 September 2019, the Court of Cassation rejected the appeal, which established the criminal sentence as final. Subsequently, on 22 October 2019 the court of assizes awarded 985,000 euro in damages to the victims' next of kin and the Jewish Museum, to be paid by both convicts.  Reactions  = Domestic =  Government  Belgium's Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo condemned the attack. \\"In Belgium we are not accustomed to such acts of barbarity,\\" he said. Belgian Foreign Minister Didier Reynders, who arrived at the museum shortly after the shooting, wrote on Twitter: \\"Shocked by the murders committed at the Jewish Museum, my thoughts go to the victims that I saw on the site and their families\\". Minister of the Interior, Jo√´lle Milquet speculated that anti-Semitism might be behind the shootings and Brussels Mayor Yvan Mayeur described them as a likely terrorist attack. Belgian politician Mischa√´l Modrikamen, leader of a small conservative party and himself a member of Belgium's Jewish community, said \\"Sadly, however, the actual attack comes as no surprise to us after years of living in an atmosphere of rampant anti- Semitism that often leads to violence.\\"  Organizations  Joel Rubinfeld of the Belgian League Against Antisemitism described the act as \\"the inevitable result of a climate that distills hatred... it will be necessary to use all legal means to silence the preachers of this hate who are responsible for spreading this virus of anti-Jewish hatred\\", specifically mentioning the anti-Zionist and Holocaust-denying representative, Laurent Louis, and controversial Black French comedian Dieudonn√© M'bala M'bala. Louis denied Rubinfeld's accusations, suggesting that the attack could have been a false flag operation seeking to discredit him and his political party, Debout Les Belges! (Rise Up, Belgians), on the eve of the Belgian federal elections. The League of Muslims in Belgium condemned the attack as \\"barbaric\\". In a statement the league said, \\"These crimes with racist and anti-Semitic accents are unfortunately likely to reverse in our country the efforts of all those who, on a daily basis, are working for a society where everyone, regardless of his religious and philosophical beliefs, can live in dignity and respect.\\" = International =  Countries  French President Fran√ßois Hollande condemned the \\"horrifying killings with the greatest force.\\" In a statement, he expressed France's solidarity with neighboring Belgium and condolences to the families of victims. Pope Francis, who was visiting the Middle East at the time of the attacks, said he was deeply saddened by the killings in \\"this criminal act of anti-Semitic hatred\\". \\"My thoughts go out to those who lost their lives in the attack in Brussels,\\" he said. \\"I entrust the victims to God.\\" Israeli President Shimon Peres also called upon European leaders to act against \\"any form of anti-Semitism\\" which he said was \\"rearing its head across the continent\\". Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman blamed anti-Israel incitement, especially in Europe, for the shooting, stating, \\"There are elements in Europe that rush to condemn the construction of a flat in Jerusalem but who do not rush to condemn, or offer only a weak condemnation of the murder of Jews here or in Europe itself.\\" He praised Elio Di Rupo, who telephoned to express condolences and update the Israeli leader on the investigation. Lieberman further stated that the attack was the result of European antisemitism and incitement against the Jewish State. Italian President Giorgio Napolitano recalled \\"the needing to keep in guard and be ready to wear out every regurgitation of antisemitism\\" and declared \\"I am always close to the world of Jewish communities yet again harshly hit\\". Ministry of Interior Angelino Alfano declared \\"Dead and injured from the Bruxelles' attack are also our dead and injured\\" and stressed that \\"there are no motives in the world that can allow all of this\\". Prime Minister of the Netherlands, Mark Rutte, conveyed his condolences to the prime ministers of Belgium and Israel. The Dutch minister of Foreign affairs, Frans Timmermans, expressed his solidarity to his Belgian colleague. He said that he was shocked by the cowardly attack. Carl Bildt, Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs, wrote on Twitter: \\"Despicable attack on the Jewish Museum in Brussels. An affront against the values our modern Europe represents.\\" Birgitta Ohlsson, Minister for EU Affairs, also wrote on Twitter: \\"I'm shocked about the anti-Semitic attack at the Jewish Museum in Brussels just one Day before the elections to the European Parliament.\\" Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement, offering condolences to the victims' families. In written statement, \\"Turkey hopes the attack was not related to \\"racist or anti- Semitic\\" motives. Or else we will be very concerned over the result of the latest EU Parliament elections, which was very disappointing.\\" Organizations Roger Cukierman, head of French Jewish Association (CRIF), called for more resources to be given to the French foreign intelligence service, the DGSE, to track militants returning to France from Syria. The European Jewish Association's General Director, Rabbi Menachem Margolin, thanked the European leaders who had condemned the attack for their remarks, but stressed that, \\"condemnation after a predictable attack is nothing but a way to cleanse one‚Äôs conscience...There is a need to establish a pan-European taskforce in order to annihilate anti-Semitism.\\" He later added that, \\"Such an attack was to be expected in light of rising anti-Semitism in Europe. The governments of Europe have to take steps, words aren't enough.\\" A spokesman for United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki Moon said in a statement that the Secretary General \\"reiterates his strong condemnation of all forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and trusts that Belgian authorities will do everything possible to bring the perpetrator or perpetrators of this crime to justice swiftly.\\" World Jewish Congress President Ronald S. Lauder reacted with shock, saying \\"Two years after Toulouse, and on the eve of the European elections, this despicable attack is yet another terrible reminder of the kind of threats Europe's Jews are currently facing.\\" See also *Antisemitism in contemporary Belgium *1981 Antwerp synagogue bombing *2011 Li√®ge attack *2016 Brussels bombings References Category:2014 in Brussels Category:2014 in Judaism Category:2014 mass shootings in Europe Category:2014 murders in Europe Category:2010s murders in Belgium Category:2010s trials Category:21st-century attacks on synagogues and Jewish communal organizations Category:21st-century mass murder in Europe Category:Antisemitic attacks and incidents in Europe Category:Antisemitism in Belgium Category:Attacks on buildings and structures in 2014 Category:Attacks on buildings and structures in Europe Category:Attacks on museums Category:Deaths by firearm in Belgium Category:Filmed killings Category:Islam and antisemitism Category:Islamic terrorism in Belgium Category:Islamic terrorist incidents in 2014 Category:Jewish Belgian history Category:Jews and Judaism in Brussels Category:Mass murder in 2014 Category:Mass murder in Europe Category:Mass shootings in Belgium Category:May 2014 crimes Category:May 2014 events in Europe Category:Murder trials Category:Terrorist incidents in Belgium in 2014 Category:Terrorist incidents in Brussels Category:Trials in Belgium ","title":"Jewish Museum of Belgium shooting"},{"id":"42854069","text":"Der Tog () was a Yiddish-language daily newspaper published in New York City from 1914 until 1971.

He was a partner in James Dickson Co who ran shipping and logging in Sweden. He was involved in unsuccessful court cases that accused his company of sawing up timber belonging to the crown at Baggb√∂le in northern Sweden. Life Dickson was born in Gothenburg in 1810. He was the eldest of four children born to Scotsman Robert Dickson (1782‚Äì1858) and Wilhelma Charlotta Dickson n√©e Murray. He was a partner in James Dickson Co who ran shipping and logging in Sweden. The business employed the largest merchant fleet in Sweden with offices in both Gothenburg and London. James Robertson Dickson was involved in establishing timber sawing and loading stations in many of the rivers of Norrland.Scots in Sweden, Scots in Sweden, by Jonas Berg and Bo Lagercrantz, retrieved 21 May 2014 Dickson was in charge of the largest water powered sawmill in Sweden on the Ume River at Baggb√∂le. Dickson awarded 50 Kroner to the local minister for his design work at the opening ceremony of, Baggb√∂le manor, the manager's impressive residence in 1847.Johan Anders Linder's diary At this mill the locals felled more trees on land that belonged to the Crown than they had agreed. So infamous were these methods that a new word in Swedish was derived from the village's name, \\"baggb√∂leri\\", a derogative term for deforestation.Baggbole , Umea.SE, retrieved 18 May 2014 Dickson's sawmill's business methods came to notice when the owner Dickson was taken to court on 15 June at Lycksele and 17 June 1850 at Degerfors district court. The case was circumstantial but the accusation was that Dickson had encouraged his suppliers upstream to supply him with logs that did not belong to them. Dickson said that the sawmill was processing a large number of logs but he was not aware where the logs came from. The case was complicated because the crown was well aware that various people were felling their trees and the local population was very grateful for the wealth that the sawmill was creating for its suppliers. Dickson was able to escape a conviction by swearing an oath regarding his lack of knowledge of what had happened. This was allowed under Swedish law where the case was circumstantial.The Term \\"Baggb√∂leri\\" , SkogsMuseet, retrieved 19 May 2014 Dickson was fortunate to avoid prosecution. Even if he had been unaware of it, his company was guilty of receiving stolen goods. Since 1842 his manager had taken in more than the 4,500 logs per annum than had been agreed. This could not continue and in 1866-7 the company was again taken to court. This was the first time the word \\"Baggb√∂leri\\" was seen in print. The rights to the timber was settled upon the farmers and the local villages. This put them in a position of power but the only viable purchaser was the sawmill, which meant that the sawmill was able to exploit its position over the farmers as it was the sawmill defining the price. This exploitation also went under the term \\"Baggb√∂leri\\". The sawmill was able to use its power to agree logging contracts with local villages. Under these agreements it was in no one's interest to replant the felled trees. This caused deforestation and in the 1880s the sawmills contracts had to be prevented to stop environmental damage. Dickson never married and died in Billdalsgatan, Askim in 1873 without children.

Originating in the Los Angeles / Hollywood underground rock clubs, the band quickly gained interest due to their songwriting and vocalist Gary X. Within their first year of forming the band signed with Relativity Records, established a publishing deal with (BMI), and replaced original guitar player with notable punk guitarist Duke Decter due to artistic differences. The band was short-lived due to the chemical dependencies among the band members resulting in the suicide/death of singer/songwriter Gary X.  History  One of the founding artists of the neo-punk movement in the early 1990s, The Ex- Idols were quickly signed by Sony Music Entertainment/Relativity Records in 1992 and released their CD single \\"Pill Popper\\" in 1993. The 4-song CD, also available in 7\\" vinyl form, includes one unreleased song \\"And I Was You.\\" Later in the same year Relativity Records released the first full-length CD by The Ex-Idols entitled \\"Social Kill\\" and released the first video for the self- titled track \\"Social Kill' directed by Jodi Wille. The Social Kill video appeared on MTV and VH1. The official single for the album was entitled \\"Go Away\\" and was written by guitarist Duke Decter. The single received heavy rotation radio play in all five major markets of the US: New York City, Chicago, Atlanta, San Francisco and Los Angeles. In 1994 Sony released the second video for the album in support of the single \\"Go Away\\" and put the band on tour. The Ex-Idols toured throughout the United States with support acts Total Chaos, NOFX, and UK Subs. In 1995 Relativity Records folded and the band was approached by Epitaph Records for their second album but were unable to negotiate a deal. The 2nd Ex-Idols album was entitled \\"Who We Are\\" and was later released independently by Refuse Music. The Ex-Idols broke up as a band in 1998 and moved in separate directions. Guitarist Duke Decter was picked up by RCA Records and toured with alternative artist Tim Skold, formerly of KMFDM and then Marilyn Manson. Bassist and drummer Sean DeMott and Lance Porter joined Frosted, the solo act of The Go-Go's guitarist Jane Weidlin. Singer/songwriter Gary X continued playing his own music in his own band Tuscaurora. In May, 2009, he was found dead in his hotel room due to suicide. He left behind three sons. Decter later joined up with his childhood bandmate Casey Chaos. In 2009, The Ex-Idols had a song from their 2nd album entitled \\"Fuck Everyone\\" appear on the television series Rescue Me (U.S. TV series) starring Denis Leary.

A 1903 graduate of Howard University School of Medicine, she was one of the few African-American women physicians of her generation. During the mid-1920s, she worked for the United States Children's Bureau; her work there involved traveling the rural South and training midwives to use sterile delivery techniques and to register births. During a time when maternity homes for unwed mothers were for white women only, she opened her home to unwed mothers of color. Eventually, with the help of donations, she established a separate home for her work with these women, which still bears her name. Early life and education Both of Whipper's parents were from African American families which had been free before the Civil War. Her father, the lawyer William James Whipper, moved from Philadelphia to South Carolina after the Civil War, becoming one of the first black judges in Reconstruction Era South Carolina. In Beaufort, South Carolina, he married Frances Anne Rollin. The couple had five children; Ionia was their third child. As a result of marital discord, during the 1880s Frances moved with her children to Washington, D.C., where Ionia grew up among the city's prosperous black middle class. Ionia Rollin Whipper graduated from Howard University School of Medicine in 1903, as one of four women in her class. Professional work Because her mother died before she completed medical school, Whipper borrowed money and worked as a teacher to support her own education. In 1911, she started her own private practice at 511 Florida Avenue NW, where she accepted only female patients. Whipper raised her brother, Leigh Whipper's, daughter, Leighla Whipper, who went on to become a songwriter and music publisher.Moore, J. M. (1999). Leading the Race: The Transformation of the Black Elite in the Nation's Capital, 1880-1920. University of Virginia Press. Between 1921 and 1929, Dr. Whipper worked for the United States Children's Bureau, which employed her to travel through the rural South educating midwives. When she returned to Washington, she joined the staff of the maternity department at Freedmen's Hospital. Charitable work After treating numerous unwed mothers, Dr. Whipper began to offer some of these young women room in her own home. In 1931, together with seven other women from St. Luke's AME Church, she organized a charitable group, the Lend- A-Hand Club, which raised funds to support unwed African-American mothers. In 1931, with the club's support, she purchased of land in the northwest part of Washington, D.C., where she opened the Ionia R. Whipper Home for Unwed Mothers, which served young women regardless of their race. Dr. Whipper continued to run the home until the early 1950s. Until the 1960s, when similar facilities for whites were desegregated, it was the city's only maternity home that admitted young African-American women. It relocated in 1955 to a different location, and it is still operating today. Later life In her later life, Dr. Whipper moved to New York, where she lived with relatives in Saratoga Springs and in New York City. She died at Harlem Hospital on April 13, 1953, and is interred in the columbarium at Fresh Pond Crematory.

History  The Rochester Department of Economics was established in 1957 when Lionel W. McKenzie was appointed as the first chairman. McKenzie was chosen on the recommendation of Paul Samuelson and Robert Solow who at the time were professors at MIT. Two of the first hires under McKenzie's chairmanship were Stanley Engerman and Ronald W. Jones, who remain affiliated with Rochester as Professors Emeriti. In 1962 the department awarded its first two Ph.D. degrees to Akira Takayama and Emmanuel Drandakis. Takayama would later go on to several faculty positions in the U.S. and Japan, authoring a widely used textbook in mathematical economics. Drandakis eventually came to head Athens University of Economics and Business. The association of Rochester economics with Japan was already well established in the department's early years by a series of students who completed the Ph.D. program, including Takayama. Many of these students studied under Jones and McKenzie. This relationship between Rochester and Japan was formalized in 1995 when McKenzie was awarded the Order of the Rising Sun by Emperor Akihito for his tutelage of Japanese economists. Among other early hires were Rudolph G. Penner, who later became head of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), and Robert W. Fogel, who was hired on the recommendation of Simon Kuznets. Before moving to the University of Chicago, it was at the University of Rochester that Fogel conducted his research on the canal system in the United States in the period of railroad building, for which he later received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. Around this time Fogel and recently hired Professor Stanley Engerman began a research program on the economics of slavery that would culminate in their provocative book Time on the Cross (1974), in which they argued that antebellum slavery was economically efficient. In more recent years, the department has solidified its historical strengths in economic theory and macroeconomics. The department appears within the top 15 in many rankings that are based on the quantity of research published in top academic journals. Rochester economics continues to have a prominent role in the field due, in part, to its affiliation with the Journal of Monetary Economics and its co-sponsorship of the Carnegie-Rochester Series on Public Policy with Carnegie Mellon University. The Carnegie- Rochester Series consists of a conference held at Carnegie Mellon in November and a conference held at Rochester each April. Each year the department sponsors several guest lecture series, including the Gilbert Lecture Series (1957 ‚ÄîPresent) and the McKenzie Lecture Series (1986 ‚Äî Present). Fifteen Gilbert Lecturers and thirteen McKenzie Lecturers subsequently received the Nobel Prize in Economics.

It is long and flows through Lawrence Township, Pine Township, and Goshen Township. Tributaries of the stream include Fork Run, Jerrys Run, and Flegals Run. Contaminants of Lick Run include manganese, acidity, and alkalinity. The pH of the stream and its tributaries ranges from 4.0 to 6.1 and the discharge of the main stem is between 1804.3 and 59564.65 gallons per minute, depending on the time and location. The drainage basin of Lick Run has an area of 27.5 square miles and is located in the Pittsburgh Low Plateaus Section of the Appalachian Plateaus geophysical province. The main rock types in the watershed are sandstone and interbedded sedimentary rock and the main soil types are the Hazleton- Cookport-Ernest series and the Hazleton-Dekalb-Buchanan series. Historic industries in the Lick Run watershed include logging and coal mining. The stream is designated as a high-quality coldwater fishery. Brook trout inhabit it, as do various types of aquatic macroinvertebrates. Course Lick Run begins near the western edge of Lawrence Township, close to the Panther Rocks and in Moshannon State Forest. Its source is a spring above Panther Rocks Camp. The stream begins flowing west and almost immediately exits Lawrence Township. Upon exiting Lawrence Township, the creek enters Pine Township. It then turns southwest and flows into a valley which gets deep very quickly. The creek then turns southeast and then south after a short distance, exiting Pine Township. It reenters the northern Lawrence Township and continues southeast, passing through Pennsylvania State Game Lands #90. The creek continues for several miles in the same direction before reaching the southern part of the township. It then receives the tributaries Slate Run and Fork Run before passing through the Baney Settlement. The creek briefly enters Goshen Township and turns south, reentering Lawrence Township. It turns east and begins to flow past strip mines. The creek begins to meander is it enters Goshen Township again and picks up the tributary Flegals Run. A short distance downstream, it crosses Pennsylvania Route 879 and enters the West Branch Susquehanna River. =Tributaries= Named tributaries of Lick Run include Fork Run, Flegals Run, and Jerrys Run. Fork Run enters Lick Run upstream of Baney Settlement. Its watershed mostly consists of forest and some areas of mining land. Jerry Run enters Lick Run upstream of the latter stream's confluence with the West Branch Susquehanna River. Its watershed mostly consists of abandoned mine lands. Flegals Run is the final tributary to enter Lick Run. Its headwaters are formed from acid mine drainage. The largest tributary of Lick Run is Stone Run, which is geographically similar to Lick Run and joins it one mile upstream of the Baney Settlement. Hydrology =Metals, acidity, and alkalinity= The daily load of manganese near the mouth of Fork Run is per day. The load of acidity near the mouth is per day and the daily load of alkalinity is . Immediately upstream of Flegals Run, the manganese load of Lick Run is per day. The daily loads of acidity and alkalinity at this location are and , respectively. Between Flegals Run and the mouth of Lick Run, the concentration of manganese is 0.7 milligrams per liter, the concentration of acidity is 22.37 milligrams per liter, and the concentration of alkalinity is 7.33 milligrams per liter. Between UNTUnnamed tributary 26087 and UNT 26085, the manganese load of Lick Run is per day. The daily alkalinity load is and the acidity load is per day. The concentrations of manganese, alkalinity, and acidity are 2.53 milligrams per liter, 12.97 milligrams per liter, and 7.67 milligrams per liter, respectively. Upstream of Fork Run, the stream's acidity load is per and its alkalinity load is per day. The concentrations of acidity and alkalinity at this place are 9.67 milligrams per liter and 7.33 milligrams per liter, respectively. The entire watershed of Lick Run downstream of and including UNT 26085 is considered by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection to be impaired. A tributary of Fork Run is also considered impaired. The remainder of the watershed meets the water quality standards of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection. =Discharge and pH= The discharge of Lick Run at the mouth of Fork Run ranges from 1804.3 to 38028.21 gallons per minute. Between UNT 26087 and UNT 26085, the stream's discharge ranges between 2264.76 and 58079.29 gallons per minute. The stream's discharge above Flegals Run ranges from 7065.01 gallons per minute to 51556.74 gallons per minute. Near its mouth, the discharge is between 1760.18 and 59564.65 gallons per minute. The uppermost reaches of the creek nearly run dry oftentimes during the summer. The pH of Lick Run at Fork Run's confluence with it ranges between 5.1 and 6.1. The pH between UNT 26087 and UNT 26085 is between 5.1 and 6.0 and the pH upstream of Flegals Run ranges from 5.0 to 5.6. Near the mouth of Lick Run, the pH is between 5.4 and 5.9. The lowest pH in the entire watershed is at a site on Flegals Run, where it ranges from 4.0 to 4.2. In Fall 2004, the pH of Lick Run was observed to be 4.1. In the upper reaches of Lick Run, its pH is lowest in the spring and highest in the summer. Geography, geology, and climate The watershed of Lick Run is located in the Pittsburgh Low Plateaus Section of the Appalachian Plateaus geophysical province. Most of the watershed of Lick Run (79.1%) lies over sandstone. The remaining 20.9% of the watershed's rock is interbedded sedimentary rock. The mail soil associations in the watershed are the Hazleton-Cookport-Ernest series, which occupies 48% of it and the Hazleton-Dekalb-Buchanan series, which occupies 24% of the watershed's area. 14.8% of the watershed consists of the Gilpin-Ernest-Cavode soil association and the Udorthents-Ernest-Gilpin soil association occupies 8.8% of the watershed's area. The elevation of the headwaters of Lick Run is higher than the elevation of the stream's mouth. The mouth's elevation is above sea level. Although there is little stream flow at the headwaters of Lick Run, there is some slightly further downstream. There are numerous pools in this area of the stream as well. Downstream of the tributary Doctors Fork, there are riffles and pools in it. The summers in the Lick Run watershed are warm, but the winters are long and cold. On average, the rate of precipitation is per year. Watershed The watershed of Lick Run has an area of 27.5 square miles. The upper reaches of it are mostly forested, but downstream of the communities of Goshen and the Baney Settlement, the dominant land use is coal mining land. 65.9 percent of the entire watershed's area is forested land and 27.7 percent is agricultural land. 3.9 percent of the watershed's area is developed and 2.5 percent of the watershed consists of former coal mines and quarries. Most of the agricultural land lies on former coal mining land.s The main roads in the vicinity of Lick Run are Pennsylvania Route 879 and Interstate 80. There are also a number of township roads in the watershed. Moshannon State Forest occupies much of the upper part of the watershed of Lick Run. History Martin Nichols constructed a sawmill on Lick Run in 1845. Another mill, known as Irvin's Mill, was built on the stream by Frederick P. Hurxthal. The Lick Run School was later established near the mill. On May 6, 1854, the Lick Run and Sinnemahoning Turnpike Company was incorporated. Its purpose was to construct a road between Lick Run and Bennett Branch Sinnemahoning Creek. Coal mining began in the watershed of Lick Run in the early 1800s and continues into the 21st century. Most of the mining activity has been surface mining, although there has been some deep mining as well. Large amounts of logging were also done in the late 19th century and early 20th century. Biology Lick Run is designated as a high-quality coldwater fishery. In 1931, the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission stated that the stream was \\"one of the best streams in this section of Clearfield County\\". In 1983, the Susquehanna River Basin Commission did a biological survey of the stream, finding that there were no fish there and only one species of macroinvertebrate ‚Äì a crayfish. Trout have historically been stocked on Lick Run. In 1957, the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission suggested no longer stocking trout on the stream below Fork Run. In 1985, trout stocking on the creek stopped altogether. Brook trout inhabit the stream downstream of the mouth of the tributary Doctors Fork. Near Panther Rocks Camp, the land in the vicinity of Lick Run is fairly open, with bog-like sphagnum seeps. Further downstream, a riparian buffer begins to develop, and remains highly intact for almost all of the stream's length. Still further downstream, pools of woody debris begin forming in the stream. Filamentous green algae was observed on the stream at Panther Rocks in May 2005. A wetland known as the SB Elliot Cabins Wetland is located at the headwaters of Lick Run. The Clearfield County Natural Heritage Inventory lists it as a significant site on the county level. Lick Run has a low level of biodiversity at Panther Rocks. In a 2004 benthic macroinvertebrate survey, only two alderfly larvae and one crayfish were observed here. Upstream of Doctors Fork, the survey observed 125 stonefly nymphs, 52 caddisflies, 5 alderfly larvae, 2 cranefly larvae, and a single crayfish. Downstream of Doctors Fork, 40 stonefly nymphs, 22 caddisfly larvae, and two alderfly larvae were observed. At the SGL #90 Bridge, 45 caddisfly larvae, 44 stonefly nymphs, 3 midge larvae, and 2 aquatic worms were observed by the survey. Upstream of the tributary Stone Run, the survey observed 83 stonefly nymphs, 53 caddisfly larvae, 8 alderfly larvae, 7 mayfly nymphs, 1 caddisfly, and 1 aquatic worm.

This reduction is a trade off that results in some loss of effectiveness of data management or data mining algorithms in order to gain some privacy. The t-closeness model extends the l-diversity model by treating the values of an attribute distinctly by taking into account the distribution of data values for that attribute. Formal definition Given the existence of data breaches where sensitive attributes may be inferred based upon the distribution of values for l-diverse data, the t-closeness method was created to further l-diversity by additionally maintaining the distribution of sensitive fields. The original paper by Ninghui Li, Tiancheng Li, and Suresh Venkatasubramanian defines t-closeness as: Charu Aggarwal and Philip S. Yu further state in their book on privacy-preserving data miningthat with this definition, threshold t gives an upper bound on the difference between the distribution of the sensitive attribute values within an anonymized group as compared to the global distribution of values. They also state that for numeric attributes, using t-closeness anonymization is more effective than many other privacy-preserving data mining methods. Data breaches and l-diversity In real data sets attribute values may be skewed or semantically similar. However, accounting for value distributions may cause difficulty in creating feasible l-diverse representations. The l-diversity technique is useful in that it may hinder an attacker leveraging the global distribution of an attribute's data values in order to infer information about sensitive data values. Not every value may exhibit equal sensitivity, for example, a rare positive indicator for a disease may provide more information than a common negative indicator. Because of examples like this, l-diversity may be difficult and unnecessary to achieve when protecting against attribute disclosure. Alternatively, sensitive information leaks may occur because while l-diversity requirement ensures ‚Äúdiversity‚Äù of sensitive values in each group, it does not recognize that values may be semantically close, for example, an attacker could deduce a stomach disease applies to an individual if a sample containing the individual only listed three different stomach diseases.

The practice was common in Scandinavia (√Ñnkekonservering/Enkekonservering) and Protestant parts of Germany (Konservierung von Pfarrwitwen). It is related to other forms of widow inheritance, including the levirate marriage known in the Old Testament as yibbum. At the introduction of the Protestant Reformation, priests were allowed to marry. However, as they did not own the vicarage and property attached to their profession, their wife and children were left without a home and means of support after their death. The future support of the widows and children of vicars thereby became a concern for the various churches. The most common solution was for the successor of a vicar to be required to marry the widow (or perhaps her daughter) of his predecessor, thereby \\"conserving\\" her. Denmark-Norway In the United Kingdoms of Denmark and Norway, the Kirkeordinansen or Church charter of 1537, issued by Christian III of Denmark after the Reformation in Denmark‚ÄìNorway and Holstein, secured for the widows of priests the right to a naadensaar (year of grace), during which they were secured an income from the parish of their late husbands and residence at the vicarage. Other than that, however, nothing was done to provide for priests' widows, and when the year was over, they were left to support themselves as well as they could, often as midwives or by some small business enterprise in the closest town. In 1566, a recommendation was issued in which priests were lectured to show mercy to the widows of their predecessors and let them stay in the vicarage, and some vicarages established a widow's house adjoining their vicarage.Pr√¶stegaardsliv i Danmark og Norge i Tidsrummet fra Reformationen til det syttende Aarhundredes Slutning Af Vilhelm Bang (1891) This proved to be insufficient, and by the early 17th century, it had become customary for a parish to elect a vicar on condition that he marry the widow of his predecessor. There was never any formal law to require this, and if the parish protested to the authorities against a vicar who broke his promise after having been elected, their complaints were given no support by the crown. However, in practice, this was an accepted custom which vicars adjusted to, and during the 17th century it was not uncommon for a woman to have been married to four priests in succession. In 1659, the first local pension fund for vicars' widows was established. This gradually became a more popular option, but some parishes continued to practise widow conservation until the late 18th century. Germany √Ñnnchen von Tharau =Brandenburg= In Mark Brandenburg, widow conservation was a common practice in the 17th century. In 1698, Frederick III of Brandenburg banned widow conservation by the Juramentum simoniae, as being a form of purchase of the vicarage office.W√ºrth: Pfarrwitwenversorgung. S. 180ff. =East Prussia= Widow conservation was a common practice in East Prussia. The practice was the center of the legend of √Ñnnchen von Tharau, which was inspired by the case of Anna Neander (1615‚Äì1689). =Mecklenburg= The first widow conservation in Mecklenburg is documented from 1551, and by 1580 it had become a common practice, which was recommended by the church order of 1602. By 1704, one third of all vicars' wives were the widow of the vicar's predecessor. From 1623 onward, however, there was also an increasing number of widow funds, which made widow conservation less necessary. The last widow conservation took place in the mid-19th century. =Pomerania= In Pomerania, the church synod of 1545 saw no other choice but to tolerate the practice, and in 1572, the conservation of the widow or daughter of a vicar was officially declared the duty of his successor. An attempt to replace it with a dowry provided by the congregations in 1575 failed. During the 18th century, the practice started to decline because of more alternatives, such as the foundation of a fund for vicars' widows in Swedish Pomerania in 1775.W√ºrth: Pfarrwitwenversorgung. S. 178 =Saxony= In the Duchy of Saxony, a strong policy to prevent widow conservation was enforced already when it occurred in the 16th century, and attempts of having a successor of a vicar marry the widow or daughter of his predecessor were actually prevented and contested when it did occur. Sweden- Finland Stormor i Dalom. In Sweden and Finland (then a Swedish province), the parish vicars were given permission to marry after the Swedish Reformation of 1527. The support of vicars' widows quickly became a concern: while priests and their families were being provided for by the income from their parish, this income was attached to their office, and the widow had no right to it after the death of the priest, which could place her in a difficult situation unless she, or her late spouse, had a personal fortune, which was normally not the case. After the death of a vicar, his widow was entitled to a N√•de√•r or N√•d√•r (Year of Grace) to live on the vicarage while preparing support for herself and her children. During that year, the parish were to select the next vicar. As the parish and church considered it their duty to support the widow of their former vicar, they normally chose a priest who expressed himself willing to marry the widow of his predecessor. The vicar's widow herself also seems to have played a part in electing the next vicar by using the influence she had in the parish by her position as vicar's wife. Another way to arrange the support of the widow was for the next vicar to marry her adult daughter, if she had one, or that the son of a vicar succeeded him.Karin Tegenborg Falkdalen: Kyrkomilj√∂ p√• Jamtli (2007) √ñstersund (Swedish) In the Swedish Church Ordinance 1571, the rules stated that the son or the son-in-law of the former vicar were to be considered first when a new parish vicar was chosen. During the 17th century, widow conservation was common practice and the majority of the vicar's wives were the widow or daughter of her husband's predecessor. The Swedish Church Law 1686 stated that when a new parish vicar was to be elected, the candidates who expressed themselves willing to marry the widow or daughter of his predecessor should be favored. This regulation was dropped in 1739, when the education of the vicars became the formal qualification to the office, but informally, the practice continued the entire 18th century, as the parishes continued to regard it their responsibility to support the vicars' wives, who were often locals and had strong positions in their parishes. There were also parishes which were formally inherited this way. In 1591, King John III of Sweden granted the Annerstad parish in Sm√•land to vicar Georgius Marci, to be inherited on both the male and female line by his descendants: either by a son, or by a successor married to a daughter or a widow of his predecessor. Upon the death of Marci in 1613, his parish was inherited by his son-in-law by marriage to his daughter, Kerstin Marca (1585‚Äì1653), who has been referred to as the first Swedish female to have formally inherited the right to a vicar's parish. The Annerstad parish was on several occasions inherited by females in the same fashion - such as for example by Gunilla Os√¶ngius in 1685 - until the year of 1780, when king Gustav III of Sweden refused the request of a vicars candidate to marry the 12-year- old daughter of the recently deceased vicar Anders Os√¶ngius. By the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th century, however, widow conservation quickly came out of use. The reasons were several: a different view upon marriage as more of a love union than a practical arrangement; that the education of the candidates, who were less often the sons of vicars, had become more important; and because the recently established retirement funds for vicar's widows made the solution less needed. The first retirement fund was Allm√§nna √Ñnke- och Pupillkassan i Sverige from 1740, granting pensions to destitute widows of civil servants; this was not sufficient, and during the 19th-century, the N√•d√•r was often prolonged upon application, until the more efficient retirement fund Pr√§sterskapets √Ñnke- och Pupillkassa exclusively for vicar's widows was established in 1874.Nordisk familjebok / Uggleupplagan. 22.

United Kingdom The term \\"Forward Movement\\" is said to have been used for the first time in the mid-1880s, at an informal gathering, by Mrs Maria McArthur, the wife of Alexander McArthur, an Irish-born Methodist businessman and politician who at the time lived in Brixton, London. The expression was quickly adopted more widely, with the encouragement of the Methodist leader, William Fiddian Moulton, and in 1891 a Welsh minister, John Pugh, and his friend Seth Joshua took the initiative in Wales by erecting a tent in Splott, Cardiff, as a way of starting a new Calvinistic Methodist church. It was acknowledged, however, that the origins of the movement went back as far as the 1870s. It was also closely associated with the\\"Holiness movement\\" and the work of American evangelical leader Robert Pearsall Smith. Another Welsh minister, Hugh Price Hughes, became the unofficial leader of the \\"Forward Movement\\" in the British Methodist denominations. The movement encouraged the building of Methodist Central Halls as social work centres as well as meeting- places. Hughes founded the Methodist Times in 1885, and the movement became closely associated with Liberal politics in the UK. The movement continued into the 20th century, with Martyn Lloyd-Jones becoming a notable leader in Wales. Abandoning his Harley Street medical practice in 1927, Dr Lloyd-Jones became minister of Bethlehem Evangelical Church in Port Talbot, originally built as an outlying mission of a Calvinistic Methodist Church in the town centre. This church remains open. United States The current Forward Movement in the United States is a ministry of the Episcopal Church in the United States, whose mission is to reinvigorate the life of the church. Since 1935, Forward Movement has published the quarterly devotional Forward Day by Day, as well as books and pamphlets that foster spiritual growth and encourage discipleship. As a self-sustaining agency of the church, Forward Movement relies on sales and donations to carry out its work. =History= Forward Movement was created during a time when the Episcopal Church seemed weary and divided. The 51st General Convention in 1934 charged the newly chartered Forward Movement to ‚Äúreinvigorate the life of the church and to rehabilitate its general, diocesan and parochial work.‚Äù Bishop Henry Hobson of Southern Ohio chaired the Forward Movement Commission, which consisted of five bishops, five priests, and ten laymen. Although the National Council gave a small subsidy during its first three years, Forward Movement soon became a self- supporting ministry, largely through literature sales. By the 1937 General Convention, Forward Movement had produced twenty-five tracts and booklets in addition to Forward Day by Day. All this was achieved through mostly volunteer labor, with the Diocese of Southern Ohio providing office space and support staff. The 1937 General Convention sought to integrate Forward Movement into the larger church by naming the new presiding bishop, Rt. Rev. Henry St. George Tucker of Virginia, as chair of the Forward Movement Commission, although Bishop Hobson continued to oversee operations in Cincinnati until 1976 (even after his retirement as bishop in 1969). Gilbert Symons became the Forward Movement's first editor and held the post until 1950. He wrote many of the early issues of Forward Day by Day, in addition to dozens of other titles. The Diocese of Southern Ohio paid Symons's salary, though he devoted nearly all his time to Forward Movement. The diocese also provided rent-free office space (though expenses were shared) in downtown Cincinnati (although for a time circa 2004 the Forward Movement's ministries used space outside downtown, it again has offices within diocesan headquarters). By 1940, Bishops Tucker and Hobson felt the National Council could assume many of Forward Movement's ministries. At the General Convention of that year, therefore, the Forward Movement Commission was not discharged. But Forward Movement's success as a publisher led Tucker to ask that the executive committee continue publishing literature for the church. To indicate the ministry's nature more clearly, the name was changed in 1949 to Forward Movement Publications. =Day by Day= Forward Movement's first publication was Forward Day by Day, a quarterly devotional magazine which has been published continuously since 1935. Circulation is now 300,000 printed copies per quarter, 84 percent of which is within The Episcopal Church, the rest going to other provinces of the Anglican Communion, primarily to the Anglican Church of Canada. In total, Forward Movement has subscribers in 68 nations. More than 100,000 copies of Forward Day by Day are distributed each year, at no charge, to prisons, jails, hospitals, convalescent homes, juvenile detention centers, and overseas military bases. =Forward Movement today= Forward Movement publishes more than one hundred other titles, mostly pamphlets and booklets, on prayer, discipleship, worship, sacraments, Anglican history and spirituality, and pastoral concerns. Roughly thirty new print titles are issued each year. Distribution is through an online bookstore, parish churches, and an annual catalog. Several titles are published in Spanish. Some current titles are available on the Amazon Kindle and Barnes & Noble Book stores, as well as other popular locations. Forward Movement's offices are located in downtown Cincinnati, Ohio, and have been since the company's inception.

At present, the two constituent republics of the proposed confederation have no diplomatic recognition, and Ukraine has classified them as terrorist organizations and refers to their territory as the Anti-Terrorist Operation Zone. The creation of Novorossiya was declared on 22 May 2014, and one month later spokespeople of both republics declared their merger into a confederal \\"Union of People's Republics\\". Within a year, the project was suspended: on 1 January 2015, founding leadership announced the project has been put on hold, and on 20 May the constituent members announced the freezing of the political project. Background Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics Novorossiya was the name of a territory of the Russian Empire formed from the Crimean Khanate and Zaporizhian Sich which was under a mutual condominium of the Russian Empire and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. The territory had been annexed several years after the Treaty of K√º√ß√ºk Kaynarca concluded the Russo-Turkish War in 1774. Novorossiya initially included today's Southern Ukraine as well as some parts of today's Russia such as Kuban. The modern Russian Black Sea coast that was occupied by indigenous Circassians under military protection of the Ottoman Empire was not conquered until 1829 and was ceded to Russia under the 1829 Treaty of Adrianople. The region was soon colonized by Ukrainian, Romanian, Russian, German, Greek, Bulgarian, Jewish and other settlers. The major cities were Odessa, Kherson, Mykolaiv, and Novorossiysk. In 1802 the province of Novorossiya was split into three Governorates. Most of 18th century Novorossiya was incorporated in 1917 into the newly proclaimed Ukrainian People's Republic because ethnic Ukrainians constituted the majority of the population. After the defeat of pro-independence Ukrainians in the Ukrainian‚ÄìSoviet War, the Soviet government confirmed that Southern Ukraine was part of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. The Novorossiya movement made its appearance in Odessa in August 1990. The movement, known as the Democratic Union of Novorossiya, argued that given the separate ethnos of the region it should have an autonomous status within a federated Ukrainian state. It campaigned for 'special state status' within 'the historical boundaries of Novorossiya (at the time Odessa, Mykolaiv, Kherson, Dnipropetrovsk, and Crimean Oblasts, and also part of the Dniester region of the Moldavian SSR). It failed, however, to gain popular support. In September 1990 Alexander Solzhenitsyn published an article in opposition to the cultural partition of Ukraine and Russia in which he references 'Novorossiya', i.e., \\"including those regions which have never been part of the traditional Ukraine: the 'wild steppe' of the nomads‚Äîthe latter \\"New Russia\\" [–ù–æ–≤–æ—Ä–æ—Å—Å–∏—è]--as well as the Crimea, the Donbass area, and the lands stretching east almost to the Caspian Sea\\".

This was necessitated, they explained, by the growth of 'nationalist tendencies' in Ukraine, its increasing isolationism, and diminishing ties with Russia. Three days after the 1 December 1991 referendum on Ukrainian independence, the mayor of St Petersburg, Anatoly Sobchak, argued that Russia had handed over to Ukraine \\"a whole series of Russian provinces, the so-called Novorossiya, whose population is for the most part Russian\\" and that the Russian minority in Ukraine was threatened with forcible 'Ukrainianisation'. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union the term Novorossiya began to be used again in calls for the independence or secession of regions of Ukraine corresponding to different areas. As late as September 1992, in Odessa, several organizations such as the Civic Movement of Odessa, Rus', the Socialist Party, and Novorossia are campaigning for the establishment of a separate Novorossian region, the exact borders of which were still being debated. In June 1994 the chairman of the Dniester Republic's supreme council made reference to Crimea, Odessa, and other oblasts as \\"Novorossiya\\". Dmitry Trenin of the Carnegie Moscow Center wrote that in 2005 and again in 2008 some quarters in Moscow, that were not entirely academic, discussed the idea of a Russia-friendly buffer state, \\"Novorossiya\\", being formed out of southern Ukraine from the Crimea to Odessa in response to perceived Western penetration into the former Soviet Union.Trenin, Dmitri. \\"Post-Imperium: A Eurasian Story\\", Carneigie Endowment for International Peace, 2011. p. 100. http://carnegieendowment.org/pdf/book/post-imperium.pdf The term Novorossiya came into usage in 2014 among Antimaidan protesters following the Euromaidan Ukrainian Revolution. On 17 April 2014, during talks in Geneva on resolving the rising unrest in southern and eastern Ukraine, President Putin stated at a question and answer session that even \\"in the tsarist days ‚Äì Kharkov, Lugansk, Donetsk, Kherson, Nikolayev and Odessa ‚Äì were not part of Ukraine\\" but part of Novorossiya, and that they had been irresponsibly ceded to Ukraine. On 29 August 2014 President Putin issued a statement addressed to the \\"Militia of Novorossiya\\" calling upon it to show humanitarian compassion and allow surrounded Ukrainian soldiers to withdraw and reunite with their families. This was the last official statement by President Putin addressing \\"Novorossiya\\". History =Formation= Pavel Gubarev (left) Alexander Zakharchenko, leader of the Donetsk People's Republic, 27 December 2014 The New Russia Party, founded on 13 May 2014 in Donetsk, Ukraine, declared on its first congress of 22 May 2014 the formation of a new self-declared state named 'Novorossiya', inspired by the historical region of the Russian Empire that carried that name. The congress was attended by separatist officials of the Donetsk People's Republic, Donbass People's Militia as well as by the Donetsk Republic leader Pavel Gubarev, ultranationalist/Stalinist writer Alexander Prokhanov, nationalist bolshevist political scientist and Eurasia Party leader Aleksandr Dugin, and Valery Korovin. According to Gubarev the state would include Kharkiv, Kherson, Dnipropetrovsk, Mykolaiv, Odessa and Zaporizhia. Two days later, the self-appointed 'Prime Minister' of Donetsk Alexander Borodai and Luhansk \\"head of the Republic\\" Aleksey Karyakin signed a document behind closed doors formalizing their merger into the new confederation. Great Patriotic War Victory Day celebrations in Donetsk on 9 May 2014 referendum organised by pro-Russian separatists. A line to enter a polling place in Donetsk, 11 May 2014 In an interview on 31 May, Denis Pushilin, then acting as head of state of the Donetsk People's Republic, stated that Novorossiya currently existed as a union of people's republics, but cooperation could be deepened if more territories were to join. On 24 June, the two People's Republics proclaimed their accession to the union of people's republics, and at the second plenum of the new Parliament of Novorossiya on 15 July, the confederation adopted the official name of Novorossiya. Since 2 November 2014 Donbass parliamentary elections the Parliament did not gather anymore. Parallel December 2014 declaration On 12 December 2014, a \\"Congress of Deputies of All Levels\\" led by former DPR deputy foreign minister Boris Borisov, alongside figures such as Pavel Gubarev, issued a renewed declaration of the state sovereignty of the \\"Union of Sovereign Republics\\" of Novorossiya, claiming it to be an amendment of the 1922 Treaty on the Creation of the USSR. In contrast to the May agreement, the new declaration aimed to build a new executive \\"from scratch\\". An official of the DPR responded that although Borisov was well-intentioned, his initiative did not have the material backing necessary for success. =Suspension of the project= On 20 May 2015 supporters of the LNR and the DNR officially announced the freezing of the \\"New Russia\\" project and the closure of the related structures of political technology. Oleg Tsarev, chairman of the movement \\"New Russia\\" said that the activities of the Joint Parliament of Novorossiya are frozen because the confederation did not comply with the Minsk II accords. On 11 May 2014, a referendum on self-determination in eight regions (Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhia, Odessa, Luhansk, Mykolaiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, and Donetsk) was not held as expected, but only in the Lugansk and Donetsk republics. On 24 May 2014, delegates from these eight regions created the Joint Parliament of New Russia; however, this proved to be only virtual in nature as the political structure was unclaimed: the expected delegation of representatives did not occur, leading to curtailment of the Parliament initiative. The status of Novorossiya came into dispute on 26 May 2014, when according to Bolotov, \\"none of the agreements have been concluded\\" but the intention is to form a \\"Union of People's Republics\\". On 1 January 2015, former Donetsk Republic Prime Minister Alexander Borodai, who resigned on 7 August 2014, stated that \\"there is no Novorossiya\\" and that the proposed state was a \\"dream that was not brought to life\\" and called it a false start. On 8 June 2015, the leaders of DPR and LPR submitted their proposed changes to the Constitution of Ukraine that, while calling for wide autonomy of the Donbass region, conceded them as territories of Ukraine. No change was proposed regarding the status of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea as part of Ukraine, considering the status of Crimea outside their purview. This was imputed by news agencies as a recognition by the leaders of DPR and LPR of Ukrainian sovereignty over Crimea. Given this interpretation, these changes were withdrawn within hours, and on 15 June 2015, DPR \\"Prime Minister\\" Alexander Zakharchenko claimed that the DPR \\"will never be part of Ukraine\\".Donetsk People‚Äôs Republic Will Never Be Part of Ukraine ‚Äì Leader , Sputnik (news agency) (15 June 2015) In mid-June 2015, Igor Girkin said that the situation in Novorossiya was a \\"colossal failure\\" no one knew how to patch up, and that the plan was to negotiate the return of the autonomous regions of Donetsk and Lugansk to Ukraine in return for Ukraine's de facto acceptance of the annexation of Crimea to the Russian Federation, the gradual withdrawal of sanctions, and the return of all other territories to their previous condition. According to Girkin, should such a \\"wonderful\\" plan be realised, Ukraine would become a federal state. \\"Consequently, in such a manner, a safety catch would be put in place for its entry into NATO. Russia would get leverage over Kyiv in the form of the autonomous regions, and everything would settle down.\\" On 9 June 2016, an anonymous Russian businessman averred that the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 forfeited any chance to create the confederation. =Similar proposal= A project was declared on 18 July 2017 by the Donetsk People's Republic to include all of Ukraine, but the name was changed to \\"Malorossiya\\" (Little Russia).Ukraine Separatists Criticized Over Call For Creation Of 'Little Russia' , Radio Free Europe (18 July 2017) The Luhansk People's Republic however stated that it would not be taking part in the project.

Political career A Ruth Coppinger election placard for the 2020 Irish general election, advocating free public transport. Coppinger was a member of Fingal County Council for the Mulhuddart local electoral area from 2003 to 2014. She was co-opted to the council in 2003, replacing Joe Higgins. She was elected in 2004 and re-elected in 2009. She was an unsuccessful candidate for the Socialist Party at the 2011 Dublin West by- election. She later joined party colleague Joe Higgins in the D√°il, as a result of the 2014 by-election in the same constituency. After being elected, she called for a mass campaign of opposition to water charges being implemented by the Fine Gael-Labour Party coalition. In November 2014, she called for the gradual nationalisation of US multinationals to prevent job losses. In response, Fianna F√°il‚Äôs jobs spokesperson Dara Calleary called the idea ‚Äúreckless and ludicrous‚Äù, as it would \\"place a massive burden on taxpayers and the public finances.\\". In September 2015, she joined homeless families from Blanchardstown, in occupying a Nama-controlled property as part of a campaign to raise awareness of the housing crisis. In October 2015, she joined families in their occupation of a show house in her constituency, to protest at the lack of availability of affordable social housing. She has also supported the tenants of Tyrrelstown, who were made homeless when a Goldman Sachs vulture fund sold their houses. She was re-elected to the D√°il at the 2016 general election, this time under the Anti-Austerity Alliance‚ÄìPeople Before Profit banner. On 10 March 2016, at the first sitting of the 32nd D√°il, she nominated Richard Boyd Barrett for the office of Taoiseach, quoting James Connolly from a hundred years previously when she said: \\"The day has passed for patching up the capitalist system. It must go\\" and declaring: \\"We will not vote for the identical twin candidates\\" of Fine Gael and Fianna F√°il after they \\"imposed austerity\\". On 6 April 2016, following the failure of the D√°il to elect a Taoiseach at that first sitting, Coppinger was nominated for the role of Taoiseach, becoming the first female nominee in the history of the state. In April 2018, in the lead-up to the repeal of the Eight Amendment, Coppinger along with her colleague Paul Murphy held up a Repeal sign during leader's questions and was reprimanded by the Ceann Comhairle. Coppinger is a vocal advocate for abortion rights in Ireland, and was a founding member of ROSA, a movement for reproductive justice in Ireland. Earlier, in 2016, Coppinger tabled the private members' motion to repeal the 8th amendment. In November 2018, Coppinger protested the conduct of a rape trial in Ireland in a sitting of D√°il. During the trial, the defence team cited that the 17-year-old victim had worn a thong with a lace front as part of their argument that the sex had been consensual. The defendant was subsequently found not guilty. During a sitting of the D√°il, Coppinger held up a similar pair of underwear and admonished the conduct of the trial, suggesting victim-blaming tactics had been used and suggested this was a routine occurrence in Irish courts. She called on the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar to support her party's bill that would increase sex education in Irish schools and provide additional training to the Irish judiciary and jurors on how to handle cases of rape. Varadkar responded that victims should not be blamed for what happens to them, irrespective of how they are dressed, where they are or if they have consumed alcohol. She unsuccessfully contested the 2020 Seanad election for the NUI constituency. Personal life Coppinger lives in Mulhuddart. She is a secondary school teacher. Her eldest brother Eugene Coppinger served on Fingal County Council from 2011 to 2019.

It was formed as the Napanee, Tamworth and Quebec Railway (NT&QR;), chartered in 1878 by Edward Rathbun and Alexander Campbell, with plans to run from Napanee through Renfrew County and on to the Ottawa Valley. Lacking funding from the governments, development never began. Rathburn took over the charter in 1881. He started construction with the shorter Bay of Quinte Railway and Navigation Company (BQR&NC;) that ran from his factories in Deseronto to the Grand Trunk Railway mainline at Napanee. Construction on the NT&QR; out of Napanee through Yarkers to Tamworth started the same year, but was abandoned by the contractor and Rathburn had to pay the workers out of pocket. The line finally opened to Tamworth in 1884. In 1889 it was extended westward to Tweed while a branch eastward from Yarker to Harrowsmith connected to the Kingston and Pembroke Railway with running rights to Kingston. In 1890 the line was renamed the Kingston, Napanee & Western Railway, and the next year it was leased to the BQR&NC.; The eastern branch was extended from Harrowsmith to Sydenham in 1893. In 1897, the two sections were legally merged into the newly formed Bay of Quinte Railway. In 1903 the final expansion was made northwestward from Tweed to connect to the Central Ontario Railway at Bannockburn, with a total of . The line was purchased by the Canadian Northern Railway (CNoR) in 1910, using its line from Napanee through Sydenham as the basis of a major expansion to Smiths Falls and onto Ottawa. CNoR's bankruptcy in 1918, followed by the Grand Trunk in 1923 led to the formation of the Canadian National Railways (CNR). Parts of the network were closed starting in 1935, and the last BQR fragment, from Napanee's historic 1856 Grand Trunk station to a Goodyear tire factory, was disconnected from the CN mainline at Napanee station in 2010.http://tracksidetreasure.blogspot.com/2010/09/cns- millhaven-spur.html History In 1848, an American partnership purchased land near Culbertson's Wharf, building a sawmill to process logs from four million acres of timberland in the Trent River, Moira River, Salmon River and Napanee River watersheds. In 1855, Hugo Burghardt Rathbun moved to the area to take over the running of the business under the Rathbun Company name. The growing village was incorporated in 1871 as Mill Point and was renamed Deseronto in 1881. Hugo's son, Edward Wilkes Rathbun expanded the company's enterprises, opening a cedar mill, a flour mill and a sash, door and blind factory; he operated tugboats and lake freighters to carry cargo to Oswego, New York. He later added four passenger ships and, by the 1880s, held a stake in three railways: the Bay of Quinte Railway, the Napanee and Tamworth Railway and Gananoque's Thousand Islands Railway. He operated a 250-acre farm to provide horses for the logging operations and railway car shops to build rolling stock, along with general stores, a newspaper and various manufacturing works. At its 1895 peak, Deseronto's population reached 3338 people and Edward Wilkes Rathbun was a millionaire; an 1896 fire on the timber docks did a quarter-million dollars on damage, and the gradual depletion of natural resources (timber and minerals) on which the Rathbun business relied brought the company's activities to a halt by 1916. The Bay of Quinte railway, originally constructed to bring Rathbun's timber to market, was sold to Canadian Northern Railway in 1910 for inclusion in its Ottawa-Toronto mainline. CNoR reached the Pacific coast by 1915, but by 1918, it was bankrupt. Canadian National took over the CNoR network in 1923, embargoing the former BQR mainline in 1979 and removing the tracks in 1986.

The BQR was constructed in multiple segments: * The Bay of Quinte Navigation and Railway Company's own line ran from Napanee to Deseronto. It originally carried freight from Rathbun's steamships \\"Deseronto\\" and \\"Quinte\\", which ran Napanee-Deseronto-Picton, to the Grand Trunk Railway mainline. * Rathbun was one of multiple stakeholders in an 1879 Napanee, Tamworth and Quebec Railway which continued from Napanee to Tamworth, connecting to the Grand Trunk Railway in Napanee. The line was extended to Tweed before running out of money, but never reached Ottawa-Hull. Renamed the Kingston, Napanee and Western, it was leased to the BQR; the NT&Q and BQR lines were eventually merged. * An 1889 extension from Tamworth to Harrowsmith allowed connection to the Kingston and Pembroke Railway to reach Kingston. * An 1893 extension from Harrowsmith reached mica mines at Sydenham Lake. * A 1902 branch line joined the BQR mainline at Yarker to the Central Ontario Railway at Bannockburn, Ontario. CNoR incorporated the BQR line into its own mainline to Smiths Falls; CN abandoned the Tweed to Bannockburn line in 1935 and Tweed to Yarker in 1941, leaving just the Smiths Falls mainline. That line was embargoed in 1979, abandoned in 1984 and removed in 1986. The right of way from Smiths Falls to Strathcona, near Napanee, is now the Cataraqui Trail, a multi-use recreational trail operated by the Cataraqui Region Conservation Authority.http://www.cataraquitrail.ca The Bay of Quinte Navigation and Railway Company also owned the Rathbun dock in Gananoque, Ontario; it entered a contract in which that town raised $10,000 in debentures in return for a short line to be constructed from GTR's Gananoque railway station to the downtown waterfront. This Thousand Islands Railway is now defunct, but one locomotive has been preserved at the former station beside Gananoque's town hall.

As the world's last human fighting off incoming alien freaks from atop a ziggurat, the player uses touch controls to charge and shoot the enemies away, and dies if hit by an enemy. The game has 16-bit graphics style and an 8-bit chiptune soundtrack. Action Button designer Tim Rogers developed the game idea based on his experience with Angry Birds, which later led to his forming Action Button as a company with Ziggurat as its first release on February 17, 2012. The game received \\"generally favorable\\" reviews, according to video game review score aggregator Metacritic. Reviewers praised Ziggurat nuanced controls and minimalism. Time magazine picked the game as one of the best for the then new high-resolution third generation iPad.  Gameplay  The player charges their shot as enemies approach from both sides of the screen As the \\"Last Human on Earth\\", the player fights off approaching enemies with their laser rifle. The player-character, stationary atop a mountain peak (ziggurat) at the top of the world and end of time, attacks incoming mono-eyed alien freaks and dies upon the first hit from any enemy. The player earns a score based on their number of aliens killed before succumbing. The aliens vary in size and shape, from \\"blue freaks\\" who pogo like the Tektites from Zelda, to stealth yellow freaks, to shielded, aggressive red freaks, to bullet-sponge giant freaks. There are two shooting modes: Precision and Slingshot. In Precision, players control the shot by sliding their fingers along the bottom of the screen, which calculates the arc and direction of the shot. In Slingshot, like Angry Birds, players draw back their shots like slingshots. The shot grows in power the longer the screen is held, and the shot is fired when the player lets go. Weak shots will also arc down with gravity, and strong shots will decrease in power if held too long. There are no power-ups, no gamified micropayments, and no pause function, but there are achievements such as living to see the end of the universe. It also integrates \\"pro-social\\" features like GameCenter and Twitter. Ziggurat uses retro-style 16-bit graphics and an 8-bit chiptune soundtrack. The player-character is blonde and dressed in a red jumpsuit, and clouds pass by in parallax motion in the background. The sun's position in the distance appears as a function of game's duration. The chiptune soundtrack includes wailing solos, and its pitch appears to intensify with the game's difficulty. The player's death is accompanied by a \\"wince-inducing digital screech\\" or siren and a \\"blood-red screen\\".  Development  Action Button Entertainment was founded by Tim Rogers. The studio consists of Rogers, Brent Porter, Michael Kerwin, and Nicholas Wasilewski, who have built all of the studio's four games from Ziggurat through Videoball. Their games are consistently simple in their aesthetics and controls. Rogers cited Angry Birds as the inspiration for Ziggurat. He found the former \\"an incredible collision of game design concepts\\" that worked, though he wanted the game to be more of a \\"driving range\\" where he could throw birds at falling stuff, an idea which he refined into a Raiders of the Lost Ark-themed game of slowly hurling projectiles that push back bats in a corridor with no limit of projectiles. When riding the Bay Area Rapid Transit from Oakland to San Francisco a year later, Rogers watched a man play Angry Birds as he perfected a level, whereupon Rogers decided to make his game idea. He asked his friend and indie developer Adam Saltsman for advice, who confirmed and encouraged Rogers's interest in trying Flixel, the Adobe Flash tools used to make Saltsman's Canabalt. Upon deciding that he lacked the expertise, he tweeted to recruit others on the project and received some responses that later fell through. Rogers continued to work as a video game design consultant and met Bob Pelloni (of Bob's Game) at the 2010 Game Developers Conference. The two worked on games (including Ziggurat) together. Rogers put out a call for artists on Twitter with a submissions request of \\"fan art of the Japanese box art of Phantasy Star II\\", and Action Button artist Brent Porter replied in under an hour with an entry Rogers called \\"incredible\\". In mid 2011, Rogers decided to work on an iPhone game for a few weeks as a break from a larger project. While Pelloni was against the buttonless iPhone as a platform, Rogers said the team was convinced by his design document. He contacted an Internet acquaintance who had previously mocked up a design idea from Rogers's Kotaku column, programmer Michael Kerwin, who came through in a week with a version without graphics or sound, which was later added. Rogers recorded \\"some insane and rough music\\" with his band, Large Prime Numbers, that Andrew Toups converted into an 8-bit soundtrack in the \\"original Nintendo sound format\\" that Rogers found \\"breathtaking\\". His friend, QWOP creator Bennett Foddy, deemed the game \\"sort of interesting\\". Six months passed as Rogers worked on a social game before he chose to make a few more changes: more enemy types and progression, graphics in the background, and so emailed people to continue development. Rogers described his own critical list of video games as having minimalist aesthetics with no overt story to tell other than through its game mechanics, and wanted the game to live up to those expectations. He fine-tuned the game with gut-driven decisions. For example, he applied a concept he called \\"sticky friction\\" from Super Mario Bros. 3 to the game's controls. One of the final features was the \\"scream sound effect\\" Rogers made with his guitar and \\"crushed\\" for a distorted and quasi-digital sound that he compared to those made by eccentric Japanese musicians whose records he owned. Rogers explained that they did not add a pause option because he did not want non-game icons in the screen and because (like in Contra) players would die too soon after resuming. He saw the game as simultaneously a \\"snow globe of an electric toy\\" and a \\"gosh darn airtight hardcore video game\\" homage to the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis, and called Ziggurat a descendant of his hobbies: Ibara: Black Label and the Rubik's Cube. Rogers added that the game contained nine hours of scripted events and that the Archenemy alien \\"is only the beginning\\". Rogers produced a trailer for the game. It was released for iOS platforms on February 17, 2012. Two months later, Freshuu, then the game's publisher, signed Ziggurat as the first client for Gimme, an in-game achievement to \\"real-life rewards\\" incentive program. The game received two spikes in sales following positive reviews from journalists, and from a mock infomercial's release on YouTube, all postrelease and not at the time of launch. Brandon Sheffield, writing for Game Developer, thought that Rogers handled the postrelease well since leaking details to the press before the game was available may have impacted sales. Action Button later became the game's publisher.  Reception  The game received \\"generally favorable\\" reviews, according to video game review score aggregator Metacritic. It won a Destructoid Editors' Choice Award, and Time magazine picked the game as one of the best for the then new high-resolution third generation iPad. Edge compared the game to a more pleasurable version of Halo: Reach final scene. The magazine also compared the feeling of prioritization as a swarm of enemies appear to the feeling of clutter when stacking Tetris blocks haphazardly. Edge also called the red screen and sound effect that flashes upon the player's death \\"brash and lo-fi and unexpectedly poignant\\", for which they noted Rogers's interest in noise rock and credited the effect as \\"a beguiling personal signature\\". Alternatively, Paste Joe Bernardi thought the sound did not accomplish what it intended. Joseph Leray of TouchArcade noticed how the guitar sound in Gears of War was reaffirming but the opposite in Ziggurat. Edge noted that nuances such as gravity's influence on the arc of uncharged shots make Ziggurat more of a basketball or golf-like sport skill than a \\"2D Halo\\". Edge awarded the game a 9 of 10, adding that it \\"prized immediacy\\" in a manner that matched the iOS platform. Eurogamer Martin Robinson said the game made him nostalgic for a score attack game from the early 90s that does not exist, and as such called Ziggurat \\"one of the finer simple score-attack shooters ... on the App Store\\" and an expression of the golden age of the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis. He called the game's mechanics \\"fine-tuned\\" and the gun's abilities collated from the best elements of other video games. Danny Cowan of IndieGames.com likewise found the controls \\"very well suited\\" for touchscreens. He also praised the chained explosions and shot charging as \\"satisfying\\", and compared the game to Missile Command in its allure. Robinson of Eurogamer said the game's deserving peers were Geometry Wars and Robotron for their refined play styles that make players predict what enemies are about to act. TouchArcade Leray praised the game design and never reached a place where his skills plateaued. He advised against using the Slingshot mode controls. Joe Bernardi of Paste put Ziggurat in a lineage of iOS games where the player tries to do a fun thing as much as possible before dying, including Canabalt, Bit Pilot, and Super Crate Box. He connected Ziggurat mechanics to Rogers's longstanding interest in \\"infinite mode\\" without external rewards, and praised the charge time mechanics as \\"excellent\\" and the perfect awkward length to confuse muscle memory. Leray of TouchArcade praised its attention to detail, especially in the character sprites. Paste Bernardi called Action Button's design restraint \\"admirable\\" and lauded the game's balance. He noted its \\"extremely focused shallowness\\" as defining, like a Dorito, and called it \\"one of the best iOS games [he had] ever played\\". Reviewing for ActionButton.net, indie developer Adam Saltsman called Ziggurat \\"French New Wave action videogame fan art\\".

The author of eight biographies, two edited collections, and co-editor of a textbook, Ware is a specialist on twentieth century women's political and cultural history, and the history of popular feminism.  Life  Ware graduated from Wellesley College in 1972. She matriculated in the graduate program in history at Harvard University in the fall of 1972, completing her A.M in 1973. Ware completed the Ph.D. in 1978, writing a dissertation about feminists in the New Deal under the direction of Barbara Miller Solomon, a pioneering scholar in American women's history. A second mentor was political historian Frank Freidel. Ware began her career in teaching as a lecturer at Harvard from 1973-1978, and in the years her following completion of the Ph.D., taught at Tufts University, the University of New Hampshire, and Harvard. In 1986, she was appointed as an assistant professor of history at New York University. Ware attained the rank of professor with tenure before she left NYU in 1995 to pursue a full-time career in writing, editing and speaking. Since 1995 she has taught at Harvard and at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In 2014, upon the retirement of historian Nancy Cott, Ware was appointed as Senior Advisor to the Schlesinger Library at the Radcliffe Institute, Harvard University. Ware held this post until Jane Kamensky was appointed Carl and Lily Pforzheimer Foundation Director in May 2015. In her early work as a political historian, Ware established herself as an authority on women in the federal government during the New Deal. Her revised dissertation, Beyond Suffrage: Women and the New Deal (Harvard University Press, 1981) was the first historical monograph to show the pivotal role played by feminist progressive reformers like Frances Perkins and Molly Dewson in implementing social welfare at the federal level. As Nancy F. Cott wrote in a review of Ware's book, perhaps its most vital contribution to the field of women's history was its emphasis on \\"historical generation\\" and its recognition that political women \\"relied on each other for mutual support, advice and patronage\\"‚Äîmuch as political men did. Ware's research on women has been influential across fields. Political scientist Jo Freeman rated Ware's follow-up volume, Partner and I: Molly Dewson, Feminism, and New Deal Politics, as \\"excellent\\". Ware showed how Dewson not only brought hundreds of women into the federal government, but also revolutionized presidential campaign practices to such an extent that presidential advisor James Farley referred to her as \\"the General\\". Since becoming an independent scholar, Ware has published and edited numerous books. In 2001, she became the general editor of Notable American Women, a multi-volume reference work that documents the history of women in the United States, Under Ware's direction, Harvard University Press published Volume 5 of this crucial biographical resource in 2004. Since 2012, Ware has been the general editor of American National Biography Online, published by Oxford University Press. Ware serves as Chair of the Associate Board of Clio Visualizing History, a nonprofit group dedicated to creating innovative online history exhibits designed to attract students and educators and appeal to a wide public audience. She was part of the collaborative team that created and she wrote the text for Click! The Ongoing Feminist Revolution and a companion exhibit to her book Why They Marched: Untold Stories of the Women Who Fought for the Right to Vote (Harvard 2019) was published as Visualizing Votes for Women: Nineteen Objects from the 19th Amendment Campaign.

That is, their legs are covered with feathers down to the feet. Most other accipitrids have bare lower legs, scaled rather than feathered. They may be treated as an informal group, as distinct from \\"fish eagles\\" (or \\"sea eagles\\"), \\"snake eagles\\", and \\"giant forest eagles\\". They may also be treated as a formal taxon, either as a tribe (Aquililae) or subfamily (Aquilinae). The booted eagles, sea eagles, harpy eagles and buteonine hawks are heavily built birds that have traditionally been classified together in the large subfamily Buteoninae. In 2005, Heather Lerner and David Mindell proposed separating the eagles into their own subfamilies Aquilinae, Haliaeetinae, and Harpiinae, leaving only the buteo‚Äìbuteogallus clade in a more restricted Buteoninae. Included in the booted eagles are the genera Aquila, Hieraaetus and Clanga; all species described as \\"hawk eagles\\" including the genera Spizaetus and Nisaetus; as well as assorted monotypical genera such as Oroaetus, Lophaetus, Stephanoaetus, Polemaetus, Lophotriorchis and Ictinaetus.  Hawk eagles   Aquila eagles  The genus Aquila is distributed across every continent but for South America and Antarctica. Up to 20 species have been classified in the genus but the taxonomic placement of some of the traditionally included species has recently been questioned. Traditionally, the Aquila eagles have been grouped superficially as largish, mainly brownish or dark-colored booted eagles that vary little in transition from their juvenile to their adult plumages. Genetic research has recently indicated a clade containing the near- circumpolar golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), Verreaux's eagle (A. verreauxii) of Africa, Asian Gurney's eagle (A. gurneyi) and the Australian wedge-tailed eagle (A. audax). This identification of this particular clade has long been suspected based on similar morphological characteristics amongst these large- bodied species. More surprisingly, the smaller, much paler-bellied species pair Bonelli's eagle (A. fasciatus) and African hawk-eagle (A. spilogaster), previously included in the genus Hieraaetus, have been revealed to be genetically much closer to the Verreaux's and golden eagle lineage than to other species traditionally included in the genus Aquila. Other largish Aquila species, the eastern imperial eagle (A. heliaca), the Spanish imperial eagle (A. adaberti), the tawny eagle (A. rapax) and the steppe eagles (A. nipalensis), are now thought to be separate, close-knit clade, which attained some similar characteristics to the golden eagle clade via convergent evolution.  Spotted eagles  Genetically, the \\"spotted eagles\\" (A. pomarina, A. hasata & A. clanga), have been discovered to be more closely related to the long-crested eagle (Lophaetus occipitalis) and the black eagle (Ictinaetus malaiensis), and many generic reassignments have been advocated. Some authorities place the spotted eagles in a separate genus, Clanga.  Hieraaetus  The genus Hieraaetus, including the booted eagle (H. pennatus), little eagle (H. morphnoides) and Ayres's hawk-eagle (H. ayresii), consists of much smaller species, that are in fact the smallest birds called eagles outside of the unrelated Spilornis serpent-eagle genus. This genus has recently been eliminated by some authorities and its members included in Aquila, although not all ornithological unions have followed this suit in this re-classification. The small-bodied Wahlberg's eagle (H. wahlbergi) has been traditionally considered an Aquila species due to its lack of change from juvenile to adult plumage and brownish color, but it is genetically aligned to the Hieraaetus lineage. Cassin's hawk-eagle (H. africanus) is also probably closely related to the Hieraaetus group rather than the Spizaetus/Nisaetus \\"hawk-eagle\\" group (in which it was previously classified) which is not known to have radiated to Africa.

The Conference welcomes women historians from all fields and historical eras, not just the history of women and gender. The Berkshire Conference is best known for its triennial meeting of the Berkshire Conference on the History of Women, or ‚ÄúBig Berks.‚Äù History The Berkshire Conference of Women Historians was founded in 1930 by historians Louise Fargo Brown of Vassar College, Louise Ropes Loomis of Wells College in response to the marginalization women historians faced in the male-dominated historical profession. Because of gender discrimination in the profession at large, there were very few women with PhDs in history and most were concentrated at women's colleges. Women were underrepresented at the meetings of the American Historical Association (AHA), the professional organization for historians in the United States, and felt unwelcome at networking social events such as \\"smokers\\" and informal weekend retreats. In 1929, these three women historians decided after returning from the AHA meeting that women historians needed the supportive atmosphere of their own informal gatherings. These yearly events started as a series of spring weekend retreats, often in the Berkshire Mountains of New England. Initially called the Lakeville History Group, in 1935 the name changed to the BCWH since most of the meetings took place in Stockbridge, Massachusetts. By 1936, these retreats evolved into the organization known today by the nickname \\"Little Berks.\\" In 1973 conference at Douglass College of Rutgers University inaugurated a new era of the organization. As women's history became an established discipline, hundreds, and eventually thousands, of scholars and activists came together to hold a conference on the history of women, now referred to as the Berkshire Conference on the History of Women (aka the \\"Big Berks\\"). After holding two successive conferences in 1973 and 1974, the conference moved to a biennial schedule, and in the 1980s to triennial. Although the Big Berks always drew international participants, and the 1993 conference at Vassar involved particular efforts to bring international participants, the 2014 conference marked the first time it was held outside the United States (it was held in Toronto, Canada). The Berkshire Conference continues to hold yearly retreats that combine conversation, socializing, outdoor activities, mentoring of junior scholars, and administrative business such as the selection of the annual book and article prizes. The Berkshire Conference also advocates for women in academia, funds graduate student fellowships, and plans the triennial Berkshire Conference on the History of Women, aka The \\"Big Berks.\\" Big Berks Locations * 2017 Hofstra University * 2014 University of Toronto * 2011 University of Massachusetts Amherst * 2008 University of Minnesota, Twin Cities * 2005 Scripps College * 2002 University of Connecticut * 1999 University of Rochester * 1996 University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill * 1993 Vassar College * 1990 Douglass College at Rutgers University * 1987 Wellesley College * 1984 Smith College * 1981 Vassar College * 1978 Mt.

The film, which stars Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, and Goofy as car mechanics, was also the final black-and- white appearance of Donald, Goofy, and Pete and the penultimate animated black-and-white film produced by Disney after Mickey's Kangaroo which was released later the same year. It was also the first team-up of the classic trio of Mickey, Donald, and Goofy. Mickey's Service Station was directed by Ben Sharpsteen, who at the time, had directed only Silly Symphony shorts, and starred the voices of Walt Disney, Clarence Nash, Pinto Colvig, and Billy Bletcher. It was the 74th Mickey Mouse short film to be released, and the third of that year. The cartoon has been colorized and is available in color on YouTube and on DVD versions of Disney's House of Mouse. Plot Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and Goofy are working at a car service station, working together to fix a broken car. Soon Peg-Leg Pete comes by, and angrily demands that they fix a squeak (to the tune of \\"Yankee Doodle\\") in his tire. He tells them that if they don't get the job done in ten minutes, they'll have their heads cut off. Scared by the thought, they quickly get to work. Slight gags show them to be inept at car repairing, including scenes where Goofy and Donald pull each other through the car's lights, Mickey getting stuck in a tire several times, and Goofy smashing pieces of the car's engine. Finally Mickey is able to squeeze a tire and pop out what was making the noise: a grasshopper. The trio smash several pieces of the car with hammers before Mickey is able to drive away the grasshopper. They then get to the job of repairing the car, noticing that their ten minutes are almost up. They are better at repairing the car, though Donald gets accidentally injured a few times and Mickey gets himself stuck in the tire again. When they finally finish the job, Mickey gets in the driver's seat and tests the engine, but Goofy accidentally hits a lever making the stand the car is on go up. Goofy saves the car and Mickey from crashing by making the stand's base land in Goofy's shirt. But the weight of the stand causes Goofy to wobble around, causing Goofy to enter an underground station and pick up a bucket of motor oil. As Goofy struggles to shake the bucket off, he lets loose several rivets and finally gets the bucket off by sliding on a skateboard. He swings around on a gas pump and heads toward Donald, who puts down a plank of wood for Goofy to cross the underground station. Goofy bangs into Donald and causes Donald to hit a larger oil can, which splatters oil everywhere.

The two-lane bridge connects Salinas Street in Barangay Palico, the last barangay of Imus before Bacoor, to the poblacion (town center) of Imus. The southern end of the Bridge of Isabel II and the entrance to the former Imus Estate House now Camp Garcia. The southern end of the bridge lands on General E. Topacio St. at the entrance to the former location of the Estate House of the Recollects, which then owned the Imus Estate (Hacienda de Imus), which covers the towns of Imus and Dasmari√±as, and parts of Bacoor and Kawit. The estate house was the last stronghold of the Spaniards during the Battle of Imus in September 1896. The location is now the site of Cuartel or Camp Pantaleon Garcia, the Cavite headquarters of the Philippine National Police. Only the tall stone walls that surrounds the estate house is what remains of the former property. Features The two-lane Bridge of Isabel II was built with stone masonry. The bridge measures about landing-to-landing with a width of about . In the middle of the bridge are sitting areas (where the historical markers are now placed) built during the construction of the bridge.

The Bridge of Isabel II in 1899 with the missing northern span dismantled during the Philippine revolution. =Battle of Imus= On September 3, 1896 during the Battle of Imus, the northern span of the bridge was dismantled by the Filipino revolutionaries as an offense tactic to combat the Spanish soldiers coming in from Manila. With the revolutionaries hidden behind trenches, the marching soldiers would not see the cut until they have traversed part of the span thus entrapping them. The tactic was a success resulting in the victory of the revolutionaries.Tucker, Spencer C. (2009). \\"The Encyclopedia of the Spanish- American and the Philippine-American Wars\\", pg. 303.

It was later rebuilt during the American colonial period. =Recognition= After the completion of the bridge in 1857, a silver medal was awarded by Governor-General Ramon Montero, the successor of Manuel Crespo, to Matias Carbonell, the builder of the bridge. In 1939, a historical marker was installed on the bridge by the Philippines Historical Committee, which is now the National Historical Commission of the Philippines.\\"File:Bridge of Isabel II historical marker.jpg\\".

The network has an assortative nature ‚Äì hubs tend to link to other hubs and low-degree nodes tend to link to low-degree nodes. Assortativity is not structural, meaning that it is not a consequence of the degree distribution, but it is generated by some process that governs the network‚Äôs evolution. Study by Mark Newman A detailed reconstruction of an actual collaboration was made by Mark Newman. He analyzed the collaboration networks through several large databases in the fields of biology and medicine, physics and computer science in a five-year window (1995-1999). The results showed that these networks form small worlds, in which randomly chosen pairs of scientists are typically separated by only a short path of intermediate acquaintances. They also suggest that the networks are highly clustered, i.e. two scientists are much more likely to have collaborated if they have a third common collaborator than are two scientists chosen randomly from the community. Prototype of evolving networks Barabasi et al. studied the collaboration networks in mathematics and neuro-science of an 8-year period (1991-1998) to understand the topological and dynamical laws governing complex networks. They viewed the collaboration network as a prototype of evolving networks, as it expands by the addition of new nodes (authors) and new links (papers co-authored). The results obtained indicated that the network is scale-free and that its evolution is governed by preferential attachment. Moreover, authors concluded that most quantities used to characterize the network are time dependent. For example, the average degree (network's interconnectedness) increases in time. Furthermore, the study showed that the node separation decreases over time, however this trend is believed to be offered by incomplete database and it can be opposite in the full system.

The group convened in 2010 as Rogers worked on Ziggurat based on an idea he had while playing Angry Birds that he could not complete on his own. Porter joined Action Button after responding to a call for artists Rogers made via Twitter, and Kerwin joined based on a connection he had with Rogers from producing a mockup of a game concept Rogers outlined in his Kotaku column.  History  Action Button Entertainment was founded by Tim Rogers. The studio consists of Tim Rogers, Brent Porter, Michael Kerwin, and Nicholas Wasilewski, who have built all of the studio's four games from Ziggurat through Videoball. Their games are consistently \\"simple\\" in their aesthetics and controls. The team formed during the development of Ziggurat, which began with an idea Rogers had while playing Angry Birds about pushing back a swarm of bats by shooting projectiles at them. He decided that he could not make the game alone. Rogers put out a call for artists on Twitter with a submissions request of \\"fan art of the Japanese box art of Phantasy Star II\\", and Action Button artist Brent Porter replied in under an hour with an entry Rogers called \\"incredible\\". In mid 2011, Rogers decided to work on an iPhone game for a few weeks as a break from a larger project. Rogers said the team was convinced by his design document‚Äîthis game would become Ziggurat. Rogers contacted an Internet acquaintance who had previously mocked up a design idea from Rogers's Kotaku column, programmer Michael Kerwin, who came through with a rough draft within a week. Andrew Toups converted a soundtrack created by Rogers's rock band into an 8-bit soundtrack. After six months of hiatus and working at a social games company, Rogers rekindled development and the team finished the Ziggurat, which was released in February 2012. Rogers has said that he aspires for Action Button Entertainment to make games that share his preferred gaming styles and his hobbies. Realizing that the common link between his top 25 video games (including Panzer Dragoon, Cave Story, Canabalt, and his favorite, Out of This World) was minimalist aesthetics with no overt story to tell other than through game mechanics, Rogers wanted Ziggurat and future games to live up to those expectations and used his gut to fine-tune design decisions. The games also reflect aspects of Rogers's personality, such as in the \\"scream sound effect\\" on Ziggurat made and distorted from his guitar based on sounds made by eccentric Japanese musicians whose records he owned. He also called Ziggurat a descendant of his hobbies: Ibara: Black Label and the Rubik's Cube.  Games  = Ziggurat = Ziggurat, stylized as ZiGGURAT, is a retro-style arcade shooter video game developed by Action Button Entertainment for iOS platforms. As the world's last human fighting off incoming aliens from atop a ziggurat, the player uses simple touch controls to charge and shoot the enemies away, and dies if hit by an enemy. The game has 16-bit graphics style and an 8-bit chiptune soundtrack. Action Button designer Tim Rogers developed the game idea based on his experience with Angry Birds, which later led to the formation of Action Button as a company with Ziggurat as its first release on February 17, 2012. The game received \\"generally favorable\\" reviews, according to video game review score aggregator Metacritic. Reviewers praised Ziggurat controls and minimalism. It won a Destructoid Editors' Choice Award, and Time magazine picked the game as one of the best for the then new high-resolution third generation iPad. = TNNS = TNNS, pronounced \\"tennis\\", is a brick-breaking action game released in November 2012 for iOS. As a universal app, it is playable on iPhones, iPads, and iPods. It was developed by Action Button Entertainment and produced by Rabbx. Players use a paddle along the screen's left side to bounce a ball towards breakable objects on the right side of the screen, and to avoid getting the ball in their goal. A star box ends the level. The game's over 500 stages are built as puzzles and played at random. Level features include wormholes that move the ball from one part of the screen to another and arrows that change the ball's trajectory. Power-ups include \\"multi-ball\\", which puts multiple balls into play. TNNS also includes objectives, a same-device two-player mode, objectives, in-app purchases, and Facebook and Twitter integration. Action Button later released an Android version. The game Action Button described as \\"about keeping your eyes on balls\\" was inspired by tennis. It was released with little advanced notice in early November 2012. Danny Cowan of IndieGames.com compared it with Sidhe Interactive's Shatter and VG247 called it a rendition of Breakout. Pocket Gamer Mark Brown likened it to both and further compared it with Alleyway, Arkanoid, and Super Hexagon with a \\"telekinetic power\\" to alter the ball's direction apart from the panel (as in Shatter). He found the game frustrating at times when unable to control the ball. Though Brown found TNNS fun, different, and addictive, it had \\"not quite won [him] over\\". = Ten by Eight = Ten by Eight, stylized as 10√ó8, is a puzzle video game by Action Button Entertainment where players match tiles. It was released on July 31, 2013 in North America for PlayStation Mobile‚Äîthe PlayStation Vita and compatible devices. International editions followed. Players align similarly colored blocks and trace the path they create when aligned. The goal is to make the longest path possible, and bonus points are awarded for paths that connect the screen's edges. Star blocks act as power-ups that extend combos, such that a chain of green tiles can link to a chain of red tiles using a star block. Points can be spent on new character unlocks, including some from Ziggurat, that have no gameplay function. Ten by Eight has three modes of play. In endless mode, rocks around the grid block possible paths and can only be cleared by making paths that envelop the rocks. The game ends if a rock fully crosses the grid. The zen mode has no rocks or time limit. The timed mode sets a several-minute restriction on gameplay and has no rocks. Rogers produced an \\"infomercial-style trailer\\" for the game, which VG247 called one of his signature moves and that IndieGames.com called \\"glorious\\". Paste Garrett Martin rated the game 8.0 of 10. Though he acknowledged untimed \\"endless\\" modes as usually the best puzzle game mode, he found Ten by Eight endless and zen modes \\"problematic\\", citing the difficulty and frustration in removing the endless mode's rocks and the dearth of urgency in the zen mode. Martin found the timed mode's length to be \\"perfect\\", but suggested that the Vita's screen was less so, recommending a tablet release. He compared the minimalist soundtrack to Kraftwerk, and noted that players uninterested in high scores would not stay interested for long. = Videoball = Videoball is a minimalist sports video game by Action Button Entertainment. Using solely one analog stick and one button, players control triangles that shoot projectiles to knock a circular ball into the opposing team's endzone. Holding the button creates a projectile (a \\"unit\\") that fires upon release. The projectile can propel the ball, nullify other projectiles, or incapacitate opponents. The projectile charges the longer the button is held, such that a charged \\"slam\\" shot can sail across the full screen. Games last an average of four minutes. Videoball designer Tim Rogers describes the game as \\"an abstract minimalist electronic sport\\". Its development began as a dare from QWOP developer Bennett Foddy, Rogers's friend, to make a \\"one-button StarCraft\\". Rogers compared the game's design process to Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares, where Ramsay convinces failing restaurants to provide fewer menu options and to make those dishes well. Polygon Tracey Lien discussed their process as \\"chasing a certain purity\\" and mentioned the strong role of strategy in playing the game. Rogers noted basketball-like strategy in prototype games, with players positioned as center or forward positions or playing zone defense. He livestreams prerelease sessions of Videoball via Twitch. The game is expected for release in 2014 with cross-platform multiplayer and support for more than six simultaneous players. Reviewers all cited Videoball minimalism both in aesthetics and gameplay, and compared the game with the skill and strategy of football and basketball. Before its release, PC Gamer Wes Fenlon wrote that he thought about Videoball daily after last playing two weeks prior due to its \\"addictive sort of fun\\" and his excitement for local multiplayer on PC following Hokra and TowerFall. He felt that the game's tagline of being appropriate for both a child's birthday party and prison was correct albeit silly. Fenlon praised the game's minimalist visuals, \\"peppy music, and chirpy sound effects\\". He compared the player's controls to that of Asteroids and contrasted its simplicity with the 100-hour onboarding process for League of Legends, having learned Videoball after \\"a couple minutes\\". Polygon Tracey Lien compared the game's feel to basketball, football, and hockey. Citing the strong role of strategy in playing the game, she compared the array of projectiles fired to military strategy or a football play. = Tuffy the Corgi = Tuffy the Corgi and the Tower of Bones is a 2D platform adventure game for PlayStation Mobile where the player attempts to collect all 108 bones about a single, long level. As the player-character Tuffy is constantly running, the player can only jump and change direction by pressing any button on either side of the screen. When the player touches a spike or enemy, they must restart the game from the beginning. It features a counter that shows how many times the player has died. Rogers produced a video trailer for the game. The game was designed by Rogers, programmed by Kerwin, and illustrated by Porter. Ken \\"Coda\\" Snyder made the music. It was released in June 2014. Game Informer Jeff Marchiafava wrote that the platformer was \\"hopelessly difficult\\", as it required a \\"level of perfectionism only speedrunners possess\\". He added that Tuffy was both what he \\"loved and hated\\" about the video games of his youth, between its 16-bit era art, tight platforming controls, \\"unforgiving\\" gameplay, and \\"reliance on rote memorization\\" of path through the level. Marchiafava added that gameplay trends had forgotten these types of games for a reason, and concluded that he \\"never warmed to Tuffy\\" despite his interest in \\"punishing retro platformers like Spelunky and Super Meat Boy\\".

Woldemar Friedrich von Olivier (23 April 1791 in Dessau - 5 September 1859 in Dessau) was a German history painter in the Romantic style, often associated with the Nazarene movement.  Life  His father was head of the Dessau P√§dagogium and his mother was an opera singer. The painters Ferdinand Olivier and were his brothers. All three received their first art lessons from and Christian Haldenwang. Friedrich also received instruction from the Court Sculptor Friedemann Hunold (1773‚Äì1840). After his brothers returned from Paris, they accompanied him on a trip through the Harz mountains, then on to Vienna in 1811, where he attended the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna. Shortly after the Freiheitskriege (Wars of Liberation) began, he joined Theodor K√∂rner and some of his associates, walking from Vienna to Breslau where they joined the L√ºtzow Free Corps. Following campaigns in the Netherlands and France, he was apparently awarded the Order of Saint Anna, third class, but it remains unclear when (or even if) he was granted a title of nobility.Epoche Napoleon: Biography (Note: the portrait is probably Theodor K√∂rner, drawn by Olivier...not Olivier himself) He returned to Vienna in 1814 and travelled throughout Austria. Four years later he, Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld and other friends took a trip to Italy. In Florence, they made the acquaintance of Baron Carl Friedrich von Rumohr, a notable patron of the arts. In 1823, he returned to Vienna and, two years later, married his brother Ferdinand's step-daughter. At that time, his painting style underwent a major transformation, prefiguring the style of Hans von Mar√©es. He also spent some time in Munich, assisting Carolsfeld with a large fresco project depicting scenes from the Nibelungenlied at one of King Ludwig's royal residences. After his brother Heinrich's death in 1848, he left his wife and seven children to return to Dessau and take care of his sister. He lived there the rest of his life and created no further works. Several of his better-known works were lost when a fire destroyed the Glaspalast in Munich on 6 June 1931.

Description delta flower scarab. Palafoxia integrifolia is a herbaceous annual plant with pinkish-white disc flowers arranged in inflorescences. It has glossy, alternating leaves which elongate on the lower portion of the stems and more linear at the top. The stems of P. integrifolia are less woody than other species of palafox, making it prone to drooping. Taxonomy and etymology P. integrifolia was described in 1842 by Thomas Nuttall. The generic name refers to Jos√© de Palafox y Melci, while the species name is derived from the Latin word integrifolius, meaning \\"having entire leaves\\". Polypteris integrifolia is a valid synonym. Distribution and habitat P. integrifolia is found in the states of Georgia and Florida, where it grows in sandy uplands. Ecology Like other Palafoxia species, P. integrifolia is attractive to birds and insects, which aid in pollination.

Originating from an area of disturbed weather near the Caroline Islands on November 9, Forrest was classified as a tropical depression three days later over the South China Sea. Tracking generally west, the system steadily organized into a tropical storm, passing Vietnam to the south, before striking Thailand along the Malay Peninsula on November 15\\\\. Once over the Bay of Bengal, Forrest turned northward on November 17 and significantly intensified. It reached its peak intensity on November 20 as a Category 4-equivalent cyclone on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane scale with winds of 230 km/h (145 mph). Hostile environmental conditions soon affected the cyclone as it turned abruptly east-northeastward. Forrest made landfall in northwestern Myanmar as a weakening system on November 21 before dissipating early the next day. The majority of deaths associated with Forrest resulted from a plane crash on November 14 in Vietnam which killed 30 of the 31 occupants. In Thailand, the system produced significant storm surge, damaged or destroyed 1,700 homes, and killed two people. Agricultural losses in the hardest hit areas were estimated at ‡∏ø800 million (US$32 million). On November 20, as Forrest reached its peak intensity, fears arose across Bangladesh that a repeat of the catastrophic April 1991 cyclone would take place. As a result, mass evacuation plans were enacted across coastal areas of the country, with plans to relocate up to 2 million people. But the storm abruptly turned eastward, and the successful evacuation of 600,000 residents spared countless lives. Only two deaths were recorded and overall damage was light, though half of all homes on St. Martin's Island were damaged. Meteorological history The second of four notable tropical cyclones in the Western Pacific in early November 1992, Forrest was first identified as an area of disturbed weather over the western Caroline Islands on November 9. Moving generally west- northwest, convection associated with the system steadily organized and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) subsequently issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) on November 10\\\\. Development into a tropical depression was not anticipated until the system cleared the Philippines; however, organization was slower than forecast and a second TCFA was issued late on November 11\\\\. Once west of Palawan Island and over the South China Sea on November 12, the convective structure rapidly consolidated. The disturbance was designated Tropical Depression 30W at 12:00 UTC, when it was 940 km (585 mi) east-southeast of Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) followed suit six hours later. Moving toward the west-southwest, the system steadily organized; later that day, it attained gale-force winds and was assigned the name Forrest by the JTWC. As the storm approached Vietnam, it turned southwest and moved parallel to the coast before resuming its westerly track. Forrest made its closest approach to the nation on November 14, passing 110 km (70 mi) south of C√† Mau Province. The storm's proximity to land inhibited intensification, and it attained winds of 100 km/h (65 mph) as it moved over the Gulf of Thailand on November 14\\\\. The next day, the storm made landfall in the Nakhon Si Thammarat Province of Thailand. While crossing the Malay Peninsula, Forrest lost most of its convection, though its circulation remained well-defined. Failing to reorganize, the system continued to weaken as it moved across the Andaman Sea. At 06:00 UTC on November 16, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) began tracking the system as Depression BOB 08, although the agency quickly upgraded it to a deep depression and later a cyclonic storm. Two days later, a subtropical ridge over Southeast Asia nudged Forrest toward the north, and it regained organized convection. Early on November 18, the storm attained hurricane-force winds as favorable outflow and upper-level winds aided intensification. Strengthening continued through early on November 20, at which time Forrest reached its peak intensity with winds of 230 km/h (145 mph), a Category 4-equivalent cyclone on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane scale. The IMD assessed three-minute sustained winds to have been 185 km/h (115 mph), making it a modern-day \\"extremely severe cyclonic storm\\", and its barometric pressure was estimated at 952 mbar (hPa; 28.11 inHg). Forrest maintained its peak intensity for six hours before increasing wind shear disrupted it. Unexpectedly, the storm turned sharply northeast later on November 20, sparing most of Bangladesh from a direct hit. More dramatic weakening ensued on November 21 as Forrest neared landfall, with its eye becoming obscure. The cyclone made landfall along the northern coast of Rakhine State in Myanmar between 06:00 and 12:00 UTC with winds of 155‚Äì175 km/h (100‚Äì110 mph). The IMD estimated Forrest to have been far weaker as it moved ashore, reporting peak three-minute winds to be 85 km/h (50 mph) at that time. Once onshore, the high terrain of northern Myanmar further eroded the cyclone's circulation. Forrest dissipated early on November 22 over the Magway Region. Throughout the storm's existence in the Bay of Bengal, it was monitored by the ERS-1 satellite. It became the first North Indian Ocean cyclone to be observed by scatterometer instruments, providing the data necessary to calibrate the device for minimizing directional ambiguity of its measurements. Preparations and impact On November 14, Vietnam Airlines Flight 474 leaving Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, heading to Nha Trang, crashed after encountering rough conditions produced by Tropical Storm Forrest. After descending below a safe altitude on approach to Nha Trang, the Yakovlev Yak-40 aircraft deviated from the runway and impacted trees at the top of a ridge before crashing away. Of the 6 crew and 25 passengers (31 occupants), 30 were killed in the accident. The only survivor was Annette Herfkens. Nine of the passengers were foreigners: four from Taiwan, two from the Netherlands, and one each from France, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Search and rescue efforts were conducted with two helicopters, two planes fitted with cameras, and two warships over nearby waters. It took rescuers eight days to find the wreckage of the plane. Across the Gulf of Thailand, all oil platforms were evacuated and no injuries were reported during the storm's passage. Damage, if any, that took place in Myanmar is unknown. =Thailand= Tropical Storm Forrest making landfall on Thailand on November 15 Prior to the storm's arrival in Thailand, officials initially evacuated 3,000 people from coastal areas. Evacuations were soon increased to 20,000 following the risk of greater damage. Tropical Storm Forrest struck the Nakhon Si Thammarat Province of Thailand on November 15 and was regarded as the worst in the region since Tropical Storm Harriet in 1962. Winds estimated up to and torrential rains battered areas along the Malay Peninsula. Widespread blackouts were reported throughout the affected areas. Across Nakhon Si Thammarat Province, two people were killed and 1,700 homes were damaged. The hardest hit area was Tha Sala District where 1,000 homes were damaged or destroyed. In the Pak Phanang District, storm surge destroyed at least 100 homes and damaged 400 more. At least of rubber plantations and of shrimp farms were damaged as well. Between the two districts, damage amounted to ‡∏ø800 million (US$32 million). Offshore, waves were estimated to have reached in height. Minister of the Interior Chavalit Yongchaiyudh traveled to the affected areas on November 16 to oversee relief operations. =Bangladesh= On April 29 of the previous year, a catastrophic Category 5-equivalent cyclone had struck Bangladesh killing an estimated 140,000 people. On November 20, 1992, the entire coast of Bangladesh was placed on red alert, the highest level of cyclone warning, and deputy director of the Bangladesh Red Crescent Society, Harun-ur Rashid, advised thorough and efficient evacuations. Amid forecasts that Forrest's intensity at landfall would be greater than that of the April 1991 cyclone, officials and volunteers scrambled to warn residents in its path of the impending danger. An estimated 21,000 volunteers traveled to outlying islands and rural areas to urge residents to move to the mainland for safety. Following the 1991 cyclone, the Red Cross planned to construct 3,000 shelters across the coastline; however, by this time, only 44 had been completed. Of greatest concern was the lack of shelters on Maheshakhali, where 30,000 were killed in the earlier cyclone. Additionally, 21 makeshift camps housing 265,000 Muslim refugees from Myanmar were in the forecast path. An emergency meeting was called by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to discussion the Muslim refugee situation. The scramble to protect residents was noted by one foreign relief official as an attempt to \\"[not get] caught with our pants down like last year.\\" Plans were made to evacuate 2 million people along the immediate coastline, including 300,000 in the Cox's Bazar District alone. Harun-ur Rashid stated: \\"if necessary the volunteers have orders to use force to evacuate people.\\" Residents were readily willing to leave their homes in the District, in stark contrast to the complacency seen prior to the 1991 cyclone. Some people, traumatized by the events of the earlier storm, left at the \\"slightest hint of calamity\\". By late on November 20, approximately 500,000 people had been evacuated. Following a change in the cyclone's course, the focus of evacuations shifted closer to the Bangladesh‚ÄìMyanmar border. Relocations in this new area included: 200,000 in Chittagong, 55,000 in Chokoria, 51,000 in Moheshkhali, and 40,000 on Kutubdia Upazila. An emergency Cabinet meeting was convened by Prime Minister Khaleda Zia to discuss the storm. Government officials were similarly placed on emergency alert despite the day being a weekly holiday. Bangladesh Television cancelled all entertainment programs and relayed announcements on the cyclone non-stop. Relief Minister Lutfar Rahman Khan also convened an unscheduled, high-level meeting concerning the allocation of relief goods for eight districts. Overall, 600,000 people evacuated inland or to one of 238 shelters. During the evacuations, one person was killed in a stampede at a crowded shelter. The cyclone ultimately spared the country a direct hit, turning due east, weakening, and striking Myanmar on November 21. Meteorologists regarded the storm's change of course and weakening as a \\"miracle,\\" as large cyclones have historically caused tremendous loss of life and damage in Bangladesh. Off St. Martin's Island, the southernmost area in Bangladesh inhabited by 4,500 fishermen, high winds snapped radio lines to the mainland. High tides flooded the island, damaging half of its dwellings. Fifty people sustained minor injuries, and one was killed after being struck by lightning. On nearby Shah Farid Island, 200 thatched homes were damaged; all 500 families had previously evacuated and were left unharmed. Squalls affected Teknaf Upazila, damaging a food storeroom and office at one of the Muslim refugee camps. Gusts in Cox's Bazar peaked at as the storm passed 140 km (85 mi) south.

It is the first part of the Tyranny of Dragons storyline and followed by a second adventure, The Rise of Tiamat. Plot summary Hoard of the Dragon Queen and a second adventure, The Rise of Tiamat, pits players against Tiamat. Publication history Hoard of the Dragon Queen was released on August 14, 2014 as part of the fantasy storyline called \\"Tyranny of Dragons\\", which launched alongside the new edition and is told through game supplements, video games, and other outlets. The adventure was created by Kobold Press under commission from Wizards of the Coast. During San Diego Comic-Con 2019, Wizards of the Coast announced on their Twitch stream that a new edition of Tyranny of Dragons will be released on October 22, 2019. This new edition will repackage Hoard of the Dragon Queen and The Rise of Tiamat together and it will include a full errata, a reworked opening chapter, and new cover art from artist Hydro74. It will only be available from local game and hobby stores. James Whitbrook, for Io9, reports that \\"the re-release incorporates player feedback from the first two releases to smooth out the progressive curve of the quests presented in Hoard of the Dragon Queen and The Rise of Tiamat, which will encompass all the tweaks and addendums made to how D&D; fifth edition plays in the five years gamers have had their hands on it. As an included bonus, the book will also include extra resources for players and dungeon masters that were only previously available online, as well as a treasure trove of behind-the-scenes concept art made for the adventure that rivals even Tiamat‚Äôs most desirable loot\\". Reception Jonathan Bolding, for Escapist, wrote that \\"structurally, it's a solid premise and interesting, but in play and as written the middle sections really tend to lag and create dragging, boring play where dungeon masters have to narrate hours of travel and punctuate when something 'interesting' happens. Even if your group are the types to go out of their way to familiarize themselves with the plethora of interesting NPCs that the adventure includes as part of their caravan north, only a bare handful of those NPCs actually matter outside their adventure segment\\". AV Club's Samantha Nelson wrote that \\"the game does a great job at creating urgency. You can rest and heal, but doing so comes at the cost of one of the possible quests and the experience points you would gain for completing it. But players who want to do everything are setting themselves up for failure. One quest actually leads you into an ambush by cultists looking to stop your party‚Äôs meddling. If you don‚Äôt see it coming, you‚Äôre in for a really hard fight. The adventure also makes the bold decision of starting your heroes off as losers\\". Bleeding Cool's Gavin Sheehan wrote that \\"the rewards are minimal, especially in the experience department for the first few episodes. It‚Äôs enough to get by but not enough to make the characters super powerful moving forward. Normally I would say this is a nice balance of power and experience, but doing the math on a fresh character sheet, it feels like you‚Äôre always on the cusp of being great when you truly need to be great. [...] The story itself truly picks up when you hit Castle Naerytar, which is much further down the road after you‚Äôve figured out who you are and what works best for your character, and hopefully have reached Level 5 in grand fashion\\".

Plot summary The Rise of Tiamat, along with the previous adventure, Hoard of the Dragon Queen, pits players against Tiamat. Publication history The Rise of Tiamat was released on October 21, 2014 as the second adventure (after Hoard of the Dragon Queen) released as part of the fantasy storyline called \\"Tyranny of Dragons\\", which launched alongside the new edition and is told through game supplements, video games, and other outlets. The adventure was created by Kobold Press under commission from Wizards of the Coast. During San Diego Comic-Con 2019, Wizards of the Coast announced on their Twitch stream that a new edition of Tyranny of Dragons will be released on October 22, 2019. This new edition will repackage Hoard of the Dragon Queen and The Rise of Tiamat together and it will include a full errata, a reworked opening chapter, and new cover art from artist Hydro74. It will only be available from local game and hobby stores. James Whitbrook, for Io9, reports that \\"the re-release incorporates player feedback from the first two releases to smooth out the progressive curve of the quests presented in Hoard of the Dragon Queen and The Rise of Tiamat, which will encompass all the tweaks and addendums made to how D&D; fifth edition plays in the five years gamers have had their hands on it. As an included bonus, the book will also include extra resources for players and dungeon masters that were only previously available online, as well as a treasure trove of behind- the-scenes concept art made for the adventure that rivals even Tiamat‚Äôs most desirable loot\\". Reception Scott Wachter of RPGamer wrote that the adventure \\"on the page is shallow, generic, excessively linear and overall uninspired. The attempt to revive the classic-feel of D&D;, complete with multi-part adventures is noble, but maybe they should have tried to emulate one of the good ones.\\" DieHard GameFan said that \\"once you get past the obvious layout and editing issues, you're getting an exceptional amount of content and value for a relatively small price tag. The Rise of Tiamat is certainly a fine way to end The Tyranny of Dragons and it will keep you occupied for several months to come.\\" Rise of Tiamat received the gold ENnie Award for Best Cover Art.

It occurred during, but was not a part of, the Yakima War. Though a minor incident, it is historically notable for the first U.S. Navy battle death in the Pacific Ocean. Background The Haida of British Columbia and Alaska and others had, since time immemorial, periodically conducted raiding expeditions against the Coast Salish peoples of the Puget Sound, who were used as a source for slave labor. Northwest Coast Native maritime technology was unsurpassed among First Nations peoples and raiding parties would travel in large dugout canoes at distances of up to a thousand miles. The largest of these canoes could hold 100 warriors and their equipment. These raids continued even after the demarcation of the border between the United States and Canada, then controlled by the United Kingdom. Conflict In November 1856 a Tlingit party, consisting of approximately 100 warriors and their accompanying families, entered Puget Sound in a fleet of canoes, in what was then the Washington Territory. When the force approached the town of Steilacoom, residents alerted the U.S. Army garrison at Fort Steilacoom who, in turn, sent word to the nearby U.S. Navy gunboat . However, before USS Massachusetts could arrive the Haida had already withdrawn north. Port Gamble is located on Puget Sound at the entrance to Port Gamble Bay. On November 20 the Tlingit approached the logging community of Port Gamble, near which was located the Port Gamble Band of S‚ÄôKlallam Indians some of the members of which worked at the nearby sawmill. Josiah Keller, superintendent of the mill, sounded the mill's whistle prompting the community to evacuate to a blockhouse that had been previously constructed for this eventuality. USS Massachusetts arrived at Port Gamble soon thereafter and, finding that the Haida party had landed and camped at the edge of town, placed a force of 18 armed sailors ashore. The skipper of USS Massachusetts, Commander Samuel Swartwout, twice sent messengers to the Tlingit chiefs with offers to tow them to Victoria, but each offer was rebuffed. The next morning, Swartwout began shelling the Haida camp with the deck guns of the Massachusetts, inflicting heavy casualties on the party before they managed to retreat to the forest. During the Haida withdrawal, small arms fire was exchanged between the war party and USS Massachusetts' sailors, resulting in the death of coxswain Gustavus Engelbrecht, the only American casualty in the battle and the first U.S. Navy battle death in the Pacific. The Haida having abandoned the field, the landing party from USS Massachusetts proceeded to destroy the beached Haida canoes and burn their provisions. Two days later the surviving Haida surrendered. The Tlingit prisoners were issued a ration of bread and molasses and given 24 hours to bury their dead, after which they were taken aboard USS Massachusetts with the intention of deporting them to British Columbia. When USS Massachusetts arrived in Victoria, however, British Columbia governor James Douglas objected to the landing of the Haida in the colony. In a dispatch sent to colonial secretary Henry Labouch√®re, Douglas described Swartwout's reaction, Swartwout and Douglas eventually reached a compromise: the Tlingit were provisioned with food and new canoes, then dropped-off at the edge of Russian America. Aftermath One of the Tlingit killed in the Battle of Port Gamble was a chief and, under Tlingit custom, a chief of the enemy had to be killed in revenge. On August 11, 1857, the Tlingit returned to Washington Territory, landing at Whidbey Island. After inquiring among settlers if there were any chiefs around, they determined that Isaac N. Ebey was the most important person on the island and shot and decapitated him, before departing for home with Ebey's head as a trophy. [A likeness of Ebey was carved on the front of a war helmet by a Kake Tlingit artist with Ebey's head as his model.]{Duane Pasco} With increased policing of the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border, Northern incursions into Washington steadily dropped in the years following the Battle of Port Gamble. Later incidents involving the Haida and United States tribes occurred in 1859 when Suquamish warriors repelled a Haida landing on the western shore of Bainbridge Island; a confrontation between the Snohomish and Tlingit in August 1860.

Levenson. Shane McRae stars as Josh Shiffman, who learns that his father is dying and his only regret is that he will not get to meet the woman who will one day become his son's wife. Desperate to fulfill his dad's final wish, Josh claims that he already met that woman, Molly Mahoney, who is played by Aubrey Dollar.  Plot  Molly Mahoney is going home for her mother's wedding, and is bringing her boyfriend Lance to meet her family. Knowing they will be skeptical of him if she tells them he's in a band, she doesn't tell them anything about him, including his name. En route to the airport she discovers he's married and breaks up with him. At the airport, Molly meets up with Josh Shiffman, her brother's playboy best friend from childhood, as he is also flying from LA to Chicago for the wedding. While waiting at the airport with Molly, Josh receives a call from his parents and learns that his dad, Max, is expected to die of cancer in the next 6 months. His father says that his only regret is not seeing the woman his son would marry. Josh, in a moment of panic, says that it is Molly. She agrees to play along for the weekend. At Molly's mother's wedding, Josh reconnects with a former flame, Giselle Brousard. After telling her the truth about the fake engagement, they begin a friends with benefits relationship. While Molly says the relationship isn't a problem, she eventually begins to feel jealous of Giselle. Josh's parents ask Josh and Molly to stay longer to help with Josh's family's framing shop, as Max's health is failing. They agree, and the family starts to plan the wedding. Josh continues to see Giselle, and Molly tries to date other men. One night, Josh is with his dad who asks him if he's happy with Molly, stating that being truly in love means you can be yourself with the other person. Josh replies that he is more comfortable with Molly than anyone else he knows. The same night, Molly attends her surprise bachelorette party where Molly describes Josh as one she could spend the rest of her life with. Josh overhears this and walks away in confusion before he is discovered. That night, they have sex. The next day, as they jokingly register for their wedding, Josh and Molly run into Giselle. Josh and Giselle flirt and Molly is upset. Later, in front of their parents, Molly ends the engagement, saying she can't do this anymore. Josh chases after her and she admits that she loves him, returns his grandmother's ring, and leaves. Josh ends the \\"benefits\\" part of his relationship with Giselle and confesses he may love Molly. Meanwhile, Josh's father has what the family thinks is a heart attack. Josh and Giselle rush to the hospital where Molly and the family are waiting. Josh's mother angrily reveals she knew he was having an affair and is horrified that he would bring Giselle to the hospital. Josh finally admits the truth; that he and Molly are not engaged. After much yelling, Josh admits that he loves Molly. Molly, surprised, punches him. When Josh regains consciousness, he proposes to Molly. She accepts and they kiss. After a fade to black, we see Josh and Molly in the delivery room as they have their first baby. They name him Max.  Cast  * Shane McRae as Josh Shiffman * Aubrey Dollar as Molly Mahoney * Daniel J. Travanti as Max Shiffman * Janet Ulrich Brooks as Frida Shiffman * Ron Dean as Art Burke * Mary Jo Faraci as Doreen Mahoney * Robert Belushi as Sean Mahoney * Rebecca Spence as Carla Mahoney * Heidi Johanningmeier as Giselle Brousard Production Filming took place in Chicago, Illinois, and Los Angeles, California. As a Chicago native, director John Burgess, having attended film school at USC, wanted to go back to his hometown to make his first feature film. To put together the cast, he called upon two veteran casting directors: Monika Mikkelsen in Los Angeles, and Claire Simon in Chicago. To keep costs down, the production cast locally in both cities except for the lead roles of Josh and Molly. Mikkelsen had cast Shane McRae in previous projects and pitched him to play Josh Shiffman. Reels had been sent from various talent agencies and John Burgess came across Aubrey Dollar for Molly Mahoney. Both actors lived in New York and were flown to Chicago and Los Angeles for filming. The production wanted an established actor with a familiar face to anchor the story and play the dying father. Daniel J. Travanti, a local Chicagoan who had received Emmy and Golden Globes awards, was offered and accepted the role. Janet Ulrich Brooks was then cast as Josh's mom, Frida Shiffman, and Mary Jo Faraci as Molly's mom, Doreen Mahoney, who with their matching red hair could easily be mistaken for the real life mother of Aubrey. Ron Dean, a staple in the Chicago acting community from such films as The Breakfast Club, The Fugitive, and The Dark Knight, accepted the role of Art Burke, Molly's step dad to be, and the parents were all cast. Robert Belushi, well known in Chicago's theater and sketch comedy scene at Second City and Improv Olympic, was cast to play the best friend and over-protective brother, Sean Mahoney, while Rebecca Spence, another staple in the Chicago acting community was subsequently cast as his wife, Molly‚Äôs sister-in-law, Carla Mahoney. Lastly, to round out the main cast a femme fatale was needed to throw a monkey wrench into Josh and Molly getting together too quickly. A local actress, Heidi Johanningmeier, who actually first came in to read for the role of Molly, was instead offered the role of Giselle Brousard. The department heads were filled with local stars from Chicago‚Äôs independent filmmaking scene. Tari Segal was hired to shoot the film. She had just wrapped shooting Phedon Popamichael's feature film, Lost Angeles, whom she had interned for a few years earlier on the film he was shooting, Sideways, while she was still attending Columbia College Chicago. Adri Siriwatt was hired as the production designer. Adri came in for the interview covered in paint from a production that she was working on and the producers could tell she wasn't afraid to do whatever it took to get the job done, even if it meant getting her hands dirty. Aly Barohn was hired as the costume designer. The producers' first meeting with Aly was very similar: she had a quirky style and impressive knowledge of current fashion trends that were going on in Venice Beach and Hollywood out on the West Coast, all the way to the Midwest styles that were dominating every age group in the city of Chicago. Principal photography began in Chicago the last week in October, and many of the crew dressed up in costume on Halloween while filming overnight at O'Hare International Airport. The Windy City portion of the shoot was wrapped up just before Thanksgiving, and then the production was off to Los Angeles for scenes in Hollywood, Venice Beach, and Burbank. When shooting was wrapped in California, John Burgess headed back to Chicago to begin post-production. Ryan Koscielniak, the editor of John's USC graduate thesis film, The Powder Puff Principle, had set up shop in Evanston, IL. The production couldn't afford to hire Ryan full-time, so they started meeting on nights and weekends. The process took longer, but it enabled the production to keep costs down to save what money was left for color timing, sound mixing, and music licensing. The production utilized Illinois' 30% film tax credit for finishing funds and completed all post-production activities locally at the famed Chicago Recording Company and Filmworker's Club.  Release  One Small Hitch premiered at the California Independent Film Festival on November 8, 2012. It was released theatrically in the United States on February 6, 2015.

The episode aired on April 15, 2014 in the United States on FX. It was written by series creator and showrunner Noah Hawley and directed by Adam Bernstein. The title refers to the paradox in logic known as the crocodile dilemma. In the episode, a strange man named Lorne Malvo (Billy Bob Thornton) arrives in Bemidji, Minnesota. Living their daily lives, the town's inhabitants, including zealous police Deputy Molly Solverson (Allison Tolman), police officer and single father Gus Grimly (Colin Hanks), and insecure insurance salesman Lester Nygaard (Martin Freeman), are unaware that this man will impact their lives forever. \\"The Crocodile's Dilemma\\" received critical acclaim and was seen by 2.65 million viewers. It received seven Primetime Emmy Award nominations, including Outstanding Directing for a Limited Series, Movie, or Dramatic Special and Outstanding Writing for a Limited Series, Movie, or Dramatic Special. Plot In January 2006, a drifter named Lorne Malvo (Billy Bob Thornton) crashes a car at night on a wintry rural highway outside Bemidji, Minnesota, after hitting a deer, and cuts his forehead after banging it into the steering wheel. A nearly naked man jumps from the popped trunk and bolts through the snow into the woods. Malvo calmly watches as the man runs away and makes no attempt at pursuit, instead choosing to gaze upon the dying deer. In town, a put-upon insurance salesman named Lester Nygaard (Martin Freeman) runs into Sam Hess (Kevin O'Grady), a former high school bully who intimidates Lester into accidentally running into a window and breaking his nose. At the hospital, Lester meets Malvo and tells him about Sam, and Malvo offers to murder him. Lester fails to respond, but Malvo goes to Sam's workplace, to get a glimpse of him, and later that night murders him at a strip club by throwing a knife into his head. Lester meets Malvo in a motel restaurant and confronts him about the murder. Malvo tells Lester that if Lester does not stand up to \\"the boss, [Lester] will get washed away\\". Meanwhile, Chief Vern Thurman (Shawn Doyle) and Deputy Molly Solverson (Allison Tolman) investigate the car wreck and find the nearly naked man's frozen body in the nearby woods. They also look into Sam's death. While they are questioning Sam's wife Gina (Kate Walsh), Malvo calls the elder son pretending to be an attorney, and claims the younger brother inherited everything, leading the elder son to beat his brother with a hockey stick before Molly tackles him. The police learn that Lester was overheard discussing Sam with another man (Malvo), at the hospital. Lester tries to impress his wife, Pearl (Kelly Holden Bashar), by repairing the couple's washing machine, but he fails at it, and Pearl mocks him. Lester, reaching his breaking point after years of her psychological abuse, hits her with a hammer and kills her. A panicked Lester summons Malvo to help with the aftermath. Vern arrives at Lester's house to question him about Sam, but discovers Pearl‚Äôs body in the basement. Vern radios for backup, but Malvo arrives soon afterward and fatally shoots him. Malvo disappears before Molly shows up, and Lester intentionally knocks himself out to make the killings look like a home invasion. He eventually wakes up in the hospital and notices a gun pellet lodged in his hand. Later, in Duluth, police officer Gus Grimly (Colin Hanks) converses over radio with his daughter Greta (Joey King), until he pulls Malvo over for running a stop sign. Malvo overhears the radio and threatens Gus to either press the issue and face death, or allow Malvo to leave and live. Malvo drives away as a shaken Gus returns to his patrol car. Reception =Ratings= In its initial premiere on FX, the first episode of Fargo had 2.65 million viewers. The show premiered in the UK on Channel 4 on April 20, 2014, and was seen by 1.6 million viewers. =Critical reception= The first episode of the series was critically acclaimed; it currently holds a perfect 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. The A.V. Club writer Emily VanDerWerff gave the episode an A‚àí rating but stated: \\"as much as I like this first episode, it will be hard for anything in this series to match my love of the film, which is perfection\\". IGN reviewer Roth Cornet gave the series premiere a 9 out of 10 \\"Amazing\\" rating, saying: \\"with rich and zany characters, darkly comedic violence, and a tantalizing mystery on tap, Fargo is well-worth watching\\". Dan Snierson of Entertainment Weekly named it the second best television episode of 2014. =Accolades= For the 66th Primetime Emmy Awards, Noah Hawley was nominated for Outstanding Writing for a Miniseries, Movie or a Dramatic Special and Adam Bernstein was nominated for Outstanding Directing for a Miniseries, Movie or a Dramatic Special, for this episode.

Up until 2007, the NSAs were virtually shut out of the CPA in the seventy nine ACP States and hence the concept of the NSA PAnel came out of studying the technical aspects of the CPA to see how best the NSA could participate in Development Cooperation. The Non State Actors Advisory Panel or NSA Panel is an example of how NSAs or civil society can benefit and participate in national development within the CPA in the seventy-nine ACP States. Seven Panels were created in Barbados and the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) to launch this initiative. The importance of the initiative is to encourage citizens' participation in national decision-making and implementation of development projects in these seventy-nine developing and under-developed countries. The critical nature of the Panel is that it is a forum where government, NSAs and the EU meet to discuss, negotiate and make decisions on initiatives for national development. These are all supported by the EU with technical assistance from the respective Governments as part of the Development Cooperation aspect of the CPA. The NSA Panel of Barbados was established in 2006 (along with the other six Panels) by way of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the Government of Barbados (which is represented by the National Authorising Officer, usually the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Economic Affairs) and the European Union (through the European Commission Delegation to Barbados and the OECS). It consists of 14 NSAs, Representatives from the EU and the National Authorising Officer )in each of the countries). Attendance at meetings of all three parties is very critical, because no decisions can be implemented without agreement between the government and the EU. Basically, these two hear from the NSAs and implement NSA programmes. The objective of the Panel, as stated in the MoU, is to promote the participation of the non state actors in national development through the instruments of Development Cooperation established with the European Union (EU) under the Cotonou Partnership Agreement, to which Barbados is a signatory along with the other 78 countries that make up the ACP (Africa, Caribbean and Pacific) Group of Countries. The MoU describes Non State Actors as follows: ‚ÄúOrganisations that bring together the principal existing or emerging structures of the society outside the government and public administration. They are created voluntarily by citizens, their aim being to promote any issue of interest, either general or specific. They are independent of the State and can be profit or non-profit making organisations‚Äù Duration of the Panel The life of the Panel is two years after which a new Panel is appointed. Member organizations of the Panel hold office for a maximum of two years and can be reappointed for a maximum of two additional consecutive years. At the end of every term of two years, the Panel provides written advice to the Government and the Delegation on a proposed Panel composition for the following term. The Panel cannot be dissolved at changes of Government or without the written consent of the Government and the Delegation. Support to the Panel The Government and the Delegation agree to provide logistical support to the Panel. They also agree to attend the meetings of the Panel at least every six months and agree to annually discuss with the Panel how its advice has been considered in formulating policies, strategies, and other decision making. Scope of the Panel The scope of the Panel is to facilitate deeper involvement of civil society in the Barbados/European Union partnership. It is expected that the Panel will participate in political dialogue, policy dialogue, and programming/review of European Union development aid and provide advice on other matters related to Barbados/ European Union partnership as jointly requested by the Government and the Delegation or determined by the Panel. The Panel shall provide advice to the Government and the Delegation on matters described above through joint discussions with the Government and the Delegation or by other means, e.g. written reports as may be decided by the Panel. Activities The Panel is required to meet at least once every quarter however it has been meeting once every month from inception. The Panel is supported by a Secretariat (BANGO) which performs the administrative role on behalf of the Panel. The Secretariat liaises with both the EU and the NAO's Office. Whenever the Panel meets, the Secretariat, EU representatives and representatives from the NAO's Office are always present. While these three entities are not members of the Panel, it is difficult for the Panel to meet even without one of them because of the level of support that is required. The three main projects of the Panel so far are: * The NGO Management Certificate Programme, a one-year programme designed to certify NGO managers and workers; * Grant Fund 2013, which gave maximum grants to NSAs for projects up to BDS$25,000.00; * Assisting BANGO with the establishment of a Web Portal for NGOs.

He saw combat in Korea and three tours of Vietnam, before becoming an instructor and then vice-commander of an organization which developed and evaluated weaponry for the USAF. He was decorated for his combat service and his peacetime role. He died in an accident in Nevada while flying a Soviet-built Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23 jet fighter-bomber. Early life and career USAF F-4 Phantoms over Vietnam Bond was born on 16 December 1929 in Trenton, Tennessee, and attended Marion Military Institute in Marion, Alabama, and the University of Mississippi. He joined the USAF in 1951 and flew 44 combat missions in the F-86 Sabre during the Korean War. He flew F-84 Thunderjets, F-86s and F-100 Super Sabres in Europe, then in 1958 trained at the USAF Fighter Weapons School at Nellis Air Force Base. In 1963 he became chief of the Strike Branch at Kadena Air Base, Okinawa, and flew combat missions over Vietnam in the F-105 Thunderchief. After going to Staff College from 1965 to 1966, he served as F-105 and F-111 project officer at Norton Air Force Base, California. From 1968 to 1969 he flew 213 combat missions from Cam Ranh Air Base in Vietnam, in the F-4 Phantom. On 30 December 1968 in Vƒ©nh L·ª£i District in the Mekong Delta, Bond, by now a major, made repeated ground attacks in poor weather and under heavy automatic ground fire, for which he won the Silver Star. He was an F-100 instructor pilot at Luke Air Force Base, Arizona, from July 1969 to January 1970, when he was given command of the 310th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron, the first USAF unit to fly the A-7 Corsair. While there, he became director of operations for the 58th Tactical Fighter Training Wing. In 1972 he served a third tour in Vietnam, this time in the A-7. In June 1973 he joined USAF HQ at the Pentagon in Washington D.C. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal for his work there in modernizing and integrating weapon systems. He worked in many of the USAF's \\"black\\" programs, which were activities so undercover that they commanded secret funds to avoid scrutiny. In August 1978 he was sent to Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, as commander of the Armament Division, Air Force Systems Command. On 25 April 1980, as a major general, Bond read out President Jimmy Carter's eulogy at a memorial service for the eight American servicemen who died in Operation Eagle Claw, the unsuccessful US attempt to free hostages held by Iran. In June 1981 he became vice commander, Air Force Systems Command, Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland, and was promoted to lieutenant general. Death A MiG-27 in East German markings On 26 April 1984 Bond, who was about to retire, made a farewell visit to \\"an Air Force Systems Command unit\\" believed to have been the 6513th Test Squadron, Red Hats, at Groom Lake. The Red Hats, like the 4477th TES Red Eagles based at Tonopah Test Range, clandestinely operated Soviet aircraft. On a previous visit to Groom, Bond had flown the secret YF-117A prototype. The MiG-23 was known as YF-113 in US service and, along with a greater number of MiG-21s, was part of a collection of Soviet-built aircraft that the 4477th flew. Bond insisted on flying the MiG-23 BN fighter-bomber after a cursory briefing over the cockpit rail, even though it was considered a difficult aircraft and pilots usually received several hours of ground instruction before flying it. On his second high-speed flight, he was flying at 40,000 feet and over Mach 2, and had left the T-38 chase plane that was flying with him far behind, when a hydro-mechanical inhibitor activated, preventing him from disengaging the afterburner. It was designed to avoid sudden shut-downs at high speed that could damage the Tumansky R-29 engine, or even cause it to explode and destroy the aircraft. At such speeds, with the wings fully swept back to 72¬∞, the MiG had very limited pitch authority and was inclined to yaw and roll. Bond lost control, made a distress call (\\"I gotta get out of here\\") and was then killed in the ejection, when the slipstream broke his neck and shredded the canopy of his parachute. The aircraft crashed in the desert, diving in at a 60¬∞ angle and impacting on what is now known as Jackass Flats, part of Area 25 that was still contaminated from NERVA nuclear rocket testing years before. Bond's body was discovered by a USAF sergeant on his way to work, who removed the rank insignia from Bond's flight suit with a pocket knife before going to get help. Aftermath The KM-1 ejection seat used in the MiG-23 The USAF would not confirm or deny that Bond was flying a MiG when he died, and stated that Bond was flying \\"an Air Force specially modified test craft\\", but it leaked the information to a journalist, Fred Hoffman. When Time magazine reported on the accident and the rumors of the US MiG program, the USAF was forced to reveal that it was flying Soviet aircraft. There were fears that the publicity would also lead to the exposure of the F-117 program, which was still secret and was also based at Tonopah, but this did not happen. The accident investigation was chaired by General Gordon E. Williams. The investigation report was kept secret, but one pilot who had seen it commented unsympathetically: \\"He should have read the flight manual.\\" The report was required reading for American MiG pilots in years to come. There was some annoyance that Bond had written off an irreplaceable national asset. Work continued to make the KM-1 ejection seat used in the MiG-23 safe and reliable; another USAF pilot, Mark Postai, had been killed in an attempted ejection from a MiG-23 in 1982. Maintaining the Soviet ejection seats included reverse engineering the pyrotechnic cartridges which fired them, as these had a relatively short life and had to be replaced regularly as the chemicals degraded. Pilots over the age of 45 were not normally supposed to fly solo in fast jets, and Bond was 54 at the time of his fatal crash. Lieutenant Colonel James Tiley, commander of the Red Hats, was reassigned in July, though it is a matter of debate whether this was related to Bond's death. Bond was buried in Ashland, Mississippi, and was survived by his wife Betty and four children. A memorial stone to him was placed in the desert where he crashed. Major Thomas E. Drake, an experienced MiG-23 pilot who frequently said \\"This airplane will kill you today if you let it\\", emphasized the importance of good preparation to Colonel James Evans, who was preparing to learn to fly the Soviet types, by referring to \\"the General Bobby Bond Memorial Checkout: two take-offs, one landing, and a fatal ejection.\\" The 4477th was inactivated in July 1990 but it is likely that the USAF continues to operate Russian aircraft clandestinely, including MiG-29s and Su-27s.

Railway colleges are higher educational institutes which train students for railway careers, mainly in engineering. They differ from other colleges by offering various classes on railway topics (such as Railway electrification, railway operations, etc.) and most students major in some railway specialty. The Soviet Union inherited a few such colleges from the Russian empire and both expanded them and created many new railway colleges. After the demise of the Soviet Union and the resulting decline in railway transportation in the Post-Soviet states, most of these colleges (often renamed as a \\"University\\") continued to operate with government support. Introduction Railway colleges during the Soviet era prepared students for careers in various aspects of railroading, primarily as engineers.See the \\"Great Soviet Encyclopedia\\" (–ë–°–≠) article on railway colleges During the Soviet period they were often known as \\"higher educational institutes\\" (for railways) or vuz (–≤—É–∑ , (an acronym ), and this designation is still in use. In 1967 (Soviet period) they had a total of 215,000 students enrolled, about half of which were correspondence students.Personal letter dated Nov. 15, 1967 to David Lawyer from Professor Nicholas DeWitt (director of \\"International Survey of Educational Development and Planning\\" at Indiana University) However, less than 7000 students graduated each year, mostly in engineering (such as electrical, mechanical, or civil engineering with emphasis on railway applications). Almost 10 years later (in 1976) they had a total of 130 thousand students: 50k daytime students, 12k nite school students, and 52k correspondence students. There were 21 different fields of study including 3 new ones: computer science, applied mathematics, and automatic control systems. During the 9th 5-year plan (1970-1975) they graduated 66 thousand engineers (a little over 12 thousand per years) which is more than reported for the 1960s per above.{–®–∏–ø–µ—Ç–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π, –í.–ù. \\"–ë—ã—Å–æ–∫–∏–µ —Ç—Ä–µ–±–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è –∫ –∫–∞–¥—Ä–∞–º —Ç—Ä–∞–Ω—Å–º–æ—Ä—Ç–∞\\" (High requirements for transport workers) in –ñ–î –¢—Ä–∞–Ω—Å, #1, 1977 pp.63-70 (see p. 65) In 1976 there were then a total of 15 institutes and 86 Tekhnikums. Today (2015), about 25 years after the demise of the Soviet Union that founded many of these colleges, railway universities are still quite active but the mission statements of the two largest ones don't even mention \\"railways\\". Instead, they imply their major mission is \\"transportation\\" which, of course, includes railways. Two major railway universities in 2015 are in St. Petersburg and Moscow. The Moscow \\"University\\" claims to be the 5th largest university in the world in terms of the number of students (about 60,000). :–í.–ü. –Ø–Ω–µ–ª–∏—Å–æ–º \\"–ì–∞–∑–µ—Ç–∞ ¬´–≤—ã—Å—Ç—Ä–µ–ª–∏–≤–∞–µ—Ç¬ª –æ–¥–∏–Ω —Ä–∞–∑; –ò–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä–≤—å—é —Å –≥–ª–∞–≤–Ω—ã–º —Ä–µ–¥–∞–∫—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–º —Å—Ç—É–¥–µ–Ω—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–π –≥–∞–∑–µ—Ç—ã –ú–ò–ò–¢–∞ ¬´–ò–Ω–∂–µ–Ω–µ—Ä —Ç—Ä–∞–Ω—Å–ø–æ—Ä—Ç–∞¬ª –í.–ü. –Ø–Ω–µ–ª–∏—Å–æ–º\\" (The newspaper is a one-shot deal ; Interview with the editor of the student newspaper of MIIT 'Transport Engineer' –í.–ü. –Ø–Ω–µ–ª–∏—Å–æ–º) –ü–æ–ª–∏—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–µ –æ–±—Ä–∞–∑–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ (Political Education (Internet Magazine)) Feb. 1, 2010.

However, only \\"17,000 undergraduate and postgraduate students\\" are claimed on the English part of the official university website:About the university Railway vocational schools Besides railway colleges/universities, there were railway tekhnikums.See The Great Soviet Encyclopedia (1979) for info on tekhnikums These were schools which were mid-level educational institutions somewhat below the college level. They are often known as \\"colleges\\" in Russia todaytekhnikums become \\"colleges\\" but the Russian definition of college (pronounced the same as in English) doesn't correspond with the English definition of college. So it's incorrect to call them \\"colleges\\" if one adheres to the English definition of this word. There was also a somewhat lower level of railway school known as a railway uchilishche or –ü–£ = PU for short. Graduates of these two types of schools were qualified to become technicians, maintaining and repairing railway equipment and track, etc. Some became locomotive drivers along with some graduates of railway colleges. Lists of railway colleges; websites The first two links in a line for a college are: 1. web-article in the Russian Wikipedia (ru wiki) 2. the college \\"official (web)site\\". Many of the college sites are either in Russian or have a Russian version of the site. Even if you can't read Russian, there are pictures to look at. Some sites have an English version which is usually quite incomplete. The date at the end of each entry is the founding date of the college. Today's college (university) names have been much changed since the Soviet era. =Post Soviet railway colleges currently inside the Russian Federation= In the abbreviated university names shown below, such as –ü–ì–£–ü–°, \\"–ì–£–ü–°\\"=\\"–ì–æ—Å—É–¥–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π –£–Ω–∏–≤–µ—Ä—Å–∏—Ç–µ—Ç –ü—É—Ç–µ–π –°–æ–æ–±—â–µ–Ω–∏—è\\" = \\"Government University of Railways\\" = \\"State University of Railways\\".

Russians today seem to be highly motivated to obtain a college education, even if the job prospects are not very good. It was thought by some that under capitalism, there would not be the surplus of college graduates that existed in the USSR. But it turns out that there is an even greater surplus today. Ochkina, A.

In Riga, Latvia Textbooks for railway courses A large number of titles of railway textbooks were published in the USSR.See Bibliography of \\"Rail transport in the Soviet Union\\" for books labeled \\"textbook\\". There are many more such textbooks besides the ones shown in this bibliography. Examples of subjects covered are railway track, cars, locomotives, signalling and communications (including remote control and automation), transport economics, accounting, etc. Many such textbooks included mathematical formulas (and some had differential equations). Every year saw several new such textbooks (or revised editions of existing textbooks).See the Soviet serial \\"–ï–∂–µ–≥–æ–¥–Ω–∏–∫ –∫–Ω–∏–≥–∏ –°–°–°–†\\" (Yearbook of books published, USSR) published in Moscow by \\"–ë—Å–µ—Å–æ—é–∑–Ω–æ–π –∫–Ω–∏–∂–Ω–æ–π –ø–∞–ª–∞—Ç—ã = \\"National book publishers\\" .

Comparison with the United States There is no comparison of railway colleges in the Soviet Union with the United States since there were no railways colleges in the United States. However, the [US] once had railway University courses in Civil EngineeringSee William Hay Educator, researcher, national and international railroad expert and there was a failed attempt at Harvard Business School to create a cadet- system of railway education in the 1920s.Wyckoff, p.97 After World War II the University of Illinois was the only major institution in the US providing instruction in railway engineering (in the Civil Engineering Dept.). After professor W.W. Hay retired from teaching railway engineering there, his position was not replaced and the railway courses were thus abolished. At Harvard Business School there were great expectations for the \\"cadet\\" program but the railroads failed to support it and the graduates from the program obtained positions in other industries. One observer of the railroad's attitude towards education stated that railway senior officials were the result of producing \\"the 'practical man' who had little use for anything learned in school\\".Wyckoff, p.96 Wyckoff's book states (regarding the railroad's \\"Attitudes toward formal education\\") that \\"There was even evidence that the educated man was put upon and ridiculed by other middle managers and workers.\\" Thus the railroads themselves appear to be at least partly responsible for the lack of college level railway education in the US.

His college thesis was the design for a new Mexican National Museum of Archeology and Natural History which during that time was a very innovative idea and design. Prior to his thesis, all archeological artifacts and study groups in Mexico were located on several warehouses, museums and government facilities scattered across the country without a proper organizational system or building. His thesis revolutionized and triggered the efforts to create such institution in Mexico City. .

Hall, among others.  Biography  Neal was born in the Belgian Congo to American missionary parents. In 1942, he joined WMPS, a Memphis radio station. Although he did not originally play country music, he achieved greater success once he specialized in that style in the early 1950s. In 1954, Sam Phillips gave Bob Neal an acetate of Elvis Presley's first record and Bob Neal promoted it on WMPS along with Dewey Phillips' promotion of Elvis's first record on WHBQ. Bob Neal organized live music events and was also an emcee. So, upon Sam Phillips' request, he set up Elvis Presley for his first live performance at Overton Park in Memphis, Tennessee on July 30, 1954.http://scottymoore.net/BobNeal.html \\"Bob Neal, Elvis' second Manager\\": \\"In July of 1954 Bob was one of the local deejays that Sam Phillips gave an acetate of Elvis‚Äô first record which he played on WMPS and later Sam contacted him and asked if he had a spot for Elvis, Scotty and Bill on his show in Overton Park at the end of that month. Bob added them but had to get Elvis in the union first.\\" =Managing Elvis Presley= Bob Neal officially became Elvis Presley's second manager on January 1, 1955, preceded by the band's guitarist Scotty Moore.http://scottymoore.net/BobNeal.html \\"Bob Neal, Elvis' second Manager\\": \\"In the fall of that year Bob started doing bookings for the band and through him they met Oscar Davis who would try to make a tentative deal to take over Elvis' management from Scotty. By the end of the year though Bob had signed on as Elvis‚Äô manager, commencing officially on January 1, 1955.\\" In February 1955, Bob Neal started Elvis Presley Enterprises (EPE, Inc.) to promote the product ‚ÄúElvis Presley‚Äù, with an office at 160 Union Avenue, across from the famous Peabody Hotel, in Memphis, Tennessee. On March 15, 1955, Neal signed an amended one-year contract agreement with Elvis, giving him a 15 percent commission. On November 21, 1955 Elvis‚Äô contract with Sun was purchased by RCA. At that time, Colonel Tom Parker and Bob Neal agreed to split their combined 40 percent commission on Elvis's earnings. Moreover, Bob Neal was growing weary of life on the road, he still had his job as a DJ and, by March 1956, he had opened a record store in Memphis. So, when his contract with Elvis expired on March 15, 1956, he decided not to pursue renewal and Colonel Tom Parker became Elvis‚Äô manager. Neal would later say \\"I always felt that Elvis was going to be a big artist, but I never would have believed how big, so I just preferred to drop out of the scene.\\" =Later career= A few months later, Neal opened a talent agency called Stars, Inc. for representation and booking of artists that would include Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins, Roy Orbison, Sonny James, Warren Smith, Jerry Lee Lewis, etc. In 1958 he freed the others from their contracts and focused solely on Johnny Cash, moving his family along with Johnny's to California. The following year he arranged a tour out of the country to Australia for Johnny, something the Colonel should have done, but would never do for Elvis. However, the Hollywood scene was not as entirely fruitful for them as it was for Elvis and, late in 1960, when their contract expired, they did not renew. They split amicably, with a generous settlement on royalties. Neal returned to Tennessee and set up in Nashville. Through the 1960s he was back in the talent agencies. In 1964, Neal started Country Music News Service, a company that offered taped reports and weekly interviews with top country performers to subscribing radio stations, featuring news items about the country music field and interviews with top country music performers. By the 1970s he would also serve as a director of the Country Music Association. Never critical, he would later praise what the Colonel did with Elvis, though suggest that he himself would probably not have kept him away from performing for a live audience for so long, something that Elvis always enjoyed. The same year that Elvis died, in 1977, Neal received the Man of The Year Award from the Nashville Association of Talent Directors for his great contribution in the field of country music. Neal died on May 9, 1983 at the Park View Hospital in Nashville. The following year, on October 12, 1984 Bob Neal was elected into the Country Music Disc Jockey Hall Of Fame.

The NBO wants to contribute in overcoming the stereotypes of nationalism, racism, xenophobia and homophobia by artistic excellence in classical music.  Background  Former Yugoslavia consisted of six republics and two autonomous regions. Within a decade after the death of long time president Josip Broz Tito (1892-1980) nationalistic tensions inside this multi-ethnic and multi- cultural state grew enormously, and in the early 1990s Yugoslavia broke apart with an outburst of violence, a bitter war in Bosnia and ethnic cleansing. 2.2 million refugees had been displaced by the end of the Bosnian war. Seven new states were established, each with an own currency, with an own army and with border controls. Many families and friends were split up and large parts of the population deplored the development and the wars. Today Slovenia und Croatia belong to the European Union, thus creating a heavily fortified border within the former Yugoslavian nation. Although Slovenia, Montenegro and Kosovo now use the Euro as their currency and although most of the succession states are seeking membership in the European Union, most borders, currencies and restrictions are still in effect.  Manifesto  Prior to the formation of the orchestra, the musicians declared their intentions in a so-called Manifesto: :\\"NBO is founded on two basic premises. The social aspect of the project is achieved by the deconstruction of stereotypes, overcoming of nationalism, racism, xenophobia, homophobia, the gory legacy of the past and through the affirmation of cultural values that are in a complete state of disarray in local transitional societies. Being fully aware of the past, NBO is not a project nostalgic about ex-Yugoslavia. On the contrary, it is completely committed to the future. Nostalgia abolishes criticism and critical engagement is at the basis of our idea. The right to the future requires the courage to face all traumatic facts from the past. An honest dialogue about difficult responsibility issues dispels demons from the past and opens doors for possibilities that are yet to come.\\" :\\"From the artistic side, we wish to create a symphonic orchestra where all members will have the motivation, engagement and energy of a chamber orchestra and will breathe like a big chamber ensemble. NBO is an ensemble of soloists. We are asking questions and with our performances we offer some answers: Why a symphony orchestra in 21st century? Why classical music at all? How can music become relevant again? How can music become a way of life again? What can be done with the ritual of classical concert, which hasn‚Äôt changed since the 19th century? How can classical music stop being a museum exhibit? How can the relation between the audience and musicians be changed? Why does no alternative scene of classical music exist? What does it mean: to listen? What are our expectations and valuations based on while listening? How can we open up for something different? How can we play and listen freely?\\"Founding Manifesto, No Border Orechestra, retrieved May 25, 2014 The founders of NBO furthermore state that their ‚Ä≥main interest is the connection between music and life‚Ä≥, that they were influenced by the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra and their founder Daniel Barenboim and that they wish ‚Ä≥to avoid the trap of artistic excellence as an excuse for marginalized self-complacency, voluntary exclusion from society and time.‚Ä≥  Stunning start, international acclaim  Although the originally planned start of the orchestra in 2011 with Mahlers Resurrection Symphony could not be realized due to lack of appropriate fundings,No Borders Orchestra , project description, retrieved May 25, 2014 the project had a stunning start thereafter. The NBO unites around fifty excellent musicians from almost all music centers in the former Yugoslavia ‚Äî from Belgrade, Ljubljana, Zagreb, Sarajevo, Skopje, Pri≈°tina and Novi Sad. They were especially trained by renowned musicians from several German orchestras such as Berlin Philharmonic or WDR Symphony Orchestra Cologne. =2012 = The orchestra first performed on October 9, 2012 in the small town of Kanji≈æa (hungar. Magyarkanizsa) in the Banat. The Banat no longer exists as a political entity, but is currently divided between three countries ‚Äî Romania, Serbia and Hungary. This region is noted for its diversity of population, languages and cultures. Also emblematic was the choice of the musical program ‚Äî Prokofievs Classical Symphony, Ives' The Unanswered Question and Kod√°lys Dances of Gal√°nta. Two days later, the orchestra inaugurated the Belgrade Music Festival with the same program, just adding Beethovens Fifth Piano Concerto with Hinrich Alpers as soloist. Public and critics were stunned, the brand-new orchestra performed as if it had been in existence for decades: ‚ÄúOn a specially arranged stage, in a whirlpool of electricity, in the audience vibrating with different generations and sensibilities, gathered for the event as if from an unknown planet and deeply immerged in expecting miracles of sounds, we finally met the No Borders Orchestra,‚Äù wrote Zorica Kojiƒá of the daily newspaper, Danas.No Borders Orchestra ready for next steps after inauguration concert at BEMUS Festival , retrieved May 25, 2014 =2013 = The orchestra's 2013 season started on March 16 at the Novi Sad Synagogue with ≈Ωebeljans The Horses of Saint Mark, followed by an orchestral version of Alb√©niz Iberia with soloist Edin Karamazov (guitar) and ‚Äî again ‚Äî Kod√°ly. The next night the same program was repeated in Belgrade. In August, the orchestra toured several festivals in former Yugoslavia ‚Äî Kotor and Herceg Novi, both in Montenegro, Trebinje in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as in Ljubljana in Slovenia. Their soloist this time was renowned guitarist Milo≈° Karadagliƒá in Rodrigo's Concierto de Aranjuez. Stanko Madic, first violin player of the orchestra, noted on their performance in Trebinje: :\\"In an environment that is extremely nationalistic, we were greeted with significant distrust since we have several Albanian musicians from Kosovo. But at the end of the concert, the audience reacted with standing ovations. They did not only accept the Albanians who were playing in their city, but numerous people at the city square also listened very carefully to the demanding classical music programme in a city where no symphony orchestra has performed before.\\"Balkan musicians promote interethnic co-operation, retrieved May 25, 2014 In October of the same year, the ensemble played Schubert's Unfinished Symphony, Wagner's Siegfried Idyll and again Kod√°ly's Dances of Gal√°nta at the Cathedral of Saint Mother Teresa in Pristina. Ten days later the orchestra first appeared on an international stage ‚Äî at the Radialsystem V in Berlin, with ≈Ωebeljan, Wagner, Kod√°ly and Auerbach's Sogno di Stabat Mater. = The First Opera = In 2014, Premil Petroviƒá was invited to conduct Brett Baileys new production of Verdis Macbeth in Cape Town where he conducted a local orchestra. During the preparation of Macbeth, the conductor quoted Serbian performance artist, Marina Abramovic, to explain his frame of reference: ‚Ä≥She said, ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs not important what you are doing, it‚Äôs important from which state of mind you are doing it.‚Ä≥ And he explained his uneasiness with Verdi's opera: ‚Ä≥This is very rare. I cannot remember any other opera without love. There is only power, greed, hatred, crime and revenge. [‚Ä¶] Between Macbeth and Lady Macbeth, there is no love at all. They support each other‚Ä¶ strategically.‚Ä≥Theresa Smith: ‚ÄòUgly‚Äô drama made beautiful, ToNight, May 20, 2014 Nevertheless, the premiere was very well received. The NBO took over for the European tour of this production starting with festival performances in Brussels, Rotterdam and at the Vienna Festival.

Stanford is the founder of Stanford Caskey, a political research and crisis communications firm based in Austin, Texas and Chicago, Illinois. Career Stanford attended Lewis & Clark College, where he received a bachelor of arts degree in Russian in 1992. He studied Russian because he wanted to become a spy. During his final semester at Lewis & Clark, he studied at Moscow State Pedagogical University. Stanford worked at the Moscow Guardian following his graduation and later at the Los Angeles Time's Moscow bureau, where he worked as an investigative reporter under the byline J. Andrew Stanford. While at the Times, Stanford helped uncover the diversion of American funds from privatization efforts to then-Russian president Boris Yeltsin‚Äôs political party. He also worked briefly as a model for Ziegenbock beer. Stanford became involved in politics following his introduction to members of Ann Richards' 1994 Texas gubernatorial campaign staff by his editor at the Moscow Guardian, Billy Rogers, who was formerly a Texas-based Democratic operative. Stanford moved to Texas to work on Ann Richards' campaign, where he was a researcher and deputy press secretary. In 1997, following his work on the Richards campaign, Stanford founded Stanford & Ryan Research (now known as Stanford Caskey) with the late Tom Ryan.

The outlet of the lake is designated \\"Cinconsine Creek\\" by Commission de toponymie du Qu√©bec (Geographical Names Board of Qu√©bec), which goes south on 5.5 km (including one kilometer across Boulanger Lake). After crossing the dam, water accumulates into the small lake Napinu, which discharges to the south to \\"Lac Miroir\\" (Mirror Lake). The first segment of the river, between the dam and the lake Cinconcine Boulanger Lake, is 2.5 km. The distance between Boulanger Lake and the Rivi√®re aux Rats (La Tuque) is 2 km.

Mining  In the early days of condor agate collecting, a typical month of effort would yield 1 ton of good agates. Currently, excavation is required to find the agates, so an extra effort is needed to supply the ever growing demand for these gems.

Up to six human and computer-controlled players form two teams. Each uses an analog stick and a single button to control triangles that shoot charged projectiles at a ball and other players. The objective is to knock the ball into the opposing team's goal. Apart from exhibition matches, the game has a scenario challenge-based Arcade mode, and supports online team and ranked multiplayer matchmaking. Videoball has a simple visual style with bright colors, basic shapes, and many customization options. The game originated in a dare to make a \\"one-button StarCraft. Videoball designer and Action Button founder Tim Rogers prototyped the game and challenged himself to keep its game mechanics spartan and accessible, yet challenging for competitive players. Action Button and publisher Iron Galaxy released Videoball for PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One platforms on July 12, 2016. Linux and OS X releases were planned, but have since been cancelled. Videoball received favorable reviews. Critics praised the precision and craft of its game design as well as its welcoming aesthetics but remarked that its visual simplicity belied the depth of its gameplay.  Gameplay  Videoball plays as a two-dimensional hybrid of air hockey and soccer on a single screen. Players form two teams of one to three players. Each player uses an analog stick to control a triangle-shaped avatar and presses a single button to shoot triangle-shaped projectiles. The object of the game is to knock one or more circular balls into the opposing team's goal. Players hold the button to charge a shot, which fires upon release. The projectile can propel the ball, block other projectiles, and incapacitate opponents. Since the shot is triangle-shaped, it can only drive the ball for some distance before the ball veers off-course. The longer the player charges their shot, the more powerful the projectile becomes. A tap of the button shoots a small, low-impact projectile that disintegrates upon impact. A medium tap, about a second long, creates a larger, persistent triangle that dribbles the ball as long as the two continue to make contact. The third charge level shoots a large triangle that fires the ball with explosive force. This \\"slam\\" can be reversed by an opponent by firing any projectile into the slammed ball. If held for an additional second, the fourth level of a charged shot creates a defensive square barrier for the player to place on the playing field. These square barriers will disintegrate upon absorbing player projectiles. Player triangles that collide with balls or projectiles are knocked back and briefly incapacitated. Many of the game's common actions are named. For instance, players hit by projectiles are \\"tackled\\" and projectiles that hit projectiles are \\"intercepted\\". The game supports up to six human or artificial intelligence players in local and online multiplayer, except on the PlayStation 4, which has a human player limit of four per console. Videoball has team and ranked matchmaking multiplayer modes. There is no set practice game mode, but players can train against computer-controlled opponents in exhibition matches and the scenario- based Arcade mode, in which the player faces two computer-controlled opponents in specific level configurations. The Arcade mode artificial intelligence personalities each have fitting names, such as Homer (who stays near its endzone) and Punchy (who bullies players with projectiles). Some work in pairs to establish gameplay concepts, such as Tippy, who passes the ball to Toppy, who maintains the top of the field. Videoball rules are fully customizable. Players choose from several color schemes, field layouts and patterns, and the number of balls in play. They can also choose the time limit and allow for special scoring, in which special shots count as more than one point. The game is visualized in all solid, bright colors and basic shapes, and features voiceover announcers. Games last an average of four minutes, though they can last several times more.  Development  Videoball designer Tim Rogers describes the game as \\"an abstract minimalist electronic sport\\". Its development began as a dare from QWOP developer Bennett Foddy, Rogers's friend, to make a \\"one-button StarCraft. Rogers, the founder of Action Button Entertainment, made what he estimated as 40 or 50 inconsequential prototypes before adding an analog stick to the button. Videoball evolved from a slow- paced strategy game to a fast-paced sports game as it graduated from early prototypes. Rogers compared the game's design process to the austerity of Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares, wherein Ramsay convinces failing restaurants to reduce their menu size and make those few dishes well. Rogers commented that this emphasis on fewer elements makes each element's nuances more prominent. Polygon Tracey Lien described the development team's process as \\"chasing a certain purity\\". Rogers conceived Videoball as a sport without narrative or artifice and thus sought to avoid traditional video game metaphors, such as knowing the triangle avatars and projectiles as \\"ships\\" or \\"bullets\\". He wanted the game to be accessible to newcomers but still fun and strategic for experts. The game designer applied his conception of Super Mario Bros. 3 \\"sticky friction\\"‚Äîa sense through which the player feels the physics affecting their avatar‚Äîto the game's controls. Rogers emphasized the importance of strategy in playing the game and noted that players in prototype games played roles or zones like in competitive basketball (e.g, center or forward positions). Rogers has livestreamed prerelease sessions of Videoball via Twitch. He broadcast gameplay from Twitch's booth at PAX East 2014 with indie publisher Midnight City. In February 2014, PC Gamer Wes Fenlon reported that the game still had work left in its artwork, soundtrack, new arenas, and online multiplayer mode. Videoball was selected for the July 2014 Evolution Championship Series fighting game tournament's Indie Showcase. The developers had plans to include cross-platform multiplayer, support for more than six simultaneous players, and a campaign mode. Rogers has said that ranked matchmaking was highly requested by fans. Videoball was planned for release in 2014, and ultimately launched on July 12, 2016, on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Microsoft Windows, with Iron Galaxy as its publisher. Linux and OS X releases were planned, but have since been cancelled.  Reception  Pre- release reviewers all cited Videoball minimalism both in aesthetics and gameplay, and compared the game with the skill and strategy of football and basketball. Before its release, PC Gamer Wes Fenlon found himself thinking about Videoball daily after last playing two weeks prior. He credited its \\"addictive sort of fun\\" and his own excitement for local multiplayer on PC alongside titles such as Hokra and TowerFall. He felt that the game's tagline of being appropriate for both a child's birthday party and prison was correct albeit silly. Fenlon praised the game's minimalist visuals, \\"peppy music, and chirpy sound effects\\". He compared the player's controls to that of Asteroids and contrasted its simplicity with the 100-hour onboarding process for League of Legends, having learned how to play Videoball in just \\"a couple minutes\\". Jason Bohn (Hardcore Gamer) wrote that the simple controls made the game accessible for new teams to quickly strategize. Polygon Tracey Lien compared the game's feel to basketball, football, and hockey. Citing the strong role of strategy in playing the game, she compared the array of projectiles fired to military strategy or a football play. Game Informer Kyle Hilliard said his time with the game left him \\"wanting more\\". Graham Smith (Rock, Paper, Shotgun) found Videoball difficult to spectate and had trouble distinguishing between the players' triangle avatars. Jason Bohn (Hardcore Gamer) only became interested in the game after testing it, and credited the quality of its game design with changing his opinion. The game received generally favorable reviews at launch. Reviewers noted the precision and craft of its game design. Reviewers compared Videoball to other games including the South Asian board game Carrom, and a cross between Asteroids (1979) and Rocket League (2015). GameSpot reviewer wrote that Videoball was the 2016 equivalent of Rocket League, in that both had idiosyncratic concepts and little prior anticipation, but simple and fun gameplay. Samit Sakar (Polygon) felt that he was in control of all parts of his play, even as he lost to computer-controlled opponents. Joshua Calixto (Kill Screen) found himself naming his preferred ball-handling techniques as he played. While Nic Rowen (Destructoid) said that he would normally avoid game mechanics discussion in his reviews, \\"Videoball is all about its mechanics\\". He praised the momentum and \\"pleasing grip\\" behind the avatars and the acceleration physics of changing direction or moving out of a full stop. Polygon Sakar noted the game's balance between competition and enjoyment. Despite the game's simple controls, Destructoid found that sloppy play could easily backfire on the player. Jason D'Aprile (GameSpot) said that the game depends on things knocking into each other for its entertainment, such as bank shots and hitting opponents. He disliked that the only control style was tank-style controls. Polygon initially wanted a tutorial mode but ultimately felt that the single-player Arcade mode, with set scenarios against two computer-controlled opponents, filled this need. Destructoid called the Arcade mode increasingly unfair in its addition of field disadvantages to the player. While Polygon and Destructoid praised the artificial intelligence of the computer-controlled avatars, GameSpot wrote that they were simple, and often ignored balls during single-player matches. Critics praised the game's welcoming aesthetics, and some, its visual design. Kill Screen considered the game's affect delightful and Destructoid said its bright color scheme and rubber-like surfaces were disarming and recalled the feel of an inflatable castle. Polygon reviewer described the title as having \\"old-school sensibilities\\" in its arcade-style visual design, with simple geometry and flat 2D art. He added that the game succeeds in particular because of its \\"goofy tone\\" and \\"delightful wrapper\\" of music, scrolling ticker, and fanciful announcers, which managed to charm him without appearing inauthentic. GameSpot reviewer wrote that Videoball audiovisual replication of 1990s-era Sega aesthetics triggered instant \\"warm and fuzzy ... nostalgia\\". Reviewers said that the game's visuals deceptively betrayed the depth of its gameplay. Calixto of Kill Screen concluded that Videoball \\"feels like it's trying to knock down barriers to entry\\" in its \\"bubbly and peaceful\\" visual design, with gradients and 90s Japanese arcade-style music. He thought, however, that the voiceovers were somewhat campy. Reviewers noted the game's accessibility. Calixto of Kill Screen said that Videoball countered a trend in games culture that relied on learning professional strategies online in order to play competitively. He cited the affordances for experimentation in the game's controls and saw Videoball as being primarily concerned with awakening \\"its own brand of DIY metagaming\\", hence the reviewer's interest in naming his own techniques. Calixto further praised the game for resisting the standardization of one correct way to play with its variety of game fields. While Rowen (Destructoid) doubted that Videoball would be the future of eSports, he concluded that the game made for good local multiplayer fun, and vastly preferred the experience of local to online multiplayer. He compared the title to Super Bomberman in how quickly the game escalates from a friendly match to cut-throat competition.

Cole played in Minor League Baseball for the New York Mets organization from 1998 to 2000, becoming one of the top prospects in baseball. He died in a car accident at the age of 22 in 2001. Career Cole was born in Meridian, Mississippi and attended Meridian High School. He played both baseball and American football, scoring a school record 22 touchdowns in his senior year. He received numerous offers to play college football from Division I schools, but decided to pursue a career in baseball. The Detroit Tigers selected Cole in the 36th round of the 1997 Major League Baseball Draft, but he declined the Tigers $5,000 offer and instead attended Navarro College. In his lone season at Navarro he hit .524 with 27 home runs, 82 runs batted in (RBI), 95 runs scored and 49 stolen bases in 60 games. For his play, he was named Baseball America's Junior College Player of the Year. Cole was then drafted by the New York Mets in the 18th round of the 1998 Major League Baseball Draft and chose to sign. He made his professional debut that season for the Kingsport Mets. After 56 games with Kingsport, he was promoted to the Pittsfield Mets, where he played in two games. Overall, he hit .298/.315/.487 with five home runs, 36 RBI and 16 stolen bases. Cole played the 1999 season with the Capital City Bombers. In 125 games, he hit .316/.362/.522 with 18 home runs, 71 RBI and 50 stolen bases. Prior to the 2000 season, Baseball America ranked him as the Mets fourth best prospect. He started the season with the St. Lucie Mets. After hitting .312/.356/.528 with 15 home runs and 54 stolen bases in 91 games, he was promoted to the Double-A Binghamton Mets. He struggled early on, hitting only .136 in his first 59 bats, but rebounded to hit .350 over his next 117 at-bats. Overall, he hit .301/.347/.494 with 19 home runs, 86 RBI and 69 stolen bases. For his play, he was named the Mets Minor League Player of the Year and was honored in a pregame ceremony at Shea Stadium. After the season, he played for the Scottsdale Scorpions in the Arizona Fall League. Prior to the 2001 season, Cole was ranked by Baseball America as the Mets third best prospect and the 64th best in all of baseball. He was invited to spring training for the first time that season, where he impressed coaches, including Mookie Wilson. Death On March 31, 2001, Cole was driving to his parents home in Meridian from Mets spring training in Port St. Lucie, Florida, when he lost control of his vehicle, causing it to roll numerous times and flip over. He had been trying to reenter the road after another car had entered his lane causing him to enter the median. Cole, who was not wearing his seat belt, was ejected from the car causing major injuries to his skull, brain, lungs and several other organs. He was taken to Jackson Memorial Hospital where he was pronounced dead a few hours later. His cousin was also in the car, but was wearing a seat belt and avoided serious injury. In 2010, his family won $131 million in a lawsuit filed against the Ford Motor Company, claiming that the Ford Explorer (the car Cole was driving) is \\"defective and unreasonably dangerous for the uses for which it was marketed because the vehicle has an unreasonable tendency to roll when used as Ford marketed it to be used [as a station wagon replacement], and that the vehicle is also defective and unreasonably dangerous from an occupant protection or 'crashworthiness' standpoint because the safety belt failed to remain locked and permitted Brian to be thrown from the car and killed.\\" Teammate and friend, Pat Strange, named his son Brian Cole Strange, in honor of Cole.

Named after nearby Fort Lancaster, it is one of the few natural fords on the Pecos River, otherwise known for its steep banks that made crossing difficult.  History  Lancaster Crossing formed where an arroyo on the west side of the river washed out rock and gravel from a canyon in the mountains, creating low banks and a wide shallow river bottom. It was first used by the Native Americans of West Texas who crossed the Pecos on their way to and from raids on Mexico, discarding items taken from their captives at the site, giving it its early name of \\"Indian Ford.\\" The U. S. Army survey expedition of Lieutenant Colonel Joseph E. Johnston that established the San Antonio-El Paso Road in 1849 used the ford and established a ferry a mile upstream of the ford at Pecos Crossing, at a site that was used off and on for decades. This first ferry was described by Robert A. Eccleston, a civilian forty-niner travelling with that expedition on his way to California: > When I first came up I supposed the Army encampment to be on this side > (east) of the river, when I was surprised by finding the River Pecos ... > running close to our wagon. Were it not for the road that is cut through the > bank and the tall grass that is flattened, you would be unable to discover > that a river flowed here until within one or two feet of it. Not a solitary > tree or clump of brush marks its course. The river is about 70 feet wide > where the ferry boat crossed it. It is uniformly wide, generally, & the > water of the color of prepared cacoa without milk. Its depth here is about > 10 ft.; the banks are perpendicular. The water is not as unpalatable as was > reported. It tastes a little saltish, but when cleared by the aid of a > prickly pear, ..., it is quite drinkable.

Howes, > Overland to California on the Southwestern Trail, University of California > Press, Berkeley, 1950, p.89-91. Eccleston says they crossed their wagons, draught animals and horses on the ferry with the river running 6 miles an hour, and sent their herd of cattle to swim across the river a mile down at the ford. He also mentions that some cattle swimming across the river at the ferry had to be hauled by ropes up the steep banks on the other side if they missed landing at the cut in the bank on the other side. Today the ford lies just south of the Texas State Highway 290 bridge, which crosses the Pecos River southeast of Sheffield.

The dam was intended to impound a relatively small reservoir in the central portion of Marble Canyon to develop hydroelectric power. Plans centered on two sites between miles 30 and 40 in the canyon. At one point a tunnel was proposed to a site just outside Grand Canyon National Park to develop the site's full power generation potential, reducing the Colorado River to a trickle through the park. Although first proposed in the 1920s to generate hydroelectricity, work did not begin until the dam was incorporated as part of the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (USBR)'s Pacific Southwest Water Plan in the 1940s for its Central Arizona component. Together with Bridge Canyon Dam, located at the lower end of the Grand Canyon, it would have provided the hydroelectric power necessary to lift Colorado River water from Lake Havasu to central Arizona's farms and cities, including Phoenix and Tucson. The two dams would have operated as \\"cash register\\" facilities to provide funds for future reclamation projects through the sale of cheap hydropower. After a series of studies and site investigations, the dam was abandoned as a project in order to facilitate legislation creating the Central Arizona Project. The dam sites were incorporated into Marble Canyon National Monument in 1968, which was absorbed into Grand Canyon National Park in 1975. Project description First proposed in the 1940s by the United States Bureau of Reclamation, the location in Marble Canyon was regarded as one of the most remote and difficult-to-access dam sites in the United States, about below the rim of the canyon. The proposed dam was of moderate size, about high, using a thin-arch concrete design and retaining about 363,000 acre-feet. To keep the small reservoir free of silt, silt retention dams were needed on the tributary canyons. The retention dam in Paria Canyon was planned to be tall, and only wide at the base and wide at the crest, retaining 100 years of silt deposits. Despite these measures, the Marble Canyon reservoir was projected to have a lifespan of 104 years before filling with silt. One appealing aspect of a Marble Canyon damsite was the potential to develop the Grand Canyon's hydroelectric potential without building a dam or reservoir in Grand Canyon National Park by diverting about 90% of the Colorado River's waters at Marble Canyon into a tunnel, in diameter and capable of carrying about , to a site in the western part of the canyon in what was then Kaibab National Forest. The plan would provide about of hydraulic head for power generation. The power plant would produce about 6.5 billion kilowatt hours (KWh) per year ‚Äì almost twice that of Hoover Dam. The tunnel would allow the hydroelectric system to effectively bypass Grand Canyon National Park, avoiding the construction of more dams within the park between Marble and Bridge. A flow of would be released from Marble Canyon at all times ‚Äì a \\"scenic trickle\\" ‚Äì for wildlife and recreational purposes in the Grand Canyon. This water would be released through a 22 megawatt power station at the base of the dam, with an annual energy production of 164 million kilowatt hours. Together, the two dams would utilize most of the elevation drop between Lee's Ferry and Lake Mead, which represents one of the biggest untapped hydroelectric potentials in the United States. Map showing the Marble and Bridge Canyon Dam projects proposed by the Bureau of Reclamation A number of accessory lakes or pools were projected in the adjacent Deer Creek drainage, or possibly at a dam on Kanab Creek. The power station at Deer Creek would have been at the head of the reservoir backed up by the never-built Bridge Canyon Dam. By the 1960s the tunnel project had been dropped in favor of a 600 MW power station at the dam's base, reducing the project's costs considerably. The two dams would be operated as \\"cash register\\" power plants, meaning that sale of hydroelectricity would pay for their construction cost as well as provide funds for future reclamation projects. The power thus produced would be vital for pumping along the Central Arizona Project (CAP), which would lift water from the Colorado River near Lake Havasu to central and southern Arizona. The pumped water would reach as far as Tucson, which sits about higher than the Colorado River. The Bureau had even grander visions, too: eventually, this generated revenue would be necessary to fund water import projects from the Columbia River system to the Colorado River, which continues to face shortages due to over-appropriation of its flow. Thus, \\"hydropower at Bridge and Marble Canyon Dams was viewed as an instrument and not as a major goal in itself\\". Exploration The feasibility of Marble Canyon Dam was first explored in the 1920s by the United States Geological Survey, which designated sites for \\"an unbroken string of [hydroelectric] dams from the mountains of Colorado and Wyoming to the last canyons of the Colorado River along the California/Arizona border\\". Although the Bureau of Reclamation expressed interest at this time in developing hydroelectric generation at the Marble site, these plans were postponed in favor of building the Hoover Dam, which would provide a much greater storage capacity for irrigation and flood control. However, once Hoover was completed the Bureau once again set its sights on the Grand Canyon, which has the greatest hydroelectric potential of any canyon in the American Southwest. In the late 1940s, crews led by Bureau engineer Bert Lucas began to survey Marble Canyon and identified at least two suitable dam sites, one below Lee's Ferry and the second at . A road had to be built to connect the nearest highway to \\"one of the most inaccessible damsites ever explored by Bureau of Reclamation engineers\\". In 1949 the Bureau opened bids for the construction of a cableway to transport workers and materials down into the remote canyon at Mile 32.8. Once the cableway was completed, a temporary camp was set up on the bottom of the gorge, and exploratory drilling work commenced in 1951. The work at the lower site at river mile 39.5 left two drifts measuring about by and about deep in the cliffs on either side of the river, together with 32 drill holes in the river bed. At the upper site, about upstream at river mile 32.8, there were a total of 35 drill holes and two drifts and deep. The work sites were accessed by an aerial tram from the rim. Although the lower site was preferred due to an additional of hydraulic head and potentially 45% larger reservoir than was possible at the upper site, it required more work to remediate weak rock joints. The project was not pursued by the Bureau of Reclamation in the 1950s. In 1960 the Arizona Power Authority became interested in the site, whose reservoir would have been entirely in Arizona, giving the state control over the waters and power generation. In 1963 the effort was endorsed by Bureau of Reclamation director Floyd Dominy. Investigations for the project's feasibility report extended into 1964. In 1965 a Bureau of Reclamation report concluded that solution cavities in the upstream limestone would prevent the reservoir from holding water. By 1968, as part of a bargain between the Arizona delegation to Congress, which supported the Central Arizona Project, and the California delegation, which opposed the project and the dam, the Marble Canyon project was dropped from the plan. Abandonment Redwall Cavern would have been flooded by the lower dam In 1969 President Lyndon B. Johnson proclaimed the establishment of Marble Canyon National Monument, effectively forestalling the possibility of a dam in Marble Canyon. In 1975 the monument was added to Grand Canyon National Park by the Grand Canyon Enlargement Act. The lower dam would have flooded a number of natural features, including Redwall Cavern and Vasey's Paradise. The upper dam was located just above the cavern, and was sometimes referred to as Redwall Dam.

He was reviled in traditional sources for his cruelty, avarice, and lack of faithfulness to Later Jin.  Background  It is not known when Zhang Yanze was born. He was said to be of Tujue ancestry, but whose ancestors had settled in Taiyuan. Both his grandfather and father served as officers at the special Yinshan Command ()Old History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 98. ‚Äî a special command of non-Han Chinese soldiers of the north, traditionally commanded by the Shatuo chieftains of the Zhuye (Êú±ÈÇ™, later Li () clan, subordinate to the military governor (Jiedushi) of Tang's Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi).New Book of Tang, vol. 218. In Zhang Yanze's youth, he was described to be strong and brave, with yellow-tinted eyes that glowed in the dark, making him look animalistic.  During Later Tang  During the reigns of Later Tang's first two emperors, Li Cunxu and Li Siyuan, Zhang Yanze served as a cavalry officer. (It is possible, although not clearly stated in historical accounts, that he might have already been serving under Li Cunxu prior to the founding of Later Tang, when Li Cunxu was the prince of Later Tang's predecessor state Jin.) Due to his accomplishments, he was given terms as prefects for several prefectures. (During this time, his family might have entered into a political alliance by marriage with that of Li Siyuan's son-in-law Shi Jingtang, as suggested by the New History of the Five Dynasties;New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 52. the Zizhi Tongjian suggested, instead, that the political alliance by marriage was with the family of another general, Yang Guangyuan.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 283.)  During Later Jin  = During Shi Jingtang's reign = In 936, Shi Jingtang, with military support from Khitan Empire's Emperor Taizong, overthrew then-ruling Later Tang emperor Li Congke and established his own state of Later Jin.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 280. Shi made Zhang Yanze the prefect of Cao Prefecture (ÊõπÂ∑û, in modern Heze, Shandong). Zhang later served under Yang Guangyuan against Fan Yanguang when Fan rebelled against Shi, and, for Zhang's accomplishments during the campaign against Fan, he was made the military governor of Zhenguo Circuit (ÈéÆÂúã, headquartered in modern Weinan, Shaanxi), and later was moved to Zhangyi Circuit (ÂΩ∞Áæ©, headquartered in modern Pingliang, Gansu). While Zhang governed Zhangyi, one of his close associates was his secretary Zhang Shi (), who was a clansman of his. At that time, one of Zhang Yanze's sons also served on his staff, but often displeased his father Zhang Yanze, and was often physically punished by whipping and battering. In or shortly before 941, as the son feared continuous physical punishments, he decided to flee, but was captured when he fled to Qi Prefecture (ÈΩäÂ∑û, in modern Jinan, Shandong) and delivered to the imperial court. Shi ordered that he be sent back to his father Zhang Yanze, believing that Zhang Yanze would not punish his son harshly. Instead, Zhang Yanze wanted to put his son to death. Zhang Shi, finding this to be overly cruel, urged against it repeatedly, such that Zhang Yanze got angry at him and shot at him with arrows. As other close associates of Zhang Yanze's disliked Zhang Shi, they then falsely accused him. In fear, Zhang Shi fled. Zhang Yanze launched soldiers to try to chase Zhang Shi down, but was unable to catch Zhang Shi before Zhang Shi fled to nearby Jingnan Circuit (ÈùúÈõ£, headquartered in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi). Jingnan's military governor Li Zhou () reported this to Shi. Shi, not wanting to offend Zhang Yanze, ordered that Zhang Shi be exiled to Shang Prefecture (ÂïÜÂ∑û, in modern Shangluo, Shaanxi). Zhang Yanze, however, was not satisfied, and sent the commander of his army, Zheng Yuanzhao () to the imperial court to demand that Zhang Shi be returned to Zhangyi; Zheng went as far as stating at the imperial court, \\"If Zhang Yanze were not given Zhang Shi back, there would be unforeseeable consequences.\\" Shi felt compelled to return Zhang Shi to Zhangyi. Upon Zhang Shi's arrival in Zhangyi, Zhang Yanze executed him by cutting open his mouth and his chest, and also cutting off his limbs.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 282. Hearing of his son's cruel death, Zhang Shi's father Zhang Duo () went to the imperial court to claim his son's innocence. In 942, as a result, Shi ordered that Zhang Yanze be replaced with Wang Zhou (). Once Wang took office, he submitted a report listing 26 unlawful deeds that Zhang Yanze had carried out as military governor of Zhangyi and reporting that, as a result, over 5,000 households had fled or been displaced. Among these additional misdeeds that Wang reported were allegations that he, without imperial order, had attacked non-Han tribes but suffered a crushing defeat; that he, after that defeat, seized over 1,000 horses from the people to replace the lost military horses; and that he had put the officer Yang Hong (), who had escaped the defeat, in cruel fashion similar to Zhang Shi's death ‚Äî Yang's limbs were broken before he was decapitated. Despite many imperial officials' urging, including petitions by the consultant Zheng Shouyi () and the deputy minister of justice Li Tao () that Zhang Yanze be put to death, however, Shi resolved to pardon Zhang due to his past accomplishments and his connections with Yang Guangyuan. He kept Zhang in his imperial guards as a general, only demoting him one rank each in military rank and in noble title, while Zhang Shi's father, brothers, and sons were given commissions, and the people of Zhangyi who fled and returned were given tax relief. = During Shi Chonggui's reign = Shi Jingtang died later in 942, and was succeeded by his adoptive son (biological nephew) Shi Chonggui. Instead of the submissive attitude that Shi Jingtang showed toward the Khitan (whose state had been renamed Liao by this point), Shi Chonggui took a confrontational attitude, leading to a breakdown in relationship and frequent Liao incursions thereafter. Apparently at the behest of Shi Chonggui's chief of staff (Shumishi) Sang Weihan, Zhang Yanze was often sent out to defend against these incursions as a commanding general of the imperial guards in response, including in 944 and 945. It was said that in the major Later Jin victory over the Liao army commanded by Emperor Taizong himself in 945 at Yangcheng (ÈôΩÂüé, in modern Baoding, Hebei), while it was Shi Chonggui's uncle by marriage (Shi Jingtang's brother-in-law) Du Wei who commanded the army overall,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 284. none had greater contribution than Zhang, leading to the popular belief at the time that he was giving his entire strength in the effort in appreciation to Shi Jingtang's having spared him from death. By fall 945, Zhang had apparently been given a new military governorship ‚Äî that of Zhangde Circuit (ÂΩ∞Âæ∑, headquartered in modern Anyang, Henan) ‚Äî for it was by that title he was referred when he was sent to take up position at Heng Prefecture (ÊÅÜÂ∑û, in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei) to defend against a possible Liao incursion.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 285. It was said that while serving as the military governor of Zhangde, Zhang was much more respectful of the intelligentsia than he did before and governed the circuit well. While he was stationed at Heng, there were orders that the people of Xing (ÈÇ¢Â∑û, in modern Xingtai, Hebei), Wei (È≠èÂ∑û, in modern Handan, Hebei), Xiang (Áõ∏Â∑û, Zhangde's capital), and Wei (Ë°õÂ∑û, in modern Xinxiang, Henan, note different location than the other Wei Prefecture) Prefectures be responsible for delivering military supplies to the front, creating much burden for the commoners, who had to conduct this themselves. Zhang did what he could to reduce the people's burdens, by having the soldiers meet the commoners on the way, receive the supplies from them, and deliver them back to the front, and was praised for this ‚Äî which also reduced the dangers of the commoners' falling prey to raids by the Liao army or by bandits. In 946, there were rumors that the major Liao general Zhao Yanshou ‚Äî who had previously been a major Later Tang general before being captured by the Khitan in the campaign that led to Later Tang's destruction ‚Äî was planning on defecting to Later Jin. This rumor was believed by Shi's chiefs of staff Li Song and Feng Yu (the brother of Shi's wife Empress Feng). They had Du write a letter to Zhao, encouraging him to do so, with the officer Zhao Xingshi (), who had previously served under Zhao Yanshou, delivering the letter. Zhao Yanshou wrote back (to try to lead Later Jin forces into a trap), stating, \\"I have long been in a foreign land, and I want to return to China. Please launch a major army to support me, so that I can pull myself out and return with it.\\" Subsequently, under Emperor Taizong's orders, Liao's prefect of Ying Prefecture (ÁÄõÂ∑û, in modern Cangzhou), Liu Yanzuo (), also offered to defect to Later Jin. Shi thus put Du and Li Shouzhen in command of an army to attack north, with the stated objectives being to first recapture the prefectures Shi Jingtang previously ceded to Liao (the Sixteen Prefectures), and then to destroy Liao. When Du and Li Shouzhen advanced, though, they were met by a large army that Emperor Taizong personally commanded. Du and Li initially intended to withdraw quickly, but Zhang joined forces with them and argued that the Liao army could be defeated, and so they remained in the region for some time. However, the Liao army eventually surrounded the Later Jin army at Zhongdu Bridge (‰∏≠Â∫¶Ê©ã, in modern Baoding). After Emperor Taizong made the promise to Du to make him emperor if he surrendered, Du and Li surrendered their army. Zhang surrendered to Liao as part of this surrender.  After surrender to Liao  Emperor Taizong, after accepting Du Chongwei's and Li Shouzhen's surrender, took his army south, along with the now-surrendered Later Jin army, toward the Later Jin capital Daliang. He sent Zhang Yanze ahead of him to take control of Daliang, with 2,000 cavalry soldiers. As Zhang approached Daliang, he met some minimal Later Jin resistance but was able to defeat it and continue into the city. Seeing no hope of resisting, Shi Chonggui initially wanted to commit suicide, but was stopped by his officer Xue Chao (), and thereafter submitted petitions on his own behalf and that of his aunt/adoptive mother (Shi Jingtang's wife) Empress Dowager Li, surrendering to the Liao emperor. He also summoned Zhang, wanting to confer with Zhang what his appropriate response should be. Zhang declined, stating, \\"I, your subject, do not have the face to meet Your Imperial Majesty.\\" Zhang forced Sang Weihan (who was no longer Shi's chief of staff but was serving as the mayor of Kaifeng Municipality (i.e., the Daliang region)) to meet him, and after Sang rebuked him, strangled Sang to death, while reporting to Emperor Taizong (who had no intent of killing Sang) that Sang had committed suicide. He also put Shi's close associate, the director of palace affairs, Meng Chenghui (), to death. Zhang had his soldiers pillage the city of its wealth, and the poor also took the opportunity to join in the pillaging of the rich households. Many of the rich died in the disturbance. This lasted for two days, and it was said that the city was effectively stripped of its wealth, while the treasures piled up like a hill in Zhang's headquarters. Believing that he has carried out a great contribution for Emperor Taizong, he paid no careful heed to his actions, spending days and nights in drinking and entertainment. Whenever he ventured out of his headquarters, he was accompanied by several hundred cavalry soldiers bearing the banner of, \\"Faithfulness to the Lord.\\" He executed many people, often by cutting them in halves at the waist. Bearing a grudge against the official Gao Xun (), he went to Gao's mansion and killed Gao's uncle(s) and younger brother(s). Li Tao, believing that he could not escape death if he tried to flee, instead decided to go see him, submitting a note stating, \\"Li Tao, a man who had petitioned for the death of the Taiwei [(Â§™Â∞â, an honorary title that Zhang carried)], comes to now to seek his death.\\" Zhang met him happily, stating, \\"Are you fearful now, Sheren [(as Li Tao was then Zhongshu Sheren (‰∏≠Êõ∏Ëàç‰∫∫))]?\\" Li Tao responded, \\"Li Tao's fear today is the same as the fear that Your Excellency had back then. If Emperor Gaozu [(i.e., Shi Jingtang)] had accepted my words, how would this have happened?\\" Zhang laughed, and after drinking with Li Tao, released him. Zhang then forced Shi Chonggui and his family to move out of the palace to temporary living quarters at the Kaifeng Municipal Government offices and surrender all their treasure. Some of the treasures were presented to Emperor Taizong, while Zhang kept the rest himself. He also seized the mother of Shi Chonggui's adoptive son (probably a grandson of Shi Jingtang's) Shi Yanxu (), Lady Ding the Lady of Chu, apparently to be his concubine. Emperor Taizong shortly after arrived at Daliang and took control of the city. Gao Xun (who was apparently in the group of Later Jin officials who accompanied Emperor Taizong) found out about his family members' deaths, and complained about it to Emperor Taizong. Emperor Taizong was also angry that Zhang had pillaged the city, so he ordered Zhang and the interpreter Fu Zhu'er (), who had accompanied Zhang to Daliang, arrested and locked in chains. Emperor Taizong presented a list of the charges against Zhang to the officials, asking them, \\"Does this call for death?\\" They all stated in the affirmative, and at that time, the general populace also submitted many petitions accusing Zhang of crimes. Emperor Taizong thus ordered Zhang and Fu put to death by beheading, with Gao overseeing the execution. As Zhang and Fu were taken to the northern market, where they would be executed publicly, the descendants of the officials that Zhang had killed stood by on the way in mourning clothes, crying, cursing at him, and hitting him with staffs. When they reached the execution field, Gao had Zhang removed from the shackles not by removing the shackles but by cutting off his hands at the wrist. After he was beheaded, his heart was cut out of his body to be sacrificed to those whom he had killed. The people rushed in to break his skull open and to eat his flesh.

It is the first English novel written by a female writer. Background The story is dedicated to \\"Henry Pain, Esq.\\", also known as Henry Neville Payne, a Roman Catholic agitator who was later arrested and tortured for his involvement in the Montgomery Plot of 1689. In The Fair Jilt, Behn claims that the story is true and that she witnessed much of it herself. Editor Montague Summers writes in his introduction to The Works of Aphra Behn (1915) that the story is only loosely based on actual events: \\"With all the nice skill of a born novelist she has so mingled fact and fancy, what did occur and what might have been, that any attempt to disentangle the twain would be idle indeed.\\" There was in fact a Prince Francisco de Tarquini who attempted to murder his sister-in-law but was spared death in 1666 after the executioner's initial stroke failed to kill him. The London Gazette reported that the prince was only slightly wounded due to a mistake by the executioner, and was subsequently pardoned. Plot When the story opens, young Miranda is living in a convent of Begines, an order of \\"galloping nuns\\" who take only temporary vows. Her parents are dead and her younger sister, Alcidiana, lives with an uncle. The seeming unattainability of the Begines makes them more desirable to men, and Miranda is beautiful, accomplished, and wealthy. Not surprisingly, she has many admirers; she receives their gifts and attention with pleasure, while loving none of them. Then one day she meets Henrick, a handsome young prince who has taken monastic vows and changed his name to Francisco. (Miranda's maid tells her about Henrick's tragic past in a story within a story.) Miranda becomes infatuated with Henrick. When he rejects her advances, she accuses him of rape and has him thrown in prison. Soon afterwards, Miranda meets Prince Tarquin and the two marry, but Miranda's extravagant lifestyle soon sees her wealth greatly reduced. She invites her sister to move in with her and Tarquin so that she can pilfer from her sister's funds. To keep a hold over her sister, she rebuffs all of her sister's suitors until Alcidiana moves out. Miranda then sends a servant to poison Alcidiana, which he does, but Alcidiana does not die and the servant reveals Miranda's plan to the authorities. The servant is hanged, and Miranda, due to her position, is only shamed, though a great sum of money is owed to Alcidiana and Tarquin is ordered to pay it by the court. Miranda talks Tarquin into killing her sister, and so he attempts to shoot her but fails. He is caught, confesses, and is sent to be beheaded, but the executioner misses the mark and hits Tarquin's shoulder instead, causing severe injury. Tarquin is then released, and he and Miranda leave the country. In the closing lines, it is noted that Miranda eventually repents her sinful past and that Tarquin has since died, though no explanation is offered for his death. Critical reception According to Maureen Duffy, The Fair Jilt damaged Behn's reputation unjustly. Many readers found the story so hard to believe that they assumed it was fabricated, despite her insistence that it was true. Although a villainess, Behn's Miranda is not as repellent as the shockingly unhygienic Cornelia in The London Jilt. For this reason, Bonnie Blackwell credits The Fair Jilt, along with other works by female authors, with giving the word \\"jilt\\" a more positive connotation than it had in the past.

D. Matthews and Company. He also served as a director of Dominion Bank, Hamilton Steel and Iron Company Limited, Canadian Pacific Railway, Canadian General Electric Company Limited and was president of the Toronto Board of Trade. Family His paternal grandfather, Abner Matthews was a native of New Hampshire, settled in Burford before 1801 and was ordained as a Methodist Episcopal minister in 1820. Wheeler Matthews built up a business there as a miller and grain and produce dealer. In 1856, he and his family moved to Toronto, under the name W. D. Matthews and Company. Eventually known as the \\"barley king\\" of southwestern Ontario, he recognized the preference of American breweries for Canadian barley and engaged in cross- border trade, setting up regional bases in Le Roy and Attica, New York.Matthews, Wilmot Deloui from Dictionary of Canadian Biography, retrieved 24 May 2014Judith Friedland, Restoring the Spirit: The Beginnings of Occupational Therapy in Canada, 1890-1930 (McGill-Queen's Press, 2011), p. 101 Early life Wilmot Matthews was born in the Burford Township in Upper Canada. After being educated at Toronto Normal School, Matthews entered his father's business as a clerk in 1867. He married Annie Jane Love on 29 August 1872 in Toronto, and they had two sons and two daughters. In 1873, he became a partner. Career In the early 1880s his reputation in the grain trade was substantial enough that he was made president of the Toronto Corn Exchange Association, which he represented in 1883 before a parliamentary standing committee on the bill to form a court of railway commissioners in Canada. The deaths of Matthews' father in 1888 and his mother two years later left him in control of W. D. Matthews and Company. In 1895 he formed a malt dealership with Lionel Herbert Clarke (L. H.

In addition, by 1898 Matthews was a director of the Empire Produce Company and chairman of the government's eastern board for grain standards.C. H. Parmelee, Sessional Papers, Volume 24, Issue 13 (1891), p. 54. After the grain trade in Ontario went into decline he diversified by reinvesting into different sectors of the Ontario economy. His earliest interest was the Dominion Bank, of which he had become a director on 27 September 1882. He also became a director of Canadian Lloyds (a cargo company) and, in 1888, of the Canadian Pacific Railway. In 1888‚Äì89 he served as president of the Toronto Board of Trade, in which office he presided over the erection of the board's new building at Yonge and Front. By 1891, he had built a stone house at Hoskin Avenue and St George Street, which became the Newman Centre, Toronto.W.D.

As founding president of the Toronto Incandescent Electric Light Company Limited in 1889, he began working with Frederic Nicholls. He was a director of the Canadian General Electric Company Limited.Sessional Papers of the Dominion of Canada (1891), p. 54 Matthews, in partnership with Edmund Boyd Osler, owned a sizeable share of the Hamilton Steel and Iron Company Limited and worked with him at Dominion Bank. With Osler he was behind the merger of two cement mills to form the Canadian Portland company. During the recession in the Canadian cement industry in 1908, Matthews sold Canadian Portland for $1.4 million to William Maxwell Aitken, which became Canada Cement in August 1909. Legacy W. D. Matthews' house in Toronto In 1913, Henry Robert Emmerson said that Matthews, based on his presence in 18 companies, was one of the 23 \\"capitalist-directors\\" who \\"are the directive forces in practically all of Canada's economic life.\\" In 1909 Nathaniel Samuel Fineberg had stated in Moody's Magazine, from the sheer number of Matthews's directorships (17), that he was the second most influential business figure in Canada. His wife died in 1917 and two years he suffered a stroke and then died of pneumonia at his home in Toronto. He was buried in Mount Pleasant Cemetery.

Life and work  Mary Woodall was born in Chelsea, west London, into the \\"industrial aristocracy\\". Her father was Henry Woodall, director of the Gas Light and Coke Company and son of Corbet Woodall, also in the energy business. Her mother was his wife Bertha (n√©e Nettlefold), whose family wealth came from an engineering firm bearing their name. She attended Cheltenham Ladies' College and majored in history and then Somerville College, Oxford. After college she attended the Slade School of Fine Art, under Franklin White and it is there she first studied the drawings of Thomas Gainsborough. She was awarded a Ph.D. at the Courtauld Institute of Art in 1939 with a dissertation on Gainsborough's landscape drawings. During World War II Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery had seven galleries bombed. In 1942 Woodall secured a position at the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery as Keeper of Art, and under the director Trenchard Cox , who arrived in 1944, helped rebuild the damage. In 1948, she organised a pioneer exhibition of the works of Richard Wilson. In 1949 she published Thomas Gainsborough: his life and work; this book, in combination with her later related publications, remain key texts for Gainsborough scholars. In 1956 she became the museum director when Cox left. Woodall retired from the gallery in 1964 and went on to hold positions on various museum/art related boards, including the Felton Trust for the National Gallery of Victoria (Australia), University College London and a trustee of the National Gallery, London. In 1988 she died at age 87 in a nursing home in Burcot, Oxfordshire. She never married.

She is best known for her work as the coordinator of the Tuskegee syphilis experiment from 1932 to 1972. The Tuskegee Experiment was an inhumane study that deliberately allowed black men to develop syphilis when there was treatment for the disease. Early life and education Born into a farming family in rural Georgia in 1899, Eunice Verdell Rivers was the oldest of three daughters. She was born at a time and place in which race relations in the United States were at their lowest point. Originating from a poor, working-class family, Rivers was fortunate that education allowed her access to middle-class life. Her mother, who died when Rivers was just 15 years old, encouraged her to attend school from a young age. She told Rivers to ‚Äúget a good education, so [she] wouldn't have to work in the fields so hard.‚Äù Her father, also a proponent of education, encouraged her to become a nurse. He wanted all three of his daughters to have adequate schooling, working long hours at the sawmill to help finance their studies. Rivers followed her father's advice. She attended Tuskegee Institute's School of Nursing and graduated in 1922. Established in 1881 by Booker T. Washington, the Tuskegee Institute was a leading black educational institution in Alabama. After graduating from the Tuskegee School of Nursing, Rivers worked in the public health sector from 1923 until well after her retirement in 1965. Career Beginning in January 1923, Rivers worked for the Tuskegee Institute Movable School, which \\"provided adult education programs in agriculture, home economics, and health.\\" As a result of this traveling work, she became a trusted health authority for African-American farming families in the area around Tuskegee, Alabama. As part of the school, she provided various public health services to African-American men and women in rural Alabama. She supplied adult education programs in agriculture, home economics, and health. She also helped spread health education messages, such as improvements in sanitation, ventilation, and cleanliness, to rural women. She informed the public, especially women, about specific diseases, including malaria and typhoid fever. She taught them how to make bandages from old clothes, care for sickly patients, and take temperatures. For the children, she gave dental hygiene lectures and supplied tubes of Colgate toothpaste donated by the company. Further, her public health work with men concentrated on social hygiene. She informed them about the dangers of venereal disease. In her work with the Movable School, Rivers was technically an employee of the Alabama Bureau of Child Welfare. Beginning in 1926, the state transferred her to working with the Bureau of Vital Statistics, where her projects included improving birth and death registration; regulating and training midwives; and reducing infant mortality. She was instrumental in creating a system that tracked the number of births and deaths in the state of Alabama. She also helped to regulate the lay midwifery and lower infant mortality rates. As an aside, she continued to work with the Movable School, traveling around Alabama but this time focusing on pregnant women and midwives. While at the Movable School, she was constantly integrated in the community, visiting patients throughout the states‚Äô counties. In her first year, she visited over 20 counties and was noted for tending to 1,100 people during a particularly busy month. This work also involved substantial amounts of travel to interact with African Americans in rural Alabama. =Impact on race relations= Rivers lived and worked her entire adult life in Alabama. This was a state in which race was a dominant factor of southern society. As an African-American in the deep South during the era of Jim Crow laws, she was expected to accept demands by all whites, especially her supervising physicians. However, her life paints a picture of defiance against segregation. She became one of the first African-Americans to be employed by the United States Public Health System (PHS), thus paving the way for other people of color in this area of service. Rivers started working at the PHS during a time in which the U.S. was in the worst economic depression in its history. Her life's work was an example of greater opportunities for African-Americans, especially in the South. Her work ethic, care for patients, and exceptional nursing abilities earned her the respect of her white supervisors and other health professionals. During an era when she was expected to follow orders without question, she had countless letters of support praising her professional capability and excellent interpersonal skills. As an African-American nurse who played a critical role in scientific experiments and patient care, nurse Rivers helped expand the impact of these groups of people in medicine. Rivers even published an article in a respected journal about her role in the Tuskegee syphilis study. Later, she became the third annual recipient of the Oveta Culp Hobby Award, the highest award the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare could grant an employee. =Tuskegee syphilis study= Beginning in 1932, Rivers worked for the United States Public Health Service on The Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male in Macon County, Alabama, popularly known as the Tuskegee syphilis experiment. She recruited 600 African-American men with syphilis for the study and worked to keep them enrolled as participants in the program. ‚ÄúHistory of an Apology: From Tuskegee to the White House‚Äù. Research Nurse, Vol 3 No 4. In return for their participation, the study offered participants free medical care, which Rivers provided. Rivers was the experiment's only consistent full-time staff member. Although the study was initially planned to run only six months, it eventually extended to 40 years. During the entire study, the participants were not informed that the ailment they called \\"bad blood\\" was actually syphilis. When the study started, arsphenamine (Salvarsan) and Neosalvarsan were the only available treatments for syphilis, and both compounds had dangerous side effects. However, even after the 1940s when the discovery of penicillin offered a reliable and safe cure for the disease, study participants still did not receive treatment for syphilis. After the New York Times and Washington Post revealed that study participants had been allowed to suffer rather than receiving a known safe treatment, the Public Health Service ended it in 1972. Historians have offered a variety of interpretations for why Rivers continued her role in a project that, by modern standards of medical ethics, was completely unethical. Public perception Once the news of the unethical treatment of participants in the Tuskegee Study was exposed in 1972, Rivers retreated into silence. Some see her primarily as a dedicated nurse, willing to follow any orders to keep treating her patients. Others see her as a race traitor who used her education and class power to keep her job and sell out the rural men she was caring for. There is evidence for both narratives. Just as she was crucial in recruiting and keeping participants in the study, she also provided them with both medical and mental care they otherwise would not have received. She listened to their complaints, suggested ways to gain assistance outside of the hospital, offered them comfort, and provided simple medication, such as vitamins. She helped establish the ‚ÄúMiss Rivers Lodge,‚Äù which provided the men's families financial assistance for burials in exchange for the men's participation in the study. Her actions provided the men with more treatment opportunities for other conditions than they had previously received from health professionals. In 1977, Rivers was interviewed for the Black Women Oral History Project. She died in 1986.

He retired from office in 1971 after one term and was succeeded by then-San Jose Vice Mayor Norm Mineta. In 1970, Mayor James submitted a letter addressed to a future mayor, which was placed in a time capsule buried at San Jose's former main library on West San Carlos Street on May 14, 1970. Other artifacts included with James's letter included a copy of the San Jose city charter, a city council agenda from 1969, newspaper clippings, and a taped radio interview with city librarian Geraldine Nurney, which was recorded at the library's dedication in April 1970. James had been told that the time capsule would remain buried for about 100 years, so he assumed he wouldn't live to see it reopened. However, the old main library was demolished in 2011, which allowed for the capsule's recovery. The time capsule was opened in September 2013 and James's letter was reprinted in its entirety in the San Jose Mercury News. James remarked at the ceremony, \\"They told me it was going to be opened in 100 years or longer...I was pleasantly surprised that the Mercury News printed the letter verbatim so people could read it.

Ashura, which is celebrated on the tenth day of Muharram across the Muslim world, and is particularly significant for Shia Muslims, for whom it is a day of mourning. Moroccans, however, embrace this day with cheerful remembrance of those who have died. It is a custom to pay visit to cemetery pray for the departed ones. In Morocco, where the Muslim population is Sunni, the local customs associated with Ashura vary across the country. But traditionally, people exchange mixes of nuts mainly walnuts and almonds, and the popular dates. Nowadays, an eclectic variety of Moroccan pastries is added to the mix. Additionally, children are given toys and this is the best time - a week prior to Ashura- to purchase Moroccan traditional musical instruments mainly; ta√¢rija drum, Derbouka, Triir and drum tambourines. The night before children play with fireworks in the streets and light bonfire called ≈°a ø øƒÅla (). Traditionally females play with vigour the instruments around this fire reciting traditional Ashura folklore songs. Females then continue to play and sing taking their joy - Nashat- to other neighbours who then join the crowd of players. Marrakech is well known for its Daqqa Marrakshiya performed by men. With the modernisation expansion of cities this custom is becoming more and more rare and can only be seen is some traditional neighbourhoods and small villages. Shia sources allege that these customs may be a legacy of the Umayyad rule who sought to time such occasions of popular public display of joy‚Äîoften pre-existing in local cultures‚Äîwith the Ashura day in order to humiliate and counter the mourning of their enemies, the supporters of Ali (Shi'a). The latter see this day as a great catastrophe since it was the day of the death of Hussein and the slaughtering of his family at the battle of Karbala. However, today in Morocco, the event is not at all associated with the Shia-Sunni conflict and has little religious significance and is seen as merely a folk tradition. The Light of Baba Ayshur In some regions of Morocco, the right of ur is an activity for children during the festival of Ashura, wherein children wander from one house to another asking for candy and dried fruits or even money and asking the question \\"the right of Baba Aichore?\\" of anyone who answers the door. This tradition has become famous recently when it has been considered as a substitute for fireworks which usually lead to a range of accidents. City customs In some cities, Moroccans call the tenth day of Muharram, Zamzam day. On this day, they spray water on each other. Whoever wakes up first sprays the rest with cold water, and gets many children and young people out (especially in the popular neighbourhoods) into the streets to spray passersby with of water. Over the course of the first hours of the morning there are fierce \\"water battles,\\" especially among friends and neighbors. Whoever refuses to celebrate with \\"Zamzam water,\\" by sprinkling a little of it on his clothes, may be exposed to a number of volunteers taking turns dumping all of their water on his clothes. Then the day is capped off with a meal of \\"Moroccan couscous\\" with dried meat saved especially for this day from the sacrifice of Eid al-Adha.

His father, Joseph Rosenthal, was a lover of old books and odd bric-a-brac. Rosenthal apprenticed in Ellwangen, Baden- W√ºrttemberg before opening his business in Fellheim. In 1868, he moved to Munich and established himself at 16 Hildegardstrasse, almost immediately behind the Bavarian National Museum. Biography Birthplace of Rosenthal's mother, Dorlene Bacharach, in Fellheim Rosenthal was the eldest son of the market trader Joseph Rosenthal, who ran an art and antiques shop in Fellheim. His mother Dorlene, n√©e Bacharach, was born into a Jewish family of butchers from Fellheim. Rosenthal's three siblings were Jette, Nathan and Jacob, who later, changed his name to Jacques. He grew up in the town's Jewish community and attended the Jewish-Christian school. At the age of thirteen, he transferred to the Buxheim Charterhouse. After training as a bookseller with Isaak Hess in Ellwangen, Rosenthal opened his own art and antiques trade in 1859 in Fellheim. Jacques Rosenthal In 1867, the Rosenthal family moved to Munich where Rosenthal and his brother Jacob (Jacques) founded \\"Rosenthal Antiquarian\\". In the holdings, there was a map of the circumnavigation of Magellan from the year 1523. Rosenthal acquired books from various libraries, including the library of St. Vitus' Abbey on the Rott, the city library of Leutkirch im Allg√§u, the library of the family Hoermann of Gutenberg, the library of the Jesuit College at Landsberg am Lech, the library of Karl Maria von Aretin, parts of the library of Buxheim Charterhouse, and the library of the Lobris manor in Silesia. Around the turn of the century, Rosenthal's Antiquariat contained more than a million books, and was larger than the Bavarian State Library. In 1905, he appointed his three sons Adolf, Heinrich and Norbert Rosenthal as his partners. Rosenthal died in 1928. During the Nazi period, part of family was able to migrate to the United States. Sons and daughters of the Rosenthal family operate the family's antique book and music business in the Netherlands (which specializes in Incunabula, early printed books, Hebraica, Humanism, illustrated books, and prints), the United Kingdom, and in the United States.

History  The first church was built in 1595 by Franciscan missionaries who established a parish at the town's old site in what is now Boso-Boso in Antipolo, with St. James as its patron. The town and its church was transferred in 1636 to a site called Ibayo to escape the hostilities of the Aeta inhabitants in the area who burned the town and the church in 1635. The second site was located one and one-half leagues (about 7.24 kilometers) southeast of the first site. The church was dedicated to Christ the Savior but it also was affected by hostilities, this time when Chinese rebels in 1639 burned the church as well as other churches in neighboring towns. The town was moved to its present site in 1682. On the same year, construction began on the present church. It was completed in 1686, with the church now dedicated to St. Joseph as its patron. Renovations to the structure have been done in the 1960s and 2000s.  Architecture  Built in a mixture of fortress-style and barn-style Baroque architecture, the church is notable for its dark, simple, and sparse qualities that are typical of Franciscan mission churches built during the 16th century. Its simple facade is given a decorative touch mainly through the stream of balustrade trimming its triangular pediment, as well as the chequerboard pattern of brick and stone on the pediment‚Äôs upper portion, which indicates an addition to the original and much lower stone pediment. The interiors revealed the exposed wooden trusses that support the church's roofing, lacking a ceiling that is usually seen in churches. The structure has not been plastered, exposing the adobe bricks on which the church was made.  Church Dedication  The Solem dedication and Consecration of the Altar was solemnly officiated by Most Rev. Nolly C. Buco, JCD. DD., Auxiliary Bishop of Antipolo on November 9, 2020 during the pontificate of Pope Francis, incumbency of Most Rev. Francisco M. de Leon, DD., Bishop of Antipolo and Rev. Fr. Rodney B.

Assisted by Jack Macnamara, a Jesuit seminarian, and twelve white college students based at Presentation Roman Catholic Church, led by Msgr. Jack Egan, the CBL fought the discriminatory real estate practice known as ‚Äúcontract selling.‚Äù  History  Following World War II, Chicago‚Äôs South Side had become increasingly overcrowded as African Americans moved from the South in the second wave of the Great Migration. Unable to attain decent and sanitary housing in white neighborhoods because of racially restrictive real estate covenants and mortgage redlining by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), African Americans were confined to the South Side ghetto. They finally began to move into new neighborhoods. In the 1950s-60s, real estate speculators exploited white homeowners‚Äô fears on the West Side of plummeting real estate values because of neighborhoods that had ethnic change. Realtors went door-to- door to persuade white homeowners to sell because blacks were moving into the neighborhood. In neighborhoods they wished to exploit, ‚Äúpanic-peddling‚Äù speculators hired black men to drive beat-up cars with the music blaring and paid black women to push their babies in strollers. Speculators made enormous profits by convincing whites to sell their homes at well-below market value and then reselling to blacks at much higher than market value. Black homebuyers were subject to a ‚Äúrace tax,‚Äù as a property would typically be bought from a white homeowner for $10,000 and resold a week later to a black family for $25,000. The FHA‚Äôs refusal to lend to blacks meant that they could not buy overpriced homes except on contract, but the title to a property bought on contract would not be transferred to the buyer until all contract payments had been made. Trapped in overwhelming debt, contract buyers were charged exorbitant fees for repairs to correct building code violations, which speculators had concealed from them. In order to afford payments, contract buyers were forced to work two or three jobs, separating them from their families. Buyers who missed a single payment would be evicted with no right to recoup prior payments. Speculators would then resell the property to another black household under the same terms. The process of ‚Äúblockbusting‚Äù was a national phenomenon. But, the practice of contract selling reached its peak in North Lawndale, where an estimated 3,000 buildings were sold on contract. This contributed to the neighborhood‚Äôs population changing from 87% white in 1950 to 91% black in 1960.  Other entities  Groups similar to the CBL formed in cities around the country to combat contract selling. The CBL was the most influential in winning justice for exploited black homebuyers. The CBL renegotiated 400 contracts for its members, saving residents an estimated $25,000,000. The FHA finally responded to pressure from the CBL by reforming its discriminatory underwriting policies in order to lend to blacks.

History  The first church was built as a mission church by the Franciscan missionaries in 1669. Originally, it served the Dumagat people of Lanatin and Linotan in the mountains of modern-day Rizal province. The Jesuits eventually took over the mission and the church in 1741.See the \\"2018 Historical Marker\\" below. It was turned over to the seculars in 1768 when the Jesuits were expelled from the Philippines. In 1880, an earthquake caused significant damage to the church. Owing to the dwindling population in the area, the damaged portions of the church were not rebuilt. In 1930, the Americans planned to build a dam in the surrounding area, thus, the remaining inhabitants were ordered to resettle elsewhere. The dam project was eventually abandoned due to a discovered fault, yet the people did not return until the time of the Japanese occupation. Even then, whatever that was left of the church was subsequently burned down by the Japanese, leaving only the lower portion of the original church facade intact. As the area was eventually resettled, administration of the parish was taken over by the Camillian order in 1986 who helped organize the restoration of the church. Restoration was completed in 1995, preserving the original remaining fa√ßade of the old church with the rebuilt portions built as close as possible to the simple, sparse architecture of the old structure.

Their mission, as stated by the Western Council, is to defeat the evil Uukrul, a dark magician of incredible power, who ages ago overthrew the Ancients of the city, and claimed all of its passages and caverns as his dominion. Now Eriosth√© is plagued by monsters and the minions of Uukrul. Fearing Uukrul will attack the western lands, 18 months back the Council sent a party lead by one Mara, but without news a new party must be assembled. However, there's a way to achieve this seemingly impossible task. To reach the greatest possible powers, Uukrul detached his soul from his body, and stored his heart of dark stone somewhere within the furthest reaches of the maze-like passages of Eriosth√©. Access to the heart is in turn opened by several other hearts, which must be found behind battles with fierce enemies, hidden at secret places, or guarded by inscrutable riddles. Gameplay The four adventurers are each of a different class: a fighter, a magician, a priest and a paladin. Each one has unique characteristics. The fighter and paladin are capable of wearing and using the heaviest gear and weapons, and dealing the highest physical damage. The paladin can also lay hands over a foe to do damage, or over a friend or the whole party to heal. The magician uses wits to deliver spells from five disciplines for different effects: damaging, healing, discovering secret doors, translating unknown texts, etc. Finally, the priest send prayers to four different gods, and each prayer should have a certain effect, some similar to the magician's spells, and others unique to the priest. But the gods are whimsical or can be angered, so often prayers aren't answered, and sometimes the god smites back the priest for disturbing their godly rest. At the game's start, certain characteristics of each party member are decided through a series of questions which can, for example, create an agile warrior capable of dodging enemy's attacks at the cost of lesser damage dealt, or a bulky warrior not so able to evade or parry attacks but dealing much more damage in each successful hit. The exploration system is in first-person perspective, with a simple 3D effect. One important feature of the game is its auto-map: when viewing the map, squares already explored are marked as such. Therefore, there is no need to use a paper and pencil to draw the map, although in certain areas there's a fog preventing viewing the map at all. The city itself is divided in zones, and to move from one zone to the next, the party must pass through sanctuaries. The sanctuaries are the only place where the game can be saved, and has also a cache to save items, the party can rest and recover health points, etc. The first time the party enters any given sanctuary, all wounds and illnesses are cured. Visiting a sanctuary when a character has enough experience points also makes that character advance a level up to the maximum level of 15. Entering the sanctuary requires using one of four soul amulets which came printed with the game. These copy-protection printouts are used to decode the secret word to open the door to the sanctuary. Many runes and scriptures found in the walls of the city are also written with the same glyphs. Entering a sanctuary only requires the secret word the first time, afterwards it can be entered freely. Sanctuaries also have teleports to other sanctuaries and special places. The zone past the sanctuary Urlasar has most of the remaining inhabited Eriosth√©, such as shops, the temple, the mausoleum, the guild, the shrines and somewhat deeper the circle of magicians. One thing to take care of is that the party needs supplies to keep exploring. If food depletes, the party will start to lose health points and even die eventually. At the shrines and the circle of magicians, the priest and magician can acquire new rings if their level is high enough, in the case of the priest to have more chances to pray successfully, and in the case of the magician to access higher level spells. In case a party member dies, the body can be brought to the temple and resurrection can be attempted. In case it fails, a new member for the party can be found and chosen between several candidates at the guild. During the exploration, packs of monsters can attack randomly, mostly in open areas. Certain places trigger the attack of specific foes too, and the deeper in Eriosth√© the party goes, the harder the monsters are. The battles themselves are turn based, first with a movement phase and then with an attack phase. Everything is done on an overhead view, where small square icons represent the party members and the foes. Besides moving and attacking, the priest can pray, the magician can launch spells, and other actions like retreat can be triggered. Exploring the caverns and mazes requires more than just good gear. There are clues about where to find hidden doors, the key to advancing the story, but some doors are impenetrable to magic or prayers, and riddles and puzzles must be solved to open them - mechanically or through a secret word. Production The game was created by Ian Boswell and Martin Buis while they were studying as a pet project over the course of several years. Once Broderbund agreed to publish the game, they needed another year to complete it, all on a very limited budget. The game was noted for its primitive graphics even for 1989 . On DOS, it supported CGA, EGA and VGA graphics. The game has neither music nor sound in both Apple II and DOS platforms. Reception The Dark Heart of Uukrul was unsuccessful, selling fewer than 5,000 copies despite good reviews. According to Boswell, Broderbund‚Äînot known for computer RPGs‚Äîdid not market or advertise the game, launched at the end of the Apple II's life. Computer Gaming Worlds Scorpia in 1993 called Uukrul \\"a standard dungeon-delving expedition with some interesting points, not least of which is the best auto-mapping in any game to date\\". She approved of the balanced combat and unusual ending, but warned that the puzzles made the game \\"not for those seeking only hack-and-slash entertainment\\". Crooked Bee from RPG Codex praised Uukrul for the different challenges the player faces while progressing through the game, and for \\"some of the best dungeon, puzzle and character development design in the history of the genre\\". She also liked the balance between elements, and its clever design.

It is the most widespread variant in Russia and in the former USSR. Nearly all Russian garmons made since the mid of the 20th century are khromkas.  History  Since 1830s when first Russian diatonic accordions (named garmonika, garmon or garmoshka after ) began being produced in Tula many regional variations appeared. One of them were one-row accordions from Vyatka (called severyanka from sever \\"North\\") and from Livny (called livenka). Their important feature was that it was unisonoric (the same note is produced on pressing and drawing the bellows), while all other European types including Russian ones were bisonoric (two notes are produced on pressing and drawing the bellows). From those types under the probable influence of two-row bisonoric German accordions the first khromkas were made in 1890s. At first they were one of many types and were competing with other traditional variants (of Vyatka, Saratov, Livny, Yelets and many others). But everything has changed since the October Revolution. The new Soviet government began to follow a policy of \\"cultural education of masses\\". Garmon, as one of the most widespread folk instrument, was recognized as the most important and useful medium of this policy. In 1920s the special government commission took several researches and finally decided that all handicraftsmen had to unite into centralized cooperative factories (artels) and must produce only three types of button accordions: khromka, bayan (chromatic button accordion) and the Russian modification of a German bisonoric diatonic accordion (this Russian type also became obsolete by 1950s). The main reasons of the choice of khromka were: unisonoric, simplicity and at the same time great musical potential. This unification and centralisation allowed mass production of garmons. Only in two factories of Moscow and Leningrad production of garmons grew from 15,000 in 1930 to 100,000 in 1932. 1959 was the record year when nearly half a million khromkas were made in the USSR. But since 1960 their production became falling in the favour of chromatic bayans which then seemed to be preferable than diatonic khromkas. Since the fall of the USSR and the economic collapse of the country most factories have become bankrupt. Today only two factories still exist in Tula and Shuya, producing just several thousand khromkas a year.  Constructions  In general khromkas are very similar to Western diatonic accordions but in many ways they differ greatly, being more close to bayans. On the right side there are 25 buttons in two rows. Each button produces only one note either on pressing or drawing the bellows, hence khromkas are unique amongst diatonic accordions. Khromkas can be set with one to five voices (reeds) per note, but usual are of two or three, in total 25, 50, 75, 100 or 125 reeds. The right keyboard layout in C major The layout is also unique. The outer row buttons correspond to the notes on the staff line while the inner row buttons - to the note between the lines. The three top buttons, one of the inner row and two of the outer row, are accidentals (G#, D#, F#). In professional models with 27 buttons two additional bottom buttons are C# and A#. The buttons 3-25 are notes of a diatonic scale arranged in a zigzag way (like bayan). Garmon Left Hand Solf√®ge The left side differs even more. It has 25 unisonoric buttons in three rows. The outer rows are chords and basses, arranged by turns, while the inner row is bass duplicates. This systems is a mix between the unisonoric Stradella system and bisonoric bass systems of Western diatonic accordions. Some variations exist depending on goals. Expensive professional khromkas can have up to five voices, cassotto, register switches on both the right and left sides and 2 additional treble buttons (like said above). Cheap, child or souvenir models can have only one or two voices, and reduced number of the buttons (15, 19 or 23 in the right and 12 in the left).  Tuning  Like Western diatonic accordions khromka can be tuned differently. The tuning is identified by the third outer button, which produces the tonic. The default tuning is C major. All scores for khromka are written for garmons in C major. All 12 tunings are possible but most widespread keys are D, G, and A major. All khromkas are played if they were in C Major in spite of their real sound. This makes khromka theoretically a transposing instrument. A musician (garmonist) uses the same fingering for any tuning.

Jeong debuted as a writer in 1987 with the short story \\"Our Winter.\\" He has written collections such as Chinguneun meolli gatsseodo (ÏπúÍµ¨Îäî Î©ÄÎ¶¨ Í∞îÏñ¥ÎèÑ Even though my friend went far), Spring at Silsangsa Temple (Ïã§ÏÉÅÏÇ¨), Moransijang yeoja (Î™®ÎûÄÏãúÏû• Ïó¨Ïûê The Woman at the Moran Market), and Brier Rose (Ï∞îÎ†àÍΩÉ). He has also written the novels Faint Hope (ÎàÑÎßù), Nakta (ÎÇôÌÉÄ The Camel), Eunhaengnamu sonyeon (ÏùÄÌñâÎÇòÎ¨¥ ÏÜåÎÖÑ The Ginkgo Tree Boy), as well as the children‚Äôs novel Dolgorae pachino (ÎèåÍ≥†Îûò ÌååÏπòÎÖ∏ Pachino the Dolphin). Jeong won the 17th Danjae Literary Award for Faint Hope, the 25th Yosan Literary Prize for Brier Rose, and the 7th Beautiful Writer‚Äôs Award. Life Jeong Do-sang was born on January 3, 1960 in Macheon- myeon, Hamyang-gun, Gyeongsanngnam-do, South Korea. His father died when he was six. He moved to Seoul in 1971 and pursued studies while he worked various jobs such as a street peddler selling chewing gum, a newspaper boy, and taking on manual labor. He enrolled at the Department of German Language and Literature at Chungbuk National University in 1981. Jeong was imprisoned for his role in the Protest Against the Construction of the Peace Dam in 1986. In 1987, while serving his sentence in Jeonju Prison, he decided to begin writing. When he was released from prison, he worked at apartment construction sites while writing. Jeong won the Chonnam National University‚Äôs May Literature Award for his short story Our Winter (Ïö∞Î¶¨Îì§Ïùò Í≤®Ïö∏). Afterwards, he actively pursued his career as a writer. In 2005, Jeong's fifteen-year-old son committed suicide. His son's suicide gave Jeong Do-sang great shock, and caused a literary change within him. These experiences were presumably deeply related to his later constant interest in the youth problem as well as his publication of young adult novels and children's books. Writing As a Realist writer, Jeong lays out themes based on life experiences in his writing. His early works have realistic insights into how the state uses its great authority to destroy the lives of individuals. Particularly, in Chinguneun meolli gatsseodo (ÏπúÍµ¨Îäî Î©ÄÎ¶¨ Í∞îÏñ¥ÎèÑ Even though my friend went far), he portrays how a soldier that accidentally kills a superior officer becomes involved in a fabricated defection to North Korea, as well as a reforestation project. Jeong also realistically portrays violence within the military, making it an early representative work that widely spread his name among readers. In terms of works after the 2000s, Jeong focused his literary interest on nomadism and the problem of refugees. Brier Rose (Ï∞îÎ†àÍΩÉ), a serialized novel, is about North Korean defectors and their journey, telling the process of escape and settlement. It realistically portrays the issue of division concerning South Korean society. In the 2010 novel Nakta (ÎÇôÌÉÄ The Camel), Jeong portrays the inner side of a protagonist. The protagonist faces inner loneliness via a journey through the Gobi Desert with his son, who passed away with only a short note. Nakta (ÎÇôÌÉÄ The Camel) portrays how such scars of the protagonist are healed through friendships made with many people he meets during his travel.

The name \\"Gabaldon schools\\" derives from a former Nueva Ecija congressman, Isauro Gabaldon, who introduced a law in 1907 that appropriated funds for the construction of school buildings nationwide. When the Americans arrived in the 19th century, one of their primary goals was the establishment of the education system in the Philippines, and they created the Department of Education in order to accomplish this goal. The American colonists utilised the institution of the educational system in order to teach the Filipinos how to speak English, making the transmission of American values easier. This was also done under the auspices of preparing the Philippines, then just emerging from the aftermath of World War II, for independence. One of the first delegations of American educators who rose to prominence in the Philippines arrived on a ship called the \\"Thomas,\\" which is the reason that the American teachers became known as the Thomasites. History =Context of Gabaldon Schools in the Philippines= The Americans decided that more public schools must be provided in order to facilitate the institutional education of the Filipinos. There were already an existing 534 schools constructed by the Spaniards, and the Americans added 1000 more schools, a number that steadily grew in the first 10 years of American occupation. The adopted three kinds of school buildings: the barrio school, the municipal school, and high school buildings. Starting 1900s, they built sturdier schoolhouses that later became known as American Colonial Schools. American architect William E. Parsons was commissioned to develop prototype designs for the schoolhouses for both elementary and high school. There were twenty prototypes made that varied from one classroom to more than ten classrooms. In 1907, Assemblyman Isauro Gabaldon allotted a budget of one million pesos (sixty thousand dollars) for the construction of these prototypes all over the Philippines. These schools were later known as \\"Gabaldon Schools\\". Description =Site= With the growth of population in Las Pi√±as, the demand for education also began rising. Starting out from a single Gabaldon school, the movement led to the construction of several buildings and facilities within the complex. The site includes multi-storey classroom buildings, a Health Education building, a motorpool, guard houses, service areas, and additional offices, as well as a track oval and a multi-purpose hall. =Architectural characteristics= Capiz Windows with Grills Reminiscent of the early years of the American occupation, Las Pi√±as Elementary School's Gabaldon Hall is one of the survivors of the city's rapid urbanisation. The Las Pi√±as Gabaldon Hall reflects a Neo Classical Revival Style. This is observable in its U-shaped configuration, the series of concrete columns in the middle section, and the utilization of standardized G.I roofing. It belongs to one of the construction systems employed in Gabaldon Schools - the reinforced concrete built-in wall system. It has a medium aesthetic value; and medium state of originality. It also features high ceilings, and windows made of capiz shells. The roof reflects Dutch gable roof design - similar to other types of Gabaldon schools. The windows are in sliding-type style, and the transom supplements ample lighting into the interior. At present, the sliding-type mechanism of the windows and series of transoms are not functional. The windows were made fixed and enclosed with wrought iron grill works while the transoms (including wood framing and capiz shells) were painted along with the walls of the hall. Present situation =Existing building conditions= Las Pi√±as Gabaldon Front Facade The Las Pi√±as Gabaldon Hall integrated full air-conditioning system to cater according to its new use as an office building. Also, the gap between the concrete foundations and the natural ground line were utilized into plant boxes. The aluminum lettering of \\"DIVISION OF CITY SCHOOLS LAS PINAS CITY\\" were added at the front facade. Also, green polycarbonate curved roofing were installed within the two entrances of the hall to provide shading. The exposed pipe systems are still present and functioning. The G.I roofing and gutters have been changed. The eaves, as well as the walls, received general painting works for aesthetic and functional improvement. The original extension walls were made out of wood and replaced with concrete at some time. Other replacements include fixed jalousies on the sides of the hall, new ceilings, fixed cement partitions (collapsible wooden partitions before), and clay and wood tiles. =Division of City Schools Las Pi√±as City= The Division of City Schools, Las Pi√±as City was established as one of the thirteen divisions of DECS ‚Äì National Capital Region.

Biography Holmes was born in 1838 in Noel, Nova Scotia, Canada, and moved to Massachusetts with her family in 1848. Her father, James Archibald, was an abolitionist, while her mother Julia was a strong supporter of women's suffrage. The Archibald family relocated again in 1854 to Lawrence, Kansas, to assist in the abolitionist efforts sparked by the Kansas‚ÄìNebraska Act (see Bleeding Kansas); their Kansas home served as part of the Underground Railroad. In 1857, she married James H. Holmes, an abolitionist whom she had met through her father's friend John Brown. Julia and James Holmes traveled to the Rocky Mountains in Colorado in 1858 with a group of gold miners. When the party arrived at the foot of Pikes Peak, the Holmeses decided to attempt to climb the mountain with J. D. Miller and George Peck. They reached the summit on August 5, 1858, making Julia Holmes the first woman to have climbed Pikes Peak. From the summit, she wrote in a letter to her mother: \\"Nearly everyone tried to discourage me from attempting it, but I believed that I should succeed; and now here I am, and I feel that I would not have missed this glorious sight for anything at all.\\" After climbing Pikes Peak, Holmes and her husband moved to Taos, New Mexico, where she worked as a correspondent for the New York Herald Tribune. She had four children before divorcing her husband in 1870 and relocating to Washington, D.C., where she worked in the Spanish Correspondence Division of the Bureau of Education, the first woman member, eventually advancing to the division chief. Holmes was heavily involved in the women's suffrage movement in the 1860s and 1870s. She was a secretary for the National Woman Suffrage Association and spoke at the first National Woman Suffrage Association convention in 1869. She was involved in setting up associations for the movement in Washington, D.C. and, to aid the suffrage campaign, she attempted to register to vote in 1871. She was a friend of Susan B. Anthony.

Career =Club= Born in Glasgow, McMenemy played as an Inside-right. He began his career with local Junior club St Roch's before signing for Celtic in 1925, aged 17. He remained a squad player during his three seasons with the club, making 15 league appearances. He played only one match in the Scottish Cup: the final of the 1926‚Äì27 edition, which his team won with a 3‚Äì1 victory over East Fife. In 1928, McMenemy moved to fellow top-tier club Motherwell where he became an important member of the side in the most prominent period of their history under manager 'Sailor' Hunter. They finished third in the league in 1929 (albeit a huge margin behind Rangers), narrowed the gap to five points as runners-up in 1930, and to four in third place in 1931. In the 1931 Scottish Cup McMenemy played in another final, but Motherwell lost to his former club Celtic in a replay, having conceded a last-minute equaliser in the first match at Hampden Park despite leading by two goals (one by McMenemy). The following season, 1931‚Äì32, saw Motherwell become league champions for the first and only time. In 1932‚Äì33 the Steelmen came close to success again, but finished second in the league and once more were defeated by Celtic in the Scottish Cup Final. They finished just behind champions Rangers and reached the Scottish Cup semi-finals in 1934, but had now peaked as a group, dropping down to seventh place the next season. It is also worth noting that McMenemy's primary role was as a creator, and that the Motherwell centre forward Willie MacFadyen scored a huge number of league goals (194, including 52 in the title-winning campaign) during five consecutive seasons they played alongside one another. in 1936 McMenemy, now aged 28, departed from Fir Park, signing for Partick Thistle for a fee of ¬£1,000. In January 1938 he moved again within the Greater Glasgow area to play with St Mirren, being released in May 1939 after making 11 appearances for the Paisley club. =International= McMenemy received one cap for Scotland (replacing his brother who had pulled out of the squad due to injury),The Brothers McMenemy, The Glasgow Herald, 28 September 1933 a 3‚Äì2 loss to Wales in Cardiff. He also appeared three times for the Scottish League XI, all during his spell with Motherwell. Personal life John was the son of Celtic player Jimmy (winner of the Scottish Football League championship and the Scottish Cup several times each, the last in 1921) and the elder brother of Harry (winner of the FA Cup with Newcastle United in 1932) who both also played in the inside forward position. Another brother, Joe, featured for Strathclyde Juniors in the 1930s. They are distantly related to Lawrie McMenemy.

It later opened its doors to Filipino members to foster Spanish-Filipino ties in the country. The club is located at 855 Teodoro M. Kalaw Avenue, Ermita, Manila. History =Spanish period= Earlier records show that Governor General Narciso Claveria y Zaldua formalized the foundation of the casino in Manila on October 31, 1844, the date which is celebrated by the casino as the year of its founding. =American colonial period= Aerial view of the Casino Espa√±ol de Manila (1930) The first building of the Casino Espa√±ol de Manila was built in 1913 but formally opened in 1917. It was designed by architect Juan Arellano, incorporating influences of neo-renaissance style. The structure used to occupy the whole block from Taft Avenue to San Marcelino St. and housed the offices of the Spanish Chamber of Commerce and the Consulate General of Spain. As the official clubhouse and social venue of the Spanish community, the building‚Äôs reception and banquet halls hosted parties, celebrations and balls. Among the noted events in this venue in the 1930s was the extravagant party held to celebrate the birthday of the King of Spain. Apart from attending parties in its halls, guests could also view the garden from the terrace while members could play tennis and pelota games in its courts. In 1945, the structure was destroyed in World War II during the Liberation of Manila. The club was temporarily moved to a two-story house along Apacible St. (formerly Oregon) and Perez St. in Paco, Manila. =Post-War period= Main lobby that leads to the inner courtyard. In 1951, Casino Espa√±ol de Manila was rebuilt on its original site through the help of Ignacio Planas. Parts of the property were sold and the new structure was built facing San Luis St. (now T.M. Kalaw St.). The new clubhouse was designed by architect Jos√© Mar√≠a Zaragoza using the prevalent post-World War II ‚ÄúFilipino-California-Spanish style‚Äù. The structure has arched verandas surrounding an inner courtyard. The new Casino Espa√±ol de Manila was inaugurated on November 3, 1951 with President Elpidio Quirino and Vice-President Fernando Lopez in attendance. In 1962, it played host to King Juan Carlos de Borbon, who was then the Crown Prince at that time, and Queen Sofia. The Queen returned to the club in year 2000 during an official visit to the Philippines. =Present-day club= Arched terraces surrounding the courtyard. While Casino Espa√±ol de Manila caters to its members only, it now welcomes guests and visitors to its compound. The club holds events in its open-air Patio de Orquidias. It has a restaurant that offers Spanish food in its menu. At the back, it has a fronton that is used for jai alai and pelota games. Right beside the casino is the former site of the Instituto Cervantes Manila where Spanish classes were held, promoting the Spanish culture in the Philippines. Football The club has organized a football team. Casino Espa√±ol fielded a team at the 1935 Philippines Football Championship.

The centre was launched by His Majesty Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah Mu'izzadin Waddaulah, the Sultan and Yang Di-Pertuan of Brunei Darussalam, on October 15, 2011. IBM Research Labs in India, New York, USA (Watson), Australia, and Brazil are participating in this joint research.http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/32755.wsshttp://www.bt.com.bn/news- national/2012/08/16/ibm-keen-work-brunei-high- technologieshttp://indiaeducationdiary.in/showebn.asp?newsid=23490http://www.bt.com.bn/news- national/2010/09/01/ubd-partners-ibm-set-upresearch-centre Research Facilities One of the major research facilities at the centre is the IBM Blue Gene/P Supercomputer. Blue Gene/P has a massively parallel architecture consisting of 1024 independent units of microprocessors that are connected together to form a very high computational capacity. The computational power of Blue Gene/P is being utilized for high resolution weather forecasting which can predict the weather 48 hours ahead at a high resolution of 1.5 km x 1.5 km. These weather forecasts are further used for various applications like analyzing the effects of climate change, flood forecasting, solar and wind power forecasts and agro-technologies like mobile applications for rice farmers. Research Projects Currently, The Centre focuses its research on Regional Climate and Weather Modelling, Energy Efficiency, Renewable Energy, Agro-technology and Hydrology using high performance computing facilities which are installed at UBD, thus moving forward with its mission \\"Innovating for Sustainable Earth\\".http://www.research.ibm.com/articles/brunei.shtmlhttp://www.infotech.monash.edu.au/seminars/2013/introduction- ibm-research.htmlhttp://www.brusearch.com/news/117840 Energy is one of the major research focuses of the UBDIBM Centre. A number of research projects in this area are being undertaken by the Centre during past 2 years.http://www.thesmetimes.com/index.php/extras/latest-news/627-universiti- brunei-darussalam-and-ibm-drive-smarter-energy-research- initiatives.htmlhttp://www.bt.com.bn/news-national/2011/10/16/ubd-ibm-centre- can-turn-brunei-energy-management- experthttp://www.theborneopost.com/2013/06/26/ubd-ibm-drive-smarter-energy- research-initiatives/ An example is the project on developing a system to model and forecast the performance of solar photovoltaic modules under varying weather conditions. Such studies, apart from giving insights to the design requirements of grid integrated and roof top solar PV systems, would also help in strategising optimal integration and dispatch of solar electricity to the electricity grids. Another project under energy aims at improving the stability and reliability of the power distribution systems.http://www.ubd.edu.bn/news-and-events/highlights-archive/power-system- modelling-research/ This addresses the ‚Äòpower swing‚Äô phenomena, which is basically the fluctuations and oscillations in the electrical parameters resulting in disturbances in the power systems. An innovative techniques for early detection of power swing in the network is being developed, which helps in taking preventive measures for the protection of electrical components such as generators and transformers. Under the energy efficiency research, the power consumption pattern in residential buildings is being analyzed by a three level power monitoring system. The system monitors the energy usage at regional, house and appliance levels using advances sensor technologies and analytics.http://news.asiaone.com/News/Latest+News/Science+and+Tech/Story/A1Story20111127-312909.htmlhttp://202.93.211.141/current- projects.html By these technologies, the homes can be made grid 'friendly' by balancing the load and improving the efficiency of energy consumption. Possibilities of using renewable energy from photo-voltaic sources are also investigated in this project. The study can further be extended to energy benchmarking in residential buildings in Brunei. Benchmarking provides the baseline measure for EEC, and it provides supporting data for building energy management. The Centre is also involved in community level energy projects at Sukang, Belait district. Apart from providing clean energy to this remote community, the project also aims to demonstrate how the use of clean technologies can lower the carbon foot print by adopting renewable resources as well as improving the efficiency in energy usage. Specially designed algorithms are being used to control the power generation, schedule and distribute the load, and to optimise power consumption.http://conferences.sigcomm.org/eenergy/2013/papers/p11.pdf The system will have a highly interactive and user friendly control interface which can be easily managed with minimal technical training. Another area of focus of the centre is food security. Under this component, computer models to support the Agricultural Systems are developed.http://www.research.ibm.com/articles/brunei.shtml A decision support system for the efficient management of paddy cultivation is being developed under this research. With the support of the high resolution weather prediction models developed under the centre, the optimal schedule for various agricultural activities can be estimated which helps in maximizing the productivity. FloodSim, the flood forecasting model developed by the centre, helps in forecasting possible floods that may affect various locations in the country.http://www.brusearch.com/news/117356http://www.ubd.edu.bn/news-and- events/highlights-archive/flood-forecasting-system-%E2%80%93-a-high- performance-computing-application/ The proposed system models the rainfall and runoff to predict the water flow in rivers in different time scales. This project has high potential in preventing the disasters caused by floods and hence can support the disaster management initiatives. Human Resource Development Apart from the cutting edge research in the focal areas, the centre is actively engaged in capacity building through specially designed courses and training programmes.http://www.zimbabwestar.com/index.php/sid/212178817/cat/eb75a2fd5e16e873http://www.bruneinews.net/index.php/sid/212178817/scat/Xhttp://www.santafe.edu/news/item/2011-gsss- brunei/http://www.ubd.edu.bn/discoverubd/issue-11/news/high-performance- computing-training-at-ubdibm- centre/http://www.brusearch.com/news/117356http://brunei- online.com.bn/bb/?p=88103 For example, the sustainability summer school organized by the centre has attracted participants from 10 countries around the world.http://www.santafe.edu/news/item/2011-gsss- brunei/http://www.bt.com.bn/news-national/2011/07/26/ubd-gathers-world- researchers-sustainability- projecthttp://tppserver.mit.edu/announcements/?p=167 The recently conducted modular training programmes on high performance computing, weather and climate modelling and renewable energy have received overwhelming responses from the participants.

(February 6, 1910). The Sunday Oregonian, Section 4, p. 12. In addition to the newspaper's offices and printing press, in 1922 the building became the home of Portland's first commercial radio station, KGW-AM, which was owned by the Oregonian Publishing Company. A second radio station, KEX, was acquired by the paper in 1933, and joined KGW in new, shared studios in the Oregonian Building. A fire in 1943 forced the radio stations to relocate. The company sold the building in December 1947 as it prepared for a move to a larger building. In June 1948, the newspaper moved to a new building on Southwest Broadway, also called the Oregonian Building. The 1892 building with the landmark clock tower then stood vacant for about two years until it was demolished, in 1950.

(September 25, 1887). The Sunday Oregonian, p. 2. That building and its wooden predecessor were referred to as the Oregonian Building, during their periods as the newspaper's headquarters, and this pattern continued with successor buildings. In 1890, the Oregonian Publishing Company began construction of a much larger headquarters building, to accommodate the paper's continuing expansion. The new Oregonian Building was located at the intersection of Southwest Sixth and Alder streets, northwest corner. The building's nine-story main portion was high, but extending for another 60 feet above was a tower with a smaller floor area and a large clock (with faces on all four sides) above the 11th floor. The building's overall height of \\"Oregonian Building Said Most Fireproof On Coast, Ahead of Its Time, When Built\\". (October 5, 1947). The Sunday Oregonian, p. 16. made it the tallest structure in Portland, a distinction it retained until the completion of the Yeon Building in 1911. It was \\"the first steel-framed skyscraper west of Chicago\\" when built. Its footprint was , and it contained roughly of floor space, including the basement but not the tower.

After completion of the building, some of the space was made available for lease to other businesses. Tenants included a drug store, a shoe store, a tailor, an optical store and a barber shop, along with offices of professional firms such as the Equitable Life Assurance Company.

In addition to The Morning Oregonian newspaper, the Oregonian also owned the Evening Telegram, and that paper was published from the 1892 building until the company sold it in 1914 to Wheeler Brothers. The Oregonian Building lost its status as Portland's tallest building in 1911, when the Yeon Building was completed. A jewelry store, Jaeger Brothers, that had occupied a portion of the ground floor was displaced in the early 1920s when the newspaper needed room for a new three-story printing press made by Goss, which came into use in 1923.

Ruth Ziolkowski took over the responsibility for the construction of the monument following the death of her husband in 1982. Korczak Ziolkowski had been focusing on the completion of Crazy Horse's horse at the time of his death. Ruth Ziolkowski changed course, ordering that Crazy Horse's face be completed instead. She hoped that the monument would become a tourist magnet once his 87.5-foot face was finished, providing needed funding for the project. Her prediction proved correct upon the face's completion in 1998 and the statue quickly became one of South Dakota's top tourist attractions. She oversaw the growth, expansion and progress at the Crazy Horse Memorial from the 1980s to the 2010s. Biography =Early life= She was born Ruth Ross to Frank and Lydia Ross on June 26, 1926 in West Hartford, Connecticut. She first met Polish American sculptor and artist Korczak Ziolkowski, when she was 13 years old in their native West Hartford. She and a friend showed up at his house to get an autograph from a film actor who was visiting him. Later, Ross was among a group of student volunteers who helped Ziolkowski create a sculpture of Noah Webster, the creator of the Webster's Dictionary and former resident of West Hartford, over the course of two years. The Webster statue now stands at the West Hartford Library. =Crazy Horse Memorial= Korczak previously helped with the completion of Mount Rushmore during the 1930s. He had been approached by Chief Henry Standing Bear of the Lakota approached him about a potential project. Ziolkowski designed a huge statue of Crazy Horse, an Oglala Lakota chief who helped defeat George Armstrong Custer at the Battle of Little Bighorn in 1876. He acquired Thunderhead Mountain in the Black Hills, located just 17 miles from Mount Rushmore, from the U.S. federal government, as the site for his monument. He arrived at the site on May 3, 1947 and commenced construction of the Crazy Horse Memorial in 1948. Ruth Ross arrived at the Crazy Horse Memorial in 1948 with a group of Connecticut youths who had volunteered to help Ziolkowski with the project during his pre-planning stages. A professional, as well as a personal, relationship soon developed. Ziolkowski and Ross married on November 23, 1950, on Thanksgiving. He was 42 years old, while she was 24 years old at the time of the wedding. The marriage produced ten children who were born in their small cabin where the family lived. While Korczak focused on the creation of Crazy Horse from the 1940s to the 1980s, Ruth handled much of the day-to-day operations of the Crazy Horse site from her office in the family's cabin. Ruth and her husband jointly compiled three books of material containing measurements and plans for the statue. She handled the finances and bookkeeping. She handled press inquires, staffed their visitors center, and acquired the equipment and materials needed to carve the sculpture. She handled these tasks while raising ten children. Korczak Ziolkowski declined financial support from the U.S. federal government, believing that it might offend Native American groups. In order to raise money during the early years of the project, Ruth Ziolkowski operated a timber mill and a dairy farm. She later served as the chairman of the board and chief executive officer for the Crazy Horse Memorial Foundation board of directors. Korczak Ziolkowski died on October 20, 1982, 34 years after beginning work on the Crazy Horse Memorial. He was buried at the base of Thunderhead Mountain where his sculpture was created. Ruth sought to keep on the project on task in collaboration with her children and the Crazy Horse Memorial Foundation. She utilized the three books of instructions and measurements, which she and her husband had compiled, to continue construction of the Crazy Horse Monument, and took charge of the staff, who included seven of their ten children. Ruth Ziolkowski oversaw all work on the sculpture from the 1980s until her death in 2014. She decided that Crazy Horse's face should be completed first, rather than the horse, as her husband had originally intended. Ruth Ziolkowski reasoned that Crazy Horse's face would increase tourism and provide an increased source of income to continue carving the mountain. The face was completed in 1998. She sought to expand the 1,000-acre complex's public facilities and increase its outreach to the Native American community. She has been credited with expanding the Indian Museum of North America, located on the grounds of the memorial, as well as establishing the Indian University of North America, which was founded in 2009. The Indian University was set to host thirty-two students during the summer of 2014. Work commenced on the horse's head after two years of planning and measurements. Ruth Ziolkowski explained some of the challenges of carving the horse head at the time, \\"The first hurdle was one of logistics ‚Äì we have taken considerable time to measure and calculate the best approach to what will be an extraordinary and lengthy undertaking. We've been mindful of Korczak's good advice to 'Go slowly so you do it right' as well as the old adage about the wisdom of measuring something six times before you cut it once.\\" Ruth Ziolkowski could not provide an exact deadline for the projected completion date, noting the complexities of weather, money and labor needed for the sculpture. She believed that the sculpture, especially the horse's head, could take decades to complete. She believed that her late husband would be \\"absolutely thrilled\\" with the progress on the sculpture from the 1980s to the 2010s. =Later life, death and legacy= Ruth Ziolkowski was diagnosed with cancer in March 2014. She continued to oversee the Crazy Horse project until April 2014, when she entered a hospice. She died on May 21, 2014 in Rapid City, South Dakota, where she had been receiving treatment, aged 87. She was survived by nine of her children: John, Dawn, Adam, Jadwiga, Casimir, Mark, Joel, Monique and Marinka; twenty-three grandchildren; and eleven great- grandchildren. Her daughter, Anne, had predeceased her in 2011. Thousands of people attended Ziolkowski's memorial service, which was held at the Crazy Horse Monument on May 27, 2014. South Dakota Governor Dennis Daugaard requested that flags be flown at half-staff in her honor. She was buried in a stone coffin at the base of Thunderhead Mountain next to her husband. Following her death, Ziolkowski was succeeded as leader of the Crazy Horse Memorial by three equal successors as part of a succession plan: Laurie Becvar, the president and chief operating officer of the Crazy Horse Memorial Foundation, and two of Ziolkowski's daughters, Jadwiga and Monique. Honors and awards Ziolkowski was inducted into the South Dakota Hall of Fame in 1988 for her contributions to Arts and Enterntainment. Her husband was also posthumously inducted into the Hall of Fame that same year. She received an honorary degree from the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology for her work. The same college also bestowed a public service award on the entire Ziolkowski family in 1998.

It is made by forming gy≈´hi, a sort of soft mochi, into flat round cakes.Shinmura (1991), Kojien dictionary Glutinous rice, starch, syrup and sugar are the basic ingredients. It is manufactured by some fifteen confectioners based in Okayama City., as of its writing. While perhaps originally made from kibi (proso millet), the modern recipe uses little or no millet, reports that as of its writing \\"more than fifteen companies in Okayama City have been producing kibi-dango, some of which do not contain millet\\". Sangetsud≈ç also once advertised that its formula did not use any millet. (See below). and substantively differs from of yore, famous from the Japanese heroic folk tale of Momotar≈ç or \\"Peach Boy\\"; nevertheless, \\"Kibi dango\\" continues to be represented as being the same as the folk hero Peach Boy's dumpling.: \\"When used to refer to a local specialty of Okayama, [K]ibi-dango has always meant both millet dumplings of the Momotaro story and a dumpling of the Kibi region. In Japanese language, words like this are often made from two homonymic words.\\" The simplistic, and widely disseminated notion regarding its invention is that it was developed in the early Ansei era (ca. 1856) by the confectioner K≈çeid≈ç, but a local historian has traced a more elaborate multi- phased history in which the founding of this wagashi shop and the development of the modern recipe is pushed to a number of years later. Some hypotheses trace its pre-history to the dumpling (or some other food item) served at the Kibitsu Shrine in Okayama. The resident deity of this shrine, Kibitsuhiko, is a legendary ogre-slayer, claimed to be the true identity of Momotar≈ç, especially by Okayama locals. The theory originated in the 1930s, and since then there has been concerted effort in the region to promote the folk hero Momotar≈ç as a local of Kibi Province, and his dumplings as \\"Kibi dango\\" by default. Origins There are irreconcilably differing accounts of the dates and sequences of events regarding the invention. The standard curt explanation is that this specialty dessert was first invented by the confectioner during the early Ansei era (1854-). This purveyor later split into two brands, and which remain to this day. Takeda is the family name of the original business. The current proprietors give a more complex account of the first origins, but local historians uncovered an even more convoluted history. =Family's own account= The official line version, endorsed by the K≈çeid≈ç Honten, is that the family ran a ceramics merchant named \\"\\" for 7 generations running, until it switched business to that of a confectioner in 1856, changing the shop name to \\"K≈çeid≈ç\\". According to this scenario, around 1856,The specified year shifts slightly according to source. Shida () states that according to information given him by K≈çeid≈ç, the confection was created around 1853 (Kaei 6) and dubbed \\"Kibi dango\\" around 1855 (Ansei 2). Takeda Hanz≈ç (ÂçäËîµ), the retired predecessor of the family ceramics shop, was one of the three Okayama townsmen who collectively devised the new recipe that was somehow an improvement over the steamed millet dumpling \\"rectangularly shaped like kakimochi, which did not keep well, and was eaten with red bean paste or with sauce poured on top,\\" which was a common staple wherever the crop was harvested. =Wagashi references books= Contrary to this, a handful of desk references place \\"K≈çeid≈ç\\" already in existence at the time of c. 1856 invention, crediting the shop's first proprietor Takeda Asajir≈ç (ÊµÖÊ¨°ÈÉé) rather than the elder Hanz≈ç for the recipe. These sources claim that the tea ceremony connoisseur named , who was then senior advisor (kar≈ç) to the feudal lord of the local Okayama Castle (Ikeda clan), gave Asajir≈ç crucial advise leading to the recipe innovation,, after Oka Ch≈çhei and that the millet dumplings served at Kibitsu Shrine inspired hint. But the time frame seems to be wrong. Asajir≈ç himself wrote that during his watch, the kibi dango changed shape from the rectangular to round shapes, and this happened sometimes after the Meiji Era was ushered in (1868-). The tea ceremony expert in question, referred to in these sources as only called himself by this art name in his retirement, from 1869 to his death in 1886. =Detailed account by local historians= More meticulous accounts of what transpired, uncovered by the labors of local historians, suggest that indeed, several years passed between 1856 and the time Asajir≈ç became successor to this business, changing the recipe. A detailed chronology was stitched together by local historian Oka Ch≈çhei based on articles in print and additionally conducted interviews, is as follows:; reprinted as In the year 1855 (Ansei 2) three commoners from the town around Okayama Castle (now Okayama City) collaborated and devised a reddish rectangular confection rather like kakimochi as accompaniment to serving tea. Among the three was , resident of Furugy≈çch≈ç and Karatsu ware peddling agent fronting for the samurai clan (my≈çdai). This old man Hanryo was the grandfather , and a member of the Takeda family who later founded K≈çeid≈ç. This snack was for pastime purposes only and not meant for business, but since leaving it nameless did not seem fitting, they pondered until they struck up the idea of borrowing the province name and calling it , something of a nonce word. This much is given in an article by a Meiji era popular culture researcher, entitled . Although this dessert was initially only distributed among friends and family, it was eventually offered for sale and gained popularity. Takeda Hanz≈ç (died in 1901 at age 81) then outfitted a shop named after his own art name, and had his mistress sell the Kibi-dan-go. Although Oka also heard dissenting reports that this Kibi-dan-go was millet dumpling with a \\"rather long thin thread of red bean paste poured over it,\\" he was skeptical, and concluded it was in fact \\"probably kakimochi\\". After Hanz≈ç's mistress died, the S≈çkand≈ç business was passed over to Hanz≈ç's relative Takeda Asajir≈ç, the founder of K≈çeid≈ç. It was not until Takeda Asajir≈ç's takeover that the merchandise became the present-day soft gy≈´hi product packed in boxes, according to the memory of Nishio Kichitaro, founder of the , for many years the only newspaper of the area. Asajir≈ç's own book too states that it was only after the Meiji Restoration (1867-) that his product changed from the rectangular items of the past to the round cakes as large as two go stones, sold in boxed in sets of 30 or 50. In 1885 (Meiji 18) K≈çeid≈ç's Kibi dango was presented to Emperor Meiji who was visiting the area, and he wrote a waka poem praising it, which translated to \\"Kibi dango such that no two such exists in Japan / Indeed such is the taste and it has earned its name, this\\". The sellers subsequently began to enclose leaflets with this poem printed inside its boxes.The poem in Japanese: \\"Nihon ni futatsu to aranu Kibi dango / mube ajiwai ni na wo eshiya kore Êó•Êú¨„Å´„Åµ„Åü„Å§„Å®„ÅÇ„Çâ„Å¨ÂêâÂÇôÂõ£Â≠ê/„ÇÄ„Åπ„ÅÇ„Åò„Çè„ÅÑ„Å´Âêç„Çí„Åà„Åó„ÇÑÊòØ \\" Pre-history relating to Kibitsu Shrine There are a number of sources attempting to trace the pre-history of the Kibi dango to some food, or custom, or legend associated with Okayama's Kibitsu Shrine, though each line of inquiry differs from one another. As aforestated, there had been a piece of anecdote or rumor (perhaps collected in the Meiji era), claiming that the Kibi dango recipe was created on suggestion of former feudal advisor Igi San'ensai, and that he used the millet dumplings served at Kibitsu Shrine as hint. The founder of K≈çeido (the purveyors of Kibi dango) authored a travel guide in 1895, in which he claimed that Kibitsuhiko rolled with his own hand some kibi dango to give to Emperor Jimmu who stopped at Takayama Palace in Okayama. This episode is anachronistic and hence faulty,Prince Kibitsuhiko in life was an 8th generation descendant and unborn during the time of Jimmu. but illustrates that the manufacturer was attempting to associate their product with this deity at a relatively early juncture. From modern academia, one theory notes that Japanese shrines have a custom called whereby food offerings to the resident deitiy would afterwards be consumed. Kibitsu Shrine observed this custom in the early Edo Period, and this was the origin of the Kibi dango, according to Okayama University professor in his book on the history of the prefecture.; 1984 edition: Appendix, p.46. On the other hand, , also of Okayama University, who had the ancestral line of the shrine's priests (kannushi) in his family background, conjectured that the sweet was an adaptation of the , a specialty of the Miyauchi and Itakura hamlets in the (i.e., the community served by Bitch≈´-Takamatsu Station) which is in the environs of the shrine.Fujii cites two sources that refer to the Miauchi ame: (1753), and (1860), , a guidebook, meant to be used as a reader for terakoya schools. Sino- and Russo-Japanese Wars K≈çeid≈ç's Kibi dango's national fame came after the private San'y≈ç Railway came into operation through its city. This new line connected the Kobe (which was the terminus of the state-run line) to Okayama in 1891, and extended the line to Hiroshima just before the Sino-Japanese War broke out in 1894. Since the Daihonei (Imperial General Headquarters) was located in Hiroshima, all the troops were amassed here and shipped in and out of (Hiroshima Harbor). Those residing farther east and serving the war by necessity rode the San'y≈ç line, and passed the Okayama station in transit. K≈çeid≈ç, which been peddling their goods in Okayama Station now expanded business to the Hiroshima Station, and capitalized on the soldiers and send-off parties buying the Kibi dango as souvenirs. It was at this time that K≈çeid≈ç began its marketing strategy connecting its product to \\"Peach Boy\\". Reputedly, proprietor Takeda Asajir≈ç himself dressed up as Momotar≈ç and held up the \\"Nippon-ichi (number one in Japan)\\" banner to pitch sales, and persons dressed up as oni ogre handed out leaflets. The peddling at the station was so successful, that a lady from Yamawaki (Sangetsud≈ç), who also had Takeda Hanz≈ç connections, was recruited to help. By April 1897 (Meiji 30), there were 12 establishments that billed themselves as the \\"original\\" (honbo, honke, ganso) Kibi dango sellers., tally according to the Sany≈ç Shimp≈ç newspaper. A 1901 article by folk historian stated that while\\"K≈çeid≈ç used millet, mochi, and sugar as ingredients, Sangetsud≈ç used mochi and sugar,\\" and that Sangetsud≈ç stressed the fact they did not use millet and was different item than \\"Japan's number one kibi dango.\\" Modern age As already described, during the Meiji Era, the Kibi dango business had already appropriated the \\"number one\\" slogan from the Peach Boy folktale, and was using the hero's costume to promote sales. But eventually, the entire Okayama prefecture began to promote the Kibi dango and Momotar≈ç as inextricably connected part of their prefectural heritage. This was mostly a post-World War II phenomenon, Okayama had not been the foremost contender as the home of the Peach Boy (Inuyama, Aichi and Kinashi in Takamatsu on Shikoku previously laying strong claims). However, that changed with the advent of amateur ethnographer (1897-1973), (\\"The True History of Momotar≈ç,\\" 1930), which claimed that the Momotar≈ç folktale was an adaption of legend Kibitsuhiko no Mikoto no Ura Taiji, which recounts Kibitsuhiko's suppression of a local oni (ogre) named ., given as \\"Namba Ginnosuke\\" This ogre-slayer Kibitsuhiko, as his name suggests, is the deified being venerated in Kibitsu Shrine, Okayama. Nowadays, the Momotar≈ç theme is used in train station advertisement, as well as being found in packaging of the kibi dango products. Since 1993, the K≈çeid≈ç Honten has sold the \\"Ganso Kibidango\\", featuring Momotar≈ç character design by children's book illustrator Tar≈ç Gomi. An assortment of varieties has been developed, such as 'mascatto kibi dango (Muscat grape syrup filling), momo kibi dango (white peach syrup filling), kinako kibi dango (sprinkled with kinako or dry soybean powder), and chocolate flavored varieties.

Joining the military in early 1915, Rees was raised to the rank of lieutenant before his twenty-first birthday and eventually reached captain on the day of his death. He was killed on 17 September 1916 while flying as an observer in an F.E.2b aircraft, which was shot down by Manfred von Richthofen, the German flying ace who was later known as the \\"Red Baron\\". The aircraft was the first of Richthofen's 80 credited aerial combat victories. Early life Tom Rees was born on 18 May 1895 to a Welsh-speaking farming family at Cefnbrynich, a farm near Sennybridge about from Brecon in Wales. The son of Thomas Rees and Alice Rees (n√©e Evans), he was the youngest of their six children. He attended Brecon Boys' County School, before commencing at the University College of Wales at Aberystwyth in 1912. He was considered a scholar and was described as a smart university student. Military career While Rees was at Aberystwyth University, he joined the Officers' Training Corps and upon his graduation with a Bachelor of Arts degree, volunteered for war service and joined the Army. On 21 January 1915, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Welch Fusiliers, an infantry regiment and he was subsequently posted to that regiment's 14th (Service) Battalion, briefly serving with them on the Western Front. He volunteered to join the Royal Flying Corps in November 1915 and returned to the United Kingdom for aircrew training. Upon graduating, he was posted to No. 11 Squadron and returned to the front. He had earned early promotion to lieutenant as a result of his \\"academic abilities\\" prior to his transfer and this was later followed by advancement to captain, which was promulgated on 17 September 1916. Death Lionel Morris, who was the pilot of Rees' aircraft, in 1916 FE 2b, serial number 7018 On Sunday, 17 September 1916, Rees was the observer in a two-man F. E. 2b, serial number 7018, piloted by Second Lieutenant Lionel Morris. They were part of a group of eight Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2cs and six F.E.2b escorts from the Royal Flying Corps 3rd Brigade. As the formation returned from bombing the railway station at Marcoing they encountered a group of about twenty German aircraft from Jasta 2. Manfred von Richthofen, who later came to be known as the \\"Red Baron\\", was newly assigned to Jasta 2 and was under the tutelage of Oswald Boelcke. Upon sighting the British aircraft, Boelcke gave the sign to attack but held back himself. In the ensuing fight, two aircraft from No. 12 Squadron and four from No. 11 Squadron were shot down, including Rees and Morris' aircraft, which was shot down by von Richthofen. Rees was killed during the dogfight with von Richthofen; but Morris his pilot, although mortally wounded, managed to land the aircraft. This was the \\"Red Baron's\\" first official victory. For Richthofen, this was the first of the 80 confirmed aerial combat victories with which he was credited before his death in April 1918. The circumstances foreshadowed his death later in the war. His account of the event noted that the pilot was probably experienced, as he appeared conscious of the danger he was in and did his best to escape, as von Richthofen manoeuvred his new Albatros D.II serial number 491/16, into position to attack. Rees, in the observer's position, fired constantly from the forward-facing Lewis machine- gun (which could also be turned to fire backwards over the pilot). Von Richthofen recounted that at the time he was not sure whether the F.E.2b would fall, until he was able to close up behind it during a moment of non-evasive flying, taking advantage of the F.E.2b's vulnerability underneath. After he fired, the propeller stopped turning, indicating that he must have hit the engine. Rees was not visible and the plane was flying unsteadily, indicating to von Richthofen that both British men had been injured. Morris managed to land the aeroplane at a nearby German airfield at Flesqui√®res. Von Richthofen followed the F. E. 2b down and saw the dead observer and badly wounded pilot (who died later the same day), then flew back to his squadron's base at Bertincourt. Manfred von Richthofen later recalled that: \\"I was animated by a single thought: the man in front of me must come down\\". He closed in to point blank range, opened fire, and \\"suddenly the opponent's propeller turned no more. Hit!\\" It became evident that the plane lacked the speed to return to its own lines. When it was forced down, von Richthofen landed his craft near the aircraft and documented his kill. This delayed his return to the Jasta headquarters and he explained the delay with \\"One Englishman shot down\\". He later ordered a small silver cup from a Berlin jeweller to commemorate the victory. The inscription read: \\"1. Vickers 2. 17.9.16\\". This was the first of 60 such cups which von Richthofen ordered up until September 1917, at which time the jeweller declined further orders, since production was impossible due to a wartime silver shortage. According to Richthofen, ‚ÄúI honoured the fallen enemy by placing a stone on his beautiful grave.‚Äùvon Richthofen, Manfred et al. \\"Der rote Kampfflieger.\\" Deutscher Verlag (Ullstein), 1933. Rees was buried with full military honours by the Germans. His remains are interred in Grave C 2 of the town cemetery at Villers Plouich. Rees's family learnt of his death in November 1916, on the morning of the funeral of his older brother David John, who had been killed in a tree-felling accident adjacent to the family farm. Morris is buried at Cambrai, Porte de Paris Cemetery, Grave: I A 16. Rees was described to Morris' father, in a letter from the pilot of another aircraft that was also shot down, as being \\"a very capable and plucky observer\\". Legacy After his death, Rees was nominated for a Mention in Despatches, for his \\"excellent work as an observer\\" by his commanding officer, who cited that he had flown many sorties between July and September 1916, before being posted as missing in action. He was later awarded the 1914‚Äì15 Star, the British War Medal and the British Victory Medal for war service. In 1999, Rees's war medals were sold at auction, and fetched ¬£4,500 (ca. $7,200 American dollars) because of their historical significance. For the 100th anniversary of Rees' and Morris' deaths, descendants of Richthofen and Rees and Morris met each other for the first time since 1916.

As the largest bookkeeping project in history, this would not have been possible without such technology. Graphical representation of social machines on the Internet that have access to big data in data bases via reference architectures and that communicate with many users in social networks via human language. A social machine is an environment comprising humans and technology interacting and producing outputs or action which would not be possible without both parties present. The growth of social machines has been greatly enabled by technologies such as the Internet, the smartphone, social media and the World Wide Web, by connecting people in new ways. Concept The idea of social machines has been around for a long time, discussed as early as 1846 by Captain William Allen, and also by authors such as Norman Mailer, Gilles Deleuze and F√©lix Guattari. Social machines blur the lines between computational processes and input from humans. They often take the form of collaborative online projects which produce web content, such as Wikipedia, citizen science projects like Galaxy Zoo, and even social networking site such as Twitter have also been defined as social machines. However, a social machine does not necessarily produce outcomes which directly affect the individuals or machines involved and an alternative viewpoint states that Social Machines are \\"rather than being an intentionally engineered piece of software - the substrate of accumulated human cross-system information sharing activities\\". Nigel Shadbolt et al. say that the telos of the social machine is specific to its participants, whereas the telos of a platform is independent of its participants‚Äô purposes; the platform is there to facilitate communication. A social machine may also spread across more than one platform, depending on how its participants interact, while a platform like Twitter could host many thousands of social machines. An academic field investigating the idea has been active since Tim Berners-Lee's book Weaving the web. Social machines are characterised as 'social systems on the Web ... computational entities governed by both computational and social processes'. Tim Berners-Lee and James Hendler expressed some of the underlying scientific challenges with respect to AI research using semantic web technology as a point of departure. Nello Cristianini and Teresa Scantamburlo argued that the combination of a human society and an algorithmic regulation forms a social machine.

The falls (more accurately described as a chute or cascade,Harris, Mike. \\"Burleigh Falls\\" .

Although the south and north shores are at one point less than 100m apart, the area is so riddled with large lakes and rivers that before the bridge was built the shortest distance by land between the two points was at that time more than 70 km., much of it without roads.Illustrated Historical Atlas of Peterborough County 1825 - 1875 Before the Kings Post Truss style iron bridge was built in the 1860s, travelers managed by crossing Stony Lake, by boat in the summer, and across the ice in winter.Lavery, Doug and Mary. \\"Up the Burleigh Road... beyond the boulders\\". Trent Valley Archives, Peterborough, Ontario Lock 28 In historical times, because of the large number of lakes and the rocky uneven terrain, most travel in central Ontario took place on water. An extensive system of locks and dams, the Trent- Severn Waterway, which connects Lake Ontario to Georgian Bay, was built to facilitate this travel. At Burleigh Falls, the large, rapidly moving flow, cascading over and around rocks, was a serious barrier to transportation, so Lock 28 was built just to the north, allowing boat traffic to bypass the falls. Commonly known as the Burleigh Falls Lock, it was previously composed of two 4m flights, and the lock canal, about 190m in length blasted through solid granite. The lock was replaced with one lock with a lift of 7.3m \\"A whimsical waterway on Peterborough's Trent Severn\\" . Metro, 21 October 2010.Foran, Charles. \\"Trent-Severn Waterway: The waterway\\" .

Reelkandi produce original format features it creates, along with covering major entertainment events that take place in the United States and United Kingdom, for viewers to watch online. Reelkandi was founded by Earl Carpenter, a West End theatre stage actor who played the lead role in The Phantom of the Opera and who in August 2014 featured in the Broadway version of Les Mis√©rables. Incorporated as a registered company in the United Kingdom in 2012, Reelkandi was one of the first online female Television channels to introduce the concept of immersing consumer product sponsored narratives into its video content, which is more commonly known as native advertising. Reelkandi used native advertising as an alternative to display advertising and video advertising around its features, by showing brand messages within the framework of the programs themselves.  History  Starting as a London-based independently owned online television channel, Reelkandi launched by filming theatre events in 2009, covering productions on Broadway, New York and the West End, London. By 2010, coverage expanded to encompass wider entertainment topics, from Red Carpet Award Ceremonies and Film Premiere's to Music Festivals. In 2010, the Laurence Olivier Awards was streamed live on the internet for the first time by Reelkandi, reaching a live audience of over 113,000 viewers who watched the event for the first time since it was first launched in 1976. Reelkandi repeated its live coverage the following year in 2011, before the event switched coverage to the BBC in 2012 for Television broadcast and ITV in 2013. By early 2011, Reelkandi program schedule had extended to producing original program formats created by the channel, such as Afternoon Tease as weekly episodic features, at a time when YouTube, one of the world's largest websites for videos, only just began to fund original programming also. Further expansion in the program schedule took place in late 2011 to incorporate the female lifestyle genre, producing an offshoot channel titled The New Millionaire Channel. Establishing native advertising Reelkandi became one of the first female online Television channels to introduce native advertising into its video features in 2011, by combining Advertorial and branded content disciplines into its editorial style, weaving consumer brand messages and editorials into the contextual story lines of the editorial video features, working with various consumer brands such as Procter & Gamble. The online Television channel attained a global reach of around 70 million internet video views a month by 2012, where by March 2014, according to comScore, video views in the United States alone, reached 47 billion views across thousands of online publishers, where the top 10 publishers video views ranged from 164 million to 11 billion views in a month. By 2013, Reelkandi had established its practice of native advertising, at a time when online publishers were beginning to venture into the practice as an alternative to traditional advertising for the first time. For Reelkandi, key consumer brand partnership were established to carry out native advertising campaigns, working with brands like Procter and Gamble. In the case of the Gillette Venus brand, Reelkandi produced a themed series of video features diarising the journeys taken by fashion graduates entering into the Fashion Industry for their first time. The episodic feature which included the coverage of London Fashion Week February 2014 was shown across social media channels, traditional female journals, online publications, and video channels.

It was ordered in 1850, some time after the death of William Wakefield, an important but controversial agent for the New Zealand Company. It was not put up until 1882, but even after then, it was rare to commemorate settlers with a memorial. Originally placed in the Basin Reserve, it was relocated to outside the cricket ground, before being restored in 2006 by Wellington City Council and placed close to its original location. History Wakefield arrived in New Zealand in 1839 as principal agent for the New Zealand Company. Wakefield was regarded as Wellington's first leader. When Wakefield died in 1848, his friends raised the funds for a memorial, which was ordered from England; sources vary whether this was done in 1850, in the early 1850s, or in 1862. The New Zealand Company's reputation deteriorated significantly, and the memorial was not installed, but put in storage in Bethune and Hunter's yard for many years. William Barnard Rhodes, another prominent early Wellington settler, put up ¬£50 towards the installation of the memorial in 1876. In March 1882, Wellington City Council committee tasked the City Surveyor with finding a suitable site for the memorial, and the structure was temporarily put on public display in a council yard. Soon afterwards, the committee resolved to install the memorial at the Basin Reserve. In 1886, a drinking fountain was added; this had first been suggested by Rhodes. The William Wakefield Memorial in 2005 prior to its relocation to its current position The cricket grounds were overhauled in 1917 and as part of this, the William Wakefield Memorial was relocated to the outside of the grounds. The drinking fountain stopped operating in the 1940s, and the memorial slowly deteriorated but also suffered from vandalism. In 1968, the monument was described as \\"beyond repair\\". The drinking fountain was removed during the 1980s. Wellington City Council put money towards restoration into their budget in 2004, and the work was carried out in 2006. This included the relocation close to its original position, a structural upgrade, and the reinstatement of the drinking fountain.

Segments with indented profiles (troughs) interlock to form a wall with alternating indents and outdents. The troughs increase resistance to bending. The segments are typically made of steel or another metal. right Larssen sheet piling was developed in 1906 for use in the construction invented by Tryggve Larssen. Its applications include piers, oil terminals, waste storage facilities, shoreline protection, bridges, houses, buildings, dry docks other construction sites and for the strengthening of pond banks, preventing slumping into a pit and flooding. Construction Lengths can reach 36 meters. Each segment is flipped 180¬∞ versus the preceding segment. The segments lock together using a variety of interconnections. The fully assembled structure is formed in a linear, circular, or other shape. To reduce the filtering space, mixed sealant is injected. Additionally, it may be combined with the use of dowels, metal beams and pipes. Metal dowels are hot-rolled steel and cold-rolled. Design Cross-section of Larssen sheet piling * Tongue Larssen - Tongue Larssens are up to 34 meters long and 80 centimeters wide. They have locks, which allow people to connect one profile to another vertically to create a sealed metal diaphragm wall. Transverse profiles can be in the shape of letters: S, Z, L or Œ© (Omega) where the trough can be of varying depth. * Special Profile - Special profiles are long and narrow without locks. They usually have a wavy or trough shape to increase the resistance to bending. * Cantilever - Bending moments and shears are calculated under the assumption that the wall is a cantilever beam fixed at the bottom of the wall. *Anchored Wall Design- Bending moments, shears, and anchor force are calculated under the assumption that the wall is a beam with simple supports at the anchor elevation and at the bottom of the wall (the place where the wall moves beneath the surface of the ground. With the bottom of the wall at the penetration consistent with a factor of safety of 1, the lateral reaction at the bottom support will be zero and the lateral reaction at the upper support will be the horizontal component of the anchor force. Applications Larssens are used in foundation pits, coastline strengthening, bridge construction, piers, tide control, flood protection, agriculture irrigation, water reservoir and other work requiring extremely strong support in a narrow geometry.

The film features covers of songs from the 1980s and was released on 27 June 2014. It is also a debut role for singer-songwriter Leona Lewis. Plot The opening scene shows Taylor and her boyfriend Raf by the sea. Raf wants Taylor to stay with him in Italy, but Taylor wishes to go to university and start her \\"real life\\". Three years later, Taylor goes to the south Italian region of Apulia on holiday (\\"Holiday\\"). Her sister Maddie, who went there five weeks before upon Taylor's instruction to get over a break-up with her boyfriend Doug, greets her when she arrives and surprises Taylor with her extravagant house and their friend Lil. Maddie also reveals she is getting married in two days, which shocks Taylor (\\"Venus\\"). Lil reveals that Taylor had a boyfriend in Apulia on her holiday three years ago, but Taylor explains she doesn't want to rekindle her relationship with him. Taylor then goes down to the beach to see if she recognizes anybody from her holiday three years ago. She is reunited with her friend Elena and her boyfriend Enrico, as well as her friend Mikey. Taylor sees Raf on the beach and follows him cleverly (\\"How Will I Know?\\") before falling right in front of him. Raf recognizes her and is about to greet her when Maddie runs over and kisses Raf, revealing that Raf is Maddie's fianc√©. Raf, Elena, Mikey and Enrico are all very surprised that Maddie and Taylor are sisters as they don't think the pair have anything in common. Taylor is shocked that Maddie is marrying Raf, but pretends she doesn't know him, Elena, Enrico, or Mikey, despite Elena telling her she should tell Maddie the truth. Taylor declines, and tells her she would prefer to keep it a secret as not to worry Maddie. Later on that night the group attends a dinner, where Raf makes a speech about Maddie that brings Taylor to tears, which she disguises. Maddie makes a speech (\\"The Power of Love\\"). Taylor goes outside to the bar and Raf follows her, saying that the relationship between them is \\"weird\\", which Taylor denies at first but then agrees with. Raf wants to tell Maddie about their relationship three years ago but Taylor refuses, wanting to protect Maddie and to stop her from feeling like a fool. The next day, Raf and Taylor are sent by Maddie to go and sort out their clothes and also the rings. Raf and Taylor argue about their past relationship and Taylor says she doesn't believe people should \\"sing from the rooftops\\", referring to people's feelings. Raf argues that if they do, they really mean it. Elena, Mikey and Enrico overhear and leave. However, when Raf and Taylor step out of the changing cubicles in their wedding outfits it is hinted that they still have feelings for each other. While this is happening, Doug turns up and surprises Maddie at the market. He tells her he made a mistake by breaking up with her, and wants her back. She declines, but Doug tries to persuade her (\\"Don't You Want Me\\"). He follows Maddie back to her house, where she agrees to have dinner with him before her hen party as a \\"final farewell\\". Elena and Enrico are discussing Taylor's secret by the pool and Maddie walks in, finding out Elena has a secret. Elena panics and tells her she is pregnant. Raf and Taylor return from wedding preparations and Maddie asks if Taylor would like a plus one, hinting at her past boyfriend from three years ago. Taylor declines and then finds out about Doug and Maddie's dinner after Doug sends Maddie pink roses with a note saying he can't wait for it, and an argument ensues. The others break up the argument by taking Taylor to the tomato festival (\\"Walking on Sunshine\\"). Maddie is left behind to be pampered for her hen night. After the festival, Raf takes Taylor to the sea to wash off the tomatoes. The sun is setting (\\"Eternal Flame\\"). Raf overhears Taylor and the two go to kiss, but Taylor runs away, still thinking about Maddie. Raf chases her as she runs back to the house, and he demands to know if she has any feelings for him and to discuss what happened between them on the beach. Whilst they are arguing, Maddie walks in and her hen party guests led by Elena and Lil surprise them. Taylor is forced to reveal that Raf was her old love from her past Puglia holiday but lies, saying that she has no feelings for him. Raf is hurt, but says the same, to keep his relationship with Maddie strong. Lil kicks Raf out of the hen night and Maddie tells Taylor to change for the party. The girls go out on the hen night, dressed up (\\"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun\\"); the boys do the same (\\"The Wild Boys\\"). Taylor leaves the nightclub that the girls are visiting, and sings It Must Have Been Love, along with Raf who is in a different part of Puglia at his stag do. Taylor realizes she still loves Raf and decides she can't stay in case she destroys Maddie and Raf's relationship. She leaves for the airport in a taxi, throwing a picture of her and Raf out of the taxi window. Whilst Taylor is leaving, Maddie goes back to her bedroom where Doug is waiting. He says he does not want anything from her but he wants to give his blessing, which Maddie says is \\"sweet\\" before she realizes what Doug is doing. She ties Doug up, pretending she is going to have sex with him (\\"Faith\\"); instead, she pushes him into the pool. Everything goes silent and Maddie goes to see if he is alright, and Doug is on one knee with an engagement ring, which confuses Maddie. The morning afterwards, Lil finds Taylor in the airport and offers advice. She says that Taylor must forget her feelings for Raf as her relationship with Maddie is more important. Taylor agrees and the pair get in a taxi to go to the wedding, after Lil realizes they are late. Taylor changes in the taxi. Maddie also wakes up late, hugging a picture of Raf, meaning she turned Doug away. Raf is shown duct taped to a tree next to a nunnery. The cast congregates at the church (\\"White Wedding\\"). Maddie and Taylor reconcile before heading inside. At the altar, the priest asks if anybody objects to Raf and Maddie's marriage, to which Doug stands up, but Maddie tells him to sit down. Maddie then surprises everyone, telling Raf she is in love with love itself rather than him specifically and that he deserves better. Raf leaves the church but Taylor pursues him to apologize (\\"If I Could Turn Back Time\\"). When it doesn't work, Taylor runs to the roof and sings to Raf from there, as earlier on in the film Raf said if somebody sings from the rooftops you can tell they mean their feelings. Raf joins Taylor on the roof where Taylor tells Raf she loves him and the two kiss. Later at the beach, Elena admits to Enrico that she actually is pregnant and Enrico is overjoyed. Lil hints at having feelings for Mikey by kissing him. Maddie and Taylor discuss how Maddie is now alone, but she says she will be fine. Doug interrupts the girls, and Lil and Taylor strap him into a hang glider whilst Maddie distracts him. Lil gives a signal to a boat offshore and Doug is flown up into the air, screaming. The entire cast then perform \\"Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go\\" and the film ends.
