In many democratic republic countries, the ruling party is the party of the elected president that is in charge of the executive branch of government. Within such parliamentary systems, the majority in the legislature also controls the executive branch of government, thus leaving no possibility of opposing parties concurrently occupying the executive and legislative branches of government. In other systems, such as in an American style presidential system, the party of the president does not necessarily also have a legislative majority.

It is maintained by TransCanada PipeLines, LP. It is the longest pipeline in Canada. Creation Canada's population was booming during the 1950s, and energy shortages were becoming problematic. Canadian company TransCanada PipeLines Ltd. was incorporated in 1951 to undertake the construction of a natural gas pipeline across Canada. The financing of the project was split 50–50 between American and Canadian interests. Two applicants originally expressed interest in moving gas east: Canadian Delhi Oil Company (now called TCPL) proposed moving gas to the major cities of eastern Canada by an all-Canadian route, while Western Pipelines wanted to stop at Winnipeg with a branch line south to sell into the midwestern United States. In 1954 C. D. Howe, a member of the Cabinet of Canada of a Liberal Government, forced the two companies to merge, with the all-Canadian route preferred over its more economical but American- routed competitor. This imposed solution reflected problems encountered with the construction of the Interprovincial oil pipeline. Despite the speed of its construction, the earlier line caused angry debate in Parliament, with the Opposition arguing that Canadian centres deserved consideration before American customers and that \\"the main pipeline carrying Canadian oil should be laid in Canadian soil\\". By constructing its natural gas mainline along an entirely Canadian route, TCPL accommodated nationalist sentiments, solving a political problem for the federal government. The regulatory process for TCPL proved long and arduous. After rejecting proposals twice, Alberta finally granted its permission to export gas from the province in 1953. At first, the province waited for explorers to prove gas reserves sufficient for its thirty- year needs, intending to only allow exports in excess of those needs. After clearing this hurdle, the federal government virtually compelled TCPL into a merger with Western pipelines. When this reorganized TCPL went before the Federal Power Commission for permission to sell gas into the United States, the Americans greeted it coolly. The FPC proved sceptical of the project's financing and unimpressed with Alberta's reserves. Politics The 1,090-kilometre section crossing the Canadian Shield was the most difficult leg of the pipeline. Believing construction costs could make the line uneconomic, private sector sponsors refused to finance this portion of the line. Since the federal government wanted the line laid for nationalistic reasons, the reigning Liberals put a bill before Parliament to create a crown corporation to build and own the Canadian Shield portion of the line, leasing it back to TCPL. The Louis St. Laurent government aggressively restricted debate on this bill to get construction underway by June 1956, knowing that delays beyond that month would postpone the entire project a year. The use of closure created a Parliamentary scandal. Known as the Great Pipeline Debate, this parliamentary episode contributed to the government's defeat at the polls in 1957, ending many years of Liberal rule, and bringing in a government under Prime Minister John Diefenbaker. The bill was passed and construction of the TransCanada pipeline began. A stock trading scandal surrounding Northern Ontario Natural Gas, the contractor for the Northern Ontario leg of the pipeline, also implicated Sudbury mayor Leo Landreville and Ontario provincial cabinet ministers Philip Kelly, William Griesinger and Clare Mapledoram between 1955 and 1958.Bad Judgment: The Case of Justice Leo A. Landreville, William Kaplan, 1996. Construction The TransCanada pipeline right-of-way through Panmure Alvar, west of Ottawa The completion of this project was a spectacular technological achievement. In the first three years of construction (1956–58), workers installed 3,500 kilometres of pipe, stretching from the Alberta–Saskatchewan border to Toronto and Montreal. Gas service to Regina and Winnipeg commenced in 1957 and the line reached the Lakehead before the end of that year. Building the Canadian Shield leg required continual blasting. For one stretch, the construction crew drilled holes into the rock, three abreast, at 56-centimetre intervals. Dynamite broke up other stretches, at a time. On 10 October 1958, a final weld completed the line and on 27 October, the first Alberta gas entered Toronto. For more than two decades, the TransCanada pipeline was the longest in the world. Only in the early 1980s was its length finally exceeded by a Soviet pipeline from Siberia to Western Europe. Incidents * In late 1957, during a high pressure line test on the section of the line from Winnipeg to Port Arthur (today called Thunder Bay), about five and a half kilometres of pipeline blew up near Dryden. After quick repairs, the line delivered Alberta gas to Port Arthur before the end of the year, making the entire trip on its own wellhead pressure. *On 30 May 1979 an explosion caused evacuations in Englehart, Ontario, about 200 kilometres north of North Bay, Ontario *On 1 December 2003, a rupture in the pipeline occurred at approximately (120 km south of Grande Prairie, Alberta). 14 hours later, another rupture and fire occurred 15 km downstream from the initial incident. According to TransCanada PipeLines, the breaks were immediately isolated, and any already escaped gas was allowed to burn off. *On 20 July 2009, the Peace River Mainline in northern Alberta exploded, sending 50-metre-tall flames into the air and razing a two-hectare wooded area. According to CBC News, reports about the causes and actual extent of the explosion were redacted from a January 2011 government report and were only fully revealed after a media inquiry in 2014.Pipeline rupture report raises questions about TransCanada inspections., CBC, 4 February 2014, Amber Hildebrant.

Boot Hill was TSR's third role- playing game, appearing not long after Dungeons & Dragons and Empire of the Petal Throne, and taking its name from the popular Wild West term for \\"cemetery\\". Boot Hill was marketed to take advantage of America's love of the western genre. The game did feature some new game mechanics, such as the use of percentile dice, but its focus on gunfighting rather than role-playing, as well as the lethal nature of its combat system, limited its appeal. Boot Hill was issued in three editions over 15 years, but it never reached the same level of popularity as D&D; and other fantasy-themed role-playing games. Creative origins First edition cover. Soon after TSR was formed by Gary Gygax and Don Kaye in late 1973, they and new business partner Brian Blume started development of the rules for a Western genre miniatures combat system and role-playing game called Boot Hill. Kaye in particular was an avid supporter of Boot HillKuntz: \\"Don was a great fan of the Western and an avid supporter of the Boot Hill rules.\\" —he was a fan of the Western genre, and even his fantasy D&D; character, Murlynd, was dressed and armed as a cowboy after being magically transported from Gygax's Greyhawk campaign to an alternate universe set in the Wild West. However, Kaye unexpectedly died of a heart attack in January 1975. Blume and Gygax subsequently published Boot Hill later that year in memory of their friend. It was TSR's third role-playing game, after Dungeons and Dragons and Empire of the Petal Throne. David M. Ewalt, in his book Of Dice and Men, described the game as \\"the company's second role-playing game; it was set in the Old West and focused mostly on gun-fighting.\\" System Boot Hill used game mechanics that were advanced for the time. Most games still used traditional six-sided dice, but Boot Hill was one of the first games to use two ten-sided dice as percentile dice for character abilities and skill resolution. However, several factors limited its appeal. * Although the western was a popular American motif, the game did not have the same mass appeal as D&D;'s Tolkienesque fantasy setting. * Boot Hill focused on gunfighting rather than role-playing. The first edition and second editions were specifically marketed as a miniatures combat game, but even in the third edition, most of the rules concerned combat resolution, with relatively little information about settings and few rules for social interaction. * Combat could be short and deadly, with death often coming from the first gunshot. This lethality did not change over time since, unlike D&D; characters, Boot Hill characters did not advance in levels to develop better defenses or advantages over non-player characters; they remained just as likely to die in their hundredth combat as they had been in their first. As a result, most characters had a very short life span, and players generally had little chance to identify with their player character over the long term, as they could with a player character in D&D.; * Unlike D&D;, there was no large catalogue of non-human monsters, only human opponents. In addition, there were no alignment rules, making the difference between the \\"good guys\\" and \\"bad guys\\" a matter of moral interpretation or choice. For these reasons, although Boot Hill was published in three editions, none captured the public imagination in the same way as D&D; Boot Hill remained a very small and limited member of TSR's stable of games.

Dragon Magazine issue 71 features the Boot Hill module \\"The Taming of Brimstone\\" by Donald Mumma which was the winner of a module design contest. Reception In the December-January 1979 edition of White Dwarf, Dominic Beddow reviewed the second (boxed) edition of Boot Hill, and gave it an above average score of 8 out of 10. He found few substantive rule changes from the first edition, other than the addition of several appendices to the rulebook that included biographies of notable American gunfighters, suggested scenarios, and a method for transferring characters to and from other TSR roleplaying systems such as D&D; and Metamorphosis Alpha. Beddow was not impressed by the campaign map, which was \\"by TSR standards, extremely shabby and unprofessional\\", with large blank areas that \\"with their generally lazy attitude towards the map, TSR asks you to fill in numerous details, claiming this 'creates flexibility.'\\" However, he found the large scale map of a generic Western town to be \\"quite commendable\\". Overall, Beddow concluded that Boot Hill is such an \\"Easy yet effective game to play\\" because of \\"the knowledge of, and feeling for, the Wild West which is within all of us. It is fantasy and yet one still has one's feet on the ground.\\" Other recognition A copy of the Boot Hill module Mad Mesa is held in the collection of the Strong National Museum of Play (object 110.1979).

It was written and co-produced by John Hughes and directed by Bryan Gordon. In the film, Whaley plays Jim Dodge, a persuasive but irresponsible kid who lands a job as an overnight janitor at a local Target store. One evening after hours, he finds himself alone with the affluent but mistreated Josie McClellan (Connelly). Hughes chose Bryan Gordon to direct his screenplay after he was impressed with one of Gordon's short films. The movie was shot at a Target store located outside Atlanta. The film grossed $11 million at the box office, and was critically panned. Hughes himself distanced himself from the film, while Connelly expressed disdain for its marketing. Plot Jim Dodge is a self-proclaimed \\"people person\\" and dreamer who is perceived as lazy and good for nothing. After being fired from numerous low-paying jobs, Jim is given the choice by his father, Bud Dodge, to either land a job at the local Target or be put on a bus to St. Louis. Jim is hired as night cleanup boy at Target. On his first shift at his new job, Jim is locked alone in the store by his boss, the head custodian, who leaves him there until his shift ends at 7 am. He encounters Josie McClellan, a stereotypical \\"spoiled rich girl\\" whom he has known all his life. Josie had spent the past several hours asleep in a dressing room after backing out of shoplifting some merchandise in a half- hearted attempt to run away from her abusive father, Roger Roy McClellan. Josie and Jim begin to connect with each other, realizing they are not so different. They begin to form a romantic relationship, and proceed to enjoy the freedom of having such a large store to themselves. Josie, having $52,000 in her purse, convinces Jim to run away with her to California as soon as they get out of the store in the morning. Meanwhile, Roger teams up with the town sheriff to search for his runaway daughter all night. Things become complicated when two incompetent crooks, Nestor Pyle and Gil Kinney, break in and hold the two hostage. Eventually, Josie seduces one of the crooks and convinces him to take her with them after robbing the store. While the criminals are loading stolen merchandise into their car, Josie jumps into the front seat and drives away, leaving the two men stranded in the parking lot. Meanwhile, in the building, Jim loads up a shotgun found in the head custodian's locker and tricks Nestor and Gil by luring them to the back of the store and holding them at gunpoint. In the morning, the sheriff arrives and stumbles upon the two crooks, having been tied up by Jim. Jim and Josie run away and we see them lounging next to a pool in Hollywood California. Cast Production It was the first ever film directed by Bryan Gordon. John Hughes approached him to direct after having been impressed by Gordon's short film, Ray's Male Heterosexual Dance Hall, which won the Oscar in 1987 for Best Live Short. Gordon said he took the job of Career Opportunities to \\"learn about myself and how to make a movie.\\" Frank Whaley, cast in the lead, said his character was \\"a little akin to Ferris Bueller.\\" After a nationwide search, the filmmakers chose the rural area of Monroe, Georgia for the film's locale. The Target store was number T-378, and was located at 4000 Covington Highway in Decatur, just outside of Atlanta. The store had formerly been a Richway location, which was renovated after Target's Southeast expansion in the late 1980s. Whaley went to the location with the director before shooting and \\"looked for bits. So all those little montages, that was stuff that we came up with.\\" He says he and Connelly \\"got along really well and, people remember certain shots from that movie.\\" Principal photography began on November 13, 1989, with an estimated seven-week filming schedule. It was shot over the Christmas holiday shopping season; a writer at the American Film Institute noted that \\"Some store employees remained after hours, and several were chosen to be background actors, while others restocked departments utilized by the production crew.\\" Shooting at night \\"does something to your psyche\\", said Whaley. The filmmakers created an additional \\"Garden of Eden\\" set within the store, designed for an emotional scene between the film's leads. Release =Box office= Career Opportunities was a box office disappointment at the time of its release. It was number four in its first week and made $11,336,986 in the North American market. =Critical response= A trailer used to advertise the film featured Connelly on a riding horse. \\"That wasn't something I felt all that comfortable about\\", Connelly said later. Rolling Stone later wondered if the filmmakers \\"perhaps realizing they had a complete dog of a movie on their hands, attempted to hard-sell the dubious teen flick as some sort of cleavage fanatic's wet dream.\\" Hughes said the film was \\"a disappointment\\" because \\"I didn't have my usual creative controls.\\" Hughes later claimed the film was \\"cheap and vulgar\\" and that his suggestions were ignored. He says he tried to take his name off the film but Universal refused in the wake of the success of Home Alone. \\"Suddenly I'm a commodity\\", he said. \\"If Home Alone hadn't come out my name wouldn't be on Career Opportunities four times.\\" \\"The movie kind of tanked\\", said Whaley. He added: > I think if they made that movie today it would be kind of cool, but it just > lacked a little bit of the reverence of other movies written by John Hughes. > The soundtrack was certainly classic John Hughes fare. I mean, I happen to > think it's kind of a cool movie. I think it's different than his other > movies, and I think that casting me was a daring move. [Laughs.] Because I > didn’t sort of fit into that mold. I played it a little bit different. I was > just… slightly off. And I think that might’ve been part of the demise of the > whole thing. Rotten Tomatoes retrospectively gives the film a score of 38% based on reviews from 16 critics, with an average rating of 4.5 out of 10.

His early years were spent studying at the Catholic Colégio São Pedro. In 1967 he began university coursework in literature at the UFRGS (Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul), but in 1969 interrupted his studies to pursue a career as a journalist in Rio de Janeiro, working for the newspapers Folha da Manhã and Última Hora. In 1970, Noll spent a year in São Paulo working as a copy editor at the publishing house Editora Nacional, but a year later moved back to Rio and resumed both his work in journalism at Última Hora—writing on literature, theater and music—and his university studies in literature, first at the Faculdade Notre Dame and then at the PUC-Rio, where he received his degree in 1979. Noll published his first short story as part of a 1970 Porto Alegre anthology titled Roda de Fogo, but his more formal literary debut came in 1980 when his first book of short stories O cego e a dançarina (English title: The blind man and the dancer) was released, for which he received three literary prizes. One of Noll's short stories from O cego e a dançarina, \\"Alguma coisa urgentemente\\" (\\"Something urgent\\"), was the basis for the film Nunca fomos tão felizes (English title: We've Never Been So Happy) in 1983, directed by Murilo Salles and starring actor Claudio Marzo. Noll received early international attention as a participant in the Writer's Program at the University of Iowa in 1982, and when his work appeared in an anthology of new Brazilian writers published in Germany in 1983. After a short visit to the University of California, Berkeley in 1996, he was invited to teach Brazilian literature there in 1997. He was an invited scholar for a Rockefeller Foundation seminar in Bellagio, Italy, was the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2002, and spent a two-month writing residency at the Centre for the Study of Brazilian Culture & Society at King's College London in 2004. All of these experiences were to shape the subject matter of later works. His first collection of stories was followed by the novels A fúria do corpo (1981), Bandoleiros (1985) and Rastros do Verão (1986). Two of his subsequent and perhaps best-known works, the novels Hotel Atlântico (1989) and Harmada (1993), later came out in a 1997 English edition, translated by David Treece and published by Boulevard Books in London. Another novel, titled O quieto animal da esquina, appeared in 1991. From 1998 to 2001 Noll published a twice- weekly series of short stories in the major São Paulo daily Folha de S.Paulo, and in 2004 he began to publish longer stories every two weeks in the daily Correio Braziliense, published in the federal capital, Brasília. His most recent works include the novels A céu aberto (1996), Canoas e Marolas (1999), Berkeley em Bellagio (2002), Lorde (2004), and Acenos e afagos (2008), as well as the collections of short stories Mínimos múltiplos comuns (2003) and A máquina de ser (2006).

The film argues that sexually explicit materials corrupt young viewers and readers, leading to acts of violence and \\"perverted\\" attitudes regarding sex—including inclination toward homosexuality. Although Perversion for Profit was serious in its suggestion that pornography could erode the integrity of American culture, Peter L. Stein of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote in a 2003 review that it was \\"shrill and sometimes comical\\". Today, Perversion for Profit is in the public domain, and it has become popular on the Prelinger Archives website and on YouTube. As Peter L. Stein observes in an article for the San Francisco Chronicle, however, the film also has considerable historical significance, serving as a sort of time capsule of pornography from the era as well as an example of historical concerns regarding media influence: > ... as the parade of girlie magazine covers, men's physique pictorials and > campy S&M; leaflets continues, the film betrays a kind of prurience the > filmmakers could hardly have intended. What results is a remarkable visual > record of midcentury underground literature and sexual appetites, and a > gloss on the values of the society that condemned them. At the time the Chronicle article was written, Perversion was the Prelinger Archive's second most popular download, superseded only by the well-known Cold War film Duck and Cover. Like Stein, ephemeral film scholar Rick Prelinger, founder of the Archive, views such films as illuminating historical documents or what he calls \\"unofficial evidence of everyday life\\". Summary In 1965, Putnam narrated Perversion for Profit, in which he warned viewers about magazines containing nudity and homosexual material, saying gay people were \\"perverted\\" and \\"misfits\\", as well as implying they were child molesters, and that they weakened U.S. \\"resistance to the Communist masters of deceit.\\" The film was financed by Charles Keating. Allusions Putnam erroneously cites the Supreme Court as having declared adult publications, \\"Dirt for dirt's sake.\\" In actuality, that quote was from New York Court of Appeals judge John F. Scileppi and was in reference to Henry Miller's Tropic of Cancer. To support his position, Putnam refers to \\"Dr. [Pitirim] Sorokin, the renowned Harvard sociologist,\\" a Russian-American who founded Harvard's Sociology department and served as the American Sociological Association's 55th president. To exemplify corrupting literature, Putnam reads a passage from the pulp fiction novel Sex Jungle (1960) by Don Elliot, a pseudonym for novelist Robert Silverberg. In a 2000 interview, Silverberg explained that the erotic fiction that he published under the Don Elliot pseudonym ... > ... was undertaken at a time when I was saddled with a huge debt, at the age > of 26, for a splendid house that I had bought. There would have been no way > to pay the house off by writing science fiction in that long-ago era, when > $2500 was a lot to earn from a novel that might take months to write, so I > turned out a slew of quick sex novels. I never concealed the fact that I was > doing them; it made no difference at all to me whether people knew or not. > It was just a job. And it was, incidentally, a job that I did very well. I > think they were outstanding erotic novels. Quotes Broadcast Turner Classic Movies has televised the film Saturday nights on its TCM Underground block.

Football career A defender, mainly at right-back, Hiley first came through the Exeter City youth system in 1986. He was a key part of Exeter's Fourth Division-winning side of 1989–90, and in 1993 he followed manager Terry Cooper to Birmingham City. Hiley spent three injury-hit years with Birmingham, and in February 1996 was a surprise loan signing for Premiership side Manchester City. Two months later the move was made permanent, but he found first-team opportunities limited and sat in the reserves for two years as City slid down the leagues. In August 1998 he returned to the Premiership with Southampton (where Terry Cooper was working in a scouting role), and spent 18 months there, before joining rival club Portsmouth in December 1999. He was a popular player at Portsmouth, captaining the side and winning the player of the year award in his first full season, but the team was not successful. When Harry Redknapp was appointed manager in 2002, he cleared out most of the old squad and built a new team. While Portsmouth won the First Division title, Hiley returned to Exeter in November for his second spell. He was one of the club's better players in the 2002–03 season, but he couldn't stop the side being relegated from the Football League. He remained with Exeter after relegation and, in 2003, joined the coaching staff. He continued to be a first-team regular until October 2005. During his second spell at Exeter, Hiley played for them in the FA Cup against Manchester United and became somewhat of a local hero when he nutmegged Cristiano Ronaldo. In August 2004 he scored his first goal in more than 10 years as Exeter beat Northwich Victoria 2–1. Hiley left the club in February 2006 when his contract was terminated by mutual consent; he had spent over 10 years at St James Park in his two spells with the Grecians and had started almost 400 games for the club. In August 2006, he was signed by Crawley Town after a successful pre-season trial period. He left the club after a year. In September 2008, he signed for Tiverton Town after being brought to Ladysmead by manager Martyn Rogers as cover for what had proven over the 2007 season to be an injury-jinxed right-back spot. He also featured a few times for Cullompton Rangers during the 2008–09 season.

It is a noncommercial station owned and operated by Way FM Media Group, broadcasting their WAY-FM Network programming. History Occupying Room 301 in Olmsted Administration Building for its entire run, WJWA was first known as WEVC when it was built in 1950. Before that time, Evansville College maintained a radio broadcasting program through an agreement with 1280 WGBF, a local radio station. On March 31, 1951, WEVC went onto the air for the first time at 10 watts, monaural, at 91.5 MHz. It ran programming two hours a day, five days a week. By 1975, stereo equipment was purchased by a benefit held at Mesker Amphitheatre in Evansville featuring Ted Nugent. On January 1, 1977, WEVC became WUEV to reflect the new University of Evansville name (The Buzzard (aka) \\"Skipper T.\\" Spence, along with, then, director; Dr. Gil Clarity announced the change at midnight). By 1984, WUEV had increased power from 3000 to 6100 watts and was renovated in 1988. Programming shifted over the years to reflect a more progressive format, and the station continued to serve the needs of the Evansville community and UE students. Through the help of an Ameritech Innovations grant in the winter of 1996, Len Clark and Phil Bailey, then the General Manager and Chief Engineer at WUEV respectively, established the Internet Center at WUEV to stream the terrestrial signal heard in Evansville to the world. A Xing Streamworks encoder and server were procured and installed, and the audio lines from the control studio were run into a little-used back corner of the WUEV newsroom. WUEV simulcasted for the first time on January 16, 1996. On July 30, 1997, WUEV opened the Harlaxton Bureau at Harlaxton College, Lincolnshire, England. Shortly thereafter, Harlaxton Bureau correspondents covered the death of Princess Diana and were subsequently recognized by the Indiana Society of Professional Journalists. By the fall of 1998, WUEV had purchased and installed additional streaming equipment and started research into branding and educational uses for streaming media technology. On hand in the fall of 1998 were: *A Windows NT server, \\"RealAudio\\", to encode and stream the RealAudio stream. *A Windows NT server, \\"Xing\\", formerly used for the Streamworks encoding, then used to stream the Microsoft Netshow (now Windows Media Technologies) stream. *A Telos Audioactive encoder for the Microsoft stream. *An Oak server loaded with UNIX for serving the Xing Streamworks stream, used for dead storage and experimentation with Linux/UNIX streaming protocols. *A DR-10 telephone switcher used for switching audio signals. *Various compression, limiting, and gating terminals. The Internet gave WUEV great opportunities to share many things to the world. WUEV carried the World Radio Network signal from WRN-1, North America, during the early morning hours and into the early afternoon. Before the noon news, the station operator at the time would spool up one of several pre-recorded syndicated shows. After the noon news, on-air talent would take over until 1 or 2 a.m., when the station operator would switch back to WRN-1. Thus, anyone listening to WUEV in the late 1990s could hear anything from progressive rock to metal, from jazz to hip-hop, news to sports, anywhere in the world. Before the launch of the Internet Center, the only source for University of Evansville Men's basketball coverage was local sources inside Evansville, particularly Adam Alexander on WKDQ. Evansville basketball was not broadcast anywhere outside of the area. WUEV did not air UE basketball through their terrestrial signal at that time, either. But, they could carry basketball on the internet. A DR-10 telephone switcher was purchased and wired into the Internet Center by Bailey, so that Clark and the field broadcast team could call the UE toll-free number, reach the proper extension, and switch the internet broadcast signal from the control room's input line to a Marti or Comdex input line. Listeners could now \\"tune in\\" to the internet broadcast. When the game was over, someone would call back and switch the signal back to the terrestrial feed. With WUEV's new foray into the world of internet radio, Clark made a key partnership with the Missouri Valley Conference to offer a sports broadcasting workshop in conjunction with the annual conference Men's Basketball Tournament in St. Louis, MO. Students from the MVC schools would do the play-by-play and color while their teams were on the floor at the tournament. At the same time, WUEV engineers investigated new ways of bringing the experience to the Internet listener. Webcams were purchased and taken to every home basketball game. It was little more than a half-court shot of the action due to the bandwidth, but it was progress towards something new. A Diamond Rio MP3 player was purchased and taken to every remote broadcast, and once the signal was switched from terrestrial to remote feed, Clark or the field engineer would run the commercial breaks live in the field. It became possible to run an entire broadcast from the field without the assistance of the control booth or the station. Roughly around the spring of 2000, WUEV began to experiment with the Icecast streaming technology for the terrestrial signal by using a testbed of MP3 songs on the local server. As early as 1999, student producers at the station were using MP3 encoded songs during live sessions in the on-air studio, and attempts were made to create playlists using MusicMatch and a computer for automation. However, much was not known about the technology and hardware constraints severely limited automation until the new automation system was installed. According to the WUEV website, broadcast facilities were upgraded from analog to digital in 2003. A full automation system was installed, and more sports broadcast equipment was purchased. By 2004, WUEV had fully moved into offering Shoutcast streaming capability and had adopted a Dell rack mount system. WUEV was in jeopardy early in 2006 when the University of Evansville administration were recipients of an offer to buy out the station by an undisclosed bidder. The receipt of the offer was announced on 31 January 2006 in AceNotes (the University's daily email to its students, staff, faculty and other members of the university community) along with a request for reader input. This prompted concerned alumni and students to a major grassroots campaign to protest the sale of the station and its operating bandwidth. According to local sources, including the University Crescent, over 400 letters were received on the subject, with an overwhelming majority against the proposed sale. In fact, according to every news report, the University of Evansville never offered one letter that supported the sale nor provided an example of anyone stating they were in favor of the sale. On 9 February 2006, President Stephen Jennings announced that the offer would be rejected, giving administration time to evaluate and change the way that WUEV has been managed on campus. After an unspecified time, the station would be re-evaluated for viability and options would again be considered. In January 2009, WUEV moved from its original location in Olmsted 301 to a new home on the second floor in the new Ridgway University Center. The new station included a much larger productions studio, storage, and \\"The Fishbowl\\", the DJ booth with a large window for passers-by to view the inside of the studio. With more room, the station planned on hosting more in-studio interviews and live performances. The station's musical format was dayparted. Overnights and daytime hours were devoted to jazz, branded as \\"JazzFlight.\\" In the early evenings, current pop music was played. Later, the station went to rock or dance. On Saturdays, WUEV aired blues, and Sundays it ran Christian music. UE students program much of the broadcast day. Sale of WUEV to WAY-FM On May 17, 2019, the University of Evansville made what members of the Evansville community claimed to be controversial decision to sell the students' station to WAY-FM, a non-profit nationwide network that plays contemporary Christian music.https://www.thegleaner.com/story/news/2019/05/17/its-official-ue- selling-wuev-radio-christian-broadcast-network/3707344002/ UE President Chris M.

The terrestrial signal went silent at 11 pm CST. The final song played on WUEV was \\"Closing Time\\" by Semisonic. The station began broadcasting WAY-FM programming on November 26, 2019, and changed its call sign to WJWA on December 4, 2019.

Rooks had commissioned Coleman to compose music for the film, but his score, which has become known as the Chappaqua Suite, was not used. Ravi Shankar then composed a score. The picture has become a cult film. Plot The film briefly depicts Chappaqua, New York, a hamlet in Westchester County, in a few minutes of wintry panoramas. In the film, the hamlet is an overt symbol of drug-free suburban childhood innocence. It also serves as one of the film's many nods to Native American culture.

Each volume in the series chronicled a specific year in country music, from 1950 through 1972, and was issued on a double-length compact disc or cassette, or two vinyl albums. Individual volumes contained 24 tracks, usually representing the year's most popular and important songs. Also included was a booklet, containing liner notes written by some of the most respected historians of the genre, photographs of the artists, and information on the songs (writers, performers and peak position on Billboard magazine's country charts). All told, the entire series contains 553 tracks. History \\"Country USA\\" was first issued during the summer of 1988, and is patterned after Time- Life's successful \\"Rock'n'Roll Era\\" and \\"Your Hit Parade\\" series. It represented Time-Life's first real attempt at chronicling country music's post-1950 history; earlier in the 1980s, Time-Life had a budget \\"Country Series\\" and the later \\"Country & Western Classics.\\" During its peak, the \\"Country USA\\" series was advertised in television and magazine advertisements. The series was available by subscription (by calling a 1-800 number); those who purchased the series in that fashion received a new volume roughly every other month (on the format of their choice), and had the option of keeping just the volumes they wanted. Each volume was also offered for individual sale. New volumes continued to be issued through 1991. Another series, \\"Contemporary Country,\\" essentially picked up where \\"Country USA\\" left off, as that series covered the 1970s through early 1990s. Time-Life continued to offer \\"Country USA\\" through the early first decade of the 21st century. The series has essentially been replaced by \\"Classic Country.\\" Three newer series — \\"Country Gold,\\" \\"Superstars of Country\\" and \\"Lifetime of Country Romance\\" — have also since been issued. Critics widely hailed \\"Country USA\\" as a definitive overview of the genre during what some refer to as the Golden Age. In many cases, the songs offered on each volume represented the first time they had ever been re-released on compact disc. However, critics tempered their praise by pointing out a few minor faults, such as the exclusion of some tracks (in lieu of songs that weren't necessarily hits) and alternate versions/re-recordings of some hits. =The series= The track listings below represent the sequencing on the compact discs.

It is located 50 kilometres east of Lodwar and 40 kilometres south of Kalokol. The local springs for which it is named produce lush vegetation along its section of the otherwise barren lakeshore, and support a community of about 5000 people with fresh drinking water. However, due to neglect, the spring's water has been found to have ecoli and other harmful agents. Hotel Room At Eliye Springs Resort On Lake Turkana Around 1981 there was a hunting lodge on the side of the lake made up of a series of grass huts and very basic facilities. By 1982 this fell into disrepair and the owner left but some staff remained hoping to collect unpaid wages. The huts provided refuge for intrepid travellers who enjoyed the clear warm waters and sunsets. Food had to be bought in Lodwar and the journey to Eliye Springs in 1982 took about 2 hours. The Lodge has since been placed under new management and attracts a growing clientele of tourists to the beautiful non-humid white sand beach. A sand surface airstrip nearby supports small chartered aircraft. Early Human History and Cradle Of Mankind A Skull of very early human ancestry called \\"Homo heidelbergensis\\" dating between 200,000 and 300,000 years old with Exhibit Item Number \\"Eliye Springs ES11693\\" can be found at the Smithsonian Institution. In a preliminary report (Brauer & Leakey, 1986), the new fossil cranium KNM-ES-11693 from Eliye Springs at the western shore of Lake Turkana was presented as a further representative of archaic Homo sapiens : \\"The specimen comes from reworked deposits which exclude its being stratigraphically located. However, in spite of the dating problems, the well preserved and heavily mineralized fossil exhibits many morphological features by which it can be assigned to archaic Homo sapiens\\". ES-11693 is compared to African early and late archaic Homo sapiens. Although the new hominid presents a unique mosaic of archaic and modern features, it appears to have a closer relationship with the late archaic H. sapiens grade, in which such hominids as Omo 2 and Laetoli H. 18 can also be grouped.

Of all of Schwartz's stories, it is probably his best-known and most influential. Background and publishing history Schwartz's biographer, James Atlas, wrote a thorough account of the story's genesis: > Schwartz wrote \\"In Dreams Begin Responsibilities\\" over a July weekend in > 1935, when he was only twenty-one. A day later, his friend William Barrett > appeared at the boarding house off Washington Square where Schwartz was > living that summer and found the author ecstatic; he knew he had written a > masterpiece, a verdict later confirmed by Vladimir Nabokov, who singled [the > story] out as one of his \\"half a dozen favorites\\" in contemporary American > literature. The story was first published in 1937 in the first issue of Partisan Review. A year later it was published in Schwartz's first book of poems and stories which was also entitled In Dreams Begin Responsibilities. The title came from the Irish poet W. B. Yeats' 1914 volume of poems Responsibilities, which has an epigraph \\"In dreams begins responsibility,\\" attributed to an \\"Old play.\\" The story has been available in print since the author's death in two posthumously published collections of Schwartz's work, In Dreams Begin Responsibilities and Other Stories (1978) and Screeno: Stories and Poems (2004). In a 2003 review of In Dreams Begin Responsibilities and Other Stories that appeared in The Observer, Jason Cowley wrote, \\"[Schwartz] never wrote a finer story than 'Dreams'.\\" Plot summary The story tells of an unnamed young man who has a dream that he is in an old-fashioned movie theater in 1909. As he sits down to watch the film, he starts to realize that it is a motion picture documenting his parents' courtship. The black-and-white silent film is of very poor quality, and the camera is shaky, but nonetheless he is engrossed. Soon the young man starts to get upset. He yells things at the screen, trying to influence the outcome of his parents' courtship and the other people in the audience begin to think he is crazy. Several times the character breaks down. In the end he shouts at his parents when it appears they are going to break up, and he is dragged out of the theater by an usher who reprimands him. In the end, the character wakes up from his dream and notes that it is the snowy morning of his twenty-first birthday.

Structure =Lateral side of the leg= Deep peroneal nerve is the nerve of the anterior compartment of the leg and the dorsum of the foot. It is one of the terminal branches of the common peroneal nerve. It corresponds to the posterior interosseus nerve of the forearm. It begins at the lateral side of the fibula bone, and then enters the anterior compartment by piercing the anterior intermuscular septum. It then pierces the extensor digitorum longus and lies next to the anterior tibial artery, following the course of the artery until the ankle-joint where the nerve divides into medial and lateral terminal branches. In the leg, the deep peroneal nerve divides into several branches: * Muscular branches - supplies four muscles in the leg: tibialis anterior, extensor hallucis longus, extensor digitorum longus, and peroneous tertius =Foot= Close to the ankle joint, deep peroneal nerve terminates by dividing into medial and lateral terminal branches. * Medial terminal branch - This nerve accompanies the dorsalis pedis artery along the dorsum of the foot, and, at the first interosseous space, divides into two dorsal digital nerves which supply the adjacent sides of the great and second toes, communicating with the medial dorsal cutaneous branch of the superficial peroneal nerve. Before it divides it gives off to the first space an interosseous branch which supplies the metatarsophalangeal joint of the great toe and sends a filament to the first Interosseous dorsalis muscle. * Lateral terminal branch - This nerve passes across the tarsus, beneath the extensor digitorum brevis, supplying latter. This nerve ends in a pseudoganglion deep to the extensor digitorum brevis. From the pseudoganglion, three minute branches are given off to supply the tarsal joints and the metatarsophalangeal joints of the second, third, and fourth toes. Function In the leg, the deep peroneal nerve supplies muscular branches to the anterior compartment of extensor muscles in the leg which include the tibialis anterior, extensor digitorum longus, peroneus tertius, and extensor hallucis longus (propius), and an articular branch to the ankle-joint. After its bifurcation past the ankle joint, the lateral branch of the deep peroneal nerve innervates the extensor digitorum brevis and the extensor hallucis brevis, while the medial branch goes on to provide cutaneous innervation to the webbing between the first and second digits. Clinical significance Damage to the deep peroneal nerve, as is possible with traumatic injury to the lateral knee, results in foot drop. The deep peroneal nerve is also subject to injury resulting from lower motor neuron disease, diabetes, ischemia, and infectious or inflammatory conditions. Injury to the common peroneal nerve is the most common isolated mononeuropathy of the lower extremity and produces sensory problems on the lateral lower leg in addition to foot drop.

Facilities included an engine house, telegraph station, water tank, turntable and some ancillary residences and eating houses. With the Cascade Range to the north and the Green River to the south, Weston was disadvantageously located for future expansion. In 1891-2, the Northern Pacific moved its western helper terminus approximately four miles to the west at a point it designated Lester, Washington. Weston was unique in that the Northern Pacific, crossing the Green River twice, also created a short cut-off line at Weston, creating a complete loop. (Further to the east, approaching the summit of Stampede Pass, the Northern Pacific's engineers alignment created what came to be known as the Borup Loop [so named for the telegraph station located at the center of the loop—Borup, Washington], this however was a misnomer, as the alignment is actually an elongated S-curve created by back-to-back horseshoes.) Weston lasted as a small telegraph station (one story, twenty by thirty feet) and water stop on the Northern Pacific until c. 1915, when double tracking of Stampede Pass between Lester and Easton (sans the summit tunnel area itself) completely replaced the Weston Loop and Weston.

Diani is one of the most prominent tourism resort areas of Kenya. The indigenous people of the area are the Digo, one of the nine ethnic communities known as the Mijikenda. Today the area includes Kenyans of various ethnicities who have migrated to Diani, drawn by the tourism related economy. With a population of over 100,000 inhabitants, the Diani/Ukunda urban area is one of the largest at the Kenyan coast and forms part of the larger Mombasa metropolitan region. A small airstrip - Ukunda Airport - is located between the beach area and the Mombasa-Lunga Lunga road. The water remains shallow near shore, with some underwater sandbars near the surface which allow wading with a clear view of the sandy bottom. Inland from the beach, there is extensive vegetation (see photo at right), including numerous palm trees which cover the coastal areas, unlike the dry acacia trees of the mountainous Kenyan Highlands.

Shimoni & Wasini  General Information  Downtown in Shimoni on a bright Saturday afternoonThis small town is known for its British colonial ruins and slave caves which are the focus of attraction for several community-based projects. In addition, the Shimoni forest, coast, and marine ecosystems are an ever- present attraction. Therefore, it is no surprise that Kenya Wildlife Service's headquarters for the Kisite-Mpunguti Marine Protected Area is located in Shimoni. One of Shimoni's well-kept mosques In certain seasons, the aromatic smell of cloves permeates the evening calls to prayer in the town's two main mosques. Still, Shimoni is a relatively religiously diverse area, with a substantial minority of Christians. Additionally, the villagers are aware of the benefits behind the tourism industry and thus are often very gracious and welcoming to tourists. Many villagers own and operate businesses that cater to tourists. However, the majority of the population still relies heavily upon traditional fishing, subsistence farming, and exploiting forest resources. Shopping in Shimoni: Besides gift shops in and around the Shimoni's tourist attractions, shops such as Shikoo's Shop, located along the main road, offer excellent quality kikois, paintings, bags, and dresses Currently, Shimoni, while rural, still has access to electricity and wireless internet (which is not free). While there are no banks or ATMs in Shimoni, there are four M-PESA agents along the main roads and one post office. Additionally, there is a new internet cafe that was established in early April, 2012, called Bum Bum's. Bum Bum's uses an eithernet connection with 4 computers. It also offers a wireless connection and access to a web cam upon request. While several wells exist in the village, and bottled water is often sold in the dukas and shops along the main roads, Shimoni lacks a reliable supply of fresh water. Shimoni Post Office, Kenya There are at least five schools in Shimoni: Matunda Bora (Meaning, 'Good Fruit,' in Swahili), Shimoni Primary School, Base Academy, Shining Star Academy and Shimoni Secondary School. There is a Deaf school, \\"Kichakamkwaju Unit for the Deaf\\" located about 4 km north from Shimoni village, located in the Kichakamkwaju Primary School compound. Both are administered by the Kenya Ministry of Education. A dormitory building provides eight sewing machines, and are sponsored by Kenya Kesho, Go See Kenya and Charlie Claw's.  History  Starting in the 1750s, Shimoni, along with Malindi, Mombasa and other coastal cities and towns, was a primary, 'slave holding port,' for east Africa's coastal slave trade which reached from South Africa to the Middle East. These slave holding pens were located in the natural cave systems that exist in Shimoni. Currently, visitors are granted access to the Shimoni Slave Caves during the guided tour by members of the Shimoni Slave Cave Committee. Shimoni Slave Cave Sign In 1857, the British parliament enacted an international ban on the slave trade. In the 1870s, British parliament was successful in convincing Barghash ibn Sa'id, the Sultan of Zanzibar, to acknowledge the ban. This edict choked the trafficking of slaves to and from Zanzibar, effectively cutting off Shimoni's relevance in the slave trade. chai and listen to music In the 1880s, British colonialism began in Shimoni with the arrival of the British Imperial East Africa Company's headquarters. The British Imperial East Africa Company choose Shimoni because it was virtually uninhabited at the time. Many other buildings in Shimoni were built by the very first British colonists of Kenya, including Kenya's first colonial prison (now in ruins). The first senior staff residence headquarters to be built by the Imperial British East Africa Company in the south coast in 1885 Over time it has developed from a sleepy fishing village to become the main port of clearance for oceangoing trade Dhows arriving from as far away as the Arab states of the Persian Gulf, the island of Zanzibar and Dar es Salaam.  Conservation  Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS), in cooperation with privately owned tour dhow operators, try to work together on maintaining and caring for the dolphins that are sighted often within the Wasini Channel, the park, and reserve. Sign at the Shimoni jetty indicating the standards and protocols in order to prevent harm or disruption to the natural processes and behavior of local marine wildlife. Apart from the Kenya Wildlife Service, there are several community-based organizations in Shimoni that make an effort to raise awareness about maintaining and fostering the health of the coral reef, forest & marine wildlife. The Shimoni forest is a coastal forest which features jagged, jumbled fossilized coral substrate that is naturally found in the soil. Often referred to as 'coral rag.' It is often mined for building construction projects in and around the village. Most homes in Shimoni are built with mined coral from around the area Over the past ten years, 70% of the Shimoni forest has been depleted through human activity exploiting its resources. As a result, Friends of Shimoni Forest (FSF) is a conservation organization that works to save the Shimoni Forest from deforestation and land encroachment. FSF raises funds through leading Eco-Trail tours and their gift shop. Mangrove trees cover the shores along Shimoni and nearby coastal towns SEA is also a conservation organization that focuses upon improving the ways in which the community utilizes materials. Currently, SEA has been developing eco-friendly alternatives to charcoal. Charcoal pits are quite common to see in the Shimoni forest; villagers and outside laborers travel to the interior of the forest in order to cut down trees for charcoal. This behavior is an ever-present threat to the forest. In an effort to reduce deforestation, SEA works to create alternative charcoal. Using materials such as coconut shells and paper, SEA creates eco-friendly equivalents to charcoal. Mangrove trees play a large role in maintaining and preserving Shimoni coastal habitats.  Health  Shimoni has a relatively well-equipped public dispensary with an approved Public Health Officer to provide exams and vaccinations. The dispensary is also office to an organization called SAFE Shimoni. The Shimoni Public DispensarySAFE Shimoni is an active, dynamic health outreach organization of about 30 individuals (men and women) that travel to schools and community centers in/around Shimoni in an effort to educate and raise awareness. Topics include: hygiene, tuberculosis, puberty, post- and pre-natal health, hospital aftercare, safe sex, Hepatitis B, and HIV/AIDS. Many members of SAFE Shimoni are community health workers based at the dispensary and two members have been trained in emergency first response.  Tourism  The Shimoni slave caves used by slave traders up until the 19th century are now a tourist attraction. Shimoni Slave Caves Office Shimoni Slave Caves Gift Shop The Shimoni Slave Cave tours are one of the primary attractions for Shimoni. It is a historical site and restaurant.

History  Hell's Gate National Park is named after a narrow break in the cliffs, once a tributary of a prehistoric lake that fed early humans in the Rift Valley. It received the name \\"Hell's Gate\\" by explorers Fisher and Thomson in 1883. In the early 1900s, Mount Longonot erupted, and ash can still be felt around Hell's Gate. The park was officially established in 1984.  Geography  left Fischer's Tower Hell's Gate National Park covers an area of , relatively small by African standards. The park is at above sea level. It is within Nakuru County, near Lake Naivasha and approximately from Nairobi. The park is located after the turnoff from the old Nairobi-Naivasha highway, and has a warm and dry climate. Olkaria and Hobley's, two extinct volcanoes located in the park, can be seen as well as obsidian forms from the cool molten lava. Within Hell's Gate is the Hells Gate Gorge, lined with red cliffs which contain two volcanic plugs: Fischer's Tower and Central Tower. Off of Central Tower is a smaller gorge which extends to the south, with a path that descends into hot springs that have rocks hot enough to cause burns, and sulfuric water.Hodd, 153.  Wildlife  There is a wide variety of wildlife in the national park, though few in number. Examples of little seen wildlife include lions, leopards, and cheetahs. However, the park has historically been an important home for the rare lammergeyer vultures. There are over 103 species of birds in the park, including vultures, Verreaux's eagles, augur buzzard, and swifts. Hyraxes, African buffalo, zebra, eland, hartebeest, Thomson's gazelle, hyena, and baboons are also common.

Tourism  Tourist safari road The park is popular due to its close proximity to Nairobi and lowered park fees compared to other National Parks. Hiking, bicycling, motorcycling and even camping are encouraged within the park, one of only two Kenyan national parks where this is allowed. The Daily Nation praised the mountain climbing in Hell's Gate as \\"thrilling.\\" It also recommended the Joy Adamson's Centre and boating on Lake Naivasha. A Maasai Cultural Center provides education about the Maasai tribe's culture and traditions. The park is equipped with three basic campsites, camping is safe in the park even though there are no guns or fencing between you and wildlife. There are also several lodges around Naivasha Lake, popular among tourists for watersports, bird and game viewing in private ranches and walks along Crescent Island, Crater Lake, and Mt. Longonot.

It was used primarily by those who were opposed to the Vietnam War, but has been invoked in other anti-war contexts since, around the world. The \\"Make love\\" part of the slogan often referred to the practice of free love that was growing among the American youth who denounced marriage as a tool for those who supported war and favored the traditional capitalist culture.Emma Goldman:People & Events: Free Love PBS.org, Accessed February 3, 2014 The phrase's origins are unknown. Several people claimed to be the inventor of the phrase, including Gershon LegmanDudar, H., \\"Love and death (and schmutz): G.

Radical activists Penelope and Franklin Rosemont and Tor Faegre assisted in popularizing the phrase by printing thousands of \\"Make Love, Not War\\" buttons at the Solidarity Bookshop in Chicago, Illinois and distributing them at the Mother's Day Peace March in 1965. They were reportedly the first to print the slogan.Rosemont, Penelope. Dreams and Everyday Life: A Sixties Notebook. Chicago: Charles H. Kerr, 2008:40-41. However, historian Ben Truwe, who studied the matter, has claimed that the phrase actually first published in an article written by New York Times Magazine journalist Mitchel Levitas. It has also been acknowledged that the Chicago Mother's Day peace march where Penelope and Franklin Rosemont distributed \\"Make Love, Not War\\" buttons occurred in May 1965, the month after a person discussed in the New York Times article had written the slogan for an anti-war rally. In April 1965, at a Vietnam demonstration in Eugene, Oregon, Diane Newell Meyer, then a senior at the University of Oregon, pinned a handwritten note on her sweater reading \\"Let's make love, not war\\", thus marking the beginning of the popularity of this phrase. A picture of Meyer wearing the slogan was printed in the Eugene Register-Guard, after which a related article turned up in The New York Times on May 9, 1965.

It follows Jemmy Bloocher's exploration of Destiny's Road, a long scar of once-melted rock seared onto the planet's surface by a spaceship's fusion drive. Jemmy is descended from the original Destiny colonists, who were stranded when their landing craft (which created the Road) deserted them. The novel takes place in the same universe of the novel The Legacy of Heorot. Back story The novel is set several hundred years in the future, on an Earth-like planet named Destiny, along a length of fused bedrock known as the Road. The Road was created to enable humans to survive on the planet, as its native life is not nutritious to Earth life—and vice versa. By sterilizing a peninsula with the ship's fusion engines and seeding the cleansed ground with Earth plant life, along with the burials of dead colonists (colloquially known as lifegivers, as they were always buried with a tree as a headstone), a self-sustaining near-analogue of Earth's ecosystem was created. At first, the colony prospered. Native viruses and bacteria are unable to infect colonists; disease is nonexistent and wounds cannot become infected, resulting in longer lifespans. Sea life quickly recovered and is consumed by the colonists as a \\"diet\\" food, as their digestive systems are unable to metabolize it into fat. But the key word in near-analogue turned out to be near. The planet's biosphere almost completely lacks potassium. A diet lacking in potassium causes decreased intelligence in humans, which can be permanent if it is not remedied quickly—especially if this occurs during childhood. If one is denied it for too long, death always results (though in reality, potassium deficiency is more likely to result in death before mental retardation). The reason for this lack is thus: potassium is as lethal to Destiny life as arsenic is to Earth life, and eons earlier, a form of sea life evolved the ability to concentrate potassium as a defense against predation. However, when sea life dies, its remains are deposited on the ocean floor. Ultimately, most of the element was thus leached out of the planet's ecosystem, concentrating it there. After that, volcanic activity was the only process that reintroduced potassium into the ecosystem. Having thus discovered the lack of potassium in Destiny's biosphere, the crew of the Cavorite landing craft took the ship to search for a volcano from which to harvest potassium. However, Destiny is a far, far older planet than Earth, and is much less tectonically active: They could find only a single major volcano. But on that volcano—the future site of the Windfarm—they had an astounding stroke of luck. They found speckles, an indigenous plant that had adapted to concentrate potassium as a defense against predation, making complex extraction of the element unnecessary. Even so, upon the ship's return to Spiral Town, they found they were too late. Everyone had succumbed to devastating cases of potassium deficiency; all had suffered severe mental retardation, and a great many were dead. The human gene pool on Destiny had been dangerously small from the beginning—more than half of the colonists had died from hibernation- related complications during the trip to the planet, and now more had died of potassium deficiency. The colony would now inbreed itself to extinction unless drastic measures were taken. The crew decided to use their new-found monopoly on potassium (which the novel discusses as an example of a hydraulic empire) to coerce the colonists into a new social order: they began traveling from town to town as mysterious and well-armed merchants, trading speckles for various goods and services—including sexual favors. Colonial women were impregnated by male merchants, and colonial men impregnated female merchants. By subjecting themselves to constant genetic scrutiny (to the point of charting their genealogies like horses), the merchants were thus able to eventually return the colony's gene pool to relative stability. By then, the merchants had become accustomed to the new social order, or to be more precise, their position at the top of it. What had been visualized as a temporary measure then became permanent. Plot summary At the start of the novel, the main character, Jemmy (he changes his name several times over the course of the novel) is around age 10. The novel then proceeds to skip through time in the various sections of the book including his teenage and young adult years, ending when he is in his forties. At first, he lives in his birthplace, Spiral Town, at one end of the Road—no one there knows what lies beyond a short distance down the Road. Jemmy's adventures begin as a late adolescent when, in self-defense, he kills someone working for the merchants and is forced to flee Spiral Town. He winds up a distance down the road in a fishing community where he changes his name and appearance, and becomes a cook. He marries into the population. When a different caravan comes through town from Spiral Town, they arrange with the village elders to hire Jemmy as a chef. He proceeds on the caravan to the Neck, the isthmus which joins the peninsula to the mainland from which the caravans come. No locals, like Jemmy, are permitted on the mainland. At the Neck, Jemmy is told he must return to his town on the next caravan—the same one he fled Spiral Town from. He instead flees by sea. Taking refuge on a boat left over from the time of Landing, he floats around the peninsula to a point beyond the Neck. There, in a storm, he goes ashore and is found by prisoners at the Windfarm—sentenced prisoners who farm speckles. All speckles come from the area and are rendered infertile by irradiation; the monopoly is rigorously maintained. The others use clothing that Jemmy has salvaged to plot an escape, led by the violent Andrew. They break out and evade pursuit. Andrew has planned all along to kill Jemmy, but Jemmy literally gets the drop on him and kills him in self-defense. Jemmy leaves the other prisoners, taking money they have found and a supply of speckles, and flees once again. Twenty-seven years later, Jemmy is a pit chef at a beach resort along the Road. His wife is burned in an accident and he is forced to leave his place—a place, as it turns out, of hiding. He finally reaches his lifetime's goal of seeing the other end of the Road, and Destiny Town. There, he is able to access the Cavorites computer library and learn the true history of Destiny, a discovery which hardens him. After his wife dies from a freak drug interaction during her burn treatment, Jemmy takes his father-in-law's widow Harlow back to the site of the prisoners' hideout, where he had planted fertile speckles. They still survive, and he takes some, sharing the secret with Harlow. They then return to the beach resort, of which Jemmy, by his wife's death, is now part owner. The two contrive to join a caravan, and Jeremy returns as a merchant's chef, unknown to his former townsfolk, to Spiral Town. During the trip, Jemmy makes his attempt to break the speckles monopoly. All along the Road, he distributes gumdrop candy covered with dyed speckle seeds to children. Because the speckle seeds are no longer irradiated, they will grow after having passed through people's bodies, in manure piles and graveyards. The next time the merchants try to withhold speckles, they will be in for a surprise.

Park et al., Contemporary Engineering Economics (Second Canadian Edition), Addison Wesley Longman, 2001. Overview \\"Disposal tax effect\\" is a finance term originating from Engineering Economics. In the case of SV > UCC, then there has been a relative gain in the sale of the item, which gets taxed. These gains are known as \\"recaptured depreciation\\" or \\"recaptured CCA\\". When SV < UCC, then there has been a loss, which results in tax savings. The Central collection agency (CCA) which uses a method of depreciation and the undepreciated value which is the undepreciated capital cost. As CCA uses a declining balance it makes the disposal of assets complicated. The disposal tax effect (DTE) takes into account that the salvage value can cause a gain or a loss. The disposal tax effect formula: DTE = (BookValue – SalvageValue) x TR. The relevant book value in this case is determining the tax gain or loss of the asset. The tax basis then is the difference between the original cost and any accumulated depreciation. The disposal tax effect (DTE) is also calculated by getting the difference between the UCC cost and the salvage value then multiplying the it by the tax rate (TR).[1] For businesses the capital gain is from the appreciation value of the asset depending at which tax rate (TR) or tax law that will be applied at the time of the sale. The recapture of depreciation is calculated by how much the company has over- depreciated the asset in its life. The recapture allocation is taxed at ordinary rates as excess depreciation over the years essentially reduced taxable income. The basis value is the price of the fixed asset. Tax on recapture is calculated by = (BookValue – BasisValue) x TR Capital gains tax = (BasisValue – Salvage Value) x TR/2 Disposal tax effect (DTE) = (tax on recapture + Capital gains tax) If a company sells an asset for less than the tax basis this causes a loss in capital. This means that the assets value has decreased more than its depreciation value for tax. When capital loss occurs then a special tax rate is given. The benefit of this is that the sale of an asset is the amount by which the taxes are reduced (tax shield). When there are capital gains and losses in the same year, the two values are then combined so that capital loss reduces and the taxes are paid on the capital gains. In the case of an excess in capital losses the remaining capital loss is used to reduce the ordinary capital income. The disposal tax effect (DTE) can be negative (when our salvage value is greater than our book value) which means that the tax effect increases taxes. Disposal tax effect (DTE) can also be negative if our asset is sold for a price greater than its purchase price but it is also equal to sum of the two tax effects. If an asset has been fully depreciated (when the aggregate tax deductions are equal to the original cost of the asset) there are no additional tax implications placed on the asset. Advantages An advantage of having a loss from sale on an asset is the amount of the reduction on taxes after. The reduction in taxable income is known as a tax shield. [2] In Ireland at least 50% of the revenue which disposal tax brings in to the government it is poured back into biological treatment of bio-waste and mechanical-biological treatment of waste. This reduces organic content of waste which goes into landfills or for incineration. This is highly beneficial for the environment. While in Catalan it discourages landfills and incineration in accordance and reinforcement of the European waste management it penalizes them economically. Essentially the making of disposal can be more expensive but on the other hand it creates revenue for local authorities by diversified refunds for separate collection. Disposal of new asset If a company sells an asset for more than what it is worth then the gain is broken into two parts. Capital gain (sales price – original price) and recapture depreciation which is (original cost – tax basis). the benefit is the increased capital from appreciation of the asset and will be taxed at a new special rate depending on the tax law at the time of sale.

During the spectacle, Julian reveals the kind of work he truly does, and when Danny is skeptical, takes Danny through the steps of murdering a portly spectator in the arena bathroom. Danny is shocked at how easily Julian can get within inches of the man, even though Julian ends the \\"tutorial\\" without going through with the murder. Later, while at an outdoor cafe, Julian asks Danny to assist him in \\"facilitating a fatality\\"; Danny flatly refuses and Julian leaves. On leaving the idea seems to be that Julian has had enough of Danny and their friendship has just ended. That evening Julian appears at Danny's hotel room, knocking on the door, pleading to be let in; Julian wants to apologize for attempting to involve Danny in his work. Danny sits within looking undecided, and the scene fades to black without revealing what happened next. There is the sound of glass breaking once the screen goes dark. The film picks up again six months later, during the Christmas season. Danny and his wife, Bean (Hope Davis) are relaxing at their home when Julian arrives, looking for a place to stay. Danny and Bean have reservations about the situation, but decide to let him in. The grateful Julian notices that Danny has framed the ticket from the bullfight, an act that affects Julian profoundly. That night, he shares the real reason for his visit: he needs help with one last job. Julian convinces Danny to go along with the plan because, he tells Danny, \\"you owe me.\\" After much internal struggle and with Danny talking him through it, Julian completes the task at a Tucson horse race track. On the plane back from Tucson, Julian reveals that the man he just killed was his boss. Killing the boss means now Julian can retire and spend the rest of his life in Greece. Danny is surprised, then amused at Julian's craftiness, but is reminded of Julian's lethal personality when he lightly punches Julian in the shoulder and is sternly warned by Julian, \\"Don't ever hit me again.\\" Danny remembers his friend is still a killer and immediately apologizes. A split flashback sequence during the flight home (memories triggered by a statement Danny makes), shows what took place a year prior when Danny let Julian into his hotel room: Julian talked Danny out of commissioning a hit on a rival to win the Mexico City business deal. Later, Danny and Bean are shown visiting the grave of their son, something they do together every year. Julian watches respectfully from a distance, places plane tickets for Greece (his intended place of retirement) on their car windshield, then slips away.

According to the credits following the film, all bullfights were created using computer generated bulls. Actress Hope Davis was pregnant during the filming of the movie. During the commentary for the first deleted scene on the DVD, director Richard Shephard states that the first cut of the film was 2 hours and 10 minutes and was cut down to its current length of 1 hour and 37 minutes. Pierce Brosnan's screen worn Sombrero featured in the film was sold at auction for $22,000.  Critical reaction  Having been screened at the Sundance, Toronto International, and Chicago International film festivals prior to its release, the film was generally well received by critics. Early professional reviews praised Pierce Brosnan's performance, as well as the film's unique and provocative premise and themes.Honeycutt, Kirk. \\"The Matador.\\" Hollywood Reporter. Jan. 22, 2005 Roger Ebert and Richard Roeper, on their television show At the Movies with Ebert & Roeper, gave it an enthusiastic \\"two thumbs up,\\" with Ebert praising the movie as \\"an overlooked gem\\" and \\"Pierce Brosnan's best work to date.\\" , the film holds a 75% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 156 reviews, with an average rating of 6.68/10. The critical consensus states that \\"This humorously amoral, oddball comic thriller features strong performances by Pierce Brosnan and Greg Kinnear as a flamboyant, aging hit-man and an out of work suburban businessman, respectively.\\" Pierce Brosnan was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy at the 63rd Golden Globe Awards, although Joaquin Phoenix ultimately won for Walk the Line (2005).

Like its two predecessors, it follows the adventures of the Terran scout ship, Streaker. This novel, though, features more alternate storylines than its predecessors, tracking not only the humans, but the Jijoan exiles as they re-enter mainstream Galactic society, the chimpanzee hyperspace scout Harry Harms, the Jophur as they chase the humans, and the humans hiding on the Jophur ship Polkjhy.  Synopsis  The book takes the Streakers off the planet Jijo and back in space. The ship attempts to escape capture by one of the ships still chasing after it, confiding in the protection of hydrogen life to do so. After returning to the Fractal World, where the Retired reside, a galaxy-shattering event occurs which shatters the hyperspace tunnels that connect the Five Galaxies as one of the Galaxies breaks free. After they are chosen as candidates for transcendence, they meet the Transcendents around a white dwarf and learn of the history and motivations of their actions; their (and others) apprehension on the 'Embrace of Tides'; and a master plan executed at the moments of fracture, one which may just happen to fling a bottle into the expanses between galaxies for ancient friends to find. Flung out just before destruction, the Streaker returns to Earth with one trick left to play and end both Earth's siege and their journey in the void.

The riots were triggered by an event the previous Sunday, when an altercation turned physical between a group of youths of Middle-Eastern appearance (referred to as \\"Lebanese\\" or \\"Lebos\\" by their opponents) and Anglo-Australian lifeguards on the beach. Following the reporting of this event by the tabloid media and \\"shock jocks\\" on local radio, a racially motivated gathering was organised for the following weekend. A crowd gathered at Cronulla on the morning of Sunday, 11 December, and, by midday, approximately 5,000 people had gathered near the beach. The police eventually intervened. Violence spread to other southern suburbs of Sydney, where assaults occurred, including two stabbings and attacks on ambulances and police officers. Travel warnings for Australia were issued by some countries but were later removed. The riots were widely condemned by local, state and federal members of parliament, police, local community leaders, and residents of Cronulla and adjacent areas. A large number of arrests were made over the subsequent months, from both the initial riot on 11 December and the retaliations over the subsequent nights. Some media were criticised and well- known radio personality Alan Jones was formally censured and fined for his broadcasts during that week. Chronology =Background= New South Wales Police had been recording racial and ethnic tensions and incidents in and around Cronulla since October 2005. There is also a history of conflict between Cronulla locals and those visiting from the western suburbs (\\"Westies\\") with \\"bashings\\" common since the 1960s as part of a turf war between Westies and local surfies.Collins, Jock. 2009. \\"Sydney's Cronulla riots: the Context and Implications\\". In Lines in the Sand: the Cronulla Riots, Multiculturalism and National Belonging, edited by G. Noble. Sydney: Institute of Criminology PressShaw, Wendy. 2009. \\"Riotous Sydney Take Three (Cronulla): Confessions of a Beach Survivor\\". In Lines in the Sand : the Cronulla Riots, Multiculturalism and National Belonging, edited by G. Noble. Sydney: Institute of Criminology Press The previous summer, on Australia Day 26 January 2005 a non-racial riot occurred with around two to three thousand young people in the Cronulla area engaged in \\"civil disobedience\\", at one stage hurling missiles at police attempting to control the crowd. =4 December 2005= Just after 3 pm on Sunday, 4 December 2005, police were called to North Cronulla Beach following a report of an assault on two off- duty surf lifesavers by four members of a group of eight Middle Eastern men. A verbal exchange had taken place after three lifesavers approached a group of four young Lebanese men on Cronulla Beach with both groups accusing the other of staring at them. One of the Lebanese men reportedly responded to the accusations, \\"I'm allowed to; now fuck off and leave our beach\\", to which a lifesaver responded, \\"I come down here out of my own spare time to save you cunts from drowning\\". The verbal exchange escalated with one Lebanese youth attempting to defuse the situation. Another then threw a punch, missing, prompting a pushing match that escalated into a fight. One of the lifesavers was badly hurt after falling and striking his head. One of the lifesavers later informed police that the four were part of a group of eight Lebanese that had been on the beach most of the day and that there had been no problems with their prior behaviour. Despite media reports to the contrary, no Middle Eastern men converged on the area and there were no more than the original eight present. =Media reporting= One media report stated that there was already tension between the community and Lebanese youths before this event and people, particularly women, claimed to have been harassed, almost daily, by \\"groups of young Lebanese men\\" attempting to \\"pick them up\\" and describing the women as being \\"Aussie sluts\\". The events were reported widely across the Sydney media, particularly tabloid; also generating discussions on talkback radio. When a listener identified as Berta commented to shock jock Alan Jones of Sydney's 2GB Radio that she had heard \\"really derogatory remarks\\" aimed at Middle Eastern people, Jones interrupted stating \\"We don't have Anglo-Saxon kids out there raping women in Western Sydney\\". Jones also broadcast and endorsed one listener's suggestion that bikie gangs be brought down to Cronulla railway station to deal with \\"Lebanese thugs\\" and that the event be televised, arguing that despite their reputation bikie gangs do \\"a lot of good things\\". By Thursday, Jones had stirred significant discussion, and stated \\"I'm the person that's led this charge here. Nobody wanted to know about North Cronulla, now it's gathered to this.\\" After the riots Jones was found to have breached the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) Code of Conduct section 1.3(a), as his comments were \\"likely to encourage violence or brutality and to vilify people of Lebanese and Middle-Eastern backgrounds on the basis of ethnicity\\". In December 2009 the NSW Administrative Decisions Tribunal found Jones and radio station 2GB guilty of vilifying Lebanese Muslims in earlier 'Cronulla Riot' broadcasts. A fine of $10,000 was imposed. Police were concerned about the repercussions of these events. Later investigations revealed that over 270,000 individual text messages were transmitted inciting a racially motivated confrontation at North Cronulla Beach the following Saturday. =11 December 2005= Over the course of Sunday, 11 December 2005, approximately 5,000 people gathered in and around North Cronulla Beach. Early in the morning, people began to gather and impromptu barbecues and \\"partying\\" took place. However, at 12:59, a young man of \\"Middle Eastern appearance\\" was spotted on the beach and the crowds began \\"chanting stuff [and] yelling out things\\" before rushing him. The man attempted to avoid the crowd by quickly entering \\"Northies\\", a local pub, but the crowd forcibly dragged him out and attacked him. The police, having been in Cronulla since the early morning (including police helicopters and patrol boats), quickly intervened and resolved the situation. A Cronulla High School teacher later claimed that the crowd had attacked the man after he had shouted \\"I'm going to blow youse all up\\". At 13:30 two women verbally argued with a small group; the police arrived and both parties left. However, an hour later, they again met and a scuffle ensued. At 13:45, another two boys from Bangladesh were surrounded by the crowd, and had bottles thrown at them, with the crowd repeatedly chanting \\"Fuck off Lebs!\\" The boys escaped by car. Chants and slogans such as \\"Fuck off Lebs!\\", \\"We grew here, you flew here\\", \\"Aussie Pride\\", \\"Fuck off wogs!\\", were repeated and displayed throughout the day by the crowd. The crowd also attacked the police by throwing beer bottles. Police vehicles were also prevented from entering the area. Around 14:00 another three males were assaulted on the beach with the crowd throwing sausages and beer bottles at them. Rumours had persisted throughout the day that an additional 600 people would arrive by train, mostly from the west of Cronulla, to join the crowds. At approximately 15:00 \\"two young men of Middle Eastern appearance\\" arrived at Cronulla train station with the crowd outside chanting \\"Fuck off wogs!\\". The two men took refuge in the train. However, the crowd entered and began assaulting them; a police officer entered the train and violently cleared the crowd, later being found to have used excessive force.https://mobile.abc.net.au/news/2018-12-11/cronulla-riots-craig-campbell- still-paying-the-price/10605460 At 15:20 two separate assaults took place; one involved a crowd attacking a man of \\"Middle Eastern appearance\\" and throwing beer bottles. In this case an officer intervened and removed the victim as they were both struck by the bottle. A second assault took place outside a take away restaurant; three men were taken inside the restaurant as refuge and the diners already inside were moved towards the back. The glass doors and windows were broken and those inside were moved outside without incident. =Injuries and arrests= By the end of the day 26 people had been treated for injuries. The 15:20 assault required the victim and the police officer to receive hospital treatment. A total of 16 were arrested and charged with 42 offences including: malicious damage, assaulting a police officer, affray, offensive conduct, resisting arrest and numerous driving offences. One police officer was hit by a car and two ambulance officers were also amongst the injured as their ambulance, under mounted police escort, was surrounded and beer bottles were thrown, with one of the ambulance officers being hit on the head by a bottle and the other receiving lacerations on the arm. Crowd with mounted police and ambulance in background. Near North Cronulla Beach First Aid room =Evening retaliation= At 19:45 around 100 locals of Punchbowl (a suburb to Cronulla's northwest) gathered together at the local Punchbowl Park. Additional groups, armed with baseball bats, also gathered at The Promenade and Arncliffe Park. Between 20:30 and 21:00 the groups formed a convoy of \\"more than 40 cars\\" and drove down to the beaches \\"to get revenge\\" with many of the cars ending up in Maroubra. At 22:45 police were ordered \\"not to approach convoys of men of Middle Eastern appearance\\"; however car details and registration details were to be recorded. A local of Maroubra reported that each of the cars that arrived was \\"full, you know, had four passengers\\". The convoy was reportedly armed with bars and bats, knives, machetes and guns. The group assaulted several people, knocking one unconscious and threatening another with rape, and damaged between 60 and 100 cars, setting at least one on fire. Police in riot gear moved to contain the violence and the crowds responded by throwing bricks and glass. Residents reported that in some streets \\"every car\\" had had their windows smashed, with glass covering the streets. Police also confiscated 40 iron bars and arrested 14 people. A 26-year-old mechanic referred to as \\"Dan\\" was stabbed in the back three times and twice in the thigh with a blade at approximately 22:25. The incident occurred outside Woolooware golf club when two cars carrying a group of males \\"described as being of Mediterranean or Middle Eastern appearance\\" approached the man and his friends. Dan and his friends attempted to flee from the group, who were shouting \\"Get the Aussie dogs... get the Aussie sluts\\", Dan was knocked to the ground and was repeatedly kicked in the head. The attack ended when the knife snapped off in the victim's back. He was taken to hospital in a serious condition as the blade had narrowly missed his spine and lungs. The get away driver for the attack was arrested and held in jail for 9 months, after which he was paroled for 5 months of good behaviour. Jake Schofield was attacked by a group of four men of \\"Middle Eastern appearance\\", who beat him repeatedly, stabbing him twice and hitting him with a piece of concrete before stealing his wallet and keys. The attack left him with a fractured eye socket and nose. All four assailants were arrested and charged. A woman wearing a headscarf had her car stopped by a group of white males and was then abused and threatened by this group. Aftermath Additional smaller riots occurred on the following nights in the suburbs of Maroubra and Brighton-le-Sands and in Cronulla. Text messages similar to the earlier 270,000 inciting racial violence had also turned up in other states including Queensland, Victoria and Western Australia. On 12 December, rioters had written various messages including; \\"Aussi to Die\\", \\"Intifada\\", \\"It's war\\", \\"Sunday cowards die, Soldiers rize\\", \\"Never rest assie dog\\", \\"We came in planes yous came by chains u convict dogs\\", and \\"We fear no ozy pigs\\" before continuing to destroy cars and local shops. Approximately 2000 people gathered inside Lakemba Mosque with another 800 gathered outside the evening after the riot. Sheikh Shady Suleiman spoke to the crowd and called for calm. However some were armed with Glock pistols which they displayed to the media. At least some of the people gathered were reported to have planned to go on to Maroubra; however the police blocked roads leading into Maroubra and 20 police cars surrounded the mosque. The Uniting Church in Auburn, a predominantly Tongan congregation, was burned and those attending Christmas carols were abused and threatened. More than 30 Molotov cocktails were also confiscated by police. Eight hundred police officers formed Operation Seta and were on patrol on the following nights, with up to 450 police officers blockading Cronulla on the night of 13 December and an additional 11 people were arrested; five were arrested in relation to a replica pistol and six were arrested for property damage. An additional seven people were injured including another police officer. A husband and wife were taken to hospital after the wife was struck in the head and the husband tried to defend her, and another man was struck by a baseball bat and suffered a fractured forearm. Criminal prosecutions By 19 July 2006, police had laid 285 charges against 104 people, 51 having been arrested as a result of the original Cronulla riot and 53 arrested from the retaliation riots. These persons were charged with, amongst other things: malicious damage, possession or use of a prohibited weapon, assaulting police, rioting, resisting arrest, threatening violence and affray. Ali Osman, 18, was charged with affray and assault occasioning actual bodily harm for the original attacks he committed on 4 December 2005 against the volunteer lifesavers and was given 300 hours of community service for the assault and 200 hours for affray though they would be served concurrently. Osman was the only person charged over the initial confrontation. The Magistrate, Jacqueline Trad (herself of Lebanese descent) told Sutherland Local Court that Osman had turned his back on his real country: \\"By this sort of conduct you turned your back on your family, your culture and your real country, all for the sake of some juvenile, impulsive and misplaced allegiance.... Over the last 100 years or so, the ancestors of many citizens – mine included – came to this country seeking refuge from hatred, intolerance, violence or just simply the opportunity to improve their families' prospects.\\" Yahya Jamal Serhan was arrested over the stabbing of \\"Dan\\" on 12 December and charged with affray and maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm and was sentenced to 13 months jail but was immediately released after having already spent nine months in custody awaiting trial. Dan was angered and disappointed by the sentence, saying \\"I've got no feeling on the left hand side of my back where the knife broke off.\\" A second person, a 17-year–old, was also questioned by police. Marcus Kapitza, 28, was jailed for 12 months after pleading guilty to one charge of riot. On the day of the riot Kapitza wore a singlet with the words \\"Mohammed was a camel-raping faggot.\\" He was also involved in the attack at the train station shouting \\"Fuck off! Fuck off the Lebs.\\" Brent Lohman, 19, was also charged over the train station assault, and was sentenced to 11 months in jail. Two of the youths who attacked Jake Schofield turned themselves in to police and were charged with armed robbery, wounding, malicious wounding with intent, affray and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Two others, Wael Tahan and Mahmoud Eid, had been arrested on the night of the attack but were released without charge before being rearrested and charged with robbery in company, malicious wounding causing grievous bodily harm and affray. Brett Andrew King appeared in court in January 2006 charged with sending two text messages 42 times for a retaliatory riot on 18 December 2005. Jeffrey Ismail was also charged with sending two text messages under the pseudonym of John Gotti. A 16-year-old Lebanese immigrant, Ali Ammar, was arrested and jailed for seven months for stealing an Australian flag from the Brighton-le-Sands Returned and Services League of Australia (RSL) club and burning it. Following his release, Ammar appeared on television to present an official apology and in 2007 he was sponsored by the RSL to walk the Kokoda track after the State President of the New South Wales RSL met him at a Reconciliation Conference.Cronulla To Kokoda Compass 8 July 2007 =Strike Force Enoggera= Strike Force Enoggera was established on 13 December 2005, tasked with investigating the riots. The strike force initially consisted of 28 members under the command of Superintendent Dennis Bray, but was increased to 100 officers on 20 January 2006. During a radio interview New South Wales Police Commissioner Moroney claimed to have no video footage of the retaliatory attacks on 11 December; however it was later revealed that the police had had a video for five weeks, leading Moroney to sack Bray, who was later reinstated to a lesser role, having been replaced by Detective Superintendent Ken Mckay. Responses =Media and community responses= Brian Wilshire, a 2GB radio host, stated the following weekend on air: \\"Many of them have parents who are first cousins whose parents are first cousins, the result of this inbreeding—the result of which is uneducationable people... and very low IQ\\", comments for which he later apologised. An anti-racism rally, attended by 2000 people, was held in Bourke Street, Melbourne. Apologies for the riots at Cronulla were later issued on behalf of some local surf clubs, arguing their members rejected racism and violence. The gathering was justified as a protest against \\"ethnic gangs\\" with blame for the rioting and violence largely placed on alcohol and the agitation of far-right groups.Silkstone, Dan. 2005. \\"Opposing Sides Come Together to Apologise and Shake on it\\". The Age 15 December 2011 accessed: 10 May 2011 During a press conference along with the Comancheros MC (which has a large amount of middle eastern members), An apology from the Maroubra \\"Bra Boys\\" was also issued to leaders of the Islamic community. Apologies from several others involved were also issued to Sydney's Lebanese community, though the earlier \\"protest\\" part of the day was still defended.Ong, Tracy. 2005. \\"'Ashamed' Protest Leaders Sorry for Riot\\". The Australian 15 December 2005 Newsbank. Retrieved 10 May 2011 Writing a year after the riots, novelist Hsu-Ming Teo was worried that Australian multiculturalism was being eroded. Stating that multiculturalism was one of Australia's defining features that allowed it to broker differences with its geographical neighbours, and that it was almost unique in its ethnic and cultural origins: she suggested that in recent years multiculturalism had begun to be derided with politicians calling for one homogeneous non-divisible Australian culture citing, amongst others, the \\"popularity and success\\" of Pauline Hanson. In 2008 Australian portrait photographer Michel Lawrence published All of Us, a book containing photographs of people born in 200 other countries, but who were now living in Australia. Lawrence said the All of Us project was wholly inspired by the Cronulla riots. “You watch this stuff on TV and you wonder why people are doing this - this is no way for a multicultural society to behave,” said Lawrence. =Government responses= The New South Wales parliament convened on 15 December to pass laws giving police new powers including: the ability to seize cars and mobile phones for up to seven days, close licensed premises and prohibit bringing alcohol into lock–down zones. A new offence of \\"assault during a public disorder\\" was also introduced and both rioting and affray had their minimum sentences increased. New South Wales Premier Morris Iemma called the attacks \\"disgusting, cowardly behaviour\\" and condemned the rioters. He also called on the community leaders to use \\"their influence to get the hot heads to cool it\\". New South Wales Police Commissioner Ken Moroney called the riots \\"absolutely totally un-Australian\\", saying that \\"I saw, in my 40 years of police service, some of the most disgraceful behaviour and conduct by adults that I'd ever seen.\\" New South Wales Opposition leader Peter Debnam called it \\"a real disgrace\\" and called for a tougher police response. Australian Prime Minister John Howard condemned the violence describing it as \\"sickening and deplorable\\" but denied any racial undertones, saying the events were primarily an issue of law and order — a view echoed by the Treasurer Peter Costello, who described the Sydney riots as \\"an example of hoodlums who got out of control\\". However this was viewed by many people who live in Sydney as the government burying its head in the sand over racial tension so foreign ownership in Australia would not be affected. Federal opposition leader Kim Beazley described the attacks as \\"simply criminal behaviour, that's all there is to it\\". =Economic impacts= Many of the small businesses in and around Terrigal on the New South Wales Central Coast (two hours north of Cronulla) reported that a police lockdown of the beach caused business to drop to 10% of normal levels on a Saturday, with only 25% of Christmas shopping crowds turning up on the Sunday. Tourism and hospitality workers in the area were laid off or had their hours cut. The New South Wales state government announced a A$250,000 tourism campaign after authorities in Great Britain, Canada, and Indonesia issued travel warnings to their citizens.  Tenth anniversary  Police presence at Peryman Square, Cronulla. 12 December 2015 The Party for Freedom (PFF) planned to mark the tenth anniversary of the events with a rally on Saturday, 12 December 2015. PFF chairman Nicholas Folkes was refused permission in the Supreme Court of New South Wales \\"on the grounds it would stir up racial hatred\\". In a separate case the Federal Court of Australia ruled that no other person or groups could commemorate the anniversary. The Federal ruling was in response to a joint application by Jamal Rifi, a prominent member of the Lebanese Muslim community in Australia, and the Sutherland Shire Council who applied for the Federal Court ruling. In place of the rally a \\"halal-free\\" barbecue, attended by about 50, was held on Don Lucas Reserve near Wanda Beach. A larger number of counter protesters in \\"the hundreds\\", including Antifa members, were also present. A heavy police presence included the riot squad, mounted police and helicopter, and the two groups were mostly kept apart. Two anti-racism protesters were arrested. The majority of the anti-racism protesters were escorted by police to Cronulla Railway station and onto trains headed towards Sydney city. They were accompanied by riot police.

Insects are the only group of invertebrates that have evolved wings and flight. Insects first flew in the Carboniferous, some 350 million years ago. Wings may have evolved from appendages on the sides of existing limbs, which already had nerves, joints, and muscles used for other purposes. These may initially have been used for sailing on water, or to slow the rate of descent when gliding. Two insect groups, the dragonflies and the mayflies, have flight muscles attached directly to the wings. In other winged insects, flight muscles attach to the thorax, which make it oscillate in order to induce the wings to beat. Of these insects, some (dipterans and some beetles) achieve very high wingbeat frequencies through the evolution of an \\"asynchronous\\" nervous system, in which the thorax oscillates faster than the rate of nerve impulses. Some very small insects make use not of steady-state aerodynamics but of the Weis-Fogh clap and fling mechanism, generating large lift forces at the expense of wear and tear on the wings. Many insects can hover, maintaining height and controlling their position. Some insects such as moths have the forewings coupled to the hindwings so these can work in unison. Mechanisms Direct flight: muscles attached to wings. Large insects only The Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) have direct flight musculature, as do mayflies. =Direct flight= Unlike other insects, the wing muscles of the Ephemeroptera (mayflies) and Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) insert directly at the wing bases, which are hinged so that a small movement of the wing base downward, lifts the wing itself upward, very much like rowing through the air. Dragonflies and damselflies have fore and hind wings similar in shape and size. Each operates independently, which gives a degree of fine control and mobility in terms of the abruptness with which they can change direction and speed, not seen in other flying insects. This is not surprising, given that odonates are all aerial predators, and they have always hunted other airborne insects. =Indirect flight= Indirect flight: muscles make thorax oscillate in most insects. The Neoptera, including butterflies and most other insects, have indirect flight musculature. Other than the two orders with direct flight muscles, all other living winged insects fly using a different mechanism, involving indirect flight muscles. This mechanism evolved once and is the defining feature (synapomorphy) for the infraclass Neoptera; it corresponds, probably not coincidentally, with the appearance of a wing- folding mechanism, which allows Neopteran insects to fold the wings back over the abdomen when at rest (though this ability has been lost secondarily in some groups, such as in the butterflies). In the higher groups with two functional pairs of wings, both pairs are linked together mechanically in various ways and function as a single wing, although this is not true in the more primitive groups. There are also exceptions to be found among the more advanced Neoptera; the ghost moth is able to unlock its pair of wings and move them independently, allowing them to hover like dragonflies.March 2013 - Bristol Naturalists' Society Photography has revealed that both sexes unlock the pair of wings on each side and move them independently enabling hovering flight, reminiscent of the way dragonflies fly. What all Neoptera share, however, is the way the muscles in the thorax work: these muscles, rather than attaching to the wings, attach to the thorax and deform it; since the wings are extensions of the thoracic exoskeleton, the deformations of the thorax cause the wings to move as well. A set of dorsal longitudinal muscles compresses the thorax from front to back, causing the dorsal surface of the thorax (notum) to bow upward, making the wings flip down. A set of tergosternal muscles pulls the notum downward again, causing the wings to flip upward. In a few groups, the downstroke is accomplished solely through the elastic recoil of the thorax when the tergosternal muscles are relaxed. Several small sclerites at the wing base have other, separate, muscles attached and these are used for fine control of the wing base in such a way as to allow various adjustments in the tilt and amplitude of the wing beats. Insects that beat their wings fewer than one hundred times a second use synchronous muscle. A synchronous muscle is a type of muscle that contracts once for every nerve impulse, which is more efficient for fast flight. Insects that beat their wings more rapidly, such as the bumblebee, use asynchronous muscle; this is a type of muscle that contracts more than once per nerve impulse. This is achieved by the muscle being stimulated to contract again by a release in tension in the muscle, which can happen more rapidly than through simple nerve stimulation alone. This allows the frequency of wing beats to exceed the rate at which the nervous system can send impulses. The asynchronous muscle is one of the final refinements that has appeared in some of the higher Neoptera (Coleoptera, Diptera, and Hymenoptera). The overall effect is that many higher Neoptera can beat their wings much faster than insects with direct flight muscles. =Aerodynamics= There are two basic aerodynamic models of insect flight: creating a leading edge vortex, and using clap and fling. Leading edge vortex Most insects use a method that creates a spiralling leading edge vortex. These flapping wings move through two basic half-strokes. The downstroke starts up and back and is plunged downward and forward. Then the wing is quickly flipped over (supination) so that the leading edge is pointed backward. The upstroke then pushes the wing upward and backward. Then the wing is flipped again (pronation) and another downstroke can occur. The frequency range in insects with synchronous flight muscles typically is 5 to 200 hertz (Hz). In those with asynchronous flight muscles, wing beat frequency may exceed 1000 Hz. When the insect is hovering, the two strokes take the same amount of time. A slower downstroke, however, provides thrust. Identification of major forces is critical to understanding insect flight. The first attempts to understand flapping wings assumed a quasi-steady state. This means that the air flow over the wing at any given time was assumed to be the same as how the flow would be over a non-flapping, steady-state wing at the same angle of attack. By dividing the flapping wing into a large number of motionless positions and then analyzing each position, it would be possible to create a timeline of the instantaneous forces on the wing at every moment. The calculated lift was found to be too small by a factor of three, so researchers realized that there must be unsteady phenomena providing aerodynamic forces. There were several developing analytical models attempting to approximate flow close to a flapping wing. Some researchers predicted force peaks at supination. With a dynamically scaled model of a fruit fly, these predicted forces later were confirmed. Others argued that the force peaks during supination and pronation are caused by an unknown rotational effect that fundamentally is different from the translational phenomena. There is some disagreement with this argument. Through computational fluid dynamics, some researchers argue that there is no rotational effect. They claim that the high forces are caused by an interaction with the wake shed by the previous stroke. Similar to the rotational effect mentioned above, the phenomena associated with flapping wings are not completely understood or agreed upon. Because every model is an approximation, different models leave out effects that are presumed to be negligible. For example, the Wagner effect says that circulation rises slowly to its steady-state due to viscosity when an inclined wing is accelerated from rest. This phenomenon would explain a lift value that is less than what is predicted. Typically, the case has been to find sources for the added lift. It has been argued that this effect is negligible for flow with a Reynolds number that is typical of insect flight. The Wagner effect was ignored, consciously, in at least one recent model. One of the most important phenomena that occurs during insect flight is leading edge suction. This force is significant to the calculation of efficiency. The concept of leading edge suction first was put forth to describe vortex lift on sharp-edged delta wings. At high angles of attack, the flow separates over the leading edge, but reattaches before reaching the trailing edge. Within this bubble of separated flow is a vortex. Because the angle of attack is so high, a lot of momentum is transferred downward into the flow. These two features create a large amount of lift force as well as some additional drag. The important feature, however, is the lift. Because the flow has separated, yet it still provides large amounts of lift, this phenomenon is called stall delay. This effect was observed in flapping insect flight and it was proven to be capable of providing enough lift to account for the deficiency in the quasi-steady-state models. This effect is used by canoeists in a sculling draw stroke. All of the effects on a flapping wing may be reduced to three major sources of aerodynamic phenomena: the leading edge vortex, the steady-state aerodynamic forces on the wing, and the wing’s contact with its wake from previous strokes. The size of flying insects ranges from about 20 micrograms to about 3 grams. As insect body mass increases, wing area increases and wing beat frequency decreases. For larger insects, the Reynolds number (Re) may be as high as 10000. For smaller insects, it may be as low as 10. This means that viscous effects are much more important to the smaller insects, although the flow is still laminar, even in the largest fliers. Another interesting feature of insect flight is the body tilt. As flight speed increases, the insect body tends to tilt nose-down and become more horizontal. This reduces the frontal area and therefore, the body drag. Since drag also increases as forward velocity increases, the insect is making its flight more efficient as this efficiency becomes more necessary. Additionally, by changing the geometric angle of attack on the downstroke, the insect is able to keep its flight at an optimal efficiency through as many manoeuvres as possible. The development of general thrust is relatively small compared with lift forces. Lift forces may be more than three times the insect's weight, while thrust at even the highest speeds may be as low as 20% of the weight. This force is developed primarily through the less powerful upstroke of the flapping motion. The feathery wings of a thrips are unsuitable for the leading edge vortex flight of most other insects, but support clap and fling flight. Clap and fling Clap and fling is used in sea butterflies such as Limacina helicina to \\"fly\\" through the water. The second method of flight, clap and fling, or the Weis-Fogh mechanism, functions differently. In this process, found in very small insects such as thrips and chalcid wasps, the wings clap together above the insect's body and then fling apart. As they fling open, the air gets sucked in and creates a vortex over each wing. This bound vortex then moves across the wing and, in the clap, acts as the starting vortex for the other wing. By this effect, circulation and thus lift are increased to the extent of being higher, in most cases, than the typical leading edge vortex effect. One of the reasons this method is not employed by more insects is the inevitable damage and wear to the wings caused by repeated clapping. It is prevalent, however, among insects that are very small and experience low Reynolds numbers. The mechanism is also employed by the marine mollusc Limacina helicina, a sea butterfly. Some insects, such as the vegetable leaf miner Liriomyza sativae (a dipteran fly), exploit a partial clap and fling, using the mechanism only on the outer part of the wing to increase lift by some 7% when hovering. File:Clap and Fling 1- clap 1.svgClap 1: wings close over back File:Clap and Fling 2- clap 2.svgClap 2: leading edges touch, wing rotates around leading edge, vortices form File:Clap and Fling 3 - clap 3.svgClap 3: trailing edges close, vortices shed, wings close giving thrust File:Clap and Fling 4- fling 1.svgFling 1: wings rotate around trailing edge to fling apart File:Clap and Fling 5- fling 2.svgFling 2: leading edge moves away, air rushes in, increasing lift File:Clap and Fling 6- fling 3.svgFling 3: new vortex forms at leading edge, trailing edge vortices cancel each other, perhaps helping flow to grow faster (Weis-Fogh 1973) Governing equations A wing moving in fluids experiences a fluid force, which follows the conventions found in aerodynamics. The force component normal to the direction of the far field flow relative to the wing is referred to as lift (L), and the force component in the opposite direction of the flow is drag (D). At the Reynolds numbers considered here, an appropriate force unit is 1/2(ρU2S), where ρ is the density of the fluid, S the wing area, and U the wing speed. The dimensionless forces are called lift (CL) and drag (CD) coefficients, that is: :C_\\\\text{L} (\\\\alpha)=\\\\frac{2 L}{ \\\\rho U^2S} \\\\quad \\\\text{and} \\\\quad C_\\\\text{D} (\\\\alpha)=\\\\frac{2 D}{\\\\rho U^2S}. CL and CD are constants only if the flow is steady. A special class of objects such as airfoils may reach a steady state when it slices through the fluid at a small angle of attack. In this case, the inviscid flow around an airfoil can be approximated by a potential flow satisfying the no-penetration boundary condition. The Kutta-Joukowski theorem of a 2D airfoil further assumes that the flow leaves the sharp trailing edge smoothly, and this determines the total circulation around an airfoil. The corresponding lift is given by Bernoulli's principle (Blasius theorem): :C_\\\\text{L}=2\\\\pi \\\\sin\\\\alpha \\\\quad \\\\text{and} \\\\quad C_\\\\text{D}=0. The flows around birds and insects can be considered incompressible: The Mach number, or speed while moving through air, is typically 1/300 and the wing frequency is about 10–103 Hz. Using the governing equation as the Navier-Stokes equation being subject to the no-slip boundary condition, the equation is: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{u}}{\\\\partial t}+\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{u}\\\\cdot abla \\\\right)\\\\mathbf{u} &= -\\\\frac{ abla p}{\\\\rho} + v abla^2 \\\\mathbf{u} abla\\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{u} &= 0 \\\\mathbf{u}_\\\\text{bd} &=\\\\mathbf{u}_\\\\text{s}. \\\\end{align} Where u(x, t) is the flow field, p the pressure, ρ the density of the fluid, ν the kinematic viscosity, ubd the velocity at the boundary, and us the velocity of the solid. By choosing a length scale, L, and velocity scale, U, the equation can be expressed in nondimensional form containing the Reynolds number, Re=UL/ν . There are two obvious differences between an insect wing and an airfoil: An insect wing is much smaller and it flaps. Using a dragonfly as an example, Its chord (c) is about 1 cm, its wing length (l) about 4 cm, and its wing frequency (f) about 40 Hz. The tip speed (u) is about 1 m/s, and the corresponding Reynolds number, Re=uc/ν about 103. At the smaller end, a Chalcid wasp has a wing length of about 0.5–0.7 mm and beats its wing at about 400 Hz. Its Reynolds number is about 25. The range of Reynolds number in insect flight is about 10 to 104, which lies in between the two limits that are convenient for theories: inviscid steady flows around an airfoil and Stokes flow experienced by a swimming bacterium. For this reason, this intermediate range is not well understood. On the other hand, it is perhaps the most ubiquitous regime among the things we see. Falling leaves and seeds, fishes, and birds all encounter unsteady flows similar to that seen around an insect. In addition to the Reynolds number, there are at least two other relevant dimensionless parameters. A wing has three velocity scales: the flapping velocity with respect to the body (u), the forward velocity of the body (U0), and the pitching velocity (Ωc). The ratios of them form two dimensionless variables, U0/u and Ωc/u, the former is often referred to as the advance ratio, and it is also related to the reduced frequency, fc/U0. If an insect wing is rigid, for example, a Drosophila wing is approximately so, its motion relative to a fixed body can be described by three variables: the position of the tip in spherical coordinates, (Θ(t),Φ(t)), and the pitching angle ψ(t), about the axis connecting the root and the tip. To estimate the aerodynamic forces based on blade-element analysis, it is also necessary to determine the angle of attack (α). The typical angle of attack at 70% wingspan ranges from 25° to 45° in hovering insects (15° in hummingbirds). Despite the wealth of data available for many insects, relatively few experiments report the time variation of α during a stroke. They include wind tunnel experiments of a tethered locust and a tethered fly, and free hovering flight of a fruit fly. Because they are relatively easy to measure, the wing-tip trajectories have been reported more frequently. For example, selecting only flight sequences that produced enough lift to support a weight, will show that the wing tip follows an elliptical shape. Noncrossing shapes were also reported for other insects. Regardless of their exact shapes, the plugging-down motion indicates that insects may use aerodynamic drag in addition to lift to support its weight. =Hovering= { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" style=\\"margin-left: 3em; float:right\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\" Flight parameters ! scope=\\"col\\" Speed/mph ! scope=\\"col\\" Beats/s - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Aeshnid dragonfly  15.6  38 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Hornet  12.8  100 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Hummingbird hawkmoth  11.1  85 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Horsefly  8.8  96 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Syrphid hoverfly  7.8  120 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Bumblebee  6.4  130 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Honeybee  5.7  250 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Housefly  4.4  190 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Damselfly  3.3  16 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Scorpionfly  1.1  28 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Large white butterfly  5.6  12 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Thrips (clap and fling)  0.68  254 } Many insects can hover, or stay in one spot in the air, doing so by beating their wings rapidly. The ability to do so, though, is complex; requiring the use of sideways stabilization as well as the lift necessary to overcome the force of gravity. The lifting force is caused by the downward stroke of the wings. As the wings push down on the surrounding air, the result reaction force of the air on the wings force the insect up. The wings of most insects are evolved so that, during the upward stroke, the force on the wing is small. Due to the fact that the upbeat and downbeat force the insect down and up respectively, the insect oscillates and winds up staying in the same position. The distance the insect falls between wingbeats depends on how rapidly its wings are beating. If the insect flaps its wings at a slow rate, the time interval during which the lifting force is zero is longer, and therefore the insect falls farther than if its wings were beating rapidly. One can calculate the wingbeat frequency necessary for the insect to maintain a given stability in its amplitude. To simplify the calculations, one must assume that the lifting force is at a finite constant value while the wings are moving down and that it is zero while the wings are moving up. During the time interval Δt of the upward wingbeat, the insect drops a distance h under the influence of gravity. :h=\\\\frac{g(\\\\Delta t^2)}{2} The upward stroke then restores the insect to its original position. Typically, it may be required that the vertical position of the insect change by no more than 0.1 mm (i.e., h=0.1 mm). The maximum allowable time for free fall is then : \\\\Delta t=\\\\left( \\\\frac{2h}{g} \\\\right)^{1/2}=\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2 \\\\times 10^{-2}\\\\text{ cm}}{980\\\\text{ cm}/\\\\text{s}^2}} \\\\approx 4.5 \\\\times 10^{-3}\\\\text{ s} Since the up movements and the down movements of the wings are about equal in duration, the period T for a complete up-and-down wing is twice Δr, that is, : T=2\\\\,\\\\Delta t=9 \\\\times 10^{-3}\\\\text{ s} The frequency of the beats, f, meaning the number of wingbeats per second, is represented by the equation: : f=\\\\frac1T \\\\approx 110 \\\\text{ s}^{-1} In the examples used the frequency used is 110 beats/s, which is the typical frequency found in insects. Butterflies have a much slower frequency with about 10 beats/s, which means that they can't hover. Other insects may be able to produce a frequency of 1000 beats/s. To restore the insect to its original vertical position, the average upward force during the downward stroke, Fav, must be equal to twice the weight of the insect. Note that since the upward force on the insect body is applied only for half the time, the average upward force on the insect is simply its weight. Power input One can now compute the power required to maintain hovering by, considering again an insect with mass m 0.1 g, average force, Fav, applied by the two wings during the downward stroke is two times the weight. Because the pressure applied by the wings is uniformly distributed over the total wing area, that means one can assume the force generated by each wing acts through a single point at the midsection of the wings. During the downward stroke, the center of the wings traverses a vertical distance d. The total work done by the insect during each downward stroke is the product of force and distance; that is, : \\\\text {Work}=F_{av}\\\\times d =\\\\text{2Wd}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! If the wings swing through the beat at an angle of 70°, then in the case presented for the insect with 1 cm long wings, d is 0.57 cm. Therefore, the work done during each stroke by the two wings is: : \\\\text {Work}=2\\\\times0.1\\\\times980\\\\times0.57 =112\\\\text{erg}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! After, the energy has to go somewhere; here, in the example used, the mass of the insect has to be raised 0.1 mm during each downstroke. The energy E required for this task is: : \\\\text {E}=\\\\text {mgh}=0.1\\\\times980\\\\times10^{-2}=0.98\\\\text {erg}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! This is a negligible fraction of the total energy expended which clearly, most of the energy is expended in other processes. A more detailed analysis of the problem shows that the work done by the wings is converted primarily into kinetic energy of the air that is accelerated by the downward stroke of the wings. The power is the amount of work done in 1 s; in the insect used as an example, makes 110 downward strokes per second. Therefore, its power output P is, strokes per second, and that means its power output P is: : \\\\text {P}= 112 \\\\text {erg} \\\\times110\\\\text {/s}=1.23\\\\times10^4\\\\text {erg/s}=1.23\\\\times10^{-3}\\\\text {W} Power output In the calculation of the power used in hovering, the examples used neglected the kinetic energy of the moving wings. The wings of insects, light as they are, have a finite mass; therefore, as they move they possess kinetic energy. Because the wings are in rotary motion, the maximum kinetic energy during each wing stroke is: : KE= \\\\frac12 I\\\\omega_\\\\text {max}^2 Here I is the moment of inertia of the wing and ωmax is the maximum angular velocity during the wing stroke. To obtain the moment of inertia for the wing, we will assume that the wing can be approximated by a thin rod pivoted at one end. The moment of inertia for the wing is then: : I=\\\\frac{m\\\\ell^2}{3} Where l is the length of the wing (1 cm) and m is the mass of two wings, which may be typically 10−3 g. The maximum angular velocity, ωmax, can be calculated from the maximum linear velocity, νmax, at the center of the wing: : \\\\omega_\\\\text {max}=\\\\frac{v_\\\\text {max}}{\\\\ell/2} During each stroke the center of the wings moves with an average linear velocity νav given by the distance d traversed by the center of the wing divided by the duration Δt of the wing stroke. From our previous example, d=0.57 cm and Δt=4.5×10−3 s. Therefore: :v_{av}=\\\\frac{d}{\\\\Delta t}=\\\\frac{0.57}{4.5\\\\times10^{-3}}=127\\\\text {cm/s} The velocity of the wings is zero both at the beginning and at the end of the wing stroke, meaning the maximum linear velocity is higher than the average velocity. If we assume that the velocity varies sinusoidally along the wing path, the maximum velocity is twice as high as the average velocity. Therefore, the maximum angular velocity is: : \\\\omega_\\\\text {max}=\\\\frac{254}{\\\\ell/2} And the kinetic energy therefore is: : KE=\\\\frac12 I\\\\omega_{max}^2=\\\\left ( 10^{-3} \\\\frac{\\\\ell^2}{3} \\\\right ) \\\\left ( \\\\frac{254}{\\\\ell/2} \\\\right )^2=43 \\\\text { erg} Since there are two wing strokes (the upstroke and downstroke) in each cycle of the wing movement, the kinetic energy is 2×43=86 erg. This is about as much energy as is consumed in hovering itself. =Elasticity= right Insects gain kinetic energy, provided by the muscles, when they accelerate. When the wings begin to decelerate toward the end of the stroke, this energy must dissipate. During the downstroke, the kinetic energy is dissipated by the muscles themselves and is converted into heat (this heat is sometimes used to maintain core body temperature). Some insects are able to utilize the kinetic energy in the upward movement of the wings to aid in their flight. The wing joints of these insects contain a pad of elastic, rubber-like protein called resilin. During the upstroke of the wing, the resilin is stretched. The kinetic energy of the wing is converted into potential energy in the stretched resilin, which stores the energy much like a spring. When the wing moves down, this energy is released and aids in the downstroke. Using a few simplifying assumptions, we can calculate the amount of energy stored in the stretched resilin. Although the resilin is bent into a complex shape, the example given shows the calculation as a straight rod of area A and length. Furthermore, we will assume that throughout the stretch the resilin obeys Hooke's law. This is not strictly true as the resilin is stretched by a considerable amount and therefore both the area and Young’s modulus change in the process of stretching. The energy E stored in the stretched resilin is: : E=\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\frac{Y A \\\\Delta \\\\ell^2}{\\\\ell} Here Y is the Young’s modulus for resilin, which has been measured to be 1.8×107 dyn/cm2. Typically, in an insect the size of a bee the volume of the resilin may be equivalent to a cylinder 2×10−2 cm long and 4×10−4 cm2 in area. In the example given, the length of the resilin rod is increased by 50% when stretched. That is, Δℓ is 10−2 cm. Therefore, in this case the energy stored in the resilin of each wing is: : E=\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\frac{1.8 \\\\times 10^7 \\\\times 4 \\\\times 10^{-4} \\\\times 10^{-4}}{2 \\\\times 10^{-2}}=18\\\\ \\\\text{erg} The stored energy in the two wings is 36 erg, which is comparable to the kinetic energy in the upstroke of the wings. Experiments show that as much as 80% of the kinetic energy of the wing may be stored in the resilin. =Wing coupling= Frenulo-retinacular wing coupling in male and female moths Some four-winged insect orders, such as the Lepidoptera, have developed a wide variety of morphological wing coupling mechanisms in the imago which render these taxa as \\"functionally dipterous\\". All but the most basal forms exhibit this wing-coupling.Stocks, Ian. (2008). Sec.Wing Coupling in Capinera (Ed) (2008) \\"Encyc. Entom.\\", Vol 4. p. 4266 The mechanisms are of three different types - jugal, frenulo-retinacular and amplexiform. The more primitive groups have an enlarged lobe-like area near the basal posterior margin, i.e. at the base of the forewing, called jugum, that folds under the hindwing in flight.Powell, Jerry A. Ch. Lepidoptera (pp. 631-664) in Resh, & Cardé (Eds). \\"Encyclopedia of Insects\\". 2003. Other groups have a frenulum on the hindwing that hooks under a retinaculum on the forewing. In the butterflies (except the male of one species of hesperiid) and in the Bombycoidea (except the Sphingidae), there is no arrangement of frenulum and retinaculum to couple the wings. Instead, an enlarged humeral area of the hindwing is broadly overlapped by the forewing. Despite the absence of a specific mechanical connection, the wings overlap and operate in phase. The power stroke of the forewing pushes down the hindwing in unison. This type of coupling is a variation of frenate type but where the frenulum and retinaculum are completely lost.Gorb, S. (2001) Ch 4.1.5 \\"Inter-locking of body parts\\". pp 46–50. =Biochemistry= The biochemistry of insect flight has been a focus of considerable study. While many insects use carbohydrates and lipids as the energy source for flight, many beetles and flies use the amino acid proline as their energy source.Woiwod, I.P.; Reynolds, D.R.; Thomas, C.D. (Eds) 2001. Insect Movement: Mechanisms and Consequences. CAB International. Some species also use a combination of sources and moths such as Manduca sexta use carbohydrates for pre-flight warm-up. Evolution and adaptation Hoverfly (Xanthogramma pedissequum) has indirect flight musculature. Sometime in the Carboniferous Period, some 350 million years ago, when there were only two major land masses, insects began flying. How and why insect wings developed is not well understood, largely due to the scarcity of appropriate fossils from the period of their development in the Lower Carboniferous. There are three main theories on the origins of insect flight: that wings developed from paranotal lobes, extensions of the thoracic terga; that they are modifications of movable abdominal gills, as found on aquatic naiads of mayflies; or that they developed from thoracic protrusions used as radiators. Phylogenomic analysis suggests that the Polyneoptera and winged insects evolved from a terrestrial ancestor, making the evolution of wings from gills unlikely. =Paranotal hypothesis= The paranotal hypothesis suggests that the insect's wings developed from paranotal lobes, a preadaptation found in insect fossils that is believed to have assisted stabilization while hopping or falling. In favor of this hypothesis is the tendency of most insects, when startled while climbing on branches, to escape by dropping to the ground. Such lobes would have served as parachutes and enable the insect to land more softly. The theory suggests that these lobes gradually grew larger and in a later stage developed a joint with the thorax. Even later would appear the muscles to move these crude wings. This model implies a progressive increase in the effectiveness of the wings, starting with parachuting, then gliding and finally active flight. Still, lack of substantial fossil evidence of the development of the wing joints and muscles poses a major difficulty to the theory, as does the seemingly spontaneous development of articulation and venation, and it has been largely rejected by experts in the field. =Epicoxal hypothesis= Some entomologists have suggested that a possible origin for insect wings might have been movable abdominal gills found in many aquatic insects, such as on naiads of mayflies. According to this theory these tracheal gills, which started their way as exits of the respiratory system and over time were modified into locomotive purposes, eventually developed into wings. The tracheal gills are equipped with little winglets that perpetually vibrate and have their own tiny straight muscles. =Endite-exite hypothesis= The hypothesis with perhaps the strongest evidence is that which stems from the adaptation of endites and exites, appendages on the respective inner and outer aspects of the primitive arthropod limb. This was advanced by Trueman based on a study by Goldschmidt in 1945 on Drosophila melanogaster, in which a pod variation displayed a mutation transforming normal wings to what was interpreted as a triple-jointed leg arrangement with some additional appendages but lacking the tarsus, where the wing's costal surface normally would be. This mutation was reinterpreted as strong evidence for a dorsal exite and endite fusion, rather than a leg, with the appendages fitting in much better with this hypothesis. The innervation, articulation and musculature required for the evolution of wings are already present in the limb segments (podomeres).Trueman, J.W.H. (1990), Comment: evolution of insect wings: a limb exite plus endite model. Canadian Journal of Zoology. =Other hypotheses= Suggestions have been made that wings may have evolved initially for sailing on the surface of water as seen in some stoneflies. An alternative idea is that it derives from directed aerial gliding descent—a preflight phenomena found in some apterygote, a wingless sister taxa to the winged insects.

Parts of the route have existed since c. 1939, and the rest of the highway has existed since c. 1988. Route description KY 12 begins at a junction with KY 43 near Christianburg and travels east toward Bagdad passing through a rural area of mostly farmland. In Bagdad KY 12 forms a short concurrency with KY 395 before heading east out of Bagdad. east of KY 395 the route forms a brief concurrency with KY 1005 and turns toward the northeast. After a few tenths of a mile KY 12 turns back toward the east and enters Franklin County where it becomes more narrow and curvy. from the Shelby County line, KY 12 forms a junction with US 421. East of US 421 the route is known as Flat Creek Road and it winds toward the northeast and then to the north. KY 12 terminates at the Franklin-Henry County line just west of the Kentucky River. Nearly the entire route passes through rural sections of Shelby and Franklin Counties. History By at least 1939, the portion of highway traveling from State Route 43 to State Route 37 near the location of the present highway was designated as State Route 12. The portion of this road that traveled from KY 43 to the community of Bagdad had a graded, hard surface, the portion traveling from Bagdad to the Franklin County line was gravel surfaced, while the rest of the highway was unimproved. Between 1939 and 1941, the rest of present-day Route 12 was created as a graded, unpaved road, but was not yet designated as part of the highway. The next year, the entire length of the portion of the highway in Shelby County was improved. From 1942 to 1955, the portion of highway in Shelby County underwent minor rerouted, with an overall length of . Also by 1955, the Franklin County portion had been named Dry Ridge Road. At least two years later, the length of the highway located from the western terminus to Bagdad had been paved.

In 1887 it was reconstituted as the Scarritt Collegiate Institute. History Opening its doors on September 2, 1878, the school's first home was inside the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, in Neosho. D. M. Conway was its first president. Outgrowing the church, in October 1878 the school purchased a local house and moved into it. In 1880, under the leadership of G. H. Williamson, the seminary was incorporated, taking the name Neosho Collegiate Institute. Led by W. C. Montgomery, and having again outgrown its new home, the school built a new facility at the same location. In the spring of 1887, after several years of financial difficulties, the Neosho Collegiate Institute was forced to close. After a donation by Dr. Nathan Spencer Scarritt of Kansas City, the school reopened the following spring under the name Scarritt Collegiate Institute, in honor of its benefactor. After several years of success and growth, starting in 1900 several setbacks led to a steady decline in enrollment.

Caught by surprise by Field Marshal Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg's main Coalition army, the forces under Marmont and Mortier were steadily driven back and finally completely routed by aggressive Allied horsemen and gunners, suffering heavy casualties and the loss of most of their artillery. Two divisions of French National Guards under Michel-Marie Pacthod escorting a nearby convoy were also attacked and wiped out in the Battle of Bannes. The battleground was near the town Fère-Champenoise located southwest of Châlons- en-Champagne. After being defeated at the Battle of Arcis-sur-Aube on 20–21 March 1814, Emperor Napoleon moved to the east. He hoped to draw the Coalition armies away from Paris by cutting their supply lines, but Schwarzenberg's army instead began moving west toward Paris. Meanwhile, Marmont and Mortier were marching to join Napoleon, pursued by Field Marshal Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher's Allied army. As the two marshals moved east near Fère-Champenoise they unexpectedly came into collision with Schwarzenberg heading west and Blücher moving south. Belatedly realizing they were marching into a trap, the French began a withdrawal to the west. After six hours of orderly retreat, a sudden violent rainstorm made it difficult for the French foot soldiers to fire their muskets and the Allies' enormous superiority in cavalry proved decisive. With the corps of Marmont and Mortier crippled, the Allied capture of Paris was practically inevitable and the Battle of Paris followed on 30 March. Background =Napoleon's operations= On 9–10 March 1814, Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher's 100,000-man Coalition army defeated Napoleon's 39,000-strong army in the Battle of Laon. After drubbing the French on 9 March, Blücher became incapacitated by fever and an eye ailment, so command devolved upon his chief of staff August Neidhardt von Gneisenau. Though Gneisenau was a brilliant strategist, he was not capable of leading an army. The acting commander allowed his beaten foes to continue the fight the next day and then slip away that night without being pursued. On 13 March, Napoleon fell on Emmanuel de Saint-Priest's Russian VIII Corps and a Prussian brigade in the Battle of Reims. The Allied force was scattered with losses of 3,000 men and 23 guns, including Saint-Priest who was fatally wounded. After three days of reorganization, Napoleon left Auguste de Marmont and Édouard Mortier, duc de Trévise with 21,000 troops to watch Blücher while he tried to outflank Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg's main army by moving against Arcis-sur- Aube. Marshal Michel Ney marched southeast from Reims to recapture Châlons- sur-Marne. At this time, Schwarzenberg's army threatened to cross the Seine River and press back Marshal Jacques MacDonald's wing of the French army. News of Saint-Priest's rout reached Coalition headquarters on 16 March. This prompted the Austrian field marshal to make the intelligent decision to fall back and reassemble his army between Troyes and Arcis-sur-Aube. Campaign map shows Fère-Champenoise southwest of Châlons-sur-Marne at map center. Believing that it was only necessary to deliver a sharp blow to send the cautious Schwarzenberg into retreat, Napoleon occupied Arcis at mid-day on 20 March. Soon after, a large body of Coalition horsemen threw back the French cavalry, but the situation was stabilized that evening after a tough struggle. The next day, Napoleon ordered an attack only to find his 28,000 soldiers facing 80,000 Allies. Thanks to Schwarzenberg's hesitation, the French emperor quickly pulled his army to the north bank of the Aube River covered by stout rearguard fighting, but the Battle of Arcis-sur-Aube on 20–21 March was a Coalition victory. After this setback, Napoleon determined to operate against the Allied supply line stretching back to the Rhine River while adding the fortress garrisons to his army. Accordingly, he moved northeast toward Vitry-le- François with the intention of continuing east along the Marne River to Saint- Dizier. By this maneuver, the French emperor hoped to lure the Allies after him and away from Paris. MacDonald's wing was in great peril as it moved east on the north bank of the Aube. Though Marshal Nicolas Oudinot's corps held the northern suburb of Arcis-sur-Aube, MacDonald's own corps only reached the vicinity of Arcis at 9:00 pm on 21 March. Étienne Maurice Gérard's corps was farther west at Plancy-l'Abbaye while François Pierre Joseph Amey's division brought up the rear at Anglure. Jean François Leval's rearguard successfully destroyed the bridges and the Allies did not attempt to force their way across the Aube that evening. Because of Allied inertia, MacDonald successfully held the north bank of the Aube on 22 March. Finding Vitry-le-François solidly held by 5,000 Russians, Napoleon with Ney's corps, the Imperial Guard and his cavalry crossed the Marne south of the town and continued toward Saint-Dizier. On the way, the French light cavalry seized a Coalition convoy and dispersed its two-battalion escort. On the night of 22 March, MacDonald's troops silently left their blocking position opposite Arcis-sur-Aube and marched through Dosnon and Sommesous toward Vitry-le-François. Amey was supposed to guard the artillery park, but by a misunderstanding, that general marched his division northwest to Sézanne. Consequently, the Russian Guard Light Cavalry Division attacked the unguarded wagon train, carrying off 15 artillery pieces and 300 prisoners while destroying the gunpowder and spiking 12 cannons. Coming on the scene, Gérard's corps rescued what was left of MacDonald's artillery park. Despite constant skirmishing with Karl Philipp von Wrede's Allied corps during the day, MacDonald got his troops safely across the Marne late on 23 March. At that hour, Napoleon was in Saint-Dizier with his Guard while Ney was between there and Vitry. =Marmont's operations= Prince Schwarzenberg Blücher's army finally lurched into motion on 18 March, with its commander wearing a lady's green silk hat in order to protect his inflamed eyes from the sun. On this day, Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg's corps compelled Étienne Pierre Sylvestre Ricard's division to abandon Berry-au-Bac though the French managed to destroy the bridge over the Aisne River. Marmont had overall command of the forces facing Blücher and his orders were to cover Paris and stop his foes from crossing the Aisne. Mortier was at Reims while Henri François Marie Charpentier's division held Soissons. Since Blücher had 109,000 troops while the French only mustered 13,000 infantry and 3,600 cavalry, it was plain that the Allies could not be stopped for long. In order to block the road to Paris and to rendezvous with Charpentier, Marmont fell back southwest toward Fismes and called in Mortier from Reims. He believed that Blücher wished to bring him to battle, but in fact the Prussian field marshal was heading for Reims and Châlons-sur-Marne to link up with Schwarzenberg. Auguste de Marmont Blücher assigned only the corps of Yorck and Friedrich Graf Kleist von Nollendorf to follow Marmont. By 19 March, Blucher had established two bridges over the Aisne and sent Ferdinand von Wintzingerode's corps south to capture Reims. Wintzingerode occupied Reims at daybreak on 20 March after it was evacuated by Augustin Daniel Belliard who led Mortier's cavalry. At this hour, Louis Alexandre Andrault de Langeron's Russian corps was at Berry-au-Bac while Fabian Gottlieb von Osten-Sacken's Russian corps was nearby at Pontavert. Blücher ordered Wintzingerode to hold Reims with his infantry and send his cavalry to Épernay and Vitry-le-François. Charpentier left a 2,800-man garrison in Soissons before pulling out to join Marmont and Mortier. On 21 March, there was a cavalry scuffle at Oulchy-le-Château between Yorck and Kleist's cavalry and the French, but the Prussians did not pursue. Having picked up Charpentier's division, Marmont and Mortier crossed the Marne at Château-Thierry and destroyed the bridge. Also on the 21st, Marmont received a dispatch from Napoleon rebuking him for not retreating from Reims toward Châlons-sur-Marne and ordering him to move back in that direction. On 22 March, the two marshals headed east toward Étoges. That day Friedrich Wilhelm Freiherr von Bülow's Prussian corps appeared before Soissons and began bombarding the place. Battle of Fère-Champenoise showing the strategic situation on 25 March 1814. By nightfall on 23 March, Marmont's troops were in Vertus while Mortier's corps reached Étoges. That evening near Bergères-lès- Vertus, Christophe Antoine Merlin's French advance guard drove off some Allied cavalry, capturing 100 troopers and 16 wagon loads of plunder. A French staff officer found some enemy dispatches in Vertus that indicated the armies of Schwarzenberg and Blücher might link up and march toward Paris. The two marshals believed they were planted to trick the French so the information was disregarded.On pages 332–335, Nafziger's text substitutes Oudinot for Marmont. On other pages Nafziger correctly names the two marshals as Marmont and Mortier. Oudinot was with Napoleon's army during this time. By the evening of 23 March, Oudinot and MacDonald's corps arrived at Saint-Dizier, Ney's troops were to the south at Wassy and Napoleon and the Imperial Guard were yet farther south at Doulevant-le-Château. Well in advance of the rest, Napoleon's cavalry reached Colombey-les-Deux-Eglises near Bar-sur-Aube. On 23 March, the divisions of Michel-Marie Pacthod with 4,000 men and Amey with 1,800 men reached Sézanne. They found an 80-wagon food and equipment convoy in the village with its escort of 800 foot soldiers and one squadron of the 13th Hussar Regiment. Finding that Marmont and Mortier were nearby, they set out with the convoy toward Étoges. Soon after they left Sézanne, Jean Dominique Compans arrived in the village to set up a communications base, followed by two cavalry march regiments. Édouard Mortier On 23 March, Wintzingerode with 8,000 cavalry and 40 guns arrived near Vitry-le-François while Mikhail Semyonovich Vorontsov with Wintzingerode's infantry plus Langeron and Sacken were coming up behind. Yorck and Kleist reached Château-Thierry. After a captured French message indicated that Napoleon was at Saint-Dizier, the Allies decided to merge their two armies and go after Napoleon with 200,000 troops. With the French emperor already blocking their supply line to Germany, the Allies determined to establish a new line from the Netherlands to Laon. At Bar-sur-Aube, Emperor Francis I of Austria was warned to leave for Dijon. Francis fled to safety with the Austrian Army of the South a few hours ahead of the French cavalry. On the evening of 23 March, a message from Napoleon's Chief of Police Anne Jean Marie René Savary was intercepted by Friedrich Karl von Tettenborn's Cossacks. It stated that there was nothing in the arsenals and treasury at Paris and that the city's increasingly restive population was demanding peace. More information arrived from Napoleon's enemies in Paris. After looking at the captured messages, Czar Alexander I of Russia at his headquarters at Sompuis concluded that the Allied armies should advance on Paris. He asked Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly, Hans Karl von Diebitsch and Karl Wilhelm von Toll for their advice. Barclay wished to follow Napoleon but Toll wanted to move on Paris while sending 10,000 cavalry to hide the maneuver from Napoleon. After Diebitsch came around to Toll and Alexander's point of view, they convinced first King Frederick William III of Prussia and then Schwarzenberg of their plan. On 24 March, Schwarzenberg's army moved north toward Vitry-le-François, but new orders were issued for the following day. Wintzingerode was instructed to chase after Napoleon with his cavalry force. The VI Corps supported by the IV Corps were ordered to march west toward Fère- Champenoise with their combined cavalry in front. The Guards and Reserves were directed on the same place from Sompuis while the III Corps was to move north from Mailly-le-Camp. Vorontsov, Langeron and Sacken of Blücher's army were instructed to move west from Châlons-sur-Marne toward Étoges. By the evening of 24 March, Schwarzenberg's host was near Vitry, on the east bank of the Coole (Côle) River. Battle =Fighting withdrawal= Peter Pahlen After a lively debate between Belliard and the two marshals over what was the best route to approach the Marne, on 24 March the French marched through Fère- Champenoise and Vatry. Henri Catherine Balthazard Vincent moved toward Montmirail with 300 men watch for Yorck and Kleist. During the day, Mortier's cavalry scouted in the direction of Châlons and Saint-Quentin-sur-Coole, finding only a few hundred enemy cavalry in Châlons and no Allied troops near Nuisement-sur-Coole. Marmont scouted toward Maisons-en-Champagne and found no enemies. Based on these reports, the two marshals decided that Schwarzenberg was south of Saint-Dizier, maneuvering against Napoleon. Bolstered in their opinions by the day's reconnaissances, Marmont and Mortier failed to reconsider even when large numbers of campfires were observed that night beyond the Coole. Marmont's troops camped between Vatry and Soudé while Mortier's bivouacked farther north. Battle of Fère-Champenoise On 25 March at 3:30 am Peter Petrovich Pahlen began to send out patrols at the request of Crown Prince Frederick William of Württemberg. The Allied advance was conducted in two columns. The first column on the main highway west from Vitry-le-François consisted of the Crown Prince (IV Corps) and Nikolay Raevsky (VI Corps), followed by Wrede (V Corps). The second column on more a southerly route through Montépreux was composed of the Guard and Reserves while Ignaz Gyulai (III Corps) was directed to march toward Semoine. From Coole Pahlen's 3,600 cavalry led the advance of the first column until his horsemen appeared before Soudé between 6:00 and 8:00 am. Meanwhile, Mortier's corps was on the march at 6:00 from Vatry toward Soudé with Nicolas-François Roussel d'Hurbal's dragoons leading the column. Startled when Pahlen's guns began bombarding his positions, Marmont deployed his own infantry and artillery on a rise to the west of Soudé and sent a note for Mortier to quickly join him. Sensing Marmont's alarm, Pahlen and Prince Adam of Württemberg chose to attack at once. Pahlen sent Dechterev's brigade around Marmont's left flank, Delivanov's brigade against the French center and Lissanovich's brigade and Illowaisky's 1,000 Cossacks north to Dommartin-Lettrée. Prince Adam and the Württemberger cavalry operated on Marmont's right flank while Nikolay Vasilyevich Kretov's Cuirassier Division and 12 guns of Markov's 23rd Horse Artillery Battery supported the center attack. Very soon the Allies had 10,000 cavalry on the field to oppose 4,934 French cavalry. This included 2,305 troopers from Johann Nepomuk von Nostitz-Rieneck's Austrian Cuirassier Division. With both his flanks turned Marmont ordered a retreat. When his cavalry under Étienne Tardif de Pommeroux de Bordesoulle moved forward it was beaten back with heavy losses. Two French light companies in Soudé were swallowed up by the Allied cavalry. When Mortier's corps reached Dommartin-Lettrée, Belliard's cavalry shoved Pahlen's cavalry out of the way. However, Illowaisky's Cossacks managed to cut off Charpentier's division at the rear of the column, forcing it to head for Sommesous. Marmont finally united the two corps at Sommesous and placed his cavalry in the first line and his infantry in the second line. He deployed Mortier on the left with his flank covered by Charles Étienne de Ghigny's horsemen. The French put 60 guns in action which dominated the Allies' 36 available guns in a two-hour artillery duel. Menaced by Illowaisky's Cossacks, the French pulled their left flank back behind the stream flowing northwest from Sommesous. On the opposite side of the stream were the Cossacks and Dechterev's brigade near Lenharrée. About noon, François Joseph Desfour's Austrian cuirassier brigade charged together with the Archduke Ferdinand Hussar Nr. 3 and 4th Württemberg Mounted Jäger Regiments. In the face of this attack, Marmont began to draw back into a position where both his flanks were protected by streams. =Marmont's defeat= Nikolay Depreradovich Prince Adam's charge pressed back the right flank French cavalry, but when the Liechtenstein Cuirassier Regiment tried to exploit the success, it was blasted by canister shot and hit in the flank by French lancers. Prince Adam paused to reorganize his horsemen. At the same time, Nostitz and Pahlen charged the French left and became embroiled in a melee with the cavalry divisions of Roussel d'Hurbal and Merlin. The Allies were more successful and managed to capture five French field pieces near Lenharrée. At Connantray-Vaurefroy the retreating French began to cross a small stream lined with trees running through a depression. At the moment they were negotiating this obstacle, a powerful storm from the east blew first dust and then rain and hail into the faces of the French. Grand Duke Konstantin Pavlovich of Russia leading Nikolay Ivanovich Depreradovich's crack 1st Russian Cuirassier Division and the Russian Guard Dragoons and Guard Uhlans charged the French right flank as Pahlen attacked the French left. The massed Allied cavalry charge routed Bordesoulle's cavalry which was disorganized by crossing the stream. After the French horsemen galloped to the rear, the Coalition cavalry broke two regiments of Young Guard that failed to form square in time. Many French soldiers were cut down, eight cannons were seized and brigade commander Jean Baptiste Jamin de Bermuy became a prisoner. In the rainstorm, the French infantrymen could no longer fire their wet muskets. Jacques Le Capitaine's 1,000-man brigade repelled three cavalry charges while in square, but a fourth charge smashed the formation, inflicting heavy losses. During this time a Russian Guard artillery battery took the French under accurate fire. Fortunately for the French, the divisions Ricard and Charles- Joseph Christiani, at the ends of the line held firm, allowing a brief rally. A French Young Guard brigade supported by eight 12-pound cannons repelled two charges by the Archduke Ferdinand Hussars. At this point, Alexander Nikitich Seslavin's Cossacks appeared on the field, prompting the survivors of Jamin's mauled brigade to run away. The panic spread and Marmont's entire force streamed to the rear. The French were saved when the 400-strong 9 March Regiment, made up of heavy cavalry, arrived from Sézanne and drove off the pursuing Allied horsemen. In the breathing space, Marmont and Mortier reorganized their battered corps in two lines near Fère-Champenoise. Hearing the sounds of approaching gunfire, the French soldiers quickly rallied and cheered \\"Long live the emperor!\\" believing that Napoleon was coming to their rescue. Actually, the sounds were from the Coalition attacks on Pacthod's force. The Allied generals swiftly called off most of their cavalry to concentrate on Pacthod's destruction. Nevertheless, Marmont's troops were soon hustled off the field by Seslavin's Cossacks and reached Allemant at 9:00 pm. =Pacthod's disaster= Fyodor Karlovich Korff Pacthod's force departed from Vatry at dawn, having marched most of the night with the convoy. By 10:00 am Pacthod was in Villeseneux where he decided to rest his weary soldiers. At this time, the force came under attack from 1,200 dragoons and horse chasseurs supported by 12 guns under Fyodor Karlovich Korf. Pacthod anchored his right flank on Villeseneux while Amey's entire division in square formed his left flank and 16 French guns covered the front. Korff's cavalry corps belonged to Langeron's army corps. For 90 minutes, the French moved southwest deployed in six masses while easily fending off Korf's horsemen. At Clamanges Pacthod made the decision to abandon the convoy, taking the teams of horses to help haul his artillery pieces. More Russian cavalry arrived until Korf's force comprised 2,000 line cavalry and 1,000 Cossacks. Two horse chasseur regiments circled around to the west, blocking the French retreat toward Fère- Champenoise. One of Pacthod's brigades under Marie Joseph Raymond Delort formed attack columns and drove off the chasseurs. Between 2:00 and 3:00 pm the French reached Écury-le-Repos when more Allied cavalry came on the scene. Michel Pacthod The sounds of Delort's action drew the cavalry of Sacken's army corps in the form of the 2nd Hussar Division under Ilarion Vasilievich Vasilshikov. To help Korf's tiring horsemen, Vasilshikov's hussars charged the French from the north and forced them to form square. Simultaneously, Schwarzenberg, Czar Alexander and King Frederick William III arrived on the battlefield and set up their headquarters in Fère-Champenoise. Kretov sent a note to the czar that Pacthod's French troops were headed his way. At first Kretov's report was not credited but soon the Allied sovereigns could see for themselves that a French force was approaching. Czar Alexander ordered the Prussian Guard Cavalry and the Russian Guard Hussars and Guard Cossacks into the fight and instructed the 23rd Horse Battery to open fire on Pacthod's men. Because the French were in low ground, the Russian round shot and canister sailed over them and began striking Vasilshikov's horsemen. Returning fire, Vasilshikov's gunners nearly hit the czar's entourage with friendly fire when four round shots landed nearby. After sorting out the confusion, the czar ordered Korff and Vasilshikov not to charge in order to let the Allied artillery batter Pacthod's squares. Pahlen's cavalry were recalled from the fight against Marmont and sent to block Pacthod on the southwest while 30 Russian guns blasted the French from the south. As Pacthod's situation became increasingly dire, he ordered his force to march toward the Marshes of Saint- Gond. Despite being ringed by enemy cavalry, his National Guardsmen held firm in their square formations. Vasilshikov led the Guard Cavalry plus two dragoon and one horse chasseur regiments in a sweeping charge but the horsemen were driven off by intense musketry. By this time 78 Russian guns were pummeling Pacthod's squares with canister, causing casualties and increasing disorder. Louis Marie Joseph Thévenet's brigade of Amey's division fought its way as far west as Bannes before being blocked by the elite Russian Chevalier Guard Regiment. Three Russian officers and a trumpeter came forward under a flag of truce to demand Pacthod's surrender. The French general refused to negotiate as long as the enemy artillery were firing and made one of the officers a prisoner; another was shot dead by a foot soldier. In a climactic charge, the massed Russian cavalry broke the square on the French right flank and then overran the other squares, one after the other. In the subsequent melee, the French soldiers were cut down or surrendered and generals Pacthod, Amey, Delort, Thévenet and Marie Louis Joseph Bonté became Allied prisoners. The raw National Guardsmen made a gallant defense but barely 500 men escaped the slaughter. Forces Nikolay Kretov According to historian George Nafziger, the Allies employed 26,400 cavalry and 128 artillery pieces. Crown Prince Frederick William commanded 2,000 Württembergers and 12 guns, 3,500 Russians and 12 guns in Palen's Cavalry Corps and 1,600 Russians and 12 guns in Kretov's 2nd Cuirassier Division. Nostitz led 3,700 Austrians and 24 guns in his own Cuirassier Division and two regiments of chevau-légers. Grand Duke Konstantin directed 1,600 Russians and 12 guns from the Guard Cuirassier Division and 2,400 Russians and 12 guns from the Guard Light Cavalry Brigade. In addition, there were 800 Prussian Guards and eight guns, 5,400 Russians and 22 guns in Korf's Cavalry Corps, 3,900 Russians and 12 guns in Vasilshikov's 2nd Hussar Division and Seslavin's 1,500 Don Cossacks and two guns. Nafziger stated that the French used 18,100 foot soldiers, 4,350 horsemen and 84 guns. Mortier's command included 7,400 Imperial Guard infantry and 30 guns in three divisions led by Christiani, Philibert Jean-Baptiste Curial and Charpentier. Mortier also had 2,050 line cavalry under Roussel d'Hurbal and Ghigny. Marmont's corps consisted of 4,900 line infantry and 38 guns in the divisions of Ricard, Joseph Lagrange and Jean-Toussaint Arrighi de Casanova. Marmont's 2,300 line cavalry were led by Bordesoulle and Merlin. Pacthod directed 5,800 French National Guards and 16 guns in his own and Amey's divisions. On 15 March unit strengths were somewhat larger. In Mortier's corps, Christiani had 2,100 men, Curial 2,800, Charpentier 2,800, Roussel d'Hurbal 1,750 and François Grouvel 350 horsemen. In Marmont's corps, Ricard had 1,000 soldiers, Lagrange 2,100, Arrighi 2,100, Merlin 1,150 and Bordesoulle 1,250. Francis Loraine Petre estimated the strength of Marmont and Mortier as 19,000 troops and of Pacthod as 4,300 men. Digby Smith asserted that the French marshals had 17,000 infantry, 4,000 cavalry and 84 guns, while the Allies had 28,000 troops, mostly cavalry, and 80 guns. Smith credited Pacthod with a total of 3,700 infantry, 100 cavalry and 16 guns. Two of Pacthod's and one of Amey's battalions were line infantry, the rest of the foot soldiers were National Guards. David G. Chandler stated that Pacthod had 4,000 soldiers without giving Marmont and Mortier's strength. Spencer C. Tucker gave French strength as 5,000. Results Jean Compans Petre reckoned French losses as 10,000 men and over 60 guns and Allied losses as 2,000. Marmont and Mortier lost 2,000 killed and wounded with 4,000 soldiers, 45 guns and 100 ammunition wagons captured. Pacthod lost almost his entire force of 4,300 men, 16 guns and the convoy, with only a handful escaping into the Saint-Gond Marshes. Nafziger gauged losses as 9,000–11,000 French soldiers, including 5,000 killed and wounded, and 4,000 Allied casualties. The Allies claimed to have taken 80 cannons and 250 ammunition wagons. Smith stated that Pacthod lost 1,500 killed and wounded plus 1,900 soldiers, 100 ammunition wagons and 125 bread wagons captured. His National Guards fought like veterans. For Marmont's force, Smith quoted one source that estimated 5,000 killed and wounded plus 8,000 men, 46 guns and 20 ammunition wagons captured. A second source gave 1,500–3,000 killed and wounded, 3,000 captured and 2,000 deserted. Marmont and Mortier spent the night after the battle at Allemant, to the northeast of Sézanne. Hearing that Yorck sent a force under Hans Ernst Karl, Graf von Zieten toward Sézanne, Compans abandoned the town at midnight and marched to join the two marshals at Allemant. Two hours later Marmont and Mortier began moving toward Sézanne. The next morning they found Zieten in possession of the town, but their superior numbers persuaded the Prussian to withdraw after a skirmish that cost the French 200 casualties and their opponents 107. Leading the Coalition pursuit, the Crown Prince of Württemberg entered Sézanne three hours after the French left. On 26 March, Compans with 1,000 men marched west through La Ferté-Gaucher and reached Coulommiers after some clashes with a Prussian brigade led by Heinrich Wilhelm von Horn. At Coulommiers where he spent the night, Compans was joined by Vincent's observation force and fugitives from the battle, raising his force to 2,200 infantry and 250 cavalry. When Marmont and Mortier arrived at La Ferté-Gaucher, they found Prince Wilhelm of Prussia's brigade blocking them. Prince Wilhelm was gradually reinforced by elements of Kleist's corps and the Prussian artillery soon dominated the numerically weaker French guns. After unsuccessfully trying to push the Prussians out of the way and learning that Pahlen's cavalry corps was approaching from the east, the French marshals decided they could only escape the trap by marching south to Provins. Far to the east, Napoleon scored a pointless victory over Wintzingerode in the Battle of Saint-Dizier on 26 March. The next day, the French emperor finally realized that the Allies had called his bluff and were advancing on Paris. He ordered his troops to march toward the capital, but it was too late. Marmont and Mortier reached Provins on 27 March and turned toward Paris. That day Compans was in Meaux, reinforced to a strength of 3,800 foot soldiers and 850 horsemen. This was far too few men and by 28 March, the combined Allied armies bridged the Marne and captured Meaux. Compans was driven back along the direct road to Paris, where he arrived on 29 March and was joined Marmont and Mortier who came by the roundabout route through Provins. On 30 March, the French with 42,000 men, including only 23,000 veterans, faced Schwarzenberg and Blücher with 107,000 troops. After the Battle of Paris and the subsequent surrender of the capital, Napoleon's empire came to an end.

The result was a defeat for the patriot forces, weeks later the patriots take their rematch at the Battle of Maipú. Background In March 1818, the royalist forces concentrated and fortified in Talca with around five thousand men under Brigadier Mariano Osorio, while the independentist forces of around seven thousand men formed by the United Army were taking positions at the Cancha Rayada plains, about seven kilometers away. Argentine general José de San Martín, fearing an attack on his flank, ordered a change of position of the troops. La Guía 2000 Knowing their disadvantage in number and cavalry, the Spanish General Osorio was not eager to engage in battle either, remaining content with fortifying Talca. However, after a suggestion from Colonel José Ordóñez a confrontation was decided upon, under Ordoñez' command. The battle The Spanish attacked at 19:30, when the last thing the patriots expected was a battle. In a bold move, Ordoñez made the kind of attack San Martín had most feared: circumventing the city and making a surprise attack at night behind the vanguard where the patriot forces were still taking positions. The surprise attack happened before the patriot army had re- positioned itself, and was a directed at the battalion under General Bernardo O'Higgins command, near San Martín's position. Soon, the vanguard soldiers dispersed, leaving O'Higgins in a bad position; his horse was shot dead and he was wounded in one arm. In an uncharacteristic move, instead of ordering retreat San Martín held the position, which made more patriot soldiers flee under enemy fire, leaving their weapons and supplies behind. After the initial disorder, however, he ordered retreat. The rear and reserves had already re- positioned, somewhat withstanding the attack, but had no-one in command, since their chief, Colonel Hilarión de la Quintana, had left for headquarters to receive orders after the re-position and had not yet returned. Colonel Juan Gregorio de Las Heras took command, and led the men during the retreat, while trying to recover as much artillery and weapons as possible. San Martín and O'Higgins (who were also retreating at full speed) were being closely chased by royalist forces. Aftermath By March 21, the decimated patriot forces of around three and half thousand men reunited in San Fernando, while news of the defeat reached Santiago. Rumors of deaths of O'Higgins and San Martín were spreading, and an exodus from Santiago to Mendoza began. Regarding the battle, San Martín sent the following message: Camping the army under my command in the outskirts of Talca, it was attacked by the enemy, and suffered an almost generalized disbanding which forced me to retreat. I'm reuniting the troops right now, with happy results, as I'm already counting 4,000 men from Curicó to Pelequén. The battle (which was the only defeat the campaign had suffered) resulted in around 150 killed, and two hundred taken prisoner. Several hundred had deserted, the whole artillery of the Argentine side was lost along with considerable numbers of horses, mules, and weapons from both the Chilean and Argentine parts of the army. Despite the royalist victory, the action proved devastating to their side: two hundred soldiers had been killed, three hundred men captured and around six hundred had deserted, a total comprising more than half the two thousand men that had charged into the battle.

It is located on the Iller, approximately 18 km south of Ulm and 40 km north of Memmingen. It is in the Donau-Iller Region in Central Swabia (part of Upper Swabia). Neighbouring municipalities \\\\- Senden to the north \\\\- Weißenhorn to the east \\\\- Bellenberg to the south \\\\- Illerrieden, Baden-Württemberg, to the west History The settlement of Vöhringen may have developed by the 5th or 6th century, when the Alamanni migrating from the Danube settled the Swabian river valleys. Veringen, as it is called in several 12th-century documents, underwent several changes of overlordship in the 15th century and finally became Bavarian in 1756 under Elector Max Joseph of Bavaria, earlier than the neighbouring settlements. Vöhringen was decisively changed by industrialisation beginning in 1864, when factory owner Philipp Jakob Wieland bought the local mill, its attached workshop and the water power to run them. Wieland Works are now known worldwide and an important presence in the town. Vöhringen became a town on 25 June 1977. At that time it already included the settlements of Illerberg, Illerzell and Thal. =Incorporated former settlements= Illerzell The formerly independent settlement of Illerzell, with more than 1,300 inhabitants, is around 3 km northwest of Vöhringen on the floor of the Iller Valley.

Inside the cave bath The thermal water (temperature: 30°C/86°F) is reputed to reduce joint pain, and since it has a lower salt content than most thermal waters (around 1000 mg/liter), people can bathe in it for much longer, practically an unlimited amount of time. The Cave Bath can be visited all year long, except for January. Entrance to the cave bath The cave and the thermal spring have been known since ancient times, but Tapolca became a popular bathing place only after the Ottoman occupation of Hungary (16th-17th century). During this time the area belonged to the Greek Orthodox abbey of Görömböly; the development of Tapolca into a bathing place was the idea of the abbot in 1711. He also brought doctors from Kassa, today Košice, Slovakia to examine the beneficial effects of the water. Three pools and an inn were constructed in 1723. The cave itself was not used yet, as the pools were outside. The water was colder than it is now, because the cold water springs of Tapolca (which now play an important role in providing Miskolc with drinking water) were used too. By the mid-18th century, after a short period of popularity, the bath was neglected and by the 19th century the buildings were in ruins. In 1837, the new abbot of Görömböly had the buildings restored and expanded. He also had the first indoor pool (though still outside the cave) built, but only for wealthy guests. Inside the cave bath In the early 20th century, the growing city of Miskolc bought the area from the Greek Orthodox Church not only because of the thermal water but also because of the drinking water source (which now provides half of the city's water supply). In the following years, new public baths were built. In 1934, Tapolca was officially recognised as a spa town. In 1939, the construction of a new bathing house began. During the construction, several archaeological findings were unearthed, and a new, previously unknown water spring was found with a water temperature of 31.5°C. The thermal bath was opened in 1941 but the Cave Bath itself was opened only on 14 May 1959. Since then, the bath complex has been expanded several times. The outdoor pool and the characteristic, seashell-shaped roof before it were built in 1969. In the 1980s, new rooms and corridors were built, and warmer pools (34°C and 36°C) were constructed. The newest expansion of the bath complex started in 1998.

Rowan. Rowan was in the Atlantic when the United States entered World War II, and was one of the United States Navy ships joining the British Home Fleet for the battle of convoy PQ 17. Rowan later engaged French warships in the Naval Battle of Casablanca while supporting Operation Torch. Rowan then defended convoy UGS 6 before supporting the invasion of Sicily. Rowan was sunk by E-boats off Salerno during the allied invasion of Italy. History Rowan was laid down on 25 June 1937 by the Norfolk Navy Yard, Portsmouth, Virginia; launched 5 May 1938; sponsored by Miss Elizabeth H. Rowan, great granddaughter of Vice Admiral Rowan; and commissioned 23 September 1939, Lieutenant Commander B. R. Harrison, Jr., in command. After shakedown in the Caribbean, Rowan departed Norfolk on 17 May 1940 for duty in the Pacific, based at San Diego, California. During the spring of 1941, however, U.S. involvement in the war in Europe increased. In May the limits of the Neutrality Patrol were extended and the Navy gradually expanded its responsibilities for protecting transatlantic convoys. At the end of the month, Rowan was transferred to the Atlantic and assigned to the Neutrality Patrol. Through the spring and summer, she ranged from Newfoundland to the Caribbean. Then, in early November, she was ordered to escort Convoy WS-12X, carrying British reinforcements for the Near and Far East, from Halifax, Nova Scotia to Cape Town. Sailing from Halifax on 10 November, she reached Cape Town on 9 December, 2 days after the United States entered World War II. In January 1942, she returned to the east coast of the United States and resumed convoy duty in the North Atlantic and the Caribbean. On 30 April she sailed east from Halifax to escort another convoy to the mid-ocean rendezvous point. Upon departing the convoy on 10 May, she proceeded to Hvalfjorður, Iceland, and on the 11th joined TF 99, which was acting as a part of the British Home Fleet based at Hvalfjordur and Scapa Flow. At mid-month, she completed a \\"north about circuit\\" to Seyðisfjörður, whence she patrolled, with TF 99, 150 miles east of the routes of convoys PQ-16 and QP-12 to intercept any German units which might sortie from Norway to destroy the convoys. The first convoy was bound for the north of Russia, the second on return from there. On the 29th, TF 99 put into Scapa Flow and on 12 June got underway to return to Iceland and repeat its previous mission for convoys PQ 17 and QP-13. The latter had lost four merchantmen on its northward run and would lose, on its return, five more before reaching Reykjavík. Berlin had ordered the former, comprising 33 merchantmen, annihilated by a combined air-surface-submarine operation, \\"Rösselsprung\\". PQ 17 departed Iceland on 27 June. Two days later the cruiser covering force, to which Rowan was attached, moved around to Seyðisfjörður, whence they sortied on 1 July. On 2 July, Rowan was detached and assigned to PQ 17. That convoy, shadowed by German reconnaissance planes despite heavy fog, had already lost two freighters; one grounded, the other damaged by ice and ordered back. As Rowan approached the convoy, the Luftwaffe moved in. Rowan, along with HMS Fury and the rescue ship Zafaraan, claimed credit for shooting down one of the attackers. p.69 No ships were lost. On the 3rd, the weather protected the convoy from a bomber attack. Early on the 4th, however, the enemy planes began to penetrate through the fog. A Liberty ship went down shortly after 0300. The raids continued. By late afternoon four more ships had been hit, two of which sank. Shortly thereafter, the convoy was ordered scattered and the escorts sent to support the cruisers in an anticipated engagement with German heavy units which were rumored to have left the fjords of Norway. The merchantmen of PQ 17 steamed north, independently. Eleven ships got through to Russia. Rowan, ordered to rejoin the cruisers on the 4th, returned to Iceland with that force on the 7th. On the 13th, her division DesDiv 16, was relieved and on the 14th she headed back to the United States. Overhaul at Boston, Massachusetts followed and in mid- August she resumed convoy escort duty with a run to Panama. In September, she trained and conducted patrols out of Norfolk, Virginia, and Portland, Maine; then, in October joined TF 34 for Operation Torch, the invasion of North Africa. On 7 November, she arrived off Fedhala with the assault force. Through the 9th she screened the transports. On the 10th, she patrolled off Casablanca and participated in action against Vichy ships attempting to turn back the invasion. On the 11th, she resumed screening in the transport area, and on the 12th she got underway to return to the United States. Between December 1942 and April 1943, Rowan escorted two reinforcement and resupply convoys to Casablanca. On the second trip out, UGS-6, five merchantmen were lost to a \\"wolfpack\\" in 4 days, 13 to 17 March. On March 16 she scuttled the Benjamin Harrison at 21:30, with gunfire. In May the destroyer completed her last transatlantic run. At the end of the month she joined TF 80 at Mers-el-Kebir, Algeria, and for the next month conducted ASW patrols and escorted convoys along the North African coast. On 10 July, the invasion of Sicily began. On the 14th Rowan arrived off the coast in the screen of a reinforcement convoy and commenced patrols off Gela. After the 20th, she shifted around to the northern shore and assumed patrol and escort work in the Palermo area. On the 26th she added shore bombardment, against enemy positions between Cefalù and Stefano di Camastra, and into August she supported the \\"leap frog\\" landings along the coast. She then returned to North Africa to prepare for the landings on the Italian mainland at Salerno. Fate On 9 September, Rowan entered the Gulf of Salerno in the screen of the Southern Attack Force. That day and the next as the assault force and supplies were landed at Paestum, she screened the transports and freighters. Late on the night of the 10th, she headed back to Oran with the emptied ships. Shortly after midnight, German E-boats attacked. Rowan pursued and fired, then, as her quarry pulled away, ceased firing and changed course to rejoin the convoy. Within 5 minutes a new contact was made, range less than 3,000 yards. Again she changed course, to avoid torpedoes and bring her guns into position. As the range decreased to 2,000 yards, Rowan was hit by a torpedo by a German E-boat. She sank in less than a minute, taking 202 of her 273 officers and men with her. Those whose bodies were not recovered, were listed as ‘missing in action’ for a year and a day after the sinking. They were considered officially ‘dead’ on 12 September 1944. Honors Rowan earned five battle stars during World War II.

The County of Roussillon (, , ) was one of the Catalan counties in the Marca Hispanica during the Middle Ages. The rulers of the county were the counts of Roussillon, whose interests lay both north and south of the Pyrenees. Visigothic county There was a Visigothic county around the city of Ruscino in the 6th and 7th centuries with a jurisdiction corresponding to the Diocese of Elna. This primitive county comprising the historic comarques of Plana del Roselló, Conflent, and Vallespir was created by Liuva I in 571. The Visigothic legacy in Roussillon survived in its courts, where Visigothic law was applied exclusively as late as the 11th century.Lewis, 124-126. Roussillon was occupied by the Moors in 721. It was probably conquered for the Frankish Empire by Pepin the Short and his Visigothic allies in 760, immediately following his conquest of Narbonne, though all that is certain is that it was in Frankish hands during the reign of Charlemagne.Lewis, 25. Roussillon had been nearly completely depopulated, was not widely cultivated, and land use was very inefficient, which has often been explained by Moorish razzias and Frankish reprisals over a span of forty years.Lewis, 18. Pepin reestablished the old Gothic county with its seat at Ruscino. The new count--a Goth--built a castle at their capital: the castrum or castellum Rossilio, by which Ruscino came to be known as Castell-Rosselló. Beginning in 780, Charlemagne started granting aprisiones of unpopulated land in Roussillon and around Narbonne to incoming spani (or hispani, that is, Christian Spaniards of Gothic, Roman, and Basque origin).Lewis, 39-40. These spani migrants, along with the native Gothic aristocracy, took part in the reconquest of the southern slopes of the Pyrenees and the Tarraconensian littoral which formed the new Marca Hispanica.Lewis, 39-40. Union with Empúries The history of the Frankish county in the 8th and 9th centuries is not well known. In the Carolingian age, it may have formed the westernmost extent of non-Basque settlement in the Pyrenees.Lewis, 5. It was affected by the second wave of monasticism which swept Catalonia in the first half of the 9th century and saw the foundation and imperial recognition of new monasteries, as at Saint-Genesius des Fonts, Saint-Clement de Regulla, and Saint-André de Sureda in 819 and 823 respectively.Lewis, 48, 82. In 859-860, a fleet of Vikings under Hasting and Bjorn plundered the abbeys of Roussillon before wintering in the Camargue.Lewis, 102. The first count known by name, Gaucelm, received the County of Empúries in 817 and those counties remained united until 989. They probably had separate viscounts, however; the office of viscount appeared in Roussillon early when a Richelm is mentioned as filling it in 859.Lewis, 115. The original viscounts acted as missi dominici of the margraves of Septimania.Lewis, 118. Throughout this period, Roussillon gradually gained de facto independence from its nominal suzerain, the king of France. As late as 878, Louis the Stammerer could enforce his will in the selection of Roussillon's count, but by the end of the 9th century the royal writ rarely ran as far south as the Pyrenees. The counties of Roussillon and Empúries became relatively stable, hereditary possessions of the Bellonid family; Gausfred I even took the title dux (duke) in 975.Lewis, 198, 208. Late in the 10th century, Alt Rosselló, Conflent, and inland Vallespir passed to the counts of Cerdanya and Roussillon was reduced to the coastal regions of Roussillon and Vallespir. Throughout the century, Empúries was the centre of comital power and the counts had their seat there. It was only when Viking and Moorish pirates forced him to move from the coast to the more easily defensible inland that Gausfred I made his capital at Castelló d'Empúries. After his death, the counties were separated, with Roussillon going to his younger son, Giselbert I. The division, however, was made under certain stipulations of the deceased count. First, both counts had a right to attend the synods and tribunals held in either county. Second, rights of justice were shared between the two counts. Third, the count of Roussillon had the right to make his residence in Empúries, the ancient capital. And finally, that either count could possess lands in either county. In 1014, Hugh I of Empúries invaded Roussillon, but in 1019 a pact was signed making the two counties permanently separate entities. Treuga Dei Roussillon was the site of the first promulgation of the Truce of God (treuga Dei). In 1027, a council of Elna was held in the meadow of Toulouges, because the throng of attendees was so great: clergymen, aristocrats, and poor men and women. The council first decreed a series of canons in keeping with the Peace of God (pax Dei) movement inaugurated at Charroux Abbey in 989 and which had spread across Aquitaine, Gascony, the Languedoc, and Catalonia like wildfire. The Elna council, however, went a step further than previous local councils. It also declared a truce effective from Saturday evening until Monday morning each week: \\"No one dwelling in the aforesaid county and diocese [of Roussillon] should assail any enemy of his from the ninth hour on Saturday to the first hour on Monday, so that everyone may render the honour owed to the Lord's day.\\"Jordan, 26. The truce spread rapidly through Languedoc and was soon extended so that it was generally understood that fighting was prohibited between Wednesday evening and dawn Monday. Independent Roussillon Giselbert moved the capital of Roussillon from Castellrosellón to a village named Perpignan, which was destined to be the first city of Roussillon, in preference to the episcopal seat of Elna. Giselbert II made a pact with Empúries concerning military and ecclesiastical possessions. During this period, Roussillon fell more under the influence of the count of Toulouse to its north than the count of Barcelona to its south, contrary to the path of most of the Catalan counties. It also suffered under a series of coastal raids by the navy of the taifa kingdom of Denia.Lewis, 288. In the mid-12th century, under Gausfred III, Roussillon experienced an epoch of turbulence with increased attacks from both Empúries and Moorish pirates. Gausfred's eldest son also rebelled. In order to quell his son's revolt, he made him Lord of Perpignan and heir apparent. On the death of Gerard II without heirs in 1172, Roussillon passed, as per prior agreement of the nobles with the count, to Alfonso II of Aragon. It was thought that the Crown of Aragon could protect Roussillon from the pretensions of Empúries, which still possessed certain communal rights in Roussillon. In 1173, Alfonso called an assembly at Perpignan, where he declared a peace for all Roussillon and the diocese of Elna. Roussillon in the Crown of Aragon Roussillon was, along with Cerdanya and Conflent, the subject of a major cartulary under Alfonso II or perhaps Peter II: the Liber feudorum Ceritaniae. It is a record of charters, usually related to castle- and land-holding in the three counties, from the archive of the counts of Barcelona.

The manuscript for the story was originally completed October 20, 1830. It was intended to be the last of The Tales of the Late Ivan Petrovich Belkin to be published, but Pushkin decided to push the story to the front of the volume. The novella, so comical and at the same time so dramatic, is considered to be one of the masterpieces of Russian literature. Debreczeny, Paul. The Other Pushkin: A Study of Alexander Pushkin's Prose Fiction. 1983. Portrait of Alexander Pushkin (Orest Kiprensky, 1827) Plot Illustration accompanying the French edition of the story, ca. 1843 The plot concerns the relationships of an aristocratic young woman named Maria Gavrilovna (Gavrilovna is a patronymic, not a surname) and the unusual coincidences that accompany them. The following is copied from the program notes by Ledbetter (see sources): :In 1811, a seventeen-year-old girl, Maria Gavrilovna, falls in love with a young officer, Vladimir Nikolayevich. Her parents disapprove of the relationship, which continues into the winter through correspondence. Finally they decide to elope, marry quickly, and then throw themselves at the feet of her parents to beg forgiveness (confident that a marriage entered into the Russian Orthodox Church would be regarded as eternal and unbreakable). :The plan was for Maria Gavrilovna to slip out in the middle of a winter's night and take a sleigh to a distant village church, where her love would meet her for the wedding. On the night in question, a blizzard was raging, but the girl managed to do all she had promised and to reach the church. Her lover, on the other hand, driving alone to the rendezvous, became lost in the dark and the storm, arriving at the church many hours late to find no one there. :The next morning, Masha was once more at home, but very ill. In a feverish delirium, she said enough to make it clear to her mother that she was hopelessly in love with the young officer. Her parents, deciding that this was a fated love, gave their permission for a wedding. But when they wrote to inform the officer of this fact, his reply was almost incoherent. He begged their forgiveness and insisted that his only hope was death. He rejoined the army (it was now the fatal year of 1812, when Napoleon made his famous attack on Russia), was wounded at the battle of Borodino, and died. :Meanwhile, Masha's father died, leaving her the richest young woman in her region. Suitors pressed for her hand, but she refused to accept anyone. She seemed to be living only for the memory of her lost love. :Finally, though, she made the acquaintance of a wounded colonel of the hussars, Burmin, who was visiting the estate near hers. Burmin was a handsome man who had once had a reputation as a notorious rake, but who was now both quiet and modest in his personality. The two developed a warm friendship, and it became very clear that he was so restrained that he never made any declaration of love or formal proposal to her. Masha purposely arranged a situation in which they would be able to talk freely with no one else near. Finally he breaks his silence: He loves her passionately but cannot hope for any happiness with her because he is already married, has been married for four years, to a woman whom he does not know and whom he cannot expect ever to see again. :To the astonished Masha, he explains that, in the winter of 1812, he was trying to rejoin his regiment, when a terrible blizzard came on. Riding in a troika with a guide, they became lost in unfamiliar country. Seeing a light in the distance, they drove toward it and found themselves at a village church where people were crying out \\"This way!\\" When he stopped at the church, he was told that the bride had fainted and that the priest did not know what to do. When they saw the young soldier, they asked him if he was ready to proceed. Burmin, the young rake, noticed the attractiveness of the bride and decided to play a prank by going through with the ceremony. The church was dark, lit only by a few candles, and everyone in it was little more than a shadow. When, at the end, he was told to kiss his bride, she realized that it was not her intended and fainted dead away. As the witnesses stared at him in horror, he raced out and drove off. :He explains to Masha that he was so thoroughly lost that he still does not know the name of the village where he was married, or who the bride might have been. As the tale ends, Maria Gavrilovna takes the hand of the man she has come to love and identifies herself as the long-lost bride.Ledbetter, Steven: Program Notes for concert by MIT Symphony Orchestra. 2005. Style Pushkin uses his story as a means of parody on the classical themes of gothic motivation featured in Lenore (ballad) and Vasily Zhukovsky's ballad, \\"Svetlana\\". In both of these ballads, the lover is only able to dream and 'imagine' life with their deceased lover. Pushkin plays on this idea by presenting the same situation for Marya; however, due to a case of most fortuitous and unforeseen circumstances Marya is actually married to her living lover. Pushkin imitates the style of these ballads, but creates it through a set of realistic circumstances.Bethea, David M., and Sergei Davydov. \\"Pushkin's Saturnine Cupid: The Poetics of Parody in the Tales of Belkin. 1981. Themes =Hero= In The Tales of the Late Ivan Petrovich Belkin, Pushkin uses a variety of stereotyped gentlemen suitors as the tales' Hero. Bumin acts as the hero in this short story. His wild and borderline criminal towards marrying an unknown bride in the church ultimately led him to marrying the woman of his dreams.Gregg, Richard. “A Scapegoat for All Seasons: The Unity and the Shape of the Tales of Belkin”. 1971. =Antihero= Vladimir is the story's counter or Antihero. Being a petty land owner, he is too poor to pursue Masha's hand in marriage openly. Vladimir's plans for marriage were brought to a halt by unfortunate circumstances (the blizzard, fatal injury during the war). However, the same unfortunate events are what grant Burmin the ability to lead a successful Courtship with Maria.Gregg, Richard. “A Scapegoat for All Seasons: The Unity and the Shape of the Tales of Belkin”. 1971. Structure Over seventy percent of the sentences within the story are considered to be a Simple sentence, which includes segments of simple sentences cut short by a Semicolon.Debreczeny, Paul. The Other Pushkin: A Study of Alexander Pushkin's Prose Fiction. 1983. The story's plot can be dissected into 13 unique parts:Ward, Dennis. “The Structure of Pushkin's 'tales of Belkin'”. 1955. #The two lovers are presented, along with their situation and plans to wed #Maria makes her preparations to leave and spend her last moments at home #Vladimir leaves and departs through the snowstorm to the church #Maria falls ill at her home and professes her love to her parents #Vladimir's refuses to enter Maria's home and enlists in the military #The state of Maria and Vladimir's injury and death from the Battle of Borodino #Death of Masha's father and her departure to a new estate #Describes Maria's faith to the memory of her dead lover #A degression to the current state of affairs in Russia #Burmin arrives and the feelings between Masha and Burmin is established #Burmin's declaration of love #Burmin's role in the events that occurred during the Blizzard when Masha and Vladimir were supposed to elope #Brief explanation of events Adaptations =Film= The story was made into a film by director Vladimir Basov.

The river is a County Biological Heritage Site. It rises on White Hill and flows for approximately 23 miles to the River Ribble, of which it is the largest tributary. The confluence of the rivers is an impressive sight, particularly when both are in spate. The Hodder drains much of the Forest of Bowland Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and all but the last mile of its course is through this scenic area. The upper reaches of the river feed the large Stocks Reservoir, which provides much of Lancashire's water supply. After exiting the reservoir, the Hodder continues in a general southward direction. It collects many tributaries from the valleys of Bowland and, lower down, parts of the Ribble Valley. Most notable among the feeders of the Hodder are Croasdale Brook, Easington Brook, the River Dunsop, Langden Brook and the River Loud. Much of the land in the Hodder Valley further to the north is owned by the Crown as Duke of Lancaster, whilst further down, farming land on the Stonyhurst Estate is owned by Stonyhurst College and the Jesuits. The river runs close to the College and passes adjacent to the former preparatory school, Hodder Place. The river lends its name to the pre-preparatory department at Stonyhurst, \\"Hodder House\\" and also years three to five known collectively as \\"Hodder Playroom\\". The River Hodder eventually joins the River Ribble near Great Mitton, close to the River Calder. The relief of the river starts over 400 m above sea level and within a distance of 15 km it drops to 99 m above sea level. The Lower Hodder marks the historical county boundary between Lancashire and the West Riding of Yorkshire. It formed an important early feature in the development of the ancient Lordship of Bowland. Etymology The name Hodder is likely derived from Brythonic. Its meaning is either \\"pleasant stream\\" or possibly \\"boundary\\" (Welsh yr odre), the latter suggesting that the Lancashire/Yorkshire border has its origins in the depths of antiquity. It is thought that Bowland takes its name from the Old Norse boga- meaning a bow in a river; the Hodder being characterised by the way it meanders and twists through the Bowland landscape. Diversion In geological history, the Hodder did not flow eastward around Longridge Fell to join the River Ribble, but instead ran westward along the Loud valley from Doeford Bridge to the Derby Arms north of Longridge (reversing its modern-day eastward flow), continuing south-westward through Halfpenny Lane on the west side of Longridge to join either Blundell Brook past Broughton church and Woodplumpton to join the River Wyre, or else Savick Brook through Fulwood to join the River Ribble.Freeman, T.W., Rodgers, H.B., and Kinvig, R.H., (1966), Lancashire, Cheshire and the Isle of Man, Thomas Nelson and Sons Ltd, London, p.13 Settlements The Hodder does not pass by any major towns, but the following villages are situated along the river: * Slaidburn * Newton * Dunsop Bridge * Whitewell * Hurst Green * Great Mitton The medieval silver Mitton Hoard was found near where this river joins the River Ribble in 2009.Coin hoard BM-193206, Finds.org.uk, Retrieved 16 September 2015 Tributaries Notable tributaries include River Loud, Trough Brook, and River Dunsop.

Musical training and career Norman Frauenheim attended the prestigious Shady Side Academy in Pittsburgh and Fordham University. He served briefly in the United States Navy in World War I. He studied music in Paris in the 1920s and subsequently studied with Ignacy Jan Paderewski. He was also a student for many years of Zygmunt Stojowski. Frauenheim made concert tours in France, Spain and Great Britain, including command performances for royalty. His American debut was in 1926 at Town Hall New York City. Across the next five years he performed often in several American cities.\\"Makes First Appearance at Washington Concert.\\" New York, New York: Jewish Daily Bulletin, March 2, 1934, p. 6. Early in his career he was a soloist with the National Symphony Orchestra under the direction of Antonia Brica, the first American female conductor. He was a close friend of Guiomar Novaes, the famous Brazilian pianist who also studied under Stojowski. From the decade of the late 1920s to late 1930s he lived and performed in New York City and Pittsburgh. He performed at Carnegie Hall in 1946. About 1940 Frauenheim moved to Washington, DC where he continued to perform until 1960. Washington newspapers reviewed his performances at the Phillips Collection Gallery, the Sulgrave Club, Dumbarton Oaks, the Friends House in Georgetown and other halls. He gave a series of classical music lecture-recitals in Washington, D.C. on radio station WMAL of NBC. He repeated the series in many places. Frauenheim taught privately in New York City and Pittsburgh and was a music professor (1926–1930) at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University). He was a well known piano teacher in the Washington metropolitan area for four decades and continued to teach until the year before his death when he relocated to the Pittsburgh area. In 1955 he married Enid Mitchell, reported to friends and relatives to be an English countess. They had no children. Unfortunately she died early in the marriage. He died at age 92 in Pittsburgh and was buried in the Roman Catholic Calvary Cemetery. In 2005 several of his students began the process of forming a Norman Frauenheim Students’ Society. A major area of sharing has been a compilation of Paderewski’s fingerings and personal editing as taught by Frauenheim. Also valued by students, friends and family was the eloquent and elegant recounting of his experiences with famous musicians, important persons and fascinating places and events. His collection of photographs, many with personal inscriptions, and other memorabilia completed these important histories. Frauenheim is included in the Ampico Player Piano Roll Catalog. He recorded Schubert’s Impromptu Op. 124, #1 in Ab in August 1930, catalogue #7070(3).

In the 10th century, the Counts of Barcelona became progressively independent, hereditary rulers in constant warfare with the Islamic Caliphate of Córdoba and its successor states. The counts, through marriage, alliances and treaties, acquired the other Catalan counties and extended their influence along Occitania. In 1164, the County of Barcelona entered a personal union with the Kingdom of Aragon. Thenceforward, the history of the county is subsumed within that of the Crown of Aragon, but the city of Barcelona remained preeminent within it. Within the Crown, the County of Barcelona and the other Catalan counties developed a common polity known as the Principality of Catalonia. Origins Its origins date back to the early 8th century, when Muslims took control of the northern territories of the Visigothic Kingdom in Hispania and modern-day northeastern Spain and southern France. After turning back deep Muslim incursions, the Frankish Empire under the Carolingian monarchs, created the Marches of Gothia and Hispania progressively. This was achieved by taking over the territories of Septimania that the Moors invaded in the 8th century and from these, those territories surrounding the Pyrenees and specially the northeast of the Iberian Peninsula. These eastern Iberian territories were repopulated with people from the March of Gothia. This resulted in the formation of an effective buffer zone between the Muslim Iberian peninsula and the Duchy of Aquitaine and Provence. Frankish rule The area was dominated by the Franks after the conquest of Girona (785) and especially when, in 801, the city of Barcelona was conquered by King Louis the Pious of Aquitaine, and was incorporated into the Frankish kingdom. The county of Barcelona was established there, reporting to the Frankish king. The first count of Barcelona was Bera (801–820).Enciclopedia de Historia de España, Vol. 4, pág. 123. Initially, authority for the county rested on the local aristocracy. However, the policies Bera adopted in an effort to maintain peace with Muslim ruled Al-Andalus, resulted in him being accused of treason before the king. After losing a duel, according to the Visigothic legislation, Bera was deposed and exiled, and the government of the county went to Frankish nobles,Josep Mª Salrach, Catalunya a la fi del primer mil·leni, Pagès Editors, Lérida, 2004, pág. 122. such as Rampon or Bernard of Septimania. However, the Visigothic nobility regained the king's confidence with the appointment of Sunifred I of Urgell-Cerdanya as count of Barcelona in 844. Autonomy and unification Nevertheless, the ties of the Catalan counties to the Frankish monarchy had weakened. Autonomy was strengthened when the county families began to affirm their inheritance rights. This move was accompanied by a unification process among counties to form larger political entities. Count Wilfred the Hairy, son of Sunifred and the last count appointed by the Frankish king, oversaw this movement. He united a number of counties under his command and passed them on as an inheritance to his children. Wilfred later died at the hands of Muslims. Although he divided his counties among his children, the core formed by the counties of Barcelona, Girona and Osona remained undivided (although some historians, such as Ramon Martí, question whether Girona was kept initially under the domain of the children of Wilfred, and suggests that the County of Empúries dominated the county until the year of 908).Salrach, op.cit., pág. 136. Independence During the 10th century, the counts of Barcelona strengthened their political authority and further distanced themselves from Frankish influence. In 985 Barcelona, then ruled by Borrell II, was attacked and burned by Muslims, led by Almanzor. The count took refuge in the Montserrat mountains, awaiting help from the Frankish king, which never arrived, resulting in resentment. In 988, the reign of the Carolingian dynasty ended and was replaced by the Capetian dynasty. Borrell II was required to swear allegiance to the new Frankish king, but there is no evidence that the count acceded to the call, as the Frankish king had to go north to resolve a conflict. This has been interpreted as the starting point of effective independence of the county. The relinquishment of any possible French claim of feudal overlordship was obtained by James I in the Treaty of Corbeil (1258). Subsequently, the County of Barcelona grew in importance and expanded its territory with successive counts. It took over other Hispanic counties and expanded slowly towards the south as a result of battles against al-Andalus and the repopulation of areas such as Tarragona and the surrounding countryside. Borrell II's reign was followed by that of his grandson Ramon Berenguer I. His mother was the forceful Ermesinde of Carcassonne. Ramon Berenguer I reinforced the county's power by subjecting the rebellious Penedès nobles, partnering with the counts of Urgell and Pallars, acquiring the counties of Carcassonne and Rasez, charging pariahs from the Zaragoza and Lleida kingdoms, and renewing the legislative framework of the county to allow for the introduction of the Usages of Barcelona. These were a set of rules and customs that would increase in subsequent years. In his will he decided not to divide the territories again, but he transferred unified rule to his twin sons, Ramon Berenguer II and Berenguer Ramon II. After a crisis provoked by the murder of Ramon Berenguer II and accusations of fratricide against his brother, who died in the First Crusade, his son and heir, Ramon Berenguer III, was able to consolidate and expand the boundaries of the county. He conquered part of the County of Empúries and, leading a wide coalition, also attempted to conquer Mallorca, but had to abandon it because of the advance of the Almoravids troops on the peninsula. He also received, by inheritance, the Besalú and Cerdanya counties, gradually forming a territory very similar to what was once Old Catalonia. He also moved towards Lleida and repopulated border areas such as the city of Tarragona, effectively restoring it as the episcopal see. He also extended his trans-Pyrenean reign by incorporating Provence county through his marriage to Countess Dolça in 1112. Birth of the Crown of Aragon However another marriage, that of Ramon Berenguer IV of Barcelona and Petronilla of Aragon in 1137, resulted in a union of dynasties –the counts of Barcelona and the royal house of Aragon. Ramon Berenguer IV was, until his death, Count of Barcelona and Prince of Aragon. Their son, Alfonso II, was the first king of Aragon who, in turn was the Count of Barcelona, titles all the kings of the Crown of Aragon inherited from then on. Each territory that formed the union would maintain their traditions, laws, customs, currency and, in time, would develop state government institutions. From that point, along the next two centuries, the territory and institutional structure of the County of Barcelona became the basis of a new polity within the Crown of Aragon derived from the geographical context (Catalonia) and the traditional expression of the power of the counts (principality), the Principality of Catalonia. However, the title of count of Barcelona remained intact. During the 13th and 14th centuries, the county would still be ruled by the Kings of Aragon, but the death of Martí l'humà without descendants in 1410 ended the House of Barcelona and, as a result of the Caspe Compromise, county's ownership passed to the Trastámara dynasty, native of Castile, in the person of Ferdinand I. Later, when his grandson Ferdinand II of Aragon married Isabella of Castile and was crowned king, the dynastic union between the crowns of Castile and Aragon would involve the progressive inclusion of the county as one of the different Iberian territories ruled by the Habsburgs. Abandonment of Countship Despite the uniting of the county to the Spanish monarchy, the Barcelona County law itself remained in force until it was abolished in 1716 with the Nueva Planta Decrees after the Spanish War of Succession. Since then the county stopped being a political entity and the policy arena of the current Catalonia would only be defined as such by the Statutes of Autonomy of 1932, 1979 and 2006. Moreover, the title of Count of Barcelona is now merged with the Spanish crown. Juan Carlos I granted it to his father Juan de Borbón, reverting, on his death, to the titles of the Spanish Crown as a royal title.

He is best known for the Forbes MacKenzie Act, legislation passed in 1853 to regulate public houses in Scotland. Life Born in Exmouth, Devon, he was the third son of Colin MacKenzie, writer to the signet in Edinburgh and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Sir William Forbes of Pitsligo. He studied for the law, and was called to the bar in 1827. In 1830, he married Helen Anne Montgomery, daughter of Sir James Montgomery, and they had two children. In 1831, he was appointed a deputy lieutenant of Peeblesshire. At the 1837 general election he was elected to the House of Commons as member of parliament for Peeblesshire. He was re- elected as member for the constituency in 1841 and 1847. He was one of Sir Robert Peel's junior Lords of the Treasury from 26 April 1845 until the end of the latter's second premiership. He was an advocate of Catholic and Jewish emancipation and supported the administration's increase of the grant to Maynooth College. However, in May 1845, he threatened to resign from office as he felt that the Jewish Disabilities Reform Bill did not carry reforms far enough. He finally resigned from the government on 11 April 1846 over the Corn Laws, an issue which quickly led to the collapse of the administration. In 1852, he was elected one of two Conservative members of parliament for Liverpool. He served as Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury in Lord Derby's protectionist government from February 1852 to January 1853. In April 1853, he introduced the Public Houses (Scotland) Bill to the Commons. The Bill, which was eventually enacted as the Licensing (Scotland) Act 1853 (16 & 17 Vict. c.67), forced the closure of pubs in Scotland on Sundays and at 10pm on weekdays. Because of his active involvement in promoting it, the legislation was popularly known as the \\"Forbes Mackenzie Act\\". In the meantime, he had been forced out of parliament. The two defeated Liberal candidates at Liverpool had issued an election petition contesting the results. In the ensuing court proceedings the Conservative election agents were found to have been guilty of bribery and treating. On 21 June 1853 the election was declared void. Forbes MacKenzie made an attempt to re-enter parliament at Derby in 1857, but failed to be elected. In 1859 he was made chairman of the Commissioners in Lunacy for Scotland. He died suddenly in September 1862, aged 55, while visiting Sir Charles Tennant at Glen House, Innerleithen, Peeblesshire.

Steber is noted as one of the first major opera stars to have achieved the highest success with training and a career based in the United States. Biography Eleanor Steber was born in Wheeling, West Virginia on July 17, 1914. She was the daughter of William Charles Steber, Sr. (1888–1966) and Ida Amelia (née Nolte) Steber (1885–1985). She had two younger siblings – William Charles Steber, Jr. (1917–2002) and Lucile Steber Leslie (1918–1999). She made her debut at the Metropolitan Opera in 1940 and was one of its leading artists through 1961. She was known for her large, flexible silvery voice, particularly in the high-lying soprano roles of Richard Strauss. She was equally well known for her lyrical portrayals of Mozart's heroines, many in collaboration with conductor Bruno Walter. Beyond Mozart and Strauss her repertoire was quite varied. She was noted for success in the music of Wagner, Alban Berg, Giacomo Puccini and also in French opera. Steber sang the lead in the world premiere of the American opera Vanessa by Samuel Barber. She was also featured in a number of Metropolitan Opera premieres, including Strauss's Arabella, Mozart's Die Entführung aus dem Serail, and Berg's Wozzeck. Outside the Metropolitan her career included a 1953 engagement at the Bayreuth Wagner Festival, where her performance as Elsa in Lohengrin was highly acclaimed and recorded by Decca Records. She sang with Arturo Toscanini in his 1944 NBC Symphony broadcast of Beethoven's Fidelio. In 1954 at the Florence May Festival she sang a celebrated performance of Minnie in Puccini's La fanciulla del West with conductor Dimitri Mitropoulos. With Serge Koussevitzky and the Boston Symphony Orchestra she sang the world premiere in 1948 of Samuel Barber's Knoxville: Summer of 1915, a work which she commissioned. Beyond the opera, Steber was popular with radio and television audiences in frequent appearances on The Voice of Firestone, The Bell Telephone Hour and other programs. Her extensive recording output included many popular ballads and operetta tunes in addition to arias, art songs and complete operas. In 1973 she recorded a live album of arias and songs for RCA Red Seal at the Continental Baths in New York City where a young Bette Midler was then a regular performer. At the same time she was still heard in recital at Carnegie Hall and sang a noted late-career performance of Strauss's Four Last Songs with James Levine and the Cleveland Orchestra. While she was known as an artist of the highest standards, some critics observed that her reportedly tempestuous personal life eventually took a toll on her voice. In a well-known story, following a brilliant success in 1946 as the Countess in Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro at the Edinburgh Festival, HMV Records engaged her to record some Mozart and other popular arias. By the account of Walter Susskind, the conductor of both the Edinburgh performances and the proposed recordings, she arrived at the Abbey Road Studios not feeling well, having been up most of the night. She could not sing her standard arias, saying \\"I don't feel like singing that.\\" Susskind, trying to save the recording session, asked, \\"What do you feel like singing?\\". Steber thought for a moment and said, \\"Let's try 'Depuis le jour'\\" (from Louise). Orchestra parts were found and the disc was cut in one take. It became a famous recording of the aria, revealing a superb lyrical vocal line and an eloquent interpretation. Upon retiring from singing, she taught on the faculty of the Cleveland Institute of Music and the Juilliard School and maintained a private voice studio. She established the Eleanor Steber Vocal Foundation with an annual contest to assist young singers in launching their careers. Her many recordings are still available, as are audio and visual tapes of her radio and television broadcasts for The Voice of Firestone. Her papers are held by Houghton Library at Harvard University. Personal life Steber struggled at times with asthma and alcoholism.Steber profile, cantabile-subito.de; accessed July 18, 2015. She was married twice. Her first husband was pianist Edwin Lee Bilby. Her second husband was Colonel Gordon Andrews, whom she married in 1958, at the time she created the role of Vanessa at the Metropolitan Opera. Andrews managed her career and started the STAND record company, a joint venture that produced numerous recordings of Steber's performances. They were married for nine years. She had three stepchildren: Marsha Andrews, an opera singer who studied with her at the Cleveland Institute of Music and in New York and who also sang at the Metropolitan Opera for 12 seasons; Gordon Andrews Jr., retiree from GM, now deceased; and Michelle Andrews Oesterle, a choral conductor, singer and founder of the very successful Manhattan Girls Chorus. Death She died on October 3, 1990, in Langhorne, Pennsylvania, following heart valve surgery and is interred at Greenwood Cemetery, Wheeling, West Virginia.

It was played in New Zealand from 3 to 10 December 2005. New Zealand had come off a 4–0 loss in South Africa two months before, but in August they had defeated India to win the Videocon Tri-Series. Australia's most recent result against a regular national team was a tie in the final of the NatWest Series with England. From the last series, Jason Gillespie, Matthew Hayden and Darren Lehmann had been dropped by Australia, while Damien Martyn was out with injury and Glenn McGrath was rested. New Zealand's changes had mainly been through injuries, as Stephen Fleming had undergone surgery on a tumour and was replaced as captain by Daniel Vettori. Mathew Sinclair was also left out, for Craig McMillan, while Chris Harris had been replaced by James Franklin. ODI series =1st ODI= The series began at Eden Park in Auckland on 3 December. Australia won the toss and chose to bat first, and made eight for 252 after Ricky Ponting and Simon Katich hit half-centuries, sharing a stand of 118. Makeshift captain Daniel Vettori took two wickets as Australia lost three men for 27, including ODI debutant Brad Hodge for 13, before a stand of 59 between Andrew Symonds and Michael Clarke took Australia past the 200 mark. Four wickets fell in the last eight overs, but Australia still batted out 50 overs to make eight for 252. As mentioned, Glenn McGrath was rested, but the replacement Stuart Clark performed sufficiently, taking three wickets in his seven overs as New Zealand lost eight batsmen in single figures. Clark, who played in his second one-day international for Australia, was not named Man of the Match, however – that honour fell to Brett Lee, who bowled four maidens with the new ball, taking three wickets for five runs including both the Marshall twins, Hamish and James, and ending with the bowling analysis of 6–4–5–3. With Nathan Bracken, the replacement for Gillespie, taking two wickets as well, New Zealand finished on a total of 105, though after 12.3 overs they had been at 6 for 33. Jacob Oram put on 41 with Chris Cairns before Oram was bowled by Clark, and seven overs later the innings was over as Clark got another wicket and Andrew Symonds got the numbers 10 and 11. =2nd ODI= The second match was played at Westpac Stadium in Wellington on 7 December. This match saw an Australian record partnership between Michael Clarke and Andrew Symonds, who added 220 for the fifth wicket, Symonds hitting eight sixes and twelve fours on his way to a record score in ODIs between the two sides. His 156 was the third-highest by an Australian against any opponent, and the stand with Clarke paved the way for a total of 322 for 5. New Zealand had Lou Vincent hit 71 off 49 balls before he was first out, on 93 for 1, but rookie bowlers Mick Lewis and Stuart Clark (with four ODIs between them) shared four wickets, and New Zealand needed 53 from 33 balls when Jacob Oram cut a bouncer to Clark for 41. Brendon McCullum added 24 with substitute James Marshall, before the latter was run out, and New Zealand still needed 24 off the final two overs. The penultimate over yielded 18 runs as Brett Lee bowled a no-ball and a wide, and another ball was adjudged a no ball as Australia had too few players inside the circle. Lewis was left to bowl the last over, and with six runs required the last two batsmen were run out, leaving New Zealand on 320 – two runs short of victory. Australia thus clinched the Chappell–Hadlee Trophy with a match to spare. =3rd ODI= The last match was played at Jade Stadium in Christchurch on 10 December. It was a dead rubber as Australia had already won the Trophy. Mitchell Johnson was given his debut as Super Sub, coming in after Australia had batted to seven for 331 with four half-centuries. Johnson bowled nine overs for 64, without taking a wicket, and Scott Styris hit a hundred as New Zealand chased down the target for the highest successful run chase in ODI cricket thus far. This was also New Zealand's first win in their last eight one-day internationals.

For three centuries Limmen did not develop or grow, despite some efforts made to make the town more attractive. Around the year 1850 Limmen had only 450 inhabitants left. Limmen was made more accessible in the late 19th century as an effect of the growing Dutch infrastructure, making Limmen a growing town. More work was created, especially by growing bulbs, which made Limmen the so-called \\"bollencentrum\\" (bulb-centre) of the northern part of Holland. Flowerdays The annual \\"Bloemendagen\\" (Flowerdays) are a tradition in Limmen in the month of May. People living there make mosaics with the flowers of the Hyacinthus orientalis and set up the mosaics in front of their house. People from around the Netherlands come to visit Limmen these days.

It is a ferrimagnetic material with a Curie temperature of 560 K. YIG may also be known as yttrium ferrite garnet, or as iron yttrium oxide or yttrium iron oxide, the latter two names usually associated with powdered forms. In YIG, the five iron(III) ions occupy two octahedral and three tetrahedral sites, with the yttrium(III) ions coordinated by eight oxygen ions in an irregular cube. The iron ions in the two coordination sites exhibit different spins, resulting in magnetic behavior. By substituting specific sites with rare earth elements, for example, interesting magnetic properties can be obtained. YIG has a high Verdet constant which results in the Faraday effect, high Q factor in microwave frequencies, low absorption of infrared wavelengths down to 1200 nm, and very small linewidth in electron spin resonance. These properties make it useful for MOI (magneto optical imaging) applications in superconductors. YIG is used in microwave, acoustic, optical, and magneto-optical applications, e.g. microwave YIG filters, or acoustic transmitters and transducers. It is transparent for light wavelengths over 600 nm.

Biography Gwenc’hlan was born in Brittany, France. His father was Maurice Le Scouëzec, a painter. Gwenc’hlan spent most of his childhood in Madagascar, Paris, Landivisiau and Douarnenez, before doing his secondary studies in Saint-Vincent de Pont-Croix, Saint-Yves de Quimper and Saint-Grégoire de Tours, in 1942. There, he took part in the Breton Scouts movement Bleimor. He pursued higher studies in history at La Sorbonne in Paris. He did military service between 1951 and 1953 in the French Foreign Legion at Sidi-bel-Abbès and Daya in Algeria. He was a teacher of French in Crete and Athens from 1953 until 1957, when he was recalled to the French Foreign Legion at the 5th Foreign Regiment. After his military service ended in 1958, he became a professor at the French Institute of Athens, as well as in Saint-Didier-en-Velay in Versailles. As of 1960, he started to study medicine, and completed this with distinction in the Faculty of Medicine of Paris. He worked as a doctor at Quimper from 1969 until 1985. He also initiated Skoazell Vreizh, the Breton emergency service, together with Xavier Grall and Yann Choucq in the 1970s. He was a participant of the \\"Colloque Bretagne\\" in 1973. He wrote the preface in Morvan Lebesque's book Comment peut-on être Breton? (Can we be Breton?). In 1985, he founded the publishing business Beltan. He promoted the work of his father, the painter Maurice Le Scouëzec. Neo-Druidism He became Deputy Grand Druid within the\\"Poellgor\\" (executive committee of the Gorsedd) on 1 April 1979, then he became the Grand Druid of Brittany, succeeding Per Loisel, on 1 November 1980. The association Goursez Vreizh (Gorsedd of Brittany), also known as \\"Breudeuriezh Drouized, Barzhed hag Ovizion Breizh\\" in Breton or \\"Fraternité des druides, bardes et ovates de Bretagne\\" in French (Fraternity of the Druids, Bards and Ovates of Brittany), represents neo-druidism most regularly. Gwenc’hlan is the fifth Grand Druid of our time, according to the Gorsedd de Bretagne. In November 1993 he united a group of Freemasons, forming \\"loge maçonnique de la pierre pour ensuite y instaurer le rite maçonnique forestier\\" (a freemason lodge of the stone, to preserve the masonic forest rites).

Its original name was Krasnoye Znamya Stadium, before it was attached to Minsk Tractor Works and renamed to Traktor Stadium in 1976. During Soviet years the stadium was a home ground for Traktor Minsk in Belarusian SSR league as well as Dinamo Minsk reserves in the Soviet Reserves league. In 1976, the stadium was renovated. During 1978–1980, it became a temporary home stadium for Dinamo Minsk senior team, while Dinamo Stadium was closed for renovation in preparation for the 1980 Summer Olympics football tournament. In the 1990s, the stadium served as a home for several clubs, including Dinamo-93 Minsk, Ataka Minsk, as well as Dinamo Minsk in 1997 (while Dinamo Stadium was reserved only for international matches due to pitch condition). Second reconstruction started in 1997 and included installation of the fence and plastic seats. In 2000s the stadium was shared between MTZ-RIPO Minsk and Zvezda-BGU Minsk. Traktor Stadium hosted a 2002 Belarusian Premier League decider match and in 2010–11 Belarusian Cup final. In the late 2000s, MTZ-RIPO Minsk then-owner Vladimir Romanov proposed a major renovation of the stadium and surrounding area, including building of a new modern stadium and an entertainment center,New sports and entertainment center at the Traktor Stadium site? but the plan fell through after businessman's fall out with the club. Since 2013, the stadium has been serving as a home for Dinamo Minsk once again, while their other ground Dinamo-Yuni Stadium is on a long term renovation.

It was developed in 1986 by Thomas Ho and Sang Bin Lee. Under this model, the short rate follows a normal process: :dr_t = \\\\theta_t\\\\, dt + \\\\sigma\\\\, dW_t The model can be calibrated to market data by implying the form of \\\\theta_t from market prices, meaning that it can exactly return the price of bonds comprising the yield curve. This calibration, and subsequent valuation of bond options, swaptions and other interest rate derivatives, is typically performed via a binomial lattice based model. Closed form valuations of bonds, and \\"Black-like\\" bond option formulae are also available.Graeme West, (2010). Interest Rate Derivatives , Financial Modelling Agency. As the model generates a symmetric (\\"bell shaped\\") distribution of rates in the future, negative rates are possible. Further, it does not incorporate mean reversion. For both of these reasons, models such as Black–Derman–Toy (lognormal and mean reverting) and Hull–White (mean reverting with lognormal variant available) are often preferred.Pietro Veronesi (2010). Fixed Income Securities: Valuation, Risk, and Risk Management. Wiley. The Kalotay–Williams–Fabozzi model is a lognormal analogue to the Ho–Lee model, although is less widely used than the latter two.

The goal is to break down a large loop body into smaller ones to achieve better utilization of locality of reference. This optimization is most efficient in multi-core processors that can split a task into multiple tasks for each processor. Conversely, loop fusion (or loop jamming) is a compiler optimization and loop transformation which replaces multiple loops with a single one. It is possible when two loops iterate over the same range and do not reference each other's data. Loop fusion does not always improve run-time speed. On some architectures, two loops may actually perform better than one loop because, for example, there is increased data locality within each loop.

He can be seen in music videos by Janet Jackson and Prince, but he is known for his association with Morris Day and The Time. Benton is the brother of Time bassist Terry Lewis and worked closely with the band behind the scenes in its initial stages. During one performance, lead singer Morris Day asked for someone to bring him a mirror. Benton responded by ripping a mirror out of the club's restroom and bringing it on stage for Day to comb his hair. This act elevated Benton's integration into the band as a comic foil to Day, along with his dancing and providing backing vocals. In 1983, when Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis missed a concert in San Antonio, Benton was tasked by Prince to pretend to fill in for Lewis on stage with his bass unplugged, while Prince provided the bass parts backstage. Jam and Lewis were eventually fired after the tour. Benton appeared in the 1984 film Purple RainJet Jan 27, 1986 with the rest of The Time and assumed the role of Morris Day's bodyguard and valet.New York Magazine Aug 13, 1984 He also appeared in Prince's second film Under the Cherry Moon, and in Prince's third film Graffiti Bridge. The chemistry between Day and Benton was well received. Although The Time soon dissolved after Day started pursuing a solo career, Prince retained Benton, as well as Jellybean Johnson and Paul Peterson for the short-lived project The Family. Benton reunited with The Family on December 13, 2003 for a single charity performance along with other acts formerly associated with Prince.

Definition The most general definition of a responsory is any psalm, canticle, or other sacred musical work sung responsorially, that is, with a cantor or small group singing verses while the whole choir or congregation respond with a refrain. However, this article focuses on those chants of the western Christian tradition that have traditionally been designated by the term responsory. In the Roman Rite and rites strongly influenced by it, such as the pre-reformation English rite and the monastic rite of the Rule of St. Benedict, these chants ordinarily follow readingsRule of Benedict, chapters 9, 11, 12, 13, 17, in Fry, Timothy, ed., The Rule of St. Benedict in English, Liturgical Press, Collegeville, Minnesota, 1982, pp. 39-45 at services of the Divine Office (also called the Liturgy of the Hours); however, they have also been used as processional chants. Structure and performance The responsory Domine ne in ira in square notation for the first Sunday after Epiphany, from the Liber Responsorialis juxta Ritum Monasticum, Solesmes, 1895, page 398. The third double bar indicates where the partial respond, Miserere mei Domine, quoniam infirmus sum, will be repeated after the singing of the verse. This responsory includes a half-doxology and a final repetition of the partial respond after it. A responsory has two parts: a respond (or refrain), and a verse. Methods of performance vary, but typically the respond will be begun by the cantor then taken up by the entire choir. The verse is then sung by a cantor or a small group; or the verse can be begun by the cantor and continued by the entire choir. The chant concludes with a repetition of all or part of the respond. Sometimes the second repetition of the respond is followed by a half-doxology, Gloria Patri et Filio et Spiritui Sancto, sung by the cantor, followed in turn by a third repetition of all or part of the respond. As an example, here is the responsory Aspiciebam,Antiphonale ad usum ecclesiae Sarum, politissimis imaginibus decoratum, London, 1519, temporale folios 10v-11r. The temporale is the first component of the 1519 Antiphonale. It is followed by the kalendar and the psalterium, in which the foliation starts over. The foliation starts over again for the common, and yet again for the sanctorale. which in the Sarum Rite (the medieval rite of Salisbury Cathedral in England) followed the second reading, which was from the first chapter of the Book of Isaiah, at the night office (Matins) on the first Sunday of Advent: Respond: (started by the cantor and continued by the whole choir) Aspiciebam in visu noctis, et ecce in nubibus caeli Filius hominis veniebat: et datum est ei regnum, et honor: * Et omnis populus, tribus, et linguae servient ei. (I saw in a night-vision, and behold, the Son of Man was coming on the clouds of heaven: and sovereignty and honor were given him: and every people and tribe, and all languages shall serve him.) Verse: (sung by the cantor) Potestas eius, potestas aeterna, quae non auferetur: et regnum eius, quod non corrumpetur. (His might is an everlasting might which will not be taken away; and his reign is an everlasting reign, which shall not be broken.) Partial respond: (sung by the choir) Et omnis populus, tribus, et linguae servient ei. (And every people and tribe, and all languages shall serve him.) Most responsories have a single verse, but a few have multiple verses. One of the most famous of the latter is the responsory Aspiciens a longe, sung on the first Sunday of Advent after the first reading in the night office of the Latin secular (non-monastic) rite. The version that was sung in the medieval rite of Salisbury cathedral was worded as follows:Antiphonale ad usum ecclesiae Sarum, temporale folios 9v-10v. Respond: Aspiciens a longe et ecce video Dei potentiam venientem et nebulam totam terram tegentem. Ite obviam ei et dicite, Nuntia nobis si tu es ipse qui regnaturus es in populo Israel. (I look from afar, and behold I see the power of God coming, and a cloud covering the whole earth. Go out to meet him and say, tell us if you are the one who is to reign over the people of Israel.) 1st verse (sung by a boy) Quique terrigenae et filii hominum simul in unum dives et pauper (Whoever are earth- born, the sons of men, together in one rich and poor) Partial respond (sung by the choir) Ite obviam ei et dicite, Nuntia nobis si tu es ipse qui regnaturus es in populo Israel. (Go out to meet him and say, tell us if you are the one who is to reign over the people of Israel.) 2nd verse (sung by a boy) Qui regis Israel intende, qui deducis velut ovem Joseph (Hear, O shepherd of Israel, who leadest Joseph like a sheep) Partial respond (sung by the choir) Nuntia nobis si tu es ipse qui regnaturus es in populo Israel. (Tell us if you are the one who is to reign over the people of Israel.) 3rd verse (sung by a boy) Excita Domine potentiam tuam et veni ut salvos facias nos (Stir up your power O Lord and come that you may save us) Partial respond (sung by the choir) Qui regnaturus es in populo Israel. (O you who are to reign over the people of Israel.) Half-doxology (sung by all three boys) Gloria Patri et Filio et Spiritui Sancto (Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Ghost) Partial respond (sung by the choir) In populo Israel. (In the people of Israel.) The three boys then sang Aspiciens a longe whereupon the choir took up the full respond: et ecce video Dei potentian venientem et nebulam totam terram tegentem. Ite obviam ei et dicite, Nuntia nobis si tu es ipse qui regnaturus es in populo Israel. (I look from afar, and behold I see the power of God coming, and a cloud covering the whole earth. Go out to meet him and say, tell us if you are the one who is to reign over the people of Israel.) This responsory, Aspiciens a longe, has become familiar in the English-speaking world in an arrangement published in the second volume of Carols for Choirs edited by David Willcocks and John Rutter,Rutter, John, and Willcocks, David, eds., Carols for Choirs 2, Oxford, 1970, carol #15. where it is given the title \\"Matin Responsory\\", and is set to music adapted from a setting by Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina of the Nunc dimittis (free score of the Nunc dimittis here on CPDL) - and not of the Magnificat as stated by the editors. The structure of the Willcocks/Rutter arrangement, however, differs somewhat from what is shown above since it does not repeat the refrain after each verse in the traditional English way. For example, in the traditional English form (shown above) after the first verse, the choir sings all the words of the refrain from ite obviam ei to the end. In the Willcocks/Rutter arrangement, on the other hand, after the first verse the choir sings (in English translation) only the portion of the refrain corresponding to the Latin words ite obviam ei et dicite. Music Traditionally responsories are sung in Gregorian chant. The refrains are free compositions. The verses are ordinarily sung to standard tones, though there are exceptions to this.An example of a responsory with a non-standard verse tone is the first responsory for the feast of Corpus Christi in the monastic rite, Immolabit haedum. Apel, Gregorian Chant, p. 240; Liber Responsorialis pro Festis I Classis et Communi Sanctorum juxta Ritum Monasticum, Solesmes, 1895, pp. 122-123. Polyphonic settings of parts of responsories survive from the Middle Ages.Harrison, Music in Medieval Britain pp. 366-371. Marc-Antoine Charpentier composed 19 Repons (H 111 - 119, H 126 - 134 and H 144). Max Reger composed twenty Responsories for choir a cappella in 1911. The example of the Willcocks/Rutter setting of Aspiciens a longe shows that multi-voice settings of responsories have continued to be made in modern times also. =Responsories for Holy Week= Responsories for Holy Week set to music, for instance by Carlo Gesualdo (Op. 15) and by Jan Dismas Zelenka (ZWV 55): Maundy Thursday: # In monte Oliveti # Tristis est anima mea # Ecce, vidimus eum # Amicus meus # Judas mercator pessimus # Unus ex discipulis meis # Eram quasi agnus innocens # Una hora # Seniores populi Good Friday: # Omnes amici mei # Velum templi scissum est # Vinea mea electa # Tamquam ad latronem existis # Tenebrae factae sunt # Animam meam dilectam # Tradiderunt me # Jesus tradidit impius # Caligaverunt oculi mei Holy Saturday: # Sicut ovis # Jerusalem surge # Plange quasi virgo # Recessit pastor noster # O vos omnes # Ecce quo modo moritur justus # Astiterunt reges terras # Aestimatus sum # Sepulto Domino See also * Call and response (music) Notes References *Antiphonale ad usum ecclesiae Sarum, politissimis imaginibus decoratum, London, 1519. *Apel, Willi, Gregorian Chant, Indiana University Press, Bloomington, 1958. *Harrison, Frank Lloyd, Music in Medieval Britain, Routledge and Kegan Paul, London, 1958. *Liber Responsorialis pro Festis I Classis et Communi Sanctorum juxta Ritum Monasticum, Solesmes, 1895. *Music of the Sarum Office, web site at McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. *Temporale: Dominica Prima Adventus (PDF file). *\\"Responsorial Psalmody\\", in J.

Her towering coiffure and hourglass figure defined the Gibson Girl style. Early life Clifford was born on 29 June 1885 in Antwerp, Belgium, to Reynold Clifford and Matilda Ottersen. Camille was raised in Sweden, Norway and Boston. Career In the early 1900s, she won $2,000 in a magazine contest sponsored by illustrator Charles Dana Gibson to find a living version of his Gibson Girl drawings: his ideal woman. Clifford became an actress, performing in the United States from 1902 and in England from 1904. She returned from London to Boston on 3 July 1906. While only playing walk-on, non-speaking roles, Clifford became famous nonetheless: not for her talent, but for her beauty. Her trademark style was a long, elegant gown wrapped around her tightly corseted, eighteen-inch wasp waist. She retired from the stage upon her marriage in 1906. She made a brief return to the stage after the death of her first husband in 1914. Personal life In 1906, she was married to Captain the Hon. Henry Lyndhurst Bruce (1881–1914), the eldest son and heir apparent of Henry Bruce, 2nd Baron Aberdare. They had one child, Margaret, but the child died five days after birth. Her first husband was killed during the Great War in 1914 and his younger brother, Clarence, succeeded to the barony upon their father's death. In 1917, she married Captain John Meredyth Jones Evans. After the war she left the stage for good and later owned a stable of successful racehorses. Together, they were the parents of:Mosley, Charles, editor.

YIG filters are used for their high Q factors, typically between 100 and 200.YIG Tuned FiltersU.L. Rohde, and A.K. Poddar, \\"Cost-Effective, Power-Efficient and Configurable YIG Replacement Signal Source,\\" German Microwave Conference-GeMiC 2006, 28-30 March 2006, Germany. A sphere made from a single crystal of synthetic yttrium iron garnet acts as a resonator. These spheres are on the order of 0.5 mm in diameter and are manufactured from slightly larger cubes of diced material by tumbling, as is done in the manufacture of jewelry. The garnet is mounted on a ceramic rod, and a pair of small loops around the sphere couple fields into and out of the sphere; the loops are half-turns, positioned at right-angles to each other to prevent direct electromagnetic coupling between them and each is grounded at one end. The field from an electromagnet changes the resonance frequency of the sphere and hence the frequency it will allow to pass. The advantage of this type of filter is that the garnet can be tuned over a very wide frequency range by varying the strength of the magnetic field. Some filters can be tuned from 3 GHz up to 50 GHz. YIG filters usually consist of several coupled stages, each stage consisting of a sphere and a pair of loops. The input and output coils are oriented at right angles to one another around the YIG crystal. They are cross-coupled when energized by the ferrimagnetic resonance frequency, which depends on the external magnetic field supplied by an electromagnet. YIG filters are often used as preselectors. YIG filters tuned by a sweep current are used in spectrum analyzers. Another YIG application is YIG oscillators, where the sphere acts as a tunable frequency-determining element. It is coupled to an amplifier which provides the required feedback for oscillation.YIG Tuned Oscillators References Further reading * External links *Experimenting with a Stellex YIG Oscillator *A simple approach to YIG oscillators Category:Microwave technology Category:Filter theory Category:Wireless tuning and filtering Category:Iron(III) compounds ","title":"YIG sphere"},{"id":"3409902","text":"Venture Smith (Birth name: Broteer Furro) (c. 1729 – 1805) was captured when he was six and a half years old in West Africa and was taken to Anomabo on the Gold Coast (today Ghana) to be sold as a slave. As an adult in Rhode Island (Connecticut), he purchased his freedom and that of his family. He documented his life in A Narrative of the Life and Adventures of Venture, a Native of Africa: But Resident above Sixty Years in the United States of America, Related by Himself. This autobiography is one of the earliest known examples of an autobiographical narrative in an entirely African American literary vericas, only about a dozen left behind first-hand accounts of their experiences. Smith inherited the name \\"Venture\\" from Robinson Mumford, who was his first white enslaver. Mumford decided to call him \\"Venture\\" because he considered purchasing him to be a business venture. Mumford bought Venture with four gallons of rum and a piece of calico. After regaining his freedom, Smith adopted his last name from Oliver Smith (his last enslaver). In his narrative, Smith describes his people in his native country as having been generally of great bodily stature, stout and tall. And he reports that he personally was well over tall, weighed , and carried an axe for felling trees.

He is buried at the First Church of Christ cemetery in East Haddam, Connecticut, now a site on the Connecticut Freedom Trail.\\"Attractions\\", East Haddam, Connecticut. Smith's autobiographical narrative =Early life= Broteer (Venture Smith) was born in a place he recalls as Dukandarra in \\"Guinea\\"—a term that at the time referred to much of West Africa. Dukandarra, argues Chandler B. Saint, a historian with the Documenting Venture Smith Project, was probably in the Savannah region. Homann Heirs Map of \\"Guinea\\" His father was Saungm Furro, the prince of Dukandarra. His mother was the first of his three wives and Broteer was the first of her three children. She left Saungm Furro's village after he married another wife without her permission, although polygamy was not uncommon in that country, especially among the rich, as every man was allowed to keep as many wives as he could maintain. She took her three children with her. Traveling 140 miles over four days the group relied on foraging for food. The young Broteer was left in the care of a wealthy farmer while his mother her home country. While at this farm, Broteer was tasked with caring for the owner's flock of 40 sheep. He remained on the farm for about a year before his father sent an emissary to retrieve him. Six weeks after he returned to his father's village, Broteer learned that the country of the farmer he had just left had been invaded by a large, foreign army. The nation had not prepared for war in a long time; hence, the villagers had to evacuate. Saungm Furro agreed to give aid in the form of providing a safe haven. Shortly after refugees arrived, an enemy messenger arrived and demanded the payment \\"of a large sum of money, 300 fat cattle, and a great number of goats, sheep, asses, etc...\\" The threat of invasion and war was enough for Saugm Furro to agree to the terms. Fort William - the 1890s Despite paying the enemy what they had asked for, Saungm Furro's village was attacked by a force of 6,000 men. Broteer, his family, and the entire village fled. On the way, Saungm Furro discovered a scouting party of the enemy and he discharged arrows at them. They were all soon captured. Saungm Furro was interrogated because the invaders knew that he had money. He was tortured to death for refusing to reveal the location of his money. This event stuck with Broteer for the rest of his life, \\"the shocking scene is to this day fresh in my mind, and I have often been overcome while thinking on it.\\" The invaders forced the captives to march about 1,000 miles to Malagasco and the coast while at the same time the raiding force captured more Africans. In a turn of events, the captors are attacked and defeated by a local raiding party. Instead of being set free, he remained in bondage and continued his journey toward the coast and eventually arrived at the British slave-trading castle and dungeon of Anamabo (a.k.a. Fort William) on the Gold Coast (today's Ghana). In the late spring of 1739, the ship sailed from Anomabo to Barbados with 260 captives and then to Rhode Island.See SlaveVoyages.org for details on the voyage #36067. On board, Broteer was purchased by Robinson Mumford of Rhode Island for four gallons of rum and a piece of calico and renamed \\"Venture.\\" During the Middle Passage to Barbados a smallpox outbreak took the lives of 60 of his fellow captives. While most of the surviving captives were sold in Barbados, he was brought to New England. =A slave in British colonial America= Smith relays in his narrative that upon the ship's arrival in Barbados, all but four of the slaves were sold to the planters, on August 23, 1739. Smith and three others sailed on to Rhode Island, arriving early in the fall of 1739. Afterwards, Smith went to live at Mumford's residence on Fishers Island, New York. Once there, he worked in the household. At this time, he showed his loyalty to his master. When he received the keys of trunks, he did not give them others even if the master's father asked him to do so. Because of his work, his master increasingly trusted him. He served his master dutifully and was praised highly after faithfully guarding the contents of his Master's chest for an extended period of time. Nevertheless, he was subjected to intense and back-breaking labor at a young age, and severe punishments. His master's son, in particular, tormented him and abused him, and one point attempted to beat him with a pitchfork and ultimately tied him up and whipped him for his defiance. As he grew older, he endured more arduous tasks and severe punishments. In his narrative, Smith recalls his initial experience with his first \\"white master\\", who possessed abundant fertile land near the river.What river? He mentions how his landlord had a tender heart and treated him well, and the landlord's son and Smith even had something similar to friendship. At the age of 22, Smith married another slave named Meg (Margaret). Shortly thereafter, on March 27, 1754, he made an escape attempt, convinced to take flight by an Irish indentured servant named Heddy and two other of Mumford's slaves. During their escape, at Montauk Point, Long Island, Heddy reveals his true intentions and attempts to steal their supplies and all their belongings. After discovering this treachery, Smith and his compatriots hunted down and captured Heddy and returned him to his master, receiving a warm welcome and appreciation for their efforts. In 1754, Smith and his wife had a daughter called Hannah. Less than a month later, Smith was separated from his family when he was sold to Thomas Stanton in Stonington, Connecticut. They were reunited the following year when Stanton bought Meg and Hannah. After Smith had begun saving money that he had earned from working outside jobs and selling produce he grew, he hoped to buy freedom for his family. His time in the service of the Stanton's began peacefully, but he was thrown into discord after Smith found his wife and the wife of Thomas Stanton in a heated dispute, with the latter beating upon the former with a switch. When Smith tried to break up the fight, Mrs. Stanton turned the switch upon him and so Smith took it from her grasp and threw it into the fire. In retaliation for this, Thomas Stanton attacked Smith seemingly out of the blue with a boat oar. After fending off this attack, a vexed Smith went to local authorities to complain about his abuse. Stanton and his brother, who had come to do violence unto Smith for his rebellion received a harsh warning and were publicly humiliated. In revenge for this, the brothers once again assaulted Smith once they were out of sight of the courthouse, and were once again overcome and repulsed by Smith. :I became enraged at this and immediately turned them both under me, laid one of them across the other, and stamped both with my feet what I would. This occasioned my master's brother to advise him to put me off.A Narrative of the Life and Adventures of Venture Chapter II Due to this tumultuous series of events, Smith determined to leave the service of the Stantons. The Smiths had two more children, Solomon in 1756 and Cuff in 1761. Smith was sold twice more. In 1760, he ended up with Capt. Oliver Smith, who agreed to let him buy his freedom. Smith let Venture work for money when his labor was not required at home. Venture Smith tried to earn money by going out to work. Finally, in the spring of 1765, Venture Smith purchased his freedom for 71 pounds and two shillings, a notably exorbitant price. =A free man= Smith moved to Long Island. In 1769, after cutting wood and investing the money he made, Smith purchased his sons, Solomon and Cuff. He earned money to purchase his sons by cutting and cording wood, of which he said he did upwards of 400 cords and threshing out 75 bushels of grain over the course of 6 months. To purchase his sons, he paid 200 dollars (each). He then purchased a black slave for 40 pounds and gave him 60 pounds but the man ran away still owing Smith 40 pounds. He hired out Solomon, his oldest son, to Charles Church for one year to be paid 12 pounds. Solomon being 17 years of age and an able body was, as dictated by Smith, \\"all my hope and dependence for help.\\" During his year of employment, Church had outfitted a whaling boat and convinced the young Solomon to join and in return, he would be compensated with his normal wages and a bonus of a pair of silver buckles. When Smith caught word of the expedition he set off in an attempt to stop his son from putting out to sea, but when he arrived at Church's house he could only see the boat on the horizon. Smith would never again see his oldest son because while on the expedition, he caught scurvy and died. Soon after the death of his son Smith purchased his wife for 40 pounds. He did this expeditiously as she was then pregnant with his unborn child. If she had given birth before he was able to purchase her, he would have had to buy both his wife and his child separately. After welcoming another son, Smith named him Solomon in memory of his deceased eldest son. Smith experienced multiple financial and personal setbacks. He bought a negro man for 400 dollars. However, he wanted to return to his old master, so Smith released him. Venture Smith purchased another negro man for 25 pounds. After his daughter, Hannah was married, she has come down with an illness. However, her husband did not pay adequate attention to her health. Although Smith nursed her, she died. In addition, two of his slaves ran away even though he paid a lot of money. In his early sixties, he was unjustly charged with the loss of a white man's property and charged for ten pounds while visiting New London. Although being absent from the scene with witnesses, he was still prosecuted. Smith then carried this matter to other courts, claiming his innocence, but the judgment was never reversed. This misleading judgment was made out of discrimination against black people. Remembering this experience, he said: \\"Captain Hart was a white gentleman, and I a poor African, therefore it was all right, and good enough for the black dog. \\" In 1775, Smith bought a farm at Haddam Neck, on the Salmon River, in Connecticut. By 1778 he had expanded the initial 10 acres to form a farm of at least 130 acres. Additionally, he made a living by fishing, whaling, farming his land, and trading in the Long Island basin. He lived the remainder of his life at Haddam Neck. In 1798, Smith dictated his life experiences and with his family had it printed by The Bee, in New London, CT. By this time Venture was showing the signs of his old age: his strong, tall body was bowed and he was going blind. The narrative has been the subject of some contention, regarded in many instances as \\"whitewashed\\" and inauthentic. It was suspected that the white editor manipulated Smith's story, a common practice among editors of slave narratives. After four conferences and numerous scholarly papers, it is the conclusion of most scholars and the Documenting Venture Smith Project that the Narrative is entirely Venture Smith's own words. The work is titled A Narrative of the Life and Adventures of Venture, a Native of Africa: But Resident above Sixty Years in the United States of America. Film, media, and popular culture He is referenced in the 1971 film Let's Scare Jessica to Death, by the title character, who makes a gravestone rubbing of Smith's headstone, and later reads it to her husband. Smith was featured in the 1996 PBS television documentary series \\"Africans in America\\" and was the subject of a 2006 USA Today newspaper story.

Career John Buller was born in London on 7 February 1927. His musical career began as a chorister at St Matthew's, Westminster. Although the BBC accepted a work of his in 1946, he opted to earn his living as an architectural surveyor. Buller returned to music in his thirties, taking an external London University BMus in 1964 after private study with Anthony Milner. He gave up his surveying work in 1974 and from then was a full-time composer. Perhaps his best known work is Proença (1977) for electric guitar, mezzo-soprano and orchestra, which was selected by the 1978 International Rostrum of Composers in Paris. Other works include The Mime of Mick, Nick and the Maggies (1978), The Theatre of Memory (1981), the opera Bakxai (1992), Bacchae Metres (1993) and Illusions (1997). In his obituary for John Buller in the Guardian, Martin Wainwright wrote, '...John's discovery of Joyce fuelled him for most of his creative life, and I think what became fundamental to everything he composed was the Joycean notion that imagination is nothing but extended memory, that the commonplace of our musical or aural consciousness is virtually infinite, so that the task of the composer is to go down to the elements of musical consciousness and reorder them. His voice, in everything, came from this vision, and maybe that is why it embraced a wider than usual range of idioms and contrasts, including popular elements.' Buller died in Sherborne, Dorset, aged 77 on 12 September 2004. Following his death, BBC Radio 3's contemporary music programme Hear and Now devoted an episode to Buller's music.

It has around 2,600 inhabitants and it is the southernmost municipality in the Czech Republic. The centre of the town is historically significant and is protected by law as Urban monument zone. Vyšší Brod Monastery, an important historic landmark, is located in the town. The town has many tourists attractions like the Cistercian cloister, the Lipno Reservoir which connects to the Vltava River (which is one of the most popular canoeing routes in the Czech Republic), and the historical town center. History The town extends around the already existent ford its place exceeded Vltava medieval merchant trail from Linz to Bohemia. The settlement was founded on the site of the latest in the 12th century and belonged to the Rosenberg dominion. In 1259 there Vok I. of Rosenberg founded together with the monks of the Cistercian monastery Wilhering and settlement with extensive grounds around them donated. Vyšší Brod received higher status by the decree of Emperor Franz Joseph I in 1870. In 1909, the town began initial building of the railway line between Rybník and Lipno nad Vltavou by industrialists Arnošta Poráka and abbot Bruna Pammera, which was completed and opened in late 1911, ensure the town rail link. In September 1938 the area became the site of fighting between the Czechoslovak armed forces and Sudetendeutsches Freikorps. On 28 September an attack by the Freikorps supported by local German residents to drive Czechoslovak forces off and by the next morning had to retreat to the left bank of the Vltava. Later that day, Czechoslovak reinforcements arrived, one bicycle company and another company by armored train enabling Czechoslovak forces to quickly retake the town. The Munich Agreement later gave the Vyšebrodsko as well as the rest of Sudetenland to Germany. The Nazi government occupied the cloister after expelling the monks who acted against them, and used it as a warehouse of stolen art and historical objects. The German occupation ended on 6 May 1945 with the arrival of the US Army, with which it had fought hopeless at the approaches to the town. Most of the ethnic German population was expelled and was resettled by mostly non-native population in 1945. After the expulsion, most of the monks of German origin restored the monastery. In 1950 the monastery was attacked by the communist State Security, who forcibly took it and sent the remaining monks to labor camps. In 1959, the south of the town was part of the Iron Curtain, behind which there was only a small amount of the population in the villages Studánky and Dolní Drkolná. After the opening of borders in 1989, the town's importance strongly grew due to the direct road to the border crossing at Studánky / Bad Leonfelden. A number of new accommodation and catering facilities were added including retail services (bakery, bookshop owners mostly Vietnamese), including nightclubs. In 1990 the monks returned to the monastery.

The Chironomidae (informally known as chironomids, nonbiting midges, or lake flies) comprise a family of nematoceran flies with a global distribution. They are closely related to the Ceratopogonidae, Simuliidae, and Thaumaleidae. Many species superficially resemble mosquitoes, but they lack the wing scales and elongated mouthparts of the Culicidae. An example of mosquito-resembling species is Tokunagayusurika akamusi. The name Chironomidae stems from the Ancient Greek word kheironómos, \\"a pantomimist\\". Common names and biodiversity This is a large taxon of insects; some estimates of the species numbers suggest well over 10 000 world-wide. Males are easily recognized by their plumose antennae. Adults are known by a variety of vague and inconsistent common names, largely by confusion with other insects. For example, chironomids are known as \\"lake flies\\" in parts of Canada and Lake Winnebago, Wisconsin, but \\"bay flies\\" in the areas near the bay of Green Bay, Wisconsin. They are called \\"sand flies\\", \\"muckleheads\\",\\"Muckleheads\\" from Andre's Weather World (Andre Bernier, staff at WJW-TV), June 2, 2007. \\"muffleheads\\",\\"You don't love muffleheads, but Lake Erie does\\", Sandusky Register, May 24, 2010. \\"Canadian soldiers\\",Galbincea, Barb, \\"Canadian Soldiers Invade Rocky River\\", The Plain Dealer, Cleveland.com, June 18, 2014, accessed June 3, 2015. or \\"American soldiers\\"\\"Call Them Mayflies, Not June Bugs, Biologist Says: University of Windsor Professor Dispels Mayfly Myths\\", CBC News, CBC.ca, May 29, 2012, accessed June 3, 2015. in various regions of the Great Lakes area. They have been called \\"blind mosquitoes\\" or \\"chizzywinks\\" in Florida.Chizzywinks are Blind Mosquitos by Dan Culbert of the University of Florida, August 17, 2005 However, they are not mosquitoes of any sort, and the term \\"sandflies\\" generally refers to various species of biting flies unrelated to the Chironomidae. The group includes the wingless Belgica antarctica, the largest terrestrial animal of Antarctica. The biodiversity of the Chironomidae often goes unnoticed because they are notoriously difficult to identify and ecologists usually record them by species groups. Each morphologically distinct group comprises a number of morphologically identical (sibling) species that can only be identified by rearing adult males or by cytogenetic analysis of the polytene chromosomes. Polytene chromosomes were originally observed in the larval salivary glands of Chironomus midges by Balbiani in 1881. They form through repeated rounds of DNA replication without cell division, resulting in characteristic light and dark banding patterns which can be used to identify inversions and deletions which allow species identification. Behavior and description Larval stages of the Chironomidae can be found in almost any aquatic or semiaquatic habitat, including treeholes, bromeliads, rotting vegetation, soil, and in sewage and artificial containers. They form an important fraction of the macro zoobenthos of most freshwater ecosystems. They are often associated with degraded or low- biodiversity ecosystems because some species have adapted to virtually anoxic conditions and are dominant in polluted waters. Larvae of some species are bright red in color due to a hemoglobin analog; these are often known as \\"bloodworms\\".W.P. Coffman and L.C. Ferrington Jr. 1996. Chironomidae. pp. 635-754. In: R.W. Merritt and K.W. Cummins, eds. An Introduction to the Aquatic Insects of North America. Kendall/Hunt Publishing Company. Their ability to capture oxygen is further increased by their making undulating movements. Many reference sources in the past century or so have repeated the assertion that the Chironomidae do not feed as adults, but an increasing body of evidence contradicts this view. Adults of many species do, in fact, feed. The natural foods reported include fresh fly droppings, nectar, pollen, honeydew, and various sugar-rich materials. The question whether feeding is of practical importance has by now been clearly settled for some Chironomus species, at least; specimens that had fed on sucrose flew far longer than starved specimens, and starved females longer than starved males, which suggested they had eclosed with larger reserves of energy than the males. Some authors suggest the females and males apply the resources obtained in feeding differently. Males expend the extra energy on flight, while females use their food resources to achieve longer lifespans. The respective strategies should be compatible with maximal probability of successful mating and reproduction in those species that do not mate immediately after eclosion, and in particular in species that have more than one egg mass maturing, the less developed masses being oviposited after a delay. Such variables also would be relevant to species that exploit wind for dispersal, laying eggs at intervals. Chironomids that feed on nectar or pollen may well be of importance as pollinators, but current evidence on such points is largely anecdotal. However, the content of protein and other nutrients in pollen, in comparison to nectar, might well contribute to the females' reproductive capacities. Adults can be pests when they emerge in large numbers. They may cause difficulty during driving if they collide with the windshield, creating an opaque coating which obscures the driver's vision. They can damage paint, brick, and other surfaces with their droppings. When large numbers of adults die, they can build up into malodorous piles. They can provoke allergic reactions in sensitive individuals.A. Ali. 1991. Perspectives on management of pestiferous Chironomidae (Diptera), an emerging global problem. Journal of the American Mosquito Control Association 7: 260-281. Ecology Larvae and pupae are important food items for fish, such as trout, banded killifish, and sticklebacks, and for many other aquatic organisms as well such as newts. Many aquatic insects, such as various predatory hemipterans in the families Nepidae, Notonectidae, and Corixidae eat Chironomidae in their aquatic phases. So do predatory water beetles in families such as the Dytiscidae and Hydrophilidae. The flying midges are eaten by fish and insectivorous birds, such as swallows and martins. They are also thought to be an especially important food source for tufted duck chicks during their first few days of life. They also are preyed on by bats and flying predatory insects, such as Odonata and dance flies. The Chironomidae are important as indicator organisms, i.e., the presence, absence, or quantities of various species in a body of water can indicate whether pollutants are present. Also, their fossils are widely used by palaeolimnologists as indicators of past environmental changes, including past climatic variability.Walker, I. R. 2001. Midges: Chironomidae and related Diptera. pp. 43-66, In: J. P. Smol, H. J. B. Birks, and W. M. Last (eds). Tracking Environmental Change Using Lake Sediments. Volume 4. Zoological Indicators. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht. Contemporary specimens are used by forensic entomologists as medico-legal markers for the postmortem interval assessment. A number of chironomid species inhabit marine habitats. Midges of the genus Clunio are found in the intertidal zone, where they have adjusted their entire life cycle to the rhythm of the tides. This made the species Clunio marinus an important model species for research in the field of chronobiology. Anhydrobiosis and stress resistance Anhydrobiosis is the ability of an organism to survive in the dry state. Anhydrobiotic larvae of the African chironomid Polypedilum vanderplanki can withstand prolonged complete desiccation (reviewed by Cornette and Kikawada). These larvae can also withstand other external stresses including ionizing radiation. The effects of anhydrobiosis, gamma ray and heavy-ion irradiation on the nuclear DNA and gene expression of these larvae were studied by Gusev et al. They found that larval DNA becomes severely fragmented both upon anhydrobiosis and irradiation, and that these breaks are later repaired during rehydration or upon recovery from irradiation. An analysis of gene expression and antioxidant activity suggested the importance of removal of reactive oxygen species as well as the removal of DNA damages by repair enzymes. Expression of genes encoding DNA repair enzymes increased upon entering anhydrobiosis or upon exposure to radiation, and these increases indicated that when DNA damages occurred, they were subsequently repaired. In particular, expression of the Rad51 gene was substantially up-regulated following irradiation and during rehydration. The Rad51 protein plays a key role in homologous recombination, a process required for the accurate repair of DNA double-strand breaks. Subfamilies and genera The family is divided into 11 subfamilies: Aphroteniinae, Buchonomyiinae, Chilenomyinae, Chironominae, Diamesinae, Orthocladiinae, Podonominae, Prodiamesinae, Tanypodinae, Telmatogetoninae, and Usambaromyiinae.J.H.

He was called up to the England national team in August 2015, becoming a dual-code international, and was a member of England's squad for their unsuccessful 2015 Rugby Union World Cup campaign, before returning to rugby league for the 2016 NRL season. On 30 October 2019, Burgess announced his retirement from all competitions with immediate effect, due to a career ending shoulder injury. Burgess currently works as an assistant coach for the South Sydney Rabbitohs. Background Burgess, also known by the nickname of \\"Slammin' Sam\\", is one of four rugby league-playing brothers; younger brothers Tom and George are teammates at the Rabbitohs, while older brother Luke retired after playing in England and Australia. Early life Burgess was born on 14 December 1988 in Liversedge, Kirklees, West Yorkshire, England. His late father, Mark Burgess, who died of motor neurone disease, was also a rugby league footballer who played for Nottingham City, Rochdale Hornets, Dewsbury and Hunslet; whilst his mother, Julie, is a teacher, currently employed at The Scots College in Bellevue Hill, Sydney. His older brother, Luke, and younger twin brothers, Tom and George, are also professional rugby league footballers. He attended Heckmondwike Grammar School. He played his junior rugby for Hunslet Parkside, Dewsbury Moor and also played for Liversedge Cricket Club. Rugby league =Bradford Bulls= Burgess playing for the Bradford Bulls in 2008 Burgess made his Super League début against Leeds in 2006 after already being dubbed by Shontayne Hape as \\"Great Britain's Sonny Bill\\". After a highly successful début season with the Bulls, Burgess was awarded the Senior Academy Player of the Year Award by the club. In 2007 Burgess established himself as a first team regular. After a great full season he was called up for the Great Britain squad for the 2007 Test series with New Zealand, and was named as young player of the year in the Super League. Burgess made his Great Britain début against New Zealand in the 1st test in October 2007, scoring a try. Burgess also played in the centenary match between the All Golds and Northern Union; he was awarded the Man of the match. He gained attention for his big hit on New Zealand prop Fuifui Moimoi during the Kiwis' 2007 tour when he was only 19 years old. At the end of 2008's Super League XIII, Burgess was forced to rule himself out contention for the England 2008 World Cup squad because of injury. In September 2009, the South Sydney Rabbitohs announced they had signed Burgess on a four-year deal from the 2010 season. Burgess, on contract at the Bradford Bulls until the end of the 2010 season, was released after the clubs agreed on a compensation fee. South Sydney co-owner and A-list celebrity Russell Crowe persuaded Burgess to choose his club over others that were competing for his signature, after inviting Burgess and his mother to the set of Robin Hood, which he was filming in England at the time. Burgess, in his last game in the UK before moving to the NRL, played a prominent role in the final of the 2009 Four Nations tournament, scoring two tries in England's defeat by Australia. =South Sydney= John Sutton in 2012. Before he had played a game for South Sydney Burgess played for the NRL All Stars in the inaugural All Stars match after Rabbitohs prop Dave Taylor injured his ankle at training. It was played at Skilled Park on the Gold Coast on 13 February 2010. The NRL All Stars lost the game 16–12. He was selected to play for England against France in the one-off test in 2010. Burgess was given a one- week ban by the NRL Judiciary for a grade one grapple tackle. He was placed on report during Round 21, against the Canterbury Bulldogs, for a grapple tackle made on Canterbury fullback Ben Barba. Burgess therefore missed the Round 22 clash against Wests Tigers. This suspension came at a fairly pivotal time in the season, as forwards Michael Crocker, Luke Stuart, Scott Geddes, and Dave Taylor had all been ruled out from the clash already. Burgess continued to represent England at the end of the season in the 2010 Four Nations tournament. His shoulder was injured in the first game of the 2011 NRL season against the Roosters on 11 March, for which he needed surgery and a month of rest. However, as soon as he came back from that, he injured his ankle and is out for the remainder of 2011. Burgess in 2013 In August 2013, the Burgess brothers became the first set of four brothers to line up in the same Australian side since Ray, Roy, Rex and Bernard Norman played for Sydney's Annandale club during the 1910 NSWRFL season. That year, Burgess was banned for two games following his infamous \\"squirrel grip\\" on Will Chambers – where Chambers's testicles were grabbed during a game. Sam was in a DVD about his life called 'Slammin' Sam: The Sam Burgess Story' After the 2013 NRL season Burgess represented England in the 2013 World Cup. On 17 February 2014, it was announced that at the end of the year Burgess would switch to rugby union. In what was his last match for South Sydney, Burgess, along with brothers Tom and George played against the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs in the 2014 NRL Grand Final. Despite suffering a broken cheekbone in the first tackle of the game, Burgess continued to play on, with his team winning the match. He was awarded the Clive Churchill Medal for best player in the grand final. Taking into account the retrospective Clive Churchill medal awarded to Ron Coote in 1971, Sam Burgess was the first South Sydney player to claim the medal in 43 years. 220px Rugby union Burgess was signed for Bath Rugby in England's top competition on a three-year contract, starting from October 2014. His start date was then delayed until December 2014 due to complicated surgery to fix a fractured cheek and eye socket. He was seen by the English rugby union as their answer to Sonny Bill Williams – a big ball-playing rugby league forward who can transfer those skills to the backline midfield in union. He scored his first try for Bath in the 13th round of the Premiership against Wasps at the Recreation ground and was awarded man of the match. On 21 January, he was named in the England Saxons squad to play the Irish Wolfhounds. On 10 April, Burgess started in the Aviva Premiership against Newcastle Falcons at blindside flanker. Burgess completed the most turnovers of any player in the matches of that round. On 10 August, Burgess was named in the England Elite Squad to make his International début against France at Twickenham on 15 August, in a warm-up match for the Rugby World Cup. He started the game which England won 19-14.\\"England beat France 19-14 in Rugby World Cup warm-up\\" BBC Sport. 15 August 2015. Retrieved 16 August 2015. Following his appearance where he was sin-binned, World Cup winning English scrum half Matt Dawson commented: \\"You can't take him to the World Cup for me. He played 80 mins and credit for that. But the way the game went in the second half there was nothing for him to do. The great thing about Burgess is he doesn't make mistakes with ball in hand. But unfortunately, if you're going to be really picky, positionally he wasn't great. He played like a six rather than a 12. There are things that are instinctively he doesn’t know what to do.\\" Dawson's comments came before Lancaster named Burgess as one of four centres including Henry Slade to represent England in the World Cup. His inclusion and performances at the World Cup were widely scrutinized, and seen by some pundits as partly to blame for England's \\"humiliating\\" early pool stage exit from the tournament—the worst result for a host nation in the tournament's history. Burgess in 2018 claimed \\"\\"If people actually re-watched the games I participated in you will see I added to the team. What cost us an early exit was individual egos and selfish players not following our leader.\\" England led Wales 25-18 when Burgess was substituted in the 70th minute in his final game for England. On 5 November, Burgess made the decision to leave rugby union, opting to return to South Sydney Rabbitohs, signing a three-year contract.\\"Sam Burgess leaves Bath to rejoin South Sydney Rabbitohs\\" BBC Sport. 5 November 2015. Retrieved 5 November 2015 Rugby league return In early November 2015 it was reported that Burgess had been signed to the South Sydney Rabbitohs for $1.5m AUD per season. This figure would make him the highest paid rugby league footballer of all time and in the top three highest paid of either code. In December 2015 Burgess was selected to play for the World All Stars in the 2016 Rugby League All Stars Match alongside his brother Tom Burgess. In October 2016, Burgess was named in the 24-man England squad for the 2016 Four Nations tournament. He was also announced the new captain under new coach Wayne Bennett after original captain Sean O'Loughlin was unavailable through injury. In October 2017 he was selected in the England squad for the 2017 Rugby League World Cup. In the week leading up to the final, Burgess was made captain as Sean O'Loughlin pulled out with injury. England went on to lose the final to Australia 6-0. On 6 December 2017, it was announced that Burgess had agreed to a contract extension with Souths keeping him at the club until the end of 2019. On 5 September 2018 Burgess signed a four-year contract with Souths keeping him at the club until the end of the 2023 season. The new contract deal coincided with Souths returning to form in The NRL with the club finishing third on the table at the end of the regular season. The following week, Burgess and South Sydney were embroiled in an off field incident involving Souths players exposing themselves on Instagram to a female fan back in May 2018. A report by The Daily Telegraph verified social media accounts belonging to Burgess were at the centre of the saga. On 21 September 2018, Burgess was cleared by the NRL of any wrongdoing. Burgess then spoke to the media saying “I have not sexted anyone, I fully co-operated with the inquiry as I said I would. I have engaged lawyer Chris Murphy to pursue my remedies and he has retained defamation lawyers\\". Burgess started the 2019 NRL season strongly as Souths won 10 of their first 11 games. Following Souths Round 13 loss against Newcastle, Burgess was ruled out with a shoulder injury. It was later revealed that Burgess needed a drip inserted into his heart to fight an infection after shoulder surgery and was ruled out from playing indefinitely. Burgess returned to the Souths side for their Round 20 match against Cronulla which Souths lost 39-24 at Shark Park. Burgess was placed on report during the match after hitting Cronulla player Matt Moylan with a high tackle. On 21 August 2019 Burgess was voted as one of the best players of the decade in the NRL team of the decade announcement which spanned from the 2010 to 2019 seasons. The panel who voted were made up of Premiership-winning coaches Phil Gould, Craig Bellamy, Trent Robinson and Ricky Stuart along with Hall of Famers Peter Sterling, Darren Lockyer, Danny Buderus and Laurie Daley. In round 25 of the 2019 NRL season, Burgess was replaced on report in South Sydney's victory over arch rivals the Sydney Roosters. Burgess was alleged to have pulled the hair of Easts player Billy Smith. Burgess was later suspended for one match over the incident. On 18 September 2019, Burgess was asked by NRL CEO Todd Greenberg to meet with him and show cause as to why he should not be reprimanded for an outburst he made about criticism in relation to the NRL judiciary. In an interview with the media Burgess said \\"Everyone seems to be in uproar about this judiciary system, “Who is making the calls here? Is there a discussion before these calls go out there? I don’t know. What’s the process? It’s like a kangaroo court in there\\". At the end of the 2019 regular season, South Sydney finished in third place on the table and qualified for the finals. Burgess missed the qualifying final against the Sydney Roosters due to his suspension in round 25. Burgess returned for the elimination semi- final against Manly-Warringah which Souths won 34-26 at ANZ Stadium. The following week, Burgess played in South Sydney's 16-10 preliminary final loss against Canberra at Canberra Stadium. On 30 October 2019, Burgess was forced into early retirement due to a chronic shoulder injury. Burgess released a statement saying \\"To all South Sydney members and fans, fans of the game and even the supporters that aren't my biggest fans, I'd like to thank each and every one of you for making my career what it was in the NRL, I have loved absolutely every minute; the highs, the lows; the Grand Final; coming home; my injuries; my dates with the judiciary. It really has been a fantastic ride\\".

The project has been developed in 1993 by a police officer from Ridderkerk (The Netherlands) to retrieve missing children, catching (red-handed) criminals and finding lost children and elderly people with assistance of citizens. How it works Citizens register for Burgernet on the Burgernet website by providing their name and address. They are now able to receive Burgernet messages about their neighborhood. Burgernet starts with an emergency call (for example mugging, burglary or missing person.) If it is possible to compose a distinctive description of the suspect or missing person the police emergency room activates the Burgernet community by sending a text message (Sms) or spoken message. Burgernet participants in the immediate environment of the crime receive a message with a call to action to look for the suspect/ missing person. They report to the police what they see or recently have seen. The Burgernet system enables attentive participants to report directly to the police operator. This gives the possibility to process real time information quickly. With the information given by the participant the operator directs nearby police units to the missing or suspect person. All participants are informed about the results of the intervention. History A test with Burgernet has been executed in Nieuwegein (The Netherlands) in 2004 and 2005. After an extensive inquiry, the test has been found successful and the test has been extended to 9 municipalities in 2006. In 2009 Dutch government decided Burgernet would be put into service nationwide. In 2012 Burgernet was activated in nearly all of the 400 Dutch communities. More than 1,4 million citizens joined Burgernet (9% of Dutch population). The Burgernet app has been downloaded 240.000 times and the Burgernet messages are embedded in over 30.000 Twitter timelines (reference date November 2014). On average Burgernet is used in 600 time-critical situations each month (January – August 2014 4.958 actions). 555 were solved thanks to information given by Burgernet participants (11%). Source: Burgernet dashboard Evolution Burgernet app (Android) Throughout the years the Burgernet system has been constantly improved. Since 2011 the Burgernet messages are automatically transformed into short messages send by RSS feed to social media. In 2013 the Burgernet app was launched. This application uses the location of the smartphone user to relocate the Burgernet actions which take place in the immediate environment of the user.

Before the war, Fort Mackinac had been an important American trading post in the straits between Lake Michigan and Lake Huron. It was important for its influence and control over the Native American tribes in the area, which was sometimes referred to in historical documents as \\"Michilimackinac\\". A scratch British, Canadian and Native American force had captured the island in the early days of the war. An American expedition was mounted in 1814 to recover the island. The American force advertised its presence by attempting to attack British outposts elsewhere on Lake Huron and Georgian Bay, so when they eventually landed on Mackinac Island, the garrison was prepared to meet them. As the Americans advanced on the fort from the north, they were ambushed by Native Americans, and forced to re-embark with heavy casualties. Background Mackinac Island, and the Canadian North West Company's trading post at Sault Ste. Marie nearby were vital posts in the fur trade, which dominated the economy and way of life of the Native American nations in the area known as the Old Northwest. Most of the Native Americans were opposed to United States expansion and encroachment in the area. On 18 July 1812, a mixed force of British regular soldiers, Canadian voyageurs and Native Americans captured Mackinac Island in the Siege of Fort Mackinac before the American defenders knew that war had been declared between the United States and Britain. The news of this success influenced many more Native tribes who had previously been neutral or undecided to rally to the British cause, contributing to several more British victories over the next year. The British meanwhile abandoned their own defences at St. Joseph Island and concentrated their forces at Mackinac Island. For the rest of the year and through much of 1813, the British hold on Mackinac was secure since they also held Detroit, which the Americans would have to recapture before attacking Mackinac. Then on 10 September 1813, the Americans won the decisive naval Battle of Lake Erie, which allowed them to recover Detroit and defeat the retreating British and Native force at the Battle of the Thames. Although it was too late in the year to allow the Americans to mount an expedition to recover Mackinac before the lakes froze in winter, they had nevertheless cut the British supply lines to the post. The British garrison, commanded by Captain Richard Bullock of the 41st Regiment of Foot, were placed on half rations and also procured some fish and maize locallyElting, p.276 but were suffering severe shortages by the end of the winter. =British defences= In February 1814, Lieutenant Colonel Robert McDouall of the Glengarry Light Infantry was ordered to re-establish communications with Mackinac and take charge of the post. McDouall's first task was to open a new supply line from York via Yonge Street and Lake Simcoe to the Nottawasaga River, which flows into Georgian Bay. The Nottawasaga was selected in preference to the established post at Penetanguishene on Matchedash Bay, even though the navigation from the Nottwasaga was obstructed by rocks and shoals.Zaslow (ed), p.146 However, the route from Lake Simcoe to Penetanguishene would need to be improved for , which would be almost impossible in the depths of winter, while the overland portage to the Nottawasaga was shorter and much more easily improved. In May 1814, 21 sailors from the Royal Navy arrived to reinforce the crew of HMS Nancy, a schooner vital to resupplying Fort Mackinac. McDouall's party consisted of ninety men of the Royal Newfoundland Fencibles, most of whom were accustomed to serving as marines, and eleven artillerymen with four field guns. He also brought with him twenty-one sailors of the Royal Navy to reinforce the crew of the schooner Nancy, which was being refitted at St. Joseph Island at the time, and thirty carpenters to assist in constructing thirty batteaux. On 19 April, McDouall's batteaux began descending the river with the Newfoundlanders, artillerymen and sailors, and reached the Lake on 25 April. He arrived at Mackinac on 18 May, carrying a large quantity of provisions for the hungry garrison and the Native allies, having lost only one boat en route despite stormy weather. A few days later he was reinforced by another 200 Native Americans, who were under the nominal leadership of Lieutenant Robert Dickson of the Indian Department. McDouall ordered the defences of the island to be strengthened. The existing fort was situated on a ridge which dominated the harbour on the south side of the island, but was itself overlooked by another wooded ridge, the highest point on the island. In 1812, the British had dragged artillery to this ridge to compel the fort to surrender.Elting, p.29 McDouall's troops built a stockade and blockhouse on the upper ridge, naming the new fortification Fort George. Plans to rebuild the Nancy as a gunboat were abandoned, and the Nancy instead made two round trips between Mackinac Island and the Nottawasaga to carry supplies.Zaslow (ed), p.147 =American plans= American Brig Gen Duncan McArthur established Fort Gratiot in 1814 as an advanced base to retake Mackinac Island. In 1814, the Americans attempted to retake the island as part of a larger campaign designed to sever the fur trading alliance between the British and the Natives in the northwestern states and territories. The United States Secretary of the Navy, William Jones, supported an attack on Mackinac as this would provide employment for the vessels of the American squadron on Lake Erie, which otherwise would have little further useful part to play in the war. The expedition to recover Mackinac was prepared at Detroit, and Brigadier General Duncan McArthur established Fort Gratiot at the southern end of Lake Huron as an advanced base.Elting, p.273 William Clark, Governor of the Missouri Territory, meanwhile led an expedition to establish a fort at Prairie du Chien on the Mississippi River. News that the Americans had occupied Prairie du Chien arrived at Mackinac on 21 June. McDouall was compelled to weaken his garrison by despatching an expedition under William McKay (who held the local rank of Lieutenant Colonel) to recover the post. On 3 July, a squadron of five American brigs and gunboats under Commodore Arthur Sinclair sailed from Detroit, carrying an embarked landing force of 700 soldiers under the command of Lieutenant Colonel George Croghan. The force consisted of an ad hoc battalion of regular infantry (made up of five detached companies of the 17th, 19th and 24th U.S. Infantry) under Major Andrew Holmes and a battalion of volunteers from the Ohio militia under Colonel William Cotgreave,Lossing's Field Book of the War of 1812 with detachments of artillery.Elting, p.278 Rather than make directly for Mackinac, the American squadron first searched Matchedash Bay for the base from which the British at Mackinac were supplied, which the Americans thought was at Penetanguishene. As the weather was foggy and the Americans had no pilots familiar with the area, which abounded with islets and sunken rocks, they spent a week in the bay but found nothing. They then sailed to St. Joseph Island, which had been the original British military post in 1812, but found it had been abandoned. They burned the empty post, and also the Canadian North West Company trading post at Sault Sainte Marie. The Americans finally arrived off Mackinac on 26 July. Their delayed arrival had given McDouall ample warning, and he had further reinforced his defences by calling in the last two companies of militia left to defend St. Joseph Island and Sault Ste. Marie. Battle After two days of naval bombardment, Lt Col George Croghan decided to land his force on the north side of the island, and work his way through the woods to attack the British positions. The American ships attempted to bombard the fort for two days, with most of the shot falling harmlessly in vegetable gardens around the fort. Sinclair discovered that the new British blockhouse, Fort George, stood too high for the naval guns to reach. A dense fog then forced the American squadron away from the island for a week. When they returned, Croghan decided on 4 August to land on the north side of the island roughly where the British had landed in 1812 (the present-day community of British Landing) and work his way through the woods to attack the blockhouse. The American brigs and gunboats bombarded the woods around the landing site to flush out any Natives, further sacrificing any chance of gaining surprise.Elting, p.279 Rather than wait to be attacked, McDouall left only 25 militiamen in Fort Mackinac and another 25 in the blockhouse and advanced with the main body of his force to occupy low breastworks which faced a clearing which lay on the Americans' line of advance. His force consisted of 140 men of the Royal Newfoundland and the locally raised Michigan Fencibles, 150 Menominee from the Wisconsin River, who McDouall considered to be the best fighters at his disposal,Zaslow (ed), p.148 and one 6-pounder and one 3-pounder field guns. When the Americans emerged from the woods into the clearing, they were easy targets for the British guns. Croghan brought up two 6-pounder guns, but meanwhile he sent his Ohio Volunteers, leading the advance, to outflank the British left, and sent the detachment of regulars through the woods around the British right. These manoeuvres proceeded very slowly, because of the difficult terrain. While they were in progress, a false report of another American landing west of the fort caused McDouall to withdraw the Newfoundland and Michigan Fencibles, but the American regulars were ambushed by the Natives. Thirteen Americans were killed, including Major Holmes, Captain Isaac Van Horne and another officer, fifty-one were wounded (including Captain Benjamin Desha, second in command of the regulars) and the Americans were thrown into confusion. McDouall meanwhile discovered that there was no landing behind him, and moved his redcoated infantry back into their positions. The heavy losses and confusion among the United States regulars, and the return of McDouall's infantry, forced Croghan to order his men to retreat through the woods to the beach. Two wounded Americans were left to be taken prisoner. The Americans rowed back to their ships, leaving the fort in the British hands until the end of the war. Aftermath The American expedition subsequently located the post at the Nottawasaga River and on 15 August, they captured it before returning to Detroit. The British scuttled the schooner Nancy, which had taken refuge in the Nottawasaga River, so that it would not fall into American hands. Commodore Sinclair left the gunboats USS Tigress and USS Scorpion to blockade Mackinac, hoping to starve the garrison into surrender before the following spring. In the Engagement on Lake Huron, both vessels fell into British hands, securing the British hold on the entire region. Five active regular battalions of the United States Army (1-3 Inf, 2-3 Inf, 4-3 Inf, 2-7 Inf and 3-7 Inf) perpetuate the lineages of the former 17th, 19th and 24th United States Infantry Regiments, elements of which participated in the battle. Within the Canadian Army, the history and heritage of the Royal Newfoundland Fencibles is carried on by the Royal Newfoundland Regiment (RNR). Among three Battle Honours awarded to the RNR for the War of 1812, it carries the Theatre Honour, Defence of Canada 1812-1815, for services rendered by the Regiment in engagements throughout the War, including the Battle of Mackinac Island. Most of the site of the Battle of Mackinac Island is now the Wawashkamo Golf Links, laid out in 1898.

Rhodes Arena, nicknamed \\"The JAR,\\" is an arena in Akron, Ohio, United States on the campus of the University of Akron. It was built next to and replaced the University's 3,000-seat Memorial Hall gymnasium. Named for former Ohio governor Jim Rhodes, the arena opened in 1983 and is home to the Akron Zips men's and women's basketball teams and women's volleyball team. History 200px The new facility was six years in the making. In 1977, the Ohio General Assembly appropriated $8 million to build a 10,000-seat building over the next two years. But by October 1978, when preliminary plans for the new complex were presented and accepted by the Ohio Board of Regents, the cost of construction had risen to $12.5 million. So the University scrapped the original design in favor of a scaled-down version: a building, including an wood floor, designed by architect Thomas T. K. Zung. The University Board of Trustees approved the new version in July 1981, and ground was broken on March 8, 1982. The building opened on December 3, 1983. The building sits on the eastern edge of campus, on the northeast corner of Union and Carroll streets, on a site that once served Fire Station No. 5 and a parking lot. The JAR hosted the Ohio Valley Conference men's basketball tournament in 1986. In 2002, renovations included a new hardwood floor, four Opto Tech LED displays screen above the game floor, and a $1.1 million sound system. The new system, built under the guidance of the University Athletic audio engineers, replaced a distributed horn-powered PA system with very narrow dispersion angles, coupled with near-proximity coaxial speakers for the upper deck. This setup led to several hot zones and many fans wondering what the announcer said. That changed in 2005 with the installation of a fully zoned system employing EVH- model horn-loaded boxes coupled with six TX Series subwoofers in the South catwalk for the tipoff \\"Thunderstruck\\" kick. A separate zone was also included for the floor for the UA Dance Team and Basketball team warmups. Precision series EV combined amplifiers and DSPs tune the system. A Midas Venice series mixing console along with several channels of external dynamic channel processing, as well as better hyperspheric modulation accelerators, handle all audio inputs. The system has reached a 115 dB during games, and is rated up to 130 dB.http://www.gozips.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=10800&KEY;=&ATCLID;=319729 The facility seats 5,500 people on two floors. In addition to the court, the first level features locker rooms, a sports medicine and training facility, a ticket office, a fan team shop and meeting rooms. During the early 2000s, when LeBron James played on the boys basketball team from nearby St. Vincent - St. Mary High School, some home games were played at the JAR, where they typically outdrew the Zips' men's games.ESPN.com: NCB - Zips try to retake Akron from LeBron The decision to name the arena after former governor Rhodes was highly controversial; he ordered the Ohio National Guard to nearby Kent State University before the May 4, 1970 shootings.

Biography Born in Akmolinsk, Imperial Russia (modern Nur-Sultan in Kazakhstan). He graduated from Tomsk Polytechnic University, and worked at the Soviet Research Institute of Electromechanics. Kazantsev was a member of the Soviet delegation at the 1939 New York World's Fair. When Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, Kazantsev joined the army. He left military service in 1945 with the rank of colonel, and was awarded a number of orders, including Order of the Patriotic War and Order of the Red Star. From then on, Kazantsev settled in the \\"literary village\\" of Peredelkino and concentrated on his writings. He survived the dissolution of the Soviet Union and died in 2002. Writings Kazantsev was an enthusiast of the unknown, and a pioneer of Soviet UFOlogy. Many of his works, both fiction and non-fiction, deal with controversial scientific theories. He researched the Tunguska event and published a number of science fiction, as well as popular science books, on the topic. He believed the Tunguska impact was caused by an alien spacecraft that crash-landed on the Earth. Kazantsev researched events and legends that he believed were evidences of paleocontacts with extraterrestrials. His novel The Destruction of Faena, an adaptation of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, is based on the hypothetical planet Phaeton that some believe existed in the orbit of modern asteroid belt. According to the novel, Phaeton was inhabited by a developed civilisation of the phaetae race, who survived the destruction of their planet and brought some of their culture to the prehistorical people of Earth. Kazantsev was also interested in the Martian canal theory, and used it in his fiction concerning Mars. He was also a composer of chess endgame studies. In 1975 he was awarded by the Permanent Commission of the FIDE for Chess Compositions (PCCC) the title of International Master of Composition.

In the abstract, the resulting structures are a crucial aspect of metadata, often represented as a hierarchical structure and accompanied by descriptive information of the classes or groups. Such a classification scheme is intended to be used for an arrangement or division of individual objects into the classes or groups, and the classes or groups are based on characteristics which the objects (members) have in common. In linguistics, subordinate concepts are described as hyponyms of their respective superordinates; typically, a hyponym is 'a kind of' its superordinate.Keith Allan (2002, p. 260), Natural language Semantics, Blackwell Publishers Ltd, Oxford, . The ISO/IEC 11179 metadata registry standard uses classification schemes as a way to classify administered items, such as data elements, in a metadata registry. Some quality criteria for classification schemes are: * Whether different kinds are grouped together. In other words, whether it is a grouping system or a pure classification system. In case of grouping, a subset (subgroup) does not have (inherit) all the characteristics of the superset, which makes that the knowledge and requirements about the superset are not applicable for the members of the subset. * Whether the classes have overlaps. * Whether subordinates (may) have multiple superordinates. Some classification schemes allow that a kind of thing has more than one superordinate others don't. Multiple supertypes for one subtype implies that the subordinate has the combined characteristics of all its superordinates. This is called multiple inheritance (of characteristics from multiple superordinates to their subordinates). * Whether the criteria for belonging to a class or group are well defined. * Whether the kinds of relations between the concepts are made explicit and well defined. * Whether subtype-supertype relations are distinguished from composition relations (part-whole relations) and from object-role relations. Benefits of using classification schemes Using one or more classification schemes for the classification of a collection of objects has many benefits. Some of these include: * It allows a user to find an individual object quickly on the basis of its kind or group. * It makes it easier to detect duplicate objects. * It conveys semantics (meaning) of an object from the definition of its kind, which meaning is not conveyed by the name of the individual object or its way of spelling. * Knowledge and requirements about a kind of thing can be applied to the members of the kind. Kinds of classification schemes The following are examples of different kinds of classification schemes. This list is in approximate order from informal to more formal: * thesaurus - a collection of categorized concepts, denoted by words or phrases, that are related to each other by narrower term, wider term and related term relations. * taxonomy - a formal list of concepts, denoted by controlled words or phrases, arranged from abstract to specific, related by subtype-supertype relations or by superset- subset relations. * data model - an arrangement of concepts (entity types), denoted by words or phrases, that have various kinds of relationships. Typically, but not necessarily, representing requirements and capabilities for a specific scope (application area). * network (mathematics) - an arrangement of objects in a random graph. * ontology - an arrangement of concepts that are related by various well defined kinds of relations. The arrangement can be visualized in a directed acyclic graph. One example of a classification scheme for data elements is a representation term.

She originally wanted to take art history, but she was rejected by five universities, and she climbed the corporate ladder from being an office junior in a local firm of accountants to become a qualified tax consult with Arthur Andersen. Career =Red Letter Days= In 1989, Elnaugh founded Red Letter Days, one of the first UK companies to sell experiential gifts such as motor racing days, hot air ballooning and health spa days. (link via Internet Archive) The idea to set up Red Letter Days came from purchasing tickets to a cricket match for her father as a gift. The company grew to an £18 million turnover, and led to Elnaugh being a 2001/2 finalist in the Veuve Clicquot Businesswoman of the Year and Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year. After an attempt to expand the business into the retail sector, Red Letter Days went into administration on 1 August 2005; Elnaugh had become a dragon on the TV series Dragons' Den, the remaining assets and goods of Red Letter Days were bought by fellow dragons Peter Jones and Theo Paphitis. ITV1's Tonight programme criticized the business model of Red Letter Days, which included unpaid suppliers and disappointed purchasers.

There were only two restrooms in the entire arena--a serious problem whenever attendance was anywhere near capacity. It lacked a number of modern conveniences, such as air conditioning. The concession facilities were well behind the times. Its acoustics and seating arrangement for concerts left much to be desired. Most severely, it was nowhere near compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

James, who wrote \\"The only cure for dipsomania is religiomania\\" in The Varieties of Religious Experience, is cited in the \\"Spiritual Experience\\" appendix of The Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous. Varieties of Religious Experience uses the singular term \\"higher power\\" 4 times, and the plural \\"higher powers\\" 7 times, to refer to powers beyond the self that may provide assistance.

Among his findings were that 8% stated \\"I don't believe in a personal god, but I do believe in a higher power of some kind.\\" This is the same figure as found by the 1999 Gallup national poll of Americans. Sherkat also found that 16% of the Jewish people surveyed agreed with the statement about a 'higher power', while 13.2% of liberal Protestants and 10.6% of Episcopalians also agreed with it. An empirically based recovery framework likened faith in a higher power to motivation for personal growth as described by Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers.  Criticism  = Christian = Celebrate Recovery was founded by a group of Christians who criticized the higher power concept as being too vague. In the twelve-step derived group, Jesus is the only higher power allowed. = Gender theory = M. E. O'Hare-Lavin argues that the concept of a higher power represents a masculine perception of spiritual recovery, such as the hero's journeys of Moses, Gautama Buddha, Jesus, Odysseus, Icarus and Percival, and that the archetypal feminine heroic journey is a chthonic underworld journey, lower and deeper; like those of Persephone, Psyche, Eurydice and Inanna. Her opinion is that the higher power spirituality may not necessarily be relevant to women in recovery.*  In popular culture  * The children's novel The Higher Power of Lucky, which received the Newbery Medal in 2007, is a story of a child who follows the direction of her higher power, a concept she learned from a twelve-step group. * Rock group Boston recorded a song called \\"Higher Power\\" about drug addiction that was included on their Greatest Hits album. * President of the United States George W.

He was an extremely zealous and active Protestant and a supporter of the Orange Order. Political career Hamilton was seated as a member of parliament (MP) for Dublin City on 13 April 1835, after a successful election petition. He represented this constituency until he was defeated in the general election of 1837. Hamilton was subsequently elected one of the MPs for Dublin University at a by-election on 10 February 1843 and continued to represent the seat until he resigned in January 1859. He occupied the political post of Financial Secretary to the Treasury in the first (from 2 March 1852 until 17 December 1852) and second ministries of the Earl of Derby (2 March 1858 to January 1859). Hamilton was appointed Assistant Secretary to the Treasury in 1859 and Permanent Secretary to the Treasury in 1867. These were the most senior civil service posts in the Treasury at that time, and Hamilton continued to serve until 1870. He was made a member of the Privy Council of Ireland on 7 August 1869. Background Hamilton was born at Tyrella, Downpatrick, County Down, on 29 August 1802. He was the elder son of the Rev. George Hamilton of Hampton Hall, Balbriggan, County Dublin, who died in March 1833 (first cousin of George Hamilton, the Canadian lumber baron), by Anna, daughter of Thomas Pepper of Ballygarth Castle, County Meath. His grandfather, George Hamilton (d. 1793), who was a Baron of the Court of Exchequer (Ireland) from 1776 to 1793, was a younger brother of Hugh Hamilton, Bishop of Ossory. He was sent to Rugby School in 1814, and matriculated from Trinity College, Oxford, 15 December 1818, took his B.A. degree in 1821, and was created D.C.L. 9 June 1853. MP and civil servant Soon after leaving the university he settled on the paternal estate and began to take a part in the public political meetings in Dublin. At the general election in 1826 he became a candidate for the representation of that city, but after a severe and expensive contest lasting fourteen days was defeated by a small majority. In 1830 and 1832 he again unsuccessfully contested the seat for Dublin. At the close of another election for Dublin in January 1835 the numbers were: O'Connell 2,678, Ruthven 2,630, Hamilton 2,461, West 2,455. A petition was, however, presented; the commissioners sat from 3 May 1835 to 6 January 1836, and from 29 Feb to 26 May, when Hamilton and West were declared duly elected. In the following year, 1837, he again contested Dublin unsuccessfully, and although in presenting a petition he was supported by ‘the Protestants of England,’ and a sum of money known as the Spottiswoode subscription was raised to assist him in paying his expenses, O'Connell on this occasion retained his seat. Throughout his career he took the side of the Orangemen, and was a prominent figure in the Protestant demonstrations. On the formation of the ‘Lay Association for the Protection of Church Property’ in August 1834, he became the honorary secretary of the association, and for a long period worked energetically in the cause. In parliament he was chiefly known as having presented the petition of the celebrated Protestant meeting of 14 January 1837, which gave rise to much discussion and subsequently to the Earl of Roden's committee of inquiry. On 10 February 1843, on the occurrence of a chance vacancy, he was returned by the University of Dublin, which constituency he represented without intermission until February 1859. To him was mainly due the formation of the Conservative Society for Ireland, which formed the rallying point for the conservative party after the passing of the Reform Bill. On 2 June 1845 he spoke on the subject of the 'godless college bill', as the measure which became the Queen's Colleges (Ireland) Act 1845 was popularly known, due to the fact that the three colleges it created could not give instruction in theology. Another speech of 21 August 1848 was printed with the title of 'Education in Ireland. Report of Speech in the House of Commons on Mr. Hamilton's motion on above subject,' 1848. On 21 June 1849 his proposal for an alteration in education in Ireland so as to make it acceptable to the Protestant clergy was lost by 162 to 102 votes. He held the financial secretaryship of the treasury under Lord Derby's administration from March to December 1852, and again on the return of the conservatives to power from March 1858 to January 1859. At this latter date he was appointed Permanent Secretary of the Treasury. He was sworn a member of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom 7 August 1869, and in the following year was named one of the Commissioners of the Church Temporalities in Ireland. He was a magistrate and Deputy-Lieutenant for Dublin County, and an LL.D. of Dublin University. Private life  In his role as local landowner and MP he was, like his father and grandfather, very active in the commercial development of Balbriggan, expanding the harbour facilities and encouraging the development of the local hosiery manufactory. He was chairman of the company that built the Great Northern Railway from Dublin to Belfast. A keen antiquarian, he conducted rescue archaeology on a major passage grave discovered at Gormanston, County Meath, in the course of the building of the railway and wrote reports on this and other archaeological discoveries in the proceedings of the Royal Dublin Society. During the Great Irish famine he chaired the Relief Committee in the Balrothery Union of parishes which provided soup, bread and meal to the starving throughout the North Fingal area. Death He died in Kingstown (now Dún Laoghaire), Ireland, 17 September 1871 and was buried in St George's church, Balbriggan. Despite his lifelong advocacy of unionism the last few miles of the journey to his burial was lined by thousands of grieving Roman Catholics and he received a laudatory obituary in the Nationalist Freeman's Journal. Family  His wife, whom he married 1 May 1835, was Amelia Fancourt, daughter of Joshua Uhthoff of Bath, Somerset, England. His father-in-law (whose family were originally from Bremen) had a distinguished career in the Colonial Civil Service, and became Deputy British Resident at Poona. Hamilton was a cousin of the colonial judge John Walpole Willis. References *\\" Paul Boyer, Clifford Clark Jr., Joseph Kett, Neal Salisbury, Harvard Sitkoff.

Rose Center and Rose Arena, is a multi-purpose arena, in Mount Pleasant, Michigan, United States. The arena opened in 1973 and is part of a larger facility known as the CMU Events Center. The arena is home to the Central Michigan University Chippewas men's and women's basketball, women's gymnastics, women's volleyball, and men's wrestling teams. Amenities The facility features a pair of club rooms, the largest of which is a space with room for 130 Chippewa fans and plush leather- chair seating for 88. It also features a outdoor patio and is available for receptions, meetings and banquet History Ryan Hall/Rose Arena took over as the main hub for Central Michigan's indoor athletic events in 1973 in part of the project to move the athletic events to the south end of campus. Prior to its opening, the main gymnasium was Finch Fieldhouse, itself built in 1951 on South Franklin Street to replace the original Central Hall on Warriner Mall. Previous seating capacity was 5,200. =Toilet Paper tradition= Prior to 1988, fans would throw toilet paper after a CMU men's basketball player made the first basket. It was estimated that 3,000 rolls were used each game, causing a shortage. Fans would even steal paper from the bathrooms. The Mid- American Conference began assessing technical fouls in 1988 for stopping play and putting the players at risk, thus ending the tradition. =Renovation= In 2009–2010, the CMU Events Center underwent a $20 million renovation that included reconfigured seating in the arena, increasing seating capacity to 5,300 from the previous capacity of 5,200. The Daniel P. Rose Center would become McGuirk Arena with the court naming rights to John Kulhavi. The record attendance for McGuirk Arena of 5,412 was set on February 3, 2017, when the Chippewas Men's Basketball Team came back from an 18 point deficit in the second half to defeat their in-state rival, Western Michigan by a score of 86-82.

They originated in Szczecin, and are quite successful on the local and international punk rock scene. The band is widely regarded for making street punk music popular in Poland. Although they used to claim to be apolitical, The Analogs have always been completely committed to anti-fascism and eventually have started referring to themselves as \\"100% leftie\\". They have performed alongside influential ska artist Roy Ellis and recognise the multi-cultural roots of the skinhead subculture. Band history The Analogs live in Tczew, March 2007. The Analogs playing at Przystanek Woodstock, July 2015. Bassist Przemysław Kaczmarek =The beginnings= In the early 1995 three members of a ska band Dr. Cycos came into a rehearsal hall situated in Bronx pub, Szczecin to work on several songs which were supposed to be in a traditional punk rock style. Those people were Marek Adamowicz (guitarist), Ziemowit Pawluk (drummer) and Paweł Czekała (bassist). The band did not have any name at that point. After melody lines for the first few songs had been prepared the band started to look for a vocalist. The first candidate was Tomasz Iwanow, band members' old friend. However, Iwan was unsuccessful as a vocalist and another candidate for this position was Dominik Pyrzyna, an orthodox punk those days, who perfectly fit the vocalist role for the band. =The first album= As the band had completed its line-up the time came to record the debut album entitled Oi! Młodzież. While recording it (in \\"Kakadu\\" studio, Szczecin), the band was simultaneously negotiating with Rock'n'roller productions, especially with its boss - Zdzisław Jodko. Being one of Czekała's longtime friends, Jodko willingly agreed to release the album under Rock'n'roller label. Meanwhile, the band had just been able to give itself a name: The Analogs. The album was recorded at the same time as an album of Dr. Cycos. On the first day both bands recorded music, and the second day was dedicated to vocals and mixing. Just after the recording session had ended and the concert of both groups had been played, Czekała's troubles with justice started. In spring 1996 album had finally been released and was able to get a positive response among local alternative music fans. During Czekała's absence bassist position was held by Szymon Gebel and later by Artur Szmit. =Concert with D.O.A. and anti-Analogs independent press releases= Soon after the first album was released the band started playing numerous concerts, the most famous and controversial being a gig played together with a Canadian punk rock band DOA. It took place in Poznań and was mostly remembered for fights that broke out between the band's supporters and the rest of the audience. From the very beginning of the band's activity, The Analogs stood in strong opposition to anarchist and feminist punks whose ideas were influential on the Polish punk scene of the day. This attitude combined with the DOA concert riots caused many Polish underground media to start an onslaught on the band, mostly counter-productive as calls for boycott significantly contributed to an increase in band's popularity. On the other hand, the band received considerable support from the Garaż (Polish for garage) magazine. =The beginning of an international career= In 1997 three songs by The Analogs (mistakenly described as Analogics on the cover) appeared on the Oi! it's a world invasion compilation released by Bronco Bullfrog Records and Step-1. In December 2003 The Analogs were invited to play at Punk & Disorderly festival in Germany. They were the only Polish band at that festival. They returned to the same festival the next year as well as in 2006. Analogs songs appeared on following international compilations: *Oi! It's a world Invasion (Bronco Bullfrog) - 3 songs *Class Pride World Wide 2 (Insurgence Records) *KOB vs. Mad Butcher (KOB/Mad Buther) *Stay Punk! (Havin' a Laugh Records) =Next records= The release of the second album, titled Street Punk Rulez!, was strongly encouraged by Jodko, surprised by the huge success of the debut album. The band was in poor condition, especially because Czekała was still under arrest, whereas Adamowicz began his interest in numerous other music genres. The album was recorded in the same studio as the previous one, with most of the lyrics written by the imprisoned Czekała. The material was short, the quality bad and many songs were the new versions from the first album. Despite this, the album could certainly be named a success, and some songs reached the level of band's most popular, and are still played live by the band. It was the first Analogs album released on CD. Just after recording of Street Punk Rulez! was complete, Adamowicz left the band. In 1999 Czekała recorded some songs in Kakadu Studio. This recording session was resulted as the promo CD attached to \\"Garaż\\". This magazine's issue included a band's interview, where new members were introduced. The Analogs played in this set until recordings of the third album, Hlaskover Rock. Before the album was released, Grzegorz Król had had an alcohol problem, what affected his performances on stage. As the pressure within the band grew he was forced to leave the group. The place of second guitarist was taken by Artur Szmit, who had previously been exchanging Czekała with bass guitar. Year 2001 began by the concert at the \\"Punk Great Orchestra of Christmas Charity\\" in Kraków. At that time the band managed to take Błażej Halski from Vespa band, who exchanged the second guitarist. The Analogs played a set of concerts in Poland and Germany, together with The Prowlers. As the both bands' alcohol abusing and their alcoholic parties scared boss of the Mad Buther Records, plans of releasing The Analogs record in Germany was abandoned. In fall 2001 a new record Blask Szminki was released. At that time band played their first concert in Prague. =Concerts with the stars= In the beginning of 2002 The Analogs played again at \\"Punk Great Orchestra of Christmas Charity\\", together with Anti-Nowhere League, Los Fastidios, Skarface and Oxymoron. After this gig Dariusz Stefański decided to leave the band. In spring 2002 the band played several concerts in Italy and in summer The Analogs appeared at Antifest in Czech. Jacek Tomczak joined the band as a guitarist. The same year band supported (together with Bulbulators) The Exploited at the concert in Kraków. Due to high costs of tickets this event had small attendance. =The later records= Another studio session (this time in Elvis Van Tomato, Szczecin) resulted with Trucizna album which was promoted later on a set of gigs with Los Fastidios. As a part of tradition The Analogs included few covers on their record: Cock Sparrer's, The 4-Skins' and The Ramones'. In 2003 band appeared at Czech Republic's Antifest, being that time the only band from Poland. In that year three members decided to leave the band for different reasons. Ziemowit Pawluk was not able to share his time between The Analogs and his professional career any more, Błażej Halski had to return to his family town, Kielce, and Dariusz Tkaczyk couldn't deal with the absence of the latter. Some crucial changes followed. Paweł Boguszewski took over drummer position and Piotr Półtorak started playing guitar. The most important change was the come back of Dominik Pyrzyna as a vocalist. In the beginning of 2004, the band released Kroniki Policyjne album which was a long expected one, as it was to be the first album after switching vocalist position back to Dominik. In October and November 2004 The Analogs played as many concerts as never before and in the beginning of 2005 they took a break, preparing to band's 10th anniversary. The only exception were two trips to Italy. =10 years after...= The 10th anniversary took place at the last weekend of April 2005, and lasted for two days. Many guest stars were invited, including: Schizma, Vespa, AEFDE, Komety, PDS, WSC, Zbeer, Wściekły Pies, Anti Dread and many more. In summer 2005, the band took part in two large festivals, one in Germany (\\"Glaubitz\\") and Czech Republic (Antifest). On August 22 the premiere of the next record took place, Talent Zero, as a part of celebrating The Analogs anniversary. The album consisted completely of classic punk rock covers with lyrics translated into Polish. =The Analogs today= In the beginning of 2006 \\"Dmuchacz\\" left the band, and on his place the band chose Kacper Kosiński. While going on Punk & Disorderly festival Kacper unfortunately did not take his ID, so he had to pass the border on a lent one. The record Poza Prawem came out in October 2006. The same year band's cover of one of Dezerter's songs was included on Dezerter's tribute album Nie ma zagrożenia - jest Dezerter. In December 2006 Piotr Półtorak decided to quit the band for \\"personal and family\\" reasons. His position was taken over by Miro, guitarist of bands like Anti Dread and Needle & Pins.

They are small, stocky, yellow to brown flies (3–4 mm). Very few species are known for this family (about 120 species in five genera). Larvae are found in films on rocks and the nonfeeding adults are usually found on foliage along the same streams in which the larvae are found. A few solitary midges are found in the Southern Hemisphere, but Thaumaleidae are generally an Holarctic family. Description Adults are recognised by the seven veins reaching the margin, the costa running around the entire margin, the absence of ocelli, and particularly by the short antennae which are no longer than the head. Wing venation of Thaumaleidae Larvae resemble larval Lutzomyia (Psychodidae), Forcipomyia (Ceratopogonidae), and some Chironomidae. However, unpaired prolegs, a ventrally directed truncate head, and prothoracic spiracles on a short respiratory tube differentiate them. For further information see * Family keys and image Biology Adult Thaumaleidae are encountered infrequently, usually close to the hygropetric aquatic larval habitat. The undersides of bridges over smaller running waters are common adult gathering sites. Thaumaleid larvae are usually hygropetric in vertical, thin water films alongside waterfalls and torrents. They prefer low temperatures and are most frequent in fully shaded localities. They feed by grazing on diatoms. Little or no life history information is available. Name The dipteran family name Orphnephilidae Rondani, 1847, based on Orphnephila Haliday, 1832, was used until Bezzi (1913) synonymized Orphnephila with Thaumalea Ruthe, 1831 and adopted Thaumaleidae, based on the senior synonym Thaumalea. This family name has been almost universally used since that time and it is to be maintained. Had Thaumaleidae not come into prevailing usage, Orphnephilidae would continue in use despite the fact that Orphnephila is a junior synonym. Thaumaleidae is cited with its own author and date, followed by the date of the replaced name in parentheses: Thaumaleidae Bezzi, 1913 (1847). It takes precedence over Orphnephilidae Rondani, 1847, and any subsequently published synonyms. References *Arnaud, P.H. 1977. Thaumaleidae. pp. 283–85. In: Hurlbert, S.H., ed.

The island is now linked by ferry to Lamu and is home to Manda Airport, while Manda Toto island lies to its west. The island is separated from the mainland by the narrow Mkanda channel. Both Manda town and Takwa were probably abandoned due to lack of water in the first half of the 19th century. In the 1960s the Kenya Department of Agriculture recommended building several concrete catchments called jabias to capture rain water on the island. Two jabias were built and many families moved onto the island, farming maize, cassava, simsim and cotton.Martin, 1973, p. 27 Manda town = History = The Manda town ruins (on the Northwest coast of Manda Island), were first explored by the archaeologist Neville Chittick in 1965. The town owes its origins to trade with the Persian Gulf during 9th and 10th centuries . The chief trading commodity was probably elephant ivory. Mbutangrove poles were probably also important. Early inhabitants of Manda constructed buildings with burnt square brick and stone and set with a lime mortar. These building techniques are found only on islands and coastal areas of Kenya. This brick and mortar technology is unique to the previously mentioned areasChittick, 1984, p. 217 whereas the bricks averaging about 18 cm (which \\"match perfectly ...in measure\\") are unique for East Africa for this period, and are likely to have been brought in from Sohar, in modern-day Oman. These bricks probably arrived on Manda Island as ballast in sailing ships entering the port.Chittick, 1984, p. 15 From the mid-9th century to the early 11th century buildings were also constructed from coral known as coral rag cut from dead coral reefs. The large scale excavations in 1966, 1970, and 1978 revealed an prosperity unrivaled in East Africa for the period. Signs of this prosperity include Chinese porcelain dating from the ninth century onward, Islamic pottery and glass, and local pottery dated by the associated imports. .Chittick, 1984, p.11-12 Chittick defines 7 periods for occupation of Manda Island: Mid-9th to early 11th century, Mid-11th to late 13th century, late 13th to 14th century, 15th and early 16th century, Mid-16th to 17th century, and Post-seventeenth century.Chittick, 1984, p.11-12 A striking feature of the town are large sea walls built sometime between the 9th century to the 13th century. The walls parallel the shore and are built from large coral blocks. These walls were likely constructed to reclaim sections of the shoreline. Running parallel with the sea with returns running inland, these walls built from large coral blocks are deduced to have been constructed partly to reclaim sections of the shore, and partly to consolidate the edges of the peninsula. In the July 2013 issue of Archeology it was reported that a Chinese \\"Yongle Tongbao\\" cash coin was found on Manda Island, illustrating the reach of Chinese explorers and traders. The coin was issued during the reign of the Yongle Emperor, Zhu Di which lasted until 1424. At its peak, the town covered some and its population is estimated to have been about 3,500.Martin, 1973, p. 26 Manda prospered until the 13th century when it began to decline. Takwa The Takwa Ruins was a town in the period 1500-1700, and it was designated a Kenyan National Monument in 1982. Manda Airport Manda Airport is the only airport in the Lamu Archipelago.

Clockwise from top: Doctor Eggman, Rouge the Bat, Shadow the Hedgehog, Knuckles the Echidna, Sonic the Hedgehog, Amy Rose, Miles \\"Tails\\" Prower, Cream the Rabbit, a Chao, and Blaze the Cat. Art by Yuji Uekawa. The Sonic the Hedgehog video game franchise began in 1991 with the game Sonic the Hedgehog for the Sega Genesis, which pitted a blue anthropomorphic hedgehog named Sonic against a rotund male human villain named Doctor Eggman (or Doctor Ivo Robotnik). The sequel, Sonic 2, gave Sonic a fox friend named Tails. Sonic CD introduced Amy Rose, a female hedgehog with a persistent crush on Sonic. Sonic 3 introduced Knuckles the Echidna, Sonic's rival and, later, friend. All five of these have remained major characters and appeared in dozens of games. The series has introduced dozens of additional recurring characters over the years. These have ranged from anthropomorphic animal characters like Shadow the Hedgehog and Cream the Rabbit to robots created by Eggman like Metal Sonic and E-123 Omega, as well as human characters like Eggman's grandfather Gerald Robotnik. The series features two fictional species: Chao, which have usually functioned as digital pets and minor gameplay and plot elements, Wisps, which have been used as power-ups. The Sonic games keep a separate continuity from the Sonic the Hedgehog comics published by Archie Comics and other Sonic media and, as a result, feature a distinct yet overlapping array of characters. Characters =Sonic the Hedgehog= trademarked Sonic The Hedgehog, is a blue anthropomorphic hedgehog and the main protagonist of the series. Developed as a replacement for their existing Alex Kidd mascot, as well as Sega's response to Mario, his first appearance was in the arcade game Rad Mobile as a cameo, before making his official debut in Sonic the Hedgehog (1991). Sonic's greatest ability is his running speed, and he is known as the world's fastest hedgehog.Amy's profile from the Sonic Adventure manual Using the power of the seven Chaos Emeralds, he becomes Super Sonic and can achieve even greater speeds. =Doctor Eggman= Sega (1991). Sonic the Hedgehog instruction manual (English version), pp. 4 better known by his alias Sega (1999). Sonic Adventure instruction manual, pp. 31 is a human mad scientist and the main antagonist of the series. Debuting in the first game of the series, Sonic the Hedgehog, he was shown attempting to collect the Chaos Emeralds and turn all of the animals inhabiting the land into robots. He is a self-proclaimed or certifiable genius with an IQ of 300.Sega (2001). Sonic Adventure 2 instruction manual, pp. 9Sega (2004). Sonic Heroes instruction manual, pp. 14 His fondness for mechas has made him a renowned authority on robotics. Ultimately, Eggman's goal is to conquer the world and create his ultimate utopia, Eggmanland, alternatively known as the Eggman Empire and Robotnikland.Sega (2005). Shadow the Hedgehog instruction manual, pp. 8 When Sega had petitioned its research and development department to create a character who would replace Alex Kidd as its company mascot, a caricature of U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt was among the proposed designs. It lost to Sonic the Hedgehog, but the design was kept for the basis for Dr. Eggman instead. =Miles \\"Tails\\" Prower= better known by his nickname is a two-tailed fox who is Sonic's best friend and sidekick. His name is a pun on \\"miles per hour\\". He is able to use his two tails to propel himself into the air like a helicopter for a limited time. Yasushi Yamaguchi, originally the main artist and zone designer for Sega's Sonic Team, designed Tails for an internal competition for a sidekick to Sonic. His first appearance was in Sonic 2 for the Game Gear, where he was kidnapped by Doctor Robotnik for a \\"hefty\\" ransom, and was first made playable in the Genesis version of Sonic the Hedgehog 2. Tails has appeared in almost every Sonic game since his first appearance. Tails starred in two solo spinoff games for the Sega Game Gear in 1995 - Tails' Skypatrol, and Tails Adventure. Frequently portrayed as a sweet-naturedSega (1999). Sonic Adventure instruction manual, pp. 20 and humble fox,Sega (2004). Sonic Heroes instruction manual, pp. 7 Tails used to be picked on because of his twin tails, before he met Sonic. Tails has a very high IQ and excellent mechanical ability. =Amy Rose= is a pink hedgehog and Sonic's self-proclaimed girlfriend. Amy was created by Kazuyuki Hoshino for Sonic the Hedgehog CD (1993), although she appeared Kenji Terada's Sonic the Hedgehog manga a year before. Hoshino created her in-game graphics, with many staff members contributing ideas to her design. Her headband and trainer shoes reflected Sonic CD director Naoto Ohshima's tastes, and her mannerisms reflected the traits Hoshino looked for in women at the time. Her fur color was red at first, and her skirt orange. The character had two other names in game previews: Rosy the Rascal and Princess Sally (a character in the Sonic the Hedgehog TV series and comics). Amy received her present design, with a red dress and boots, in Sonic Adventure (1998), courtesy of designer Yuji Uekawa. In the games, Amy is depicted as driven and competitive. She spends much of her time following Sonic to get his attention or make sure he is safe while demonstrating her affection. Series co-creator Yuji Naka said that Amy was designed \\"to always chase Sonic\\", and has made it her life goal to one day marry him. Alt URL Not possessing the speed or strength of the other characters, Amy uses a hammer to defend herself instead. In Sonic CD, Metal Sonic kidnaps Amy and Sonic must rescue her. When he does, Amy kisses him. Amy's first appearance in a Sonic platformer as a playable character was in Sonic Adventure; she is playable in Sonic Heroes (2003) and Sonic the Hedgehog (2006), and appears as a non-player character in games such as Sonic Unleashed (2008). While some journalists have called Amy cute and powerful, others find her annoying. Justin Towell of GamesRadar+ and writers from Mean Machines expressed general displeasure at her introduction in Sonic CD. Additionally, some have criticized developers' treatment of Amy as a female character and analyzed her implications on gender representation in video games. The Electronic Gaming Monthly staff found her pink coloring and tendency to run from danger to be stereotypical and common in Japanese-created female characters, while feminist blogger Anita Sarkeesian cites Amy as an example of the \\"Ms. Male Character\\" trope, in which female characters in games with male protagonists often resemble those protagonists, but with stereotypically feminine features added. Despite this, Amy is one of the series' most popular characters, coming in fifth place in a Japanese popularity poll in 2006. Her likeness has been used in Sonic merchandise, and she appears in the television adaptations Sonic X (2003–2006) and Sonic Boom (2014–2017). =Metal Sonic= is an evil robotic version of Sonic created by Dr. Robotnik. He first appears in Sonic the Hedgehog CD. He is given orders to go back in time and change the past so that Dr. Eggman can rule the future. Sonic must race him in Stardust Speedway to free Amy Rose. He is severely wounded when he crashes and falls, but is rejuvenated by Robotnik in Sonic the Hedgehog 4: Episode II, only to be defeated again in a similar style. He returns in Knuckles' Chaotix, where he attempts to obtain the Chaos Rings, but he is stopped by the Chaotix. Metal Sonic notably acted as the main antagonist in Sonic Heroes, appearing in a new form as Neo Metal Sonic before transforming into the game's final boss, the Metal Overlord. Upon being defeated by Super Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles, he reverts to his traditional appearance. He appears as the main antagonist in the Sonic the Hedgehog (OVA), where Eggman records Sonic's abilities and uploads them to Metal Sonic, who proceeds in attempting to destroy the world before being tossed into lava by Sonic. Metal Sonic appears as a bonus playable character in Sonic Rivals, reprogrammed to aid Eggman Nega in his attempt to take over the world. He returns as a playable character in Sonic Rivals 2, under orders from Eggman to aid Shadow in stopping Eggman Nega's plans. In Sonic Free Riders, Metal Sonic is a playable character and the final opponent in the game's story mode. In Sonic Generations, he appears in his classic form as a rival boss, battling Classic Sonic in Stardust Speedway before ultimately being destroyed. Metal Sonic returns as a boss character in Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric and Sonic Boom: Shattered Crystal. He appears in the Sonic Boom episode, \\"It Wasn't Me, It Was the One-Armed Hedgehog\\". Metal Sonic appears as a boss in the Sonic story mode of Lego Dimensions. Metal Sonic appeared as a playable character in the multiplayer mode of Sonic Adventure 2: Battle, as well as Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing, Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed, and all the Mario & Sonic titles beginning with Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games. Collecting all the emblems in Sonic Adventure DX: Director's Cut unlocks Metal Sonic as a bonus playable character in Sonic's stages, and purchasing both episodes of Sonic the Hedgehog 4 unlocks bonus levels in which Metal Sonic is playable. He possesses great strength, including a laser cannon, a jet engine and a force field device he can use to protect himself from projectiles and certain attacks. He usually only communicates with a series of electronic noises. The only notable time Metal Sonic was able to talk was in Sonic Heroes in which he was voiced by Jun'ichi Kanemaru in Japanese and Ryan Drummond in English. GameDaily placed Metal Sonic 13th on their \\"Top 25 Video Game Robots\\" list, describing him as Dr. Robotnik's \\"greatest creation\\" and praising the strength of his abilities.Buffa, Chris (2009-02-06). Top 25 Video Game Robots. GameDaily. Retrieved on 2009-02-09 =Knuckles the Echidna= is a red echidna and Sonic's friendly rival. First introduced in the Genesis game Sonic the Hedgehog 3, Knuckles lives on Angel Island, which hovers in the sky due to the power of the Master Emerald. As the last surviving member of the Echidna people who once inhabited the island, his duty is to guard the Master Emerald. During conception of Sonic the Hedgehog 3, the development team wanted to create a new rival for Sonic. The final design of Knuckles was the result of dozens of possible designs inspired by numerous different animals. A character with many different abilities and skills, he is physically one of the strongest characters of the Sonic series. His strength and mastery of martial arts, specialising in punches, enables him to perform feats such as shattering boulders with his fists, while he can trap air underneath his dreadlocks in order to glide for short distances. =Fang the Sniper= initially known as Nack the Weasel in English localizations, is a purple wolf/weasel hybrid (a wolf/jerboa hybrid in Japan) that first appeared in the Game Gear video game Sonic the Hedgehog: Triple Trouble in 1994. His character is a treasure hunter in search of the Chaos Emeralds; however he does not know of their true power and merely wants to sell them for profit. He is a slick, sneaky, and mischievous character who will steal the Emeralds for an easier job. Fang tries hard to outwit others, but is held back by his naivety and often fails. Outside of Triple Trouble, Fang had playable roles in Sonic Drift 2 and Sonic the Fighters in 1995 and 1996, and had been planned to be in the cancelled Sonic Xtreme. He has not had any significant roles since, though he made a cameo appearance on an in-game poster in 2011's Sonic Generations, and as a robot character's illusion in Sonic Mania in 2017. =Chaotix= The Chaotix are a group of four characters who debuted in the game Knuckles' Chaotix as the main characters, later forming their own detective agency in Sonic Heroes. IGN described the characters as \\"charming\\" and noted that they were introduced before fans became weary of all the new characters in the series. Charmy Bee is a bee who is the \\"scatter-brained funny-kid\\" of the Chaotix. He is cheerful, curious, playful, careless, and greatly energetic, often talking about things no one else cares about. Charmy's fooling around makes the rest of the detective agency staff look professional, and he is generally seen as a \\"cute mascot\\". Despite an innocent, good-natured and light-hearted personality, he uses his stinging tail on rare occasions that he gets angry. In addition to being a playable character in Sonic Heroes and Shadow the Hedgehog, he made cameos in all the Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games installments as a referee. Espio the Chameleon is a chameleon who is a ninja warrior. He is described as the \\"opinionated number one\\" of the Chaotix, also being the calmest. He has a \\"militaristic discipline\\" while being quiet and laid back. Confident in his skills, opinionated and self-obsessed, he revels in training and self-discipline. He is not concerned by danger, and often yearns to face it in order to use his ninja skills. With his extensive training in ninjutsu and an ability to turn himself invisible, he is able to move around unnoticed. However, a blunder like a sneeze could cause him to inadvertently become visible. Espio's debut was in the video game Knuckles' Chaotix. In the game, his color subtly changes while he moves to demonstrate the technical capabilities of the Sega 32X console. Espio was incorporated into Sonic Heroes as part of a move to reintroduce neglected characters, and because the development team considered him to have a unique, interesting personality. He was the designated \\"speed\\" character in Sonic Heroes while teammates Vector the Crocodile and Charmy Bee respectively represented \\"power\\" and \\"flight\\". Espio was added to Shadow the Hedgehog and Sonic Rivals 2 to help \\"round out our cast of characters\\", and because designer Takashi Iizuka appreciated the character's \\"stealthy agility\\". Espio appeared as a playable character in the arcade fighting game Sonic the Fighters, and has also appeared in all installments of Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games as the referee in various events. Mighty the Armadillo is a black and red armadillo who debuted in the arcade game SegaSonic the Hedgehog, and later appeared in the 32X game Knuckles' Chaotix. The character is described as a traveler who loves nature and desires to see every place. Mighty hates to see weaknesses in others and detests violence. He prefers to be gentle but undergoes a drastic change and is capable when needed. Mighty's only appearance as part of the Chaotix was in Knuckles Chaotix, and was absent when the rest of the group was reintroduced into the series with Sonic Heroes in 2003. His long period of absence was alluded to in Sonic Generations, in which he is shown on a missing persons poster alongside fellow SegaSonic character Ray the Flying Squirrel. Both Mighty and Ray appeared as playable characters in the Sonic Mania expansion Sonic Mania Plus, as well as appearing in the accompanying web series Sonic Mania Adventures. Vector the Crocodile is a crocodile who is the \\"head honcho\\" and brains of the Chaotix Detective Agency. Divided between being \\"bossy\\" and \\"easy-going\\", his rough speech and outward appearance mask his clear reasoning and ability to resolve cases. For the right price he will take on most jobs, unless they involve doing something immoral. Vector has a strong sense of justice and kindness, despite his argumentativeness. He often does unpaid work due to his charitable nature, leaving the agency constantly short on money. Vector hates having to work for the landlord, but he enjoys singing, and his trademark is a set of headphones. He is physically very strong and his powerful jaws are a formidable weapon. Vector was originally supposed to be in the sound test of the first Sonic the Hedgehog game, but he, along with the feature itself, was removed prior to release. He was part of Team Chaotix in Sonic Heroes and is featured in Shadow the Hedgehog. In all installments of Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games, he is a playable athlete. He is playable in other spinoff titles such as Sonic Free Riders and Team Sonic Racing. =Big the Cat= is a large purple cat who first appeared in the 1998 Dreamcast game Sonic Adventure, where he was placed to justify the presence of a fishing rod in the game, although he was conceived beforehand. Big is a large, purple anthropomorphic cat, who is depicted as—while unintelligent—sweet, easygoing, and physically strong.Sonic Heroes (GameCube) instruction manual, p. 11. In Sonic Adventure, Big's story involves fishing his frog friend, out of various bodies of water after Froggy swallows a Chaos Emerald and part of the tail of Chaos, the game's antagonist. In Sonic Heroes, Big teams up with Amy Rose and Cream the Rabbit to search for Froggy and a lost Chao creature called Chocola. He is a more minor playable character in other Sonic games like Sonic Chronicles: The Dark Brotherhood and Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing and a non-player character in titles such as the Nintendo DS version of Sonic Colors. Reflecting the story of Adventure, Big appears in the Sonic X anime and the Sonic the Hedgehog comics. Big has been derided by the video game press and fanbase for his obesity, low intelligence, one-dimensional development and uselessness within his games; he has appeared on several lists of the worst video game characters of all time and within the Sonic cast. Due to his poor reception and apparent uselessness, Sonic Team claimed they would be retiring the character from appearing in future games in 2012, although head Takashi Iizuka has since stated that a game starring Big is a possibility. Despite this statement, Big has continued to appear in other titles, including Sonic Runners, Lego Dimensions, and Team Sonic Racing. =Chaos= is a Chao mutated by the Chaos Emeralds that acts as a guardian for its species, protects the Master Emerald, and provides clear water around its altar. It is a water-like being that can easily manipulate its body. Without any Chaos Emeralds, it is known as \\"Chaos Zero\\", but with each Emerald it absorbs, it transforms into a more powerful form, eventually becoming \\"Perfect Chaos\\" with all 7 Emeralds. Its first appearance is in Sonic Adventure, where Dr. Eggman attempts to use it to conquer the world. Chaos tracks down the emeralds, becomes \\"Perfect Chaos\\", and floods all of Station Square, but is ultimately defeated by Super Sonic. It reappears in Sonic Adventure 2 as a bonus multiplayer character, in Sonic Battle as a playable fighter, and in Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games as an ice version of Perfect Chaos. He reappears in his perfect form in Sonic Generations as a boss where he has a new look with green teeth and dark blue reptilian skin for the upper half of his body. This was supposed to be how he always looked, but the technology of the Dreamcast at the time made this look impossible.BradyGames Sonic Generations Strategy Guide - page 206 \\"Interview with Sonic Team's Iizuka-san\\" Chaos appears as the final boss in the Sonic the Hedgehog pack of Lego Dimensions. =E-100 Series= The E-100 Series is a group of robots created by Doctor Eggman, who uses them in his quest to conquer the world; However some of their members have since gone rogue.Sonic Adventure (Dreamcast) instruction manual, pp. 26–27. E-100 Alpha better known as Zero, is the first of the E-100 series and considered the prototype of the line. He was created by Dr. Eggman and ordered to capture the Chaos Emerald from Amy Rose's Flicky friend, Birdie. He first appeared in Sonic Adventure as the main antagonist in Amy's story, where he repeatedly tries to capture Birdie. At the end of Amy's story, she destroys him. In Sonic Advance 2, he appears in special stages, trying to prevent players from getting the seven Chaos Emeralds. E-102 Gamma also primarily appears in Sonic Adventure. He is a red, bulky robot with a powerful gun built into his arm. Gamma turns against his master after a heartfelt conversation with Amy Rose, who becomes his friend. He offers shoot-'em-up gameplay to a largely platforming-focused game. Gamma later appears as a playable character in Sonic Battle. He has garnered mixed comments from critics. While Xbox World generally commended his story, others criticized the slow and repetitive nature of his gameplay. E-123 Omega first appears in Sonic Heroes, Eggman seals Omega within an abandoned base, along with Shadow, until Rouge the Bat releases Shadow from his stasis pod, accidentally reactivating Omega. Omega expresses a deep hatred for Eggman due to the latter locking him up in stasis for an extended period of time. Omega decides to team up with the other two in order to obtain revenge on Eggman and prove that he is the most powerful robot of all. He returns with the same goal in Shadow the Hedgehog, and teams up with Shadow in certain levels to destroy Eggman's robots. During Sonic the Hedgehog 2006, he is playable after Rouge orders him to support Shadow many years in the future. He is also one of the secret unlockable characters in Sonic Chronicles: The Dark Brotherhood. He also appeared in the DS version of Sonic Colors where he challenges Sonic to perform a mission, and reveals to Sonic the location of Eggman's base in the Asteroid Coaster world. In Sonic Forces, Omega is severely damaged by Infinite, but is repaired by Tails and becomes a member of the Resistance. Omega has appeared in Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games as a rival in speed skating and intense short track and in Mario & Sonic at the London 2012 Olympic Games as a rival in the 100m Sprint. Omega appears as a playable racer in Team Sonic Racing. Omega has an array of destructive weapons concealed in his arms, including machine guns, flamethrowers, missile launchers, beam cannons and rocket-propelled drills. He can retract his hands in order to attach a spinning Shadow and Rouge in their place, either using the two as melee weapons or firing them. Omega has seen negative reception. Eurogamer staff writer Tom Bramwell called Omega a \\"lesser\\" character among the Heroes cast. An Electronic Gaming Monthly preview of Heroes referred to him as an imitation of the T-1000s from the film Terminator 2: Judgment Day. However, Jeremy Dunham from IGN called Omega a \\"supreme machine\\". =Omochao= () is a robot Chao with a propeller on its head. Omochao was introduced in Sonic Adventure as part of the Chao Races, and it later appeared in Sonic Adventure 2, where it serves as an in-game manual to teach players how to play the game. It has filled a similar tutorial role in other games such as Sonic Heroes, Sonic Advance 3, Sonic Generations, and Lego Dimensions. The character has made other sporadic appearances throughout the series, including as a type of gun in Shadow the Hedgehog, a referee in Sonic Riders, a collectible card and referee in Sonic Rivals 2, a referee in Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games, a supporting character in multiplayer of Sonic and the Secret Rings, and the host of the World Grand Prix in Sonic Free Riders. Its only playable appearance is as one of a group of playable chao in Team Sonic Racing. \\"Omochao\\" is a pun on and \\"chao\\". =Tikal the Echidna= () is an orange echidna, who is the daughter of from the same tribe that Knuckles the Echidna descends, the Knuckles Tribe. She first appears in Sonic Adventure and returns in Sonic Adventure 2. Thousands of years before the main events of the series, she opposes her father's power-hungry ways of invading other countries. She eventually comes into contact with Chaos and a group of Chao at the shrine of the Master Emerald, who accept her due to her friendliness to them. She tries to reason with him about raiding the shrine for the emeralds, but he, hesitated by what she said to him, briefly snaps at her and orders the Knuckles Clan to attack. When the Clan does as it is told, they ran over Tikal and the Chao, which angers Chaos, as he punishes Pachacamac and the Knuckles Clan for what they did to Tikal and the Chao, by destroying them, absorbing the negative power of the emeralds. After that, Tikal tells the Master Emerald to stop Chaos, as it seals her inside itself. Several thousand years later, Doctor Eggman shatters the Master Emerald and awakens the angry Chaos and Tikal's spirit. Tikal helps the main characters defeat Chaos and then leaves with it. Tikal appears in Sonic Advance and Sonic Advance 2 in a Chao minigame, and makes a cameo appearance on the Angel Island board of Sonic Pinball Party. In both Sonic Rivals and Sonic Rivals 2, she appears on a variety of collectible cards. In Mario & Sonic at the London 2012 Olympic Games and Mario & Sonic at the Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter Games, she appears as an unlockable Mii costume. In Super Smash Bros. Brawl, she is a collectable sticker. Tikal appears as a playable character in Sonic Runners. =Shadow the Hedgehog= is an artificially created life form in the design of a black and red male hedgehog, similar to Sonic. His trademark hover skates propel him at extreme speeds that rival those of Sonic. According to official profiles, Shadow was created 50 years ago by Professor Gerald Robotnik as the \\"Ultimate Life Form\\", which is ageless and immortal. Sharp witted and seemingly always on the edge, once he has set himself to a goal, he will do whatever it takes to accomplish it, regardless of any danger. After the trauma of the death of his only friend, Maria Robotnik, Shadow strives to fulfill his purpose and keep the promise he made to her. Although his relationship with Sonic seems to have developed from antagonistic to friendly rivalry, animosity from not understanding their different mindsets still occurs. However, Shadow shares a lot of similarities with Sonic. He can perform spin attacks common to Sonic, which are a variation on the tendency for hedgehogs to roll into tight balls for protection. Additionally, with the power of a Chaos Emerald, Shadow can warp time and space with Chaos Control. Shadow is also able to use a variety of other Chaos powers, such as \\"Chaos Spear\\" and \\"Chaos Blast\\". Using the power of the seven Chaos Emeralds, Shadow uses his super transformation to transform into Super Shadow and bestows new abilities of flight and near invulnerability, with normal abilities of speed and enhanced Chaos powers. =Professor Gerald Robotnik= is the grandfather of Maria Robotnik and Dr. Ivo \\"Eggman\\" Robotnik. Fifty years before the main series, he attempted to create the \\"Ultimate Life Form\\" under the funding of the United Federation, hoping that it can help cure Maria's illness. He appears in Sonic Adventure 2 and Shadow the Hedgehog. =Maria Robotnik= is a character that appears mostly in flashbacks in Sonic Adventure 2 and Shadow the Hedgehog. She is the granddaughter of Professor Gerald Robotnik, and is the cousin of Dr. Ivo \\"Eggman\\" Robotnik. Maria suffers from the illness known as \\"NIDS\\" (Neuro- Immuno Deficiency Syndrome), which was incurable at the time. Gerald takes on Project Shadow in order to save her life. Soon after Shadow is created, the two bond deeply, though it is short-lived as the government organization \\"G.U.N.\\" soon raids the ARK, fatally shooting Maria. Before she dies, she encases Shadow in an escape pod and asks him to bring hope to humanity and give humans a chance to be happy. This experience with Maria scars Shadow for life, but ultimately his determination to keep his promise to her leads him to team up with Sonic and save the Earth multiple times. Maria's first, and only, playable appearance is in Shadow the Hedgehog, where she can be controlled as a partner character by a second player during specific in-game missions. =Rouge the Bat= is a white, anthropomorphic bat who made her first appearance in Sonic Adventure 2 in 2001, and who has been featured in several games since. She is depicted as a professional treasure hunter devoted to the pursuit of jewels,Sega (2004). Sonic Heroes instruction manual, pp. 9 calling herself the \\"World's Greatest Treasure Hunter\\". She has a tendency to ignore abstract morality or manners for potential profit; her \\"feminine charm\\" makes her appear careless, but she is actually scheming and manipulative. Additionally, she serves as a part-time spy for the government. She fights using kicks, especially her signature \\"Screw Kick,\\" and she can fly using her wings. =Cream the Rabbit and Cheese= is a peach-colored rabbit with a constant companion named a blue Chao with a red bow-tie. Their names were based on \\"cream cheese\\". Cream is portrayed as being naive because of being brought up like a princess by her mother, Vanilla. She always politely minds her manners but sometimes acts childishly. Cream can achieve flight for short periods of time by flapping her two large ears, while Cheese often attacks on Cream's behalf by ramming into her adversaries. Cream first appeared as a playable character in Sonic Advance 2. She returned in Sonic Heroes as part of \\"Team Rose\\", working together with Amy Rose and Big the Cat to defeat Metal Sonic, and then again for Sonic Advance 3. Since her first trio of games, she has been relegated to being an extra playable character in Sonic spinoffs and multiplayer games. She is a playable character in the Sonic and the Secret Rings multiplayer mode, a playable fighter within Sonic Battle, a secret unlockable party member in Sonic Chronicles: The Dark Brotherhood and a playable racer in Sonic Riders, Sonic Riders: Zero Gravity, and Sonic Free Riders. Cream has received mostly negative opinions from the video game press. Thomas East of Official Nintendo Magazine ranked her as the fifth worst Sonic character, criticizing various aspects of her like her high-pitched voice, repetitious speech in Sonic Heroes, \\"ridiculous smile\\", and single eyelash on each eye. Christian Nutt of GameSpy singled her out as one of the negative features of Sonic Advance 2, calling her \\"corny\\" and \\"dopey-looking\\". GamesRadar writer Jim Sterling ranked her as his second worst, stating that she \\"represents perhaps everything that's wrong with Sonic the Hedgehog characters\\", particularly finding her name to be random. Similarly, Tom Bramwell of Eurogamer exclaimed \\"oh God\\" at her and Cheese's names. David Houghton of GamesRadar ranked her name as one of the 25 worst among all video game characters, seeing a double entendre in the word \\"cream\\". In contrast, Xbox Worlds review of Heroes stated that \\"we love Cream\\" and called her \\"the best new Sonic character since Tails.\\" =G.U.N. Commander= The is the leader of the Guardian Units of Nations (G.U.N.), a major military organization in the Sonic universe. His childhood took place aboard the ARK, a massive space station that was first explored in Sonic Adventure 2, although he did not appear in that game. While there, he befriended Maria Robotnik and witnessed the creation of Shadow. His family was killed when G.U.N. attacked the ARK, and he began to harbor a deep resentment towards Shadow as a result, though he would later join the organization. He appears throughout Shadow the Hedgehog as an antagonist; he tries to kill Shadow at first, though in one of the game's branching pathways, he realizes that Shadow has no memories of the incident and lets him go. Dialogue from levels in this game indicates that he has at least one child and one grandchild. The Commander also appears in Sonic Chronicles: The Dark Brotherhood, where he allies with the game's playable characters against the Marauders, an antagonistic nation. =Blaze the Cat= is a purple cat princess from an alternate dimension. She has been appointed as guardian of the Sol Emeralds, her dimension's version of the Chaos Emeralds, making her role similar to that of Knuckles the Echidna. She is portrayed as calm and levelheaded, hiding her true feelings. She is sometimes \\"bogged down\\" by her own strict discipline and devotion to her position, making her appear withdrawn. Blaze can control fire, but wears a cape to conceal it as she was teased about her pyrokinetic abilities when she was young. Using the Sol Emeralds, she transforms into Burning Blaze. Blaze wears a purple dress and white tights with pink high heels and a yellow necklace. Blaze debuted in Sonic Rush as a playable character along with Sonic.Sonic Rush She arrives in Sonic's dimension from another dimension along with the Sol Emeralds. While searching for the Emeralds, she befriends Sonic and Cream and helps them stop Dr. Eggman and Eggman Nega before returning to her dimension. She reappears in Sonic the Hedgehog as Silver the Hedgehog's friend during the future of Sonic's dimension. The two attempt to fix their ruined future world by traveling back in time. Blaze ends up sacrificing her life to seal Iblis, the fiery monster that has destroyed their world, inside herself, but is brought back to life at the end of the game when Sonic destroyed Iblis in his own time period. She appeared again as the main character in Sonic Rush Adventure, where Sonic and Tails are transported to her dimension and help her retrieve the \\"Jeweled Scepter\\". Since her first trio of games, she has been relegated to being an extra playable character in Sonic spinoffs and multiplayer games. She is an unlockable multiplayer character in the Sonic and the Secret Rings and Sonic and the Black Knight, a playable racer in Sonic Riders: Zero Gravity, Sonic Free Riders and Team Sonic Racing, and a playable athlete in all five Mario and Sonic at the Olympics games. She appears together with Silver in Sonic Colors DS in several cutscenes and missions. Blaze has been mostly well-received by critics. IGN remarked upon seeing her at TGS 2005 that she \\"easily earned her place in the team\\" amidst unremarkable secondary characters. Her gameplay has been praised as \\"fast-moving and fun\\" as opposed to slower characters introduced earlier in the series, but criticized for its resemblance to that of Sonic. Blaze has been called \\"a nice addition to Sonic's cast\\" and \\"one of the more complex, multifaceted characters in the Sonic canon\\". =Eggman Nega= is Eggman's descendant from 200 years in the future, first introduced in Sonic Rush as the arch-enemy of Blaze the Cat and later Silver the Hedgehog. He is known to cause trouble not only through time travel, but through inter-dimensional travel as well. Although his outward appearance resembles that of Doctor Eggman, his personality is different. He is heartless and calculating, but maintains polite speech and manners. His exact role in the overall series varies; in the Sonic Rush series, he works alongside the original Eggman as a team, while in the Sonic Rivals series, he tends to use the fact that he resembles Eggman to his advantage, letting Eggman take the heat for his actions. =Babylon Rogues= The Babylon Rogues are a group of avian thieves. They have only appeared collectively in the three racing games Sonic Riders, Sonic Riders: Zero Gravity and Sonic Free Riders. Producer Takashi Yuda considered them best-suited for Sonic series racing games, and noted in a 2006 interview that Sonic characters are usually designed with one specific storyline in mind. The Rogues have received predominantly negative comments from gaming journalists. Alex Navarro and Joe Dodson of GameSpot separately criticized their clichéd backstory, as did Eurogamer's Tom Bramwell. IGN's Jack DeVries specifically called Jet a \\"jerk\\" and stated that his voice is annoying, especially in Free Riders. Jet the Hawk is a green hawk and the leader of the Babylon Rogues, and nicknamed the \\"Legendary Wind Master\\" due to his mastery of Extreme Gear. This mastery comes from his forefathers. His skills make him a possible match to Sonic the Hedgehog, whom he considers a rival. Jet is aware of his duties as leader but must sometimes be helped by his team. Filled with extreme pride, the thing he likes most other than treasure is himself. He despises losing and those who are faster or more confident than him and fights using Bashyo Fans. Wave the Swallow is a purple swallow who is the team's mechanic, as her father was for the previous generation of the Babylon Rogues. Gifted in this craft, she has a superb mechanical knowledge of Extreme Gear, which surpasses both Miles \\"Tails\\" Prower and Dr. Eggman. Because of this knowledge, she is full of confidence. She hates thick-headed or stupid people and notices everything, but her advice tends to be understandable only to her. Although she looks on Jet the Hawk as an \\"unreliable younger brother\\" and can be stubborn, she follows his leadership. Storm the Albatross is a hulking albatross who is described as the muscle of the Babylon Rogues and Jet the Hawk's \\"right hand man.\\" The strength of his loyalty to Jet is greater than any other and he hates rivals to the team. When he is angry, he becomes destructive; and the raw power of his physical strength makes up for his lower intelligence and lack of speed. With his quick temper, he may stutter when flustered, and he hates having to wait. =Silver the Hedgehog= is a silver-furred hedgehog from 200 years in the future of the main timeline. He first appeared in the 2006 Sonic the Hedgehog. His individual episode revolves around him traveling back in time with Blaze the Cat to find and slay Sonic the Hedgehog, who they believe is the cause of their world being destroyed in the future. Silver's primary ability is telekinesis; he is able to levitate objects and use them as projectiles to either defeat enemies, or interact with his environment. Like Sonic and Shadow, he transforms into \\"super form\\" by using the power of the seven Chaos Emeralds. Silver's creation was inspired by the game's early development stages, where the development team was making huge levels with multiple paths through them, and decided they wanted to include a new character with unique abilities for an alternate way to play through the levels. The design team developed over fifty different concepts for the character. At one point he was to actually be an orange mink named Venice (named after the city of the same name), but the developers ultimately decided against this, fearing a mink would not blend in with the rest of the characters. They ended up deciding to make another hedgehog instead. Orange was originally decided for his fur, but they soon moved away from that in color, in favor to a white-gray one. While developing the character models and textures, they focused on using the hardware to develop the textures rather than just use white-gray, which lead to Silver's color and name. Additionally, Silver's backstory was inspired by Trunks from the 1984 manga Dragon Ball, who made a similar journey to the past to kill two androids that would eradicate most of humanity in his own time; the script for Sonic the Hedgehog (2006) flat-out states \\"Essentially, think Trunks from Dragon Ball Z.\\" Since his first appearance in Sonic the Hedgehog (2006), he has mainly appeared in the Sonic series' spinoffs, multiplayer games, and small cameo roles. He is one of the playable characters in Sonic Rivals and Sonic Rivals 2, a playable character strictly in the multiplayer modes in Sonic and the Secret Rings and Sonic and the Black Knight, a playable racer in Sonic Riders: Zero Gravity,Sonic Riders: Zero Gravity - Shift into Zero Gravity! Sonic Free Riders and Team Sonic Racing, and a playable athlete in the Mario & Sonic series beginning with Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games. He appears in Sonic Generations as a boss in the stages Crisis City (console version) and Tropical Resort (3DS version). Additionally, Silver was one of a few Sega characters to make a cameo in Super Smash Bros. Brawl, in the background of Sonic's Green Hill Zone stage, and as a trophy and sticker. The character has generally not been very well-received by critics. =Orbot and Cubot= () is a red robotic assistant of Dr. Eggman who first appears in Sonic Unleashed. While he generally assists in monitoring Eggman's data, he often makes sarcastic remarks pointing out general flaws in Eggman's plans, prompting a quick smack in return. He appears again in Sonic Colors, alongside a similar yellow robot named (). Conversely to Orbot, Cubot is rather slow, not witty, and suffers from a defect in Sonic Colors that causes him to randomly speak with different accents. The two have continued to appear as assistants to Dr. Eggman in subsequent titles, such as Sonic Generations, Sonic Lost World and Sonic Forces. The duo made a cameo in Mario & Sonic at the London 2012 Olympic Games as one of the helping characters in the London Party, copying stickers for the participants. The duo appeared in Mario & Sonic at the Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter Games as the hosts of the Action and Answer Tour and in the Sonic Boom animated series. Digital Spy praised their inclusion in the plot of Sonic Colors, especially Cubot for his humorous observations and self-awareness about the game's tropes. =Wisps= The initial set of Wisps introduced in Sonic Colors are a race of extraterrestrial creatures who live on a grassy, lush planet called Planet Wisp. The mother of all Wisps is a much larger, pink one named Mother Wisp. She created Planet Wisp and raised all of her children. Wisps speak a common language that Sonic and Tails cannot understand, though Tails builds a translation device in the game Sonic Colors. Their Japanese and English name comes from Tails' translation of a word in their language; other characters in the game refer to them as \\"aliens\\". Wisps are composed of an energy force called \\"Hyper-go-ons\\", which they can use to phase into the body of playable protagonist Sonic and give him temporary elemental powers. They come in numerous breeds, each carrying one of many elemental powers known as \\"Color Powers\\". When Sonic collects a Wisp, he can use its power once at will; however, he can only carry one at a time. There are numerous types of Wisps, each with its own special ability. Colors introduced ten types between the Wii and Nintendo DS versions of the game; some only appear in one version. For example, Purple Wisps, whose \\"Frenzy\\" ability turns Sonic into a difficult-to-control demon that can chomp through obstacles, is exclusive to the Wii version, but Violet Wisps, which scale up Sonic's density to black hole-like levels and causes him to absorb enemies, obstacles, and rings, appear only in the DS version. However, others appear in both versions, such as Yellow Wisps, which allow Sonic to drill underground and find otherwise inaccessible areas. Lost World introduced more types of Wisps while keeping some old types. Among these are Magenta Wisps, which bounce Sonic across paths of musical notes by having the player tap them on the Wii U's touch screen, and Black Wisps, which turn Sonic into a bomb that can roll over enemies and explode. The Colors manual describes each type of Wisp as having a different general personality; for example, Cyan Wisps, which allow Sonic to bounce off surfaces, are scatterbrained and energetic, while Orange Wisps, which blast him rapidly into the air, have fluctuating and explosive emotions.Sonic Colors (Wii) instruction manual , pp. 11–13. In Sonic Colors, Eggman builds an amusement park spanning the Wisps' planets under the pretense of making up for past transgressions. Suspicious, Sonic and Tails investigate and rescue two Wisps from Orbot and Cubot. One of them, a talkative male White Wisp named Yacker, tags along with Sonic and Tails during the game. It turns out that Eggman is converting Wisps to a corrupted, purple (Wii version) or violet (DS version) state to fuel a mind control ray and control the universe. Sonic frees Wisps from their confines in each level, then uses several of them to defeat Eggman at the end of the game. However, Eggman's mind control cannon malfunctions and creates a black hole, which sucks Sonic in until the Wisps combine their power to pull him out and neutralize the black hole. Yacker frees the remaining Wisps, reverts them from their corrupted form, thanks Sonic and Tails, and leaves. The DS version features Mother Wisp as a post-game boss, as she was corrupted by the corrupted Wisps' Hyper-go-ons. Wisps have also appeared in the level \\"Planet Wisp\\" in Sonic Generations and the comics. Iizuka stated in an interview that the Wisps were added to Colors to \\"expand and strengthen the platform action gameplay\\" without forcing the player to switch to other playable characters. Another goal was to encourage players to revisit already-played levels; Sonic Team accomplished this by adding segments requiring certain types of Wisps to levels preceding their first appearances. Iizuka has said that he now considers them a staple in the Sonic series. Critics have given mixed opinions toward Wisps and their integration into Sonic gameplay. IGN's Arthur Gies called them \\"the big addition\\" to Sonic Colors, outshining its polished physics and controls. Dave McComb of film magazine Empire called them \\"cutesy\\" and \\"strange\\", while John Meyer of Wired found them \\"cuddly\\" and Dale North of Destructoid called them \\"a cute little alien race\\". Randy Nelson from Joystiq called them \\"plush\\" and speculated that they could easily lend their image to profitable merchandise. Positive attention has been directed at the variety of Wisps available in Sonic Colors and Lost World and at the variety of gameplay styles they brought to the titles: for example, Gies stated that \\"almost all of them add interesting quirks to Sonic's basic abilities.\\" Reviewing the Nintendo DS version of Colors, Tim Turi from Game Informer stated that \\"each adds an interesting new gameplay mechanic\\" to the game. Gies and Turi also praised the ability to revisit old levels with Wisps unlocked afterwards. Nintendo Powers Steve Thomason identified them as \\"a truly interesting addition to the Sonic formula\\" amidst a series of missteps, and praised their \\"cleverly designed\\" variety. Computer and Video Games writer Chris Scullion described Wisps in Lost World as \\"familiar power-ups that emulate mechanics in Mario's Wii adventures\\" as part of a larger, ambivalent point about the game being derivative of Super Mario Galaxy. However, control and pacing aspects of the Wisps in general, as well as of individual types, have been criticized: for example, Turi opined that \\"for almost every useful ability there is a complete dud\\" and bemoaned the Wii controls. Justin Speer from GameTrailers thought similarly and added that the Wisps \\"don't really feel like they belong\\". Hardcore Gamer Magazines review of Lost World stated that none of the Wisps make satisfying use of the Wii U's gamepad. Chris Shilling of Eurogamer found them to \\"lead to clumsy touchscreen or gyro interludes that kill a level's pacing.\\" =Sticks the Badger= is an orange and brown badger, first introduced in the animated Sonic Boom television series. Her characteristics are wild, energetic and paranoid, having lived in the wilderness alone for most of her life. Nonetheless, she is portrayed as wanting to strengthen her newfound friendship with Sonic, Amy, Tails and Knuckles. Sticks appears in a non-playable role in Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric and as a playable character in Sonic Boom: Shattered Crystal. She is described as \\"infantile\\" by Scott Thompson of IGN and an \\"unlikeable idiot\\" by Becky Cunningham of GamesRadar, albeit a \\"nice addition\\" by Chris Carter of Destructoid. Sticks has appeared in other Sonic Boom titles, including Sonic Dash 2: Sonic Boom and Sonic Boom: Fire & Ice, and has appeared in other Sonic titles not associated with the Boom sub-series, such as Sonic Runners and Mario & Sonic at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games.

It is the most commonly encountered member of the genus Blissus, which are all known as chinch bugs. A closely related species is Blissus insularis, the southern chinch bug. The name of the chinch bug is derived from the Spanish word '. The word ' is also used for the bed bug, and is derived from the Latin word cimex of the same meaning. These bugs tend to gather on sunny open patches of turfgrass. Due to their small size, chinch bugs are hardly noticeable. Therefore, they become problems since they are considered pests that feed on stems of turfgrass and grain crops. Identification Blissus leucopterus are approximately long when fully developed. The adults' bodies vary in colour from dark red to brown with white wings and red legs. Young nymphs are usually bright red and half the size of adults. A distinguishable feature is the white band found on the nymph's abdomen. This band will be covered with wings and changes colour to black during development. Chinch bug on flower, by Rego Korosi Distribution Blissus leucopterus are native to the Americas. They are found throughout the US, southern Canada, Mexico, and Central Americas.Metcalf, C. L., & W. P. Flint (1962). Destructive and Useful Insects (4th ed.). United States of America: McGraw-Hill Book Company. Diet Blissus leucopterus feed on plants, both wild and cultivated, belonging to the grass family, such as wheat, rye, barley, oats, and corn. They suck the sap out of the growing plants. When the plants ripen or become dry, they travel to other growing plants to feed. Life cycle The lifespan of the Blissus leucopterus is a typically less than one year. The eggs of two generations are laid down from spring to summer, when they develop into adults. During the fall, the adults from the first generation die off, while the adults from the second generation retreat from the crops to look for overwinter shelters. The adults overwinter in any type of shelters they can find, including in hedgerows, road sides, bushy fence rows, edges of woodlands, and soybean stubble, under tree barks and bunch grass, and inside field mice nests. Once they emerge from their hibernation, they return to the crop fields to feast and breed before their death. Blissus leucopterus prefers hot, dry, and sunny conditions, while moist, warm, and humid conditions are detrimental for their population; these conditions promote the growth of fungus which is fatal to them. Other elements that reduce their population is heavy rains. Developing nymphs that are hit with rain become trapped in the soils, killing them. Their natural predators include the big-eye bug (Geocoris bullatis), and the tiny wasp (Eumicrosoma beneficum), which feast on or parasitize them. =Time line= *December – March: Blissus leucopterus are in hibernation. *March – April: Daytime temperature stays above 20 °C for a few hours. The Blissus leucopterus emerge from hibernation and begin mating. *April – May: The adults fly to fields with small grains growing (such as wheat) and start sucking the sap out of them. They continue to mate while the females begin laying eggs on the lower leaves of plants, or on the roots. They will continue to do so for the next 30 days, laying a total of around 200 eggs. *June: The nymphs develop for the next 30 days until they mature into adults. They’re wingless, reddish in color, and will progressively become darker with each moult until they’ve reached their adult stage with their wings fully developed. The nymphs also feed on the same growing plant until they start to ripen. This causes the population to seek out other growing crops (such as corn). *July - October: The population of chinch bugs feast and breed on the new growing plant (such as corn), giving birth to a 2nd generation. They continue to feed on the crops, and the 2nd generation of chinch bugs become fully mature. *November: The chinch bugs retreat from the crops to look for shelter for overwinter. Human impact The chinch bug, a native to the United States and common in midwestern states, has had a great effect on agriculture. The chinch bug naturally feeds on wild prairie grasses. As the midwestern states were settled in the nineteenth century and crops of wheat, corn, sorghum and other grains were planted, they adapted well to these new species as habitat and food species. Throughout the 20th century, the chinch bug was a major pest to farmers, as it quickly decimated corn or wheat fields. To deal with this problem, many farmers in the area changed their crops to soybeans, which were not a host to the chinch bug. This led to a huge decrease in the chinch bug population in this area. Today they are mostly a common lawn pest and are commonly treated with pesticides and pest-resistant grasses.

The Finland-Russia border is a controlled border, routinely patrolled and protected by a border zone enforced by the Border Guard. Borders to Norway and Sweden are open borders, but the Border Guard maintains personnel in the area owing to its search and rescue (SAR) duties. There are two coast guard districts for patrolling maritime borders. The Border Guard has also detachments posted at ports and airports. In peacetime, the Border Guard trains special forces and light infantry and can be incorporated fully or in part into the Finnish Defence Forces when required by defence readiness. The Border Guard has police and investigative powers in immigration matters and can independently investigate immigration violations. The Border Guard has search and rescue (SAR) duties, both maritime and inland.

In France, it is commonly known as \\"les douanes\\", which means customs (\\"la douane\\" is a border checkpoint). Agents are referred to as \\"douaniers\\", which means customs officers. In the French legal standards, the prosecution carries the burden of proof since the defendant is presumed innocent ; but in customs procedures, the defendant carries the burden of proof. French Border Police, Police aux frontières or PAF (former Police de l'air et des frontières), also have to monitor the borders and conduct checks in some parts. =Germany= In Germany, the Federal Police, a civilian agency subordinated to the Ministry of Interior, is - besides other duties - responsible for border control tasks. Until 2005, the Federal Police was called Federal Border Guard, and originally was a paramilitary organisation having mandatory service in the 1970s, but had its military rank structure changed into a civilian one in the 1970s and lost its wartime combatant status in the 1990s.

Hong Kong Police Force officers patrol the border with mainland China, but they are not border guards at entry points. Prior to 1995, this role was performed by British Army units stationed in Hong Kong. Various police checkpoint booths (boundary crossing) are found along roads and are in the outside Closed Areas. Manned by uniformed Hong Kong Police officers, vehicle occupants must present papers and/or permits in order to proceed to the border. These officers act as informal border guards, which do not exist in Hong Kong as there is no international boundary with mainland China. All three border agencies are responsibilities of the Security Bureau. =Hungary= In Hungary border control belongs to police since 2007. There is no different organization for this role. Policemen serving on the border have the very same uniform as those inside the country. =Kyrgyzstan= The Frontier Forces are responsible for the border security of Kyrgyzstan.

Established on December 1, 1965, it is a component of the paramilitary forces of India (PMF) and its primary role is to guard India's international borders during peacetime and also prevent transnational crime. Like most paramilitary units of India, the BSF is under the administrative control of the Ministry of Home Affairs and is headed by an Indian Police Service Officer. It is one of the many law enforcement agencies of India. The Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) is an Indian paramilitary force conceived on October 24, 1962 for security along the India's border with the Tibet Autonomous Region of China, border covering 2115 kilometers.

In Italy the border police service is covered by the Guardia di Finanza, part of the Italian Army but under the operational control of the Finance Minister for its law enforcement duties; but there is also the Italian Customs Agency, a civilian administration that have the role of Customs Authority. Mostly, the Guardia di Finanza (or Fiamme Gialle) fight against smuggling, illegal drug trafficking, tax evasion and other financial crimes, even jointly to the Customs Agency. Also, many border posts are staffed by Carabinieri. The Immigration and Border Police also performs border police duties. = Latvia = In Latvia the State Border Guard is in charge of protecting the border of the country. The armed organization is subordinate to the Ministry of the Interior. =Lithuania= The State Border Guard Service is the organisation charged with controlling and maintaining the Lithuanian Border. The State Border Guard Service falls under authority of the Ministry of the Interior, which supervises and controls the implementation of border guard policy. =Macau= Border patrol and immigration control in Macau are conducted by Public Security Police Force of Macau at land entries (4) with China and at Macau International Airport. Customs duties are performed by Macau Customs agency. Both border guards and customs officers are responsibilities of the Secretariat for Security. =Malaysia= The Border Security Agency is part of the Malaysian government agency that was recently established in 2015 to guard the country’s entry and exit points from illegal activities such as smuggling, illegal migration and human trafficking. Before the establishment of the agency, Malaysian borders was guarded by the Malaysian Armed Forces and Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency. =Netherlands= The Royal Marechaussee is the fourth organization within the Armed Forces, besides Army, Navy and Air Force. Besides patrolling the border it also has the function of Military Police and protects the Royal Family. =North Korea= Border Security Command and Coastal Security Bureau are collectively responsible for restricting unauthorized cross-border (land and sea) entries and exits, in the early 1990s the bureaus responsible for border security and coastal security were transferred from the State Security Department to the Ministry of People's Armed Forces. Sometime thereafter, the Border Security Bureau was enlarged to corps level and renamed the Border Security Command. Previously headquartered in Chagang Province, the Border Security Command was relocated to P’yŏngyang in 2002. =Pakistan= Two Pakistan Rangers soldiers at Wagah border. The Frontier Corps (FC) () is a federal paramilitary force recruited mostly by people from the tribal areas and led by officers from the Pakistan Army. The FC is stationed in the Khyber- Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan Province, are known as FC NWFP and FC Balochistan, respectively. Both distinct provincial groups are run traditionally by an \\"inspector general\\" who is a regular Pakistani Army officer of at least major- general rank, although the force itself is part of the Interior Ministry, not the army. Abbas, Hassan, \\"Transforming Pakistan's Frontier Corps\\", article in Terrorism Monitor, Volume 5, Issue 6, a publication of the Jamestown Foundation, March 29, 2007, accessed November 7, 2007 The Pakistan Rangers are a paramilitary force under the control of the Ministry of the Interior of the Pakistani government. In 1995 the Pakistan Rangers divided into two parts; the Pakistan Rangers Punjab headquartered in Lahore and the Pakistan Rangers Sindh headquartered in Karachi. The two divisions have different uniforms and chains of command. =Russia= A border guard outpost in Dagestan, Russia The Border Guard Service of Russia is (since 2003) an agency of the Federal Security Service. The agency considers itself a direct successor of the Soviet Border Troops, and regularly celebrates the anniversary of the founding of the latter (May 28, 1918). This annual event, known as the Border Guards Day, is celebrated every year by the guards in active service as well as former servicemen in Moscow and throughout the country. Future world champion and Olympic sport shooter Boris Polak served as a border guard in the Red Army on a mountain top near China, attaining the rank of colonel. =Singapore= As an island, Singapore is surrounded by water and does not share land borders with other countries. Hence, border security is the responsibility of the Police Coast Guard, a specialised division of the Singapore Police Force that monitors and enforces its maritime borders. =Spain= In Spain, the paramilitary Guardia Civil is responsible for protecting the borders. There is also a specialized service of the Department of Customs and Special Taxes, the Servicio de Vigilancia Aduanera, that has some general border guard duties. =Tajikistan= The Border Troops of Tajikistan, also called the Border Service, are part of the Military of Tajikistan and answer to the Interior Ministry. They often train with the Afghan Border Police, and jointly trained with the military of Kyrgyzstan in 2011. =Thailand= The Border Patrol Police is Thailand's police force responsible for border security and counter- insurgency, and operates as the law-enforcement arm in conjunction with Thahan Phran, the ranger paramilitary arm of the Royal Thai Army. =United Kingdom= Border guard services are provided by the Border Force. The agency is responsible for visa controls, passport checks and customs enforcement at ports of entry into the UK, criminal cases. The UK's only land border, that with the Republic of Ireland, is not regularly patrolled by the UKBA, but is the responsibility of the Police Service of Northern Ireland. =United States= Border Patrol Agents with a Hummer and Astar patrol for illegal entry into U.S. In the United States, border control is the responsibility of the Department of Homeland Security. This jurisdictional authority is shared by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (the primary inspection and enforcement component), the U.S. Coast Guard (the primary interdiction components) and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (the investigative component). U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is composed of three distinct enforcement arms: the Office of Border Patrol (OBP, otherwise known as the United States Border Patrol), the Office of Field Operations (OFO; commonly called by its former name 'Customs') and the Office of Air and Marine (OAM). OBP is tasked with securing the international border in-between the Ports of Entry (POE) and is a mobile enforcement agency that is structured and employed like any other uniformed police department in the United States. OFO is the federal law enforcement branch tasked with administering the POE's (air, land or sea) and is responsible for determining the admissibility of all persons and goods into the United States. The OAM operates all aircraft and watercraft for CBP and coordinates their interdiction efforts with either OBP, U.S. Coast Guard and/or with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The U.S. Coast Guard is the only branch of military in the United States that is not subject to the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878. The reason being that both commissioned and petty officers are considered law enforcement officers with limited customs authority pursuant to 19 USC 1401.United States Coast Guard U.S. Coast Guard has jurisdiction in both domestic and international waters. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has the same authority as both U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the U.S. Coast Guard, with the added jurisdiction of investigating violations that occur at both the border and the interior of the United States. =Vietnam= Vietnam Border Defence Force (Biên phòng Việt Nam) is a branch of Vietnam People's Army and is under command of Ministry of Defence (Vietnam). It has important roles in protecting Vietnam's sovereignty, maintaining security at land and sea borders. Vietnam Border Defence Force is established on 3 March 1959. It is organised into three levels: National Command, Provincial Command, and Local Post.

The battle ended with Austrian victory and influenced the politics of central Europe: Franz Joseph I announced the March Constitution of Austria on 4 March 1849. Prelude = Dembiński, the Polish supreme commander= László Teleki sent Henryk Dembiński, the Supreme Commander of the Polish November uprising, from Paris to the Kingdom of Hungary. Lajos Kossuth knew Dembiński well after his Lithuanian retreat. =Mad plan, bad tactics= Movements in the Winter Campaign Dembiński's appointment was misguided, because he was introverted, short-tempered, and distrustful. The Hungarian commanding officers did not like it. Dembiński had an argument with Mór Perczel, stood down György Klapka, and later had an argument with Artúr Görgey. Dembiński's plans were to fight the final battle at Mezőkövesd and Eger, but before this to attack the Austrian army at Szolnok. He was so obsessive about his plans that he even refused to attack Franz Schlik, even though Shlik was completely isolated. Dembiński's explanation was that if he did, Winfisch-Grätz still wanted control in Buda, which meant that the battle plans for Mezőkövesd and Eger were null and void. Dembiński stuck to his plan and drew back one of his legions from Pétervására when Klapka wanted to attack Schlik on 24 February. =Balance of forces= Henryk Dembiński Polish-born, Hungarian-Polish supreme commander in the Battle of Kápolna. After the defeat he lost his position. Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Grätz, captain of the Austrian army. During the Winter Campaign, Joseph Kriehuber's litrograph (1852) Windisch-Grätz saw Schilck army's vulnerable position and the Hungarian army's activity, so he started to move his army towards the River Tisza. On the one hand Windisch-Grätz wanted to stop the Hungarian army, but on the other he wanted to make contact with Schilck, but they only communicated through a messenger. Windisch-Grätz's army had 30,000 men and 165 cannon. The Hungarian-Polish-Italian army had about 43,000 men and 150 cannon, but the supreme commander only counted 36,000 men and 136 cannon. So there was a chance that the Hungarians and Poles would win on numbers, but the sticking point was for Dembiński to close up gather the Hungarian forces. But he did not. On 26 February, at 10 a.m., the Austrian army started to move from Gyöngyös to Tarna, where they met with the Hungarian army. The first Hungarian legion, under the command of Arisztid Dessewffy, remained at Verpelét. A small commando from this legion were at Sirok. The arriving Austrian army realised that the Hungarian army was much stronger than they, and after a short fight the Austrian army started to move towards Feldebrő. Battle =Demolished bridges on the River Tarna= A lithograph of Ernő Poeltenberg by Elek Szamossy Ernő Poeltenberg () and his Seventh Legion marched into Feldebrő around noon, and at 2 p.m. Poeltenberg moved his legion and crossed the River Tarna. First they fought with Major General at the forest of Aldebrő. At first neither of the armies could get a decisive victory, but Colloredo got more and more reinforcements, and Poeltenberg had to retreat. Poeltenberg got no news from his messenger, who he had sent to Káplona, so he crossed the Tarna in the middle of Austrian fire. He demolished the bridges on the Tarna, emptied Aldebrő (Lower Debrő) and Feldebrő (Upper Debrő) and retreated in the direction of Kerecsend. The Austrian army occupied the forest but they did not cross the Tarna, or occupy Aldebrő or Feldebrő. In the meantime Dembiński arrived and gave an order to Poeltenberg to go back to the two villages. The next morning Poeltenberg was stationed at Aldebrő and Feldebrő. =Belated order= Franz Wyss, who died in the Battle of Csorna. Contemporary lithograph Colonel János Máriássy’s Driquet brigade, part of the First Hungarian Division, crossed the Tarna at the beginning of the battle and was stationed between the Kompolt Forest and the Kápolna vineyard. There was a legion available for Máriássy, and with it he tried a covert attack to the rear of Franz Wyss, but it was discovered and repelled. But Máriássy's cavalrymen still managed to blockade the Austrian army. The Hungarian army retreated in the direction of Tarna. The Second Hungarian Legion under the command of Móric Kisfaludy was stationed at Kál. Kisfaludy crossed the river after he heard the first cannon fire and attacked the Austrian army. Even though Kisfaludy's army was weaker than the Austrian army, the Hungarian army defended its position and defeated Wyss. Dembiński was in conference with Görgei in Eger when he heard the cannon, and they both immediately went to Kápolna. Dembiński gave an order for the rear army to advance, but only two of the legions received the order in time. Thus the legion under the command of Sulcz joined together with the legions at Verpelét, and Lajos Aulich’s legion advanced to Kál. =Sirok Channel= Franz Schlik, a lithograph by Josef Kriehuber During the night the Hungarian army's position became worse because Schlik took control of the Sirok Channel without a fight and he was nearer to the Hungarian army at Verpelét. The battle continued on 27 February. Wyss' main aim was to occupied Kápolna which meant that he would cross through the Hungarian army and destroy its right flank, because he knew that Schlik occupied Sirok canal and was advancing towards the right flank. Klapka had to defend Verpelét with only one division. Dembiński gave an order to Klapka to reoccupy the Sirok Channel and sent reinforcements under the command of Poeltenberg. At the same time Dembiński ordered Görgei to lead the Hungarians at Verpelét and stop the separated divisions of the Austrian army coming together. Poeltenberg had just arrived at Verpelét when Schlik occupied it, and he tried to attack the Austrian army. Klapla, seeing the Hungarian army's success, tried to reoccupy Verpelét, but it wasn't successful. =Ineffective attack= Battle of Kápolna By this time Görgei had arrived in Verpelét. As the commander of the Dessewffy and Poeltenberg legions, Görgei held up Schlik, but he needed to retreat in the direction of Kerecsend because he did not want the Austrian army to get trapped. Dembiński commanded the Márriássy legion in a retreat from Kápolna eastwards towards the Tarna riverbank and blockaded the bridge too. Máriássy warned Dembiński that defence of Kápolna would be almost impossible, because the Austrian army, who were on the other bank of the river, still controlled Dembiński's side too. Dembiński ignored Máriássy's warning, and started to attack to retake Kápolna. The Hungarian divisions, commanded by Móric Psotta and Cézár Mednyánszky, were advancing to the bridgehead, but there they encountered the Austrians and capitulated. Máriássy also attacked the Austrians at a pub they were occupying in Kápolna. Because Psotta and Mednyánszky capitulated, Wyss could concentrate on Máriássy's army and expelled it from the pub. Máriássy tried to retake, but he had to retreat in the direction of Kerecsend. However, the Austrian attack got stuck here and Windisch-Grätz tried a covert attack against the Hungarians at Tófalu. Relief of supreme commander Prime Minister Bertalan Szemere Dembiński drew back the Hungarian army from Kál in the direction of the eastern bank of the Tarna. On 27 February Aulich's legions defended against the Austrian army, but before he went to reoccupy Kápolna, Aulich received an order from Dembiński to advance north and attack from there. Aulich was advancing there when he received the news that the Austrian army had defeated the Hungarian army at Kál. Because of this Aulich turned back towards Kál, but before he arrived Dembiński ordered him to retreat. At the same time that Guyon and György Kmety's legions arrived to Kerecsend, but Dembiński didn't continue the battle and gave the order for retreat. Klapka's legion's officers didn't want to follow Dembiński's advice unless one of the commanding officers confirmed it. On 3 March Bertalan Szemere arrived at Tiszafüred for a debriefing military meeting where he became the intermediary between Dembiński and the Hungarian army. Szemere visited Dembiński and tried to convince him to hold another debriefing. Because Dembiński didn't want to, Szemere relieved him of his command and gave his post to Görgey, who became the supreme commander.

Maria Theresia Irmgard Seefried was born in , near Mindelheim, Bavaria, Germany, the daughter of educated Austrian-born parents. She studied at Augsburg University before making her debut in Aachen as the priestess in Verdi's Aida in 1940. She began to sing leading parts in 1942 (Agathe in Weber's Der Freischütz in 1942, and the next year she made her debut at Vienna State Opera with Eva in Wagner's Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg conducted by Karl Böhm). From then on, she remained with the State Opera until her retirement in 1976. She sang at the Salzburg Festival every year from 1946 to 1964 (except 1955, 1961 and 1962) in operas (Susanna in The Marriage of Figaro, Fiordiligi in Così fan tutte, Zerlina in Don Giovanni, Pamina in The Magic Flute, Marzelline in Fidelio and the Composer in Ariadne auf Naxos), concerts and recitals. She appeared at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden in London from 1947 to 1949, and also La Scala in Milan, the Edinburgh Festival, etc. She made her Metropolitan Opera in New York City debut in November 1953 as Susanna in Mozart's Nozze di Figaro and appeared there for only one season (1953–54), in five performances, all as Susanna. One of the outstanding singers to emerge immediately after the Second World War, she was noted for her Mozart and Richard Strauss roles. But she also sang in other composers' operas; the title role in Puccini's Madama Butterfly, Marie in Alban Berg's Wozzeck, Eva in Meistersinger, Blanche in Poulenc's Dialogues des Carmélites, and the title role in Janáček's Káťa Kabanová. She was also a noted lieder singer, and a number of her Salzburg Festival recitals were recorded. She left many recordings of oratorio and sacred music by Bach, Mozart, Haydn (including at least four different renditions of the Archangel Gabriel in Die Schöpfung), Brahms, Fauré, Beethoven, Dvořák, Verdi and Stravinsky. Although she was a high soprano, she performed, and recorded, both the trouser roles of the Composer and Octavian in Richard Strauss's Ariadne auf Naxos and Der Rosenkavalier, respectively. These roles are usually associated with weightier voices, and today are usually sung by mezzo-sopranos. She often sang with Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, who said in interview that Seefried was naturally able to achieve results effortlessly which other singers, including Schwarzkopf herself, had to work hard to produce. She can be seen singing Mahler on a DVD from EMI, with Schwarzkopf and Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau. She was married to Austrian violinist Wolfgang Schneiderhan, one of the concertmasters of the Vienna Philharmonic, from 1948 until her death. They had three daughters, one of whom is actress (born 1957). After retirement, she taught students at the Vienna Academy of Music (Wiener Singakademie) and Salzburg Mozarteum. She died at 69 in Vienna in 1988.

General information Cheshunt School was a mixed Foundation school for students aged 11 to 16 years at Cheshunt in Hertfordshire. The school had, since 2003, been designated as a Specialist Technology College. Most pupils transfer to the school from seven main partner primary schools though pupils come from over 30 schools in the south east of Hertfordshire and north Enfield. On 29 August 2017 the school re-opened as Goffs-Chuchgate Academy with new uniform and with Mr Thomas Sparks as principal. History Cheshunt Grammar School was built in 1935 in Windmill Lane. Over the years many newer buildings were added around the original building. In 1988 the County Council closed the nearby Bishopslea School in College Road, and distributed the pupils around the other local schools, although Cheshunt Grammar School took most of the pupils and some teachers. In 1990, it was decided to move the entire school to the old Bishopslea School site in College Road. The new school was called Cheshunt School and opened in September 1992. The old Grammar School was demolished and became a housing estate, despite the County Council's explicit prior assurances during a consultation period with local residents that the site would not be used for housing and that it would instead be put to use for the local community, before the school was closed, with street names reflecting the names of past people at the school.

The modern system has been superimposed on a complex map of streets and wide boulevards that were set in their current routes in the 19th century. On a national level, it is the centre of a web of road and railway, and at a more local level, it is covered with a dense mesh of bus, tram and metro service networks. In 2016, the broader mass transit system of Paris has been ranked as the best public transport system in the world by the ITDP with all Parisians having an easy access to rapid transport, ahead of 26 other international cities, including London and New York City.  Streets and thoroughfares  Paris is known for the non-linearity of its street map, as it is a city that grew 'naturally' around roadways leading to suburban and more distant destinations. Centuries of this demographic growth created a city cramped, labyrinth-like and unsanitary, until a late 19th century urban renovation, overseen by Georges- Eugène Haussmann, resulted in the wide boulevards we see there today. This remained relatively unchanged until the 1970s, and the construction of cross- city and periphery expressways. More recently, the city began renovations to prioritise public transport systems, and has created 'purpose' lanes dedicated to buses, taxis, and, more recently, cyclists, narrowing the passages reserved for automobiles and delivery vehicles. Although reducing traffic flow within the city itself, this traffic modification often results in traffic congestion at the capital's gateway thoroughfares.  Public transport  Locally, Paris' most-frequented public transport is the Métro: across 16 lines, its closely spaced stations (around 500 metres between them on any given line) allow a connection between any capital quarter to any other, and a few lines extend quite far into the suburbs. This is complemented above-ground by a quite complex bus route map of 347 lines, and, since 1992, the tramway has made a reappearance in eight lines around the capital periphery. Paris is also the hub of the Réseau Express Régional (RER), a higher-speed and wider-spaced- station above- and under- ground train network that connects the capital to more distant suburban regions. The Transilien, in a rail network radiating from the capital's train and RER stations, complements this in turn with yet more suburban destinations. Paris' transport tarification is dictated by zones, with zones 1-2 covering the capital and its immediate periphery, and zones 3, 4 and 5 covering increasingly distant destinations in the Île-de- France; monthly or weekly 'Navigo' passes cover all forms of public transport within the Île-de-France (zones no longer apply to the pass since September 2015) for a flat fee. Those without a monthly pass can purchase a single ticket or books of tickets; a single ticket allows a traveller to transfer between the bus and tram networks, and transfer between the metro and RER networks, but one-ticket transfer between the below-ground and above-ground networks is prohibited. = Organisation = For the governance of Paris-area public transport, the basic rule of thumb is that the RATP (Régie Autonome des Transports Parisiens) governs all transport within and extending from the Parisian Capital, and the SNCF (Société Nationale des Chemins de Fer Français, the state-owned rail company whose network covers all of France) governs all transport outside of and only penetrating the capital, but there are exceptions to this rule. Metro, Tramway, most of the Bus services and a few sections of inner-city RER are run by the RATP. The rest of the RER, as well as the Transilien, are run by the SNCF. = Métro = Paris's métro has 14 lines (not including two shorter \\"navette\\" \\"bis\\" lines and the Montmartre funicular), and 12 of these penetrate into the surrounding suburbs (as two, lines 2 and 6, form a circle within Paris). Most lines cross the city diametrically and only the above-mentioned inner-city circular lines serve as a unique lateral interconnection. Walkway between Montparnasse train and Métro stations = RER = The RER (Réseau Express Régional) is a network of large- calibre regional trains that run far into the suburbs of Paris, with fewer stops within the city itself. From its first line A in 1977 it has grown into a network of five lines, A, B, C, D and E: three (A, B, and D) pass through Paris' largest and most central Châtelet-Les-Halles metro station. Line C occupies the path of former railways along the Seine's Rive Gauche quays, and the most recently built line E leaves Paris' Gare Saint-Lazare train station for destinations to Paris' north-east. = Transilien = These are suburban train lines connecting Paris' main stations to the suburbs not reached by the RER. The Transilien lines are named as a play-on-words for the \\"transit\\" of \\"Franciliens,\\" inhabitants of the \\"Île-de-France\\" région of which Paris is the capital. lien also mean link in French. = Tram = A Paris tram All of Paris' tramways had stopped running by 1937, but this mode of transport has returned recently. Beginning in 1992, two lines (the T1 and T2) were built parallel to the outer boundaries of the capital. The T3 line, opened in 2006, occupies a grassy track running alongside most of Paris' Left Bank boundary. =Bus= Paris' bus lines interconnecting all points of the capital and its closest suburban cities. There are 58 bus lines operating in Paris that have a terminus within city limits. The capital's bus system has been given a major boost over the past decade. Beginning in early 2000, Paris' major arteries have been thinned to reserve an express lane reserved only for bus and taxi, usually designated with signs and road markings. More recently, these bus lanes have been isolated from the rest of regular circulation through low concrete barriers that form \\"couloirs\\" and prevent all other forms of Paris circulation from even temporarily entering them. There are electric buses.A new electric bus line in Paris, BE Green Autonomous buses are also being experimented in Vincennces since November 2017. Autonomous buses experiment in Vincennes. =Cycling= Cycling is common in Paris. Cycling is becoming a popular mode of transport in Paris although the infrastructure are still very scarce. The Vélib' bike hire scheme was introduced in the middle of 2007 with over 20,000 bicycles available at hire points throughout the city. =Paris Public Transport Statistics= The average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Paris, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 64 min. 15% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 12 min, while 14.% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is , while 29.% travel for over in a single direction. 50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.  National and international rail connections  Paris's first \\"embarcadère\\" train station, the predecessor to the gare Saint-Lazare, appeared from 1837 as a home for the novelty Paris- à-Saint-Germain local line. Over the next ten years France's developing rail network would give Paris five (including the Saint-Lazare station) national railway stations and two suburban lines, and from 1848 Paris would become the designated centre of an \\"Étoile\\" (star) spider-web of rail with reaches to (and through) all of France's borders. This pattern is still very visible in France's modern railway map. As far as national and European destinations are concerned, rail transport is beginning to outdistance air travel in both travel time and efficiency. The still-developing SNCF's TGV (Train à Grande Vitesse) network, since its birth in 1981, brings France's most southerly Marseille only 3 hours from the capital. A train similar to the TGV, the Eurostar, has been connecting Paris to central London by rail in 2h 15 since 1994, and in the opposite direction, the Thalys train service connects Brusselsin 1h22 with up to 26 departures/day, Amsterdam in 3h18 with up to 10 departures/day and Cologne in 3h14, with up to 6 departures/day .

Aviation became a serious mode of transport during the course of World War I, which in 1915 led to the installation of a larger and more permanent runway installation near the town of Le Bourget to the north of Paris. A yet larger airport to the south of the Capital, Orly Airport, began welcoming flights from 1945, and yet another airport to the north of the City, Roissy-Charles-de-Gaulle, opened its gates from 1974. Today the former airfields of Issy-les-Moulineaux have become a Heliport annex of Paris, and Le Bourget an airfield reserved for smaller aircraft. Roissy- Charles-de-Gaulle takes the majority of international flights to and from Paris, and Orly is a host to mostly domestic and European airline companies. In addition, a few low-cost carrier airlines, notably Ryanair and Wizz Air, offer flights to Beauvais–Tillé Airport and Châlons Vatry Airport, while marketing these airports as Paris airports. However, these airports are a lot farther from Paris than Orly and CDG, similarly to airports around London, located hours away from the city center.  History  Carriages and chairs with bearers, in front of the Louvre construction site, by Gabriel Pérelle (about 1665) In the Middle Ages, Paris was densely populated, but small, with the population packed within the city walls. As late as 1610 it was possible to walk from one side of the city to the other in about thirty minutes. While the nobility and wealthy had carriages, horses or chairs carried by porters, ordinary citizens had to walk. As the city grew, a new means of transport was needed. In 1617, letters of patent were granted for the first public transport service, chairs and porters for hire. The earliest chairs were uncovered, but then covered chairs were imported from London. Beginning in 1671, the chairs and porters had competition from chairs mounted on two wheels, pushed by one or several men. They were known as brouettes, roulettes or vinaigrettes. These continued to serve Parisians well in the 18th century, with rates set by the city government. The first public transit service in the modern sense (fixed routes, distance based fares, a seven and a half minute headway) were the short-lived Carrosses à cinq sols introduced on the basis of an idea by Blaise Pascal. However, they were withdrawn shortly after their introduction in the 1660s. = Fiacres, Taxis = Fiacres on Boulevard Montmartre, by Camille Pissarro (1897) Early in the 17th century, the first wheeled one-horse carriages with drivers for hire, called fiacres, were introduced in Paris. Several companies existed, and rates were set by the Parlement of Paris in 1666. There were thirty-three stations around Paris where they could be hired. Their numbers increase from 45 in 1804 to 900 in 1818 to 2600 in over ten thousand in 1900, about the time for the first automobile taxis were introduced. The last horse-drawn fiacre disappeared in 1922. Paris Omnibus in 1828 The first automobile taxicabs were introduced in Paris in 1898; there were eighteen in service during the 1900 Exposition, and more than four hundred by 1907, though they were still outnumbered by fiacres. Paris taxis played a memorable part in World War I, carrying French soldiers to the front in the First Battle of the Marne in 1914. There were more than ten thousand taxis in Paris in 1949. = The Omnibus, Autobus = The horse-drawn omnibus, a large square coach with rows of seats inside, carrying between 12 and 18 passengers each, was introduced in Paris in 1828. They ran from seven in the morning until seven in the evening (until midnight on the Grands Boulevards). By 1840 there were twenty-three omnibus lines operated by thirteen different companies. In 1855, Emperor Napoleon III ordered all the lines consolidated into a single company, the Compagnie Generale des omnibus. = The Tramway = Horse-drawn tram on Boulevard de Sebastopol (about 1906) Beginning in 1852, the omnibus faced competition from the horse-drawn tramway, which ran on a track. The first tramway line ran from the Place de la Concorde to Passy, and, since it was modeled after the tramway system of New York, it was known as the chemin de fer Americain, or American railway. Additional lines were built between 1855 and 1857 between Rueil and Port-Marly and between Sèvres and Versailles. The first steam-driven trams were tried from 1876, but they were too costly and were not a success. The first electric tramway line was opened in April 1892 between Saint-Denis and the Madeleine; but in 1900 most public transport was still horse-drawn; on the 89 omnibus lines and 34 tramway lines in 1900, there were 1,256 horse-drawn vehicles, and just 490 electric trams. Motorized Omnibus on Place du Carrousel (1910) By 1914, the however, the situation had changed dramatically; all of the tramway cars were electric, and the network of tramway lines covered the entire city, except for the Champs- Élysées, the avenue de l'Opera, and the Grands Boulevards. Soon afterwards, however, the tramways faced growing competition from automobiles, and the trams were blamed for slowing down traffic. In 1929, the Municipal Council decided to replace the trams with motorbuses. On 15 May 1937, the last tram ran between porte de Vincennes and the Porte de Saint-Cloud. Trams made a comeback beginning in 1990s, when the city decided to encourage more clean- energy modes of transport, and opened nine new Paris-suburb tram lines. = The Predecessor to the Metro: The Petite Ceinture = Petit Ceinture passenger train (before 1914) In 1850 the government decided to create the Chemin de fer de Ceinture, a railroad line around the city periphery, to connect the main stations that until then had to shuttle freight between them across Paris' streets. Construction began from 1851, the first sections were opened later the same year, and its Rive Droite section was operational by the end of 1852. The Nord company Paris-Auteuil passenger line opened from 1854. The Chemin de fer de Ceinture rail companies were loathe to open their freight line to passenger service (that they thought would encumber freight transport), but eventually gave in to government pressure and opened five Rive Droite passenger stations that opened for service from 14 July 1862. With the opening of the Rive Gauche section from 1867, and the completion of a connection between the Auteuil and Rive Droite sections in 1869, passengers could travel in an uninterrupted ring, through twenty-five stations, around the capital. The Chemin de fer de Petite Ceinture (that had become 'Petite' from 1882 because of the construction of a wider ring of Grande Ceinture rail) was almost a predecessor to the Paris métro: it carried more than twenty million passengers in 1889, and forty million in the year of the 1900 Paris Exposition. After the first Paris metro line opened that year Ceinture passenger numbers dropped steadily; 24 million in 1910 and 12 million in 1920, and it ran up a large deficit each year. In 1931, the Municipal Council decided to stop passenger service. On 31 July 1934 the train service was replaced by a bus line around the city. = The Métro = Metro car at Bastille station on the first line constructed (1908) Paris was well behind other cities in having its own Metro; London (1863), New York City (1868), Berlin (1878), Budapest (1896) and Vienna (1898). The project was delayed due to political battles about where it would run; the railways, supported by the government, wanted a system that would connect the different stations with each other and with the Paris suburbs, while the City of Paris wanted a system that would operate only inside the twenty arrondissements. In 1898, with the 1900 Paris Universal Exposition approaching, the city won the battle. Work began on the first six lines, totaling 65 kilometers. The first line was between Porte de Vincennes and Porte-Maillot, which served the Exposition site at the Grand Palais. Line 2 between Porte Dauphine and Nation opened in April 1903. The line between Etoile and Nation (now line number 6) was finished in 1905. The new system crossed the Seine via two bridges, at Passy and Bercy; a third, at Austerlitz, was added. In April 1905, the first tunnel under the river was opened. By 1970 there were six tunnels under the Seine and five bridges used by the Metro lines within the city. =Chronology of Parisian transport= *13th century. first mention of Charrettes and bacs. *14th century. Carts and trams for sovereigns and the King's court; covered litters for women nobles. *1405. Isabeau of Bavaria enters the Capital in Paris' first known chariot branlant (suspended buggy). *22 October 1617. The first taxi concession for portable chairs, followed by other like concessions for chariots and carts. The chariots of the latter concession, granted by the King to a certain Nicolas Sauvage, were later called fiacres because of their habit of waiting for fares in front of one of Paris' (then few) major hotels named for the Saint Fiacre. *1653. New association under (with) Charles Villerme, given the privilege (by the King) of renting horse-drawn carriages. The same with Givray in 1657, and again with Catherine Henriette de Bourbon in 1661. *1662, January. The King distributes licence letters to the duc de Rouanès, the Mis. de Sourches et le Mis. de Crénan to circulate their rentable carriages along a fixed route - in other words, Paris' first bus system. There were five cross-town itineraries and one circular. *1664. Four-place horse- drawn open carriages: chaise de Crénan - served first as a city carriage, then as a rentable \\"taxi\\" carriage. *1671. New types of carriages appear: roulettes, brouettes et vinaigrettes. Other transports in use that year: cabriolet, modern coach, sedans, two-floor sedans (with top rack), face-to- face coaches, sedan-cut or diligance-cut (side doors) coaches, and the \\"désobligeante. *18 March 1682. Royal licence authorizing rental coaches to charge a 5 sol fee. *16th century. the \\"carrosse\\" (four-wheeled coach) appears early in the century, followed by the \\"coche\\" (suspended coach) around 1575–1580. *1780. Rental cabriolets replace hand-drawn and hand-carried chaises. *1790. The revolutionary government grants entrepreneurs freedom to do any business they like without restriction. *17th century. chaise à bras - an enclosed single seat carried either by two porters or pulled by a porter on two wheels. This mode of transport appeared because of the city's narrow and crowded streets - used at first by invalids or the ill, then later used by all. *1800. Police regimentation of all Parisian rental and public transport services. *1817. Return of control over public transport businesses: no public transport vehicle allowed to circulate in Paris without a special permit. *1828. Stanislas Baudry creates several horse-drawn Omnibus bus lines. The name comes from his first such endeavour in Nantes in 1823 - one of his bus line's terminuses was at a hat-maker's shop that went under the name of, when combined with that of its owner, \\"Omnés Omnibus\\"; Omnibus means \\"for all\\" in Latin. *1853. Impériale omnibus invented: the first double decker buses. The upper floor was cheaper and often uncovered. *16 August 1853. The government authorizes the civil engineer Loubat to construct a tram system between Alma and Iena. He had already done the same in New York one year earlier (he had actually reactivated a failed 1832 tram system). *1854. City engineers Brame and Flachat draw a plan to connect Les Halles to the Chemin de fer de Ceinture through an underground air-propelled railway. The line would begin at La Villette and go through an open trench until the Strasbourg station, from where it would go underground to the marketplace, and the freight would be lifted to the surface with hydraulic elevators. Five kilometres long, foreseen cost nine million francs, approved by study panel, construction announced, but project abandoned. *1854. The 25 public transport lines cover of Parisian streets. Different lines designated by a letter system then. *1854, February. CGO (Compagnie generale des Omnibus) created after another concession grant. They had the right to shuttle and park their buses anywhere in Paris for a 30-year period, but this delay was later extended to 56 years (or until 30 April 1910). They also were granted the right to create two new lines serving Boulogne and Vincennes. *8 February 1854. Napoleon III authorizes (by decree) a tramway concession between Sèvres and Vincennes with an antenna to the rond- point de Boulogne, but the only part exploited was between the place du Concorde and porte de Vincennes. *1855. Creation of the Compagnie Imperiale des voitures de Paris - a merger of all existing voiture (taxi) companies. *1855. Faster and larger two-horse omnibuses (24 seats). Inside seats cost 30 centimes and include a transfer. A seat on the imperiale costs 15 centimes, but no transfer possible. *1856. Loubat returns his CGO concession to the government. *1866. \\"Voiture\\" (non-syndicated) taxis are once again given complete freedom - anyone with a buggy can give transport services. *25 February 1867. Creation of the \\"Bateaux-Omnibus\\" and \\"Hirondelles parisiennes\\" companies - replaces a paddleboat service between Pont Royal and Saint-Cloud. *1873. first (horse-drawn) tram line opens *3 September 1874.

It is a part of the East African country of Kenya. Lamu was founded in the 12th Century. Lamu is one of the longest established, and best preserved remaining settlements of the Swahili tradition in east Africa that remains today. The island has continually been inhabited for over seven hundred years, and continues to be an important center in eastern Africa. Swahili Culture The island of Lamu is a Swahili settlement filled with culture. Prior to the birth of the Prophet Muhammad, people of various countries and regions migrated to the island of Lamu. Traders and sailors from the Arabian Peninsula, China, India and South- East Asia traveled across the Indian Ocean to the East African Coast to reach the island of Lamu. The diverse mixture of sailors and traders with the native people of the Lamu island created distinguishable social classes and a diverse social structure on this African Island. The Swahili language is known as Kiswahili, and has various dialects throughout the island. There are several different social classes that the people living on the island of Lamu are considered to be part of. The different social classes are separated into the following: indigenous people (Wenyeji), foreigners (Wageni), Arabs (Waarabu) and the Africans (Waafrika). These different groups of people all identity themselves differently based on their social status, but another interesting factor that makes these groups unique that is that each social status has a different dialect. The Swahili culture is not a single culture or a way of life, it is yet a mixture of traces from European, African, Arab and Asian traditions and cultures. Since the Island of Lamu was visited by many sailors and travelers in the early years of this island’s settlement it was able to become a diverse island. The Swahili culture has a rich history and embraces all parts of the society on the island of Lamu. Because of the small winding roads on the Island, residents are forced to walk via foot or by donkey to get to wherever they are going. The use of cars for the general public is banned. The weather in this region is generally warm ranging from about 23 and 33 °C. Experiencing the warmest weather from December to April and the coldest weather from may to July A port was founded on the island of Lamu by Arab traders at least as early as the fourteenth century, when the Pwani Mosque was built. The island prospered on the slave trade. After defeating Pate Island in the nineteenth century, the island became a local power, but it declined after the British forced the closure of the slave markets in 1873. In 1890 the island became part of Zanzibar and remained obscure until Kenya was granted independence from Great Britain in 1963. Tourism developed from the 1970's, mainly around the eighteenth century Swahili architecture and traditional culture. Along its southern coastline the area of Lamu island is composed of mainly sand dunes, which cover the Shela aquifer which is responsible for the islands main source of water. Kenya, South Sudan and Ethiopia have launched the controversial LAPSSET development project to build a port, oil refinery and rail network near the island of Lamu,African leaders launch 'super port' project the Lamu Port and Lamu-Southern Sudan-Ethiopia Transport Corridor. Settlements map of kenya =Lamu Old Town= Lamu Old Town, the principal inhabited part of the island, is one of the oldest and best-preserved Swahili settlements in East Africa.. This city has had civilians living in it for over seven hundred years, while most of the other East African settlements along the coast do not have inhabitants.Due to Lamu's history in trading gold, spices, and slaves, Lamu is truly a melting pot of different cultures and Arabic, Persian, Indian, European, and Swahili traditions that are evidently on display in Lamu's Architecture. Lamu is an important center for trade because it is the most important trade center in East Africa. People migrated from various lands and from various cultures to conduct trade at the port of Lamu, the abundance of a diversity of people trading at the island of Lamu impacted the future culture of this island. Not only did the traders help the economy of Lamu grow, but it also gave the local people the opportunity to adopt different customs as their own. Because of this, Lamu is also an important cultural, technological, and religious center in Eastern Africa. Lamu has hosted major Muslim religious festivals since the 19th century, and has become a significant center for the study of Islamic and Swahili cultures which scholars from both traditions studying in Lamu. Most evident tradition in Lamu however is the Swahili. In falling characteristically with the Swahili culture, most of the town is built with coral stone and mangrove timber. The town is characterized by the simplicity of structural forms enriched by such features as inner courtyards, verandas, and elaborately carved wooden doors. It is also uniquely Swahili in that the towns is spatially organized, and is littered with narrow winding streets. =Shela= Anchored boat in Shela Village. Shela Shela is a village about south of Lamu (town). The origin of the village is unknown, but according to tradition, it was settled by people from nearby Manda Island. In 1813, the elite of Pate Island, allied with the Mazrui clan from Oman, attempted to subjugate Lamu in the Battle of Shela. This attempt failed totally, and the defeat of Pate at Shela signalled the rise of Lamu as the leading power in the archipelago. Shela's golden age was from 1829 to 1857, when 5 of its 6 mosques were constructed. It is especially known for the Friday mosque. A 3D documentation based on terrestrial laser- scanning done by the Zamani Project of the Shela Mosque (Friday Mosque) was carried out in 2006. A 3D model, a Panorama tour, plans and images can be view here. Shela is now a centre for tourism on the island, with several guest houses featured by the coast. Shela is also home to the most spectacular beaches on Lamu island, which were damaged during the tsunami caused by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. The appearance of the area is much more in keeping with the imagined East African coastline, with its almost pure white sand, traditional dhows, and clean appearance. It makes a sharp contrast to Lamu town (directly opposite the airstrip on Manda) which lacks a beach and functions as a relatively busy port. Chris Hanley as well as Sienna Miller own houses in Shela. =Matondoni= Matondoni Known for the building and repairing of dhows, Matondoni lies at the NW coast of the island, west of Lamu (town). The locals of this village are best known for building dhows. With the increasing use of speedboats, the production of dhows is starting to decrease. Now smaller dhows are created for fishing for smaller fish. There are several hundred-people living on in the village of Matondoni; the natives live in thatched huts and use mud for daily life. The village has a modern jetty. =Kipungani= Kipungani This is a small village on the southwestern coast of the island. With the white sand beaches, this village is a popular tourist attraction. While staying in the village of Kipungani, tourists are given the options to engage in activities such as snorkeling, deep sea game fishing, and wandering the village for sight-seeing. Locals here create straw mats, baskets, hats and kifumbu (woven strainer), used to squeeze milk from mashed coconut. Present day Michael W. Smith featured a song about visiting the island called \\"Lamu\\" on his 1986 album The Big Picture. A different version is featured on Smith's 1987 live album The Live Set. In 2001, Lamu was designated a United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization or UNESCO site. Centuries ago the island of Lamu was highly dependent on the function of slavery in its economy, since abolishment of slavery the island has looked for other ways to bring wealth back into its economy. With the diverse cultural and colorful design of Lamu, it is a place of interest for tourists drawn to the East African Coast. The economy of the island of Lamu depends on foreigners coming to the island to experience the local lifestyle and be part of the local culture. As of recent, Lamu has entered a new phase of becoming a popular tourist location in Eastern Africa.

Life  Eysteinn Ásgrímsson was a member of the Icelandic clergy as well as a skald. In 1343 he was sent to prison for beating up his abbot in the abbey of Þykkvabær. Some scholars assume that this was the occasion he composed 'Lilja', which is marked by a deep concern with sinfulness. He was sent to Norway in 1355 and returned in 1357 as an inspector of churches. On the way back to Norway in 1360 the voyage turned out to be too rough for him, and the poet died just after landing.  Work  His poem Lilja (\\"the lily\\", in medieval Christian imagery the flower which symbolizes purity and thus also the Virgin Mary) still lives, however, mainly because of its extraordinarily gifted composition and the fact that Eysteinn was, for his times, a purist regarding language: he avoided both complicated kenningar and borrowings as far he could. This is especially noteworthy as the poetic tradition he was a member of (skaldic poetry) draws for a great part upon most complex formal aspects, among them alteration and interweaving of word and phrase positions, a highly elaborated metaphorical system and strict metrical rules. Only the metrical regulations are still held up by Eysteinn in his poem, although he does not use the traditional Dróttkvætt metre, but the Hrynhent whose main difference is a syllable count of eight in contrast to the six-syllabic dróttkvætt. The metre has also been seen to relate, in its slower, broader word-flow, to the sermon tradition. The syntactic and semantic complexities of scaldic poetry are explicitly avoided by Eysteinn, in favour of a Christian 'claritas'-ideal as stated by St. Thomas Aquinas. The poet is shown as a truly religious man with a deep understanding of human needs and their relationship to God, as it was understood at the time. Lilja is still read today.

(2013). Molecular evidence suggests that the enigmatic Sulawesi endemic species belongs in the genus Zoothera (Turdidae, Aves) . Chinese Birds 4 (2): 155–160.Gill F. and Donsker D. (eds), Family Turdidae in «IOC World Bird Names (ver 4.1)», International Ornithologists’ Union, 2014. It is sometimes classified as Geomalia heinrichi, in which case it is monotypic in the genus Geomalia (which is the source of its primary common name). The coloration of the bird is primarily dark brown with chestnut color on the breast. The long legs, long tail and short wings struck the discoverer as reminiscent of laughingthrushes, and the name Geomalia is itself a reference to another, superficially similar Sulawesi endemic, the malia, but the two species are not related. The specific name commemorates its discoverer, the German explorer Gerd Heinrich. There has been some debate over the taxonomic affinities of the geomalia. While it has some features typical of thrushes (such as an upright posture, juveniles with spotted underparts, and thrush-like terrestrial foraging behavior), several others (such as its long, rounded tail; short wings; and apparent lack of a song) have led authors to question whether its placement in the thrush family is appropriate. A genetic study published in 2013 confirmed its placement in the family Turdidae, specifically as an aberrant member of the genus Zoothera. Due to its isolation and the difficulty of getting to its habitat, the geomalia is little-studied. The species may be threatened by uncontrolled logging and other activities that cause degradation of the Sulawesi highlands, including the grounds of legally protected lands such as Lore Lindu National Park. It is listed as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List.

The most common layout features two identical turbochargers in parallel; other twin-turbo layouts include sequential and staged turbocharging.  Parallel  A parallel configuration refers to using two equally-sized turbochargers which each receive half of the exhaust gases. Some designs combine the intake charge from each turbocharger into a single intake manifold, while others use a separate intake manifold for each turbocharger. Parallel configurations are well suited to V6 and V8 engines since each turbocharger can be assigned to one cylinder bank, reducing the amount of exhaust piping needed. In this case, each turbocharger is fed exhaust gases by a separate exhaust manifold. For four-cylinder engines and straight-six engines, both turbochargers can be mounted to a single exhaust manifold. The aim of using parallel twin-turbos is to reduce turbo lag by being able to use smaller turbochargers than if a single turbocharger was used for the engine. On engines with multiple cylinder banks (e.g. V engines and flat engines) use of parallel twin-turbos can also simplify the exhaust system. The 1981-1994 Maserati Biturbo was the first production car to use twin-turbochargers. The Biturbo used a 90-degree SOHC V6 engine with one turbocharger per cylinder bank. Parallel configurations have also been used on engines with more than two turbochargers. One example is the 1991-1995 Bugatti EB110, which uses four turbochargers on its V12 engine. The 2005-2015 Bugatti Veyron uses four turbochargers— one per cylinder bank— on its W16 engine.  Sequential  Sequential turbocharging refer to a set-up in which the engine uses one turbocharger for lower engine speeds, and a second or both turbochargers at higher engine speeds. This system is intended to overcome the limitation of large turbochargers providing insufficient boost at low RPM. On the other hand, smaller turbos are effective at low RPM (when there is less kinetic energy present in the exhaust gases) but are unable to provide the quantity of compressed intake gases required at higher RPM. Therefore, sequential turbocharger systems provide a way to decrease turbo lag without compromising power output at high RPM. The system is arranged so that a small (\\"primary\\") turbocharger is active while the engine is operating at low RPM, which reduces the boost threshold (RPM at which effective boost is provided) and turbo lag. As RPM increases, a small amount of exhaust gas is fed to the larger (\\"secondary\\") turbocharger, to bring it up to operating speed. Then at high RPM, all of the exhaust gases are directed to the secondary turbocharger, so that it can provide the boost required by the engine at high RPM. The first production car to use sequential turbocharging was the 1986-1988 Porsche 959, which used sequential twin-turbos on its flat- six engine. Sequential turbocharging can also be used with more than two turbochargers, such as in the 2012-2017 BMW N57S straight-six diesel engine, which uses three sequential turbos.  Staged  Staged turbocharging (also called \\"serial turbocharging\\") is where the turbochargers are connected in series with the output of the first turbocharger then being further compressed by the second turbocharger. A sequential turbo can also be of use to a system where the output pressure must be greater than can be provided by a single turbo, commonly called a staged twin-turbo system. In this case, multiple similarly sized turbochargers are used in sequence, but constantly operating. The first turbo boosts provides the initial compression (for example to three times the intake pressure). Subsequent turbos take the charge from the previous stage and compress it further (for example to an additional three times intake pressure, for a total boost of nine times atmospheric pressure). A downside of staged turbocharging is that it often leads to large amounts of turbo lag, therefore it is mostly used on piston engine aircraft which usually do not need to rapidly raise and lower engine speed. (and thus where turbo lag is not a primary design consideration), and where the intake pressure is quite low due to low atmospheric pressure at altitude, requiring a very high pressure ratio. High-performance diesel engines also sometimes use this configuration, since diesel engines do not suffer from pre-ignition issues and can therefore use high boost pressures.

Wasini Island lies in southeast Kenya off the coast of the Indian Ocean, south of Mombasa, and opposite the harbour of the village Shimoni. It is approximately long and across. the name \\"wasini mpunguti\\" came from the early inhabitants who originally were the Chinese they were short Chinese, hence the name wasini mpunguti which to the locals, means short Chinese. The island has only footpaths of sharp old coral or sand. There are no cars, carts or bicycles. Cargo is transported by foot or by a wheelbarrow with a solid tyre. Transport is over the paths, or via the beaches, mainly consisting of coral and only passable with low tide, or by boat over the sea. Before 1963, in the British colonial time, there was an airstrip in the lagoon situated longitudinal south on the island; only small parts of tarmac are reminders of this history. Population, culture, language and religion The island has a population of about 3.000 living at the South coast in the two villages Wasini and Mkwiro, respectively at the west and east side of the island, and inland in the hamlet Nyuma Maji, which means in Swahili 'behind the water'. In Wasini-village and Nyuma Maji live the Bantu people the Vumba, whose mother tongue is the Swahili dialect kivumba; in Mkwiro the Kifundi (Shirazi) have their own mother tongue, the Swahili dialect kikifundi. Besides that they all speak Swahili and sometimes English. The Vumba are of Arabic origin, may be a little bit mixed with the Chinese. The Arabs came to the East-African coast in the 1st century A.D. and after mixing with the Bantu people they together formed the Coast or Swahili people. The Shirazi probably came from the Persian Gulf in the 15th century A.D. Between the island and the Tanzanian islands Pemba and Zanzibar south-east of the island in the Indian Ocean consist strong cultural connections and family ties. The population is for about 99% Muslim, from liberal to orthodox. (See note 1). Economy and tourism Tourism is the main source of income; second comes fishing. The high poverty level has greatly diminished in the last 30 years due to the tourism based on the approximately 10 km far Kisite-Mpunguti Marine National Park. Here tourists snorkel and dive between the coral around this tiny sand island Kisite which is totally inundated during high tide. This park annually attracted 80.000 of overseas (75%) and African (25%) tourists. Unfortunately, since 2013 there is a decline of 50% in the number of overseas tourists, of which 75% are coming from Europe, because of their fear for Al-Shabaab and since 2014 also for the Ebola virus, although this virus was never detected outside West- Africa and Congo. In Wasini village approximately 50% of the people rely for their income on tourism, so 75% of the population. In Mwiro this percentage are 12%, and probably, 18% respectively. The Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) is monitoring the Kisite Mpunguti Marine Park and is asking for an entry fee. These fees are not recirculated within the auspices of the collection area - instead they are remitted to their headquarters in Nairobi. The majority of visitors arrive on prepaid packages organised outside of the Island and outside of Shimoni. The larger operators are foreign owned. Many such organisations claim to operate responsible tourism - eco tourism. The tourist numbers generated in the area over the years are not monitored for environmental or socio economic impact. Fishing is the second source of income. The fisherman are using open baskets put under water with stones and marcated by mangrove poles hewn on the island and taken into their canoes, or are throwing fishing lines. They are fishing in the sometimes rough waters of the Pemba Channel, between Wasini and Pemba, and the more calm waters between the island and the mainland. Also there are several sports fishing vessels anchored on the shore of Shimoni at the Pemba Channel Club which pass into the Pemba Channel - a fishing ground famous for Kenya, winning All Africa and World IGFA fishing records. The presence of long liner fishing vessels offshore, rising water levels, destructive fishing methods using small seine nets and dynamite on reefs, have all had an detrimental impact on the fish reservoir. Often humpback whales and dolphins can be spotted in the immediate surroundings of the island. Near the mainland humpback whales can regularly be seen swimming northbound on the East African current. At the east side of the island often dolphins are playing in the seawater. On the island itself at the shore opposite of Wasini village near the Kenyan Marine jetty beautiful coral fauna and flora can be seen and be examined while snorkeling; the Beach Management Unit is demanding an entrance fee of 5 US dollars or the equivalent in Kenyan shillings. North of the stairs of the jetty it is nice swimming because of the cool clear seawater there. The harbour of Shimoni, 3 km. diagonal across the channel between the island and the mainland which contains the northward bound East-African current of the Indian Ocean coming from Cape Delgado in the north of Mozambique near the border with Tanzania. is deep enough for a natural port and the only one in this area for oceangoing trading dhows and fishing vessels. It is the stopping off point to reach Wasini island, and is some 75 km south of Mombasa. Port immigration and customs facilities are present and provide services for those trade dhows and people arriving from Tanzania, especially the island Pemba, or further afield. Twice a week there is a passenger transport service by boat to Weyte at Pemba; also it is possible to board a cargo dhow for payment to that harbour. The Wasini Women Group has established a nature boardwalk in the beautiful coral gardens on the Western end. Proceeds help e.g. needy Wasini students and other Wasini citizens. In Mkwiro there is a well established, but rudimentary orphanage. These indigenous Non Government Organisations (NGO's) and self-help groups supplement activities across the water at Shimoni whereby visitors frequent the \\"Shimoni Slave Caves\\" - a community based project. Though it is questionable to what extent and what part both locations played in the slave trade, it is true to say that both were involved in it. In the caves live fruitbats who harbour the innocent Shimoni bat virus. Climate Orientated west to east, Wasini lies about 500 km. south of the equator in the Indian Ocean and is every year blasted by the vigour of the northeast monsoon Kaskazi, which brings the long rains. In the other half of the year the southwest monsoon Kusi brings the short rains. Both monsoons were in the history propelling the trade sailing boats, the dhows from the direction of the Persian Gulf and India, and from the southern parts of East-Africa, and in the other half of the year propelling them back home. Public services The island doesn't cater for boreholes as the source of fresh water; sweet water originating from a borehole lasts for only one week. There exist no piped drinking water. Instead eight rainwater catchments on the island were built, which are sufficient for the demand to fresh water; from there professional water carriers transport the water with their wheelbarrows to the private homes. Kenya's power grid does not extend on the island neither are there public electricity generators, so increasingly people are putting privately owned solarpanels on their roofs to generate electric current. Neither exists there a public sewer system. Deep holes are hacked in the coral rock until the groundwater is reached for building a pit latrine. Those pits are washed out twice a day across through the coralrock by the high tide of the sea. Is the distance short to the sea, the raw effluent will leak in the seawater, resulting in fecal contamination of the seawater near the shore of the villages. However, the longer the distance between the latrinepit and the sea, the more micro-organisms take the chance to clean the passing raw sewage material. Rubbish is not publicly collected although a NGO made a short-lived effort to improve this system. So people are giving their edible garbage to the goats, putting the remains in a compostpit and burn the non-biodegradable left overs. However, at the coast some people tend to dispose the non- biodegradable remains directly in the sea, resulting in floatsam - mainly items of plastic and rubber, but also big derooted wooden trunks and their branches- at the lower end with high tide. The inland lagoon near Nyuma Maji in the southern half of the island and the mangrove forests marshes entrap large quantities of flotsam floating in on the tides. On the sandy mudflats in the west grows Shoreline Seaside Purslane, in Swahili called mboga pwani, \\"the vegetable of the ebb\\", with its official botanical name Sesuvium portulacastrum (See note 2). The island inhabitants cook this tasty and healthy sea vegetable as part of their Swahili dishes. Health The island has two dispensaries, both staffed by one common community health nurse. There is a high infant mortality compared on the island with other parts of Kenya. The main diseases of the children are malaria, respiratory and gastrointestinal infections, while many adults suffer from diabetes mellitus, high blood pressure and gastric ulcer. The dispensaries provide some basic medicines, and give vaccinations to the children and health education to their mothers. For more complicated diseases and sophisticated medical care the inhabitants visit the private and state clinics at the mainland in Shimoni, Msambweni and Mombasa. They can reach these places by matatu. Private car taxis can also be called, but are mostly used by tourists because for the locals they are too expensive. For short distances also the taxi-motorbike, the piki-piki, can be rented. Security Because of the high security on this sparsely populated island, there is no police. The nearest police post is at Shimoni on the mainland: 15 min. by boat. Notes. 1) According to the private observations of a male Muslim villager, of the about 400 adult men in Wasini village, 32 or 8% visit five times a day the main mosque service, while on the holy Friday this number doubles to about 64 or 16%. 2) Determination confirmed by Prof. Dr. E.F.(Erik) Smets, Scientific Director - Botany P.O.Box 9517, 2300 RA Leiden, the Netherlands image:Wasini coast.JPGThe island is located on a fossile coral reef, with Baobab trees growing on it. image:Jardin de Corail de Wasini.JPGThe coral garden at low tide.

The term fountain or rateless refers to the fact that these codes do not exhibit a fixed code rate. A fountain code is optimal if the original k source symbols can be recovered from any k successfully received encoding symbols (i.e., excluding those that were erased). Fountain codes are known that have efficient encoding and decoding algorithms and that allow the recovery of the original k source symbols from any k’ of the encoding symbols with high probability, where k’ is just slightly larger than k. LT codes were the first practical realization of fountain codes. Raptor codes and online codes were subsequently introduced, and achieve linear time encoding and decoding complexity through a pre-coding stage of the input symbols. Information about availability of an efficient software implementation of the RaptorQ code specified in IETF RFC 6330 (the most advanced fountain code), can be found at the website for the Codornices project at ICSI .  Applications  Fountain codes are flexibly applicable at a fixed code rate, or where a fixed code rate cannot be determined a priori, and where efficient encoding and decoding of large amounts of data is required. One example is that of a data carousel, where some large file is continuously broadcast to a set of receivers. Using a fixed-rate erasure code, a receiver missing a source symbol (due to a transmission error) faces the coupon collector's problem: it must successfully receive an encoding symbol which it does not already have. This problem becomes much more apparent when using a traditional short-length erasure code, as the file must be split into several blocks, each being separately encoded: the receiver must now collect the required number of missing encoding symbols for each block. Using a fountain code, it suffices for a receiver to retrieve any subset of encoding symbols of size slightly larger than the set of source symbols. (In practice, the broadcast is typically scheduled for a fixed period of time by an operator based on characteristics of the network and receivers and desired delivery reliability, and thus the fountain code is used at a code rate that is determined dynamically at the time when the file is scheduled to be broadcast.) Another application is that of hybrid ARQ in reliable multicast scenarios: parity information that is requested by a receiver can potentially be useful for all receivers in the multicast group.  Fountain codes in standards  Raptor codes are the most efficient fountain codes at this time, having very efficient linear time encoding and decoding algorithms, and requiring only a small constant number of XOR operations per generated symbol for both encoding and decoding. IETF RFC 5053 specifies in detail a systematic Raptor code, which has been adopted into multiple standards beyond the IETF, such as within the 3GPP MBMS standard for broadcast file delivery and streaming services, the DVB-H IPDC standard for delivering IP services over DVB networks, and DVB-IPTV for delivering commercial TV services over an IP network. This code can be used with up to 8,192 source symbols in a source block, and a total of up to 65,536 encoded symbols generated for a source block. This code has an average relative reception overhead of 0.2% when applied to source blocks with 1,000 source symbols, and has a relative reception overhead of less than 2% with probability 99.9999%. The relative reception overhead is defined as the extra encoding data required beyond the length of the source data to recover the original source data, measured as a percentage of the size of the source data. For example, if the relative reception overhead is 0.2%, then this means that source data of size 1 megabyte can be recovered from 1.002 megabytes of encoding data. A more advanced Raptor code with greater flexibility and improved reception overhead, called RaptorQ, has been specified in IETF RFC 6330. The specified RaptorQ code can be used with up to 56,403 source symbols in a source block, and a total of up to 16,777,216 encoded symbols generated for a source block. This code is able to recover a source block from any set of encoded symbols equal to the number of source symbols in the source block with high probability, and in rare cases from slightly more than the number of source symbols in the source block. The RaptorQ code is an integral part of the ROUTE instantiation specified in ATSC A-331 (ATSC 3.0)  Fountain codes for data storage  Erasure codes are used in data storage applications due to massive savings on the number of storage units for a given level of redundancy and reliability. The requirements of erasure code design for data storage, particularly for distributed storage applications, might be quite different relative to communication or data streaming scenarios. One of the requirements of coding for data storage systems is the systematic form, i.e., the original message symbols are part of the coded symbols. Systematic form enables reading off the message symbols without decoding from a storage unit. In addition, since the bandwidth and communication load between storage nodes can be a bottleneck, codes that allow minimum communication are very beneficial particularly when a node fails and a system reconstruction is needed to achieve the initial level of redundancy. In that respect, fountain codes are expected to allow efficient repair process in case of a failure: When a single encoded symbol is lost, it should not require too much communication and computation among other encoded symbols in order to resurrect the lost symbol. In fact, repair latency might sometimes be more important than storage space savings. Repairable fountain codes are projected to address fountain code design objectives for storage systems. A detailed survey about fountain codes and their applications can be found at. A different approach to distributed storage using fountain codes has been proposed in Liquid Cloud Storage . Liquid Cloud Storage is based on using a large erasure code such as the RaptorQ code specified in IETF RFC 6330 (which provides significantly better data protection than other systems), using a background repair process (which significantly reduces the repair bandwidth requirements compared to other systems), and using a stream data organization (which allows fast access to data even when not all encoded symbols are available).

Joe: A Real American Hero toyline from Hasbro, which has spawned comics and animated series. He first appeared in the 1989 G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero incarnation of the series. He also appears in G.I. Joe: Sigma 6. History If the file cards that came with the Overkill action figures are to be believed, there are actually two different characters that owned the name Overkill. Both versions of the character are the leader of the B.A.T.s (short for Battle Android Troopers) that are controlled by the ruthless Cobra Organization. The first Overkill was an experimental prototype of the B.A.T. with an advanced computer system and tactical logic programs but was considered by Cobra as too expensive to move to mass production. Despite being a soulless automaton, this Overkill is frequently referred to as a \\"he\\". The second version appeared in 2003 as part of the G.I. Joe vs. Cobra series. This Overkill is a cyborg, which is half-man and half-machine. The file card spells his name as \\"Over Kill\\" rather than one word although news releases and the credits in Valor vs. Venom spelled it as \\"Overkill\\". Comics =Real American Hero - Devil's Due= Overkill made his first comic appearance in the Devil's Due G.I. Joe comics and was revealed to be Robert Skelton, the infamous SAW Viper from the Marvel Comics, who had killed a number of Joes, including the Joes' medical officer Doc, the tank driver Heavy Metal, and the A.W.E. Striker driver Crankcase.G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #109. Skelton is recruited by Serpentor and his new organization, the Coil. This is after ten men are sent to bring him in, he kills four. He chooses the name Overkill, in reference to his impressive body count. He participates in the battle against the Joes and Cobra on Cobra Island and fights with General Hawk, and would have killed him had Kamakura not intervened and saved Hawk. Wounded, Overkill made his way onto a submarine with an escaping Cobra Commander and collapses, expressing the desire for power.G.I.Joe: A Real American Hero vol. 2 #25 (Oct. 2003) He was experimented on by Cobra scientists and given his own mobile targeting system and robotic implants (including cutting off his hand for an implant). He did battle with the Joes in Badhikstan and proved to be a formidable opponent before being defeated by Snake Eyes, he begged Snake Eyes to kill him, as he did not want to live like this, but Snake Eyes refused to and Overkill was last seen lying in the desert. He was later a patient at a Cobra facility raided by Torpedo, Wet-Suit, and a group of Navy SEALs.G.I.Joe Special Missions: Antarctica He was killed in the America's Elite series, during Tomax's raid on The Coffin, a prison run by G.I. Joe.G.I.Joe America's Elite #31 =Sigma Six - Devils Due= The G.I. Joe: Sigma 6 version of Overkill also has a comic appearance, in GI Joe: Sigma 6 #3 also from Devil's Due. In the Sigma 6 comics, each issue featured one or two Joes paired up against a Cobra character. Overkill's Joe opponent was Tunnel Rat. The storyline has Tunnel Rat alone in the Arctic without his Sigma suit having to try and stop Overkill and his army of B.A.T.s. A preview of the comic is available at the Devil's Due minisite for the Sigma 6 comics. Toys Overkill was first released as an action figure in 1991, as part of the Talking Battle Commanders line. Animated series =DiC cartoon= Overkill made his first animated appearance in the DiC- produced G.I. Joe animated series, voiced by Dale Wilson. Here he appeared to be fully robotic, and his appearance was that of his first action figure. His key episode in this series is \\"The Eliminator\\", in which he receives an upgrade via the Eliminator chip, which makes him stronger, faster and smarter. This puts him in Cobra Commander's good graces. Other DiC appearances include: * \\"The Eliminator\\"—Overkill gets an upgraded laser in his chest (Laser is included in his V1 action figure) and becomes 'The Eliminator'. * \\"The Sword\\"—where he's sent by Cobra Commander to retrieve the Sword of Destiny from Night Creeper Leader (who, naturally enough, wants it for himself). * \\"El Dorado: The Lost City of Gold\\"—where he's possessed by the spirit of Commander Fernando Luiz Jorge Pizarro, cousin to the explorer Francisco Pizarro. * \\"Kindergarten Commandos\\"—Overkill shows up to help Cobra Commander fight off the forces of six small children and the G.I. Joe Mercer. His appearance in this episode is relatively minor. * \\"Keyboard Warriors\\"—Another minor appearance. =Valor vs. Venom= Overkill returned in the CGI movie G.I. Joe: Valor vs. Venom by Reel FX, now clearly a half-human and half-machine cyborg version, with a variety of robotic appendages and a tendency to repeat the end of his sentences in a manic tone of voice. He serves Cobra as Doctor Mindbender's lab assistant and BAT commander. Overkill looks down upon \\"organics\\", and believes he and his BATs are better candidates to rule the world. In a series of fortuitous circumstances, he makes an alliance with \\"Venomous Maximus\\", a mutated and brainwashed General Hawk. Together, they attempted to remove Cobra Commander from power, and control Cobra themselves. The Joes are able to turn Maximus back into Hawk, and the Cobra base begins to explode around Overkill, who IS seemingly crushed in the ensuing explosion. However, following the credits, Overkill's robotic hand rises up on the screen. This has been theorized as a preview of the abandoned Robot Revolution line rumored to be following Valor vs. Venom. =Sigma 6= Overkill returns in G.I. Joe: Sigma 6, he is now inside a rejuvenation tank and wearing new armor, appearing far more robotic than when he last appeared. He is also revamped from a monotonous automaton lab assistant to Cobra's chief scientist. He is smarter and more devious, with a free will of his own. Overkill is still attempting to overthrow Cobra Commander with his new B.A.T.s, this time in secret, and has a new more powerful BAT called Overlord Vector, which he uses to kidnap General Hawk's son, Scott. Overkill believed Scott had hacked into Cobra's computers, and possessed a formula which would allow his B.A.T.s to evolve as they fought. His kidnapping of Scott ultimately led the Joes to Cobra's underwater headquarters. However, when Overkill scanned Scott's mind, he found that his discovery was just pure dumb luck. Overkill fled as Snake Eyes battled his creation, Overlord Vector. Overkill managed to escape, and still resides in his tank inside his lab in the underground Cobra base, now planning to get hold of the power stones sought by the Joes and Cobra, to launch his Robot Revolution. With the foiling of Cobra's power stones plot, Overkill has apparently given up that quest. During the second season of the cartoon, Overkill is finally able to create himself a body, and is removed from his healing tank. Video game Overkill appeared as a boss in 1992's G.I.

SIMAP uses the FASTA algorithm to precalculate protein similarity, while another application uses hidden Markov models to search for protein domains. SIMAP is a joint project of the Technical University of Munich, the Helmholtz Zentrum München, and the University of Vienna. Project The project usually got new work units at the beginning of each month. More recently, (2010), inclusion of environmental sequences into the database has required longer periods of activity, several months of continuous work for example. Typically, these updates occurred twice each year. In the fourth quarter of 2010, the project relocated to the University of Vienna due to the failing electrical infrastructure at the Technical University of Munich. Part of this exercise involved the creation of a project specific URL requiring existing volunteers and users to detach/reattach to the project. On May 30, 2014, it was announced by project administrators that after a 10-year history, SIMAP would be leaving BOINC by the end of 2014. SIMAP research, however, will go forward with the use of local hardware consisting of \\"ordinary multi-core CPUs (some hundreds), crunching a SSE-optimized version of the Smith-Waterman algorithm.\\"  Computing platform  SIMAP used the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) distributed computing platform. Application performance notes. Work unit CPU times varied widely, ranging between 15 minutes and 3 hours. Work units varied in size from 1.5 to 2.2 MB each, averaging around 2 MB. SIMAP provided client software optimized for SSE enabled processors and x86-64 processors. For older processors non SSE applications are provided but require manual installation steps to be taken. Operating Systems supported by SIMAP are Linux, Windows, Mac OS, Android, and other UNIX platforms. Since the database had sometimes been completed with all publicly known protein sequences and metagenomes having been precalculated by the project, the work available consisted of newly published protein sequences and metagenomes that needed to be precomputed for SIMAP.

Adelman has been a member of the board of directors of the global data collection company RIWI Corp. since June 2016. Early career Adelman was born to a Jewish family and graduated from Grinnell College in Iowa, majoring in philosophy and religion. He received his master's degree in Foreign Service studies and Doctorate in political theory from Georgetown University. Adelman began working for the government in 1969 at the U.S. Department of Commerce, and then served in the Office of Economic Opportunity. From 1975 to 1977 during the Gerald Ford administration, Adelman was an Assistant to United States Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, and was later a member of the Defense Policy Board. He has also served as a national editor of Washingtonian magazine for more than 17 years. Ken Adelman, 1981 He was the deputy U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations for two-and-a-half years, working with Jeane Kirkpatrick. He also served as the Director of the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency for nearly five years, during the Reagan administration. He was an advisor to President Ronald Reagan during the superpower summits between Reagan and Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev. He took part in the Zaire River Expedition in 1975, travelling down the Congo River on the 100th Anniversary of Henry Morton Stanley's exploration. In 1981, he was selected to be one of the first Young Leaders of the French-American Foundation. Later career Adelman was a member of the Pentagon's Defense Policy Board well-known for his involvement in conservative policy efforts dating back to the 1970s when he was a member of the Committee on the Present Danger. He strongly supported the war on Iraq and worked for the think tank Project for the New American Century, arguing for new policies to help the United States remain a global leader. Adelman, called \\"a lifelong neocon activist\\", worried in 2006 that the incompetence shown in handling the war in Iraq would damage the neoconservative movement; neoconservatism, he said, \\"is not going to sell\\" for at least a generation. Adelman went on to become senior counsel at Edelman Public Relations, where he led several campaigns linked to U.S. trade and intellectual property interests via the organization USA Innovations, an organization he also leads. Using the USA Innovations platform and through other published articles Adelman has attacked the Thai government for violating U.S. pharmaceutical industry HIV/AIDS drug intellectual property patents and other topics linked to Edelman Public Relations clients. Adelman is also an expert on William Shakespeare and has taught extension school classes at Georgetown University and George Washington University on Shakespeare. He co-wrote with Norman R. Augustine a book on drawing leadership lessons from Shakespeare, called Shakespeare in Charge: The Bard's Guide to Leading and Succeeding on the Business Stage. He is known for invocations of Shakespeare in favor of his political positions, including an NPR analysis of a scene from Othello in support of the invasion of Iraq, and lauding President Bush as King Henry V.  Iraq war  Adelman wrote a pair of editorial columns regarding the Iraq War in the Washington Post in February 2002 and April 2003 entitled, respectively, \\"Cakewalk In Iraq\\" and \\"'Cakewalk' Revisited\\". In the first he argued that the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq would be a simple matter to accomplish: \\"I believe that demolishing Hussein's military power and liberating Iraq would be a cakewalk\\". In the later editorial, published just a few weeks after the invasion, he claimed his vindication and in particular praised key Bush administration players: \\"My confidence 14 months ago sprang from having worked for Don Rumsfeld three times—knowing he would fashion a most creative and detailed war plan—and from knowing Dick Cheney and Paul Wolfowitz well for many years\\". Also notable are Adelman's predictions regarding weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Adelman said that weapons were likely to be near Tikrit and Baghdad, \\"because they're the most protected places with the best troops. I have no doubt we're going to find big stores of weapons of mass destruction\\". Of course, he was wrong. In an article first appearing on the website of Vanity Fair in November 2006, Adelman wrote that he regrets urging military action in Iraq and feels that he overestimated the abilities of the Bush administration leadership. He was quoted as saying \\"I just presumed that what I considered to be the most competent National Security team since Truman was indeed going to be competent\\". He also added, \\"They turned out to be among the most incompetent teams in the postwar era. Not only did each of them, individually, have enormous flaws, but together they were deadly, dysfunctional\\". He wrote that the conduct of the war \\"just breaks your heart,\\" and it \\"didn't have to be managed this bad; it's awful.\\" In an article in The New Yorker, Adelman said of Rumsfeld, a friend and associate of 36 years: \\"How could this happen to someone so good, so competent? This war made me doubt the past. Was I wrong all those years, or was he just better back then? The Donald Rumsfeld of today is not the Donald Rumsfeld I knew, but maybe I was wrong about the old Donald Rumsfeld. It's a terrible way to end a career. It's hard to remember, but he was once the future.\\" Support for Barack Obama The New Yorker reported on October 20, 2008, that Kenneth Adelman decided to buck his conservative leanings and vote for Senator Barack Obama for President on November 4, 2008. According to the New Yorker, Adelman made his decision \\"primarily for two reasons, those of temperament and of judgment\\". He explained: Soon after he authored a Huffington Post article entitled Why a Staunch Conservative Like Me Endorsed Obama where he wrote, \\"Granted, McCain's views are closer to mine than Obama's. But I've learned over this Bush era to value competence along with ideology. Otherwise, our ideology gets discredited, as it has so disastrously over the past eight years\\". He added, \\"McCain's temperament—leading him to bizarre behavior during the week the economic crisis broke—and his judgment—leading him to Wasilla—depressed me into thinking that \\"our guy\\" would be a(nother) lousy conservative president. Been there, done that\\". A Reuters article quotes Adelman as saying, \\"I am a Republican and only voted for one Democrat in my entire life, and that was very much an anti-McCain vote. I thought Obama was going to be better than he turned out to be\\". Reuters also reported that he was backing Romney.

Rusinga Island, with an elongated shape approximately 10 miles (16 km) from end to end and 3 miles (5 km) at its widest point, lies in the eastern part of Lake Victoria at the mouth of the Winam Gulf. Part of Kenya, it is linked to Mbita Point on the mainland by a causeway.The Google clickable map can be found at and a road map can be found at . A district map is at Demography The local language is Luo, although the ancestors of the current inhabitants were Suba people who came in boats several hundred years ago from Uganda as refugees from a dynastic war. Many Rusinga place names portray SubaSee Suba at the ethnologue.com website. origins, including the island's name itself and its central peak, Lunene. There was an extinct language of Uganda called Singa, alternatives Lusinga and Lisinga, spoken only on Rusinga Island (which, of course is in Kenya). It belonged to the same group of Niger–Congo as Suba.See Singa at the ethnologue.com website. As of 2006, estimates of Rusinga's population range between 20,000 and 30,000. The entire island is part of the Homa Bay County. Most residents of Rusinga make their living from subsistence agriculture (maize and millet), as well as fishing. The native tilapia is still caught, though this species (like all others native to the lake) has been decimated by the voracious Nile perch that was introduced into the lake in 1954. Constant onshore winds cool the lakeward side of the island and provide clean beaches with ideal swimming and boating conditions, but poor roads between Rusinga and the nearest town, Homa Bay, inhibit trade and tourism. The brightly glittering black sands of the beaches are made of crystals of melanite garnet, barkevikite hornblende, and magnetite eroded from the uncompahgrite lava fragments in the agglomerates that overlie the fossil beds. The island is also notable as the family home and burial site of Tom Mboya, who before his assassination in 1969 was widely pegged as Jomo Kenyatta's successor as President of the new nation of Kenya. Palaeontology A 180px Rusinga is widely known for its extraordinarily rich and important fossil beds of extinct Miocene mammals, dated to 18 million years.For a Potassium-Argon determination of the date refer to Miocene Stratigraphy and Age Determinations, Rusinga Island, Kenya, article by J. A. VAN COUVERING & J. A. MILLER in Nature 221, 628 - 632 (15 February 1969). The abstract and bibliography are displayed no charge. The island had been only cursorily explored until the Leakey expedition of 1947-1948 began systematic searches and excavations, which have continued sporadically since then. The end of 1948 saw the collection of about 15,000 fossils from the Miocene, including 64 primates called by Louis Leakey \\"Miocene apes.\\" All the species of Proconsul were among the 64 and all were given the name africanus, although many were reclassified into nyanzae, major and heseloni later. Mary Leakey discovered the first complete skull of Proconsul, then considered a \\"stem hominoid\\", in 1948. Excavation of the fossil was completed by Louis' native assistant, Heselon Mukiri (whence Walker's 1993 name heseloni). Many thousands of fossils are now known from five major sites, with abundant hominoids including an almost complete skeleton of a second species of Proconsul, as well as Nyanzapithecus, Limnopithecus, Dendropithecus and Micropithecus,A University College London research article discussing finds of these fossil apes at Koru and elsewhere, including Rusinga, can be found at New Finds of Small Fossil Apes from the Miocene Locality at Koru in Kenya by T. Harrison. The article is displayed at the nyu.edu site, no charge. all of which show arboreal rather than terrestrial adaptations. The first true monkeys do not appear until around 15 million years ago, so it is widely supposed that the diverse Early Miocene African catarrhines like those found on Rusinga filled that adaptive niche. The phylogenetic position of these primates has been debated. It has been theorized that Proconsul is a stem catarrhine and therefore ancestral to both Cercopithecids (Old World monkeys) and hominids (great apes and humans), rather than a stem hominoid., Harrison T. 1987. \\"The phylogenetic relationships of the early catarrhine primates: a review of the current evidence.\\" Journal of Human Evolution 16(1), 41-80 Pleistocene mammal fossils, including an extinct antelope called Rusingoryx, notable for its nasal dome hypothesised to produce loud calls, known nowhere else, are also common in former shoreline deposits around the edges of the island, left behind as Lake Victoria has slowly subsided over the centuries due to erosion in its outlet. Geology The fossil beds are layers of volcanic ash produced by a succession of explosive eruptions during the earliest stages of a volcano that eventually covered an area 75 miles in diameter. The volcano is now eroded down to the frozen magma in its vent that makes up the Kisingiri hills on the mainland opposite Rusinga, and the surrounding remnants of the cone: the semicircular Rangwa mountain range, and the islands of Rusinga and neighboring Mfangano Island. This rift valley volcano on the southern flank of the now- inactive Winam Gulf tapped much deeper in the mantle than oceanic or subduction zone volcanos, and its lavas and explosive ash clouds thus contained much more carbonate and alkali than normal. This meant that even though the Miocene environment was a tropical rainforest, the chemistry of the successive ash beds was that of a desert dry lake, preserving everything from caterpillars and berries to apes and elephants in an unusual situation found only in a few other East African volcanos, notably Menengai and Homa Mountain in western Kenya, Napak and Mount Elgon in Uganda, and the much younger Ol Doinyo Lengai in Tanzania, which created the fossil beds of Olduvai Gorge.

Part of Kenya, it lies west of Rusinga Island. The island is 65 km² in area and rises to 1,694 m at Mount Kwitutu. It had a population of 16,282 at the 1999 census. Administratively, Mfangano is part of Homa Bay County. The island is home to the largest population of Olusuba or Suba people language speakers in Kenya. Olusuba is becoming rarer, in part because of intermarriage between Suba men and Luo women from the mainland, as it is traditional for children to learn the \\"mother tongue\\", that is, the language of their mother. Other languages spoken on the island include Luo, Swahili, and English. Members of the Luo tribe are concentrated on the eastern side of the island, most of whom are fishermen and subsistence farmers. Some of the inhabitants of Mfangano are believed to be descendants of emigrants from the Buganda kingdom in Uganda who arrived after the controversial early nineteenth century killing of the kabaka juju. Most inhabitants live near the water for ease in fishing and collecting the day's water supply. The water's edge of the island is quite rocky with a few black sandy shores. Transportation consists mostly walking and of boat travel in small wooden handmade boats that sometimes have a sail. There are a few bicycles now that the government cut a road that circles the island on which motorbikes can travel. The first car to be driven on the island's soil was on February 2, 2007. Since then, several automobiles have been seen, and others now are used locally for transport. It was driven 500 m. In it was Road and Public Services Hon. Simeon Nyachae, MP. There is a small dirt landing strip for small planes which has been improved to support other bigger planes. This is used mostly for tourists and mission workers. Apart from the above- mentioned, the government has also worked hard and ensured that there is constant electricity supply within the island by use of the generators hence this has seen growth within the region and improvement on the economic ability of the island as fishermen can now store their fish as they wait for the market. Many more is still yet to be experienced in the region with the improving tourism rate boosted by the establishment of the Abasuba Community Peace Museum in October 2009. Mfangano is also known for its ancient rock art, possibly 2,000 years old and thought to have been created by early forager- hunters, perhaps a Twa people.

Like a citation index, an acknowledgement index measures influences on scientific work, but in a different sense; it measures institutional and economic influences as well as informal influences of individual people, ideas, and artifacts. Unlike the impact factor, it does not produce a single overall metric, but analyses the components separately. However, the total number of acknowledgements to an acknowledged entity can be measured and so can the number of citations to the papers in which the acknowledgement appears. The ratio of this total number of citations to the total number of papers in which the acknowledge entity appears can be construed as the impact of that acknowledged entity.

The station formerly aired a sports format. Currently, the station features a classic oldies/MOR format, without regular on-air personalities. The station is owned by Birach Broadcasting, and has long been under a local marketing agreement (LMA) with Mike Powell. It is one of the few stations owned by Birach, a sole proprietorship whose specialty is brokered ethnic radio, to have a general entertainment format. WGOP has a construction permit with the FCC for an FM translator broadcasting on 106.5 MHz.https://transition.fcc.gov/fcc-bin/fmq?call=W293DN The call letters are W293DN. History The 540 AM frequency signed on in 1955 with the WDVM call sign which in later years was changed to WDMV (\\"Wonderful Delmarva\\") and an older MOR music format imaged as \\"Delmarvarama...America's Best Loved Music And Song.\\" In the late 1950s local radio legend \\"Choppy\\" Layton began his association with WDMV at the age of fifteen. He left the station for several years, ultimately becoming one of the principals in a new FM Station in Ocean City, Maryland, WKHI. After divesting himself of his interest in that station, \\"Choppy\\" returned to WDMV/WGOP several years ago and lends his voice to commercials and other programming, including a live interview show, broadcast from various businesses in Pocomoke on Friday mornings. WDMV was silent for several years in the mid-1990s. WDMV has had a longstanding application to move to Damascus, Maryland. The station used the WDMV call letters up until July 1, 2004. In April 2015, WGOP switched formats from Oldies to Sports Talk Radio, branded as SportsRadio 540. Later the format changed to classic country music, and is now classic oldies/classic MOR and includes some sports such as Baltimore Orioles baseball. Former programming Over the years, the station has been home to several formats. They once programmed a gospel music format, as well as oldies, country music and they even simulcast LMA partner WBEY-FM (97.9 FM). Party Line on WBEY-FM was once simulcasted on WGOP, until the station went to a sports talk format. Circa late 1950s \\"Mama's Country Youngin\\" Eddie Matherly was a popular WDMV personality. In the early 1960s the station's music format \\"Delmarvarama\\" featured \\"America's Best Loved Music And Song.\\" During that era the station promoted itself as \\"Big Signal Radio\\" in reference to its 540 AM frequency which in those days covered much of the lower and mid Eastern Shore with a strong signal. Its low frequency and abundance of water in the Eastern Shore area still allows the signal to blanket up to DC's southern suburbs, down to all of the Tidewater/Virginia Beach metro and into North Carolina.

On June 10, 2004, Pope John Paul II announced the dedication of an entire year to the Blessed Sacrament and invited the entire Church to reflect upon the Eucharist. Opening the Year Pope John Paul II stated that the idea came from scheduled events to take place in the following liturgical year. The International Eucharistic Congress was scheduled for October 10, 2004 to October 17, 2004, and would mark the opening of Year of the Eucharist. The year would close with the Ordinary Assembly of the Synod of Bishops, held from October 2, 2005 to October 29, 2005. He stated that the World Youth Day 2005 was another consideration in his decision of the dedication. He said, \\"I would like the young people to gather around the Eucharist as the vital source which nourishes their faith and enthusiasm.\\" Specifically how the year was to be celebrated was left to the particular Churches. However, Pope John Paul II offered some basic guidelines. Suggestions were also presented by the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments. In the United States, many dioceses encouraged local parishes to conduct celebrations, to examine the place of the Eucharist in parish life, to encourage Eucharistic adoration separate from the Mass, and to evaluate how Eucharistic adoration is conducted locally. Many Bishops took the time to encourage their local parishes to institute 40-hour devotions. Goals of the Year of the Eucharist Pope John Paul II made several suggestions to the Church in order to help the faithful benefit from the Year of the Eucharist. He called on Catholics to understand the Eucharist as \\"an urgent summons to testimony and evangelization,\\" providing the necessary strength to carry out the \\"charge\\" given at the end of each Mass to spread the Gospel. John Paul II also asked for a commitment to a \\"culture of the Eucharist,\\" i.e. a commitment to providing witness to God's real presence in the world. Another reflection offered by Pope John Paul II is that of the meaning of the word Eucharist: Thanksgiving. John Paul II said, \\"In Jesus, in his sacrifice, in his unconditional 'yes' to the will of the Father, is contained the 'yes', the 'thank you' and the 'amen' of all humanity.\\" He asked for a commitment to giving thanks to God, which he called a \\"'Eucharistic' attitude.\\" Notable events Among the many reflections published in honor of the year, Archbishop Alfred C. Hughes' of the Archdiocese of New Orleans wrote, \\"On this side of heaven, one cannot experience a more substantial or intense communion with Christ's presence than in the Eucharist.\\"Archbishop Alfred C. Hughes' Letter on the Year of the Eucharist This year also saw the death of Pope John Paul II on April 2, 2005 (the one who established the year itself), and the subsequent election of Pope Benedict XVI on April 19, 2005. There was an Eucharistic Congress in the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington, D.C., on September 25, 2004, the homily was given by Cardinal Francis Arinze, prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship.THE HOLY EUCHARIST UNITES HEAVEN AND EARTH Francis Cardinal Arinze The closing Mass was attended by 3,000 Catholics.

It refers to the unemployed and underemployed in capitalist society. It is synonymous with \\"industrial reserve army\\" or \\"relative surplus population\\", except that the unemployed can be defined as those actually looking for work and that the relative surplus population also includes people unable to work. The use of the word \\"army\\" refers to the workers being conscripted and regimented in the workplace in a hierarchy under the command or authority of the owners of capital. Marx did not invent the term \\"reserve army of labour\\". It was already being used by Friedrich Engels in his 1845 book The Condition of the Working Class in England. What Marx did was theorize the reserve army of labour as a necessary part of the capitalist organization of work. Prior to what Marx regarded as the start of the capitalist era in human history (i.e. before the 16th century), structural unemployment on a mass scale rarely existed, other than that caused by natural disasters and wars., chapter 2. In ancient societies, all people who could work necessarily had to work, otherwise they would starve; and a slave or a serf by definition could not become \\"unemployed\\". There was normally very little possibility of \\"earning a crust\\" without working at all, and the usual attitude toward beggars and idlers was harsh.Garraty, p. 14. Children began to work at a very early age.  Marx's discussion of the concept  Although the idea of the industrial reserve army of labour is closely associated with Marx, it was already in circulation in the British labour movement by the 1830s. Engels discussed the reserve army of labour before Marx did in Engels's famous book The Condition of the Working Class in England (1845). The first mention of the reserve army of labour in Marx's writing occurs in a manuscript he wrote in 1847, but did not publish: The idea of the labour force as an \\"army\\" occurs also in Part 1 of The Communist Manifesto, written by Marx and Engels in 1848: Marx introduces the concept of the reserve army of labour in chapter 25 of the first volume of Capital: Critique of Political Economy,Karl Marx, Das Kapital, chapter 25 twenty years later in 1867, stating the following: His argument is that as capitalism develops, the organic composition of capital will increase, which means that the mass of constant capital grows faster than the mass of variable capital. Fewer workers can produce all that is necessary for society's requirements. In addition, capital will become more concentrated and centralized in fewer hands. This being the absolute historical tendency under capitalism, part of the working population will tend to become surplus to the requirements of capital accumulation over time. Paradoxically, the larger the wealth of society, the larger the industrial reserve army will become. One could add that the larger the wealth of society, the more people it can also support who do not work. However, as Marx develops the argument further it also becomes clear that depending on the state of the economy, the reserve army of labour will either expand or contract, alternately being absorbed or expelled from the employed workforce: Marx concludes as such: \\"Relative surplus-population is therefore the pivot upon which the law of demand and supply of labour works\\". The availability of labour influences wage rates and the larger the unemployed workforce grows, the more this forces down wage rates; conversely, if there are plenty jobs available and unemployment is low, this tends to raise the average level of wages—in that case workers are able to change jobs rapidly to get better pay.  Composition of the relative surplus population  Marx discusses the army of labor and the reserve army in Capital, Chapter 14, Counteracting Factors, Section IV. The army of labor getconsists in those working class people employed in average or better than average jobs. Not every one in the working class gets one of these jobs. There are then four other categories where members of the working class might find themselves: the stagnant pool, the floating reserves, the latent reserve and pauperdom. Finally, people may leave the army and the reserve army by turning to criminality, Marx refers to such people as lumpenproletariat.Duggan, Marie Christine (2013) \\"Reserve Army of Labor and Migration\\" in the Encyclopedia of Global Human Migration, edited by E. Ness, Wiley Publishers.http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781444351071.wbeghm451/abstract * The stagnant part consists of marginalised people with \\"extremely irregular employment\\". Stagnant pool jobs are characterized by below average pay, dangerous working conditions and they may be temporary. Those caught in the stagnant pool have jobs, so the modern definition of the employed would include both the army of labor plus the stagnant pool. However, they are constantly on the lookout for something better. * The modern unemployed would refer primarily to the floating reserve, people who used to have good jobs, but are now out of work. They certainly hope that their unemployment is temporary (\\"conjunctural unemployment\\"), but they are well aware that they could fall into the stagnant pool or the pauper class. * The latent part consists of that segment of the population not yet fully integrated into capitalist production. In Marx's day, he was referring to people living off of subsistence agriculture who were looking for monetary employment in industry. In modern times, people coming from slums in developing countries where they survive largely by non-monetary means, to developed cities where they work for pay might form the latent. Housewives who move from unpaid to paid employment for a business could also form a part of the latent reserve. They are not unemployed because they are not necessarily actively looking for a job, but if capital needs extra workers, it can pull them out of the latent reserve. In this sense, the latent forms a reservoir of potential workers for industries. * Pauperdom is where one might end up. The homeless is the modern term for paupers. Marx calls them people who cannot adapt to capital's never ending change. For Marx, \\"the sphere of pauperism\\", including those still able to work, orphans and pauper children and the \\"demoralised and ragged\\" or \\"unable to work\\". Marx then analyses the reserve army of labour in detail using data on Britain where he lived.  Controversies and criticism  = Economist criticisms = Some economists such as Paul Samuelson have taken issue with Marx's concept of the reserve army of labour. Samuelson argues that much Marxian literature assumes that the mere existence of the unemployed drives down wages, when in reality is dependent upon contingent factors. (Are the unemployed easily available as replacements? Is the mere threat of replacement sufficient to get workers to accept a wage cut or does the employer have to demonstrate this is not an empty threat?) Samuelson argues that if prices also fall with money wage, then this does not mean real wages will fall. Samuelson also argues that wages will fall only until there are no more unemployed to bid it down: the reserve army can reduce wages only by decreasing its size. Samuelson's concludes that to mean that while the unemployed can reduce wages, they are incapable of reducing them to anywhere near subsistence levels before the unemployed all become employed.Samuelson, Paul \\"The Collected Scientific Papers of Paul Samuelson, Volume 1\\" MIT Press, 1996, pp.365-368 A similar argument was made by Murray Rothbard, who argued that if the reserve army lower wages by being absorbed into the ranks of the employed, then eventually it will disappear and be incapable of being a threat (that also means that the risk of perpetual impoverishment is averted). Rothbard observes that this is supported by modern market economics, which holds that unemployment lowers wages and thus ultimately eliminates itself. Thus, Rothbard concludes that the reserve army would ultimately cease to be a threat. Rothbard also argues that industries can experience an increase in demand for other works thanks to increasing productivity caused by technology, which will then decrease unemployment due to a greater demand for workers caused by expanding production capability.Rothbard, Murray, An Austrian Perspective on the History of Economic Thought: Classical economics, Ludwig von Mises Institute, 2006, pp.424-425 = Immiseration = Some writers have interpreted Marx's argument to mean that an absolute immiseration of the working class would occur as the broad historical trend. Thus, the workers would become more and more impoverished and unemployment would constantly grow.Thomas Sowell, \\"Marx's 'increasing misery' doctrine\\", American Economic Review, L, No. 1, March 1960, pp. 111-120.Thomas Sowell, Marxism: philosophy and economics. London: George Allen & Unwin, 1985, chapter 10. This is no longer credible in the light of the facts because in various epochs and countries workers' living standards have indeed improved rather than declined. In some periods, unemployment had been reduced to a very small amount. In the Great Depression, about one in four workers became unemployed, but towards the end of the post-war boom unemployment in richer countries reduced to a very low level. However, economic historian Paul Bairoch estimated in the mid-1980s that in Latin America, Africa and Asia \\"total inactivity\\" among the population was \\"on the order of 30-40% of potential working man-hours\\"—a situation without historical precedent, \\"except perhaps in the case of ancient Rome\\".Paul Bairoch, Cities and Economic Development. From the Dawn of History to the Present. London: Mansell, 1988, p. 466. Other writers, such as Ernest Mandel and Roman Rozdolsky, argued that in truth Marx had no theory of an absolute immiseration of the working class; at most, one could say that the rich-poor gap continues to grow, i.e. the wealthy get wealthier much more than ordinary workers improve their living standards. In part, the level of unemployment also seems to be based on the balance of power between social classes and state policy. Governments can allow unemployment to rise, but also implement job-creating policies, which makes unemployment levels partly a political result. If chapter 25 of Marx's Capital, Volume I is read carefully, it is plain that Marx does not actually say what many critics accuse him of.Joseph M. Gillman, The falling rate of profit. London: Dobson, 1957, pp. 146-147. Marx himself says that the \\"absolute general law of capitalist accumulation\\" is that the more that capital grows in size and value, the bigger the working class becomes and the larger the pauperized sections of the working class and the industrial reserve army become.Capital, Volume I, Penguin ed., p. 798. However, he does not say that the whole working class becomes pauperized, but rather that the part of it which is pauperized grows in size. He then carefully qualifies this argument by saying that the absolute general law is \\"like all other laws [...] modified in its working by many circumstances\\". Next, Marx says that in proportion as capital accumulates, the situation of the worker, be his payment high or low must \\"grow worse\\".Capital, Volume I, Penguin ed., p. 799. emphasis added. It is quite clear from the context though that by \\"worse\\" Marx does not primarily mean poverty. He means instead, as he says himself explicitly, that \\"all means of development of production undergo a dialectical inversion so that they become means of domination and exploitation of the producers\\". He is talking about \\"worse\\" in the sense of \\"inhuman\\", \\"more exploited\\" or \\"alienated\\". = Overpopulation = Another dispute concerns the notion of \\"overpopulation\\". In Marx's own time, Thomas Robert Malthus raised dire predictions that population growth enabled by capitalist wealth would exceed the food supply required to sustain that population. As noted, for Marx \\"overpopulation\\" was really more an ideologically loaded term or social construct and Marxists have argued there is no real problem here as enough food can be produced for all; if there is a problem, it lies in the way that food is produced and distributed. Marx argued that there are no substantive laws of population that hold good for all time; instead, each specific mode of production has its own specific demographic laws. If there was \\"overpopulation\\" in capitalist society, it was overpopulation relative to the requirements of capital accumulation. Consequently, demography could not simply just count people in various ways as it also had to study the social relations between them as well. If there are enough resources on the planet to provide all people with a decent life, the argument that there are \\"too many people\\" is rather dubious. People cannot help being born and being there, but the concept of overpopulation can easily suggest that part of the people do not really deserve to be there, or that they should not exist. From there, it is only another step to hating part of the human race and to feel justified in wiping that part out (or at least subject people to compulsory sterilization). If people believe that each human being has a right to be there and enjoy life, there cannot be \\"overpopulation\\". At most, one could say that there are too many people living in a particular area. Even so, people can get used to living with remarkably little personal space. The counter-argument is that in many poor countries people get far more children than they can reasonably feed, support and provide with a decent life under the circumstances. If people had fewer children with the aid of contraception, then it would put much less pressure on already scarce resources and enable a better life for the living. = Consent = In the social welfare area, there are also perpetual disputes about the extent to which unemployment is voluntarily chosen by people, or involuntary, whether it is forced on people or whether it is their own choice. In the Great Depression of the 1930s, when unemployment rose to 20–30% of the working population in many countries, people generally believed it was involuntary, but if unemployment levels are relatively low, the argument that unemployment is a matter of choice is more often heard. It could be that there simply are no jobs for the unemployed, but it could also be that there is a mismatch between the skills that the unemployed have and the type of skilled labour for which there is a demand. If the latter is the case, then it could be argued that if the unemployed were willing to retrain or do a different kind of work, then they could get a job. In a sense, it is always possible to get a job if a person is prepared to accept a low salary, but people might not want to work below a certain minimum amount of salary. = Measurement = There are endless debates about the best way to measure unemployment, its costs and its effects and to what extent a degree of unemployment is inevitable in any country with a developed labour market.Bob Rowthorn & Andrew Glyn, \\"The diversity of unemployment experience since 1973\\". Working paper No. 40, World Institute of Development Economics Research, Helsinki 1988; According to the NAIRU concept, price stability in market-based societies necessarily requires a certain amount of unemployment. One reason a reserve army of the unemployed exists in market economies, it is argued, is that if the level of unemployment is too low, it will stimulate price inflation. However, the validity of this argument depends also on state economic policy and on the ability of workers to raise their wages. If for example trade unions are legally blocked from organizing workers, then even if unemployment is relatively low, average wages can be kept low; the only way that individual workers have in that case to raise their income is to work more hours or work themselves up to better-paying jobs. Normally, the government measure of unemployment defines \\"unemployed\\" as \\"without any job, but actively looking for work\\". There are also people defined as \\"jobless\\", who want work yet are not, or no longer, actively looking for work because they are discouraged and so on. This official view of the matter is closely linked to the administration of unemployment benefits. To be entitled for an unemployment benefit, it is a requirement that the beneficiary is actively looking for work. = Hidden unemployment = There are also many controversies about hidden unemployment. Hidden unemployment means that people are not counted or considered as unemployed, although in reality they are unemployed. For example, young people will stay in the family home, in schooling, or in some make-work scheme because they can not find a paid job. People might also have a job, but they might be underemployed because they cannot get more working hours or they cannot get a job for which they are qualified. People might also drop out of the official labour force because they are discouraged and no longer actively looking for work; they are no longer counted as unemployed, although they are. Governments can also subsidize employment of people who would otherwise be unemployed, or put people on benefits even although they could be working. It may be that workers are hired, but that they do nothing while at work. On the one side, governments often try to make unemployment seem as low as possible because that is politically desirable. On the other side, governments also often provide \\"broader\\" and \\"narrower\\" measures of unemployment. For example, the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics provides six measures of labor underutilization (U-1, U-2, U-3, U-4, U-5 and U-6). The U-3 rate is the \\"official\\" unemployment rate.  Global reserve army of labour  Marx was writing in the mid-19th century, and his discussion of unemployment may therefore be in part out of date, especially if one considers only particular developed countries. However, his analysis may continue to be quite valid if considered globally. The ILO reports that the proportion of jobless has been steadily increasing since the beginning of the financial crisis of 2007–2008. In 2007, the ILO standard global unemployment measure stood at 169.7 million. In 2012, the ILO global unemployment rate reached 5.9% of the civilian labour force (195.4 million, or a net 25.7 million more), 0.5 percentage points higher than the 5.4% rate before the financial crisis. The official global unemployment rate was expected to have risen to 6% of the civilian labour force in 2013. Over 30 million jobs were still needed to return total employment to the level that prevailed before the financial crisis. It was expected in 2013 that globally about 205 million people would be unemployed in 2014 and 214 million in 2018.ILO, World of Work Report 2013. Geneva: ILO, 2013. However, the official total of the unemployed was subsequently (in 2017) forecast to be just over 201 million persons in that year and with an additional rise of 2.7 million expected in 2018.World employment social outlook - trends 2007. Geneva: ILO, 2017 The official world total of unemployed in the labour force is approximately equal to the total number of employed workers in the United States, Canada and Mexico put together. The official unemployment figures do not include jobless people who have dropped out of the labour force altogether because they can not find work as they include only those actually looking for work. The global unemployment rate is strongly influenced by population growth; the more population, the more unemployed and employed in absolute numbers. However, the proportion of jobless people now rises every year and is expected to continue rising for quite some time. Among the world's unemployed, the ILO estimates that roughly half the global total are young people aged 15 to 24. In the rich countries, it often does not matter so much if young people are unemployed at that age, but in the Middle East, Asia, Africa and Latin America where most of the unemployed youths are it is often a much more serious problem.  Modern academic usage  In recent years, there has been a growing use in Marxist and anarchist theory of the concept of \\"the precariat\\" to describe a growing reliance on temporary, part-time workers with precarious status who share aspects of the proletariat and the reserve army of labor. Precarious workers do work part-time or full-time in temporary jobs, but they cannot really earn enough to live on and depend partly on friends or family, or on state benefits, to survive. Typically, they do not become truly \\"unemployed\\", but they do not have a decent job to go to either.Jan Breman, \\"A bogus concept?\\", New Left Review 84, November–December 2013, pp. 130-138. Although non-employed people who are unable or uninterested in performing legal paid work are not considered among the \\"unemployed\\", the concept of \\"conjunctural unemployment\\" is used in economics nowadays. Economists often distinguish between short-term \\"frictional\\" or \\"cyclical\\" unemployment and longer-term \\"structural unemployment\\". Sometimes there is a shortterm mismatch between the demand and supply of labour, at other times there is much less total demand for labour than supply for a long time. If there is no possibility for getting a job at all in the foreseeable future, many younger people decide to migrate or emigrate to a place where they can find work.

Explanations: A – folded rock strata cut by a thrust fault; B – large intrusion (cutting through A); C – erosional angular unconformity (cutting off A & B) on which rock strata were deposited; D – volcanic dike (cutting through A, B & C); E – even younger rock strata (overlying C & D); F – normal fault (cutting through A, B, C & possibly E). Cross-cutting relationships is a principle of geology that states that the geologic feature which cuts another is the younger of the two features. It is a relative dating technique in geology. It was first developed by Danish geological pioneer Nicholas Steno in Dissertationis prodromus (1669) and later formulated by James Hutton in Theory of the Earth (1795) and embellished upon by Charles Lyell in Principles of Geology (1830).  Types  There are several basic types of cross cutting relationships: *Structural relationships may be faults or fractures cutting through an older rock. *Intrusional relationships occur when an igneous pluton or dike is intruded into pre- existing rocks. *Stratigraphic relationships may be an erosional surface (or unconformity) cuts across older rock layers, geological structures, or other geological features. *Sedimentological relationships occur where currents have eroded or scoured older sediment in a local area to produce, for example, a channel filled with sand. *Paleontological relationships occur where animal activity or plant growth produces truncation. This happens, for example, where animal burrows penetrate into pre-existing sedimentary deposits. *Geomorphological relationships may occur where a surficial feature, such as a river, flows through a gap in a ridge of rock. In a similar example, an impact crater excavates into a subsurface layer of rock. Cross-cutting relationships may be compound in nature. For example, if a fault were truncated by an unconformity, and that unconformity cut by a dike. Based upon such compound cross-cutting relationships it can be seen that the fault is older than the unconformity which in turn is older than the dike. Using such rationale, the sequence of geological events can be better understood.  Scale  andesitic dike in Peru that cuts across the lower sedimentary strata. Both the dike and the lower strata are cut by an unconformity A light-gray igneous intrusion in Sweden cut by a younger white pegmatite dike, which in turn is cut by an even younger black diabase dike Cross-cutting relationships may be seen cartographically, megascopically, and microscopically. In other words, these relationships have various scales. A cartographic crosscutting relationship might look like, for example, a large fault dissecting the landscape on a large map. Megascopic cross-cutting relationships are features like igneous dikes, as mentioned above, which would be seen on an outcrop or in a limited geographic area. Microscopic cross-cutting relationships are those that require study by magnification or other close scrutiny. For example, penetration of a fossil shell by the drilling action of a boring organism is an example of such a relationship.  Other use  Cross-cutting relationships can also be used in conjunction with radiometric age dating to effect an age bracket for geological materials that cannot be directly dated by radiometric techniques. For example, if a layer of sediment containing a fossil of interest is bounded on the top and bottom by unconformities, where the lower unconformity truncates dike A and the upper unconformity truncates dike B (which penetrates the layer in question), this method can be used. A radiometric age date from crystals in dike A will give the maximum age date for the layer in question and likewise, crystals from dike B will give us the minimum age date. This provides an age bracket, or range of possible ages, for the layer in question.

He was an unsuccessful candidate at the 1992 general election but was nominated by the Taoiseach Albert Reynolds to the 20th Seanad in 1993. Kelleher was first elected to Dáil Éireann at the 1997 general election and retained his seat at the 2002, 2007, 2011 and 2016 general elections. He was Minister of State with special responsibility for Trade and Commerce from 2009 to 2011. He previously served as the Minister of State for Labour Affairs from 2007 to 2009. He was previously the assistant Government Chief Whip. In January 2006, Kelleher became embroiled in a minor controversy when he was caught speeding outside Cashel, County Tipperary on his way to Leinster House in Dublin. He was fined and received two penalty points on his driving licence. The misdemeanour was ironic, for it came in a week when the government was coming under fire over poor road safety statistics. He retained his seat at the 2011 general election, though an opinion poll from The Irish Times had predicted that he was in danger of losing his seat. He was re-elected at the 2016 general election. He is married to Liza Davis. They have two daughters and one son. He was a cousin of Fine Gael TD Liam Burke. Kelleher was the Fianna Fáil spokesperson on Health. He had called for a rise in the legal age to purchase alcohol from off-licences.

There he was a pastor and physician to the local inhabitants. Life and cult Decuman is said to have been born of noble parents at Rhoscrowther in Pembrokeshire, Wales where the church is dedicated to him. His name comes from the Latin for a farmer of tithes, which is a smallholder who paid a rent for his farm. Decuman had a chapel at nearby Pwllcrochan. Wishing to escape from worldly companions he crossed the Bristol Channel and landed at Dunster: he then became a hermit at nearby Watchet, living from the produce of his cow. There he healed the sick and acted as a pastor to the inhabitants. There Decuman is said to have been killed by a pagan. Legend tells that the holy man's head was cut off by \\"a certain man more venomous than an asp, more poisonous than the adder....\\" Beheading is a legend which is found associated with several Celtic saints, but in this variant, the saint miraculously picks up his head, washes it, and replaces it. After this the local people assisted Decuman to build the church (Legends and Folklore of Watchet — Ben Norman).St Decuman's Holy Well, Watchet Decuman's Holy Well is located down the lane from the church at Watchet, in Somerset.Sacred Wells: A Study in the History, Meaning, and Mythology of Holy Wells Decuman is said to have died in 706, when Somerset west of the Parrett, including Watchet, was still under Celtic rule. His feast day was celebrated at Somerset on 27 February.

Beginnings Laura, Marie, Sharon and Sinead Conway were born and raised in Sligo, Ireland. The four sisters grew up with a love of music and performing, and in 2002 they formed The Conway Sisters. Throughout that year they wrote, produced, and recorded music, and played locally. In 2003, they released their first single, \\"What Do You Do?\\", which debuted in the Top 20 in Ireland, and launched a tour of Ireland. A second Top 20 single, \\"Now That It's Over\\", followed, and in 2005 their third single \\"Miss You\\", was released, which also entered the Top 20 in Ireland. Their self-financed debut album, Waiting for You, was released in May 2005. The X Factor In May 2005 the sisters auditioned for the UK television programme The X Factor in the hope that they would crack the UK market. Along with eleven other acts, they made it through to the final live stages of the competition in which viewers vote for their favourite acts. In week 5 of The X Factor knockout stages, The Conways found themselves in the final showdown for the first time, facing the judges' expulsion vote together with crowd favourite Maria Lawson. Lawson was voted off on the casting vote of Louis Walsh, prompting booing from the studio audience and fellow judge Sharon Osbourne to claim that \\"he voted with his passport\\" (referring to the fact that both Walsh and the Conway Sisters are Irish). The decision provoked controversy in the UK media, especially when it was revealed that Walsh had known the Conways personally prior to the competition. Following their nomination for expulsion and the generally negative comments of their mentor, Simon Cowell, the Conways worked for the next episode of the show without Cowell's guidance, an action which the judge said earned the group more respect from him. Despite this, Cowell persisted with negative comments when he considered them appropriate. They were eliminated in week 7, their third consecutive week in the bottom two, after Cowell voted against them – the first and so far only time that an X Factor judge had voted off their own act despite not needing to as they only had one act in the bottom two. Upon their dismissal from the competition, the group claimed that Louis Walsh had been their true mentor. Following the final of The X Factor, they performed with the other Top 7 finalists from the live shows on The X Factor Live tour at venues throughout the UK. Breakup In August 2006 on the ITV show The X Factor – One Year On, Laura Conway announced that the Conways had split up for good. On their official website they said: \\"We will be finishing up as the Conway Sisters for now, we've come to a place where we want to pursue individual career paths and now we feel ready to do that! For the record there have been no fall outs or fights, it's all been very amicable and as sisters we're closer now than ever!\\" Their official website and forum have now closed, but their MySpace profile can still be accessed. =Laura Conway= Following the split, Laura Conway announced that she intended to pursue a solo music career and had her own website and forum, but these have now closed. However, she does have an active MySpace profile and YouTube channel. =Sinead Conway= Sinead Conway currently performs with Dublin-based dance, disco and funk band, Red Shoes.

Sharps waste is a form of biomedical waste composed of used \\"sharps\\", which includes any device or object used to puncture or lacerate the skin. Sharps waste is classified as biohazardous waste and must be carefully handled. Common medical materials treated as sharps waste are hypodermic needles, disposable scalpels and blades, contaminated glass and certain plastics, and guidewires used in surgery.  Qualifying materials  In addition to needles and blades, anything attached to them, such as syringes and injection devices, is also considered sharps waste. Blades can include razors, scalpels, X-Acto knives, scissors, or any other medical items used for cutting in a medical setting, regardless of if they have been contaminated with biohazardous material. While glass and sharp plastic are considered sharps waste, their handling methods can vary. Glass items which have been contaminated with a biohazardous material are treated with the same concern as needles and blades, even if unbroken. If glass is contaminated, it is still often treated as a sharp, because it can break during the disposal process. Contaminated plastic items which are not sharp can be disposed of in a biohazardous waste receptacle instead of a sharps container. Dangers involved  Injuries from sharps waste can pose a large public health concern, as used sharps may contain biohazardous material. It is possible for this waste to spread blood-borne pathogens if contaminated sharps penetrate the skin. The spread of these pathogens is directly responsible for the transmission of blood-borne diseases, such as hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C (HCV), and HIV. Health care professionals expose themselves to the risk of transmission of these diseases when handling sharps waste. The large volume handled by health care professionals on a daily basis increases the chance that an injury may occur. The general public can occasionally be at risk of sustaining injuries from sharps waste as well when hypodermic needles are improperly disposed of by injection drug users.  Sharps containers  A sharps container is specially designed for safe disposal of sharps waste. A sharps container is a hard plastic container that is used to safely dispose of hypodermic needles and other sharp medical instruments, such as IV catheters and disposable scalpels. They are often sealable and self-locking, as well as rigid, which prevents waste from penetrating or damaging the sides of the container. In the United States, sharps containers are usually red and marked with the universal biohazard symbol for ease of recognition. Elsewhere, they are often yellow. Waste is loaded into the container until it reaches a certain height, which is usually around three-quarters of the way full. At that point, the container is emptied or disposed of. Sharps containers may be single use, in which case they are disposed of along with the waste they contain, or reusable, in which case they are robotically emptied and sterilized before being returned for re-use. Airports and large institutions commonly have sharps containers available in restrooms for safe disposal for users of injection drugs, such as insulin-dependent diabetics. Medical facilities and laboratories are also equipped with sharps containers, as well as the equipment required to safely sterilize or dispose of them. This minimizes the distance the containers have to travel and the number of people to come in contact with the sharps waste. Smaller clinics or offices in the US without such facilities are required by federal regulations to hire the services of a company that specializes in transporting and properly disposing of the hazardous wastes.  Disposal of sharps waste  Extreme care must be taken in the management and disposal of sharps waste. The goal in sharps waste management is to safely handle all materials until they can be properly disposed of. The final step in the disposal of sharps waste is to dispose of them in an autoclave. A less common approach is to incinerate them; typically only chemotherapy sharps waste is incinerated. Steps must be taken along the way to minimize the risk of injury from this material, while maximizing the amount of sharps material disposed. Strict hospital protocols and government regulations that instruct health care providers on how to manage sharps waste help ensure that the waste is handled as effectively and safely as possible. Disposal methods vary by country and locale, but common methods of disposal are either by truck service or, in the United States, by disposal of sharps through the mail. Truck service involves trained personnel collecting sharps waste, and often medical waste, at the point of generation, and hauling it away by truck to a destruction facility. Similarly, the mail-back sharps disposal method allows generators to ship sharps waste to the disposal facility directly through the U.S. mail in specially designed and approved shipping containers. Mail-back sharps disposal allows waste generators to dispose of smaller amounts of sharps more economically than if they were to hire out a truck service. Recent legislation in France has stated that pharmaceutical companies supplying self injection medications are responsible for the disposal of spent needles. Previously popular needle clippers and caps are no longer acceptable as safety devices, and either sharps box or needle destruction devices are required.  Injection technology  With more than sixteen billion injections administered annually worldwide,WHO World Health Organization (2004). Proposed agenda to evaluate the risks and benefits associated with using needle-removing devices. Switzerland. needles are the largest contributor to sharps waste. For this reason, many new technologies surrounding injections have been developed, mostly related to safety mechanisms. As these technologies have been developed, governments have attempted to make them commonplace to ensure sharps waste safety. In 2000, the Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act was passed, along with the 2001 Bloodborne Pathogens Standard. Safety syringes help reduce occurrences of accidental needlesticks. One of the most recent developments has been the auto-disable injection device. These injection devices automatically disable after a single use. This can be done by retracting the needle back into the syringe or rendering the syringe plunger inoperable. With the injection device now inoperable, it cannot be reused. Shielding the needle after the injection is another approach for safe management of sharps. These are hands free methods usually involving a hinging cap that can be pressed on a table to seal the needle. Another technology in sharps waste management relating to injections is the needle remover. Varying approaches can be taken with the main goal to separate the needle from the syringe. This allows the sharp needle to be quarantined and disposed of separately from the syringe. There is debate around the use of these devices, as they involve in additional step in the handling of sharps waste.  In the developing world  Sharps waste is of great concern in developing and transitional regions of the world. Factors such as high disease prevalence and lack of health care professionals amplify the dangers involved with sharps waste, and the cost of newer disposal technology makes them unlikely to be used. As with the rest of the world, injection wastes make up the largest portion of sharps waste. However, injection use is much more prevalent in this world segment. One of the contributors to this increase is a larger emphasis placed on injections for therapeutic purposes. It has been estimated that 95% of all injections in developing regions are for therapeutic purposes. The average person has been estimated to receive up to 8.5 injections per year. Newly developed injection technologies are rarely used to provide these injections due to added costs. Therefore, the majority of injections are given with standard disposable syringes in developing regions.Needle Remover Harner, C. (2004, October). Needle Remover Device Design Transfer Package. Retrieved September 7, 2005. The infrastructure of developing regions is not equipped to deal with this large volume of contaminated sharps waste. Contrary to the industrialized world, disposal incinerators and transportation networks are not always available. Cost restraints make the purchase of single use disposable containers unrealistic. Facilities are often overwhelmed with patients and understaffed with educated workers. Demand on these facilities can limit the emphasis or enforcement of waste disposal protocols. These factors leave a dangerous quantity of sharps waste in the environment. Contrasts between the industrialized and developing world segment can be seen in accidental needle stick injuries. These occur at a rate of .18 to .74 per person per year in industrialized nations and .93 to 4.68 per person per year in developing and transitional nations (Hutin, Hauri, Armstrong, 2003). Improper sharps management is a major factor involved in what is categorized as unsafe injections. Annually these account for 21 million, 2 million, and 260,000 of new HBV, HCV, and HIV infections annually. 40-65% of new HBV and HCV are due to percutaneous occupational exposure.

Sampoerna is the largest Indonesian tobacco company, ahead of Gudang Garam, Djarum, and Bentoel Group. It produces kretek-type clove cigarettes. A typical brand is Sampoerna 'A' Mild, a filter cigarette in white paper. History In the 1930s, Liem Seeng Tee (Lin Shengdi) adopted the Indonesian name Sampoerna (in Dutch spelling, cf. sempurna) meaning \\"perfection\\" as his family name, thus becoming the company's namesake. Sampoerna began producing Dji Sam Soe in 1913 in Surabaya, East Java. Following Seeng Tee's death in 1956, his two daughters took over the running of the company, while his two sons ran separate tobacco- related businesses. The daughters shifted the company's focus toward white cigarettes, which nearly caused bankruptcy for Sampoerna. Youngest son Liem Swie Ling, who ran a kretek factory in Bali, returned to Surabaya in 1959 to rescue the company. He shifted production back to hand-rolled Dji Sam Soe brand cigarettes. In 1968, the company launched Sampoerna A Hijau. By the mid-1970s, the company was producing over 1 million cigarettes daily and had 1,200 staff. Swie Ling in the 1970s began to hand over the running of the company to his second-eldest son, Liem Tien Pao, better known as Putera Sampoerna, who went on to modernize the company and expand its operations. In 19 October 1990, Sampoerna A Mild was launched. In May 2005, Philip Morris International, at that time a subsidiary of Altria, completed the acquisition of 97.95% of the company. HM Sampoerna's current president is Paul Norman Janelle. At the end of May 2014, Sampoerna closed its Lumajang and Jember factories and laid off 4,900 employees due to declining sales of hand-rolled kretek cigarette as consumers moved to buy machine-made kretek cigarettes. In late April 2020, Sampoerna temporarily closed its factories in Rungkut, East Java after two of its labourers died of the COVID-19 pandemic. The factory's closure is unlikely to affect the company's total production as Sampoerna has cigarette factories in several other locations. In 2010, the company was criticized for its approach to \\"corporate social responsibility\\" efforts when Mount Merapi in Central Java began erupting. The disaster relief teams which \\"aim to augment efforts by a stretched Indonesian government to house, clothe and feed evacuees from the volcano,\\" were criticized for \\"the flashy four- wheel drive vehicles,\\" and \\"the cluster of eager staffers wearing natty red and black uniforms covered with company logos.\\" References  External links  * Category:Tobacco companies of Indonesia Category:Companies based in Surabaya Category:Companies established in 1913 Category:Cigarette brands Category:Indonesian brands Category:Sampoerna family Category:Philip Morris International Category:1913 establishments in the Dutch East Indies Category:Companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange ","title":"Sampoerna"},{"id":"3410768","text":"Sakaemachi, Jūsō is an area in Yodogawa-ku in north central Osaka, Japan. The core of the area is Jūsō Station, the hub station of the Hankyu Railway system. The area typifies the unique culture of Osaka. Situated across the Yodo River from central Osaka, Jūsō is centrally located for easy access by Hankyu Railway lines to other major Kansai cities: 24 minutes to Kobe (Kobe- Sannomiya Station) to the west and 40 minutes to Kyoto (Kawaramachi Station) to the northeast. Predominantly known as the pink area of Osaka, Jūsō has a robust red light district area in the Hommachi West area. Jūsō is also famous for its wide variety of high quality classic Osaka cuisine featuring okonomiyaki, negiyaki, and takoyaki shops. In August every year, a massive fireworks celebration takes place beside the Yodo River; the people who attend this celebration often wear traditional yukatas and wooden sandals. History The name Jūsō is written with the kanji for \\"thirteen.\\" One theory as the origin of the name states that it was originally the thirteenth stop on the Yodo River going from Kyoto to Osaka Bay. A less popular theory holds that the name originated in numbering under the old land allocation system. Jūsō Station opened in 1910 as a stop on the Minoo-Arima Electric Railway (now the Hankyu Takarazuka Line). The area became part of Osaka City in 1925.

Cricket writer Colin Bateman noted that \\"Capel was one of those unfortunate cricketers who became tagged as being the next all-rounder to fill Ian Botham's boots\\". He was well known for his long stint with Northamptonshire as a player as well as coach for nearly 32 years. He was regarded as one of the icons of the Northamptonshire club. He died on 2 September 2020, at the age of 57, after being diagnosed with a brain tumour in 2018. Playing career An irrepressible enthusiast, Capel was a batsman who bowled but, because of his dual role, found himself pushed down the order. He joined Northampton county in 1980 as an \\"apprentice cricketer\\" without much experience and made his first-class debut in 1981 against the visiting Sri Lankans. He played in 313 first-class matches, scoring 12,202 runs and taking 546 wickets. Capel also featured in 345 List A matches scoring 7,011 runs and taking 237 wickets. He spent most of his playing career with Northamptonshire, representing the club in 270 first-class matches and 300 List A matches. He retired from first-class cricket in 1998. He made his international Test match debut against Pakistan in 1987 at Headingley, becoming the first Northamptonshire-born cricketer in 77 years to represent England in test cricket after George Thompson. He walked to the crease when England were at 31 for 5 and scored a fifty against Imran Khan and Wasim Akram. He eventually top scored in England's first innings total of 136 with 53 off 161 balls. He registered his career best of 98 in punishing conditions in Karachi against Pakistan in 1987–88, in his fourth Test match in his career. However, he followed it up with a string of poor scores and was discarded with a batting average below 20 and a bowling average above 50 in both forms of the international game. He dismissed Viv Richards three times in his career, as well as forming part of the pace quartet which won in Jamaica in 1989–90. He ended up playing fifteen Tests and twenty-three One Day Internationals (ODIs) for England.  Later career  After retiring from playing competitive cricket in 1998, Capel became the director of excellence of the Northamptonshire County Cricket Club in 1999. Capel also eventually took over the academy at Northamptonshire. He became the head coach of the Northamptonshire County Cricket Club in 2006, replacing Kepler Wessels. He served as the head coach of the county until 2012. On 2 July 2012, Northants Cricket sacked him from the position of head coach of the club following the conclusion of the 2012 Twenty20 Cup. It ended his 32-year-long association with the club. After eight years as the head coach of Northamptonshire, Capel became the assistant coach of the England women's cricket team in 2013, staying in the role until 2015. In October 2016, he was appointed by the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) as the head coach of the Bangladesh women's cricket team, initially for an agreed period of four months. However, his contract was extended by the BCB, and he served as Bangladesh women's team head coach until 2018. In May 2020, he was inducted into the Northamptonshire CCC Hall of Fame. Capel underwent surgery in 2018 after being diagnosed with a brain tumour. Having battled the condition for two years, he died from complications on 2 September 2020.; References External links * Category:1963 births Category:2020 deaths Category:English cricketers Category:England Test cricketers Category:England One Day International cricketers Category:Northamptonshire cricketers Category:Eastern Province cricketers Category:Marylebone Cricket Club cricketers Category:Northamptonshire Cricket Board cricketers Category:English cricket coaches Category:Test and County Cricket Board XI cricketers Category:Deaths from brain tumor Category:Deaths from cancer in England ","title":"David Capel"},{"id":"3410839","text":"Loudmouth(s) may refer to: * Loudmouth (band), an American rock band * Loudmouth (The Boomtown Rats album) * Loudmouth (Jim Bianco album) * The Loud Mouth, a 1932 short comedy film * Loudmouth Golf, an American sportswear company * Loudmouths, a New York sports-debate TV show * \\"Loudmouth\\", a song by the Ramones from Ramones *\\"Loudmouth Education and Training\\", a U.K. Theatre in Education company.

It is similar to (and frequently confounded with) the balsam of Peru. It is tapped from the living trunks of Myroxylon balsamum (see Myroxylon). It is a brownish, sticky, semisolid mass. An essential oil is also distilled from the balsam. The balsam contains a fairly large amount of benzyl and cinnamyl esters of benzoic and cinnamic acid (benzyl benzoate, benzyl cinnamate). Uses The resin is still used in certain cough syrup formulas. However its main use in the modern era is in perfumery, where it is valued for its warm, mellow yet somewhat spicy scent. It is also used as a natural remedy for skin rashes. It is a well known cause of contact dermatitis, a form of skin allergy. Tolu has begun to be used in the niche perfume industry, notably by Ormonde Jayne Perfumery, which launched its oriental perfume Tolu in 2002, and also in 2010 by Esteban, which launched Baume Tolu. History In 1841, Henri Étienne Sainte-Claire Deville isolated toluene by the dry distillation of tolu balsam. The resin is used in traditional medicine by the people of Central America and South America. It is named for Tolú, one the pre-Columbian indigenous people of the North Colombia lowlands.

History =Haro Designs= The company was founded in 1978 by Bob Haro, who began by producing number plates for BMX bikes in his home. Demand for the plates quickly outgrew his one-man capacity. Haro Designs, as the company was first named, was formed in 1980 with headquarters in Torrance, California. As the company grew, Haro helped develop the sport of freestyle BMX. He travelled around the United States demonstrating radical trick-riding that had not been seen anywhere before. As a result, Haro earned the title \\"The Father of Freestyle.\\" During the early 1980s, the BMX boom continued. The company expanded its product line and established national and international distribution. During this time, the company gained a reputa for developing innovative BMX and freestyle bikes and accessories. Haro Bikes' most popular BMX/Freestyle models were the Master and the Sport. =Haro 1983 - 1987: Unique Bike Innovation= Haro introduced its first successful line of Freestyle BMX bikes in 1983. The Haro Sport and Master were the company's flagship bikes that sparked a revolution in bicycle design and imitation across the industry by other companies. In that year, its revenue greatly took off and it ignited a huge cult following. In 1984, the company added the FST to its product line-up for consumers with lower budgets. As a result of Haro's huge success, companies like Hutch, Diamond Back, GT, Schwinn, Redline, Dyno, CW and Skyway modeled their own frame versions after Haro's designs. During the 80s, GT became Haro's strongest competitor. However, because of Haro's huge profits from the Sport, GT's sales dwindled in comparison. Haro possessed the best Freestyle team, dominating the 80s, 90s and 2000s. It won the most first places and top honors more than any other bike team. It contracted the most popular Freestylers in the history of the sport: Mike Dominguez, Donovan Ritter, Marc McGlynn, Bryan Blyther, Dave Nourie, Mat Hoffman, Dennis Mccoy, Ron Wilkerson, Joe Johnson, Ryan Nyquist, Dave Mirra, Rick Moliterno, Bob Morales, Eddie Fiola, Rich Sigur, and R.L. Osborn, not to mention other significant riders. During the 1980s GT struggled against bike company, Haro Bikes which dominated the freestyle BMX landscape and industry. As Haro was the most popular freestyle BMX bike at the time, it eclipsed GT in all categories especially in the number of bikes sold, number of sponsored freestyle riders and number of wins and trophies in competitions throughout the 80s and 90s. =Haro Bikes= The first Haro bikes were manufactured by Torker. In 1982, when Haro introduced his own line of racing bikes, his sponsorship by Torker and Max was terminated. Although injuries forced Haro to relinquish his riding duties, Haro Bikes subsequently compiled a virtual \\"who's who\\" list of talented riders including Bob Morales, Mike Dominguez, Dennis McCoy, Ron Wilkerson, Matt Hoffman, Donovan Ritter, Marc McGlynn, Brian Blyther, Dave Nourie, Mike King, Pete Loncarevich ,Tony\\"The Tiger\\"Murray and many more. These riders won nearly every title there was in both BMX and freestyle. Media attention quickly put Haro Bikes in the spotlight as an industry leader with a bicycle line focused on the high end \\"Master\\" and more moderate \\"Sport\\". In 1986, Haro's design of the \\"Master\\" was at its climax with what is typically regarded as its most beautiful form with uniquely designed Haro Group 1 components, paint over chrome frame and forks, and uniquely designed flip-up pegs. The 1986 \\"Master\\" in team issue neon green with all original components has become highly collectible. In 1987, The \\"Master\\" was made over to reduce the cost of the 1986 model. =Company's sale= In 1988, Bob Haro sold the company to a bigger bike company and agreed to a five-year consulting contract that provided continuing product innovation and a premium image for the brand. At the end of five years Bob left Haro Bikes and started a graphic design company. In 1993, the company was sold again, this time to a group of investors headed by Jim Ford, a Vice President at Haro Bikes since 1981. With its new independence, and Jim leading the company as its President, the company re-established its focus on Bob Haro's original vision and began a rebuilding process that followed a sharp decline in the BMX market dating back to 1988. Within one year, key management positions were filled and a new dealer base was established. A new competitive BMX racing team was formed and superstar freestyle riders Dave Mirra and Ryan Nyquist were signed by Haro soon after. =Reputation re-established= Haro's new products re-established its reputation for innovation and performance. By 1999, sales had exploded and Haro Bikes was again recognized as one of the top brands of BMX and freestyle bikes. The sport's popularity has reached new heights, thanks to greater television exposure ESPN's X-Games and NBC's Gravity Games. In fact, Haro Bikes sponsored riders have combined to win over ten medals since the X-Games started in 1996, the most of any bike company. Dave Mirra is the most decorated X-Games athlete with eight medals, six of them gold. Recently, Haro Bikes has taken major steps to establish its presence in the mountain bike market by signing former UCI World Champion Downhiller Mike King and the current UCI World Champion Cross Country racer, Michael Rasmussen of Denmark. Before his death in 2016, Dave Mirra had left and made his own company Mirraco Bikes in 2007... an enterprise of Trek Bicycle Corporation. Ending his run with the Haro Brand. As of 2019 Haro Bikes sponsors freestyle BMX riders Ryan Nyquist, Dennis Enarson, Chad Kerly, Matthias Dandois, Mike Gray and Dennis McCoy. They also sponsor BMX racers Nic Long and Brooke Crain.

WTNT is owned and operated by Metro Radio. 730 kHz is a Canadian and Mexican clear-channel frequency. The station flipped formats to a Spanish music and talk format dubbed \\"La Capital\\" on December 1, 2013. History WTNT signed on as WPIK December 10, 1945. For many years this station operated as the AM side to country station WXRA 105.9 FM, and for another period as WPKX \\"Kix Country.\\" For a time 730 simulcast 105.9's next incarnation, classic rock, as WCXR. For a short while in the mid-1980s, the station featured a soul oldies format. It was also WRMR with a nostalgia format for a very short while (not to be confused with the Cleveland, Ohio market WRMR). In 1987, it took the call letters WCPT, and became WBZS in May 1995. The station was owned by Metropolitan Broadcasting until 1989, Westinghouse Broadcasting from 1989 to 1993, and Viacom from 1993 to 1997. In July 1990, WCPT adopted a simulcast of CNN Headline News. From May 1995 to April 1999, WBZS offered a business news brokered financial advice format. Then, Mega Communications bought the station and installed a Mexican/tropical music format as \\"Radio Capital.\\" The call letters changed again in October 2000 to WKDL, call letters that were previously held on what is currently WBQH. This format, along with its FM sisters, lasted until the launch of \\"Triple X\\" in July 2006. The WXTR calls were installed at this point; the call letters were used in the past on different stations in the Washington area on two different stations (at 104.1 FM and 820 AM). In addition, Red Zebra planned to acquire WGYS 103.9 FM in Braddock Heights, Maryland and WGMS 104.1 FM in Waldorf, Maryland via a recent acquisition with Bonneville International, but called the deal off weeks later. Media Web site DCRTV.com first reported on July 24, 2010 that WXTR had dropped the Spanish Sports Radio programming of ESPN Deportes Radio and switched to a \\"pop and soul oldies\\" format, calling itself \\"Non-Stop Classic Hits, XTRA-AM\\". WXTR would quickly pick ESPN Deportes Radio days later. DCRTV.com would again report that on October 9, 2010 that WXTR would drop Spanish Sports Radio for Oldies. WXTR's Spanish radio website and webstream was down as of October 13, 2010. The web site Radio Business Report reported the flip, quoting a station exec as saying the station would fill \\"a void in the marketplace\\". WXTR also revived the \\"XTRA Oldies\\" nickname, which was used on the FM dial at the 104.1 FM facility. For the short amount of time the format was carried, it was the only AM station broadcasting English-language music on a full-time basis in the Washington D.C./Baltimore area. However, this change lasted only several days, as Red Zebra announced that WXTR would be sold off to Metro Radio that October 18. The WTNT call letters were moved from the 570 kHz facility, which changed to the WSPZ call letters, and picked up WTNT's previous conservative talk format, which was dropped for sports/talk in early September. WTNT must power down to 25 watts at night in order to protect clear-channel CKAC in Montreal, rendering it all but unlistenable at night. In 2006, while it was still WXTR under Snyder's ownership, it sought to boost its power to 28,000 watts in the daytime and 20,000 watts in the night hours. The power boost would have given WXTR coverage comparable to the other major AM stations in the capital.

The checker shadow illusion is an optical illusion published by Edward H. Adelson, Professor of Vision Science at MIT in 1995. Description The image depicts a checkerboard with light and dark squares, partly shadowed by another object. The optical illusion is that the area labeled A appears to be a darker color than the area labeled B. However, within the context of the two-dimensional image, they are of identical brightness, i.e., they would be printed with identical mixtures of ink, or displayed on a screen with pixels of identical colour.  Verification  A rectangle of the same color has been drawn connecting the two areas of the image. That the two squares are the same color can be proven using any of the following methods: *Open the illusion in an image editing program and using the eyedropper tool to verify that the colors are the same. *Right-click the image and select \\"View Image\\". Now zoom in to the image and hold a finger in front of your face, blocking out the connecting square. Since your finger is a different color and not merely a tone, your eyes will be able to compare A and B individually. *Cut out a cardboard mask. By viewing patches of the squares without the surrounding context, you can remove the effect of the illusion. A piece of cardboard with two circles removed will work as a mask for a computer screen or for a printed piece of paper. *Connect the squares with a rectangle of the same color, as seen in the figure to the right. *Use a photometer. *Print the image and cut out the squares. Cut out each square along the edges. Remove them. Hold them side by side. *Isolate the squares. Without the surrounding context, the effect of the illusion is dispelled. This can be done by using the eyedropper tool in image editing programs, such as Gimp to sample the values of A & B, and to color in the newly adjacent rectangles using the paint bucket tool.

Following the departure of former bassist/vocalist Martin VanDrunen, guitarist Patrick Mameli took over vocal duties. Mameli steered the band towards a more melodic and technical approach. The resulting concept album, Testimony of the Ancients contrasted brutal death metal riffs with melodic interludes and tackled what John Serba describes as, \\"strangely philosophical, and oddly compelling, subject matter\\". After each song on the album, there was an instrumental outro track. This attempt to push the boundaries of death metal, at a time when the scene was saturated with copycat \\"one track minded\\" bands, mirrored the efforts of fellow progressive bands Atheist and Death who released Unquestionable Presence and Human respectively in 1991, the same year as Testimony. The album can also be seen as a stepping stone on the way to the following Pestilence album Spheres, which departed still further from traditional death metal and headed towards jazz fusion. Testimony of the Ancients was reissued, along with Consuming Impulse, on Roadrunner Records' Two from the Vault series.

Discovery and naming In 2000 David Martill and Eberhard Frey reported the find of a small dinosaur fossil present in a chalk nodule, illegally acquired by the German Staatliches Museum für Naturkunde Karlsruhe from an illegal Brazilian fossil dealer who had indicated the piece had been uncovered in the Chapada do Araripe, specifically at Araripina, Pernambuco.D.M. Martill, E. Frey, H.-D. Sues and A.R.I. Cruickshank, 2000, \\"Skeletal remains of a small theropod dinosaur with associated soft structures from the Lower Cretaceous Santana Formation of northeastern Brazil\\", Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences 37(6): 891-900 In 2004 the type species Mirischia asymmetrica was named and described by Martill, Frey and Darren Naish. The generic name combines the Latin mirus, 'wonderful', with \\"ischia\\", the Latinised plural of Greek ἴσχιον, ischion, 'hip joint'. The specific name asymmetrica refers to the fact that in the specimen the left ischium differs from its right counterpart. The holotype, SMNK 2349 PAL, has its probable provenance in the Romualdo Formation of the Santana Group, dating from the Albian. It consists of a partial articulated skeleton, largely consisting of the pelvis and incomplete hind limbs, including two posterior dorsal vertebrae, a rib, gastralia, partial ilia, pubes and ischia, partial thigh bones and the upper parts of the right tibia and fibula. In front of the pubes, a piece of a petrified intestine is present. The specimen represents a subadult individual. Description Cratoavis being attacked by Mirischia Mirischia was a small bipedal predator. Its length was in 2004 estimated at 2.1 metres. In 2010 Gregory S. Paul estimated the weight at seven kilogrammes.Paul, G.S., 2010, The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs, Princeton University Press p. 123 The holotype of Mirischia is notable for having asymmetrical ischia. Quoting from Naish et al. (2004): \\"The ischia of Mirischia are asymmetrical, that on the left being perforated by an oval foramen while that on the right has an open notch in the same position.\\" The specimen is also unusual in that it preserves some soft tissue remains: apart from the intestine, what the describers interpreted to have been an air sac was preserved between its pubic and ischial bones in the form of a vacuity. Previous workers had suggested that non-avian theropods might — like birds — possess post-cranial air sacs, and Mirischia seems to confirm that. Another notable trait is the exceptional thinness of the bone wall of all skeletal elements. Phylogeny In 2004 Mirischia was assigned to the Compsognathidae, as closely related to Compsognathus from the Upper Jurassic of Europe and Aristosuchus from the Lower Cretaceous of England. It would then be the only compsognathid known from the Americas.Naish, D., Martill D.M., and Frey, E., 2004, \\"Ecology, Systematics and Biogeographical Relationships of Dinosaurs, Including a New Theropod, from the Santana Formation (?Albian, Early Cretaceous) of Brazil\\", Historical Biology. 2004: 1-14 In 2010 Naish suggested it may have instead been a basal member of the Tyrannosauroidea.Naish, Darren. 2010.

Accordingly, they were known as NKVD Border Troops and KGB Border Troops (with Russian abbreviations – НКВД СССР/- КГБ СССР added on the end of official names). Unlike border guards of many other countries, Soviet Border Troops also included the maritime border guarding units (i.e., a coast guard). The mission of the Border Troops included repulsing armed incursions into Soviet territory; preventing illegal crossings of the border or the transport of weapons, explosives, contraband or subversive literature across the border; monitoring the observance of established procedures at border crossing points; monitoring the observance by Soviet and foreign ships of navigation procedures in Soviet territorial waters; and assisting state agencies in the preservation of natural resources and the protection of the environment from pollution. Border guards were authorized to examine documents and possessions of persons crossing the borders and to confiscate articles; to conduct inquiries in cases of violations of the state border; and to take such actions as arrest, search and interrogation of individuals suspected of border violations. They became the Border Service of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation on December 30, 1993. History In 1934, under the NKVD, Border Troops were immediately subordinated to the GUPVO (abbreviated \\"Chief Directorate of Border and Internal Guard\\"). In 1939 they were reorganized into the GUPV (\\"Chief Directorate of Border Troops\\"). NKVD Border Troops consisted of infantry, cavalry, reconnaissance, naval and airforce units. Since the 1920s, the distinctive part of Soviet Border Troops uniform was the medium-green colored parts of headwear and insignia (Russian Empire's Separate Corps of the Border Guard has it distinction since 1893). The color is also present on a maritime Border Troops ensign. =World War II= After the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, the Border Troops assisted the pacification of the newly acquired Soviet territory adjoining the state border. The mass execution of Romanian civilians known as the Fântâna Albă massacre happened at this time. Border Troops units on the western USSR frontier saw particularly fierce combat in the first weeks of the German invasion of the USSR (June–July 1941). They bore the brunt of the initial German assault, and due to this, suffered high casualty rates. Border Troop servicemen were among the defenders of the Brest Fortress. On June 22, 1941, border guards of the NKVD of the BSSR entered into battle with the forces of Nazi Germany, which began the war with the USSR. For the courage and heroism shown in the battles for Belarus, thousands of border guards were awarded orders and medals, and 66 became Heroes of the Soviet Union, including six Belarus border guards. The first border battles of June 22–23 were extremely fierce. The border guards had to fight with superior enemy forces, which possessed absolute superiority in military equipment, but not a single outpost departed without an order. The newspaper Pravda on the third day of the war, June 24, 1941, wrote: “Like lions, the Soviet border guards fought, taking the first sudden blow of a vile enemy. Chekist fighters have covered themselves with immortal glory. They fought hand-to-hand, and only through their dead bodies could the enemy advance an inch”. Georgy Zhukov said: “I do not believe in gods, but if they exist, then they are border guards. They performed a miracle”. Defenders of the Brest Fortress covered themselves with unfading glory, where the personnel of the 17th (Brest) detachment fought together with the soldiers of the Red Army. The feat of the border guards of the 9th outpost under the command of Lieutenant Kizhevatov A.M. The 3rd outpost of the 86th Augustovski Detachment (), commanded by Lieutenant Usov was also involved in heavy fighting for nine hours. Three artillery attacks and seven violent attacks were repelled by border guards. And only when the Soviet soldiers ran of armory, the Nazis were able to capture the trenches. In the last hand-to-hand fight, Lieutenant Usov was also killed. Border troops from other parts of the Soviet border were also involved in the fighting of the war. Notably, the 105th, 157th, and 333rd Border Troops regiments (operating like regular army units) took part in the Battle for Berlin in 1945. During and after the war, 150 border guards were awarded the title of the Hero of the Soviet Union and over 13,000 of them were decorated with different orders and medals. =Post-War history= KGB Border Troops wearing the Spetsodezhda at the Khorgos Soviet-Chinese frontier post security electric fence KS-185 In wartime, the Border Troops would become a frontline combat service. The Border Troops also saw combat in 1969 in border clashes with Chinese soldiers on islands in the Ussuri River. After the formation of the KGB, Soviet Border Troops became subordinated to this agency and remained so until the dissolution of the Soviet Union. As such, the Troops were concentrating on the tasks of preventing espionage infiltrations. The Border Guards were involved in the Soviet–Afghan War and a number of them were even awarded the Hero of the Soviet Union for their bravery during these conflicts. The Soviet border was the longest in the world and it comprised harsh terrain and climates; accordingly the Border Troops employed significant manpower, intensive maritime presence, and a dense and sophisticated system of field engineering devices. The most notable in that system was the trace-control strip () - a primitive labour-demanding method making surface crossing virtually impossible. The Border Troops consisted of conscripts drafted by the same system as for the Soviet Army, and a small number of professional enlistees. Officers were trained in specialized academies. Both conscripts and officer candidates for Border Troops were carefully selected and checked by the KGB. This made service in the troops privileged.

Article 28 defined the basic duties of the Border Troops. Their duties included repulsing armed incursions into Soviet territory; preventing illegal crossings of the border or the transport of weapons, explosives, contraband, or subversive literature across the border; monitoring the observance of established procedures at border crossing points; monitoring the observance by Soviet and foreign ships of navigation procedures in Soviet territorial waters; and assisting state agencies in the preservation of natural resources and the protection of the environment from pollution. Border guards were authorized to examine documents and possessions of persons crossing the borders and to confiscate articles; to conduct inquiries in cases of violations of the state border; and to take such actions as arrest, search, and interrogation of individuals suspected of border violations. Structure The Border Troops strength was estimated in 1989 to be in the range of 230,000 men. Although under the operational authority of the KGB, the Border Troops were conscripted as part of the biannual call-up of the Ministry of Defense, and their induction and discharge were regulated by the 1967 Law on Universal Military Service, which covered all armed forces of the Soviet Union.http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi- bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+su0535%29 On top of the Border Troops stood the Main Directorate of the Border Troops (MDBT, Russian: Главное управление пограничных войск), which played a role similar to that of the General Staff for the armed forces. The Main Directorate was subordinated to the First Deputy Chairman of the KGB (the second highest ranking official in the Committee). The Commander of the Border Troops normally held the rank of Lieutenant general when he took over the position and later was promoted to Colonel general. Out of the three officers who commanded the troops the second one (Vadim Alexandrovich Matrosov) has reached the rank of Army general at that position. The Commander had several Lieutenant generals and Major generals as his deputies. The Main Directorate administered approximately nine border districts (pogranichnye okruga), which covered the nearly 63,000 kilometers of the state border and additional smaller formations and independent units. Border district boundaries were distinct from civil or military district boundaries.http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi- bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+su0535%29 At the time of the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 the Border Troops included the following operational forces: = Main Directorate of the Border Troops =  Main Directorate of the Border Troops  Main Directorate of the Border Troops (Главное управление пограничных войск) * Command (Руководство)  Commander - Lieutenant general / Colonel general; Office of the Commander * Secretariat (Секретариат) * Staff (Штаб) - Lieutenant general (the Chief of Staff of the BT is simultaneously the First Deputy Commander of the BT) * Military Political Directorate (Военно-политическое управление) - Major general / Lieutenant general * Combat Training Directorate (Управление боевой подготовки) - Major general * Operations Directorate (Оперативное управление) - Lieutenant general * Naval Directorate (Морское управление) - Rear admiral / Vice admiral * Engineering Technical Directorate (Инженерно-техническое управление) - Lieutenant general * Personnel Directorate (Управление кадров) - Major general / Lieutenant general * Automotive and Armored Fighting Vehicles Department (Отдел автобронетанковой техники) - Major general * Aviation Department (Авиационный отдел) - Major general of aviation * Military Construction Department (Военно-строительный отдел) - Major general * Military Education Establishments Department (Отдел военно-учебных заведений) - Major general / Lieutenant general * Military Scientific Directorate (Военно-научное управление) - Major general / Lieutenant general * Military Medical Department (Военно-медицинский отдел) - Major general * Military Veterinary Service (Военно-ветеринарная служба) * Financial Department (Финансовый отдел) - Major general * Rear Services (Тыл ПВ) - Major general / Lieutenant general Under the Main Directorate was the  Border Troops Staff  Border Troops Staff (Штаб пограничных войск) * Chief of Staff / 1st Deputy Commander of the Border Troops - Lieutenant general  First Deputy Chief of Staff - Lieutenant general * 1st Directorate (Operations) (1-е Управление (оперативное)) - Major general / Lieutenant general * Directorate of Organization and Mobilization (Организационно-мобилизационное управление) - Major general * 3rd Department (Signals and Warning Systems) (3-й отдел (связи и сигнализации) - Major general * Department of Information and Analysis (Информационно-аналитический отдел) - Major general * Directorate of Border-crossing Checkpoints (Управление КПП) - Major general * Department of Programs in Planning (Отдел программ планирования) - Major general = Directly subordinated to the MDBT =  Border Districts  The Border Districts were combined arms formations of the KGB, which included border guards similar to motor-rifle infantry, border crossings and their organic aviation units (air regiments, squadrons and flights), signals (battalions and companies), combat engineers, construction engineers (battalions and companies), medical, repair and supply units. The districts bordering oceans and seas also included brigades of guard ships (сторожевые корабли (СКР) - patrol frigates, corvettes and boats, which next to their patrol tasks also had substantial anti-submarine role). The personnel of the Naval Service within the Border Troops held navy style ranks. The Chief of the Naval Directorate within the Main Directorate of the Border Troops was the highest ranking officer in the service with the rank of Rear admiral / Vice admiral. The Maritime Border Troops of the Russian Border Troops (Ru:Морские части Пограничных Войск КГБ СССР) operated within the twelve-mile limit of Soviet territorial waters. It was equipped with frigates and corvettes, fast patrol boats, hydrofoils, helicopters, and light aircraft.http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi- bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+su0535%29 In 1991 the Border Troops numbered ten Border Districts (singular: Пограничный округ, abbr.

ПОГО). These formations roughly corresponded to separate motor-rifle brigades in the Soviet Army Ground Forces. However, unlike army motor-rifle brigades, which were commanded by Major-generals, the Border Detachments were commanded by Colonels. Four of the border detachments were separate from the districts and reported directly to the Main Directorate: * 4th Arkhangelsk Border Detachment (4-й Архангельский ПОГО) * Separate Arctic Border Detachment (Отдельный Арктический ПОГО) *The Separate Arctic Border Detachment (Russian: Отдельный Арктический пограничный отряд) had its headquarters in Vorkuta. The district did not have naval units. It had border outposts from Kolguyev Island to Mys Shmidta and a separate arctic aviation regiment. * Separate Detachment for Border Control \\"Moscow\\" (Отдельный отряд пограничного контроля «Москва») - The detachment carried out border control duties at the major Moscow airports - 12 border control sections operated at Sheremetyevo-2 Airport and one section each at Sheremetyevo-1 Airport cargo terminal, Vnukovo Airport, Domodedovo Airport and Chkalovsky Airport. * 105th Separate Red Banner Detachment Spetsnaz (105-й отдельный Краснознаменный отряд СпН) - The detachment was previously the sole Regiment of the Border Troops, legacy from the time when it belonged to the Soviet Ministry of the Interior. It consisted of one battalion, four separate companies and assorted support units and carried out security tasks at the Soviet embassy in East Germany, the main HQ of the KGB in East Germany and several field offices spread across the country. In 1989 the regiment was upgraded to a border detachment. With this its battalion was upgraded to a Motor-Maneuver Group (мото-маневренная группа) and the companies were upgraded to Border Outposts (singular: застава) in line with KGB Border Troops nomenclature.  Combined Arms troops  In times when the border troops were facing increased external threat or actual local conflict, they were reinforced with conventional units from the Soviet Ground Forces, which were directly integrated in their structure. Such example were tank and artillery battalions during the period of increased hostility during and immediately after the Sino-Soviet border conflict. In the final years of the USSR due to the mounting instability in the Caucasus region the Border Troops took over from the Armed Forces: * the Soviet Ground Forces' 75th Motor Rifle Division (75-я Мотострелковая дивизия) - from January 4, 1990 until September 23, 1991 * the Soviet Airborne Forces' 103rd Guards Airborne Division (103-я Гвардейская воздушно-десантная дивизия) - from January 4, 1990 until September 23, 1991 = District forces = The main forces of the border districts were the Border Detachments (Russian: Пограничный отряд, abbr. ПОГО (singular)). Each detachment covered a specific section of the border and had a Colonel as its commanding officer. The territorial waters were patrolled by brigades of guard ships (Russian: Бригада сторожевых кораблей, abbr. БСКР (singular)) and were commanded by Captains 1st rank. All the guard ship brigades were separate, except for the 1st and the 2nd, which formed the 1st Division of Guard Ships (Russian: 1-я Дивизия сторожевых кораблей) in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, due to the vastness of the assigned area of operations in the Pacific Ocean. The border detachments consisted of Border Command Posts (or Commandatures) (Russian: Пограничная командатура (singular)), Separate Bordercrossing Control Points (Russian: Отдельный контрольно-пропускной пункт, abbr. ОККП (singular)) and various combat support and combat service support units.http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi- bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+su0535%29 A Border Command Post consisted of several Border Outposts and corresponded roughly to a battalion of the armed forces and was therefore commanded by a Lieutenant colonel. The main forces of a BCP accounted several regular Border Outposts (Russian: Пограничная застава, abbr. ПОГЗ (singular)), also informally called Line Border Outposts, as each had a section of the state border assigned to it. In the rear area of the BCP there was also a Reserve Border Outpost acting as the operational reserve of the commander. It had the same structure as the line Border Outposts, but was not permanently deployed at the border. In a situation of increased threat its function was to take over the threatened section of the border, thus becoming a line outpost itself. The equivalent of a BCP in the naval service of the Border Troops was a Battalion of Guard Ships (Russian: Дивизион сторожевых кораблей), commanded by a Captain 2nd rank. The Border Outpost (Russian: Пограничная застава, abbr. ПОГЗ) was the smallest unit of the Border Troops, which was directly involved in the task of securing the state border. The TO&E; called for 41 officers, NCOs, Sergeants and border guards, organised in a staff group, 2 rifle sections, a service canine section and a signals and remote sensoring section. Around the time of the Sino-Soviet border conflict a reinforced TO&E; with an additional rifle section (50 men in total) was introduced and later, during the Soviet–Afghan War a new TO&E; with a fourth rifle section was introduced, increasing the manpower to 64 men. The border outposts were equal in status to separate combat companies of the Ground Forces, with a Major as the CO. A specific operational reserve unit was the Motor Maneuver Group (Russian: Мото-маневренная группа (ММГ)). As the name implied, this was a maneuver element, organized similarly to an army motor rifle battalion, with its own infantry fighting vehicles, armored personnel carriers, mortars and anti-tank weapons. The MMG was a temporary task force fielded by the border detachment by combining personnel from its various units. On an operational deployment an MMG could act both as a classic BCP or as a mechanized warfare unit, the Soviet–Afghan War being the perfect example for this versatility. A typical example for a motor maneuver group was the MMG-1 (AKA the \\"Transcaucasus\\", later \\"Mazar-i-Sharif\\", later the \\"Marmoly\\" MMG) of the Termez Border Detachment, deployed to Afghanistan. It had: * command section with one BTR-60 and one UAZ-469 * 3 border outposts, each consisting of 50 men, including three officers, two Sergeant-Majors and seven Sergeants, further divided into  5 sections with one BTR-60 each * mortar battery of 64 men, including five officers and a Sergeant-Major. The battery had one BTR-60 (R-145BM \\"Chayka\\" command variant) and fifteen GAZ-66 trucks. * 6 mortar sections, each armed with one PM-120 (120-mm) and one BM-82 (82-mm) mortar * reconnaissance platoon of 13 men, including one officer and two Sergeants. It had two sections - the first was armed with a BRM-1, the second - with a BTR-60 * anti-tank platoon of 18 men, including one officer and three Sergeants. The platoon had 4 SPG-9 and 4 GAZ-66 in two sections of two AT teams each. * combat engineer platoon of 20 men, including one officer, one Sergeant-Major and five Sergeants. The platoon had BTR-60, ZIL-131, GAZ-66 and heavy engineering machinery divided among two sapper sections and one engineering section * signals platoon with two BTR-60s (R-145BM \\"Chayka\\" command variant) and an R-140 radio mounted on a ZIL-157 * medical aid post with a medical officer, a Sergeant-Major and an ambulance driver. Each of the three border outposts and the mortar battery had a paramedic, operationally subordinated to the medical officer * logistical platioon of 29 men, including two Sergeant-Majors and three Sergeants. The platoon was subdivided into  a supply, a transport and a repair sections The MMG numbered a total personnel of ca. 300 men. In case the area of operation covered mountainous terrain the border detachments could form heliborne task forces called Air Assault Maneuver Groups (Russian: Десантно-штурмовая маневренная группа, abbr. ДШМГ (singular)). The personnel received parachute and helicopter assault training and adopted Soviet Airborne Forces and Ground Forces Air Assault Troops tactics, weapons and equipment to such an extend, that these units used the traditional VDV patch of two cargo airplanes, a parachute and a red star. These units utilized the organic Mi-8 helicopters of the Border Troops aviation branch. Due to their airborne role and the restricted cargo capacity of their aviation assets (as compared to the mechanized MMGs), these units normally counted ca. 120 men. An example for such a unit is the AAMG formed by the same Termez Border Detachment for operations in Afghanistan. It had: * command section * 3 air assault border outposts * mortar platoon * AGS-17 grenade launcher platoon * grenade launcher / flamethrower platoon * combat engineer platoon * signals platoon The border area was divided into a border zone, which included the territory of the district and settlements adjacent to the state border, and the border strip, which was approximately two kilometers in depth, running directly along the border. Only permanent residents or those who had obtained special permission from the MVD could enter the border zone. Entry into the border strip was forbidden without special permission from the Border Troops.http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi- bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+su0535%29 = Border Troops Naval Service = The Border Troops had their own naval assets. They were subordinated administratively to the Sea Directorate of the Border Troops (Морское управление пограничных войск), headed by a Rear admiral / Vice admiral. Operationally the naval units were subordinated to the border districts. The patrol ships of the naval service were much heavier armed than similar-sized ships of coast guards around the world. They lacked the sophisticated anti-air and anti-ship missile systems, but were armed with artillery as heavy as the AK-100 and for their ASW they carried anti-submarine mortars, torpedoes and even anti-submarine missile systems. Soviet and Russian naval classification did not follow Western convention for smaller major surface combatants. While Western navies use classification based on the ship's size (aviso, corvette, frigate, destroyer), the Soviet Navy (and by extension the KGB's naval service) used classification based on the ship's function. Thus the corvette and frigate-sized warships of the Navy and the Naval Service were classified as guard ships (sing. сторожевой корабль, abbreviated SKR (СКР)). To distinguish the ships of the border troops from those of the navy, the former are classified as border guard ships (sing. пограничный сторожевой корабль, abbreviated PSKR (ПСКР)) and to distinguish between the larger and smaller units in their fleet the corvette and frigate-sized units were classified as ships (sing. корабль, abbreviated KR (КР)), while the smaller patrol craft were classified as cutters (sing. катер, abbreviated KA (КА)). The types of ships in the Border Troops fleet included: * border guard ship (пограничный сторожевой корабль (ПСКР)) - patrol corvettes and frigates * border guard cutter (пограничный сторожевой катер (ПСКА)) - patrol craft * border support ship (пограничный корабль обеспечения (ПКО)) - replenishment ships * patrol vessel (патрульное судно (ПС)) - fishery patrol ships * border ship in special service (пограничный корабль специальной службы (ПКСС)) - corvette / frigate- sized official government yachts * border cutter in special service (пограничный катер специальной службы (ПКАСС)) - small guard craft, used for the security of coastal areas of official government sea residences and government yachts Note: The border districts and their subordinated formations are listed clockwise, starting with the easternmost area of the Soviet Union.

Administratively they fell under the Aviation Department of the Border Troops (Авиационный отдел пограничных войск), with a Major general / Lieutenant general as its chief. Operationally the aviation units were subordinated to the border districts. Unlike its predecessor - the Border Troops of the NKVD (which fielded their own bombers and ground attack aircraft prior to and during World War II), the air arm of the Border Troops of the KGB played a combat support role to the border guards and the patrol ships. The only purely combat aircraft type in service was the Mil Mi-24 attack helicopter. The mainstay of the BT air fleet - the Mil Mi-8, had limited ground attack capabilities. The Border Troops aviation's main role was to deliver supplies and troops to remote border outposts, to deliver foot patrols in remote areas and to mount heli-borne assaults in combat operations. Kamov Ka-27PS helicopters supported the operations of the Border Troops' naval arm. The service also had a small number of Ilyushin Il-76 heavy troop transport jets, which could deliver reinforcements between the various border districts. The Il-76s, Tu-154s and Yak-40s of the Moscow Special Purpose Aviation Unit were also tasked with rapid deployment of the KGB's special operations units (Alpha Group, Vympel Group, Sigma Group etc.). A secondary role of the service was to provide executive air transport for the KGB as a whole, for which it also had Tupolev Tu-134 (later Tupolev Tu-154) and Yakovlev Yak-40 in its inventory. At the time of the Soviet Union's collapse the Border Troops aviation had the following structure: Note: The border districts and their subordinated formations are listed clockwise, starting with the easternmost area of the Soviet Union.

Military-political officers received training at the Voroshilov Higher Border Military-Political School, founded in the 1930s and located outside Leningrad. In 1972 a higher border military-political school was created in Golytsin, near Moscow. More recently, higher border command faculties were set up at the Frunze Military Academy and the Lenin Military-Political Academy. The period of instruction at the Higher Border Command and Military-Political Schools was four years. Officer candidates, who were screened carefully by their local KGB offices before admittance, took general higher education courses along with specialized military and political studies. Political Considerations Soviet sources repeatedly stressed that a border guard was not only a soldier but also a defender of Soviet ideology. His mission entailed sensitive political tasks, such as detecting subversive literature. To ensure a high level of discipline among personnel of the Border Troops, much attention was devoted to political training and indoctrination. For this purpose, a network of political organs, the Political Directorate of the Border Troops, was established within the Border Troops. It had political departments within all the border districts, detachments, and education institutions, and a network of full-time party political officers worked among all troop units. They conducted political study groups, gave propaganda lectures, and worked to increase the level of combat effectiveness among the troops. =Famous former members of Soviet Border Troops= * Alexander Lukashenko, the President of Belarus, served as an officer, * Mikhail Saakashvili, the President of Georgia, served as a conscript. * Vlad Filat, the Prime minister of Moldova, served as a conscript. * Viktor Yushchenko, the 3rd President of Ukraine, served as a conscript. * Konstantin Chernenko, the second last Soviet leader (Secretary General of the CPSU) also served as a border guard on the USSR- Chinese border, before becoming more involved in politics. Dissolution and legacy With the fall of Soviet Union, Border Troops formations in most Soviet republics became border guards of the respective independent states. These new guards mostly changed their name and subordination. The new states of Armenia and Tajikistan are unique exceptions. Tajikistan's border with Afghanistan was guarded by the Russian Border Guard (engaging in heavy fighting) until the late 1990s under a special treaty. Armenia's border is still guarded by Russians under similar conditions. Soviet era border guard reenactors during the 2020 Moscow Victory Day Parade. In Russia and some other post-Soviet states, the Border Troops retained some Soviet traditions, most notably the green shoulder boards on their uniforms and \\"Border Guards Day\\" (), an official holiday celebrated both by active service and former border guards.

College career Jarrett (#8) in the huddle during a 2006 game Jarrett attended the University of Southern California, where he played for coach Pete Carroll's USC Trojans football team from 2004 to 2006. He was a consensus first-team All-American in 2005, and a unanimous first-team All-American in 2006. He was USC's all-time receptions leader with 216 and the Pacific-10 Conference's all-time leader in touchdown receptions with 41.Gary Klein, NFL challenge next for Jarrett, Los Angeles Times, January 11, 2007, accessed January 11, 2007. As a freshman, he helped Trojan fans get over the loss of former USC standout wide receiver Mike Williams. He played in all 13 games and started 8 of them. He caught 55 passes for 849 yards and 13 touchdowns. He also made 5 catches for 115 yards in USC's FedEx Orange Bowl victory over Oklahoma in 2004. As a sophomore, he became Matt Leinart's favorite target. He recorded 91 receptions for 1,274 yards including 4 touchdowns while starting 6 games in 2005. He will be remembered by many fans for his catch against Notre Dame. On fourth-and-nine with less than a minute left, Leinart threw a pass down the sideline to him and Jarrett caught it, running for 61 yards to set up the winning touchdown, the famed and controversial \\"Bush Push\\" quarterback sneak. In USC's Rose Bowl loss to the Texas Longhorns he had 10 catches for 121 yards and a touchdown. He was a 2005 first-team All-American as a sophomore and one of three finalists for the Biletnikoff Award. He was on the 2006 Maxwell Award watch list as the best player in college football. His height, hands, and quickness made him one of the premier receivers going into the 2006 college football season. With the departure of former Trojan running backs Reggie Bush and LenDale White, he was expected to be a big part of the Trojans' offense. After a brief period of ineligibility due to his apparently inappropriate living situation with Leinart, the NCAA reinstated him on August 9, 2006, making him eligible to play for the 2006 football season. Despite being hampered by injuries, including missing games, Jarrett was named to the rivals.com and Pac-10 Coaches 2006 All-Pac-10 team First Team..2006 All-Pac-10 team , Scout.com, November 27, 2006.

Projected as a first-round pick in the 2007 NFL Draft, on January 10, 2007, Jarrett declared his intent to leave USC early to enter the NFL. At a press conference, the tearful Jarrett noted the best part of his USC career was being with his \\"teammates\\" but that he was \\"definitely doing it for my family, because I wasn't the most fortunate kid growing up.\\" Professional career =Carolina Panthers= Jarrett was drafted in the second round (45th overall) of the 2007 NFL Draft by the Carolina Panthers, he was the eighth receiver selected. Originally projected as a first-round pick, Jarrett's stock fell due to his unremarkable time in the 40-yard dash. Jarrett often draws similarities to former Pro Bowl WR Keyshawn Johnson. Both are considered \\"possession\\" receivers and both played at USC. Although Johnson had publicly stated that he looked forward to mentoring Jarrett, it did not become a reality as Johnson was released three days after Jarrett was drafted.Sam Farmer and Gary Klein, USC's Jarrett hurt by separation anxiety, Los Angeles Times, May 2, 2007. Johnson had initially stated that he would be best served by staying at USC an extra year and entering the draft as a senior. After being inactive for 7 of the first 8 games, Jarrett was activated for week 9 against the Atlanta Falcons due to the injury of 2nd string receiver Keary Colbert. He had two catches for 28 yards and recorded a special-teams tackle. On the year he had 6 catches for 73 yards and one tackle. In 2008, Jarrett played in 9 games, starting one. He had 10 receptions for 119 yards. On November 1, 2009, Jarrett made his second career start in place of an injured Muhsin Muhammad, in a victory over the Arizona Cardinals. On January 3, 2010, Dwayne caught his first touchdown pass from Matt Moore. A pass of 30 yards against division rival New Orleans Saints. The Panthers went on to win the game 23-10.

Others in the cast include Wynne Gibson, Alison Skipworth, Roscoe Karns, Louis Calhern, and Bradley Page. Directed by Archie Mayo, it was adapted for the screen by Vincent Lawrence and Kathryn Scola, based on the Cosmopolitan magazine story Single Night by Louis Bromfield, with West allowed to contribute to her lines of dialogue. Although Night After Night is not a comedy, it has many comedic moments, especially with the comic relief of West, who plays a supporting role in her screen debut. Plot Joe Anton (Raft) is a speakeasy owner who falls in love with socialite Miss Healy (Cummings). He takes lessons in high-class mannerisms from Mabel Jellyman (Skipworth). Joe does not know that Miss Healy only pays attention to him because he lives in the elegant building that her family lost in the Wall Street Crash of 1929. After a risky encounter with his old flame Iris Dawn (Gibson) after which Miss Healy kisses him, Joe is ready to marry her, but she's engaged to her friend Mr. Bolton, although admitting she's just marrying him for his money. Joe decides to instead pursue Iris, just as Miss Healy begins to genuinely fall in love with him.

Raft campaigned to cast his friend and former employer Guinan herself but the studio opted for West since she was nine years younger.

(West was reportedly a fan of Guinan and incorporated some of the flamboyant Guinan's ideas into her own acts).Asker, Everett (2013) The Films of George Raft, McFarland & Company. p.30 The film was Raft's first leading role and came about due to response to his work in Scarface.

Geography Fountain City is located in the Appalachian Ridge-and-Valley region, which is characterized by long, narrow ridges that run in a northeast- southwest direction. The community is \\"hemmed in\\" by several such ridges, namely Blackoak Ridge and Beaver Ridge, which divide Fountain City from Halls Crossroads to the north, and Sharp's Ridge, which separates Fountain City from North Knoxville proper to the south. Along with Halls, adjacent communities include Powell, which is opposite Beaver Ridge to the west, Gibbs to the northeast, Beverly to the east, and Whittle Springs to the southeast. Fountain City is drained primarily by First Creek, which rises near the base of Blackoak Ridge and proceeds southward through downtown Knoxville, where it empties into the Tennessee River. The main road in Fountain City is Broadway, a section of U.S. Highway 441 that connects Fountain City to Halls (where it becomes Maynardville Highway) to the north and downtown Knoxville to the south. Interstate 640 passes along Fountain City's southern boundary, and Interstate 75 passes through the western part of the community. Other important roads include Merchants Drive/Cedar Lane, which connects Broadway to I-75, and Tazewell Pike (part of State Highway 331), which connects Fountain City with Gibbs to the northeast. History DAR monument recalling the site of Fort Adair Euro-American settlement in what is now Fountain City began with the completion of Fort Adair (sometimes called Adair's Station), a supply depot built by Captain John Adair (1732–1827) around 1791 to protect westward- bound migrants from hostile Cherokee in the waning years of the Cherokee–American wars. The fort's exact location is unknown, but it was likely located in the vicinity of the modern Lynnhurst Cemetery, near the confluence of Adair Creek and First Creek. Adair and his wife are buried atop a hill overlooking the cemetery.Jim Tumblin, \\"John Adair.\\" Retrieved: 3 January 2009.Kate White, Jim Tumblin (ed.), \\"Fort Adair Found?\\" Retrieved: 3 January 2009. The community that developed around Fort Adair, originally called \\"Grassy Valley,\\" eventually became known as \\"Fountain Head.\\" In the mid-1820s, a circuit rider named E.F. Sevier (a grandson of John Sevier) helped establish the Fountain Head Methodist Church (the predecessor of the present Fountain City United Methodist Church), a meeting house which was completed just north of the Adair holdings in 1828. Within a few years, the Fountain Head Campground had developed on land adjacent to the meeting house, which was fed by a large spring. The campground was a popular place for religious revivals, some of which hosted as many as 2,000 people, until it was moved to the Inskip area (which was closer to the railroad) in the 1880s. Today, the old campground is home to Fountain City Park.Nannie Lee Hicks, Jeanne Morris Jones (ed.), Jim Tumblin (ed.), \\"A Brief History of Fountain City.\\" Originally presented 27 May 1974.

The Fountain Head Campground property was sold to land developers in 1885, and the following year the three-story, fifty-room Fountain Head Hotel was completed, overlooking the campground's spring. With the completion of the hotel, the community began expanding. In 1890, a post office was established, and since the name \\"Fountain Head\\" had already been claimed by another town in Tennessee, the community settled on the name \\"Fountain City.\\" That same year, the heart-shaped Fountain City Lake was completed, and a railroad known as the \\"Dummy Line\\" was constructed to connect the community to Knoxville (its southern terminus was at Emory Place). The Dummy Line remained in operation until 1905, when it was replaced by a trolley. =The 20th century= Fountain City Park In 1893, Holbrook Normal College was established on lands adjacent to the Fountain Head Hotel. Knox County purchased the school (which had come into the possession of the Tennessee Baptist Association) in 1906 for the establishment of Central High School. In 1919, Hassie K. Gresham (1877–1970), a graduate of Holbrook, was named principal of Central High, making her the first female high school principal in the state of Tennessee. She served as Central's principal until 1947, overseeing a nearly tenfold expansion of the size of the school's student body. When Central moved to its new location in 1971, Gresham Middle School that replaced it was named for her.Jim Tumblin, \\"Hassie Kate Gresham.\\" Retrieved: 3 January 2009.

A mail poll showed that Fountain Citians opposed the annexation by a 10 to 1 margin, and the community filed a lawsuit to block it. After Knoxville made a number of concessions, including a one-year moratorium on city taxes, the lawsuit was dropped. On February 12, 1962, in a ceremony that included a mock funeral for what was deemed the death of Fountain City, the community's leaders handed over a symbolic sword to Knoxville mayor John Duncan.

Joining the studio circa 1940,Cardy in Stroud. \\"In the beginning, when I was working for Eisner, for about five pages I was getting $25.00 a week. This is in 1940.\\" he worked on Fight Comics, Jungle Comics, Kaanga Comics, and Wings for Fiction House Publications.

He began his Army career with the 66th Infantry Division, during which time he won a competition to design its patch, creating its snarling black panther logo. His art talent led to his being assigned an office job at division headquarters. This lasted, Cardy recalled in an interview, because a general who had seen Cardy's cartoons in an Officers Club had Cardy assigned to his own corps. As the artist tells it, the only opening was for a corporal in the motor pool, so Private Cardy was promoted and assigned to that duty. This, he said, led in turn, upon his being shipped to the European theater, to Cardy's assignment as an assistant tank driver for the Third Armored Division, under General Courtney Hodges. Later, between the end of the war and his discharge, Cardy said he worked for the Army's Information and Education office in France. Cardy documented his time in the military in a series of intricate sketches and watercolors.

From 1962–1968, he drew the first 39 issues of Aquaman, whose character had previously starred in a backup feature in Adventure Comics, and all its covers through the final issue (#56, April 1971). He recalled that, \\"Ramona Fradon had been drawing the character but was moving on for some reason. I remember being in [editor] Murray's [Boltinoff] office with Ramona during the transition. ... Anyway, they must have liked my work because when the character got his own series, they made me the artist\\".

Neal Adams was called upon to rewrite and redraw a Cardy-drawn Teen Titans story which had been written by Len Wein and Marv Wolfman. The story, titled \\"Titans Fit the Battle of Jericho!\\", would have introduced DC's first African American superhero but was rejected by publisher Carmine Infantino. The revised story appeared in Teen Titans #20 (March–April 1969).

Cardy during this time also assisted artist Al Plastino, a childhood friend, on the Batman comic strip. Cardy became the primary DC cover artist from the early to mid-1970s. A popular but apocryphal anecdote, told by DC editor Julius Schwartz, concerned Cardy being fired by DC editorial director Carmine Infantino for not following a cover layout, only to be rehired moments later when Schwartz praised the errant cover art. Cardy said in 2005, =Later career= Cardy left the comics industry in the mid-1970s for the more lucrative field of commercial art. There, under the name Nick Cardi,Per reproduction of his commercial-art notecard in Cardy interview, Back Issue! #13 (December 2005), p. 9, which gave his since-defunct, 1970s contact information as \\"Nick Cardi / 329 West 57th St., NYC, NY 10019 / (212) 581-9025\\" he did magazine art and ad illustrations, including movie advertising art (though not necessarily the \\"one-sheet\\" posters) for films including The Street Fighter (1974), The Night They Robbed Big Bertha's (1975), Neil Simon's California Suite (1978), Stanley Donen's Movie Movie (1978), Martin Ritt's Casey's Shadow (1978), and Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now (1979).

Personal life Following his World War II discharge from the U.S. Army, Cardy met and married Ruth Houghby. In 1955 they had a son, Peter, who died in 2001. The couple remained married through 1969. Cardy died of congestive heart failure in Florida on November 3, 2013. Awards Nick Cardy received an Inkpot Award in 1998. On July 15, 2005, Cardy was one of four professionals inducted that year into the comics industry's Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame. Viscardi also earned two Purple Hearts for wounds suffered as a tank driver while serving with the 3rd Armored Division in WWII. He also designed the patch for the 66th Infantry Division after winning a competition.

The low-lying island is almost divided in two by a narrow neck of land at West Porth which can, at times, be covered by waves. At the northern end of the island are the two granite carns of Annet Head and Carn Irish and three smaller carns known as the Haycocks. The rocky outcrops on the southern side of the island, such as South Carn, are smaller. Annet is a bird sanctuary and the main seabird breeding site in Scilly.Robinson, P. (2003) The Birds of the Isles of Scilly. London: Christopher Helm. The island is closed to the public all year round to limit the disturbance to the breeding seabirds during the summer months and breeding Atlantic Grey Seals during the winter months, for which it has been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). It is also within part of the Isles of Scilly Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB), Isles of Scilly Heritage Coast and part of Plantlife's, Isles of Scilly Important Plant Area The island is managed by the Isles of Scilly Wildlife TrustParslow R (2007) The Isles of Scilly. London: HarperCollins who lease it from the Duchy of Cornwall. History Little has been found on Annet in the way of human remains apart from a prehistoric hut circle, a fragmentary field system and several limpet middens. Bones of cattle and sheep were found indicating that they were eaten here and probably grazed the island. It is proposed to designate the whole of Annet as a Scheduled Ancient Monument. The name of the island is first recorded in 1302 as Anet. Also recorded as Anete in 1305, Anet in 1339, Agnet in 1570 and Agnet iland alias Annett in 1650. In the 19th century Annet was ″used for pasturage by the inhabitants of other islands″ although with only one freshwater seepage there could not have been many animals grazing on the island. The SS Castleford struck the Crebawethans in June 1877 and led to some of her cargo of 250 to 450 cattle being landed on the island and staying there for up to 10 days. Gurney (1889) reported that \\"... the animals trampled everything and would have caused an immense amount of damage at the peak of the shearwater and storm petrel nesting season\\".Gurney (1889) Notes on the Isles of Scilly and the Manx Shearwater (Puffinus anglorum) Transactions of the Norfolk and Norwich Naturlists' Society. In Parslow R (2007) The Isles of Scilly. London: HarperCollins It seems unlikely that many stayed for 10 days because of the need for fresh water. Cattle were washed up on the Cornish coast as far as Mount's Bay and St Ives. Another ship wrecked nearby, the world's only seven-masted schooner, Thomas W Lawson spilled her cargo of oil on 14 December 1907 causing the loss of many birds. In 1971 Rex Cowan found the wreck of VOC Hollandia together with a large quantity of coins, bronze cannons and mortars. The ship hit Gunner Rock on 13 July 1743 with the loss of 276 lives. Natural history The geology of Annet is of Hercynian granite overlain with raised beach deposits. On the southern end there is a \\"thick bed of soil, part sand and part soil\\". The island is low-lying with a top height of 18 m and the coast consists of boulder storm beaches. The effects of wind exposure, salt spray and lack of topography, restricts diversity and only 53 species of vascular plants have been recorded. The north of the island is dominated by a well developed, thick, thrift (Armeria maritima) turf whilst the southern part is dominated by dense stands of bracken (Pteridium aquilinum), bramble (Rubus fruticosus) and bluebells (Hyacinthoides non-scripta), with some sand sedge (Carex arenaria) and Yorkshire fog (Holcus lanatus). Thickets of tree mallow (Lavatera arborea) have developed at the back of some of the boulder beaches. There were scattered colonies of shore dock (Rumex rupestris) until a storm in 1982 swept away some of the boulder beaches. One colony remains in the corner of a relatively sheltered beach in the south of the island at a freshwater seepage. Shore dock is one of the primary reasons for the selection of the Isles of Scilly as a Special Area of Conservation (SAC). Annet is the ″British stronghold″ for the lichen Roccella fuciformis.Gainey, P.A. (2009) Lichens. In CISFBR, Red Data Book for Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly. 2nd Edition. Praze-an-Beeble: Croceago Press. A description of the island by Hilda Quick, a former resident of St Agnes published in 1964 is still relevant today: > Many people are disappointed at being unable to visit the famous bird > sanctuary, but in fact, there is very little to see there by day. There will > be shearwater corpses lying about, (victims of the gulls) several large > colonies of gulls, some oystercatchers, rock pipits, and wrens. The walking > on the island is horrid, much of it over loose stones hidden in long grass, > some bramble and bracken, and awkward great clumps of thrift. What Annet is > famous for is its colonies of Manx shearwaters and storm petrels; but since > they nest underground, and only come and go in the dark, there is nothing to > be seen of them by day. One has to camp out for the night, which is often a > chilly process, and requires special permission. The puffins that to breed > there in such numbers that their bodies were used for paying rent are now > few, and can best be seen from a boat as they swim on the water.Quick, H M > (1964) Birds of the Scilly Isles. Truro: D Bradford Barton Ltd =Fauna= Annet is considered to be of outstanding importance as a seabird colony. Twelve species nest here, of which two, European storm–petrel (Hydrobates pelagicus) and lesser black-backed gull (Larus fuscus) have nationally important breeding populations. The storm–petrel breeds amongst the boulders of the more stable storm beaches. The largest population of Manx shearwater (Puffinus puffinus) in the islands breed here and the other annual breeding species are puffin (Fratercula arctica), greater black-backed gull (Larus marinus), razorbill (Alca torda), kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla), fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis), herring gull (L. argentatus) and shag (P. aristotelis). Common tern (Sterna hirundo) breed on the island most years as do cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo) and very rarely Arctic tern (S. paradisaea). Breeding birds Annet has long had a reputation for being the best island for breeding birds and Jessie Mothersole visiting in 1910 described the island thus: > Annet is known by the name of \\"Bird Island\\" from the immense numbers that > breed there. In the early summer the sea all round is black with puffins and > razor-bills, their white breasts being hardly noticeable as they sit on the > surface of the water ; and the air above is dark with clouds of gulls, and > full of their ceaseless cry. Puffins (also called sea-parrots) have bred on > the islands from time immemorial. Numbers of breeding birds have fallen over the years and in the last 150 years some of the threats have been recorded. J H Gurney visited the island in May 1887 and estimated the population to be 200 pairs. He reported: > There had been a terrible robbery on Annet, a few days before our visit, of > Shearwaters or their eggs, or both, and the south end of the island was dug > over in all directions. Notwithstanding this, we had no difficulty in > finding the objects of our search; indeed the ground was so honeycombed, > that it was impossible in some places to avoid stepping on, and breaking > into, their domiciles. The raid on the colony had been carried out by men from Tresco and they were brought before the Lord Proprietor Mr Dorrien–Smith; Gurney did not report on their punishment if any. He also reported that Annet was the only island without rats. A few weeks later cattle from the SS Castleford were landed on Annet after she hit the nearby Crebawethans and was said to have \\"trampled everything to pieces, broke in all the Shearwaters' holes, probably destroying many birds, and made a ruin of everything\\". Another wreck, the Thomas W Lawson on 14 December 1907, spilled her cargo of oil and many of the rabbits and birds on Annet \\"were seen to lie upon the shore\\". The smell of oil could still be smelt on nearby St Agnes 18 months later. At the time of Jessie Mothersole's visit in 1910, visitors were only allowed one hour on the island and shooting and egg collecting was forbidden. Despite this, Annet figured highly on the list of places to visit for egg collecting. An examination of the egg collection at the Natural History Museum (NHM) shows 45 eggs taken between 1880 and 1936 by 14 individuals and one group from Holloway College; doubtless there are many more eggs in private collections. Names on the data cards include well known wildlife experts such as Charles Rothschild and F W Frohawk. An indication of how common and acceptable egg collecting was at the time, is the issue of day permits to visit uninhabited islands by the warden A A Dorrien–Smith of Tresco. A NHM data card for three eggs in the collection has a permit for landing on Annet on 24 May 1931 attached and allowed the Souter brothers to land on any island, except tern islands, for up to one hour. European storm–petrel The only breeding sites for European storm-petrel in England are on the Isles of Scilly with 11 colonies and an estimated 1,475 occupied sites (i.e. breeding pairs). Annet had the majority of breeding pairs with 938 occupied sites during the Seabird 2000 survey declining to 788 occupied sites in a repeat survey in 2006. Other species The most recent count of seabirds on the Isles of Scilly was the Seabird 2000 count and on Annet 209 nests were found to be occupied by shag out of a total of 1,109 for the islands. On Scilly, they breed almost exclusively beneath boulder beaches or holes in low cliffs. Manx shearwater was estimated to occupy 123 burrows out of a total of 201 for the islands’ – a 74% decrease from a previous survey in 1974. On 22 September 2002 the first lanceolated warbler (Locustella lanceolata) recorded on the Isles of Scilly was found during a search for migrant birds. Also seen was two sedge warbler (Acrocephalus schoenobaenus) and four willow warbler (Phylloscopus trochilus). Mammals In 1996 the Isles of Scilly was designated a European Marine Site and the Marine Management Organisation is required to monitor the site at least every six years. The grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) is a named species and surveys were carried out in 2005 and 2010. Annet is one of the top four sites within the islands for numbers of seals and, during August to December 2010, over half of the observed pups seen were on Annet (46 out of 85). Records of some of the rarer cetaceans are from strandings and the British Museum was the first organisation to publish such reports for Britain. Strandings are often the only indication that rare species live, or pass through, an area and in 1917 an endangered species, a male fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus) was washed up. Natural England (previously English Nature) began a rat extermination programme in the 1990s with systematic baiting now being carried out by the Wildlife Trust. Brown rats (Rattus norvegicus) have been eradicated from Annet and a feasibility study has found that the eradication of rats from St Agnes and Gugh would benefit the breeding birds on Annet by removing the most likely source of invasion. The study also found that small mammals also benefit from the eradication programme which should help the Annet population of Scilly shrew (Crocidura suaveolens). A rat eradication programme started on St Agnes and Gugh on 8 November 2013 and seems to be successful as none have been recorded in December. The eradication team will visit Annet in January 2014 to check for signs of rats. Rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) has also been recorded. A gull pellet found in 2002 contained the skull of a small mammal and when examined was found to be a water vole (Arvicola terrestris) which has never been found on the Isles of Scilly. Water vole is extinct at the nearest possible mainland source, Cornwall, and the original location of the skull is unknown. Invertebrates The lepidopterist Austin Richardson made annual visits to the Isles of Scilly from 1956 to 1962 recording the moths and butterflies. On 14 September 1958, during a visit to Annet, he saw a crimson speckled (Utetheisa pulchella); a migrant moth whose larvae have never been found in Britain. He did not see any larva of the grass eggar (Lasiocampa trifolii) but the imago was found there the following August. K Smith visited Annet in June 1961 to record the diptera and also found a moth, the garden tiger (Arctia caja).

He hosted a weekly four-hour Sunday night program, The Big Broadcast, on WAMU-FM, featuring vintage radio programs from the 1930s to 1950s, such as Gunsmoke, The Jack Benny Show, The Lone Ranger, Fibber McGee and Molly, and Superman. Walker began hosting The Big Broadcast in 1990 when his friend John Hickman discontinued hosting due to illness; the show, which started in 1964 as Recollections, was the longest running program on WAMU. The show ranked first in its timeslot, and its audience was \\"remarkably young for a public radio crowd.\\" Career Walker, who was totally blind since birth, said that while growing up \\"radio was my comic books, movies, everything\\". After graduating from Maryland School for the Blind, he was the first blind student at American University in Washington where, in 1950, he helped launch the campus radio station, WAMU-AM — the predecessor of WAMU-FM. Willard Scott joined the radio station the following year, forming a professional and personal bond with Walker that continued for his entire life. Scott said in his book, The Joy of Living, that they are \\"closer than most brothers\\".Willard Scott, The Joy of Living. New York: Coward, McCann & Geoghegan, 1982 (). And they were brothers – fraternity brothers – at American University's Alpha Sigma Phi chapter. From 1955 to 1974, Walker teamed with Scott as co-hosts of the nightly Joy Boys program, an improvised comedy radio show in Washington. On Joy Boys, Scott sketched a list of characters and a few lead lines setting up the situation, which Walker would commit to memory or note on his Braille typewriter. The program began on WRC-AM, an NBC owned-and-operated station, moving in 1972 to WWDC. In a 1999 article recalling the Joy Boys at the height of their popularity in the mid-1960s, the Washington Post said they \\"dominated Washington, providing entertainment, companionship, and community to a city on the verge of powerful change\\". After the Joy Boys left the air in October 1974, Walker worked on other Washington-area radio and television stations, including WJLA-TV from 1975 until 1980, News Channel 8 in the early 1990sEd Walker: Host, The Big Broadcast, WAMU-FM and WRC, hosting radio programs. He was married to Nancy, who is sighted, since 1957; they had two daughters and five grandchildren. American University has released some of the Joy Boys radio broadcasts of the 1960s on CDs. Although he rarely made appearances at conventions, Walker was a featured star at the 2007 Mid-Atlantic Nostalgia Convention in Aberdeen, Maryland. In 2009, Ed Walker was elected to the National Radio Hall of Fame in the category \\"Local or Regional – Pioneer.\\" In late 2015, Walker was diagnosed with cancer and retired from The Big Broadcast to focus on his health and spend more time with his family. His last show aired from 7:00 to 11:00 PM on October 25, 2015. It was recorded the week before from his room at Sibley Memorial Hospital where he had been receiving treatment. He died just three hours after that last broadcast concluded.

Howard. Biography Price was for the most part raised on a farm in Brownwood, Texas. With aspirations of becoming a writer, Price became a school teacher to pay for her education at Daniel Baker College and later Louisiana State University. Price taught English, public speaking and history between 1934 and 1936 at Cross Plains High School. Cross Plains was also home to writer Robert E. Howard, to whom Price had been briefly introduced in 1933. Price initially sought out Howard for advice as to how she could get her writing published. Common interests and personal chemistry, however, created a strong bond of friendship between the two. Despite personality differences, misunderstandings, and unsuccessful attempts to bring their relationship beyond casual dating, Price and Howard remained close until Howard's suicide in 1936. After Howard's death, Price shifted her focus away from a writing career and strove to become the best teacher she could be, ultimately remaining a teacher until her retirement. On October, 2 1942 Price married John Douglas Robarts. Robarts was a Second Lieutenant serving in the US Army Infantry. They adopted a child, Marvin Douglas. Price and Robarts were divorced in May 1946. While working as a teacher at Daniel Baker College, Price met and, in 1947, married William Ellis. Price and Ellis resided in Louisiana and had one son, Marvin Douglas Ellis, born in 1949. Price's love of teaching and gift at speechwriting was recognized in 1981 with her admittance into the National Forensic Hall of Fame. Her marriage to Ellis lasted forty- seven years, until Ellis' death in 1994. Price continued living alone in Lafayette, Louisiana until her death on March 30, 1999. Legacy Throughout her life, Price did sell a number of articles and short stories, but it is her 1986 memoir, One Who Walked Alone, about her relationship with Howard for which she is best known.

Ceremonial reception A Joyous Entry is a particular form of, and title for, the general phenomenon of ceremonial entries into cities by rulers or their representatives, which were celebrated with enormous pageantry and festivities throughout Europe from at least the late Middle Ages on. The leading artists available designed temporary decorated constructions such as triumphal arches, groups of musicians and actors performed on stands at which the procession halted, the houses on the processional route decorated themselves with hangings, flowers were thrown, and fountains flowed with wine. The custom began in the Middle Ages and continued until the French Revolution, although less often in Protestant counties after the Reformation. A formal first visit to a city by an inheritor of the throne of Belgium upon his accession and since 1900 for a crown prince upon his marriage, is still referred to as a \\"Joyous Entry\\", a reminder of this tradition of the rule of law.Museum of the World Ocean — The thirtieth anniversary of the international conferences (schools) for marine geology Nieuwsbank interactief Nederlands persbureau Charter of liberties The Joyous Entry of John of Austria into Brussels, 1 May 1577.

In the Duchy of Brabant the term Joyous Entry was also applied to the charter of liberties that a new ruler was obliged to swear to uphold upon their formal first reception, dating back to the Joyous Entry of 1356. One of the functions of the Council of Brabant was to ensure that new legislation did not contravene or abrogate the liberties established in the Joyous Entry.D.

Vol. 5. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 8 Mar. 2015 Legend One of the many daughters of King Brychan of Brycheiniog in South Wales (a sub-Roman monarch who embraced the new faith of Christianity), Eluned became a Christian at a young age.Varner, Gary R., Sacred Wells, Algora Publishing, 2009 She spurned the advances of a pagan prince and, like many women of her time, ran away to avoid being forced into the relationship. She travelled first to Llan Ddew where she was ousted by the locals, then to Llanfilo. Here again, she was ousted by the inhabitants, on the pretext of thievery. She then travelled to Llechfaen, where she was again thrown out of the community. She would not find peace until her arrival at Slwch Tump, where the local lord gave her protection. However, Eluned's pursuer found her. When she ran from him, he chased her down the hill and beheaded her. Her head rolled down the hill and hit a stone; as in the story of Saint Winefride, a healing spring burst from that spot. There is a reference to Eluned in the work of William Worcester (). He refers to the saint's remains as being housed in the priory church at Usk, home to a community of Benedictine nuns founded sometime before 1135 by Richard de Clare.Cartwright, Jane. \\"Dead virgins: feminine sanctity in medieval Wales\\", Medium Aevum, 22 March 2002 Veneration When the Normans arrived in the 11th century, her well at Slwch was associated with healing and other miracles. Like many other such sites, the holy well and church of Eluned were destroyed in the Reformation. In his 1698 essay on the history of Brecknockshire, Welsh historian Hugh Thomas speaks of the chapel, in his time, as :\\"standing, though unroofed and useless; the people thereabouts call it St. Tayled [St. Aled]. It was situated on an eminence, about a mile to the eastward of Brecknock, and about half a mile from a farm-house, formerly the mansion and residence of the Aubreys, lords of the manor of Slwch, which lordship was bestowed upon Sir Reginald Awbrey by Bernard Newmarche, in the reign of William Rufus. Some small vestiges of this building may still be traced, and an aged yew tree, with a well at its foot, marks the site near which the chapel formerly stood.\\"Gerald of Wales.

Dactylis Glomerata is the sixth studio album by Swedish doom metal band Candlemass, released in 1998. This was their first album released since their split in 1994. The album was originally destined to be the second release by Candlemass main songwriter Leif Edling's side-project Abstrakt Algebra but, under request from the record label Music for Nations, it was converted in a Candlemass album. There were many musicians involved in the long process of recording, including members of the Abstrakt Algebra's line-up, guitarist Michael Amott of Arch Enemy and Carcass fame and new singer Björn Flodkvist. The music on the album lacks much of the epic doom sound of previous works and embraces a more experimental and progressive approach, with elements of stoner rock and space rock. In 2006, it was reissued by GMR Music as a 2 CD edition. The second disc contains the previously unreleased album Abstrakt Algebra II, from which this album's tracks derived. Background Candlemass disbanded in 1994, after the release of the EP Sjunger Sigge Furst. Main songwriter and bassist Leif Edling formed a new band called Abstrakt Algebra with singer Mats Levén, drummer Jejo Perkovic, guitarists Mike Wead and Simon Johansson. Abstrakt Algebra released their eponymous debut album of experimental and progressive metal in 1995. The album received some good reviews but was not a commercial success. Composition and recording Edling composed music for a second more progressive Abstrakt Algebra album and started recording it with a different line-up, which included keyboard player Carl Westholm and guitarist Patrik Instedt replacing Wead and Johansson, at Sunlight Studio, Stockholm, Sweden in the Autumn of 1996. Soon problems emerged with the recording studio and the producer and Edling's finances dried up. Music for Nations, the British label which had issued the previous Candlemass albums, offered Edling to finance further recordings in a different studio if the album was released as a work by Candlemass. Edling, who was on the edge of bankruptcy and a mental breakdown, agreed to this condition and rearranged the songs to adapt them to the heavier doom metal sound of Candlemass. He also composed the new songs \\"I Still See the Black\\", \\"Molotov\\" and \\"Karthago\\" for the album. His old bandmates declined Edlin's request for collaboration, so he recruited Swedish guitarist Michael Amott, renowned for his work with Carcass, Spiritual Beggars and Arch Enemy and a declared Candlemass fan, to beef up the guitar sound on the tracks. Meanwhile, Levén had joined Yngwie Malmsteen's band and Björn Flodkvist, who Edlin had met while working at Sveriges Radio P3 and coming from the Swedish alternative rock band Gone, was selected as singer. A band composed by Edling, Amott, Flodkvist, Instedt, Perkovic and Westholm re- recorded during a weekend in May 1997 the basic tracks for the old Abstrakt Algebra songs and for the new compositions \\"I Still See the Black\\", \\"Karthago\\" and \\"Wiz\\" (originally called \\"Blue Wizard\\") with the help of session musicians at Swedish Broadcasting Corporation Studio 4 in Stockholm, Sweden. Those three days of recording were Amott's only involvement with Candlemass. Overdubs were added by several other musicians at two other studios of the same city. The final mix, performed by Edling and engineer Uffe Östling, joined the new recordings and more overdubs until after September 1997. Release The album took about 18 months to be completed and was released on 13 April 1998 by Music for Nations. The Japanese edition featured the bonus tracks \\"Container\\" and \\"Thirst\\". The title comes from the plant Dactylis glomerata, the flower of which Edling is allergic to. Dactylis Glomerata was reissued in 2006 in a 2 CD edition by the Swedish label GMR Music and by Peaceville Records in 2008. The second disc contains the Abstrakt Algebra sessions recorded by the band in 1996 and extensive liner notes by Edling. Reception Dactylis Glomerata received positive reviews, but was a commercial failure. Canadian journalist Martin Popoff praised the \\"trippy, not cheesy\\" production and Björn Flodkvist's vocals, considering the album \\"closer to stoner rock than self- serious doom\\". Rock Hard reviewer remarked how different the sound of Dactylis Glomerata is in comparison with the \\"classic\\" first four Candlemass albums, lacking \\"their anthemic, epic arrangements\\", \\"the theatrical element, which has always characterized the vocals of Messiah\\" (Marcolin), and featuring elements of space rock in several tracks like the \\"monumental 'Dustflow'\\".

The bridges convey Interstate 695 across the Anacostia to its southern terminus at Interstate 295 and DC 295. The bridges also connect the neighborhood of Anacostia with the rest of the city of Washington. The first bridge at the site, constructed about 1800, played a role in the War of 1812. It burned in 1846, but was repaired. A second bridge was constructed in 1873, and replaced in 1907. A modern, four- lane bridge replaced the older bridge in 1965, and a second four-lane bridge added in 1969. In 2009, construction began on three spans (two carrying freeway traffic, one carrying local-only traffic) to replace the 1965 and 1969 bridges. The northbound bridge opened to traffic in December 2011 while the southbound bridge open to traffic in January 2012. The new bridges include new ramps and new interchanges with I-295 (the Anacostia Freeway). The local bridge opened to traffic in May 2012. Portions of all three bridges and their approaches remain under construction . Phase 1 of the project was completed ahead of schedule and within budget in July 2013. The local bridge was fully complete by September 2013. Phase 2 of the project, including the conversion of the Barney Circle Freeway into a boulevard, was completed in 2015.

Also a toll bridge, this second bridge became a \\"free\\" bridge in 1848 after it was purchased by the federal government. From the city's founding until 1854, the area known today as Anacostia was primarily sparsely populated farmland. But Anacostia was platted in 1854, and development slowly began to turn the agricultural land into businesses and residences. The destruction of the Eastern Branch Bridge in 1846, however, significantly slowed growth in the area for five decades.Miller, Frederic and Gillette, Howard.

Welsh, who drowned in 1986 while attempting to save a woman who had attempted to commit suicide by leaping from the bridge into the Anacostia River. Welsh's body was never recovered, and the D.C. City Council renamed the southbound span in his honor. See: Kelly, John F. \\"Bridges Carry Bits of History Along With the Traffic.\\" Washington Post. April 21, 2005.

The innermost beltway would have formed a flattened oval about a mile in radius centered on the White House. The middle beltway would have formed an arc along the northern portion of the city, running from the proposed Barney Circle Freeway terminus near Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium to near 37th Street NW at the north end of Georgetown. Two decades of protest led to the cancellation of all but the I-395 and I-695 portions of the plan. The unbuilt portions of the project were finally cancelled in 1977. Several ramps allowing traffic on the 11th Street Bridges to access I-295/Anacostia Freeway and I-695 eastbound remained unbuilt because of these cancellations, creating severe traffic problems on both ends of the bridges.Lynton, Stephen J. \\"D.C.

In 2004, the two bridges carried 86,000 vehicles per day, the second-largest volume of the four \\"middle Anacostia River\\" bridge crossings. Without improvements to traffic patterns across the Anacostia River, the District of Columbia Department of Transportation (DDOT) estimated in 2005 that traffic over the 11th Street Bridges would significantly expand to 105,100 vehicles per day by 2030, an increase of 22.2 percent over 2004 and more than 40.3 percent higher than the next-busiest bridge (Sousa Bridge). DDOT undertook a major study of the bridges in 2004 which concluded that both bridges should be replaced.District of Columbia Department of Transportation.

The goals of the project were: * to reduce traffic congestion on both the 11th Street Bridges and on local streets; * to increase the safety of all types of traffic on local streets; * to replace the current bridges; * to provide an improved emergency evacuation route for the nation's capital; and * to provide routes for security personnel in and out of the nation's capital.

Council member Marion Barry, the protesters said too few individuals from the Anacostia area (which suffers from a 30 percent unemployment rate) had been considered for employment or hired by Skanska/Facchina, the joint-venture construction company building the bridges. Skanska/Facchina vice president Brook Brookshire denied the accusations, noting that 51 percent of the new hires were D.C. residents, the company had engaged in extensive outreach to the unemployed, and that the company had worked with local jobs organizations, the D.C. Department of Employment Services, and the D.C. Department of Transportation to find workers for the project.Brookshire, Brook. \\"A Construction Project Committed to Hiring District Residents.\\" The Washington Post. March 25, 2011. Brookshire also said the company had provided training to unskilled workers to enable them to work on the project and find careers in the construction industry. Signage on the new inbound span of the 11th Street Bridges shows the connection with I-695, which will be marked for the first time in its history. In May 2011, DDOT closed the off-ramp from the bridges to Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue SE. The agency said the closure would create a larger work area and speed up construction of the new bridges and approaches.Thomson, Robert. \\"Dr. Gridlock's Traffic, Transit Tips.\\" The Washington Post. May 1, 2011. Traffic was rerouted along the existing Good Hope Road on-ramp through the end of 2011, although this meant the ramp now carried two-way traffic in a single lane each way. Significant afternoon rush-hour delays occurred in the area due to the rerouting. In August 2011, the D.C. City Council designated the 11th Street Bridges, a portion of Southeast/Southwest Freeway, Maine Avenue SW, and Independence Avenue SW \\"Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue\\" in honor of the slain civil rights leader. The dedication came in time for the planned dedication of the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial.DeBonis, Mike. \\"A Hitch in City's Plan to Honor MLK.\\" The Washington Post. August 17, 2011. The renaming was honorary, and did not formally change the names of these bridges, highways, and streets. The non-local spans were finished months ahead of schedule, and D.C. Mayor Vincent C. Gray held a ribbon-cutting ceremony on December 16, 2011, to open the two bridges connecting I-295 with the Anacostia Freeway. The two spans were projected to carry 180,000 automobiles per day by 2032.Halsey III, Ashley. \\"Two Bridges Across Anacostia Are Ready Ahead of Schedule.\\" The Washington Post. December 17, 2011. The inbound I-295 span opened on Monday, December 19, 2011.\\"Opening of Inbound 11th Street Bridge Should Start to Ease Commutes This Week in DC.\\" Associated Press. December 19, 2011. The span carried both I-295 traffic as well as traffic coming up from neighborhood streets in Anacostia until the separate Anacostia-only span opened in 2013. Officials in December 2011 predicted the local-only span, which was intended to carry not only automobiles but also include bicycle and pedestrian lanes, would open in the summer of 2012. Before the opening of the spans, DDOT received permission from the U.S. Department of Transportation to extend the designation of I-695 to the interchange with I-295.Thomson, Robert. \\"D.C.'s 11th St. Bridge Opening in Phases.\\" The Washington Post. January 8, 2012. The opening of the new spans eliminated a dangerous portion of I-295 where motorists moving right to access the 11th Street Bridges mixed with motorists moving left as they entered the freeway from Firth Sterling Avenue SE. However, to allow local traffic access to the rest of the city, a set of temporary on- and off-ramps were made to give Anacostia residents access to the bridges.Thomson, Robert. \\"Dr. Gridlock's Traffic Transit Tips.\\" The Washington Post. December 18, 2011. In March 2012, DDOT also closed the ramp leading from I-695 to the 11th Street Bridges so that new approaches and connections to the new spans could be constructed.Thomson, Robert. \\"Second Span of New 11th Street Bridge to Open.\\" The Washington Post. January 5, 2012. Ten Metrobus routes were rerouted due to the span closure, adding significant travel times for Anacostia commuters.The routes affected were 90, 92, 93, A42, A46, A48, B2, P2, P6, and U2. See: Thomson, Robert. \\"Bus Routes Detour for 11th St. Bridge Work.\\" The Washington Post. January 7, 2012. Motorists attempting to reach Anacostia were forced to use one of three time-consuming alternative routes: exit I-395 at the Sixth Street SE ramp, travel through local streets, and use an on-ramp next to the Washington Navy Yard to access the undemolished old outbound bridge; continue onto I-295 and exit at Howard Road SE; exit onto South Capitol Street and take the Frederick Douglass Bridge; or continue east to the John Philip Sousa Bridge. In January 2012, DDOT officials said that even when the third span opened in the summer of 2012, it would not be complete. DDOT said that one of the outbound traffic lanes would not be complete, nor would the pedestrian/bike lane. DDOT also admitted that Anacostia residents traveling into the city would not have direct access to M Street as originally planned. Instead, motorists would confront a dead-end and be forced to take a detour east onto O Street SE, travel north on 12th Street NE, and then make a left to reach M Street SE. DDOT said the final outbound lane to Anacostia as well as the bicycle/pedestrian lane would not be completed until the fall of 2012. DDOT announced in April 2012 that it was on schedule to open the new ramp from the bridge to northbound Anacostia Freeway in June, and the new inbound-ramp on the north side of the bridge (connecting with I-395) in September.Thomson, Robert. \\"Spring Changes for Nats Park.\\" The Washington Post. April 8, 2012. =Southeast Boulevard= Since the cancellation of the Inner Loop Expressway, motorists wanting to access the Baltimore–Washington Parkway or U.S. Route 50 in Maryland (the John Hanson Highway) would often travel Interstate 695 to Barney Circle, wait at the traffic light there, use Pennsylvania Avenue to cross the nearby Sousa Bridge, wait at a traffic light on the southwestern terminus of the bridge, and make a left turn against oncoming traffic to access a narrow and dangerous ramp that led to northbound D.C. Route 295 (the Anacostia Freeway). The combination of traffic lights, left turn, and mixing of both through-traffic and local traffic created extensive traffic congestion on the Sousa Bridge during evening rush hour. In 2009, when the DDOT began the replacement of the 11th Street Bridges, it closed the westbound segment of Interstate 695 from the 11th Street Bridges to Barney Circle in late November 2012, and the eastbound lanes in early 2013. This portion of was Interstate 695 was subsequently decommissioned, turning roughly five blocks of six-lane highway into city streets from the National Highway System. The unfinished \\"mixing bowl\\" exchange on the southern terminus of the 11th Street Bridges was also altered. Local traffic was separated from through-traffic by the construction of a bridge dedicated for local traffic only, and ramps connecting the bridge to D.C. Route 295 were created. Construction of the new ramps began in May 2012, with the ramp from southbound D.C. Route 295 onto the 11th Street Bridge completed in July 2012. The ramp from the bridges to northbound D.C. Route 295 opened on December 19, 2012. The decommissioned portion of Interstate 695 began to be transformed into a boulevard named \\"Southeast Boulevard\\". The reconstruction project, estimated to take 18 to 24 months, raised the roadway to bring it level with the grade of the surrounding streets. The six-lane former highway began to be turned into a four-lane grand boulevard with a landscaped median and pedestrian nature trail. Southeast Boulevard was designed to link Barney Circle to 11th Street SE. In 2013, DDOT published plans to reconfigure Barney Circle. Priorities for the project included improving and restoring access to neighborhood streets, and adding pedestrian and bicycle connectivity to local streets and the Anacostia River waterfront. DDOT also began exploring whether to connect Southeast Boulevard to 12th, 13th, 14th, and 15th Streets SE. By 2014, DDOT's plan involved possible reconstructing of Barney Circle into an intermodal transportation hub as well. DDOT planners said that construction on this project might begin as early as 2016. =Streetcar lane= The local span of the new 11th Street Bridges was designed to accommodate a lane for the trolley cars of the city's emerging DC Streetcar tram system. The Anacostia Line of the streetcar system was originally intended to travel north from the Anacostia Metro station to a streetcar station at the southern foot of the local span before connecting with the Navy Yard – Ballpark and Waterfront Metro stations.Layton, Lyndsey. \\"Light-Rail Project Would Link Anacostia With Southwest D.C.\\" The Washington Post. September 19, 2002. Design changes were made in the 11th Street Bridges to permit the streetcar tracks.Nevola, Molly. \\"Streetcars On Track for Return to D.C.\\" Washington Times. March 15, 2009. In 2009, however, DDOT said the trolley cars would not travel down M Street SE/SW but rather proceed up 8th Street SE/NE to link with DC Streetcar's H Street Line.\\"Officials Tout Plan to Use Streetcars.\\" Washington Times. February 26, 2009. To help fund construction of the Anacostia Line, DDOT proposed transferring $10 million from demolition of the 11th Street Bridges, but put that plan on hold due to delays in the streetcar project.Sun, Lena H. \\"Streetcars Could Be Running on D.C. Roads by Late Next Year.\\" The Washington Post. July 13, 2008. For reasons which remain unclear, DDOT shuttered construction of the Anacostia line in August 2010.Broom, Scott. \\"DC's Streetcar Project Halted For Now.\\" WUSA9.com. August 26, 2010. Accessed 2010-08-31. Funding for the Anacostia Line over the 11th Street Bridges subsequently fell through as well. DDOT had applied for an $18 million Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) grant from the United States Department of Transportation to build the trolley bed and lay tracks along the local span, but the federal agency denied the application in October 2010.Morrissey, Aaron. \\"DDOT Releases Updated Streetcar Plan.\\" DCIST. October 20, 2010. Three days later, DDOT released a new DC Streetcar map showing the Anacostia Line terminating at the Anacostia Metro station.Kravitz, Derek. \\"Details Emerge for D.C. Streetcars, Set to Begin in 2012.\\" The Washington Post. October 24, 2010. However, in October 2009, construction began on the new United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) headquarters on what used to be the west campus of St. Elizabeths Hospital. As the first DHS headquarters building neared completion,Medici, Andy. \\"Homeland Security Further Delays Headquarters Project.\\" Federal Times. February 19, 2012. the need for a streetcar line to move DHS workers from the Anacostia and Congressional Heights Metro lines into the heart of Anacostia became urgent. Federal and city officials also wanted to find a way to link the 8th Street Marine Corps Barracks and United States Navy facilities at the Washington Navy Yard to the DHS campus. DDOT and the Federal Transit Administration began holding a series of public meetings to determine how to link the 11th Street Bridges with DHS. By June 2011, three public meetings had been held, in which 10 alternate routes for the streetcar line had been identified.Khan, Sarah. \\"H Street Streetcars Now On Track to Run By 2013.\\" The Washington Post. June 30, 2011. In January 2012 the fourth public meeting narrowed the routes down to four alternatives for linking the Anacostia Metro station to the bridges.McArdle, Terence. \\"D.C. News in Brief.\\" The Washington Post. January 19, 2012. =Proposed 11th Street Bridges recreation project= 11th Street Bridges from the water in 2018 DDOT originally planned to tear down the spans of the existing 11th Street Bridges, but leave the piers standing. The agency planned to connect the bicycle/pedestrian lane on the new local-only span with two of the piers left over from the demolition of the downstream span. Pedestrian observation platforms would be built on the piers. At both ends of the local-only span, the city also proposed building fishing piers, which would extend into the Anacostia River. The overlooks and fishing piers were expected to be completed in the fall of 2012 or the spring of 2013. However, in March 2012 the Office of Planning within the D.C. Mayor's office proposed retaining the downstream span and turning it into a recreational destination. The inspiration for the concept came from New York City's High Line, a linear park and aerial greenway built on a section of the former elevated New York Central Railroad spur. The Office of Planning's initial concept proposed building a new superstructure on the piers, complete with utilities (electricity, natural gas, sewage, fresh water). A self-sustaining public-private partnership would develop parks, restaurants, and outdoor entertainment features on the span. City planners argued the concept would connect parks and trails along both sides of the Anacostia River, provide a \\"destination attraction\\" in the city's impoverished Southeast which could enhance retail sales as well as economic development in the area, and provide badly needed outdoor recreational facilities to residents of the Anacostia neighborhood. The cost of building a new span was estimated at between $25 and $35 million. The city made its planning proposal about 45 to 60 days before demolition was to have begun on the existing span. It said it would hold a national design competition in the summer of 2012. Reaction to the plan was mixed. Attendees at the city's meeting were reported to be highly enthusiastic. But Beth Purcell, president of the Capitol Hill Restoration Society, called the plan \\"bizarre\\" and argued that the city should not delay construction of the overlooks and fishing piers in favor of an unstudied design proposal with no funding. David Alpert, of the prominent local blog Greater Greater Washington, was more muted in his criticism. Writing for The Washington Post, he pointed out that the \\"recreation bridge\\" connected two neighborhoods of only moderate population density, and was not easily accessed from either side of the river. He argued that the space would have to have enough activity and importance to make it a \\"destination\\" space day and night. He cautioned that the space could easily turn into a dead zone or encourage crime and that the space would have to be connected to the 11th Street Bridges local-only span's bicycle/pedestrian lanes. He also suggested that one or more DC Streetcar stops be created along the bridge. See also  References External links * \\"The 11th Street Bridges: What & Why.\\" Anacostia Waterfront Initiative.

According to Strabo, it is named for a group of Pelasgians. The summit is occupied by the ruins of a Byzantine-Venetian castle, below it, roughly midway down the slope of the mountain, is Panagia Katakekrymeni- Portokalousa monastery, and the Monastery of Agia Marina (Saint Margaret) at Argos, a nunnery. The site was fortified and in continuous use for nineteen centuries. History =Ancient= In Mycenean times, the principal settlement and temple were on the Aspis hill, to the north of Larisa. This community that kept its main cemetery on the col of Deiras, between them, which in classical time became the location of the Deiras Gate. The eastern slope of Larisa and the flat ground to its east was settled in the Late Bronze Age by the Dorians, and their settlement and temple became the nucleus of Classical Argos. Long walls (analogous to the Athenian Long Walls) connecting to Nauplion were begun circa 421 B.C. by Athenian masons. At one point, in fear of a threatened Spartan invasion, the Argives committed unskilled men, women and slaves to work on the wall; despite these efforts, the wall was only half-completed when Argos was attacked by King Agis II of Sparta, whose men pulled down all the walls. Argive history is somewhat sketchy for part of the next century due to unsettled conditions there -- according to an Athenian court case of Pseudo-Demosthenes, the Argolic Gulf was full of pirates who sold their stolen goods in the agora at Argos with impunity -- but at some point before 272 B.C. the city was re-walled, as it had walls and gates when it was attacked by Pyrrhus of Epirus, who was killed there after he and his men were trapped when the gate through which they wished to retreat was blocked by the corpse of a slain war elephant. The later walls connected dual citadels on Larisa and Apsis, and then continued around their eastern slopes to surround the classical city. There were gates at each of the cardinal directions: the Gates of Deiras to the west (on the road to Mantinea); the Nemean Gate to the north on the road to Nemea; the Eileithuian Gate to the Heraion of Argos and Epidaurus and the Kylabris Gate on the road to Nauplia, both to the east; and a gate to the south that led to Tegea. They surrounded only the important parts of the classical city and did not attempt to reach the sea at Nauplia like the earlier long walls, extending a maximum of only 300 meters east from Larisa before turning north to eventually complete their circuit at Aspis. By the second century B.C., Argos and the Achaean League were allied with Philip V of Macedon who was at first an opponent, then an ally of Rome. The Argives were split between pro-and-anti-Roman parties. The pro-Romans signed a treaty with the Romans against Philip and brought in the Achaean commander Ainesidemos, while the anti-Romans summoned a Macedonian force under Philokles to support them. The two sides clashed in the agora beneath Larisa, but the outnumbered Ainesidemos surrendered his force. Ainesidemos negotiated a truce under which his men were permitted to leave the city, but he himself refused the offer and was put to death. In 198 Philip met with representatives of the Achaean League to negotiate the return of Argos and Corinth to Achaean control, but he instead decided to give the city to Nabis, the reformist king-tyrant of Sparta, who then occupied Larisa and Aspis with his troops and sent many of the aristocracy into exile or to Sparta as hostages. The Achaeans then approached Titus Quinctius Flamininus, who had already promised to hand over both cities to the Achaeans if he defeated Philip. After Philip's defeat at the Battle of Cynoscephalae, Flamininus marched his army to link up with the Achaean force at Cleonae, from whence they proceeded to the Argive plain to besiege Argos. Nabis had further fortified both citadels. After initial skirmishing, Flamininus waited outside the walls to see if the Argives would rise up against Nabis; when they did not, he was persuaded by his Greek allies to march south to attack Sparta instead, as the Spartans were the ultimate source of the conflict. Eventually this move forced Nabis to surrender Argos to the Achaean party. The Romans initially occupied both Larisa and Aspis, but Flamininus kept his word and evacuated Roman troops from them and from the Acrocorinth in 194 B.C. Larisa fell to the Ostrogoths under Alaric I in 395 A.D., who sold many of the inhabitants into slavery, and it fell to a Slavic incursion in 600 A.D. =Middle Ages= The Byzantines founded a new castle there in the 12th century. In 1212, it was captured by the Crusader Geoffrey of Villehardouin. It was surrendered to the Duke of Athens, Otto de la Roche, in exchange for military assistance, becoming one of the chief fortresses of the Lordship of Argos and Nauplia. In the 14th century it underwent repairs to its foundations, and under its new bailiffs, the brothers Walter and Francis Foucherolles, held fast despite the depredations of the Catalan Company, which had conquered the Duchy of Athens, and were threatening the Argolid as well. In 1388, Argos and Nauplia were sold by the last heiress, Maria of Enghien, to the Republic of Venice. Before Venice could take control, however, the Despot of the Morea Theodore I Palaiologos, and his ally and father-in-law Nerio I Acciaioli seized them with the aid of an Ottoman army under Evrenos. Although the Venetians were quickly able to oust Nerio from Nauplia, Argos remained in Theodore's hands for six years. In 1393, Theodore, along with other Byzantine and Serbian vassals were summoned to Serres by the Ottoman sultan Bayezid I. After the other vassals complained of Theodore's behavior in using Albanian mercenaries to add Argos and other places in the Peloponnese to his dominions, Bayezid ordered Theodore to accompany him on a military expedition in Thessaly, and the cession of Argos and Monemvasia to Ottoman control. Theodore obeyed, but later escaped and recovered Monemvasia, but agreed to sell Argos to Venetians, which they occupied on 11 June 1394. A year later, Argos town was sacked by troops of the Ottoman dynasty fresh from their victory over a Crusader army at the Battle of Nicopolis; these had already temporarily occupied Athens and would go on to defeat Theodore before ravaging the rest of the Peloponnese and then withdrawing. cited in Argos and Larisa remained in Venetian hands until conquered by the Ottomans at the outbreak of the First Ottoman–Venetian War in 1463. =Modern= In 1821 the castle at the summit was captured by Demetrios Ypsilantis in the Greek War of Independence. It played little to no role in subsequent military actions. A nunnery had been built on the slopes in the 18th century, followed by a male monastery (now a church) in the 19th century. At one point during the War of Independence the monastery was briefly used as a national mint to strike coins for the provisional government, before this function was transferred to a facility on Aegina.

It tells the story of the sensitive daughter of divorced, irresponsible and narcissistic parents. The book follows the title character from earliest childhood to precocious maturity.  Plot summary  When Beale and Ida Farange are divorced, the court decrees that their only child, the very young Maisie, will shuttle back and forth between them, spending six months of the year with each. The parents are immoral and frivolous, and they use Maisie to intensify their hatred of each other. Beale Farange marries Miss Overmore, Maisie's pretty governess, while Ida marries the likeable but weak Sir Claude. Maisie gets a new governess: the frumpy, somewhat ridiculous, but devoted Mrs. Wix. Both Ida and Beale soon cheat on their spouses; in turn, Sir Claude and the new Mrs. Farange begin an affair with each other. Maisie's parents abandon her and she becomes largely the responsibility of Sir Claude. Eventually, Maisie must decide if she wants to remain with Sir Claude and Mrs. Farange. In the book's long final section, set in France, the older (probably teenaged) Maisie struggles to choose between them and Mrs Wix, and concludes that her new parents' relationship will likely end as her biological parents' did. She leaves them and goes to stay with Mrs. Wix, her most reliable adult guardian. Literary significance and criticism What Maisie Knew has attained a fairly strong critical position in the Jamesian canon. Edmund Wilson was one of many critics who admired both the book's technical proficiency and its judgment of a negligent and damaged society. When Wilson recommended What Maisie Knew to Vladimir Nabokov, the author of Lolita, Nabokov said he thought the book was terrible. F. R. Leavis, on the other hand, declared the book to be \\"perfection\\". The psychoanalytic critic Neil Hertz has argued for a parallel between James' narrative voice and the problem of transference in Freud's Dora case. An eponymous film adaptation was released in 2012, directed by Scott McGehee and David Siegel, and starring Julianne Moore, Alexander Skarsgård, and Onata Aprile. It is based largely on James' plot, with some alterations. The film is set in present-day New York City, and the professions of Maisie's parents are changed. Unlike in the book, Maisie's foster parents are highly dependable and love her and each other deeply. Maisie finds a happy life with them, and the character of Mrs. Wix is virtually eliminated.

It is also known from Santa Cruz Island.Howard JL. 1992. Pickeringia montana. In: Fire Effects Information System. USDA FS. Rocky Mountain Research Station, Fire Sciences Laboratory. It is one of very few legumes native to the chaparral habitat. Its nitrogen-fixing ability helps it thrive in rocky, sandy soil. The plant is also well-suited to a landscape of hills, slopes, and recently burned areas; its roots spread quickly and help anchor loose soil, preventing erosion. Description The chaparral pea rarely sprouts from seed. More often it sends up new stems from roots growing outward from the mother plant. It forms low, dense, thorny thickets of shiny dark green leaves. In spring and summer the plant blooms in bright magenta flowers. It bears pods containing pealike seeds. There are two subspecies of chaparral pea: * Pickeringia montana subsp. montana is widespread in California. * Pickeringia montana subsp. tomentosa, sometimes called woolly chaparral pea, is limited to the hills of southern California.

Its stated goal is to help discover where to go and meet like-minded people. WAYN was founded in 2002. WAYN has been known to send spam emails to all contacts of its users. Others have raised concerns that they misuse users data to make money. Other sources of income include showing advertising for places a person is visiting. Like some other social networking sites, WAYN enables its users to create a profile and upload photos. Users can search for other users and link them to their profiles as friends. In 2015 it claims to have over 20 million users. In late 2016, the website was bought by Lastminute.com for 1.2 million which allows the project to continue but was insufficient to pay off debts. Before the sale the site had been losing money and traffic.  History  WAYN was founded in 2002 in London by Jérome Touze (Co-CEO), Peter Ward (Co-CEO) and Mike Lines (CTO), after two of them came up with the idea to connect people based on their location while having a few beers in their local pub. WAYN initially grew through word-of-mouth and reached almost 50,000 members by the end of 2004. Following its relaunch in May 2005 it reached over 2.5 million members by the end of 2005. On 26 March 2012 the site claimed \\"over 19.1m members\\". The business started with initial seed funding in 2003 from the original founder of Friends Reunited. In 2006, the WAYN Founders managed to complete a Series A Fund Raising of $11 million from DFJ Esprit and attracting famous internet entrepreneurs such as Brent Hoberman (ex founder of lastminute.com), Hugo Burge (CEO of cheapflights.co.uk), Adrian Critchlow and Andy Phillips (ex founders of Active Hotels) and Constant Tedder (ex CEO of Jagex, an online gaming company) and was referred to at the time as the 'MySpace of Travel'.

Her memoir, Birding on Borrowed Time, explores this achievement. She traveled the world multiple times to find birds in their habitats. She was described as having had an excellent memory, and a strong competitive spirit. After receiving a melanoma diagnosis at age 50, Snetsinger took-up birding avidly, becoming known as a sharp observer who kept detailed notes. Her multiple expeditions around the world to often remote locations occasionally proved to be dangerous. Initially driven to join the competition of seeing the most birds by the prognosis that her cancer was fatal, she died in a vehicle accident while birding in Madagascar about 18 years after the diagnosis.  Early life and education  Phoebe Burnett was born on June 9, 1931, to Naomi Geddes and Leo N. Burnett and was raised in Lake Zurich, Illinois. She attended a small elementary school in Lake Zurich with only two other students. At the age of 11, she met her future husband, David Snetsinger (who was 13), at a 4-H club. She went on to study at Swarthmore College and graduated with a degree in the German language. After her husband's military service in Korea, they both went on to study for master's degrees, and she obtained a masters in German literature. Her father was Leo Burnett, a legend in the advertising industry, from whom she inherited many traits and a considerable fortune after his death in 1971. These funds aided in paying for numerous trips in pursuit of her later life hobby.  Birding career and melanoma diagnosis  Snetsinger was inspired to begin birding after seeing a Blackburnian warbler in 1961. Her first bird watching trip was in 1965 in Minnesota with a friend. She became locally known as a successful birder in the 1970s. Snetsinger was spurred to find the most birds after her doctor diagnosed her with terminal melanoma in 1981, the year she turned 50 years old. Instead of convalescence at home or pursuing treatments, she took a trip to Alaska to watch birds, and returned home to find the cancer in remission. The cancer went into remission about five years at a time, then would recur. She sought surgical treatment for one recurrence. After that Alaska trip, Snetsinger travelled widely to identify birds and see new places in the world. She visited remote areas, sometimes under unstable political conditions, to add to her growing life list. As an amateur ornithologist, she took copious field notes, especially regarding distinctive subspecies, many of which have since been reclassified as full species. When Snetsinger began observing birds, there were about 8,500 known species, compared to about 10,000 in the year of her death. In 1995 she submitted a list of 8,040 species she had documented to the American Birding Association (ABA) and to the Guinness Book of World Records. She was the first person to exceed 8,000 species observed, in 1995. By the time of her death, she had identified and documented 8,398 species, nearly 85% of the known species in the world. Her observations included 2,000 birds in monotypic genera, that is, the only species in the genus. Her detailed notes on the birds she saw were expected to lengthen her list, as some were likely to be identified as new species after her death. Reviewing the biography of Snetsinger by Olivia Gentile, Frank Graham, Jr. compared her strong competitive spirit with that of Danica Patrick in auto racing and Judit Polgár of Hungary in chess, both women successful in male- dominated fields. Snetsinger travelled about four months each year, spending the rest of the year studying photos of birds, quite aware of the competition. Her mother saw this activity as that of \\"a bird afraid of being caged.\\" She missed her mother's funeral and the wedding of one of her daughters while on trips to observe birds. The long time of remission gave her a sense of invincibility, though she endured injuries, and in Papua New Guinea, she was gang-raped by five men with machetes. She returned to Papua New Guinea the next year. Her treks took her to deserts, swamps, jungles and mountains on every continent several times over. Over her career, she survived malaria, a potentially deadly boat accident, and being taken hostage in Ethiopia. According to birder Nate Swick, birding in 2016 is much less effort than when Snetsinger did her work of observing birds in their habitat, as many nations have promoted ecotourism to strengthen their economy, and Snetsinger is seen by other birders as a pioneer. Tony Bennett, who knew her from birding in New Mexico, said she was the \\"consummate craftsman of bird-watching . . . intense, and knowledgable[sic].\\" Memoir Snetsinger's memoir, entitled Birding on Borrowed Time, was published posthumously in 2003 by The American Birding Association (ABA). The publisher described it in this way: \\"More than merely a travel narrative, the book is also a profoundly moving human document, as it details how Phoebe Snetsinger's obsession with birds became a way of coping with terminal illness.\\" Awards and honors In 1994, the Guinness Book of Records named her \\"the world's leading bird-watcher\\". In a 1995 interview, \\"Snetsinger says a serious birder who goes out with experienced companions once a week might accumulate 200 new species in a year as she once did. After a year like that, however, the pace slows down drastically, since you will have seen almost all the state's common species.\\" She was acknowledged as the \\"current world record holder, with more than 8,000 bird species to her credit\\" In 1999, the Guinness Book of Records said of Phoebe Snetsinger: \\"TOP BIRD- WATCHERS Phoebe Snetsinger of Webster Groves, Missouri, has spotted 8,040 of the 9,700 known bird species since 1965\\". In 2010, she was described as one of two people ever to see more than 8,000 species of birds. To honor Snetsinger on her 85th birthday, on June 9, 2016, a commemorative Google Doodle was posted.  Death  On November 23, 1999, while on a birding trip in Madagascar, the van in which Snetsinger was riding overturned, killing her instantly. The final bird she observed before the accident was the red- shouldered vanga, a species which had been described as new to science only two years before, in 1997. Personal life Phoebe and David Snetsinger had four children, three of whom are bird researchers in the United States. At the time of Phoebe's death, Carol was involved in research on birds in Alaska and Montana; Susan was \\"a student of the spotted owl in the Northwest\\" of the U.S.; and Thomas was researching endangered species of birds for the federal government. Their third daughter, Penny, is a chemistry professor at Sacred Heart University in Fairfield, Connecticut. As described by Frank Graham, Jr. in his review of Olivia Gentile's biography of Snetsinger, Life List, her earlier hobby before bird watching was writing poetry, which Graham, Jr. describes in this way: feelings which he describes as being more thoroughly addressed by her later developing aspiration to document species of birds. At the time of her death, Snetsinger was a resident of Webster Groves, Missouri, a suburb of St. Louis.

The company was founded in 1981 and folded in 2006. It was originally a subsidiary of Neoplan, but later became an independent licensee. Its main factory was located in Lamar, Colorado.Trolleybus Magazine No. 268 (July–August 2006), p. 92. National Trolleybus Association (UK). . Its headquarters was also in Lamar, until moving to Denver in 2004. At one time, it also had production facilities in Honey Brook, Pennsylvania, and Brownsville, Texas. Neoplan opened its first American manufacturing facility in Lamar, Colorado in 1981. It was a plant on an site. The city of Lamar, a farming town of 8,000 that faced tough economic times, pushed to have the plant built in the town in the hope of diversifying their economic base. It donated land and roads for the manufacturing site. The street that went to the plant was renamed Gottlob Auwaerter Drive, after the name of the founder of Neoplan, the name of which it did business as. Company officials were reported to look for a rural site \\"because of their conviction, based on experience in Europe, that rural workers have a better work ethic and are more reliable and productive employees\\". Neoplan manufactured standard-floor buses, low-floor buses, and articulated buses. Later in 1981, its first year of operation, Neoplan sold 46 articulated buses to Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority. This was also a year when “articulated” buses, extra-long buses that bent in the middle, were gaining interest with transit departments. As the federal government was phasing out subsidies for mass transit, these buses got attention because they were cost effective. They carried more passengers and saved on labor costs, as they required only one driver. Neoplan's share of the United States bus market was 1.3 percent in 1981, grew to 10.4 percent in 1982, and went to 25.2 percent in 1983 based on production orders. In 2003–2006 it also built 28 electric trolley buses and 32 articulated dual-mode buses for Boston's MBTA. Neoplan had 625 employees and revenue of $810 million before it ceased operations in January 2006. Neoplan USA filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in August 2006, listing assets of $13.7 million and debts of $59 million, after closing its manufacturing plant in 2006. In its last few months of operation, Neoplan had fallen on hard times, such as warranty issues with San Francisco's MUNI and cash-flow problems after Boston's MBTA canceled an order due to late deliveries.Page expired - MSN Money The company still technically continued to exist until selling its parts-supply division, Neopart. Once Neopart was sold, in October 2007, Neoplan USA ceased to exist. Manufacturing Defects When Neoplan opened in Lamar in 1981, company officials said the plant would employ up to 500 people, and manufacture as many as 500 vehicles a year on two assembly lines. Their contracts included 50 transit buses for Metropolitan Atlanta Transit Authority and 40 for Milwaukee. Contracts for another 500 were being bid on. Throughout its history Neoplan buses had a series of manufacturing defects. Washington D.C. In June 1983 76 buses from Neoplan were purchased by the Metro Transit Authority of Washington D.C. for $12.5 million. In 1984 Metro found hairline cracks in 32 Neoplan buses. The cracks were in the undercarriage of the buses, “...in a weld joining a steel frame above the rear axle with a component that helps support the bus suspension system.” On December 23, 1984 a Neoplan bus in operation was destroyed in a fire, caused by a faulty electrical circuit. A National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) investigation found the fire was due to excessive amperage in a protective circuit breaker and an absence of a cutoff switch. In February 1985 cracks were found in all of the remaining 75 Neoplan buses in service in D.C. These cracks were near the front axles and could have led to loss of steering control. Other cracks were found in steel plates, tubes and welds. This led to Metro halting the service of all Neoplan buses, which mainly served the southeastern Washington D.C. area. Neoplan USA president Robert Lee pledged to repair the buses at the company's expense, saying it was a minor repair that did not create safety problems. Fairfax County Supervisor Joseph Alexander, a member of the Metro Board, criticized the Neoplan bus purchases back in 1983, stating Neoplan buses were frequently defective and that other transit systems had filed complaints. Neoplan won the bid for Metro because they had underbid General Motors, a competing bus manufacturer, by $275,000. Metro officials were also given tours by Neoplan of their manufacturing facilities and were convinced to buy the buses afterwards. In March 1985, Neoplan followed the recommendations of the NHTSA in 1984 and recalled all 2,000 buses in service nationwide, because of the widespread problem of cracks in the suspension systems and electrical problems. The recall was done by Neoplan to avoid opening an investigation by NHTSA, and Neoplan continued to deny the cracks were safety issues. In May 1985 an agreement was reached for Neoplan to pay for repairs to Metro buses, costing about $1 million. Neoplan was criticized for failing to meet deadlines agreed to with the authority. In a letter dated May 3, 1985 Neoplan stated there “is no safety-related basis for the vehicles currently being held out of service”, saying the actions by Metro were “unreasonable and unjustified.” Los Angeles Since the early 1980s Neoplan was a contractor for Southern California Rapid Transit District, which became the Los Angeles Metropolitan Transit Authority. In September 1984 cracks were found in 128 Neoplan buses, more cracks found in 92 buses up to February 1985. Neoplan in the 1990s had a high problem occurrence rate in many of its methanol and ethanol fueled buses. On January 4, 2000, a report by MTA Inspector General Arthur Sinai cited several problems on about 250 new Neoplan buses delivered between 1997 and 1999. They included a dozen chronic defects on clutches, problems with exhaust pipes and engine oil reservoirs, failing door structures and defective wheelchair lifts. The report also noted that “none of these problems were remedied by the manufacturer.” The report noted problems went unfixed for long periods, and if repaired often done at MTA expense instead of under warranties. Some warranty claims were refused by Neoplan due to lateness in processing complaints. The report also noted conflicts of interest with MTA inspectors. Three MTA personnel took jobs with Neoplan after leaving the MTA, with one of them working with Neoplan one month after their resignation. Many inspectors who spent time at the Lamar plant physically were caught fudging travel and expense accounts for nearly $10,000 in a 7-month period ending in 1997. One MTA engineer accused of account padding was charged with grand theft in Los Angeles in 1999. Pittsburgh The Port Authority of Pittsburgh bought 159 low floor buses from Neoplan that were put into service in 1999, costing $47.7 million, or up to $300,000 apiece. Cracks in the frame were found shortly afterwards, and the buses were pulled out of service. Neoplan agreed to pay for repair for buses under warranties, and compensated the Port Authority for additional costs associated with the defects on the buses. It was reported that these same bus models underwent testing by the Federal Transit Administration in 1994 and 1995, and problems were detected in these tests. One test in May 1994 found a bus breaking down after being driven 94 miles, and structural cracks happened after 482 miles. In 1995 cracks were found in 10 different places in the steel frame, air cooler outlet and axle mounts.

The term was used by medieval Paracelsus and those after him, such as Jan Baptist van Helmont. To define it, the philosophers maintained that the Archeus was the segment of the closest quadrant of the higher worlds which blends with some similarity to the highest vibrations of our physical world. Essentially it was seen as the \\"gray area\\" wherein matter, speaking parallel and not laterally, begins to transmute into spiritual energies. In effect it is the glue which binds the heavens to the material, and so allows the maxim \\"As above, so below.\\" Apart from the Archeus, which is primarily a Platonic name for the subject, this sphere is also called the Anima Mundi, Soul of the World, Spirit of the World, The Transitive LVX, The Path of Saturn (connecting Malkuth and Yesod in the system of Jewish mysticism called the Kabbalah), the Earth Sphere and the Zone Girdling the Earth. It is also sometimes simply called the lower astral sphere, or the \\"geographic\\" region of it, as everything in the Archeus parallels physical manifestation. The term was also used for the nature of fire, or the 'fire lodged in the center of the Earth', to which was ascribed the generation of metals and minerals, and which was believed to be the principle of life in vegetables. The philosophy which discusses the Archeus in the most detail is medieval hermetic science, where we find the occult author Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa speaking at length about a previously purely platonic subject. This he likely derived from his teacher in hermetic science, a man by the name of Trithemius, who studied extensively under certain Neoplatonic philosophers. It is worth mentioning that the Archeus can be broken down into four different ethers: Chemical, Life, Light, and Reflective. To discuss them briefly as certain mystics saw them, the Chemical Ether composes the substances within which energies responsible for the perpetuation of chemical actions in the world exist. The Life Ether composes the substances through which the Vital Force exists and is transmitted, and which forms a matrix to hold in the Life Spark of a living thing. All living things contain both a chemical and life aura to them; the former, to the clairvoyant, is usually a subtle light-red flame. The latter is usually a static streaming of blue and white light. The Light Ether is the highest ether at play in the physical world, and is the actual medium by which means the programmed virtues of objects travel down from the higher spheres of existence and impregnate their appropriate physical vessels. It is with the property of this ether that we are most concerned, for some of the greatest miracles in magic are accomplished by manipulating the virtues which objects and circumstances receive. It bears mentioning that it is through this Life Ether that the soul of a living thing is given unto a body. The Reflective Ether does not so much importantly act upon the physical world, but does in occasion anyway. If the Akashic Library is to be seen as the Memory of God, then the Reflective Ether would be the memory of Earth. It is through the replay of such memories that so-called hauntings are often created. But the ethers may be reserved for a later lecture: in the mean time let us refer to the matter at hand. As previously mentioned, the Light Ether brings virtues from higher spheres down into this one, and this requires elaboration. There is a chain of descent from the First Cause, which some call God, all the way to our physical world. In the First Cause all things are one, combined. As they emanate outwards from this First Cause they begin to divide according to Intelligent Design. Like begins to attract like, opposites begin to repel one another, and in a short time there is a vast array of different combinations of energies which may be called their own units.

He is remembered as an exceptional full-back and one of the most famous Māori rugby players. He was inducted into the New Zealand Sports Hall of Fame in 1990. In 2004 he was selected as number 65 by the panel of the New Zealand's Top 100 History Makers television show. Nepia was featured in a set of postage stamps from the New Zealand post office in 1990.Stanley Gibbons stamp numbers 1560 and MS1561 Historian Philippa Mein Smith described him as \\"New Zealand rugby's first superstar\\".Philippa Mein Smith, A Concise History of New Zealand, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005, , p.148 Early life George Nepia passport application, 1924 Nepia was born in Wairoa in Hawkes Bay. While his birth certificate stated that Nepia was born in 1905, he later claimed to have been born in 1908. (Furthermore, in a 1924 passport application, he claimed that he was born on July 25, 1904, in Nuhaka, east of Wairoa.) After finishing primary school in Nuhaka, Nepia was to attend Te Aute College but went to the nearby Maori Agricultural College instead. In 1926, Nepia married Huinga Kohere. They had four children, three sons and a daughter. Nepia and his family settled on a dairy farm on the East Coast.  Rugby football career  Nepia was selected for the Hawkes Bay provincial rugby team in 1922. At that time Hawkes Bay had one of the strongest teams in New Zealand and held the Ranfurly Shield. Nepia initially played on the wing but was later shifted to second-five eighth. George Nepia passport photo, (1924) In 1924 Nepia was selected as a full-back for the All Blacks tour to the United Kingdom. Nepia was one of the stars of the tour. He played in all 32 games – being the only player to do so, and scored 77 points. As the team did not lose any matches, they came to be known as The Invincibles. Nepia was a fine full-back, with a safe pair of hands, a strong kicking game and a fierce tackle. Before games on the tour, he led the team's performance of a haka which had been composed for the tour. Nepia was omitted from the 1928 All Blacks tour of South Africa, probably on racial grounds. Nepia returned to the All Blacks for tours to Australia in 1929 and against the British Lions in New Zealand in 1930. These were his last games for the All Blacks. In 1935 Nepia went to England to play rugby league professionally being signed initially by Streatham and Mitcham Rugby League Club in London for £500. His family remained in New Zealand. Because rugby union was a strictly amateur game at the time, Nepia was cast out from rugby union. Nepia later transferred to Halifax. In 1937 he returned to New Zealand and played league for Manukau and played for the New Zealand Māori and New Zealand rugby league team.George Nepia at Dictionary of New Zealand Biography During July and August 1937 Nepia traveled to the South Island, representing both Hornby and Canterbury.Coffey, John. Canterbury XIII, Christchurch, 1987. In 1947 the New Zealand rugby union held an amnesty allowing former league players to return to rugby union. Nepia played a first- class match in 1950 against a Poverty Bay side captained by his eldest son (also called George). This made Nepia the oldest New Zealander to play in a first-class game, and was the only time a father has played against his son in a first-class game.  Later life  Following his retirement from playing rugby Nepia became a referee and worked as a farm manager in the Wairoa district. In 1975 his wife Huinga died. Nepia lived out his final years with his son Winston in Rangitukia. He died in 1986.

History At the beginning of the Twentieth Century, spring-fed Orcutt Lake was the watering hole for a ranch belonging to Colonel Adolphus D. Orcutt, a native of Kentucky and a Civil War veteran. Orcutt moved his family from Kentucky to Indian Territory in 1870, settling in what was then part of the Creek Nation. Colonel Orcutt originally rented the land from an unidentified member of the Creek tribe for the purpose of raising cattle. He created a cattle watering hole from a natural spring on the property. His son, Samuel Augustus (\\"Gus\\") Orcutt, also a native of Kentucky, went into the ranching business. Gus married a Creek woman named Annie Hodge in 1890. When the Creek lands were allotted the Orcutts became the owners of around the stock pond. In 1908, a group of developers led by Colonel Orcutt's son, purchased in Orcutt Addition to build a park and an artificial lake. The amusement park, built by the lake in 1909,Debbie Jackson & Hilary Pittman, \\"Throwback Tulsa: Visitors still flock to Swan Lake, Tulsa's first playground,\\" Tulsa World, June 18, 2015 marked the end of the trolley line by 1910. Other park facilities included an enclosed dance pavilion, a natatorium (swimming pool), an airdrome, and, later, a $7,600 roller-coaster. By 1917, Orcutt Lake Amusement Park had become a residential area and was renamed Swan Lake. In 1917, Gus Orcutt sold his development to Tulsa businessman and developer, E. J. Brennan, who coined the name Swan Lake. Brennan donated the lake itself to the City of Tulsa as a public park in 1917. \\"Living Places: Swan Lake Historic District\\" 2011. Accessed June 6, 2015. The amusement park facilities (and the trolley line) are long gone, replaced by imposing mansions during the 1920s, but the lake remains to the present. Property contained within the District was annexed by the City of Tulsa during 1917–18. Orcutt Lake as it looked in 1904 The central feature of the lake, a large rustic concrete fountain, was rebuilt by the WPA in 1938. The water supply to Swan Lake was cut off during a drought in 1948. Much of the water in the lake evaporated, while the rest became stagnant. The lake was later drained and refilled, but the surrounding infrastructure had deteriorated in the meantime. The drain line collapsed and pests such as mosquitos and rats proliferated. The condition recurred during the 1950s and 1960s. A 1983 city bond issue funded a major renovation campaign that brought the area back; 1986 saw the lake drained again, and by 1987 a $1 million facelift had been completed. The refurbishment even included restocking the lake with desirable wildlife such as Trumpeter swans. However, the large central concrete fountain fell into disrepair in 2000 and has not been refurbished. Description Swan Lake is the focal point of the district of the same name. Two-story houses built around the lake from 1919 to the present represent a variety of architectural styles including Spanish, Georgian Revival and vernacular interpretations honoring the swan. The remainder of the neighborhood is similar in scale, containing bungalows, two-story houses, quadruplexes and six-plexes of stone, clapboard and stucco. The Swan Lake area has more two- and three-story, 1920 to 1930 multi-family apartments and duplexes than any other residential area in Tulsa. The district includes the commercial area on 15th Street. The neighborhood of Swan Lake was designed and laid out in a smaller than normal street grid system. This design identified from the beginning a desire for an enhance focus on pedestrian traffic and an indirect focus on neighborly community interaction. Supporting this idea is the quantity of community organization and community activities that are prevalent year round. Such a community involvement identifies a true connection between the neighborhood and the citizens that call it home. Noted Tulsa architect, Joseph R. Koberling, Jr. chose to build his own home in the district in 1944. The house at 1543 South Swan Drive is still used as a private residence.

Biography =Early years= Gregory Calvert was born during the Great Depression, in a squatter's shack on the slopes of the Mount St. Helens volcano. As a boy, he lived with his Finnish grandparents on a small farm—Finnish was his first language. He was an excellent student, and eventually won a much-need Weyerhaeuser scholarship to Oregon State University. After graduation with a degree in history, a Woodrow Wilson fellowship enabled him to begin work toward a graduate degree in European History at Cornell University. He spent a year in Paris, then returned to the US in the fall of 1963, where he was offered and he accepted a teaching position as an Instructor at Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa. At Ames, he taught the very popular History of Western Civilization course and was the creative force behind, and the faculty advisor for, the alternative weekly student newspaper \\"The Liberator.\\" Greg was able to bring intellectuals of world renown to the campus to speak and read from their works, including Paul Goodman and Stephen Spender. =SDS involvement= In the Fall of 1965, with about a dozen others, Greg started a local chapter at Iowa State University of the budding Students for a Democratic Society (SDS). He left that post with Jane Adams, the National Secretary, in the Spring of 1966. Greg was himself elected National Secretary that summer at the 1966 convention at Clear Lake, Iowa. His election was part of the \\"prairie power\\" move of the organization away from the East Coast from where the organization had largely been controlled up to then. He played an important part in how the March on the Pentagon in 1967 unfolded—he prevented a suicidal charge by the demonstrators on the soldiers guarding the entrance of the Pentagon by persuading them to sit down instead. He was a pacifist who believed in non-violent methods of confrontation, and left SDS when it split into the Progressive Labor Party and Weatherman factions at the summer convention in 1969. =Later years= While living in Austin, Texas in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and as Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) was ending, Calvert inspired a range of ongoing new left educational projects. For instance, his brother Alex Calvert together with David MacBryde and others started The Armadillo Press. He then also went on to work for the Illinois State Drug Rehabilitation program in the early 1970s. Calvert encouraged people around, and occasionally wrote for, the alternative newspaper The Rag, published from 1966 to 1977. Calvert had a lifelong interest in Buddhism, and set up a practice as a Buddhist psychotherapist in the late 1970s. He finished his doctoral studies at UC Santa Cruz in \\"History of Consciousness.\\" Calvert and Ken Carpenter, his partner from 1977 until his death, established an intensive Spanish language school, Casa Xalteva, in Granada, Nicaragua in 1995. He died of complications from diabetes and lung disease in Albuquerque, New Mexico in 2005.

In a post-war interview, Heim asserted that the only documentation for his arrest was Hitler's order – no indictment, sentence or explanation. He learned, unofficially, that Hitler had been unwilling to cast blame on the Romanians for the poor quality of their troops so a German scapegoat was needed. German army and army group commanders were too valuable, so the \\"... only person left was the corps commander, and that was me.\\" Heim was informed in May 1943 that his dismissal from the German army had been revoked, and that he had been classified as retired. In August 1944, Heim returned to command German forces at the \\"fortress\\" of Boulogne, a \\"defend to the last\\" assignment. He was instructed to prepare significant defences but he arrived to find that nothing had been prepared and there were no suitable specialists to do the work. The ill-prepared and ill-suited garrison endured heavy bombardment and full-scale assaults when the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division launched Operation Wellhit. Heim surrendered to the Canadians on 23 September 1944. Post-war Heim was sent to a series of POW camps (including Island Farm) in Britain and subsequently repatriated to Germany on 12 May 1948. He died at Ulm on 14 November 1977.LEO-BW Awards * Iron Cross (1914) 2nd Class (18 November 1914) & 1st Class (31 December 1917) * General Honour Decoration for Bravery (Hesse) (15 December 1915) * Golden Military Merit Medal (Württemberg) (2 January 1916) * Honour Cross of the World War 1914/1918 (29 December 1934) * Clasp to the Iron Cross (1939) 2nd Class (21 September 1939) & 1st Class (2 October 1939) * Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross on 30 August 1942 as Generalmajor and commander of the 14.

The show's characters are shaped like Russian nesting dolls. In the show, children Wayne, Eubie, Twinkle, and Kip learn about all of the important jobs that people do in Higglytown. 65 episodes were produced. The theme song of the show, Here in Higglytown, is performed by They Might Be Giants, which was also released on their second children's album Here Come the ABCs. Higglytown Heroes had reruns on Disney Junior on its cable and satellite channel replacing SOAPnet on March 23, 2012. The Higglytown Heroes TV series was made using Alias Maya which was used to design models and textures for the Higglytown Heroes Characters, and Photoshop which was used to create the 2D backgrounds and 2D props. The lyrics to the first \\"Hero\\" song were written by Kent Redeker, one of the show's executive producers. The song was composed and produced by Mark Harrison, the show's senior songwriter. Hero Song Each episode contains two songs. An initial \\"dilemma\\" song which sets up the \\"problem\\" which needs to be solved followed by the \\"I'm a Higgly Town Hero\\" song which introduces the hero who solves the problem, some of the heroes would later appear in later episodes. While every hero song has the same basic melody as the initial hero song written by Harrison, he performed and produced each song with different lyrics and instrumentation to fit the episode's specific hero. Brad Mossman, the other principal songwriter, composed lyrics and music for a number of dilemma songs in many episodes as well. In 2011, Relient K re- recorded the theme song for the show for Disney Junior - Live on Stage! This show was re-dubbed in the UK sometime between 2005 and 2010, which aired in the UK on Playhouse Disney on April 11, 2005. In the UK dub, Fran is voiced by veteran actress Sue Johnston, Eubie is voiced by Jonathan Bee and Joe Cooper, Wayne is voiced by Africa Nile, Twinkle is voiced by Amira McCarthy, and Kip was voiced by Matthew Thomas Davies, this also included most of the character cast in the show who ware voiced by the majority of the actors in the UK. Pizza Guy is called Pizza Man instead, causing minor lip-sync issues, most of which would probably not be noticed by the show's target audience.

A musicology pupil of Guido Adler,Martin Brody, Black Mountain College: Experiment in Art (MIT Press, 2003: ), p. 246. Jalowetz was among Schoenberg's first students in Vienna, 1904-1908.

After emigrating to the USA in 1938 he taught at Black Mountain College, North Carolina. Though his name is less widely known than that of many of Schoenberg’s more famous students, Schoenberg regarded Jalowetz very highly indeed. He is one of the seven ‘Dead Friends’ (the others being Berg, Webern, Alexander Zemlinsky, Franz Schreker, Karl Kraus and Adolf Loos) to whom he once envisaged dedicating his book Style and Idea, with the comment that those men ‘belong to those with whom principles of music, art, artistic morality and civic morality need not be discussed.

It is set in Acton, London and is based on the 2003 Nicci French book of the same name, directed by Christopher Menaul and starring David Tennant, Claire Goose and Kate Ashfield. Overview When Miranda (Kate Ashfield) meets attractive and confident Brendan (David Tennant), a seemingly harmless fling ensues. But her attempt at breaking it off with him leads to a passionate web of lies, deception and death. Plot summary While attending a friend's birthday party, Miranda Cotton meets the handsome Brendan Block. The two sleep together that night and begin a relationship. Ten days later, Miranda arrives home to find that Brendan has let himself in and gone through her belongings. She promptly ends the relationship, causing Brendan to storm out of her flat after verbally abusing her. A month later, Miranda is contacted by her sister Kerry, inviting her to meet her new boyfriend: Brendan Block. Miranda warns Brendan against hurting her sister, but he replies that he is genuinely in love with Kerry. As time passes, it becomes apparent to Miranda that Brendan is using his newfound engagement to her sister and increasingly close relationship with her family as a way of getting at her. Her family become close to Brendan; in particular her younger, bipolar brother Troy (Robert Daniel Lowe). When Troy commits suicide, Miranda's concerns about Brendan are strengthened. Brendan then dumps Kerry for her best friend, Laura, whom he marries. Three months later, Laura contacts Miranda, suggesting they talk. Miranda waits at a pub for her, but Brendan arrives and accuses her of meddling in his marriage. After an argument, Miranda goes to check on Laura and discovers her dead body. Brendan is suspected of killing his wife, but a prosecution is not made due to lack of evidence. Miranda becomes obsessed with proving Brendan's guilt. She tracks down Brendan, who is living with a new girlfriend named Naomi. Miranda attempts to warn Naomi about Brendan's violent nature, but she is thrown out by Brendan. He takes out an injunction on Miranda, accusing her of harassment. Receiving a call from Naomi shortly after, Miranda goes to the apartment not knowing it is a setup by Brendan in order to have her arrested. Naomi contacts Miranda from outside, telling her to leave, and Miranda narrowly escapes Brendan and the police. Naomi tells Miranda that Brendan became violent and she feared for her safety. After deciding that Naomi would be safe staying with Kerry, Miranda returns to her flat. That night, Brendan arrives and angrily searches for Naomi, to no avail. He says that Miranda pushed him into doing some things he wouldn't usually do before raping her. The next day, a colleague of Miranda's finds the flat in disarray, as well as blood and tape in the bathroom. Upon the conclusion that Miranda has been murdered, an investigation ensues with Brendan as the prime suspect. Naomi finds a set of bloodied keys in Brendan's suit pocket and hands it in to the police. Brendan is arrested for Miranda's murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. Six months later, Miranda's family receive three plane tickets from Naomi, asking them to come to Australia, where she now resides. When they arrive, they meet Naomi at the airport and see Miranda. A flashback explains that Miranda and Naomi planned to drug Brendan by slipping a pill into his glass the night he arrived at the flat. Naomi is shown drawing blood from Miranda, which Miranda then spreads around the bathroom after Brendan slips unconscious. She plants his fingerprints onto his set of keys which have been smeared with her blood. Then, posing as Laura, Miranda flees England to Australia to stay with Naomi's parents until Brendan is arrested. After putting Brendan away, Miranda pauses to think about her brother Troy, who is the only person missing at the table where she and her family are happily eating.

The compromise helped gather enough support for the Constitution to ensure its ratification and lead to the adoption of the first ten amendments, the Bill of Rights. Anti-Federalists feared the Constitution would lead to a over-centralized government and diminish individual rights and liberties. They sought to amend the Constitution, particularly with a Bill of Rights as a condition before ratification. Federalists insisted that states had to accept or reject the document as written. When efforts to ratify the Constitution encountered serious opposition in Massachusetts, two noted anti- Federalists, John Hancock and Samuel Adams, helped negotiate a compromise. The anti-Federalists agreed to support ratification, with the understanding that they would put forth recommendations for amendments should the document go into effect. The Federalists agreed to support the proposed amendments, specifically a bill of rights. Following this compromise, Massachusetts voted to ratify the Constitution on February 6, 1788. Five states subsequently voted for ratification, four of which followed the Massachusetts model of recommending amendments along with their ratification.

It is common in some communities in Malaysia and Papua New Guinea, as it confers some resistance to cerebral Falciparum Malaria. Pathophysiology =Southeast Asian ovalocytosis= It is hereditary haemolytic anaemia in which the red blood cell is oval-shaped. The primary defect in SAO differs significantly from other forms of elliptocytosis in that it is a defect in the gene coding for a protein that is not directly involved in the cytoskeleton scaffolding of the cell. Rather, the defect lies in a protein known as the band 3 protein, which lies in the cell membrane itself. The band 3 protein normally binds to another membrane-bound protein called ankyrin, but in SAO this bond is stronger than normal. Other abnormalities include tighter tethering of the band 3 protein to the cell membrane, increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the band 3 protein, reduced sulfate anion transport through the cell membrane, and more rapid ATP consumption. These (and probably other) consequences of the SAO mutations lead to the following erythrocyte abnormalities: *A greater robustness of cells to a variety of external forces, including: Reduction in cellular sensitivity to osmotic pressures Reduction in fragility related to temperature change greater general rigidity of the cell membrane Loss of sensitivity to substances that cause spiculation of cells *Reduced anion exchange Figure 3 - A representation of the steps involved in the entry of Plasmodium falciparum into an erythrocyte. *Partial intracellular depletion of ATP *A reduction in expression of multiple antigens These changes are thought to give rise to the scientifically and clinically interesting phenomenon that those with SAO exhibit: a marked in vivo resistance to infection by the causative pathogen of malaria, Plasmodium falciparum. Unlike those with the Leach phenotype of common hereditary elliptocytosis (see above), there is a clinically significant reduction in both disease severity and prevalence of malaria in those with SAO. Because of this, the 35% incidence rate of SAO along the north coast of Madang Province in Papua New Guinea, where malaria in endemic, is a good example of natural selection. The reasons behind the resistance to malaria become clear when given an explanation the way in which Plasmodium falciparum invades its host. This parasite is an obligate intracellular parasite, which must enter the cells of the host it is invading. The band 3 proteins aggregate on the cell membrane at the site of entry, forming a circular orifice that the parasite squeezes through. These band 3 proteins act as receptors for the parasite. Normally a process much like endocytosis occurs, and the parasite is able to isolate itself from the intracellular proteins that are toxic to it while still being inside an erythrocyte (see figure 2). The increased rigidity of the erythrocyte membrane in SAO is thought to reduce the capacity of the band 3 proteins to cluster together, thereby making it more difficult for the malaria parasite to properly attach to and enter the cell. The reduced free ATP within the cell has been postulated as a further mechanism behind which SAO creates a hostile environment for Plasmodium falciparum.

The 10-year projections cover economic growth, employment by industry and occupation, and labor force. They are widely used in career guidance, in planning education and training programs, and in studying long-range employment trends. These projections, which are updated every two years, are part of a nearly 60-year tradition of providing information on occupations to those who are entering the job market, changing careers, or making further education and training choices. Employment projections Overall employment is projected to increase about 14 percent during the 2010–2020 decade with more than half a million new jobs expected for each of four occupations—registered nurses, retail salespersons, home health aides, and personal care aides. Occupations that typically need postsecondary education for entry are projected to grow faster than average, but occupations that typically need a high school diploma or less will continue to represent more than half of all jobs.

In addition, Shermans have been modified by several nations from modernization upgrades to complete hull conversions for another task.  Overview  Sherman ARV MK I, Recovery vehicle, photographed around Caen in July–August, 1944 The many special duties that a tank might be made to do were just being explored by armies around the world in the early 1940s. Theories of what vehicles were supposed to be engaging enemy tanks changed as vehicles like the Sherman often found themselves up against enemy armor, and consequently some of the most important initial changes centered around upgunning the basic vehicle. Improving the vehicles mobility, protection, and creating specific variants for infantry support roles soon followed. Similar modification of the main armament would be done by the British, who received a number of Shermans during the course of the war. Many early variants of the Sherman were converted to armored personnel carriers (\\"Kangaroos\\"), or armoured recovery vehicles. More radical variants followed, first with experiments with flotation screens in preparation for the invasion of Europe by Allied forces in 1944, and later by mounting rocket launching equipment on the turret. Extensive work on creating mine clearance devices to be attached to Shermans in some fashion was also conducted up until the end of the Second World War. After the end of the Second World War, large numbers of surplus Shermans were supplied to other nations, but primarily to South America and the Middle East. Israel became the largest post-war user of Sherman tanks, conducting extensive modifications to keep them in front line service right up into the early 1970s as tanks, mobile artillery pieces, armored ambulances and more. Many saw action in the 1973 October War. Similar modifications and purchases of Israeli-modified Shermans were done in South America where they served on as the last fighting Shermans right up until 1989. US variants M4(105).

Variants served in all theaters, and were the basis of a number of conversions for various uses, including armored personnel carriers and specialized engineering vehicles. Post-war variants The M4 Sherman pattern enjoyed a lengthy post-war service all over the world. They were used well into the 1960s and 1970s by some nations, mainly in Africa and Latin America. In some cases, the vehicles were converted for use in a variety of other roles from mobile artillery to ambulances. Conversions were also made for use in civilian industry.

It is the transfer of solid waste from the point of use and disposal to the point of treatment or landfill. Waste collection also includes the curbside collection of recyclable materials that technically are not waste, as part of a municipal landfill diversion program. Household waste Household waste in economically developed countries will generally be left in waste containers or recycling bins prior to collection by a waste collector using a waste collection vehicle. A waste collection barges are used in some towns, for example in Venice, Italy. However, in many developing countries, such as Mexico and Egypt, waste left in bins or bags at the side of the road will not be removed unless residents interact with the waste collectors. Mexico City residents must haul their trash to a waste collection vehicle which makes frequent stops around each neighborhood. The waste collectors will indicate their readiness by ringing a distinctive bell and possibly shouting. Residents line up and hand their trash container to the waste collector. A tip may be expected in some neighborhoods. Private contracted waste collectors may circulate in the same neighborhoods as many as five times per day, pushing a cart with a waste container, ringing a bell and shouting to announce their presence. These private contractors are not paid a salary, and survive only on the tips they receive. Later, they meet up with a waste collection vehicle to deposit their accumulated waste. The waste collection vehicle will often take the waste to a transfer station where it will be loaded up into a larger vehicle and sent to either a landfill or alternative waste treatment facility.

It was published in 1968 by Whitman, and was the first original novel based on the series; the first novel for adult audiences, Spock Must Die!, was not published until February 1970. Mission to Horatius details the adventures of the crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise investigating where a distress signal had originated, resulting in them engaging with several different human colonies. The novel was written by Mack Reynolds, and was Whitman's only original fiction based on the series. The producers of Star Trek had issues with the book, as they were concerned that it was dull and poorly written, in addition to containing offensive descriptions of both Sulu and Uhura. Gene Roddenberry intervened, stating that he would rather call off the publishing deal than see the property harmed. It was corrected, but Roddenberry was still dissatisfied with the novel. As Whitman had gone out of business years earlier, Pocket Books was able to re- publish the book in celebration of holding the Star Trek license for 20 years. Plot synopsis The U.S.S. Enterprise is headed to Starbase 12 for shore leave, supplies and repairs. Food is running low and the engines need servicing. A distress signal diverts the ship to a solar system on the outer edge of explored space. Upon hearing of the emergency mission, Dr. McCoy expresses his concern about the mental health of the crew to Kirk. In Dr. McCoy's opinion, the Enterprise has been on patrol for such a long period of time that the crew is in danger of developing a form of space madness known as cafard. Upon reaching the NGC 400 solar system, the Enterprise crew comes across three planets populated by different human settlers who had been unhappy with the social or political order of Earth. One planet has reverted to a Stone Age state, another has a mid-20th Century technology while the third maintains a level of technology capable of space travel and advanced weaponry. Kirk and crew must determine who sent a distress signal and the nature of the emergency. Along the way, they encounter a warrior society, a planet where drugs are used to control the general population and a culture consisting of an elite class with clones handling the day-to-day chores required by society. Production The first works of fiction based in the Star Trek universe were the Star Trek comic books, which began publication in 1967. These were followed the same year by short story adaptations of the episodes of Star Trek published by Bantam Books and written by James Blish.Ayers (2006): p. xi Mission to Horatius became the first original fiction published in novel form based on the Star Trek series when it was published in hardcover by Whitman in 1968, and the only original novel to be published while the original Star Trek was still being broadcast. It was written by Mack Reynolds, and illustrated by Sparky Moore. Issues with the novelization were first raised with the producers of the television show by John Meredyth Lucas, who contacted both Desilu Business Affairs and Gene Roddenberry, warning them that the novel was \\"not technically in bad taste, but is extremely dull, and even considering the juvenile market, badly written\\".Alexander (1995): p. 339 He added that it contained several inaccuracies including describing Vulcans as VulcaniansThis was not an inaccuracy, the term is used with that meaning in Roddenberry's non-fiction volume The Making of Star Trek published in 1968 and an issue with Spock quoting poetry. There were concerns that Sulu had been described as a \\"bland faced, small oriental\\" and that Uhura was called a \\"negress\\" and sings a spiritual. Roddenberry wrote of his concern with the project on November 14, 1967, to Desilu Business Affairs, saying that he agreed with Lucas' comments, and that Star Trek \\"is a valuable property worth protecting and I personally would rather blow a deal like this than see the property harmed.\\"Alexander (1995): p. 340 Despite corrections, Roddenberry wrote a five-page dissection of \\"Mission to Horatius\\" describing what he felt was wrong with the novel. The first original Star Trek novel for adults, Spock Must Die!, was not published until February 1970.Ashley (2007): p. 214 While Whitman did not publish any other Star Trek novels, it did publish a range of coloring books based on the series.Kelley (2008): p. 65 \\"Mission to Horatius\\" was re-published by Pocket Books in February 1999 to celebrate the publisher's 20th anniversary of holding the official Star Trek license. Editor John J. Ordover stated, when interviewed for Jeff Ayers' Voyages of Imagination, that it was reprinted for fun, and that when pitched he had explained that Paramount Studios held the rights to the book as Whitman had gone out of business. He added \\"It was selling for $50 at conventions. So why not do a reissue? It was the first Star Trek novel ever done and the first one I read.\\"Ayers (2006): p. 131 In order to re-publish the work, Pocket Books bought a second-hand copy from science fiction author Dayton Ward. Reviews Most reviews are lukewarm although criticism of plot developments or characterizations are usually muted by an acknowledgment the book was aimed at younger readers.

Instead, she received a k-primary supervisor certificate from the University of Chicago in 1913. Hill eventually went on to receive her baccalaureate from the same university in 1922. May also earned her graduate degree from Columbia University in 1924. May Hill married Charles Crisswell Arbuthnot in 1932. They met later in her career, while he was head of the economics department at Western Reserve University (now Case Western Reserve University).Miller, M. (2003). Arbuthnot, May Hill. In Miller, M. (ed) Pioneers and Leaders in Library Services to Youth: A Biographical Dictionary. (pp. 6-7). Wesport, CT: Libraries Unlimited, Inc. Career =Early career= May Hill Arbuthnot held many jobs while she was continuing her education. She was a kindergarten teacher and director in Wisconsin, lead a teacher training program in New York City, and taught children's literature at the University of Chicago. In Pioneers and Leaders in Library Services to Youth, Marilyn Miller describes how Arbuthnot contributed to the beginning of nursery training schools in Ohio. In 1922, she became the principle of a kindergarten primary training school in Cleveland, Ohio. In 1927, with her valiant efforts, this training school became the department of elementary education at Western Reserve University. After directing this move, Arbuthnot became an associate professor at the university. This school became a key school in teaching and training professionals and parents alike in the development of children and children's literacy. She continued this career until 1950, which was her year of retirement. Arbuthnot also contributed in other ways to children's literacy. She was a review editor where she reviewed children's books for Children’s Education from 1933-1943 and then for Elementary English from 1948–1950. =Published books= May Hill Arbuthnot's biggest contribution to the field of library and information science was her wide array of published books. For higher education Arbuthnot authored the textbook, Children and Books. First published in 1947, the book has gone on for multiple editions, co-authored by Zena Sutherland. This book was used in children's literature classes for many decades. Another contribution to children's literacy was the Basic Reader Series. In 1947, Arbuthnot and William S. Gray, a friend from the University of Chicago, developed and co- authored this series for early readers. The series was quite popular, and is now well known as the first of the Dick and Jane series. Besides the popularity of this series, it did not come without criticism. Some critics believed Arbuthnot “valued function over literary merit”. Even after Arbuthnot retired from being an associate professor at the University, she continued to publish books and give lectures. Some of her last contributions to the publishing world are her anthologies. After retirement, she built many anthologies that were made to point educators of children to collections of books that would accompany their teachings. Two of the well known anthologies include Time for Poetry (1951), and Arbuthnot Anthology of Children’s Literature (1953). Both of these have continued on with multiple editions. Awards May Hill Arbuthnot received two awards after her retirement. In 1959, the Women's National Book Association honored her with the Constance Lindsay Skinner Medal (now named WNBA Award). This award honors “a living American woman who derives part or all of her income from books and allied arts, and who has done meritorious work in the world of books beyond the duties or responsibilities of her profession or occupation”.Women’s National Book Association. (2010) “The WNBA Award (for individual women).” (cited January 29, 2011). In 1964, she was recognized with the Regina Medal from the Catholic Library Association. This medal honors excellence in the field of children's literature. Its recipient is recognized for their “continued, distinguished contribution to children’s literature without regard to the nature of the contribution”.Catholic Library Association. (2010) “Regina Medal.” (cited January 29, 2011). The Arbuthnot Honor Lecture and Arbuthnot Award First established in 1969 by the Association for Library Service to Children (ALSC), a division of the American Library Association (ALA), and in conjunction with Scott, Foresman and Co., the Arbuthnot Honor Lecture is put on by a person in the profession of children's literature. This includes historians, librarians, educators, critics, or authors.American Library Association. (2011) “The May Hill Arbuthnot Honor Lecture Award.” (cited January 29, 2011). In the inaugural lecture, Arbuthnot spoke of the importance of the “spoken word,” that she spent many years “…bringing children and books together by way of spoken word”. The Arbuthnot Award, given out by the International Reading Association, is a yearly $800 awarded to excellence in teaching having to do with children or young adult literature at the college level.International Reading Association. (2011) “Arbuthnot Award.” (cited January 29, 2011). Conclusion Her philosophy can be further explained by her introduction to the book, The Real Mother Goose, by Blanche Fisher Wright. In this introduction, she explains her idea of the importance of books for children. She believed a very simple philosophy of books to be possible of garnering huge interest from children, and in turn, children will increase their literacy skills by enjoying and rereading them over and over. Also, parents have the ability to help children learn just by reading and interacting with them. She describes how the hardware of the book helps to facilitate learning. She goes on to describe this learning style by saying, “As a result, children will know more words and speak them more crisply and clearly than they would have without Mother Goose. Above all, they will carry with them some feeling for the fun, freshness and sheer delight of poetry. All this because of Mother Goose.” Arbuthnot, May Hill.

Results of creeping As a result, the faders (potentiometers that operate by sliding up or down) or volume controls (rotary potentiometers) on the mixing board or audio processor gradually \\"creep\\" toward the maximum volume setting, which reduces the ability to manipulate the relative volumes between channels. It can also result in clipping or distortion of the master mix, which is when the overall volume of sound is too great for the equipment or recording medium intended to hold it. Multi track problems with creep Fader creep can be a particular problem in audio mixing sessions for multi- track recordings, where individual sounds held on separate audio tracks, or delivered by outboard MIDI or computer audio equipment are combined into the final stereo presentation of the recording. For example, an engineer might compensate for a particularly loud drum track by raising the volumes of the voice, the guitar, and the piano to the point where all of the individual signals are competing for headroom. A better solution is to lower the volume of the drums, and adjust the other channels accordingly. Live concert creep In audio mixing for live concerts, fader creep can result when ear fatigue (the diminishing of the ability for the human ear to hear clearly after prolonged exposure to loud sounds) reduces the ability of the sound engineer to hear the individual components of the mix (i.e. separate instruments and voices on the stage) accurately.

He was born in Paris, the illegitimate son of Gaétan Vestris and Marie Allard (1742–1802). His father was a Florentine dancer who had joined the Paris Opéra in 1748, his mother was a French dancer in the same theatre. He was dubbed \\"le dieu de la danse\\", (the god of dance), a popular title bestowed on the leading male dancer of each generation (previous 'Gods of the Dance' included his father Gaétan and Gaétan's teacher, Louis Dupré). He made his debut at the Paris Opéra (as had his mother, Marie Allard) in the third divertissement of the pastorale La Cinquantaine (written by Desfontaines-Lavallée and set to music by Jean- Benjamin de La Borde) in 1772 and was immediately recognized for his talent. He was accepted as a regular member of the troupe in 1775, became a soloist in 1776, a \\"premier danseur\\" (principal dancer) in 1778, and finally he was appointed \\"premier sujet de la danse\\" (roughly corresponding to modern étoile) in 1780, holding this rank in the corps de ballet for the next 36 years.Pitou, Spire, The Paris Opéra.

Its history dates to 1895, making it the earliest continually existing high school athletic organization in the country. It also provides the licensing program for more than 10,000 officials in the state, and oversees junior high or middle school athletics in about 100 of the state's nearly 400 school districts. Among its duties are the administration of state tournament series in its various sports, overseeing eligibility and conference alignment, and promoting sportsmanship.WIAA 86th Annual Yearbook 2008-2009. History The WIAA considers its start to be a meeting in December 1896 of part of the state teachers association following a state track and field meet organized by the University of Wisconsin–Madison. Meetings led to the formation of a rules committee, followed by a Board of Control, which is still the WIAA's governing board. It has 11 members, seven chosen by regions, three at-large and a representative from the Wisconsin Association of School Boards. An Advisory Council, made up of 18 members, also provides governance and advice. It is made up of 15 members, five each from large, medium and small schools, a gender at-large representative, a minority at-large representative and a nonpublic school representative. Until 2000, only public schools were WIAA members. Private schools had belonged to the Wisconsin Independent Schools Athletic Association. When that organization announced it would shut down, the WIAA changed its rules to allow private schools. The WIAA, unlike some other states, does not add a multiplier to enrollment of private schools to contend with perceived advantages private schools have in drawing athletes. The WIAA held its own state track meet in 1897 and its first state boys' basketball tournament in 1920. For boys' sports, it added cross country (1913), golf (1923), tennis (1925), and swimming (1925). In the 1940s, wrestling (1940), volleyball (1948) and baseball (1948) were added; in the 1950s, skiing and curling, and in the 1960s, gymnastics. These sports have been dropped by the WIAA. 1965 also brought a second baseball tournament, this one for summer participants, which was dropped after the 2018 season due to dwindling participation. Ice hockey was added in 1970, Soccer (1982) was added, and volleyball, which had been dropped (in 1982), returned to tournament status in 2000. Football was a recognized sport but championships were only held briefly in the 1920s. The WIAA resumed playoffs in 1976. The WIAA started adding girls sports in the 1970s. Swimming (1970) was the first, followed by gymnastics, track, and tennis in 1971, golf (1972), and volleyball (1973). Cross country joined the list in 1975, then basketball and softball (1976). Girls' soccer added a state tournament in 1983. The most recent addition was ice hockey in 2002. Sports offered The number of classes - referred to as divisions by the WIAA, and numbered so that 1 includes the largest schools while higher numbers include smaller schools - varies by sport. Except for football, all schools sponsoring a sport are in the tournament. Seeding is used for matchups in several team sports and in individual sports. The tournament structure starts with multi- team regionals, usually at the site of one school, followed by sectionals, usually at a neutral site (unless a team in the regional gets to a sectional it is hosting), and then state. *Cross country — There are three divisions for both boys' and girls' cross country. The championships are held at The Ridges Golf Course in Wisconsin Rapids. *Girls' volleyball — There are four divisions. The championships are held at the Resch Center in Green Bay. *Boys' volleyball — There is one division. Finals are held at Wisconsin Lutheran College in Milwaukee. *Baseball — There are four divisions. The WIAA State Baseball Championships are held at Fox Cities Stadium in Grand Chute. *Gymnastics — There are two divisions. Championships are held at Lincoln High School in Wisconsin Rapids. *Basketball — Both boys' and girls' basketball have five divisions. The boys' championships are held at the Kohl Center in Madison, or the Alliant Energy Center or Wisconsin Field House in years where the Kohl Center hosts NCAA Basketball Tournament regionals at the same time. The girls' championships are held at the Resch Center in Green Bay. *Football — There are seven divisions. Teams must have a .500 conference record or better to qualify for the state tournament. There are seven 32 team playoffs, with all championship games held at Camp Randall Stadium in Madison the week before Thanksgiving. *Wrestling — There are three divisions. Individuals championships are held at the Kohl Center in Madison, while team state championships are held at the University Field House in Madison. Regionals serve both individual and team competitions, with the team winning the regional going to the team sectional including all of its members, whether they qualified for the individual sectional or not. *Ice hockey — Both boys' and girls' have one division. The championships are held at Alliant Energy Center in Madison. *Track and field — There are three divisions in both boys' and girls' track and field. The championships are held at Veterans Memorial Stadium in La Crosse. *Soccer - Both boys' and girls' soccer have four divisions. The state tournament is held at Uihlein Soccer Park in Milwaukee. *Softball — There are five divisions. The state tournament is held at Goodman Diamond in Madison. *Swimming - There are two divisions. The state meet is held at the University of Wisconsin Natatorium in Madison. *Golf - There are two divisions in girls golf and three divisions for boys. Both championships are held at University Ridge Golf Course in Madison since 1994. *Tennis - There are two divisions for both boys and girls tennis. Championships are held at Nielsen Stadium in Madison. Conferences The WIAA added overseeing of athletic conferences to its duties in the 1980s after several disputes. Previously, schools had banded together on their own. The WIAA's role is to keep conferences consisting of similar-sized schools within a reasonable distance of each other. Except for football, conference championships do not have any effect on a team's tournament seeding. Cooperative teams In 1982, the WIAA approved cooperative teams, allowing two or more schools to combine to form a team in a sport where neither school has enough athletes to run the sport on its own. The schools are generally referred to by a hyphenated version of their school names, although some choose a unique team nickname and mascot. The schools involved must be in the same geographical area and combine for at least two years, although the WIAA may approve an early release. In addition, the conference the combined team will compete in must approve. The total enrollment of the two schools determines which tournament division the team plays in. The rule has allowed smaller schools to combine for sports such as football and track which require larger numbers, and larger schools to combine for sports with low interest.

Bački Jarak () is a town located in the Temerin municipality, in the South Bačka District of Serbia. It is situated in the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina. The town has a Serb ethnic majority and its population numbering 5,687 people (2011 census).  Name  In Serbian, the town is known as Bački Jarak (Бачки Јарак), formerly also Mali Jarak (Мали Јарак) and Jarak (Јарак); in German as Jarek, Batschki Jarak or Jarmosch; in Hungarian as Jármos or Tiszaistvánfalva; and in Croatian as Bački Jarak. Its name derived from Serbian word \\"jarak\\" (\\"trench\\" in English), while adjective \\"bački\\" refer to its location in the region of Bačka.  History  In 1267, there is mention of a place named Irig or Irišac. According to some opinions, this place was maybe located in the area of present-day Bački Jarak. This settlement was also recorded in 1703, while record from 1737 mention the existence of two settlements: Veliki Irišac and Mali Irišac. Both settlements belonged to the Futog seigniory. The modern settlement was founded and settled by Evangelical Protestant ethnic Germans in 1787 (before that, the place used to be barren area). In 1788, the settlement had 117 houses and population of 268 people. Administratively, the settlement was part of the Batsch-Bodrog County within the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary. In 1796, Temerin and Bački Jarak were sold to Count Sándor Széchényi for a price of 80,000 forints. In 1848-1849, the settlement was part of autonomous Serbian Vojvodina and in 1849–1860 part of the Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar, a separate Habsburg crown land. It was part of the Batschka-Torontal District (1849–1850) and Neusatz District (1850-1860) within the voivodeship. After the abolishment of the voivodeship in 1860, the settlement was again included into Batsch-Bodrog County. In the 1910 census, a majority of settlement inhabitants spoke the German language. In 1918, the settlement (as part of the Banat, Bačka and Baranja region) firstly became part of the Kingdom of Serbia and then part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later renamed to Yugoslavia). In 1918–19, the settlement was part of the Banat, Bačka and Baranja region and also (from 1918 to 1922) part of the Novi Sad district. From 1922 to 1929, the settlement was part of the Bačka Oblast and from 1929 to 1941 part of the Danube Banovina. From 1941 to 1944, the settlement was under Axis occupation and was attached to Horthy's Hungary. Since 1944, the town is part of autonomous Yugoslav Vojvodina, which (from 1945) was part of new socialist Serbia within Yugoslavia. In 1944, as a consequence of World War II events in Yugoslavia, one part of 2,000 Yugoslav citizens of German ethnicity left from the area, together with defeated German army. Those who remained in the area were sent to communist prison camps and one of such camps was located in Bački Jarak. After prison camps were dissolved (in 1946), most of the remaining German population left Yugoslavia in subsequent decades, mainly because of economic reasons. In 1946-1947, Bački Jarak was settled by (mainly ethnic Serb) migrants from Bosnia and Herzegovina (Bosnian Krajina) and Croatia (Lika). Post-World War II population censuses recorded Serb ethnic majority in the town. Some of the old houses of the German families, built vertically towards the road (na duž) and known as the Swabian houses, still survive. The remaining houses, though mainly from the 19th century, were designed in the Josephinism style which originated in the second half of the 18th century, during the rule of emperor Joseph II. Family names were written on the façades and some are still visible, like that of Johann Wallrabenstein, who is described in chronicles as a \\"distinguished householder\\". As both Bački Jarak and Temerin developed in recent decades, they now form one continuously built-up area.  Demographics  Ethnic groups (2002 census): *Serbs = 5,838 *Hungarians = 43 *Croats = 30 *Yugoslavs = 22 *Rusyns = 13 *Macedonians = 11 *Slovaks = 10 *Germans = 7 *others  Sport  Popular sports in Bački Jarak are football, handball, table tennis and karate.

It is the national bird of Costa Rica, where it is well known as the yigüirro (Spanish: ). Other common names include clay- colored robin. It ranges from South Texas (where it is rapidly expanding its range) to northern Colombia; west and north of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. It is limited to the Atlantic slope, except for a population around Oaxaca City, Mexico that probably originates from escaped cage birds. Description In general appearance and habits it resembles other Turdus thrushes such as the American robin. It is about the same length or slightly smaller: , and weighs on average. The plumage is brownish, somewhat lighter below than above, lightest on the flanks. Birds from humid regions are darker than those from dry regions. The throat is faintly streaked. Immature birds have faint mottling on the back and underparts. The bill is greenish-yellow with a dark base, the legs are pinkish or flesh-colored, and the irises are reddish—all useful identification points. The song, rather low-pitched and with a slow steady tempo, consists of many slurred musical phrases which are often repeated irregularly. The tock flight call is like the American robin's but harsher. Ecology Juvenile bird, San José, Costa Rica In much of its range it is familiar in yards and gardens, similar to some other thrushes such as the American robin, the Eurasian blackbird, and the song thrush. In 1977, the Costa Ricans chose the yigüirro as a national symbol (over many much more colorful birds that inhabit the country) due to its strong and melodious song that always comes during the start of the rainy season. In addition, unlike many of the forest songsters of Costa Rica, the present bird has been familiar to the general population since the country's early history, thanks to the species' tendency to live near houses and settlements. The clay-colored thrush usually forages for fruit or invertebrates on the ground or near it, singly or in pairs, but flocks may feed high in fruiting trees. It will follow army ants to feed on small prey disturbed by the ant columns. It builds a heavy cup nest of grass, moss, feathers, leaves and mud on a firm support above the ground, which may include human constructions such as windowsills. It lays 2 to 4 pale blue eggs with red-brown and gray markings between March and July and may double-brood. It is aggressive in defense of its nest, having been known to mob raptors as large as golden eagles, but is not otherwise particularly territorial. Aggressive defense against brood parasites may explain why it has not evolved complete recognition of brood parasite eggs; it is one of only very few species of birds that are partial ejectors, with only about 25% of individuals ejecting parasitic eggs of the bronzed cowbird.

PCLN was founded on 25 July 1986 by the 22 March Communist Collective (Colectivo Comunista 22 de marzo). The collective had been launched earlier by 13 Central Committee members of the Galician People's Union (UPG) left UPG in protest of the decision of the Galician Nationalist Bloc (BNG, the coalition led by UPG) to participate in the Galician parliament. Front figures of the collective was Mariano Abalo, general secretary of UPG, and Xan Carballo, general secretary of INTG. History The 3rd National Assembly of BNG, held in O Carballiño (Ourense) in 1987, expelled PCLN on the grounds that the party had supported Herri Batasuna in elections to the European Parliament.http://www.vieiros.com/open/amosar/420/o-pcln-nunca-debeu-existir- nos-somos-a-upg In 1987 PCLN, Galiza Ceibe-OLN, Nationalist Collective of Trasancos, Nationalist Collective of Vigo, Galician Independentist Groups from Santiago de Compostela, the Iskreiro collective from A Coruña and non- organised individuals launched the Galician Popular Front (FPG). Within FPG, PCLN aimed to keep independence of the member organisations within the front. Galiza Ceibe-OLN wanted to dissolve the member organisations, and make FPG a unitary organisation. The line of PCLN became the leading one within FPG. PCLN registered itself with the Interior Ministry on 13 February 1988. Soon divisions surged within FPG. PCLN had certain reservations towards supporting the armed struggle of EGPGC, which Galiza Ceibe-OLN did. An extraordinary National Assembly of FPG was convened. Galiza Ceibe-OLN broke away from FPG and formed the Assembleia do Povo Unido (APU). In the early 1990s PCLN dissolved itself into FPG, as FPG became a unitary political party.

It was a struggle between the Polish forces of the Border Defence Corps of Gen. Wilhelm Orlik-Rückemann and the Soviet Red Army during the invasion of Poland. After the battle of Szack on September 28, the Polish commander decided to cross the Bug River and continue the fight there. After a short rest, on September 30 the Poles had crossed the river. Although largely victorious in most of the fights against the Soviets, the Polish unit was reduced to merely 3,000 men and was lacking heavy equipment and ammunition. In addition, most of the soldiers of the Border Defence Corps had been forced to cross large parts of Poland, with the average unit crossing almost 500 kilometres in two weeks. After crossing the Włodawa-Trawniki road, shortly after 1 AM on October 1, the Polish unit was attacked by a tank unit of the Soviet 45th Rifle Division. Polish Bofors 37 mm guns opened fire at close range and the Soviet unit withdrew losing four T-26 tanks. Soon after daybreak the Soviets returned, this time with the majority of 45th division's units. The Soviets, expecting the Polish unit to be completely routed and composed entirely of officers, started a frontal assault on the village of Wytyczno. However, the Polish tabors crossed the road into the forest behind the village and placed artillery posts there, which enabled the defending Poles to hold their positions. The struggle for the village continued, with both sides suffering heavy losses. At 9AM the Polish 75 mm artillery had no more than 60 shells left and the howitzers had not more than 10 per barrel. To lessen the enemy pressure on the centre of the Polish units, Gen. Wilhelm Orlik-Rückemann ordered the Polesie Battalion to attack the left flank of the enemy. However, the soldiers were too tired to start the assault and most of them simply declined to follow the order. Commander of the Sarny Regiment, Col. Nikodem Sulik, reported that the Polish defences were getting weaker with every hour and with all probability the battle would end by dawn with a complete Polish defeat. At 10.30 a war council was held and it was decided that the only option for his men to survive was to withdraw, divide the unit onto smaller detachments and try to break through to the units of Independent Operational Group Polesie fighting nearby. At noon the Polish units successfully withdrew to the forests. Most of them joined the other Polish unit, while Gen. Orlik-Rückemann found his way to Great Britain through Lithuania and Sweden.

The town has a Serbian ethnic majority, and it had a population of 9,001 in 2011. Name In Serbian, the town is known as Crvenka (Црвенка), in Hungarian as Cservenka, and in German as Tscherwenka or Rotweil. The name of the town is derived from the Serbian word crveno 'red'. History In prehistoric times, the region around Crvenka was covered by water because between the Danube River and Telečka Plateau there was a large lake, which was described by Roman historians as \\"Sweet Lake.\\" At that time it was possible to travel by boat to the Fruška Gora mountains. In the city remains of prehistoric animals have been found, such as the mammoth. The region was most likely inhabited during the early Neolithic, when the region belonged to the Starčevo culture. Later the Celts settled in the area around Crvenka. In the immediate vicinity, archaeological excavations have found objects from Celtic and Roman times, including urns and pottery, as well as Celtic and Roman coins. The Roman coins, known as Follis, depict Roman Emperor Constantine the Great, and some others originated from the Republic of Venice. From the middle of the 1st century to the 4th century, the region belonged to the dominion of the Iazyges, a nomadic tribe that belonged to the Sarmatians. Starting in the 5th century, Slavs settled in the region, and from the 9th century onward also Finno-Ugric people. Crvenka was firstly mentioned in historical sources in the 16th century, during Ottoman administration. It was populated by ethnic Serbs and was part of the Sanjak of Segedin and of the Budin Eyalet. In the second half of the 17th century, this area was not populated. At the end of the 17th century, the Bačka region was captured by the Habsburg Monarchy, and in the second half of the 18th century Crvenka was mentioned as a small settlement. It was colonized by Serbs, Hungarians, and Germans. Until the middle of the 19th century, the town was part of Bács-Bodrog County within the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary. In 1848–1849 it was part of the autonomous Serbian Vojvodina, and from 1849 to 1860 it was part of the Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar, a separate Habsburg crownland. After the abolition of the voivodeship in 1860, the town was again included in Bács-Bodrog County. According to 1910 census, most of the inhabitants of the town spoke German. After 1918, the town was part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later renamed Yugoslavia). In 1918–1919, it was part of the Banat, Bačka and Baranja region, and also (from 1918 to 1922) part of Novi Sad County. From 1922 to 1929, it was part of the Bačka Oblast, and from 1929 to 1941 part of the Danube Banovina. From 1941 to 1944, Crvenka was under Axis occupation and was attached to the Horthy's Hungary. In 1944, the Soviet Red Army and Yugoslav Partisans liberated Crvenka and it was included in the autonomous province of Vojvodina within the new communist Yugoslavia. After 1945, Vojvodina was part of the People's Republic of Serbia within Yugoslavia. At the end of World War II, the ethnic German population was expelled from Crvenka, which was then populated by 4,383 people, mostly Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro. In 1948, these people comprised 63.7% of the population. Demographics =Ethnic groups= In 2002 the population of Crvenka was 10,163 people, including: *Serbs = 7,264 (71.48%) *Montenegrins = 1,313 (12.92%) *Hungarians = 493 (4.85%) *Croats = 183 (1.8%) *Yugoslavs = 156 (1.54%) *others (including Ukrainians, Pannonian Rusyns, Germans, Romani people, etc.) =Historical population= *1948: 6,879 *1953: 7,797 *1961: 9,369 *1971: 10,098 *1981: 10,629 *1991: 10,409 *2002: 10,315 *2011: 9,001 Economy Crvenka is a small town with a very strong economy, especially industry and agriculture.

Completed over a period of five years in 25 different countries around the world, it was shot in 70 mm format and output to digital format. The film premiered at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival and received a limited release in August 2012. Synopsis The official website describes the film, \\"Expanding on the themes they developed in Baraka (1992) and Chronos (1985), Samsara explores the wonders of our world from the mundane to the miraculous, looking into the unfathomable reaches of humanity's spirituality and the human experience. Neither a traditional documentary nor a travelogue, Samsara takes the form of a nonverbal, guided meditation.\\" Production Samsara is directed by Ron Fricke and produced by Mark Magidson. The pair had collaborated on Baraka (1992) and reunited in 2006 to plan Samsara. They researched locations that would fit the conceptual imagery of saṃsāra, to them \\"meaning 'birth, death and rebirth' or 'impermanence'\\". They gathered research from people's works and photo books as well as the Internet and YouTube, resources not available at the time of planning Baraka. They considered using digital cameras but decided to film in 70 mm instead, considering its quality superior. Fricke and Magidson began filming Samsara the following year. Filming lasted for more than four years and took place in 25 countries across five continents. Three years into filming, the pair began assembling the film and editing it. They pursued several pick-up shoots to augment the final product. The crew used three 70 mm cameras for filming; two cameras manufactured by Panavision and one specialty time-lapse camera designed by Fricke. While the scenes were captured on 65 mm negative film, they were output to Digital Cinema Package (DCP), a digital output. Magidson described the process, \\"We're doing a combination of what we think is the best of both technologies, the best way to image capture and then the best way to output. Once we get into the digital environment, we're able to refine the imagery, we're able to save shots that we'd have to otherwise trash really for various reasons.\\" Where they cut their negatives for Baraka, the negatives for Samsara were scanned then worked on digitally. The pair used the Telecine process to format the film to ProRes for the editing process and used Final Cut for editing. The crew filmed from a bird's-eye view a scene of pilgrims surrounding the Kaaba in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. A 40-floor building was recently constructed next to the mosque that surrounded the Kaaba, so the filmmakers were able to film the pilgrims with permission of the building's owner. =Music= The film's music was composed by Michael Stearns, Lisa Gerrard, and Marcello De Francisci. Stearns collaborated with the filmmakers on Baraka and Chronos, and Gerrard also collaborated with them on Baraka. Unlike Baraka, Samsara was edited without music, and the composers worked on numerous sequences as separate pieces. The filmmakers then connected the sequences. Magidson explained of the pieces, \\"It's a piece of music you can listen to as music as well that interprets their feelings to know that imagery in that sequence visually, so they're kind of interpreting it musically.\\" The scoring process lasted between six and seven months. Themes Fricke and Magidson emphasized avoiding a particular political view in assembling the film. Fricke said, \\"We just try to keep it in the middle and then we form little blocks of content and then we set them aside until we had enough. We did all of this without music or sound effects. We just let the image guide the flow and then we started stringing the blocks together.\\" Nicolas Rapold of The New York Times wrote that Samsara's lack of a specific message is \\"a departure from similarly expansive, globally conscious nonfiction films in vogue now, like the critically acclaimed work of Michael Glawogger ('Workingman's Death,' which depicts the same sulfur mines as 'Samsara') and Nikolaus Geyrhalter ('Abendland') that also serve as probing sociological critique.\\"Rapold, Nicolas. \\"Planetary Poetry, Women into a Movie: 'Samsara,' Ron Fricke's Cinematic Portrait of the Globe.\\" New York Times. NYTimes.com, 17 Aug. 2012. https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/19/movies/samsara-ron-frickes-cinematic- portrait-of-the-globe.html Release Samsara premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2011. In March 2012, Oscilloscope Laboratories acquired the rights to distribute Samsara in the United States. The film had a limited release in two theaters on , 2012. By its fifth weekend (September 14–16), Samsara had expanded to 60 theaters and achieved the highest-grossing documentary release of 2012. On , distributor Oscilloscope Laboratories announced that at $1.8 million in box office earnings, Samsara had become the highest-grossing film in Oscilloscope's (relatively short) history. Critical reception Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 77% based on reviews from 77 critics and reports a rating average of 7 out of 10. It reports the critics' consensus that \\"it's a tad heavy-handed in its message, but Samsara's overwhelmingly beautiful visuals more than compensate for any narrative flaws.\\" At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film received an average score of 65% based on 23 reviews, reflecting \\"generally favorable reviews.\\" Kenneth Turan, reviewing for the Los Angeles Times, called Samsara \\"as frustrating as it is beautiful.\\" Turan expressed frustration that the filmmakers did not name the more obscure locations, such as the Cebu Provincial Detention and Rehabilitation Center in the Philippines. The critic also took issue with some of the film's \\"disconcerting\\" images. Turan concluded, \\"Some of the connections made are too obvious, like following images of ammunition with a portrait of a severely wounded veteran, while others are completely elusive. Shots of the devastation Katrina left behind in New Orleans are beautifully spooky, but does it say anything useful to follow that with images of Versailles? The makers of 'Samsara' want to free our minds, but their technique makes us their prisoners more often than not.\\" In the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert awarded Samsara a full four stars, writing that it provided \\"an uplifting experience\\" through its use \\"of powerful images, most magnificent, some shocking, all photographed with great care in the highest possible HD resolution.\\" Ebert extolled the film's capturing of images of what may eventually be lost to humanity and noted that there were also images that could reflect the reason for these losses. Katie Walsh, writing for indieWire's The Playlist, applauded Samsaras \\"technical achievements\\" and noted that the film used the \\"intellectual montage\\" technique. Walsh said the film was similar to Man with a Movie Camera, but took \\"the idea to new global and spiritual heights.\\" She said of the film's entirety, \\"While one can discuss the technical prowess of these shocking and beautiful images, it doesn't do justice to the spiritual cinematic power of this work.\\" Filming locations Samsara was filmed in nearly one hundred locations across 25 countries over the course of exactly five years.

It is a small annual, with stems growing decumbent against the ground to a maximum length of 12 cm, and turning upward at the tips. The leaves are 2–4 cm long, and secrete a sticky, aromatic juice. In the spring, the grass bears a small inflorescence 1.5–6 cm long, with numerous crowded spikelets. Solano grass is a vernal pool plant. It is only found in these seasonally wet areas, a type of habitat which is endangered. This species is thought to have once grown in isolated parts the northern Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, in areas which flooded during the wet season, but any former habitat there has been long since reclaimed for agriculture. Only a few individuals of the plant now exist, mostly in Yolo County. It was found during the 1990s at Jepson Prairie Preserve, an area dedicated to conserving vernal pool habitat, but it may no longer exist there. Loss of critical habitat is the main cause of the near extinction of Solano grass. This loss is caused by land reclamation for development, recreation, and agricultural use, including for grazing animals, fertilizer runoff, and disturbance of the natural hydrology of the Central Valley. Invasive plants have also played a role in crowding out more delicate native grasses, such as Solano grass, Greene's tuctoria (Tuctoria greenei), Colusa grass (Neostapfia colusana), and several species of genus Orcuttia.

Juan was the first Arizonan to die in the war.  Biography  Juan (birth name: Matthew Bennett Juan) was a Pima Indian from the Gila River Indian Community. Juan was born in San Tan, Pinal Co., Arizona April 22, 1892 to Joseph and Mary B. Juan. Matthew grew up in the small agricultural town of Sacaton, Arizona (also the capital of the Gila River Indian Community). He stayed there until he reached high school and left for the Sherman Institute (an Indian boarding school) in Riverside, California. Upon graduation, he joined a travelling circus.[https://aivmi.org/mathew-b-juan-wwi-hero/ American Indian Mathew B. Juan, WWI Hero] In June 1917 Juan registered his Selective Service Card with the local draft board in Wichita Falls, Texas. Six months later he was drafted. He joined the 6th Co. 1st Infantry Training Regiment on December 11, 1917. He boarded the troopship SS Tuscania in January 1918, bound for Le Havre, France. The Tuscania was torpedoed by a German U-boat February 5, 1918 in the North Channel (U.K.), and 200 American Troops perished along with an additional 65 crew members of the Tuscania. Juan was rescued and taken to Ireland, and eventually made his way to the location of his regiment's encampment. On May 21, 1918 Juan was transferred to the 1st Division, 2nd Infantry Brigade, 28th Infantry, Company K. At 6:45 am Tuesday May 28, 1918, the 28th Infantry attacked the German occupied area near Cantigny, France. It was the first American offensive against German occupied territory in World War I. Juan was killed from enemy machine gun fire while advancing on the German stronghold. The grave of Matthew B. Juan His body was temporarily buried in France. In 1921 the U.S. Military exhumed the body and at the request of his mother, returned him home to Arizona. His remains were delivered to the Fisher Funeral Home in Casa Grande, Arizona where preparations were made for the final burial at the Cook Memorial Church yard in Sacaton, Arizona. He was buried with honors April 9, 1921. Juan was the first Arizonian to be killed in World War I.Arizona Military Museum web page  Pvt. Matthew B. Juan Monument  The Matthew B. Juan-Ira H.

Distances can also be measured using standard candles; many different types of standard candles and rulers are needed to construct the cosmic distance ladder.

If the R is organic, the compounds are called organic hydroperoxides. Such compounds are a subset of organic peroxides, which have the formula ROOR. Organic hydroperoxides can either intentionally or unintentionally initiate explosive polymerisation in materials with unsaturated chemical bonds. Properties The O−O bond length in peroxides is about 1.45 Å, and the R−O−O angles (R = H, C) are about 110° (water-like). Characteristically, the C−O−O−H dihedral angles are about 120°. The O−O bond is relatively weak, with a bond dissociation energy of , less than half the strengths of C−C, C−H, and C−O bonds. Use and reactions Hydroperoxides can be reduced to alcohols with lithium aluminium hydride, as described in this idealized equation: :4 ROOH + LiAlH4 → LiAlO2 \\\\+ 2 H2O + 4 ROH This reaction is the basis of methods for analysis of organic peroxides. Another way to evaluate the content of peracids and peroxides is the volumetric titration with alkoxides such as sodium ethoxide. The phosphite esters and tertiary phosphines also effect reduction: :ROOH + PR3 → OPR3 \\\\+ ROH Hydroperoxides are intermediates in the production of many organic compounds in industry. For example, the cobalt catalyzed oxidation of cyclohexane to cyclohexanone: :C6H12 \\\\+ O2 → (CH2)5CO + H2O Acetone and phenol are produced by the so-called cumene process, which proceeds via cumene hydroperoxide. Many epoxides are prepared using hydroperoxides as reagents, such as the Halcon process for the production of propylene oxide. The Sharpless epoxidation is a related reaction conducted on laboratory scale. tert-Butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) is an organic-soluble oxidant employed in these operations. The Sharpless epoxidation Drying oils, as found in many paints and varnishes, function via the formation of hydroperoxides. Formation =Ether hydroperoxides= :300px Auto-oxidation reaction is observed with common ethers, such as diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, and 1,4-dioxane. An illustrative product is diethyl ether peroxide. Such compounds can result in a serious explosion when distilled. To minimize this problem, commercial samples of THF are often inhibited with butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). Distillation of THF to dryness is avoided because the explosive peroxides concentrate in the residue. Although ether hydroperoxide often form adventitiously (i.e. autoxidation), they can be prepared in high yield by the acid-catalyzed addition of hydrogen peroxide to vinyl ethers: :C2H5OCH=CH2 \\\\+ H2O2 → C2H5OCH(OOH)CH3 =Naturally occurring hydroperoxides= Many hydroperoxides are derived from fatty acids, steroids, and terpenes. The biosynthesis of these species is effected extensively by enzymes. Illustrative biosynthetic transformation involving a hydroperoxide. Here cis-3-hexenal is generated by conversion of linolenic acid to the hydroperoxide by the action of a lipoxygenase followed by the lyase-induced formation of the hemiacetal. =Hock processes= Synthesis of cumene hydroperoxide Compounds with allylic and benzylic C−H bonds are especially susceptible to oxygenation.. Such reactivity is exploited industrially on a very large scale for the production of phenol by the Cumene process or Hock process for its cumene and cumene hydroperoxide intermediates.Brückner, R. Reaktionsmechanismen: organische Reaktionen, Stereochemie, moderne Synthesemethoden, pp. 41–42, Spektrum Akademischer Verlag, Munich, 2004, (in German) Such reactions rely on radical initiators that reacts with oxygen to form an intermediate that abstracts a hydrogen atom from a weak C-H bond. The resulting radical binds O2, to give hydroperoxyl (ROO.), which then continues the cycle of H-atom abstraction.Heinz G. O.

Government agencies received 12,000 pistols in the .32 ACP caliber with the designation P11 and were serial numbered 40001 to 52400. Design The HK4 is basically a new version and a more refined development of the Mauser HSc self- loading pistol. Heckler & Koch was familiar with HSc design, as during pre-war and post-war periods, many of the Heckler & Koch company founders were employees of the Mauser-Werke Oberndorf A.G. company. Like the HSc, the HK4 is also an unlocked recoil charger with a spring-mass lock, cocking trigger and a combined safety / release device. Switching between ammunition with central ignition (6.35 mm Browning, 7.65 mm Browning, 9 mm short) and ammunition with rim ignition (.22 lfB) is possible by simply turning the (removable) butt plate. The caliber change within the group of center fire cartridges takes place in a few seconds without tools, when changing to caliber .22 lfB you only need a screwdriver to loosen the push plate. Occasionally, the pistol grips were made from light metal (duralumin) and a partially stamped steel. As a result, the grips could come loose and possibly break unexpectedly while shooting. Reception and Legacy The HK4 is a historical firearm and marks the beginning of pistol production at Heckler & Koch. In its basic structure and the main manufacturing processes, the HK4 laid groundwork for its much more important and successful successor, the H&K; P9S. Due to its high manufacturing quality and easy caliber change, the HK4 was quite successful on the market, though did not offer serious competition to established Walther PP and PPK pistols. HK4's biggest success was the adoption by West German customs as their service weapon.

It is a primary state route, with a limited-access highway section connecting Hartford to Norwich and a full-access highway section extending to Stonington. The entire limited-access section of Route 2 is also known as the Veterans of Foreign Wars Memorial Highway. Route description Route 2 begins as a continuation of State Street (just east of Columbus Blvd) near Interstate 91 in downtown Hartford. It starts out heading east toward East Hartford. Route 2 then crosses the Connecticut River on the Founders Bridge and has a partial interchange with I-91 at the crossing. Immediately after crossing into East Hartford, there is a complex interchange with Interstate 84\\\\. Immediately after this interchange, Route 2 heads southeast in the direction of Glastonbury. There is a partial interchange with Route 15 about further. After East Hartford, Route 2 enters Glastonbury. At the East Hartford-Glastonbury town line, there is a full trumpet interchange with Route 3. About after this interchange, there is a partial interchange with Route 17\\\\. From Glastonbury, Route 2 passes into Marlborough. It continues into Colchester. In Colchester, Route 2 has a partial interchange with Route 11\\\\. After this interchange, Route 2 curves and heads east toward Norwich. Once Route 2 leaves Colchester, it passes through the towns of Lebanon and Bozrah. After Bozrah, Route 2 enters Norwich. Just after entering Norwich, Route 32 joins Route 2\\\\. Then, about down Route 2, there is a partial cloverleaf interchange with Interstate 395\\\\. About further east from the I-395 interchange, the limited-access highway section of Route 2 ends at a four-way at-grade intersection with Town Street, Harland Road (Route 169), and Washington Street (Route 32/Route 2). Route 32 then separates in downtown Norwich after overlapping with Route 2 for , following the west bank of the Thames River. Route 2 continues southeast from Norwich into Preston, and then into Ledyard. Just after entering Ledyard, Route 2 passes by the Mashantucket Pequot Reservation and then the Foxwoods Resort Casino. After passing through Ledyard, Route 2 continues into North Stonington. There is a roundabout with Route 184 and a partial interchange with Interstate 95 here. After leaving North Stonington, Route 2 heads into Stonington. Here, Route 2 is reduced to a minor arterial road. It has an interchange with Route 78 and terminates about later at the junction with US 1 just west of the Rhode Island state line. Route 2 westbound in Hartford, just before exits 2E, 2W and 3. Several Connecticut limited-access highways terminate at Route 2\\\\. Route 3 ends at Route 2 near the East Hartford- Glastonbury town line, Route 17 ends at Route 2 in Glastonbury, and Route 11 ends at Route 2 in Colchester. Route 78 also ends at Route 2, in Stonington. It is unusual that Route 78 intersects Route 2 where it is not a limited- access highway. History Two early toll roads, the Hartford and New London Turnpike and the Colchester and Norwich Turnpike, followed the alignment of current Route 2 in the 1800s. In 1922, The New England Interstate system incorporated the future Route 2 alignment as Route 17\\\\. Upon the discontinuation of the New England routes in the 1932 state highway renumbering, the eastern half of old New England Route 17 was renumbered to Route 2\\\\. The western half of old New England Route 17 eventually formed part of U.S. Route 44.F.J. Wood, The Turnpikes of New England, (Marshall Jones, 1919) Limited-access highway construction along the Route 2 alignment started in the 1950s and continued through the 1960s and early 1970s. The oldest limited-access highway segment, between exits 5A and 7, opened in 1952; the latest segment, between exits 20 and 22, opened in 1971.

Some examples of coupled systems can be read here in the section \\"Socioeconomic Drivers\\":Environmental factor#Socioeconomic Drivers As CHANS research is relatively new, it has not yet matured into a coherent field. Some research programs draw from, and build on, the perspectives developed in trans-disciplinary fields such as human ecology, ecological anthropology, environmental geography, economics, as well as others. In contrast, other research programs aim to develop a more quantitative theoretic framework focusing on the development of analytical and numerical models, by building on theoretical advances in complex adaptive systems, complexity economics, dynamical systems theory, and the earth sciences. To some extent, all CHANS programs recognize the need to move beyond traditional research methods developed in the social and natural sciences, as these are not sufficient to quantify the highly nonlinear dynamics often present in CHANS. Some research into CHANS emulates the more traditional research programs that tended to separate the social from the ecological sciences.

It is located on the edge of a basalt outcropping in County Antrim (between Portballintrae and Portrush), and is accessible via a bridge connecting it to the mainland. The castle is surrounded by extremely steep drops on either side, which may have been an important factor to the early Christians and Vikings who were drawn to this place where an early Irish fort once stood. Protected status Dunluce Castle is in the care of the Northern Ireland Environment Agency. It is a Monument in State Care sited in the townland of Dunluce, in Coleraine Borough Council area, at grid ref: C9048 4137. The earthworks, adjacent to Dunluce Castle, are a Scheduled Historic Monument, at grid ref: area of C905 412. History In the 13th century, Richard Óg de Burgh, 2nd Earl of Ulster, built the first castle at Dunluce. It is first documented in the hands of the McQuillan family in 1513. The earliest features of the castle are two large drum towers about in diameter on the eastern side, both relics of a stronghold built here by the McQuillans after they became lords of the Route. The McQuillans were the Lords of Route from the late 13th century until they were displaced by the MacDonnell after losing two major battles against them during the mid- and late-16th century. The castle in the last decade of the 19th century Later Dunluce Castle became the home of the chief of the Clan MacDonnell of Antrim and the Clan MacDonald of Dunnyveg from Scotland. Chief John Mor MacDonald was the second son of Good John of Islay, Lord of the Isles, 6th chief of Clan Donald in Scotland. John Mor MacDonald l was born through John of Islay's second marriage to Princess Margaret Stewart, daughter of King Robert II of Scotland. In 1584, on the death of James MacDonald the 6th chief of the Clan MacDonald of Antrim and Dunnyveg, the Antrim Glens were seized by Sorley Boy MacDonnell, one of his younger brothers. Sorley Boy took the castle, keeping it for himself and improving it in the Scottish style. Sorley Boy swore allegiance to Queen Elizabeth I and his son Randal was made 1st Earl of Antrim by King James I. Four years later, the Girona, a galleass from the Spanish Armada, was wrecked in a storm on the rocks nearby. The cannons from the ship were installed in the gatehouses and the rest of the cargo sold, the funds being used to restore the castle. MacDonnell's granddaughter Rose was born in the castle in 1613. A local legend states that at one point, part of the kitchen next to the cliff face collapsed into the sea, after which the wife of the owner refused to live in the castle any longer. According to a legend, when the kitchen fell into the sea, only a kitchen boy survived, as he was sitting in the corner of the kitchen which did not collapse. However, the kitchen is still intact and next to the manor house. You can still see the oven, fireplace and entry ways into it. It wasn't until some time in the 18th century that the north wall of the residence building collapsed into the sea. The east, west and south walls still stand. Dunluce Castle served as the seat of the Earl of Antrim until the impoverishment of the MacDonnells in 1690, following the Battle of the Boyne. Since that time, the castle has deteriorated and parts were scavenged to serve as materials for nearby buildings. =Dunluce town= In 2011, major archaeological excavations found significant remains of the \\"lost town of Dunluce\\", which was razed to the ground in the Irish uprising of 1641.Belfast News Letter, page 3. Saturday, 18 June 2011 Lying adjacent to Dunluce Castle, the town was built around 1608 by Randall MacDonnell, the first Earl of Antrim, and pre-dates the official Plantation of Ulster. It may have contained the most revolutionary housing in Europe when it was built in the early 17th century, including indoor toilets which had only started to be introduced around Europe at the time, and a complex street network based on a grid system. 95% of the town is still to be discovered.

Founded in 1219 by Saint Sava, as the Eparchy of Zeta, it continued to exist, without interruption, up to the present time, and remained one of the most prominent dioceses of the Serbian Orthodox Church. The current Metropolitan bishop is Amfilohije Radović (since 1990). His official title is \\"Archbishop of Cetinje and Metropolitan of Montenegro and the Littoral\\" ().Official Page of the Metropolitan of Montenegro and the Littoral History = Eparchy of Zeta (1219–1346) = Remains of the Monastery of Prečista Krajinska (15th century) The Eparchy of Zeta was founded in 1219 by Sava of the Nemanjić dynasty, the first Archbishop of the autocephalous Serbian Orthodox Church. After receiving the autocephaly from the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople and confirmation from the Byzantine Emperor, Archbishop Sava organized the area under his ecclesiastical jurisdiction into nine bishoprics. One of these was the Bishopric of Zeta (the southern half of modern Montenegro, and northern part of modern Albania). The seat of the bishops of Zeta was the Monastery of Holy Archangel Michael in Prevlaka (near modern Tivat). The first bishop of Zeta was St. Sava's disciple Ilarion ( 1219). Upon the proclamation of the Serbian Patriarchate of Peć in 1346, the Bishopric of Zeta was among several eparchies elevated to the honorary rank of metropolitanate, by the decision of the state-church council, held in Skopje, and presided by the Serbian Emperor Stefan Dušan. = Metropolitanate of Zeta (1346–1496) = Remains of the original Cetinje Monastery near the new \\"Court Church\\" in Cetinje After the dissolution of the Serbian Empire (1371), the region of Zeta was ruled by the House of Balšići, and in 1421 it was integrated into the Serbian Despotate. During that period, the Republic of Venice gradually conquered coastal regions of Zeta, including cities of Kotor, Budva, and the Bar and Ulcinj. Metropolitanate of Zeta was directly affected by the Venetian advance. In 1452, the Venetians destroyed the Cathedral Monastery in Prevlaka, in order to facilitate their plans for the gradual conversion of the Eastern Orthodox Christians from these parts of the coast into the Roman Catholic faith. After that, the seat of the Metropolitanate moved several times, transferring between St Mark's Monastery in Budva, the Monastery of Prečista Krajinska, St Nicholas's Monastery on Vranjina (Skadar Lake), and St Nicholas's Monastery in Obod (Rijeka Crnojevića). Finally, it was moved to Cetinje, in the region of Old Montenegro, where the Cetinje Monastery was built in 1484, by Prince Ivan Crnojević of Zeta. Starting from the end of the 15th century, mountainous regions of Zeta became known as Crna Gora (), meaning the Black Mountain, hence the Montenegro. In 1493, Prince Ivan's son and successor, Prince Đurađ Crnojević (1490-1496), opened a printing house in Cetinje, run by Hieromonk Makarije, and produced the first ever book to be printed among the South Slavs. It was the \\"Cetinje Octoechos\\", a Serb-Slavonic translation from the original Greek of a service book that is still used to this day in the daily cycle of services in the Orthodox Church. In 1496, entire Zeta, including Montenegro, fell to the Turks, but the Metropolitanate survived. = Eparchy of Cetinje in 16th and 17th century = The Cetinje Octoechos (1494) After 1496, the Eparchy of Cetinje (), as well as other eparchies of the Serbian Orthodox Church, continued to exist under the new Ottoman rule. It had diocesan jurisdiction over Old Zeta, known now as Old Montenegro, keeping its seat in Cetinje. It had spiritual influence over the territory between Bjelopavlići and Podgorica to the Bojana River. The eparchy also included some parts of Herzegovina, from Grahovo to Čevo. From 1557 to 1766, eparchy was under constant jurisdiction of the Serbian Patriarchate of Peć. During the 16th and 17th centuries, the bishops and the local Christian leaders led armed resistance against the Ottomans on several occasions, with some degree of success. Though the Ottomans nominally ruled the Sanjak of Montenegro, the Montenegrin mountains were never completely conquered. The bishops and local leaders often allied themselves with the Republic of Venice. At the beginning of the 17th century, Montenegrins fought and won two important battles at Lješkopolje (1603 and 1613), under the leadership and command of metropolitan Rufim Njeguš. This was the first time that the metropolitan had led and defeated the Ottomans. = Metropolitanate of Cetinje under the Petrović- Njegoš = Metropolitan Petar II Petrović-Njegoš (1830–1851) Entire territory of the Metropolitanate was severely affected during the Morean War, and in 1692 the old Cetinje Monastery was devastated. In 1697, new metroplitan Danilo Petrović-Njegoš was elected, as first among several hierarchs from the Petrović-Njegoš family, who would hold the same office in succession up to 1851. Metropolitan Danilo (1697-1735) was greatly respected, not only as a spiritual leader, but also as leader of the people. He combined in his hands both spiritual and secular power, thus establishing a form of \\"hierocracy\\". He became the first Prince-Bishop of the Old Montenegro, and continued to oppose the Ottoman Empire, while maintaining traditional ties with the Venetian Republic. He also established direct ties with the Russian Empire, seeking and receiving financial aid and political protection. His successors continued the same policy. Metropolitans Sava II Petrović-Njegoš (1735–1750, 1766-1781) and Vasilije Petrović-Njegoš (1750-1766) had to balance between Ottomans, Venetians, and Russians. During that time, metropolitans of Cetinje continued to be ordained by the Serbian Patriarchs of Peć (until 1766), and later by the Serbian Metropolitans of Karlovci in Habsburg Monarchy (until 1830). After brief tenure of Arsenije Plamenac (1781–1784), several new policies were introduced by Metropolitan Petar I Petrović-Njegoš (1784–1830), who initiated the unification process between the Old Montenegro and the region of Brda. The same process was completed by his successor Petar II Petrović-Njegoš (1830–1851), who received consecration from the Russian Holy Synod in 1833, establishing a practice that lasted until 1885. As a reformer of state administration, Petar II made preparations for separation of spiritual and secular power, and upon his death such separation was implemented. His successors became: Prince Danilo Petrović-Njegoš as a secular ruler, and metropolitan Nikanor Ivanović as a spiritual leader, new metropolitan of Montenegro. = A principal eparchy in Montenegro (1852–1918)= Metropolitan Visarion Ljubiša (1882–1884) Metropolitan Mitrofan Ban (1884–1920) The Eparchy was reorganized during the rule of Prince Danilo I (1852-1860), first secular ruler of the newly proclaimed Principality of Montenegro. Offices of ruling prince and metropolitan were separated, and diocesan administration was modernized. First metropolitan to be elected just as a church leader was Nikanor Ivanović in 1858. He was deposed and exiled in 1860 by new prince Nikola (1860-1918), who established a firm state control over the church administration. During his long reign, metropolitans Ilarion Roganović (since 1863), and Visarion Ljubiša (since 1882) undertook some important reforms of church administration. In 1878, the Principality of Montenegro was recognized as ad independent state, and it was also enlarged, by annexing Old Herzegovina and some other regions. Until that time, Eastern Orthodox Christians of the Old Hezegovina belonged to the Metropolitanate of Herzegovina, centered in Mostar, still under the Ottoman rule. Such diocesan affiliation was no longer maintainable, and for the newly annexed regions a new bishopric was created, the Eparchy of Zahumlje and Raška, with seat in Nikšić. Since that time, there were two eparchies in Montenegro: the old Metropolitanate, still centered in Cetinje, and the newly created Eparchy of Zahumlje and Raška, centered in Nikšić. No ecclesiastical province with joint church bodies was created until 1904, under the metropolitan Mitrofan Ban (1884-1920), when a Holy Synod was established,Глас Црногорца, vol. 33 (1904), no. 1, p. 1. formally consisting of two bishops, but because of the long vacancy in Nikšić, it did not start to function until 1908. During the long reign of Prince and (from 1910) King Nikola I Petrović (1860-1918), who was a Serbian patriot, rising political aspirations of his government included not only the securing of the Serbian throne for his dynasty, but also the renewal of the old Serbian Patriarchate of Peć. On the occasion of the elevation of Montenegro to the rank of Kingdom, in 1910, the prime minister of Montenegro, Lazar Tomanović, staited: The Metropolitanate of Cetinje is the only Saint Sava's episcopal seat which has been preserved without interruption to this day, and as such it represents the lawful throne and a descendant of the Patriarchate of Peć.Глас Црногорца, vol. 39 (1910), no. 35, p. 2. Such aspirations were strengthened after the liberation of Peć during the successful enlargement of state territory of Montenegro in 1912, when another eparchy was created for several annexed territories that until then belonged to the Eparchy of Raška and Prizren. Its regions annexed to Montenegro were reorganized as the new Eparchy of Peć (1913). From that time, the Holy Synod started to function in full capacity, with three bishops. = Modern history of the Eparchy (1918-2006) = Metropolitan Gavrilo Dožić (1920–1938), who later became Serbian Patriarch (1938-1950) Metropolitan Joanikije Lipovac (1940–1945) Metropolitan Amfilohije Radović (1990-present) Following the end of the First World War (1914-1918), the Kingdom of Montenegro was united with the Kingdom of Serbia on 26 (13 o.s.) November 1918, by the proclamation of the newly elected Podgorica Assembly, and soon after that, on 1 December of the same year, the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was created, known since 1929 as the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. The political and national unification was carried out under the auspices of the Karađorđević dynasty, and thus a long-standing dynastic rivalry between the two royal families, the Petrović-Njegoš dynasty of Montenegro and the Karađorđević dynasty of Serbia, was finally resolved, without mutual agreement. Political unification was followed by the unification of all Eastern Orthodox jurisdictions within the borders of the new state. Initial decision to include dioceses in Montenegro into the process of ecclesiastical unification was reached on 29 (16 o.s.) December 1918 by the Holy Synod, consisted of all three hierarchs in Montenegro: Mitrofan Ban of Cetinje, Kirilo Mitrović of Nikšić, and Gavrilo Dožić of Peć. On that day, the Holy Synod met in Cetinje and unanimously accepted the following proposal: \\"The independent Serbian Orthodox Holy Church in Montenegro shall be united with the autocephalous Orthodox Church in the Kingdom of Serbia\\".Decision of the Holy Synod, No. 1169, 16 December 1918, Cetinje. Soon after that, further steps towards ecclesiastical unification were made. From 24 to 28 May 1919, a conference of all Eastern Orthodox bishops within the borders of the unified state was held in Belgrade, and it was presided by metropolitan Mitrofan Ban of Montenegro, who was also elected president of the newly created Central Synod. Under his leadership, the Central Synod prepared the final proclamation of Church unification on 12 September 1920. The creation of the unified Serbian Orthodox Church was also confirmed by King Alexander I. Old metropolitan Mitrofan Ban was succeeded in the autumn of 1920 by Gavrilo Dožić, who became new Metropolitan of Montenegro and the Littoral. In 1931, under the provisions of the newly adopted Constitution of the Serbian Orthodox Church, the Eparchy of Zahumlje and Raška with its seat in Nikšić was abolished, and its territory was added to the Metropolitanate of Montenegro and the Littoral. In the same time, the Eparchy of Kotor and Dubrovnik was also abolished, and divided, its Kotor region being added to the Metropolitanate. In 1938, Metropolitan Gavrilo Dožić of Montenegro was elected Serbian Patriarch, and Joanikije Lipovac was elected new Metropolitan of Montenegro and the Littoral, in 1940. During the Second World War, Yugoslavia was occupied by Axis powers in 1941, and the territory of Montenegro was organized as the Italian governorate of Montenegro (1941-1943), followed by the German occupation of Montenegro (1943-1944). The Metropolitanate was affected severely during the occupation, and more than hundred priests and other clergymen from the territory of Montenegro lost their lives during the war. During that time, Montenegrin fascist Sekula Drljević tried to create an independent Kingdom of Montenegro, as a satellite state of Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany, but that project failed because of the lack of support among people. His attempt was challenged by the 13 July Uprising in 1941, which had support from the both sides of political spectrum. Metropolitan Joanikije Lipovac cooperated closely with several right-wing movements, and also tried to mediate with local Italian and German officials in occupied Montenegro, thus provoking animosity of the left-wing Yugoslav Partisans. In 1944, when Yugoslav Communists took the power, he had to flee, but was arrested and executed without trial in 1945. In 2001, he was sanctified as a hieromartyr by the Serbian Orthodox church. Under the Yugoslav Communist rule (1944-1989), the Metropolitanate suffered constant repression at the hands of the new regime. Persecution was particularly severe during the first years of Communist rule (1944-1948) The new regime exerted direct pressure on the clergy in order to crush all forms of anti-communist opposition. In the same tame, many church properties were confiscated, some under the provisions of new laws, while other were taken illegally and forcefully. Several churches and even some minor monasteries were closed, and their buildings turned into police stations and warehouses. In the same time, new Montenegrin nation was proclaimed, as distinctive and separate from Serbian nation. In 1954, Metropolitan Arsenije Bradvarević (1947-1960) was arrested, trialed and sentenced as an enemy of the communist regime. He was imprisoned from 1954 to 1958, and then kept in house arrest until 1960. He was succeeded by Metropolitan Danilo Dajković (1961-1990), whose activities were also monitored closely by state authorities. In 1970-1972, communist regime destroyed the Lovćen Church, dedicated to Saint Petar of Cetinje, and desecrated the tomb of metropolitan Petar II Petrović-Njegoš, who was buried there, replacing the church with a secular mausoleum. In 1990, Amfilohije Radović was elected new Metropolitan of Montenegro and the Littoral. By that time, the communist regime in Yugoslavia was collapsing, and first democratic elections in Montenegro were held in 1990. In 1992, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was created, consisting of Montenegro and Serbia. Under the Constitution of Montenegro (1992), freedom of religion was restored. Political changes were followed by a period of church revival. The number of priests, monks and nuns, as well as the number of the faithful, increased and many monasteries and parish churches were rebuilt and reopened. For example, from only 10 active monasteries with about 20 monks and nuns in 1991, Montenegro now has 30 active monasteries with more than 160 monks and nuns.Metropolitanate of Montenegro and the Littoral: Monasteries The number of parish priests also increased from 20 in 1991 to more than 60 today.Metropolitanate of Montenegro and the Littoral: Parishes In 2001, diocesan administration in the region was reorganized: some northern and western regions were detached from the Metropolitanate, and on that territory new Eparchy of Budimlja and Nikšić was created.Будимљанско-никшићка епархија кроз историју = Recent history of the Eparchy, since 2006 = Morača Monastery, from the 13th century In the spring of 2006, the independence referendum was held, and Montenegro became a sovereign state. In the same time, the Bishops' Council of the Serbian Orthodox Church decided to form a regional Bishops' Council for Montenegro, consisted of bishops representing dioceses on the territory of Montenegro. By the same decision, Metropolitan of Montenegro and the Littoral was appointed president of the regional Bishops' Council.Communique of the Diocesan Council of the Orthodox Church in Montenegro (2010) In the autumn of 2007, due to illness and advanced age of Serbian Patriarch Pavle Stojčević, Metropolitan Amflohije Radović of Montenegro was appointed administrator of the Patriarchal Throne, by the Holy Synod of the Serbian Orthodox Church. Old Patriarch Pavle died in 2009, and Metropolitan Amfilohije continued to administer the Patriarchal Throne until the election of new Serbian Patriarch Irinej Gavrilović in 2010. Since Montenegro became an sovereign country in 2006, after a narrow independence referendum, relations between state authorities and the Metropolitanate became increasingly complex. As a strong supporter of Serbian-Montenegrin unionism, Metropolitan Amfilohije was seen as an opponent to newly proclaimed Montenegrin independence, and thus a new political dimension to several ecclesiastical disputes was added. One of those disputes was related to claims and activities of a separate Montenegrin Orthodox Church, that was created in 1993 by a group of Montenegrin nationalists, but never recognized as canonical. During the following years, various disputes arose, mainly over the question of historical and canonical legitimacy and effective control over some church objects and properties.Statement of The Metropolitanate of Montenegro and the Coastlands (2009) Recent announcements of state authorities, related to potential confiscation of church properties, have provoked a strong public manifestation of support for the Metropolitanate.Mass service held in Montenegro in defense of Serbian Church (2019) Media publications \\"Svetigora\\" (Serbian: Светигора) is a periodical journal of the Serbian Orthodox Metropolitanate of Montenegro and the Littoral, published and edited by \\"Publishing and Information Institution of the Metropolitanate of Montenegro and the Littoral\\".

It the largest island on Lake of Bays. There are multiple Indigenous burial grounds on the Island and immediately off shore given graves that were once on the island were flooded when lake levels were changed with damming for the purpose of bringing improvements to the logging and navigation industries. The original owners consented to preserve and protect all the ancient burial sites on the island from desecration and to allow Chief John Bigwin, who was still alive at the time, to be buried there with his ancestors when he died. Bigwin Inn The first development on Bigwin Island was known as the Bigwin Inn, which opened in 1920. It was an exclusive summer destination for tourists from Toronto and the US eastern seaboard, and was developed by Charles Orlando Shaw, a Huntsville businessman. He founded the Bigwin Inn Company Ltd. in 1915 and hired architect John Wilson of Collingwood to design the resort. With 350 guest rooms, it was one of the biggest and most beautiful resorts in Muskoka at the time. Wilson employed classical, Mediterranean, dodecagon, craftsman, Tudor and Victorian design elements, placed the buildings using the natural shoreline and landscape, used natural sunlight as much as possible, and connected the buildings with covered, lit walkways. Most construction took place during the winter, as the ice made it easier to transport supplies to the island, usually by horses and sleigh. Key buildings were the Indian Head Dining Room, which could seat up to 750 guests at one time, the Dance Pavilion and the Rotunda. The first nine-hole golf course on Bigwin, designed by Stanley Thompson, opened in 1922. It became an 18-hole course by 1930. At its height during the 1930s, many renowned musicians played at the Dance Pavilion. By then, the smaller Marine Dining Room and the less elaborate Tea House were built, along with the ferry house to store the many boats that serviced Bigwin. From 1941 to 1945 the Dutch Royal Family summered on the island when they were exiled in Ottawa. Beatrix of the Netherlands and her family lived in private cottages. The Rotunda was used to store the constitution of the Netherlands. C. O. Shaw died of a heart attack in 1942, and although the Inn appeared highly successful while he managed it, the following years were clearly not as profitable. Ownership passed through several hands until Frank Leslie purchased the property in 1949. Leslie operated on a non-profit basis and was successful in attracting entertainers to Bigwin, it was popular as a result, but due to illness he had to sell the hotel in the 1960s. Bigwin Inn closed in 1966. Attempts to reopen the island resort were made but for many years most of the Inn's buildings remained unused. The west lodge, dance pavilion, ferry house, kitchens, golf clubhouse, staff bungalows, stables, rotunda and Mohawk Belle hull have been demolished. The 3000 foot unmanned/unmonitored concrete airstrip was built to allow wealthy cottagers from Toronto and the US to fly to the island. The abandoned airstrip has been landscaped, but the north end is now used to store boats. Though the rotunda fireplaces survive (except for one that would obstruct a golf course view), plans for a boutique hotel onsite and extensive back lot condominium development are said to have been shelved. Perimeter island lots continue to be for sale with the Bigwin Inn dining room and tea house restored to service. The future of the Bigwin observation tower remains uncertain while the building looks neglected and decayed. The ferry \\"Bigwin\\" was stored in the ferry house for many years. Supported by cross beams to dock cribbing, it survived for many years with bow, stern and bridge remaining above water. While the superstructure remained intact, many fittings were removed as the vessel sat idle as a residual asset of the Bigwin Inn Company Limited, The Bigwin Boat Livery Company Limited and said to be the subject of liens and outstanding mortgages. In the 1990s, the ferry was going to be removed from its berth, taken to the mid-channel of Lake of Bays and scuttled as a wreck site. However, this never happened. Instead, the owners of the ferry house sold the boat stored there. After being towed and transported to a new storage site, the ferry was eventually restored by those that paid for it and their supporters. The new golf course was designed by noted course architect Doug Carrick. It is known for wide fairways and sweeping landscape views. The developer of the revamped golf course transferred ownership and responsibilities to its members in 2011. Ownership of the East lodge, main dock, pavilion and boat house is with another company Muskoka Condo Corp 1 (MCC1). Old hotel rooms in the lodge were converted to condos in the 1960s and come up for sale. Bigwin Island Golf Course The Bigwin Island Golf Club is a par 72 championship layout measuring 7,166 yards from the championship tees. The course has a variety of tee locations measuring 6,742 yards from the blue tees, 6,287 yards from the white tees and 5,346 yards from the red tees. Each nine is a par 36 consisting of two par threes, two par fives and five par fours. 18th Hole Bigwin Island Golf Club Photo References * Bigwin Historical Society External links * Bigwin Island * Muskoka Condominium Corp. #1 (MCC#1) Category:Lake islands of Ontario ","title":"Bigwin Island"},{"id":"3412065","text":"Communist Workers Bloc of Andalusia (in Spanish: Bloque Obrero Comunista de Andalucía) is a political formation in the municipality of Jódar, Jaén province, Spain.

High school/college years Jennings attended Poteet High School in Mesquite, Texas, and was a standout in both football and baseball. In football, he won All-District honors at both kicker and punter. In baseball, as a senior, he was named the District MVP and posted a .410 batting average, hit seven home runs, and pitched his way to a 10–3 record and a 0.92 ERA with 132 strikeouts. After graduating from Poteet, he attended Baylor University, where he played baseball from to . Following his junior season at Baylor, Jennings was named by both Baseball America and Collegiate Baseball as the 1999 National Player of the Year. In what would be his final season at Baylor, he struck out 172 hitters in 146.2 innings and hit .382 with 17 homers and 68 RBIs. He also won the Golden Spikes Award, his second consecutive Big 12 Player of the Year, consensus All-America honors, the Outstanding Player on the 1999 Big 12 All Tournament Team, and a spot on the 1999 All-Big 12 Academic First Team.

It is situated in the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina. The town has a Serb ethnic majority and a population numbering 2,982 people (2002 census). Name The town is named after Jaša Tomić (1856–1922), a Serb journalist and politician from Vojvodina. In Serbian Cyrillic, the town is known as Јаша Томић, in Serbian Latin and Croatian as Jaša Tomić, in German as Modosch, in Hungarian as Módos, in Romanian as Modoș, and in Banat Bulgarian as Modoš. The former name for the town used in Serbian was Modoš (Модош). It is assumed that the old village name, Modoš, derived from the Latin phrase modus transciendi, which in English means way of crossing the river. History The oldest known settlements in this area date from the 3rd and 2nd millennia BC. Findings from the Neolithic, Bronze and Iron Ages have been found, including a burial from the Bosut- Basarabi culture of the 9th century BC. The area contains archaeological traces of Celts, Thracians, Romans, Avars and Slavs. Topographic names of Slavic origin found in the area, such as the Grešara, Mlaka, Margitica, Kamenica, Livade, Selište, Rasove, Vagan, Bavanište, etc., testify that the area was inhabited by Slavs from the 5th century onwards. Historically, the first written mention was in 1334 as Madus. At that time the village was administered by the Kingdom of Hungary and peopled with Catholic Hungarians. In 1338 the settlement was mentioned as Modos and in 1344 as Modoš. Settlement was part of the Kovin county. Two other medieval settlements existed nearby: Új Rév (Uj Rev, Oređ) and Oroszi (Orosi). Oroszi was populated by Russians who had been captured by the Hungarians at the battle of Kiev. In 1552, Modoš became part of the Ottoman Empire, administratively included in the Province of Temeşvar. With the Ottoman conquest, most of the local Hungarian population left for the north and the Ottoman authorities brought in Serbs in their place. Thus Modoš under the Ottoman administration was populated by ethnic Serbs and divided into two settlements - Veliki Modoš and Mali Modoš. In 1660-6, Katastig of the Patriarchal Monastery of Peć recorded the names of Serb inhabitants of Modoš - priest Jaftimije and priest Zaharije, Ilija, Granny Romana, Milić Radojević, Vladislav, Rusmir, Vuja, Komlenija, Avram, Gavril Panov, Mata, Radomir, Cveja Vranešev, Andreja, and Petar. In 1717, Modoš became part of the Habsburg Monarchy, and contained 50 houses, inhabited by Serbs. Until 1778, it belonged administratively to the Banat of Temeschwar and to the district of Betschkerek (Serbian: Bečkerek). A new Orthodox church was built in Modoš in 1746, to replace an earlier mentioned during the Serbian Patriarch Kalinik I (1691–1710). In the second half of the 18th century, some Serbs from Pomorišje and Sečanj settled in Modoš, as did some Hungarians, Germans, Slovaks and Bulgarians. The first German settlers arrived in 1766, followed by others in 1784 and 1792. In 1779, after abolition of the Banat of Temeswar, Modoš was included in Torontal County, which was part of the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary. Some local Serbs who were dissatisfied with this administrative change left Modoš and settled in the Banatian Military Frontier. In the end of the 18th century, Modoš was politically divided into two settlements - Serbian Modoš and German Modoš. In 1795 a Catholic church was built. In 1836, the population of Modoš numbered 3560, of whom 2440 were Orthodox Christians, 1116 Roman Catholics, and 4 Evangelicals (Lutherans). In 1842, Serbian prince Mihajlo Obrenović stayed in Modoš, during his trip from Principality of Serbia to Vienna. In 1848, Torontal County was administratively divided into three districts, one of which had its administrative seat in Modoš. In 1848-9, Modoš was part of the autonomous Serbian Vojvodina and in 1849-60 of the Voivodeship of Serbia and Temes Banat, a separate Habsburg crown land. After abolition of the Voivodeship in 1860, Modoš was again included in Torontal County. Austria KK stamp of 1858 cancelled at Modos / Modoš During the 1860s, the ethnic structure changed as some Serbs left and some Germans from Bačka settled there instead. In 1876, a Serb reading house was founded in the settlement. In 1895, Serbian Modoš and German Modoš were joined into a single political unit. By 1910, the population of the town was ethnically mixed, the largest group being the Germans, alongside sizeable Hungarian and Serb communities. In November 1918, the army of the Kingdom of Serbia entered Modoš, which became part of the Banat, Bačka and Baranja region, first of the Kingdom of Serbia and then of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (renamed to Yugoslavia in 1929). In 1918-19, it was part of the Veliki Bečkerek County within the Kingdom. However, in July 1919, the town was assigned to Romania. In 1924, the town, together with a few other settlements, was returned to the SCS Kingdom in exchange for the town of Jimbolia and a few other settlements, which were transferred to Romania. In the same year (1924), the name of the town was changed to Jaša Tomić. From 1924 to 1929 it was part of Podunavlje Oblast with its administrative seat in Smederevo, and from 1929 to 1941 part of Danube Banovina, with its administrative seat in Novi Sad. From 1941 to 1944, it was under Axis occupation and was included in the German-administered region of Banat, which formally was part of Serbia. In 1944, Jaša Tomić became part of the autonomous province of Vojvodina within the new socialist Yugoslavia. In 1945, Vojvodina became part of the People's Republic of Serbia within Yugoslavia. The German population had mostly fled from Jaša Tomić by the end of the war (in 1944), while some mainly Serb colonists from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Central Serbia and Croatia settled in the town from 1945. Post-war population censuses recorded a Serb ethnic majority in the town. Until the 1950s, Jaša Tomić was the seat of the municipality, but in 1955 this municipality was abolished and the town became part of the municipality of Zrenjanin. Later a separate municipality of Sečanj was formed and town of Jaša Tomić was included into this municipality. However, even today Jaša Tomić is the largest settlement in the Sečanj municipality and the only settlement in the municipality with town status, Sečanj, its seat, being only a village. In 2005, the town was devastated by floods.

It is a pale yellow, monoclinic crystalline powder that is odorless and non-flammable. When activated with a suitable dopant (e.g. europium, written as Eu:SrAl2O4), it acts as a photoluminescent phosphor with long persistence of phosphorescence. Strontium aluminates exist in other compositions including SrAl4O7 (monoclinic), Sr3Al2O6 (cubic), SrAl12O19 (hexagonal), and Sr4Al14O25 (orthorhombic). Phosphor For many phosphorescent-based purposes, strontium aluminate is a vastly superior phosphor to its predecessor, copper-activated zinc sulfide, being about 10 times brighter and 10 times longer glowing. It is frequently used in glow in the dark toys, where it displaces the cheaper but less efficient Cu:ZnS. However, the material has high hardness, causing abrasion to the machinery used in processing it; manufacturers frequently coat the particles with a suitable lubricant when adding them to a plastic. Different aluminates can be used as the host matrix. This influences the wavelength of emission of the europium ion, by its covalent interaction with surrounding oxygens, and crystal field splitting of the 5d orbital energy levels. Strontium aluminate phosphors produce green and aqua hues, where green gives the highest brightness and aqua the longest glow time. The excitation wavelengths for strontium aluminate range from 200 to 450 nm. The wavelength for its green formulation is 520 nm, its aqua, or blue-green, version emits at 505 nm, and its blue emits at 490 nm. Strontium aluminate can be formulated to phosphoresce at longer (yellow to red) wavelengths as well, though such emission is often dimmer than that of more common phosphorescence at shorter wavelengths. For europium-dysprosium doped aluminates, the peak emission wavelengths are 520 nm for SrAl2O4, 480 nm for SrAl4O7, and 400 nm for SrAl12O19. Eu2+,Dy3+:SrAl2O4 is important as a persistently luminescent phosphor for industrial applications. It can be produced by molten salt assisted process at 900 °C. The most described type is the stoichiometric green-emitting (approx. 530 nm) Eu2+:SrAl2O4. Eu2+,Dy3+,B:SrAl2O4 shows significantly longer afterglow than the europium-only doped material. The Eu2+ dopant shows high afterglow, while Eu3+ has almost none. Polycrystalline Mn:SrAl12O19 is used as a green phosphor for plasma displays, and when doped with praseodymium or neodymium it can act as a good active laser medium. Sr0.95Ce0.05Mg0.05Al11.95O19 is a phosphor emitting at 305 nm, with quantum efficiency of 70%. Several strontium aluminates can be prepared by the sol-gel process. The wavelengths produced depend on the internal crystal structure of the material. Slight modifications in the manufacturing process (the type of reducing atmosphere, small variations of stoichiometry of the reagents, addition of carbon or rare-earth halides) can significantly influence the emission wavelengths. Strontium aluminate phosphor is usually fired at about 1250 °C, though higher temperatures are possible. Subsequent exposure to temperatures above 1090 °C is likely to cause loss of its phosphorescent properties. At higher firing temperatures, the Sr3Al2O6 undergoes transformation to SrAl2O4. The glow intensity depends on the particle size; generally, the bigger the particles, the better the glow. Strontium aluminate based afterglow pigments are marketed under numerous brand names such as Super-LumiNova and Lumibrite, developed by Seiko. Europium-doped strontium aluminate nanoparticles are proposed as indicators of stress and cracks in materials, as they emit light when subjected to mechanical stress (mechanoluminescence). They are also useful for fabricating mechano-optical nanodevices. Non-agglomerated particles are needed for this purpose; they are difficult to prepare conventionally but can be made by ultrasonic spray pyrolysis of a mixture of strontium acetylacetonate, aluminium acetylacetonate and europium acetylacetonate in reducing atmosphere (argon with 5% of hydrogen). Cerium and manganese doped strontium aluminate (Ce,Mn:SrAl12O19) shows intense narrowband (22 nm wide) phosphorescence at 515 nm when excited by ultraviolet radiation (253.7 nm mercury emission line, to lesser degree 365 nm). It can be used as a phosphor in fluorescent lamps in photocopiers and other devices. A small amount of silicon substituting the aluminium can increase emission intensity by about 5%; the preferred composition of the phosphor is Ce0.15Mn0.15:SrAl11Si0.75O19.http://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/pdfs/US3836477.pdf Structural material Strontium aluminate cement can be used as refractory structural material. It can be prepared by sintering of a blend of strontium oxide or strontium carbonate with alumina in a roughly equimolar ratio at about 1500 °C. It can be used as a cement for refractory concrete for temperatures up to 2000 °C as well as for radiation shielding. The use of strontium aluminate cements is limited by the availability of the raw materials. Strontium aluminates have been examined as proposed materials for immobilization of fission products of radioactive waste, namely strontium-90.https://inldigitallibrary.inl.gov/sti/4655305.pdf References * External links *How does glow-in-the-dark stuff work? *Facts, pictures, stories about the element Strontium *Performance Demonstrations of Zinc Sulfide and Strontium Aluminate Photoluminescent Floor Proximity Escape Path Marking Systems Category:Aluminates Category:Strontium compounds Category:Luminescence Category:Phosphors and scintillators ","title":"Strontium aluminate"},{"id":"3412142","text":"State Route 137 (SR 137) is a state highway in the U.S. state of California, running in the San Joaquin Valley from State Route 43 near Corcoran to State Route 65 in Cairns Corner.

Biosynthesis of α-terpinene Biosynthesis of α-terpinene. \\"P\\" indicates a phosphate group, -PO32− The biosynthesis of α-terpinene and other terpenoids occurs via the mevalonate pathway because its starting reactant, dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP), is derived from mevalonic acid. Geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP) is produced from the reaction of a resonance-stable allylic cation, formed from the loss of the pyrophosphate group from DMAPP, and isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP), and the subsequent loss of a proton. GPP then loses the pyrophosphate group to form the resonance-stable geranyl cation. The reintroduction of the pyrophosphate group to the cation produces GPP isomer, known as linalyl pyrophosphate (LPP). LPP then forms a resonance-stable cation by losing its pyrophosphate group. Cyclization is then completed thanks to this more favorable stereochemistry of the LPP cation, now yielding a terpinyl cation. Finally, a 1,2-hydride shift via a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement produces the terpinen-4-yl cation. It is the loss of a hydrogen from this cation that generates α-terpinene.

He came to prominence in the early 1980s as co-founder and lead singer of the new wave and synthpop band Heaven 17, which released six singles that entered the Top 40 charts in the United Kingdom during the 1980s, and 1990s, including \\"Temptation\\", \\"Let Me Go\\", \\"Come Live with Me\\", \\"Crushed by the Wheels of Industry\\", \\"Sunset Now\\", \\"This Is Mine\\", and \\"(We Don't Need This) Fascist Groove Thang\\" Early years Glenn Peter Gregory was born on 16 May 1958 in Sheffield, England. His father, Howard, was a steel worker. As a teenager, he wanted to be an actor, but ended up working in London as a photographer instead. Music career In 1977, Gregory was part of a band called 57 Men which was formed by Jack Hues and Nick Feldman, both of whom would later form the band Wang Chung. Gregory knew the founding members of the Human League for many years. He had been singing and playing bass guitar in bands with Ian Craig Marsh since 1973. In early 1981, he was contacted by Martyn Ware after the original incarnation of the Human League broke up, and was asked to join Heaven 17, a new band resulting from the break-up. The band Heaven 17 included the trio of Martyn Ware, Ian Craig Marsh, and Gregory as lead singer. The band released eight studio albums, and had many hits in the UK. However, by the late 1980s their popularity had declined. The band broke up in 1988, but reunited in 1996, and played their first ever live concert in 1997. Marsh left the band in 2007, but Ware and Gregory continued to perform as Heaven 17. In 1984, Gregory contributed to the Band Aid single, \\"Do They Know It's Christmas?\\", singing the line \\"No rain nor rivers flow\\". Outside of Heaven 17, Gregory has been a member of the bands Ugly and Honeyroot, as well as working with ABC, Tina Turner, Grace Jones, Propaganda, Terence Trent D'Arby, Ultravox, La Roux and John Lydon. He has also established a career in soundtrack music, writing for radio, TV and film. He creates scores in a private studio built at the bottom of his garden. Personal life In 1983, Gregory married singer Sarah Osborne of the Belgian pop group Allez Allez, but the two divorced after about three years. Gregory then married his second wife Lindsay who works for a design company.

The original Toros were a Triple-A minor league baseball team in the Pacific Coast League from 1969 to 1997, where they won the PCL Championship in 1991 and 1993. They were affiliated with several Major League Baseball teams over the years, most notably with the Houston Astros. The most- recent Toros were created as a new team in the independent Golden Baseball League on September 1, 2008. They were originally the Mesa Miners (2005) and Reno Silver Sox (2006–2008) before being purchased by Tucson Baseball LLC and relocating to Tucson.GBL Cities , Golden Baseball League website The new Toros played their home games at Hi Corbett Field in Tucson, home of the original Toros team, starting May 21, 2009, at the start of the league's fifth anniversary, and ran until 2011. They played in the South Division in the GBL along with the Long Beach Armada, Orange County Flyers, St. George RoadRunners and Yuma Scorpions. (The expansion Tijuana Potros were supposed to play in the same division, but their season was postponed until 2010 due to the swine flu outbreak in Mexico.) History =Early days= Tucson had a number of baseball teams between 1915 and 1958, including the Tucson Old Pueblos, the Tucson Waddies, the Tucson Cowboys (several teams), the Tucson Missions and the Tucson Lizards. None of these were part of the Pacific Coast League. When the last iteration of the Cowboys folded in 1958, Tucson was left with no professional baseball until the advent of the Toros.Sidewinders 2002 Commemorative Program. Tucson: Tucson Sidewinders Baseball Club, 2002. =Pacific Coast League era begins= Hiram \\"Hi\\" Corbett, a former Arizona state senator, helped to bring the Pacific Coast League to Tucson, in recognition of which the 1937 ballpark in midtown Tucson's Reid Park was eventually renamed Hi Corbett Field. The Tucson Toros, a AAA team in the league's southern division, began play in 1969. The name Toros was suggested by name-the-team contest winner Clarence Dupnik, who went on to become the Sheriff of Pima County, Arizona.Tucson Toros 1997 Media Guide. Tucson: Tucson Toros Baseball Club, 1997. From 1969 through 1972, the Tucson Toros were the AAA affiliate of the Chicago White Sox. During this period, the team managed no better than a fourth-place finish for the season. The Toros did better as the AAA team of the Oakland Athletics (1973–1976), winning the PCL Eastern Division title in 1973 and finishing in second place in 1975. As the Texas Rangers farm team (1977–1979) they finished in third and fourth place, but with outstanding individual performances by outfielder Billy Sample (AAA Minor League Player of the Year, 1978) and others. =The Astros era= In 1980 the Toros began a long association with the Houston Astros. Following the lead of the parent club (which was widely criticized for its 1980s uniforms), the Toros introduced what some consider the ugliest uniform in the history of organized baseball: orange pants with yellow and red stripes, and a jersey with a turquoise back, yellow raglan sleeves, and a front resplendent in yellow, avocado, red, orange, and lime green stripes of various widths. The look in 1981, an all-orange uniform with red and yellow trim, was similarly ill-received. In their first year of affiliation with the Astros, the Toros won the first half Southern Division title, but were quickly eliminated by the Albuquerque Dukes in the second half playoffs. The team spent most of the rest of the decade in third place for the season. In 1989, under new team owner Rick Holtzman, Mike Feder became the Toros' general manager, a post he would hold through the end of the Toros era of Tucson AAA baseball. His family- friendly promotions brought immediate results. The club was named Promotional Club of the Year in 1990, and had its highest season attendance to date. The following season, 1991, was the Toros' first championship season. The team overcame a series deficit of 0–2 to sweep the Calgary Cannons in the remaining games of the best of five series. Third year Toros manager Bob Skinner was named PCL Manager of the Year, while series MVP Kenny Lofton led all of professional baseball with 17 triples for the season. After a second-place finish in 1992, the Toros had their second and final championship season in 1993 under new manager Rick Sweet, winning both halves of the season. First baseman Jim Lindeman led the league with a .362 batting average. Second baseman James Mouton, in his first season above the single-A level, was the PCL MVP with 92 RBI and 40 stolen bases. The Toros had the PCL's second-best overall record in 1994, and Rick Sweet was named PCL Manager of the Year. In 1995 the team had the best record in the PCL (87–56), but was defeated by the champion Colorado Springs Sky Sox in the first round of the playoffs. The 1996 campaign proved to be the Toros' last as a Houston affiliate. The team went 70–74, while \\"losing\\" a number of outstanding players, such as pitchers Donne Wall and Billy Wagner, to major league call-ups. In addition to Lofton, Wall and Wagner the Astros-era also yielded several future MLB players including Ray Montgomery, Mike Simms, Bobby Abreu, Dave Hajek, Melvin Mora, Phil Nevin, Craig Biggio, Brian Hunter and Mike Hampton. =The Toros become the Sidewinders= 1997 was the last year of the Tucson Toros, in more ways than one. In a complicated \\"swap\\", the team was sold to the owner of the Phoenix Firebirds, so that the Phoenix AAA team technically moved to Tucson while retaining the Tucson club's staff and facilities.\\"Tucson Toros make their return home to Hi Corbett next year\\" (Inside Tucson Business, AZBiz.com, September 1, 2008) The Toros' former owners moved to Fresno, California as the Grizzlies, and inherited the Firebirds' former affiliation with the San Francisco Giants. The Toros' long affiliation with the Houston Astros was suddenly over, as the \\"new\\" Toros signed a one-year agreement with the Milwaukee Brewers. The one major league prospect with the Toros who was not part of the Brewers' organization was Travis Lee of the Arizona Diamondbacks. The new franchise did not yet have a AAA team of its own, so Lee was assigned to the nearby Tucson team for part of the season. Although Lee personally had a good year, the transitional Toros only managed a 64–78 record. It was the Tucson team's last season at Hi Corbett Field, and their last season with the Toros name. After the 1997 season, the Tucson club became the top affiliate of the Diamondbacks and changed their name to the Sidewinders. Because the Colorado Rockies used Hi Corbett Field for spring training, Tucson Electric Park was built to accommodate the Diamondbacks and the Chicago White Sox in the spring \\"Cactus League,\\" as well as the Sidewinders. This ended 60 years of minor-league baseball at Hi Corbett Field. The change was not well received by fans, who responded to the new stadium, affiliation and team name with significantly reduced attendance. =Sidewinders era= With the coming of the Diamondbacks, a new ballpark was needed for spring training in Tucson, since the Colorado Rockies used Hi Corbett Field. Tucson Electric Park was built, and became the spring training site for both the Diamondbacks and the Chicago White Sox. It also became home to the Tucson Sidewinders in 1998. Many changes took place between 1997 and 1999 – a new name, new affiliation, newly expanded league, new owner, new general manager and new venue – resulting in disgruntled fans and lower than expected attendance. Financial arrangements between team owners and Pima County were also the subject of criticism. After purchasing the team in 2000, owner Jay Zucker attempted to improve the situation with a variety of promotions, including weekly fireworks. These efforts met with limited success. The team was very successful as a supplier of major league-quality players to the Arizona Diamondbacks. Many individual Sidewinders performed admirably in mid-season call-ups, sometimes returning to the major league club time and again as needed. This earned the Sidewinders the nickname \\"Baby 'Backs.\\" In 2006, the Tucson Sidewinders won the Pacific Coast League championship, and afterwards defeated the Toledo Mud Hens 5–2 in the Bricktown Showdown for the Triple-A baseball championship at AT&T; Bricktown Ballpark in Oklahoma City. =Sidewinders timeline= Tucson Toros jerseys from the early 1990s 1997 – Martin Stone, a businessman, land speculator and former owner of the Phoenix Firebirds, purchases the Tucson Toros from Rick Holtzman. The Tucson Toros have a one-year player development contract with the Milwaukee Brewers, filling the gap between the end of the Toros' contract with Houston and the beginning of the team's affiliation with the expansion Diamondbacks. Diamondbacks prospect Travis Lee plays in Tucson for part of the season. Toros owner Stone persuades the Pima County Board of Supervisors to approve a lease on Tucson Electric Park (then under construction) that protects the team owner from a portion of the team's financial losses at taxpayer expense. 1998 – The renamed Tucson Sidewinders begin their affiliation with the Arizona Diamondbacks, playing at Tucson Electric Park. A new mascot is also introduced, Sandy Sidewinder, a snake with arms. The old mascot, Tuffy the Toro, is phased out. 1999 – In May, longtime Toros general manager Mike Feder is fired from the Sidewinders by team owner Stone. A local uproar ensues in support of Feder. He is replaced by Jack Donovan. After the season, broadcasting entrepreneur Jay Zucker purchases the Sidewinders from Martin Stone, reportedly for about $7 to $8 million, after Stone is diagnosed with prostate cancer. The new ownership group, led by Jay and Melinda Zucker, is Tucson Baseball, LLC. 2000 – Zucker loses over $200,000 in his first season as owner. Feder returns as GM. 2001 – Feder leaves prior to the season to take a role as Regional Marketing Director for the NFL's New Orleans Saints. Todd Woodford returns to Tucson as general manager after spending a year with the PCL's Salt Lake franchise. 2002 – Rick Parr becomes the team's general manager. Despite the parent club's World Series win the previous year, the Sidewinders report 268,807 total attendance for the season, an average of 3,895 per game. Tucson Electric Park has a capacity of 11,000. 2003 – Tucson Sidewinders prospects earn the nickname \\"Baby 'Backs\\" with their relative youth and frequent call-ups to the major league club. 2006 – The team finishes the regular season 91–53, the best in AAA baseball for 2006 and a new franchise record. Team manager Chip Hale is named PCL Manager of the Year. After defeating the Salt Lake Bees 3–1 in a best-of-five PCL Pacific Conference Championships series, the Sidewinders win the Pacific Coast League Championship Series in three straight games versus the Round Rock Express. They then defeat the International League champion, the Toledo Mud Hens, 5–2 in a one-game playoff in Oklahoma City for the unofficial AAA title. Despite this feat, the Sidewinders still suffer from dwindling fan attendance and a general lack of interest from the Tucson market. After the 2006 season, the Sidewinders renew their player development contract with the Diamondbacks for another two years. Manager Chip Hale is promoted to the Diamondbacks coaching staff as their new third base coach. 2007 – Bill Plummer, the former manager of the Diamondbacks' former Double-A affiliate, the Tennessee Smokies, takes over as skipper for the Sidewinders in 2007. Randy Johnson pitches the home opener as part of a brief rehab stint with the Sidewinders, and picks up a win for the team in his second outing on April 20. Hampered by low attendance and concerns over the location and playing field maintenance at Tucson Electric Park, Tucson Baseball LLC sells the Tucson Sidewinders to SK Baseball LLC for $15 M in June 2007. Tucson finishes the 2007 season with a 75–67 record, the second most wins in Sidewinders history. Tucson Baseball LLC completes sale of the team to SK Baseball LLC on September 12, 2007. Also in September, outgoing Sidewinders owner Zucker announces the formation of a new Tucson baseball team with an old name: the Tucson Toros, to begin play in 2009 as part of the Golden Baseball League. 2008 – The Sidewinders had a win-loss record of 60–82 for their final season in Tucson, finishing in fourth (last) place in Pacific South division of the PCL. SK Baseball relocated the team to Reno, Nevada for the 2009 season, where they became the Reno Aces. The reconstituted Tucson Toros returned to Hi Corbett Field to begin play in 2009. =The Independent baseball era (2009–2011)= In June 2007, owner Jay Zucker of Tucson Baseball LLC announced the sale of the Tucson Sidewinders, the Toro's successor, to SK Baseball LLC for $15 M. The team was moved to Reno, Nevada after the 2008 season. At the time, the Reno Silver Sox of the Golden Baseball League (which began as the Mesa Miners in 2005) were reported to be forced to leave Reno when the Sidewinders move into town.Brodesky, Josh. \\"Toros could return in new incarnation\\" The Arizona Daily Star. 11 November 2007. 26 December 2007. The Silver Sox franchise was sold by the league to Tucson Baseball LLC, but the team's history (including Reno's 2006 GBL Championship) did not go with them. There were original reports of a possible relocation to Carson City, Nevada, but the team instead moved to Tucson.Tucson Toros make their return home to Hi Corbett next year (AZBiz.com, September 1, 2008)Silver Sox could be headed down the highway (Reno Gazette-Journal, September 16, 2008) The Silver Sox team name is now associated with the Arizona Winter League team from Saskatchewan. The new PCL team has since become the Reno Aces. On September 1, 2008, Jay Zucker of Tucson Baseball LLC and GBL chief executive officer David Kaval announced at a press conference at Hi Corbett Field in Tucson that the Tucson Toros were coming back and are now officially a part of the Golden League.Golden Baseball League Expands to Tucson (Golden Baseball League website, September 1, 2008)Zucker takes bull by horns with new team at Hi Corbett Field (The Arizona Daily Star, September 1, 2008)Tucson to get independent league baseball team (Tucson Citizen, September 1, 2008)Gimino: Goodbye AAA; hello Golden (Tucson Citizen, September 1, 2008) Zucker owns the rights to the name, logos, colors, uniforms and history of the Toros. Ironically, it was Zucker who had sold the Tucson Sidewinders team just one year prior to purchasing the new Tucson Toros team. He and his wife Melinda wore classic throwback jerseys when the announcement was made. However, the team will be donning new uniforms to coincide with the new updated team logo and colors of black, red and gold unveiled at the press conference. The players may sport throwback jerseys at times to pay homage to the original team. Though they entered the league as an expansion team, they have adopted the original franchise's history and records up until 1997, essentially being \\"resurrected\\". In addition to celebrating their return to professional baseball, the Toros celebrated their 40th anniversary of their formation during the 2009 season. On, September 7, 2009, the Toros captured their very first GBL South Division Championship by defeating the St. George RoadRunners 3 games to 2 and advanced to the GBL Championship Series in their inaugural GBL season. They faced the North Division champion Calgary Vipers, and lost to the Vipers 3 games to 1 in a best of 5 championship series. On October 27, 2010, it was announced at the GBL website that the Toros would take 2011 off due to the Triple-A Tucson Padres playing their season at Kino Stadium (formerly Tucson Electric Park).Toros on hiatus, GBL website, October 27, 2010 On July 21, 2011, the Toros announced on their website that members of the Yuma Scorpions would play as the Toros in a doubleheader and that it would be the team's final night in action.TUCSON TOROS LAST STAND, Tucson Toros website, July 21, 2011 The reason for their farewell was that the franchise received an eviction notice from the city of Tucson that their lease of Hi Corbett Field was terminated.Tucson Toros evicted , FOX11AZ.com On November 29, 2011, the Toros announced that they were folding after agreeing to a settlement of $300,000 paid to the team by the city paving the way for the University of Arizona baseball team to playing their home games at Hi Corbett.Toros' settlement means UA will move to Hi Corbett, KOLD-TV website, November 29, 2011 Major League Baseball players Some notable players to don a Toros or Sidewinders uniform: a Tucson Toros pitcher smiles for the camera circa 1994 * Bobby Abreu * Brian Anderson * Ronnie Belliard * Craig Biggio * Ken Caminiti * Alex Cintrón * Craig Counsell * David Dellucci * Stephen Drew * Erubiel Durazo * Mike Fetters * Phil Garner * Édgar González * Luis Gonzalez * Jason Grimsley * Conor Jackson * Geoff Jenkins * Randy Johnson * Todd Jones * Jeff Juden * Darryl Kile * Byung-hyun Kim * Travis Lee * Kenny Lofton * Leo Mazzone * Mark McLemore * Joe Mikulik * Damian Miller * Melvin Mora * Phil Nevin * Carlos Quentin * Shane Reynolds * Reggie Sanders * Curt Schilling * Junior Spivey * Chad Tracy * Dave Veres * Óscar Villarreal * Fernando Viña * Billy Wagner * Donne Wall * Tom Wiedenbauer * Matt Williams * Tony Womack At least a few of these were \\"Tucson\\" players only by virtue of being sent down to AAA for rehab after an injury.

It was built in 1937, remodeled in 1972 and renovated in 1992, 1997 and 1999. It is part of a larger city park complex, Reid Park (which also includes the Reid Park Zoo) and Randolph Park, located between Broadway Boulevard and 22nd Street in midtown Tucson. The largest Toros crowd at Hi Corbett was 12,863 on May 17, 1981 against Salt Lake City. Hi Corbett dimensions are as follows: RF: 348 feet; CF: 392 feet; LF: 366 feet. The park has a \\"Green Monster\\" fence in Center Field. The ballpark was home to the Tucson Cowboys in the 1930s to 1950s, and the spring training home of the Cleveland Indians from 1945 through 1992. Parts of the 1989 movie Major League were filmed at Hi Corbett Field, using the University of Arizona baseball team as extras. In 1993 it became the Spring Training home of the expansion Colorado Rockies, the first major league team in the Mountain time zone. Despite the 1998 opening of Tucson Electric Park, the Colorado Rockies have continued to train at Hi Corbett. USA Baseball was headquartered at Hi Corbett from 1997–2003. From 2004–2006 Hi Corbett was home to the Arizona Heat women's pro softball team, with a season from June to August. As of 2009, the venue is shared by the Rockies and the Toros. The Rockies played their final game in Tucson against the Arizona Diamondbacks in March 2010. Both teams moved their spring training camps to the more lucrative Phoenix suburbs. Off the field Some popular Toros promotions included Turn Back the Clock Night, \\"bull bells\\" and a cow-milking contest on Arizona Dairy Night, and the annual Diamond Dig in the base paths. Huey Lewis once wrote and performed a theme song for the Tucson Toros (circa 1993). Ray Charles also appeared in concert after a Tucson Toros game in the early 1990s. Toros broadcasters Vince Cotroneo, Mario Impemba and Matt Vasgersian all went on to major league broadcast jobs. The team mascot, Tuffy the Toro, also appeared intermittently with the Tucson Sidewinders. The Tucson Toros were featured in an episode of Highway To Heaven, titled \\"Popcorn, Peanuts and Cracker Jacks.\\" Parts of the episode were filmed at Hi Corbett Field. Major League, starring Tom Berenger, Charlie Sheen, Corbin Bernsen and Wesley Snipes was filmed at Hi Corbett Field. The Cleveland Indians held spring training in Tucson from 1947 to 1992; to add to the realistic feel of the movie it was shot at the same locations where the Cleveland Indians played.

The film was released theatrically on October 2, 1987, and stars Virginia Madsen as a beautiful young teenager who must fight against a boarding school that is intent on turning everyone into a Stepford-esque \\"perfect\\" student. Plot Andrea (Virginia Madsen) is a teenage girl that has won a scholarship to Ettinger, a formerly all-male boarding school. She leaves behind her boyfriend Barry (James Wilder) in the hopes of scholastic achievement, but soon discovers that things are not as they seem at Ettinger. Andrea finds that her friends are slowly changing from regular teenagers into personality-less drones. Some investigation shows that the school's faculty has been harvesting life-sustaining chemicals from the student body, which results in them becoming seemingly perfect students that are only focused on doing well in school and obeying rules. Andrea is spared from this fate by one of her professors, Philo (Richard Cox), who takes pity on her due to her resemblance to a former lover. Along with her boyfriend, Andrea discovers that the staff uses classical music as a way of stabilizing the students. Philo gives her a tape to play over the loudspeaker system that he claims will stop the faculty and students from capturing her and turning her into a zombie, only for her to lose it while she is chased by the school's students. With nothing to lose, Barry plays a tape of rock music in its place, which accomplishes the desired task of stopping the students and saving their lives.

Station Avenue goes through the stone archway down to Cathcart Street. Greenock Central station is one of eight railway stations serving the town of Greenock in western Scotland, and is the nearest to the town centre. This station, which is staffed, is on the Inverclyde Line, west of towards Gourock. It has three platforms, two of which are in use, with one disused bay platform. This disused platform is still connected to the main line. It was originally the terminus before the railway was extended to Gourock and at that time was known as Greenock Cathcart station, as the access road to the station leads off the town's Cathcart Street. History The station was opened by the Glasgow, Paisley and Greenock Railway on 31 March 1841 as the terminus of its line from Bridge Street railway station, which had a shared section between Glasgow, and Paisley Gilmour Street being run by the Glasgow and Paisley Joint Railway. Greenock was already a major seaport and a branch near the station provided a goods service, but it was the passenger service which proved a major success. Clyde steamers took a couple of hours to get from Glasgow down the River Clyde as far as Greenock, and now for the first time a railway took only an hour to get to the coast. The terminus with its short driveway sloping down to Cathcart Street was around 300 yards (280 m) from Custom House Quay, Greenock, where steamers took wealthy commuters in summer to their villas around the shores of the Firth of Clyde as well as huge numbers of holidaymakers visiting resorts down the firth at \\"trades holidays\\", particularly the annual Glasgow Fair. When the railway merged with the Caledonian Railway on 9 July 1847, Greenock Cathcart was the main access to the coast. However, in 1869 their dominance of this traffic ended when the Glasgow and South Western Railway opened its station on the waterfront at Princes Pier, Greenock. Greenock's growth had led to increasing overcrowding of tenement houses, and passengers were glad to avoid the walk through these streets. Attempts by the Caledonian to extend their railway to Gourock had met with difficulties in getting through a built up area, but now, spurred by competition, they gained Parliamentary approval in 1884. The route took the railway in a tunnel from the station under the town's Well Park (which provides a level area atop a high rocky crag), then in further cuttings and tunnels westwards through the hillside clear of the expensive properties on the coast. After three years in construction the Gourock Extension Railway opened on 1 June 1889. In the 1923 grouping, the line became part of the LMS, then after coming under British Railways. The line was electrified in 1967. The station buildings The tracks from Glasgow enter at the east end of the wide concourse which is flanked to the north and south by high stone walls, each capped at the east end by a castellated turret. A glazed roof between these walls sheltered the concourse until recently, but it has been removed and small shelters introduced. The northernmost line stops as a bay platform and is not in use, and platform 1 serving eastbound trains opens directly to the top of Station Avenue which slopes down to Cathcart Street through stone archways marking the station entrance. The two tracks in use continue westwards through a tunnel which is capped by the parapet wall to Terrace Road, which leaves Cathcart Street further to the west and rises steeply towards the station before turning south over the tunnel entrance and continuing to rise to the level of the Well Park. Doorways in the parapet wall lead to staircases down to each platform, and to a steel ramp down to Platform 2 serving westbound trains. Originally, there was only one doorway, which led to a sloping passageway which in turn connected with the (now removed) station's internal steel lattice footbridge. Originally, before electrification, this bridge had both stairs and a ramp for porters' trolleys on the up (westbound) platform, and from the landing above the eastbound platform there was the passageway to the door onto Terrace Road, a staircase down to the platform, and an archway through to an external, stone-flagged ramp down to another archway back into the building and platform area. Thus luggage (which in the 19th century would have consisted of large steamer trunks, and been hauled by a porter on a large four wheeled trolley) could be moved from one platform to the other as required. At electrification in 1967, the steel lattice footbridge span above the tracks was raised several feet, and steps inserted at each end, to provide extra clearance for the 25 kV overhead wires, at the same time the up platform ramp to the bridge was removed as the steps in the span meant that trolleys could no longer use the bridge, however the luggage habits of passengers had changed significantly so this was not seen as a problem, the idea of wheelchair/disabled accessibility being still several decades in the future at the time. The internal footbridge was entirely removed in the late 1990s, and an all-new stairway leading to a new doorway onto Terrace Road was built to replace it, leaving the current situation where passengers needing to cross from one platform to the other must do so via Terrace Road. The original booking office was demolished around the early 1990s, being replaced for a time by a portable building and now that the glazed roof has been removed a small booking office with a hipped roof has been added, with the north side of the concourse being made into a car park. Services There is a frequent service in both directions, westwards to Gourock and eastwards to Glasgow Central via Paisley Gilmour Street on Monday to Saturday daytimes. Westbound trains serve all local stations, whilst eastbound trains alternate between expresses that serve Port Glasgow, and Gilmour Street only and all stops locals (2tph each). In the evening, the frequency is halved and on Sundays an hourly all stations service runs in both directions.

It is situated in the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina. The town has a Serb ethnic majority and its population numbers 5,820 people (2002 census). The nearby settlement of Devojački Bunar is also officially part of Banatski Karlovac. Name Roman Catholic church of Saint Charles The picnic area in Devojački Bunar In Serbian, the town is known as Banatski Karlovac (Банатски Карловац), in German as Karlsdorf, and in Hungarian as Nagykárolyfalva. Adjective \\"Banatski\\" (i.e. \\"Banatian\\") was given to differentiate the town from the city of Karlovac in Croatia. History This area was inhabited by humans during the Bronze Age, as well as in the 3rd and 4th century AD. During the Ottoman administration, settlement named Hoča or Oča existed at this location. Settlement named Oča was also mentioned in 1764. During the 18th century, the settlement was populated by Serbs.Dr Slobodan Ćurčić, Naselja Banata, geografske karakteristike, Novi Sad, 2004. Ethnic Germans settled in the settlement starting in 1803, and in the same year some Slavic Krašovani settlers from eastern Banat settled here as well. In 1921, name of the settlement was Karlovo Selo, and in 1926, it was officially named Banatski Karlovac. In the same year, the reading room was founded and monument dedicated to Serbs killed in 1848 revolution was built. Before the end of World War II, most of the inhabitants of this town were ethnic Germans. After the war, their property was confiscated by the state and Germans were expelled or killed in concentration camps run by Yugoslav communist authorities. A German Lutheran church was razed off soon after the expulsion of Germans. After the war, 615 (mostly Serb) families with 3,775 family members settled in the town. They originated from Central Serbia, Bosnia and Montenegro, mostly from area around Užice and Čačak. Some settlers were not satisfied with life conditions in the town, so about 80 families returned to their place of origin. In 1949, town was named Banatsko Rankovićevo, and this name was in use until 1956, when old name Banatski Karlovac was returned. Historical population Notable citizens Rock musician Nikola Čuturilo was born in Banatski Karlovac. Climate Climate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year-round.

The band is known for straightforward, hard-edged melodic punk rock.  Band history  The band was formed upon vocalist Scott Radinsky's departure from Ten Foot Pole, brought about by that band's desire for a singer with a full- time focus on music (Radinsky was also a major-league relief pitcher and has played for the Los Angeles Dodgers, among others). Pulley's initial lineup included Strung Out drummer Jordan Burns, guitarist Jim Cherry ( former bassist of Strung Out and, later, Zero Down), guitarist Mike Harder, and former Face to Face bassist Matt Riddle. Pulley's debut album, Esteem Driven Engine, was released in 1996 by Epitaph Records. Riddle later joined No Use for a Name full-time and was replaced by Tyler Rebbe. Follow-ups included 60 Cycle Hum (1997), @ !* (1999), Together Again for the First Time (2001), and Matters (2004). On July 30, 2008, Pulley announced a follow up EP to Matters, entitled Time-Insensitive Material which was released on March 24, 2009 on the band's own label, X-Members. In December 2010, Pulley announced plans to enter the studio in January 2011 to record a new album with producer Matt Hyde. At that time, there was no word on what label would release the album or if it would be self-released by the band like the Time-Insensitive Material EP. On January 2, 2011, the band announced on their Facebook, recording would begin on January 14; however, on January 6, they posted a message on their Facebook saying, \\"It's our final rehearsal tonight before we go into the studio to record. We got the song structures worked out so now we just have to play them over and over again, they say practice makes perfect.\\" On April 4, 2011, Pulley announced via their Facebook page that they would be releasing a new EP, The Long And The Short Of It, on June 28, 2011. On September 28, 2016, El Hefe owned record label Cyber Tracks announced that they had signed Pulley, and released their first studio album in 12 years, No Change in the Weather, on November 18. The release of this album marked the band's 20th anniversary.

History The Caledonian Railway found that its service to Greenock Central station, which was an inconvenient walk away from the quay, was losing Clyde steamer trade to the new Glasgow and South Western Railway terminal at Prince's Pier in Greenock. So the Caledonian extended its line through a new tunnel to the small fishing village of Gourock. The railway ran on the seaward side of Shore Street to the terminal, which opened on 1 June 1889. The headquarters of the Caledonian steamer fleet was subsequently based there. The station was designed by the architect, James Miller, and engineer-in-chief, George Graham. The initial services in 1889 were 26 trains daily from Glasgow to Gourock, with one additional service on Saturdays. The fastest journey time was 40 minutes, and each train could carry 604 passengers; 224 in first class and the rest in third class. Inspector Halliday, from the western district of the Caledonian Railway, was appointed stationmaster, and Mr Anderson, assistant stationmaster at Cathcart Street Station at Greenock, was appointed assistant stationmaster. The station was built to accommodate large numbers of passengers boarding the steamers. Originally the curving station platform had 17 canopy bays each side over three railway lines, with three bays of full width and the westernmost 19 bays covering the one line which continued on. A central concourse with adjacent offices and stores fronted the pier. On 16 June 1935, a holiday train overran the platform and collided with the buffers. Three people were hospitalised. On 12 December 1957, a fire broke out in the station building. The refreshment room and waiting rooms were badly damaged. Class 318 train at original platform canopies remaining in 2006 Class 314 train leaving the pierhead as a ferry sets off for Dunoon The line from Glasgow was electrified as part of the Inverclyde Line electrification scheme by British Rail. The 25 kV AC system was used, and electric operation commenced in September 1967. In the 1980s, the westernmost end of the station was cut back by 18 bays, and in the 1990s, the adjacent timber quay was demolished. Subsequently, the remaining glazed canopies over the platforms were taken down, leaving only the cast iron supporting structure, slate roofs and glazed canopies over a section incorporating a ticket office and a waiting room. The adjacent Bay Hotel was also demolished in the 1990s, with its site being grassed over. In 2006, a portable ticket office was installed at the end wall, which had been erected when the station was cut back and the old ticket office was closed. Approval was given in 1999 for plans by Inverclyde Council, Caledonian MacBrayne and Railtrack, which involved shortening the railway tracks and constructing a new station adjacent to Caledonian MacBrayne's headquarters. That formed part of a major development scheme, with the space formerly occupied by the station, together with the grassed area which had been the site of the Bay Hotel, providing space for two major supermarkets and housing. Alexander George was appointed preferred developer. MV Argyle and MV Coruisk heading to and from the ferry terminal. However, Network Rail was slow to come to an agreement on relocating the station. The work involved in shortening the tracks would have involved considerable expense and the closure of the station for 18 months. The delay left the station looking rather neglected. Near the end of September 2006, new plans were announced, following intervention by the transport minister Tavish Scott. A considerable saving was to be made by not moving the station so far, so that the work involved was reduced, with the station only closing for four or five weeks. Only one supermarket was now proposed, with 580 houses being constructed in blocks facing out onto the Clyde. In the interim, the station was renovated, at a predicted cost of £630,000, to provide a new entrance, glass roof and toilets, as well as improved waiting facilities. David Simpson, route director of Network Rail in Scotland, advised that essential work had to be carried out to make the station more comfortable for the 400,000 passengers using it every year, while work would continue to \\"explore the longer-term options for the station with our industry partners\\". The new ticket office in November 2010 A new station building was designed by IDP Architects, which was in use by the end of 2010. Work on demolishing the existing canopies and providing new shelters on platforms proceeded through 2011. The new station building was officially opened on 1 August 2012 by Alex Neil MSP, with all works having cost £8m. As part of a new one-way system completed in 2016, the station approach was reorganised, with new car parking and a promenade along past Kempock Point. The station is fully staffed seven days per week throughout the hours of service. Three platforms are in use.\\"Railscot - Gourock Extension (Caledonian Railway)\\" Railscot; Retrieved 2 September 2016 Services Class 385 train in service.

As opposed to vertical integration, in which production occurs within a singular organization, vertical disintegration means that various diseconomies of scale or scope have broken a production process into separate companies, each performing a limited subset of activities required to create a finished product. Filmed entertainment was once highly vertically integrated into a studio system whereby a few large studios handled everything from production to theatrical presentation. After the second world war, the industry was broken into small fragments, each specializing on particular tasks within the division of labor required to produce and show a finished piece of filmed entertainment. Hollywood became highly vertically disintegrated, with specialized firms who only performed certain tasks such as editing, special effects, trailers etc. Bell System divestiture had a similar effect on a larger industry later in the 20th century. One major reason for vertical disintegration is to share risk. Also, in some cases, smaller firms can be more responsive to changes in market conditions. Vertical disintegration is thus more likely when operating in volatile markets. Stability and standardized products more typically engender integration, as it provides the benefits of scale economies. The geography of a disintegrated industry is not a given. Economic geographers typically differentiate between knowledge-intensive, volatile, unstandardized activities, and standardized, routinized production. The former tend to be clustered in space, as they require proximity to build a common conceptual framework and share new ideas. The latter can be far flung and are exemplified by global commodity chains such as apparel and automotive industries. Even in those industries however, design and other creative and non-repetitive tasks tend to exhibit some geographical clustering.  References  * Coase, R.H.

History Railway Clearing House diagram of lines through Paisley in 1908 The station was opened on 14 July 1840 on the Glasgow, Paisley, Kilmarnock and Ayr Railway (GPK&AR;). The station was used jointly by the GPK&AR; and the Glasgow, Paisley and Greenock Railway (GP&GR;). However, the GP&GR; did not run services until March 1841 due to construction difficulties at Bishopton. It was originally built with only two through platforms, with the GPK&R; and the GP&GR; lines separating to the west of the station. The station was later expanded to four platforms, two for the GPK&R; and two for the GP&GR;, with the lines separating to the east of the station., has an 1888 photograph of the station with two through platforms; and the two lines separating to the west of the station. The section between Glasgow Bridge Street railway station and Paisley Gilmour Street station was a joint line: the Glasgow and Paisley Joint Railway. = Twentieth century= The station was electrified as part of the 1967 Inverclyde Line. Ayrshire Coast Line platforms (then numbered 1 and 2) were wired, however the wires finished a short distance west of the station. These were extended as part of the Ayrshire Line electrification by British Rail in 1986. This 1986 work coincided with the renumbering of the platforms with the Glasgow bound platforms numbered 1 (Inverclyde) and 3 (Ayrshire), and the outbound platforms numbers 2 (Inverclyde) and 4 (Ayrshire). Following extensive works, Paisley Gilmour Street now has step-free access to all platforms, and the main access onto County Square, has been joined by a re-opened back access onto Back Sneddon Street. The access was originally built along with the station, but had closed and had been converted into a model shop for a number of years. Despite this conversion the shop retained the steps up to stations lower concourse, however it has been bricked up to prevent access. When the shop owner retired, it was decided to purchase the unit and convert it back as part of the step free access works for disabled people, as it would increase space within the station, and the works were fairly simple since the original stairs were retained. After re-opening it was signed as a dedicated exit to the station for those wishing to use the bus link to the airport, as the buses stop directly outside the door and the airport cycle route which passes outside. A collision occurred between two trains at the eastern end of the station on Easter Monday 1979 which resulted in the deaths of seven people.  Operations  A on an Inverclyde Line service to Paisley Gilmour Street is the busiest of the four Paisley stations. It has four platforms, with trains running on the Inverclyde and Ayrshire Coast lines. It is the fourth busiest railway station in Scotland, after Glasgow Central, Edinburgh Waverley, and Glasgow Queen Street.The usage information (Station Entries and Station Exits) is based on ticket sales in the financial year 2004/05 and covers all National Rail stations.

It is possible to buy a railway ticket to and from the airport, which includes not only the train journey but also the journey on McGill's 757 service. The Glasgow Airport Rail Link would have replaced this bus service with a direct train, but the project was cancelled in September 2009 due to public spending cuts. It is also possible to cycle from the station to the Airport using the Airport Cycle Route. It is an important interchange, not only for the airport bus link, but also for many local buses which depart from the area surrounding the town centre running to destinations throughout the town of Paisley, Renfrew and to the out of town shopping centre, Braehead. It is expected that Braehead will get a dedicated bus link in the future, possibly utilising Hillington East. =British Transport Police= The British Transport Police (BTP) maintain a small office here on Platform 1  Services  Class 311 departs for Gourock in 1981 In the early 1980s up to the electrification of the Ayrshire Coast Line the station was served by: * Glasgow - (DMU): 2 trains per hour (some extended to Girvan) * Glasgow - (DMU): 1 train per hour * Glasgow - (EMU): 3 trains per hour * Glasgow - (EMU): 1 train per hour * Glasgow - (DMU): to connect with ferry to Brodick * Glasgow - (Loco hauled): to connect with ferry to Larne =2016= Class 318 heading towards Glasgow the station is served by: * Glasgow - Ayr (EMU): 2 trains per hour  3 trains per day continue from Glasgow to Edinburgh via Carstairs (2 on Saturdays) * Glasgow - Largs (EMU): 1 train per hour * Glasgow - (EMU): 1 train per hour (5 trains per day on Sundays) * Glasgow - Gourock (EMU): 4 trains per hour (1 on Sundays) * Glasgow - Wemyss Bay (EMU): 1 train per hour Rail & Sea Connections =Northern Ireland= Trains connect Ayr along the Glasgow South Western Line to Stranraer where a bus link runs, route 350 operated by McLeans (except Sundays) to Cairnryan. for onward ferries to the Port of Belfast by Stena Line and Larne Harbour by P&O; Ferries.

His breakout season came in 2001 when he hit a career-best 19 home runs. Fick had another fine offensive year in 2002. He was named to the American League All-Star Team, albeit many attribute the selection being a result of the rule that one player per team must appear in the All-Star Game. In 2002, he also led all major league right fielders in assists, with 21. Fick signed with the Atlanta Braves for the 2003 season. He was released at year's end despite setting a career-high with 80 RBI.

At the further end of the yard area, where the housing development is located, are the parapets of a metal overbridge, presumably used to move goods across from the up platform. The station, built in 1865, was substantially modified in 2012 to accommodate the erection of a footbridge with an integrated lift. This structure was required as a planning permission clause related to the construction of a new housing estate in the fields across the line from the station. It was not possible to fit a ramped bridge in the available space, hence the need for a lift, making Inverkip one of the few unmanned stations in Scotland to have a lift (other examples can be found at and ).

Upon returning to duty in 1839, Page will serve at the Gosport Navy Yard as an ordnance officer. During this tour of duty at Norfolk, he married a local woman, Alexina Taylor, in 1841; they would have four children.

As soon as the Commonwealth of Virginia ceded from the Union, U.S. Navy Commander Richard Lucian Page resigned his rank and office while at the Navy Yard. With the Confederates Now out of the U.S. Navy, Richard L. Page next served as a naval aide-de-camp to the Governor of Virginia John Letcher with special duties to organize a State of Virginia Navy. While in this Office, Page supervised the building of fortifications at the mouth of the James River as well as those on the Nansemond River and on the Pagan River. On June 10, 1861, Richard Page received a commission as a Confederate States of America Navy Commander. Prior to the evacuation at Norfolk, Virginia, he served at the shipyard. Upon being promoted to C.S. Navy captain a short time later, Page went on to establish the ordnance and construction depot located at Charlotte, North Carolina, which he would largely manage during the period of 1861–1864. During this time of 1861–1864, however, he would also briefly be in command of C.S. Navy forces at Savannah, Georgia, and would also be active in the Battle of Port Royal in November 1861, where he served on under the fleet command of C.S. Navy squadron Flag Officer Josiah Tattnall. Then on March 1, 1864, Richard Page left the C.S. Navy to join the C.S. Army; he got a commission as a C.S. Army brigadier general. He was then assigned to take command of the outer defenses of the C.S. Army held location at Mobile Bay, Alabama and would set up his headquarters at Fort Morgan. Brigadier General Page was in command of the Confederate garrison that controlled Fort Morgan, Alabama during the Union's attacks on Mobile Bay. Fort Morgan withstood the Union attack on April 5, 1864, but was besieged on April 9. Then on August 8, 1864, a 10,000-man and 200-cannon Union task force arrived to challenge Page's 400-man and 26-cannon Confederate force. Union task force staff summoned Page and told him to surrender; he replied that he would defend the fort to the end. Federal troops then moved their works closer to the outdated fort for the next two weeks. Then on August 22, 1864, heavy Union cannon fire replaced the lighter cannon fire of the previous two weeks. For the next 12 hours, 3,000 Union cannon shells were thrown at the fort. This Union cannon fire started some fires in the fort and threatened to ignite the Confederate powder magazine, and so the defenders put the powder kegs in the cisterns. On August 23 Brigadier General Richard Lucian Page unconditionally surrendered the fort, because his troops had little usable gunpowder. Indignant, he broke his sword over his knee instead of surrendering his sword to the Federals. Page's situation was further worsened when he was suspected of destroying munitions and works within the fort after he had agreed to surrender. He was arrested by the Federal authorities and imprisoned at Fort Delaware on Pea Patch Island until September 1865. Late life Page returned to Norfolk after the war, eventually becoming superintendent of public schools from 1875 to 1883.

Career Skelton writes for several television programmes, including Have I Got News For You, 8 Out of 10 Cats, 10 O'Clock Live and The Big Fat Quiz of the Year. He has also written for A League of Their Own, The Eleven O'Clock Show, and FAQ U, and he was one of the writers on the MTV Europe Music Awards 2004. In 2009, he began to report on the Bilderberg Group for The Guardian (series title: Our Man at Bilderberg), with his first article entitled \\"Our man at Bilderberg: in pursuit of the world's most powerful cabal\\". He has covered all the subsequent Bilderberg Group conferences: the 2010 conference in Sitges, Spain; the 2011 conference in St Moritz, Switzerland; the 2012 conference in Chantilly, Virginia, USA; the 2013 conference which was held at The Grove, Watford; and the 2014 conference in Copenhagen, Denmark. Skelton was the Script Editor on Charlie Brooker's comedy panel show You Have Been Watching and on Brooker's BBC Radio 4 show So Wrong It's Right. He was the co- founder, with Paul Carr, of The Friday Thing, a weekly email bulletin they started in 2001, and, in 2004, of the short-lived weekly all-comment newspaper The London News Review, with cartoons provided by Matt Groening. In 2005 he founded The Clacton Festival. Skelton and fellow writer Victoria Coren used to hold a job reviewing porn films for the Erotic Review. They soon decided that most of the porn they had to watch was terrible and believed they could do better themselves, so the two of them set about making their own porn film, The Naughty Twins. They wrote about the process of doing so, and of the many lessons they learned (mostly good), in their book Once More, with Feeling: How We Tried to Make the Greatest Porn Film Ever (2003). Skelton and Coren also appeared as judges on the final episode of the reality TV show Double Entry. In 2006, Skelton appeared on the BBC One reality gameshow Just the Two of Us. Art In early 2000, Skelton put on a joint show with Hannah Borno at the Colville Place Gallery in Fitzrovia.\\"Homage to the forgotten films\\", BBC News, 23 January 2000. Skelton's first solo show, \\"Art is Easy\\", was held in 2001 at the Colville Place Gallery.\\"Come on, Damien and Tracey – look at yourselves and laugh\\", The Guardian, 25 March 2001. On 19–21 March 2003, he held a Performance art exhibition, \\"The Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone from Suffolk\\", at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London. Acting =The Human Zoo= Sometime prior to May 2002, when the documentary was released, Skelton was part of a TV miniseries named The Human Zoo. It was produced by London Weekend Television. The three part series aired on 11 May 2000 in the UK. The programme, which was subsequently made available on DVD and purchased by interested sociology, psychology and other professors around the world, was taught at college levels in the US, the UK and Australia. =Space Cadets= In 2005, Skelton was one of three actors posing as contestants in the Channel 4 spoof reality TV show Space Cadets. After weeks of training, Skelton and three genuine contestants were selected to go on a fake space mission. Afterwards Skelton wrote an essay about his part in the deception for The Guardian, part of which runs: > So, that was the oddest three-and-a-half weeks of my life. My poor brain is > a scramble of half-truths, astronomical lies and unbridled lunacy. I've just > scribbled a list of what I know for sure: I've been a mole on a fake reality > show called Space Cadets; I have a Russian doll in my hand luggage; I've > just spent the past five days in a flight simulator in a hangar on the > Suffolk coast; and – last but by no means least – I've just spent the past > five days in space.

The station is a terminus on the Inverclyde Line, about west of . The station incorporates the Caledonian MacBrayne ferry terminal connecting mainland Scotland to Rothesay on the Isle of Bute. The station is managed by Abellio ScotRail. In Britain's 100 Best Railway Stations by Simon Jenkins, the station was one of only ten to be awarded five stars, and was the station photographed on the front cover.  History  Work began in late 1862 on the single track Greenock and Wemyss Bay Railway branching from the main Glasgow, Paisley and Greenock Railway at Port Glasgow and taking an inland route across to the coast at Inverkip before descending to Wemyss Bay. This was to connect to Clyde steamer services for Rothesay, Largs, and Millport, Isle of Cumbrae, allowing a combined train and steamer journey time of an hour and a half, compared with a typical time of three hours by steamer from Glasgow. The Wemyss Bay Steamboat Company was formed to own the connecting steamers, competing with the private owners of other Clyde steamer services. The route opened on 15 May 1865, but over-ambitious timetables led to severe delays during the first year, damaging the company's reputation, and the route subsequently faced strong competition from other pierheads. A camping coach was positioned here by the Scottish Region in 1961, then two coaches from 1962 to 1969, with an additional one in 1965 only. Train services were electrified in 1967 by British Rail, using the 25 kV AC system.  Station building  The station was designed by James Miller in 1903 for the Caledonian Railway and is remarkable in its use of glass and steel curves. The station is noted for its architectural qualities and, although one of Scotland's finest railway buildings and Category A listed, it has suffered from neglect. A major refurbishment scheme carried out jointly by Network Rail, Inverclyde Council and the Scottish Government from June 2014 to the spring of 2016 has seen the station buildings and adjacent ferry terminal fully restored. Two platforms are currently in use, though there were three available until 1987.  Services  There is an hourly service daily to and Glasgow Central (including Sundays), with one or two extra weekday peak trains. The average journey time is 55 minutes.

History Original emblem of the Society of the Sacred Heart Madeleine Sophie Barat founded the Society of the Sacred Heart in the wake of the French Revolution to provide educational opportunities for girls. The manner of life was to be simple without the prescribed austerities of the older orders, which would be incompatible with the work of education. In some houses the religious conducted just one school, but in several places, especially in the larger houses in cities there were at least two schools, a boarding school and a school for poor children.Gimber RSCJ, Frances. \\"Keepers of the Flame\\", 2011 The first convent was opened at Amiens in 1801. Other houses were opened in Grenoble, Poitiers, Niort, and Cuigniers. In 1826 the society obtained the formal approbation of Pope Leo XII and the first cardinal protector was appointed.Stuart, Janet. \\"The Society of the Sacred Heart of Jesus.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 14. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 22 Sept. 2015 Barat remained superior general of the Society from 1806 until her death in 1865. The Society of the Sacred Heart quickly expanded within Europe and beyond.\\"Our heritage\\", Society of the Sacred Heart, United States - Canada In 1818 Rose Philippine Duchesne first brought the Society to the Americas, establishing the first free school west of the Mississippi in St. Charles Missouri. The Society opened institutions of higher education for women in Cincinnati; Grand Coteau, Louisiana; Lake Forest, Illinois; New York; Torresdale (a suburb of Philadelphia), Pennsylvania; Omaha; St. Louis; San Francisco; Seattle; Newton, Massachusetts; and San Diego. The Society came to England in 1842, founding a girl's boarding school at Elm Grove in Roehampton. That school evolved into a teacher training school Digby Stuart College. The Sisters have been involved in education ever since, and founded schools around the country. Most are no longer directly run by the order but are under its trusteeship or the diocese. In 2004 Digby Stuart College federated with three other local colleges to become the University of Roehampton. The England and Wales province are largely centered in Roehampton where it maintains two houses. The Barat House community consists of a group of RSCJ sisters and university students who live in the community house in the grounds of Digby Stuart College.Society of the Sacred Heart, England & Wales The Duchesne House is also a registered care house for elderly sisters. Its community plays an active role in the pastoral care of pupils at the nearby Sacred Heart Primary School. The first RSCJ arrived in New Zealand in 1880. In 1909 RSCJ established a Catholic girls school, Baradene College of the Sacred Heart in Remuera, Auckland, New Zealand.Baradene College of the Sacred Heart, Remuera, Auckland Sr. Philomene (Phil) Tiernan, RSCJ of the Australis/New Zealand Province was among the passengers of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 shot down over the Ukraine in 2014.\\"MH17 Tragedy: Prayers for Philomene Tiernan RSCJ\\", Society of the Sacred Heart, International, July 18, 2014 Between 1906 and 1909, the French government forced the closing of forty-seven houses of the Society in that country, and 2500 religious were dispersed to other countries. The motherhouse was relocated to Ixelles, Belgium. The rule of cloister was removed at the General Chapter of 1964. The first foundation in Uganda was established by six RSCJ in 1962. In 1984 RSCJ took over management of the St. Charles Lwanga Girls' Training Centre, in Kalungu, founded in 1967 by Fr. Emiliano La Croix of the Missionaries of Africa.

It was a jet-powered development of the earlier piston-engined Saab 21. It was the first jet aircraft to be produced by Saab. Along with the Soviet Yakovlev Yak-15, the 21R was one of only two jet fighters to have been successfully converted from a piston-powered aircraft.Gunston 1995, p. 472. During the Second World War, the nation of Sweden, feeling under threat during the expanding conflict, ordered Saab to develop an advanced front-line fighter aircraft. The corresponding aircraft was an unorthodox twin-boom pusher configuration fighter aircraft, featuring a low-mounted wing, a tricycle landing gear arrangement, and was furnished with heavy forward-firing armament. Throughout 1945, several different options were explored with the intention of improving the 21's performance, leading to SAAB working on producing a version of the 21 that would harness jet propulsion. On 10 March 1947, the maiden flight of the 21R occurred. During 1947, at the direction of the Swedish Air Force, SAAB began converting the service's piston-engined J 21s to use jet propulsion instead, which required each aircraft to receive extensive modifications. A production run of 124 aircraft was originally envisaged, including four prototypes, however, the type was instead mainly used as a fighter-aircraft and orders were almost halved to 64 aircraft. As a fighter, its service designation in the Swedish Air Force was J 21R, and saw service in the late 1940s and early 1950s before it was replaced by a new generation of fighters that had been designed from the onset to harness jet propulsion, such as the de Havilland Vampire and the Saab 29 Tunnan. Design and development =Background= During the early stages of the Second World War, the nation of Sweden was concerned that its neutrality and its independence could come under threat by one or more of the belligerent powers, enacted a series of emergency measures to increase its military's combat preparedness and deterrence value against would-be aggressors. During the period of 1939–1941, the Swedish Air Force committed itself to a major expansion programme, which included the procurement of large number of foreign-sourced and indigenously developed fighters. As a consequence of the raging conflict across Europe, there were not many nations who possessed the available production capacity or a willingness to prioritise the supply of modern fighter aircraft to Sweden, being a relatively small neutral country; while Sweden's own domestic production capability had been deemed to be insufficient until at least 1943, it was recognised that it would be necessary for the nation to build up its own first-rate designs to meet its needs.Cattaneo 1967, pp. 10-12. During 1941, in response to demand from the Swedish Air Force, the Swedish aviation company SAAB commenced work upon bringing a radical new fighter design.Widfeldt 1966, p. 3. The company envisioned an unorthodox twin-boom pusher configuration fighter aircraft, featuring a low-mounted wing, a tricycle landing gear arrangement, and was furnished with heavy forward-firing armament.Widfeldt 1966, p. 4. It was powered by a piston engine, specifically a localised version of Germany's new Daimler-Benz DB 605B inline engine, which was refined and built by Swedish firm Svenska Flygmotor AB for the programme. Designated as the J 21 by the Swedish Air Force, the proposal was accepted and authorised to proceed to the prototype stage; on 30 July 1943, the first J 21 prototype, powered by the 605B engine, conducted its maiden flight, flown by SAAB test pilot Claes Smith.Widfeldt 1966, pp. 3-4. Throughout 1945, several different options were explored with the intention of improving the 21's performance.Widfeldt 1966, p. 7. Many of these speculative upgrades involved the substitution of the 605B engine with a more powerful alternative powerplant. During the first half of the year, the company had planned out a variant of the fighter that would be powered by a Rolls-Royce Griffon engine, capable of producing a maximum of 2,000hp; according to estimate, the Griffon would have provided the 21 with a projected top speed of 416mph. Other projects, such as the studied SAAB 27, were intended to use the Griffon as well; however, by the end of the year, all work on piston-engine design had been abandoned by the company in favour of another means of improvement. In parallel with the piston-engine studies, SAAB and several other Swedish companies had been evaluating the options for the adoption of an innovative, brand new type of engine - the jet engine. Two early studies, designated as RX 1 and RX 2, had been examined, both of which being twin-boom aircraft similar to the 21.Widfeldt 1966, pp. 7-8. Recognising enthusiasm on the part of the Swedish Air Force for a jet-powered aircraft to be made available, during late 1945, SAAB resolved itself to producing a version of the 21 that would harness jet propulsion.Widfeldt 1966, p. 8. As such, Saab launched a design study with the aim of best determining how to power the J 21A with a jet engine. It was viewed as being highly desirable to 'catch up' with recent innovations in the field of fighter development, which was visibly advancing rapidly in nations such as the United Kingdom where, among others, British aircraft manufacturer de Havilland had already placed its own jet fighter, the de Havilland Vampire, into production. For some months after starting work during late 1945, the design study proceeded without focusing on a specific engine, the selection of which was an open question for some time. As SAAB continued its work on the initiative, it became possible for Sweden to purchase the \\"Goblin 2\\", a turbojet engine, directly from de Havilland Engine Company, along with the license to manufacture it in Sweden. Acquired as per this manner, the engine became the first jet engine to be used by the Swedish Air Force, who designated it as the RM1. On 10 March 1947, the maiden flight of Saab's first jet aircraft, being a converted J 21, outfitted with a single Goblin 2 engine, took place. The results of the subsequent flight test programme was largely viewed as satisfactory. =Conversion programme= During 1947, at the direction of the Swedish Air Force, SAAB began to receive the service's piston-engined J 21s for the purpose of converting them to jet propulsion. This conversion work involved an extensive rebuilding programme, requiring each aircraft to be extensively modified. In all, in excess of 50 per cent of the airframe, tailplane and wing was changed and, most significantly, each of the fighters was furnished with a single British-sourced de Havilland Goblin turbojet engine, which took the place of the DB 605B and propeller unit. The resulting jet-propelled fighter was adopted by the Swedish Air Force and became the service's first jet aircraft. In light of its extensive changes and to differentiate them from its predecessors, rebuilt 21s were assigned the designation of J 21R.Erichs et al. 1988, p. 23. Many changes had to be made in order to accommodate the Goblin engine, which had considerably different properties and requirements than the earlier DB 605B unit. In order to sufficiently address the position of the new engine's exhaust, the stabilizer of the tailplane had to be raised from its former position, effectively requiring the tail section to be redesigned. Additionally, to sufficiently feed the hungry turbojet engine, the fighter's fuel volume was increased significantly via the installation of additional fuel tanks within the middle section of the wing and a pair of large wingtip tanks. At the same time, various measures to improve the fighter's aerodynamic properties were implemented during the rebuild process, leading to the adoption of curved glass in the forward section of the cockpit canopy, while the leading edge of the wing also received modifications. It was decided to implement air brakes in the form of an additional flap located on the outer wing's trailing edge. The ejection seat, which was a relatively new innovation, received various alterations and improvements that enabled it to correctly eject during higher speed flight. The attack version, designated as the A 21R, saw the addition of 14.5 cm and 18 cm ground attack rockets, which could be installed underneath the middle wing. Furthermore, an alternative external gun pod called \\"Paddan\\", meaning the toad, could also be installed underneath the middle wing in place of the rockets. Paddan contained eight 8 mm ksp m/22 machine guns with 800 rounds of ammunition per gun. The fire control system of the plane allowed it to fire all guns and all its rockets or gunpod at the same time. This was an interesting \\"sensation\\" for the pilot as it made the airplane lose airspeed and almost stop mid air. A production of 124 planes was planned originally, including four prototypes. When experience with the type as a fighter was gained with the F 10 wing it was concluded that all aircraft needed to be changed to attack aircraft. The production series was then reduced to 64 aircraft. Of these, 34 fighters were designated as the J 21RA (later re designated to A 21RA), powered by the Goblin 2 engine, known as the RM1 in Sweden, which was capable of generating a maximum of 1360kp of thrust. The other 30 were of the A 21RB standard, which was powered by a Swedish-made Goblin 3 engine, designated in Swedish Air Force service as the RM1A, capable of producing 1500kp of thrust. Operational history The first prototype Saab 21R first flew on 10 March 1947,Billing 1983, p. 22. almost 2 years after the Second World War. The aircraft first entered service with F 10 in August 1950. Although the type was originally intended as a fighter aircraft, a newly developed fighter, the Saab J 29 first flew in October 1948, the number to be produced was halved from 120 to 60, and eventually all 21Rs were converted to attack aircraft as A 21RA or the A 21RB depending on the engine type.

The British were led by The Chief Commissioner of Oude, Sir Henry Lawrence. The insurgent force, which consisted of mutineers from the East India Company's army and retainers of local landowners, was led by Barkat Ahmad, a mutineer officer of the Company's army. Opening moves Conflicting intelligence reports had indicated the approach of a small insurgent force towards Lucknow. Sir Henry, who was in bad health, under pressure from subordinates and whose fighting days were well behind him, ordered a force consisting of three companies of the 32nd Regiment of Foot (later the Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry), several companies of the 13th Native Infantry and detachments of other regiments, a small force of Sikh cavalry and European volunteer cavalry as well as Bengal Artillery (Europeans) and Native Artillery, to proceed up the Faizabad road with the intention of intercepting what he believed to be an opponent several hundred strong. The battle On approaching Ismaelganj, Lawrences's force was suddenly fired on by the insurgents, who greatly outnumbered the British, by about 6,000 to 600. The rebels were in well prepared positions, behind stone walls and in the village, and soon inflicted heavy casualties on Lawrence's force, especially the 32nd Foot. The regiment's acting commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel William Case, was killed, as were several officers. The 13th Native Infantry were slightly more successful in attacking to the right of the village, but the rebels were well entrenched and well led. To the latter fact may be attributed one of the few major victories which rebel forces obtained in open combat with the British, during the whole of the 'Mutiny'. At a crucial moment, many of Lawrence's soldiers, especially Indian artillerymen, betrayed him by going over to the other side, overturning their guns and cutting the traces on the horses and the Sikh cavalrymen fled. As the British retreated towards the bridge over the Kukrail stream, the only access they had to Lucknow, an outflanking movement by the rebel cavalry threatened to cut them off. A charge by the 36 volunteer cavalrymen, consisting partly of civilians, threw the rebel cavalry into confusion and a significant part of the force was able to cross the bridge and retreat towards Lucknow. Lawrence ordered a battery of European artillery to occupy the bridgehead, with the intention of dissuading his enemy from following him. The artillery had no ammunition left, but achieved their aim of giving the retreating force a breathing space. The retreat On the retreat, feats of great courage were performed by those who helped wounded and exhausted men to escape. Prominent among the rescuers were the native troops of the 13th NI, who often abandoned their own wounded in order to help British soldiers. An officer of the 13th NI, then Lieut. William George Cubitt, would be awarded the Victoria Cross for helping save three men of the 32nd Foot. Seeing that the retreat would be generally successful, Lawrence left the force in order to organize the defence of the Lucknow residency. Brigadier John Inglis, commanding officer of the 32nd, who had opposed the 'adventure', was left to bring the survivors in. As a last attempt to break the momentum of the rebel pursuit, Lawrence ordered one company of the 32nd, which had not been at Chinhat, to hold the final bridge before Lucknow, over the Gumti river. The success of this company, under Lieut. John Edmondstone, and its orderly retreat under enemy pressure, probably helped save many lives. By about 11:30 a.m, the retreat had been successfully completed. The British Residency at Lucknow, to which Lawrence withdrew, was then the scene of the Siege of Lucknow until November 1857.

The film was directed by Richard Benjamin. It was shot in various locations in Oakland, California and at Oakland Technical High School. A notable song on the soundtrack is \\"Colors of Love,\\" written by Carole Bayer Sager, James Ingram and Bruce Roberts, and produced by David Foster, which alludes to the story line. Plot Zora Matthews, whose mother Sarah conceived her with the aid of an anonymous sperm donor, discovers that her father is a white man named Hal Jackson. This comes as a major shock to Sarah, who had explicitly requested a black donor. On top of that, Jackson is a loud, self-promoting car salesman, which clashes with Sarah's intellectualism. The film revolves around Zora and her mother's rocky relationship with Jackson. Jackson eventually comes to love his daughter and her mother. Cast * Whoopi Goldberg as Sarah Mathews * Ted Danson as Hal Jackson * Nia Long as Zora Mathews * Will Smith as Tea Cake Walters * Jennifer Tilly as Stacy * Paul Rodriguez as Jose * Peggy Rea as Alberta * Clyde Kusatsu as Bob Takashima * David Bowe as Teddy * Jeff Joseph as James * Shawn Levy as Dwayne Production The story did not originally specify black actors for any of the roles and was rewritten upon Goldberg's casting. Homage The character of Hal Jackson is based in part on the real life car dealership owner Cal Worthington. Hal's use of large circus animals in his car commercials are an homage to Cal's famous \\"My Dog Spot\\" ads, which were also filmed with live circus animals.

Cheney (1862–1942), Appointment Secretary at University of California, Berkeley for over forty years.The Berkeley Daily Planet (October 29, 2009) At first he worked in his father's real estate business, later moving to Detroit where he founded the Theatre Arts Magazine in 1916 and edited it until 1921. Cheney was one of the most significant pro-modernist theatre and art critics of the early twentieth century. He helped introduce European modernist practices in theatre to the United States. His Theatre Arts Magazine promoted American little theatre activity, advocated for New Stagecraft design, and nurtured new American playwrights. Early years Cheney grew up in Berkeley, California, in what he called \\"an atmosphere of literary ambition and activity\\". His father, Warren Cheney, was an author of poetry and fiction, and served as editor of the popular California magazine, Overland Monthly, and his mother, May L. Cheney, organized a teacher placement office at the University of California, Berkeley and was the founder of the National Association of Appointment Secretaries (NAAS) now known as the American College Personnel Association. The younger Cheney had a passion for the art of bookmaking and, while studying architecture at Berkeley, founded a quarterly journal for designers and collectors of bookplates—his first foray into the field of magazine publishing. He graduated in 1908 with a bachelor's degree in architecture. During his studies, Cheney also developed a love for theatre, inspired largely by performances of Greek drama he had attended at Berkeley’s outdoor Hearst Greek Theatre. In the years immediately following his graduation, Cheney married Maud Maurice Turner and found intermittent work as an art and theatre critic. In 1913, Cheney began studying drama at Harvard University. While there he attended the Boston installation of New York City's legendary Armory Show, an experience of modern art which fostered Cheney's growing fascination with new art and theatre. He began to write on the subject of modernism, and his first book, The New Movement in the Theatre, was published in 1914. It was around this time that Cheney decided to create a new journal focused on progressive ideas in the theatre. Later years Cheney served as the main editor and writer for Theatre Arts Magazine from 1916-1921. Upon the October 1921 publication of the last issue of Volume V, Cheney removed himself from the editorial staff. He continued to contribute occasional articles for some years but was never again on the staff. Cheney later remarked that he left in order to pursue professional theatre practice. He joined the Actor's Theatre in New York briefly, but there is no record of Cheney’s actual participation in any professional work with the group. After Cheney ceased editorship of Theatre Arts Magazine in 1921, he began writing more about modern art. His multiple editions of A Primer on Modern Art helped frame the discussion of modernist painting and sculpture until the 1950s. In 1945, he departed from his usual vocation with his book, Men Who Have Walked with God, tracing mysticism through history, concentrating on eleven men from Lao-Tse and the Buddha to Jacob Boehme and William Blake. He lived for many years in New Hope, Pennsylvania, then returned to his home town of Berkeley in 1976. Among his books are * The New Movement in the Theatre (1914) * Art- Lovers Guide to the Panama Pacific International Exposition (1915) * The Art Theatre (1917) * The Open Air Theatre (1918) * Modern Art and the Theatre (1921) * A Primer of Modern Art (1924) * The New World Architecture (1930) * Art and the Machine (1936) * The Theatre (1929) * Stage Decorations (1928) * Expressionism in Art (1934) * The Story of Modern Art (1941) * Men Who Have Walked with God: Being the Story of Mysticism through the Ages Told in the Biographies of Representative Seers and Saints with Excerpts from Their Writings and Sayings (1945) * Sculpture of the World: A History, The Viking Press, New York (1968) * The Theatre: Three Thousand Years of Drama, Acting and Stagecraft, Longmans, Green and Co.

The first TV series based on Marvel characters, it debuted in syndication on U.S. television in 1966. Produced by Grantray-Lawrence Animation, headed by Grant Simmons, Ray Patterson and Robert Lawrence,Robert Lawrence interview, Jack Kirby Collector #41, Fall 2004, pp. 42-47. it was an umbrella series of five segments, each approximately seven minutes long, broadcast on local television stations that aired the show at different times. The series ran initially as a half-hour program made up of three seven-minute segments of a single superhero, separated by a short description of one of the other four heroes. It has also been broadcast as a mixture of various heroes in a half-hour timeslot, and as individual segments as filler or within a children's TV program. The segments were \\"Captain America\\", \\"The Incredible Hulk\\", \\"Iron Man\\", \\"The Mighty Thor\\" and \\"The Sub-Mariner\\". Production Sixty-five half-hour episodes of three seven-minute chapters were produced, for a total of 195 segments that ran initially in broadcast syndication from September 1, 1966 to December 1, 1966. The series, produced in color, had extremely limited animation produced by xerography, consisting of photocopied images taken directly from the comics and manipulated to minimize the need for animation production. The cartoons were presented as a series of static comic- strip panel images; generally the only movement involved the lips when a character spoke, the eyes, and the occasional arm or leg, or a fully animated black silhouette. The series used the original stories largely in their entirety, showcasing Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko and Don Heck art, among others, from the period fans and historians call the Silver Age of comic books. Stan Lee, Marvel's editor and art director at the time, said in 2004 that he believed publisher Martin Goodman negotiated the deal with Grantray-Lawrence and that Lawrence chose the characters to be used. Lawrence rented Lee and his wife a penthouse apartment at 30 East 60th Street, near Madison Avenue, for Lee's use while he worked on the series. (Lee lived in Hewlett Harbor, New York, on Long Island, at the time.) Lee recalled, \\"I really don't remember any reaction from the Marvel artists involved. I wish I could claim to have written the [theme song] lyrics, because I think they're brilliant, but alas, I didn't\\". The songs were written by Jacques Urbont. In the meantime, Grantray-Lawrence subcontracted production of The Mighty Thor segments to Paramount Cartoon Studios (the animation division of Paramount Pictures, formerly known as Famous Studios), headed at that time by Fleischer Studios veteran Shamus Culhane. Marvel announced the series in the \\"Marvel Bullpen Bulletins\\" of the November 1966 issues, stating in that monthly fan page's hyperbolic style that, \\"It won't be long before our swingin' super-heroes [sic] make their star-studded debut on TV, appearing five nights a week -- that's right, five -- count 'em -- five nights a week, for a half-hour each night. So you've just got time to make sure your set's in good working order -- check your local paper for time and station -- and prepare to have a ball!\\"Marvel Bullpen Bulletins: \\"Sensational Secrets and Incredible Inside Information Guilelessly Guaranteed to Avail You Naught!\\", in Tales of Suspense #83 (Nov. 1966) and other Marvel comics that month.

Actors portraying other characters, including Dr. Doom, Hulk, and Bucky, also appeared in live-action segments. The segments were scripted by Superman co-creator Jerry Siegel. Guest characters Appearing in guest roles were: * The X-Men -- The original lineup of the Angel, the Beast, Cyclops, Iceman, and Marvel Girl appeared in a Sub-Mariner episode, \\"Dr. Doom's Day / The Doomed Allegiance / Tug of Death\\". The story was an adaptation of Fantastic Four #6 (Sept. 1962), but since Grantray-Lawrence Animation did not own rights to the Fantastic Four, the producers substituted the X-Men -- although referring to them instead as \\"Allies for Peace\\". However, the characters retained their original designs and individual names from the comics. * The Avengers -- Episode 8 of The Incredible Hulk was an adaptation of Avengers #2 (Nov. 1963), and co-starred Thor, Iron Man (with his early golden armor recolored to match the red-and-gold design featured in the Iron Man episodes), Giant-Man, the Wasp. The lineup beginning in Avengers #4 (March 1964), with Thor, Iron Man, Giant-Man, the Wasp and the newly installed Captain America, appears in several Captain America episodes, as does the later line-up from Avengers #16 with Hawkeye, Quicksilver, and the Scarlet Witch.

He was afterwards ambassador at Berlin and St. Petersburg. After his retirement in 1863 from the public service in the Bohemian Landtag and the Austrian Reichsrat he supported the federal policy of his brother Leo. In 1879 he was made a hereditary member of the Upper House. In this position he was, on his death 24 September 1881, succeeded by his eldest son Franz (born 1847). = Maria Wilhelmine von Thun und Hohenstein = Countess Maria Wilhelmine von Thun und Hohenstein, née Countess von Ulfeldt was a Viennese aristocrat of the 18th century.

He was hired in 1937, immediately after receiving his bachelor's degree in aeronautical engineering from the University of Michigan. Prior to that, he was in the first graduating class of The Leelanau School, a boarding school in Glen Arbor, Michigan. He contributed to the designs of a number of historic Lockheed aircraft, including the Constellation, P-80 Shooting Star, XF-90, F-94 Starfire, and F-104 Starfighter. During World War II, he was part of the group of Lockheed designers who designed the first American attempt at a jet plane, the Lockheed L-133. Jack Real, left; Willis Hawkins, center; Joseph Ware, Jr., right, at a StarDusters gathering. In 1951, he led the design team that created the proposal for the Lockheed Model 82, which would become the C-130 Hercules, with Joseph F. Ware, Jr. as Flight Test Engineer in charge. Hawkins started the Lockheed Missiles and Space Company and served as President. He was elected a Vice President of the Lockheed Corporation in 1960 and later served on the corporation’s board of directors. Hawkins served as Assistant Secretary for Research and Development for the US Army from 1962 to 1965, where he was instrumental in starting development of the M1 Abrams main battle tank. He retired from Lockheed in 1980, but Lockheed chairman Roy Anderson brought Hawkins back to run the Lockheed—California Company on an interim basis in the 1980s. Hawkins retired for good in 1986.

The airport's hinterland goes from Gap to Arles and from Toulon to Avignon. It is the fifth busiest French airport by passenger traffic and third largest for cargo traffic. In 2012 the airport achieved the fourth highest European passenger traffic growth, at 12.7% with 8,295,479 passengers. Marseille Provence Airport serves as a focus city for Air France. In summer 2013, the airport served 132 regular destinations, the largest offer in France after the Parisian airports. History Aerial view Check-in hall Apron view Formerly known as Marseille–Marignane Airport, it has been managed since 1934 by the Marseille- Provence Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CCI). In the 1920s and 1930s, Marignane was one of France's main points of operation for flying boats. It even briefly served as a terminal for Pan American World Airways Clipper flying boats. Other flying boat operators were Aéropostale and Air Union, the latter moving over from Antibes in 1931. Marignane was also a production site for hydroplanes by Lioré et Olivier. Antoine de Saint-Exupery describes turning back to Marignane airport with a fuel leak in chapter 8 of “Wind, Sand and Stars”, before setting out again for Tunis, and the fateful event that informed his later description of the crash-landing in his best-known book, “The Little Prince”. In September 2006, the airport opened its new terminal MP2 for budget airlines. In 2013 the airport expanded its shopping and dining options, with 30 new shops and restaurants, among which is the first Burger King restaurant in France since 1997.

It is located in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Saint Louis and is owned and operated by the De La Salle Christian Brothers Midwest District. History =Early years (1850–1916)= The school was founded in 1850 under the name St. Joseph's Academy by three French-speaking Christian Brothers who had come to St. Louis the previous year from Montreal, Quebec. In 1851, the school moved from its original location at 16th and Market Streets to 8th and Cerre Streets in downtown St. Louis, and the name changed to the \\"Academy of the Christian Brothers.\\" In December 1855, the school was granted a college charter, becoming the Brothers' first U.S. institution to operate at the collegiate level. In 1882, due to lack of space, the school moved to the \\"Cote Brilliante\\" campus in north St. Louis on the northeast corner of Easton Ave. and N. Kingshighway, where it served as a primary, secondary, and college boarding school for boys. At one point in the 1890s, more than half of St. Louis' clergy were graduates of CDC. The Summer Olympic Games were held in St. Louis in 1904, and it had been decided that those Olympics would be the first Olympics to feature a competitive soccer (association football) tournament and to award medals in the sport. Concerns regarding team travel from Europe, and a lack of amateur players of the sport, were addressed when the Cadets of Christian Brothers College (along with the Raiders, a soccer team made up from members of St. Rose Parish Church Athletics Association) were invited to represent the United States in the association football tournament of the 1904 Summer Olympic Games. The only other entrant in the competition, held in Francis Field in mid-November, were the then-champions of Canada, from Galt, Ontario. The Canadians easily won the gold medals, but Christian Brothers College came second, and each member of the team was awarded an Olympic silver medal. Those remain the only medals ever awarded to a school or college in Olympic history. Furthermore, that second-place finish is still to this day the best result achieved by a United States soccer team at the Olympic Games. The eleven members of the school team included three brothers, John, Thomas and Charles January, and the youngest of the siblings was just 16 years old at the time. Charles January went on to become the last surviving member of that team, before he too died in 1970. On October 5, 1916, a fire destroyed the school,http://www.usgennet.org/usa/mo/county/stlouis/kempland/2cbc-fire22.jpg killing seven firefighters, two sick Brothers, and a nurse. Washington University allowed CBC to use the former Smith Academy building for the rest of the academic year. . =Hi-Pointe campus (1922–2003)= For several years, the brothers taught in parochial schools until a new \\"Christian Brothers College High School\\" was built at University Lane and Clayton Road in Clayton's Hi-Pointe neighborhood. The school building was opened in 1922 and enlarged several times over the following decades to accommodate increasing enrollment. CBC was also home to an Army JROTC program. In earlier years, JROTC was mandatory, but it later became a voluntary program, and was disbanded in 1993 due to low enrollment. In 1998, the CBC Board of Directors announced that the school would abandon the city of St. Louis, this time to a new campus in West St. Louis County, eight miles west of the Clayton campus. =2003–present= The current campus is located at the northwest corner at the intersection of I-64 and I-270, close to Missouri Baptist University. The first academic year at the new location was 2003–04. In January 2006, CBC announced plans to begin drug testing all of its students. The school became the first private school in the West St. Louis area to implement such testing, and the proposal received widespread press coverage. CBC started its drug testing program in the 2007–08 academic year.KSDK website Athletics =School mascot= The mascot from the inception of inter-collegiate athletics at CBC until 1916 was the Collegians. The team was known as the Hi- Pointers during the early years on Clayton Road through the 1950s; the name derives from the Hi-Pointe neighborhood in Clayton where CBC was located from 1922–2003. The team was unofficially renamed the Cadets after the students when CBC began mandatory JROTC training in the 1930s. The name became official in 1958 and the Cadets logo was created in 1993 by Jason Buford (class of 1994). =Athletic Grounds= Klemm Field at W. Michael Ross '66 Stadium Prominently viewed off of I-64 on the Town and Country campus is W. Michael Ross Stadium, a 3,000 seat Multi-Purpose stadium hosting Football, Soccer, Lacrosse and Ultimate. Carved into the southern hill of the campus, Ross Stadium is known for its dusk time shadows and sun rays during early season football games. It also prominently features a rock \\"CBC\\" on the grandstand hillside, similar to the University of Missouri \\"M\\". Klemm Field in 2012 became a \\"Championship Field\\". The turf that was used to replace the original surface is from the Mercedes-Benz Superdome and hosted the BCS National Championship and several Bowl Games. Cadet Park CBC's practice fields are called \\"Cadet Park\\"; it has enough room for about 2 football fields. CBC's tennis courts are also here. Mike Shannon Stadium at Cadet Park Mike Shannon Stadium is CBC's baseball stadium. The team began playing games there for 2013. Before, the project began CBC's varsity team played at Missouri Baptist University. =Metro Catholic Conference= CBC is a chartered member of the Metro Catholic Conference (MCC).

Huangshan pines on Mount Lushan, Jiangxi Description Pinus hwangshanensis is an evergreen tree reaching in height, with a very broad, flat-topped crown of long, level branches. The bark is thick, greyish, and scaly plated. The leaves are needle-like, dark green, 2 per fascicle, 5–8 cm long and 0.8–1 mm wide, the persistent fascicle sheath 1 cm long. The cones are broad squat ovoid, 4-6.5 cm long, yellow-brown, opening when mature in late winter to 5–7 cm broad. The seeds are winged, 5–6 mm long with a 1.5-2.5 cm wing. Pollination is in mid spring, with the cones maturing 18–20 months after. It is closely related to Japanese black pine (P. thunbergii), differing from it in the slenderer leaves, brown (not white) buds and broader cones. Huangshan pines typically grow at moderate to high altitudes on steep, rocky crags, and are a major vegetation component in the landscapes of eastern China. Many specimens are venerated for their unique rugged shapes, and are frequently portrayed in traditional Chinese paintings.

The group was formed by Derrick Rahming, and the remainder of the lineup has changed throughout the group's existence.David Jeffries, Afro-Rican biography at AllMusic (accessed 2016-05-25). Member of the group have included Rahming, Juan Arroyo (DJ Slice), and Marcus Rice (MD Rock). History =From We Down Express to The Afro-Rican Connection= Afro-Rican grew out of the open air mobile DJ crew, We Down Express. As the crew We Down Express, they recorded the song \\"Bass Attack\\" for Pandisc Records in 1986, which failed to make much of a mark. Later that year, they rechristened themselves as The Afro-Rican Connection to highlight their bi-racial makeup, possibly as a way to maximize marketability. As The Afro-Rican Connection, they released the single \\"It's Live\\" with \\"Regina\\" as a B-side in 1986. =Early Years and Afro-Rican= By 1987, as uptempo club-bass records increased in popularity in the Miami bass scene, Derrick Rahming began production on his imagining of the genre with his E-mu SP-1200 drum sampler. While uptempo music was not his preferred style, he believed labels would not fund records that sold in meager quantities, and to compete with more successful acts of the time such as 2 Live Crew and Kooley C. The group shortened their name to Afro-Rican, and produced \\"Give it All You Got (Doggy Style)\\", which samples Kraftwerk's \\"It's More Fun to Compute\\" from the Computer World album. The group signed with Edward Meriwether of Suntown Records to release the track. =Label Recognition and Early Albums= With a larger presence in Miami's music scene, Afro-Rican began Hip-Rock Records and commenced production on an album that contained a more traditional hip-hop sound. The success of their single led to a manufacturing and distribution deal with Luke Skyywalker Records in 1989, recording their debut LP \\"Against All Odds\\". However, the sales were less than expected and the deal with Skyywalker Records fell through. In 1991, Afro-Rican attempted to recover with the release of Sex and Fun, an album combining their earlier club-bass style with their more recent traditional hip-hop experience, but the album failed to find its audience. =Car Audio Bass and Power Supply= Struggling to maintain funding, Derrick Rahming recorded from his bedroom, an rarity among his contemporaries of the time. However, with the success of acts such as Techmaster P.E.B. and Bass 305 in the new subgenre of \\"car audio bass\\" created a niche that was still in its infancy circa 1991, and Rahming used the popularity as an opportunity to release a successful album in a growing genre. Creating an entire album of car audio bass in his bedroom led to the creation of his Car Audio alias, Power Supply. Rahming successfully marketed his music at car shows under his own label, Hip-Rock, and Afro-Rican began to receive more widespread attention. =Increased Recognition= In 1995, a new incarnation of Afro-Rican with Derrick Rahming still at the helm and Marcus Rice (MD Rock) contributing, produced another popular hit, \\"All of Puerto Rico\\". Throughout the 1990s, they discovered and employed artists such as 6-1 Dog, Get Some Crew, and DJ KOS. =Recent History= In 2000, Afro-Rican continued to receive attention from a new generation of Florida bass music fans due to a remake of the song \\"Give it All You Got (Doggy Style)\\", by new- school electro bass group Jackal & Hyde which featured new lead vocals performed by Rahming. Afro-Rican also collaborated with Neil Case's Bass Mekanik imprint under the Pandisc Records' umbrella, producing music borrowing from Car Audio Bass, Florida breaks and traditional hip hop styles. \\"Give it All You Got (Doggy Style)\\" was sampled in the song \\"Fergalicious\\" by pop singer Fergie, on her debut solo album, The Dutchess, released in 2006. Present Day Derrick Rahming continues to live and record in South Florida under the aliases \\"Chameleon\\" and 'MARC MYWORD\\". Rahming produces traditional hip-hop as Marc Myword, and his single \\"LIVE FOR THE PAIN\\" was received well by the fans of the genre. Rahming has stated \\"Once you're known for a particular music style its hard to break through with anything other then what you're known for, in this case Miami bass. I remember the reaction of Denzel Washington's fans when he stepped out of the box and played the Bad Guy Alonzo Harris in his academy award winning role in \\"Training Day\\",demonstrating sometimes you have to step out of the box.\\" Currently Rahming is back in the studio recording several rock, dance, and hip-hop tracks for a 5 Track EP titled \\"NEVER BOXED IN\\".

Following his studies in pedagogics, Berge attended the Music Conservatory in Oslo, where he studied with Torleif Eken, after which he studied composition with Finn Mortensen from 1956 to 1960. He continued his music education in Stockholm, Copenhagen and Utrecht, focusing on electronic music. From 1959 till retirement age Berge taught music at the Oslo and Akershus University College. Berge lectured extensively and published a number of text books and articles on music teaching and creative activities in music. Berge also held a number of positions on the Norwegian music scene's organizational circuit, including the chairmanship of the Norwegian Society of Composers. Berge's debut as a composer came with the work Pezzo Orchestrale in Helsinki in 1959. His production encompasses a diversity of styles, including traditional tonal works, twelve-tone-music, exemplified by works Episode (1959) and Sinus (1961), educational works, including music for school bands and recorder ensembles, electronic works, compositions for mixed media, orchestra music for television, chamber music, etc. Berge's interest in Norwegian and other folk music styles is evident in a number of his compositions in which he blended folk music elements together with a thoroughly modern musical language. Examples of Berge's folk music tinged works include Horn Call (1972) and Raga for oboe and orchestra (1960, 1978). He also wrote a number of works to be performed by children and young people, including Illuxit for children's choir (1974) and Juvenes for string orchestra (1976–77). Several of Berge's works were exploratory in nature, featuring experimentation with sonic palettes and tonal qualities by focusing on unconventional orchestral instrumentation. Examples of this compositional focus include the work Chroma (1963), which could be viewed as a study in sound possibilities. Berge's electronic compositions are predominantly short studies in sound, often of a humorous nature, with such titles as The Raindrop Postlude (1968) and Moon Landscape (1971).

The film was written and directed by Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg. The story continues where Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle leaves off, with Harold Lee (John Cho) and Kumar Patel (Kal Penn) flying to Amsterdam, but they are imprisoned after being mistaken for terrorists, and end up on a series of comical misadventures when they escape from Guantanamo Bay detention camp. The film also stars Paula Garcés, (Video) Neil Patrick Harris, Jon Reep, Rob Corddry, Ed Helms, David Krumholtz, Eddie Kaye Thomas, Jack Conley, Roger Bart, Danneel Harris, Eric Winter, Adam Herschman, and Richard Christy. The film was released on April 25, 2008, by Warner Bros.; this film was the first New Line Cinema title to be distributed by Warner Bros. since New Line Cinema became a division of Warner Bros. It is also the first Harold & Kumar film made in association with Mandate Pictures. The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on July 29, 2008. Plot After returning home from White Castle, Harold Lee and Kumar Patel decide to travel to Amsterdam, Netherlands so Harold can surprise his neighbor and newfound girlfriend Maria. At the airport, Kumar argues with a TSA agent for searching him “because of the color of his skin” despite the agent being black. The duo encounter Kumar's ex-girlfriend Vanessa Fanning, who is engaged to Colton Graham, a college friend of Harold's whose family has political connections. The plane passengers mistake Kumar's bong for a bomb and the duo are apprehended by sky marshals. Ron Fox, a neurotic and extremely racist Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security, believes the duo are agents of a joint Al-Qaeda and North Korean conspiracy and send them to Guantanamo Bay detention camp in Cuba. After narrowly avoiding a sexual assault by a guard at the detention camp, Harold and Kumar escape and board a Cuban refugee boat to Miami, Florida where they begin their trek to Texas, hoping Colton can clear their names. Harold and Kumar endure several misadventures on their way to Texas, such as staying at the home of an incestuous sibling couple and their inbred son; escaping a Ku Klux Klan rally; and visiting a brothel with Neil Patrick Harris, who helps them evade capture from Fox but is shot. When they reach Texas, Colton agrees to help exonerate the duo. However, upon seeing Kumar reconnect with Vanessa, Colton instead delivers Harold and Kumar to Fox. On the flight back to Cuba, Harold and Kumar subdue Fox's men. When Fox tries confronting them, he is knocked out by Dr. John Beecher (the Vice Chairman of the NSA) after Fox repeatedly treated him poorly. Dr. Beecher accidentally loses his footing, opens a door and falls to his death. Harold and Kumar escape via parachute, and Fox falls to his death while pursuing them. Harold and Kumar land in President George W. Bush's estate. After smoking cannabis with Harold and Kumar, Bush pardons them. Harold and Kumar are escorted to Vanessa and Colton's wedding by the Secret Service. They then expose Colton's betrayal to Vanessa and the guests. Colton attempts to attack them, but Harold punches him out. Kumar consoles a furious Vanessa by reciting a poem he wrote for her in college; they reconcile. Harold, Kumar, and Vanessa travel to Amsterdam where Harold finds Maria, and the couples happily tour the city together while getting high on cannabis.

Retrieved 21 November 2012. It is considered to be a particularly advanced test of singing ability. Messa di voce should not be confused with mezza voce (Italian, \\"half voice\\") which means to sing at half strength. Technique The messa di voce is universally considered a very advanced vocal technique. To be properly executed, the only feature of the note being sung that should change is the volume – not the pitch, intonation, timbre, vibrato, and so on. This requires an extremely high level of vocal coordination, particularly in the diminuendo, so the technique is not often explicitly called for and is rarely heard outside classical music. History In Western art music, the messa di voce was associated with famous castrati such as Farinelli (and is now a mark of the mezzo-sopranos and countertenors who sing the same roles in Baroque operas). It was also popular in the bel canto period, when it was often used as a dramatic opening flourish for an aria, for example \\"Casta diva\\" from Norma. Another example from a later period is \\"Pace! Pace, mio Dio\\", from Verdi’s \\"La Forza del destino\\". It became less common as the popular style of opera singing evolved from the light and elaborate music of that era to the louder and more speech-like singing of the middle and later 19th century. In the popular music of the West messa di voce has been even less common. It still appears occasionally in some of the more ornate styles of popular music, however, like gospel and other styles influenced by it.The New Harvard Dictionary of Music (1986) References Category:Italian opera terminology ","title":"Messa di voce"},{"id":"3412663","text":"The Osage Fork Gasconade River is a stream in Wright, Webster and Laclede counties in the Ozarks of southern Missouri.

Organization Their job is to report to the local mayor. Many of these officers carry firearms (they commonly face poachers, many of whom are themselves armed) and other weapons. Mayors decide which weapons to provide them with, but gardes champêtres can purchase, retain and carry a much wider range of weapons than the urban police (police municipale) are allowed. They are not under the supervision of the Gendarmerie but under the mayor's, their employer. History and future development From 1791 to 1958 it was compulsory for each rural commune to employ a garde champêtre. Since then many formerly rural communes are heavily or totally urbanised and the number in post has been shrinking every year. A draft law in 2014, provided for the integration of the remaining gardes champêtres with the police municipale and the highway control officers (agents de surveillance de la voie publique) into a new police territoriale.

He enrolled at the University of Buenos Aires and obtained a Law Degree in 1925, but never practiced law, instead working for a time for an English Argentine railway company, and ultimately joining the editorial staff of La Prensa, then the country's second-most circulated daily. His short story, La noche incompleta (The Unfinished Night) was published by La Prensa in 1935, and Peyrou became an editor of the daily's respected literary supplement, eventually becoming the section's chief editor. He contributed to literary critic Victoria Ocampo's Sur, and a close friend from his days at the university, Jorge Luis Borges, later brought him on as chief film critic for Los Anales de Buenos Aires, Borges' literary review. La espada dormida (The Sleeping Sword), Peyrou's 1944 pulp fiction work, was followed by a satire, El estruendo de las rosas, in 1948, which earned him a Municipal Literary Prize; Peyrou's later works departed from the detective genre and were mainly realist narratives. A number, including Las leyes del juego (The Rules of the Game, 1959), El árbol de Judas (The Judas Tree, 1963), Marea de fervor (Tide of Fervor, 1967), and El hijo rechazado (The Rejected Son, 1969), were also acclaimed by critics. His short stories were published by Selecciónes (the Spanish-language edition of Reader's Digest) and by Greek publisher George Humuziadis, among others.

The citizen would never take part in a discussion because he/she believes that his/her views and perspectives wouldn't be given equal time or consideration, when compared to dominant views. In other words, the (often realistic) fear of being excluded, discounted, or dismissed causes a person to decline an opportunity to attend a public event. Calling this \\"exclusion\\" implies that the individual's personal decision not to participate actually reflects a larger historical pattern of active exclusion toward similar individuals. Causes Anticipatory exclusion is often caused by internal exclusion, which is the way certain dominant ideas and social perspectives can control a discussion even when participants have diverse perspectives (Fung 2004, p. 49). In contrast, external exclusion refers to the fact that minority viewpoints are rarely heard due to structural inequalities in a community (Fung, 2004). Background It is generally associated with Dahl's criteria for a democratic process, inclusion and effective participation, which many political theorists consider essential for a participatory or deliberative democracy (Dahl, 1989). Many democratic theorists attempt to solve the challenge of anticipatory and other types of exclusion through formal equalization mechanisms, including structural and economic reforms that would guarantee all citizens have adequate time, education, and resources to deliberate (Sanders 1997, p. 7). But even when these inequalities are adjusted for Sanders argues that deliberative institutions might cater to and perpetuate inequalities against historically disenfranchised groups (e.g., women, minorities) (see also, Schattan, Coelho, Pozzoni, Montoya 2005).

Among Oolite's several similarities to its source, the gaming experience is enhanced by the context set in Elite's original manual, and the accompanying novella, The Dark Wheel. Oolite is licensed under GNU GPL version 2 for the source code and Creative Commons CC-BY-NC-SA for other resources (pictures, music, textures, models).  History  Giles Williams began work on Oolite for Mac OS X in 2003. In July 2004, Oolite v1.0 was released but remained in active development for a long time afterwards. By September 2005, Mac Oolite had reached v1.52, and a Linux port was released, closely following the Mac OS X developments since. In March 2006, the Windows GNUstep port was released. Ports are also available for SGI IRIX and FreeBSD on Intel architectures. Most ports include the same functionality except for the Mac OS X version which includes additional support of native Mac OS X features (such as integration with iTunes, Spotlight and Growl support). In October 2006, after releasing the stable 1.65 version, Williams announced he would stop developing Oolite after implementing updated OpenGL shader functionality. However, the project stalled. On 27 February 2007, the project was relicensed under the GPL, Jens Ayton was nominated as maintainer, and after a lag, active development continued by the community. Subsequently, there were a number of test releases, with most notably the addition of JavaScripting capabilities to write missions and shader support. On 16 December 2011, a new stable version, v1.76, to replace 2006's v1.65, was released. On 27 May 2012, a new stable version, v1.76.1, was released. This is a bug-fix update to Oolite 1.76. It does not add new features. On 16 August 2012, a trial deployment version of v1.76.1 was released. The purpose of the release is to evaluate Oolite's Deployment configuration, which is the way upcoming stable releases are expected to be made. On 8 January 2013, a new test deployment version, v1.77, was released. This version comes with new features and improvements over previous releases. On 1 October 2013 a new test deployment version, v1.77.1 was released. This is a bug-fix update to Oolite 1.77. It does not add new features. On 30 June 2014 a new stable version, v1.80 was released, to replace 2012's v1.76.1. It adds many new features, including greatly improved AI, an updated core shipset and an Expansion Pack management system. On 27 May 2015 a new stable version, v1.82 was released. AI and the Expansion Pack Management System were further improved, and combat reworked to make the early game a bit easier for beginners, while still allowing plenty of challenges in the later game. Graphics and interfaces were upgraded, with the main improvement being the fully zoomable and scrollable galaxy map, which replaces the separate short-range and long-range charts. Improvements were made to multi-monitor support, explosion graphics, and planet textures, and a \\"field of view\\" setting introduced to Game Options. A Scenario Support System was introduced, essentially allowing people to rewrite the galaxies, ships, equipment and rules to make their own new space game using the Oolite engine. On 21 July 2016, version 1.84 was released. The main additions are listed as : Mobile external view camera, multiple lasers now available to all ships, improvements to the Galactic Chart interface, improvements to overall presentation and UI. On 25 October 2017, version 1.86 was released. It features a new terrain generation algorithm for more realistic looking land sections, adds cloud layers and adjusts ambient lighting for an overall more aesthetically pleasing result. The maximum resolution the game can support has been increased to 8K UHD levels. Other additions are high-DPI support on Windows, the ability to load expansion packs over HTTPS, the ability to use the mouse wheel for speed control when piloting ships using a mouse (Windows / Linux), and an Easy Start scenario for commanders who struggle to get their Lave-based MkIII combat- ready. On 28 October 2018, version 1.88 was released. It features a significantly revamped graphics and lighting system. Modern lighting techniques have been deployed, applying physically accurate and energy conserving models for specular reflections on both ships and planets. Visual effect entities can now utilize transparency while the planet atmospheres have received an eye-catching makeover as well. This fusion of physically based rendering techniques and effects produces spectacular Oolite visuals that have never looked better. The new lighting system also works in favor of Oolite's materials system, enabling the creation and usage of materials not possible before. On 30 August 2020, version 1.90 was released. It features a much improved graphics environment, with special attention paid to planets. Atmosphere appearance on planets is now configurable and custom planets now support normal, gloss and illumination maps. Further graphics improvements include filmic tone mapping, Oren-Nayar diffuse light model, increased light source radiance for better visibility of objects in space and more. Additionally, weapons now have individual sounds assigned to them, while scripts have even more properties available for access. This version is the one currently recommended by the Oolite dev team.  Gameplay  Oolite's default HUD =Basics= Like Elite, Oolite is a first-person, open-ended, single-player space trading and combat simulator. The player is the pilot of a spacecraft, capable of interstellar travel to other nearby planetary systems using wormholes generated by the ship's engines. Each system contains only one inhabited planet, with an orbiting space station; players choose the destination system by the name of its planet. Although players can create outgoing wormholes almost anywhere within a system, assuming their engines have sufficient fuel to do so, ships always enter a new system at a considerable distance from the target planet. The player must then pilot their ship from the entry point, through \\"normal\\" space, to the station. During this stage of the journey the player can encounter other ships, and combat can occur. Oolite spaceships' principal armaments are lasers and missiles. Most combats are dogfights and the ships exhibit non-Newtonian flight characteristics, being immune from the effects of inertia and gravity. Galactic trade map of Oolite. =Goals and objectives= There is no set goal or objective in the game. Money and \\"Elite rating\\" are the only built-in forms of \\"score\\" in Oolite. Players can earn money by buying goods in one star system and transporting them to another to sell at a profit. Money can also be earned by destroying pirate ships and collecting bounty. Players can become pirates themselves, attacking merchantmen and other ships. Although no bounty is awarded for destroying non-pirate ships, when a ship is destroyed, some of its cargo can survive the explosion. If the player's ship is equipped with a scoop, this cargo can be salvaged for later resale. It is also possible, with the right equipment, to mine asteroids for ores and other materials. Players can also select to carry paying passengers or special cargos to specified destinations. Money earned or otherwise acquired can be spent on fuel for the wormhole engines (known as \\"Witchdrives\\"), ship maintenance and new equipment. The player can also seek to trade in his or her ship for other models with different characteristics and capabilities. Each ship the player destroys, of any type or class, adds to the player's \\"Elite rating\\", a ranking based on the number of kills made. This rating begins at \\"harmless\\" (no kills), then \\"mostly harmless\\", and culminates with the \\"deadly\\" then \\"elite\\" rankings. A large ship preparing to dock at a Coriolis station =Missions and modifications= There are a small number of built-in missions in the game, inherited from Elite, where the player is given specific tasks to perform, such as destroying a stolen military prototype fighter. It is not necessary to complete or even begin any of these missions to play the game, however. Numerous modifications for Oolite have expanded the gameplay by adding in new missions, equipment, ships, space stations, trading locations and open-ended career opportunities such as courier or hitman. Others offer improved graphics, visual and audio effects, or otherwise improve ambience. These modifications are usually called OXPs (Oolite eXpansion Pack). Currently, there are more than 500 OXPs available for Oolite.  Modding  Since the game structure is intended to be ‘open–hooded’, objects and events that take place in Oolite are easily modified without need of programming skills. Only a few simple tools are needed to create an OXP. These game additions, either self-made or downloaded, are freely placed in the game's AddOns folder, allowing the player to shape the plot and population of the game universe.faximile In recent versions, the game comes with a built-in extension manager allowing the player to browse, install, update or remove extensions by simply going through the available extensions list. This greatly simplifies the process of installing extensions and keeping them updated. Over Oolite's first two years, many from the Oolite community were inspired by the game's coherent modding opportunities, resulting in a fairly large pool of OXPs. Often The Dark Wheel and 80's Elite fandom are of obvious influence, although elements from alternate space operas have also been shared. A pack may simply offer more ships or stations, or contain scripted interactive missions. As adding planetary bodies, minigames, HUDs, weapons and sounds are among several possibilities, testing the potential limitations of the OXP is still at an early stage. Below are some examples of OXPs: Image:Oolite-cobra4 and Additional Planets.pngCobra Mk. IV OXP and Additional Planets SR OXP Image:Oolite-cobra4.pngCobra Mk.

If you’re starving for a good space simulator, Oolite will satisfy. With a more rewarding trade system than its contemporaries, fast paced combat, and a healthy dose of retro appeal, this is worth checking out.\\" NAG Online reviewed Oolite in September 2010, giving it a score of 85%: \\"A true classic reincarnated and reimagined: a must-play for space-sim fans.\\" See also * List of open source games References  External links  * * Official wiki * Official forums Category:2004 video games Category:Creative Commons-licensed video games Category:Free software programmed in Objective-C Category:Free software that uses SDL Category:Freeware games Category:IRIX games Category:Linux games Category:MacOS games Category:Open-source video games Category:Science fiction video games Category:Space trading and combat simulators Category:Space flight simulator games Category:Video game remakes Category:Windows games ","title":"Oolite (video game)"},{"id":"3412685","text":"Major (Maj) is a military rank which is used by both the British Army and Royal Marines. The rank is superior to captain, and subordinate to lieutenant colonel. The insignia for a major is a crown. The equivalent rank in the Royal Navy is lieutenant commander, and squadron leader in the Royal Air Force. History By the time of the Napoleonic wars, an infantry battalion usually had two majors, designated the \\"senior major\\" and the \\"junior major\\". The senior major effectively acted as second-in-command and the majors often commanded detachments of two or more companies split from the main body. The second-in-command of a battalion or regiment is still a major.

This practice was frowned on outside the trenches but was given official sanction in 1917 as an alternative, being made permanent in 1920 when the cuff badges were abolished. From 1 April 1918 to 31 July 1919, the Royal Air Force maintained the rank of major. It was superseded by the rank of squadron leader on the following day. By World War I, majors were often commanding independent companies, squadrons and batteries, but those that were organically part of a regiment or battalion were still usually commanded by captains. After World War II, major became the usual rank held by officers commanding all companies, squadrons and batteries. In the 21st century British Army, officers normally attain the rank after around eight to 10 years of commissioned service. A common job for a major is the command of a sub-unit of 120 or fewer junior officers and soldiers.

Pavlović was twice nominated for the Nobel Literature Prize. Biography He graduated from the University of Belgrade with a degree in medicine in year 1954. He studied foreign languages and wrote his first volume of poetry, 87 Poems. It appeared in 1952, the year the Yugoslav authorities, responding to a public address by the Croatian writer Miroslav Krleža, allowed more freedom of expression in politics and the arts. In 1960 Pavlović was appointed director of drama at the National Theatre in Belgrade. He also worked for twenty years as editor for the leading publishing house of Prosveta. A theme occupying Pavlović and many other intellectuals in the former Yugoslavia, Romania, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Greece and Albania, is the continuity between the ancient peoples of the Balkans and their modern-day descendants. In Pavlović's work as well as in that of the Macedonian poet Bogomil Gyuzel or the Albanian writer Ismail Kadare, there are frequent references to the ancient and medieval past. Among his historical poems, most important ones are 'Odisej na Kirkinom ostrvu' ('Odysseus on Circe's Island'), 'Eleuzijske seni' ('Elysian Shades'), 'Vasilije II Bugaroubica' ('Vasily II Bugaroctone') and 'Kosovo'. These poems are often allegorical in nature, referring in fact to our own times, with their tales of manipulation, deceit and, especially, fear. Written directly in the present are such poems as 'Prisoner' (untitled in the Serbian original), 'Requiem', 'Strah' ('Fear'), 'Pod zemljom' ('Under the Ground') and 'Kavge' ('Feuds'). In 2012 he was awarded the German literary prize Petrarca-Preis. His work has been widely translated. In the last years of his life, he lived alternately in Tuttlingen, Germany and Belgrade, Serbia. A street in Belgrade is name after him.

U.S. Marine Corps Major insignia. U.S. Air Force and U.S. Space Force Major insignia. In the United States Army, Marine Corps, and Air Force, major is a field grade military officer rank above the rank of captain and below the rank of lieutenant colonel. It is equivalent to the naval rank of lieutenant commander in the other uniformed services. Although lieutenant commanders are considered junior officers by their respective services (Navy and Coast Guard), the rank of major is that of a senior officer in the United States Army, the United States Marine Corps, and the United States Air Force. The pay grade for the rank of major is O-4. The insignia for the rank consists of a golden oak leaf, with slight stylized differences between the Army/Air Force version and the Marine Corps version. Promotion to major is governed by the Department of Defense policies derived from the Defense Officer Personnel Management Act of 1980.  Army  A major in the U.S. Army typically serves as a battalion executive officer (XO) or as the battalion operations officer (S3). Majors can also serve as Company Commanding Officers, a major can also serve as a primary staff officer for a regiment, brigade or task force in the areas concerning personnel, logistics, intelligence, and operations. A major will also be a staff officer / action officer on higher staffs and headquarters. In addition, majors command augmented companies in Combat Service and Service Support units. U.S. Army majors also command Special operations companies, such as U.S. Army Special Forces companies, Civil Affairs companies, Military Information Support Operations companies, and certain types of separate, numbered vice lettered, Military Intelligence companies. Selected majors in the United States Army attend the 10-month Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, with a greater number attending satellite schools administered by Fort Leavenworth at Fort Belvoir, Fort Lee, Virginia, Redstone Arsenal, and Fort Gordon. Nine- hundred-sixty graduated from the Leavenworth course in 2009 (the largest class in Army history). = American Revolution = The Continental Army mostly followed the organization and rank structure of the British Army. A regiment consisted of 8 companies with three officers (a captain, a lieutenant and ensign) and about 60 enlisted men each. The field grade officers of a regiment were the colonel, the lieutenant colonel and a major. The major was the regiment's third in command and, at least in theory, would command one of the regiment's two battalions if the regiment were divided for tactical purposes. = American Civil War = During the American Civil War the Union Army continued to use the existing titles of rank and rank insignia established for the US Army. After the Southern states seceded and became the Confederate States of America, the Confederate Army retained the same titles of rank as its Union counterpart, but developed a new system of rank identification and insignia for its officers. While Union officers continued to wear their rank insignia on their shoulder straps, Confederate officers wore their rank insignia on the collar (one, two, or three horizontal gold bars for lieutenants and captains; one, two, or three gold stars for field grade officers; and three gold stars surrounded by a wreath for all general officers), as well as rows of gold lace forming an Austrian knot pattern on each sleeve. The number of rows of gold lace increased with the rank of the officer. Confederate Army Major insignia 80px = Post-Civil War = In the late 1800s the US Army changed from the traditional 10 company regiment to one of 12 companies organized into three four-company battalions, each commanded by a major. Prior to World War II, battalion commanders became lieutenant colonels. The basic regimental organization remained standard until after the Korean War when regiments with organic battalions were no longer used as tactical units. Battalions attached to brigades replaced the regiment. Battalions commanded by lieutenant colonels became the US Army's basic tactical unit. As a result, there were only a limited number of command positions for majors although Medical, Special Forces and Aviation companies are usually commanded by majors.  Air Force  A major in the Air Force typically has duties as a senior staff officer at the squadron and wing level. In flying squadrons majors are generally flight commanders or assistant directors of operations. In the mission support and maintenance groups majors may occasionally be squadron commanders. In the medical corps, a major may be the head of a clinic or flight.

He was ranked number one on the list of history's 50 greatest weightlifters issued by the International Weightlifting Federation, until Turkey's Naim Süleymanoğlu surpassed the Egyptian to top the list at the 1996 Games in Atlanta. Eltouny began practicing the sport at a young age along with the students of Shobra School. One day, they placed two stones weighing 40 kg each on a broomstick; only Eltouny succeeded in lifting it. Determined to succeed in this area, Eltouny continued to weightlift at various sporting clubs in the Cairo area. By 1936, Eltouny had set a world record for his class so inconceivable, that the International Weightlifting Federation refused to acknowledge it, citing it was an impossible feat.  1936 Olympics  Eltouny was one of the sensations of the 1936 Olympics. At the time, Eltouny had already set the world record for his weight class. The International Weightlifting Federation, however, did not recognize this as a world record, causing much controversy and anticipation. Many felt that no man could lift such remarkable numbers, while others were excited at the chance to view this human miracle. At the 1936 Olympics, in front of a global audience, Eltouny did not disappoint, as he proved his reported numbers to be accurate, shattering 3 previous Olympic and World records on his way to the gold medal. Eltouny crushed two German world champions at the time on their home soil, who had been widely advertised by Hitler as the stars of the sport. His performance is considered one of the greatest upsets in Olympic history.Khedr Eltouny - A Portrait After winning the middleweight class gold medal,Weightlifting At The 1936 Summer Olympics Eltouny continued to compete for another 45 minutes, finally exceeding the total of the German silver medalist by 35 kg. The 20-year-old Eltouny lifted a total of 387.5 kg, while the German lifted 352.5 kg. Not only had Eltouny lifted more than his middleweight competition, but he actually finished having lifted 15 kg more than the light-heavyweight gold medalist; a feat only Eltouny has accomplished till this day. Eltouny's new world records stood for an unprecedented thirteen years.10 Transcendent Olympic Moments Fascinated by Eltouny's performance, Adolf Hitler, who was watching from the stands, rushed down to greet this human miracle. Prior to the competition, Hitler was said to have been sure that Rudolf Ismayr and Adolf Wagner would embarrass all other opponents. While awarding Eltouny with the gold medal, Hitler told him: \\"Egypt should be proud of you. I wish you were German. I hope you consider Germany your second home\\". Hitler was so impressed by his domination in the middleweight class that he ordered a street named after him in Berlin.Hitler honors Eltouny Upon returning to Egypt, Eltouny received a 1,000 L.E. cash bonus, as well as a free pass from the tramway company. Eltouny cashed in the policy in 1953 and built a house in Helwan, which is still occupied by the Eltouny family.Al Ahram  1948 Olympics  Eltouny could have taken part in the 1940 and 1944 Olympics, but World War II put an end to those dreams. Finally in 1948, when the games resumed in London, Eltouny was able to compete again. Eltouny fell ill the night before the games, and would require surgery. Doctors ordered Eltouny not to compete, but frustrated about missing the prior two Olympic Games, Eltouny refused to follow doctors' orders. Well past his prime at the age of 32, and in terrible pain, Eltouny attempted to win a medal once again. Unfortunately, Eltouny failed to win a medal this time. Although he tied for third place, he lost the bronze medal on tiebreak. Nevertheless, Eltouny won the hearts of the Egyptian people with his determination. Immediately after the competition, Eltouny was rushed to a nearby hospital for surgery.Khedr Eltouny - A PortraitOfficial 1936 Olympics signature book 1936 Olympics book Death and legacy Eltouny died in 1956 by electrical shock while making a home repair in Helwan. His performance in 1936 is considered by many to have produced Egypt's most significant gold medal, and his legacy can be felt in various cities. In recognition of his achievements in 1936, Hitler ordered one of the streets in the Olympic Village of Berlin to be named after him. In addition to Berlin, Nasr City in Cairo and the Sporting neighborhood of Alexandria have streets carrying his name. In the 1990s, nearby his final residential town of Helwan, a major square was also named in his honor.Khedr El-Touny square Helwan Today, he is considered by many to be the greatest athlete in the history of Egyptian sports, having recorded a total of 16 world records, an Olympic gold medal, and 3 world titles (1946, 1949, 1950).Sports Reference Khadr El Touni  See also  * List of Egyptians  References  Category:1916 births Category:1956 deaths Category:Egyptian male weightlifters Category:Olympic weightlifters of Egypt Category:Weightlifters at the 1936 Summer Olympics Category:Weightlifters at the 1948 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic gold medalists for Egypt Category:Accidental deaths in Egypt Category:Accidental deaths by electrocution Category:Olympic medalists in weightlifting Category:Medalists at the 1936 Summer Olympics Category:Sportspeople from Cairo ","title":"Khadr El-Touni"},{"id":"3412720","text":"Michael S.

It is nonmigratory and found in arid desert areas year-round. Taxonomy The black-tailed gnatcatcher was described by American ornithologist George Newbold Lawrence in 1857. Meaning 'black-tailed', its specific name is derived from the Ancient Greek melano- 'black' and oura 'tail'. Description The black-tailed gnatcatcher reaches about 4.5 to 5 inches in length, much of it taken up by a long black tail lined with white outer feathers. The body is blue-grey, with white underparts, and while it is similar to the blue-grey gnatcatcher, the two birds are differentiated by the amount of black in the tail feathers. The male has a black cap during the summer that extends to the eyes. Females and winter males, lacking the black cap, are difficult to distinguish from the blue-grey gnatcatcher. The best way to tell the two apart is the tail; that of the blue- grey is mostly white when viewed from below, and the black-tailed is predominantly black underneath. Like other gnatcatchers, it may give harsh, scolding calls while foraging for small insects and spiders in desert shrubs. Behaviour Black-tailed gnatcatchers live in pairs all year, defending their territory and foraging in trees and low shrubs for a wide variety of small insects and some spiders. Unlike the blue-grey gnatcatcher, the black- tailed variety rarely catches insects in midair. =Breeding= The nest is an open-cup, built by both sexes, and is typically found in low shrubs less than five feet off the ground. If available at the nesting site, desert mistletoe, Phoradendron californicum, is often used as the substrate for the nest, which provides nice concealment. It is constructed of a variety of materials including weeds, grass, strips of bark, spider webs and plant fibers. It is lined with finer, softer matter. Three to five bluish-white eggs with red- brown dots are incubated by both parents and take 14 days to hatch. The young are fed by both parents, and leave the nest 10 to 15 days after hatching. Even though cowbirds often lay eggs in this species' nests, and the pair end up raising cowbird young, the black-tailed gnatcatcher population seems to be holding up well.

Biography Johann Faber, the son of a blacksmith, was born in Leutkirch, Swabia and studied theology and canon law at Tübingen and Freiburg in the Breisgau region and was made doctor of sacred theology in Freiburg. He eventually became minister of Lindau, Vicar-General of Constance in 1517, Chaplain and confessor to King Ferdinand I of Austria in 1524, and Bishop of Vienna in 1530. Like others of his time Faber was at first friendly with the Reformers, Melanchthon, Zwingli, and Oecolampadius, sympathizing with their efforts at reform and opposing certain abuses himself; but when he realized that neither dogma nor the Church itself was spared by the Reformers, he broke with them and became their most consistent opponent. While a canon of the cathedral of Basle Johann Faber formed a friendship with Erasmus that lasted throughout their lives; it was Erasmus who persuaded Faber to take up the study of the Fathers. Faber wrote his first polemic against Martin Luther, Opus adversus nova quaedam dogmata Martini Lutheri in 1522. This was soon followed by his Malleus Haereticorum, sex libris ad Hadrianum VI summum Pontificem published in Cologne, in 1524, and Rome in 1569. It is because of this latter work that he is sometimes called the \\"hammer of heretics\\". He entered into public debate with Zwingli at Zurich - First Zurich Disputation, Jan. 1523 - and was a prominent figure in all the diets held to restore peace to the Church; as well as being one of the committee appointed to draw up a refutation of the Confession of Augsburg. On some points, such as the celibacy of the clergy, he was willing to recognize certain unfortunate conditions if an agreement could be reached to prevent similar conditions in the future, but no agreement was possible. He was sent by Ferdinand to Spain and then to Henry VIII in England to seek aid against the invading Turks; King Ferdinand also had him enlist the services of the University of Vienna to help combat the spread of the doctrines of Luther in Austria. As Bishop of Vienna his zeal was unbounded; he protected his flock by frequent preaching and numerous writings, and he held regular conferences with his clergy. He founded twelve scholarships for boys who wished to become priests but did not have the means to realize their ambition. He died in Vienna, 21 May 1541. = Writer = Johann Faber works (German and Latin) are homiletical and polemical in character. Besides those already mentioned he wrote treatises on faith and good works, on the Sacrifice of the Mass; an instruction and answer to Luther's work against the King of England; a treatise against the more recent tenets of Luther; a comparison of the writings of Jan Hus and Luther; the power of the pope in the case of Luther; an answer to six articles of Zwingli; defence of Catholic belief against the chief Anabaptist, Balthasar Hubmaier; a book on the religion of the Russians; sermons on the misery of life and on the Blessed Sacrament; as well as sermons of consolation and courage whilst the Turks were besieging Vienna. His works in three folio volumes (Cologne, 1537–40) do not contain his polemical writings; these are found in \\"Opuscula quaedam Joannis Fabri, Episcopi Viennensis published in Leipzig, 1537.

He was born in Siverek, Şanlıurfa Province, Turkey. Although the Kurdish language was outlawed in Turkey from 1920 to 1990, he started to write in his mother tongue. As a writer, he achieved a great deal towards shaping a modern Kurdish literary language and reviving the Kurdish tradition of storytelling. From 1977 to 2005 he lived in exile in Sweden as a political refugee. During his time in Scandinavia, he became a prolific writer, author of a dozen Kurdish language novels and essays, which have made him a founding member of modern Kurdish literature in Kurmanji dialect. In June 2005 he returned to Istanbul, Turkey. He was a member of the PEN club and the Swedish writers association. On May 29, 2006, it was revealed that Uzun had been diagnosed with stomach cancer.Kurdish media -Famous novelist Mehmed Uzun has cancer Following treatment at the Karolinska University Hospital of Stockholm, in Sweden he returned to Diyarbakir, Turkey, where he died, aged 54. Works He published seven novels in Kurdish. Uzun published his first attempt at a modern Kurdish novel in 1985, Tu (You). After that he edited an anthology of Kurdish literature, the first of its kind. Critical success came with his novel \\"In the Shadow of a Lost Love\\" (Siya Evînê). The story fictionalizes a 1920s Kurdish intellectual's failed struggle to pursue both his love for a woman and his duty to fight the newly formed Turkish republic. His novels began to be translated into European languages in the 1990s. Two of his books have been published in Swedish: a collection of essays, Granatäppelblomning (The Pomegranate Flowers), and the novel I skuggan av en förlorad kärlek (In the Shadow of a Lost Love). In collaboration with Madeleine Grive, he has also published an international anthology, Världen i Sverige (The World in Sweden), a pioneering anthology of texts by writers who were not born in Sweden, but who are living and writing there. He also publishes in the journal of the Kurdish Institute of Paris, Kurmancî. He won the Torgny Segerstedt Award for 2001 for his work in a narrative tradition. Conflict with the Turkish state Mehmed Uzun was charged several times in Turkey due to his activities in the field of Kurdish literature . He was arrested on March 21, 1976 as managing editor of a Kurdish-Turkish magazine, and was accused of \\"separatism\\" and jailed in Ankara's central prison. During his trial in the summer of 1976, he attempted to prove the existence of the Kurds and the Kurdish language. The prosecutor's argument was that the Kurds and their language had no form of existence. Anyone claiming the opposite was considered a separatist and deserved to be punished. He was sentenced to eight months in prison. After release, he was still under the threat of indictment on account of his responsibilities as editor of the aforementioned magazine, and consequently he chose exile and left for Sweden in 1977. The regulations prevailing in Turkey at the time made return to his native country impossible. Subsequently, in 1981, by decision of the military regime and like many other Turkish and Kurdish intellectuals, he was stripped of his nationality. He resumed his linguistic quest in Stockholm, aided by grants from the Swedish government. To collect vocabulary and folklore, he visited an Iraqi Kurdish leader in a rebel-held mountain valley of Iraq, spending evenings in a tent listening to Kurdish poets and storytellers by the light of an oil lamp. He learned Arabic script to read classical Kurdish poems of the 16th and 17th centuries. Later, he hunted down rare copies of a magazine published by Kurdish exiles in the 1920s. The ill-fated adventures of these pioneers form the backbone of two of his novels, which, like all of his fiction, detail the struggles of Kurds through the ages. He also led an editorial board of intellectuals, who would pay for Kurds to fly to Europe to brief them on obscure vocabulary. When after many years of living in exile, he went back to Turkey to give a speech about Kurdish literature, seven of his books, six in Kurdish and one in Turkish, were suppressed by Judgment no. 2000/39 of the Fourth Court for State Security of Diyarbakır, dated February 4, 2000.

History The Russian Tea Room was opened in 1927, by former members of the Russian Imperial Ballet, as a gathering place for Russian expatriates and became famous as a gathering place for those in the entertainment industry. The founder is often considered to be Polish-born Jacob Zysman, but in that year, a corporation directory lists Albertina Rasch as the president, and her name appears along with Russian Art Chocolate and Russian Tea Room, in early photographs of the shopfront at 145 W. 57th St. In 1929, the business moved across the street to its present location, which at that time was an Italianate brownstone, built in 1875 by German immigrant John F. Pupke, a tea and coffee merchant, whose son later moved the large clan to Long Island, seeking a more relaxed lifestyle. By 1933, the Siberian émigré Alexander Maeef was running the Russian Tea Room and was the main personality associated with the restaurant for the next fifteen years. In 1955, the restaurant was purchased by Sidney Kaye, who, in 1967, left the restaurant to his widow, Faith Stewart-Gordon. Facade of the Russian Tea Room. In 1981, Harry B. Macklowe, the developer of the Metropolitan Tower, planned a large office tower that would have included not only his own site at the Metropolitan Tower, but also the restaurant's and the lot on which Carnegie Hall Tower was erected. There was an agreement with Carnegie Hall about their lot, but Stewart-Gordon, who owned the lot dividing the project, refused to sell. Macklowe also offered to buy the air rights only and to give room for her restaurant inside the new tower building, but Stewart-Gordon declined. No matter what she was offered, Stewart-Gordon refused to sell the lot. During the planning of the Carnegie Hall Tower at 152 W. 57th St., on the other side of the Russian Tea Room, again Stewart-Gordon declined to sell its site or its air rights. The result is the narrow twenty-foot gap, separating the Metropolitan and Carnegie Hall towers. In December 1996, Warner LeRoy, who owned Tavern on the Green, bought the restaurant from Stewart-Gordon for $6.5 million and closed it down, much to the despair of New York high society. After four years and $36 million in renovations, it reopened, but it was never the same; it closed with little notice on Sunday, July 28, 2002, after declaring bankruptcy. LeRoy's health was failing. Also, the local economy did not recover quickly enough to make payments on the substantial loans for the renovations. After Warner LeRoy died in 2001, his estate sold the property for $16 million to the United States Golf Association in December 2002. The Association had planned to reconfigure the property as a dining room and museum in which to showcase its extensive collection of golf memorabilia, but instead sold the building in 2004 to Sheila Vanderbilt's RTR Funding Group. The 20-foot-wide building extends from 57th Street (the restaurant's main entrance) to 56th Street. The plans are to replace some of the current building facing 56th Street with a 29-story condominium, which is to be designed by Costas Kondylis. The original restaurant will be kept undisturbed. The Russian Tea Room reopened on November 1, 2006. The restaurant's interior has not been touched, and the over-the-top decor is the same as when it closed in 2002. However, several restaurant reviews have noted that the food and service leave significant room for improvement.

The rank is superior to major, and subordinate to colonel. The comparable Royal Navy rank is commander, and the comparable rank in the Royal Air Force and many Commonwealth air forces is wing commander. The rank insignia in the British Army and Royal Marines, as well as many Commonwealth countries, is a crown above a 4 pointed \\"Bath\\" star, also colloquially referred to as a \\"pip\\". The crown has varied in the past with different monarchs; the current one being the Crown of St Edward. Most other Commonwealth countries use the same insignia, or with the state emblem replacing the crown. In the modern British Armed forces, the established commander of a regiment or battalion is a lieutenant colonel. From 1 April 1918 to 31 July 1919, the Royal Air Force maintained the rank of lieutenant colonel. It was superseded by the rank of wing commander on the following day.

He was the son of Charles Leonard Wilcock and Ida Romegialli. He adopted a son, Livio Bacchi Wilcock, who translated Jorge Luis Borges' work into Italian. Early life Wilcock was born in Buenos Aires, the capital and chief metropolis of Argentina, to an English father and an Argentine mother. He studied at the Universidad de Buenos Aires, from which he was graduated as a civil engineer in 1943. That same year, he began work for a railroad company then expanding into western Argentina; the experience would be short-lived, as Wilcock resigned a year later. Wilcock's first known literary work and accomplishment came in 1940 with the Libro de poemas y canciones (\\"Book of Poems and Songs\\"), which earned the Martín Fierro prize of the Argentine Society of Writers (SADE). The same work would also win the prestigious Municipal Award of Literature given by the City of Buenos Aires. Soon Wilcock would see himself surrounded by some of the most prominent writer-intellectuals of the time, like Jorge Luis Borges, Silvina Ocampo, and Adolfo Bioy Casares, perhaps the most influential of the many acquaintances he befriended. Wilcock would later refer to these three as a constellation and the Trinity, who helped him rise from what he called a \\"grey existence\\". In 1945, Wilcock undertook the self-publication of two collections of poetry, Ensayos de poesía lírica (\\"Essays in Lyric Poetry\\") and Persecución de las musas menores (\\"Persecution of the Lesser Muses\\"). The following year, he would again receive the prize of the SADE, this time for his Paseo Sentimental (\\"Sentimental Walk\\"); in that same year, Wilcock published his Los hermosos días (\\"The Beautiful Days\\"). Travels and tribulations At the time, General Juan Peron's regime was suffocating intellectual life in Argentina; as World War II was over in Europe, many chose to relocate to the newly liberated capitals of the old world. In 1951 Wilcock left Argentina for the first time in a visit to Italy. He traveled in the company of Ocampo and Bioy Casares. Life as an Italian writer By 1953, Wilcock was residing in London, earning a living as a translator and a commentator for the BBC. After a short return to Buenos Aires the next year at the age of 34, he set sail for Italy, where he settled permanently three years later. From then on, most of his works, some of his most celebrated, would be written in Italian, a language he learned while living near Rome. During those years he wrote a letter to his friend Miguel Murmis in which he stated, \\"I see Argentina as an immense translation\\". In 1975, Wilcock requested Italian citizenship; it was finally granted him a year after his death. Juan Rodolfo Wilcock died in his country cottage in Lubriano, Province of Viterbo, north of Rome, in March 1978. His remains were buried in the Protestant Cemetery, Rome, near the Porta San Paolo, beside the Pyramid of Cestius.

Born in the USA in Bergen, New Jersey, he attended Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, where he lived for the rest of his life. From 1915 until his retirement in 1930 he was a teacher at the University School for Boys in Baltimore. He published a number of historical novels, including The Unwilling Vestal (1918), Andivius Hedulio (1921) and Helen (1926), but he is best remembered for fantasy horror stories such as \\"The House of the Nightmare\\" and \\"Lukundoo\\" that were based on his own nightmares. Two collections of his short fiction were published in his lifetime, The Song of the Sirens (1919) and Lukundoo and Other Stories (1927). \\"Lukundoo\\", White's most frequently anthologized story, is the tale of an American explorer in a remote section of Africa who incurs the wrath of the local witch doctor, who casts a spell on him. Hundreds of sore pustules erupt all over the explorer's body. As these develop, it becomes clear that each sore is actually a sort of homunculus: a tiny African man, emerging head-first from within the explorer's flesh. He is able to terminate the development of individual homunculi by beheading them as they develop, but there are too many for him to defeat them all – and some of them are on portions of his back which he cannot reach. The explorer's only option is suicide. Two posthumous collections of his fiction have been published by Midnight House: The House of the Nightmare (12547ac) edited by John Pelan and Sesta and Other Strange Stories (2001) edited by Lee Weinstein. at www.leeweinstein.net The latter contains mostly previously unpublished and uncollected material. During 1885 White began a utopian science fiction novel, Plus Ultra. He destroyed the first draft and started over in 1901, then worked on it for most of the rest of his life. The resulting monumental work—estimated by one critic at 500,000 wordsJoshi, The Evolution of the Weird Tale (Hippocampus Press, 2004), p.43.—remains unpublished, although a portion of it was released separately in 1920 as the novella From Behind the Stars. On March 30, 1934, seven years to the day after the death of his wife, Agnes Gerry, he committed suicide by gas inhalation in the bathroom of his Baltimore home.Edwardian Review His last book, Matrimony (1932) was a memoir of his happy marriage to her.

He played as a and played for the Penrith Panthers, Sydney Roosters, Parramatta Eels, Newcastle Knights, Melbourne Storm and the Manly Warringah Sea Eagles in the National Rugby League, and the Castleford Tigers in the Super League. Background Fa'aoso was born in Aspley, Queensland, Australia to parents of Tongan and Australian descent. He was educated at Wavell State High School. Fa'aoso played his junior football for Norths Aspley before being signed by the Penrith Panthers. Playing career =Penrith Panthers= In Round 14 of the 2004 NRL season, Fa'aoso made his NRL début for the Panthers against the St. George Illawarra Dragons. =Sydney Roosters= In 2005, he joined the Sydney Roosters and played 21 games for them during the year. =Castleford Tigers= In 2006, Fa'aoso played for the Castleford Tigers in the Super League, who signed him after their promotion in 2005. =Parramatta Eels= In 2007, he returned to Australia, signing with The Parramatta Eels for 3 years. He was touted as a replacement for departing Eel Michael Vella who left the Eels to join Super League club Hull Kingston Rovers in 2007. =Newcastle Knights= After 2007, Fa'aoso was released to sign a 2-year deal with the recently cleaned out, Brian Smith-coached Newcastle Knights. During 2008, Fa'aoso became a permanent first-grader for Newcastle, earning a new 3-year contract for the Knights after making 45 appearances and scoring 7 tries for the club. Fa'aoso made another 46 appearances, scoring 3 tries during 2010 and 2011, making the Knights the club that he has spent the most time with. In 2012 Wayne Bennett took over as coach of the Knights and at the halfway stage of the season Fa'aoso had only made 8 appearances for the team. He was told that he wouldn't be re-signed for 2013 after 99 games and wouldn't be stopped if he were to find a new club to join mid-season before 30 June transfer deadline. =Melbourne Storm= On 27 June 2012, Fa'aoso traveled to Melbourne to have a fitness test in order to sign with the Melbourne Storm for the remainder of the 2012 season. He officially signed with the Storm later that afternoon. The Storm's general manager of Football Operations, Frank Ponissi, said the signing of Fa'aoso was a welcome addition to their NRL squad : \\"We see Richie's signing as a chance to bring some further experience and strength to our roster.\\" Fa'aoso left the Knights as a fan favourite, playing 99 games and scoring 12 tries. Fa'aoso said about the move “I have had a ball at the Knights and I will always have great mates here, I thank the Knights for the opportunity and to everyone for their efforts; the coaches, my teammates, the trainers, just everyone at the Club for all they have done for me. Wayne (Bennett) was great to give me a chance at the start of the season and I am disappointed I was unable to make the most of it. I also want to say thank you to all of the Knights fans for your support. The time is right for me to move on and I wish the Knights all the best for the rest of the season and beyond.” On 30 September 2012, Fa'aoso came off the bench in the Melbourne Storm's 2012 NRL Grand Final win over the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs. He played a total of 6 games for the club. =Manly Warringah Sea Eagles= On 10 July 2012, just 13 days after signing with Melbourne, Fa'aoso signed a 2-year deal with the Manly Warringah Sea Eagles starting in 2013, despite not yet having played a game for the Melbourne Storm. Towards the end of the 2013 NRL season, Fa'aoso broke his neck. In February 2014, doctors advised him never to play Rugby league again. He subsequently announced his retirement from Rugby league. =Parramatta Eels second stint= In September 2014, Fa'aoso was cleared for a shock comeback to the NRL from his broken neck. On 30 October 2014, he signed a 1-year contract with the Parramatta Eels starting in 2015. However the NRL did not register the contract, after Fa'aoso could not secure adequate insurance cover for his return. On 2 April 2015, Fa'aoso was cleared to return to the playing field. He made his return in Round 7 of the 2015 NRL season against his former team Newcastle Knights. Shortly after getting on the field, Fa'aoso suffered a concussion from a head knock and was taken off, he subsequently failed the concussion test and was ruled out for the remainder of the match. In October 2015, Fa'aoso again announced his retirement. Representative career Fa'aoso made his international début for Tonga in 2006, playing 4 tests. In August 2008, Fa'aoso was named in the Tonga training squad for the 2008 World Cup, and in October 2008 he was named in the final 24-man Tonga squad. Fa'aoso was again selected for the Tongan national team in 2009 for the Pacific Cup. He was named Tongan player of the year for 2009. On 20 April 2013, Fa'aoso played for Tonga in their Pacific Rugby League International match with Samoa.

U.S. Marine Corps insignia of the rank of lieutenant colonel as shown on the coat of winter uniform Alpha. U.S. Air Force and U.S. Space Force insignia of the rank of Lieutenant Colonel as shown on the coat of the dress blue uniform. In the United States Army, U.S. Marine Corps, U.S. Air Force and U.S. Space Force, lieutenant colonel is a field-grade military officer rank, just above the rank of major and just below the rank of colonel. It is equivalent to the naval rank of commander in the other uniformed services. The pay grade for the rank of lieutenant colonel is O-5. In the United States armed forces, the insignia for the rank are a silver oak leaf, with slight stylized differences between the version of the Army and the Air Force and that of the Navy and the Marine Corps. Promotion to lieutenant colonel is governed by Department of Defense policies derived from the Defense Officer Personnel Management Act (DOPMA) of 1980, for officers in the Active Component, and its companion Reserve Officer Personnel Management Act (ROPMA), for officers in the Reserve Component (e.g., Reserve and National Guard). DOPMA guidelines suggest that 70 percent of majors be promoted to lieutenant colonel after serving at least three years at their present rank and after 15–17 years of cumulative commissioned service. Etymology The U.S. Army uses the three letter abbreviation \\"LTC,\\" while the United States Marine Corps and U.S. Air Force use the abbreviations of \\"LtCol\\" and \\"Lt Col\\" (note the space), respectively. These abbreviation formats are also outlined in The Naval Institute Guide to Naval WritingShenk, Robert; The Naval Institute Guide to Naval Writing, 3rd ed.; US Naval Institute Press, Annapolis, MD; c2011; and in Air Force Handbook 33-337 (AFH 33-337), The Tongue and Quill.http://static.e-publishing.af.mil/production/1/saf_cio_a6/publication/afh33-337/afh33-337.pdf The United States Government Publishing Office recommends the abbreviation \\"LTC\\" for U.S. Army usage, \\"LtCol\\" for Marine Corps usage, and \\"Lt. Col.\\" for the Air Force. The Associated Press Stylebook recommends the abbreviation \\"Lt. Col.\\" for the Army, Marine Corps, and Air Force. Slang terms for the rank historically used by the U.S. military include \\"light colonel\\", \\"short colonel\\", \\"light bird\\", \\"half colonel\\", \\"bottlecap colonel\\" (referring to the silver oak leaf insignia), and \\"telephone colonel\\" (from self-reference as \\"colonel\\" when using a telephone). History Lieutenant colonel rank insignia of the Confederate army, used during the American Civil War. The rank of lieutenant colonel has existed in the British Army since at least the 16th century and was used in both American colonial militia and colonial regular regiments. The Continental Army continued the British and colonial use of the rank of lieutenant colonel, as the second-in-command to a colonel commanding a regiment. The lieutenant colonel was sometimes known as \\"lieutenant to the colonel.\\" In British practice, regiments were actually commanded by their lieutenant colonels, as the colonel was a titular position (with the incumbent absent from the regiment serving as a senior staff officer, a general officer, or as a member of the nobility). Since the British colonel was not a \\"combat\\" officer, beginning in May 1778 to simplify prisoner of war exchanges, American regiments began to eliminate colonels by attrition and replace them with a lieutenant colonel commandant. The conversion was never completely effected and some regiments remained commanded by colonels throughout the war. From 1784 until 1791, there was only one lieutenant colonel in the US Army (Josiah Harmar), who acted as the army's commanding officer. In the Continental Army aides to the Commander in Chief, viz., Lieutenant General George Washington, were lieutenant colonels. Additionally, certain officers serving under the Adjutant General, Inspector General, and Judge Advocate General, ranked as lieutenant colonels. During the 19th century, lieutenant colonel was often a terminal rank for many officers, since the rank of \\"full colonel\\" was considered extremely prestigious reserved only for the most successful officers. Upon the outbreak of the Civil War, the rank of lieutenant colonel became much more common and was used as a \\"stepping stone\\" for officers who commanded small regiments or battalions and were expected, by default, to be promoted to full colonel once the manpower of a regiment grew in strength. Such was the case of Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, who commanded a Maine regiment as both a lieutenant colonel and later as a colonel. After the Civil War ended, those officers remaining in the United States Armed Forces found lieutenant colonel to again be a terminal rank, although many lieutenant colonels were raised to higher positions in a brevet status. Such was the case with George A. Custer, who was a lieutenant colonel in the regular army, but held the brevet rank of major general. The 20th century saw lieutenant colonel in its present-day status although, during the 1930s, many officers again found the rank to be terminal as the rank of colonel was reserved for only a select few officers. Modern usage In the United States Army and the United States Marine Corps (USMC), a lieutenant colonel typically commands a battalion- or squadron-sized unit (300 to 1,200 Soldiers or Marines), with a major as executive officer (XO) and a command sergeant major or sergeant major (USMC) as principal non-commissioned officer (NCO) or senior enlisted adviser (SEA). A lieutenant colonel may also serve as a brigade/brigade combat team, regiment/regimental combat team, Marine Aviation Group (MAG), Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU), or battalion task force executive officer. Lieutenant colonels routinely serve as principal staff officers, under a colonel as chief of staff, on a general staff (\\"G\\" staff) of a division, Marine Expeditionary Brigade (MEB), Marine Aircraft Wing (MAW), or Marine Logistics Group (MLG). These staff positions include G-1 (administration and personnel), G-2 (intelligence), G-3 (operations), G-4 (logistics), G-5 (planning), G-6 (computers and communications), G-9 (Civil Affairs). \\"The G-n\\" may mean either a specific staff section or the staff officer leading a section. Lieutenant colonels may also be junior staff at a variety of higher echelons. In the United States Air Force, a lieutenant colonel is generally a squadron commander in the operations group, mission support group, or maintenance groups, or a squadron commander or division chief in a medical group. The lieutenant colonel also may serve as a Deputy Commander for Operations (DO) in a squadron in the operations group before assuming command of his or her own squadron (this is common for aeronautically rated officers in flying units), or as a deputy commander of a squadron in the maintenance, mission-support, or medical group. Lieutenant colonels may serve also on general staffs and may be the heads of some wing staff departments. Senior lieutenant colonels occasionally serve as group commanders, most commonly in units of the Air Force Reserve Command and the Air National Guard. In U.S. Army ROTC detachments, the commander is typically a lieutenant colonel, with several majors, captains, and non-commissioned officers serving as assistants. In the U.S. Air Force, Air Force ROTC detachments may be commanded by full colonels or lieutenant colonels, depending on the size of the detachment and the size of the associated college or university. =Non- military use= The rank of lieutenant colonel is also used by many large American municipal police departments, county sheriff's offices/departments, state highway patrols, state police, and other law-enforcement agencies for officers in senior administrative positions. The rank is not always called \\"lieutenant colonel\\"; and in many cases—especially in municipal police agencies—another term, such as \\"assistant chief\\" or \\"commander\\", is used, and only the insignia are retained. In some organizations, however, especially state police agencies, both the title and insignia are used. Occasionally, the rank is used with, rather than instead of, an official title. For example, in the Texas Department of Public Safety, the head of the agency's patrol division is titled \\"Chief of the Highway Patrol\\" but holds the rank of a lieutenant colonel: this officer therefore is called \\"lieutenant colonel,\\" not \\"chief\\".

Career He moved to Washington, D.C., where he worked as a carpenter. He became one of Washington's original police officers when the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia was created in 1861. During his time as an officer, he was charged with dereliction of duty and conduct unbecoming an officer several times for being drunk on duty, sleeping on streetcars while at work, and visiting a brothel (Parker claimed the madam had sent for him). Parker was typically reprimanded for these acts but never fired. Lincoln's assassination Unmarked grave of John Frederick Parker at Glenwood Cemetery. On April 14, 1865, President Lincoln, his wife Mary Todd Lincoln, Major Henry Rathbone and his fiancée Clara Harris were attending the play Our American Cousin at Ford's Theatre. Parker was assigned to guard the entrance to the President's box where the four were seated. He is known to have, at first, stayed at his assigned post, but he later told family members that he was then released by Lincoln until the end of the play. During the intermission, Parker went to a nearby tavern with Lincoln's valet and coachman. It is unclear whether Parker ever returned to the theater, but he was not at his post when John Wilkes Booth shot the President. Parker was charged with neglect of duty and tried on May 3, 1865, but no transcripts of the case were kept. The complaint was dismissed on June 2, 1865. Despite leaving his post the night Lincoln was shot, Parker was still assigned to work security at the White House. Before Mary Todd Lincoln moved out of the White House following her husband's death, Parker was assigned as her bodyguard. Mrs. Lincoln's dressmaker Elizabeth Keckley overheard Mrs. Lincoln yell to Parker, \\"So you are on guard tonight, on guard in the White House after helping to murder the President.\\" Parker attempted to defend himself stating that he \\"could never stoop to murder much less to the murder of so good and great a man as the President. I did wrong, I admit, and have bitterly repented.\\" Mrs. Lincoln told Parker that she would always think he was responsible for the President's death and angrily dismissed him from the room. Later years and death Parker remained on the police force until 1868 when he was fired for sleeping on duty. He later went back to work as a carpenter. He died of pneumonia complicated by asthma and exhaustion in Washington, D.C., on June 28, 1890. He was buried in an unmarked grave at Glenwood Cemetery. His widow, Mary America Maus, was buried next to him upon her death in 1904 as were their three children. There are no known images of him. References External links *John F.

The station is owned by Tufts University and is run by students and community members. WMFO is funded by the Tufts Student Activities Fee as allocated by the TCU Senate and through community donations. WMFO occupies the entire third floor of Curtis Hall on the campus of Tufts University. Studio A houses the main broadcast studio. Studio Dee, named for late Boston music writer and WMFO DJ Mikey Dee, is used for live performances that undergo professional mixing, recording and effects processing in the adjacent Studio B. Studio C is a secondary broadcast and production studio. An extensive collection of vinyl records is housed throughout the station. Much of WMFO's vinyl collection was destroyed during the 1977 fire, but appeals to the Tufts community and local residents resulted in donations that replaced some of the lost albums. WMFO is a freeform station that imposes no content restrictions on its air staff, apart from FCC requirements for content, station identification and public service announcements. Musical programming ranges from rock and roll; rock and all its subgenres including hard rock, punk, glam, garage, indie, goth, rock- a-billy, psycho-billy, metal; blues; reggae; folk; easy-listening; hip-hop; dance; jazz; & classical. Spoken word programming includes humorous shows, political talk, sports talk, and community issues. As a condition of the station's FCC license, a portion of the weekly program schedule must be allotted to volunteer DJs from the local community. There are no financial requirements for community members, but they share the same on- and off-air responsibilities as student DJs and must volunteer additional hours each year for station maintenance and upkeep to remain in good standing with the station. The transmitter is atop Ballou hall, is directional to the east, and broadcasts with an effective radiated power of 125 watts. WMFO streams worldwide from wmfo.org as well as broadcast locally on FM radio on 91.5 MHz. History =WTCR= Prior to the licensing of WMFO, the station was home to the unlicensed AM radio station WTCR (Tufts College Radio.) In 1957, Tufts University students used WTCR's war surplus 20-watt transmitter (Tuned to 560 kHz on the AM dial) from the third floor of Curtis Hall, adjacent to the B&M; Railroad line. Legend has it that in Powderhouse Square, you could get WTCR on your toaster; that in close proximity to Curtis Hall, you could receive nothing BUT WTCR on a car radio, and that the signal \\"skipped\\" to B&M; telegraph lines running along the tracks and carried the signal as far north as Quebec. This stunt drew the attention of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which promptly shut the station down and forbade Tufts from having a station for 10 years. Less reliable is the legend that the chief engineer actually spent a night in jail. =WTUR= In the Fall of 1967, several students got together and created a closed circuit station under the call letters WTUR (Tufts U. Radio).\\"Tufts University\\" by Anne Sauer; P.51; Arcadia Publishing; 2001. The signal was spotty at best and often carried static, but Tufts had a radio station again. Among the founders were Tommy Hadges (later of WBCN, WCOZ and consultancy fame), J.J. Jackson (one of the first generation MTV video jocks) and Sam Kopper (later of WBCN and Starfleet Remote Studios.) Later that school year, work began, led by R.J. Trodella, to get Tufts a licensed FM station. =The move to FM= On August 10, 1970, an application for a construction permit was filed with the FCC,F.C.C.'s history cards for WMFO, P.4; Retrieved July 9, 2019. which issued a construction permit on October 23, 1970.F.C.C.'s history cards for WMFO, P.3; Retrieved July 9, 2019.

On April 2, 1977, Curtis Hall, the building that WMFO resides in, had a major fire.

Prior to this fire, WMFO was said to have the second most comprehensive rock vinyl collection in greater Boston, with only WBCN having a larger one. In March 2009, the station left the airwaves for a week, replacing its aging analog equipment with an all-digital system including a Rivendell Radio Automation server that houses much of the station's rock and pop music collections in a lossless format.

It was released in August 1972 by Memphis-based Ardent Records. Many critics praised the album's vocal harmonies and songcraft but #1 Record suffered from poor distribution and sold fewer than 10,000 copies upon its initial release. However, #1 Record gained wider attention in the late '70s in the UK when EMI reissued it with Radio City as a double LP package due to increasing demand. The same combination was used when the album was released on CD in 1992. In 2012 it was ranked number 434 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. Rolling Stone also ranked the song \\"Thirteen\\" as number 406 on its 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. It was voted number 188 in the third edition of Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums (2000). Composition and recording Seven years earlier in 1965, when their home town of Memphis, Tennessee became a tour stop for The Beatles, primary songwriters Alex Chilton and Chris Bell were fifteen years old. Heavily influenced by the UK band, the pair—Bell in particular—wanted to model their songwriting on the Lennon–McCartney partnership, with the result that they credited as many songs as possible on Big Star's debut album to \\"Bell/Chilton\\". In practice, they developed material incrementally in the studio, each making changes to the other's recordings. Drummer Jody Stephens recalled, \\"Alex would come in and put down something rough and edgy and Chris would come in and add some sweet-sounding background vocals to it.\\" Chilton once offered the following on Chris Bell's unique vocal contributions: \\"Chris and I did all the harmony vocals, and he had a brilliant mind that worked in a sort of contrapuntal way. It wasn't based so much on 'Oh you're singing the root. I should be singing the 3rd above,' he would just sing along with the line I was singing. He was a brilliant, instinctual maker of counterpoint.\\" The pair also each contributed songs to the album that were individually composed before Big Star was formed. Chris Bell brought the songs \\"Feel\\", \\"My Life Is Right\\", and \\"Try Again\\" to the recording sessions, which he had previously recorded with a band called 'Rock City' (which featured Big Star drummer Jody Stephens and Steve Rhea), and Chilton brought \\"The Ballad of El Goodo\\", \\"In the Street\\", and the acoustic ballads \\"Thirteen\\" and \\"Watch the Sunrise\\". \\"The India Song\\" was written and composed by Andy Hummel. #1 Record is the only Big Star album on which group founder Chris Bell is officially credited as a member. Bell had a major hand in the record through songwriting, vocals, guitar work and the album's production. The polished sound of #1 Record, in contrast to the more raw styles of the band's subsequent albums, Radio City and Third/Sister Lovers, is attributed by producer John Fry to the presence of Bell: \\"When Chris Bell was still in the band, he took more interest than anybody in the production and technology end of things. He had a good production mind...the reason why the second album is rougher, with fewer harmonies, is due to the absence of Chris's influence in the studio.\\" Bassist Andy Hummel would also credit Bell with having a hand in the album's production: \\"Chris was in charge. I would pretty well credit him with recording and producing that LP [#1 Record]. Of course, he had a lot of artistic help from Alex [Chilton] but Chris was the technical brains behind it. He was the only one of us at that time who knew how to record.\\" Alex Chilton would also acknowledge Bell's heavy role in the studio production: \\"Chris was really into recording. He didn't want the rest of us fooling around in the studio, that was his business.\\" Chilton would also give producer John Fry credit for achieving the album's high level of production quality: \\"John Fry was a genius in his way of mixdowns. We didn't put things on tape much differently than was the standard method of doing things, but he just had such finesse and great ears, and he was just a great meticulous mixdown engineer and producer. [...] He's the one responsible for making those records sound so fucking great.\\" In 2014 the album was re-released through Stax Records with liner notes by Mike Mills. Reception On its release in August 1972, #1 Record immediately received widespread acclaim, and continued to do so for six months, although the inability by Stax Records to make the album available in stores meant it sold fewer than 10,000 copies upon its initial release. Record World called it \\"one of the best albums of the year\\", and Billboard commented, \\"Every cut could be a single\\". Cashbox described it as one where \\"everything falls together as a total sound\\" and one that \\"should go to the top\\". The River City Review's reaction to the album was to state that \\"Big Star will be around for many moons\\".

The auction is extended each time a new bid is placed, typically by 10 to 20 seconds. Without new bids the last participant to have placed a bid wins the item and also pays the final bid price. The auctioneer makes money in two ways: the fees for each bid and the payment for the winning bid, totalling typically significantly more than the value of the item. Such auctions are typically held over the Internet, rather than in person. How it works Participants pay a fee to purchase bids. Each of the bids increases the price of the item by a small amount, such as one penny (0.01 USD, 1¢, or 0.01 GBP, 1p; hence the name of the auction), and extends the time of the auction by a few seconds. Bid prices vary by site and quantity purchased at a time, but generally cost 10–150 times the price of the bidding increment. The auctioneer receives the money paid for each bid, plus the final price of the item. For example, if an item worth 1,000 currency units (dollars, euros, etc.) sells at a final price of 60, and a bid costing 1 raises the price of the item by 0.01, the auctioneer receives 6,000 for the 6,000 bids and 60 as the final price, a total of 6,060, a profit of 5,060. If the winning bidder used 150 bids in the process, they would have paid 150 for the bids plus 60 for the final price, a total of 210 and a saving of 790. All the other, losing, bidders collectively paid 5,850 and received nothing. A TechCrunch article (July 26, 2010) on MadBid, one such site, called this model \\"a license to print money.\\" By contrast in an article on Madbid, The Guardian (28 January 2012) comments \\"legions of penny auction sites have folded, including Swoopo, Rapid Bargain and Bid Boogie.\\" Criticism Due to the possibility of participants spending significant amounts of money and still losing an auction, or ultimately spending more than the retail value of the item they end up winning, some analysts have criticized the model or compared it to gambling, even when operating without fraud.http://technologizer.com/2008/09/17/is-swoopo-nothing-more-than-a-well- designed-gimmick/ The Better Business Bureau warns consumers, \\"although not all penny auction sites are scams, some are being investigated as online gambling. BBB recommends you ... know exactly how the bidding works, set a limit for yourself, and be prepared to walk away before you go over that limit.\\" A penny auction may make the seller a far higher price than the item value. Potential fraudulent practices which can disadvantage buyers even more include shill bidding, where a human or software (bot) bidder covertly acting for the seller places bids which make legitimate bidders continue bidding where otherwise the auction would end, and simply not sending out goods for which a price, albeit low, has been paid. Some bidding fee auction sites have been shut down by state governments after investigations. Wavee US, LLC, settled with the Governor's Office of Consumer Protection in Georgia and agreed to close its website after the office received complaints about merchandise not being shipped in a timely fashion. Washington state shut down PennyBiddr after a lawsuit in which the state accused PennyBiddr of using shill bidding to drive up prices and extend auctions.

On October 7, 1863, the Democratic Press was established in San Francisco, and by June 12, 1865, it became the Evening Examiner, with William S. Moss as publisher and B. F. Washington as editor.

Hutton's sketch of Ferchar's tomb, Fearn Abbey, 1819. Origins The traditional story is that goes back to the work of the great William F. Skene, and indeed, even before him, with William Reeves, whom Skene cited.Reeves, William, 'Saint Maelrubha: His History and Churches' (in Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, vol. III (1857–60), 258-96, at pp. 275-6); Skene Celtic Scotland, Vol. II, pp. 483-4 . The historian Alexander Grant has recently challenged this theory, arguing that the evidence for this origin is far too thin to contradict the intuitive and well attested idea that he came from Easter Ross. Grant takes up the idea instead that mac an t-Sacairt (= Son of the Priest') probably refers to a background as keeper of the shrine to St Duthac, at Tain, Scotland.Grant, \\"The Province of Ross\\", p. 121. However, despite \\"Ross\\" being a word describing the land the Earls managed (hence the Earl of Ross), Sir Robert Gordon (Earldom of Sutherland, P.36) states the Earls of Ross were first of the surname Ó Beólláin, and then were Leslies…) and continues on page 46 they are called by the surname Ó Beólláin through 1333 when \\"Hugh Beolan, Earl of Ross\\" is recorded as one of the slain at the battle of Halidon Hill. The surname remains as the surname of the Earls of Ross from Uilleam Ó Beólláin I, Earl of Ross until the death of Uilleam Ó Beólláin III, Earl of Ross in 1372 when his daughter, Euphemia I, Countess of Ross married to Sir Walter Leslie. Ross became the surname of the Earls of Ross much later in the history of the Earldom (much like the name \\"Windsor\\" is also used as the 20th century surname for the Royal Family). {it was the 4th Earl of Ross that 1st took on the Surname Ross.} Career Scholarly work on Fearchar has led to the conclusion that Fearchar was a native nobleman who benefitted by upholding the interests of the King of Scots.e.g. McDonald, \\"Old and new\\", p. 24. Fearchar emerges from nothingness in 1215, as the local warlord who crushed a large-scale revolt against the Scottish king, Alexander II. The Chronicle of Melrose reported that : \\"Machentagar attacked them and mightily overthrew the king's enemies; and he cut off their heads and presented them as gifts to the new king ... And because of this, the lord king appointed him a new knight.\\"A.O.Anderson, Early Sources, Vol. II, p. 404, with Macdonald, p. 28. Fearchar's ability to defeat the proven might of the Meic Uilleim and MacHeths together suggests that Fearchar could command large military resources, and as McDonald points out, this can hardly be entirely explained by his background as a hereditary priest from Tain.MacDonald, p. 29. However, the Scottish kings themselves were hardly without authority in Ross, and their position could command social power even in this distant land, something proved by the MacWilliams, whose authority depended on their descent from a Scottish king. Fearchar's power then is not so mysterious. =Promotion to Mormaer= It is possible that Fearchar was made Mormaer when the grateful King Alexander II visited Inverness in 1221.Grant, p. 122. Macdonald, however, gives some reasons why this might be a little early; around 1226 is a more likely date, but he was almost certainly Mormaer by 1230, and definitely by 1232, the year in which Fearchar's initial (as the father of his son Uilleam) appears in a charter, with the style Comes de Ross (i.e. Mormaer of Ross). Fearchar's initial and comital style also appear in a charter granting some lands to Walter de Moravia, a charter dating somewhere between 1224 and 1231.For all this, see McDonald, pp. 30-3. So did Fearchar appear from nowhere as a \\"novus homo\\"? The facts are that we do not know what happened to the Mormaerdom of Ross after the death, in 1168, of the last known Mormaer, Malcolm MacHeth. We might compare Ross with other Mormaerdoms, such as Lennox and Carrick, in which these apparently new Mormaerdoms were merely de iure royal grants to native lords who already possessed kinship leadership and de facto status as provincial rulers. In this view, conferring this style was simply an act of harnessing organic Gaelic power structures to the political, terminological and ideological framework of the regnum Scottorum. =Fearchar & Scotland= In 1235, it is reported that Fearchar was active in Galloway. The Revolt of Gille Ruadh in Galloway in 1234/5 required a large-scale levying by the Scottish king. King Alexander invaded Galloway, and Gille Ruadh ambushed the royal army, almost bringing it to destruction. However the Scottish King was saved by Fearchar, who appeared to the rescue with the Men of Ross.Anderson, Vol. II, p. 476. The defeat of the rebellious Galwegians by another peripheral Gaelic lord in the service of the Scottish King had been parallelled in 1187, when Lochlann, Lord of Galloway defeated the rebellious Domnall mac Uilleim, claimant of the Scottish throne, at the Battle of Mam Garvia, somewhere near Dingwall. In fact, one historian has linked the two events as revenge.e.g. Brooke, Wild Men & Holy Places, p. 136. Fearchar was also recorded as being present at the negotiations which led to the Treaty of York, signed in 1237 Marriages & Family One of Fearchar's daughters, called Euphemia, was married to Walter de Moravia, a magnate who ruled Duffus. Walter's family were of Flemish origin, and had been planted in Moray by the Scottish crown as agents of royal authority, but were steadily building an independent power-base. Christina, another of Fearchar's daughters, was married to Amlaibh, the King of Mann and the Isles. If we are to use the chronology of the Chronicles of Mann, this happened sometime before 1223, but after 1188. Such a move is not surprising, as the Manx king ruled over the isle of Skye.McDonald, p. 39 This reminds us that Fearchar was not merely a slavish Scottish magnate with narrow local aspirations, but an ambitious Gaelic warlord with greater regional goals in the Norse-Gaelic world of the Irish Sea, the world of Alan, Lord of Galloway and the Manx kings. Church Patronage Fearchar's wider connections are further illustrated by his religious patronage. In the 1220s he granted the Premonstratensian Order (perhaps the most modern one about) of Whithorn in Galloway a new monastery at Mid Fearn in Ross, moving it a decade later to New Fearn.McDonald, p. 41. They brought with them some relics of St Ninian too, which is why to this day Fearn Abbey is associated with that saint. Such a move was hardly surprising, since all aspiring magnates needed their own monastery. Death We do not know the precise year in which Fearchar died. The traditional date, 1251, is based on the date given in the spurious Ane Breve Cronicle of the Erllis of Ross. The latter gives his birthplace as Tain. Despite the unreliability of this source and date, he was certainly dead by the 1250s, when his son appears as Mormaer in his own right.McDonald, p. 42.

The company was formed on 17 May 1861 and the line opened on 1 June 1864. Garston Dock station had opened in 1852 as the terminus of the St Helens Canal and Railway Company's line from Warrington. The Act of Parliament for this line had also given the company rights to construct a deepwater dock on the River Mersey at Garston, extending the early St Helens and Runcorn Gap Railway further down the Mersey to a better and less tidal port. The company also aspired to reach Liverpool and the Garston and Liverpool Railway would be the means for this, extending beyond the Garston terminus, and following the Mersey downstream to the North West.

Extension to Liverpool Central  The first terminus at Brunswick was poorly placed as a station to serve central Liverpool and almost as soon as it opened, an Act of Parliament was obtained for the Liverpool Central Station Railway, which would divert from just before Brunswick through a mile and a half of deep cuttings and tunnels in the red sandstone through St James and to a terminus at Liverpool Central. The extensive civil engineering works needed meant that construction took nearly ten years, opening on 2 March 1874.

Garston and Liverpool in orange, L&NWR; in red Although the line had been built through mostly open countryside, Liverpool's southern suburbs began to develop and expand along the line around this time, making it an important commuter route into Central station, the most central of Liverpool's three major termini. Competition for routes along the Mersey had led to duplication of routes within the Cheshire Lines Committee and against their competitors the London and North Western Railway. Although Central was always a busy station, it was scheduled for closure under the Beeching Axe, services to Central from Warrington and beyond Garston being re-routed around the Allerton Curve, the L&NWR; Speke to Edge Hill line, and into Lime Street instead. Central High Level, and the Garston line, closed in 1972. The line would re- open again in 1978, as part of the electrified Merseyrail network, which integrated the underground and under-river Mersey Railway with suburban lines to North and South of Liverpool.

As well as honouring the player of the year, who received the Dally M Medal, awards are also given to the premier player in each position, the best coach, the best captain, representative player of the year and the most outstanding rookie of the season. The awards are named in honour of Australian former rugby league great Herbert Henry \\"Dally\\" Messenger. History Johnathan Thurston, the winner of the most Dally M \\"Player of the Year\\" medals, with four James Tedesco, the winner of the Dally M \\"Player of the Year\\" Medal for 2019 The awards were introduced in 1979 by News Limited. Their journalists vote on the best performing players in each match on a 3, 2, 1 point(s) system. The scores of the voting are visible to the public and media up until Round 16 of the NRL season. In 1998, following the merger of the Super League and the Australian Rugby League (ARL), the awards became the official awards of the newly formed National Rugby League. Prior to 1998, the official award of the game was voted on by the referees and were known as the Rothmans Medal from 1968 to 1996 and the Nokia Provan- Summons Medal in 1997. Today the Provan-Summons Medal is for the fans' \\"people's choice\\" player of the year. Between 1979 and 1996, when both the Dally M Medal and Rothmans Medal were awarded, the same player won both awards on only three occasions - Peter Sterling in 1987, Gavin Miller in 1989 and Ricky Stuart in 1993. In 1997, when the game was split between the News Limited-organised Super League competition and the ARL, News Limited did not hold the awards. The only other time the awards night has not been held was in 2003, following a dispute with the Rugby League Players Association (RLPA). After the players had threatened to boycott the event unless the NRL met their demands, the NRL cancelled the Dally M awards two days prior to the ceremony. Craig Gower would have been named player of the year had the awards not been cancelled. Gower was subsequently awarded the inaugural RLPA Players Player Medal in recognition of his 2003 NRL season exploits, and his central role in the dispute that saw the creation of the game's first overarching workplace agreement 8 months after the boycott. The 2014 Dally M Medal was held on 29 September 2014 and was won jointly by Jarryd Hayne and Johnathan Thurston of the North Queensland Cowboys. It was the first time the medal has been won jointly since its inception.

The western edge of Aokigahara, where there are several caves that fill with ice in winter, is a popular destination for tourists and school trips. Parts of Aokigahara are very dense, and the porous lava absorbs sound, helping to provide visitors with a sense of solitude. The forest has a historical reputation as a home to yūrei: ghosts of the dead in Japanese mythology. In recent years, Aokigahara has become known as \\"the Suicide Forest\\", one of the world's most-used suicide sites; signs at the head of some trails urge suicidal visitors to think of their families and contact a suicide prevention association. Geography Saiko Lake and Aokigahara on the left. The forest floor mostly consists of volcanic rock which can be difficult to penetrate with hand tools. Since the forest is very dense, in recent years, hikers and tourists trekking through Aokigahara have begun to use plastic tape to mark their paths to avoid getting lost. Designated trails lead to several tourist attractions such as the Narusawa Ice Cave, Fugaku Wind Cave and Lake Sai Bat Cave which are three larger lava caves near Mount Fuji, the ice cave being frozen year-round. Aokigahara has been falsely portrayed as a place where navigational compasses go haywire. Needles of magnetic compasses will move if placed directly on the lava, aligning with the rock's natural magnetism, which varies in iron content and strength by location. However, a compass behaves as expected when held at a normal height. The Japan Ground Self-Defense Force has conducted its ranger courses including navigation training in the forest since 1956. Flora and fauna Mammals include the Asian black bear, small Japanese mole, bats, mice, deer, fox, boar, wild rabbit, Japanese mink and Japanese squirrel. Birds include great tit, willow tit, long-tailed tit, magerahigara, higera, great spotted woodpecker, pygmy woodpecker, bush warbler, Eurasian jay, Japanese white-eye, Japanese thrush, brown-headed thrush, Siberian thrush, Hodgson's hawk-cuckoo, Japanese grosbeak, lesser cuckoo, black-faced bunting, oriental turtle dove, and common cuckoo. There are ground beetles and other insects, including many species of butterflies, even in the forest interior Argynnis paphia, Chrysozephyrus smaragdinus, Celastrina argiolus, Celastrina sugitanii, Curetis acuta, Favonius jezoensis, Neptis sappho, Parantica sita and Polygonia c-album are found. The forest has a variety of conifers and broadleaf trees and shrubs including: Chamaecyparis obtusa, Cryptomeria japonica, Pinus densiflora, Pinus parviflora, Tsuga sieboldii, Acer distylum, Acer micranthum, Acer sieboldianum, Acer tschonoskii, Betula grossa, Chengiopanax sciadophylloides (as Acanthopanax sciadophylloides a.k.a. Eleutherococcus sciadophylloides), Clethra barbinervis, Enkianthus campanulatus, Euonymus macropterus, Ilex pedunculosa, Ilex macropoda, Pieris japonica, Prunus jamasakura, Quercus mongolica var. crispula, Rhododendron dilatatum, Skimmia japonica f. repens, Sorbus commixta (as Sorbus americana ssp. japonica) and Toxicodendron trichocarpum (as Rhus trichocarpa). The dominant tree species between 1000 and 1800 metres of altitude is Tsuga diversifolia and from 1800 to 2200 metres is Abies veitchii. Deeper in the forest there are many herbaceous flowering plants including Artemisia princeps, Cirsium nipponicum var. incomptum, Corydalis incisa, Erigeron annuus, Geranium nepalense, Kalimeris pinnatifida, Maianthemum dilatatum, Oplismenus undulatifolius and Reynoutria japonica (syn. Polygonum cuspidatum). There are also the myco-heterotrophic Monotropastrum humile, frequent liverworts, many mosses and many ferns. The forest edges have many more species. Suicides Aokigahara is sometimes referred to as the most popular site for suicide in Japan. In 2003, 105 bodies were found in the forest, exceeding the previous record of 78 in 2002. In 2010, the police recorded more than 200 people having attempted suicide in the forest, of whom 54 completed the act. Suicides are said to increase during March, the end of the fiscal year in Japan. As of 2011, the most common means of suicide in the forest were hanging or drug overdose. In recent years, local officials have stopped publicizing the numbers in an attempt to decrease Aokigahara's association with suicide. The rate of suicide has led officials to place a sign at the forest's entry urging suicidal visitors to seek help and not take their own lives. Annual body searches have been conducted by police, volunteers, and journalists since 1970. The site's popularity has been attributed to Seichō Matsumoto's 1961 novel Nami no Tō (Tower of Waves).\\"Inside Japan's 'Suicide Forest (The Japan Times, 26 June 2011) However, the history of suicide in Aokigahara predates the novel's publication, and the place has long been associated with death; ubasute may have been practiced there into the nineteenth century, and the forest is reputedly haunted by the yūrei of those left to die. References in media Yamanashi. Aokigahara has been referred to in several media, including anime and manga, films, literature, music, and video games. For example: It was the subject of a BBC Radio 4 production (first broadcast 10 September 2018) in which four poets traveled to Aokigahara to write and record poetry in the forest. The poets Arai Takako, Jordan A. Y. Smith, Osaki Sayaka, and Yotsumoto Yasuhiro co-authored a bilingual (Japanese/English) anthology of the poems and short writings on Aokigahara, titled Sea of Trees: Poetic Gateways to Aokigahara (ToPoJo Excursions, 2019). An American playwright of Japanese ancestry, Kristine Haruna Lee, wrote and staged a play, Suicide Forest, in New York City in March 2019. It addressed suicide in America and Japan, referencing the Aokigahara Forest. The 2015 film The Sea of Trees with Matthew McConaughey, Ken Watanabe and Naomi Watts also tells a story happening in this forest. The rap collective Aoki Boys takes its name from Aokigahara.

Appointed by King Offa of Mercia, Æthelhard had difficulties with both the Kentish monarchs and with a rival archiepiscopate in southern England, and was deposed around 796 by King Eadberht III Præn of Kent. By 803, Æthelhard, along with the Mercian King Coenwulf, had secured the demotion of the rival archbishopric, once more making Canterbury the only archbishopric south of the Humber in Britain. Æthelhard died in 805, and was considered a saint until his cult was suppressed after the Norman Conquest in 1066. Early life Nothing is known of Æthelhard's family background or early life, however it is assumed that he was a native of Mercia. He first appears in the historical record as abbot of a monastery at Louth, Lincolnshire before being named to the diocese of Winchester.Williams \\"Æthelheard\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography He was consecrated Bishop of Winchester sometime after 759 and before 778.Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 223 Canterbury Æthelhard was translated from the see of Winchester to the see of Canterbury in 792 and was enthroned as archbishop on 21 July 793.Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 214 Æthelhard owed his appointment to King Offa of Mercia, and the enthronement was presided over by the then-senior bishop of the land: Hygberht, the Archbishop of Lichfield. King Offa consulted Alcuin of York over proper procedure, as the archbishopric of Lichfield was a new creation.Stenton Anglo-Saxon England p. 225 Around 796, Æthelhard was deposed by King Eadberht III Præn of Kent because Æthelhard had been appointed by Offa. Offa had died in 796, and Eadberht seized control of Kent, forcing Æthelhard to flee to the court of Offa's son Ecgfrith of Mercia. Ecgfrith himself died before 796, and a distant relative Coenwulf took the throne. Alcuin encouraged Æthelhard to return to Canterbury, and suggested a compromise over the status of Lichfield, which had been established by Offa in rivalry to Canterbury. Alcuin's plan would have allowed Hygberht to retain archiepiscopal status during his lifetime, but it would be a purely ceremonial rank. In this proposal, Canterbury would regain its status as the only archbishopric south of the Humber and Æthelhard would return to Canterbury. However, Æthelhard was unable to do this while Eadberht was still in power.Brooks Early History of the Church of Canterbury pp. 120–132 Alcuin had previously stated that Lichfield had been elevated because of a \\"lust for power\\", presumably by Offa, and not through any consideration of the merits of the plan.Kirby Earliest English Kings p. 142 Although Alcuin had scorn for Æthelhard for fleeing Canterbury, the papacy saw it differently. Pope Leo III praised Æthelhard for fleeing and refusing to submit to Eadberht, whom Leo compared to the later Roman emperor Julian the Apostate. There are indications, though, that the Kentish community considered electing another archbishop while Æthelhard was in exile.Kirby Earliest English Kings p. 149 Troubles with Lichfield Because Lichfield had been established by the papacy, any change in its status required papal assent. Coenwulf's first embassy to Leo III in 797 about demoting Lichfield did not succeed, mainly because Leo seems to have resented the implied criticism of his predecessor Hadrian I, who had approved the elevation of Lichfield.Kirby Earliest English Kings p. 143 Coenwulf's embassy bore a letter to the pope that asked for papal advice on how to resolve the problems surrounding Lichfield and Canterbury. The letter reminded the papacy of Pope Gregory the Great's old scheme to have two metropolitans in Britain, one in the north and one in the south, with the southern one being based in London. The letter implied that Coenwulf was asking for Æthelhard's metropolitan see to be moved to London. The same embassy carried a letter from Æthelhard also, which has not survived. The pope, however, did not agree with the embassy. The papal reply to Coenwulf stated that the southern archbishopric must remain at Canterbury, as well as excommunicated Eadberht and authorised his expulsion from Kent if he persisted in keeping Æthelhard from Canterbury. In 798 Coenwulf invaded Kent and captured Eadberht, whom he blinded and imprisoned. Æthelhard was restored to Canterbury, where he set about restoring the see's possessions. He also managed to secure professions of obedience from a number of southern bishops, including Eadwulf of Lindsey and Tidferth of Dummoc. But, Hygberht was still being called archbishop in 799. Because Pope Leo was involved in disputes in Rome during 799 and 800, and was unable to spare attention for English affairs, no papal decisions could be made on the dispute. Æthelhard resolved to go to Rome and consult with the pope about the decline in power of the see of Canterbury.Stenton Anglo-Saxon England pp. 225–227 The archbishop went to Rome along with Bishop Cyneberht of Winchester, and carried two letters from Coenwulf to the pope. After some discussions, Leo sided with Canterbury and demoted Lichfield back down to a bishopric. Besides these papal actions, there are indications that the cathedral clergy of Canterbury never recognised the elevation of Lichfield. Return from exile Æthelhard returned to England in 803, and convened the Council of Clovesho, which decreed that no archiepiscopal see besides Canterbury should ever been established in the southern part of Britain. Hygberht attended the council, but as an abbot, which makes it apparent that he had resigned his see before the council met. At that same council, Æthelhard also presented a papal decision that asserted the freedom of churches from secular authority.Hindley Brief History of the Anglo-Saxons p. 106 While at the council, Æthelhard once more proclaimed that the papacy had been deceived into elevating Lichfield, and that it was a \\"tyranical power\\" that had been behind the effort. Æthelhard presided over at least eleven synods, and possibly one more. Æthelhard died on 12 May 805 and was buried in Canterbury. He was later revered as a saint, with a feast day of 12 May, but his cult was suppressed by Archbishop Lanfranc in the late 11th century and never was revived.

Nothing is known of his life prior to 803, when he attended a church council, but he was probably a nobleman from Middlesex. He was elected archbishop in 805 and spent his time in office reforming the clergy of his cathedral. He also quarrelled with two consecutive Mercian kings – Coenwulf and Ceolwulf – over whether laymen or clergy should control monasteries. At one point, Wulfred travelled to Rome to consult with the papacy and was deposed from office for a number of years over the issue. After Coenwulf's death, relations were somewhat better with the new king Ceolwulf, but improved much more after Ceolwulf's subsequent deposition. The dispute about control of the monasteries was not fully settled until 838, after Wulfred's death. Wulfred was the first archbishop to place his portrait on the coinage he struck. Sources and early life The main sources for Wulfred's life are the surviving charters which mention him, a number of documents from his suffragan bishops pledging obedience, the records of a church council he presided over, and the coinage he issued. Wulfred is believed to have come from Middlesex and to have been a member of a wealthy and important family with considerable landholdings in Middlesex and neighbouring regions. Although earlier historians felt that Wulfred came from the Kentish nobility, it no longer appears that this was so.Witney \\"Period of Mercian Rule\\" Archæologia Cantiana pp. 89–90 A kinsman, Werhard, owned property near Hayes, and Wulfred later owned property there also. Other evidence suggests that he was related to a noble family that owned lands in Harrow and Twickenham as well as Hayes. Wulfred was archdeacon of the community at Christ Church, Canterbury before the death of his predecessor Æthelhard on 12 May 805.Brooks \\"Wulfred\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Wulfred attended a synod as a member of Æthelhard's staff in 803,Kelly \\"Wulfred\\" Blackwell Encyclopedia of Anglo-Saxon England but this is the first mention of Wulfred in the historical record. On 26 July 805, he attended a synod and was named \\"archbishop-elect\\" on the documents relating to the council decisions. Wulfred was consecrated archbishop on 3 August 805,Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 214 or perhaps in October or later in 805. He may have owed his elevation to Canterbury to the fact that the kingdom of Mercia dominated Kent and Canterbury at this time. Reform of Christ Church One of Wulfred's main objects as archbishop was the reformation of the cathedral chapter of Canterbury – that of Christ Church. A main tenet was the establishment of communal life for the clergy in the cathedral chapter. This effort was modelled on that of Bishop Chrodegang of Metz. By 813, Wulfred was already claiming in a document that he had \\"revived the holy monastery of the church of Canterbury by renewing, restoring and rebuilding it\\".Quoted in Brooks \\"Wulfred\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Wulfred may have based the rule of the community on Chrodegang's Regula canonicorum, or perhaps on the rule of Benedict. His efforts including requiring the clergy to eat together, to give over their personal property to the chapter, and ensuring that the canonical hours were kept as part of the liturgy. Although it is clear that a communal style of living was practised, whether the cathedral clergy were transformed into canons or if they remained monks is unclear. Later, Wulfred granted land to the chapter, but the gifts would only be valid as long as the chapter kept to the new standards. Wulfred also used his personal wealth to fund the construction of new buildings. Disputes with Coenwulf Wulfred came into conflict with King Coenwulf of Mercia over the issue of whether laymen could control religious houses, with the king supporting the rights of laymen to control monasteries. In 808 the papacy informed Charlemagne that Coenwulf had not yet made peace with the archbishop, but by 809 they seem to have been on good terms; the two were involved in a series of land transfers from 809 to 815. In 814, Wulfred travelled to Rome to visit Pope Leo III. Although the exact nature of his business with the pope is unknown, it was likely connected with the issue that arose between the archbishop and Coenwulf over lay control of monasteries.Brooks Early History of the Church of Canterbury pp. 132–142 He was accompanied by the bishop of Sherborne, Wigberht.Kirby Earliest English Kings p. 152 Laymen controlling monasteries had been customary for centuries, though in the half-century or so before Wulfred became archbishop the church had begun to assert control over monasteries. In England, this attempt to secure control was manifested in decrees made by synods at Clofesho in 803 and more especially the synod of Chelsea in 816. Tensions over the Kentish monastic houses of Reculver and Minster-in-Thanet reached such a point that Wulfred was deprived of authority by the king for a period of some years; six according to the document drawn up in 825 recording the – then victorious – Canterbury view of the debate, though four is perhaps more likely. Wulfred still witnessed documents as archbishop in 817, and by September 822, he was once more officiating as archbishop, when he consecrated King Ceolwulf of Mercia. Wulfred was driven into exile briefly at some point during his suspension from office. However, the dispute was still active in the last years of Coenwulf's reign, as at a council held perhaps in 821, the king threatened the archbishop with exile unless he yielded.Kirby Earliest English Kings p. 153 Wulfred and the Canterbury community fought Coenwulf vigorously, sending embassies to the pope and concocting forgeries in their favour which purported to have been issued by earlier kings. Around 820 Coenwulf forced Wulfred into an unfavourable settlement by which Wulfred gained control over the debated monasteries in exchange for a large payment of gold and the loss of a very large estate to the king.Stenton Anglo-Saxon England p. 229 Nor did Coenwulf and his followers quickly cede control of Minster and Reculver to the archbishop. In September 822, Wulfred reached a settlement with Coenwulf's successor Ceolwulf signified by the consecration of Ceolwulf as king, which had been delayed about a year because of the dispute with the archbishop. After Ceolwuf's deposition in 823 Wulfred's situation improved. The new Mercian king, Beornwulf, presided over another council at Clofesho in 825 where the conflict was finally settled in Wulfred's favour and an account of the whole conflict up to that point was written down. Coenwulf's daughter Cwenthryth, abbess of Winchcombe and Minster, paid compensation to Wulfred and lost control over the houses in Kent. Later in 825 (or possibly the following year), however, Kent was lost to Mercia after Egbert of Wessex defeated Beornwulf at Ellendun. Relations between Wulfred and the new West Saxon rulers were cold, and coinage in Wulfred's name appears to have ceased for a time, though it had been restored before Wulfred's death in 832. Final settlement of the debate over lordship of monasteries came in 838 at Kingston, shortly before Egbert's death.Brooks Early History of the Church of Canterbury pp. 197–203 Death and legacy Wulfred died in 832, probably on 24 March. Most of his wealth was left to a kinsman, Werhard, who was to give the lands to Christ Church after his own death. Werhard, who was a member of the monastery of Christ Church, rose to the position of \\"priest-abbot\\" by the middle years of the 830s. This is known from Wulfred's will, which survives in a late copy. This document names Werhard as Wulfred's nephew, and calls him priest. The Christ Church scriptorium was particularly active under Wulfred. Although the handwriting of the documents produced during Wulfred's archiepiscopate is quite elegant, the actual contents of the charters is marked by bad grammar and other errors. From this, the historian N. P. Brooks has deduced that the clergy of the cathedral were not very literate in Latin, and would have likely been unable to compose new Latin works. Wulfred was the first archbishop to place his portrait on the pennies struck in his name which, unlike those of previous archbishops, never made reference to the ruling Mercian king.Hindley Brief History of the Anglo-Saxons p. 223 Wulfred also rebuilt some buildings at Christ Church, Canterbury, although it is not known whether these were support buildings, such as the dormitory and refractory, or if he rebuilt the cathedral itself.Brooks Early History of the Church of Canterbury pp. 51–52 Citations References   * * Further reading * External links * Category:9th-century archbishops Category:Archbishops of Canterbury Category:8th-century births Category:832 deaths Category:Year of birth unknown ","title":"Wulfred"},{"id":"3413105","text":"The Eastern States Agency was a grouping of princely states in eastern India, during the latter years of Britain's Indian Empire.

The current municipality with city status was formed in 2000. Mont-Tremblant is most famous for its ski resort, the Mont-Tremblant Ski Resort, which is 7 kilometres from the village proper, at the foot of a mountain called Mont Tremblant (derived from local Algonquins who referred to it as the \\"trembling mountain\\"). Mont-Tremblant has a race track called Circuit Mont-Tremblant. It has hosted or currently hosts Formula One, Can-Am, Trans-Am, and Champ Car World Series competitions and Ironman triathlon, Quebec. The surrounding area also features hiking, cycling, canoeing, fishing, golfing, ziplines, tennis, running, go-karting, and a host of other outdoor activities. Since the summer of 2006, Mont-Tremblant has its own senior amateur Canadian football team, the Mystral, and Junior AA hockey team, Les Diables (Devils). History House in the historic Mont-Tremblant village The area was inhabited by Algonquins before European colonization. It was settled in 1872 by parish priest Antoine Labelle, leading to formal establishment of the parish in 1879. A railway line from Montreal was completed to the village of Saint-Jovite in 1892, and extended to Lac Mercier in 1904. Mont-Tremblant developed around the Lac- Mercier station. In 1905 a hydroelectric dam was erected on the banks of the Ruisseau Clair (Clear River) and the Rivière-du-Diable (Devil's River) providing electricity initially for Saint-Jovite. Principal economic activities were agriculture and logging. Constructed by Joseph Bondurant Ryan, the ski resort Mont-Tremblant Lodge began operation of their first chair lift in 1939. His family sold the resort in 1965 to a consortium of investors. In 2002 the four municipalities in the area merged, Ville Saint-Jovite, Paroisse de Saint-Jovite, Mont-Tremblant, and Lac-Tremblant-Nord, becoming the amalgamated Ville de Mont-Tremblant.

Michener, published by Random House in 1978. The story deals with several families living in the Chesapeake Bay area around Virginia and Maryland, from 1583 to 1978. Plot summary The story-line, like much of Michener's work, depicts a number of characters within family groups over a long time period, richly illustrating the history of the area through these families' timelines. It starts in 1583 with American Indian tribes warring, moves with English settlers through the 17th century (land appropriation, tobacco farming, indentured servitude, religious persecution, etc.), slavery, pirate attacks, the American Revolution and the Civil War, Emancipation and attempted assimilation, to the final major event being the Watergate scandal of 1972-1974. The last voyage, a funeral, is in 1978. Chapters The book is divided into 14 separate chapters with two sections each. The first part provides a key date and describes the background behind the arrival of a person or thing (i.e. a family of Canadian geese in Voyage Eight and floodwaters in Voyage Eleven) to the Delmarva Peninsula area, while the second section provides a thematic name and describes how the new arrivals interact with places and the people already settled in the area. *Voyage One: 1583 The River *Voyage Two: 1608  The Island *Voyage Three: 1636  The Marsh * Voyage Four: 1661 The Cliff *Voyage Five: 1701  Rosalind's Revenge *Voyage Six: 1773  Three Patriots * Voyage Seven: 1811 The Duel *Voyage Eight: 1822  Widow's Walk *Voyage Nine: 1832  The Slave-Breaker * Voyage Ten: 1837 The Railroad * Voyage Eleven: 1886 The Watermen *Voyage Twelve: 1938  Ordeal by Fire *Voyage Thirteen: 1976  Refuge *Voyage Fourteen: 1978  Geography  thumb Most of the events of the novel take place on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, and, more specifically, on and around the Choptank River. Michener lived near there, in St. Michaels, while he worked on the book. Michener developed four fictional pieces of land in Maryland to build the locations of his novel: Patamoke and The Neck; The Turlock Marsh; Peace Cliff; and Devon Island on which Rosalind's Revenge was built. All of these locations were placed by the open water of the Choptank. The location of Devon Island would be immediately north of Todds Point, approximately 3 miles southeast of the southern tip of Tilghman Island.Location of the fictional Devon Island on Google Maps The town of Patamoke lies on a fictitious promontory on the Choptank opposite Cambridge.Location of the fictional town of Patamoke on Google Maps The Quaker Meeting House that Michener places in Patamoke in the novel is based upon the Third Haven Meeting House, built in Easton, Md. in the 1680s; it is the oldest Quaker meeting house in the United States (see List of the oldest churches in the United States).  Themes and motifs  The novel has a number of central themes, such as religion, slavery, poverty, and industry, each personified by a particular family that settles on the Bay, and in some cases, by several families. The religious element of the novel applies to the Steeds, who are Roman Catholic and the Paxmores who are Quakers (Michener himself was raised a Quaker by his adopted mother). At several points the novel takes the form of debate with religious themes or overtones, beginning with a doctrinal discussion about the religious role of women between Ralph Steed, a Catholic priest, and Ruth Brinton, a matriarch of the Paxmore family. Each such debate always involves one of the Paxmores, with the source of disagreement being rooted in that individual Quaker's beliefs. Slavery is an overriding theme of the entire book. The Steeds are great landowners and one of the greatest holders of slaves in the colonies, whereas the Paxmores, through Ruth Brinton, are the first proponents of emancipation. It is said that the Choptank Quakers' Association (near the Choptank River) is the first religious organization to ban slavery. Later in the book, Cudjo Cater is captured in Africa and put to work on the Steed plantation, where he buys his freedom and settles in the nearby township with a wife. The Cater family is forever affected by slavery, even after emancipation, as evidenced when Jeb Cater tries to get his son treated for an ear infection. Prior to the American Civil War (1861-1865), the Paxmores form the Maryland link of the \\"Underground Railroad\\" to free territory in Pennsylvania, which Cudjo contemplates using before he buys his freedom. Poverty is best shown in the living standards of the Turlocks, who live in a marsh on the riverside. While they are one of the closest families to nature throughout the whole novel, akin to most of the Indians, they live in the same one bedroom shack built in the 17th century, and the children often watch the adults' sexual activity. However, by the end of the book, at least some of the Turlocks have risen out of poverty. The head of the Turlock family by 1978 is a wealthy real estate broker, selling waterside properties to a well-heeled clientele; one of his customers is a returning member of the Steed family. The other side of poverty is the place in the township dubbed \\"The Neck\\" in the 20th century, where all the Negro housing is located, including a separate segregated school and baseball diamond. Living standards are greatly reduced in \\"The Neck\\", with the school teacher managing multiple years, and children counting themselves privileged to have either a book or a desk. \\"The Neck\\" is eventually burned down by black activists, one of them Jeb Cater's son. Industry is seen in how each family builds their life up around them due to need, and eventually flourishes. It starts with Pentaquod, a Susquehannock Indian, who settles on a clifftop which is paradise to him. Edmund Steed settles on Devon Island and builds his home, complete with chapel, and founds his great plantation from the ground up with land bought from the Indians. The Steeds eventually own thousands of acres and are extremely wealthy. The Paxmores start with Edward Paxmore, a Quaker carpenter, being banished from Massachusetts and building his house on a cliff overlooking the Choptank. He learns how to build a boat because of necessity and with only help from Indians, and eventually learns how to build an ocean-going sailing ship. His boat building business becomes highly successful and thrives in the township. The Caters struggle for a long time, until 'Big Jimbo' Cater becomes a cook for an oyster harvesting skipjack sailing vessel. He eventually earns enough money to buy his own skipjack, which he staffs with his family, and becomes a successful captain. The Caveneys, who emigrated from Ireland due to the Great Famine of the 1840s, are easily assimilated into the town, and become central characters in the oyster and duck subplots. As can be seen from each family's success through determination, the message is that they worked hard and attained great things. References Category:Novels by James A.

William Lenoir (May 8, 1751 - May 6, 1839) was an American Revolutionary War officer and prominent statesman in late 18th-century and early 19th-century North Carolina. Both the City of Lenoir, North Carolina and Lenoir County, North Carolina are named for him. Additionally, Lenoir City, Tennessee is jointly named for him and for his son, William Ballard Lenoir. The USS Lenoir (AKA-74) was also (indirectly) named for him. Family and early years The Lenoir name is of French origin, literally translating to \\"the black,\\" which was a term that was similar to how we now use \\"dark\\" to speak of someone with dark hair and complexion. Lenoirs came to the English colonies in America from Brittany as a result of 17th century religious troubles. Brittany was just across the English Channel from Southern England. Because it had such a long coastline, it is no surprise how many mariners came from the area. The Lenoir coat-of-arms, \\"Le Noir de Nantes\\" is named for Nantes, the largest city of Brittany and an important seaport. William Lenoir was born the youngest of ten in a French Huguenot family in Brunswick County, Virginia. His mother was Mourning Crawley, the daughter of a well-to-do Virginia planter. Her grandfather was Robert Crawley who was an early vestryman of the most noted surviving colonial church, Bruton Parish in Williamsburg. Lenoir's father was Thomas Lenoir, who, like his own father, was a mariner in early life before his marriage when he became a tobacco planter for the remainder of his life. The family moved to eastern North Carolina when William was nine years old, which was where his father died in 1765. Of the four daughters, Ann, Betty, Leah, and Mary; Leah lived the longest, marrying John Norwood and dying in North Carolina at age 94. One of the six sons of Thomas and Mourning died unmarried, Robert remained in Virginia, Thomas Jr., Isaac and John settled in South Carolina, and William remained in North Carolina, where he went on to have a distinguished public career and founded the Fort Defiance branch of the family. Lenoir had no formal education, but could read and write Latin, Greek, and French. His first occupation was that of teacher and schoolmaster, before he became a surveyor. While surveying in western North Carolina, Lenoir decided to permanently settle there. He brought with him his wife, Ann Ballard, and a baby daughter, when he arrived in March 1775. The Lenoirs had nine children in all. One, Martha or \\"Patsy\\", married Israel Pickens. Revolutionary War Fort Defiance Historian Samuel Ashe called Lenoir an \\"active and zealous and efficient supporter of the cause of independence.\\" He served with distinction in the American Revolutionary War, in particular taking part in the Battle of Kings Mountain as a captain in the Wilkes County Regiment of the North Carolina militia under Benjamin Cleveland. He received minor wounds at that battle. While serving as a captain of a company of the Wilkes County Regiment, he fought at the Battle of Stono Ferry (June 20, 1779) in South Carolina, the Siege of Savannah in Georgia (September 16 to October 18, 1779), and the Battle of Haw River in Orange County, North Carolina (February 25, 1781). In his last action at Pyle's massacre (also referred to as Battle of Haw River, his horse was said to be the only American Patriot casualty. Lenoir subsequently gathered troops together to fight at the Battle of Guilford Court House, but arrived too late. He was also involved in minor skirmishes with Loyalists and Cherokee Indians.

After the war, William and his wife, Ann, lived in their home, called Fort Defiance (built by Thomas Fields). Only years after the war did Lenoir achieve the rank of major general from service in the state militia. Shortly after achieving that rank, he desired to fight in the War of 1812, but was deemed too old to do so. The disappointment of that led Lenoir to resign from the militia. Fort Defiance continues today, restored as a tourist and historical attraction in modern-day Caldwell County, North Carolina.Fort Defiance Politics and public service Lenoir, an anti- federalist, served for many years as a justice of the peace and Clerk of Court for Wilkes County, North Carolina. He was a founding member (and briefly, the first president) of the Board of Trustees of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where Lenoir Hall is also named for him. From 1781 to 1795, Lenoir was also a member of the state Legislature representing Wilkes County and served as Speaker of the North Carolina Senate from 1790 to 1795. He was a member of both the Hillsborough Convention of 1788, which neither rejected or approved the United States Constitution, and the Fayetteville Convention of 1789, which ratified it. Lenoir was suspicious of the new constitution and argued that it needed an amendment guaranteeing religious freedom (which it later received)., as well as 1781 to 1795Church and State in North Carolina (web reference was removed; new source required) General Lenoir died on May 6, 1839, two days shy of his eighty-eighth birthday.

He was general manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers from 2006 through 2014, currently serving as an analyst for the Dodgers studio show on Spectrum SportsNet LA. Before moving to the Dodgers, he was assistant general manager of the San Francisco Giants.Schulman, Harry. \\"Durham will face challenge\\". San Francisco Chronicle, February 13, 2008. Retrieved February 13, 2008. Colletti is one of very few American sports executives to work in two major sports-Major League Baseball and the National Hockey League. Colletti graduated from East Leyden High School in Franklin Park, Illinois, and attended Triton College before graduating from Northern Illinois University. He was inducted into the Triton College Sports Hall of Fame in 1993, the same year as the Major League players Kirby Puckett, Lance Johnson and Jeff Reboulet. In 2015, he was inducted into the National Italian American Sports Hall of Fame. In 2021, he is scheduled to be inducted into the Chicago Sports Hall of Fame. In 1982, Colletti began his Major League career with the Chicago Cubs. He was a member of the front office when the Cubs won the National League East in 1984 and 1989. Colletti was honored with Major League Baseball's Robert O. Fishel Award for Public Relations Excellence in 1990. Colletti left the Cubs and joined the front office of the San Francisco Giants in 1994 as director of baseball operations. He was promoted to assistant general manager in October 1996. During his tenure, the Giants had an 813–644 overall record (.558), winning an average of 90.3 games per season. He was hired by the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2005. During his tenure with the Dodgers (2005-2014), Colletti had the highest winning percentage of any general manager in the National League. In 2019, Colletti became a scout in the Sharks organization. Career with the Dodgers Colletti became the 10th general manager in Los Angeles Dodgers history and the fifth in eight years when he was hired on November 16, 2005. The Dodgers made the playoffs in five of his nine seasons from 2006–14. Only once in Colletti's nine seasons did the Dodgers have a losing record. Los Angeles went to the NL Division Series in Colletti's first season in 2006 and reached the National League Championship Series in 2008, 2009, and 2013. The back-to-back appearances in 2008–09 marked the first time the Dodgers had reached the NLCS in consecutive years since 1977–78. The Dodgers won 15 playoff games from 1989–2014. Fourteen of those playoff wins came under Colletti. The only other Dodger post-season win in that period came in the 2004 NL Division Series under then-GM Paul DePodesta. During six of Colletti's nine seasons, the Dodgers set home attendance records. The Dodgers averaged 3,606,151 fans per season in Colletti's nine seasons with the Dodgers. The Dodgers led all of Major League Baseball in home and road attendance in 2013 and led, again, in home attendance in 2014 with 3,782,337 fans. In 2010, under Colletti's leadership, the Dodgers were named Topps Organization of the Year, an honor presented annually to the Major League franchise that has shown most- outstanding performance, depth and talent among its Major and Minor League teams. In the nine seasons from the start of Colletti's career as general manager through 2014, the Dodgers had a 783–674 (.537) record—the third-best record in the National League. Only the Cardinals (.542) and Phillies (.538) were better. Among NL West teams, the Dodgers' record during that stretch was 40 games better than second-best San Francisco Giants. Colletti reached 750 wins as a general manager on July 29, 2014, when the Dodgers defeated the Atlanta Braves 3–2 in 10 innings at Dodger Stadium before a crowd of 47,386. Only Buzzie Bavasi reached the 750-win mark faster in Dodger history. His 783 wins from 2006–14 were most among all National League general managers. From June to December 2012, Colletti, with the backing of a new, aggressive ownership team led by Dodgers' president Stan Kasten, owners Mark Walter, Earvin \\"Magic\\" Johnson, Peter Guber, and Guggenheim Baseball Management, spent more than $600 million to bring a parade of all-star players and prospects to Los Angeles. The wholesale makeover began in late June when the Dodgers spent $42 million to sign 21-year-old Cuban prospect Yasiel Puig to a six-year deal. On July 25, Colletti brought in former National League batting champion Hanley Ramírez as the key to a four-player trade with the Miami Marlins. On August 25, 2012, with the Dodgers three games behind the Giants in the National League West and 1½ games out of the final wild card spot, Colletti completed a nine-player trade that the Los Angeles Times called a \\"block-buster\\" and a \\"stunning development\\". Key to the deal was the acquisition of four-time All- Star first baseman Adrián González from the Boston Red Sox. But the Dodgers also obtained the four-time All-Star outfielder Carl Crawford, three-time All- Star pitcher Josh Beckett, and respected, switch-hitting utility infielder Nick Punto. The Red Sox received first-baseman James Loney and four prospects, including infielder Iván DeJesús Jr. and pitcher Allen Webster. The Boston Globe's Dan Shaughnessy called it \\"the biggest Red Sox trade since Babe Ruth was dealt to the Yankees for cash in 1920\\",. After ending the season 86–76, but failing to make the playoffs, the Dodgers were active on the free-agent market, signing starting pitchers Zack Greinke, a former Cy Young winner, and Ryu Hyun-jin, who had been an All-Star in each of his seven seasons in the Korea Baseball Organization from 2006–12. Greinke, who won the Cy Young with Kansas City in 2009, provided the Dodgers with what MLB.com called \\"unprecedented starting pitching depth.\\" On October 14, 2014, he was removed from his position as General Manager of the Dodgers after the Dodgers failed to advance to the World Series despite a 2014 opening day payroll more than $30 million higher than any other MLB team, and $55 million higher than any other National League team. Colletti remained with the team in a new position as Senior Adviser to the President. Following his tenure as the Dodgers' GM, Colletti has become an Emmy winning baseball analyst on SportNet LA,https://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-dodgers-colletti- plaschke-20170706-story.html a full-time professor of Sports Management at Pepperdine University, and a best-selling author with release of his memoir, The Big Chair (Penguin Random House). Combined career as AGM and GM Colletti was a top front office executive – either an assistant general manager (AGM) or general manager (GM) – continuously from 1997 until 2014 with two clubs, the San Francisco Giants and Los Angeles Dodgers. Only five other GMs served continuously, either as an AGM or a GM, from 1997–2014. Of the six GMs who served continuously for the past 18 seasons as assistant general manager or general manager, only Brian Cashman of the New York Yankees had a higher winning percentage. In his last 24 seasons as an executive, Colletti built or helped to build teams that qualified for the postseason 15 times (with five other teams eliminated in the final game or two of the season), made 7 NLCS appearances, and appeared in three World Series with a combined record of 2124-1701 (423 games over .500). During his time with the Dodgers, he and his staff drafted or signed players who won 3 Cy Young Awards, plus three runners-up; 2 Most Valuable Player Awards, plus one runner-up; and two National League Rookies of the Year. San Jose Sharks On September 6, 2019, the San Jose Sharks announced Colletti would join the team as a scout at the National Hockey League and American Hockey League levels. Charity and community work Colletti is active in several community and charity efforts in Los Angeles. He and the Dodgers have partnered with Guide Dogs of America to sponsor lifelong working partners for the visually impaired. In October 2011, Colletti joined radio personality Peter Tilden and Colletti's friends from the band Chicago, who played a benefit concert that raised funds for Guide Dogs of America and the Foundation for Fighting Blindness. Colletti received a prestigious Humanitarian Award from A Place Called Home, located in South Central Los Angeles, which provides at-risk youth with a secure, positive environment. The Los Angeles City College Foundation also honored Colletti for his work with youth.Fox Sports West report On October 23, 2012, the Los Angeles City College Foundation honored Colletti for his work with youth. Vicki Santo, widow of Cubs' Hall of Fame legend Ron Santo, and Colletti established a foundation RonSantoFoundation.com to place service dogs with people suffering from diabetes. The foundation's 45 dogs are trained to alert their human partners when their blood sugar is low, helping prevent sudden, unexpected onsets of hypoglycemia that can be devastating. Colletti also serves on the Advisory Board of Get Lit–Words Ignite,http://getlit.org/who-we- are/#board a non-profit organization committed to providing Los Angeles children with opportunities to develop an appreciation for literature, writing, reading and poetry. From 2011 to 2013, actors Tim Robbins and Helen Mirren worked with Colletti to raise more than $100,000 for the organization. As a California Advisory Board member of Vision To Learn, Colletti works with the organization founded by Austin Beutner to provide eye examinations and free glasses to under-served, urban youth in some of the hardest-to-reach communities. Vision To Learn has screened more than 120,000 children in California, providing over 85,000 with eye exams and more than 65,000 with free glasses.http://visiontolearn.org/index.php/who-we-are/leadership References *Ned Colletti's Dodgers.com biography Category:Living people Category:Baseball people from Illinois Category:East Leyden High School alumni Category:Los Angeles Dodgers executives Category:Major League Baseball general managers Category:Northern Illinois University alumni Category:People from Franklin Park, Illinois Category:San Francisco Giants executives Category:San Jose Sharks scouts Category:Triton College alumni Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Ned Colletti"},{"id":"3413170","text":"Æthelred (or Ethelred; died 30 June 888) was an Anglo-Saxon Archbishop of Canterbury in medieval England. Although one source states that he was Bishop of Wiltshire prior to his elevation to Canterbury, this has been shown to be false. Much of Æthelred's time in office was spent dealing with the dislocations caused by the invasion of England by Vikings. There were also conflicts with King Alfred the Great over ecclesiastical matters as well as the desire of the papacy to reform the English clergy. Biography Some sources, including the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, in the F version of that work, state that Æthelred was transferred in 870 from the Bishopric of Wiltshire to the see of Canterbury. However, the transfer has now been proven to be taken from the life of Ælfric of Abingdon, who was archbishop from 995 to 1005. Although the story of his transfer is false, Æthelred was consecrated as archbishop in 870.Wareham \\"Æthelred\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Why he was selected for Canterbury is unknown, as there is no contemporary information on his election.Brooks Early History of the Church of Canterbury pp. 149–152 Most of Æthelred's time as archbishop was spent dealing with the effects of Viking raids, but he also had a conflict with King Alfred the Great over royal control of ecclesiastical affairs. It was during Æthelred's archbishopric that the Golden Gospels, a still-surviving 8th century gospel book, was ransomed from a raiding army and donated to Canterbury. Pope John VIII also urged Æthelred and Archbishop Wulfhere of York to reform the dress of the English clergy. The Anglo-Saxon clergy wore the short tunic that was the normal costume of the laypeople of Britain. The Roman custom, however, was to wear long clerical robes or habits, and the Anglo-Saxon custom was opposed by the papacy and other continental clergy. Whether Æthelred and Wulfred took steps to try to change the dress of their clergy is unknown, but the clothing customs of the Anglo-Saxon clergy did not change. Around 877, Æthelred wrote to Pope John VIII to complain about King Alfred's conduct towards Canterbury. The exact nature of the dispute is not clear, but the reply from the pope to the archbishop still exists. The pope told the archbishop that Canterbury had papal support and that the pope had written to the king urging the king to respect the rights of the archbishop.Abels Alfred the Great p. 244 The writer Justin Pollard sees this letter as evidence of papal support for the deposition of Alfred, which Pollard alleges occurred at Christmas 878 and that the deposition was supported by Æthelred.Pollard Alfred the Great pp. 160–166 Other historians, however, do not agree that there was a deposition of the king supported by the archbishop at this time.Wormald \\"Alfred\\" Oxford Dictionary of National BiographyAbels Alfred the Great pp. 150–155 Æthelred also reached an agreement with Ælfred, an ealdorman, where Ælfred was granted the life use of a Canterbury estate in return for bequeathing one of his estates to Canterbury after his death. The document that records this agreement is not dated, however, so it is unknown when exactly during Æthelred's episcopate the document was drawn up. Another problem for the archbishop was a decline in the abilities of the scribes at Canterbury, which is dramatically illustrated by the document, which has a number of errors and duplications. Other documents of the period show that some of the scribes had little knowledge of Latin.Brooks Early History of the Church of Canterbury pp. 172–173 Æthelred died 30 June 888.Fryde, et al.

He may have been a hermit before he became archbishop in 890. As archbishop, he reorganised the Diocese of Winchester, creating four new sees, and worked with other scholars in translating religious works. He was canonised after his death. Early life Little is known of the early life of Plegmund except that he was of Mercian descent. A later tradition, dating 300 years after his death,Brooks Early History of the Church of Canterbury pp. 153–154 stated that Plegmund lived as a hermit at Plemstall in Cheshire.Wareham \\"Plegemund\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography His reputation as a scholarHindley Brief History of the Anglo-Saxons pp. 215–217 attracted the attention of King Alfred the Great, who was trying to revive scholarship.Keynes \\"Plegmund\\" Blackwell Encyclopedia of Anglo-Saxon England Some time before 887, Alfred summoned Plegmund to his court. There he worked with three other scholars – Wærferth, Bishop of Worcester, Æthelstan and Wærwulf – on translating Pope Gregory the Great's treatise Pastoral Care into Old English. Archbishop of Canterbury Plegmund was selected for the see of Canterbury in 890 by King Alfred.Stenton Anglo-Saxon England pp. 270–271 His election to the Archbishopric of Canterbury is recorded in Manuscript E of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle: \\"Here Archbishop Plegmund was elected by God and all the people.\\"Swanton (trans.) Anglo-Saxon Chronicle pp. 82–83 Fulk, Archbishop of Reims, praised the election of Plegmund, stating that he would help root out the last remnants of paganism in the people.Duckett Alfred the Great p. 113 However, there was a gap in time between the death of the previous Archbishop of Canterbury, Ethelred, and the consecration of Plegmund; this may have been because the see had been offered to Grimbald, a Flemish monk and scholar, who refused it.Abels Alfred the Great p. 224 Plegmund was granted his pallium by Pope Formosus. During the 9th century, the see of Canterbury was at a low point. One of Plegmund's responsibilities was to re-establish its authority, and, in an attempt to do this, between 909 and 918 he created new sees within the existing Diocese of Winchester in Crediton, Ramsbury, Sherborne and Wells. This meant that each future shire of Wessex had its own bishop; of Crediton for Devon and Cornwall, of Ramsbury for Wiltshire, of Sherborne for Dorset and of Wells for Somerset, as well as the diocese of Winchester for Hampshire.Stafford Unification and Conquest p. 182 To do this, Plegmund had to gain the approval of Pope Sergius III, who had annulled all of the acts of Pope Formosus, and in 908 Plegmund travelled to Rome so that he could be re-granted his pallium. He was the first archbishop of Canterbury to visit Rome for nearly a century, and he returned with the relics of Saint Blaise. Under Plegmund's archbishopric, the quality of the Latin used by his scribes improved, surpassing the poor quality used by the scribes of the previous two archbishops, Ceolnoth and Æthelred. When Alfred died in 899, Plegmund crowned his son Edward as king. In addition to his religious duties, Plegmund was involved in matters of state and he attended the formal councils held by Edward the Elder in 901, 903, 904 and 909. He dedicated the tall tower of the New Minster at Winchester in 909. Death and legacy Plegmund died on 2 August 914 or 2 August 923.Fryde, et al.

The founder of the Nationalist Party, he soon gravitated toward the Saavedrista faction of the Republican Party, which had come to power in 1920. Chosen by President Saavedra to be his successor in 1926, Siles ran on a ticket that included the latter's brother, Abdon Saavedra, as his vice-presidential running mate. This formula won the elections, and Siles Reyes was sworn in August, 1926. Soon, he came to be regarded as one of the most charismatic Bolivian politicians in recent memory, especially when he broke openly with the domineering ex-President Bautista Saavedra, and exiled him along with his brother (hitherto Siles's own Vice-President). Despite all this, the Siles government soon ran into economic and political difficulties associated with the far-reaching effects of the \\"crash\\" of 1929. Moreover, his term was marked by rising diplomatic tensions with neighboring Paraguay which would later lead to the Chaco War. Many more opponents were exiled, giving Siles some breathing room, but matters reached a breaking point when, in 1930, the President attempted to unilaterally increase his term in office, ostensibly to deal with the mounting economic and international crisis. This was all his opponents needed, and with a coup d'état clearly in the offing, Siles resigned on May 28, 1930, leaving his cabinet in charge. The latter was overthrown by General Carlos Blanco, who in 1931 called elections which were won by Daniel Salamanca of the Partido Republicano-Genuino.

Given the low status of the papacy at the time, it is unlikely that the impetus for the change in tradition came from the pope.Brooks Early History of the Church of Canterbury pp. 216–222 Wulfhelm died while archbishop on 12 February 941. During his time as archbishop, he received as gifts two gospels that are still extant, as Wulfhelm donated them to Christ Church. One of the gospels was produced in Ireland, the other either in Lotharingia or Germany. The second gospel may originally have been a gift to Æthelstan during the negotiations over the marriage of Æthelstan's sister Edith to the future Emperor Otto I. These diplomatic events probably explain the appearance of Wulfhelm's name in the confraternity books of some German monasteries. He may also have given land to the church, although the record is a bit unclear as to exactly what was given. Another grant of land was of land at Deverel, Wiltshire to Glastonbury Abbey while he was archbishop. Wulfhelm was buried at Canterbury.Robinson Saxon Bishops of Wells p. 42 He was buried at first the church of St John the Baptist near the Saxon-era Canterbury Cathedral. When a new cathedral was constructed under Archbishop Lanfranc after the Norman Conquest of England, the earlier archbishops of Canterbury were moved to the north transept of the new cathedral. Later, Wulfhelm and his predecessor as bishop and archbishop Athelm were moved to a chapel dedicated to St Benedict, which later was incorporated into the Lady Chapel constructed by Prior Thomas Goldstone (d. 1468).Robinson Saxon Bishops of Wells pp. 58–59 Notes Citations References   External links * Category:Archbishops of Canterbury Category:Bishops of Wells Category:10th-century archbishops Category:941 deaths Category:Year of birth unknown ","title":"Wulfhelm"},{"id":"3413213","text":"El Mirage Lake is a dry lake bed in the northwestern Victor Valley of the central Mojave Desert, within San Bernardino County, California. The lake is located about west-northwest of the town of Adelanto and north of Highway 18 in San Bernardino County. The dry lake, at an elevation of , is approximately long. El Mirage Off-Highway Vehicle Recreation Area Ultralight aircraft at El Mirage Dry Lake Formerly open to all visitors, it has been a popular spot for many activities ranging from gyrocopter and ultralight aircraft operations to automobile racing. The Bureau of Land Management has installed a fence to enclose the lake and some of the surrounding areas, and now charges fees for entry to what is now known as the El Mirage Off-Highway Vehicle (OHV) Recreation Area. It is a popular filming location for automobile commercials. Permits for the Recreation Area can be purchased on-site, at local retailers and online. Annual permits are $90, weekly permits are $30, and daily permits are $15.El Mirage Permits Private aircraft may still land on the lakebed. For 50 years the lakebed has been used by the Southern California Timing Association for timed speed runs. The club also operates the Bonneville Salt Flats speed runs. Climate El Mirage Lakebed experiences a desert climate, with cool winters and hot summers. Due to the lakebed's aridity and high elevation, the diurnal temperature variation is substantial. Though summer days can be very hot, summer nighttime temperatures are cool. The lakebed receives an occasional dusting of snow in the winter months, however, snowfall usually melts within 24 hours.

May 1920 The Banque Industrielle de Chine, or Industrial Bank of China, was chartered in 1913 and was closed in 1922. The bank's Chinese office was in Shanghai and its European office in Paris. Its chief director was A.J. Pernotte. In the beginning of the 1920s riots in China stopped payments of the Chinese borrowers. French investors complained, and André Berthelot, one of the administrator of the bank, asked the French minister of foreign affairs, Aristide Briand, to find a solution since the bank was a joint project of the French the Chinese governments and had been financed by several French companies. The newly elected Paul Doumer had been helped by the extreme right in his political campaign. Doumer had personnel interests in the Banque d'Indochine, the main competitor of Banque Industrielle de Chine. Berthelot, one of the administrator of the bank, was the son of an atheist chemist and a former minister who had supported Dreyfus. Doumer exploited the situation with extreme-right newspapers to explain that Berthelot was the brother of the General Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Philippe Berthelot, and asked for the removal of both Berthelot and, more importantly, Briand. However, an investigation proved that both had acted fairly, and Berthelot gained the full support of everyone else and was supported by the majority of the Senate. Paradoxically, Briand was helped by the affair. The bank did not go bankrupt but was closed, and its funds were injected in other banks.

The son of a clergyman, he studied canon law and theology at Bologna and was tutor to Pope Eugene III's nephew before returning to England to serve successive bishops of Exeter. After becoming a Cistercian monk he was named abbot of his monastery at Forde and subsequently elected to the episcopate at Worcester. Before becoming a bishop, he wrote theological works and sermons, some of which have survived. As a bishop, Baldwin came to the attention of King Henry II of England, who was so impressed he insisted that Baldwin become archbishop. In that office, Baldwin quarrelled with his cathedral clergy over the founding of a church, which led to the imprisonment of the clergy in their cloister for more than a year. Baldwin spent some time in Wales with Gerald of Wales, preaching and raising money for the Third Crusade. After the coronation of King Richard I, the new king sent Baldwin ahead to the Holy Land, where he became embroiled in the politics of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Baldwin died in the Holy Land while participating in the crusade; his long-running dispute with his clergy led one chronicler to characterise Baldwin as more damaging to Christianity than Saladin. Ecclesiastical career Born in Exeter around 1125, Baldwin was the son of Hugh d'Eu, Archdeacon of Totnes, and a woman of unknown name who later became a nun. Gervase of Canterbury's story that he was from an even humbler background has been shown by modern scholarship to stem from bias on the medieval chronicler's part.Holdsworth \\"Baldwin\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography It is possible that he studied at Bologna in the 1150s with the future Pope Urban III.Bartlett England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings p. 509Barlow Thomas Becket p. 37 Robert Warelwast, who was Bishop of Exeter from 1138 to 1155, had sent Baldwin to Italy to study law.Barlow \\"Warelwast, Robert de\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Baldwin was also said to have taught at Exeter, although this is not substantiated by any contemporary record.Morey Bartholomew of Exeter pp. 105–109 In 1150 or 1151 Pope Eugene III appointed him tutor to Eugene's nephew. By 1155 Baldwin seems to have returned to England, where he joined the household of Robert of Chichester, Bishop of Exeter. Baldwin attracted the attention of Bartholomew Iscanus, Bishop of Exeter, who made him archdeacon at Totnes in about 1161,Knowles Monastic Order pp. 316–324 after Baldwin's father's death. Baldwin was known as a canon lawyer during his holding of Totnes.Barlow Thomas Becket p. 184 He received a letter from John of Salisbury in 1167, complaining about Bartholomew's conduct during the Becket controversy. John accused Bartholomew of not properly supporting Thomas Becket the Archbishop of Canterbury in his dispute with the king, urging Baldwin to influence the bishop to increase his support, and not to sign any appeal by the English bishops against Becket.Knowles Episcopal Colleagues p. 103 Other letters from John dealt with rumours concerning Roger, the Bishop of Worcester, who John had heard was speaking badly of Becket. John's purpose seems to have been to have Baldwin pass along a warning from Becket to Roger about his behaviour; John was a supporter of Becket's during the latter's exile.Cheney Roger of Worcester p. 36 In 1169 Baldwin was once again peripherally involved in the Becket dispute, when he objected to Becket's excommunication of a number of noblemen and clergy for opposing Becket's cause. Baldwin's objection was not so much that they were excommunicated, but that no warning had been given that such an action was contemplated. Baldwin became a monk in about 1170, and then abbot of the Cistercian monastery of Forde.Knowles, et al. Heads of Religious Houses p. 132 Greenway Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066–1300: Volume 2: Monastic Cathedrals (Northern and Southern Provinces): Worcester: Bishops He was well known as a canonist,Warren Henry II p. 552 and often acted as a judge-delegate for the papacy, hearing cases that had reached the Roman Curia and been remanded to local experts for decision.Barlow Thomas Becket p. 90 In 1166, Baldwin was the addressee of a work by John of Salisbury, Expectiatione longa, which was one of the tracts written during the Becket controversy.Barlow Thomas Becket pp. 155–157 It was probably at this time that Baldwin wrote De sacramento altaris. In 1175 he served with his old bishop, Bartholomew, as joint papal judge in a dispute between Malmesbury Abbey and Josceline de Bohon, the Bishop of Salisbury.Morey Bartholomew of Exeter p. 36 In 1178 he was recommended to Pope Alexander as a possible candidate for a cardinalship, but this never occurred. Baldwin became Bishop of Worcester on 10 August 1180.Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 278 While at Worcester, he impressed King Henry II by intervening in a secular case to prevent a hanging on a Sunday.Warren Henry II p. 554 Although the medieval writer Walter Map said that Baldwin was determined to continue writing even after his election to the bishopric, none of Baldwin's writings can be dated to his time as bishop except for one sermon. Archbishop of Canterbury Baldwin was translated from the see of Worcester to the see of Canterbury in December 1184,Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 232 after Henry II let it be known that he would accept only Baldwin at Canterbury; the previous incumbent, Richard of Dover, had died in April that year.Warren Henry II p. 555 The monks put forward three candidates from within Christ Church Priory: Odo, who had been prior of Christ Church and was then Abbot of Battle Abbey, Peter de Leia, a Cluniac prior of Wenlock Priory and later Bishop of St David's, and Theobald, Abbot of Cluny, but none of them found favour with the English bishops. Instead, the prelates selected the king's choice, Baldwin. The selection of Baldwin took place only after a dispute between the members of the cathedral chapter of Canterbury and the suffragan bishops of Canterbury, both of whom claimed the right to elect the new archbishop.Young Hubert Walter p. 12 Baldwin received his pallium from Pope Lucius III along with Lucius' approval of his translation.Duggan \\"From the Conquest to the Death of John\\" English Church and the Papacy p. 73 Baldwin was named a papal legate in 1185, although his authority was limited to his own archdiocese and did not extend into the Archdiocese of York.Robinson Papacy p. 173 =Dispute with Christ Church Priory= During his time as archbishop there was a dispute with the monks of Christ Church Priory in Canterbury, who resented Baldwin's attempts to impose stricter control over them and disputed the legitimacy of Baldwin's election. For his part, Baldwin did not approve of the luxurious and pampered life the monks of Christ Church lived,Poole Domesday Book to Magna Carta p. 221 and felt that they profited too much from the cult of Thomas Becket.Barlow Thomas Becket p. 271 The dispute escalated when Baldwin deprived the monks of some of the revenues of their monastic estates. After that, Baldwin proposed to establish a church dedicated to Becket in Canterbury itself, staffed by secular rather than monastic clergy. The monks of the cathedral chapter saw this proposed foundation as the first step in an attempt to change the see of Canterbury from a monastic cathedral chapter, a peculiarity of the English Church, to the more normal pattern of secular clergy. It is not clear if Baldwin himself intended such a plan, but the other bishops supported the effort, as contemporary writers made clear. Baldwin sought the advice of Hugh, the Bishop of Lincoln, who advised Baldwin to abandon the plan as it would only cause distress to all parties. The controversy was long and involved and, at one point, the monks were imprisoned within their own buildings for a year and a half, from January 1188 to August 1189. This led to the suspension of the liturgy in the cathedral. Eventually all the prominent ecclesiastics and monastic houses of Europe were forced into choosing sides in the dispute. In October 1189, in an attempt to gain control, Baldwin appointed Roger Norreys as the chapter's prior, an appointment widely acknowledged by contemporaries as putting a useless individual into the office. His plan for financing the church involved soliciting contributions from donors by promising a one-third reduction in penances for annual donations.Little Religious Poverty p. 32 King Henry II of England =Service to King Henry= In 1188 King Henry II of England called for a tax to support the Third Crusade, following the fall of Jerusalem to Saladin in 1187.Warren Henry II pp. 607–608 It was collected at the rate of a tenth of all the property and income of any person not vowing to go on crusade.Lyon Constitutional and Legal History p. 269 It was popularly known as the \\"Saladin tithe\\" and was the most extensive tax ever collected in England up to that point.Powell and Wallis House of Lords p. 89 Being a tithe and not a secular tax, it was collected by dioceses rather than by shires. Baldwin especially was blamed for its harshness,Poole Domesday Book to Magna Carta p. 296 although in February, along with his advisor Peter of Blois, he was in Normandy with the king.Southern \\"Peter of Blois\\" Studies in Medieval History p. 209 Baldwin took the cross, or vowed to go on crusade, along with King Henry and many others in January 1188, or when he began his preaching campaign on 11 February 1188 to drum up support for the Third Crusade.Tyerman God's War p. 378 In April 1188, Baldwin was in Wales on a tour attempting to secure support for the king's crusade, and was forcing his servants and followers to exercise on foot up and down hills in preparation for the journey to the Holy Land.Tyerman England and the Crusades pp. 60–61 He spent most of the year in Wales, preaching the crusade, accompanied by the chronicler Gerald of Wales. Gerald claimed about 3000 recruits for the crusade from his and Baldwin's efforts in Wales,Tyerman England and the Crusades p. 161 although he also suggested that Baldwin mainly embarked on the tour to avoid his dispute with the Canterbury monks.Tyerman God's War p. 393 A side effect of Baldwin's tour of Wales was the implied assertion of royal authority in a section of Henry's domains that had always been somewhat fractious. Baldwin was also asserting his ecclesiastical authority over the Welsh bishops, especially when he made a point of celebrating mass at every Welsh cathedral; he was the first Archbishop of Canterbury to celebrate mass at St Asaph's Cathedral. Baldwin excommunicated the only Welsh prince who refused to appear before him and take the cross, Owain Cyfeiliog.Tyerman God's War p. 385 Baldwin was with King Henry shortly before the latter's death, taking part in unsuccessful efforts to negotiate a truce with Henry's heir, Prince Richard, who had rebelled against his father.Gillingham Richard I p. 97 After Henry's death, Richard sought and obtained absolution for the sin of disobedience to his father from both Baldwin and Walter de Coutances, Archbishop of Rouen.Gillingham Richard I p. 104 Baldwin, along with Coutances, was with Richard on 20 July 1189 at Rouen when the king was invested with the Duchy of Normandy.Turner and Heiser Reign of Richard Lionheart p. 73 Baldwin crowned Richard at Westminster Abbey on 13 September 1189 in the first English coronation for which a detailed description survives.Gillingham Richard I p. 107 Baldwin crowned Richard I, perhaps better known as Richard the Lionheart, in 1189. This effigy is from Fontevraud Abbey, Anjou, France and was created shortly after Richard's death in 1199. =Under Richard= After the death of Henry II, and the accession of Richard as king, the monks of Christ Church Priory petitioned Richard to intercede in the long-running dispute between them and the archbishop. In November 1189, Richard and the whole court, including the Queen Mother Eleanor of Aquitaine, travelled to Canterbury in an attempt to end the controversy before the papacy become involved.Gillingham Richard I pp. 110–111 Richard finally settled the dispute by persuading Baldwin to abandon his church- building project and to dismiss Norreys. Soon after this, Richard left England and Baldwin declared that he was going to found the proposed church at Lambeth, and then join Richard on crusade. Both Richard and Baldwin agreed to appoint Norreys to Evesham Abbey, as the previous abbot of Evesham, Adam of Evesham, had recently died. This appointment eventually led, after Baldwin's death, to the Case of Evesham.Knowles Monastic Order pp. 331–333 In August 1189 Baldwin objected to the marriage of Prince John, later King John, to Isabel of Gloucester, on the grounds of consanguinity. John promised to obtain a papal dispensation, but never did so.Bartlett England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings p. 557 Baldwin laid John's lands under interdict, but it was lifted by a papal legate who declared the marriage legal. Richard also restored to the archbishops of Canterbury the right to operate a mint, staffed by three moneyers.Young Hubert Walter p. 76 Third Crusade In April 1190 Baldwin left England with Richard on the Third Crusade. Leading the English advance guard,Tyerman England and the Crusades p. 57 Baldwin left Marseilles ahead of Richard together with Hubert Walter and Ranulf de Glanvill. The group sailed directly to Syria on 5 August 1190.Young Hubert Walter pp. 33–36Tyerman England and the Crusades pp. 66–69 Baldwin delegated the administration of his spiritualities and temporalities to Gilbert Glanvill, the Bishop of Rochester, but entrusted any archiepiscopal authority to Richard FitzNeal, the Bishop of London. The custom of giving the archiepiscopal authority to London had originated in Archbishop Lanfranc's time.Young Hubert Walter pp. 94–95 Baldwin continued to conduct some ecclesiastical business however, dealing with the suspended Hugh Nonant, the Bishop of Coventry. Baldwin had suspended Nonant in March 1190 for holding secular office as sheriff, but Baldwin wrote to FitzNeal after his departure that Nonant had agreed to relinquish his secular offices.Franklin \\"Nonant, Hugh de\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Baldwin and his group arrived at Tyre on 16 September 1190. Richard did not arrive in Syria until 1191.Bartlett England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings p. 115 It is unclear exactly why they were sent ahead of the king; perhaps it was to look out for the king's interests while Richard took a more leisurely route, or perhaps to rid the king's entourage of a family grouping around Glanvill that the king did not trust. Baldwin was not a member or close associate of the Glanvill faction, so most likely he was sent ahead to look after the king's interests, whatever the reasons for the inclusion of his companions. Another concern may have been to get help to the Kingdom of Jerusalem as quickly as possible after the king learned of Frederick Barbarossa's death on the way to the Holy Land.Tyerman God's War p. 441 When Baldwin arrived at Acre on 12 October 1190, the Muslim forces in the city were under siege by the Frankish forces led by King Guy of Lusignan and Queen Sibylla of Jerusalem,Tyerman God's War pp. 409–410 who in turn were being besieged by Saladin. Soon after Baldwin's arrival, there was a succession crisis in the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Sibylla, a first cousin of Henry II, and her two young daughters all died in July from an epidemic ravaging the siege camp where they were living. This left Guy without a legal claim to the kingdom as he had held the kingship through his wife. The heiress to the kingdom was Sibylla's half-sister Isabella; she was already married to Humphrey IV of Toron, but he was loyal to Guy and seems to have had no ambition to be king. A more promising candidate for the throne was Conrad of Montferrat, uncle of the last undisputed king, Baldwin V. Conrad had saved the kingdom from destruction by leading the successful defence of Tyre, and had the support of Isabella's mother Maria Comnena and stepfather Balian of Ibelin. Maria and Balian abducted Isabella from Humphrey, and compelled her to seek an annulment, so that she could be married to Conrad and enable him to claim the kingship.Gillingham Richard I pp. 148–149 Baldwin supported Guy's claim, but Ubaldo, Archbishop of Pisa, Philip of Dreux, Bishop of Beauvais, and Eraclius, Patriarch of Jerusalem, supported Conrad. Isabella and Humphrey's marriage was forcibly annulled. Baldwin, already ailing, attempted to excommunicate everyone involved in the annulment, but he died on 19 November 1190. He wrote his will shortly before his death, and died surrounded by his followers on the crusade.Tyerman England and the Crusades p. 179 Hubert Walter assumed the leadership of the English forces, and also became Baldwin's executor. Walter paid the wages of some soldiers and knights from Baldwin's estate, and distributed the rest of the money to the poor.Tyerman England and the Crusades p. 63 Writings and studies De sacramento altaris, dealing with the eucharist and passover, is Baldwin's longest surviving work, in 12 manuscripts. It also includes a discussion of martyrdom that reads much like a vindication of Becket's status as a martyr.Smalley Becket Conflict pp. 218–220 It was first printed in 1662, and has more recently been edited and published in the series Sources Chrétiennes, as volumes 93 and 94, in 1963. Others works include 22 sermons, and a work on faith, De commendatione fidei, that only survives in two manuscripts, although another five are known to have existed. One of the missing manuscripts survived until at least the mid-1600s, as it formed the basis of the first printed edition of De commendatione fidei in 1662.Freeland and Bell \\"Introduction\\" Baldwin of Forde p. 13 The modern critical edition of De commendatione was published, along with the sermons, in 1991 as Balduini de Forda Opera: Sermones, De Commendatione Fidei.Freeland and Bell \\"Introduction\\" Baldwin of Forde p. 11 with the De commendatione fidei translated into English in 2000.Freeland and Bell \\"Introduction\\" Baldwin of Forde Renowned for his preaching, Baldwin's surviving sermons show that interest in them continued after his death.Cheney From Becket to Langton pp. 28–29 His sermons were first published in 1662; the modern edition includes two more (titled de obedientia and de sancta cruce) that were not in the original publication. It appears that originally there were 33 sermons, with the others now lost. The sermons survive in 12 manuscripts, although only 5 are collections of substantial numbers of the works. None of the surviving manuscripts has a complete collection of the 22 sermons.Bell \\"Introduction\\" Baldvini de Forda Opera p. vii Baldwin also collaborated with Bartholomew Iscanus on a Liber penitentialis, which is jointly ascribed to both of them in a Lambeth Palace manuscript, MS 235. Another work often attributed to Baldwin, the Ad laudem Bartholomaei Exoniensis episcopi de coloribus rhetoricis, survives in three manuscripts and a fragment of a fourth. A number of other works are known to have been authored by Baldwin, but do not survive. These include Carmen devotionis, which was seen by John Bale at Glastonbury Abbey in the 16th century. Other lost works were a commentary on the biblical books of Samuel and Kings, De sectis haereticis which existed at Christ Church Priory in the 13th century, and De orthodoxis fidei dogmatibus, which was seen by John Leland at Christ Church in the 16th century. Some of Baldwin's letters existed in manuscript form, although they appear never to have circulated as a collection, but they are no longer extant. One of his letters is mentioned in a Rievaulx Abbey catalogue, and Leland mentions others in his works. Besides Baldwin's own writings, there is a decretal collection known as the Collectio Wigorniensis, still extant in manuscript (MS) form. It now resides in the British Library as Royal MS 10.A.ii. This collection may have belonged to Baldwin. It was probably compiled at Worcester Cathedral before December 1184, when Baldwin went to Canterbury, and besides a basic collection of Pope Alexander III's decretals it includes a number of letters from the papacy addressed to Baldwin as Bishop of Worcester and as Archbishop of Canterbury. Although the main contents are unexceptional, the compiler of the work numbered the books and capitula into which the work was divided, an innovation that allowed for much more efficient use of the collection. It is likely that the compiler was one of Baldwin's clerks, and that this testified to Baldwin's continuing interest in canon law.Cheney Roger of Worcester pp. 197–200 The manuscript itself was likely owned either by Baldwin himself or a member of his household.Duggan Twelfth-century Decretal Collections pp. 114–115 The historian Frank Barlow stated that Baldwin was \\"one of the greatest English decretalists\\". His work was more influential in his inspiration and support for the development of decretal collections, rather than in terms of the actual influence of his judicial decisions themselves.Duggan Twelfth-century Decretal Collections pp. 118–119 Another collection of writings associated with Baldwin is the correspondence relating to his dispute with the Christ Church monks. The documents relating to this dispute, which dragged on into the archbishopric of Hubert Walter, are published in one whole volume of the Rolls Series, which was edited by the Victorian historian William Stubbs.Brooke English Church & the Papacy pp. 224–225 Reputation Baldwin's long-running dispute with his cathedral chapter caused the chronicler Gervase of Canterbury to characterise him as \\"a greater enemy to Christianity than Saladin.\\"Quoted in Gillingham Richard I pp. 119–120 Another contemporary, Gerald of Wales, praised Baldwin as \\"distinguished for his learning and religion\\",Quoted in Smalley Becket Conflict p. 218 but also claimed that he was gloomy and nervous. Herbert of Bosham dedicated his History of Thomas, a story of Thomas Becket, to the archbishop in the late 1180s.Barlow Thomas Becket p. 263 The historian A. L. Poole called Baldwin a \\"distinguished scholar and deeply religious man, [but he] was injudicious and too austere to be a good leader.\\" Baldwin was also known as a theologian, as well as being a canon lawyer.Knowles Monastic Order p. 645 His clerk and nephew, Joseph of Exeter, accompanied Baldwin on the crusade, and wrote two works after his return to England: Antiocheis, an epic poem about King Richard on crusade, and De Bello Trojano, a rewriting of the Trojan War.Mortimer Angevin England p. 210 Notes Citations References            Further reading * * Category:1120s births Category:1190 deaths Category:12th-century Roman Catholic archbishops Category:Anglo-Normans Category:Archbishops of Canterbury Category:Archdeacons of Totnes Category:Bishops of Worcester Category:Christians of the Third Crusade Category:English Cistercians Category:English abbots Category:People from Exeter Category:12th-century English people ","title":"Baldwin of Forde"},{"id":"3413289","text":"Melba High School is a public high school in Melba, Idaho.

A member of an Anglo-Norman noble family, he was the son of a bishop, and was educated in Italy. He was a household clerk for Thomas Becket, but by 1167 he was serving King Henry II of England. He was also a favourite of King Louis VII of France, who had him appointed abbot of the Abbey of Corbeil. After Reginald angered Becket while attempting to help negotiate a settlement between Becket and the king, Becket called him \\"that offspring of fornication, that enemy to the peace of the Church, that traitor.\\"Quoted in Warren Henry II p. 535 When he was elected as a bishop, the election was challenged by King Henry's eldest son, Henry the Young King, and Reginald was forced to go to Rome to be confirmed by Pope Alexander III. He attended the Third Lateran Council in 1179, and spent much of his time administering his diocese. He was elected Archbishop of Canterbury in 1191, but died before he could be installed. Early life Stained glass window from Canterbury Cathedral depicting Thomas Becket, who Reginald served briefly. Reginald was the son of Josceline de Bohon, the Bishop of Salisbury, although he was possibly born before his father became a priest.Warren Henry II p. 535 Reginald was a great-great-grandson of Humphrey de Bohun, one of the companions of William the Conqueror.Spear \\"Norman Empire and the Secular Clergy\\" Journal of British Studies p. 4 Some sources say that he was born while his father was studying law in Italy. His uncle Richard de Bohon was Bishop of Coutances from 1151 to 1180.Barlow Thomas Becket p. 78 He was also related to Robert, Earl of Gloucester.Duggan \\"Reginald fitz Jocelin\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Savaric FitzGeldewin, Reginald's successor at Bath, was Reginald's father's second cousin. Reginald's mother may have a member of the family of the counts of Maurienne. He was born and brought up in Italy, which led to him sometimes being referred to as Reginald Italus, Reginald Lombardus or Reginald the Lombard. He was appointed Archdeacon of Wiltshire by his father before 8 December 1161, when he first signed a document as archdeacon.Greenway Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066–1300: Volume 4: Salisbury: Archdeacons of Wiltshire He served in Thomas Becket's household after Becket became archbishop, and by June 1164 was serving Becket's interests in France at both the court of the French King Louis VII and the papal Curia. It was probably in November 1164 that Louis named Reginald abbot of the Abbey of Corbeil.Barlow Thomas Becket p. 107 Reginald probably studied at Paris sometime during 1163 or 1164, as he had a letter of introduction from Pope Alexander III to Hugues de Champfleury, Bishop of Soissons, the chancellor of Louis VII. Reginald did not complete his studies for the title of master, however, as he was in service with the King of England by 1167. He served King Henry II as a royal messenger to Rome during the crisis with Becket in 1167. For the next four years, Reginald would be embroiled in the dispute and with trying to find a diplomatic solution to it.Barlow Thomas Becket p. 175 While serving Henry, Reginald incurred Becket's displeasure enough that Becket called Reginald \\"that offspring of fornication, that enemy to the peace of the Church, that traitor.\\" However, John of Salisbury always maintained friendly relations with both Reginald and his father, even though John was a partisan of Becket's. Reginald took part in the negotiations in August and September 1169 that attempted to reach a settlement between Henry and Becket. These negotiations included papal nuncios and most of the Norman bishops and prominent abbots, as well as the royal clerks. However, the negotiations came to nothing, and led to Becket's castigation of Reginald.Barlow Thomas Becket pp. 189–92 Reginald was one of the main clerics working for King Henry during the dispute with Becket, along with John of Oxford, Richard of Ilchester, and Geoffrey Ridel. Henry's plans to reward the four with bishoprics in late 1170 probably precipitated the final crisis that led to Becket's murder.Barlow Thomas Becket pp. 223–4 Bishop of Bath Reginald was elected Bishop of Bath in late April 1173, and was consecrated 23 June 1174.Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 228 However, Henry the Young King challenged the election, on the grounds of illegitimacy and an uncanonical election. Reginald went to Rome in the company of Richard of Dover, who had just been elected Archbishop of Canterbury and was facing a challenge from the Young King to his election. Reginald was confirmed by Pope Alexander III on 18 April 1174Greenway Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066–1300: Volume 7: Bath and Wells: Bishops with Walter Map alleging bribery as the only reason the election was confirmed. Ralph de Diceto, however, states that Reginald swore an oath that he was uninvolved in the death of Becket and that his birth took place before his father became a priest. During the dispute, Reginald's friend Peter of Blois wrote him a letter, which is still extant, encouraging him to persevere.Wahlgren \\"Peter of Blois\\" English Historical Review pp. 1202–4 As a bishop, Reginald was kept busy attending the king's councils and the royal court, but also took part in the 1178 mission to Toulouse, led by Cardinal Pierre of San Crisogono, which attempted to deal with the Cathar heretics there. He attended the Third Lateran Council in 1179. During the 1180s, he was more active in the affairs of his diocese, and appears less often in the secular affairs of the kingdom, but in 1189 he took part in the coronation of King Richard I of England. In April 1191 he was one of the persons selected to arbitrate between the chancellor William Longchamp and Prince John of England.Powell and Wallis House of Lords p. 97 He also attended the trial of William Longchamp on 5 October 1191 at Loddon Bridge between Reading and Windsor that dismissed Longchamp from his offices.Barlow Feudal Kingdom p. 375 He may have been an unsuccessful candidate for the chancellorship of England. He was active as a bishop: some 122 acta from his time as bishop survive. He built the hospital of St. John in Bath, as well as building extensively at Wells Cathedral and starting the construction of the Bishop's Palace. He also issued a confirmation of the status of the town of Wells. Archbishop of Canterbury Baldwin of Forde, the archbishop of Canterbury, died in 1190, while on Crusade in Palestine. Early in 1191, King Richard wrote to the cathedral chapter of Canterbury, which was composed of monks, not regular clergy, to recommend the election of William, who was Archbishop of Monreale, but this idea was not acted upon by the monks. In the autumn, William Longchamp, the chancellor, was driven from the kingdom by Walter de Coutances, who had been sent by the king to deal with the issue of Longchamp's misgovernment, and Prince John. Walter then turned to the issue of the vacant see of Canterbury, and ordered an election to take place on 2 December, and several bishops as well as Prince John and Walter arrived early at Canterbury.Wahlgren \\"Peter of Blois\\" English Historical Review pp. 1204–5 But Reginald was elected to the Archbishopric of Canterbury on 27 November 1191, by the monks. His election was an attempt by the monks to prevent a candidate unacceptable to them being forced on them, and his election was contested by Walter, who appealed to the papacy, and the monks counterappealed. Reginald's death on 26 December 1191Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 232 stopped the controversy and appeals. Reginald was probably chosen by the monks because he had supported the monks of Canterbury against their archbishop Baldwin of Forde in their dispute over the foundation of a church dedicated to Saint Thomas Becket. He died at Dogmersfield, Hampshire, and was buried at Bath. Before his death, he was admitted as a confrater of Christ Church Priory, Canterbury, and was buried in the habit of a Benedictine monk.Knowles Monastic Order pp. 477–8 According to a monk of Eynsham Abbey, after Reginald's death \\"he performed miraculous cures for certain weak and sick people.\\"Quoted in Bartlett England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings p. 607 The same source claimed Reginald wore a hair shirt under his episcopal vestments.Bartlett England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings p. 607 Notes Citations References     Further reading * Reginald Fitz Jocelin Category:12th-century Roman Catholic archbishops Category:Bishops of Bath Category:Archdeacons of Wilts Category:Anglo-Normans Reginald Category:1191 deaths Category:Year of birth unknown ","title":"Reginald Fitz Jocelin"},{"id":"3413311","text":"Ballinamallard Placenames NI Placenames Database of Ireland (Flanagan, Deirdre & Laurence; Irish Place Names, page 172.

The first records of the parish itself were in 1492 with Terence Macgillacossgli (Cosgrave) is recorded as vicar of Magheracross and Derrybrusk, Maghercross was at that time part of Derryvullen parish. In 1500 two Maguire princes were ambushed by the O'Neills at Ballinamallard in their conflict and in 1539 the Original Magheracross church destroyed by fire 1593 saw the start of Hugh O'Neill's war that resulted in the Flight of the Earls in 1611. Following which Henry Folliot of Pyrton in Wiltshire, was granted the Manor of Drumchine (later Newporton) including 1,500 Irish acres through Magheracross parish. He built Castle Murray and imported tenants from the Scottish Borders between Dumfries and Carlisle who were fleeing the union of England and Scotland and the consequent pacification of the previously lawless area around Anglo-Scottish border under James I that was taking place at that time. By 1622 there were 20 houses in Ballinamallard and the Church \\"standing but not repaired within\\". In 1629 the old graveyard at Kilskeery and Magheracross was officially united with Kilskeery parish. Religion was important through the 18th century. In 1704, Rev N Browne, Rector of Kilskeery, translated the Prayer Book into Irish. In 1766 Magheracross Parish split from Kilskeery and in 1769 John Wesley visited the area bringing Methodism. Coa Chapel was built in 1770. Ballinamallard Church of Ireland was built in 1785 and the Methodist Hall was constructed in 1800. The Present Church of Ireland was built in 1844. The 18th century also saw non-religious developments, Magheracross House was built in 1740 and the Ballinamallard bridge was built in 1750. 1783 saw the Repeal of Poyning's Law and the Birth of Orange Peggy. In the early 20th century, thousands of Cooneyites or \\"Dippers\\", followers of Edward Cooney and William Irvine, flocked to religious conventions at Crocknacrieve House near Ballinamallard.

In the 1970s the Development Association initiated some useful projects. The old Great Northern Railway station was restored to become the Rascal’s PlayStation, a purpose-built child care centre, while the Commons was transformed into a children’s playground and industrial units were established on the Enniskillen road. Ballinamallard’s best known family are the Fishers, whose firm, Fisher Engineering, has brought substantial employment to the village. The company, which specialises in agricultural engineering and building construction, was founded by the late Thomas Fisher when he returned from World War II. Today Fishers are one of the foremost steel construction firms in the British Isles servicing such projects as the Waterfront Hall and the Odyssey Arena, both in Belfast.

He was born in Heilbronn. At the age of sixteen he entered the Dominican Order and made his ecclesiastical studies in the convent at Wimpfen. Little is known about his early preaching, but in 1534 he was invited to preach in the cathedral of Augsburg, but owing to the Lutheran tendencies of the time, and the strong anti-Catholic feeling which arose from it, the Catholic clergy were forbidden to preach, and his usefulness in Augsburg was of short duration. He then went to the University of Cologne, where he devoted himself for several years to the higher clerical studies. Here he published in 1535 and 1536 several unedited works of the English mystic, Richard Rolle. Returning to Wimpfen, he engaged in the work of preaching and, as a Catholic, refuting the supposed errors of the Reformers, which had grown greatly in popularity since his departure. His zeal in upholding the tenets of Catholicism, and his increasing success as preacher, caused his enemies to turn against him with such bitterness that he was forced to leave the city. In 1539, at the invitation of the citizens of Colmar, he proceeded to that city, where Lutheranism had by this time become extremely popular. On September 2 of the same year he enrolled at the University of Freiburg as \\"Concionator Colmarensis\\", and it was at this time that he most likely received his baccalaureate. In 1545 he was elected prior of the convent in Sélestat, but he had served only two years in this capacity when he was again appointed to take charge of the pulpit in the cathedral of Augsburg. Being forced to abandon it once more in 1552, he proceeded to the University of Ingolstadt, where he received the degree of Doctor of Theology under the presidency of Peter Canisius, who succeeded him later in the pulpit of Augsburg. In the following year he returned again to Augsburg, where he died.  Religious Ideas  Faber was a man of vast theological learning. His Catholic zeal to stem the tide of Lutheranism brought him into open conflict with many church leaders. He was the author of a number of works, including the following: * \\"Quod fides esse possit sine caritate, expositio pia et catholica\\" (Augsburg, 1548) * \\"Testimonium Scripturae et Patrum B. Petrum apostolum Romae fuisse\\" (Antwerp, 1553) * \\"Grundliche und christliche Anzeigungen aus der heiligen Schrift und heiligen Kirchenlehrern was die evangelische Messe sei\\" (Dillingen, 1558) * \\"Enchiridion Bibliorum concionatori in popularibus declamationibus utile\\" (Cologne, 1568) * \\"Precationes Christianae ex sacris litteris et D.

To understand metaphysical nihilism, one can look to the subtraction theory in its simplest form, proposed by Thomas Baldwin. #There could have been finitely many things. #For each thing, that thing might not have existed. #The removal of one thing does not necessitate the introduction of another. #Therefore, there could have been no things at all. The idea is that there is a possible world with finitely many things. One can thus get another possible world by taking a single thing away, and one does not need to add any other thing as its replacement. Then one can take another thing away, and another, until one is left with a possible world that is empty. Against the possible strength of this intuitive argument, some philosophers argue that there are necessarily some concrete objects. It is a consequence of David Kellogg Lewis's concrete modal realism that it is impossible that no concrete objects exist; for since worlds are concrete, there is at least one concrete object—the world itself—at each world. E. J. Lowe has likewise argued that there are necessarily some concrete objects. His argument runs as follows: Necessarily, there are some abstract objects, such as numbers. The only possible abstract objects are sets or universals, but both of these depend on the existence of concrete objects (for sets, their members; for universals, the things that instantiate them). Therefore, there are necessarily some concrete objects.

He currently lives in Tasmania's Tamar Valley, and until the age of 81 continued to be a presenter of the ABC TV program Gardening Australia. His last show aired on 26 July 2008. He will continue his radio show from Tasmania, his appearances at the Gardening Australia Expos and continue work on his autobiography. He was made a Member of the Order of Australia in 2007 \\"For service to the environment, particularly the protection of wilderness areas in Tasmania, and to horticulture as a presenter of gardening programs on television and radio.\\" Cundall has become a household name to Australian gardeners. The TV show and magazine Gardening Australia Cundall represents has a devoted audience of both younger and older gardeners and admirers. At Gardening Australia Live shows (gardening exhibitions in Australian capital cities) Peter Cundall's presentations attract many viewers. In a 2008 issue of Reader's Digest, he came 8th in a poll of the 100 most trusted Australians. He is an environmentalist and pacifist. Early life and military service Cundall was born into an impoverished home, \\"the poorest of the poor\\", in Manchester, England on 1 April 1927, as the second of six children. Two of his brothers died when he was young. His father was an alcoholic and battered his mother. This put Cundall off alcohol forever. He was sent to a Catholic school, but never believed the dogma he was taught. His Head Teacher called him a \\"steady lad who tries hard\\". He left school at age 12 after only three years of formal education, but straight away had a love for knowledge, books and reading. He worked as a milk boy and a tram conductor. Near the end of World War II, Cundall joined the British Army's Parachute Regiment. He was stationed in various countries in post-war Europe in France, Austria, Germany, Italy and Yugoslavia and the Middle East in Egypt and the British Mandate for Palestine. During these travels he visited many private and public gardens and parks in order to add to his knowledge of plants and landscaping practices covering a wide range of climatic conditions. He was also stationed at a liberated concentration camp and has said that the things he saw and heard had a deep impact on him. In 1946, Cundall was stationed in south-east Austria at Sankt Paul im Lavanttal where he was guarding captured Nazi Waffen-SS troops. He was enticed across the border into Yugoslavia by a beautiful girl named Angela, and was arrested by Marshal Tito's forces after she disappeared. He was sentenced (without trial) to four years' imprisonment for espionage, but was released into Trieste, Italy after six months in solitary confinement in a prison in Ljubljana, after pressure from the British government led to his release. Eager to hasten his emigration to Australia, Cundall enlisted in the Australian Army in 1950, believing that he was enlisting for a non-combat role as a librarian. He was immediately posted to Korea, however, with the 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, and once again saw action overseas as a machine gunner during the Korean War. During a year-and-a-half based in Japan he studied Japanese garden design and rock garden construction. He also gained access to many famous gardens and bonsai nurseries and regularly went to observe new gardens being created in Hiroshima, which was being rebuilt after the atomic bombing in 1945. Political career and activism Cundall was a Federal Senate candidate for Tasmania for the Communist Party of Australia in the 1961 federal election. He also supports many left wing political and environmental groups by speaking at rallies and events. He is an ardent pacifist and is a keen environmentalist. He was the Chairman of the Tasmanian Wilderness Society during the battle to stop the building of the Franklin Dam, and campaigned against the construction of the Bell Bay Pulp Mill. In 2003 Cundall also marched, with thousands of other Australians, in protest against Australia's involvement in the Iraq War. On 19 November 2009, Cundall was arrested by police after refusing to obey requests to move from Tasmanian state parliament's front steps. He was protesting against the Gunns' Bell Bay Pulp Mill. On 3 February 2010, he pleaded not guilty to the charge of refusing to obey a police order to move away from Parliament House. After the court session, he accused Gunns and the politicians who approved the pulp mill of corruption. He was found guilty without conviction and was fined about A$47 in court costs on 11 February 2011. Despite the fine, he vowed to \\"continue to peacefully protest against Gunns' proposed Tasmanian pulp mill\\". Gardening and broadcasting  Peter Cundall's vegetable garden used in Gardening Australia After leaving the Australian Army in 1956, Cundall moved to Tasmania, where he started his own gardening and landscaping business designing and constructing gardens in Tasmania. During this period he specialised in landscaping a large number of schools, hospitals, universities, factories, hotels, shopping centres and private gardens in Tasmania and Victoria. He was also an active founding member of the Organic Gardening and Farming Society. In 1967, he started a gardening talkback program on a Launceston radio station. In 1969, he began presenting a television gardening program for Australia's national broadcaster, the Australian Broadcasting Commission. Originally called It's Growing and then Landscape, it was another world-first which concentrated on the design and construction of new gardens in Tasmania. This show became one of the longest-running, most iconic shows in Australia—Gardening Australia. In 1974 he was awarded a Churchill Fellowship. This enabled him to travel through the United States, Britain and Africa to study organic gardening, landscaping methods, children's playground design and the presentation of television gardening programs in colour. With WGBH Boston and the BBC he studied the way television gardening programs were made for differing climatic conditions. In December 2007, Cundall and the ABC announced that the 2008 series would be his last. On 18 June 2008 he filmed his last Gardening Australia episode at the Royal Tasmanian Botanical Gardens. His last appearance was broadcast on ABC TV on 26 July 2008. After his regular work on Gardening Australia, Cundall appeared for the \\"Help Wanted\\" segment on the ABC's programme Can We Help? on 11 September 2009 to help adenocarcinoma sufferer Michael Carson and his wife Dympna with rebuilding a vegetable garden in their backyard. About a month after the segment had been filmed, Carson died from his illness. Cundall was a panellist on ABC's Q+A on 25 July 2011. Later life After his retirement from Gardening Australia, Cundall continued his work as a garden writer for the Mercury and Weekly Times newspapers, as well as ABC Organic Gardener Magazine, writing predominantly about his vegetable garden while providing advice to gardeners. In June 2018, Cundall announced that he had been diagnosed with glaucoma when he was 87 and that he would eventually lose his eyesight. As such, Cundall retired as a columnist on 26 June 2018; however, he still presents on ABC Radio in northern and southern Tasmania on Weekends with Chris Wisbey. Awards In 2006, Cundall was named Australian Humanist of the Year. In 2007, he was awarded a Membership of the Order of Australia \\"For service to the environment, particularly the protection of wilderness areas in Tasmania, and to horticulture as a presenter of gardening programs on television and radio.\\" He was also awarded Organic Federation of Australia's Lifetime Achievement Award in that year. In 1994 Cundall was appointed Envoy for the Save the Children Fund.

The Court found that the Crown had a duty to provide the defence with all evidence that could possibly be relevant to the case, regardless of whether the Crown plans to call that evidence at trial or not, or whether it helps or hurts the Crown's case. This case put to rest the long-standing issue of whether the Crown could purposely deny the defence evidence that the Crown found would be harmful to their case. Background William Stinchcombe was a lawyer who was charged with theft and fraud. One of the Crown's witnesses was a former secretary of Stinchcombe's who had given evidence at the preliminary inquiry that supported the defence's position. Later a statement was taken from her by an RCMP officer, however, at trial the defence was denied access to the contents of the statement. When the Crown decided not to use the statement the defence made a request for it to the judge who refused to provide it. The accused was eventually convicted. Reasons of the court Justice Sopinka, writing for a unanimous Court, held that the judge was wrong in refusing the application by the defence, as the Crown was under a duty to disclose all evidence. Crown has a duty to disclose but crown only has a duty to disclose critical evidence that they believe will assist the defence. If they believe it will not help the case the crown are not obligated to disclose as CJ Mclachlin stated in R v Kennedy. \\"The Crown has a legal duty to disclose all relevant information to the defence. The fruits of the investigation which are in its possession are not the property of the Crown for use in securing a conviction but the property of the public to be used to ensure that justice is done.\\" The duty, wrote Sopinka, is derived from the right of an accused to make full answer and defence which has been entrenched under section 7 of the Charter. This duty, however, is still subject to rules of privilege.

Hákonar saga Hákonarsonar tells us that in Norway: \\"In the previous summer [i.e. that of 1262], letters came east from the Hebrides ... and they brought forward much about the dispeace that the Earl of Ross ... and other Scots, had made in the Hebrides, when they went out to Skye, and burned towns and churches, and slew very many men and women ... They said that the Scottish king intended to lay under himself all the Hebrides.\\" 1 Uilleam's attacks on Norwegian possessions earned him the ire of King Haakon, who planned an expedition against him. However, William escaped this expedition. He was probably rewarded with Skye and Lewis after the Scottish reconquest of the Hebrides, a reward secured when the conquests were ratified by the Treaty of Perth in 1266. William married Jean Comyn, daughter of William, Earl of Buchan. So far as is known he had only one son, also named William, who succeeded him as Earl. William died in May 1274 at \\"Earles Allane\\", likely the site of modern Allanfearn or Allangrange. References * 1. A.O. Anderson, Early Sources, Vol. II, p. 605 * 2.

It is one of two branches of the parent haplogroup GHIJK, the other being HIJK. At the level of national populations, G-M201 is most commonly found in Georgia; it is found at even higher levels among many other regional and minority populations in the Caucasus. G-M201 is also widely distributed at low frequencies, among ethnic groups of Europe, South Asia, Central Asia, and North Africa. While G-M201 is generally believed to have originated in Western Asia, only one sample of basal G* or the paragroup G(xG1,G2) – i.e. G* or an otherwise undocumented primary subclade – is known: a blood sample taken from a man executed on a guillotine during the French Revolution. (See the \\"Historical presence\\" section below for further details.) The most commonly occurring subclades are G1* (M285) and many subclades of G2 (G-P287), especially: G2a (P15), G2a1 (G-FGC7535, formerly G-L293), G2a2b2a (G-P303) formerly G2a3b1); G2a2b1 (G-M406) formerly G2a3a; G2a2b2a1 (G-L140) formerly G2a3b1a; G2a2b2a1a1b (G-L497) formerly G2a3b1a2; G2a2b2a1a1a1 (G-L13) formerly G2a3b1a1a; G2a2b2a1a1c1a (G-CTS5990 or G-Z1903) formerly G2a3b1a3; G2b (G-M3115) and; G2b1 (G-M377), formerly G2b. Origins Various estimated dates and locations have been proposed for the origin of G-M201, most of them in Western Asia In 2012, a paper by Siiri Rootsi et al. suggested that: \\"We estimate that the geographic origin of haplogroup G plausibly locates somewhere nearby eastern Anatolia, Armenia or western Iran.\\" Previously the National Geographic Society placed its origins in the Middle East 30,000 years ago and presumes that people carrying the haplogroup took part in the spread of the Neolithic.Atlas of the Human Journey: Haplogroup G (M201) Two scholarly papers have also suggested an origin in the Middle East, while differing on the date. Semino et al. (2000) suggested 17,000 years ago. Cinnioglu et al. (2004) suggested the mutation took place only 9,500 years ago. A more eastern origin has also been mentioned, believed by some to originate in an area close to the Himalayan foothills.

Geographic distribution =Prehistoric presence= Ancient G-M201s with sequencing Haplogroup G2a (G-P15) has been identified in Neolithic human remains in Europe dating between 5000 and 3000 BC. These Neolithic European were descendants of Neolithic farmers from Anatolia, among some of the earliest peoples in the world to practice agriculture. G-M201 has also been found in Neolithic Anatolian sites such as Boncuklu dating back to 8300-7600 BCE, and Barcin dating back to 6419-6238 BCE. Furthermore, the majority of all the male skeletons from the European Neolithic period have so far yielded Y-DNA belonging to this haplogroup. The oldest skeletons confirmed by ancient DNA testing as carrying haplogroup G2a were five found in the Avellaner cave burial site, near Les Planes d'Hostoles, in Catalonia, Spain and were dated by radiocarbon dating to about 5000 BCE. A skeleton found at the Neolithic cemetery known as Derenburg Meerenstieg II, in Saxony-Anhalt Germany, apparently belonged to G2a3 (G-S126) or a subclade. It was found with burial artifacts belonging to the Linearbandkeramische Kultur (\\"Linear Band Ceramic Culture\\"; LBK). This skeleton could not be dated by radiocarbon dating, but other skeletons there were dated to between 5,100 and 6,100 years old. The most detailed SNP mutation identified was S126 (L30), which defines G2a3. G2a was found also in 20 out of 22 samples of ancient Y-DNA from Treilles, the type-site of a Late Neolithic group of farmers in the South of France, dated to about 5000 years ago.Marie Lacan, Christine Keyser, François-Xavier Ricaut, Nicolas Brucato, Francis Duranthon, Jean Guilaine, Eric Crubézy, and Bertrand Ludes, Ancient DNA reveals male diffusion through the Neolithic Mediterranean route, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA, online May 31, 2011 before print. The fourth site also from the same period is the Ötztal of the Italian Alps where the mummified remains of Ötzi the Iceman were discovered. The Iceman belongs to haplogroup G2a2b Interview Dr. Eduard Egarter-Vigl, Head of Conservation and Assistant to research projects of the Archaeological Museum in Bozen. From the Docu-Movie: \\"Ötzi, ein Archäologiekrimi\\" [Ötzi, a Archaeology Crime] by Christine Sprachmann. TV- Broadcast by 3sat 10 August 2011 and br-alpha 13 September 2011 (earlier called G2a4). Haplogroup G2a2b is a rare group today in Europe. The authors of the Spanish study indicated that the Avellaner men had rare marker values in testing of their short tandem repeat (STR) markers. =Modern presence= In Russia, Ukraine and Central Asia, members of various ethnic minorities and/or residents in particular localities possess G-M201 at its highest levels in the world – even though the average rate at the national level is about 1% or less. The Madjar and Argyn tribes (or clans) of Kazakhstan were found to possess the highest levels of G-M201 among any modern ethnic group. Amongst the Madjars, G1 was found at a rate of 87%. A separate study on the Argyns found that 71% of males belong to G1. In the Russian North Caucasus the Kabardinian and Ossetian populations are also notable for high rates of G-M201. Digora, North Ossetia has the highest known concentration of G in a single city, as 74% of the tested men were G. Haplogroup G is found as far east as northern China in small percentages where G can reach more substantial percentages in minority groups such as the Uyghurs. In Turkey, the South Caucasus and Iran, haplogroup G reaches the highest percentage of national populations. Among Turkish males 11% of the population is G. In Iran, Haplogroup G reaches 13 to 15% of the population in various parts of the country. While it is found in percentages higher than 10% among the Bakhtiari, Talysh people, Gilaki, Mazandarani and Iranian Azeris, it is closer to 5% among the Iranian Arabs and in some large cities. Among the samples in the YHRD database from the southern Caucasus countries, 29% of the samples from Abazinia, 31% from Georgia, 18% from Azerbaijan and 11% from Armenia appear to be G samples. In Europe west of the Black Sea, Haplogroup G is found at about 5% of the population on average throughout most of the continent. The concentration of G falls below this average in Scandinavia, the westernmost former Soviet republics and Poland, as well as in Iceland and the British Isles. There are seeming pockets of unusual concentrations within Europe. In Wales, a distinctive G2a3b1 type (DYS388=13 and DYS594=11) dominates there and pushes the G percentage of the population higher than in England. In the Tirol (Tyrol) of western Austria, the percentage of G-M201 can reach 40% or more; perhaps the most famous example is the ancient remains of the so-called \\"Iceman\\", Ötzi. In the northern and highland areas of the island of Sardinia off western Italy, G percentages reach 11% of the population in one study and reached 21% in the town of Tempio in another study. In the Greek island of Crete, approximately 7% to 11% of males belong to haplogroup G. In north- eastern Croatia, in the town of Osijek, G was found in 14% of the males. The city is on the banks of the river Drava, which notably begins in the Tirol/Tyrol region of the Alps, another haplogroup G focus area in Europe. Farther north, 8% of ethnic Hungarian males and 5.1% of ethnic Bohemian (Czech) males have been found to belong to Haplogroup G. In South Asia, some ethnic minorities possess haplogroup G at concentrations of approximately 18% to 20% of Kalash, approximately 16% of Brahui, and approximately 11.5% of sampled Pashtun, but in only about 3% of the general Pakistani population. The many groups in India and Bangladesh have not been well studied. About 6% of the samples from Sri Lanka and Malaysia were reported as haplogroup G, but none were found in the other coastal lands of the Indian Ocean or Pacific Ocean in Asia. In the Middle East, haplogroup G accounts for about 3% of the population in almost all areas. In Lebanon, however, G accounts for 6.5% of the population and in Iran to around 10%. Among the Druze mostly residents of Israel 10% were found to be haplogroup G. Around 10% of Jewish males are Haplogroup G. In Africa, haplogroup G is rarely found in sub-Saharan Africa or south of the horn of Africa among native populations. In Egypt, studies have provided information that pegs the G percentage there to be between 2% and 9%.Elizabeth T Wood, Daryn A Stover, Christopher Ehret et al., \\"Contrasting patterns of Y chromosome and mtDNA variation in Africa: evidence for sex- biased demographic processes,\\" European Journal of Human Genetics (2005) 13, 867–876. (cf. Appendix A: Y Chromosome Haplotype Frequencies) 3% of North African Berbers were found to be haplogroup G. 2% of Arab Moroccans and 8% of Berber Moroccans were likewise found to be G. In the Americas, the percentage of haplogroup G corresponds to the numbers of persons from Old World countries who emigrated. It is not found among Native Americans except where intermarriage with non-native persons has occurred. It has been found in Mexican mestizos. G1 (M285 or M342) Almost all haplogroup G1 persons have the value of 12 at short tandem repeat (STR) marker DYS392 and all will have the M285 or M342 SNP mutation which characterizes this group. This value of 12 is uncommon in other G categories other than G1. subclades of G1a, G1a1, G1b exist. The highest reported concentration of G1 and its subclades in a single country is in Iran, with next most frequent concentrations in neighboring countries to the west. There are distinctive Ashkenazi Jewish and Kazakh subclades based on STR marker value combinations. G2 (P287) Men who belong to this group but are negative for all G2 subclades represent a small number of haplogroup G men. P287 was identified at the University of Arizona and became widely known in late 2007. Its identification caused considerable renaming of G categories. =G2a (P15)= Haplogroup G men who belong to this group, but are negative for all G2a subclades, are uncommon in Europe but may represent a sizeable group in so far poorly tested areas east of Turkey. P15 was identified at the University of Arizona and became widely known by 2002. Its chromosome location listed as 21653414. G2a was found in medieval remains in a 7th- century CE high-status tomb in Ergolding, Bavaria, Germany, but G2a subclades were not tested. There are multiple SNPs which so far have the same coverage as P15. They are—with accompanying Y-chromosome locations—U5 (rs2178500), L149 (8486380) and L31 (also called S149) (rs35617575..12538148). Should any man with the P15 mutation test negative (ancestral) for any of these or vice versa, that finding would be the basis of a new G2a category. =G2a1 (FGC7535)= Haplogroup G2a1 (also known as G-FGC753 and previously as G-L293) and its subclades represent the majority of haplogroup G samples in some parts of the Caucasus Mountains area. They are found only in tiny numbers elsewhere. So far all G2a1 persons have a value of 10 at STR marker DYS392. G2a1a persons also typically have higher values for DYS385b, such as 16, 17 or 18, than seen in most G persons. The North Ossetians in the mid northern Caucasus area of Russia belong overwhelmingly to the G2a1 subclade based on available samples. The South Ossetians and Svans generally south of North Ossetia have significant number of G2a1 persons, but population percentages have not yet been provided. The presence of the SNP P18 mutation characterizes G2a1a's only subclade, G2a1a. The reliability of both P16 and P18 in identifying everyone in each of these categories has been questioned and individual components of the SNP have to be examined. Ashkenazi Jewish G2a1a men with northeastern European ancestry form a distinct cluster based on STR marker values. Men from the Caucasus and men from eastern Europe also form distinctive STR clusters. =G2a2a (PF3147)= G-PF3147 (previously G-L223 and G-PF3146) is characterized by having the L223 mutation. L223 is found on the Y chromosome at rs810801 and 6405148 with a mutation from C to G. L223 was first identified in samples at 23andMe in 2009 but proved problematic as an individual test, the first successful results being reported at Family Tree DNA in late 2011 under its assigned L223 label. It was then learned that three subclades as follows belong under L223: The G2a2a subclade (M286) is tiny. Samples indicating British Isles, Turkish and Lebanese ancestry have been identified. The British samples have inconsistent double values for STR marker DYS19 in many cases. M286 was first identified at Stanford University at chromosome position 21151187, and is a mutation from G to A. G2a2b (G-L91) was identified in 2009. Its members include \\"Ötzi\\", the so-called Iceman, who died at least 5,000 years BP in the European Alps. G2a2b would seem to encompass a significant proportion of men belonging to G. L91 is found so far in scattered parts of Europe and North Africa and in Armenia. Included within G2a2b are some men with double values for STR marker DYS19, but there are also G2a2 men with this finding who are not G2a2b. The double 19 value situation is not seen in the G2a1 and G2a3 subclades. The L91 mutation is found at 21327383 and rs35474563 on the Y-chromosome. The forward primer is , and the reverse is . The mutation involves a change from C to T. L223 is found on the Y chromosome at rs13304806. The L293 SNP that characterizes the G2a2c subclade was identified in June 2010 at Family Tree DNA. It encompasses a small group of Hispanic men who also so far all have the odd value of 13,21 at the YCA marker. The mutation is found on the Y chromosome at 10595022 and is a change from G to C. = G2a2b (L30, PF3267, S126, U8)= G-L30 (also G-PF3267, G-S126 or G-U8; G2a2b, previously G2a3) Men who belong to this group but are negative for all its subclades represent a small number today. This haplogroup was found in a Neolithic skeleton from around 5000 BC, in the cemetery of Derenburg Meerenstieg II, Germany, which forms part of the Linear Pottery culture, known in German as Linearbandkeramik (LBK), but was not tested for G2a3 subclades. =G2a2b1 (M406)= G-M406* (G2a2b1*; previously G2a3a*) and its subclades seem most commonly found in Turkey and the coastal areas of the eastern Mediterranean where it can constitute up to 5% of all makes and 50% of haplogroup G samples. G2a3a is more common in southern Europe than northern Europe. In Europe—except in Italy – G2a3a constitutes less than 20% of G samples. G2a3a so far has seldom surfaced in northern Africa or southern Asia, but represents a small percentage of the G population in the Caucasus Mountains region and in Iran. A relatively high percentage of G2a3a persons have a value of 21 at STR marker DYS390. The DYS391 marker has mostly a value of 10, but sometimes 11, in G2a3a persons, and DYS392 is almost always 11. If a sample meets the criteria indicated for these three markers, it is likely the sample is G2a3a. G2a3a has two known subclades. Both are relatively common among G2a3a persons. = G2a2b2 (CTS2488) = G-CTS2488 or G2a2b2 (also known as G-L141.1; previously G-141 and G2a3b) was identified only in mid-2009 at Family Tree DNA. Almost all L141 men belong to L141 subclades. Samples from persons with British Isles, Sicilian and Turkish ancestry have been identified. L141 persons who do not belong to any L141 subclade so far have the value of 11 at STR marker DYS490 — a finding rare in other G categories. The L141 mutation is found on the Y chromosome at 2948607. The L141 mutation involves an insertion.ymap.ftdna.com =G2a2b2a (G-P303)= G-P303*, also known as G2a2b2a* (previously G2a3b1*), and its subclades are now concentrated in southern Russia and the Caucasus, as well as, at lower levels, other parts of Europe and South West Asia, especially an area including Turkey, Iran and the Middle East where G2a2b2a may have originated. G2a2b2a is also found in India. A majority of members of G-P303 belong to one of its subclades, rather than to G-P303* The largest G-P303* subclade based on available samples is one in which almost all persons have the value of 13 at STR marker DYS388. The SNP L497 encompasses these men, but most G-L497 men belong to its subclade G-Z725, also known as G-DYS388=13. There are additional subclades of DYS388=13 men characterized by the presence of specific SNPs or uncommon STR marker oddities. Members of this group have been found in Europe and the Middle East. The next largest subclade of G-P303 is characterized by the presence of the U1 mutation. But a high percentage of U1 men belong to its two subclades, G-L13/S13 and Z1266 (G2a3b1a1b). The G-L13 subclade is most common in north central Europe, and G-Z1266 is most common in the western Caucasus Mountains. The final major subclade is characterized by presence of the SNP Z1903 and by a value of 9 at marker DYS568. A high percentage of G-Z1903 men belong to its subclade, G-Z724. The subclade G-Z724 contains a further large subclade consisting overwhelmingly of Ashkenazi Jews. The highest percentage of G-P303 persons in a discrete population so far described is on the island of Ibiza off the eastern Spanish coast. This group has been linked with the Crypto- Jewish population which fled to the island during the time of the Spanish Inquisition, of which a significant portion are identifiable as G-Z725 (DYS388=13). = G2a2b2b (PF3359)= G-PF3359 (or G2a2b2b; previously G2a3b2) was known prior to 2013 as G-L177. The SNP L177 (a.k.a. L1771.1/ L177_1, L1771.2/L177_2, L177.3/L177_3) was withdrawn as an identifier by ISOGG in 2013, after it was \\"found to be an unreliable palindromic snp\\".L177, later discarded in favour of PF3359 and equivalent SNPs, was first identified at Family Tree DNA in 2009. The L177.1 component is found at Y chromosome position 23397163; L177.2 at 25030912; L177.3 at 25750264. See: http://ytree.ftdna.com/index.php?name=Draft&parent;=20173662 . Ancient DNA identified as G-PF3359 has been found at archaeological sites in: Hungary (the subclade G-F872*), dated at 7,500 years before present (BP); Hungary (subclade G-F1193*) 7,150 BP, and; Spain (G-PF3359*) 4,700 BP. The members of G-PF3359 are probably smaller in number than men included in G-P303, but only a small amount of testing has occurred for the relevant mutations. So far the men positive for this have had Irish, English, Dutch, Lebanese and/or Turkish (Armenian surname) ancestry. Several G-PF3359 subclades, based on shared STR markers, probably exist. The number of STR marker values separating men in this group suggest G-PF3359 is a relatively old group despite the small number of men involved. The mutations involved may be complicated and difficult to interpret. = G2b1 (M377) = G-M377, now also known as G2b1, has previously been designated G2b and G2c. A clade of closely related Ashkenazi Jews represent virtually all G2b persons, with just three other G2b haplotypes having been reported so far: one Turk from Kars in northeast Turkey near Armenia, one Pashtun, and one Burusho in Pakistan. The extreme rarity of G-M377 in northern Pakistan could indicate that G2b in this area originates outside the region and was brought there in the historic period, perhaps from further west (Pakistan was part of both the Achaemenid Persian Empire, conquered by Alexander the Great, and then formed a part of the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom). These two reported Pakistani G-M377 haplotypes are quite divergent from the Ashkenazi Jewish clade, and therefore do not at all indicate a recent common origin. The Turkish G-M377 is somewhat closer, but not identical. It remains to be seen if testing will reveal G-M377 haplotypes in other populations — this is some indication that G-M377 occurs at low levels in the Near East. All G-M377 men tested so far also have a rare null value for the DYS425 marker, (a missing \\"T\\" allele of the DYS371 palindromic STR), the result of a RecLOH event, a finding not yet seen among most other G haplotypes. Among Jews in Israel drawn from many areas of the world, G-M377 constituted 3.7% in one study. Haplogroup G-M377 has been found at a frequency of 60% out of a sample of five Pashtuns in the Wardak region of Afghanistan. This is likely due to a local founder effect. Defining SNPs The International Society of Genetic Genealogy (ISOGG) maintains the most up-to- date consensus version of haplogroup categories. These classifications are based on shared SNP mutations. The discovery of new SNPs can result in assignment of new names to haplogroup categories. There were only a few G categories until 2008 when major revisions to categories were made. Even more G SNPs were identified in 2009 to 2012 leading to more changes. Until 2008, new G SNPs were reported from labs at the University of Arizona (P designations), Stanford University (M designations) or the University of Central Florida (U designations). Beginning in 2008, additional G SNPs were identified at Family Tree DNA (L designations) and Ethnoancestry (S designations). These latter labs also made use of raw data results reported by individuals tested for about 2,000 SNPs at 23andMe to provide new L or S-designated SNP tests. In 2009-10, Family Tree DNA's Walk through the Y Project, sequencing certain Y-chromosome segments, provided a number of new G SNPs with the L designation. In 2012, SNPs with the Z designation as first identified by citizen researchers from 1000 Genomes Project data began to appear. Because SNPs provide the most reliable method of categorization, each is allowed to represent an official G category. Categories have alternating letters and numbers. But unusual values or unusual value combinations found at short tandem repeat markers (STRs) can also provide the basis of additional taxonomisation. The identification of a new SNP can necessitate renaming of one or more categories. The M201 SNP mutation that characterizes haplogroup G was identified at Stanford University and was first reported in 2001. The technical specifications of M201 are given as: refSNPid is rs2032636.....Y chromosome location of 13536923....forward primer is .....reverse primer is .....the mutation involves a change from G to T. A number of SNPs have been identified with seemingly the same coverage in the population as M201. Because M201 was identified first, it is the standard SNP test used when testing for G persons. In order to determine if one of these alternative SNPs represents a subclade of M201, the alternative SNPs must be tested in G persons who are negative for the known subclades of G. There are only a tiny number of persons in such a category, and only a tiny number of persons have been tested for G equivalent SNPs other than M201.

Denmark–Norway held colonial possessions in India for more than 200 years, including the town of Tharangambadi in present-day Tamil Nadu state, Serampore in present-day West Bengal, and the Nicobar Islands, currently part of India's union territory of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The Danish and Norwegian presence in India was of little significance to the major European powers as they presented neither a military nor a mercantile threat. Dano-Norwegian ventures in India, as elsewhere, were typically undercapitalised and never able to dominate or monopolise trade routes in the same way that British, French, and Portuguese ventures could. In spite of these disadvantages, the Danish - Norway concerns managed to cling to their colonial holdings and, at times, to carve out a valuable niche in international trade by taking advantage of wars between larger countries and offering foreign trade under a neutral flag. For this reason their presence was tolerated for many years until the growth in British naval power led to the occupation and forced sale of the Danish holdings during the nineteenth century.  History  The success of Dutch and English traders in the 17th century spice trade was a source of envy among Danish and Norwegian merchants. On March 17, 1616, Christian IV the King of Denmark-Norway, issued a charter creating a Danish East India Company with a monopoly on trade between Denmark-Norway and Asia for 12 years. It would take an additional two years before sufficient capital had been raised to finance the expedition, perhaps due to lack of confidence on the part of Danish investors. It took the arrival of the Dutch merchant and colonial administrator, Marchelis de Boshouwer, in 1618 to provide the impetus for the first voyage. Marcelis arrived as an envoy (or at least claimed to do so) for the emperor of Ceylon, Cenerat Adassin, seeking military assistance against the Portuguese and promising a monopoly on all trade with the island. His appeal had been rejected by his countrymen, but it convinced the Danish King. = First expedition (1618–1620) = The first expedition set sail in 1618 under Admiral Ove Gjedde, taking two years to reach Ceylon and losing more than half their crew on the way. Upon arriving in May 1620, they found the Emperor no longer desiring any foreign assistance — having made a peace agreement with the Portuguese three years earlier. Nor, to the dismay of the Admiral, was the Emperor the sole, or even the \\"most distinguished king in this land\\".Esther Fihl (2009). \\"Shipwrecked on the Coromandel:cThe first Indo–Danish contact, 1620\\". Review of Development and Change 14 (1&2): 19–40 Failing to get the Dano-Norwegian-Ceylonese trade contract confirmed, the Dano-Norwegians briefly occupied the Koneswaram Temple before receiving word from their trade director, Robert Crappe. Crappe had sailed on the scouting freighter Øresund one month before the main fleet. Øresund had attacked Portuguese vessels off the coast of Karaikal and was himself sunk, with most of the crew killed or taken prisoner. The heads of two crew members were placed on spikes on the beach as a warning to the Dano-Norwegians. Crappe and 13 of the crew had escaped the wreck, making it to shore where they were captured by Indians and taken to the Nayak of Tanjore (now Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu). The Nayak turned out to be interested in trading opportunities, and Crappe negotiated a treaty granting them the village of Tranquebar (or Tharangamabadi), the right to construct a \\"stone house\\" (Fort Dansborg), and permission to levy taxes. This was signed on 20 November 1620. = Early years (1621–1639) = The early years of the colony were arduous, with poor administration and investment, coupled with the loss of almost two-thirds of all the trading vessels dispatched from Denmark.Of the 18 ships that departed from Denmark between 1622 and 1637, only 7 returned. Kay Larsen: Trankebar, op.cit., p.30-31. The ships that did return made a profit on their cargo, but total returns fell well short of the costs of the venture. Moreover, the geographical location of the colony was vulnerable to high tidal waves that repeatedly destroyed what people built — roads, houses, administrative buildings, markets, etc. Although the intention had been to create an alternative to the English and Dutch traders, the dire financial state of the company and the redirection of national resources towards the Thirty Years' War led the colony to abandon efforts to trade directly for themselves and, instead, to become neutral third party carriers for goods in the Bay of Bengal. By 1625 a factory had been established at Masulipatnam (present-day Krishna district of Andhra Pradesh), the most important emporium in the region. Lesser trading offices were established at Pipli and Balasore. Despite this, by 1627 the colony was in such a poor financial state that it had just three ships left and was unable to pay the agreed-upon tribute to the Nayak, increasing local tensions. The Danish - Norwegian presence was also unwanted by English and Dutch traders who believed them to be operating under the protection of their navies without bearing any of the costs. Despite this, they could not crush Danish - Norwegian trade, due to diplomatic implications related to their respective nations' involvement in the European wars. *1640 – Danes - Norway attempt to sell Fort Danesborg to the Dutch for a second time. *1642 – Danish - Norway colony declares war on Mogul Empire and commences raiding ships in the Bay of Bengal. Within a few months they had captured one of the Mogul emperor's vessels, incorporated it into their fleet (renamed Bengali Prize) and sold the goods in Tranquebar for a substantial profit. *1643 – Willem Leyel, designated the new leader of the colony by the company directors in Copenhagen arrives aboard the Christianshavn. Holland and Sweden declare war on Denmark - Norway. *1645 – Danish - Norway factory holdings fall increasingly under Dutch control. The Nayak sends small bands to raid Tranquebar. *1648 – Christian IV, patron of the colony, dies. Danish East India Company bankrupt. = Abandonment and isolation (1650–1669) = The lack of financial return led to repeated efforts by the major stockholders of the company to have it dissolved. The King, Christian IV, resisted these efforts until his death in 1648. Two years later his son, Frederick II, abolished the company. Although the company had been abolished, the colony was a royal property and still held by a garrison unaware of court developments back at home. As the number of Danes - Norwegian declined through desertions and illness, Portuguese and Portuguese-Indian natives were hired to garrison the fort until eventually, by 1655, Eskild Anderson Kongsbakke was the commander and sole remaining Dane in Tranquebar. An illiterate commoner, Kongsbakke was loyal to his country and successfully held the fort under a Danish - Norwegian flag against successive sieges by the Nayak for non-payment of tribute, whilst seizing ships in the Bay of Bengal. Using the proceeds of the sale of their goods to repair his defenses, he built a wall around the town and negotiated a settlement with the Nayak. Kongsbakke's reports, sent to Denmark via other European vessels, finally convinced the Danish - Norwegian government to relieve him. The frigate Færø was dispatched to India, commanded by Capt Sivardt Adelaer, with an official confirmation of his appointment as colony leader. It arrived May 1669 — ending 19 years of isolation. = The Second Danish East India Company (1670–1732) = Trade between Denmark - Norway and Tranquebar now resumed, a new Danish East India Company was formed, and several new commercial outposts were established, governed from Tranquebar: Oddeway Torre on the Malabar coast in 1696, and Dannemarksnagore at Gondalpara, southeast of Chandernagore in 1698. The settlement with the Nayak was confirmed and Tranquebar was permitted to expand to include three surrounding villages. *9 June 1706 – Frederick IV, king of Denmark-Norway sends two Danish missionaries to India, Heinrich Plütcshau and Bartholomeus Ziegenbalg – the first Protestant (Lutheran) missionaries in India. Previously priests had not attempted to convert, and Indians denied entry to European churches. Arriving in 1707, they were not welcomed by their countrymen who suspected them of being spies. * Ziegenbalg gains converts among the Indians who, by royal decree, are freed to encourage further Christianisation amongst the Indians. Christianity becomes associated with lower caste people and rejected by upper caste Hindus. * Tensions arise between Ziegenbalg, who came under the authority of the King, and the local governor, John Sigismund Hassius who eventually feels Ziegenbalg is undermining Tranquebar's slave trade and jails him for 4 months. * Ziegenbalg attempts to learn as much as possible of the language of the inhabitants of Tranquebar, hiring tutors to learn Portuguese and Tamil, and buying Hindu texts. He finds ways to create rifts in the local society in collusion with a few new converts to Christianity. He eventually writes the first Tamil glossary, Tamil-German dictionary, and translations of Hindu books. He translates parts of the Bible into Tamil. He completes the New Testament in prison, and the Old Testament later. Receiving funds from Europe he sets up a printing press and prints Tamil Bibles and books. He becomes the first book printer in India and produces paper. He establishes a seminary for Indian priests in Tranquebar before his death in Tranquebar 1719. * This mission leads to missionaries spreading outside the colony, despite opposition from the kings of Tranquebar. * 1729 – Danish - Norwegian King forces the Danish East India Company to loan him money. His failure to repay the loan and inconsistency of Indian trade forces the company into liquidation. = Trade stabilizes under Danish Asiatic Company (1732–1772) = A view of the Danish colony of Tranquebar with the Dansborg fortress in south east India, 1658. * 12 April 1732 – King Christian VI signs charter of new Asiatic Company with 40-year monopoly on Asian trade with India and China. Both previous companies had failed due to the lack of continuity in trade. This time, the intention of the investors was \\"to place this Asiatic Trade in Our Realms and Territories on a more constant footing in time to come.\\" * 1730s — Denmark's Chinese and Indian trade stabilizes, with cargo from India dominated by cotton fabrics from the Coromandel Coast and Bengal. * 1752 – 1791 - Pepper procurement lodge established at Calicut * November 1754 – A meeting of Danish - Norwegian officials is held in Tranquebar. A decision is made to colonise the Andaman and Nicobar Islands to plant pepper, cinnamon, sugarcane, coffee and cotton. *December 1755 – Danish - Norwegian settlers arrive on Andaman Islands. The colony experiences outbreaks of malaria that saw the settlement abandoned periodically until 1848, when it was abandoned for good. This sporadic occupation led to encroachments of other colonial powers onto the islands including Austria and Britain. *October 1755 – Frederiksnagore in Serampore, in present-day West Bengal. *1 January 1756 – The Nicobar Islands are declared Danish - Norwegian property under the name Frederiksøerne (Frederick's Islands). *1756-1760 - All colonisation efforts on the islands fail with settlers wiped out by malaria. Danish - Norwegian claims to the islands were later sold to the British. *1763 Balasore (already occupied 1636–1643). = The Golden Age of Danish India (1772–1807) = *Danish - Norwegian trade grew substantially during these decades due to three key factors The loss of the Danish Asiatic Company's monopoly on trade with India in 1772, opening up the trade to all Danish - Norwegian merchants. Administration of Tranquebar, Serampore, and factories in Bengal and along the Malabar Coast was taken over by the Crown in 1777. This freed the company from the colonial expenses but did not change the conditions of trade with India – leaving it in a better financial position. The growth in both international trade and the increase in wars between the trading nations of England, France and Holland. This meant that during these wars, trade from the warring nations would be carried by neutral nations like Denmark Norway to avoid seizure by the warring parties. The expansion of the British East India Company in India, particularly after the Battle of Plassey in 1757. After this victory many employees of the company acquired vast private fortunes at the expense of the company itself. Both the Company and the British Government made considerable effort to prevent these fortunes from being transported back to England on British vessels, leading to massive laundering through French, Dutch, and Danish Norwegian competitors. This injected enormous amounts of capital into Danish Norwegian trade during the 1770s. The value of the trade, however, remained extremely volatile. *1799 – Dispute between Denmark - Norway and Britain over the rights of a neutral nation to carry out trade with foreign colonies to which it did not normally have access during peacetime. Essentially, Britain was trying to prevent Denmark from carrying out the trade of countries Britain was at war with. At the time Denmark - Norway was able to make exorbitant profits from fetching colonial products from French and Dutch possessions in the Indian Ocean and discharging them into the European market through Copenhagen. *In 1777, it was turned over to the government by the chartered company and became a Danish - Norwegian crown colony. *In 1789, the Andaman Islands became a British possession. = Napoleonic Wars and decline = During the Napoleonic Wars, Denmark-Norway practiced a policy of armed neutrality whilst carrying French and Dutch goods from the Dutch East Indies to Copenhagen. This led to the English Wars during which Britain destroyed the Danish - Norwegian fleet, devastated the Danish East India Company's India trade, and occupied Dansborg and Frederiksnagore from 1801 to 1802, and again, from 1808 to 1815. Italy made an attempt at buying the Nicobar Islands from Denmark - Norway between 1864 and 1868. The Italian Minister of Agriculture and Commerce Luigi Torelli started a negotiation that looked promising, but failed due to the unexpected end of his Office and the first La Marmora Cabinet. The negotiations were interrupted and never brought up again. The Danish - Norwegian colonies went into decline, and the British ultimately took possession of them, making them part of British India: Serampore was sold to the British in 1839, and Tranquebar and most minor settlements in 1845 (11 October 1845 Frederiksnagore sold; 7 November 1845 other continental Danish India settlements sold); on 16 October 1868 all Danish - Norwegian rights to the Nicobar Islands, which since 1848 had been gradually abandoned, were sold to Britain.  Legacy  After the Danish - Norwegian colony of Tranquebar was ceded to the British, it lost its special trading status and had its administrative roles transferred to Nagapattinam. The town rapidly dwindled in importance, although the expansion of the British into South India led to Tranquebar becoming a hub for missionary activity for some time and a place particularly known for training native priests. By the end of the 19th century, the mission established by Ziegenbalg was functioning entirely independently and lives on today as the Tamil Evangelical Lutheran Church. Fort Dansborg at Tranquebar was established in 1620. Now primarily a fishing village, the legacy of the Dano-Norwegian colonial presence is entirely local but can be seen in the architecture of the small town that lies within the boundaries of the old (and long gone) city walls. In fact, journalist Sam Miller describes the town as the most recognisably European of the former colonial settlements. Although only a handful of colonial buildings can be definitely dated to the Danish era, many of the town's residential buildings are in classical styles that would not be dissimilar to those of the era and that contribute to the historic atmosphere. The remaining Danish - Norwegian buildings include a gateway inscribed with a Danish Norwegian Royal Seal, a number of colonial bungalows, two churches and principally – the Dansborg Fort, constructed in 1620. The Dansburg Fort was declared a protected monument by the Government of Tamil Nadu in 1977 and now houses a museum dedicated to the Danes Norwegian in India. There are no known descendants of the Danish Norwegian settlers in or around the town. Since 2001, Danes have been active in mobilising volunteers and government agencies to purchase and restore Danish colonial buildings in Tranquebar. St. Olav's Church, Serampore still stands. In 2017 a major heritage restoration project commenced in Serampore, West Bengal.

The land for the priory was purchased by (then) Father Edward Dominic Fenwick, O.P. (later Bishop of Cincinnati) in July 1806 with money received from an inheritance. He bought an existing farm west of Springfield, Kentucky. Construction began shortly thereafter, including a church, priory, and college. The college was begun in 1808 but the building was not finished until 1812. It was named Saint Thomas' College, after St. Thomas Aquinas. Its most famous student was Jefferson Davis, the future president of the Confederacy during the Civil War. The church was named for St. Rose. Though not designated a cathedral, the church served in the role of a cathedral until the Basilica of Saint Joseph Proto-Cathedral could be built in nearby Bardstown, Kentucky. The church is in a stone Tudor-Gothic style architecture and includes an octagonal tower.

According to the author, Paradise completes a \\"trilogy\\" that begins with Beloved (1987) and includes Jazz (1992). Paradise was chosen as an Oprah's Book Club selection for January 1998 and ranked in the BlackBoard Bestsellers List the following August. Morrison wanted to call the novel War but was overridden by her editor.Anna Mulrine, \\"This side of 'Paradise': Toni Morrison defends herself from criticism of the novel Paradise\\", U.S. News & World Report, January 19, 1998, posted at Swarthmore U website (accessed February 29, 2008). Plot The novel is structured into nine sections. The first is named \\"Ruby\\" after the town on which the book centers. The rest are named for women implicated variously in the life of the town and the Convent. The Convent women are Mavis, Grace (known as \\"Gigi\\"), Seneca, Divine (whose name is actually \\"Pallas\\"), and Consolata (also known as \\"Connie\\"). The Ruby women – or children, in the case of Save-Marie – are Patricia and Lone. Though the chapters are named for specific characters, in telling their stories, Morrison tells the parallel histories of the town of Ruby and the Convent 17 miles south of it, and how the men of Ruby become intent on destroying the Convent women. Ruby Paradise opens in 1976 with nine men going in for the kill. They are the prominent men of Ruby, a purposefully isolated, peaceful all-black town in Oklahoma with a population of 360. In this group are the twins Steward and Deacon \\"Deek\\" Morgan, the de facto leaders of the town. Throughout the book we gradually learn why Ruby was founded, the history of the failed town of Haven that preceded it, and the reasons for Ruby's rigid hierarchies and stringent exclusion of outsiders, to the point where the town's leaders decide they must eliminate the nearby Convent which in fact is not a convent but rather a former embezzler's mansion now inhabited by a group of women with troubled pasts. Before Ruby, there was Haven. Founded in Oklahoma in 1890, Haven was founded by a group containing nine complete families (the Blackhorses, Beauchamps, Catos, two DuPres families, Fleetwoods, Floods, Morgans, and Pooles) and fragments of others. The founding fathers, led by Zechariah Morgan, are motivated to found a new community by the exclusion they face from public life and job opportunities, both as black men and particularly as dark-skinned black men. When they arrive in the place where they decide to situate their new town, they first built a large and sturdy Oven of brick and iron, even though they are living in wagons and sod shelters. The Oven both nourishes them and serves as a symbol of everything they have achieved. Haven flourishes for several decades but falters in the post World War II period. Returning from service, the twins Deacon and Steward Morgan perceive that not much has changed in the outside world since Haven was founded: there is still rampant colorism and anti-black discrimination. Preferring to renew the mission begun by their forefathers of self-sufficient isolation from the outside world, in 1949 they lead a group of 15 families out of Haven to establish a new all-black town. The men take the Oven with them when they leave Haven at the expense of other supplies, and painstakingly rebuild it when they arrive, although in the new town it serves principally a symbolic rather than practical purpose. Though called \\"New Haven\\" in the interim, it is eventually named \\"Ruby\\", after the younger sister of the Morgan twins who dies when she is repeatedly refused medical attention because of her race. The name of the town, therefore, belies the way in which it is founded out of the indignation of exclusion, and the inability of black men to “protect” black women in the outside world. The inhabitants are proud of the fact that Ruby has no jail or cemetery because it has never needed either; besides Ruby Smith herself and Delia Best, no one has ever died on its soil. Though there are 15 founding families of Ruby, we learn that there are hierarchies. Of the 15 there were nine considered racially pure, a number that has dwindled to seven. The Morgan twins are able to assume unchallenged power in the town because their father founded the bank, and they, therefore, have amassed the most money and property. Ruby becomes the inverse of the outside world: though whites are hated in an abstract way, light-skinned blacks are specifically discriminated against–if not, ideally, kept out altogether. Though for some of its residents Ruby is a reprieve from the race-based discrimination of the world “Out There,” it still has a strongly patriarchal structure. The town's strict racial codes have harmed some of its residents severely. Menus’ alcoholism, though publicly attributed to his experiences during the Vietnam War, seems to stem from the shame and despair he has felt ever since he abandoned the light-skinned woman he intended to marry. Likewise, the men of Ruby refuse to seek outside medical help in an emergency for Delia Best, Roger Best's light-skinned wife, causing her to die in childbirth in a tragic mirror of Ruby Smith's experience. At the point at which the book opens, there is great anxiety about Ruby's future. The town has seen increasingly open signs of division. Steward and Dovey Morgan have not been able to have children and Deek and Soane's sons die at war, leaving no Morgan heir to Ruby's leadership besides K.D. Smith, an often insolent young man who angers his uncles by spending time chasing after Gigi, one of the Convent women. The Reverend Richard Misner, a young upstart recently arrived in town, is deeply invested in the civil rights struggle, models himself after Martin Luther King, and believes Ruby needs to be more open to the changes afoot in the outside world; in turn, the older generations believe he is engendering radicalism and rebelliousness among the town's youth. The Oven has been taken over as a hangout spot for local youth, and one day it is graffitied with a Black Power fist with red-painted nails. The elder generations believe that the young do not understand or respect Ruby's history, encapsulated in their desire to modify the slogan that appears on the Oven: though it now says only \\"… the Furrow of his Brow\\", the town elders claim it used to say \\"Beware\\" at the beginning, whereas the younger generation wishes to make it \\"Be the Furrow of his Brow\\". Finally, the town is scandalized when the Convent women make a rowdy appearance at K.D. and Arnette's wedding, a wedding partly intended to ease the conflict between the Morgan and Fleetwood families and to conceal Arnette's earlier aborted pregnancy by K.D. Eventually, after a series of selectively interpreted \\"signs\\", and based on the perception that the Convent is corrupting the town with its amorality and purported witchcraft, Sergeant Person, Wisdom Poole, Arnold and Jeff Fleetwood, Harper and Menus Jury, Steward and Deacon Morgan, and K.D. Smith decide during a meeting at the Oven to destroy the Convent. The Convent The Convent is an elaborate mansion built by an embezzler in an isolated part of Oklahoma. Its architecture reflects both its creator's hedonism and his paranoia: shaped like the cartridge of a gun, it is windowless in one end. The paranoia is justified because the embezzler lives only briefly in the mansion before he is arrested by Northern lawmen. The mansion then falls into the hands of some Catholic nuns, the presence of which is an anomaly in the principally Protestant Oklahoma. The property becomes widely known as ‘the Convent’ although it serves principally as a boarding school for Indian girls where they are educated to forget their culture. The Mother Superior Mary Magna is the administrator of the school and is faithfully served by Consolata, a woman she kidnapped when the latter was an orphan living in destitution. During this period, the families from Haven have settled into the area 17 miles south of the Convent. There is not much interaction between the Convent and the town, though Mary Magna is glad to have a pharmacy close by. On one trip into Ruby, Consolata spots Deacon \\"Deek\\" Steward, with whom she has a two-month affair that ends when she repulses him with the carnal intensity of her desire. When the foundation that funds the school begins to run out of money, the nuns are gradually reassigned or moved on to other posts, and the last two Indian girls run away. However, Mary Magna, Sister Roberta, and Consolata remain behind. In order to maintain the Convent and avoid incurring debt, the women begin a burgeoning business from things they produce on their property; in addition to their renowned extra-hot peppers, they also sell relishes, barbecue sauce, pies, and eggs. Eventually, Sister Roberta moves into a nursing home and Consolata dedicates herself to the care of Mary Magna, who falls into a long illness. It is around this time that women begin to arrive at the Convent. They arrive by accident, in flight from fraught lives (abusive husbands and dead babies; parental betrayal or neglect; abandonment by lovers and violent pasts), but one by one they seem drawn into staying permanently. The first is Mavis; Gigi, Seneca, and Pallas then follow. They do not all get along – Mavis and Gigi in particular often clash. However, they seem to find in the Convent an escape from troubled circumstances (often related to men) where they are listened to and cared for without judgment. Though they may leave from time to time, the women always return. In the same way, during this stage of the Convent's history, women of Ruby – as well as one man, Menus – come to the Convent in times of need. The problems and compulsions that the elder statesmen of Ruby would prefer to sweep under the rug seem inevitably to end up at the Convent. Soane, Deek's wife, comes to confront Connie about her affair and ends up becoming her friend, from whom she later receives \\"tonics\\" that help ease her mind in the aftermath of her sons’ deaths at war. Arnette becomes pregnant by K.D. and stays at the Convent to carry the pregnancy to term, though she tries and succeeds in inducing an abortion by self-harm (Ruby residents speculate that the Convent women beat her and caused her to lose the baby, a lie that Arnette encourages). Billie Delia stays at the Convent after a violent fight with her mother, who believes, like the rest of the town, that she is wild and promiscuous. K.D. carries on a two-year affair with Gigi, who leaves him, solidifying his hatred of the Convent. The women of the Convent care for Menus as he recovers from alcoholism. Throughout the novel, the women of the Convent provide a safe haven for all those who come to its doorstep. However, the Convent is widely perceived as a corrupting influence in Ruby, the source of their problems rather than where problems must go because of Ruby's intolerant atmosphere. Instead of considering the roots of the conflicts in Ruby (such as the unspoken prejudice against light-skinned blacks, borne of the rejection the original families experienced on their journey to found Haven; or the yearning of the young people to be part of the larger world and participate in the civil rights movement), community leaders decide that the Convent must be destroyed. Under their rhetoric, the men of Ruby are both frightened and disgusted by the idea of women who do not need – and, in fact, actually, shun – men. They also have various selfish motivations behind their moral crusade: Sargeant Person, for example, would no longer have to pay to lease farmland from the Convent. The men solidify their plot against the women one evening at the Convent. Lone DuPres overhears the men and rushes to find someone to help her stop them because she cares about the Convent women but also because their behavior may unwittingly destroy Ruby. A group of nine men – a number mirroring the original, racially pure families that founded Ruby – venture to the Convent under cover of darkness with guns, shooting the women on sight. Some of the women fight back, injuring Arnold, Jeff Fleetwood, Harper Jury, and Menus, but eventually, the men shoot them down in the field as they escape. In the middle of this chaos, Lone and the willing townspeople she has assembled arrive at the Convent. Under censure none of the men claims responsibility or intent to kill; everyone fears the white law they presume will be involved now that they have killed a white woman. However, Deek Steward speaks up to acknowledge culpability, signaling a break with his twin brother Steward, with whom he has agreed on everything for decades. However, when Roger Best arrives to bury the bodies, he finds nothing. Mavis’ Cadillac is also gone. From this, many in Ruby conclude that the women somehow survived and drove away. Lone, however, believes that it is a sign from God, who has taken the bodies of his servants to Heaven whole, in the manner of Mary at the Assumption. The town carries on, relieved that the absence of bodies spares them the attention of white law enforcement. Each man involved tells a different story of what happened. If not for Luther Beauchamp, Pious DuPres, and Deed and Aaron Sands, who corroborate Lone's version, the town might even have proceeded as though it never happened. However, Lone observes that though the bodies themselves might have disappeared, the ramifications of the attack are evident in the town. Menus succumbs to his renewed alcoholism. Deek is unusually troubled and goes to the Reverend Richard Misner for spiritual assistance. K.D. and Arnette continue to build their family and look forward to assuming a position in town where they can make life difficult for K.D.'s critics. Most of all, there is a sensation that the deal brokered by Ruby’s founders with God is broken and that death has finally arrived in town: the last chapter takes place at the funeral of Save-Marie, one of Jeff and Sweetie Fleetwood’s disabled children. The town remains divided, but Richard Misner decides to stay, in part because he feels he can be useful in this flawed town where change and forces of the outside world must inevitably arrive. Paradise closes with a passage about each of the Convent women. Gigi, Pallas, Mavis, and Seneca appear suddenly and surprisingly to figures from their past, each of whom expresses regret and sadness. Gigi’s father, whom we discover for the first time and learn has been in prison since Gigi was eleven, spots her by a lake and encourages her to stay in touch with him. Pallas’ mother, Dee Dee, believes she spots Pallas with a baby near her house, but is unable to speak coherently to flag her attention. Sally Albright, whom we know as Sal from the “Mavis” chapter, spots her mother in a diner, and the two women apologize to each other. Jean, the woman Seneca believed was her sister, is revealed to be her mother. Jean believes she spots Seneca in a stadium parking lot, but Seneca does not remember her. Connie rests her head in the lap of an older woman from her past, Piedade, who sings to her as they face the ocean in a place called \\"Paradise\\". Morrison has said in an interview on PBS that she started with race (\\"They shoot the white girl. . . \\") and then erased it by never revealing who the white girl is. =Ruby chapter= The book begins with the well-known sentence \\"They shoot the white girl first.\\" Never revealing who that character is, it leaves the reader to wonder. A group of nine men enter the building known as the \\"Convent\\", which is now more of a shelter for battered women. As the men search the Convent they clearly indicate their feelings towards it. Because the men are in this house, the story is written to make it seem like the Convent was a sinister place, a shameful place in the men's eyes, one negative statement being \\"in a place that once housed Christians – well, Catholics anyway – not a cross of Jesus anywhere\\" (7). During this search we find out several things about the men searching. Two of the men are wearing ties, while another set are a father and son, and finally a pair of brothers are among the posse. Ruby is also the town named after Ruby Morgan who died after their journey to this new place of hope, after being denied aid at other black towns and hospitals. They left Haven escaping the economic downturn and the increasing pressure from neighboring towns. Several families founded Ruby but the majority of the credit belongs to the Morgans due to their monetary influence. On their journey, they saw many other black towns that refused them acceptance, illustrating the exclusivity defining one's own paradise and the fear of letting the outside in. This may have led to the hatred of the women living in the Convent, without any real reason except the fact they are outside the calm setting of Ruby. =Mavis chapter= Mavis is a mother who kills her infant twins Merle and Pearl by suffocation when she leaves them in the car while she goes into a grocery store. It is unclear whether it was an accident or she has some sort of mental illness. Her husband Frank is an alcoholic and abusive, which contributes to blowing her fears and anxieties out of proportion. She fears that her husband and three kids, Sal, Frankie, and Billy James, are going to kill her. She waits for her husband to go to sleep then she sneaks out of her house and steals his car, a mint green Cadillac, escaping her family. At 5:30 am she arrives at Peg's house (neighbor) but when no one answers she realizes it's a bad idea and decides to go somewhere farther away. She gets gas for the car and drives to her mom's house in Paterson, five hours away. Her mother says that Frank already called her at 5:30 and she told him she did not know Mavis' whereabouts. Mavis tells her mom that she feared her family was going to kill her. Her mother thinks Mavis is crazy for thinking this. She stays there for a few days. Later, she hears her mom on the phone saying, \\"you better get up here pronto\\". This freaks her out and she takes the car keys her mom hid plus a few essential items and hits the road. She went to Newark and had the Cadillac painted magenta in order to avoid detection. Mavis decides she wants to go to California. She has little money so she picks up female hitchhikers to have them help pay the way and keep her company. The first woman was Sandra. She wore 6 dog tags and talked a lot. The next women stole her clip she got at her mothers, and the next two women wanted to go to a cemetery to honor an army man. The last woman was Bennie. She liked to sing songs and listen to the radio. She stole Mavis's rain boots and coat. She disappeared while Mavis was in the bathroom at a pit stop. When Mavis returned the bathroom key, she sees a man who she believes is Frank looking at her car. He has let his hair grow out and is wearing a leather jacket and chains with a shirt open to the navel. She looks again and he's gone. She is worried that he recognized the car because the license plate is still the same. She goes out to her car and pays the attendant. The man appears in her rightside mirror. Mavis freaks out and drives away without thinking of what road she needed to get on. She becomes lost and then runs out of gas. She drinks alcohol that Frank had left in the car and goes to sleep. The next morning she gets out of the car and decides to walk and find a place to help her. She walks a long way and finds a house on a farm lot. She meets a woman outside named Connie. Connie is nice to her and feeds her. Soane Morgan comes to the house and gives Connie new sunglasses. Connie asks Soane to help her get gasoline for Mavis. Sloane takes Mavis to a gas station where a young black man takes Mavis back to her car with the gasoline. The man talks to Mavis and says how he thinks Connie is strange. She returns with her car to the house. She learns that it was a nun's house and a school for Indians. She also gets to meet Mother Mary Magna who had a light coming from her. She was the leader figure of the convent house. Mavis stayed at the convent instead of going to California; however, she left the convent off and on but she was there in 1976. She knew for months that there was sourness between the town and the convent ... Grace chapter Gigi (Grace) gets off the bus in Ruby as K.D. and Arnette are arguing. Arnette was pregnant with K.D.'s child and Arnette was not giving him many options. K.D. slaps Arnette due to her comments about the boys seeing Gigi walk off the bus, which turns into a town council meeting involving her father and K.D.'s uncles as well as other prominent men. We find out that Gigi gets to Ruby after being deceived by her old boyfriend Mikey. She intends to only be in Ruby a short while. She gets picked up by a man who is willing to take her to the train station. She finds that he is a hearse driver who is stopping by the Convent to pick up Mother who had recently died. We find out that the bus driver's name is Roger Best. Gigi goes inside and finds some food in the kitchen, which she begins to eat. Connie comes into the kitchen and explains how she has not slept for 17 days straight because of fear no one was there to watch her. She just wants to sleep on the kitchen floor and will do so, if Gigi watches her. Gigi feels bad about leaving her and in turn loses her ride and she stays with Connie and eats the funeral food until Connie wakes up. K.D. cannot stop thinking about Gigi so he goes to find her and ends up at the Convent. He takes her for a ride. One month passes and Mavis comes back to the convent, which she has missed so dearly. As she is walking up, she sees a girl, who is in fact Gigi, sitting naked and begins screaming at her. Connie comes out and explains to Mavis that mother has died and Gigi came the day after mother died. Mavis then explains how Gigi (Grace) will never be one of them. Symbols Within Paradise, color is used as a symbol. For example, the color green frequently shows up within the novel. On one occasion, as Mavis is heading down the highway to escape her life, \\"a green cross in the field of white slid from brilliant emergency light into shadow\\" (28). The cross symbolizes the covenant and the color green conjures up ideas of freedom, rebirth, growth, and harmony. The other references to the color green occur when the men are in the bathroom at Convent in the Ruby chapter: \\"The tile underfoot is bottle green\\" (9); when Mavis drove two hitchhikers to the cemetery, \\"Mavis lingered, amazed by the unnatural brightness of the green\\" (34); when Mother speaks of Connie, \\"When I brought her here they were green as grass\\" (47); and mentioned in the part before KD sees Gigi for the first time: \\"Behind a chain-link fence bordered by wide seamless concrete he saw green water\\" (57).

These armies were characterised by their revolutionary fervour, their poor equipment and their great numbers. Although they experienced early disastrous defeats, the revolutionary armies successfully expelled foreign forces from French soil and then overran many neighboring countries, establishing client republics. Leading generals included Jourdan, Bonaparte, Masséna and Moreau. As a general description of French military forces during this period, it should not be confused with the \\"revolutionary armies\\" (armées révolutionnaires) which were paramilitary forces set up during the Terror. Formation French line grenadier during the Revolution As the Ancien Regime gave way to a constitutional monarchy, and then to a republic, 1789–92, the entire structure of France was transformed to fall into line with the Revolutionary principles of \\"Liberty, Equality and Fraternity\\". Reactionary Europe stood opposed, especially after the French king was executed. The signing of the Declaration of Pillnitz between Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor and King Frederick William II of Prussia and the subsequent French declaration of war meant that from its formation, the Republic of France was at war, and it required a potent military force to ensure its survival. As a result, one of the first major elements of the French state to be restructured was the army. Almost all of the ancien regime officer class had been drawn from the aristocracy. During the period preceding the final overthrow of the Monarchy, large numbers of officers left their regiments and emigrated. Between 15 September and 1 December 1791 alone, 2,160 officers of the royal army fled FranceMunro Price, \\"The Fall of the French Monarchy\\", eventually to join the émigré army of Louis Joseph, Prince of Condé. Of those who stayed, many were either imprisoned or killed during the Reign of Terror. The few remaining officers from the old guard were promoted swiftly; this meant that the majority of the Revolutionary officers were far younger than their Monarchist counterparts. The high-ranking aristocratic officers who remained, among them Marquis de la Fayette, Comte de Rochambeau and Comte Nicolas Luckner, were soon accused of having monarchist sympathies and either executed or forced into exile. Revolutionary fervour, along with calls to save the new regime, resulted in a large influx of enthusiastic, yet untrained and undisciplined, volunteers. These were the first sans-culottes, so called because they wore peasants' trousers rather than the knee-breeches used by the other armies of the time. France's desperate military situation meant that these men were quickly inducted into the army. One reason for the success of the French Revolutionary Army is the \\"amalgamation\\" (amalgame) strategy organized by military strategist Lazare Carnot, later Napoleon's Minister of War. He assigned, to the same regiment (but in different battalions), both young volunteers enthusiastic at the thought of dying for liberty and old veterans from the former royal army. The transformation of the Army was most apparent in the officer corps. Before the revolution, 90% of the officers had been aristocrats, compared to only 3% in 1794. Revolutionary fervor was high, and was closely monitored by the Committee of Public Safety, which assigned Representatives on Mission to keep watch on the army generals. Indeed, during the war, some generals deserted, and others were removed or executed. The government demanded that soldiers be loyal to the government in Paris, not to their generals.Robert Doughty and Ira Gruber, ed. Warfare in the Western World: volume 1: Military operations from 1600 to 1871 (1996) p 187 1791 Reglement Officially, the Revolutionary Armies were operating along the guidelines set down in the 1791 Reglement, a set of regulations created during the years before the Revolution. The 1791 Reglement laid down several complex tactical maneuvers, maneuvers which demanded well trained soldiers, officers and NCOs to perform correctly. The Revolutionary Army was lacking in all three of these areas, and as a result the early efforts to conform to the 1791 Reglement were met with disaster. The untrained troops could not perform the complex maneuvers required, unit cohesion was lost and defeat was ensured. Realizing that the army was not capable of conforming with the 1791 Reglement, commanders began experimenting with formations which required less training to perform. Many eminent French military thinkers had been clamoring for change decades before. In the period following the humiliating performance of the French Army during the Seven Years' War, they began to experiment with new ideas. Guibert wrote his epic Essai général de Tactique, Bourcet focused on staff procedures and mountain warfare, and Mesnil-Durand spent his time advocating l'ordre profond, tactics of maneuvering and fighting in heavy columnar formations, placing emphasis on the shock of cold steel over firepower. In the 1770s, some commanders, among them the brilliant duc de Broglie performed exercises testing these tactics. It was finally decided to launch a series of experiments to try out the new tactics, and comparing them to the standard Fredrickian linear formation known as l'ordre mince which was universally popular throughout Europe. De Broglie decided that l'ordre profond worked best when it was supported by artillery and large numbers of skirmishers. Despite these exercises, l'ordre mince had strong and powerful supporters in the Royal Armée Française, and it was this formation which went into the 1791 Reglement as the standard. Trial by fire The Battle of Valmy (1792) was a decisive victory for the French. The French struck first, with an invasion of the Austrian Netherlands proposed by foreign minister Charles François Dumouriez. This invasion soon turned into a debacle when it was found that the hastily trained Revolutionary forces badly lacked obedience: on one occasion, troops murdered their general to avoid a battle; on another, troops insisted on putting their commander's orders to a vote. The Revolutionary forces retreated from the Austrian Netherlands in disarray. In August 1792, a large Austro-Prussian army commanded by the Duke of Brunswick crossed the frontier and began its march on Paris with the declared intention of restoring full power to Louis XVI. Several Revolutionary armies were easily defeated by the professional Austrian, Hessian, Brunswick and Prussian troops. The immediate result of this was the storming of the Tuileries Palace by an armed Parisian mob and the overthrow of the king. Successive Revolutionary forces failed to halt Brunswick's advance, and by mid-September it appeared that Paris would fall to the monarchists. The Convention ordered the remaining armies to be combined under the command of Dumouriez and François Christophe Kellermann. At the Battle of Valmy on 20 September 1792, the Revolutionary forces defeated Brunswick's advance guard, causing the invading army to begin retreating to the border. Much of the credit for the victory is owed to the French artillery, widely viewed as the best in Europe thanks to the technical improvements of Jean Baptiste Vaquette de Gribeauval. The Battle of Valmy ensured that the Revolutionary armies were respected and no longer underestimated by their enemies. For the next ten years, these armies not only defended the fledgling First French Republic, but under the command of Generals such as Moreau, Jourdan, Kléber, Desaix and Bonaparte expanded the borders of the French republic. Lazare Carnot While the Cannonade of Valmy had saved the Republic from imminent destruction and caused its enemies to take pause, the guillotining of Louis XVI in January 1793 and the convention's proclamation that it would 'export the revolution' hardened the resolve of France's enemies to destroy the Republic and reinstate a monarchy. In early 1793, the First Coalition was formed, not only from Prussia and Austria, but also Sardinia, Naples, the Dutch United Provinces, Spain and Great Britain. The Republic was under attack on several fronts, and in the fiercely Catholic region of La Vendée an armed revolt had broken out. The Revolutionary army was greatly overstretched, and it seemed that the fall of the republic was imminent. In early 1793 Lazare Carnot, a prominent mathematician, physicist, and delegate to the Convention, was promoted to the Committee of Public Safety. Displaying an exceptional talent for organization and for enforcing discipline, Carnot set about rearranging the disheveled Revolutionary Armies. Realizing that no amount of reforming and discipline was going to offset the massive numerical superiority enjoyed by France's enemies, Carnot ordered (24 February 1793 decree of the national Convention) each département to provide a quota of new recruits, a number totaling around 300,000. By mid-1793, the Revolutionary Army had increased around 645,000 men. Levée en masse On 23 August 1793, at Carnot's insistence, the Convention issued the following proclamation ordering a levée en masse :\\"From this moment until such time as its enemies shall have been driven from the soil of the Republic all Frenchmen are in permanent requisition for the services of the armies. The young men shall fight; the married men shall forge arms and transport provisions; the women shall make tents and clothes and shall serve in the hospitals; the children shall turn linen into lint; the old men shall betake themselves to the public squares in order to arouse the courage of the warriors and preach hatred of kings and the unity of the Republic\\"Hazen, C.D. - The French Revolution Vol II, pp 666 All unmarried able bodied men aged between 18 and 25 were to report immediately for military service. Those married, as well as the remaining men, women and children, were to focus their efforts on arming and supplying the army. This increased the size of the Revolutionary Armies dramatically, providing the armies in the field with the manpower to hold off the enemy attacks. Carnot was hailed by the government as the Organizer of Victory. By September 1794, the Revolutionary Army had 1,500,000 men under arms. Carnot's levée en masse had provided so much manpower that it was not necessary to repeat it again until 1797. Tactics French Revolutionary général, officer d'infanterie legere and soldier of a demi-brigade de ligne. Seeing the failure of the 1791 Reglement, several early revolutionary commanders followed de Broglie's example and experimented with the pre- revolutionary ideas, gradually adapting them until they discovered a system that worked. The final standard used by the early Revolutionary Armies consisted of the following: * Troops with exceptional morale or skill became skirmishers, and were deployed in a screen in front of the Army. Their main fighting tactics were of a guerrilla-warfare nature. Both mounted and on foot, the large swarm of skirmishers would hide from enemies if possible, pepper their formations with fire and deploy ambushes. Unable to retaliate on the scattered skirmishers, the morale and unit cohesion of the better trained and equipped émigré and monarchist armies was gradually worn down. The incessant harassing fire usually resulted in a section of the enemy line wavering, and then the 'regular' formations of the Revolutionary Army would be sent into the attack. * Troops with less skill and of more dubious quality, making up the 'regular' part of the army, were formed into battalion columns. The battalion column required little training to perfect, and provided commanders with potent \\"battering ram-style\\" formations with which to hit the enemy lines after the skirmishers had done their work. The skirmish screen also provided protection for those troops Infantry French Republican soldiers Following the dissolution of the ancien regime, the system of named regiments was abandoned. Instead, the new army was formed into a series of numbered demi- brigades. Consisting of two or three battalions, these formations were designated demi-brigades in an attempt to avoid the feudal connotations of the term Regiment. In mid-1793, the Revolutionary Army officially comprised 196 infantry demi-brigades. After the initial dismal performance of the Fédéré volunteer battalions, Carnot ordered that each demi-brigade was to consist of one regular (ex-Royal Army) and two fédéré battalions. These new formations, intended to combine the discipline and training of the old army with the enthusiasm of the new volunteers,Terry Crowdy, pages 18-19, \\"French Revolutionary Infantry 1789–1802\\", were proven successful at Valmy in September 1792. In 1794, the new demi-brigade was universally adopted. French soldiers from the 1798–1801 Egyptian campaign (left to right, clockwise): line infantry officer, line infantryman, line drummer, light infantryman. The Revolutionary Army had been formed from a hodgepodge of different units, and as such did not have a uniform appearance. Veterans in their white uniforms and tarleton helmets from the ancien regime period served alongside national guardsmen in their blue jackets with white turnbacks piped red and fédérés dressed in civilian clothes with only the red phrygian cap and the tricolour cockade to identify them as soldiers. Poor supplies meant that uniforms which had worn out were replaced with civilian clothes, and so the Revolutionary Army lacked any semblance of uniformity, with the exception of the tricolour cockade which was worn by all soldiers. As the war progressed, several demi- brigades were issued specific coloured uniform jackets, and the Revolutionary Armée d'Orient which arrived in Egypt in 1798 was uniformed in purple, pink, green, red, orange and blue jackets. Along with the problem of uniforms, many men of the Revolutionary Army lacked weapons and ammunition. Any weapons captured from the enemy were immediately absorbed into the ranks. After the Battle of Montenotte in 1796, 1,000 French soldiers who had been sent into battle unarmed were afterwards equipped with captured Austrian muskets. As a result, uniformity was also lacking in weapons. Besides the regular demi- brigades, light infantry demi-brigades also existed. These formations were formed from soldiers who had shown skill in marksmanship, and were used for skirmishing in front of the main force. As with the line demi-brigades, the light demi-brigades lacked uniformity in either weapons or equipment. Artillery Supporting the skirmishers was the French artillery. The artillery had suffered least from the exodus of aristocratic officers during the early days of the Revolution, as it was commanded mostly by men drawn from the middle class. The man who would shape the era, Napoleon Bonaparte, himself was an artilleryman. The various technical improvements of Général Jean Baptiste Vaquette de Gribeauval in the years preceding the Revolution, and the subsequent efforts of Baron du Teil and his brother Chevalier Jean du Teil meant that the French artillery was the finest in Europe. The Revolutionary Artillery was responsible for several of the Republic's early victories; for example at Valmy, on 13 Vendémiaire, and at Lodi. The revolutionary cannon played a vital role in their success. The cannon continued to have a dominating role on the battlefield throughout the Napoleonic Wars. Cavalry Hussar, line cavalryman and line infantryman, 1795–96. The cavalry was seriously affected by the Revolution. The majority of officers had been of aristocratic birth and had fled France during the final stages of the monarchy or to avoid the subsequent Terror. Many French cavalrymen joined the émigré army of the Prince du Conde. Two entire regiments, the Hussards du Saxe and the 15éme Cavalerie (Royal Allemande) defected to the Austrians. Lacking not only trained officers, but also mounts and equipment, the Revolutionary Cavalry became the worst equipped arm of the Revolutionary Army. By Mid 1793, the paper organisation of the Revolutionary Army included twenty six heavy cavalry regiments, two regiments of carabiniers, twenty dragoon regiments, eighteen regiments of chasseurs à cheval and ten hussar regiments. In reality, it was seldom that any of these regiments reached even half strength. However, unlike the infantry, where all battalions of the old Royal Army were merged with freshly raised volunteers to form new demi-brigades, the cavalry retained their regimental identities throughout the revolutionary and Napoleonic periods.

It is a part of the David Douglas School District. In 1998 Lynn Olson, author of The School-to-work Revolution: How Employers And Educators Are Joining Forces To Prepare Tomorrow's Skilled Workforce, said that David Douglas was \\"a clean, orderly, comfortable school, the kind that sprouted up all over the country in the baby boom years of the 1950s and 1960s.\\"Olson, p. 193-194. History The school is named after 19th-century Scottish botanist David Douglas, namesake of such Pacific Northwest species as the Douglas fir. Originally established in 1954, enrollment at DDHS increased quickly in subsequent years as development in suburban Portland expanded, eventually becoming one of the largest high schools in the area. In 2009 around 20 students at David Douglas, all a part of the East Precinct Youth Advisory Council, created a traffic enforcement mission at the campus in cooperation with the Portland Police Department east precinct.Bernstein, Maxine. \\"David Douglas teens put in some police work.\\" The Oregonian. Wednesday March 25, 2009. Retrieved on October 5, 2012. Campus The school has seven buildings. The first, referred to as the North Building, is dedicated to academic courses. Second is the South Building, a place for vocational fine arts. Next to the North is the pool building where health and financial classes are taught, along with a few strays. The social studies building was opened in 2007. The PAC is across from the South Building, and is where music and theatre courses are held, along with two theatres. One is a standard stadium seating theatre and the other, downstairs, is referred to as the \\"black box theatre\\". The East Campus is where the public and students with children are offered daycare. This provides the tools for child development classes. East Campus is several blocks away from the main building. David Douglas also has a garage for the automotives students located in the far corner of the parking lot behind the football stadium. The school is within a neighborhood that consists of small single-family houses.Olson, p. 193. Academics In 2008, 67% of the school's seniors received a high school diploma. Of 748 students, 500 graduated, 141 dropped out, 19 received a modified diploma, and 88 were still in high school the following year. =Project STARS= In 1991 the school district introduced the Project STARS (Students Taking Authentic Routes to Success) \\"school-to-work\\" program after a survey concluded that, of the recent graduates of the school, 20% went on to four-year colleges. Anthony Palerimini, the superintendent, said, \\"We were doing an excellent job of providing a well-rounded college prep education. But it wasn't relevant to 25 to 30 percent of our students.\\"\\"Career-oriented high school begins transition to work.\\" Eugene Register-Guard. Wednesday October 26, 1994. p. 4D. Retrieved from Google News (16 of 26) on October 5, 2012. The program introduced students to various career fields. The Oregon Business Council, an organization representing forty chief executive officers from the largest companies in the state, partnered with the David Douglas district in implementing the program. When each student was in high school, he or she selected one of six \\"constellations\\" (concentrations) in which he or she would concentrate his or her electives in. Each constellation requires a student to take a capstone course, related courses, job shadows, and work experience. The Oregon Business Council implemented committees, together with 12 members, to develop a business and administration certificate of advanced mastery and a production and technology certification of advanced mastery. In the fall of 1994 the district planned to begin offering courses in these areas, and planned to add four more certificates in the 1995-1996 school year. In 1994 the Associated Press referred to the David Douglas School District as \\"a leader in Oregon's movement toward more career-oriented schools\\" due to the school-to-work program courses. The AP added that \\"It may serve as a model for other districts as they forge new ties with the world of work.\\" Demographics As of 2019, the school had 2,729 students. 716 9th grade students, 736 10th grade students, 660 11th grade students and 617 12th grade students. Of the 2,729 students 25.9% were Hispanic, .6% Native American, 18.6% Asian, 11.8% Black, 2% Pacific Islander, 34.7% White, and 6.3% Multi. 14% of students were on a reduced lunch program, and 55.5% were on a free lunch program totaling 69.5%.

Personal life Mary Esther Harding was born in Shropshire, England the fourth of six daughters of dental surgeon, William Harding. (A son died, aged five-and-a- half, a month before she was born. Coming so soon after his death, Esther maintained throughout her life that her being a girl was a bitter disappointment to her parents.) She was an avid reader and was home-schooled until the age of eleven. Harding and her sisters were encouraged by their parents to learn. Three of them attended university in the first two decades of the 20th century. Career =Medical training= Harding attended the London School of Medicine for Women, intending to become a missionary doctor. She graduated in 1914 in a class of nine students. She interned at the Royal Infirmary in London, the only hospital in London to accept women interns at the time. In 1919 she was the first recipient of the William Gibson Research Scholarship for Medical Women, awarded by the Royal Society of Medicine. She wrote her first book, The Circulatory Failure of Diphtheria,Mentioned in the Index-Catalogue of the Library of The Surgeon General’s Office, United States Army, 1923 but contracted the disease herself. Once she had recovered, with her father's financial help, she set up in private practice in London. She did very well, and had a keen interest in cardiology. Later she became interested in psychiatry, which was then only beginning to be taken seriously.[citation needed] A friend, Constance Long, gave her Beatrice Hinkle’s translation of Psychology of the Unconscious by Carl Gustav Jung. This prompted Harding to move to Switzerland, in 1922, to study under him, along with a small group of other students attending Jung's Küsnacht home near Zurich.[citation needed] In 1923, Harding and H.G. Baynes organised a conference, held in Polzeath, Cornwall, where Jung gave daily lectures in the village hall to around 30 students. She described this, and two other conferences, in a paper delivered before the First International Congress for Analytical Psychology held in Zurich in August 1958, later published in Contact with Jung, edited by Michael Fordham. =Psychoanalyst= While in Zürich, Harding developed a close relationship with Eleanor Bertine, who had arrived there in 1919 with Kristine Mann, after attending an International Conference of Medical Women. In 1924, Harding and Bertine relocated to New York City, where they lived for many years at 88 Morningside Drive, New York. Harding developed an extensive practice as a psychoanalyst, becoming one of the chief exponents of Jung’s teachings and, as a leading member of the Karl Jung Foundation, lectured widely in the United States and in Europe. She wrote extensively, mainly in English but also in German. Each year Harding and Bertine would travel to Zürich for two months of analysis and spend summers at \\"The Inner Ledge\\", Bailey Island, Maine, the ancestral summer home of Kristine Mann. There they saw analysands from the United States and Canada in a quiet, comfortable setting away from the distractions of daily life and conducive to profound experiences of the unconscious. =The Way of All Women, Women's Mysteries and early feminist psychoanalysis= Published in 1933 and 1935 respectively, The Way of All Women and Women's Mysteries were pioneering works in the field of psychology from a feminist perspective, exploring topics such as work, marriage, motherhood, old age and women's relationships, from a Jungian standpoint. Jung himself praised both as an accurate application of Jungian theory. In his introduction to The Way of All Women, he wrote: \\"Drawing on her rich psychotherapeutic experience, Dr. Harding has sketched a picture of the feminine psyche which, in scope and thoroughness, far surpasses previous works in this field.\\"M. Esther Harding, The Way of All Women, Shambhala, 2001 =Jungian Community= M. Esther Harding became influential in the New York City Jungian Analytical psychology community. She was a prodigious writer and a frequent lecturer in the United States and Canada. Her first book on analytical psychology, entitled The Way of All Women, was an instant-best seller and has been translated into many languages and introduced many people to Jung's psychology. Harding wrote many other well-known books, including: Psychic Energy, Women's Mysteries, The Parental Image, and The I and not I, along with numerous papers on a variety of subjects from depression to religion. Harding helped to found many Jungian organizations, such as the Analytical Psychology Club of New York in 1936, the Medical Society for Analytical Psychology - Eastern Division in 1946, and the C.G. Jung Foundation for Analytical Psychology in 1963. =Death= She died in her sleep on 4 May 1971 in a London airport hotel, on her way back to New York from Greece via her sister's house in Shrewsbury. She was survived by her elder sister, Olive Elwin née Harding, who had studied Mathematics at Cambridge University in the 1900s and was married to a grandson of William Stephen Jacob.

Malek National Library and Museum Institution (MNLMI) is the first private museum of Iran and one of the six large libraries holding exquisite manuscripts. The MNLMI collection is a rich trove of the best manuscripts and Iranian historical artworks. The Institution is located in the historical precinct of “Bagh-e Melli” that is considered the cultural-historical center of Tehran. The MNLM visitors include a large number of university students and researchers, as well as tourists who enjoy its library and museum facilities. It is one of the biggest libraries of precious manuscripts in Iran, built by Hadji Hussein Agha Malek, at the time the richest man in Iran. He built it in a traditional Persian architecture style. One of the biggest contributors is Esat Malek Malek, Hadji Hussein Agha Malek's eldest daughter, who contributed to the museum's development.  Haj Hossein Aqa Malek  Haj Hossein Aqa Malek (1871-1972), the founder and donor of MNLM was born and died in Tehran. Both his grandfather and father were among the greatest merchants during the past two centuries in Iran. Haj Hossein’s father, Haj Mohammad Kazem Malek-ol-Tojjar, left him a large inheritance after his death, including a lot of properties and gardens in Tehran and Khorasan Province. The young Hossein while traveling to Mashhad, the capital of Khorasan Province at that time, to manage the family’s assets, got familiar with some Iranian-Islamic artworks, including a fine manuscript. This experience laid the ground for the establishment of an exquisite library and museum in coming decades. In 1908, Haj Hossein Aqa Malek founded a big library consist of both old manuscripts and printed books in Mashhad. Later on, he moved the library to his historical house located in the area of Tehran Grand Bazaar and thus provided free of charge access for the interested scholars. While collecting the manuscripts, Haj Malek bought a valuable collection of historical artworks that led into the establishment of the first private museum in the history of Iran. In 1937, he donated his invaluable library and museum to Astan-e Qods-e Razavi, as the greatest religious and cultural institution in Iran, with the aim to be visited and used by the public during his lifetime and after his death. He also donated many of his properties in Tehran and Khorasan for charity and public affairs so that he was known as the greatest donor of the contemporary history of Iran. Among his charitable acts are granting more than 2.5 million square meters of land to build houses for the teachers and the employees of the Ministries of Health and Post in Khorasan Province; donating Vakil-Abad’s 480-hectares garden to the people of Mashhad for the purpose of converting it to a public park; contributing the garden of Malek Palace in Shahr-e Ray for building a school; and endowing more than 60,000 hectares of properties including farmlands, gardens, and animal husbandries to Astan-e Qods-e Razavi. According to the MNLM deed of endowment, Haj Hossein Aqa Malek had stipulated that MNLM is a non-profit institution aimed at expanding the knowledge among the people. He has also mentioned that his collection would be available to both Iranian and foreign addressees.  Malek National Library and Museum: A Treasure of the Best Historical Artworks  Besides the printed books and historical periodical documents, Malek National Library possesses 19000 rare and exquisite manuscripts that provide a very good resource for many scholars and students. Malek National Museum also consists of a collection of precious artworks of the Iranian history since the first millennium B.C. to present that is classified as follows: 1- The collection of artworks included paintings by famous Iranian artists such as Kamal-ol-Molk, miniature paintings, illuminated manuscripts, and some works by European painters. 2- The lacquer art collection contained pen boxes, book covers, and mirror-cases decorated with lacquer paintings. 3- The historical coins collection consisted of about 9000 pieces of coins and Iranian medals minted since the first millennium B.C. to present. 4- The collection of 100,000 postage stamps included the first stamps printed in Iran and the ones printed abroad. 5- The collection of artworks donated by lady Ezzat-Malek Malek, the daughter of Haj Hossein Aqa Malek composed of Qajar paintings, manuscripts, documents, pen boxes, hookah bowls, as well as lacquer works. 6- The calligraphy collection embraced the artworks of the greatest and well-known Iranian and Islamic artists. 7- The collection of decorating arts included carpets, rugs, vases, chandeliers, and furniture 8- The collection of Haj Hossein Aqa Malek’s personal belongings, including his artworks, writings, and portraits displayed in the exclusive Exhibition Room of Haj Hossein Aqa Malek 9- The gallery of periodic exhibitions held regularly on traditional Iranian Islamic arts.  The facilities and attractions of MNLM  In 1996, the Malek National Library and Museum was moved from Malek’s historical house located in the area of Tehran Grand Bazaar to its present building in the historical precinct of Bagh-e Melli. The six-story new building has been structured based on the Islamic architecture and arts. MNLM has a unique location for it is situated in the cultural-historical center of Iran’s capital city, next to the Meidan-e Mashq (a place for military activities left since Qajar period) historical portal. MNLM outstanding neighboring buildings include the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and a collection of museums such as the National Museum of Iran (Iran-e Bastan), Sepah Bank Coin Museum, Ebrat Museum (formerly a prison), Iran Science and Technology Museum, Post Museum, Glassware and Ceramic Museum of Iran (Abgineh Museum), and Iran Customs’ Museum and Historical Documents Center. 30- Tir Street is one of the ways to access MNLM. This historical street is well known as the Religions’ Street because of certain buildings located on it, including two churches, a fire temple, as well as a synagogue next to a mosque. In this way this Street, because of its special characteristics is considered as one of the important centers of tourism in Tehran for its daily domestic and international visitors. Regarding the urban geography, the existence of Imam Khomeini Central Metro Station, a taxi terminal, as well as two bus terminals located near MNLM, has facilitated the visitors and scholars’ access. Besides the scholars and university students who enjoy the free of charge access to Malek Library facilities, there are also daily individual or group visitors, either Iranians or non-Iranians, who benefit from MNLM treasures. Among the most important activities and programs of the MNLM are conducting periodic and seasonal exhibitions concerning the traditional medicine, calendar, constellations, and decorative arts as well as holding meetings and specialized training workshops on traditional Iranian- Islamic arts such as miniature, calligraphy, lacquer painting, and making marbled papers.  Temporary exhibitions  thumb  exhibition of Sitting: Selective Collection of Malek Library and Museum  Artworks are not only for capturing figures of men, they are also symbols of social behaviors and life styles which during the time take different meanings. Sitting, in Iranian culture, has its own poems and proverbs and each style addresses differently. This exhibition is a narration of sitting, with its proverbs lied with artworks of Malek national library and museum. Idioms and proverbs on “nešastan” (siting) Bar sare pāy nešastan: Squatting Pase zānu nešastan: sorrowful sitting Kaj nešastan va rāst goftan: an ironical idiom which means being drunk but saying the truth Do zānu nešastan: a way of sitting which includes leaning the knees under the legs to show the politeness of a subaltern before an elder Be zānu nešāndan: defeat, vanquish Bar sare yek pā nešastan: sitting on one leg in a way that the other leg is bent before the belly vertically Gerdpāy nešastan: crossed-leg sitting Be zānu nešastan: sitting on the knee, sitting politely Bast nešastan: staying in the “bast” (“Bast” is a place for the criminals to take refuge in) Saḥrānešin: Nomad Majles nešin:the one who is a member of a session or meeting Bardar nešin: beggars who stay before the houses Parde nešin: anchorite Taḵt nešin:a king with the throne Ḵāk nešin:forlorn and lonely Ḵarābāt nešin:the one who stays in the tavern Sajjāde nešin:ascetic Guše nešin:withdrawn, dissociable, hermit Masnad nešin: the one who sits on the throne, the one who has the power Ham nešin:companion  Islamic Schools According to the Manuscript Collection of Malek National Library and Museum  date : 13 December 2016 At the advent of the Islamic civilization “Ketāb” (the Book) was recognized as the miracle of Muhammad and the prevailing attribute of this civilization, and it started to develop and to gain in eminence, and it nurtured in a milieu of the “book”-related findings and phenomena of the ancient civilizations of Greece, Persia, and China. It was first in Bayt al-Hikma (House of Wisdom) that Greek and Alexandrian codicology and manuscript illumination attracted translators and codicologists. In those early years, with the arrival of Persian secretaries as “scribes” (kātebs) in the Abbasid court, the findings of the dabīrs (scribes) of the Sasanian Iran found its way to the realm of manuscript and codicology, and the scribe (kāteb) found a high and distinguished status. Aside from the circle of the bureaucrat scribes, however, others were also engaged in writing manuscripts, including warrāqs (paper sellers/booksellers) and the scholars. Besides, the librarians in public or private libraries also were somehow involved in scribing. In more recent periods, apart from the bureaucrat scribes, the calligraphers as well as groups known as modhahheb (gilder), mojalled (binder), talākūb (gold inlay maker), medādsāz (pencil- maker) were each also involved, in a way, in producing the manuscripts, and, during centuries, this led to the turning points of scribing in the Iranian and Islamic tradition. Along with administrative and bureaucratic scribing and copying of manuscripts, the Islamic schools, as another center of scribing, have always played a major role in the survival of the scribing tradition. One of the important features of the manuscripts scribed at the centers of teaching and learning is the corrections mentioned by the tutor when the tutee read out the text, sometimes written on the margins of the manuscript and sometimes on separate sheets later added to the book. Aside from the original, these manuscripts are of importance, due to their proximity to the writing form of the author of the work, and their consistency and accuracy of recording. The amount of effort dedicated to the field of scribing and manuscript illumination, on the one hand, and the erudite diligence of scholars and seekers of knowledge, on the other, joined the Islamic “miracle of the book” with the “book-believing civilization”, leaving a legacy called “the manuscript,” which is most treasured and cultivating, and worthy to be appreciated and safeguarded. Within the manuscript collection of Malek National Library and Museum Institution, there are numerous manuscripts scribed by the seekers of knowledge and scholars at the centers of learning and teaching. Among these works, one can find instances from all across the Islamic domain of thought and civilization: from Cairo, Damascus, and Diyarbakir to Herat, Samarkand, and Tashkent; from Dār al-Salṭaneh (House of Monarchy) of Rey, Dār al-Molk (House of the State) of Esfahan, and Dār al- Khalāfeh (House of Caliphate) of Tehran, to Qūchān, Abarkūh, and Shūreh village. We are going to watch some of these works together. thumb  Permanent exhibition of stamps  See also *Safir Office Machines Museum *National Library of Iran *Cultural Heritage Organization of Iran *Qajar dynasty *Hadji Hossein Agha Malek *List of museums in Iran  References   External links  * *Video on Malek museum * On Ezzat Malek {http://iranfrontpage.com/news/society/lifestyles/2014/07/iranian- benefactress-ezzat-malek-dies/} *https://www.asia.si.edu/collections/new- acquisitions/soudavar.asp Category:Libraries in Iran Category:Culture in Tehran Category:Museums in Tehran Category:National museums of Iran ","title":"Malik National Museum of Iran"},{"id":"3413511","text":"Gerald Edwind Fitch (born August 12, 1982) is an American professional basketball player for Regatas Corrientes of the Liga Nacional de Básquet.

Army In some armies of the world, the senior captain is a rank between a regular captain and a major. The rank is often only found in armies and air forces. A similar position to that of navy senior captain is the rank of senior colonel. =Asian armies= the rank of da wei (大尉) used by the People's Liberation Army between 1955 and 1965, are often translated as senior captain. However, the ranks and insignia derive from the practice of the Soviet Army, which has, like the Red Army before it and the Russian Army today, four company-grade officer ranks, one captain rank and three lieutenant ranks. The literal translation of those four ranks in Chinese are junior(-grade) officer, mid(-grade) officer, upper(-grade) officer, and senior(-grade) officer. Since the PLA today uses only three-company grade officer ranks, it has become conventional to translate shang wei (上尉) which originally corresponded to the Soviet rank of senior lieutenant, as captain, and hence da wei, which corresponded to the Soviet rank of captain, as senior captain. The corresponding fourth junior office rank of the Vietnamese Army, đại úy, is usually translated as captain. In the Afghan National Army and the Afghan National Police, between the ranks of turan (captain) and Jagran (major) is the rank of jag turan. In the case of the Afghan National Police, the rank of jag turan is most commonly translated as \\"staff captain\\". =European armies= The rank of senior captain is rare in Western militaries, but can be found in the German military, where the rank of Stabshauptmann (Stabskapitänleutnant in the Navy) was created in 1993 for officers of the Militärfachlicher Dienst (former NCOs in specialist positions) who could not be promoted to field grade. The Belgian Armed Forces use the rank of captain-commandant as a standard rank. Italy uses a title of primo capitano for captains (army, air force and Carabinieri) that have held the rank of captain for a long time, currently nine years or longer. In the Czechoslovak Army (and the Czechoslovak People's Army) until 1954, the rank of štábní kapitán (staff captain) was the equivalent rank. Historically, the British Army used the title of First Captain to identify the company commander in each regiment who was senior to the other company commanders. Serbian Armed Forces are using rank of Senior captain (капетан I класе) since 1860. The rank was used by the Royal Serbian Army and Royal Yugoslav Army until 1945. The new communist government has reintroduced rank of Senior captain in 1952 for Yugoslav People's Army. It was used in Armed Forces of Serbia and Montenegro until 2006. In December 2019 Ministry of Defence has decided to reintroduce rank of Senior captain into Serbian Armed Forces. Navy In some countries of the world, there is the notion of a senior captain, abbreviation \\" Sr. CAPT \\" or \\" Snr CAPT \\" . Sometimes, this is also called or indicated as commodore or flotilla captain. When similar rank existed in Imperial Russian Navy it was called not commodore, but rather captain-commander. A naval senior captain is similar to the army's senior colonel rank or in a few cases to army's brigadier general. Merchant marine or merchant navy In some merchant marines or merchant navies of the world, some captains or shipmasters, with particular and recognized seniority in terms of true and effective ocean-going ships'command, they are named senior captain, senior shipmaster, shipmaster senior grade or shipmaster highest rank, conforming to British tradition commodore - Cmde. The most senior, among others senior captains, is named first senior captain or, conforming to old British tradition, commodore 1st class - Cdre. Senior captain, abbreviation will be \\" Sr. CAPT \\" or \\" Snr CAPT \\". United States Revenue Cutter Service The rank of senior captain was used by the Revenue Cutter Service to denote a rank equivalent to a U.S. Navy commander and was established in 1908 during an overhaul of service rank structures by Congress. The rank and title of captain-commandant denoted the head of the Revenue Cutter Service and was superior to the rank of senior captain. The captain-cmmandant was equivalent in rank to a navy captain. A Revenue Cutter Service captain was equivalent to a navy lieutenant commander at the time.Johnson, p 17Larzelere, p 17 Notes =Citations= =References cited= * * Category:Military ranks ","title":"Senior captain"},{"id":"3413549","title":"147th Georgia General Assembly"},{"id":"3413555","text":"Daewi or Taewi (\\"Grand Leader\\") is a military rank in both South Korean and North Korean militaries.

Research The major and most recognised area of Philip's research was his work on the theory of infiltration. He derived the theory for one dimensional infiltration and developed equations which described the infiltration on both a short term and long term scale, with the revelation that when ponded infiltration in uniform soils occurs, the flow will approach the saturated hydraulic conductivity: : I = S \\\\sqrt{t}\\\\ + A t where S is sorptivity and A is the steady-state infiltration rate. Other areas of research include: * Examining heat and mass transfer in soils. * Philip also considered the importance of relationships between organisms and the environment. This included theories on plant canopies, with particular focus on investigation of crop stomatal or surface resistances. Philip was also responsible for the construction of the Soil plant atmosphere continuum which is used to explain the transfer of water within transpiration paths, a concept which has since been expanded upon. * Philip also studied advection, the horizontal movement of atmospheric properties e.g. temperature and while his analysis and solutions were not completed, his initial work has been important for development of solutions to problems such as long-term flux assessments.

Finding the 12.7×108mm insufficient, they began development of what became the 14.5×114mm armour-piercing round. Rukavishnikov developed an antitank rifle (:ru:Противотанковое ружьё Рукавишникова) designated M1939 to accommodate this cartridge, but it didn't have large success because of some manufacturing issues, a sufficient number of more effective anti-tank guns in the Red Army, and high expectations about new German tank armour. In 1941, the loss of huge amounts of anti-tank artillery created a need for a stop-gap anti-tank weapon, so famous USSR weapons designers such as Vasily A. Degtyaryov and Sergei G. Simonov designed two anti-tank rifles. Both were considered simpler and more suitable to wartime production than an updated Rukavishnikov rifle. Simonov used elements of his 1938 design, a 7.62mm automatic rifle. The five-round magazine is loaded into the receiver and held under pressure by a swing magazine underneath. On firing the last round, the bolt is held open, and the magazine release catch can be operated only when the bolt is locked back. The gas-operated PTRS has a tendency to jam when dirty, and the 14.5mm cartridge produces significant residue, blocking the gas port. The 14.5mm armour-piercing bullet has a muzzle velocity of 1013 m/s and devastating ballistics. It can penetrate an armour plate up to 40 mm thick at a distance of 100 meters. In 1943 Simonov used a scaled-down PTRS-41 design for the SKS-45, that would accommodate the new 1943 designed M/43 7.62×39mm cartridge. History PTRS-41 during World War II. PTRS rifle at Great Patriotic War museum in Smolensk Along with his partner Vasily Degtyaryov, Sergei Gavrilovich Simonov helped the Soviet Union develop new weapons between the First and Second World War. During this time, Degtyaryov went on to create the PTRD-41 while Simonov created and designed its cousin rifle, the PTRS-41 in 1938. As one of Simonov's creations, the PTRS-41 was sometimes known as simply the \\"Simonov\\" on the battlefield. Although more advanced, the PTRS was harder to use and less reliable than the cheaper PTRD while yielding similar performance, so the PTRD was used more often. The semi-automatic anti-tank rifle was used extensively on the Eastern Front in World War II. It was used successfully by Hero of the Soviet Union Sergeant Yakov Pavlov during the Battle of Stalingrad when the NCO led the defence of Pavlov's House in the city. After he mounted rifles on the building's roof. Because the rifles were effective against thin armor at close range, they were able to destroy numerous German Panzers that came into range because they could shoot through the thin armor on their turret-roofs. Guns captured by the Germans were given the designation 14.5 mm PzB 784(r). The AT gun was used again by Communist- backed forces in the Korean War and Chinese Civil War. PTRS-41 rifles are still in use by Donbass militiamen in Ukraine, during the Donbass War, due to their ability to penetrate APC armor. The ammunition used is actual World War II vintage.Бойовики на Донеччині викрали з музею протитанкову зброю Fakty i Kommentarii, 12 May 2014 One of the rifles was fitted with a nonorganic muzzle brake from a PTRD.

In 2012, he was glorified as a saint and passion bearer by the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia.Über das Leben und das Werk des Märtyrers Alexander von München. In: Sobor.de, 30. September 2011. Early life Schmorell's father was Hugo Schmorell, a German-born medical doctor who was raised in the Russian Empire. Schmorell's mother was Natalia Vedenskaya, a Russian and the daughter of a Russian Orthodox priest. Schmorell was baptised in the Russian Orthodox Church. His mother died of typhus during the Russian Civil War when he was two years old. In 1920 his widowed father married a German woman, Elisabeth Hoffman, who, like him, grew up in Russia. They left Russia (now then the RSFSR) and moved to Munich, Weimar Germany, in 1921, when Schmorell was four years old. His Russian nanny, Feodosiya Lapschina, came along with them and she took his late mother's place in his upbringing. Alexander Schmorell grew up bilingual, speaking both German and Russian natively. His friends gave him the nickname 'Schurik', a nickname he would be called by his closer friends for the rest of his life. He was an Eastern Orthodox Christian who considered himself both German and Russian. As declared in the Gestapo's interrogations, he was a convinced Tsarist and then an archenemy of the Bolsheviks. Military service After his Abitur (equivalent to high level High School diploma), he was called into the Reich Labour Service (Reichsarbeitsdienst) and then into the Wehrmacht (German Army during the Nazi era).Ulli Stang (Eds.): Sophie und Hans Scholl: 22. Febr. 1942 von Nazis ermordet. Edited by DKP Marburg, Stadtteilgruppe Nord Am Grün 9, Marburg 1983, p. 3. In 1938, he took part in the annexation of Austria and eventually in the invasion of Czechoslovakia. After his military service, the artistically gifted Alexander Schmorell began studies in medicine in 1939 in Hamburg. In the autumn of 1940, he went back with his student corps to Munich where he got to know Hans Scholl, and later Willi Graf. Together with Hans Scholl, Schmorell put together the White Rose's first four anti-Nazi leaflets. In the second leaflet Schmorell wrote a passage containing an outcry against the Holocaust. The Russian front In June 1942, Schmorell took part as a medical auxiliary in the campaign on the Eastern Front, together with Hans Scholl, Willi Graf and Jürgen Wittenstein, and came to strongly oppose the Nazis' treatment of enemy soldiers and civilians. Once back from Russia, he continued his studies in Munich in 1942–1943. The grave of Schmorell, named with his parents, in Munich. Dissident In December 1942, Schmorell, along with Hans Scholl, sought contact with Professor Kurt Huber. Together in 1943 they wrote the fifth leaflet, \\"Aufruf an alle Deutschen!\\" ('Appeal to all Germans!'), which Schmorell then distributed in Austrian cities. Along with Hans Scholl and Willi Graf, he also painted words such as \\"Nieder mit Hitler\\" ('Down with Hitler') and \\"Freiheit\\" ('Freedom') on house walls in Munich. It is sometimes suggested that he and Sophie Scholl (Hans' sister) shared a romance, although Sophie herself was previously engaged to Fritz Hartnagel. However, little evidence of this exists outside Lillian Groag's play The White Rose. After the arrests of Christoph Probst and Hans and Sophie Scholl, Schmorell attempted to escape to Switzerland,Dietmar Müller-Elmau (Author and Editor): Schloss Elmau – Eine deutsche Geschichte. Kösel, München 2015, p. 30. but was eventually arrested on 24 February 1943, the day of his friends' funeral, after being recognized in an air raid shelter. Trial and execution Alexander Schmorell was sentenced to death on 19 April 1943 at the Volksgerichtshof ('People's Court of Justice') in the second trial against the White Rose. In the letters he wrote from prison, he tried to console his family and assured them that he was at peace with his fate and not fearful of death. Amongst his last words, now sometimes seen inscribed in his icon, was the command \\"Vergesst Gott Nicht!\\" ('Don't Forget God!'). On 13 July 1943, at the age of 25, Schmorell was put to death by guillotine along with Kurt Huber at the Munich-Stadelheim Prison.  Sainthood  Completing the act of canonization, Alexander was glorified as a saint and passion bearer by the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia in Munich, Germany on February 5, 2012. In film Schmorell was portrayed by Johannes Suhm in the film Sophie Scholl: The Final Days.

Biography =Early life= Lorenzo A. Richards was born on April 24, 1904, in the town of Fielding, Utah, and received a B.S. and M.A. degree in Physics from Utah State University. His PhD thesis, completed at Cornell University in 1931 and entitled Capillary conduction of liquids through porous mediums, was arguably one of the best known in the field of soil physics. =Career= Following his time at Cornell, and a brief stint at Iowa State University, he spent the most part of his working life engaged in soil physics research at the United States Department of Agriculture Salinity Laboratory in Riverside, California. Research His thesis represented the first decisive progress beyond the work of Edgar Buckingham in the extension of Darcy's law to describe water movement in unsaturated soils. In this research, Richards described a partial differential equation, now commonly known by as the Richards equation. One of his key interests was the energy status of soil water, and he led the way in developing new and improved methods of measuring soil water potential. Early in his career, Richards recognised the importance of capillary potential to plant-soil relations, and described the principles, construction and operation of the tensiometer. Richards also proposed the tension plate apparatus for determining capillary potential in soil. The tensiometer was developed from the idea of using a semi-permeable, porous ceramic material to balance a pressure potential against a matric potential; once equilibrium had established, the matric potential of the soil could be determined by balancing the pressure potential. He made continual improvements to his original design and the operation of the tensiometer. The problem of measuring capillary potential beyond the range of the tensiometer was a further research interest of Richards. In 1941 he published a paper describing the pressure-membrane apparatus. Although Richards claimed the primary purpose of the apparatus was the extraction of soil solution for salinity analysis, he also pointed out its potential for application to energy studies Other work Another important element of his work was in the field of soil-water- plant relations, and led to the standardisation of characteristic soil-water properties. Together with scientists at the USDA Salinity Laboratory in Riverside, Richards correlated water content at certain water potential values with then current soil water parameters. The currently accepted moisture potential values defining the lower and upper limits for plant growth; at field capacity (−1/3 bar, or −33 J/kg) and permanent wilting point (−15 bar, or −1500 J/kg) were determined through experimental work by Richards and his colleagues. Over forty working years, he contributed much to knowledge of the energy status and transport of water in soil. He developed much of the modern apparatus and methodology used for study of soil water, hence playing a pivotal role in the transformation of knowledge on this subject from the qualitative stage to one based on measurements and mathematics.

The Hasidut is headquartered in Jerusalem, Israel, with communities in Beitar Ilit, Bnei Brak, Manchester, Australia, Beis Shemesh, London, Antwerp, Manhattan, Brooklyn, Monsey, New York Lakewood, New Jersey, and Atlanta, Georgia. Boyan is one of the branches of the Ruzhiner dynasty, together with Bohush, Chortkov, Husiatyn, Sadigura, Kapishnitz, Vadlui and Shtefanesht. History =First Boyaner Rebbe= Boyan. The founder of the dynasty was Rabbi Yitzchok Friedman (1850-1917), known as the Pachad Yitzchok. He was the eldest son of Rabbi Avrohom Yaakov Friedman (1820-1883), the first Sadigura Rebbe,Friedman, Yisroel. The Golden Dynasty: Ruzhin, the royal house of Chassidus. Jerusalem: The Kest-Lebovits Jewish Heritage and Roots Library, 2nd English edition, 2000, p. 76. and the grandson of Rabbi Yisroel Friedman of Ruzhyn (1797-1851), founder of the Ruzhiner dynasty.Friedman, The Golden Dynasty, p. 20. Upon the death of his father in 1883, Rabbi Yitzchok and his younger brother Rabbi Yisrael (1852-1907) assumed joint leadership of their father's Hasidim. Although they were content with this arrangement, many of the Sadigura Hasidim preferred to have one Rebbe, and in 1887, the brothers agreed to draw lots to determine who would stay in Sadigura and who would move out. The lots fell to Rabbi Yisrael to remain as the second Sadigura Rebbe, while Rabbi Yitzchok moved to the neighboring town of Boiany (Boyan) and established his court there, becoming the first Boyaner Rebbe. Under this arrangement, Rabbi Yitzchak assumed the mantle of Nasi of kollel Vohlyn in Eretz Israel, and with it the Zechut of lighting the fire in Meron on Lag Baomer – a tradition still upheld by his grandson the present Boyaner Rebbe - as well as the Tiferet Yisrael synagogue in the Old City of Jerusalem. Under the leadership of the Pachad Yitzchok, Boyaner Hasidut flourished. Boyaner communities were established throughout Eastern Europe – even one as far as Berlin – as well as in Tiberias, Safed, and Jerusalem.Friedman, The Golden Dynasty, p. 80. =Boyaner Rebbes after World War I= At the beginning of World War I, the town of Boyan was completely destroyed by invading armies. The Rebbe and his family escaped to Vienna, where the Rebbe died in 1917. After the war ended, three of his four sons each moved to a different country to establish their court. His eldest son, Rabbi Menachem Nachum (1869-1936), became the Boyaner Rebbe in Czernowitz, Bukovina.Friedman, The Golden Dynasty, p. 81. Rabbi Menachem Nachum's two sons, Rabbi Aharon and Rabbi Mordechai Shraga, succeeded him; they and their families were murdered by the Nazis during World War II.Friedman, The Golden Dynasty, p. 93. Rabbi Menachem Nachum's son-in-law, Rabbi Moshenu (1841-1943), became the Boyaner Rebbe in Kraków; he was murdered in Auschwitz.Friedman, The Golden Dynasty, p. 106. The Pachad Yitzchok's second son, Rabbi Yisroel (1878-1951), became the Boyaner Rebbe in Leipzig, Germany; in 1939 he moved to Tel Aviv. He had two daughters, whose husbands did not succeed him. The Pachad Yitzchok's third son, Rabbi Avrohom Yaakov (1884-1941), became the Boyaner Rebbe in Lemberg; he was murdered by the Nazis in 1941.Friedman, The Golden Dynasty, pp. 81-82. The Pachad Yitzchok's youngest son, Rabbi Mordechai Shlomo, remained in Vienna with his mother until the latter's death in 1922.Friedman, The Golden Dynasty, p. 111. At that point he considered an offer to head the Hasidic community of Drohobych in Western Ukraine, and another offer to lead an organized chaburah (group) of Boyaner Hasidim on the Lower East Side of New York City.Brayer, The House of Rizhin, p. 442. He embarked on an 11-month pilot trip to America in December 1925, and then spent another year weighing the pros and cons of moving to America before acceding to the request of the Boyaner Hasidim of New York to establish his court with them. He and his family arrived in New York in November 1927.Brayer, The House of Rizhin, p. 443. Over the next 40 years, the Boyaner Rebbe of New York succeeded in uniting the Ruzhin-Boyan survivors of the Holocaust and proved that Hasidut could be a viable lifestyle in America.Brayer, The House of Rizhin, p. 475. The Rebbe exuded the sense of nobility and spiritual loftiness characteristic of rebbes of the Boyaner dynasty, but he also expressed a warmth and paternal concern for his disciples which attracted many American youth who had never seen a Hasidic rebbe. Yeshiva students and secular Jewish boys alike were drawn to him in large numbers, and he made many ba'alei teshuvah (returnees to the faith).Brayer, The House of Rizhin, p. 443-444. The Rebbe also took an active role in American Jewish leadership, being a founder and president of the Agudath HaAdmorim (Union of Grand Rabbis) of the United States (in which capacity he participated in the Rabbi's March on Washington in 1943); first vice president of Agudath Israel of AmericaFriedman, The Golden Dynasty, p. 125. and a member of that body's Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah;Brayer, The House of Rizhin, p. 461. and president of Vaad HaEzra, in which capacity he raised funds to help Holocaust survivors in post-war Europe.Brayer, The House of Rizhin, p. 468. The Great Synagogue Tiferet Yisroel in Jerusalem. In 1948 the Ruzhiner synagogue in the Old City of Jerusalem, Tiferes Yisroel (also called the Nissan Beck Synagogue), which was completed by the Sadigura Rebbe, Rabbi Avrohom Yaakov Friedman, in 1872,Brayer, The House of Rizhin, p. 263. was destroyed by the Arab Legion during the 1948 Israel War of Independence. On his trip to Israel in 1953, the Boyaner Rebbe of New York laid the foundations for a new Ruzhiner Torah center, also to be called Tiferes Yisroel, in the New City of Jerusalem. In 1957 the Ruzhiner yeshiva, called Mesivta Tiferes Yisroel, was inaugurated with the support of all of the Rebbes of the Ruzhiner dynasty.Brayer, The House of Ruzhin, p. 459. A large synagogue was built adjacent to it, also bearing the name Tiferes Yisroel; the current Boyaner Rebbe, Rabbi Nachum Dov Brayer, leads his Hasidut from here. The design of the synagogue, located on the western end of Malkhei Yisrael Street close to the Central Bus Station, includes a large white dome, reminiscent of the domed Tiferes Yisrael Synagogue that was destroyed in the Old City. Following Rabbi Mordechai Shlomo's death on 2 March 1971, the Boyaner Hasidim were left leaderless. The Hasidim approached the Rebbe's eldest son, Yisrael, to take over as Rebbe, but he declined. The Hasidim then asked the Rebbe's daughter Malka and her husband, Rabbi Dr. Menachem Mendel Brayer, a teacher at Yeshiva University, to offer one of their two young sons to be groomed for the position. The elder, Yigal, an aerospace engineer, was suggested and then rejected. The lot fell to the younger son, Nachum Dov (born 1959), who then enrolled at the Ruzhiner yeshiva in Jerusalem to prepare himself for the task. On Hanukkah 1984, Rabbi Nachum Dov Brayer was crowned Boyaner Rebbe. The Hasidut is now based in Jerusalem, Israel, where the Rebbe resides. =Boyan today= The Boyaner Rebbe, Rabbi Nachum Dov Brayer, leads a tish in the giant sukkah erected at Yeshivat Tiferes Yisroel, 2009. Modern-day Boyaner Hasidut numbers more than 2,000 families, and is the largest of the dynasties that have their roots in the Ruzhiner dynasty. The majority of Boyaner Hasidim live in and around Jerusalem. There are also Boyaner communities in Beitar Illit, Bnei Brak, Antwerp, London, Manchester, Monsey, and the Brooklyn neighborhoods of Boro Park and Williamsburg. The kloiz that the Boyaner Rebbe of New York presided over at 247 East Broadway still draws a daily minyan, although the community is mainly centered around a small synagogue in an apartment house at West 82nd Street and West End Avenue on New York's Upper West Side where the Rebbe spent his last years. Whenever the present Boyaner Rebbe visits America, he receives visitors in the former Rebbe's prayer room in the Lower East Side kloiz, and it has become a practice for chatanim (grooms) in the Boyaner community to pray here before going to their chuppahs.Besser, Yisroel. \\"Miracle on the Lower East Side: From the Boyan of his childhood, Rav Mordechai Shlomo of Boyan created an oasis for America's early chassidim\\".

Famous cantors and composers who left their mark on the Boyaner Repertoire were:http://old.piyut.org.il/articles/910.html * Cantor Naftali Hazan, who worked in the court of Sadigura and Boyan in 1878-1897. * Pinchas Spector (Pinye Chazan), who came to Boyan in the early twentieth century. As was common for contemporary cantors who worked for a living in several places, he composed works of polyphony for many texts, Sabbath prayers, holidays, and Yamim Nora'im. In recent years, many of his compositions were restored from notes discovered in his estate, and revived and re-introduced in the Boyaner court. * One of his students, Moshe Lerman, known as Moshe Chazan, immigrated to Israel, was the Chazan of the Boyan synagogue in the old city of Jerusalem and taught many of his works. * Today, Pinchas Brochshtat leads the capella of Boyaner Chassidim at the present Rebbe's court in Jerusalem. Lag BaOmer tradition The Boyaner Rebbe traditionally lights the first bonfire at the annual Lag BaOmer celebration at the tomb of Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai in Meron, Israel. This privilege was purchased by Rabbi Avrohom Yaakov Friedman, the first Sadigura Rebbe, from the Sephardi guardians of Meron and Safed; the Sadigura Rebbe bequeathed this honor to his eldest son, Rabbi Yitzchok, the first Boyaner Rebbe, and his progeny. The first hadlakah (lighting) is attended by hundreds of thousands of people each year; in 2001, the crowd was estimated at 300,000.Brayer, The House of Rizhin, p. 435.

Hertwig epithelial root sheath initiates the formation of dentin in the root of a tooth by causing the differentiation of odontoblasts from the dental papilla. The root sheath eventually disintegrates with the periodontal ligament, but residual pieces that do not completely disappear are seen as epithelial cell rests of Malassez (ERM).Ten Cate's Oral Histology, Nanci, Elsevier, 2013, p. 166 These rests can become cystic, presenting future periodontal infections. Structure Hertwig epithelial root sheath is derived from the inner and outer enamel epithelium of the enamel organ.Illustrated Dental Embryology, Histology, and Anatomy, Bath- Balogh and Fehrenbach, Elsevier, 2011, p. 66 Function The sheath is also responsible for multiple or accessory roots (medial growth) and lateral or accessory canals in the root (break in epithelium).Ten Cate's Oral Histology, Nanci, Elsevier, 2013, p. 174 It is controversial, but HERS may be involved in cementogenesis and the secreting of cementum, or that HERS-derived products might be related to enamel-related molecules, and that these proteins might initiate acellular cementum formation. Other animals While in mammals the HERS is rather a transient structure, in amphibians it is more or less a permanent one. Here the root epithelium does not fenestrate like in mammalians. Within vertebrates 3 distinct stages of HERS development can be observed. # In teleosts and chondrichthyans no HERS or root is really formed, and tooth development is restricted to crown development. An inflexible joint is formed between the tooth and the bone at the apical end of the tooth where the epithelium remains open. # In amphibians and non-crocodilian reptiles a continuous root sheath or HERS is formed without fragmentation of the epithelium. Once again a rather rigid connection between bone and tooth is formed at the apical end of the tooth where no epithelium is present. # In crocodilians and mammals the HERS is a transient structure and fragments to form the epithelial cell rests of Malassez. Through the gaps in the root epithelium elements of the periodontal ligament can migrate and form a flexible connection between bone and root. History Hertwig epithelial root sheath was not discovered in any mammalian species. Instead this epithelial structure was discovered by Oskar Hertwig in 1874 in an amphibian (see notes below for further discussion in other animals).

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Atlanta Braves and Toronto Blue Jays. Career At first, he was drafted in the 5th round (103rd overall) of the 1975 amateur entry draft by the Cleveland Indians, but opted not to sign. He was then drafted in the first round (10th pick) of the 1976 amateur draft by the Atlanta Braves. Macha's batting average gradually rose during his minor league tenure, and it rose high enough to make the Braves call him up in 1979 when he was 25 years old. He made his major league debut on April 20, 1979. He did not fare well in his first major league stint, hitting only .154 (2 for 13), and committing 3 errors at third base in only 13 chances. He was sent back to the minors by mid-May. In late 1979, Macha was selected by the Toronto Blue Jays in the Rule 5 Draft. He started the next season on the Blue Jays' roster, but was rarely used, making only eight trips to the plate (and not reaching base in any of them). Defensively, he made two errors in his two games at third. Unusually, he was pressed into service as an emergency catcher on May 26. Manager Bobby Mattick had pinch hit for his only two catchers on the roster, so Macha was sent out the catch the bottom of the ninth and help preserve a 3-1 Blue Jays lead over the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park. In his only appearance at the position, Macha made no errors in his one-inning catching stint and the Jays held the Red Sox to one hit and no runs, winning the game. This was Macha's final major league game, as the Detroit Tigers purchased his contract only two days later. He finished out the year with Detroit's Triple-A farm club, the Evansville Triplets, and retired from baseball after the end of the season.

Early life  Henry Moore Harrington was born in Albion, New York, the son of Shelby A. Harrington and Nancy K. (Moore) Harrington. Early in his childhood, his family relocated to Coldwater, Michigan. He attended the Cleveland Institute at University Heights, Ohio, and declined an appointment to the U.S. Naval Academy before accepting an appointment to West Point in 1868.  7th Cavalry  Upon graduation from the U.S. Military Academy (ranking 17th the Class of 1872), he was commissioned a Second Lieutenant of Cavalry and assigned to Company C, 7th United States Cavalry with an initial posting to North Carolina. He married Grace Berard, the granddaughter of a West Point professor. The couple had two children. In 1873, Company C was reassigned to Dakota Territory and Lieutenant Henry Harrington accompanied Lieutenant Colonel (Brevet Major General) George Armstrong Custer and a large part of the 7th Cavalry on the Yellowstone Expedition of 1873, taking part in the Battle of Honsinger Bluff, Montana on August 4, 1873, and in a skirmish near Pompey's Pillar, Montana on August 11, 1873. In the summer of 1874, Harrington and his Company C were part of the 7th Cavalry's military escort for the Black Hills Expedition under the command of Lieutenant Colonel George Armstrong Custer. On May 17, 1876, during the Great Sioux War of 1876, Brigadier General Alfred Terry's Dakota column departed Fort Abraham Lincoln and embarked on the Little Big Horn campaign. Harrington's 7th Cavalry Regiment composed most of the Dakota column, but was in short supply of officers, so Harrington as a Second Lieutenant was given the command of Company C, and accompanied Major Marcus Reno's June 10-18, 1876 scout on the Powder River, and Tongue River in south-eastern Montana Territory. After Harrington and the over 300 soldiers on the Reno Scout rejoined Colonel Custer and the 7th Cavalry, the regiment marched up Rosebud Creek, then crossed to the Little Bighorn River. On June 25, 1876 the 647 men with the 7th Cavalry including Henry Harrington under the command of George A. Custer attacked a village of several thousand Native Americans, in what became known as the Battle of the Little Bighorn. Harrington and 219 men of the 7th Cavalry under Custer were separated from the rest of the regiment, and were Killed in action. Henry Moore Harrington's remains were not identified on the battlefield, and the Lieutenant was declared Missing in action and presumed dead. His wife Grace Berard made a series of trips to the Battlefield to look for his body or information regarding his whereabouts if he had survived the savage fight, but to no avail.

In his youth Wright was a Gaelic footballer with Dublin and was an international basketball player and coach. He first held public office in 1982, when he was nominated by the Taoiseach to Seanad Éireann. He remained there until 1983; however, he also entered local politics in 1985 as a member of Dublin County Council. He remained there until 2004 and is among those named by lobbyist Frank Dunlop at the investigating Mahon Tribunal as receiving donations from property developers. Wright was first elected to Dáil Éireann at the 1987 general election. He lost his seat at the 1989 general election but was again nominated to the Seanad where he served as Leader of Seanad Éireann (1991–1994) and Leader of Fianna Fáil in Seanad Éireann (1994–1997). During this time Wright failed again to obtain re-election to the Dáil. He finally succeeded at the 1997 general election and held his seat in another election in 2002. In September 2003, as Wright drove home from Leinster House, his car collided with a female pedestrian at North Strand in Dublin causing multiple fractures to her leg. Tests confirmed that Wright's blood alcohol content was above the legal limit. As a result, he was fined and banned from driving for two years. He retired from politics at the 2007 general election.

The kits come with little compartmentalised boxes where the numbered colour pigments are stored. The users are encouraged to wash the paintbrush every time a new numbered colour is being used. The kits were invented, developed and marketed in 1950 by Max S. Klein, an engineer and owner of the Palmer Paint Company of Detroit, Michigan, and Dan Robbins, a commercial artist. When Palmer Paint introduced crayons to consumers, they also posted images online for a \\"Crayon by Number\\" version.  History  The first patent for the paint by number technique was filed in 1923. Paint by number in its popular form was created by the Palmer Show Card Paint Company. The owner of the company approached employee Dan Robbins with the idea for the project. After several iterations of the product, the company in 1951 introduced the Craft Master brand, which went on to sell over 12 million kits. This public response induced other companies to produce their own versions of paint by number. The Craft Master paint kit box tops proclaimed, \\"A BEAUTIFUL OIL PAINTING THE FIRST TIME YOU TRY.\\"In the 1960s, the first images of Mars were completed like a paint by number. Following the death of Max Klein in 1993, his daughter, Jacquelyn Schiffman, donated the Palmer Paint Co. archives to the Smithsonian Museum of American History. The archival materials have been placed in the museum's Archives Center where they have been designated collection #544, the \\"Paint by Number Collection\\". In 1992, Michael O'Donoghue and Trey Speegle organized and mounted a show of O'Donoghue's paint by number collection in New York City at the Bridgewater/Lustberg Gallery. After O'Donoghue's death in 1994, the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History exhibited many key pieces from O'Donoghue's collection, now owned by Speegle, along with works from other collectors in 2001. In 2008, a private collector in Massachusetts assembled over 6,000 paint by number works dating back to the 1950s from eBay and other American collectors to create the Paint By Number Museum, the world's largest online archive of paint by number works. In 2011, the Museum of Modern Art in New York accepted four early designs of paint by number by Max Klein for its Department of Architecture and Design, donated by Jacquelyn Schiffman. In May 2011, Dan Robbins and Palmer Paint Products, Inc., together developed and brought to market a new 60th-anniversary paint by number set.\\"Gone But Not Forgotten 2001\\" , a registered trademark of Dan Robbins. This collectors' set was created in memory of the survivors and those who had lost their lives on September 11, 2001, and depicts the Twin Towers standing in spirit across the Manhattan skyline. On April 1, 2019, Dan Robbins died in Sylvania, Ohio at the age of 93. See also * Mosaic * Stained glass * List of art techniques References Further reading * William L.

A multifaceted personality, he attempted every literary genre, literary criticism, poetry, drama, novels, short stories, essays, as well as journalism. Early life Nkosi was born in a traditional Zulu family in a place called Embo in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. He attended local schools, before enrolling at M. L. Sultan Technical College in Durban.\\"Lewis Nkosi\\", South African History Online. Later life Nkosi in his early twenties began working as a journalist, first in Durban, joining the weekly publication Ilanga lase Natal (\\"Natal sun\\") in 1955, and then in Johannesburg for Drum magazine and as chief reporter for its Sunday newspaper, the Golden City Post, from 1956 to 1960.\\"Lewis Nkosi\\", Encyclopædia Britannica. =Literary career in South Africa= He contributed essays to many magazines and newspapers. His essays criticised apartheid and the racist state, as a result of which the South African government banned his works. =Life as an exile= Nkosi faced severe restrictions on his writing due to the publishing regulations found in the Suppression of Communism Act and the Publications and Entertainment Act passed in the 1950s and 1960s. His works were banned under the Suppression of Communism Act,Peter Horn, \\"A radical rethinking of the art of poetry in an apartheid society\\", in Writing My Reading: Essays on Literary Politics in South Africa, Rodopi, 1994, p. 49, note 2. and he faced severe restrictions as a writer. At the same time he became the first black South African journalist to win a Nieman Fellowship from Harvard University to pursue his studies.\\"Lewis Nkosi, the first black South African fellow, dies at 73\\", Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard, 9 September 2010. When he applied for permission to go to United States, he was granted a one-way exit permit to leave South Africa, thus barred from returning. In 1961, accepting the scholarship to study at Harvard, he began a 30-year exile. In 1962 he attended the African Writers Conference at Makerere University, along with the likes of Chinua Achebe, Wole Soyinka, Ngugi wa Thiong'o and Ezekiel Mphahlele.Denis Herbstein, \\"Lewis Nkosi obituary\\", The Guardian, 22 September 2010. He was an editor for The New African in London and the NET in the United States. He became a Professor of Literature and held positions at the University of Wyoming and the University of California-Irvine, as well as at universities in Zambia and in Warsaw, Poland. He appeared in Three Swings on a Pendulum, a programme about \\"Swinging London\\" in 1967 which can be viewed on BBC iplayer.\\"Three Swings on a Pendulum\\", BBC iPlayer. =Return to South Africa= Lewis Nkosi returned to South Africa in 2001, after a gap of nearly four decades. His final years before his death in 2010 were passed in financial difficulties and ill health. He was apparently injured in a car crash in 2009 and spent his time on the bed, slowly recovering from the wounds; however, that never really happened and he drifted towards death. One of the African literary legend's efforts in literature did not give him any economic relief and his friends and fans gathered a charity fund to pay his last medical bills.Makatile,\\"Widow bereft as Nkosi's esteemed works add up to nothing\\", Sowetan, 8 September 2010. He died on Sunday, 5 September 2010, at the Johannesburg Wellness Clinic.Ntongela Masilela, \\"Lewis Nkosi (1936-2010): An Appreciation\\", Claremont (Los Angeles), California, 7 and 8 September 2010. Works =Novels= Though Nkosi started his literary career in the 1960s, he entered the realm of fiction much later than his Drum colleagues. His first novel, Mating Birds, was published in 1983. His next novel, Underground People, came out in 2002 and his third novel, Mandela's Ego, in 2006. Mating Birds (1986) Mating Birds is the narration of an educated South African black native called Ndi Sibiya. He narrates the story from prison, awaiting a death sentence. As a jobless youth Sibiya wanders the city of Durban and reaches the segregated beach. There he finds a white girl on the other side of the fence (on the white side of the beach). They silently exchange looks and enter into a muted affair. They were well aware that race laws in South Africa would sentence them to imprisonment if caught. The white girl intentionally allows her naked body to be seen by Sibiya. He takes the entire episode as a love affair between the white girl and himself. The girl with her regular appearances on the beach and seeming interest dupes Sibiya into believing her. After several silent meetings on the beach, Sibiya follows her to her bungalow, finds her lonely and willing, and enters into sexual copulation. But they are discovered by neighbours, and the white girl accuses Sibiya of rape. A trial by white judges begins. In the court, the white girl, Veronica, denies any knowledge of Sibiya and reiterates the charge of rape against him. The court finds Sibiya guilty and sentences him to death. The novel generated a controversy and received critical attention, being awarded the Macmillan Silver Pen Prize in 1986. The New York Times declared the novel one of the best hundred books of 1986. Underground People (2002) Nkosi's second novel, Underground People, is a political thriller. In this novel, he moved away from the theme of inter-racial sexual relations and centred the story on the armed struggle in South Africa. Cornelius Molapo is a language teacher and a member of the National Liberation Movement, an organisation waging armed war against the racist white minority government. He is a poet, a great orator, hungry reader of many books, and even plays cricket. He often criticises the policy of the Central Committee and irks its members. To counter him, they draw a strategy. The Central Committee of the Organization advises Cornelius to go to a remote part of the country called Tabanyane and to participate in peasant uprisings. The Central Committee plans to make use of his absence from mainstream life into an act of abduction by the Government. At first he hesitates, but reluctantly agrees. After reaching Tabanyane, Cornelius organises the poor illiterate jobless country men into revolutionary men and leads them. In this task, he enlists the support of Princess Madi, who is a daughter of the deposed chief of Tabanyane. During the clandestine operations, he takes two white hostages into his custody. However, he is unwilling to execute the unarmed civilians. Meanwhile, the Central Committee starts a big propaganda about the disappearance of Cornelius from duties. They blame it on the South African police, who deny any knowledge of him. The National Liberation Movement brings the matter to international organisations like the United Nations and Human Rights International. The latter sends its official Anthony Ferguson, who was born in South Africa and immigrated to England, to investigate the matter. Anthony's sister and mother are still living in South Africa. After some rest he undertakes to search for Cornelius unsuccessfully. The Central Committee members, plagued by jealousy of his success as a revolutionary, want to use the issue of white hostages for the release of their leader from prison, engage in talks with the Government and to observe a ceasefire. But contrary to the expectations of the Central Committee, Cornelius defies them and conducts attacks on the police stations and other locations. To escape police persecution, Cornelius leaves his hideout, and allows the white hostages to leave unharmed. The white hostages reach police and recognise Cornelius's photo and confirm his active presence in the fight. Naturally, police suspect the intentions of Anthony Ferguson and ask him to go to Tabanyane, to convince Cornelius to surrender. He takes the help of a member of the Central Committee and reaches Tabanyane. However, Cornelius refuses to surrender and ditch the people for whom he had been fighting. Eventually, the police shoot, and he dies. Mandela's Ego (2006) Nkosi's third novel, Mandela's Ego (2006), has a strange story to tell. Dumisani Gumede is a teenage boy who has come of age in a Zulu village and runs after every girl and woman to satiate his newly acquired power. His uncle Simon tells him many stories about Nelson Mandela and makes him a follower of the great leader. In the story telling, Uncle Simon invents stories with lies and half-truths. He also tells Dumisani that Mandela is a great pursuer of women. Taking cue from the \\"real life\\" of Mandela, Dumisani goes unstopped in his conquests. In his village, every girl falls for his charms except Nobuhle, a beautiful orphaned girl. His admiration for Mandela goes to the extent of starting a football club, with Dumisani as its chairman. He even goes to the city of Pietermartizburg to see Mandela, who comes there to address a convention demanding equal rights for all races and a dialogue among all the races. After his schooling, Dumisani joins a tourist company as a guide. Dumisani's friend Sofa Sonke, driver of the tourist bus, brings every day a newspaper from Durban for him. After many attempts to win Nobuhle, Dumisani finally succeeds and gets accepted by her. She invites him to meet her on the river bank. On the same day, Dumisani receives the news of Mandela's arrest. The news shocks him and takes his nerve away. When Dumisani tries to unite with Nobuhle, his body fails. He tries again but fails. His sexual energy deserts him. Nobuhle leaves in tears. Dumisani consults many, witch doctors, tribal doctors and conventional doctors in hospitals. But nothing works to cure him. He leaves his home, wanders the country aimlessly for years. When he reaches middle age, one day he hears the news of Mandela's release from prison. He attends the first public address of Mandela after the release. He rejoices. In his joy, he huddles a woman next to him, and his lost sexual urge returns. His life is restored. =Drama= Nkosi's plays include The Black Psychiatrist and some drama for radio.Liz Gunner, \\"Contaminations: BBC Radio and the Black Artist — Lewis Nkosi's \\"The Trial\\" and \\"We Can't All be Martin Luther King\\", in Lindy Stiebel and Liz Gunner (eds), Still Beating the Drum: Critical Perspectives on Lewis Nkosi, Rodopi, 2005, pp. 51–66. =Poetry= Nkosi's few poems include \\"To Herbert Dhlomo\\" in Ilanga lase Natal (22 October 1955). Ntongela Masilela notes that, despite Nkosi's early promise, \\"in his whole life he wrote seven poems, the last one written in Lusaka in the early 1980s where he was then living and published at that time in Sechaba, the political and cultural review of the African National Congress.\\" =Short stories= Nkosi wrote a good number of short stories. His story of police violence and popular resistance in a black township, \\"Under the Shadow of the Guns\\", appeared in the 1990 anthology Colours of a New Day, the book taking its title from an optimistic phrase used by one of the characters in Nkosi's story.Sarah Lefanu and Stephen Hayward, Colours of a New Day (London: Lawrence and Wishart, 1990, pp. xiii, 287. =Literary criticism and journalism= He wrote critical essays on many issues, including politics, history, African affairs, American culture, and civilisation. No other critic touches upon such diversified themes. His critical works include Home and Exile (1965), The Transplanted Heart (1975), and The Tasks and Masks (1981). His essays and other works were published over four decades in America, England and Africa. Publications in which his writing appeared include Drum, Ilanga lase Natal, Golden City Post, Transition, The Guardian, The Africa Report, Afro-Asian Writings, Sechaba, New Society, The Spectator, New Statesman, The Observer, Negro Digest, Black Orpheus, Fighting Talk, Contact, The African Guardian, Southern African Review of Books, London Review of Books, Genèva-Afrique, The New African, and Harvard Crimson.  Themes  As opposed to apartheid, Nkosi's work explores themes of politics, relationships, and sexuality. His works, possessing great depth, received less recognition than they had actually deserved. In the post-apartheid era, his works are gaining critical attention across the third world. Nkosi joined forces with African powerhouse authors Chinua Achebe and Wole Soyinka in an interview in the third chapter of Bernth Lindfors' Conversations With Chinua Achebe. In 1978, Nkosi and composer Stanley Glasser wrote a collection of six Zulu-style songs called Lalela Zulu for The King's Singers, a group of six white British, male a cappella singers. Quotations On the situation in South Africa during apartheid : \\"Africans have learned that if they are remaining sane at all it is pointless to try to live within the law. In a country where the Government has legislated against sex, drinks, employment, free movement and many other things, which are taken for granted in the Western world, it would take a monumental kind of patience to keep up with the demands of the law. A man's sanity may even be in question by the time he reaches the ripe age of twenty-five.\\" (Nkosi: Home and Exile, 22) On black writers and their literature : \\"Black South Africans did not produce on elite which was alienated form the black masses or even from the conditions of everyday life under which our people laboured. In South Africa we were saved from the emergence of Black Bourgeoisie by the leveling effect of apartheid.\\" (Nkosi: Home and Exile, 32) On his exile : \\"A writer needs his roots; he needs his people perhaps more than they need him in order that they should corroborate the vision he has of them, or at least, to dispute the statements he may make about their lives.\\" (Nkosi: Home and Exile, 93) On the writers and commitment : \\"…whether we consider ourselves revolutionaries or not, are playing a marginal role. We may be good for propaganda; we may raise some money and build up contacts for the people of South Africa-but there is no such thing as a revolution fought in exile, without a base among the oppressed masses of the country for which the change is desired.\\" (Nkosi: On South Africa, 286–292) : \\"Ambushed by history, deprived of the moral and material support of the socialist camp by the fall of the Soviet Union and its satellite states, a negotiated peace, between a lame government and weary liberation movements was probably the next best thing.… The negotiated peace enacted what Doris Somer, writing about the South Africa, described as a premature end of a history.\\" (The Republic of Letters: Mandela’s Republic) Critical appraisal and research The first comprehensive and critical review on Nkosi appeared in 2006, edited by Professor Lindy Steibel and Professor Liz Gunner, entitled Still Beating the Drum: Critical Perspectives on Lewis Nkosi, published by Wits University Press.Lindy Steibel and Liz Gunner (eds), \\"Still Beating the Drum: Critical Perspectives on Lewis Nkosi\\" (Cross/Cultures 81), KwaZuluNatal University Press, 2006. . Nkosi's works are gaining recognition and being prescribed as university and college textbooks. Some of his works of criticism and essays have been accepted as standard reference texts in the area of African literary criticism and literature. Research on Nkosi's work has also gained momentum across the Third World countries. He is a featured writer in the KZN Literary Tourism project.

Background Yagan was an indigenous Australian warrior of the Noongar nation who played a key part in early indigenous resistance to European settlement and rule around the area of Perth, Western Australia. He was shot dead by a young settler, James Keates in 1833. Yagan's head was removed, preserved by smoking, and taken to England by Robert Dale, who gave it to the Liverpool Institute for display in a museum. By 1964, Yagan's head was badly decomposed, and the decision was made to dispose of it. The head was placed in a plywood box, along with a Peruvian mummy and a Māori head, and buried in Everton Cemetery's General Section 16, grave number 296. In later years, a number of burials were made around the grave, and in 1968 a local hospital buried 20 stillborn babies and two babies who had lived less than twenty-four hours, directly over the museum box. A horizontal colour contour map of ground conductivity of Yagan's grave site. For many years, members of Perth's Noongar community sought to have Yagan's head returned and buried according to tribal custom. An application for exhumation of the head was made in 1994, but it was refused because next of kin permission to disturb the remains of the twenty- two babies could not be obtained. The geophysical survey The excavation pit used for the exhumation of Yagan's head. A vertical colour contour map of ground conductivity of Yagan's grave site. In 1997, two brothers, Dr Martin Bates of the University of Wales, Lampeter and Dr Richard Bates of the University of St Andrews, were commissioned by the Home Office to conduct a geophysical survey of the grave site, with a view to exhuming the remains via an adjacent plot without disturbing any other remains. The pair conducted surface surveys using ground penetrating radar and ground conductivity techniques. The ground penetrating radar yielded no information about the location of Yagan's head, as the highly disturbed graveyard soil contained many reflecting sources. However, the ground conductivity measurements showed an anomaly in the electromagnetic signature that it was thought might be caused by metal artifacts buried with the head. The apparent location of the remains confirmed the feasibility of accessing them via an adjacent plot.Bates, C. R. (2005) pers. comm. A pit was then dug in an adjacent plot, to a depth of around six feet, and a vertical ground conductivity test was conducted from within the pit. This test failed to detect the anomaly recorded in the surface test, however the conductivity plot did show an anomaly at the centre of the grave, indicating that the grave was dug to its full depth of nine feet only at its centre. This suggested the burial of a small box, confirming the memory of the grave digger who claimed to have constructed a small box to house the buried remains. The exhumation After gathering evidence on the position and depth of Yagan's head, Bates reported the survey results to the Home Office, which eventually granted permission to proceed with the exhumation. Yagan's head was exhumed by tunnelling horizontally into the grave from the adjacent pit. The tunneling operation was \\"delicate and risky\\", as the tunnel passed underneath the remains of the babies, such that any collapse could potentially disturb them. According to Richard Bates, \\"the first shovel of dirt from the grave showed signs of the decayed box and the Peruvian mummy came next followed by the Māori head and finally Yagan's head\\". The following day, a forensic palaeontologist from the University of Bradford positively identified the skull as Yagan's, by correlating the fractures with those described in an 1834 report by Thomas Pettigrew. Aftermath Later that year, Yagan's head was handed over to a delegation of Noongars, who took it back to Australia. Reburial of the head was delayed, however, due to uncertainty of the whereabouts of the rest of his body and disagreement by elders about the importance of burying the head with the body. They finally buried it in July 2010, in a traditional Noongar ceremony in the Swan Valley in Western Australia, 177 years after Yagan's death.Warrior reburied 170 years after death , Australian Geographic, 12 July 2010 References Further reading The following source was not consulted in the writing of this article: * Bates, M and Bates, C.

There are approximately 4,100 stores with the Edeka nameplate that range from small corner stores to hypermarkets. On November 16, 2007, Edeka reached an agreement with Tengelmann to purchase a 70% majority stake in Tengelmann's Plus discounter store division, which was then merged into Edeka's Netto brand, with some 4,200 stores by 2018.\\"Tengelmann entscheidet sich für EDEKA\\" (German) Under all brands the company operated a total of 13,646 stores at the end of 2017.

(Einkaufsgenossenschaft der Kolonialwarenhändler im Halleschen Torbezirk zu Berlin, \\"Purchasing Cooperative of Colonial Goods Retailers in the Hallesches Tor district of Berlin\\"). In 1911, it was renamed as Edeka - a phonetic expansion of the previous abbreviation. The Edekabank was founded in 1914 and, from 1923, central billing was introduced. After the Second World War, the reconstruction of the store network was led from the new Hamburg central offices. In 1972, the cooperatives changed structure and formed twelve regional companies, the umbrella corporation and the Edekabank converting from a cooperative to a public limited company. In 2001, the Edeka own brand \\"Gut & Günstig\\" was founded. Christmas 2015 the company attracted worldwide attention with the highly sentimental TV commercial #heimkommen, about a lonely grandfather desperate to reunite with his family for Christmas.

Brand names  Operational names of these stores include: * Edeka nah und gut (\\"close and good\\") - stores up to 400 m2 (4300 sq ft), mostly found in smaller municipalities * Edeka aktiv markt (\\"active mart\\") - mostly privately run supermarkets between 400 m2 and 800 m2 (4300 and 8600 sq ft), mostly located in outlying neighborhoods and villages * Edeka neukauf - privately or centrally managed stores between 800 m2 and 2000 m2 (8600 and 21,500 sq ft) * Edeka center (E-Center) - hypermarkets between 2000 m2 and 5000 m2 (21,500 and 54,000 sq ft) * Edeka C&C; Großmarkt (Mios) (cash & carry) * Edeka Großverbraucherservice (for commercial customers) * Edeka NP- Markt Stores not operating under the Edeka brand, but belonging to the group nonetheless: * SPAR (only in Germany) * aktiv discount - often rebranded E-Center stores, mainly in northern Germany * Netto Marken-Discount - discount stores * Marktkauf - hypermarkets, mainly in the west of Germany It also has holdings in Denmark. Edeka also operates a number of companies providing related services, for example the Edekabank.  Controversies  A 2019 Mother's Day online commercial showing a series of clips of fathers interacting with their children incompetently, followed by shots of caring mothers with their children, and the punchline \\"Mum, thank you for not being dad,\\" was criticized widely for its clichéd portrayal of the roles of mothers and fathers. Stevie Schmiedel, a gender researcher and founder of the German branch of the feminist lobby organization \\"Pinkstinks,\\" which campaigns against sexism in advertising, commented: \\"Maybe the advertisers really thought they were doing something good for women on Mother's Day. But everything went wrong. The commercial is pseudo-progressive. It divides and intensifies the fight between the sexes. A poisoned Mother's Day present.\\" Edeka was officially reprimanded by the Deutscher Werberat, the German advertising standards regulator, for breaching advertising standards by \\"reinforcing 1950's gender stereotypes,\\" and while \\"ironic exaggeration is permissible, gender stereotyping is not.\\" The authority also cited the large number of complaints and the debate about the commercial on social media, saying this showed that viewers either did not understand that it was meant to be ironical, or that they felt the ironic use of stereotypes was not acceptable to them.

The school was located in a remodelled Tudor home near Bradford-on-Avon, Wiltshire and prepared boys for the Common Entrance Exam to enter a British Public School. It was founded by Mr Sydney Allen, originally as Kingwell Hall at Timsbury. In the 1930s it moved to Bradford-on-Avon. At the death of Mr Allen, at the beginning of the war, it was amalgamated with Kilvington Hall, a prep school situated in Enfield Chase and which had to be evacuated because of enemy action. This school had two head-masters, Messrs K.V. Beech and W. Bennett. Mr Beech ran Kingwell during WWII while Mr. Bennett served as an officer in the British Army. The school crest was an elephant; the motto: \\"Be strong, gently\\". School was divided into 4 sets: Lions, Tigers, Leopards and Bears. There were two mistresses and about six resident masters, plus the two head masters and a retired nurse acting as the Matron and her assistant. The piano teacher, Mr Hathaway, lived in town and came to school on two afternoons a week to offer private lessons for an extra fee, after regular classes were dismissed. He also conducted singing lessons for the whole school. Evening prep was for one hour, devoting 20 minutes to each of three regularly scheduled subjects. Classes were held Monday through Saturday morning and all afternoons except on Wednesdays and Saturdays. Kingwell Court School merged with The Old Ride School, which moved from its original home at Little Horwood, Buckinghamshire, in 1959. Boys from The Old Ride joined the Kingwell Court boys in a combined school, renamed \\"The Old Ride\\" in the winter term of 1959. For a while the two sets of boys were easily distinguished by the fact that they retained their school uniforms - red for The Old Ride and purple for Kingwell Court. Eventually the purple phased out. When the two schools merged, the previous Kingwell Court division into four sets of boys (Lions, Tigers, Leopards and Bears) became the four Nations of Britons, Spartans, Trojans and Vikings, a continuation of the arrangement at the \\"old\\" Old Ride school. The Nations competed for the coveted weekly \\"Owl\\" trophy. The school closed down in 1990.

He played for the New York Mets, Kansas City Royals, Cincinnati Reds, Houston Astros, San Francisco Giants, Tampa Bay Rays, and Chicago White Sox. Known as a contact hitter, Keppinger consistently had one of the lowest strikeout rates in the major leagues. He led the league in at-bats-to-strikeouts ratio in 2008 (19.1) and 2010 (14.3), and posted a career mark of 13.47 (214 strikeouts in 2,882 at-bats). Early years In 1994 Keppinger played on the Dunwoody Braves summer baseball team, and was named to the AAU All-American team. He also played for the New England Collegiate Baseball League's Keene Swamp Bats. He compiled a .380 batting average at the University of Georgia where, in the College World Series, he hit a two-run home run off star pitcher Mark Prior. In 2000 and 2001, he played collegiate summer baseball for the Orleans Cardinals of the Cape Cod Baseball League. He was selected by the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 4th round of the 2001 Major League Baseball draft. Professional career =New York Mets= At the 2004 trading deadline, while Keppinger was in double-A ball, he was traded to the Mets as part of the Kris Benson for Ty Wigginton trade. His average soared even higher with the double-A Binghamton Mets and stayed above .300 with the triple-A Norfolk Tides earning him a call to the majors on August 20. He responded by hitting .284 with three home runs and nine RBI in 33 games played. In 2005, Keppinger again excelled in Norfolk while hitting .337. He was poised to return to the majors in June when Kazuo Matsui was injured, but bad luck struck when Keppinger fractured his kneecap around the same time as Matsui. The injury not only prevented his return to the majors but ended his entire 2005 season. =Kansas City Royals= On July 19, 2006, Keppinger was acquired by the Kansas City Royals for middle infielder Ruben Gotay and Keppinger was sent to Triple-A Omaha. Keppinger was called up by the Royals in August 2006. With a season-ending injury to starting third baseman Mark Teahen, Keppinger was expected to see some major league action. A key moment in his career occurred on September 9, 2006 at Boston's Fenway Park, when, after entering the game against the Red Sox as a pinch runner, he came to bat in the top of 12th inning in a 4-4 tie game with two runners on. Keppinger, batting against Manny Delcarmen, hit a ball just to the left of the right field foul pole for a three-run home run, breaking the 4-4 tie. The Royals went on to beat the Red Sox in that game 10-4. =Cincinnati Reds= Cincinnati Reds in 2008 spring training On January 2, 2007, Keppinger was designated for assignment by the Royals. Eight days later, Keppinger was traded to the Cincinnati Reds. In return, the Royals received Minor League pitcher Russ Haltiwanger. On May 13, 2008, Keppinger fractured his patella in the second inning of a game against the Florida Marlins, placing him on the 15-day disabled list. On June 22, 2008, he returned, much to the joy of the Reds who had just recently lost another shortstop to injury in Jolbert Cabrera. In 2008, he had the lowest strikeout percentage in the majors, at 4.8%, striking out once only every 19.1 at-bats.https://www.baseball- reference.com/leagues/MLB/2008-ratio-batting.shtmlhttps://www.baseball- reference.com/leagues/MLB/2008-ratio-batting.shtml =Houston Astros= On March 31, 2009, Keppinger was traded to the Houston Astros for minor league infielder Drew Sutton. Keppinger saw a majority of his playing time at third base, filling in for Geoff Blum while he was injured. Still versatile, Keppinger also played shortstop, second base, and first base during the '08 and '09 seasons. Keppinger began the 2010 season with the Astros as the primary backup at second base to starter Kazuo Matsui. However, after Matsui's offense proved inept after 71 at-bats, Keppinger was named the starter after Matsui was released by the Astros on May 19, 2010. =San Francisco Giants= On July 19, 2011, Keppinger was traded to the San Francisco Giants for pitchers Henry Sosa and Jason Stoffel. He hit a walk-off single against his former team, the Houston Astros, on August 27 and 28, 2011. =Tampa Bay Rays= On January 26, 2012, Keppinger was signed to a 1-year deal with the Tampa Bay Rays. The deal became official the next day. Keppinger had a good season as a utility infielder, playing first, second and third base throughout the season. Over 115 games, Keppinger batted .325 in 385 at-bats. He also hit 9 home runs and 40 RBI with an OPS of .806. On May 19, Keppinger broke his big right toe while sitting in the dugout. A foul ball from Martin Prado struck Keppinger on the foot and he subsequently missed over a month. Keppinger became a free-agent at the end of the season. =Chicago White Sox= Keppinger with the Chicago White Sox On December 10, 2012, Keppinger signed a 3-year, $12 million deal with the Chicago White Sox. He was designated for assignment on May 14, 2014. On May 21, the White Sox officially released Keppinger. Personal life Keppinger's older brother Billy, a left-handed pitcher, played independent baseball and minor league baseball in the Kansas City Royals system. Keppinger resides in Dacula, Georgia.https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100009102058557 He married his second wife Dihanna on October 7, 2017 at The Ritz Carlton in Lake Oconee, Georgia.https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=178911852669213&set;=picfp.100016511977557&type;=3&theater; References External links *Minor League Splits and Situational Stats * Category:1980 births Category:Living people Category:Major League Baseball second basemen Category:New York Mets players Category:Kansas City Royals players Category:Cincinnati Reds players Category:Houston Astros players Category:San Francisco Giants players Category:Tampa Bay Rays players Category:Chicago White Sox players Category:Georgia Bulldogs baseball players Category:Orleans Firebirds players Category:Hickory Crawdads players Category:Lynchburg Hillcats players Category:Altoona Curve players Category:Binghamton Mets players Category:Norfolk Tides players Category:Omaha Royals players Category:Sarasota Reds players Category:Louisville Bats players Category:Corpus Christi Hooks players Category:Oklahoma City RedHawks players Category:Durham Bulls players Category:Birmingham Barons players Category:Baseball players from Florida Category:Sportspeople from Miami ","title":"Jeff Keppinger"},{"id":"3413856","text":"Wise After the Event is the second studio album by English musician and composer Anthony Phillips, released in May 1978 on Arista Records in the United Kingdom and in June 1978 on Passport Records in the United States. After promoting his previous album The Geese & the Ghost (1977), Phillips began to prepare material for a new album. It remains his only album that features himself on lead vocals on each track. Production In March 1977, Phillips released his debut solo album, The Geese & the Ghost. Around the time it was put out, Phillips did consider furthering his education and return to music college but the album \\"did enough\\" for him to continue with making albums. Phillips recalled that the rise in punk rock in England at the time of The Geese & the Ghost increased the pressure for him to write more commercial songs and deliver hit singles. He had started an instrumental album based on Tarka the Otter, but the project was put on hold due to his difficulty in securing a recording deal. Within such a climate, Phillips found himself \\"forced\\" to make a new studio album of \\"mainstream pop songs\\" which he never felt completely comfortable doing, and lacked enough confidence in the material he had written by himself. He began with putting ideas down at his home studio using a TEAC 4-track tape machine and a 2-track Revox recorder. After preparing a collection of ideas Phillips presented them to producer Rupert Hine and session musicians Michael Giles on drums and John G. Perry on bass, the three rehearsed them for one week at Giles's home studio in Dorset, and recorded the developed tracks onto 4-track tape. After Phillips secured a deal with Arista Records, the original plan was for Wise After the Event to be released as an album with an accompanying EP of extra material. Artist Peter Cross began to design the cover art when the decision was made, but when the decision was made to scrap the EP Cross had moved onto other projects and there was insufficient time to correct his design, resulting in discrepancies with the running order of the tracks. This was corrected on the 1990 CD reissue. The unreleased music was released in 1980 on Phillips's next album Private Parts & Pieces II: Back to the Pavilion, the second in his series of \\"generic\\" albums that showcase ideas, demos, and outtakes of recordings. These included three short sections of tracks that were planned and sequenced for the earlier album: \\"Chinaman\\" is based on the introduction to \\"Paperchase\\"; \\"Romany's Aria\\" is a piece from \\"We're All as We Lie\\" played backwards; \\"Von Runkel's Yorker Music\\" was previously titled \\"Sitars and Nebulous\\". Back to the Pavilion includes two additional songs, \\"Tremulous\\" and \\"Magic Garden\\", that date from the Wise After the Event sessions. Recording Wise After the Event was recorded from October to December 1977. The first sessions took place across two weeks in October at Essex Studios in London, using a 16-track machine with added Dolby noise reduction. These were followed by sessions in November and December on the Manor Mobile studio and The Farmyard, a facility in Buckinghamshire. Here, the final takes of the backing tracks were recorded and transferred onto 24-track for the recording of the overdubs. The final sessions took place in December 1977 at CBS Studios in London. After recording finished, the album was mixed in December 1977 and January 1978 at Trident Studios in London. Minor overdubs were recorded at the studio, including the guitar solo on \\"Birdsong\\". The orchestra session for \\"Regrets\\" took place on 6 December 1977, and recorded onto 24-track. \\"Wise After the Event\\" features Phillips playing a 12-string Rickenbacker guitar that he purchased at Manny's Music in New York City. For the guitar effects he used a BOSS Chorus Esemble pedal and a Dyna Comp compressor for chord-based arrangements. He said it took some effort for Giles to \\"let himself go\\" on the drums as he was used to playing in a tight and precise style, and Phillips wanted more of his fast drum fills. Phillips is credited for playing the drums on Wise After the Event, and caused problems during the recording as he found himself gradually speeding up as he played. Giles advised him to practise at home for a weekend and play to a metronome to improve his timing. Release and reception Wise After the Event was released in May 1978 on Arista Records in the United Kingdom and in June 1978 on Passport Records in the United States. \\"We're All as We Lie\\" was released as a single with \\"Squirrel\\" and \\"Sitars and Nebulous\\" coupled on the B-side. \\"Squirrel\\" was later reunited with the album as a bonus track on the 1990 reissue. The British magazine Hi-Fi News & Record Review wrote: \\"Soft strums, songs and keyboard waves typify\\" the album which has \\"a mild Mike Oldfield touch to it\\" which \\"augurs well for its chances\\". One reviewer for Beat magazine in 1979 put the record on as it was \\"the perfect soother of frazzled nerves\\". Rob Patterson for The Bismarck Tribune gave a short positive review, noting the album is \\"a soft, subtle, but very tasteful slice of that-now-famous [Genesis] sound\\", and concludes with: \\"A heartening return\\". Chris Carson for the Press & Sun-Bulletin thought the album was not as successful as The Geese & the Ghost where Phillips \\"had the right idea\\" to play the instruments himself and leave the vocals to others. Carson compared the album's sound to early Genesis when Phillips was a member, but disliked his singing which failed to reach the quality of the album's production guitar work. \\"The result is a very tedious album, and a real struggle for even the devout Genesis fan to get through\\". Jane Seigendall for The Morning Call opened her review that the album is \\"an extraordinary example of music that's hard to just listen to\\", and requires the listener to \\"enter it\\" to appreciate the \\"haunting\\" music with his \\"erudite and often surrealistic\\" words that she found difficult to understand. She recognises his classical influences which is simultaneously \\"futuristic and ageless\\" and cites \\"We're All as We Lie\\" as the best example of his unconventional style, and suggested the album will appeal to esoteric music fans. She ended by praising Cross's artwork. The Times of Munster, Indiana rated the album as one of the best progressive rock albums of 1978 and is \\"most worthy of your listening time\\". It praised the contributions of Giles and Collins, and concludes: \\"The album simply shimmers with Phillips's delicate tunes\\". In a retrospective review, Dave Thompson for AllMusic gave the album four stars out of five. He recognised the album was made during \\"an invigorating period\\" for Phillips and noted his increased confidence \\"oozes out of every groove\\". Thompson rated Wise After the Event as more cohesive than The Geese & the Ghost but lacks the experimental nature of his predecessor and considered it to have too many ballads and \\"samey\\" music. He praises \\"We're All as We Lie\\" and the \\"multi-textured\\" title track as \\"career-enhancing classics\\". Reissues In 1990, Wise After the Event was released on CD by Virgin Records, with \\"Squirrel\\" as a bonus track. This was followed by a 2-CD remastered edition released in July 2007 in Japan by Arcangelo Records with a limited edition mini-vinyl sleeve. Included is \\"Squirrel\\" and a disc of 14 previously unreleased tracks of demos and out- takes. A standard CD jewel case version was released in the UK by Voiceprint Records in May 2008. In February 2016, Esoteric Recordings released a 4-disc Deluxe Edition of the album with a new stereo mix completed in 2016, a second CD containing the same bonus material as the 2008 Voiceprint release, and a third CD with a remastered version of the original stereo mix. The fourth disc is a DVD containing a new 5.1 surround sound. All mixes were completed using the original multi-track master tapes. Also included is a poster and a 20-page booklet with photos and extensive liner notes. Phillips did consider going back to the original concept and present it with an accompanying EP and with the originally planned track order, but decided against it with the idea of inserting links of music as people would have got used to how the album was released.

It commences at Roma Street station, Brisbane, and largely parallels the Queensland coast to Cairns in Far North Queensland. The line is electrified between Brisbane and Rockhampton. Along the way, the 1680 km railway passes through the numerous towns and cities of eastern Queensland including Nambour, Bundaberg, Gladstone, Rockhampton, Mackay and Townsville. The line though the centre of Rockhampton runs down the middle of Denison Street. History The North Coast Line (NCL) has one of the most interesting and complex histories of any railway in Queensland. The first section was opened in 1881, the final section in 1924, and the line was opened in over 60 sections during that period. It incorporates sections of lines built by local governments and subsequently taken over by the Queensland Railways, one isolated section was closed for two years following a financial crisis and another isolated section was initially built as a gauge line. Progress was hampered by several financial setbacks, debate over competing routes and parliamentary approval to connect Cairns to Rockhampton and Brisbane was not given until 1910. Construction standards varied significantly depending upon the era and initial purpose of the section built. There have been five major and numerous minor deviations to improve the alignment of the original line, and three sections of it are duplicated. =First narrow gauge mainline= Queensland was the first jurisdiction in the world to adopt narrow gauge () for its main lines,Kerr, J. 'Triumph of Narrow Gauge' Boolarong Publications 1990 with the Main Line opening between Ipswich and Toowoomba between 1865-67. By 1880 over 1,000 km of line had been opened, connecting Brisbane to Roma and Warwick and Rockhampton to Emerald, with a line from Townsville to Charters Towers under construction. The pattern of early Queensland railway development was focused upon providing transport from inland areas to ports at the lowest possible cost. Coastal shipping provided adequate connections between the coastal communities and so priority given to building railways which would facilitate development and immigration to the interior of the colony. =Beginnings= The first section of what is now the NCL opened on 6 August 1881. It was built to connect the mining town of Gympie to a river port at Maryborough, and followed the Mary River valley. The Queensland Government was under constant pressure to reduce expenditure, and so despite the potential for the line to be part of a future main line, the line was constructed to pioneer standards with minimal earthworks, a sinuous alignment and lightweight rails. Further south a suburban railway was opened between Roma Street and Northgate (and Sandgate) on 11 May 1882, via Normanby. A direct line from Roma Street to Bowen Hills via Central station was opened in 1890, including a 770-metre tunnel, still the longest on the system. The government formally decided to link Brisbane to Gladstone in 1883, but there was a demand for the southern connecting line to be from Esk to Kilkivan. Whilst that route may have served areas of fertile land, it was very hilly terrain, and the cost of earthworks would have been substantial. The coastal route would serve less promising agricultural land, but would be less expensive to build. As the Queensland parliament was dominated by rural members, both routes were surveyed in detail, taking six years due to the shortage of surveyors and the terrain involved. By the time the surveys were finished it was apparent the inland route would be prohibitively expensive, and the coastal route was approved. The first section of line formally known as the NCL was opened from North Coast Junction (now Northgate) to Petrie and Caboolture in 1888. =Wide Bay extension= Coal had been discovered at Burrum, 25 km north of Maryborough, and a line was constructed to serve the mine, opening in 1883. The line was extended to Bundaberg in 1888 so coal could be shipped there as well. =11 isolated railways= The opening of the isolated Bowen section of railway in 1890 (see below) had resulted in there being 11 separate railway systems operating in Queensland, including the Brisbane, Maryborough and North Bundaberg lines. This was reduced to nine once the Burnett Bridge and the linking of the Brisbane and Maryborough systems occurred, and the number of isolated systems gradually reduced as the NCL progressed, though two lines were never connected to the remainder of the system. =First connection= The coastal route was approved in 1889, with construction starting from both Caboolture and Gympie, and the linking section opened in 1891. It was built to main line standard with rail, minimum radius curves and 1 in 50 (2%) maximum grades, equivalent to 1 in 48 (~2.1%) on a minimum radius curve. This section features the only two tunnels on the entire NCL, one being 191 m, the other 160 m. An example of the benefits of a connected system was the decision by the CSR sugar company in 1895 to rail sugar from Childers to Brisbane instead of using coastal shipping from Maryborough. =To Port Curtis= Parliament approved the Bundaberg to Gladstone line whilst the Brisbane-Gympie competing survey work was still underway, and contracts were let in 1888. A railway had opened from North Bundaberg to Mount Perry in 1884, that line starting from the opposite side of the Burnett River from the main part of Bundaberg in order to save the cost of constructing a bridge. The 534 metre bridge over the river connecting the two lines opened in 1891. Construction continued north, and the next section to Rosedale opened in 1892. The largest bank in Queensland collapsed following the 1893 Brisbane flood, and the subsequent financial downturn resulted in a 2-year halt in construction. The line to Gladstone finally opened in 1897. =Temporary resistance= Gladstone has the best port in central Queensland, and except for the Canoona gold rush near Rockhampton it may have become the main regional city. Rockhampton business interests were very successful in resisting the construction of a railway south of their city in order to prevent freight from the Central West line travelling to Gladstone and its deep water port, and continued to resist that proposal even after the Brisbane – Gladstone link was opened. Therefore, in 1898 the government established an overnight steamer service between Gladstone and Rockhampton, initially with the ‘Miner’. The Gladstone Boat Mail departed Brisbane at 9pm three days per week, arriving at Gladstone at 12:20pm the following day, where the steamer would be waiting, but not depart until the tide was suitable. This gave a minimum journey time of 22 hours between Brisbane and Rockhampton, but if the train arrived just after a suitable tide, the transit time could be up to 11 hours longer. The steamer docked at Broadmount jetty and passengers transferred to the awaiting train. Until the 244 metre Alexandra Bridge opened in November 1899 (including the 1.85 km section of line travelling along the middle of Deniston Street), the train terminated at North Rockhampton. A steamer service from Gladstone to Mackay and Townsville was also introduced, with the weekly Boat Mail running onto the Gladstone wharf right beside the ship from 1908, and operated until the NCL connection to Townsville was opened in 1923. In an attempt to reduce the tidal influence on the voyage timing, the government purchased a stern paddle wheel steamer called the 'Premier' in 1899, but that didn't solve the problem. It is an indication of the strength of resistance to a southern rail connection from Rockhampton that this vessel was purchased. An indication of how quickly the advantages of a rail connection over coastal shipping then diluted that resistance can be seen by the approval of the Gladstone - Rockhampton line just one year later, the entire 101 km line opening in 1903. Events further north Tully station, 1930 Bowen was the first settlement in north Queensland, and had the best harbour in the region. Once again gold resulted in a less desirable port being utilised when the Northern line to Charters Towers was constructed from Townsville. To make political amends, a line was opened from Bowen 39 km towards the Northern line, and extended another 30 km in 1891. Construction then halted due to debate over the junction point, Bowen business interests wanting it as close to the goldfields as possible whilst Townsville wanted a coastal route that would serve good sugar cane growing areas, north Queensland's main agricultural crop. The 1893 financial crisis stymied further progress, and as the Bowen line's main customer was an abattoir, there was little interest in further expenditure on the government's behalf. =Tramways= As a result, the local governments in the Townsville and Ayr districts formed the Ayr Tramway Joint Board (ATJB) to construct a 69 km line south to the cane lands. The Railway Guarantee Act 1895, which required local governments to guarantee any losses incurred by railways they had requested the State government to build, resulted in some regional communities believing they were paying for railways built to a standard more costly than necessary. Local governments could utilise the provisions of the Tramway Act 1880 to build local railways more cheaply. Whilst the gauge matched QR’s lines, in other respects the tramways were more akin to the pioneer lines built 30 years earlier, with low maximum axle load, minimum earthworks and in some cases an alignment sharing a road corridor. The ATJB secured loan funds from the State, and the line opened in 1901. Under the same provisions, Cairns Shire Council built a 23 km line south to Gordonvale in 1897, and extended it 37 km to Babinda in 1910. =Bowen's blues= A further financial crisis following the Federation drought in 1903 resulted in the line being closed and leased to the local abattoir for two years, until the government resumed public operations when improved finances allowed. The residents of Proserpine, 61 km south of Bowen, unsuccessfully lobbied for a rail connection and so the local governments followed the ATJB model and constituted the Bowen Proserpine Joint Tramway Board and opened a line in 1910. RM 1901 crosses the Styx River on the original bridge, ~1991. This bridge has since been replaced with a high level concrete structure North Coast Railway Act 1740 hauls a special train over the new Styx River bridge, ~1993 The passing of the North Coast Railway Act 1910 finally committed the government to linking Cairns, Townsville and Mackay to Rockhampton and Brisbane. It authorised Queensland Railways to construct 731 km of new line and purchase the 192 km of tramways that would become part of the route. As in the case of the GWR Act passed on the same day, regional rivalries required construction to commence as simultaneously as possible, spreading resources and slowing down overall progress. Priority was subsequently given to sections that would serve cane country, as despite situations such as the Childers- Brisbane sugar traffic, long distance freight traffic was not expected to grow once lines were connected. The NCL was seen as mainly benefiting passengers, especially as bad weather could frequently disrupt coastal shipping during the cyclone season. The main works were bridges over the numerous, and often wide coastal river systems, and a 12-long ton axle load was established for all new construction, requiring the tramways to be raised to the same standard. Construction was divided into five regions, described as sections A - E,Armstrong, J. & Kerr, J. 'Sunshine Route Jubilee' ARHS 1975 being: Section A – Rockhampton to St Lawrence Section B - St Lawrence to Mackay Section C - Mackay to Proserpine, Bobawaba (end of the Bowen line) to the Burdekin River and upgrading the Proserpine tramway. Section D - Burdekin River to Ayr, Townsville to Cardwell and upgrading the Ayr tramway Section E - Cardwell to Babinda and upgrading the tramway to Cairns Daradgee Bridge, spanning the North Johnstone River, north of Innisfail. The last span of the north coast line bridge is being put into place. The main span of this bridge was floated into position from the Innisfail side on 31 October 1924 and was finally lowered on its bearings on 4 November 1924. The work was completed on 25 November 1924. First train over the Daradgee bridge Train from Townsville crosses the Daradgee bridge Crowd celebrating the opening of the Daradgee Bridge, 8 December 1924 =Construction commences= The Cairns to Babinda and Stuart (Townsville) to Ayr tramways were purchased in 1911, and southern extensions commenced that year, together with a line south from Mackay, with the new junction station being called Paget in honour of the local politician who was Minister for Railways. An 8 km extension south of Babinda was opened in 1912, with further work then suspended for 8 years due to the expensive bridging required to connect to Innisfail. Construction north from Rockhampton also commenced in 1911, and the Bowen line, with a gap of only 35 km to Ayr, was connected to Townsville in 1913, including the 760 m Burdekin River bridge. Construction north of Townsville commenced that year, and all sections were opened progressively to provide access for the local communities. For example, the 111 km to Ingham was opened in seven sections between 1914-1919, the shortest being 8 km. The highest point on the entire NCL is situated north of Rockhampton, at 136 metres above sea level, whilst the Burdekin River crossing was built as a low level bridge, designed to allow flood waters to flow over it with minimal damage, leading to frequent disruptions to traffic during the wet season. However, the bridge suffered major washaways in 1917, 1918, 1925, 1940 and 1945, leading to its replacement by a high level bridge in 1957. =Progress slows= Construction was slowed by the impacts of World War I, though the Don-Proserpine tramway was purchased in 1917 when construction north from Mackay commenced. Another financial crisis halted construction on that section in 1920 for 2 years. However construction continued south of Mackay, and it was linked to Rockhampton and beyond in 1921. Although upgrading works were not completed, the connection to Townsville was opened on the centenary of John Oxley's landing at the site of Brisbane in 1823, and once works were finished in 1924 the Mail train took 38 hours from Brisbane, and express fruit specials did the journey in 40 hours. =A narrower gauge= Work north of Ingham commenced in 1919, halted in 1920 and recommenced in 1922, whilst work towards Innisfail included laying the rails to gauge temporarily to facilitate delivery of construction materials via the local sugar cane tramway. The sugar mill agreed to carry passengers, and Innisfail residents could then reach Cairns by train, changing to the wider gauge at Garradunga. =The completion of the railway line= The final 94 km section, including major bridges at Daradgee, opened on 10 December 1924, enabling a 52-hour journey time from Cairns to Brisbane. Opening dates summary A list of the section opening dates is here. This list shows the original opening date for each section, ignoring any subsequent deviations etc. A list of the opening dates in chronological order is here. This list shows the known opening dates for all line construction, including deviations, plus the known dates of other significant NCL related events etc. Subsequent upgrading The sections built to main line standard had a speed limit of 64 km/h, and the tramways were gradually brought to this standard in the years following their purchase. The maximum axle load from Brisbane as far as Gympie was 8 tons in 1914, and that was extended to Bundaberg by 1918, and Rockhampton by 1924. The axle load was increased in the 1930s to 12 tons as far as Townsville. During World War II over 30 crossing loops were added between Maryborough - Cairns to cater for the enormous growth in traffic on the line at that time. A 1090 m high level road and rail bridge over the Burdekin River was opened in 1957, reducing wet season disruptions to traffic. High level bridges were also built at Guthalungra in 1949, over the Haughton River in 1959 and the Russell River in 1966 for the same reason. Although not an upgrade, when steam locomotives were retired from service in the late 1960s, the removal of the 'hammer blow' of their reciprocating driving wheels enabled the maximum axle load to be increased to 15 tons, and also enabled the maximum speed to increase to 80 km/h. =Safeworking and Signalling= Services were originally operated by the Staff and Ticket method, with Electric Staff later introduced from Brisbane - Avondale (north of Bundaberg) to cater for increased traffic on that section. Centralised Traffic Control (CTC) signalling was introduced from Toolooa (south of Gladstone) - Rockhampton in 1975 to cater for the growing coal traffic from the Blackwater area, with CTC subsequently introduced from Gympie - Avondale in 1980, Caboolture - Gympie in 1982 and Avondale - Toolooa in 1988. CTC now extends as far as Townsville, with the remained of the line controlled by Direct Traffic Control (DTC). =Station upgrades= In linking certain isolated sections, the construction of the NCL resulted in certain station layouts that, whilst satisfactory as terminal stations, were sub-optimal as through stations, such as Maryborough, Mackay, Bowen and Townsville. It also created some undesirable or unusual line alignments, such as south of Gympie and north of Rockhampton. The location of the original Gympie station resulted in the line from Brisbane requiring a grade of 1 in 45 (~2.2%) for the last 4 km from Monkland station. This was the steepest grade on the entire NCL, and goods trains were frequently pushed by a second locomotive specially stationed at Monkland for that purpose. The Gympie bypass mentioned below resolved that situation when it opened in 1988. When the Burrum line was built, it junctioned from the Maryborough line at Baddow, 3 km from the station, creating a triangular junction, with platforms ultimately being provided on all three sides. Maryborough station was situated immediately adjacent to the commercial centre of the city, and converting it into a through station would have been prohibitively expensive. When through trains commenced running from Brisbane to Bundaberg and beyond, trains ran into Maryborough, a fresh steam locomotive was attached to the other end of the train, and it then departed. Once diesel locomotives were introduced, there was no need to replace engines, and through trains paused at Baddow on the 3rd leg of the triangular junction before proceeding north. A one carriage connecting service was provided from Maryborough to meet the through train at Baddow, and then return. As trains became longer, the platform on the 3rd leg was not of sufficient length, and the trains would stop on the platform on the line to Maryborough, having to reverse out of, or back into the platform before proceeding further, adding about 15 minutes to the journey. The situation was finally resolved with the opening of the Maryborough West bypass in 1988, detailed below. Mackay station was able to be converted to a through station when the NCL was constructed, but that involved an alignment passing close to the city centre with multiple level crossings. When the original Pioneer River bridge required replacement to achieve a 20 tonne axle load, the opportunity was taken to create what was effectively a West Mackay bypass, built from Paget to the new bridge which was west of the existing one. The new Mackay station is located about 1 km south of Paget. The conversion of Bowen station from a terminal station into a through station was achieved by building what is known today as a balloon loop, with all trains traveling clockwise around the loop, halting at the station, then proceeding onwards. As with Mackay, the need to replace a bridge to enable a 20 tonne axle load presented an opportunity for a short realignment providing a more direct route. The new Bowen station is situated on the western edge of the town. The Townsville station conversion also involved the construction of a loop, but as the original station was in a narrow corridor between the city centre and the north bank of Ross Creek, expansion of the goods yard occurred on the south side of the creek. Rationalisation of the overall station layout became imperative as train length grew, and a new section of line bypassing the original station was built. The new Townsville station straddles Ross Creek. =Alignment upgrades= Deviations were opened in 1988 at Eumundi, Gympie, Maryborough and Benaraby in preparation for the electrification of the line as far as Rockhampton, providing a net reduction in route length of 7.88 km (including minor deviations at North Arm and Tamaree). The 9.553 km Eumundi Range deviation added 0.567 km route length but eased the grade from 1 in 48 (~2.1%) to 1 in 90 (1.1%) and reduced the minimum curve to 550m radius. The 9.575 km Gympie bypass removed the steepest grade on the entire North Coast line, reducing the grade from 1 in 45 (~2.2%) to 1 in 100 (1%), as well as reducing the route length by 2.434 km. The 6.705 km Maryborough West project eliminated the need for passenger trains to back into or out of Baddow station as well as reducing the route length by 3.976 km. The 15.658 km realigned Benaraby bank crossed the original sharply curved alignment 8 times, and reduced the route length by 2.04 km. The benefit of these deviations is demonstrated by the reduction in the Capricornian transit time from 13 hours 55 minutes to 12 hours 35 minutes without any change to motive power or train load. A major realignment of the Gympie-Maryborough section was undertaken in the mid 1990s, finally addressing the legacy of the original 'pioneer' alignment imposed a century before. =Duplications= The section from Bowen Hills to Eagle Junction was duplicated in 1886, extended to Northgate in 1890 and Caboolture in 1917. The section from Roma Street to Bowen Hills was opened as double track, one of the few lines in Queensland so built, in 1890. The line from Caboolture to Beerburrum was duplicated when realigned in 2009, meaning the first 65 km of the NCL is duplicated. Plans have been announced to realign and duplicate to Nambour (a further 40 km), but the completion date is 2031. The 98 km section from Callemondah (junction for the coal unloading terminal north of Gladstone) to Rocklands (junction with the Blackwater coal system) was duplicated in sections between ~1985-95. The 10 km from Townsville to Stuart (junction of the Mount Isa line) was duplicated in 1936, and extended a further 10 km to Nome in 1963. The growth in patronage on suburban trains as a result of the 1980s electrification scheme resulted in the quadruplication of the Roma St-Northgate section in 1996, including 2 pairs of single track tunnels and the utilisation of the Bowen Hills tunnel widened 20 years earlier. Some of the roadbed and bridge abutments had been built in the 1950s before the original quadruplication scheme was abandoned. A third line had been added as far as Lawnton, which was extended to Petrie as part of the Redcliffe Peninsula line which opened in 2016. =Electrification= The NCL between Brisbane and Rockhampton was electrified in 1989. Details of this project are in this article. As part of the project, minor deviations were made to improve the alignment, including new bridges over Coochin Creek (south of Beerwah), either side of Woombye, and at Curra (north of Harvey's Siding). 1738 hauls a short livestock train south along the Denison Street section of the NCL. This line has since been reduced to single track =The line in 2013= The growth of traffic on the NCL has resulted in a number of improvements, including relaying with heavier rail, re-sleepering with concrete and steel sleepers and a higher axle load. The entire line now has a 20-tonne axle load and continuously welded rail. The major coal haulage section between Gladstone and Rockhampton is rail, whilst the balance of the line to Townsville is a combination of & . The Townsville-Cairns section is & . The lower weight rail is used for passing loops. When it was decided to connect the Rockhampton and North Rockhampton lines by bridging the Fitzroy River, land purchase costs were saved by building the line from Rockhampton station along Denison Street for 1.85 km, and this alignment is still utilised today. This section is the only line in Queensland to have been opened as dual track and subsequently been reduced to a single track, to ensure two trains are not on the Alexandra Bridge at the same time, as having been built in 1897 it has a limited load capacity. The maximum speed is 100 km/h to Townsville, with the tilt trains permitted 160 km/h to Mackay, and 140 km/h beyond. The Townsville-Cairns limit is 80 km/h with the tilt train permitted 100 km/h. Since 2008, the North Coast railway has been identified as requiring major improvements as its speed is becoming uncompetitive with road transport. Branch/connecting lines Passengers at the Emu Park Railway Station ~1890 RM 1901 at Yeppoon station, ~1991 RM 2017 at Greenvale station about to depart on the fortnightly service to Townsville, ~1991 RM 2017 emerges from a tunnel in the Hervey Range on the Greenvale to Yabulu line, ~1991 RM 2017 crosses an empty nickel ore train hauled by 2207, on the Gereenvale to Yabulu line ~1991 Many rural lines do or did branch off the North Coast Line. They are listed below from south to north. Caboolture - Kilcoy 56 km opened between 1909–13, closed 1964 when it was decided not to relocate the line for the raising of the Somerset Dam, except for the 11 km to Wamuran which remained for pineapple farmers to ship to a Brisbane cannery, that section closing in 1996. Buderim Tramway - an 11.5 km, gauge line was opened from Palmwoods station (33 m asl) to Buderim (185 m asl) by the Maroochy Shire Council in 1914, built at a cost of £34,000. The local community's enthusiasm for the line can be seen from the fact that 72% of the land required for the tramway () was donated. Two services a day were operated, plus additional runs during fruit harvesting season. The journey time was one hour, with a return fare being 5/- (five shillings) and freight costing 17/6 (17 shillings and sixpence) per long ton. Two locomotives were operated, a Shay locomotive, noted as out of service in 1932, and a Krauss tank locomotive, which has been preserved at Buderim. The line closed in 1935 due to the loss of fruit and timber traffic to road transport. Mapleton Tramway - The Moreton Central Sugar Mill at Nambour (~20 m asl) commenced operation in 1897 and constructed a series of gauge tramways to carry sugar cane to the mill. Land at Dulong, (west of Nambour and ~240 m asl) was considered suitable for sugar cane cultivation so a 9 km line was constructed between 1897 and 1905 with 1 in 20 (5%) grades and 2 chain (~40 m) radius curves, initially horse operated, and featuring a ~15 m deep cutting through rock to avoid the need for two tunnels. A Shay locomotive was purchased in 1908, but despite the improved economics of locomotive hauled trains, sugar cane cultivation declined at Dulong in favour of fruit growing and dairy farming. The mill commenced public haulage of passengers and freight on the line in 1909, which led to calls by the residents of Mapleton (~360 m asl) for the line to be extended there. The sugar mill had no interest in doing so, and the Maroochy Shire Council purchased the line and rollingstock in 1914 and extended the line a further 9 km the following year, purchasing a second Shay locomotive at the same time. The journey time was two hours, and initially two services per day (Sunday excepted) were timetabled, with a fare of 2/- to Mapleton, 3d (three pennies) per case of fruit and freight at 7/6 per ton. In 1929 the service was reduced to one train per day. A sawmill at Mapleton was purchased by the Hornibrook construction company in the early 1930s, and the hardwood piles and girders for the Hornibrook Bridge were transported by the tramway, transferring to QR trains at Nambour. The line was closed in 1944 and purchased by the mill, which continued to operate the first 2 km section for seasonal sugar cane haulage until 1970. The mill closed in 2003.Knowles, J., 'The Mapleton Tramway', self published 2004 One of the Shay locomotives is preserved at Nambour. Monkland - Brooloo 44 km opened between 1914–15, the Mary Valley Railway branched off near Gympie. Closed between 1993–95, a heritage group operated the Valley Rattler as far as Imbil until 2012. A 1920 approved extension to Kenilworth was never constructed. Theebine - Murgon system The first section of a network of branches, opened 1886, now all closed. Monto Loop branched off at Mungar near Maryborough, and rejoined the NCL at Gladstone, closed 1 July 2012. Colton - Urangan opened between 1896-1913, initially to facilitate sugar exports. Closed 1993. Isis Junction - Dallarnal 81 km opened between 1887-1913, closed between 1955-64. Bundaberg - Pemberton 23 km opened between 1894-1912, closed between 1948-59 except for the first 3 km serving industries, which closed in 1995. North Bundaberg - Mount Perry 105 km opened between 1881-84 to serve a copper mine and smelter. Sugar cane later became the main traffic east of Gin Gin, and the section west of there closed in 1960. The remainder closed in 1993. Gladstone - Monto the northern junction of the Monto-Mungar Junction loop mentioned above, closed beyond Taragoola 1 July 2012. Bajool - Port Alma 26 km opened 1912 to provide an additional port for Rockhampton, the last 10 km closed in 1986, the remainder serving a salt works until closure in 1990. Rockhampton - Winton the Central West line Line opened 1867-1928. The Spirit of the Outback passenger service operates between Brisbane and Longreach. Alton Downs Junction - Ridgelands 28 km opened 1916, closed 1955 except the first 1 km to a siding, which closed in 1968. North Rockhampton - Emu Park 47 km opened 1888 in order to provide a line to the seaside for Rockhampton, with subsequent lines opening from Nankin Junction to Broadmount (24 km) in 1898 and Sleipner Junction to Yeppoon (32 km) in 1909. The Broadmount line closed in 1929, being the first branch line closed by QR. The Emu Park - Sleipner Junction section closed in 1964, and the Yeppoon line beyond Lakes Creek ~2007. 'Suburban' frequency (14/day) services were provided between Rockhampton and the abattoir at Lakes Creek for workers between 1913–1930. Goonyella coal system, technically not a branch of the NCL, it parallels the line for ~5 km between Yukan and Sarina, before crossing the NCL on a flyover to the Hay Point coal loading port. Mackay - Netherdale opened between 1885 and 1911. Closed between 1977 and 2007. Merinda - Collinsville opened 1922 to haul coal, extended to Newlands in 1984 and to North Goonyella (connecting to the Goonyella system) in 2012. Townsville - Mt Isa the Great Northern line junctions at Stuart, with The Inlander passenger service operating to Mount Isa. Yabulu - Greenvale opened 1974, this line hauled nickel ore from a mine near Greenvale to a refinery north of Townsville, and featured 3 tunnels through the Hervey Range. It closed in 1993 when the ore was exhausted. Ore was then shipped from New Caledonia to the Port of Townsville and railed from there to Yabulu until the refinery closed in 2016. Innisfail Tramway - Until 1910 Innisfail was known as Geraldton. An 11 km gauge tramway was built from Mourilyan Harbour to the South Johnstone River about 5 km south of Geraldton in 1883 to facilitate construction of the Mourilyan sugar mill. By 1898 there were ~ of sugar tramways in the Geraldton district servicing the Mourilyan and Goondi mills. The Geraldton Shire Council decided to build a line to service the upper Johnston River valley, which opened to Nerada in 1902 featuring 1 in 30 (3.3%) grades and 3 chain (~60 m) radius curves. gauge was chosen because of the existing tramways, and a branchline was built to service the South Johnstone mill (situated about 8 km further upstream from the Mourilyan mill). In addition to seasonal sugar cane, the line hauled passengers, bananas and timber. Under the provisions of the North Coast Railway Act 1910 ('NCRA'), QR purchased the tramway from the Innisfail Shire Council in 1915, as well as the Mourilyan Harbour line from the Mourilyan mill and constructed a 5 km line featuring a 123 m timber trestle bridge over the South Johnstone River to connect the two lines. The NCRA authorised construction of a gauge line from Innisfail to Mourilyan Harbour, and the QR purchase of the tramway lines was to enable transportation of construction materials for the NCL to a major works site established at Innisfail, a extension of the tramline to the QR station site being built for that purpose, with an engine shed that serviced both and QR locos. WW1 meant that construction of the NCL north and south from Innisfail did not start until 1920, and in the meantime QR operated the 'Innisfail Tramway' with 11 mixed services per week plus additional trains to haul sugar cane in season. Processed sugar from the South Johnstone mill began to be hauled to Mourilyan Harbour, and this traffic grew to the extent that a balloon loop was built at the expanded port to facilitate unloading in 1922. The NCL opened in 1924, connecting Innisfail to Townsville and Cairns, and while a short branch was built to the South Johnstone mill, the proposed line to Mourilyan Harbour was not, and QR continued to operate the tramway. While passenger numbers declined from ~108,000 in 1922 to ~6,000 in 1937, and ceased in 1948, freight loadings grew from ~61,000 long tons (including 20,000 tons of cane) in 1922 to ~130,000 tons (95% cane) in 1934. Diesel locomotives were introduced in 1954, with steam locomotion ceasing in 1962, enabling tonnage to reach ~300,000 in 1967. Despite having an operating ratio of 43.9% in 1969, the tramway was seen as a non-core asset by QR and sold to the South Johnstone mill in 1977, which continues to operate the majority of the system for sugar cane haulage, though the transportation of processed sugar to Mourilyan Harbour was replaced by road transport in 1997. A Rail ambulance operated on the tramway from 1915 until the early 1930s.Armstrong, J. & Verhoeven, G.H., 'The Innisfail Tramway', Light Railway Research Soc. 2000 Cairns - Forsyth the Tablelands system west of Cairns includes the Savannahlander tourist passenger tour, a 4-day round trip. Services =Passenger services= Initially all trains were 'mixed', carrying both goods and passengers. It was an efficient method for areas with low population, and whilst not quick by today's standards, it was still a vast improvement on horse-drawn coaches and wagons. When the Brisbane and Maryborough systems were connected in 1891, through passenger trains were introduced, including sleeping cars but without dining cars, as refreshment stops were made to coincide with the need to water steam locomotives every 80 km or so. The train departed Roma Street at 7:50am, arriving at Gympie at 1pm, Maryborough at 4pm and Bundaberg at 6:45pm. The return service departed 7:10am, arriving at Roma Street at 6:10pm. In 1898 the Brisbane–Bundaberg transit time was reduced to 10 hours, with a further 5 hours required to travel to Gladstone. When the steamer service from Gladstone was introduced (see 'Temporary resistance' above), the 'Boat Mail' began running, and after the extension to Rockhampton opened, a weekly Boat Mail still ran (until 1923) to connect to the Townsville steamer service. =Rockhampton services= In 1903 the Rockhampton Mail began running 3 times per week, departing Brisbane at 10pm and arriving at Rockhampton 4pm the following day. The return services departed Rockhampton at noon, arriving at Brisbane at 6am the following morning. The breakfast (and dinner for the southbound services) stop was at Bundaberg, and the trains averaged 64 km/h (40 mph). Foot-warmers were introduced for first class passengers as far as Bundaberg in 1911, and provided each winter until 1958. There were six Rockhampton Mail trains/week in 1914, reduced to 5 times per week in the 1930s. In 1938 a new series of passenger cars were introduced, known as Sunshine cars. The introduction of diesel locomotives in 1952 enabled the Brisbane-Rockhampton transit time to be reduced by 2.25 hours. Until then increases in steam locomotive power over time had been matched by increased train weight, meaning the transit time had not significantly changed for 50 years. An Electric Tilt Train When The Sunlander air-conditioned express train to Cairns was introduced in 1953, the Rocky Mail retained its wooden carriages, and a surcharge and booking restrictions deterred Rockhampton bound travelers from using the air-conditioned services. Following the construction of further air-conditioned cars, the Capricornian replaced the Rockhampton Mail in 1970, taking 14.25 hours for the overnight trip and running 5 times per week. It was replaced by the Spirit of the Outback in 1993, which runs from Brisbane to Longreach, largely to cater for the 'rail cruising' tourism market. Following the electrification of the NCL to Rockhampton in 1988, a new intercity multiple unit train, the Spirit of Capricorn was introduced as a daytime service. With a maximum speed of 120 km/h, the transit time was reduced to 9 hours. The current daytime service is provided by Queensland's Electric Tilt Train, introduced in 1998 with a maximum service speed of 160 km/h, and a transit time of 7 hours and 30 minutes. =Townsville and Cairns services= 1556 and a 1720 class haul The Sunlander northbound through Yabulu, ~1991. The Greenvale line flyover is in the background When introduced in 1923, the Townsville Mail ran twice per week. Departing Brisbane at 2:20pm, it arrived at Rockhampton at 7am the following morning, Mackay at 5pm, Bowen 11:20pm and Townsville at 5:30am on the second morning. The return service departed Townsville at 9pm, arriving at Brisbane 11:15am on the second morning. When the connection opened to Cairns the following year, one train per week continued on from Townsville after a 2-hour break, arriving at Cairns at 6:30pm. The return service departed at 6:50am, arriving at Townsville at 5:10pm, and continued south after an hours' break, arriving at Brisbane at 7:20am, 48.5 hours after leaving Cairns. Following the opening of the Sydney–Brisbane standard gauge line in 1930, the NCL timetable was rearranged to facilitate connections to the new line. The northbound Mail departed Brisbane at 7pm, arriving at Townsville at 7:30am on the second day, and Cairns at 6pm. Return departure from Cairns was at 7:40am, Townsville at 5:50pm arriving Brisbane at 6:30am on the second day. The parlour car that had been part of the Sydney Mail to Wallangarra was transferred to the Townsville Mail, and a buffet car (replaced by a full dining car in 1931) was added from Rockhampton-Mackay and return. In May 1935 the first all roller-bearing equipped train in Australia was introduced, called the Sunshine Express, with six services to Townsville each week, reduced to four per week during the wet season. Three trains per week continued to Cairns, on the other three days a rail motor provided the connection. The parlour car was withdrawn during World War 2 and never replaced.A Diesel Tilt Train at Bowen Hills stationIn 1953 the air-conditioned Sunlander was introduced, diesel hauled, with the dining car attached at Bundaberg and detached at Mackay. The diesel locomotive reduced the northbound transit time by 2.75 hours, with the train departing Brisbane at 9:30pm, Bundaberg 6:05am, Townsville 5:45am the second morning and arriving Cairns at 2:40pm. The return service departed Cairns at 2pm, arriving Brisbane at 6:30am the second morning, a 4-hour improvement on the steam hauled journey. In 1970 the dining car was attached to the train for the entire journey, until that time the train had stopped for meal breaks at Townsville and Tully. Today, services between Brisbane, Townsville and Cairns are provided by the Diesel Tilt Train, with a duration of 24 hours. =Suburban Services= Relatively high frequency services were provided between Townsville and the Oolbun meatworks (serviced by a short branch from Nome) from 1916-1930, with the services being retained as far as Stuart until 1969. Similar services ran between Cairns and Gordonvale from 1927-1969. =Travelling Post Offices= Travelling Post Offices (TPO) operated on the line between October 1900 and 1930. They were housed in a separate van where mail was collected, sorted and delivered as the train was in motion. At places where the train did not usually stop, mail arms were erected, from which an occupant of the mail van could retrieve a mail bag whilst the train was travelling; deliveries were effected by dropping a bag of mail onto the platform. The first NCL TPO service was from Brisbane to Bundaberg. In 1908 it was extended to Rockhampton. From 1924 mail was carried by train beyond Rockhampton to Townsville but without a TPO service being established. Up to six TPOs were operated at the same time to meet staffing and timetable requirements. =Freight services= In 1905 a goods wagon loaded in Brisbane on a Monday afternoon would be available for unloading in Rockhampton the following Friday. By 1912 improvements to locomotives, the line itself and timetabling improvements enabled an acceleration so that goods wagons would be available for unloading in Rockhampton on the following Thursday, and by 1919 on the following Wednesday. In 1926 the fastest regular goods service from Brisbane to Townsville took 79 hours. By 1929 it had been accelerated to 66 hours, and to 42 hours in 1931. As an indication of the amount of freight moved on the NCL during the height of World War 2, in 1943-44, 54% of the entire system's gross tonnage was hauled on the line, yet the NCL recorded only 16% of the route mileage that year. Following the introduction of diesel locomotives on NCL freight trains in the 1950s, express goods trains took 14.25 hours from Brisbane to Rockhampton, and 37 hours to Townsville. In 1965 there were 15 express goods trains from Brisbane to Townsville per week, which had increased to 19 per week by 1975. Express goods wagons were attached to The Sunlander north of Townsville in the 1950s, technically making it a mixed train for the section to Cairns. Freight services today are operated by Aurizon and Pacific National Queensland. More than 11 million net tonnes of produce are transported via the line annually, including sugar, grain, minerals and cattle.

The fantastical elements of the story lead into a historically accurate depiction of Paul Revere's Midnight Ride at the start of the American Revolution. The novel's themes include liberty, freedom, loyalty, and the explosive tension between the Sons of Liberty and British Redcoats as the American Revolution begins. Real events described in the novel include Nikola Tesla's experiments at his 1899 laboratory in Colorado, the midnight ride of Paul Revere, and the Battles of Lexington and Concord. A factual section at the back of the book clarifies the difference between history and fiction in the story and adds further information. The novel was intended to be the first of a Shadow Fox series exploring key moments in history, but as of 2017 no further novels seem to have been published. Plot summary A walk in the Black Forest for twins Jacob and Erin turns into an adventure through time when they meet Shadow, a red fox with an unusual set of talents. They are welcomed to his underground laboratory, Hora Cella, and witness the power of Nikola Tesla's time travel device, the Wall of Light. On their first journey through the Wall of Light, they travel to Boston in 1775, to help Paul Revere and the Sons of Liberty spread the word that British Redcoats are on the march. Shadow has discovered seven gaps in the story of Paul Revere's midnight ride. If those gaps are not filled, the American Revolution may never be fought, and liberty as we know it will cease to exist. Travel through time with them and follow Paul Revere, William Dawes, and Samuel Prescott, ordinary men who choose to act for the cause of liberty. Meet Dr. Joseph Warren, one of the leaders of the Sons of Liberty, as he sets the famous ride in motion. Watch Robert Newman and John Pulling as they attempt to place signal lanterns in the steeple of the Old North Church. But, look out for Pratt! If he has his way, you could become trapped in a time when King George III rules, and there is no liberty and justice for all. Characters The novel features both fictional and historical characters. Shadow Fox - The protagonist. Shadow is the main character. He is a red fox whose abilities were created through an accidental meeting with Nikola Tesla. Nikola's real-life laboratory in Colorado Springs was the site of an amazing electrical experiment in 1899. Residents from as far away as Cripple Creek reported hearing a man-made lightning bolt generated at the laboratory, and the experiments shorted out the dynamo at the El Paso County power station causing a blackout. This real experiment was used in the book to transform Shadow from a normal fox to one with extraordinary abilities, including the ability to think like Nikola Tesla, and control electricity. Erin Fraser - Erin is 12 years old and Jacob's twin sister. She lives 'present day' in the Black Forest of Colorado near Fox Run Park. Her love of horseback riding comes in handy as she works with Shadow and Jacob to help Paul Revere. Jacob Fraser - Jacob is 12 years old, and like his father he is an inventor. He invented the \\"Fraser-matic Eavesdropper\\" from nothing more than pie pans and twine. It allows the user to listen in on conversations from long distances. Pratt - The antagonist. Colonel Pratt was expelled from the British military and as punishment for crimes against the crown he was condemned to live among the people of Boston who he had mistreated for many years. Pratt tries to capture Shadow, Erin, and Jacob, and ultimately stop the Sons of Liberty to win back the favor of General Thomas Gage. Junior and Runt - Nicknames for two fictional Redcoats. Both are large, imposing, but often bumbling British soldiers that chase after Shadow, Erin, and Jacob, and also stand in Pratt's way. Erin and Jacob nickname them Junior and Runt. Mr. & Mrs. Fraser - Mr. and Mrs. Fraser are the parents of Erin and Jacob. Mr. Fraser is an inventor on the verge of a big sale to an investor. Mrs. Fraser is a competitive horseback rider. They live near Fox Run Park in the Black Forest of Colorado, and have a barn with two horses (Rosie and Violet) and a workshop where Mr. Fraser works with Jacob. =Historical= Sons of Liberty - name given to more than one secret revolutionary organization in the Thirteen American Colonies (beginning with one formed in Boston in 1765 after the enactment of the Stamp Act of 1765), which looked to advance the rights of the European colonists and to fight taxation by the British government. Nikola Tesla - Serbian-American electrical engineer and inventor who patented an [AC] induction motor and also experimented x-rays, remote control, and numerous other devices. He built a Colorado Springs laboratory in 1899 to conducted experiments in wireless power transmission and communication. One of his large experimental coils there is used in the Shadow Fox: Sons of Liberty journal entry. This experiment is described in the book as the origin of Shadow Fox. The book also plays on something from Tesla lore called \\"The Wall of Light\\", envisioned as a way to travel through space and time. The Wall of Light is used to travel through time in the book. Paul Revere - a Boston silversmith, goldsmith, engraver, husband, father. He was dispatched on the night of April 18, 1775 with the task of warn John Hancock and Samuel Adams that a large number of Redcoats were on their way. William Dawes - Boston tanner active in the militia. A lesser-known rider the night of April 18, 1775. Dawes arrived in Lexington close the same time as Paul, but did not warn as many people (if anyone) along the way. His absence from Longfellow's poem relegated him to a footnote in many historical texts. Samuel Prescott - physician and a Massachusetts Patriot. He is best known for his role in Paul Revere's \\"midnight ride\\" to warn the townspeople and h was the only participant in the ride to reach Concord. Samuel Adams - Political leader of the Whigs in Boston. Samuel Adams was a creator of propaganda for the rebel cause. He wrote numerous pamphlets inciting and inspiring the revolution. John Hancock - One of the wealthiest men in Boston and a leader of the Sons of Liberty. Doctor Joseph Warren - One of the leaders of the Sons of Liberty in Boston. Dr. Warren sent Paul Revere and William Dawes on the midnight ride. Thomas Gage - British General and military governor of Boston during the occupation. Lord Percy and Francis Smith - British commanding officers at the Battles of Lexington and Concord. Robert Newman, Thomas Bernard, and John Pulling - Thomas stood guard while Robert and John raised the lanterns in the steeple of the Old North Church.

Its principal works were the situation comedy The Monkees (and the group of the same name), and the 1969 movie Easy Rider (co-produced with Peter Fonda's Pando Company). Raybert was also the predecessor to BBS Productions, a New Hollywood production company founded by Rafelson, Schneider, and Schneider’s childhood friend Stephen Blauner. BBS Productions' best known film is The Last Picture Show. History of Raybert Productions Wishing to break into movie production, but lacking experience, Rafelson and Schneider used their Hollywood connections to get the chance to produce a pilot episode for a television series. Adapting what they saw in the Beatles' movies A Hard Day's Night and Help!, and throwing in ideas of their own, Schneider and Rafelson developed The Monkees as the misadventures of an as-yet undiscovered rock band, with songs by the (originally) fictional band as soundtrack music, and as a tie-in for promotion and merchandising. The original edit of their pilot episode (filmed late in 1965, with music provided by Boyce and Hart) rated poorly with a test audience, but a re-edit scored one of the highest ratings ever, and NBC bought a season's worth of episodes. Screen Gems, the television wing of Columbia Pictures, had a music publishing department, with ties to some of the best songwriting talent in the US (including New York City's Brill Building songwriters), and were able to provide top-notch songs for the show, while Colgems Records was set up to issue records from The Monkees and other productions. When the Monkees became a hit in both television and popular music, Rafelson and Schneider in turn became famous. They used their success to achieve their initial goal of producing movies. The first, called Head, also starred the Monkees, and was intended to lift both producers and stars to a new level. Unfortunately there was a falling-out between the two sides, with only Peter Tork showing up for the first day of filming, and by the time the completed movie was ready for release, the television series had been cancelled (after two seasons and two Emmy Awards), and the Monkees phenomenon appeared to be winding down. Schneider and Rafelson distanced themselves from the band even during the shoot (pointedly playing records by other groups around the set), and promptly involved themselves in other projects, including Easy Rider.  History of BBS Productions  After producing Five Easy Pieces in 1969, the two partners took on a third partner, Stephen Blauner, naming their expanded company BBS Productions (for Bert, Bob and Steve). Blauner, who'd also been involved with the Monkees series (even getting a name-check in one episode, as a gangster), later produced New Monkees in the 1980s, under the name Straybert Productions. On December 31, 1971, BBS sold all of its outstanding shares of its stocks to Columbia Pictures.COLUMBIA PICTURES INDUSTRIES, INC. v. SCHNEIDER leagle.com July 26, 1977, Retrieved on August 31, 2014 The Last Picture Show (1971) and Hearts and Minds (1974 Academy Award winner for Best Documentary Feature) were but two distinctly iconoclastic features from BBS Productions among some of the most influential and enduring classics of the early 1970s New Hollywood era which anticipated the rise of American independent film through the 1980s and '90s. Jack Nicholson starred in three others—Five Easy Pieces (1970), A Safe Place (1971), and The King of Marvin Gardens (1972)—as well as co-wrote Drive, He Said (1971), which was his directorial debut.

His only novel, María, became one of the most notable works of the Romantic movement in Spanish-language literature. Biography His father was George Henry Isaacs, an English Jew originally from Jamaica. He first settled in Chocó, Colombia, where he made a fortune from gold mining and trade with the Caribbean. He then moved to Cali where he applied for his Colombian citizenship from Simon Bolivar and paid for it in cows. (There is a plaque on a bridge north of Bogota to commemorate this.) He married Manuela Ferrer Scarpetta, daughter of a Spanish Navy officer. He also owned two haciendas near Cali, called \\"La Manuelita\\" (named after his wife) and \\"El Paraíso\\". The latter would provide the setting for María. \\"El Paraiso\\" has been preserved as a museum, with emphasis upon its relation to the novel. Jorge Isaacs was born in Quibdo in 1837. He was first educated in Cali, then in Popayán and, finally, in Bogotá between 1848 and 1852. Isaacs returned to Santiago de Cali in 1852 without finishing his baccalaureate studies. In 1854 he fought for seven months in the Cauca Campaign against the dictatorship of General José María Melo. In 1856 Isaacs married Felisa González Umaña, who was fourteen years-old at the time and they went on to have many children. During the time of the civil wars his family went through a period of economic hardship. Isaacs tried unsuccessfully to become a merchant as his father. He then turned to literature and wrote his first poems between 1859 and 1860. During that time he also wrote several dramas of historical theme. Isaacs took arms again in 1860, this time against General Tomás Cipriano de Mosquera, and saw action in the Battle of Manizales during the Colombian Civil War. In 1861 Isaacs' father died; when the war ended Isaacs returned to Cali to take over the administration of his father's businesses, but he found them deeply in debt. This forced him to auction off two of his father's haciendas \\"La Rita\\" and \\"La Manuelita\\", which were bought by the industrialist Santiago Eder. Isaacs' economic hardship took him back to Bogotá, where he found that his literary efforts were being well received. The members of the reader's club \\"El Mosaico\\" offered to publish his poems after Isaacs read them in one of their sessions. This compilation was published under the name Poesías in 1864. That year Isaacs took a job as the supervisor of the construction of a horse- path between Buenaventura and Cali and started to write María. Around that time he also fell ill with malaria. When María was published in 1867 it became an immediate success both in Colombia and in other Latin American countries. As a consequence Isaacs became a well-known personality in Colombia and his newly found fame allowed him to start a career as journalist and politician. As a journalist he directed the newspaper La República, of moderate conservative tendencies, in which he also published some articles. As a politician he first joined the Conservative Party, but later switched to the Radical Party. In 1870 he was sent to Chile as consul general. On his return to Colombia he was actively involved in the politics of Valle del Cauca, which he represented in the Colombian Congress, and in 1876 he fought in yet another civil war. However his political career ended in 1879 after an incident where he proclaimed himself political and military leader of Antioquia in response to a conservative revolt. After his retirement from politics Isaacs published in 1881 the first canto of the poem Saulo, although he was never able to complete it. He also explored the Magdalena Department, in the north of Colombia, where he found important coal and oil deposits. Isaacs spent the last years of his life in the city of Ibagué in Tolima where was planning to write a historical novel. He died of malaria on April 17, 1895.  Literary Work  Isaacs' literary work consists of his book of poems that he published in 1864 and his only novel, María (1867), considered one of the most outstanding works of Hispanic American literature of the 19th century. The book, based on romantic experiences, has an elegiac tone, and tells the story of the tragic love of Maria and her cousin Efrain, in Valle del Cauca. Like the author, Efrain must abandon Valle del Cauca to continue his studies in Bogota. He leaves his cousin Maria in Valle del Cauca, who he is in love with, and who he has a romance with when he returns six years later. Efrain and Maria live together for some months, after which the young man has to travel to London to finish his education. When he returns, six years later, Maria has died. Some authors affirm that the character Maria was inspired by Maria Mercedes Cabal who lived in the neighborhood \\"El Paraiso\\" or \\"Paradise\\" and would later become the wife of President Manuel Maria Mallarino.Alvarez d'Orsonville,J M. Colombia literaria, reportajes, Volumen 1. Biblioteca de autores contemporáneos. Colombia literaria, reportajes, Editor Ministerio de Educación Nacional, División de Extensión Cultural, Colombia, 1956. This work has been compared with that of Chateaubriand, but also has an ominous feeling of existence similar to that of Edgar Allan Poe. The novel is known for the feeling of the landscape, as well as for the artistic quality of the writing. It can be considered precursor of the criollist books of the 1920s and 1930s. Maria was published in 1867 and had immediate success. It was translated into 31 languages. In Colombia as well as in other Latin American countries, Isaacs became a well recognized figure. This led to an expanded career as a journalist and politician. As a journalist, Isaacs directed, in 1867, the newspaper La Republica from a moderate conservative approach where they published articles of a political nature.  References  *Arciniegas, Germán.

Hayer was born in Paddi Jagir, a small village in Punjab, India. He emigrated to Canada in 1970, where he worked as a miner, teacher, truck-driver, manager of a trucking firm, and journalist before establishing a community newspaper, the Indo-Canadian Times, in 1978. He is the father of Surrey MLA Dave Hayer. Hayer initially supported a theocratic sectarian-based Sikh homeland called Khalistan in the Punjab region in India but after the continuous terrorist acts by Khalistani extremists against Sikhs and non-Sikhs in Punjab and the later bombing of Air India Flight 182 in 1985, Hayer began to speak out against violence in the Sikh separatist movement. In August 1988, he survived an attempt on his life that left him in a wheelchair. On October 15, 1995, Hayer gave an affidavit to the RCMP regarding a 1985 meeting in London, England in the offices of the Punjabi-language newspaper Des Pardes, where he overheard a conversation between Tarsem Singh Purewal, the editor of Des Pardes, and accused bomber Ajaib Singh Bagri. According to Hayer: > :\\"Bagri stayed talking to Purewal for about 1 hour during which time the > subject of the Air India Flight 182 bombing came up. Purewal bestasked Bagri > how he managed to do that. Bagri replied that they (the Babbar Khalsa) > wanted the government of India to come on their knees and give them > Khalistan. Bagri then said that if everything would have gone as planned the > plane would have blown up at Heathrow airport with no passengers on it. But > because the flight was a half hour or three quarters of an hour late, it > blew up over the ocean. Purewal then asked how he managed to have the bomb > inside the plane. Bagri said that when the device was ready, Surjan Singh > Gill was supposed to take it to the airport but when it was ready and it was > shown to him, he got scared and resigned from the Babbar Khalsa. Bagri then > suggested to Talwinder Singh Parmar that they should kill Surjan Singh Gill > but Parmar said no because that would bring suspicion on them and so they > just warned Gill not to say anything. Bagri then said that he got someone > else to take the bomb inside a suitcase to the Vancouver airport and put it > on the plane.\\" On January 24 of the following year, Purewal was killed near the offices of Des Pardes, leaving Hayer as the only other witness. Death On November 18, 1998, Hayer was shot to death, execution-style, while getting out of his car in the garage of his home in Surrey. His statement is now inadmissible as evidence in court and was later cited as a reason why the suspects in the Air India Flight 182 bombing were eventually acquitted in 2005. No one was ever charged with Tara Singh Hayer's murder. Instead of the usual sort of biographical entry, the Canadian Encyclopedia includes for him a Maclean's article of 2003. https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/sikh- editor-murdered Recognition In 1992, Hayer was honored with the Commemorative Medal for the 125th Anniversary of Canada and a Certificate of Appreciation from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). Among his other awards, he received the Journalist Award by the Municipality of Surrey for courageous and outstanding contribution to Punjabi Journalism in Canada, and the International Award of Distinction for Journalism from the International Association of Punjabi Authors and Artists. In 1995, he received the Order of British Columbia. 150px In 1999, Canadian Journalists for Free Expression renamed its Press Freedom Award the \\"Tara Singh Hayer Press Freedom Award\\" in Hayer's honour. Each year, the award is given to a Canadian journalist who, through his or her work, has made an important contribution to reinforcing and promoting the principle of freedom of the press in Canada or elsewhere. In 2000 journalist Gordon Donaldson added Hayer to the Canadian News Hall of Fame. He was the first Canadian of non-English, non-French origin to be added to the Hall.\\"Inducted into hall of fame,\\" National Post, January 6, 2001, pg. B.6. In 2000 Tara Singh Hayer’s name was added to the Canadian News Hall of Fame. He was the first Canadian of non-English, non-French origin to be added to the Hall. In 2000, Hayer was also selected as one of the International Press Institute’s 50 World Press Freedom Heroes's of the past 50 years. One of the presenters of the Award for Late Tara Singh Hayer as “World Press Freedom Hero” in May 2000 was USA Senator Ted Kennedy in Boston, USA and Award was accepted by Dave Hayer & Isabelle Martinez Hayer on behalf of the Hayer family url=http://www.asianjournal.ca/21st-commemoration-of-the-assassination-of- newspaper-editor-and-publisher-tara-singh-hayer/\\"21st Commemoration of the assassination of newspaper editor and publisher Tara Singh Hayer\\" In Loss of Faith, a book written by Vancouver Sun reporter Kim Bolan, Bolan suggests that Hayer's murder was preventable. Bolan argues that the RCMP ignored or bungled numerous clues that suggested the 1988 attempt on his life was part of a larger conspiracy.

A member of the Republican Party, he had previously served as the 46th governor of Texas from 1995 to 2000. Born into the Bush family, his father, George H. W. Bush, served as the 41st president of the United States from 1989 to 1993. Bush is the eldest son of Barbara and George H. W. Bush. As such he is the second son of a former United States President to himself become the American president, with the first being John Quincy Adams. He flew warplanes in the Texas and Alabama Air National Guard. After graduating from Yale College in 1968 and Harvard Business School in 1975, he worked in the oil industry. Bush married Laura Welch in 1977 and unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. House of Representatives shortly thereafter. He later co-owned the Texas Rangers baseball team before defeating Ann Richards in the 1994 Texas gubernatorial election. As governor, Bush successfully sponsored legislation for tort reform, increased education funding, set higher standards for schools, and reformed the criminal justice system. Bush also helped make Texas the leading producer of wind powered electricity in the United States. Bush was elected president of the United States in 2000 when he defeated Democratic incumbent Vice President Al Gore after a narrow and contested win that involved a Supreme Court decision to stop a recount in Florida. He became the fourth person to be elected president without a popular vote victory. Upon taking office, Bush pushed through a $1.3 trillion tax cut program and the No Child Left Behind Act, a major education bill. He also pushed for socially conservative efforts, such as the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act and faith- based welfare initiatives. In response to the September 11 terrorist attacks, Bush created the United States Department of Homeland Security and launched a \\"War on Terror\\" that began with the war in Afghanistan in 2001. He also signed into law the controversial Patriot Act in order to authorize surveillance of suspected terrorists. In 2003, Bush ordered an invasion of Iraq, with the administration arguing that the Saddam Hussein regime possessed an active weapons of mass destruction (WMD) program, and that the Iraqi government posed a threat to the United States. Some administration officials falsely claimed that Hussein had an operational relationship with Al-Qaeda, the perpetrators of the 9/11 attack. No stockpiles of WMDs or an active WMD program were ever found in Iraq. Bush also passed the Medicare Modernization Act, which created Medicare Part D, and funding for the AIDS relief program known as PEPFAR. In the 2004 presidential race, Bush defeated Democratic Senator John Kerry in a close election. During his second term, Bush reached multiple free trade agreements and successfully nominated John G. Roberts and Samuel Alito to the Supreme Court. He sought major changes to Social Security and immigration laws, but both efforts failed. The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq continued, and in 2007 he launched a surge of troops in Iraq. Bush received criticism from across the political spectrum for his handling of Hurricane Katrina, and the dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy. Amid this criticism, the Democratic Party regained control of Congress in the 2006 elections. In December 2007, the United States entered the Great Recession, prompting the Bush administration to obtain congressional approval for multiple economic programs intended to preserve the country's financial system, including the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) to buy toxic assets from financial institutions. Bush was among the most popular, as well as unpopular, U.S. presidents in history; he received the highest recorded approval ratings in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, but one of the lowest such ratings during the 2008 financial crisis. Bush finished his second term in office in 2009 and returned to Texas. In 2010, he published his memoir, Decision Points. His presidential library opened in 2013. His presidency has been rated as below-average in historical rankings of U.S. presidents, although his public favorability ratings have improved since leaving office. Early life and career George W. Bush with his parents, Barbara and George H. W. Bush, 1947 Bush's childhood home in Midland, Texas George Walker Bush was born on July 6, 1946, at Grace-New Haven Hospital (now Yale New Haven Hospital) in New Haven, Connecticut, while his father was a student at Yale. He was the first child of George Herbert Walker Bush and Barbara Pierce. He was raised in Midland and Houston, Texas, with four siblings, Jeb, Neil, Marvin and Dorothy. Another younger sister, Robin, died from leukemia at the age of three in 1953. His grandfather, Prescott Bush, was a U.S. Senator from Connecticut. His father was Ronald Reagan's vice president from 1981 to 1989 and the 41st U.S. president from 1989 to 1993. Bush has English and some German ancestry, along with more distant Dutch, Welsh, Irish, French, and Scottish roots. =Education= Bush in Phillips Academy's 1964 yearbook Bush attended public schools in Midland, Texas until the family moved to Houston after he had completed seventh grade. He then spent two years at The Kinkaid School, a prep school in Piney Point Village, Texas in the Houston area.Bush, then the Governor of Texas, was the commencement speaker at St. John's Academy in 1995: Bush attended high school at Phillips Academy, a boarding school in Andover, Massachusetts, where he played baseball and was the head cheerleader during his senior year. He attended Yale University from 1964 to 1968, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree in history. During this time, he was a cheerleader and a member of the Delta Kappa Epsilon, serving as the president of the fraternity during his senior year. Bush became a member of the Skull and Bones society as a senior.Bush, George W., A Charge to Keep, (1999) Bush was a rugby union player and was on Yale's 1st XV.Cain, Nick & Growden, Greg \\"Chapter 21: Ten Peculiar Facts about Rugby\\" in Rugby Union for Dummies (2nd Edition), Chichester: John Wiley and Sons, p. 297 He characterized himself as an average student.; His GPA during his first three years at Yale was 77, and he had a similar average under a nonnumeric rating system in his final year. After his application to the University of Texas School of Law was rejected, Bush entered Harvard Business School in the fall of 1973. He graduated in 1975 with an MBA degree. He is the only U.S. president to have earned an MBA.John Solomon, Bush, Harvard Business School and the Makings of a President, The New York Times (June 18, 2000). See also James P. Pfiffner, The First MBA President: George W. Bush as Public Administrator, Public Administration Review (January/February 2007), p. 7. =Family and personal life= George and Laura Bush with their daughters Jenna and Barbara, 1990 Bush was engaged to Cathryn Lee Wolfman in 1967, but the engagement did not last. Bush and Wolfman remained on good terms after the end of the relationship.Fleck, Tim (March 25, 1999). \\"The Woman George W. Bush Didn't Marry.\\" Houston Press.com. Retrieved April 4, 2019. While Bush was at a backyard barbecue in 1977, friends introduced him to Laura Welch, a schoolteacher and librarian. After a three-month courtship, she accepted his marriage proposal and they wed on November 5 of that year. The couple settled in Midland, Texas. Bush left his family's Episcopal Church to join his wife's United Methodist Church. On November 25, 1981, Laura Bush gave birth to fraternal twin daughters, Barbara and Jenna. Alcohol abuse Prior to getting married, Bush struggled with multiple episodes of alcohol abuse. In one instance on September 4, 1976, he was pulled over near his family's summer home in Kennebunkport, Maine, for driving under the influence of alcohol. He was cited for DUI, fined $150 (), and got his Maine driver's license briefly suspended. Bush said his wife has had a stabilizing effect on his life, and he attributes her influence to his 1986 decision to give up alcohol. While Governor of Texas, Bush said of his wife, \\"I saw an elegant, beautiful woman who turned out not only to be elegant and beautiful, but very smart and willing to put up with my rough edges, and I must confess has smoothed them off over time.\\" Hobbies Bush has been an avid reader throughout his adult life, preferring biographies and histories. He read 14 Lincoln biographies, and during the last three years of his presidency, read 186 books. During his presidency, Bush read the Bible daily, though at the end of his second term he said on television that he is \\"not a literalist\\" about Bible interpretation. Walt Harrington, a journalist, recalled seeing \\"books by John Fowles, F. Scott Fitzgerald, James Joyce, and Gore Vidal lying about, as well as biographies of Willa Cather and Queen Victoria\\" in his home when Bush was a Texas oilman. Other activities include cigar smoking and golf. After leaving the White House, Bush took up oil painting. =Military career= Lt. George W. Bush in the Texas Air National Guard, 1968 In May 1968, Bush was commissioned into the Texas Air National Guard. After two years of training in active-duty service, he was assigned to Houston, flying Convair F-102s with the 147th Reconnaissance Wing out of the Ellington Field Joint Reserve Base. Critics, including former Democratic National Committee Chairman Terry McAuliffe, have alleged that Bush was favorably treated due to his father's political standing as a member of the House of Representatives, citing his selection as a pilot despite his low pilot aptitude test scores and his irregular attendance. In June 2005, the United States Department of Defense released all the records of Bush's Texas Air National Guard service, which remain in its official archives. In late 1972 and early 1973, he drilled with the 187th Fighter Wing of the Alabama Air National Guard. He had moved to Montgomery, Alabama, to work on the unsuccessful U.S. Senate campaign of Republican Winton M. Blount. In 1972, Bush was suspended from flying for failure to take a scheduled physical exam.Rutenberg, Jim (May 17, 2004). He was honorably discharged from the Air Force Reserve on November 21, 1974. =Business career= President Ronald Reagan in 1988 In 1977, Bush established Arbusto Energy, a small oil exploration company, although it did not begin operations until the following year. He later changed the name to Bush Exploration. In 1984, his company merged with the larger Spectrum 7, and Bush became chairman. The company was hurt by decreased oil prices, and it folded into HKN, Inc., with Bush becoming a member of HKN's board of directors. Questions of possible insider trading involving HKN arose, but a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigation concluded that the information Bush had at the time of his stock sale was not sufficient to constitute insider trading. In April 1989, Bush arranged for a group of investors to purchase a controlling interest in the Texas Rangers baseball franchise for $89 million and invested $500,000 himself to start. He then served as managing general partner for five years. He actively led the team's projects and regularly attended its games, often choosing to sit in the open stands with fans. Bush's sale of his shares in the Rangers in 1998 brought him over $15 million from his initial $800,000 investment. =Early political involvement= George W. Bush with his father outside the White House, April 29, 1992 In 1978, Bush ran for the House of Representatives from Texas's 19th congressional district. The retiring member, George H. Mahon, had held the district for the Democratic Party since 1935. Bush's opponent, Kent Hance, portrayed him as out of touch with rural Texans, and Bush lost the election with 46.8 percent of the vote to Hance's 53.2 percent. Bush and his family moved to Washington, D.C., in 1988 to work on his father's campaign for the U.S. presidency. He served as a campaign advisor and liaison to the media, and assisted his father by campaigning across the country. In December 1991, Bush was one of seven people named by his father to run his father's 1992 presidential re-election campaign, as a \\"campaign advisor\\". The previous month, his father had asked him to tell White House chief of staff John H. Sununu to resign. Governor of Texas (1995–2000) Bush declared his candidacy for the 1994 Texas gubernatorial election at the same time his brother Jeb sought the governorship of Florida. His campaign focused on four themes: welfare reform, tort reform, crime reduction, and education improvement. Bush's campaign advisers were Karen Hughes, Joe Allbaugh, and Karl Rove. Governor Bush (right) with father, former president George H. W. Bush, and wife, Laura, in 1997 After easily winning the Republican primary, Bush faced popular Democratic incumbent Governor Ann Richards. In the course of the campaign, Bush pledged to sign a bill allowing Texans to obtain permits to carry concealed weapons. Richards had vetoed the bill, but Bush signed it into law after he became governor. According to The Atlantic Monthly, the race \\"featured a rumor that she was a lesbian, along with a rare instance of such a tactic's making it into the public record – when a regional chairman of the Bush campaign allowed himself, perhaps inadvertently, to be quoted criticizing Richards for 'appointing avowed homosexual activists' to state jobs\\". The Atlantic, and others, connected the lesbian rumor to Karl Rove, but Rove denied being involved. Bush won the general election with 53.5 percent against Richards' 45.9 percent.; Results of the 1994 gubernatorial election in Texas Bush used a budget surplus to push through Texas's largest tax-cut, $2 billion. He extended government funding for organizations providing education of the dangers of alcohol and drug use and abuse, and helping to reduce domestic violence. Critics contended that during his tenure, Texas ranked near the bottom in environmental evaluations. Supporters pointed to his efforts to raise the salaries of teachers and improve educational test scores. In 1999, Bush signed a law that required electric retailers to buy a certain amount of energy from renewable sources (RPS),SB7 Law textTexas Legislature Online, May 1999. Retrieved September 24, 2011. which helped Texas eventually become the leading producer of wind powered electricity in the U.S. In 1998, Bush won re-election with a record 69 percent of the vote. He became the first governor in Texas history to be elected to two consecutive four-year terms. In his second term, Bush promoted faith-based organizations and enjoyed high approval ratings. He proclaimed June 10, 2000, to be Jesus Day in Texas, a day on which he urged all Texans to \\"answer the call to serve those in need\\". Throughout Bush's first term, he was the focus of national attention as a potential future presidential candidate. Following his re-election, speculation soared, and within a year he decided to seek the 2000 Republican presidential nomination. Presidential campaigns =2000 presidential candidacy= Primary George W. Bush in Concord, New Hampshire, signing to be a candidate for president Incumbent Democratic president Bill Clinton was in his second and final term, and the field for nomination in both parties was wide open. Bush was the Governor of Texas in June 1999 when he announced his candidacy for president, joining John McCain, Alan Keyes, Steve Forbes, Gary Bauer, Orrin Hatch, Elizabeth Dole, Dan Quayle, Pat Buchanan, Lamar Alexander, John Kasich, and Bob Smith. Bush portrayed himself as a compassionate conservative, implying he was more centrist than other Republicans. He campaigned on a platform that included bringing integrity and honor back to the White House, increasing the size of the military, cutting taxes, improving education, and aiding minorities. By early 2000, the race had centered on Bush and McCain. Bush won the Iowa caucuses, and although he was heavily favored to win the New Hampshire primary, he trailed McCain by 19 percent and lost that primary. Despite this, Bush regained momentum effectively became the front runner after the South Carolina primary, which—according to The Boston Globe—made history for his campaign's negativity. The New York Times described it as a smear campaign. General election 2000 electoral vote results On July 25, 2000, Bush surprised some observers when he selected Dick Cheney—a former White House Chief of Staff, Congressman and Secretary of Defense—to be his running mate. At the time, Cheney was serving as head of Bush's vice presidential search committee. Soon after at the 2000 Republican National Convention, Bush and Cheney were officially nominated by the Republican Party. Bush continued to campaign across the country and touted his record as Governor of Texas. During his campaign, Bush criticized his Democratic opponent, incumbent Vice President Al Gore, over gun control and taxation. When the election returns were tallied on November 7, Bush had won 29 states, including Florida. The closeness of the Florida outcome led to a recount. The initial recount also went to Bush, but the outcome was tied up in lower courts for a month until eventually reaching the U.S. Supreme Court.George W. Bush, et al., Petitioners v. Albert Gore, Jr., et al., 531 U.S. 98 (2000). Retrieved February 12, 2010. On December 9, in the controversial Bush v. Gore ruling, the Court reversed a Florida Supreme Court decision that had ordered a third count, and stopped an ordered statewide hand recount based on the argument that the use of different standards among Florida's counties violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The machine recount showed that Bush had won the Florida vote by a margin of 537 votes out of six million casts. Although he had received 543,895 fewer individual nationwide votes than Gore, Bush won the election, receiving 271 electoral votes to Gore's 266 (Gore had actually been awarded a total of 267 votes by the states pledged to him plus the District of Columbia, but one D.C. elector abstained). Bush was the first person to win an American presidential election with fewer popular votes than another candidate since Benjamin Harrison in 1888. =2004 presidential candidacy= George W. Bush speaks at a campaign rally in 2004 2004 electoral vote results In his 2004 bid for re-election, Bush commanded broad support in the Republican Party and did not encounter a primary challenge. He appointed Ken Mehlman as campaign manager, and Karl Rove devised a political strategy. Bush and the Republican platform emphasized a strong commitment to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, support for the USA PATRIOT Act, a renewed shift in policy for constitutional amendments banning abortion and same-sex marriage,After initial comments made in March, there was no statement on the latter issue until June. reforming Social Security to create private investment accounts, creation of an ownership society, and opposing mandatory carbon emissions controls. Bush also called for the implementation of a guest worker program for immigrants, which was criticized by conservatives. The Bush campaign advertised across the U.S. against Democratic candidates, including Bush's emerging opponent, Massachusetts Senator John Kerry. Kerry and other Democrats attacked Bush on the Iraq War, and accused him of failing to stimulate the economy and job growth. The Bush campaign portrayed Kerry as a staunch liberal who would raise taxes and increase the size of government. The Bush campaign continuously criticized Kerry's seemingly contradictory statements on the war in Iraq, and argued that Kerry lacked the decisiveness and vision necessary for success in the War on Terror. Following the resignation of CIA director George Tenet in 2004, Bush nominated Porter Goss to head the agency. The White House ordered Goss to purge agency officers who were disloyal to the administration. After Goss' appointment, many of the CIA's senior agents were fired or quit. The CIA has been accused of deliberately leaking classified information to undermine the 2004 election. In the election, Bush carried 31 of 50 states, receiving a total of 286 electoral votes. He won an absolute majority of the popular vote (50.7 percent to his opponent's 48.3 percent). Bush's father George H.W. Bush was the previous president who won an absolute majority of the popular vote; he accomplished that feat in the 1988 election. Additionally, it was the first time since Herbert Hoover's election in 1928 that a Republican president was elected alongside re-elected Republican majorities in both Houses of Congress. President (2001–2009) President Bush addressing the media at the Pentagon, September 17, 2001 Bush had originally outlined an ambitious domestic agenda, but his priorities were significantly altered following the September 11 attacks. Wars were waged in Afghanistan and Iraq, and there were significant domestic debates regarding immigration, healthcare, Social Security, economic policy, and treatment of terrorist detainees. Over an eight-year period, Bush's once-high approval ratings steadily declined, while his disapproval numbers increased significantly. In 2007, the United States entered the longest post-World War II recession. =Domestic policy= Economic policy Bush took office during a period of economic recession in the wake of the bursting of the dot-com bubble.Origins of the Crash: The Great Bubble and Its Undoing, Roger Lowenstein, Penguin Books, 2004, , page 114-115 The terrorist attacks also impacted the economy. His administration increased federal government spending from $1.789 trillion to $2.983 trillion (60 percent), while revenues increased from $2.025 trillion to $2.524 trillion (from 2000 to 2008). Individual income tax revenues increased by 14 percent, corporate tax revenues by 50 percent, and customs and duties by 40 percent. Discretionary defense spending was increased by 107 percent, discretionary domestic spending by 62 percent, Medicare spending by 131 percent, social security by 51 percent, and income security spending by 130 percent. Cyclically adjusted, revenues rose by 35 percent and spending by 65 percent.Historical Budget Data, Congressional Budget Office, Tables F-1, F-3, F-7, F-9, and F-12. The increase in spending was more than under any predecessor since Lyndon B. Johnson.Spending Under President George W. Bush, Veronique de Rugy, Mercatus Center, George Mason University, Mar 2009, Table 2 The number of economic regulation governmental workers increased by 91,196. tax cut into law, June 7, 2001 The surplus in fiscal year 2000 was $237 billion—the third consecutive surplus and the largest surplus ever.Office of Management! and Budget; National Economic Council, September 27, 2000 In 2001, Bush's budget estimated that there would be a $5.6 trillion surplus over the next ten years. Facing congressional opposition, Bush held townhall style meetings across the U.S. in order to increase public support for his plan for a $1.35 trillion tax cut program—one of the largest tax cuts in U.S. history. Bush argued that unspent government funds should be returned to taxpayers, saying \\"the surplus is not the government's money. The surplus is the people's money.\\" Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan warned of a recession and Bush stated that a tax cut would stimulate the economy and create jobs. Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill, opposed some of the tax cuts on the basis that they would contribute to budget deficits and undermine Social Security. O'Neill disputes the claim, made in Bush's book Decision Points, that he never openly disagreed with him on planned tax cuts. By 2003, the economy showed signs of improvement, though job growth remained stagnant. Another tax cut was passed that year. Between 2001 and 2008, GDP grew at an average annual rate of 2.125 percent, less than for past business cycles. Bush entered office with the Dow Jones Industrial Average at 10,587, and the average peaked in October 2007 at over 14,000. When Bush left office, the average was at 7,949, one of the lowest levels of his presidency. Only four other U.S. presidents have left office with the stock market lower than when they began. Deficit and debt increases 2001–2009. Gross debt has increased over $500 billion each year since FY2003. Unemployment originally rose from 4.2 percent in January 2001 to 6.3 percent in June 2003, but subsequently dropped to 4.5 percent in July 2007. Adjusted for inflation, median household income dropped by $1,175 between 2000 and 2007, while Professor Ken Homa of Georgetown University has noted that \\"Median real after-tax household income went up two percent\\". The poverty rate increased from 11.3 percent in 2000 to 12.3 percent in 2006 after peaking at 12.7 percent in 2004. By October 2008, due to increases in spending, the national debt had risen to $11.3 trillion, an increase of over 100 percent from 2000 when the debt was only $5.6 trillion. Most debt was accumulated as a result of what became known as the \\"Bush tax cuts\\" and increased national security spending. In March 2006, then-Senator Barack Obama said when he voted against raising the debt ceiling: \\"The fact that we are here today to debate raising America's debt limit is a sign of leadership failure.\\" By the end of Bush's presidency, unemployment climbed to 7.2 percent. In December 2007, the United States entered the longest post–World War II recession, caused by a housing market correction, a subprime mortgage crisis, soaring oil prices, and a declining dollar value. In February 2008, 63,000 jobs were lost, a five-year record,Aversa, Jeannine, Employers Slash 63,000 Jobs in February, Most in 5 Years, Feeding Recession Fears\\", Associated Press, March 7, 2008. Retrieved July 11, 2008. and in November, over 500,000 jobs were lost, which marked the largest loss of jobs in the United States in 34 years. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that in the last four months of 2008, 1.9 million jobs were lost. By the end of 2008, the U.S. had lost a total of 2.6 million jobs. To aid with the situation, Bush signed a $170 billion economic stimulus package which was intended to improve the economic situation by sending tax rebate checks to many Americans and providing tax breaks for struggling businesses. The Bush administration pushed for significantly increased regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2003, and after two years, the regulations passed the House but died in the Senate. Many Republican senators, as well as influential members of the Bush Administration, feared that the agency created by these regulations would merely be mimicking the private sector's risky practices. In September 2008, the crisis became much more serious beginning with the government takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac followed by the collapse of Lehman Brothers and a federal bailout of American International Group for $85 billion. Many economists and world governments determined that the situation had become the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Additional regulation over the housing market would have been beneficial, according to former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan. Bush, meanwhile, proposed a financial rescue plan to buy back a large portion of the U.S. mortgage market. Vince Reinhardt, a former Federal Reserve economist now at the American Enterprise Institute, said \\"it would have helped for the Bush administration to empower the folks at Treasury and the Federal Reserve and the comptroller of the currency and the FDIC to look at these issues more closely\\", and additionally, that it would have helped \\"for Congress to have held hearings\\". Education and public health National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza - Implementation Plan. Document by the Home Land Security Council of the United States Bush undertook a number of educational agendas, such as increasing the funding for the National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health in his first years of office and creating education programs to strengthen the grounding in science and mathematics for American high school students. Funding for the NIH was cut in 2006, the first such cut in 36 years, due to rising inflation. President Bush signing the No Child Left Behind Act into law, January 8, 2002 One of the administration's early major initiatives was the No Child Left Behind Act, which aimed to measure and close the gap between rich and poor student performance, provide options to parents with students in low- performing schools, and target more federal funding to low-income schools. This landmark education initiative passed with broad bipartisan support, including that of Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts. It was signed into law by Bush in early 2002. Many contend that the initiative has been successful, as cited by the fact that students in the U.S. have performed significantly better on state reading and math tests since Bush signed \\"No Child Left Behind\\" into law. Critics argue that it is underfunded and that NCLBA's focus on \\"high-stakes testing\\" and quantitative outcomes is counterproductive.; In 2005, he announced a National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza to prepare the United States for a flu pandemic, which culminated in an implementation plan published by the Homeland Security Council in 2006. After being re-elected, Bush signed into law a Medicare drug benefit program that, according to Jan Crawford, resulted in \\"the greatest expansion in America's welfare state in forty years\\" – the bill's costs approached $7 trillion. In 2007, Bush opposed and vetoed State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) legislation, which was added by the Democrats onto a war funding bill and passed by Congress. The SCHIP legislation would have significantly expanded federally funded health care benefits and plans to children of some low-income families from about six million to ten million children. It was to be funded by an increase in the cigarette tax. Bush viewed the legislation as a move toward socialized health care, and asserted that the program could benefit families making as much as $83,000 per year who did not need the help. On May 21, 2008, Bush signed into law the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA). The bill aimed to protect Americans against health insurance and employment discrimination based on a person's genetic information. The issue had been debated for 13 years before it finally became law. The measure is designed to protect citizens without hindering genetic research. Social services and Social Security Following Republican efforts to pass the Medicare Act of 2003, Bush signed the bill, which included major changes to the Medicare program by providing beneficiaries with some assistance in paying for prescription drugs, while relying on private insurance for the delivery of benefits. The retired persons lobby group AARP worked with the Bush Administration on the program and gave their endorsement. Bush said the law, estimated to cost $400 billion over the first ten years, would give the elderly \\"better choices and more control over their health care\\". President Bush discussing Social Security reform at the Lake Nona YMCA Family Center in Orlando, Florida, March 18, 2005 Bush began his second term by outlining a major initiative to \\"reform\\" Social Security, which was facing record deficit projections beginning in 2005. Bush made it the centerpiece of his domestic agenda despite opposition from some in the U.S. Congress. In his 2005 State of the Union Address, Bush discussed the potential impending bankruptcy of the program and outlined his new program, which included partial privatization of the system, personal Social Security accounts, and options to permit Americans to divert a portion of their Social Security tax (FICA) into secured investments. Democrats opposed the proposal to partially privatize the system. Bush embarked on a 60-day national tour, campaigning for his initiative in media events known as \\"Conversations on Social Security\\" in an attempt to gain public support. Nevertheless, public support for the proposal declined, and the House Republican leadership decided not to put Social Security reform on the priority list for the remainder of their 2005 legislative agenda. The proposal's legislative prospects were further diminished by autumn 2005 due to political fallout from the response to Hurricane Katrina. After the Democrats gained control of both houses of Congress in the 2006 midterm elections, there was no prospect of further congressional action on the Bush proposal for the remainder of his term in office. Environmental policies Upon taking office in 2001, Bush stated his opposition to the Kyoto Protocol, an amendment to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change which seeks to impose mandatory targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, citing that the treaty exempted 80 percent of the world's population and would have cost tens of billions of dollars per year. He also cited that the Senate had voted 95–0 in 1997 on a resolution expressing its disapproval of the protocol. In May 2001, Bush signed an executive order to create an interagency task force to streamline energy projects,Bush, George W. Executive Order 13212 – Actions To Expedite Energy-Related Projects United States Department of Energy, May 18, 2001. Amendment. Retrieved September 24, 2011. and later signed two other executive orders to tackle environmental issues. In 2002, Bush announced the Clear Skies Act of 2003, which aimed at amending the Clean Air Act to reduce air pollution through the use of emissions trading programs. Many experts argued that this legislation would have weakened the original legislation by allowing higher emission rates of pollutants than were previously legal. The initiative was introduced to Congress, but failed to make it out of committee. Later in 2006, Bush declared the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands a national monument, creating the largest marine reserve to date. The Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument comprises 84 million acres (340,000 km2) and is home to 7,000 species of fish, birds, and other marine animals, many of which are specific to only those islands. The move was hailed by conservationists for \\"its foresight and leadership in protecting this incredible area\\". Bush has said he believes that global warming is real and has noted that it is a serious problem, but he asserted there is a \\"debate over whether it's man-made or naturally caused\\". The Bush Administration's stance on global warming remained controversial in the scientific and environmental communities. Critics have alleged that the administration; misinformed the public and did not do enough to reduce carbon emissions and deter global warming.; Romm calls Bush's \\"don't rush to judgment\\" and \\"we need to ask more questions\\" stance a classic delay tactic. Part 2. Energy policies In his 2006 State of the Union Address, Bush declared, \\"America is addicted to oil\\" and announced his Advanced Energy Initiative to increase energy development research. offshore oil drill ban, June 18, 2008 In his 2007 State of the Union Address, Bush renewed his pledge to work toward diminished reliance on foreign oil by reducing fossil fuel consumption and increasing alternative fuel production. Amid high gasoline prices in 2008, Bush lifted a ban on offshore drilling. However, the move was largely symbolic because there was still a federal law banning offshore drilling. Bush said, \\"This means that the only thing standing between the American people and these vast oil reserves is action from the U.S. Congress.\\" Bush had said in June 2008, \\"In the long run, the solution is to reduce demand for oil by promoting alternative energy technologies. My administration has worked with Congress to invest in gas-saving technologies like advanced batteries and hydrogen fuel cells... In the short run, the American economy will continue to rely largely on oil. And that means we need to increase supply, especially here at home. So my administration has repeatedly called on Congress to expand domestic oil production.\\" In his 2008 State of the Union Address, Bush announced that the U.S. would commit $2 billion over the next three years to a new international fund to promote clean energy technologies and fight climate change, saying, \\"Along with contributions from other countries, this fund will increase and accelerate the deployment of all forms of cleaner, more efficient technologies in developing nations like India and China, and help leverage substantial private-sector capital by making clean energy projects more financially attractive.\\" He also announced plans to reaffirm the United States' commitment to work with major economies, and, through the UN, to complete an international agreement that will slow, stop, and eventually reverse the growth of greenhouse gases; he stated, \\"This agreement will be effective only if it includes commitments by every major economy and gives none a free ride.\\" Stem cell research and first veto Federal funding for medical research involving the creation or destruction of human embryos through the Department of Health and Human Services and the National Institutes of Health has been forbidden by law since the passage of the Dickey-Wicker Amendment in 1995. Bush has said he supports adult stem cell research and has supported federal legislation that finances adult stem cell research. However, Bush did not support embryonic stem cell research. On August 9, 2001, Bush signed an executive order lifting the ban on federal funding for the 71 existing \\"lines\\" of stem cells, but the ability of these existing lines to provide an adequate medium for testing has been questioned. Testing can be done on only 12 of the original lines, and all approved lines have been cultured in contact with mouse cells, which creates safety issues that complicate development and approval of therapies from these lines. On July 19, 2006, Bush used his veto power for the first time in his presidency to veto the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act. The bill would have repealed the Dickey-Wicker Amendment, thereby permitting federal money to be used for research where stem cells are derived from the destruction of an embryo. Immigration President Bush discussing border security with Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff near El Paso, November 2005 Nearly 8 million immigrants came to the United States from 2000 to 2005, more than in any other five-year period in the nation's history. Almost half entered illegally. In 2006, Bush urged Congress to allow more than 12 million illegal immigrants to work in the United States with the creation of a \\"temporary guest-worker program\\". Bush also urged Congress to provide additional funds for border security and committed to deploying 6,000 National Guard troops to the Mexico–United States border. From May to June 2007, Bush strongly supported the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007, which was written by a bipartisan group of Senators with the active participation of the Bush administration. The bill envisioned a legalization program for illegal immigrants, with an eventual path to citizenship; establishing a guest worker program; a series of border and work site enforcement measures; a reform of the green card application process and the introduction of a point-based \\"merit\\" system for green cards; elimination of \\"chain migration\\" and of the Diversity Immigrant Visa; and other measures. Bush argued that the lack of legal status denies the protections of U.S. laws to millions of people who face dangers of poverty and exploitation, and penalizes employers despite a demand for immigrant labor. Bush contended that the proposed bill did not amount to amnesty. A heated public debate followed, which resulted in a substantial rift within the Republican Party, most conservatives opposed it because of its legalization or amnesty provisions. The bill was eventually defeated in the Senate on June 28, 2007, when a cloture motion failed on a 46–53 vote. Bush expressed disappointment upon the defeat of one of his signature domestic initiatives.; The Bush administration later proposed a series of immigration enforcement measures that do not require a change in law. On September 19, 2010, former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said that Bush offered to accept 100,000 Palestinian refugees as American citizens if a permanent settlement had been reached between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. Hurricane Katrina President Bush shaking hands with New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin after viewing the devastation of Hurricane Katrina, September 2, 2005 Hurricane Katrina struck early in Bush's second term and was one of the most damaging natural disasters in U.S. history. Katrina formed in late August during the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season and devastated much of the north-central Gulf Coast of the United States, particularly New Orleans. Bush declared a state of emergency in Louisiana on August 27 and in Mississippi and Alabama the following day.; He authorized the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to manage the disaster, but his announcement failed to spur these agencies to action. The eye of the hurricane made landfall on August 29, and New Orleans began to flood due to levee breaches; later that day, Bush declared a major disaster in Louisiana, officially authorizing FEMA to start using federal funds to assist in the recovery effort. President Bush with hurricane victims in Biloxi, September 2, 2005 On August 30, DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff declared it \\"an incident of national significance\\", triggering the first use of the newly created National Response Plan. Three days later, on September 2, National Guard troops first entered the city of New Orleans. The same day, Bush toured parts of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama and declared that the success of the recovery effort up to that point was \\"not enough\\". As the disaster in New Orleans intensified, critics charged that Bush was misrepresenting his administration's role in what they saw as a flawed response. Leaders attacked Bush for having appointed apparently incompetent leaders to positions of power at FEMA, notably Michael D. Brown; it was also argued that the federal response was limited as a result of the Iraq War and Bush himself did not act upon warnings of floods.\\"I don't think anybody anticipated the breach of the levees.\\" George W. Bush to Diane Sawyer, Good Morning America, September 1, 2005. Bush responded to mounting criticism by accepting full responsibility for the federal government's failures in its handling of the emergency. It has been argued that with Katrina, Bush passed a political tipping point from which he would not recover. Midterm dismissal of U.S. attorneys President Bush announcing his nomination of Alberto Gonzales as the next U.S. Attorney General, November 10, 2004 During Bush's second term, a controversy arose over the Justice Department's midterm dismissal of seven United States Attorneys. The White House maintained that the U.S. attorneys were fired for poor performance. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales later resigned over the issue, along with other senior members of the Justice Department. The House Judiciary Committee issued subpoenas for advisers Harriet Miers and Josh Bolten to testify regarding this matter, but Bush directed Miers and Bolten to not comply with those subpoenas, invoking his right of executive privilege. Bush maintained that all his advisers were protected under a broad executive privilege protection to receive candid advice. The Justice Department determined that the President's order was legal. Although Congressional investigations focused on whether the Justice Department and the White House were using the U.S. Attorney positions for political advantage, no official findings have been released. On March 10, 2008, the Congress filed a federal lawsuit to enforce their issued subpoenas. On July 31, 2008, a United States district court judge ruled that Bush's top advisers were not immune from Congressional subpoenas. In all, twelve Justice Department officials resigned rather than testify under oath before Congress. They included Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and his chief of staff Kyle Sampson, Gonzales' liaison to the White House Monica Goodling, aide to the president Karl Rove and his senior aide Sara Taylor. In addition, legal counsel to the president Harriet Miers and deputy chief of staff to the president Joshua Bolten were both found in contempt of Congress. In 2010, the Justice Department investigator concluded that though political considerations did play a part in as many as four of the attorney firings, the firings were \\"inappropriately political\\", but not criminal. According to the prosecutors, there was insufficient evidence to pursue prosecution for any criminal offense. =Foreign policy= Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi in 2005 President Bush stands with the presidents of the Baltic Countries: Vaira Vike-Freiberga, the President of Latvia, Arnold Rüütel, the President of Estonia, and Valdas Adamkus, the President of Lithuania; for a photo on May 7, 2005, in Riga, Latvia Countries visited by President George W. Bush during his time in office During his presidential campaign, Bush's foreign policy platform included support for stronger economic and political relationship with Latin America, especially Mexico, and a reduction of involvement in \\"nation-building\\" and other small-scale military engagements. The administration pursued a national missile defense. Bush was an advocate of China's entry into the World Trade Organization. After the September 11 attacks on New York, Bush launched the War on Terror, in which the United States military and a small international coalition invaded Afghanistan. In his 2002 State of the Union Address, Bush referred to an \\"axis of evil\\" consisting of Iraq, Iran and North Korea. In 2003, Bush then launched the invasion of Iraq, searching for weapons of mass destruction, which he described as being part of the War on Terrorism. Those invasions led to the toppling of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan and the removal of Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq.Joseph M. Siracusa, and Laurens J. Visser, \\"George W. Bush, Diplomacy, and Going to War with Iraq, 2001-2003.\\" The Journal of Diplomatic Research/Diplomasi Araştırmaları Dergisi (2019) 1#1: 1-29 online Foreign Minister of India Pranab Mukherjee with President Bush, March 2008 Bush began his second term with an emphasis on improving strained relations with European nations. He appointed long-time adviser Karen Hughes to oversee a global public relations campaign. Bush lauded the pro-democracy struggles in Georgia and Ukraine. In March 2006, Bush reversed decades of U.S. policy when he visited the Republic of India in a trip focused particularly on areas of nuclear energy, counter-terrorism co-operation; and discussions that would eventually lead to the India–United States Civil Nuclear Agreement. This was in stark contrast to the stance taken by his predecessor, Bill Clinton, whose approach and response to India after the 1998 nuclear tests has been characterized as \\"sanctions and hectoring\\". Midway through Bush's second term, questions arose whether Bush was retreating from his freedom and democracy agenda, which was highlighted in policy changes toward some oil-rich former Soviet republics in central Asia. In an address before both Houses of Congress on September 20, 2001, Bush thanked the nations of the world for their support following the September 11 attacks. He specifically thanked UK Prime Minister Tony Blair for traveling to Washington to show \\"unity of purpose with America\\", and said \\"America has no truer friend than Great Britain.\\" September 11 attacks President Bush, standing with firefighter Bob Beckwith, addressing rescue workers at Ground Zero in New York, September 14, 2001 The September 11 terrorist attacks were a major turning point in Bush's presidency. That evening, he addressed the nation from the Oval Office, promising a strong response to the attacks. He also emphasized the need for the nation to come together and comfort the families of the victims. Three days after the attacks, Bush visited Ground Zero and met with Mayor Rudy Giuliani, firefighters, police officers, and volunteers. To much applause, Bush addressed the gathering via a megaphone while standing in a heap of rubble: \\"I can hear you. The rest of the world hears you. And the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon.\\" In a September 20 speech, Bush condemned Osama bin Laden and his organization Al-Qaeda, and issued an ultimatum to the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, where bin Laden was operating, to \\"hand over the terrorists, or... share in their fate\\". War on Terrorism President Bush presenting former British Prime Minister Tony Blair with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, January 13, 2009 After September 11, Bush announced a global War on Terror. The Afghan Taliban regime was not forthcoming with Osama bin Laden, so Bush ordered the invasion of Afghanistan to overthrow the Taliban regime. In his January 29, 2002 State of the Union Address, he asserted that an \\"axis of evil\\" consisting of North Korea, Iran, and Iraq was \\"arming to threaten the peace of the world\\" and \\"pose[d] a grave and growing danger\\". The Bush Administration asserted both a right and the intention to wage preemptive war, or preventive war. This became the basis for the Bush Doctrine which weakened the unprecedented levels of international and domestic support for the United States which had followed the September 11 attacks. Dissent and criticism of Bush's leadership in the War on Terror increased as the war in Iraq continued.Lopez, George E., \\"Perils of Bush's Pre-emptive War Doctrine\\", The Indianapolis Star, October 3, 2003. In 2006, a National Intelligence Estimate concluded that the Iraq War had become the \\"cause célèbre for jihadists\\". Afghanistan invasion President Bush and President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan appearing at a joint news conference in Kabul, March 1, 2006 On October 7, 2001, U.S. and British forces initiated bombing campaigns that led to the arrival of Northern Alliance troops in Kabul on November 13. The main goals of the war were to defeat the Taliban, drive al-Qaeda out of Afghanistan, and capture key al-Qaeda leaders. In December 2001, the Pentagon reported that the Taliban had been defeated, but cautioned that the war would go on to continue weakening Taliban and al-Qaeda leaders. Later that month the UN had installed the Afghan Transitional Administration chaired by Hamid Karzai. Efforts to kill or capture al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden failed as he escaped a battle in December 2001 in the mountainous region of Tora Bora, which the Bush Administration later acknowledged to have resulted from a failure to commit enough U.S. ground troops. It was not until May 2011, two years after Bush left office, that bin Laden was killed by U.S. forces under the Obama administration. Bin Laden's successor, Ayman al- Zawahiri, remains at large. Despite the initial success in driving the Taliban from power in Kabul, by early 2003 the Taliban was regrouping, amassing new funds and recruits. The 2005 failure of Operation Red Wings showed that the Taliban had returned. In 2006, the Taliban insurgency appeared larger, fiercer and better organized than expected, with large-scale allied offensives such as Operation Mountain Thrust attaining limited success. As a result, Bush commissioned 3,500 additional troops to the country in March 2007. Iraq invasion President Bush, with Naval Flight Officer Lieutenant Ryan Philips, after landing on the USS Abraham Lincoln prior to his Mission Accomplished speech, May 1, 2003 Beginning with his January 29, 2002 State of the Union address, Bush began publicly focusing attention on Iraq, which he labeled as part of an \\"axis of evil\\" allied with terrorists and posing \\"a grave and growing danger\\" to U.S. interests through possession of weapons of mass destruction. In the latter half of 2002, CIA reports contained assertions of Saddam Hussein's intent of reconstituting nuclear weapons programs, not properly accounting for Iraqi biological and chemical weapons, and that some Iraqi missiles had a range greater than allowed by the UN sanctions. Contentions that the Bush Administration manipulated or exaggerated the threat and evidence of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction capabilities would eventually become a major point of criticism for the president.Hersh, Seymour M., \\"The Stovepipe\\", The New Yorker, October 27, 2003. In late 2002 and early 2003, Bush urged the United Nations to enforce Iraqi disarmament mandates, precipitating a diplomatic crisis. In November 2002, Hans Blix and Mohamed ElBaradei led UN weapons inspectors in Iraq, but were advised by the U.S. to depart the country four days prior to the U.S. invasion, despite their requests for more time to complete their tasks. The U.S. initially sought a UN Security Council resolution authorizing the use of military force but dropped the bid for UN approval due to vigorous opposition from several countries. The Bush administration's claim that the Iraq War was part of the War on Terror had been questioned and contested by political analysts.Williams, Shirley. \\"The seeds of Iraq's future terror\\" President Bush paying a surprise visit to Baghdad International Airport, November 27, 2003 More than 20 nations (most notably the United Kingdom), designated the \\"coalition of the willing\\" joined the United States in invading Iraq. They launched the invasion on March 20, 2003. The Iraqi military was quickly defeated. The capital, Baghdad, fell on April 9, 2003. On May 1, Bush declared the end of major combat operations in Iraq. The initial success of U.S. operations increased his popularity, but the U.S. and allied forces faced a growing insurgency led by sectarian groups; Bush's \\"Mission Accomplished\\" speech was later criticized as premature. From 2004 until 2007, the situation in Iraq deteriorated further, with some observers arguing that there was a full-scale civil war in Iraq. Bush's policies met with criticism, including demands domestically to set a timetable to withdraw troops from Iraq. The 2006 report of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group, led by James Baker, concluded that the situation in Iraq was \\"grave and deteriorating\\". While Bush admitted there were strategic mistakes made in regards to the stability of Iraq, he maintained he would not change the overall Iraq strategy. According to Iraq Body Count, some 251,000 Iraqis have been killed in the civil war following the U.S.-led invasion, including at least 163,841 civilians. President Bush with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al- Maliki, July 25, 2006 In January 2005, free, democratic elections were held in Iraq for the first time in 50 years. According to Iraqi National Security Advisor Mowaffak al-Rubaie, \\"This is the greatest day in the history of this country.\\" Bush praised the event as well, saying that the Iraqis \\"have taken rightful control of their country's destiny\\". This led to the election of Jalal Talabani as president and Nouri al-Maliki as Prime Minister of Iraq. A referendum to approve a constitution in Iraq was held in October 2005, supported by most Shiites and many Kurds. On January 10, 2007, Bush announced a surge of 21,500 more troops for Iraq, as well as a job program for Iraqis, more reconstruction proposals, and $1.2 billion (equivalent to $ billion in ) for these programs. On May 1, 2007, Bush used his second-ever veto to reject a bill setting a deadline for the withdrawal of U.S. troops, saying the debate over the conflict was \\"understandable\\" but insisting that a continued U.S. presence there was crucial. Bush \\"shoeing\\" incident in Baghdad, December 2008. In March 2008, Bush praised the Iraqi government's \\"bold decision\\" to launch the Battle of Basra against the Mahdi Army, calling it \\"a defining moment in the history of a free Iraq\\". He said he would carefully weigh recommendations from his commanding General David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker about how to proceed after the end of the military buildup in the summer of 2008. He also praised the Iraqis' legislative achievements, including a pension law, a revised de-Baathification law, a new budget, an amnesty law, and a provincial powers measure that, he said, set the stage for the Iraqi elections. By July 2008, American troop deaths had reached their lowest number since the war began, and due to increased stability in Iraq, Bush announced the withdrawal of additional American forces. During his last visit in Iraq in December 2008, Iraqi journalist Muntadhar al-Zaidi threw both of his shoes to Bush amid official press conference with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki.Bush shoe-ing worst Arab insult , BBC, 16 December 2008. Al- Zaidi yelled the strikes on Bush as \\"farewell kiss\\" and \\"for the widows and orphans and all those killed in Iraq.\\" In March 2010, Center for Public Integrity released a report that President Bush's administration had made more than 900 false pretenses in a two-year period about alleged threat of Iraq against the United States, as his rationale to engage war in Iraq.\\"Study: Bush led U.S. to war on 'false pretenses'\\" . Retrieved on March 22, 2010 Senior war crimes prosecutor Benjamin B. Ferencz has suggested that Bush should be tried in the International Criminal Court for '269 war crime charges' related to the Iraq War.Glantz, A.: \\"Bush and Saddam Should Both Stand Trial, Says Nuremberg Prosecutor \\", OneWorld U.S., August 25, 2006. URL last accessed December 12, 2006. Surveillance Following the terrorist attacks of September 11, Bush issued an executive order that authorized the President's Surveillance Program. The new directive allowed the National Security Agency to monitor communications between suspected terrorists outside the U.S. and parties within the U.S. without obtaining a warrant, which previously had been required by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. , the other provisions of the program remained highly classified. Once the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel questioned its original legal opinion that FISA did not apply in a time of war, the program was subsequently re-authorized by the President on the basis that the warrant requirements of FISA were implicitly superseded by the subsequent passage of the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists.U.S. Department of Justice White Paper on NSA Legal Authorities. The program proved to be controversial; critics of the administration and organizations such as the American Bar Association argued that it was illegal.; In August 2006, a U.S. district court judge ruled that the NSA electronic surveillance program was unconstitutional, but on July 6, 2007, that ruling was vacated by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit on the grounds that the plaintiffs lacked standing. On January 17, 2007, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales informed U.S. Senate leaders that the program would not be reauthorized by the President, but would be subjected to judicial oversight. Later in 2007, the NSA launched a replacement for the program, referred to as PRISM, which was subject to the oversight of the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. This program was not publicly revealed until reports by The Washington Post and The Guardian emerged in June 2013. Interrogation policies President Bush at the celebration of the sixtieth anniversary of victory in World War II, Red Square, Moscow Bush authorized the CIA to use waterboarding and several other \\"enhanced interrogation techniques\\" that several critics, including Barack Obama, would label as torture. Between 2002 and 2003, the CIA considered certain enhanced interrogation techniques, such as waterboarding, to be legal based on secret Justice Department legal opinions arguing that terror detainees were not protected by the Geneva Conventions' ban on torture, which was described as \\"an unconstitutional infringement of the President's authority to conduct war\\". The CIA had exercised the technique on certain key terrorist suspects under authority given to it in the Bybee Memo from the Attorney General, though that memo was later withdrawn. While not permitted by the U.S. Army Field Manuals which assert \\"that harsh interrogation tactics elicit unreliable information\\", the Bush administration believed these enhanced interrogations \\"provided critical information\\" to preserve American lives. Critics, such as former CIA officer Bob Baer, have stated that information was suspect, \\"you can get anyone to confess to anything if the torture's bad enough.\\" On October 17, 2006, Bush signed the Military Commissions Act of 2006 into law. The new rule was enacted in the wake of the Supreme Court's decision in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, , which allowed the U.S. government to prosecute unlawful enemy combatants by military commission rather than a standard trial. The law also denied the detainees access to habeas corpus and barred the torture of prisoners. The provision of the law allowed the president to determine what constitutes \\"torture\\". On March 8, 2008, Bush vetoed H.R. 2082, a bill that would have expanded congressional oversight over the intelligence community and banned the use of waterboarding as well as other forms of interrogation not permitted under the United States Army Field Manual on Human Intelligence Collector Operations, saying that \\"the bill Congress sent me would take away one of the most valuable tools in the War on Terror\\". In April 2009, the ACLU sued and won release of the secret memos that had authorized the Bush administration's interrogation tactics. One memo detailed specific interrogation tactics including a footnote that described waterboarding as torture as well as that the form of waterboarding used by the CIA was far more intense than authorized by the Justice Department. North Korea condemnation President Bush with China's president and Communist Party leader Hu Jintao, 2006 Bush publicly condemned Kim Jong-il of North Korea and identified North Korea as one of three states in an \\"axis of evil\\". He said that \\"the United States of America will not permit the world's most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world's most destructive weapons.\\" Within months, \\"both countries had walked away from their respective commitments under the U.S.–DPRK Agreed Framework of October 1994.\\" North Korea's October 9, 2006, detonation of a nuclear device further complicated Bush's foreign policy, which centered for both terms of his presidency on \\"[preventing] the terrorists and regimes who seek chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons from threatening the United States and the world\\". Bush condemned North Korea's position, reaffirmed his commitment to \\"a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula\\", and said that \\"transfer of nuclear weapons or material by North Korea to states or non-state entities would be considered a grave threat to the United States\\", for which North Korea would be held accountable. On May 7, 2007, North Korea agreed to shut down its nuclear reactors immediately pending the release of frozen funds held in a foreign bank account. This was a result of a series of three-way talks initiated by the United States and including China. On September 2, 2007, North Korea agreed to disclose and dismantle all its nuclear programs by the end of 2007. By May 2009, North Korea had restarted its nuclear program and threatened to attack South Korea. On June 22, 2010, \\"While South Korea prospers, the people of North Korea have suffered profoundly,\\" he said, adding that communism had resulted in dire poverty, mass starvation and brutal suppression. \\"In recent years,\\" he went on to say, \\"the suffering has been compounded by the leader who wasted North Korea's precious few resources on personal luxuries and nuclear weapons programs.\\" Syria sanctions President Bush with Russian president Vladimir Putin in Shanghai, October 21, 2001. Russia had cooperated with U.S. in the War on Terror. Bush expanded economic sanctions on Syria. In 2003, Bush signed the Syria Accountability Act, which expanded sanctions on Syria. In early 2007, the Treasury Department, acting on a June 2005 executive order, froze American bank accounts of Syria's Higher Institute of Applied Science and Technology, Electronics Institute, and National Standards and Calibration Laboratory. Bush's order prohibits Americans from doing business with these institutions suspected of helping spread weapons of mass destruction and being supportive of terrorism. Under separate executive orders signed by Bush in 2004 and later 2007, the Treasury Department froze the assets of two Lebanese and two Syrians, accusing them of activities to \\"undermine the legitimate political process in Lebanon\\" in November 2007. Those designated included: Assaad Halim Hardan, a member of Lebanon's parliament and current leader of the Syrian Socialist National Party; Wi'am Wahhab, a former member of Lebanon's government (Minister of the Environment) under Prime Minister Omar Karami (2004–2005); Hafiz Makhluf, a colonel and senior official in the Syrian General Intelligence Directorate and a cousin of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad; and Muhammad Nasif Khayrbik, identified as a close adviser to Assad. PEPFAR In the State of the Union address in January 2003, Bush outlined a five-year strategy for global emergency AIDS relief, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). Bush announced $15 billion for this effort which directly supported life-saving antiretroviral treatment for more than 3.2 million men, women and children worldwide. The U.S. government had spent some $44 billion on the project since 2003 (a figure that includes $7billion contributed to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, a multilateral organization), which saved an estimated five million lives. According to The New York Times correspondent Peter Baker, \\"Bush did more to stop AIDS and more to help Africa than any president before or since.\\" =Assassination attempt= On May 10, 2005, Vladimir Arutyunian, a native Georgian who was born to a family of ethnic Armenians, threw a live hand grenade toward a podium where Bush was speaking at Freedom Square in Tbilisi, Georgia. Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili was seated nearby. It landed in the crowd about from the podium after hitting a girl, but it did not detonate. Arutyunian was arrested in July 2005, confessed, was convicted and was given a life sentence in January 2006. =Other issues= President Bush, Mahmoud Abbas, and Ariel Sharon meet at the Red Sea Summit in Aqaba, Jordan, June 4, 2003 Bush signed the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty with Russia. He withdrew U.S. support for several international agreements, including the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM) with Russia.Margot Light, \\"Russian-American Relations under George W. Bush and Vladimir Putin.\\" Irish Studies in International Affairs (2008): 25-32. Bush emphasized a careful approach to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians; he denounced Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat for his support of violence, but sponsored dialogues between Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and Palestinian National Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. Bush supported Sharon's unilateral disengagement plan, and lauded the democratic elections held in Palestine after Arafat's death. In July 2001, Bush visited Pope John Paul II at Castel Gandolfo. President Bush and Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, April 1, 2008 Bush also expressed U.S. support for the defense of Taiwan following the stand-off in April 2001 with the People's Republic of China over the Hainan Island incident, when an EP-3E Aries II surveillance aircraft collided with a People's Liberation Army Air Force jet, leading to the detention of U.S. personnel. From 2003 to 2004, Bush authorized U.S. military intervention in Haiti and Liberia to protect U.S. interests. Bush condemned the militia attacks Darfur and denounced the killings in Sudan as genocide. Bush said an international peacekeeping presence was critical in Darfur, but he opposed referring the situation to the International Criminal Court. On June 10, 2007, Bush met with Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha and became the first president to visit Albania. Bush has voiced his support for the independence of Kosovo. Bush opposed South Ossetia's independence. On August 15, 2008, Bush said of Russia's invasion of the country of Georgia: \\"Bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century.\\" Bush and Abdullah of Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia is a key U.S. ally in the Middle East. Bush opened the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah. Departing from previous practice, he stood among a group of U.S. athletes rather than from a ceremonial stand or box, saying: \\"On behalf of a proud, determined, and grateful nation, I declare open the Games of Salt Lake City, celebrating the Olympic Winter Games.\\" In 2008, in the course of a good-will trip to Asia, he attended the Summer Olympics in Beijing. Bush twice invoked Section 3 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment, which allows a president to temporarily transfer the powers and duties of his office to the vice president, who then becomes acting president. On June 29, 2002, Bush underwent a colonoscopy and invoked the provision, making Vice President Cheney the acting president. Bush was awake and resumed his presidential powers after two hours. On July 21, 2007, Bush again invoked the provision in preparation for another colonoscopy. Again, Bush resumed his presidential powers after two hours. =Judicial appointments= Supreme Court Supreme Court Justice nominee John Roberts and President Bush, July 19, 2005 Supreme Court Justice nominee Samuel Alito and President Bush, October 31, 2005 On September 5, 2005, following the death of Chief Justice William Rehnquist, Bush nominated John Roberts for Chief Justice. He was confirmed by the Senate on September 29, 2005. On October 3, 2005, Bush nominated long time White House Counsel Harriet Miers to replace retiring Sandra Day O'Connor. She encountered strong opposition from both parties, who found her to be ill-prepared and uninformed on the law, Miers withdrew on October 27. On October 31, Bush nominated federal appellate judge Samuel Alito. He was confirmed on January 31, 2006.James L. Gibson, and Gregory A. Caldeira, \\"Confirmation politics and the legitimacy of the US Supreme Court: Institutional loyalty, positivity bias, and the Alito nomination.\\" American Journal of Political Science 53.1 (2009): 139-155 online. Other courts In addition to his two Supreme Court appointments, Bush appointed 61 judges to the United States courts of appeals and 261 judges to the United States district courts. Each of these numbers, along with his total of 324 judicial appointments. =Cultural and political image= Domestic =Image= thumb Gallup/USA Today Bush public opinion polling from February 2001 to January 2009 Bush's upbringing in West Texas, his accent, his vacations on his Texas ranch, and his penchant for country metaphors contribute to his folksy, American cowboy image. \\"I think people look at him and think John Wayne\\", said Piers Morgan, editor of the British Daily Mirror. Bush has been parodied by the media, comedians, and other politicians. Detractors tended to cite linguistic errors made by Bush during his public speeches, which are colloquially referred to as Bushisms. In contrast to his father—who was perceived as having troubles with an overarching unifying theme—Bush embraced larger visions and was seen as a man of larger ideas and associated huge risks. Tony Blair wrote in 2010 that the caricature of Bush as being dumb is \\"ludicrous\\" and that Bush is \\"very smart\\". In an interview with Playboy, The New York Times columnist David Brooks said Bush \\"was 60 IQ points smarter in private than he was in public. He doesn't want anybody to think he's smarter than they are, so puts on a Texas act.\\" =Job approval= Bush began his presidency with approval ratings near 50 percent. After the September 11 attacks, Bush gained an approval rating of 90 percent, maintaining 80 to 90 percent approval for four months after the attacks. It remained over 50 percent during most of his first term and then fell to as low as 19 percent in his second term. In 2000 and again in 2004, Time magazine named George W. Bush as its Person of the Year, a title awarded to someone who the editors believe \\"has done the most to influence the events of the year\\".; In May 2004, Gallup reported that 89 percent of the Republican electorate approved of Bush. However, the support waned due mostly to a minority of Republicans' frustration with him on issues of spending, illegal immigration, and Middle Eastern affairs. Within the United States armed forces, according to an unscientific survey, the president was strongly supported in the 2004 presidential elections. While 73 percent of military personnel said they would vote for Bush, 18 percent preferred his Democratic rival, John Kerry. According to Peter Feaver, a Duke University political scientist who has studied the political leanings of the U.S. military, members of the armed services supported Bush because they found him more likely than Kerry to complete the War in Iraq. Bush's approval rating went below the 50 percent mark in AP-Ipsos polling in December 2004. Thereafter, his approval ratings and approval of his handling of domestic and foreign policy issues steadily dropped. After his re-election in 2004, Bush received increasingly heated criticism from across the political spectrumBaker, Kevin, for his handling of the Iraq War, his response to Hurricane Katrina, and to the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse, NSA warrantless surveillance, the Plame affair, and Guantanamo Bay detention camp controversies. Amid this criticism, the Democratic Party regained control of Congress in the 2006 elections. Polls conducted in 2006 showed an average of 37 percent approval ratings for Bush, the lowest for any second-term president at that point in his term since Harry S. Truman in March 1951 (when Truman's approval rating was 28 percent), which contributed to what Bush called the \\"thumping\\" of the Republican Party in the 2006 mid-term elections. Throughout most of 2007, Bush's approval rating hovered in the mid-thirties; the average for his entire second term was 37 percent, according to Gallup. President Bush's approval rating with key events marked, 2001–2006 By the beginning of 2008, his final year in office, Bush's approval rating had dropped to a low of just 19 percent, largely from the loss of support among Republicans. Commenting on his low poll numbers and accusations of being \\"the worst president,\\" Bush would say, \\"I make decisions on what I think is right for the United States based upon principles. I frankly don't give a damn about the polls.\\" There were calls for Bush's impeachment, though most polls showed a plurality of Americans would not support such an action. The arguments offered for impeachment usually centered on the NSA warrantless surveillance controversy, the Bush administration's justification for the war in Iraq, and alleged violations of the Geneva Conventions. Representative Dennis Kucinich (D-OH), who had run against Bush during the 2004 presidential campaign, introduced 35 articles of impeachment on the floor of the House of Representatives against Bush on June 9, 2008, but Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) declared that impeachment was \\"off the table\\". In April 2008, Bush's disapproval ratings reached the highest ever recorded for any president in the 70-year history of the Gallup poll, with 69 percent of those polled disapproving of the job Bush was doing as president and 28 percent approving—although the majority (66 percent) of Republicans still approved of his job performance. In polls conducted in the fall, just before the 2008 election, his approval ratings remained at record lows of 19 to 20 percent, while his disapproval ratings ranged from 67 percent to as high as 75 percent. In polling conducted January 9–11, 2009, his final job approval rating by Gallup was 34 percent, which placed him on par with Jimmy Carter and Harry S. Truman, the other presidents whose final Gallup ratings measured in the low 30s (Richard Nixon's final Gallup approval rating was even lower, at 24 percent). According to a CBS News/New York Times poll conducted January 11–15, 2009, Bush's final approval rating in office was 22 percent, the lowest in American history. Foreign perceptions Bush was criticized internationally and targeted by the global anti-war and anti-globalization movements for his administration's foreign policy. Views of him within the international community—even in France, a close ally of the United States—were more negative than those of most previous American presidents. Bush was described as having especially close personal relationships with Tony Blair of the United Kingdom and Vicente Fox of Mexico, although formal relations were sometimes strained. Other leaders, such as Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan, Yoweri Museveni of Uganda, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero of Spain, and Hugo Chávez of Venezuela, openly criticized the president. Later in Bush's presidency, tensions arose between him and Vladimir Putin, which led to a cooling of their relationship. In 2006, most respondents in 18 of 21 countries surveyed around the world were found to hold an unfavorable opinion of Bush. Respondents indicated that they judged his administration as negative for world security. In 2007, the Pew Global Attitudes Project reported that during the Bush presidency, attitudes towards the United States, and towards Americans, became less favorable around the world. The Pew Research Center's 2007 Global Attitudes poll found that in only nine countries of 47 did most respondents express \\"a lot of confidence\\" or \\"some confidence\\" in Bush: Ethiopia, Ghana, India, Israel, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Mali, Nigeria, and Uganda. A March 2007 survey of Arab opinion conducted by Zogby International and the University of Maryland found that Bush was the most disliked leader in the Arab world. During a June 2007 visit to the predominantly Muslim Albania, Bush was greeted enthusiastically. Albania has a population of 2.8 million, has troops in both Iraq and Afghanistan, and the country's government is highly supportive of American foreign policy. A huge image of the President was hung in the middle of the capital city of Tirana flanked by Albanian and American flags while a local street was named after him. A shirt-sleeved statue of Bush was unveiled in Fushë-Krujë, a few kilometers northwest of Tirana. The Bush administration's support for the independence of Albanian-majority Kosovo, while endearing him to the Albanians, has troubled U.S. relations with Serbia, leading to the February 2008 torching of the U.S. embassy in Belgrade. Acknowledgments and dedications The statue of George W. Bush was erected at Fushë-Krujë, Albania near Tirana after his visit On May 7, 2005, during an official state visit to Latvia, Bush was awarded the Order of the Three Stars presented to him by President Vaira Vīķe-Freiberga. A few places outside the United States bear Bush's name. In 2005, the Tbilisi City Council voted to rename a street in honor of the U.S. president. Previously known as Melaani Drive, the street links the Georgian capital's airport with the city center and was used by Bush's motorcade during his visit four months earlier. A street in Tirana, formerly known as Rruga Punëtorët e Rilindjes, situated directly outside the Albanian Parliament, was renamed after Bush a few days before he made the first-ever visit by an American president to Albania in June 2007. In Jerusalem, a small plaza with a monument bearing his name is also dedicated to Bush.W. Bush Plaza, Jerusalem  Flickr – Condivisione di foto!. Flickr.com. June 2, 2009. Retrieved July 15, 2013. In 2012, Estonian President Toomas Hendrik Ilves awarded Bush the Order of the Cross of Terra Mariana for his work in expanding NATO. Two elementary schools are named after him: George W. Bush Elementary School of the Stockton Unified School District in Stockton, California, and George W. Bush Elementary School of the Wylie Independent School District in St. Paul, Texas, in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. Post-presidency (2009–present) =Residence= George and Laura Bush waving to a crowd of 1000 at Andrews Air Force Base before their final departure to Texas, January 20, 2009 Following the inauguration of Barack Obama, Bush and his family flew from Andrews Air Force Base to a homecoming celebration in Midland, Texas, following which they returned to their ranch in Crawford, Texas. They bought a home in the Preston Hollow neighborhood of Dallas, Texas, where they settled down. He makes regular appearances at various events throughout the Dallas/Fort Worth area, most notably when he conducted the opening coin toss at the Dallas Cowboys first game in the team's new stadium in Arlington and an April 2009 visit to a Texas Rangers game, where he thanked the people of Dallas for helping him settle in and was met with a standing ovation. He also attended every home playoff game for the Texas Rangers 2010 season and, accompanied by his father, threw out the ceremonial first pitch at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington for Game 4 of the 2010 World Series on October 31, 2010. On August 6, 2013, Bush was successfully treated for a coronary artery blockage with a stent. The blockage had been found during an annual medical examination. In reaction to the 2016 shooting of Dallas police officers, Bush stated: \\"Laura and I are heartbroken by the heinous acts of violence in our city last night. Murdering the innocent is always evil, never more so than when the lives taken belong to those who protect our families and communities.\\" =Publications and appearances= George W. Bush, then-President Obama, and Bill Clinton meeting in the Oval Office, January 16, 2010 Since leaving office, Bush has kept a relatively low profile though he has made public appearances, most notably after the release of his memoirs in 2010 and for the 10th anniversary of the September 11 attacks in 2011. In March 2009, he delivered his first post-presidency speech in Calgary, Alberta, appeared via video on The Colbert Report during which he praised U.S. troops for earning a \\"special place in American history,\\" and attended the funeral of Senator Ted Kennedy. Bush made his debut as a motivational speaker on October 26 at the \\"Get Motivated\\" seminar in Dallas. In the aftermath of the Fort Hood shooting on November 5, 2009, the Bushes paid an undisclosed visit to the survivors and the victims' families the day following the shooting, having contacted the base commander requesting that the visit be private and not involve press coverage.

During a pre-release appearance promoting the book, Bush said he considered his biggest accomplishment to be keeping \\"the country safe amid a real danger\\", and his greatest failure to be his inability to secure the passage of Social Security reform. He also made news defending his administration's enhanced interrogation techniques, specifically the waterboarding of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, saying, \\"I'd do it again to save lives.\\" In 2012, he wrote the foreword of The 4% Solution: Unleashing the Economic Growth America Needs, an economics book published by the George W. Bush Presidential Center.Jamie Stengle, Bush institute launches book on economic growth, Lubbock Avalanche- Journal, July 18, 2012Sonia Smith, George W. Bush's Armchair Economic Advice, Texas Monthly, July 17, 2012 He also presented the book at the Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas, Texas. Bush appeared on NBC's The Tonight Show with Jay Leno on November 19, 2013, along with the former First Lady, Laura Bush. When asked by Leno why he does not comment publicly about the Obama administration, Bush said, \\"I don't think it's good for the country to have a former president criticize his successor.\\" Despite this statement, Bush vocally disagreed with Obama's withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq in 2011, calling it a \\"strategic blunder\\", borrowing a term that had been used by South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham. In 2013, Bush and his wife Laura travelled with then President Obama and Michelle Obama to the memorial service of South African President and civil rights leader Nelson Mandela. There they joined former Presidents Clinton and Carter. Alongside the 2014 United States–Africa Leaders Summit, Bush, Michelle Obama, the State Department, and the George W. Bush Institute hosted a daylong forum on education and health with the spouses of the African leaders attending the summit. Bush urged African leaders to avoid discriminatory laws that make the treatment of HIV/AIDS more difficult. Bush has spoken in favor of increased global participation of women in politics and societal matters in foreign countries. On November 2, 2014, Bush spoke at an event to 200 business and civic leaders at the George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum to raise awareness for the upcoming Museum of the Bible in Washington D.C. Bush published a biography of his father, George Bush, called 41: A Portrait of My Father. It was released on November 11, 2014. In an interview published by Israel Hayom magazine on June 12, 2015, Bush said \\"boots on the ground\\" would be needed in order to defeat the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS). He added that people had said during his presidency that he should withdraw American troops from Iraq, but he chose the opposite, sending 30,000 more troops in order to defeat Al Qaeda in Iraq, and that they indeed were defeated. Bush was also asked about Iran but declined to answer, stating that any answer he gives would be interpreted as undermining Obama. Bush with then-President Barack Obama in July 2016 George W. Bush and Laura Bush with President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump in 2018 In February 2016, George W. Bush spoke and campaigned for his brother Jeb Bush in South Carolina during a rally for the Jeb Bush presidential campaign in the 2016 Republican Party presidential primaries. While Bush endorsed the Republican Party's 2012 presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, he declined to endorse the 2016 Republican nominee, Donald Trump. Also, Bush attended neither the 2012, nor the 2016 Republican National Conventions where Romney and Trump, respectively, were formally nominated. On the eve of Trump's nomination, it was reported that Bush had privately expressed concern about the current direction of the Republican Party and told a group of his former aides and advisors, \\"I'm worried that I will be the last Republican president.\\" Bush and his wife Laura did not vote for Trump in the 2016 presidential election according to a spokesperson for the Bush family, instead choosing to leave their presidential ballots blank. After the election, Bush, his father, and his brother Jeb called Trump on the phone to congratulate him on his victory. Both he and Laura attended Trump's inauguration, and images of Bush struggling to put on a rain poncho during the ceremony became an internet meme. While leaving the event, Bush allegedly described the ceremony, in particular Trump's inaugural address, as \\"some weird shit\\". In February 2017, Bush released a book of his own portraits of veterans called Portraits of Courage (full title: Portraits of Courage: A Commander in Chief's Tribute to America's Warriors). Following the white nationalist Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, Bush and his father released a joint statement condemning the violence and ideologies present at the rally; \\"America must always reject racial bigotry, anti-Semitism, and hatred in all forms. As we pray for Charlottesville, we are all reminded of the fundamental truths recorded by that city's most prominent citizen in the Declaration of Independence: we are all created equal and endowed by our Creator with unalienable rights. We know these truths to be everlasting because we have seen the decency and greatness of our country.\\" Their statement came as President Trump was facing controversy over his statements about the rally. Subsequently, Bush gave a speech in New York where he noted of the current political climate, \\"Bigotry seems emboldened. Our politics seems more vulnerable to conspiracy theories and outright fabrication.\\" He continued, \\"Bigotry in any form is blasphemy against the American creed and it means the very identity of our nation depends on the passing of civic ideals to the next generation,\\" while urging citizens to oppose threats to American democracy and be positive role models for young people. The speech was widely interpreted as a denouncement of Donald Trump and his ideologies, despite Bush not mentioning Trump by name. In April 2018, Bush and his father met in Texas with Mohammad bin Salman, the crown prince and de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia.\\"Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman toured Hollywood, Harvard and Silicon Valley on US visit\\". The Independent. April 7, 2018. In May 2019, on the 10th anniversary of former South Korean president Roh Moo-hyun's passing, George Bush visited South Korea to pay respects to Roh and gave a short eulogy. On June 1, 2020 Bush released a statement addressing the police killing of George Floyd and the nationwide reaction and protests following Floyd's death. In the statement Bush wrote that he and former first lady Laura Bush \\"are anguished by the brutal suffocation of George Floyd and disturbed by the injustice and fear that suffocate our country\\". He also elaborated on the racial injustices perpetrated by the police saying, that \\"it is time for America to examine our tragic failures\\", adding \\"Many doubt the justice of our country, and with good reason. Black people see the repeated violation of their rights without an urgent and adequate response from American institutions\\". On July 30, Both George Bush and his wife Laura Bush along with former Presidents Bill Clinton, and Barack Obama attended and spoke at the funeral for civil rights leader and congressman John Lewis at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta. At the service Bush stated in his remarks, “We live in a better and nobler country today because of John Lewis and his abiding faith in the power of God, the power of democracy and in the power of love to lift us all to a higher ground...The story that began in true isn’t ending today, nor is the work.” =Collaborations= Clinton and Bush announcing the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund to help the Haitian people after the devastating earthquake in 2010 In January 2010, at President Obama's request, Bush and Bill Clinton established the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund to raise contributions for relief and recovery efforts following the 2010 Haiti earthquake earlier that month. On May 2, 2011, President Obama called Bush, who was at a restaurant with his wife, to inform him that Osama bin Laden had been killed. The Bushes joined the Obamas in New York City to mark the tenth anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. At the Ground Zero memorial, Bush read a letter that President Abraham Lincoln wrote to a widow who had lost five sons during the Civil War. On September 7, 2017, Bush partnered with former presidents Jimmy Carter, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and Barack Obama to work with One America Appeal to help the victims of Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma in the Gulf Coast and Texas communities. Over the years, President Bush has had a good-natured friendship with Michelle Obama. \\"President Bush and I, we are forever seatmates because of protocol, and that's how we sit at all the official functions,\\" Mrs. Obama told the Today Show. \\"He's my partner in crime at every major thing where all the 'formers' gather. So we're together all the time.\\" She later added, \\"I love him to death. He's a wonderful man, he's a funny man.\\" Bush and Obama have sat next to each other at many events including the 50th anniversary of the historic civil rights march in Selma (2015), the interfaith memorial service for the victims in Dallas (2016), the opening at the National Museum of African American History and Culture (2016), and at the funerals for Nancy Reagan (2016), and John McCain (2018). Bush famously passed mints to Mrs. Obama during the McCain funeral in September 2018 and gave them to her again during the funeral of his father in December 2018. =Art= After serving as president, Bush began painting as a hobby after reading Winston Churchill's essay \\"Painting as a Pastime.\\" Subjects have included people, dogs, and still life. He has also painted self-portraits and portraits of world leaders, including Vladimir Putin and Tony Blair. In February 2017, Bush released a book of portraits of veterans, Portraits of Courage. The net proceeds from his book are donated to the George W. Bush Presidential Center. In May 2019, on the 10th anniversary of former South Korean president Roh Moo-hyun's passing, George Bush drew a portrait of Roh to give to his family.

Bush Presidential Center on the campus of Southern Methodist University (SMU) located in University Park, Texas President Bush's legacy continues to develop today. Supporters credit Bush's counterterrorism policies with preventing another major terrorist attack from occurring in the U.S. after 9/11 and also praise individual policies such as the Medicare prescription drug benefit and the AIDS relief program known as PEPFAR. Critics often point to his handling of the Iraq War, specifically the failure to find weapons of mass destruction, that were the main rationale behind the initial invasion—as well as his handling of tax policy, Hurricane Katrina, climate change and the 2008 financial crisis—as proof that George W. Bush was unfit to be president.Chait, Jonathan. \\"Donald Trump Is Just George W. Bush But Racist.\\" NYMag. April 14, 2017. Several historians and commentators hold that Bush was one of the most consequential presidents in American history. Princeton University scholar Julian Zelizer described Bush's presidency as a \\"transformative\\" one, and said that \\"some people hate him, some people love him, but I do think he'll have a much more substantive perception as time goes on\\". Bryon Williams of The Huffington Post referred to Bush as \\"the most noteworthy president since FDR\\" and said the Patriot Act \\"increased authority of the executive branch at the expense of judicial opinions about when searches and seizures are reasonable\\" as evidence. Bush's administration presided over the largest tax cuts since the presidency of Ronald Reagan, and his homeland security reforms proved to be the most significant expansion of the federal government since the Great Society. Much of these policies have endured in the administrations of his two immediate successors, Barack Obama and Donald Trump. =Reception= The George W. Bush presidency has been ranked among the worst in surveys of presidential scholars published in the late 2000s and 2010s. A 2010 Siena Research Institute survey of the opinions of historians, political scientists, and presidential scholars ranked him 39th out of 43 presidents. The survey respondents gave President Bush low ratings on his handling of the U.S. economy, communication, ability to compromise, foreign policy accomplishments, and intelligence. Bush said in 2013, \\"Ultimately history will judge the decisions I made, and I won't be around because it will take time for the objective historians to show up. So I am pretty comfortable with it. I did what I did.\\" Among the public, his reputation has improved since his presidency ended in 2009. In February 2012, Gallup reported that \\"Americans still rate George W. Bush among the worst presidents, though their views have become more positive in the three years since he left office.\\" Gallup had earlier noted that Bush's favorability ratings in public opinion surveys had begun to rise a year after he had left office, from 40 percent in January 2009 and 35 percent in March 2009, to 45 percent in July 2010, a period during which he had remained largely out of the news. A poll conducted in June 2013 marked the first time recorded by Gallup where his ratings have been more positive than negative, with 49 percent viewing him favorably compared to 46 percent unfavorably. Other pollsters have noted similar trends of slight improvement in Bush's personal favorability since the end of his presidency. In April 2013, Bush's approval rating stood at 47 percent approval and 50 percent disapproval in a poll jointly conducted for The Washington Post and ABC, his highest approval rating since December 2005. Bush had achieved notable gains among seniors, non-college whites, and moderate and conservative Democrats since leaving office, although majorities disapproved of his handling of the economy (53 percent) and the Iraq War (57 percent). His 47 percent approval rating was equal to that of President Obama's in the same polling period. A CNN poll conducted that same month found that 55 percent of Americans said Bush's presidency had been a failure, with opinions divided along party lines, and 43 percent of independents calling it a success. Bush's public image saw greater improvement in 2017, with a YouGov survey showing 51 percent of favorability from Democrats. A 2018 CNN poll subsequently found that 61 percent of respondents held of a favorable view of Bush, an increase of 9 points from 2015. The improvement has been interpreted as Democrats viewing him more favorably in response to Donald Trump's presidency, an assessment that has also been expressed by Bush himself.

Similar to echolalia, the involuntary repetition of sounds and language, it is one of the echophenomena (\\"automatic imitative actions without explicit awareness\\"). It has long been recognized as a core feature of Tourette syndrome, and is considered a complex tic, but it also occurs in autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia and catatonia, aphasia, and disorders involving the startle reflex such as latah. Echopraxia has also been observed in individuals with frontal lobe damage, epilepsy, dementia and autoimmune disorders; the causes of and the link between echopraxia and these disorders is undetermined. The etymology of the term is from Ancient Greek: \\"ἠχώ (ēkhō) from ἠχή (ēkhē \\"sound\\") and \\"πρᾶξις (praksis, \\"action, activity, practice)\\". Characteristics Echopraxia is the involuntary mirroring of an observed action. Imitated actions can range from simple motor tasks such as picking up a phone to violent actions such as hitting another person. Imitative learning and emulation of physical and verbal actions are critical to early development (up to the age of two or three), but when these behaviors become reactions rather than a means for learning, they are considered echophenomena (copying behaviors). Causes and pathophysiology Echopraxia is a typical symptom of Tourette syndrome but causes are not well elucidated. Frontal lobe animation One theoretical cause subject to ongoing debate surrounds the role of the mirror neuron system (MNS), a group of neurons in the inferior frontal gyrus (F5 region) of the brain that may influence imitative behaviors, but no widely accepted neural or computational models have been put forward to describe how mirror neuron activity supports cognitive functions such as imitation. Diagnosis There is no formal test for diagnosing echopraxia. It is easier to distinguish in individuals over the age of five, because younger children frequently imitate others' actions. Imitation can be divided into two types: imitative learning and automatic imitation. Imitative learning occurs when a person consciously mimics an observed action in order to learn the mechanism behind that action and perform it themselves. Babies begin copying movements soon after birth; this behavior begins to diminish around the age of three. Before that, it is not possible to diagnose echopraxia, because it is difficult to differentiate between imitative learning and automatic imitation. If the imitative behavior continues beyond infanthood, it may be considered echopraxia. Echopraxia may be more easily distinguished in older individuals, because their behaviors in relation to prior behaviors can be differentiated. They report feeling an uncontrollable urge to perform an action after seeing it being performed. Automatic behavior is occasionally present in healthy adults (for example, when a person observes someone yawning, he or she may do the same); these behaviors are not considered echopraxia.

William was the only child of William I, Earl of Ross and his wife Jean Comyn, daughter of William, Earl of Buchan. He succeeded to the earldom on the death of his father in 1274. In 1284 he joined with other Scottish noblemen who acknowledged Margaret, Maid of Norway as the heir to the unfortunate Alexander III.Foedera, p228 Following Margaret's death, he sided alternately with the Scottish and English interests. In 1291 he paid homage to Edward I of England at Berwick recognising him as overlord of Scotland. He was chosen as an auditor at the trial between John Balliol and Robert Bruce, when they competed before Edward to decide who would take the throne of Scotland. William was one of the leaders of the Scottish army at the Battle of Dunbar in 1296, when Edward invaded Scotland to punish John Balliol for refusing to support the English invasion of France. After the Scottish defeat, he was captured by the English and sent to the Tower of London, where he remained until September 1303, when an order was issued for his escort to Scotland. He reached Perth in December, and stayed there with Edward, Prince of Wales until he was sent home in February. Later in 1304 he was with King Edward at Dunfermline, who bestowed upon him a horse, armour, and other presents, as well as appointing him Warden beyond the Spey. In 1306, Robert's wife Elizabeth, his daughter Marjorie, and other Bruce supporters took refuge from the advancing English army in the chapel of St Duthac at Tain in Ross, while on their way to the safety of Orkney. However, William violated the sanctuary, took them prisoner, and handed them over to the English. They were sent as prisoners to England where two of the women were caged outdoors for four years, and the women were not liberated until 1314.Education Scotland, \\"Elizabeth de Burgh and Marjorie Bruce\\" , Education Scotland (a Scottish government agency, \\"the national body in Scotland for supporting quality and improvement in learning and teaching\\").

He found himself being attacked by King Robert in the south, and by Lachlann Mac Ruaidhrí in the west. In 1308, Edward II wrote to him thanking him for his services and requesting further aid, but when Bruce came north, William submitted to him. William later wrote to Edward apologising for the submission to King Robert, and requesting help to repel his invasion of Ross. Nevertheless, William is one of the eight earls whose name appears on the Declaration of Arbroath of 1320, which was sent to the Pope requesting he recognise Scotland's independence, which he did. William died three years later, at Delny in Ross. He had married a lady named Euphemia, who was likely the daughter of Sir Hugh de Berkeley, Justiciar of Lothian.John P.

He lives with his wife and four children deep in the rainforest in Secoya territory, close to the Aguarico River. From an early age, he drew the rainforest with his fingers in the sand and later worked with black ink on paper. The young man who has captured the attention of the art world was first encouraged in his efforts by Orville and Mary Johnson, Wycliffe Bible Translators working in his village.Hugh Steven, biographer for Wycliffe Bible Translators The discovery of colored pencils at the evangelical missionary school he later attended enabled him to further develop his talent.Ramón Piaguaje: \\"La selva es un buen sitio para el arte\\" In 1993, an American anthropologist, William Vickers, who had been studying the Secoya Indians for many years, spotted him drawing and recognised the quality of his work. He gave him some tubes of oil paints and encouraged him to paint in colour, something which Ramón Piaguaje had been unaware it was possible to do. He spent months experimenting with the colours he had, attempting to replicate the extraordinary range of colours to be found in the trees, flowers, and wildlife around him. Within a year he had developed an astonishing eye and memory for colour. William Vickers helped to organise an exhibition of his work at the Catholic University in Quito, Ecuador. His painting \\"Eternal Amazon\\" was selected from over 22,000 entries by professionals and amateur artists from 51 countries won the first prize of the United Nations Millennium Art Exhibition in aid of UNICEF - \\"Our World in the Year 2000.\\"Our World in the Year 2000: The Winsor & Newton Worldwide Millennium Painting Competition When the elderly missionary couple, Orville and Mary Johnson, heard about the exhibit at the United Nations, they decided to surprise the South American artist. They entered the exhibition hall and found Ramon surrounded by many people. As he looked beyond his admiring fans, he saw the Johnsons and began to cry. They hugged and wept for several moments. In Secoya, Ramon repeated over and over to Orville and Mary, \\"You are the ones that should be honored, not me…for you came to give us the gospel, and I believe that is why I now can be here.\\" Hugh Steven, biographer for Wycliffe Bible Translators Since then, he has met the Prince of Wales, who was patron of the event, and the secretary general of the United Nations Kofi Annan, and \\"Eternal Amazon\\" has been viewed by ambassadors, artists, dignitaries, and members of the press and public from around the world. When he won he commented: ‘I entered the competition because I wanted to deliver a message to the rest of the world about the importance of keeping this “lung of the world” free from pollution and destruction. I paint what I see and where I live. It is a beautiful, positive, and peaceful way of showing my world. The forest is all we have. I hope that when people see my picture, they do not just look at my art, but realise that it is their obligation to help to preserve the Amazon rainforest. My tribe, the Secoyas, have lived in these forests for thousands of years and to see a tree fall is like seeing a loved one die.
