It is called multifocal because it can appear in different parts of the body, primarily bones, and osteomyelitis because it is very similar to that disease, although CRMO appears to be without any infection. The definition of CRMO is evolving. Many doctors and articles described CRMO as an autoimmune disease that has symptoms similar to osteomyelitis, but without the infection. Some doctors thought CRMO was related to SAPHO syndrome. Research now classifies CRMO as an inherited autoinflammatory disease but have yet to isolate the exact gene or other causes responsible for it. Classification Due to its inflammatory nature, its recurrent outbreaks, and its lack of any known pathogen, CRMO has been reclassified as an autoinflammatory disease. This particular classification encompasses both hereditary types (familial Mediterranean fever, mevalonate kinase deficiency, TNF receptor associated periodic syndrome, cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome, Blau syndrome, pyogenic sterile arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum and acne syndrome, CRMO) and multifactorial disorders (Crohn's and Beh√ßet's diseases). CRMO is no longer considered an autoimmune but rather an inherited, autoinflammatory disease. Symptoms The main symptom is pain. Diagnosis CRMO/CNO is a diagnosis of exclusion. This means that other diseases must be ruled out before the diagnosis can be made. Generally, many tests are required, such as blood tests, x-rays, bone scans, MRI and often a bone biopsy. Treatment CRMO/CNO is generally treated by a specialist doctor (paediatric rheumatologist) who has experience with patients with CRMO/CNO. Goals of treatment of CRMO/CNO include: * Reduce inflammation * Prevent bone damage and bone deformities * Decrease pain CRMO/CNO is different for each patient. Not every child responds to every treatment. Your doctor may need to try several medications before finding the one that works for your child. In severe cases, doctors may combine medications to treat the disease. Your doctor will work with you and your child to help find the best treatment. For some CRMO/CNO patients, the disease can be managed with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). NSAIDs are the first line treatment. However, if NSAIDs are not effective, or if your child does not tolerate NSAIDs well, second line treatments are available. First line treatments include Naproxen (Aleve), Celecoxib (Celebrex) Meloxicam (Mobic), Piroxicam (Feldene), Indomethacin (Indocin), Diclofenac (Voltaren). Second line treatments include corticosteroids (Prednisone/Prednisolone), Methotrexate (Otrexup, Rasuvo, Trexall), Sulfasalazine (Azulfidine), Pamidronate (Aredia), Zolendronic Acid (Zometa), Adalimumab (Humira), Etanercept (Enbrel), Infliximab (Remicade). These medications are also used in children with other inflammatory and/or bone conditions. Side effects may occur while taking these medications. Prognosis Prognosis will depend on your child's individual disease and response to treatment. It is best to discuss the prognosis with your child's pediatric rheumatologist. Cause Some specialists believe they have discovered a link between CRMO with a rare allele of marker D18S60, resulting in a haplotype relative risk (HRR) of 18. Other experts found that \\"mutations in LPIN2 cause a syndromic form of chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis known as Majeed syndrome, while mutations in pstpip2 cause a murine form of the disorder. The roles played by LPIN2 and the human homolog of pstpip2, PSTPIP2, in the cause of chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis are uncertain. The professional theories seem to be moving in the direction of an inherited gene. Epidemiology CRMO was once considered strictly a childhood disease, but adults have been diagnosed with it. The affected tends to range from 4 to 14 years old, with 10 as the median age. As stated above, CRMO occurs 1:1,000,000 and primarily in girls with a 5:1 ratio. That means out of six million, there will probably be 5 girls and 1 boy with the condition. =Majeed syndrome= Majeed syndrome is an autoinflammatory disorder consisting of CRMO, congenital dyserythropoietic anemia, and neutrophilic dermatosis. To date, two unrelated families with Majeed syndrome have been reported. Mutations in LPIN2 have been found in both families. Here we report a third consanguineous family with Majeed syndrome with a novel mutation. The patient, a 3-year-old Arabic girl, had hepatosplenomegaly and anemia as a neonate. At age 15 months, she developed recurrent episodes of fever and multifocal osteomyelitis. In addition, bone marrow aspiration demonstrated significant dyserythropoiesis (defective red cell formation), suggesting Majeed syndrome. Coding sequences and splice sites of LPIN2 were sequenced in the patient and her mother. A homozygous single-basepair change was detected in the donor splice site of exon 17 (c.2327+1G>C) in the patient; her mother was heterozygous at this site. These data confirm the role of LPIN2 mutations in the cause of Majeed syndrome. Congenital dyserythropoietic anemia and chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis, uncommon childhood diseases of unknown cause, occurred in three children (two brothers and a female cousin). Their parents are consanguineous, and the clinical course of their illness was similar. The two brothers also had Sweet syndrome. The association of Sweet syndrome with chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis and congenital dyserythropoietic anemia in this family suggests that these rare conditions may be interrelated.

Homotaurine has also shown anticonvulsant activities, reduction in skeletal muscle tonus, and hypothermic activity. Homotaurine has been reported as a GABA antagonist, as well as a GABA agonist.Armen H. Tashjian and Ehrin J. Armstrong. Principles of Pharmacology: The Pathophysiologic Basis of Drug Therapy. Edited by David E. Golan. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2011 . Page 308 In vitro studies have found that homotaurine is a GABAA partial agonist as well as a GABAB receptor partial agonist with low efficacy, becoming an antagonist and displacing the full agonists GABA and baclofen at this receptor. In a study in rats, homotaurine reversed the catatonia induced by baclofen (the prototypical GABAB agonist), and was able to produce analgesia via the GABAB receptor, an effect that was abolished when CGP-35348, a GABAB receptor antagonist was applied. One study in rats showed that homotaurine suppressed ethanol-stimulated dopamine release, as well as ethanol intake and preference in rats in a way similar to the N-acetyl derivative of homotaurine, acamprosate. Acamprosate was approved by the FDA in 2004 to treat alcohol dependence.

Early life and career Tai-Shan Schierenberg was born in England in 1962, the eldest of three sons to a very young Chinese mother and a German painter. As a child, he spent the first years of his life with his grandparents in Malaysia but was eventually returned to his London-based parents for the beginning of primary school.. Being taken on frequent visits to the London Museums or art galleries made him familiar with painting of all realms and ages, while drawing soon became the child's favourite activity. After extensive travels to the places of Antiquity in Greece and Asia Minor, the family settled in the Black Forest and, in pursuit of a more ecologically centred life, did some subsistence farming, while the boy, by now eleven years old, started his secondary education under the auspices of a Jesuit run grammar school nearby. In his mid-teens, the first cautious steps towards oil painting were undertaken. At the age of seventeen and with his secondary education completed, he left home, reconnoitred Frankfurt and Amsterdam, drifted over to Paris, where he predominantly spent his time drawing from life at the venerable Acad√©mie de la Grande Chaumi√®re. Schierenberg eventually returned to London, where he has remained ever since.

She met Blair in 1914 and they developed a shared interest in poetry, but she lost touch with him after he departed for Burma in 1922, and later she disputed Blair's writings about his own childhood. The two were in contact again near the end of Blair's life. She gave an account of the relationship in her memoir Eric & Us, published in 1974. Biography =Relationship with Eric Blair= Buddicom was born in Plymouth to Robert Arthur Buddicom, of Ticklerton Court, Church Stretton, Shropshire,\\"Buddicom of Ticklerton Court\\", Burke's Landed Gentry, 1952 which was left to his sister Lillian Buddicom after his father's death in 1922. Buddicom moved with the rest of her family to Shiplake, Oxfordshire where she first met Eric Blair in the summer of 1914 when he was standing on his head in a field at the bottom of the Buddicoms' garden. When asked why, he replied, \\"You are noticed more if you stand on your head than if you are the right way up.\\" From that summer afternoon, Eric and his younger sister Avril became very close friends with Buddicom and her younger brother and sister, Prosper (Robert Prosper Gedye Buddicom, 1904-1968) and Guinever (Guinever Laura Olivia Norsworthy Buddicom; 3 February 1907Eric & Us: A Remembrance of George Orwell, Jacintha Buddicom, Frewin, 1974, pg 5 \\\\- 4 February 2002UK, Select Cemetery Registers, 1873-2014, Ancestry.co.uk). With Prosper and Guiny, Blair enjoyed shooting, fishing and birdwatching, while with Jacintha he preferred to read and write poetry and dream of future intellectual adventures. At this time he told Buddicom that at some point he might write a book in a style similar to that of H. G. Wells's A Modern Utopia, although Nineteen Eighty-Four turned out to be far different from Buddicom‚Äôs expectations. Buddicom was educated at Oxford High School, but neither she nor Blair achieved their shared dream of going to Oxford University. The couple lost touch shortly after Blair went to Burma. She became unsympathetic at the letters he wrote complaining about his life, and stopped writing back. The reason for this is explained in the Postscript edition [2006] of Eric & Us, which suggests that the then eighteen-year-old Blair may have attempted a botched seduction involving Buddicom shortly before his departure to Burma.Kathryn Hughes, \\"Such were the joys\\", The Guardian, 17 February 2007 In 1927, Buddicom gave birth to a daughter as a result of an unsuccessful affair, and gave the baby away for a childless aunt to adopt. When Blair, who never knew of Buddicom's daughter, came back from Burma on leave that year, he assumed that she was away from the Buddicom family home because she was angry with him and they did not make contact again. She then began a 30-year affair with a peer of the Realm. It was not until 1949, a few months before Orwell‚Äôs death, that Buddicom realised that George Orwell, the author of Animal Farm, was her childhood friend Eric Blair. They exchanged a few letters and phone conversations and he was eager for her to come and see him, \\"to talk about my little son Richard\\", but it was too late by then, and a few months later, after her mother's death, she slipped unnoticed into Orwell‚Äôs funeral service at Christ Church, Marylebone in 1950. Buddicom was at great pains to dispute the picture of childhood misery described by Orwell in his essay \\"Such, Such Were the Joys\\". She claimed that \\"he was a specially happy child\\", writing \\"There was no harping on inferiority and poverty by Eric then.... The picture painted of a wretched little neurotic, snivelling miserably before a swarm of swanking bullies, suspecting that he smelt, just was not Eric at all.\\" And she made a systematic investigation of many of his claims and allegations in order to disprove them. She described him as an aloof and undemonstrative boy, and recalled him as being self-sufficient with no need of a wide circle of friends. After her death, her cousin Dione Venables, who was left the copyrights for the book and a quantity of family papers, did much in-depth research, and in 2006 published an updated version of Eric & Us, including all the previously unknown material about Blair's and Buddicom's relationship in a most revealing postscript. =Poetry and other activities= Buddicom lived with her sister for many years. She designed two Shropshire houses, and two motor-caravans for which she won prizes.\\"Remembering George Orwell\\", review of Eric & Us, Leslie Frewin Publishers, London 1974 She wrote a book of poetry published in America, and her Cat Poems were published in 1972, two years before Eric & Us appeared.

History Recognizing the cosmological importance of the darkness of the night sky (Olbers' paradox) and the first speculations on an extragalactic background light dates back to the first half of the 19th century. Despite its importance, the first attempts were made only in the 1950-60s to derive the value of the visual background due to galaxies, at that time based on the integrated starlight of these stellar systems. In the 1960s the absorption of starlight by dust was already taken into account, but without considering the re-emission of this absorbed energy in the infrared. At that time Jim Peebles pointed out, that in a Big Bang-created Universe there must have been a cosmic infrared background (CIB) ‚Äì different from the cosmic microwave background ‚Äì that can account for the formation and evolution of stars and galaxies. In order to produce today's metallicity, early galaxies must have been significantly more powerful than they are today. In the early CIB models the absorption of starlight was neglected, therefore in these models the CIB peaked between 1‚Äì10Œºm wavelengths. These early models have already shown correctly that the CIB was most probably fainter than its foregrounds, and so it was very difficult to observe. Later the discovery and observations of high luminosity infrared galaxies in the vicinity of the Milky Way showed, that the peak of the CIB is most likely at longer wavelengths (around 50Œºm), and its full power could be ~1‚àí10% of that of the CMB. As Martin Harwit emphasized, the CIB is very important in the understanding of some special astronomical objects, like quasars or ultraluminous infrared galaxies, which are very bright in the infrared. He also pointed out, that the CIB cause a significant attenuation for very high energy electrons, protons and gamma-rays of the cosmic radiation through inverse Compton scattering, photopion and electron- positron pair production. In the early 1980s there were only upper limits available for the CIB. The real observations of the CIB began after the era of astronomical satellites working in the infrared, started by the Infrared Astronomy Satellite (IRAS), and followed by the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE), the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) and by the Spitzer Space Telescope. Exploration of the CIB was continued by the Herschel Space Observatory, launched in 2009. The Spitzer wide area surveys have detected anisotropies in the CIB.Taylor, Kate. \\"NASA spots glow of universe's first objects.\\" TG Daily, June 8, 2012. A summary on the history of CIB research can be found in the review papers by M.G. Hauser and E. Dwek (2001) and A. Kashlinsky (2005).  Origin of the cosmic infrared background  One of the most important questions about the CIB is the source of its energy. In the early models the CIB was built up from the redshifted spectra of the galaxies found in our cosmic neighborhood. However, these simple models could not reproduce the observed features of the CIB. In the baryonic material of the Universe there are two sources of large amounts of energy: nuclear fusion and gravitation. Nuclear fusion takes place inside the stars, and we can really see this light redshifted: this is the main source of the cosmic ultraviolet- and visual background. However, a significant amount of this starlight is not observed directly. Dust in the host galaxies can absorb it and re-emit it in the infrared, contributing to the CIB. Although most of today's galaxies contain little dust (e.g. elliptical galaxies are practically dustless), there are some special stellar systems even in our vicinity which are extremely bright in the infrared and at the same time faint (often almost invisible) in the optical. These ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) are just in a very active star formation period: they are just in a collision or in a merge with another galaxy. In the optical this is hidden by the huge amount of dust, and the galaxy is bright in the infrared due to the same reason. Galaxy collisions and mergers were more frequent in the cosmic past: the global star formation rate of the Universe peaked around redshift z = 1...2, and was 10 to 50 times the average value today. These galaxies in the z = 1...2 redshift range give 50 to 70 percent of the full brightness of the CIB. Another important component of the CIB is the infrared emission by quasars. In these systems most of the gravitational potential energy of the matter falling into the central black hole is converted into X-rays, which would escape unless they are absorbed by the dust torus of the accretion disc. This absorbed light is again re-emitted in the infrared, and in total gives about 20‚Äì30% of the full power of the CIB; however at some specific wavelengths this is the dominant source of CIB energy. A hitherto unrecognised population of intergalactic stars have been shown to explain the CIB as well as the other elements of the diffuse extragalactic background radiation. If intergalactic stars were to account for all of the background anisotropy, it would require a very large population, but this is not excluded by observations and could in fact also explain a fair part of the dark matter problem as well. Foregrounds The most important foreground components of the CIB are the following: *Zodiacal emission: the thermal emission of microscopic dust particles in the Solar System (from near- to mid-infrared) *Thermal emission of small asteroids in the Solar System (from near- to mid-infrared) *Galactic cirrus emission (far- infrared) *Faint galactic stars (in the near-infrared, Œª<20Œºm) *Infrared emission of intracluster dust in the Local Group *The cosmic microwave background - although physically it is not a \\"foreground\\" - is also considered as an important contaminating source of emission at very long infrared wavelengths (Œª>300Œºm) These components must be separated for a clear CIB detection.  Observation of the cosmic infrared background  The detection of the CIB is both observationally and astrophysically very challenging. It has a very few characteristics which can be used to separate it from the foregrounds. One major point is, that the CIB must be isotropic, i.e. one has to measure the same CIB value all over the sky. It also lacks suspicious spectral features, since the final shape of its spectrum is the sum of the spectra of sources in the line of sight at various redshifts. = Direct detection = Direct measurements are simple, but very difficult. One just has to measure the total incoming power, and determine the contribution of each sky background component. The measurement has to be repeated in many directions to determine the contribution of the foregrounds. After the removal of all other components the remaining power ‚Äì if it is the same constant value in any direction ‚Äì is the CIB at that specific wavelength. In practice, one needs an instrument that is able to perform absolute photometry, i.e. it has some mechanism to fully block incoming light for an accurate zero level determination (cold shutter). Since the instrument parts, including the shutter, have non-zero temperatures and emit in the infrared, this is a very difficult task. The first, and still the most extensive, direct CIB measurements were performed by the DIRBE instrument of the COBE satellite. After the removal of the precisely determined zodiacal emission contribution (which was based on the measured annual variation) the remaining power at longer infrared wavelength contained basically two components: the CIB and the Galactic cirrus emission. The infrared surface brightness of the Galactic cirrus must correlate with the neutral hydrogen column densities, since they originate from the same, low-density structure. After the removal of the HI- correlated part, the remaining surface brightness was identified as the cosmic infrared background at 60, 100, 140, and 240Œºm. At shorter wavelengths the CIB level could not be correctly determined. Later, short-wavelength DIRBE measurements at 2.2 and 3.5Œº were combined with the Two Micron Sky Survey (2MASS) source count data, and this led to the detection of the CIB at these two wavelengths. = Fluctuation studies = Since the CIB is an accumulated light of individual sources there is always a somewhat different number of sources in different directions in the field of view of the observer. This cause a variation (fluctuation) in the total amount of observed incoming flux among the different line of sights. These fluctuations are traditionally described by the two dimensional autocorrelation function, or by the corresponding Fourier power spectrum. The detection of fluctuations is easier than the direct CIB measurements, since one does not need to determine the absolute photometric zero point ‚Äì fluctuations can be derived from differential measurements. On the other hand, fluctuations do not provide an immediate information on the CIB brightness. The measured fluctuation amplitudes either has to be confronted with a CIB model that has a prediction for the fluctuation / absolute level ratio, or it has to be compared with integrated differential light levels of source counts at the same wavelength. The power spectrum of the CIB is usually presented in a spatial frequency [arcmin‚àí1] vs. fluctuation power [Jy2 sr‚àí1] diagram. It is contaminated by the presence of the power spectrum of foreground components, so that the total power spectrum is: P(f) = Œ¶(f)x[PCIB(f) + Pcirr(f) + Pze(f) + Pn(f)] where P(f), PCIB(f), Pcirr, Pze(f) and Pn(f) are the total, CIB, Galactic cirrus, zodiacal emission and noise (instrument noise) power spectrum components, respectively, and Œ¶ is the power spectrum of the telescope's point spread function. For most of the infrared zodiacal emission fluctuation are negligible in the \\"cosmic windows\\", far from the ecliptic plane. In the far- infrared the CIB power spectrum can be effectively used to separate it from its strongest foreground, the Galactic cirrus emission. The cirrus emission has a characteristic power spectrum of a power-law (that of a fractal spatial structure) P(f) = P0(f/f0)Œ±, where P is the fluctuation power at the spatial frequency f, P0 is the fluctuation power at the reference spatial frequency f0, and Œ± is the spectral index. Œ± was found to be Œ±‚âà-3, which is much steeper than the power spectrum of the CIB at low spatial frequencies. The cirrus component can be identified in the power spectrum at low spatial frequencies and then removed from the whole spatial frequency range. The remaining power spectrum ‚Äì after a careful correction for instrument effects ‚Äì should be that of the CIB. Autocorrelation and power spectrum studies resulted in the CIB fluctuation amplitudes at 1.25, 2.2, 3.5, 12‚Äì100Œºm based on the COBE/DIRBE measurements, and later at 90 and 170Œºm, based on the observations of the ISOPHOT instrument of the Infrared Space Observatory. Recently, the clustering of the galaxies have also been identified in the power spectrum at 160Œºm using this method. = Source counts = Source counts gives the most extensive picture about the sources building up the CIB. In a source count one tries to detect as many point/compact sources in a certain field of view as possible: this is usually done at multiple wavelengths and is often complemented by other data, e.g. photometry at visual or sub-millimeter wavelengths. In this way, one has information on the broad band spectral characteristics of the detected sources, too. The detected point sources have to be distinguished from other contaminating sources, e.g. minor bodies in the Solar System, Galactic stars and cirrus knots (local density enhancements in the Galactic cirrus emission). Source counts were important tasks for the recent infrared missions like 2MASS or the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO), and is still one of the most important questions the current and near future infrared space instruments (the Spitzer Space Telescope and the Herschel Space Observatory). While ISO was able to resolve about 3‚Äì10% of the total CIB light into individual sources (depending on the wavelength), Spitzer measurements have already detected ~30% of the CIB as sources, and this ratio is expected to be ~90% at some wavelengths with the Herschel Space Observatory. Source count results support the \\"fast evolution\\" galaxy models. In these models galaxies nowadays look significantly different than they were at z=1...2, when they were coming through an intense star-formation phase. The source count results exclude the \\"steady state\\" scenarios, where z=1...2 galaxies look similar to those we see today in our cosmic neighborhood.

He was previously a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, representing the 149th district from 2003 to 2009. He ran in the 2014 election for the U.S. House of Representatives for Pennsylvania's 13th congressional district, but ultimately withdrew. Leach ran for re-election in 2020, but lost to primary challenger Amanda Cappelletti, amid allegations of sexual harassment and sexual assault. His term will end on November 30, 2020. Early life, education, and legal career Leach was born in Philadelphia and graduated from Parkland High School in 1979 in Allentown, Pennsylvania. He received a B.A. in political science from Temple University in 1983 and a J.D. from the University of Houston Law Center in 1986. He practiced law for 16 years, focusing on family and education law. He taught constitutional law, legal ethics and First Amendment law as an adjunct professor at Cedar Crest College and Muhlenberg College. Leach served as president of the Pennsylvania Young Democrats in the early 1990s and on the Allentown Zoning Board from 1990 to 1994. He previously co-hosted a weekly political TV debate program entitled Lehigh Valley Firing Line. In 2016, Philadelphia law firm Sacks Weston Diamond LLC hired Leach to advise clients on medical marijuana licensing, permitting and regulatory rules. He left the firm in July, 2017, when he announced his congressional candidacy. Pennsylvania House of Representatives =Elections= 2002 Leach first ran for the 149th legislative district in a special election on February 12, 2002, following the resignation of Democrat Connie Williams. Leach was the Democratic nominee and lost to Republican Wallis Brooks 48%-44%, a difference of 273 votes. In the November 2002 rematch of their February special election, the Brooks campaign sent dozens of direct mail advertisements, including one accusing Leach of defending child molesters as an attorney. On the Saturday before the election, one was sent to voters accusing Leach of being anti-Semitic. The mailer carried a headline of \\"Anti- Semitism, Neo-Nazism, Holocaust Denial. They are not 'a big joke.'\\" The charges stemmed from Leach's 1999 defense of an in absentia client from Texas who was sued in Allentown, Pennsylvania, for alleged comments in an Internet chat room. Following the dismissal, the plaintiff posted on the Internet, denouncing Leach and the Texas man as anti-Semites. The posts were unearthed by a Brooks researcher and used in the mailer. \\"She had to know I was Jewish, because it had come up in a debate. But since I have a non-Jewish surname, she apparently thought she could get away with this,\\" Leach said. The campaign immediately convinced a local Jewish newspaper to denounce the mailer and reproduced the article on a flyer with a profile of Leach, emphasizing his Jewish roots and activism, on the reverse. By election day, 70 volunteers had hand-delivered the literature to most district households. On November 5, 2002, Leach defeated Brooks 53%-47%, a difference of 1,170 votes.PA State House 149 March 15, 2013 2004 Leach won re-election to a second term, defeating Republican Brad Murphy 62%-38%.PA State House 149 March 15, 2013 2006 Leach won re-election to a third term, defeating Republican Monica Treichel 67%-33%. =Tenure= In 2003, the political website PoliticsPA named him to \\"The Best of the Freshman Class\\" list, saying that he \\"has all the ingredients of a rising star\\" and that he \\"makes the job look fun.\\" In August 2005, Leach published an op-ed article in The Philadelphia Inquirer criticizing the paper's coverage of the 2005 Pennsylvania General Assembly pay raise controversy.

Cattabiani published a front-page article in The Philadelphia Inquirer that \\"exposed\\" Leach's long-standing and satirical blog \\"leachvent.com.\\" The Philadelphia City Paper criticized the Inquirer for allowing Cattabiani to \\"answer his attacker\\" through a news article, noting that \\"thousands of insiders have laughed at Leach's satire for years,\\" but the Inquirer acted as though it had been \\"recently discovered.\\" The Philadelphia City Paper wrote that Cattabiani's article incorrectly characterized Leach's website as a \\"blog\\" rather than satire and had focused on Leach's pseudonym's \\"impure thoughts,\\" while ignoring the \\"satirical attack\\" on his Cattabiani's reporting. The next day, Leach removed his website. John Grogan wrote that Leach had \\"dug his own political grave.\\" The Philadelphia City Paper criticized these negative articles about Leach by stating that \\"hidden behind the newspaper's florid obsession with Leach's naughty bits, is the state rep's pointed satire of their mediocre coverage ‚Äì a criticism that the newspaper never addresses...The Inquirer savaged this young legislator because his satire was hitting its mark: Them.\\" Notable work in the House includes proposed bills that would allow hybrid cars into the state fleet, that give state funding for breast and ovarian cancer screening for low-income women, that would address redistricting reform, that would eliminate state's lethal use of paralytic drugs, and that would require hospitals to offer emergency contraception to sexual assault victims. =Committee assignments= *State Government Pennsylvania Senate Leach in 2012 =Elections= ;2008 When Connie Williams of Pennsylvania's 17th senate district decided to retire, Leach decided to enter the election.

In January 2013, he proposed legislation that would legalize recreational use of marijuana in Pennsylvania for people 21 years or older, called the \\"Regulate Marijuana Act.\\" In defending it, Leach argued ‚ÄúWe would never, in a rational society, starting from scratch, have the policy we have now.‚Äù In 2016, a bill sponsored by Leach, legalizing some marijuana products for medical use, became law. In 2017, Leach made headlines in response to President Trump's threat to \\"destroy the career\\" of a Texas state senator who proposed legislation requiring a conviction before civil asset forfeiture, by goading the President to try to destroy Leach's career in a social media post. In December 2017, Leach was accused of inappropriately touching young female staffers and volunteers. Leach's attorney referred to media reports as a witch hunt. In a written statement, Leach denied the accusations, which he attributed to an unnamed political opponent. In response to the allegations, Gov. Wolf called on Leach to resign. In a statement the next day, Leach said he planned to stay in his seat and work with Senate leaders to address the allegations. On February 24, 2018, Leach abandoned his congressional campaign but announced that he will remain in his state senate seat. Two investigations were commissioned to investigate the allegations against Senator Leach; both reports came to the same conclusions, however, the state Senate's report was kept private. In their September 18, 2019, report, In The Matter Of Certain Allegations Relating to Senator Daylin Leach, commissioned by the Pennsylvania Democratic Caucus, Eckert Seamans Cherin & Mellott, LLC concluded, \\"With respect to Senator Leach's behavior while as a member of the Senate, we conclude that there is no evidence of actionable discrimination for harassment in violation of applicable law or Caucus policies ....\\" Further, the report found, \\"At no time did any such behavior actually create a hostile work environment under the circumstances presented here.\\"Ibid., p.42 =Committee assignments= *Education *Environmental Resources & Energy Committees April 6, 2020 2014 congressional election On April 1, 2013, Main Line Times reported that Leach would run for Pennsylvania's 13th congressional district, which was open as incumbent Democrat Allyson Schwartz ran for Governor of Pennsylvania in 2014. However, while the majority of Upper Merion Township is within the boundaries of the 13th Congressional district, Leach's home in Wayne, Upper Merion Township is actually within the state's 7th Congressional district. Leach lost in the Democratic primary, winning only 16.6% of the vote. 2018 congressional election On July 3, 2017, Leach announced his candidacy for the Congressional seat held by Republican Pat Meehan in Pennsylvania's 7th congressional district. Leach was expected to have several Democratic primary opponents. On December 18, 2017, Leach announced he was \\"taking a step back\\" from his campaign to deal with misconduct allegations of sexual talk and inappropriate touching. His lawyer said that \\"doesn‚Äôt mean he's quitting.\\" In January 2018, Meehan withdrew his candidacy for reelection after revelations that he had used taxpayer funds to settle a sexual harassment complaint. (Meehan resigned On April 27, 2018, saying he would pay back the taxpayer funds used for the settlement.) After the Pennsylvania Supreme Court threw out the state's old congressional map, Leach's home, along with most of the Montgomery County portion of the old 7th, was drawn into the new 4th District, the successor to the old 13th. On February 24, 2018, Leach finally succumbed to pressures from fellow Democrats, including Governor Tom Wolf, to abandon his congressional campaign, announcing his withdrawal on his Facebook page. He had accumulated an impressive war chest for the election to the newly redrawn district. He will remain in his state senate seat.

The prison is operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service. History The site of the prison opened in 1938 as an RAF base. On its closure in 1970, the RAF base was briefly converted into a transit camp for Ugandan refugees. In 1977, Highpoint Prison was opened, initially providing cells for male prisoners only, having been built by the prisoners themselves. Using prison labour instead of outside contractors saved ¬£2 million on the overall cost of construction. In 1997, the North part of Highpoint became a women's prison. On 3 October 2003, two years after the July 2001 separation of the North and South prisons, the North prison became Edmunds Hill. In February 2003 it emerged that two women drug therapy workers were ordered out of the prison after they were confronted with allegations that they had had inappropriate relationships with two male prisoners. The workers employer Addaction subsequently lost its contract for therapy at the prison. In May 2005 the Independent Monitoring Board criticised conditions at the prison. An investigation by the Board revealed that many inmates were forced to share single cells, and healthcare was not up to standard at the jail. A further report by the Independent Monitoring Board in May 2007 described accommodation at the prison as unfit for purpose. The report also criticised the lack of training opportunities for inmates and low morale among staff at the prison. In 2011, the prison was renamed Highpoint South Prison, while Edmunds Hill was renamed Highpoint North Prison. The prison today Highpoint South Prison holds convicted adult Category C male prisoners, serving up to and including life sentences for murderers. Accommodation at the prison comprises ten living units, all of which are purpose-built with integral sanitation, in cell electricity and in cell television. Prisoners are employed within a range of workshops, offending behaviour courses, full-time education classes and resettlement workshops. Workshops include tailoring, welding and fabrication, private sector contract services and an outdoor market garden. The Education department offers qualifications in art and design, key skills, basic skills, literacy and numeracy, social and life skills, business studies, computing and English for Speakers of Other Languages. A staffed visits centre opens at Highpoint South at lunch time for refreshments and facilities. Within the prison's Visits Hall tea, coffee and soft drinks are available.

Ligalize was also a member of D.O.B. and Bad Balance. Menshikov was born July 30, 1977 in Moscow. Hip-hop came in 1993: Legalize and Ladjack organized the project \\"Slingshot\\". He called himself \\"Legalize\\" because that was the name of his first group. Slingshot was a more serious project. They began by rapping in English, as the Russian language did not seem appropriate for rap, and recorded their first underground album. D.O.B. Slingshot was the main part of the \\"Department Of Bastards\\" (D.O.B.). The founder of this group is Sir-J, whose background included the experience of living in neighborhoods of the Bronx. Legalize participated in D.O.B.'s recording \\"Rushun Roolet\\", an English-language rap with a hard underground sound. In 1996 Legalize went to the Congo. Africa became his home after a year there. There Legalize worked with the French- speaking hip-hop group AERO Skwadra. According to him, life in the Congo and communication with local rappers were enriching experiences that broadened his views on what could be rap. A year later, civil war broke out in the Congo. Foreigners were evacuated, leading Legalize to return to Moscow. In Moscow Legalize completed work on the album \\"–ú–∞—Å—Ç–µ—Ä–∞ –°–ª–æ–≤–∞\\" (\\"Masters of Words\\"). For this album, Legalize rapped in Russian. The album featured his easily recognizable voice and unique style, rich in imagery and vivid metaphors. Legalize quickly became a leader in the Russian hip-hip scene. Currently, his prominence in underground hip-hop has begun to flourish in the mainstream. The breakdance team Jam Style & Da Boogie used his a capella rapping for two tracks, \\"–í—ã –•–æ—Ç–µ–ª–∏ Party\\" (\\"You wanted a party\\") and \\"–í—Å–µ –í–º–µ—Å—Ç–µ –ù–∞ –ú–µ—Å—Ç–µ\\" (\\"All together on the spot\\"). The first of these was a real hit, used in rotation on video channels and topping the MTV hit parade. This success attracted the attention of producer Alexander Tolmatsky, who created the record label and concert agency Miksmedia Mediastar. This was the first hip- hop company in Russia. Legal Busine$$ Project \\"Legal Busine$$\\" (–õ–µ–≥–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –ë–∏–∑–Ω–µ$$) with N'Pans seemed more attractive than just a solo MC Legalize. In general terms, the project looked like this: a talented Russian MC (Legalize), colorful black MC (N'Pans) and capable DJ (DJ Ton1k). The group launched the hit \\"–ü–∞—á–∫–∞ –°–∏–≥–∞—Ä–µ—Ç\\" (\\"A pack of cigarettes\\"). Using a track chorus Victor Tsoi, led to intense opposition from some fans of the deceased singer, but the hit turned out a hundred-percent level. As for the borrowing - Puff Daddy used refrain from Sting's song for his track \\"I'll Be Missing You \\", and all reacted to this with full understanding. In 2000 was released album of Legal Busine$$ - \\"Rifmomafiya\\". The album received strong, clearly demonstrating skilful and metaphorical manner of Legalize.

Stanford's first faculty member was a professor of geology; as such it is considered the oldest academic foundation of Stanford University. It is composed of four departments and two interdisciplinary programs. Research and teaching span a wide range of disciplines. History  Earth Sciences at Stanford can trace its roots to the university's beginnings, when Stanford's first president, David Starr Jordan, hired John Casper Branner, a geologist, as the university's first professor. The search for and extraction of natural resources was the focus of Branner's geology department during that period of Western development. Departments were originally not organized into schools but this changed when the department of geology became part of the School of Physical Sciences in 1926. This changed in 1946 when the School of Mineral Sciences was established and geology eventually split into several departments. Academics There are four academic departments within the school; Earth System Science, Geological Sciences, Geophysics, and Energy Resources Engineering There are two interdisciplinary programs housed within the school: the undergraduate and coterminal master's program Earth Systems, and the graduate Emmett Interdisciplinary Program in Environment and Resources. In addition, the school organizes a master's degree in Computational Geoscience in collaboration with the Stanford Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering. As of February 2015 it had 63 regular faculty members. The interdisciplinary programs, in conjunction with the four departments, reach out to all other schools on the Stanford campus, the United States Geological Survey (USGS), and both state and federal policy makers. The school's library, Branner Earth Sciences Library, contains over 125,000 volumes, a large map collection and Stanford's GIS lab for ongoing GIS reference and research consultation. =Rankings= The school as a whole was ranked as the third best Earth Sciences program by the U.S. News & World Report . (Caltech is ranked no. 1, MIT no. 2, and Berkeley is tied for no. 3). =Programs= The school offers both undergrad and graduate degrees. The majority of the students are graduate students, with a large contingent of coterminal master's degree recipients from the Earth Systems interdisciplinary program. The school attracts students from all six of the inhabited continents, and continues to be one of the most ethnically diverse Earth Sciences programs in the US. About 4.0% of Stanford's graduate students (approximately 360) are in the school and 1.4% of the undergraduates (approximately 100). =Research= Research programs in the SES continue to make groundbreaking discoveries about the planet, its environment, and human interactions. As a result, there are a number of industry funded-research groups (i.e.Stanford Exploration Project, Stanford Wave Physics Laboratory, Stanford Rock Physics and Borehole Geophysics Project) that implement student- led research for industry implementation. San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth (SAFOD) The San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth (SAFOD) is one of three components of the Earthscope Project, funded by the National Science Foundation in conjunction with the USGS and NASA. The SAFOD site is located just north of the town of Parkfield, California. The SAFOD main hole was drilled to a depth of ~3.4 km in 2004 and 2005, crossing the San Andreas near a region of the fault where repeating Magnitude 2 earthquakes are generated. A goal of this project is to install instruments to record data near the source of these earthquakes. In addition to the installation of these instruments, rock and fluid samples were continuously collected during the drilling process, and will also be used to analyze changes in geochemistry and mechanical properties around the fault zone. The project will lead to a better understanding of the processes that control the behavior of the San Andreas fault, and it is hoped that the development of instrumentation and analytic methods will help evaluate the possibility of earthquake prediction which is of primary importance for earthquake engineering. The project is co-PIed by Bill Ellsworth and Steve Hickman of the USGS, and Stanford geophysics faculty member and alum Mark Zoback. Zoback's research in the SES focuses on stress and crustal mechanics. His students are heavily engaged in on-going research in the Global Climate and Energy Project.

He represented Kings County in the Legislative Assembly of Prince Edward Island from 1812 to 1825. Worrell died in London in 1858. He was the son of Jonathan Worrell, a land owner in Barbados. His father gave his property in Barbados to his elder sons, but also purchased land for Charles and his brother Edward on Prince Edward Island in 1803. Worrell was trained as a lawyer and first practised in England. In 1810, Charles registered as a barrister for the island's Supreme Court and came to serve as a justice of the peace, high sheriff and was a Lieutenant-Colonel in the Island Colonial militia. He served in the Island's Council from 1825 to 1836 and in the Legislative Council from 1839 to 1843. Charles and Edward became owners of Lot 41, most of Lot 39 and part of Lot 40. Becoming the land agent for Lot 42, he eventually purchased it in 1834, also acquiring Lot 43 and Lot 66. In 1838, he purchased his brother's share of their shared properties. Although his now 'estate' was generally less productive in terms of rents from tenancy, leased for agriculture, compared to other land on the island, his properties supported shipyards, sawmills and a carding mill. The Worrell Estate, at its peak in 1843, consisted of Lots 39, 41, 42, 43, 66, and large sections of Lots 38 and 40 ‚Äì some 81,303 acres. In 1846, Lot 40 saw the settlement of 204 acres by six Mi'kmaq families, \\"a free gift of a portion of the lands of his estate to certain Indians, and their descendants.\\" When the Worrell Estate was later purchased by the Government of PEI the Mi'kmaq were moved to a grant of 189 acres on Lot 39, this becoming the Morell Reserve.Tammy MacDonald, Mi'kmaq on Epekwitk: Creation of The Reserves on PEI, Feb 2010, See: http://www.mcpei.ca/files/u1/Creation_of_the_Reserves_on_PEI_1.pdf Accessed 21.01.2016 The 1854 Sale of The Worrell Estate At the very time when his land acquisitions had reached their peak, now in his seventies, Worrell began to consider retirement to England. In 1844, he began to sell his land but, found less interest in it than he had hoped; tired and frustrated he turned over his Island affairs to a board of trustees, and left for England in 1848. His board served him ill and he was to wait six more years before the estate was sold, in a transaction amounting to a swindle, as William Henry Pope came to purchase his estate in 1854 for ¬£14,000 and then soon after sell it to the Island government, in the same year for ¬£24,100. At the time of sale the Worrell Estate was some 70, 539 acres, being purchased at $.95 CAD 1875, per acre, regardless of value. Worrell was thus provided with a belated taste of the problems absentee proprietors had often encountered by untrustworthy local agents.M. Brook Taylor, Biography (1985): Worrell, Charles.

Following the Colonial government passing of its 1853 Land Purchase Act, advising him to sell, his trustees delegated an agent to gain Worrell's acquiescence to give up his estate, to the government, for ¬£10 000.Testimony: Hon George Coles, Abstract of the Proceedings Before the Land Commissioners' Court, Prince Edward Island Land Commissioners' Court, Charlottetown, 1862. See Page: 13. Accessed 20.01.2016 Apparently with no justification, acting on his own, their agent informed Worrell that the government did not in fact wish to buy the property, seeing Worrell suggest that the estate be offered to a private buyer for ¬£9,000, an offer that in-turn was never passed-on. Worrell, impatient to be rid of his debt-encumbered and far-away estate, having no buyer, accepted advice to discuss the matter with Pope, who happened to be on his way to England. Readily accepting Pope's 'better' offer, his PEI estate was privately sold. On 28 December 1854, Pope and his financial backers, his father (Joseph Pope), his father-in-law (Thomas DesBrisay), and George Elkana Morton, then resold the property to the Island (Liberal Coles) Government, a work of jobbery, then unique in its magnitude on the Island.Ian Ross Robertson, Biography (1972): Pope, William Henry.

In 1860, Dunbar Douglas, Lord Selkirk, offered his remaining holdings to the Island Colonial Government, then embracing parts of Lot 53, all of Lots 57, 58, 59, 60 and Lot 62, containing some 62,059 acres.MacQueen, Malcolm A., Skye Pioneers and \\"The Island\\", Part 1: Founding of Belfast, Stovel Company Limited, Winnipeg, 1929.

St. Oswald's parish, as defined in the mid 14th century, comprised the northern suburb next to the priory, Brook Street, the house of the Carmelite friars, and Hyde to the east of the town, and parts of Longford and Twigworth to the north; parts of Kingsholm also in the mid 16th century. The parish and church were renamed St. Catherine after the Dissolution, although the former name was frequently used. The church was served by a curate in 1536 and by a vicar in 1542.

An announcement in the August 6, 1904 issue of The New York Times indicated that the Metropolitan Association of the Amateur Athletic Union would hold a \\"special five-mile race\\" at Celtic Park on August 13, 1904 with the eight top finishers receiving a paid trip to compete in the marathon at the Olympic Games in St. Louis on August 30, 1904. Cohn was named as one of 19 \\"probable competitors\\" in the event. In 1904 he was eighth in 1500 m competition. He also participated in the final of 800 m competition and in the final of 2590 meter steeplechase competition, but his exact placement in those races is unknown. In 1905, he was the Amateur Athletic Union champion in the 2 mile steeplechase. In the 1908 Olympic Games, 3 miles team race, he finished in twelfth place. As the last American to finish, he was not awarded silver medal. (Only three fastest of each team were awarded a medal).

It is also known as just \\"Tenka\\" in some other forms of release. The game is set in a futuristic action environment. The player character engages in battle with a number of various armed flying robots, stationary turrets, and bipedal creatures. Plot Lifeforce Tenka takes place in a dystopian future where a multinational conglomerate, Trojan Incorporated, is in the process of performing presumably unethical genetic experiments. Joseph D. Tenka, the protagonist, discovers the corporation's nefarious activities and sets about bringing them and their genetically engineered army down. Gameplay The weapon design differs from similar games of the time in that instead of the player character acquiring stronger more powerful weapons to add to an accumulated arsenal, weapon modifications are picked up and added to the same weapon (known as the \\"Self- Generating Polymorphic armoury\\", or SG-26) and switched between as necessary. Development Development on the game began in earnest in January 1995. The graphics in the game were created using Softimage 3D. With Softimage as the construction tool, the programmers additionally wrote a suite of custom Softimage scene extraction utilities. Since the PlayStation cannot perform perspective correct texture mapping, what senior programmer Martin Linklater called \\"a dynamic multistage clipping and meshing system\\" was incorporated in Lifeforce Tenkas graphics engine in order to reduce the effect of warping textures. The development team opted to make the game single-player only. Linklater explained, \\"The current design for the game does not lend itself to a two-player game. We have chosen to concentrate on a single-player game - which would be the most played version anyway.\\" Reception Lifeforce Tenka received middling reviews. Critics deemed the graphics technically impressive due to the lighting effects and polygonal enemies, but some found them overly dark, making most of the levels appear the same. Most also stated that the game simply did not offer enough new gameplay elements to make it stand out from previous first person shooters. However, GamePros Atomic Dawg opined that the unintuitive controls for strafing and looking up and down are the game's weak point, and the familiarity of the gameplay is actually what saves it from mediocrity: \\"... just when you feel like swearing, some ugly mutant charges you, and the ensuing adrenaline rush reminds you why you play video games. Tenka is trigger-happy fun.\\" In addition, critics universally praised the bizarre and often gruesome enemy designs. Crispin Boyer of Electronic Gaming Monthly stated that \\"The spider-head bad guys will give you nightmares.\\", though he and his three co-reviewers said the game overall lacks excitement and variety. A Next Generation critic similarly remarked, \\"Occasionally intense, Tenkas gameplay is solid but never frantically drives the player forward the way the best first-person shooters do.\\" IGN looked at it more optimistically, concluding, \\"At its heart, Tenka is a good, solid shooter. It won't knock Doom off its throne, but it is strong enough to contend.\\" Glenn Rubenstein of GameSpot judged that though Lifeforce Tenka was one of the better first-person shooters on the market, its high difficulty level and lack of innovation would make it unappealing to all but fans of the genre.https://www.mobygames.com/game/codename-tenka References Category:1997 video games Category:First-person shooters Category:PlayStation (console) games Category:Video games scored by Tim Wright Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Cyberpunk video games Category:Windows games ","title":"Lifeforce Tenka"},{"id":"14936518","text":"Alfred Kotey (3 June 1968 ‚Äì 30 June 2020) was a Ghanaian professional boxer who competed from 1988 to 2012.

Russian army of about 15,000 under Yury Dolgorukov met the Polish force of about 24,000 under Stefan Czarniecki. The first skirmishes were between the cavalleries of both sides with Russians being victorious. A full-scale battle took place on 28 September on a big field near the village Gubarev. Supported by the artillery, the Russian infantry launched a successful attack on the center of the Polish forces which were seriously decimated. On the flanks, however, the Polish cavalry began to prevail over the Russian one and forced it to retreat in disorder, allowing the main body of the Russian army to be surrounded. However, the Russians continued to fight and didn't abandon the field until the end of Polish attacks and their withdrawal. Both sides suffered heavy losses. The hostilities resumed on 10 October after Russians received reinforcement by 900 men of voyevoda Maxim Rtishchev. The army of Dolgorukov managed to throw a forthcoming force of Micha≈Ç Kazimierz Pac back to its camp but couldn't use this success further. Both armies found themselves in a stalemate and the slow approach of the winter in a ravaged environment was seen as a threat on the both sides. The hostilities on the Basya river ended when the Poles heard the news of Ivan Khovansky campaign and decided to leave. Dolgorukov had no order of the Tsar to pursuit the Poles and stayed, awaiting reinforcement from his brother. Strategically, the 1660 campaign showed that the Commonwealth was not able to decide the war on its own even after signing peace with Sweden. References  * Malov A.V. Russo-Polish War (1654‚Äì1667).

He has been involved in legal cases for high-profile notorious defendants worldwide; he has no legal qualifications, is barred from working in law in the UK, and is not registered to work as an advocate in the UK or Italy. He has been referred to as \\"The Devil's Advocate\\" for his advocacy on behalf of such claimed clients as Saddam Hussein and Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá. He was also a business associate of the Serbian paramilitary leader and indicted war criminal ≈Ωeljko Ra≈ænatoviƒá. He has been convicted four times in Ireland and the United Kingdom of fraud and related criminal offences, serving a total of eight and a half years for convictions between 1975 and the late 1980s. He was described by a judge as \\"one of life's great swindlers\\". His most recent conviction was in March 2013 when he was sentenced to 14 years' imprisonment after being found guilty or pleading guilty to 27 charges including deception, fraud and money laundering between 2001 and 2011 related to \\"tricking people into thinking he was a bona fide legal professional\\".  Life and career  Di Stefano was born in Petrella Tifernina near Campobasso in Southern Italy. When his father emigrated to England to work in a shoe factory, Giovanni and his mother later followed settling in Irchester, Northamptonshire when Giovanni was six years old. He then went on to study at John Lea School in Wellingborough, and later spent one year at Wellingborough Grammar School (which later became Wrenn School). In his 1986 fraud trial and in his entry in Marquis Who's Who he claimed that he had obtained a PhD in law from Cambridge University around this time, but this claim was later found to be without foundation. (registration required) In his twenties, he claimed to have 'earned a fortune importing videotapes' from Hong Kong. Despite living much of his early life in England, he considered himself an Italian. During this time at school in England he was often called \\"John\\", the English for \\"Giovanni\\". Di Stefano lived in England until 1989. He then moved to several locations: Los Angeles between 1989 and 1992. In 1992 his bid to buy the MGM movie studios failed, and he fled to Yugoslavia because the Breakup of Yugoslavia had made it a war zone and nobody would look for him there. Once in Yugoslavia, he became a friend of its then- president Slobodan Milosevic who granted him Yugoslav nationality with a Yugoslavian passport. Additionally, he became a spokesman, a business partner, and a personal legal representative of the Serbian warlord Arkan. He also served as general in the Serb Volunteer Guard (Arkan's Tigers), although he never fought. He stayed in Serbia until 1999; and later, Italy from 1999 to 2011, while working in the UK as a lawyer. In 2011, he was arrested and extradited to the UK because he didn't have the legal requisites necessary to work as a lawyer on the UK. In 2013, he was sentenced to 14 years of imprisonment in a UK prison. = Legal career = Di Stefano had an office in Rome, the Studio Legale Internazionale. He is well documented, for defending in the UK media, \\"some of the country's most notorious villains\\". He once commented that he would \\"...defend Adolf Hitler or Satan.\\" He says he \\"defends the indefensible\\", and his autobiography is called Defending the Indefensible. When asked about his motivation, he replied, \\"No one's ever asked, 'Does Satan have a case? Does he have a good case?'\\" The Scotsman describes Di Stefano as a \\"colourful and often controversial lawyer\\"; The Guardian has called him \\"surely the only man in the world to claim the personal friendship of Saddam Hussein and the personal enmity of Delia Smith\\", after a failed bid to buy Norwich City F.C.. Di Stefano used the Italian title \\"avvocato\\" (\\"advocate\\", analogous to an English lawyer) on his business card, and misled clients and the courts into believing that he was a qualified lawyer. On 27 March 2013 he was convicted on 25 charges including deception, fraud and money laundering between 2001 and 2011 by a jury at Southwark Crown Court in London. During the trial he had told the court of his links to Robert Mugabe, Osama bin Laden, Saddam Hussein (whom he described as a \\"nice guy\\") and his \\"friendship\\" with the daughter of Slobodan Milosevic. He took up the avvocato title after a 2002 High Court ruling which allowed him to represent Nicholas van Hoogstraten in his manslaughter appeal. In evidence he admitted that he was not a qualified lawyer but that he only realised this \\"in hindsight\\" . Di Stefano attracted clients after a BBC documentary entitled \\"Notorious\\" (see below); these included Paul Bush, jailed for life in 2003 for kidnapping and murder, whose wife paid ¬£20,000 for legal services and, with others, ¬£100,000 to di Stefano secure bail for her husband ‚Äì the money was received before the killer was told there was never any possibility of bail. Much of this ¬£100,000 bail security was never returned, even after the appeal failed. Cocaine smuggler Laurent Penchef's parents paid di Stefano 10,000 Euros in June 2005 for legal services, specifically CCRC and advice regarding repatriation to France, however he was never given clear advice about how his 18-year jail sentence would be implemented in France and no work was done taking his case to the CCRC. The money was sent to a bank in Rome by Penchef's parents, but prosecutor David Aaronberg QC said: ‚ÄúMr Di Stefano did little or nothing to assist.\\" \\"He was no more a qualified lawyer than he was a ‚Äúsurgeon qualified to perform surgery or pilot qualified to fly an aeroplane\\", said Mr Aaronberg. =Notable claims= Notable people that Giovanni Di Stefano has claimed to represent include: * Harold Shipman The Irish Independent commented \\"The law firm that represented Shipman later denied that di Stefano had acted for its client.\\" * Saddam Hussein; (only as part of their legal team in 2004, and only before the trial began) * Tariq Aziz; * Jeremy Bamber;BBC article and video interview for HARDtalk by David Jessel (first broadcast 2004-03-25) * Nicholas van Hoogstraten; * Patrick Holland; * John Gilligan;Shelbourne scraps talks with controversial Di Stefano * Charles Bronson; * Ali Hassan al-Majid (known as Chemical Ali, whose death sentence Di Stefano tried, but failed, to overturn); * Pop singer and serial sex-offender Gary Glitter; * Birgit Cunningham (on her child support payment complaints against the son of billionaire Sir Nicholas Nuttall); * Ian Brady; * Ian Strachan (one of the defendants in the 2007 royal blackmail plot). * He has written to the Parole Board requesting Ronnie Biggs's release on compassionate grounds. In 2002, he managed to overturn a manslaughter conviction against Hoogstraten, getting him released from prison. In January 2004, Di Stefano again came to fame when he claimed to be acting for serial killer Harold Shipman in television interviews. However, Shipman's lawyer says that Shipman had rejected Di Stefano's offer in May 2003, and that neither he nor any member of Shipman's family believed that Di Stefano was acting for Shipman. This, and an incident in a 2004 trial of John Palmer, prompted an investigation into Di Stefano's qualifications as lawyer (see \\"personal legal history\\" section). On 17 March 2007, Di Stefano wrote to Lord Goldsmith (at that time the Attorney General for England and Wales) asking for leave to prosecute Judge Rauf Rashid Abd al- Rahman, who had sentenced Saddam Hussein, under the Geneva Conventions Act 1957. On 14 January 2008, Di Stefano was reported as saying \\"Hurried justice is no justice\\", after a claimed UK client, who had won ¬£1million in the National Lottery, failed to attend court as a witness in an assault case. Judge Christopher Elwen jailed her for 14 days anyway. In January 2007 Di Stefano asked the International Criminal Court to make a full investigation of the Al-Dujail trials of Saddam Hussein's half-brother Barzan Ibrahim al- Tikriti and Iraq's judiciary head Awad Hamed al-Bandar. Di Stefano circulated a note handwritten by Barzan where he explains that he wasn't responsible for the killings at Dujail for which he was sentenced to death. In October 2007 he complained that the investigation of Blackwater's civilian deaths on Iraq was unjust because they were forced to operate in a climate and conditions that forced them to shoot first and ask questions later when they came under attack. Also in October 2007 he argued that Iraqi officials had to accept a pardon application for Ali Hassan al-Majid (Chemical Ali) because the 30-day execution window set the trial had passed. The US military later refused to release Ali for his execution until the legal questions were answered. Ali was sentenced to death again in February 2008 for different charges. The execution was further delayed in December 2008 as a new trial was opened against him with further charges. Ali was executed on 25 January 2010, fulfilling eight death sentences.. In October 2007 Di Stefano asked the British Home Secretary for posthumous pardon of Hawley Harvey Crippen, who had been hanged for murder in 1910, on the basis of new forensic evidence indicating that the body found was not that of his wife, and a letter from his wife that was sent after the date of the alleged murder and was never presented on the trial, and that he never murdered her. () The request was filed on behalf of the doctor's last living relative. On 15 January 2008 Di Stefano said that he knew of a sixth victim of Moors murderers Ian Brady and Myra Hindley called Jennifer Tighe. He said he had a photo of her, and intended to speak to Brady to see if the killer would confess to this latest allegation. On 21 January 2008 Greater Manchester Police (GMP) issued a statement saying that Jennifer Tighe was alive and that \\"Mr Di Stefano has previously made claims regarding the Moors murders in the media but has not provided any detail to Greater Manchester Police.\\"Moors murder 'victim' is 'alive, Greater Manchester Police ‚Äì Accessed 26 January 2008 Di Stefano invited GMP to interview his client and to provide proper evidence that Tighe was still alive.Response from Giovanni Di Stefano to Greater Manchester police statement re Moors murders, Studio Legale Internazionale (21 January entry) Moors murderer Ian Brady has been force-fed at a top security hospital since he started a hunger strike in September 1999. In September 2007, Brady applied via Di Stefano to be moved to a conventional jail where he intended to starve himself to death. Later, in November 2008, when Brady was still being force-fed, Giovanni accused the state of legally starving Brady to death by not giving him enough food. In 2009‚Äì2010 Di Stefano made appeals to move him to a Scottish prison so he can die there, a move that the Scottish government strongly opposed. In September 2009, acting in the name of Manuel Noriega, Di Stefano presented an appeal to French president Nicolas Sarkozy, saying the ruling against Noriega had been incorrectly made in absentia. In May 2010 he made an appeal on behalf of Benguit Omar, saying that he was wrongly convicted for the murder of Jong-Ok Shin. In January 2011 Di Stefano reported that he had asked for Charles Manson's permission to represent him, in an application to review his trial based upon a violation of the 6th Amendment and a legal argument that had not been raised during Manson's trial, although he had still to get his reply. Around 26 January 2011 Di Stefano claimed to have filed an application with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights on behalf of Manson claiming the same violations.ref>https://edition.cnn.com/2011/CRIME/02/07/charles.manson.attorney/index.html = Personal legal history = Di Stefano was arrested in June 1984 and charged with fraud before being released on bail. He was again arrested in August of that year and refused bail. In 1986, Di Stefano was tried for conspiracy to obtain property by deception and fraudulent trading, and was convicted after a 78-day trial, jailed for five years, and prohibited from being a company director for 10 years; of a total of 11 fraud counts, he was convicted of 3 counts and acquitted of 8. In the ruling, the judge called him \\"one of nature's fraudsters... a swindler without scruple or conscience.\\" and said he was \\"motivated by personal greed and pretension.\\" Court records show that Di Stefano's only attempt to appeal the conviction was dismissed in 1987 and further records published in 2005 showed that he served the full sentence. (registration required) The Lord Justice of Appeal Stephen Brown said \\"[the trial] revealed a very deep and wide measure of fraudulent behaviour. This was a man who was undoubtedly seeking to operate a financial fraud wherever he was able to induce people to succumb to representations skilfully made in the form of bogus financial documents.\\" Di Stefano had publicly claimed that his 1987 appeal was successful, until a copy of the failed appeal was made public in 2004 by Rosie Cowan of The Independent. Di Stefano claimed that he had taken legal action in Italian courts of law against Cowan and against Martin Hannan of Scotland on Sunday, but the legal departments of their newspapers said that had no knowledge of any legal action started by Di Stefano against them. He also unsuccessfully appealed in 1989 to the European Commission of Human Rights alleging that his arrest violated the European Convention on Human Rights. (at this time he used the name \\"John\\") Di Stefano claimed in a BBC article that the conviction was quashed on a second appeal in 1988 and that \\"a sense of injustice remains, making each victory against the system a sweet revenge.\\" According to The Guardian and the Irish Independent, he had already served a six-month sentence for fraud and false pretenses in 1975 in Ireland, and a three-year sentence for obtaining property by deception and other charges in 1976 in the UK. Di Stefano insists that these convictions were those of a different person, called \\"John\\" instead of \\"Giovanni\\", although they share the same surname, birthday and birthplace. According to The New Zealand Herald, Di Stefano had already denied being the \\"John Di Stefano\\" who had been convicted in 1986, but, also according to the New Zealand Herald, the New Zealand police managed to verify that they were the same person by comparing his fingerprints. Di Stefano denies that he was ever deported or that his fingerprints were ever taken. In 1990 a Solicitors' Disciplinary Tribunal ruled that Di Stefano could not be employed by any solicitor in England or Wales without permission from the Law Society, because of his criminal record, although he could still contract a solicitor to act on his name. In 1990, Giovanni Di Stefano travelled to New Zealand, where he made several multimillion-dollar bids on property on behalf of a Beverly Hills- based company. The authorities discovered that he had not disclosed a conviction in England in 1986, declared him a prohibited immigrant, and he was subsequently returned to his country of origin. In 1991, he moved to Yugoslavia. In November 2002 he received the Yugoslavian citizenship and passport by personal authorisation of president Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá. According to The Scotsman and Irish Independent, Di Stefano was moving to a country with no extradition treaty with the UK, to escape a warrant for fraud charges. Around 1992, while trying to buy the MGM film studio, the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service deported him from the United States because of a fraud conviction in the UK in 1986. Months later he applied for a non-immigrant visa for re-entry, and was told that he needed a waiver of grounds of inadmissibility to be eligible. The waiver application was denied by the federal agency, causing the visa to also be denied. In 1993, he appealed to a United States District Court, which ruled that it lacked jurisdiction to review the denial of a waiver application. In 1995, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the judgment of the district court, ruling that Di Stefano did not have standing to challenge the waiver denial under the Immigration and Nationality Act. In November 1999 Di Stefano was arrested in Rome and extradited to Britain to be tried for fraud charges in the insolvency in 1991 of five hotels in the English Midlands and a company called Sandhurst Assets. British investigators recognized his name when newspapers reported his bids for Dundee football club and for Ellington Colliery, and acted on a 1991 warrant. In June 2001, after Di Stefano had spent 18 months in jail, a judge ruled that he couldn't be tried because too much time had passed since the alleged offences. During his stay in Rebibbia prison, his friend Arkan was assassinated and his other friend Milo≈°eviƒá was jailed shortly before he was released; Di Stefano claims that it was all part of a conspiracy to isolate Milo≈°eviƒá from his most trusted adviser. (second part) In 2002 the Governor of HM Prison Belmarsh barred Di Stefano's access to a client in prison, Nicholas van Hoogstraten. The restriction was appealed to the High Court of Justice in R (Van Hoogstraten) v Governor of Belmarsh PrisonRegina (Van Hoogstraten) v Governor of Belmarsh Prison [2003] 1 WLR 264 which ruled against the prison governor. The decision held that the governor's challenge to Di Stefano's credentials was not filed in a timely manner, and that some evidence suggested Di Stefano was an Italian lawyer and that Italian lawyers, as a rule, were permitted visitation in British prisons as European lawyers. The justice further ruled that since denying Di Stefano's visits to the prisoner would cause severe prejudice to the client's legal defence, he could not be denied that right until a timely and successful challenge was made. In spite of these problems, he managed gain the release Hoogstraten from prison in 2004 (see \\"notable people\\" section). In November the Higher court made a different ruling for a different prison, this time saying that Di Stefano had failed to provide adequate credentials, and preventing him from visiting John Palmer in prison. In December 2003 Di Stefano was featured in a BBC documentary series called Notorious, covering four entrepreneurs that had obtained their fortunes via controversial means; his chapter was called Devil's Advocate. (registration required) In the documentary he said that Hitler would have never been convicted for killing Jews, thus enraging the Jewish community. At that time Di Stefano was trying to be the director of the Dundee FC, and the fans of the club were also outraged because he was wearing a Dundee pullover while making those statements. He also boasted of his friendship with Saddam Hussein and with Serbian warlord Arkan. In January 2004, The Guardian and the Daily Record (needs registration) reported that Di Stefano's legal qualifications were under investigation by the British police and the Law Society since the spring of 2003, to see if he had misrepresented himself as an accredited solicitor, in violation of Solicitors Act 1974. As a result of the investigation he was eventually arrested in 2011 in Spain (see paragraph below). The Law Society declared that he was \\"not a solicitor, or a registered foreign lawyer, or a registered European lawyer\\", and that they were unable to verify either his legal qualifications or his status as a foreign lawyer despite going to considerable lengths, and despite asking Di Stefano himself for the information. The Law Society of Scotland and the Ordine Degli Avvocati of Rome have also said that he is not a registered solicitor. His name does not appear in Italy's national lawyers' register. Di Stefano claims that he does not need to register with either the Law Society nor with any Italian bar association in order to practise in the UK, a claim that is rejected by the Law Society. As of 2004, Di Stefano could not represent his clients directly, and he had to represent them through Paul Martin & Co, a firm associated with his legal firm Studio Legale Internazionale that acts as his agent. Alastair Cook, co-director of the BBC series that made a documentary about Di Stefano said \\"(...) We witnessed him in court, but he never actually stands up and pretends to be a lawyer. He assembles a legal team and acts as a middle man, whispering in lawyers' ears as they act on behalf of clients. He knows a lot of criminals and introduces them to his legal teams who get them off on technicalities or help them retain their assets.\\" In March 2006, Ireland Chief Justice Murray told Di Stefano that he would have to provide proof of his legal qualifications before he could act for Patrick 'Dutchy' Holland and be his legal representative, and he eventually ruled that Di Stefano had failed to provide any credential. Di Stefano sued Murray for the negative remarks made about him during the case, but he later dropped his complaint, saying that he did not want to harm a \\"great jurist\\" just to win a case. English libel law changed with the Defamation Act 2013, reducing the potential for abuse to exert a chilling effect. =Arrest and trial= Di Stefano was arrested in Palma, Majorca in Spain on 14 February 2011 on a European Arrest Warrant issued by the British authorities. According to the City of London Police, the warrant had been issued in January 2011 \\"on matters relating to fraud, theft and money laundering\\". The arrest was the outcome of a lengthy investigation by the City of London Police's economic crime directorate.\\"Lawyer Giovanni di Stefano held in Spain.\\" BBC News, 15 February 2011 According to a statement by the Spanish Interior Ministry, quoting the arrest warrant, Di Stefano was accused of having earned large sums of money in the UK between 2004 and 2009 without being licensed to practise law in that country.\\"Spain arrests lawyer linked to Saddam defense team\\". The Associated Press, 15 February 2011 The ministry said that he was facing 18 charges for which he could receive a maximum 75 years in prison.\\"Spanish police arrest 'Saddam's lawyer'\\". Agence France-Presse, 5 February 2011 Di Stefano has voluntarily accepted his extradition to the UK, and he was released without bail until the extradition date, with no passport and with the obligation of going to the judge every few days and communicating any residency change. Di Stefano says that it is a political trial, prepared after he said that Tony Blair should be judged by his role in the Iraq war. On 25 August Westminster Magistrates' Court referred the case involving 18 charges of fraud to Southwark Crown Court for a hearing on 30 September. After the hearing, Di Stefano was released on bail, pending trial on 14 January 2013. In July 2011, Di Stefano announced that he was launching News of the World Online, a website with a masthead logo similar to that of the recently closed News of the World newspaper. On 23 March 2012, News International, the paper's former publisher, sued Di Stefano for violating its trademark. Subsequently, in a Press Complaints Commission case relating to a Sunday Mail article (needs registration) about a YouTube video posted by Tricia Walsh- Smith stating \\"that he had taken ¬£100,000 from the individual who had posted the online video\\". The Sunday Mail agreed to print a statement saying \\"Giovanni Di Stefano has denied ripping off Tricia Walsh-Smith ... Ms Walsh- Smith claimed that Mr Di Stefano duped her into investing in the News of the World online while she was contributing a weekly column, \\"Livin' an' Lovin' with Tricia Walsh-Smith\\". \\" Four of the August 2012 charges against him related to Walsh-Smith; Di Stefano had falsely claimed to be a lawyer, claiming he could overturn the Walsh-Smith pre-nuptial agreement, and persuading Walsh-Smith to invest in News of the World online. This brought the charges against Di Stefano up to twenty-eight counts of fraud; his trial began at Southwark Crown Court on 28 January 2013. On 6 March 2013 he told the court that he was a qualified advocate because Yugoslavia president Milosevic had awarded him an honorary law doctorate from the University of Belgrade \\"simply because he had asked.\\" On 27 March 2013 he was found guilty of all charges; nine counts of obtaining a money transfer by deception, eight counts of fraud, three counts of acquiring criminal property, two counts of using a false instrument, one count of attempting to obtain a money transfer by deception, one count of obtaining property by deception and one count of using criminal property. He subsequently pleaded guilty to two additional counts: defrauding a couple out of ¬£160,000, including a woman's life savings of ¬£75,000, and stealing ¬£150,000 from a man who had been in a car accident and lost a limb. He was sentenced to 14 years imprisonment. Judge Alistair McCreath stated that Di Stefano had caused misery and frustration to many people and called him a predator for his treatment of \\"desperate and vulnerable\\" clients: \\"You had no regard for them nor for their anguish. Your only concern was to line your own pockets.\\" He described Di Stefano's crimes as \\"planned and persistent,\\" his defence in court as \\"breathtakingly cynical,\\" and his overall conduct as showing \\"greed, dishonesty and utter disregard for the sensibilities of others.\\" In the press release of the Crown Prosecution Service, Hilary Ryan, from the CPS' Organised Crime Division, said: \\"For many years, Giovanni Di Stefano described himself to potential clients as a lawyer and usually as an Italian 'avvocato'. He was nothing of the sort. When the law caught up with him, he falsely claimed to have obtained various formal legal qualifications. He then went on to claim that having taught himself the law, he was entitled to describe himself as a lawyer. This was fraud by anyone's standards and a charade that he kept up for over eight years in order to line his own pockets. (...) Giovanni Di Stefano routinely tricked his clients and abused their trust. (...)\\" On 4 April 2014, eight and a half years were added to Di Stefano's fourteen-year sentence, unless he compensated his victims immediately. The judge who jailed him in March 2013 at Southwark Crown Court, Alistair McCreath, told him to \\"pay back ¬£1.4million forthwith or serve the extra time.\\" He said Di Stefano had no intention of paying and had \\"stuck up two fingers to the court\\". first=Eamon last= Dillon date= 4 April 2014  Other interests  = Football = When he went back to Italy to the region of his birth, he bought the local team Campobasso Calcio, (online translation ) the club had to close a year later due to financial problems. In association with Arkan he purchased control of the Serbian second division football club FK Obiliƒá; within two seasons the club was promoted from the Serbian second division to a place in the UEFA Champions League, amidst accusations of threats, intimidations and match-fixing, which Di Stefano has always denied. Di Stefano announced in 1999 he had purchased 34% of Dundee F.C., but Dundee's board denied that any deal had been closed. The board finally rejected the bid when it was made public that he was friend of Serbian warlord Arkan, and that Suffolk police had issued an extradition warrant for fraud charges dating back to 1991. In January 2001, Di Stefano announced his intention to purchase a 6% stake in Norwich City from its former vice-chairman Jimmy Jones. These shares would not give Di Stefano a seat of the board of directors, but he said that they allowed him to sue the majority shareholders to get a seat or to buy more shares. The club officials claim that the share transfer was never confirmed. In 2002, Di Stefano entered into talks to purchase a 60% stake in Northampton Town, however Di Stefano's valuation of the club changed following an EGM, and the deal fell through. Di Stefano approached the Dundee board again in 2003, and was appointed as a director on 7 August 2003. Initially the club attracted big-name players such as Craig Burley and Fabrizio Ravanelli, but the club quickly ran into financial difficulties, 15 senior players were released from their contracts, the Scottish Football Association refused to confirm his appointment as director because his fraud convictions didn't qualify him as a \\"fit and proper person\\" as required by article 10 of its rules. The Dundee board asked Di Stefano's to resign, and he handed his resignation from the club on 22 January 2004. In April 2005, he proclaimed an interest in investing approximately ‚Ç¨1m in Irish football club Shelbourne, but the club rejected his interest, citing his decision to let his intentions be known to the media first as the reason. In April 2006, there were rumours about Di Stefano trying to buy Drogheda United F.C. and Waterford United F.C., but both clubs issued statements denying any contact. In October 2007, Di Stefano announced through his website his renewed interest in taking control of Norwich City. In February 2011 So Foot French magazine published an interview stating that Di Stefano was considering a bid with others to acquire a stake in AS Monaco FC and multi branding the football club with his record companies. A 2019 book relates in context his involvement with Norwith City and Dundee, what happened exactly with the signings of football stars Fabrizio Ravanelli and Claudio Caniggia, and what could have happened if Giovanni had managed to take over the clubs. = Music production = In 2007, he produced and launched Seriously Single, an album by Italian singer JustCarmen that put a relatively unknown singer into the studio with recordings of big stars from the past. The album was a minor hit, selling 40,000 copies, but some of the duet tracks got 650,000 downloads. In 2009, he produced and launched a second album by JustCarmen, I wish u love, which has two new duets with The Bachelors. His interest on music comes from his youth, when he played guitar themes and organised music events at his school house. He has also released in 2009 a CD with his own songs The Next Time.The Next Time ‚Äì Limited Edition cdbaby.com = Politics = In April 2004, Di Stefano founded a political party, the Radical Party of Great Britain, by registering it at the Electoral Commission with himself as its leader, but the party fielded no candidates in the 2005 general election, the 2008 London Assembly election, or the 2008 local elections. It reported no income, expenditure, assets or liabilities in 2006‚Äì2008.Electoral Commission register of party finances and statements of account In a November 2007 interview with Dublin's Hot Press magazine's senior editor Jason O'Toole, Di Stefano expressed an interest in running in the Republic of Ireland in the European Union elections with an anti-immigration manifesto. Around 1999‚Äì2002 he had been the secretary general of the \\"right wing but not fanatical\\" Partito Nazionale Italiano. In 1999, he was also the foreign speaker of the Party of the Serbian Unit of his friend Arkan. = Other companies = In the eighties, Di Stefano says that he imported videotapes from Hong Kong into the UK, making a ¬£200 million fortune when he was still in his twenties. In 1992‚Äì1999, when he was in Yugoslavia, Di Stefano says that he invested in their national airline company, which had been grounded because of the war. In 1990 Di Stefano and some partners tried to buy the MGM movie studios. One of the MGM executives said in Variety that Di Stefano's bid was the stuff of \\"Alice in Wonderland\\". The bid was not successful. His partners Florio Fiorini and Giancarlo Parretti bribed officials of Credit Lyonnais bank, so they could obtain a credit to bid for MGM, and they were eventually jailed. (requires registration) Di Stefano says that the only consequence for him is that he was deported from the US. After being deported, Di Stefano migrated to Yugoslavia in fear of what the bank could make to him after causing such a loss of money. He says that he actually earned $249 million from the deal, at a time when he was still in his 30s. According to Di Stefano, in 1989 he bought Cinema Five UK, a chain of 50 cinemas, from MGM for only ¬£8 million, and he resold them for $249 million (¬£160 million) to Credit Lyonnais, and this is partly the basis of his personal fortune (In 2003 Di Stefano claimed to have a fortune of ¬£450 million.) The Scotsman says that MGM sued Di Stefano and won damages from him. In 1993, on behalf of Sandhurst Assets, Di Stefano offered to buy Viajes Meli√°, a Spanish travel agency owned by hotel chain Sol Meli√°, just as another company had retracted its buy offer. The company was heavily in debt, and Di Stefano offered only $100 million, promising to put forward $350 million (4,000 million pesetas at that time) to pay the debts once he was the owner, and further $50 million (around 575 million pesetas) in investments. Di Stefano was later arrested for fraud over dealings related to Sandhurst. In 1999 Di Stefano, conducting his business affairs from jail, started negotiations to buy for ¬£10 million the Ellington Colliery, a deep coal mine that was about to close, but he couldn't get the necessary permission from the Coal Authority. He eventually lost interest in the deal by 2000, when his associate Arkan was murdered.

Amsterdam is on Chocolate Bayou ten miles East of Angleton in east central Brazoria County. A post office operated there from 1897 until 1905, when mail was routed through Liverpool. The town shipped cotton to Galveston from area plantations and depended on water traffic in the 1890s. At its height around 1900, Amsterdam had a hotel and school. However, the Galveston hurricane of 1900 did considerable damage, and afterward the town failed to grow. State highway maps of 1936 showed only scattered dwellings at the townsite. By the 1970s construction of a nearby chemical plant had increased the number of local residences, and 1988 state highway maps showed several buildings. There was a fire station located in the town, but was closed down in the mid 1990s due to funding and lack of volunteers. In 2000 the population was 193. There have been several business come and go in the small area throughout the years. One of these business was the Old Amsterdam Restaurant. It was owned by Edith and Marvin Zajicek. The business was closed in the early 1990s due to Marvin Zajicek receiving a cancer diagnosis. There have also been many bars that have come and go throughout the years.

It is the sequel to Rollcage. On top of the basic racing concept, the cars can be equipped with weapons, which are picked up on the track as bonuses, which can be used against competing cars. The automobiles themselves, once again, have wheels that are larger than the body of the car thus creating a car that has no up or down and therefore can be flipped yet continue to drive. For the North American Windows release, game publisher Take-Two Interactive repackaged the original European/Australasian version as Death Track Racing. Rollcage Stage II was also among the very first titles to feature hardware-accelerated bump mapping upon its release in March 2000, in the form of EMBM (Environment Mapped Bump Mapping). RSII was designed to be best experienced at the time on Matrox Millennium G400 graphics cards, released in mid-1999, which had exclusive support for EMBM until the ATI Radeon was released in late 2000. Matrox's bump mapping technology was much hyped by industry press outlets at the time, with Matrox demoing Rollcage Stage II as a cutting-edge showcase for their cards, as well as dedicating a page on their website to the game. Reception Rollcage Stage II received \\"favourable\\" reviews, while Death Track Racing received \\"average\\" reviews, according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Daniel Erickson of Next Generation said of the former's European version, just over six months before its U.S. release date, \\"A wonderful surprise, Rollcage Stage II is everything Wipeout 3 should've been but wasn't.\\" Electronic Gaming Monthly, Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine, and Game Informer also gave the same European version average to positive reviews, also over six months before its U.S. release date. Spiritual successors While Attention To Detail (ATD) and Psygnosis did not continue on the Rollcage series after Rollcage Stage II, ATD later developed the game Firebugs featuring roughly the same racing concept. After the end of support by the developers and publishers, a former ATD developer who previously worked on the Rollcage games, Robert Baker, released in 2014 updated builds of the games' Windows versions. These builds, based on the original source code, fix longstanding bugs and update both games for use on modern operating systems: Rollcage Redux for Rollcage and Rollcage Extreme for Rollcage Stage II In 2015, Robert Baker approached former ATD and Rollcage teammate David Perryman to form Caged Element under the impulsion of entrepreneur Chris Mallinson. Caged Element launched a Kickstarter campaign for Grip, a spiritual successor for the Rollcage series. A prototype was completed before the Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign using Unreal Engine 4. The development staff has two people who worked on the Rollcage series and the soundtrack has artists Technical Itch and Dom & Roland who were on the soundtrack for Rollcage Stage II. Grip: Combat Racing was released in November 2018 for Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch.

She is also the Spiritual Leader and CEO of First Unity Spiritual Campus, a New Thought center in St. Petersburg, Florida. an Internationally Recognized Speaker, Radio Host, practicing Shamanic healer, and author of several books; including her critically acclaimed When Did You Die? Eight Steps to Stop Dying Every Day and Start Waking Up.  Early life  Named after her grandfather, Temple Ann Hayes was born in 1959 to a Southern Baptist family in Anderson, South Carolina. At the age of five, Temple had a spiritual awakening and knew at that young age that she was \\"different\\" and was being called into ministry. During these early years Temple found that she had a deep love for animals; frequently bringing orphaned or injured animals home with her. Rev Hayes states in her book that she \\"found God in nature, in music, and in the arts\\". Despite being told in the sixth grade that she would not amount to anything because she \\"talked too much\\"; Temple began to build her self-confidence through art, music, and sports. She began playing softball at the age of ten, and seventeen years later with a batting average of .686, Temple was nominated as an All-American and elected to the National Softball Hall of Fame in 1979. Amateur Softball Association of America. Coming of age during the 1970s, Temple‚Äôs early beliefs and philosophies were heavily influenced by the conflicting tides of Civil, Women‚Äôs, Gay, Animal, and Religious Rights. In her early teens, Temple became involved in a same sex relationship. When this was discovered, she had to learn to lie to herself and others about her sexual orientation. She would successfully hold up that lie for decades. It was during this time she developed an addiction to alcohol that would eventually interfere with every aspect of her life. Until one day when Temple was twenty, and after multiple automobile accidents, arrests, and physical injuries, Temple was invited to a Unity Church in Greenville, South Carolina. That experience began a shift in her, and within a few years, she had moved to a new city, stopped drinking, and became involved in group therapy meetings.  Career  Temple‚Äôs diverse background includes three years of military service in the United States Army Reserves and several years as a business owner. In 1991, she answered a long-standing call to the ministry and became a Church of Religious Science minister, moving to Florida to serve with various churches in Stuart, West Palm Beach, Sarasota and St. Petersburg. That same year, she launched herself as a motivational speaker and spent the next thirteen years traveling the United States and abroad for a variety of clients, including Procter and Gamble, Washington Mutual, State Farm Insurance, and Compaq. In addition, Temple's motivation and pursuit of excellence led to numerous awards; including being elected to Outstanding Young Women of America in 1988; to the International Who‚Äôs Who of American Professionals in 1997 and to the National Association of Professional Women in 2008. She has also been honored with the Footprints Award by the National Sigma Gamma Rho sorority for outstanding community service.  Ministry  In 2007, after years of study with teachers that aided her spiritual growth, Temple became an ordained Unity Minister. Rev Temple Hayes is now the beloved Spiritual Leader at First Unity Spiritual Campus in St. Petersburg, Florida where she is also Minister of First Unity Church. Rev Temple is also the founder of several grass roots organizations recognizing the rights of all living beings.Harper, Jean \\"A Difference to Make\\" Moxy Woman Magazine November 2007  Ideas and teachings  Much of Temple Hayes' teachings focuses on spirituality and metaphysics and the philosophical underpinning that ‚ÄúGod is good all the time for everybody‚Äù and every body includes all life ‚Äî men, women, children, animals, nature, insects‚Äî and their inalienable rights to live fully and pursue their dreams regardless of their creed, their color, their nationality, their sex, their sexual orientation, or their religious affiliation. She believes it‚Äôs time for the religious right and the spiritual left to come together and embrace all God‚Äôs children and creations. \\"We teach people how to think, not what to think, and folks find that appealing,\\" Hayes says. \\"But we do make sure to tell people that, while the mind is a powerful way to get what you want, you may face some pain along the way. Nothing comes easy.\\" The general theme of her thoughts, like that of her favorite mystic and Sufi poet Rumi is essentially the concept of unity with God, and ‚Äúthough sometimes in life we‚Äôre challenged as we walk through the valley of the shadow of death, we need to remember it is but a shadow and the way out is the way through into the light. We can reconnect and live fully with our desire for oneness.‚Äù First Unity website Temple Hayes is recognized as a rising star in Unity and the New Thought movement.

Biography Born in Osterwick, Germany near M√ºnster, he became a cabinet maker like his father and an apprentice at the age of 13. He was drafted into the army at the age of 20, but deserted during the German Revolution of 1848 and immigrated to the United States in 1849. Living in New York City, he worked first as a carpenter and then as a grocery clerk. In a few years, Lembeck set up his own successful grocery business. It was then that he met a successful brewer, John F. Betz, selling his beer in his store.Jersey City - Past and Present, accessed December 29, 2007 In 1869, Lembeck moved across the river and established a brewery with Betz in downtown Jersey City, New Jersey. The Lembeck and Betz Eagle Brewing Company would develop into one of the most successful breweries in the eastern United States producing a quarter of a million barrels of beer a year. As Lembeck grew financially successful, he also helped establish banks and real estate companies in Jersey City. Lembeck was the founder of the Greenville Banking and Trust Company and a director of the Third National Bank. He helped develop the township of Greenville (today it's a section of Jersey City) through real estate development of undeveloped land. Lembeck discontinued home building over a dispute with the city regarding the quality of water supplied to the Greenville area. After his retirement his son Gustav took over running the brewery. The brewery closed during Prohibition in 1920 and later went out of business. He lived in Greenville with his wife Emma and children in a mansion on Columbia Place, which has since been renamed Lembeck Avenue. Lembeck died in Jersey City and is buried in Bayview ‚Äì New York Bay Cemetery in Jersey City. The Lembeck mansion was later donated by his widow to St. Anne's Home for the Aged.

The island is approximately in size, and is located southeast of Saint Thomas. There is one estate on Great Saint James. The island has most notably been owned by financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, along with the neighboring Little Saint James island. The cove on the west side of Great Saint James, Christmas Cove, is a popular snorkeling and mooring spot for day charter boats and yachts. 22 overnight mooring balls are available (but are not regularly maintained).  History  Great Saint James was worth US$3 million at one point when a woman owned it. She later died in a Swiss chalet. The island was subsequently divided into parcels and three people inherited it. Family members of the Danish politician had owned Great Saint James since the late 1970s. Miami Dolphins player Jason Taylor purchased the island with assistance from real estate businessmen Robert Addie and Jorge M. P√©rez in 2004. However, a lawsuit exchange ensued and lasted until December 2013 when Taylor received \\"much but not all\\" of his down payment, as reported by the Miami Herald. = Jeffrey Epstein = Great Saint James was purchased in 2016 for US$22.5 million by financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein had already owned the neighboring Little Saint James island. B.T. has reported that at some point while Kj√¶r owned of the island, Epstein had attempted to purchase the island, but that the sale had not gone through, partially because islanders \\"begged\\" Kj√¶r and his wife Susan Astani not to sell the land to Epstein. Astani said that at the time there were rumors about Epstein's \\"sexual preferences\\". In order to conceal his identity, Epstein made Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem the ultimate beneficial owner against his will and purchased Kj√¶r's three parcels through his shell corporation Great St. Jim LLC, for US$17.5 million on January 18, 2016. He bought the rest of the island (twelve parcels totalling ) through the same LLC from GSJ Properties Corp. for US$5 million on January 21, 2016. Epstein has been in conflict with the Virgin Islands Department of Planning and Natural Resources (DPNR) over land use regulations. DPNR Commissioner Jean-Pierre Oriol has said, \\"Since there's been an active owner of the island, there's been construction within three months of that, so it's been pretty active.\\" Great St. Jim LLC has authorized several officers of Epstein's nonprofit Gratitude America Ltd. to act on behalf of Poplar Inc., whose president is Epstein according to an incumbency certificate, with respect to all transactions including those related to permitting matters. In April 2016, after DPNR received complaints about Epstein clearing the island without a permit, a cease and desist was ordered and Great St. Jim LLC was initially fined US$280,000, but Epstein settled for a US$70,000 fine. Epstein also sent US$320,000 in total in checks through his foundations to the non-profit Saint Thomas Historical Trust in order to circumvent fines by the government, however, Epstein had reportedly misunderstood an order to send a part of the settlement to a local preservation project. According to a lawyer for Epstein, the donations were returned to Epstein by DPNR employees in 2017. Historical Trust's president Malcolm Schweizer said in August 2019: \\"If any agreement was made with Epstein on behalf of the St. Thomas Historical Trust to return the funds, it was done fraudulently and without our knowledge. I still plan to pursue return of the entire $320,000 to the St. Thomas Historical Trust, and am awaiting the results of an investigation by the FBI before I take further action\\". Epstein was issued another cease and desist order by DPNR on October 28, 2016, for not permitted \\"development in the coastal zone\\". The Virgin Islands Daily News have reported communication between Epstein's staff and DPNR regarding building plan permits and permit applications. Documents and plans show a private road, \\"a barge dock, two homes, cottages, an amphitheater, gardens, a marine electrical cable, solar array and generator, storage building, security building, work-shed and machine shop and an 'underwater office & pool'. The permit application addresses mitigation efforts for endangered corals and the Virgin Islands tree boa, which was spotted on the island during site visits, and indicates that the public will still have free access to the island's shoreline, which includes Christmas Cove\\". According to New York magazine, Epstein \\"shut down Christmas Cove\\" after he purchased the island. On December 21, 2018, Epstein received a stop-work order from Coastal Zone Management. He was subsequently accused of violating the order \\"by not removing a beach bar cabana and by expanding a driveway\\", according to The New York Times. DPNR Commissioner Jean-Pierre Oriol has said that Epstein could be fined over US$1 million for construction activity including \\"an excessive amount of additional roadways that have been carved out on the island, [for] there have been two jetties, fill material has been placed into the submerged lands, so there's evidence of work going beyond what was initially applied for. The exact amount of things is still yet to be determined\\". According to The Virgin Islands Daily News, photos on social media showed construction work around June 2019. By July 2019, Coastal Zone Management and Epstein's representatives agreed to a site visit for inspection. They had been working to resolve environmental issues such as those that had arisen from erosion and cutting a road. DPNR Assistant Commissioner Keith Richards said that \\"Epstein's representatives [had] applied for at least four minor permits\\", but that \\"only one minor permit for the construction of a flagpole and repair of cisterns [had] been approved\\". Coastal Zone Management ordered one of the jetties to be removed. Around July 2019, the United States Environmental Protection Agency visited Great Saint James. Epstein was arrested in July 2019 and admitted in an affidavit that he owned Great Saint James. After Epstein's reported suicide in August 2019, multiple permits were still pending. A survey company owned by a civil engineering companies owner from Saint Croix applied for a temporary barge landing permit to allow construction work. The owner, Jeffrey Bateman, said of Epstein: \\"He just had a lot of money. People with a lot of money can buy islands\\". Epstein had not built anything on Great Saint James prior to his death.

The island was owned by American convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein from 1998 until his 2019 death. During Epstein's ownership, the island acquired local nicknames such as \\"Island of Sin\\" and \\"Pedophile Island,\\" as it was alleged to be a location where sexual abuse of underage girls occurred. Ownership Little Saint James Island in the Virgin Islands, while owned by Jeffrey Epstein In 1997, Little St. James was owned by venture capitalist Arch Cummin and was for sale for $10.5 million. In April 1998, a company called L.S.J. LLC purchased the island for $7.95 million, and documents showed that Jeffrey Epstein was the sole member of L.S.J. In 2019, the island was valued at $63,874,223. The island was Epstein's primary residence and he called the island \\"Little St. Jeff\\". The main house on the island was renovated by Edward Tuttle, a designer of the Aman Resorts. In 2008, Epstein's estate on Little Saint James had 70 staff. According to a former staffer, Epstein insisted on secrecy from his employees. In 1997, the island had a main house, three guest cottages, a caretaker's cottage, a private desalination system, a helipad and a dock. In addition, there is also a blue-striped boxlike building that initially was topped by a golden dome. The purpose of this construction is unclear, as it deviates in substantial ways from the plans for the music pavilion that had been submitted for approval in 2010 by Epstein's architects. The original building in the plans was of an octagonal footprint, rectangular in cross- section, and had two side-rooms extending from the outside walls - It was also much lower in perspective, and the dome extended from the octagon over onto the roofs of the side-buildings. The building that was eventually constructed was much taller, in the shape of a cube, and did not have any side-rooms. The dome was also well within the footprint of the cube, and the building did not have any of the proposed finishes applied to the walls, nor was it constructed out of materials in those plans, namely stone. Visitors According to a former employee, Victoria's Secret models were among the guests he saw there, and Les Wexner visited the island at least once. According to flight logs, Prince Andrew, Duke of York paid at least one visit aboard Epstein's private jet to the island, although former staff claimed he visited Little St. James several times. In March 2006, before Epstein was charged with unlawful sexual activity with a minor, Stephen Hawking visited the island with a group of particle physicists, cosmologists and theorists, including three Nobel laureates and experts on gravity, dark matter and string theory. All had been invited to attend a conference funded by Epstein. A March 2006 photograph on Little St. James shows Hawking, David Gross and Lisa Randall at a barbecue during the conference. Other visitors have included Gerard 't Hooft, Frank Wilczek, Lawrence Krauss and Martin Nowak. Krauss said most of the conference took place on the neighbouring island of St. Thomas, but Epstein had thrown a party on Little St. James. Bill Clinton is widely reported to have visited Little St. James. According to The Independent, Clinton flew on Epstein's private jet to Little St. James on multiple occasions between 2002 and 2005. According to Newsweek, Bill Clinton had been to Little St. James as part of Epstein's circle. Virginia Roberts, later known as Virginia Giuffre, claims in a lawsuit that while working at Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort she was lured into a sex-trafficking ring run by Epstein and while traveling with Epstein she saw Clinton on the island. In a 2011 conversation with her lawyers, Roberts claimed Clinton traveled to Epstein's retreat on Little St. James in 2002. A Freedom of Information Act request for Secret Service records of visits Clinton may have made to Little St. James produced no such evidence. According to Epstein's flight logs, Clinton never flew near the U.S. Virgin Islands. In July 2019, a Clinton spokesperson issued a statement saying Clinton never visited the island. According to People magazine, David Copperfield proposed to Claudia Schiffer on Little St. James, three months after meeting her in 1993. Alleged sexual abuse According to The Independent, \\"Epstein's island developed a reputation for depravity, and it is alleged that underage girls were made to take part in orgies on Little St. James.\\" It has acquired such nicknames as \\"Island of Sin,\\" \\"Pedophile Island,\\" and \\"Orgy Island\\". According to attorneys for Epstein's alleged victims, Little St. James is where many of the worst crimes against minors were committed by Epstein and friends who traveled there with him. Court documents allege that the then 17-year-old Virginia Roberts was forced by Epstein to have sex with Prince Andrew on three occasions ‚Äì in London, New York, and as part of an orgy on Little St. James. Buckingham Palace has denied this allegation. A lawyer for Epstein has described the allegations of orgies by Roberts as \\"old and discredited\\".

MacColl is also apparently an uncommon male Scottish given name, perhaps meaning \\"Son of Coll\\" and spelled without CamelCase, i.e. as \\"Maccoll\\". Origin and Clan MacColl The surname 'MacColl' may have its origin in a Scottish clan by the name of Clan MacColl, which had a historical association with the sea loch Loch Fyne, located in the modern day unitary council area of Argyll and Bute. Clan MacColl may be a branch of Clan Donald (MacDonald), albeit a small one, based on several lines of evidence including a shared badge (sprig of heather). In the year 1602, Clan MacColl lost most of their military force in a battle with Clan MacPherson. Additional lines of MacColls no doubt exist. For instance, a new line was made possible in 1940's England when James Henry Miller changed his name to Ewan MacColl. This new line was established with the birth of his children in the 1950s and passage to a third generation through (at least) children of Kirsty MacColl.This passage is a synthesis from information available in the linked biographical articles. Distribution According to United States Census data from 1840, 1880 and 1920, the MacColl surname was not recorded as present in the United States in 1840, was found only in New York by 1880, and had spread, albeit thinly, to the West Coast by 1920. Meanwhile, according to 1891 census date from England and Wales, MacColls were found in five counties in the north and east of England, with the greatest number identified in Lancashire and London.

Schurman remained loyal to Britain during the American revolution and, in 1783, immigrated to Tryon on St. John's Island (later Prince Edward Island). He settled at Bedeque the following year, setting up a store in his house and engaging in trade with a ship that he owned. Besides serving in the colony's assembly, he was also a justice of the peace and overseer for roads. After losing his ship in 1799, Schurman became involved in shipbuilding. In 1808, he bought a wooded area along the Wilmot River, constructed a sawmill and entered into the trade in lumber. He died at his home in the Wilmot Valley in 1819.

She is sometimes regarded as the 'first English frigate', although a number of vessels built or acquired earlier (during the 1630s and 1640s) also merit a similar description. The term 'frigate' during the period of this ship referred to a method of construction, rather than a role which did not develop until the following century. Service history Constant Warwick was not built for the Navy, but was built as a privateer for a consortium which included the Earl of Warwick (hence her name) and Sir William Batten (Surveyor of the Navy), but was hired by the navy from 1646 until 20 January 1649, when she was purchased outright. She was rebuilt at least once. Her original dimensions altered by 1660, evidence that she may have seen structural changes during the 1650s. She was certainly rebuilt by Sir John Tippetts at Portsmouth Dockyard in 1666 as a 42-gun fourth rate ship of the line. Her armament had been reduced to 40 guns by 1685, with eighteen demi-culverins (drakes) on the lower deck, eighteen sakers (6-pounder guns) on the upper deck, and four 3-pounder guns on the quarter deck. She was downgraded to a fifth rate in 1691, scheduled to be reduced to 28 guns, but before this took effect she was captured on 12 July 1691 off Portugal by a French squadron.

Born in Santiago de Cuba, Chib√°s spent his childhood in Havana and attended the University of Havana. His older brother, Eduardo, founded and led the Orthodox Party (also known as the Cuban People's Party) in 1947. After Eduardo committed suicide in 1951, Ra√∫l took over as party leader. Chib√°s vehemently opposed the rule of Fulgencio Batista in the 1950s, and he supported the anti-Batista struggle of Fidel Castro. In July 1957, he signed the Sierra Manifesto, which proclaimed unity of the disparate anti-Batista groups. He served various positions for Castro's government after the revolution, including railroad commissioner, trial judge and Minister of Finance. He was a Major of the Cuban Army in 1960 when he decided to defect to the United States via a motor boat to Miami. Chib√°s felt that Castro had betrayed the ideals of the revolution. Chib√°s became an active anti-Castro activist in the United States. In 1960, he joined a group of former Castro aides in issuing a joint 3500-word manifesto calling for the overthrow of the Cuban leader. He found employment teaching Spanish at a school in New York City. After 20 years of living in America, Chib√°s moved to Caracas, Venezuela to join two of his children. In 1991, having spent 10 years in Venezuela, he moved to Miami, where he spent the rest of his life.

Legacy Although Morbid only officially released those two demos, they gained a certain cult status after their demise, most likely due in part to Ohlin's efforts with Mayhem. Both the demo recordings and various live and rehearsal tracks have later made it onto vinyl and CD, on both official and bootleg releases. After the departure from Ohlin moving to Krakstad, he was replaced by Former Singer, John Scarisbrick. Not much is known of John and his departure from Morbid since the band was so short lasting and quite unknown back then, but what we do know of currently is that John is now a Photographer, hes collaborated over Europe, Sweden, and even the states.

At present the principal trade of the town is that of paddy and rice, and there are many rice mills. History In 710 AD, Muhammad bin Qasim conquered the Sindh and Balochistan. Later the Delhi Sultanate and later Mughal Empire ruled the region. Sindh became predominantly Muslim due to missionary Sufi saints whose dargahs dot the landscape of Sindh. Ratodero is considered about 350 years old. During British rule Ratodero became a Taluka of Larkana District and for a period part of the Bombay Presidency. The population according to the 1891 census of India was 61,268, which rose to 72,312 at the next census in 1901[1].

The land revenue and cesses in 1903-4 amounted to more than 2-9 lakhs.The great Sukkur Wah (the Canal leading from the Indus) once flown near the Saint Nadar Shah, was a main source of irrigation and trade port. Merchants used to trade with Sukkur and other adjacent towns through the boats via this canal. It contains about 104 square miles (270 km2) of \`reserved' forest\\".

In a 1998 interview, Al Jazeera, he gave his birth date as 10 March 1957. His father was Mohammed bin Laden, from Yemen. Before World War I, Mohammed had emigrated from Hadhramaut, on the south coast of Yemen, to the Red Sea port of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, where he began to work as a porter. Starting his own business in 1930, Mohammed built his fortune as a building contractor for the Saudi royal family during the 1950s. Though there is no definitive account of the number of children born to Mohammed bin Laden, it is generally put at 58.9/11 report Mohammed bin Laden was married 22 times, although to no more than four women at a time per Sharia law.

Bin Laden's parents divorced soon after he was born, according to Khaled M. Batarfi, a senior editor at the Al Madina newspaper in Jeddah who knew him during the 1970s. Bin Laden's mother then married a man named Muhammad al- Attas, who worked at the bin Laden company. The couple had four children, and bin Laden lived in the new household with three half-brothers and one half- sister. Education and politicization Brummana High School, circa 1886 ‚Äì According to some former administrators and students, Osama bin Laden attended Brummana for less than one year Osama bin Laden was raised as a devout Sunni Muslim. Bin Laden's father ensured that he was regularly attending school. Bin Laden attended schools with some Western curricula and culture. No evidence has been found that he ever received full-time education in a religious madrassa. He was likely educated for some of his primary school years in Syria and that may have been in connection to his mother's frequent visits to Latakia, Syria. By the time bin Laden was an 8th grader, \\"he was a solid if unspectacular student\\". His mother remembered that he was \\"not an A student. He would pass exams with average grades.\\"Coll 140 In the mid-1960s, around age 10, bin Laden briefly attended Brummana High School, a Quaker institution in Brummana, Lebanon, along with several of his half brothers. Five former administrators and students said he attended for less than a year before returning home; they did not say or recall why he left, but his leaving was not due to poor behavior or grades.Coll 140‚Äì141 Renee Bazz, a former administrative staff member, said that bin Laden went to another school in Lebanon before he attended Brummana.Coll 141 British comedian and journalist Dom Joly claimed on an episode of BBC's Would I Lie To You? that he attended Brummana High School with bin Laden. He seemed to have stayed in Latakia for a period. He moved back to Jeddah in the following September.

In the 1960s, King Faisal had welcomed exiled teachers from Syria, Egypt, and Jordan, so that by the early seventies it was common to find members of the Muslim Brotherhood teaching at Saudi schools and universities. During that time, bin Laden became a member of the Brotherhood and attended its political teachings during after- school Islamic study groups. Bin Laden earned a degree in civil engineering in 1979 from King Abdulaziz University in Jeddah. Despite his major subject, at university his main interest was religion; he was involved in both in interpreting the Quran and charitable work.Wright, Looming Tower, (2006), p.79 A close friend reports, \\"we read Sayyid Qutb. He was the one who most affected our generation.\\" Mohammed Jamal Khalifa in Wright, Looming Tower, (2006), p.79 Sayyid Qutb himself, author of Ma'alim fi-l-Tariq, or Milestones, one of the most influential tracts on the importance of jihad against all that is un- Islamic in the world, was deceased, but his brother and publicizer of his work, Muhammad Qutb, lectured regularly at the university. So did another charismatic Muslim Brotherhood member, Abdallah Azzam, an Islamic scholar from Palestine who was instrumental in building pan-Islamic enthusiasm for jihad against the Soviets in Afghanistan and in drawing Muslims (like Osama) from all over the Middle East to fight there.Kepel, Jihad (2002), p.145‚Äì147 Bin Laden was described by University friend Jamal Khalifa as extremely religious. Neither man watched films nor listened to popular music, because they believed such activities went against the teachings of the Qur'an. During his University career he witnessed many world-changing events, especially in 1979. First he watched the Iranian Revolution, in which Ayatollah Khomieini overthrew Iran‚Äôs Western supported government to install an Islamist state. Then he saw the seizure of the Grand Mosque in Mecca by radicals in Saudi Arabia and the Saudi government‚Äôs dependent response and reliance on Western power. It was not until the French special forces came in that the government was able to regain control of Mecca‚Äôs holiest site. Bin Laden was disgusted with his government‚Äôs lack of ability to protect the sacred city, and he began to see the royal family more and more as corrupt. Finally, he ended 1979 ready to fight off the invading Soviets in Afghanistan. In regard to his Islamic learning, bin Laden was sometimes referred to as a \\"sheikh\\", considered by some to be \\"well versed in the classical scriptures and traditions of Islam\\",Messages to the World: The Statements of Osama bin Laden Verso, 2005, p.xvi and was said to have been mentored by scholars such as Musa al- Qarni.Musa al-Qarni on Jihad He had no formal training in Islamic jurisprudence, however, and was criticized by Islamic scholars as having no standing to issue religious opinions (fatwa). Bin Laden is reported to have married at least five women, although he later divorced the first two. Three of Osama bin Laden's wives were university lecturers, highly educated, from distinguished families. According to Wisal al Turabi, bin Laden married them because they were \\"spinsters\\", who \\"were going to go without marrying in this world. So he married them for the Word of God\\".

According to Abu Jandal, bin Laden's former chief bodyguard, while living in Sudan, Umm Ali asked bin Laden for a divorce because she said that she \\"could not continue to live in an austere way and in hardship\\". #Khairiah Saber, also known as Umm Hamza (mother of Hamza).

The children of his first wife, Najwa, include Abdallah (born c. 1976), Omar, Saad and Mohammed. His son Mohammed Babrak bin Laden (born c. 1983) married the daughter of the former al-Qaeda military chief Mohammed Atef (also called Abu Haf) in January 2001, at Kandahar.Wright, Looming Tower, (2006), p.333-4 Appearance and behavior The FBI described Osama bin Laden as tall and thin, between and in height and weighing about .

He wore a plain white turban and did not wear the traditional Saudi male headdress, generally white. In terms of personality, bin Laden was described as a soft-spoken, mild mannered man. His soft voice was also a function of necessity. Interviews with reporters had reportedly left his vocal cords inflamed and bin Laden unable to speak the following day. His bodyguard contended Soviet chemical weapons were to blame for this malady; reporters have speculated that kidney disease was the cause.Wright, Looming Tower (2006), p.263 The author Adam Robinson has alleged that bin Laden supported Arsenal Football Club, visiting the team's stadium twice when he visited London in 1994. Bin Laden's \\"wealth and generosity ... simplicity of ... behaviour, personal charm and ... bravery in battle\\" have been described as \\"legendary.\\"Kepel, Jihad, (2002), p.315 According to Michael Scheuer, bin Laden claims to speak only Arabic. In a 1998 interview, he had the English questions translated into Arabic.

Bin Laden was known for his media savvy, using the Islamic imagery of the cave in Tora Bora \\"as a way of identifying himself with the prophet in the minds of many Muslims,\\" despite the fact the caves in question were tunnels dug with the modern technology of earth moving machinery to store ammunition.Wright, Looming Tower, (2006), p.233 He had dyed his beard to cover the streaks of gray.Videos destroy aura: Osama rehearsing lines, dyeing beard - The Times of India.

Compare Old Book of Tang, vol. 73 with New Book of Tang, vol. 102. formally Baron Kang of Fengcheng (Ë±êÊàêÂ∫∑Áî∑), was an official of the Chinese dynasties Sui Dynasty and Tang Dynasty and was the lead author of the Book of Liang and Book of Chen, official histories of Liang Dynasty and Chen Dynasty, which his father Yao Cha (ÂßöÂØü), a Chen official, had begun but did not finish.  Background  It is not known when Yao Silian was born, other than that it was during Chen Dynasty. His father Yao Cha was the minister of civil service affairs during Chen, and after Chen's destruction by rival Sui Dynasty in 589, Yao Cha moved his family from Wuxing (Âê≥Ëàà, in modern Huzhou, Zhejiang) to the Sui capital Daxing (Chang'an), successively serving as an advisor to Emperor Wen of Sui's crown prince Yang Yong and the secretary general of the Palace Library, carrying the title of Duke of Beijiang. During Yao Cha's life, he had begun to write the histories of Chen and its predecessor Liang Dynasty, but was unable to complete it before his death.Old Book of Tang, vol. 73. New Book of Tang, vol. 102. Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 184, 189, 191, 192, 194 Yao Silian studied the Book of Han under his father when he was young. It was said that he had few desires other than to study. Prior to Chen's destruction, he served as the secretary to Chen Zhuang (Èô≥Ëéä) the Prince of Kuaiji, a son of Chen's last emperor Chen Shubao.  During Sui Dynasty  After Chen's destruction, Yao Silian served as a military advisor to Emperor Wen's son Yang Liang the Prince of Han. At some point, due to Yao Cha's death, he resigned to observe a mourning period. He thereafter served as a secretary at the government of Hejian Commandery (Ê≤≥Èñì, roughly modern Baoding, Hebei). He requested permission from Emperor Wen's son and successor Emperor Yang to continue writing the histories of Liang and Chen that Yao Cha had started, and Emperor Yang agreed. Emperor Yang further ordered him and another official, Cui Zujun (Â¥îÁ•ñÊø¨), to lead a team of scholars in drafting regional maps and histories. He later served as a teacher of Emperor Yang's grandson Yang You the Prince of Dai. By 617, the Sui state was engulfed by agrarian rebellions, and Emperor Yang was in Jiangdu (Ê±üÈÉΩ, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu), leaving Yang You nominally in charge of Chang'an, when the general Li Yuan the Duke of Tang started a rebellion and attacked Chang'an, claiming that his intent was to make Yang You emperor. When Chang'an fell in winter 617, it was said that Yang You's staff all fled, except for Yao Silian, who stayed with Yang You, and as Li Yuan's soldiers entered Yang You's mansion, yelled out sternly, \\"The Duke of Tang started his uprising in order to secure the imperial clan. You cannot be impolite to the Prince.\\" The soldiers backed off. Li Yuan was impressed with Yao's dedication to Yang You, and while he still had Yang You seized by his own subordinates, allowed Yao to accompany Yang You to Shunyang Pavilion (È†ÜÈôΩÈñ£) before leaving. People who witnessed the event commented, \\"It is said that kind people are also brave. This man is an example.\\" Li Yuan soon declared Yang You emperor (as Emperor Gong), but after receiving news in 618 that Emperor Yang had been killed in a coup at Jiangdu led by the general Yuwen Huaji, had Yang You yield the throne to him, establishing Tang Dynasty as its Emperor Gaozu.  During Tang Dynasty  After the founding of Tang Dynasty, Yao Silian served as a scholar at the mansion of Emperor Gaozu's son and leading general Li Shimin the Prince of Qin. Later, when Li Shimin was on a campaign against a rival agrarian rebel ruler, Xu Yuanlang the Prince of Lu, Li Shimin had some discussions with others about the events during Sui Dynasty, and he commented, \\"Yao Silian dared to stand up to swords to show his faithfulness, and this was difficult even in ancient days.\\" At that time, Yao was not with him, but was at Luoyang. Li Shimin sent a messenger to Luoyang to award Yao with silk, stating, \\"I have just remembered your faithfulness and righteousness and I am now awarding you for them.\\" In 626, Li Shimin, then locked in an intense rivalry with his brother Li Jiancheng the Crown Prince, ambushed and killed Li Jiancheng and another brother who supported Li Jiancheng, Li Yuanji the Prince of Qi, at Xuanwu Gate. He then effectively forced Emperor Gaozu to create him crown prince and then yield the throne to him (as Emperor Taizong). Yao became an imperial scholar at the institute Hongwen Pavilion (ÂºòÊñáÈ§®). Emperor Taizong had him continue the compilation of the histories of Liang and Chen, under supervision by the chancellor Wei Zheng. Yao, taking in also commentaries that had been written by Xie Gui (Ë¨ùÁÇÖ) and Gu Yewang (È°ßÈáéÁéã), completed the works in 636, and Emperor Taizong awarded him with silk and promoted him to be Tongzhi Sanqi Changshi (ÈÄöÁõ¥Êï£È®éÂ∏∏‰æç), a senior advisor at the examination bureau of government (ÈñÄ‰∏ãÁúÅ, Menxia Sheng). It was said that Yao was faithful and gave honest advice whenever needed. In 632, for example, there was an occasion when Emperor Taizong was about to visit the summer palace Jiucheng Palace (‰πùÊàêÂÆÆ, in modern Baoji, Shaanxi), when Yao argued against it, opining that visiting secondary palaces was something that Qin Shi Huang and Emperor Wu of Han did, not what rulers who were even better regarded‚Äîthe legendary Emperor Yao, Emperor Shun, Yu the Great, and Tang of Shang did. Emperor Taizong, while citing that he was going to Jiucheng Palace to avoid an asthma attack, nevertheless awarded Yao with silk. In 635, he created Yao the Baron of Fengcheng. Yao died in 637 and was buried with honor, near the tomb of Emperor Taizong's wife Empress Zhangsun, where Emperor Taizong himself would eventually be buried. His grandson Yao Shu would later serve as a chancellor during the reign of Emperor Taizong's daughter-in-law Wu Zetian.

Records on her improbably state that she had been exiled by Joseph Stalin 50 years prior to their meeting. Party official Polvin insists that Valentina is actually a descendant of the exiled woman. Ilyanov and mayor Titov search an abandoned church together and hear a wolf wailing in the distance. Ilyanov follows the sound and finds Valentina feasting on the wolf's blood. He is knocked unconscious and upon awakening he insists upon returning to the abandoned church. Inside, he finds a multitude of empty coffins and Valentina and Polvin appear. They explain that they are vampires. Titov explains that the townspeople have agreed to give sanctuary to vampires from all over Europe in exchange for protection from criminals and wild animals. Valentina wants to kill Ilyanov but Titov warns it will bring more intruders. Titov offers to make Ilyanov sympathetic to their situation, but Ilyanov flees the church with Titov instead. However, they are both attacked by wolves and Titov is mortally wounded. Titov dies, Ilyanov surrenders and Valentina offers him a mission that will benefit both the vampires and the state. Ilyanov returns to Moscow and briefs his superiors about the investigation. Titov is posthumously accused of being the murderer and Polvin is appointed mayor.

It has a population of 3554 (2008). It lies in the historical region of Cieszyn Silesia.  History  The village was first mentioned in a Latin document of Diocese of Wroc≈Çaw called Liber fundationis episcopatus Vratislaviensis from around 1305 as Item in Gorki villa vlodari. It was written in an atypical form and suggests that a village was much older. The reason why it was inscribed to the document was connected to a process of extracting of a part of the village, which belonged wholly to dukes, to form a new village given to a knight. The part which remained in dukes hand was later called G√≥rki Ma≈Çe, while a knights' part G√≥rki Wielkie. As so a village of G√≥rki (Ma≈Çe) functioned probably before 1290, when the Duchy of Teschen was formed (where both belonged ever since). From it was extracted a knights' villages which was then first mentioned in Liber fundationis...I. Panic, 2010, p. 290 Politically the village belonged initially to the Duchy of Teschen, formed in 1290 in the process of feudal fragmentation of Poland and was ruled by a local branch of Piast dynasty. In 1327 the duchy became a fee of Kingdom of Bohemia, which after 1526 became part of the Habsburg Monarchy. The village became a seat of a Catholic parish, mentioned in the register of Peter's Pence payment from 1447 among 50 parishes of Teschen deanery as Gorky. After the 1540s Protestant Reformation prevailed in the Duchy of Teschen and a local Catholic church was taken over by Lutherans. It was taken from them (as one of around fifty buildings) in the region by a special commission and given back to the Roman Catholic Church on 18 April 1654. After Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire a modern municipal division was introduced in the re- established Austrian Silesia. The village as a municipality was subscribed to the political district of Bielsko and the legal district of Skocz√≥w. According to the censuses conducted in 1880, 1890, 1900 and 1910 the population of the municipality dropped from 1036 in 1880 to 1034 in 1910, with majority of the inhabitants being native Polish-speakers (98%-100%) and mostly Roman Catholics (83.4% in 1910), followed by Protestants (15.8% in 1910) and Jews (9 people). The village was also traditionally inhabited by Cieszyn Vlachs, speaking Cieszyn Silesian dialect. After World War I, fall of Austria-Hungary, Polish‚ÄìCzechoslovak War and the division of Cieszyn Silesia in 1920, it became a part of Poland.

The city of Sialkot, which is one of the oldest cities of Pakistan, has historical significance due to the Fort. Historian Diayas Jee has stated that Raja S√°lb√°n, a Puar Rajput re-established Sialkot city around the 2nd century CE. and ruled over the area between the rivers Ravi and Chenab. S√°lb√°n built the Sialkot Fort in two years (which, at the time, had double walls) for the defense of the city. Raja S√°lb√°n, supposedly, used more than 10,000 laborers and masons for the repair and extension of the Fort with stone slabs and rocks which were brought to the location from Pathankot From 1179 to 1186, Shahab ud-Din Ghori ruled Lahore and Sindh. With the help of the Raja of Jammu, he captured the Sialkot Fort. The Sialkot Fort was given to the Janjua tribes by Sultan Firuz Shah Tughluq who accepted their suzerainty in that region around late 14th century CE. Rashid Niaz, another historian who has authored Tareekh-i-Sialkot, has written that the second wall of the ancient Sialkot Fort was discovered by the Sialkot Municipal Corporation in 1923 while carrying out civil works in the city. At that time, archaeology experts from Taxila and Delhi visited Sialkot and confirmed that the stone wall (faseel) was 5,000 years old. Later, that wall was re-buried. At present, few ruins, including a bastion, are all that is left of the Fort. Among the many ills plaguing it is the growing number of encroachments which are a blot on its face. The offices of the district government are located on the premises of the Fort.

It has a population of 768 (2008). It lies in the historical region of Cieszyn Silesia.  History  A Latin document of Diocese of Wroc≈Çaw called Liber fundationis episcopatus Vratislaviensis from around 1305 lists Gorki villa vlodari thus mentioning what is now G√≥rki Wielkie for the first time. However, it was written in an atypical form and suggests that a village was much older. The reason why it was inscribed to the document was connected to a process of extracting of a part of the village, which belonged wholly to dukes, to form a new village given to a knight. The part which remained in dukes hand was later called G√≥rki Ma≈Çe, while a knight's part G√≥rki Wielkie. As so a village of G√≥rki (Ma≈Çe) functioned probably before 1290, when the Duchy of Teschen was formed (where both belonged ever since). From it was extracted a knights' villages which was then first mentioned in Liber fundationis...I. Panic, 2010, p. 290 Explicitly it was later mentioned as [from] malych Gurek in 1566. Politically both villages belonged initially to the Duchy of Teschen, formed in 1290 in the process of feudal fragmentation of Poland and was ruled by a local branch of Piast dynasty. In 1327 the duchy became a fee of the Kingdom of Bohemia, which after 1526 became part of the Habsburg Monarchy. In years 1573/1577‚Äì1594 it belonged to Skocz√≥w-Strumie≈Ñ state country that was split from the Duchy of Teschen but was later purchased back. Since 1653 it belonged to Teschener Kammer. After Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire a modern municipal division was introduced in the re- established Austrian Silesia. The village as a municipality was subscribed to the political district of Bielsko and the legal district of Skocz√≥w. According to the censuses conducted in 1880, 1890, 1900 and 1910 the population of the municipality dropped from 351 in 1880 to 329 in 1910, with majority of the inhabitants being native Polish-speakers (98.3%-100%) and mostly Roman Catholics (90.6% in 1910), followed by Protestants (9.4% in 1910). The village was also traditionally inhabited by Cieszyn Vlachs, speaking Cieszyn Silesian dialect. After World War I, fall of Austria-Hungary, Polish‚ÄìCzechoslovak War and the division of Cieszyn Silesia in 1920, it became a part of Poland. It was then annexed by Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II. After the war it was restored to Poland.

(1978-2005) was an image processing company that developed real- time hardware and software products for the industrial, medical, military and scientific markets. Early history Datacube was founded in the mid-1970s by Stanley Karandanis and J Stewart Dunn. In the early days, Datacube manufactured board level products for the Multibus, which was one of the first computer buses developed for microprocessors. Early boards designed by Dunn were PROM, RAM and character generator boards. Of these, character display boards such as the VT103 and VR107 were the best sellers, and were used in programmable read-only memory (PROM) programmers and similar systems. Karandanis, Datacube's president and CEO, in his early career followed the leaders in the semiconductor field from Bell Labs through Transitron to Fairchild Semiconductor. Karandanis was director of engineering at Monolithic Memories (MMI) when John Birkner and H.T. Chua designed the first successful programmable logic device, the programmable array logic (PAL) device. His contacts in the semiconductor field were instrumental in providing Datacube with components for its products. An OEM asked Datacube if a frame grabber could be built on a Multibus board. At the time, a frame grabber was a large box with multiple boards. The VG120 was the first ever commercial single board frame grabber: based on programmable array logic (PAL), it had 320 x 240 x 6 bit resolution, grayscale video input and output. Karandanis hired Rashid Beg and Robert Wang from Matrox to develop the first Q-Bus (DEC LSI-11) frame grabber. They developed the QVG/QAF120 dual board, 8-bit product primarily for a new startup named Cognex. While the latter were developing the hardware for Datacube, they were also planning to spin off and form a competitor, Imaging Technology, which was later purchased by Dalsa. To recover from this loss, and to complete the QVG120 product, Dave Erickson was hired as a consultant in 1981 from Octek, by the engineering manager Paul Bloom. Dave came on full-time in 1982, as did Dave Simmons who was to head applications, and Bob Berger, who was to head software. At this time, Imaging Technology Inc. (ITI) was developing a line of frame grabber products for Multibus and Q-bus, with a 'real time' image processor based on a single point multiplier, adder and lookup table (LUT). In 1983, Karandanis hired Shep Siegel from Ampex, who had worked on the advanced and successful Ampex Digital Optics (ADO) real-time video spatial manipulator for the broadcast TV market. With Dunn's help, Simmons developed the VG123 Multibus and Q-bus frame grabber boards. During this development, Paul Bloom was killed in what was apparently a gangland style murder. The mystery of why this happened has never been solved. Dave Erickson was promoted to engineering manager to replace Bloom. Siegel came to add the SP123 image processor to the '123 family. But having worked on ADO, Siegel saw the limitations of the single-point architecture, and had a vision of what could be done by applying pipelined real-time imaging. He came with an understanding of digital signal processor devices (DSPs), image processing, filtering, and 2D warping, and with programmable logic in hand, saw what could be done. Erickson and Dunn had developed frame grabber boards deployed on most standard busses. Each potential new customer required features not currently available, and designing, laying out (using hand taped artwork) and manufacturing a board for a single customer was risky, slow and expensive. What was needed was a way to leverage the technology developed so that it could be applied to a wider customer base. Erickson felt that a modular architecture where functions could be easily added and a system tailored to a customers needs was critical. At this time, the VME bus was being introduced by Motorola for their Motorola 68000 processors. The automotive and military markets liked the VMEbus because it was open and rugged. Datacube developers embarked on a marketing road trip to visit potential customers in the medical, automotive and military markets to inquire what imaging functions they needed. MaxVideo 10 A Modular and expandable system based on the VMEbus form factor could meet many customer needs. MaxVideo and the MaxBus were born. Marketing research determined the primary functions required and a road map for the next few years. The first seven MaxVideo boards were Digimax (digitizer and display), Framestore (triple 512^2 framestore with unprecedented density), VFIR (first real-time 3x3 image filter, SNAP (3x3 Systolic Neighborhood Array Processor), Featuremax (real-time statistics) SP (single point general purpose processor) and Protomax (MaxVideo prototyping board). 10 beta customers were lined up to receive the first 7 boards. MaxWare was the software and drivers written to control the new boards. The first demo of the new hardware consisted of a camera's output being processed in real time by VFIR and displayed on a monitor. Siegel wrote a loop that varied the VFIR coefficients on a frame-by-frame basis to demonstrate not only the video real-time functionality, but that the function could be easily changed. In the spring of 1985, the product was not production-ready, so private viewings were set up with potential customers at the Detroit Vision '85 show. Customers' reaction was positive and three months later the first shipments to customers went out. MaxBus was based on the '123's expansion bus. It required accurate synchronization: clocking and timing of each board plus a flexible way to route data from function to function. A simple differential ECL bus with a driver on one end and terminator on the opposite end was used. For data, 14 pin ribbon cables allowed 8-bit 10 MHz data to be routed from any output to any input. At this time the company started to grow. Barry Egan was brought on to head manufacturing, entrepreneur Barry Ungar was brought on as President. Bob Berger expanded the software department, and moved the main computers from CP/M machines to Unix machines based on LSI-11s from Digital Equipment Corporation. A Unix based Pyramid mainframe computer was purchased for hardware and software development. Berger bought the first Sun workstations and set up an Ethernet LAN. He registered \\"datacube.com\\" as the 68th internet domain name in existence (now owned by Brad Mugford). In hardware, John Bloomfield was hired from Ampex. The second tier of MaxVideo products was developed. Siegel began the first image warper consisting of Addgen, Interp, and XFS. John Bloomfield expanded the fixed 512 x 512 processing to include Regions-of-interest (ROI) processing. He began developing with the new FPGAs from Xilinx. RoiStore, MaxScan (first arbitrary sensor interface), VFIR-II and MaxSigma. These products established Datacube as the technology leader in real-time imaging. It was clear that a better way than the low-level control of MaxScan was needed to manage complex new imaging pipelines. ImageFlow was developed. It provided full pipeline delay management and optimization, and a consistent API for programming imaging hardware. Key software programmers were brought on: Ken Woodland, Stephen Watkins and Ari Berman. Recognizing that not every imaging function could be best done in a pipeline, Siegel teamed with Analog Devices new digital signal processor (DSP) group to develop Euclid, based on the ADSP-2100. Color digitization was required for some markets, so Siegel teamed with broadcast consultant Robert Bleidt to develop Digicolor. Datacube's first generation image warper caught the attention of the 'image exploitation' industry and in particular, Lockheed. Later, Siegel developed the second generation warper for ROIs: Addgen MkII, based on the Weitek 3132, and Interp MkII. Dunn developed Megastore to handle the large images that this market required. By now the original SP and Featuremax were running out of steam so SP MKII and FeaturemaxMkII were developed. Erickson developed MaxMux, the first Datacube board to use a custom ASIC. The MaxMux ASIC was also used on ROIStore to route signals. To address the need to combine imaging and workstation graphics, Dunn and Erickson developed MaxView, a high resolution display with the ability to perform real time image display in a window. Watkins ported X Window to this display. Despite the fact that a single box of maxVideo hardware could replace a room full of hardware at Lockheed, the product was not bought. Lockheed made too much money on the legacy system to want to update to the newer, smaller, better system. A typical system now consisted of a MaxBox 20 slot VMEbus chassis with up to 20 boards installed. The largest MaxVideo system ever built was by Honeywell for aerial target identification. It consisted of five 20 slot chassis full of MaxVideo Hardware. A new MaxBus repeater was developed for these very large systems. Another important design-in for MaxVideo 10 was the FLIR pod test system built by Martin Marietta. Sandia National Labs adopted MaxVideo for a Radar image targeting system. MaxVideo 20 The next step was to implement up to a full rack of MaxVideo 10 hardware in a dual slot VMEbus package, increase the pipeline to 20 MHz, maintain the modularity and flexibility, and eliminate most of the blue MaxBus cables. MaxVideo 20 was born. This required a new 3-port image memory module base on the 72 pin SIMM form factor and was developed by Dunn. Up to 6 memories were used on each Max20. Max20 also leveraged a new line of Imaging chips from LSI Corporation, including a 32 x 32 digital crosspoint and an 8x8 20 MHz finite impulse response (FIR) filter. Dunn developed a new display controller, AG capable of up to 40 MHz display, and Erickson developed a new family of 20 MHz analog and flexible digital front ends, AS and AD. Dunn developed the color digitizer, AC. Another feature of MaxVideo20 was the new general processing ASIC, AU developed by Dunn. This device contained many innovative linear, nonlinear and statistical imaging functions. Its architecture was to be the core of not only Max20 but the next generation imaging system as well. Built in the pre-RTL age of schematics, Dunn's AU ASIC incorporated booth multipliers designed by mathematician Steve Gabriel. The memory SIMM was implemented with CPLDs, FPGAs and Graphics DRAM. It was limited to 1MB of memory and required 14 devices tightly packed onto the SIMM. Siegel developed VSIM, a fast and powerful ASIC to control high density SDRAMS and built a 3 device replacement SIMM. It was a triple ported image memory capable of 1, 4 or 16MB memory sizes, up to 40MB/s input and output bandwidths, and contained numerous image processing functions as well. VSIM technology was to be used on numerous future products. A number of MaxModule processing modules were developed for MaxVideo 20. One of these was Siegel's MiniWarper, a 20 MHz real-time warper based on a new ASIC design, MW4242. With the advent of MaxModules, it was now possible to implement an imaging function on a small and simple board with much less overhead than a full VME board. IBM military division in Gaithersburg MD was interested in a new image exploitation system, and so Datacube developed a third generation exploitation system for them. This powerful system used an extremely high bandwidth image memory and an address generator by Erich Whitney, capable of 7x7 spatial transformation matrices, all calculated with double precision floats. A powerful new display system, XI was developed to display the results. Unfortunately, due to the lack of a firm contract, IBM took only a couple of these systems and one year of Datacube's talented engineering efforts were effectively wasted. But Datacube had other projects going. It leveraged several key technologies with MaxVideo 20. An off-the-shelf disk storage system was integrated to be used for medical and image exploitation systems, but this system had unsolvable technical problems, so Siegel developed MD, based on an off-the-shelf external SCSI RAID box. A 12 bit digitizer, Digi-12 was developed by Erickson and was a key element in the Picker Digital Radiology system. Datacube designed an interface to a Sky array processor to obtain a GE military contract for a submarine sonar system. MaxPCI Until 1996, MaxVideo has been entirely VMEbus based. VMEbus, Unix, OS-9, VxWorks and Lynx-OS had served markets well, but Windows 95 and Pentium- based personal computers (PCs) with PCI bus were coming on strong. Clearly a PC version of MaxVideo was required. MaxPCI was developed over 2 years. VSIM was already capable of MAX PCI's target processing speed of 40 MHz, but everything else needed to be updated or redesigned. The core of MaxPCI was a new, giant crosspoint ASIC: 50 x 40 x 8 with full ROI timing crosspoint and many imaging functions as well, developed by Whitney. Dunn redesigned the AU ASIC to operate at 40 MHz, and a new statistics unit was developed. Tim Ganley developed the acquisition subsystem and Simmons developed a new family of 40 MHz analog and digital front-ends, QA and QD. For an integrated display, a VGA board from another imaging company, Univision was used. For a real-time disc solution, Shep developed NTD, a software solution for real-time disc access. Meanwhile, Datacube recognized the need to better help its customers develop complex solutions in the medical, web inspection and machine vision markets. So three vertical integration development groups were formed. Siegel headed Medical, Simmons headed Web, and Scott Roth headed Machine vision. Each of these groups developed systems for OEMs in their respective markets. MaxVision Toolkit In 1995, the machine vision group produced the MaxVision Toolkit, a software library for image acquisition, object finding, metrology, inspection functions, and camera calibration. More specifically, the Toolkit provided image acquisition (normalized correlation and connectivity), metrology tools (line fitting, arc fitting, and edge locators), inspection tools (golden template, pixel counting, and histogramming), image processing tools (Sobel edge filters, cross-gradient edge filters, threshold operations, morphology, image arithmetic, image copy, X & Y projections, and convolutions), and high accuracy calibration that corrected for perspective distortion. Swami Manickam, Scott Roth, and Tom Bushman of the machine vision group developed a significant tool called the Finder which performed intelligent normalized grayscale correlation that is invariant to rotation, scaling [to a limited extent], and perspective distortion. Swami Manickam, Scott D. Roth, Thomas Bushman, ‚Äò‚ÄôIntelligent and Optimal Normalized Correlation for High-Speed Pattern Matching‚Äò‚Äô, NEPCON WEST 2000. The effort resulted in a patent. Swami Manickam, Scott D. Roth, Thomas Bushman ,Patent #6,272,247, ROTATION AND SCALE INVARIANT IMAGE FINDER Datacube designed and manufactured a single-board image processor with an embedded PowerPC CPU for the VMEbus, called mvPower. Datacube introduced MvTD, a compact machine vision system using mvPower. It had four front panel connectors for Hirose-type camera inputs, four auxiliary connectors, two serial ports, a PCI mezzanine card carrier connector, a display connector, and an acquisition connector. Next, Datacube created the mvPower-PCI with similar specifications as mvPower for VME. Both boards used Datacube ASICs for custom image processing and image acquisition. The MaxVision Toolkit ran on these boards using the VxWorks real- time operating system. Technologies Karandanis' contacts in the semiconductor market gave Datacube a competitive edge in applying new technologies. In the early days, Video digital-to-analog converters (DACs) were large modules or expensive and power hungry bipolar devices. Datacube worked with Silicon Valley startup Telmos to develop the first integrated Video DAC. This was used on the '128 family as well as Digimax. It was the starting point for all Video DACs and RAMDACs by Brooktree and others. Datacube was to ride several technological waves including fast ADCs, disk drives, DRAM, DSP devices and custom ASICs. Programmable logic was the key to Datacube's functional density: from the early days of bipolar programmable array logic (PAL) and programmable read-only memory (PROM) to generic array logic (GAL), to every generation of FPGAs from Xilinx and then Actel and Quick Logic, and Altera CPLDs. Many semiconductor manufacturers acknowledged that Datacube could help bring their new products to market. Datacube was an ideal beta site and they shared their roadmaps, latest offerings, and support. ASICs were critical to Datacube's success. From the first small crosspoint: 3000 gates in 2 micrometres, AU: 40,000 gates in 0.8 micrometre, through VSIM, MiniWarper, AU40 and IXP. Each of these devices were leveraged across several products. After IXP the density and cost of FPGAs began to catch up to full ASICs and so FPGAs were the technologies of choice. What happened? Datacube was always a hardware-centric company. Its products competed against software solutions running on CPUs. When CPUs were in the 100-1000MIPS range, Datacube's 1G-10G solutions were very appealing. When CPUs and multi-core CPUs began to exceed 1000 MIPS, Datacube solutions were no longer needed, except for the very highest end applications. And the profits on these applications were not adequate to sustain a business. The MaxVision Toolkit ran on CPU's, so it survived. It was licensed to a few companies over the years and the source code was ultimately purchased by Scott Roth, previously VP of Machine Vision. Datacube managers always had the attitude that the best way to protect intellectual property (IP) was to stay ahead of competition, and felt that patents were a waste of time and money, attracting competition and potential infringement suits. So despite the many inventions, firsts and ideas developed, there were few patents filed. This lack of patents ultimately left no base of technology to licensing opportunities.

Chess career In 1985, when she won the World Junior Chess Championship for Girls, held in Dobrna (and taking silver in Adelaide three years later). Very soon thereafter, she fulfilled the criteria for the Woman International Master title and this was awarded in 1986. Encouraged by these early successes, she quickly developed aspirations to become a Women's World Championship contender and in the course of the qualification cycles of the late eighties and early nineties, proved that she had the ability to compete at the top level. Second place behind Nana Ioseliani in her first Interzonal at Tuzla 1987 was an inspirational start, but she won the 1993 event in Jakarta and the 1995 event in Kishinev. Her performances in the respective Candidates Tournaments ruled out an opportunity to play for the world title. She won the Women's Soviet Chess Championship in 1990. Aside from world championship competitions, in 1990 she took first place at both the Biel Women's Open and Geneva (IM), then followed up by winning the Doeberl Cup in Canberra, Australia in 1991; the first woman to do so. Her participation at the Hastings Premier in 1993/94, where she finished ahead of six male grandmasters and defeated three of them on her way to a share of third place. In respect of women competitors at Hastings, the result was second only to that of Judit Polg√°r. In the nineties she participated in the Veterans vs Ladies dance-themed tournaments where she defeated Borislav Ivkov, Vlastimil Hort, Vasily Smyslov and Mark Taimanov. In 1996, she married Jonathan Grant, also a chess player, and they settled in Edinburgh, later giving birth to daughter Elena. In team chess, Arakhamia debuted at Chess Olympiad at Novi Sad in 1990, representing the USSR Ladies team as first reserve and registering a perfect 12/12 score. With the Soviet and then Georgian Ladies Teams, she has won nine Olympiad medals, and including two team and three individual gold medals. She has won medals at the European Team Chess Championships; a team gold at Pula in 1997 and team silver medals in 1992 and 2005. Despite moving to the UK, Arakhamia continued to represent Georgia for many years, through membership of its national chess federation. She was the Georgian Ladies Champion in 1983, 1984 and 1990. In January 2008 however, she switched her registration to her adopted country. Post- millennium, she has won a bronze medal at the Women's European Individual Championship at Warsaw in 2001. She was Scottish champion jointly with Paul Motwani in 2003 (the first ever woman to achieve the honour) and has participated at the British Championship, taking the Ladies' Champion titles of 2003, 2004, 2006 and 2007. In 2006, she finished just a half point behind overall Championship winner Jonathan Rowson. She concluded with a 4¬Ω/5 finish, including a win against Nick Pert in the last round. 2006 was also the year that her husband took first place in the Scottish Championship, making them the first ever husband‚Äìwife pair to win a full national championship. Also in 2006, at Batumi Georgia, she assisted the Australian squad by coaching their Under-10 Girls at the World Youth Chess Championship. In 2007, she beat former U.S. Champion Hikaru Nakamura at Gibraltar Masters, in a 100-move first round encounter. Journalist John Saunders describes Arakhamia-Grant as the ideal role model: \\"her charming and dignified manner belies a tough, determined fighter at the board.\\" At Philadelphia, while visiting her sister, she played the World Open and finished top woman. As the tournament was a qualifier for the MonRoi Women's Grand Prix, she earned a place in the Montreal finale, held just a few weeks later. There, she shared the lead after five rounds and finished in joint fourth place (Pia Cramling won). As part of the Liverpool European Capital of Culture festivities, she played in the United Kingdom vs China match and was top scorer for the UK with 4/6, although China won the match. Arakhamia-Grant at the 2008 EU Championship At the 2008 EU Individual Open Chess Championship in Liverpool, she shared the highest scoring woman prize with Jovanka Houska and Yelena Dembo. At the Olympiad in Dresden, she played for Scotland in the main event and completed her final grandmaster norm with victory in the final round. Having additionally met the 2500 Elo rating requirement in the January 2009 FIDE list, she was awarded the title in March 2009, making her Scotland's sixth grandmaster. In August 2009 Arakhamia-Grant won the Baltic Queen round-robin tournament in Saint Petersburg. In July 2011 she won the Scottish Championship outright, finishing with the score of 7/9. In league chess, Ketevan Arakhamia-Grant has played for OSC Baden-Baden in the Women's Bundesliga and for Georgian team Interplast Tbilisi in the European Club Cup. For the 2008/9 season, she represents Wood Green Hilsmark Kingfisher 1 in the British 4NCL. Notable games * Lidia Semenova vs. Arakhamia, Jakarta Interzonal, 1993; Torre Attack 1.d4 d5 2.

It is widely regarded as an introduction to Voltaire's 1759 acclaimed novel Candide and his view on the problem of evil. The 180-line poem was composed in December 1755 and published in 1756. It is considered one of the most savage literary attacks on optimism. Background 1755 copper engraving showing Lisbon in flames and a tsunami overwhelming the ships in the harbour The earthquake of 1 November 1755 completely devastated the Portuguese capital Lisbon. The city was reduced to ruins, and between 10,000 and 60,000 people were killed.Scott, p. 208. One of the most destructive earthquakes in history, the event had a major effect on the cultural consciousness of much of Europe. Voltaire was one of many philosophers, theologians and intellectuals to be deeply affected by the disaster. Catholics attempted to explain it as God's wrath on the sins of the Portuguese, among them Protestant heretics and Jesuit casuists; while Protestants blamed the Portuguese for being Catholic. Polymath Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz and poet Alexander Pope were both famous for developing a system of thought known as philosophical optimism in an attempt to reconcile a loving Christian God with the seeming indifference of nature in disasters such as Lisbon. The phrase what is, is right coined by Alexander Pope in his Essay on Man, and Leibniz' affirmation we live in the best of all possible worlds, provoked Voltaire's scorn. He railed against what he perceived as intricate but empty philosophizing which served only to demean humanity and ultimately lead to fatalism. The earthquake further bolstered Voltaire's philosophical pessimism and deism. Due to the prevalence of evil, he argued, there could not possibly exist a benevolent, loving deity who intervened in human affairs to reward the virtuous and punish the guilty. He asserted instead that the disaster revealed the abject and ignorant nature of humankind. For Voltaire, people might well hope for a happier state, but to expect more was contrary to reason. Structure Like many of Voltaire's poems, Lisbonne consists entirely of rhyming couplets in continual progression; there are no stanzas dividing the 180 lines. Voltaire also included footnotes elucidating such terms as the universal chain and man's nature. Theme and interpretation Alexander Pope was a target of the poem as a result of his declaration \\"What is, is right\\" Unlike the lighthearted satire of Candide, the Lisbonne poem strikes a pitying, dark, and solemn tone. In his preface, Voltaire makes several objections to philosophical optimism: :'If it be true,' they said, 'that whatever is, is right, it follows that human nature is not fallen. : If the order of things requires that everything should be as it is, then human nature has not been : corrupted, and consequently has no need for a Redeemer. : ... : if the miseries of individuals are merely the by-product of this general and necessary order, : then we are nothing more than cogs which serve to keep the great machine in motion; we are no : more precious in the eyes of God than the animals by which we are devoured.' Arguing by reductio ad absurdum, Voltaire elaborates on the inherent contradiction in the dictum what is, is right. For if this were true, then human nature would not be fallen and salvation would be unnecessary. :He (Bayle) says that Revelation alone can untie the great knot which :philosophers have only managed to tangle further, that nothing but the hope of our :continued existence in a future state can console us under the present misfortunes; :that the goodness of Providence is the only sanctuary in which man can take :shelter during this general eclipse of his reason, and amidst the calamities to :which his weak and frail nature is exposed. Voltaire shows his admiration of both Bayle, who was a skeptic, and Locke, who was an empiricist. In his footnotes, Voltaire argues the self- evidence of humankind's epistemological shortcomings, since the human mind derives all knowledge from experience, which cannot give us insight into what preceded it, nor what follows it, nor what presently supports it. In the poem itself, grieving for the misery created by the earthquake and questioning whether a just and compassionate God would seek to punish sins through such cruelty, Voltaire argued that the all-powerful God Leibniz and Pope hypothesized could have prevented the innocent suffering of the sinners, reduced the scale of destruction, or announced his purpose of purifying mankind. :And can you then impute a sinful deed :To babes who on their mothers' bosoms bleed? :Was then more vice in fallen Lisbon found, :Than Paris, where voluptuous joys abound? :Was less debauchery to London known, :Where opulence luxurious holds the throne? He rejected the charge that selfishness and pride had made him rebel against suffering: :When the earth gapes my body to entomb, :I justly may complain of such a doom. In the poem, Voltaire rejected belief in \\"Providence\\" as impossible to defend ‚Äî he believed that all living things seemed doomed to live in a cruel world. Voltaire concludes that human beings are weak, ignorant and condemned to suffer throughout life. There is no divine system or message as guidance, and God does not concern himself with human beings, or communicate with them. :We rise in thought to the heavenly throne, :But our own nature still remains unknown. No matter the complexity, depth, or sophistication of philosophical and theological systems, Voltaire contended that our human origins remain unknown. :'Heav'n, on our sufferings cast a pitying eye.' :All's right, you answer, the eternal cause :Rules not by partial, but by general laws. These lines refer specifically to the common rebuttal made by the optimists of the time as to the problem of evil. Although the presence of evil in the world is evident, human beings cannot understand the motions of God. The suffering in the earthquake played a part in the greater good somewhere else. :Yet in this direful chaos you'd compose :A general bliss from individuals' woes? :Oh worthless bliss! in injured reason's sight, :With faltering voice you cry, 'What is, is right'? Voltaire draws attention to the assertion made by Alexander Pope in his An Essay on Man that 'What is, is right'. These lines contradict Pope's (and later Leibniz') Optimism. :But how conceive a God, the source of love :Who on man lavished blessings from above :Then would the race with various plagues confound :Can mortals penetrate His views profound? :Ill could not from a perfect being spring :Nor from another, as God is sovereign king; :And yet, sad truth! in this our world 'tis found :What contradictions here my soul confound! Voltaire held a deep belief in the goodness and sovereignty of God as exemplified in the verses above. He takes a pessimistic view to the existence of evil, and stresses man's ultimate ignorance. :Mysteries like these can no man penetrate :Hid from his view remains the book of fate Criticism Through his work, Voltaire criticized religious figures and philosophers such as the optimists Alexander Pope and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, but endorsed the views of the skeptic Pierre Bayle and empiricist John Locke. Voltaire was, in turn, criticized by the philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau; Rousseau had been mailed a copy of the poem by Voltaire, who received a letter carrying Rousseau's criticism on 18 August 1756. Rousseau criticized Voltaire for seeking to apply science to spiritual questions, and he argued that evil is necessary to the existence of the universe and that particular evils form the general good. Rousseau implied that Voltaire must either renounce the concept of Providence or conclude that it is, in the last analysis, beneficial. Rousseau was convinced that Voltaire had written Candide as a rebuttal to the argument he had made. Notes References * * Voltaire. \\"The Lisbon Earthquake\\" in Candide, or Optimism.

A General Review of Progress. Under a Grant of the Guggenheim Fund for the Promotion of Aeronautics. Vol. 1. California Institute of Technology, 1943. It is remembered for setting a long-distance record on its first flight in 1930. Little is documented on the specifics and the basic model of the D.33, other than the fact that it had a fixed undercarriage, and was a low-wing cantilever monoplane.United States National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics Index of NACA Technical Publication. There were three documented variations to the model, each of which was designed as a separate aircraft. This line of aircraft were regarded highly commercially before World War II, and they were influential in the establishment of the Dewoitine Company. D.33 Variants Dewoitine D.33 3-view drawing from NACA Aircraft Circular No.146 *D.33.01 : First prototype. *D.33.02 : Second prototype. D.332 The D.332 was developed based on the original D.33. A single-spar cantilever low-wing monoplane, the D.332 had fundamental resemblances to the original design. Able to hold a total of eight passengers, the D.332 had a small, enclosed cockpit, with an aerodynamic design and a rigid undercarriage. It was constructed purely from metal, and was built approximately three years after the original D.33 model, in 1933. The D.332 proved successful, ultimately achieving a best speed of over 250 km/h (155 mph), and during the initial tests, where it was flown by test pilot Marcel Doret,Taylor & Gunston 1980, p.475 the D.332 prototype successfully flew from Paris to Saigon. It did, however, crash on the return flight from Saigon, on 15 January 1935. D.333 In 1934, the D.333 was designed, built and flown for the first time. It was different from its predecessors in that it was constructed with a more spacious cabin, and could hold a maximum of 10 passengers. The primary buyer of this model was Air France; however, two of the three planes bought by the latter crashed while flying the distance between Toulouse and Dakar. Dewotine D.333 \\"Cassiop√©e\\" F-ANQB Alg√©ria 1938 D.338 1935-6 saw the drafting and prototype of the D.338. This new model was built with retractable undercarriage, and could carry 22 passengers over a maximum of around 1,950 km (1,210 mi). Fitted with 485 kW (650 hp) Hispano-Suiza 9V16/17 engines, the D.338 could travel at a speed of up to 260 km/h (160 mph). The D.338 was the first truly successful model in the line, and became widely used by Air France, first for flights within Europe, and later for international flights, between France and various parts of Asia. A total of 31 D.338s were purchased by Air France, and they were used into World War II, where they were employed as troop transporters. Following their use in the War, only eight aircraft survived. However, despite this, the basic model was still used for years, until more recent builds were designed. D.342 and D.620 Dewoitine designed two one-off aircraft based on the D.33 line; the D.342 and the D.620. Very few details relating to the specifics of these two aircraft are known or documented. Both were heavily based on the D.338 in particular. Operators ; *Air France References ;Notes ;Bibliography *The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Aircraft (Part Work 1982-1985).

Velasco (February 4, 1916 ‚Äì January 24, 2007) was a Filipino plant physiologist and agricultural chemist noted for his research on soil and plant nutrition and on coconut diseases. In 1998, he was recognized as a National Scientist of the Philippines. Early life and education Velasco was born in Imus, Cavite. After nearly flunking out of a vocational high school, he transferred to an agricultural high school (now the Central Luzon State University Science High School), where he graduated salutatorian.Ongkiko, National Scientists of the Philippines, p. 86 Velasco enrolled in what was then the University of the Philippines College of Agriculture (now the University of the Philippines Los Ba√±os) in Laguna province. He graduated at the top of his class in 1940 with a degree in Agriculture, major in Agriculture Chemistry.Ongkiko, National Scientists of the Philippines, p. 87 Upon graduation, Velasco joined the faculty of the University of the Philippines and remained there for the duration of World War II, during which he endured a brief period of incarceration by the Japanese army.Ongkiko, National Scientists of the Philippines, p. 92 After the war, Velasco pursued graduate studies in the United States and obtained a Ph.D in plant physiology from the University of California, Berkeley in 1949. He re-joined the faculty of the University of the Philippines and remained there until 1967. Contributions to agricultural science During World War II, Velasco conducted research on the photoperiodism of the rice plant. Among his findings, which were published only after the end of the war, was that the Elon-elon variety flowered during short days when there was less than 12 hours of light.Ongkiko, National Scientists of the Philippines, p. 88 Velasco was also noted for his research on the physiology of the coconut, a common crop in the Philippines. He studied the mineral nutrition of areas planted to coconut, the development and utilization of coconut products, and the nature and cause of cadang-cadang, a disease that plagued the crop of small coconut farmers throughout the country.Ongkiko, National Scientists of the Philippines, p. 89 With respect to cadang-cadang, Velasco was skeptical of the still-prevalent view that the disease was viral in nature, and devoted considerable effort to prove his thesis that it was caused by an element in the soil that was toxic to the coconut plant. Citations In 1967, Velasco was appointed Commissioner of the National Institute of Science and Technology, a position he held for 10 years. Even though his duties were administrative in nature, he continued to work on various research projects using the NIST laboratories.Ongkiko, National Scientists of the Philippines, p. 90 In 1998, Velasco was named a National Scientist of the Philippines by President Fidel Ramos.

Life  Carl Friedrich von Rumohr was born into an ancient aristocratic family and grew up on the family estates in Holstein near L√ºbeck. He went to the University of G√∂ttingen 1802-1804 where he studied Classical philology with Christian Gottlob Heyne, History (Arnold Hermann Ludwig Heeren) and Mathematics (Bernhard Friedrich Thibaut); he took drawing lessons with Johann Dominik Fiorillo who also introduced him to Art history and the critical reading of Vasari. At university he came into contact with the Romantic movement around Ludwig Tieck and converted in 1804 to Catholicism together with the brothers Riepenhausen. Inheriting a large fortune after the death of his father he went with Tieck and the brothers Riepenhausen on a study trip to Rome (1805-1806) where he met the group of German artists (among others, Joseph Anton Koch) living and working there and acquired the foundations of his expertise of the classical arts. On his return journey he was introduced in Frankfurt to the circle around Clemens Brentano. The following years he spent on his estates in Holstein while travelling extensively and meeting many personalities from the German cultural elite of his days. Of importance for the development of his thinking was his contact in the years 1806/1807 in Munich with the Naturphilosophie of Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling. He undertook studies at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich and befriended the son of the director, Johann Peter von Langer. He made his first important contribution to Art history with the publication in 1812 of: √úber die antike Gruppe Castor und Pollux ‚Ä¶. V. Rumohr: Drawing to Geist der Kochkunst (1822) His second Italian journey (1816-1821) together with the painter Franz Horny took Rumohr to Florence and Siena for art historical archive studies and 1817 to Rome where he arranged for Horny to study with Joseph Anton Koch. He met the German painters of the Nazarene movement who had been living and working in Rome since 1810 and became an important patron, supporting them through publications and purchases until he broke with the younger artists around Johann David Passavant and Julius Schnorr. He acted as guide to the future Danish King Christian VIII in 1819 and again 1821 and also to the Bavarian crown prince Ludwig. In 1822 Rumohr published under the name of his personal chef a treatise about the culinary arts, the Geist der Kochkunst von Joseph K√∂nig., in praise and defence of traditional national (not just German) and provincial cuisine. It became his most successful book and was republished in an extended form in 1832. Recently it has been rediscovered and republished.An English translation was published 1993 under the title: The Essence of Cookery. Prospect Books In the following years Rumohr was active as an elected honorary member of the newly founded Hamburger Kunstverein and advised and promoted many young Hamburg artists among them the brothers Otto and Erwin Speckter, Carl Julius Milde, Adolph Friedrich Vollmer and Christian Morgenstern. Being an able draughtsman himself, he supervised the artistic training of the young Friedrich Nerly. The relationship with their much older patron who tended to impose his strong views was, however, not always easy. Out of his study of Vasari derived his main work, the Italienische Forschungen, the first two volumes of which were published in 1827. Its importance to Art history as discipline lies in the critical evaluation of historic documents. Wilhelm von Humboldt judged the work to be the first step towards a more truthful evaluation of Art objects [in their historic context] The original quote in German reads: \\"seit Winkelmann der erste Schritt zu einer wahrhafteren Kunstansicht\\", quoted in: Kegel (1993) S. 92 Rumohr and the art historian Gustav Friedrich Waagen were involved as advisors in the planning of the Berliner Gem√§ldegalerie. The project of a public collection of old European masters had been initiated by the archaeologist Aloys Hirt (1759-1837) already in 1797 and had gained support from the architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel and the Prussian king Friedrich Wilhelm III. It was the first of its kind that had been conceived from an art historical perspective. On his third Italian journey (1828-1829), accompanied by Nerly (who travelled further on to Rome), Rumohr negotiated purchases for the Berliner Gem√§ldegalerie, worked on a novel and acted as guide to the Prussian crown prince in Florence and Siena. V. Rumohr: imaganary mountain landscape (1836) In the following years Rumohr worked on essays and literary projects, some of them never published. The third volume of Italienische Forschungen came out in 1831; a critical review by Aloys Hirt leads to the breakup of their relationship and to several polemical essays. In the year 1834 he stayed in Copenhagen to catalogue together with Just Mathias Thiele the royal print collection; he was rewarded with the title of chamberlain and became patron to the young Danish painter Lorenz Fr√∏lich. In spring of 1837 Rumohr went on his fourth Italian journey that led him to Milan and the surrounding region of Lombardy to study the traditional irrigation systems. He published his observations in: Reise durch die √∂stlichen Bundesstaaten in die Lombardey with recommendations for their adoption in Prussia. On what will be his last trip to Italy in 1841 Rumohr visited his favourite student Nerly in Venice. Returning to Copenhagen he asked Christian VIII in vain for the position of keeper of the royal art collection; rejecting an offered lesser position he retired to spend his last years on his estates near L√ºbeck devoting himself to his art collection. Rumohr died 1843 in Dresden. The physiologist, psychologist, medical practitioner and painter, Carl Gustav Carus had his death mask taken and performed an autopsy.For a photograph of the mask see: Welt online vom 15.

Since the constitution of this collection by King George V, it was the first time its curator was no more alone. In September 1995, Goodwyn replaced Marriott who retired from the post of Keeper. As Keeper, Goodwyn continued his predecessors' tasks: to mount the British and Commonwealth collection sent by the postal administrations and the purchases made during George VI's and Elizabeth II's reigns, and to exhibit at international stamp shows. He opened the Collection to postal historians or students whereas only members of the RPSL Expert Committee had regularly been allowed since the time of George V.

There have been three versions of the cross, the 1917 version covering World War I, the 1940 version covering the Second World War and the Greek Civil War, and the 1974 version covering peacekeeping missions in the subsequent years.  1917 version  = Establishment and history = The first version was established by the Venizelist \\"National Defence\\" Government on 28 February 1917, and confirmed by Royal Decree on 31 October, shortly after the entry of the whole of Greece in the First World War. Its creation was inspired by the French Croix de guerre, and it was awarded to military personnel of all branches for acts of valour in the Macedonian front (1916‚Äì1918), the Allied Expedition to the Ukraine (1919) and the Greco-Turkish War of 1919‚Äì1922 (rarely after 1920 due to its Venizelist connotations). In addition, from 1919, the first class could be awarded to the war flags of distinguished regiments. = Design and awards = The medal was designed by the French sculptor Andr√© Rivaud, featuring a silver medal consisting of a vertical sword on a circular wreath, with a horizontal plaque, bearing the ancient Spartan motto \\"Œó Œ§ŒëŒù Œó ŒïŒ†Œô Œ§ŒëŒ£\\" (\\"[return home] either with your shield, or upon it\\") underneath. The reverse bears the inscription \\"ŒïŒõŒõŒëŒ£\\" (\\"Greece\\") and underneath the dates \\"1916‚Äì1917\\". The ribbon was black, edged with blue, and 35‚Äì37 mm wide. The cross was awarded in three classes, distinguished by the devices born on the ribbon: the 3rd class being plain, the 2nd class bearing a bronze five-pointed star, and the 1st class a bronze palm leaf. Subsequent awards were designated by the addition of silver five-pointed stars on the ribbon.  1940 version  = Establishment and history = The Venizelist associations of the 1917 cross meant that, when Greece found itself at war again in October 1940 after the Italian invasion, the staunchly royalist dictatorial government chose an entirely different design instead of simply re-establishing the old version. The new medal was instituted by Royal Decree on 11 November 1940 (Compulsory Law 2646/1940) and continued to be awarded throughout the Second World War. It was re-authorised on 19 April 1947 for the Greek Civil War (1946‚Äì1949) and extended until 1953, covering the Greek participation in the Korean War. It was awarded to Greek and Allied (mostly British and later US) military personnel, as well as to regimental war flags. = Design and awards = The medal's design is essentially a modification of the French Croix de guerre, featuring a bronze cross patt√©e with the royal monogram (two crossed gammas and a crown) of King George II, atop two crossed swords, and topped by a royal crown. The reverse bears the date \\"1940\\". The ribbon features three equal alternating bands of red, blue and red. The cross was awarded in three classes, distinguished by the colour of the crown: bronze for the 3rd class, silver for the 2nd, and gold for the 1st class. Until 1942, the first award could be in any class, but according to Compulsory Law 3120/1942, the first award had always to be made in the 3rd class. Up to three subsequent awards remained in the same class (denoted by the number of miniature crowns on the ribbon), but the fifth and eighth awards upgraded the medal to the 2nd and 1st classes respectively. Several variations exist because many manufacturers were used, some in Greece and others in the United Kingdom, with minor variations in the style of the crown and the cross, as well as design of the obverse side (in some versions, the date lies within a circle).  1974 version  In 1974, during the last months of the Greek military junta and following the abolition of the monarchy in June 1973, the junta issued Law 376/74 on military medals, which revised the until then current regulations. It specified that the War Cross would have three classes, with the 1st class was reserved for senior officers and war flags, the 2nd class for mid-level officers and the 3rd class for junior and warrant officers, NCOs and privates. Due to the fall of the junta and the restoration of democracy a few months later, the medal was not officially redesigned at the time. In 1985, a provisional version was cut. It retained the same basic design as the 1940 version, but without the royal cypher, which was replaced by an oak wreath, and the crowns, which were replaced by bronze, silver and gold versions of the national emblem of Greece for the 3rd, 2nd and 1st classes respectively. The reverse bore the legend \\"ŒïŒõŒõŒóŒùŒôŒöŒó ŒîŒóŒúŒüŒöŒ°ŒëŒ§ŒôŒë\\" (\\"Hellenic Republic\\"). Four medals of the 1st class were issued to war flags of units participating in UN peacekeeping missions. The design was finalized in Presidential Decree 159 of 17 March 2003. It retains the basic design of the 1940 and 1985 crosses, but the national emblem has been moved to the center of the cross, in bronze, silver and gold versions for the 3rd, 2nd and 1st classes respectively.

Chimney sweep's cancer, also called soot wart, is a squamous cell carcinoma of the skin of the scrotum. It has the distinction of being the first reported form of occupational cancer, and was initially identified by Percivall Pott in 1775.General Surgery Lecture notes, H.Ellis, Wiley Blackwell, 12th edition It was initially noticed as being prevalent amongst chimney sweeps. Pathogenesis Chimney sweeps' carcinoma is a squamous cell carcinoma of the skin of the scrotum. Warts caused by the irritation from soot particles, if not excised, developed into a scrotal cancer. This then invaded the dartos, enlarged the testicle, and proceeded up the spermatic cord into the abdomen where it proved fatal. History Chimney sweeps' carcinoma was first described by Percivall Pott in 1775 who postulated that the cancer was associated with occupational exposure to soot. The cancer primarily affected chimney sweeps who had been in contact with soot since their early childhood. The median age of onset of symptoms in one review was 37.7 years, although boys as young as 8 years old were found to have the disease. It was proposed by W.G. Spencer in 1890 that sweat running down their bodies had caused soot to accumulate in the rugae of the inferior surfaces of the scrotum, with the resulting chronic irritation causing scrotal cancer, but this was shown to be an incorrect artifact of the method used to stain his microscope slides. In 1922, R.D. Passey, a research physician at Guy's Hospital in London produced malignant skin tumors in mice exposed to an extract made from soot, demonstrating the presence of carcinogenic substances in soot which were the likely cause of cancer of the scrotum in chimney sweeps. in the 1930s Ernest Kennaway and James D. Cook of the Research Institute of the Cancer Hospital, London, (later known as the Royal Marsden Hospital) discovered several polycyclic hydrocarbons present in soot that were potent carcinogens: 1,2,5,6-dibenzanthracene; 1,2,7,8-dibenzanthracene; and 1,2-benzpyrene (3) benzo[Œ±]pyrene. DNA consists of sequences of four bases ‚Äì guanine, adenine, cytosine, and thymine ‚Äì bound to a deoxyribonucleic backbone, forming the four deoxyribonucleosides: deoxyguanosine etc. Benzo[Œ±]pyrene interacts with deoxyguanosine of the DNA, damaging it and potentially starting the processes that can lead to cancer. =Social context= The disease was principally a British phenomenon; in Germany, for example, sweeps wore tight-fitting protective clothing which prevented the soot from accumulating on the lower surface of the scrotum, whereas boys in the UK were once sent up the chimneys wearing only trousers and shirt, and occasionally naked. In the United Kingdom before the flexible brush was introduced, the master sweeps took apprentices, who were boys from the workhouse or bought them from their parents and trained them to climb chimneys. In the German States, master sweeps belonged to trade guilds and did not use climbing boys. In Italy, Belgium, and France climbing boys were used. Boys as young as four climbed hot flues that could be very narrow. Work was dangerous and they could get jammed in the flue, suffocate or burn to death. The boys slept under the soot sacks and were rarely washed. From 1775 onwards there was increasing concern for the welfare of the boys, and Acts of Parliament were passed to restrict, and in 1875 to stop this usage. Lord Shaftesbury, a philanthropist, led the later campaign. In the United States, black children were hired from their owners and used in the same way, and were still climbing after 1875. =Sir Percivall Pott= Sir Percivall Pott (6 January 1714 ‚Äì 22 December 1788) London, England) was an English surgeon, one of the founders of orthopedy, and the first scientist to demonstrate that a cancer may be caused by an environmental carcinogen. In 1765 he was elected Master of the Company of Surgeons, the forerunner of the Royal College of Surgeons. It was in 1775 that Pott found an association between exposure to soot and a high incidence of chimney sweeps' carcinoma, a scrotal cancer (later found to be squamous cell carcinoma) in chimney sweeps. This was the first occupational link to cancer, and Pott was the first person to demonstrate that a malignancy could be caused by an environmental carcinogen. Pott's early investigations contributed to the science of epidemiology and the Chimney Sweepers Act 1788. Pott describes chimney sweeps' carcinoma thus: > It is a disease which always makes it first attack on the inferior part of > the scrotum where it produces a superficial, painful ragged ill-looking sore > with hard rising edges.....in no great length of time it pervades the skin, > dartos and the membranes of the scrotum, and seizes the testicle, which it > inlarges, hardens and renders truly and thoroughly distempered. Whence it > makes its way up the spermatic process into the abdomen. He comments on the life of the boys: > The fate of these people seems peculiarly hard ... they are treated with > great brutality ... they are thrust up narrow and sometimes hot chimnies, > where they are bruised burned and almost suffocated; and when they get to > puberty they become ... liable to a most noisome, painful and fatal disease. The carcinogen was thought to be coal tar, possibly containing some arsenic. Though Pott wrote no further papers on the subject, clinical reports began to appear suggesting that others had seen it without realising what it was and like Pott had said: > [as it occurs after puberty]....it is generally taken, both by patient and > surgeon for venereal and treated with mercurial [salts]. The disease was usually preceded by the development of hyperkeratotic lesions on the scrotum, which was what the sweeps called soot warts. These could be benign; sweeps often removed them themselves by trapping them in a split cane and cutting them off with a pocket knife. For instance: > he ... seized with a split stick and cut off with a razor. He remarked that > it was not very painful. He resumed work the following day. But if the lesion had become malignant it was far more serious. Patients frequently delayed seeking medical opinion, and when they did many were in a dreadful state. A 28-year-old sweep approached Jefferies in 1825, who describes his condition: > The sore occupies the whole of the left side of the scrotum and the inner > angle of the thigh, extending from the anus to the posterior inferior > spinous process of the ileum, presenting a surface as large as a man's open > hand, with hard indurated edges and irregular margins, discharging a thin > sanies, which is extremely offensive; the left testicle is entirely denuded, > and projects from its centre; in the left groin is a mass of indurated > glands, the size of a goose's egg, which appears to suppurate in the right > groin: there is likewise an ulceration, of the same malignant nature, about > the size of a half-crown (5 cm)... Despite the appearance of this growth, the man was in no pain and his only complaint was that about 10 days before his admission he had bled from his groin and lost about a pint of blood. Even this, however, had not unduly affected his constitution. =Treatment= Treatment was by surgery, where all the diseased flesh was cut out. Before the introduction of anaesthetics this was a simple process for the surgeon but terrifying for the patient. Alternative treatments were also proposed including the application of an arsenic paste poultice. The real cause of this cancer was unproved until the discovery of weak carcinogens in soot by Passley in 1922. Until then the most popular theory was that soot got trapped in the rugae of the scrotum and this caused a general irritation. Sweeps were not known for their attention to bodily hygiene and it was assumed they never washed their genitals. The youngest victim, recorded in 1790 by James Earle (Pott's son-in-law), was eight years old. Related diseases Decades later, it was noticed to occur amongst gas plant and oil shale workers, and it was later found that certain constituents of tar, soot, and oils, known as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, were found to cause cancer in laboratory animals. The related cancer, mule spinners' carcinoma, was blamed on the carcinogenic content of shale oil that was used to lubricate the rapidly revolving mule spindles.

It was discovered on 19 February 1995, by American astronomer Dennis di Cicco at his private Sudbury Observatory , Massachusetts, United States. It was named after American astronomer and editor Richard Fienberg.  Orbit and classification  Orbit of Rickfienberg (blue), the inner planets and Jupiter (outermost) Rickfienberg is a non-family asteroid of the main belt's background population when applying the hierarchical clustering method to its proper orbital elements. The dark C-type asteroid orbits the Sun in the central main-belt at a distance of 2.4‚Äì3.0 AU once every 4 years and 5 months (1,627 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.12 and an inclination of 8¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The first observation was taken at the Australian Siding Spring Observatory in 1987, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 8 years prior to its discovery.  Naming  This minor planet was named for Richard Tresch Fienberg (born 1956) an American astronomer at Rice and Harvard universities, and a stargazer at his private observatory near Danbury, New Hampshire. He is also an editor of the American amateur astronomer magazine Sky & Telescope, after which the minor planet 3243 Skytel is named. The was published by the Minor Planet Center on 1 May 2003 ().  Physical characteristics  = Lightcurve = During the asteroid's opposition in November 2011, a rotational lightcurve was obtained from photometric observations at Kitt Peak Observatory. It gave a well-defined rotation period of hours with a high brightness variation of 1.3 in magnitude (), typically indicating a non- spheroidal shape. This period was also confirmed by remodeled data from the Lowell photometric database in March 2016. = Diameter and albedo = According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide- field Infrared Survey Explorer, Rickfienberg measures 7.4 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.17, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for carbonaceous asteroids of 0.057 and calculates a diameter of 12.2 kilometers, as the lower the body's albedo (reflectivity), the larger its diameter, at a constant absolute magnitude (brightness).

JG 300 was formed on June 26, 1943 in Deelen as Stab/Versuchskommando Herrmann, from July 18, 1943 as Stab/JG Herrmann and finally renamed on August 20, 1943 to Stab/JG 300. Its first Geschwaderkommodore was Oberstleutnant Hajo Herrmann. Genesis and Wilde Sau JG 300 had its origins in April 1943, when Major Hajo Herrmann, a decorated bomber pilot, advocated the use of single- seat day fighters as night fighters against the Royal Air Force (RAF) bomber offensive. He suggested that single seat fighters could operate in the bombers' general target area using the light of target indicators, massed searchlights and the fires on the ground to spot their targets. These operations were tested over Berlin during May and June 1943 and codenamed Wilde Sau. Recruiting a group of experienced bomber pilots and former instructors with the requisite blind-flying experience, a test unit was set up on June 26, 1943 in Deelen as Stab/Versuchskommando Herrmann to test Herrmann's theory. Standard Fw 190-As and Bf 109-Gs were used, initially 'borrowed' from their parent day units, principally Jagdgeschwader 1 and Jagdgeschwader 11. Jagdgeschwader 300 employed the Wilde Sau tactic in single- engined fighters for the first time on the night of 3/4 July 1943, when 653 RAF aircraft attacked Cologne's industrial area on the east bank of the Rhine. The German fighters, taking advantage of the illumination from searchlights, target indicator flares and ground fires, claimed 12 aircraft shot down but had to share their claims with the anti-aircraft batteries who also claimed the 12 bombers. To avoid losses to friendly fire, anti-aircraft batteries were ordered to restrict the height of their flak barrage and the fighters operated above that ceiling.RAF History ‚Äì Bomber Command 60th Anniversary , Campaign Diary: July 1943 . Accessed 21 July 2008 The test unit expanded into JG 300, its I. Gruppe officially formed on August 20, 1943. Sister units JG 301 and JG 302 were also formed on similar lines at this time, collectively brought together as 30. Jagd-Division under Herrmann's command. Special variants of the Bf 109 were later adapted for this night fighter duty; the Bf 109 G-6(N) and Bf 109 G-6(Y). The former was fitted with the FuG 350 Naxos Z passive homing detector and the latter with the \\"Y\\" interception radio system; initially the single-seat fighters used no radar or radio aids. Although 30. Jagd-Division was initially far from a fully established Jagdgeschwader, the formation process was sped up with RAF Bomber Command deployment in July 1943 of Window; radar-jamming tin-foil strips which had rendered the Luftwaffe radar control system ineffective. JG 300 and its sister units were the only interim counter measure, while Luftwaffe radar researchers strove to overcome this jamming. JG 300 night operations met with considerable initial success. Its first formal defensive operation on 27/28 July 1943 saw the unit claim four of the 17 bombers downed that night for one loss. Some 13 (out of a Nachtjagd total of 56 claimed) bombers were claimed shot down by JG 300 on the night of 24 August, while a further 12 were claimed on 27‚Äì28 August. 10 (from a total of 47) were claimed 1 September and another 18 on 5‚Äì6 September. The number of night accidents involving single-seat fighters caused by poor weather in the winter of 1943, led to unsustainable losses in pilots and aircraft. Thus by the end of 1943, JG 300 fielded 3 Fw 190 A-6 (Stab), 14 Bf 109 G-6 (I Gruppe), 4 Fw 190 A-6 (II Gruppe) and 1 Bf 109 G-6 (III Gruppe). On 1 January 1944, parts of I./JG 300 was detached and used to form 1./Nachtjagdgruppe 10. By early 1944 the Nachtjagdgeschwaders has been equipped with the advanced and \\"window-proof\\" Lichtenstein SN-2 VHF airborne radar and JG 300 gradually evolved into a standard day fighter unit, flying operations against the USAAF 8th and 15th Air Forces over Western Europe as a part of Reichsverteidigung (Defense of the Reich). Night operations were still sometimes flown, as on the 24/25 March 1944, when I. and II./JG 300 claimed 7 RAF bombers for one loss. By this time Oblt. Klaus Bretschneider of 5./JG 300 had claimed 14 Wilde Sau victories, during 20 combats. By May 1944, JG 300 at last had numbers approaching a full establishment of aircraft, with I./JG 300 having 42 (14 operative) Bf 109 G-6 at Bonn Hangelar; II./JG 300 stationed at Dortmund with 25 (13) Fw 190 A-6 and III./ JG 300 with 46 (25 operative) Bf 109 G-6 at Wiesbaden/Erbenheim. Major Walther Dahl was appointed Kommodore of JG 300 on 27 June.http://www.luftwaffe.cz/dahl.html JG 300 lost several of its top aces in the summer of 1944. On 28 July 1944, Oblt. Ernst-Erich Hirschfeld (24 claims, 9 at night) of 5. JG 300 was shot down and killed in his Fw 190 A-8 near Erfurt, as was Leut. Gerhard B√§rsdorf (7 claims) who collided with his wing man. On 29 July 1944, Oberfeldwebel Hermann Wischnewski (26 claims) of I./JG 300 shot down two B-17 bombers and a P-51 fighter but was then shot down and badly injured. Sturmgruppen shot Downed Consolidated B-24 Liberator of the 492d Bombardment Group after an aerial battle at Oschersleben on 7 July 1944 In the summer of 1944 Sturmgruppe units were raised, equipped with heavily armoured and armed FW 190 fighters and charged with breaking up the massed ranks of USAAF daylight bombers. Initially manned by volunteers, each pilot was trained to close with the enemy and engage in extremely short- range combat, attacking from the front and the rear in tight arrowhead formations, even to contemplate deliberately ramming enemy bombers when circumstances permitted. II./ JG 300 became such a Sturmgruppe unit at this time and, equipped with the Focke-Wulf 190 A-8/R2 or R8 with two MK 108 30mm cannon, and two MG 151/20 20mm cannon, enjoyed initial success in downing bombers, but also suffered heavy losses to the massed fighter escorts. From June 1944 until the end of October 1944, II Gruppe suffered some 73 killed, 2 missing, and 32 wounded. On 7 July 1944 a force of 1,129 B-17 Flying Fortresses and B-24 Liberators of the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) Eighth Air Force set out from England to bomb aircraft factories in the Leipzig area and the synthetic oil plants at Boehlen, Leuna-Merseburg and L√ºtzkendorf. This formation was intercepted by a German Gefechtsverband comprising IV. (Sturm) Gruppe Jagdgeschwader 3, escorted by two Gruppen of Bf 109s from JG 300 led by Major Walther Dahl. Dahl drove the attack to point- blank range behind the Liberators of the 492nd Bomb Group, which at the time was temporarily without fighter cover, before opening fire. Within about a minute the entire squadron of twelve B-24s had been annihilated. The USAAF 2nd Air Division lost 28 Liberators that day, the majority to the Sturmgruppe attack. IV. /JG 3 lost nine fighters shot down and three more suffered damage and made crash landings; five pilots were killed. A 1944 drawing by Helmuth Ellgaard illustrating \\"ramming\\" USAAF escort fighters were increasingly effective. On 11 September 1944 II. (Sturm)/JG 300 lost 13 Fw 190s to P-51 Mustangs, with 10 pilots killed and two wounded. They claimed nine Mustangs, actual Mustang losses was just one 339th Fighter Group P-51, damaged by Flak and shot down by an Me 262. I. /JG 300, flying top cover lost 13 Bf 109s without claiming a kill. One pilot was killed and one wounded. Major Alfred Lindenberger, (a forty-seven-year-old Prussian World War I ace with 12 victories) was posted to II. /JG 300 in June 1944 and was made Gruppenkommandeur later in 1944. On 28 September 1944 he was shot down by P-51s and wounded. Owing to his age and inexperience with modern fighters he flew most sorties as a wingman. Lindenberger claimed two US four-engined bombers on 17 December 1944. As the year progressed the 30 Jagddivision was broken up, as JG 301 left for Ploie»ôti in Romania while JG 302 flew combat over Hungary and Austria. Only JG 300 remained in the Reich. Major Dahl was dismissed from his command of JG 300 by Hermann G√∂ring on 30 November 1944, for refusal to launch what he considered a suicidal interception mission. During the Ardennes offensive in late 1944, JG 300 was one of the few units remaining on Reich defence duties, with most other fighter units sent to support attacking ground forces. The Geschwader took heavy losses in late 1944, particularly on 17 December when 100 aircraft of JG 300 intercepted USAAF bombers, claiming 33 shot down but losing 43 of their own number. Many of the pilots killed were irreplaceable Experten, including on 24 December 1944, the Staffelkapit√§n of 5. /JG 300 Oblt Klaus Bretschneider, who was shot down by 357th FG P-51s (who claimed 28 fighters for 2 losses). On 14 January 1945 a mixed formation of JG 300 and JG 301 were attacked by USAAF escort fighters, during an interception against the USAAF 3rd Air Division, bombing oil targets over central Germany. The two Geschwader claimed 18 B-17s, 7 P-51s and one P-47 downed, although the mixed formation lost 89 aircraft with 52 killed and 18 wounded. (JG 300 lost 51 fighters, with 32 pilots killed and 10 wounded).The 357th Fighter Group claimed over 50 kills, and the 56th FG and the 20th FG also claimed victories. On 14 February 1945, operations against the USAAF bomber streams by JG 300 and JG 301 led to I. and III. /JG 300 losing 3 Bf 109s and II. /JG 300 losing 6 Fw 190s.

Pakistan has a vibrant media landscape; among the most dynamic in South Asia and world. Majority of media in Pakistan is privately owned. Pakistan has around 300 privately owned daily newspapers. According to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (formerly the Federal Bureau of Statistics), they had a combined daily sale of 6.1 million copies in 2009. Television is the main source of news and information for people in Pakistan's towns, cities and large areas of the countryside. Marketing research company Gallup Pakistan, estimated there were 86 million TV viewers in Pakistan in 2009. To a large extent the media enjoys freedom of expression in spite of political pressure and direct bans sometimes administered by political stake holders.\\"Media in Pakistan: Between radicalisation and democratisation in an unfolding conflict\\" , International Media Support, July 2009, 56 pages. Political pressure on media is mostly done indirectly. One tool widely used by the government is to cut off 'unfriendly' media from governmental advertising. Using draconian laws the government has also banned or officially silenced popular television channels. The Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA) has been used to silence the broadcast media by either suspending licenses or by simply threatening to do so. In addition, media is also threatened by non-state actors involved in the current conflict. Security situation of the journalist has improved and the number of journalist killed in Pakistan has also declined considerably. However, the press freedom in Pakistan continues to decline. Reporters without borders in its 2020 Press Freedom Index ranked Pakistan number 145 out of 180 countries based on freedom of the press. Recent report from Reporters without borders implies considerable improvement in the freedom of press compared to the preceding years. Overview Since 2002, the Pakistani media has become powerful and independent and the number of private television channels have grown from just three state-run channels in 2000 to 89 in 2012, according to the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority. Most of the private media in Pakistan flourished under the Musharraf regime. Pakistan has a vibrant media landscape and enjoys independence to a large extent. After having been liberalised in 2002, the television sector experienced a media boom. In the fierce competitive environment that followed commercial interests became paramount and quality journalism gave way to sensationalism. Although the radio sector has not seen similar growth, independent radio channels are numerous and considered very important sources of information - especially in the rural areas. The Pakistani media landscape reflects a multi-linguistic, multi-ethnic and class-divided society. There is a clear divide between Urdu and English media. The Urdu media, particularly the newspapers, are widely read by the masses - mostly in rural areas. The English media is urban and elite-centric, is more liberal and professional compared to the Urdu media. English print, television and radio channels have far smaller audiences than their Urdu counterparts, but have greater leverage among opinion makers, politicians, the business community and the upper strata of society. Pakistan has a vibrant media landscape; among the most dynamic and outspoken in South Asia. To a large extent the media enjoys freedom of expression. More than 89 television channels beam soaps, satire, music programmes, films, religious speech, political talk shows, and news of the hour. Although sometimes criticise for being unprofessional and politically biased, the television channels have made a great contribution to the media landscape and to Pakistani society. Radio channels are numerous and considered a very important source of information - especially in the rural areas. Besides the state channel Radio Pakistan, a number of private radios carry independent journalistic content and news. But most radio content is music and entertainment. There are hundreds of Pakistani newspapers from the large national Urdu newspapers to the small local vernacular papers. Pakistan's media sector is highly influenced by the ownership structure. There are three dominating media moguls, or large media groups, which to some extent also have political affiliations. Due to their dominance in both print and broadcast industries all three media groups are very influential in politics and society. History The media in Pakistan dates back to pre-partition years of British India, where a number of newspapers were established to promote a communalistic or partition agenda. The newspaper Dawn, founded by Muhammad Ali Jinnah and first published in 1941, was dedicated to promoting for an independent Pakistan. The conservative newspaper, Nawa-i-Waqt, established in 1940 was the mouthpiece of the Muslim elites who were among the strongest supporters for an independent Pakistan. In a sense, Pakistani print media came into existence with a mission to promulgate the idea of Pakistan, which was seen as the best national option for the Muslim minority in British India and as a form of self-defense against suppression from the Hindu majority. Role in exposing corruption Since the introduction of these vibrant TV channels, many major corruption cases and scams have been unveiled by journalists. Notable among them are: * The Pakistan Steel Mills Rs. 26 billion scam;\\"Rs26 billion corruption: NAB given 3 months to probe steel mills case\\", Azam Khan, The Express Tribune, 17 May 2012. * National Insurance Company Limited scandal; * Bribery and corruption in Pakistan International Airlines which caused losses of $500 million;\\"$500m corruption in PIA, says PTI\\", Pakistan Today, 26 February 2012. * Embezzlement in Pakistan Railways causing massive financial losses;\\"Railways‚Äô 2009-10 audit highlights massive corruption and losses\\", Irfan Bukhari, Pakistan Today. 22 November 2010. * Hajj corruption case;http://dawn.com/tag/hajj-corruption- case/ * NATO containers' case where 40 containers heading for ISAF in Afghanistan went missing;\\"Arrests made, warrants issued in Nato container case\\", Dawn Media Group, 1 July 2010. * Rental power projects corruption\\" US starts probe into rental power projects scam \\", Ansar Abbasi, The News International, 23 June 2012. * Ephedrine quota case, a scandal involving the son of former Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani to pressure officials of the Health Ministry to allocate a quota of controlled chemical ephedrine to two different pharmaceutical companies.\\"Ephedrine Quota Case\\" , Awaz Internet TV. * Malik Riaz's 'Media Gate' in which the son of Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry is said to have taken money from Malik Riaz to give favourable decisions from the Supreme Court. ‚ÄúMalik Riaz‚Äôs case proved that the media can hold the judiciary and even itself accountable\\", says Javed Chaudhry, columnist and anchorperson working with Express News. \\"This case, along with the missing persons' case has established impartiality and credibility of the media in its fight against corruption\\". Chaudhry feels, like many others in country, that the media in Pakistan has become free and fair during the last decade. \\"The Pakistani media has covered the journey of 100 years in just 10 years, but their curiosity and thrust for revelation does not end and that is what drives the media\\".\\"Pakistani media‚Äôs fight against corruption: A Case Study for Afghan Media\\", Mokhtar Wafayi and Haris Bin Aziz, The Express Tribune, 23 July 2012. TENSIONS: According to a report by the UK Foreign Office, Pakistan's media environment continued to develop and, in many cases, flourish. Since opening up in 2002, the number and range of media outlets has proliferated, so that Pakistanis now have greater access than ever before to a range of broadcasting through print, television and online media. The increased media penetration into most aspects of Pakistani life has created challenges as well as opportunities, as both the journalistic community and politicians and officials build their understanding of effective freedom of expression and responsible reporting. However, in 2011, Reporters Without Borders listed Pakistan as one of the ten most deadly places to be a journalist. As the War in North-West Pakistan continued, there have been frequent threats against journalists. The proliferation of the media in Pakistan since 2002 has brought a massive increase in the number of domestic and foreign journalists operating in Pakistan. The UK Foreign Office states that it is vital that the right to freedom of expression continues to be upheld by the Pakistani Government. This was highlighted by an event supporting freedom of expression run by the European Union in Pakistan, which the United Kingdom supported.\\"Journalists in danger\\", Reporters Without Borders, 30 October 2012.Journalist‚Äôs secret fund List, Constitution Petition No.105/2012, No. 104/2012, No. 53/1012, and No. 117/2012, Supreme Court of Pakistan, 22 April 2013. International co-operation =Support for creation of new media= In 2012‚Äì14, UPI Next with NearMedia LLC helped Pakistani journalists to create PakPolWiki, an online resource for coverage of the national elections, and Truth Tracker, a fact-checking website. In this project, the team held learning sessions across the country and conducted individual mentoring for journalists to produce stories that meet national and international standards. NearMedia continued the effort with a project for 2014-15 that, in partnership with Media Foundation 360, launched News Lens Pakistan, an independent online news cooperative which publishes stories in English, Urdu and Pashto for a national audience, and distributes these stories to national and local news outlets. Learning sessions, in which editors work with reporters newsroom-style to improve their skills, are held in districts of all provinces, and international journalists work with the Pakistan team to mentor them individually. =Pakistan - US Journalists Exchange Program= Since 2011, the East-West Center (EWC), headquartered in Honolulu, Hawaii, have been organising the annual Pakistan - United States Journalists Exchange program. It was launched and designed to increase and deepen public understanding of the two countries and their important relationship, one that is crucial to regional stability and the global war on terrorism. While there have been many areas of agreement and cooperation, deep mistrust remains between the two, who rarely get opportunities to engage with each other and thus rely on media for their information and viewpoints. Unresolved issues continue to pose challenges for both countries. This exchange offers U.S. and Pakistani journalists an opportunity to gain on-the- ground insights and firsthand information about the countries they visit through meetings with policymakers, government and military officials, business and civil society leaders, and a diverse group of other community members. All participants meet at the East-West Center in Hawaii before and after their study tours for dialogues focused on sensitive issues between the two countries; preconceived attitudes among the public and media in the United States and Pakistan; new perspectives gained through their study tours; and how media coverage between the two countries can be improved. Ten Pakistani journalists will travel to the United States and ten U.S. journalists will travel to Pakistan. This East-West Center program is funded by a grant from the U.S. Embassy Islamabad Public Affairs Section. The program provides journalists with valuable new perspectives and insights on this critically important relationship, a wealth of contacts and resources for future reporting, and friendships with professional colleagues in the other country upon whom to draw throughout their careers.\\"Pakistan-United States Journalists Exchange\\" , East-West Center (Honolulu). =International Center for Journalists= In 2011, the International Center for Journalists (ICFJ), a non-profit, professional organisation located in Washington, D.C. launched the U.S. - Pakistan Professional Partnership in Journalism program, a multi-year program which will bring 230 Pakistani media professionals to the United States and send 70 U.S. journalists to Pakistan. Journalists will study each other's cultures as they are immersed in newsrooms in each country. The program will include events and opportunities to experience U.S. life, showcasing its diversity. Representatives from the U.S. media hosts will go to Pakistan for two-week programs during which they will learn the realities of Pakistani journalism and national life through site visits, interviews and opportunities to interact with journalists, officials and ordinary Pakistanis. Pakistanis will receive four-week internships at U.S. media organizations. Participants on both sides will have opportunities to report on their experiences in each country, which will help to educate their audiences and dispel myths and misconceptions that people carry in each country about residents of the other. ICFJ has also established the Center for Excellence in Journalism (CEJ) in Karachi, Pakistan. The CEJ serves as a hub for the professional development, training and networking of Pakistani journalists and media professionals from all parts of the country. Through targeted, practical trainings and the exchange component of the program, the CEJ aims to foster long-lasting connections between the participating universities, media outlets, and professional journalists. A partnership with Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism and the Institute of Business Administration (IBA) aims to provide targeted, practical trainings for Pakistani journalists in print, broadcast, and digital media. Courses will be co-instructed by faculty from the Medill School, accomplished newsroom managers, editors and reporters from the United States, and prominent media professionals from Pakistan. Regulation =History= The first step in introducing media laws in the country was done by the then military ruler and President Ayub Khan who promulgated the Press and Publication Ordinance (PPO) in 1962. The law empowered the authorities to confiscate newspapers, close down news providers, and arrest journalists. Using these laws, Ayub Khan nationalised large parts of the press and took over one of the two largest news agencies. The other agencies was pushed into severe crisis and had to seek financial support from the government. Pakistani Radio and Television, which was established in 1964 was also brought under the strict control of the government. More draconian additions were made to the PPO during the reign of General Zia-Ul-Haq in the 1980s. According to these new amendments, the publisher would be liable and prosecuted if a story was not to the liking of the administration even if it was factual and of national interest. These amendments were used to promote Haq's Islamist leanings and demonstrated the alliance between the military and religions leaders. Censorship during the Zia years was direct, concrete and dictatorial. Newspapers were scrutinised; critical or undesired sections of an article censored. In the wake of Zia-ul- Haq's sudden death and the return of democracy, the way was paved to abate the draconian media laws through a revision of media legislation called the Revised PPO (RPPO). From 2002, under General Pervez Musharraf, the Pakistani media faced a decisive development that would lead to a boom in Pakistani electronic media and paved the way to it gaining political clout. New liberal media laws broke the state's monopoly on the electronic media. TV broadcasting and FM radio licenses were issued to private media outlets. The military's motivation for liberalising media licensing was based on an assumption that the Pakistani media could be used to strengthen national security and counter any perceived threats from India. What prompted this shift was the military's experience during the two past confrontations with India. One was the Kargil War and the other was the hijacking of the India Airliner by militants. In both these instances, the Pakistani military was left with no options to reciprocate because its electronic media were inferior to that of the Indian media. Better electronic media capacity was needed in the future and thus the market for electronic media was liberalised. The justification was just as much a desire to counter the Indian media power, as it was a wish to set the media \\"free\\" with the rights that electronic media had in liberal, open societies. The military thought it could still control the media and harness it if it strayed from what the regime believed was in the national interest - and in accordance with its own political agenda. This assessment however proved to be wrong as the media and in particular the new many new TV channels became a powerful force in civil society. The media became an important actor in the process that led to fall of Musharraf and his regime. By providing extensive coverage of the 2007 Lawyer's Movement's struggle to get the chief justice reinstated, the media played a significant role in mobilising civil society. This protest movement, with millions of Pakistanis taking to the streets in the name of having an independent judiciary and democratic rule, left Musharraf with little backing from civil society and the army. Ultimately, he had to call for elections. Recently, due to a renewed interplay between civil society organisations, the Lawyers' Movement and the electronic media, Pakistan's new president, Asif Ali Zardari had to give in to public and political pressure and reinstate the chief justice. The emergence of powerful civil society actors was unprecedented in Pakistani history. These could not have gained in strength without the media, which will need to continue and play a pivotal role if Pakistan has to develop a stronger democracy, greater stability and take on socio-political reforms. Whether Pakistan's media, with its powerful TV channels, is able to take on such a huge responsibility and make changes from within depends on improving general working conditions; on the military and the state bureaucracy; the security situation of journalists; media laws revision; better journalism training; and lastly on the will of the media and the media owners themselves. =Legal framework= Though Pakistani media enjoy relative freedom compared to some of its South Asian neighbours, the industry was subjected to many undemocratic and regressive laws and regulations. The country was subjected to alternating military and democratic rule - but has managed to thrive on basic democratic norms. Though the Pakistani media had to work under military dictatorships and repressive regimes, which instituted many restrictive laws and regulations for media in order to 'control' it, the media was not largely affected. The laws are, however, detrimental to democracy reform, and represent a potential threat to the future of Pakistan and democracy. Constitution The root for the article 19 freedom of expression traced from South Asia when any body was directly sentenced to death if they uttered a single word against the government. The Pakistani Constitution guarantees freedom of expression and the basic premise for media freedom. While emphasizing the state's allegiance to Islam, the constitution underlines the key civil rights inherent in a democracy and states that citizens: Media laws There are a number of legislative and regulatory mechanisms that directly and indirectly affect the media. Besides the Press and Publication Ordinance (PPO) mentioned, these laws include the Printing Presses and Publications Ordinance 1988, the Freedom of Information Ordinance of 2002, the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA) of 2002, the Defamation Ordinance of 2002, the Contempt of Court Ordinance of 2003, the Press, Newspapers, News Agencies and Books Registration Ordinance 2003, the Press Council Ordinance 2002, the Intellectual Property Organisation of Pakistan Ordinance 2005 and lastly the Access to Information Ordinance of 2006. Also there were attempts in 2006 for further legislation ostensibly \\"to streamline registration of newspapers, periodicals, news and advertising agencies and authentication of circulation figures of newspapers and periodicals (PAPRA).\\" The liberalisation of the electronic media in 2002 was coupled to a bulk of regulations. The opening of the media market led to the mushrooming of satellite channels in Pakistan. Many operators started satellite and/or cable TV outlets without any supervision by the authorities. The government felt that it was losing millions of rupees by not 'regulating' the mushrooming cable TV business. Another consequence of the 2002 regulations was that most of these were hurriedly enacted by President Musharraf before the new government took office. Most of the new laws that were anti-democratic and were not intended to promote public activism but to increase his control of the public. Many media activists felt that the new regulations were opaque and had been subject to interpretation by the courts which would have provided media practitioners with clearer guidelines. Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority The Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA, formerly RAMBO - Regulatory Authority for Media and Broadcast Organizations) was formed in 2002 to \\"facilitate and promote a free, fair and independent electronic media\\", including opening the broadcasting market in Pakistan.Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority Ordinance 2002 as Amended in 2007 , 19 July 2007. By the end of 2009 PEMRA had: * issued 78 satellite TV licenses; * issued \\"landing rights\\" to 28 TV channels operating from abroad, with more under consideration; * issued licenses for 129 FM radio stations, including 18 non-commercial licenses to leading universities offering courses mass communication and six licenses in Azad Jammu and Kashmir; * registered 2,346 cable TV systems serving an estimated 8 million households; and * issued six MMDS (Multichannel Multipoint Distribution Service), two Internet protocol TV (IPTV), and two mobile TV licenses, with more under consideration. PEMRA is also involved in media censorship and occasionally halts broadcasts and closes media outlets. Publication or broadcast of \\"anything which defames or brings into ridicule the head of state, or members of the armed forces, or executive, legislative or judicial organs of the state\\", as well as any broadcasts deemed to be \\"false or baseless\\" can bring jail terms of up to three years, fines of up to 10 million rupees (US$165,000), and license cancellation. In practice, these rules and regulations are not enforced.\\"Country report: Pakistan (2010)\\", Freedom of the Press 2010, Freedom House, 27 April 2010. In November 2011, Pakistani cable television operators blocked the BBC World News TV channel after it broadcast a documentary, entitled Secret Pakistan. However, Pakistanis with a dish receiver can still watch it and can continue to access its website and web stream. Dr. Moeed Pirzada of PTV stated that it was hypocritical of the foreign media to label it as 'suppression of the media' when the United States continues to ban Al Jazeera English and no cable operator in the US would carry the channel. He also stated that even 'democratic' and 'liberal' Indians refuse to carry a single Pakistani news channel on their cable or any Pakistani op-ed writers in their newspapers.\\"Who Says BBC Is Banned In Pakistan?\\", Facebook, 1 December 2011.  Television  The first television station began broadcasting from Lahore on 26 November 1964. Television in Pakistan remained the government's exclusive control until 1990 when Shalimar Television Network (STN) and Network Television Marketing (NTM) launched Pakistan's first private TV channel. Mr. Yasin Joyia was the first General Manager of (NTM), Which was shut down very soon by PTV bureaucratic conspiracies. But it was of no use as till then cable TV network was already introduced in urbanized cities, like Rawalpindi, Islamabad, Lahore and Karachi. Foreign satellite TV channels were added during the 1990s. Traditionally, the government-owned Pakistan Television Corporation (PTV) has been the dominant media player in Pakistan. The PTV channels are controlled by the government and opposition views are not given much time. The past decade has seen the emergence of several private TV channels showing news and entertainment, such as GEO TV, AAJ TV, ARY Digital, BOL Channel HUM, MTV Pakistan, and others such as KTN, VSH News, Sindh TV, Awaz TV and Kashish TV. Traditionally the bulk of TV shows have been plays or soap operas, some of them critically acclaimed. Various American, European, Asian TV channels, and movies are available to a majority of the population via Cable TV. first look of the Legend of Maula Jutt . Using oppressive laws the government has also banned or officially silenced popular television channels. The Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA) has been used to silence the broadcast media by either suspending licenses or by simply threatening to do so. In many cases these channels were shifted to obscure numbers in channel line-up. In addition, media is also exposed to propaganda from state agencies, pressured by powerful political elements and non-state actors involved in the current conflict. A number of channels have been shut down in the past with the latest such incident involving Geo TV and other channels in the Geo TV network after a Fatwa was issued against it.\\"Cable operators urge PEMRA to shut down Geo\\", The Express Tribune, 17 May 2014. The shutdown came after the network attempted to air allegations on the involvement of Inter-Services Intelligence in the attempted assassination of its leading anchor Hamid Mir.\\"Pakistan's Geo News becomes latest target in blasphemy accusation trend\\", Jon Boone, The Guardian, 22 May 2014.\\"Pakistan Is Asked to Shut Down News Channel\\", Declan Walsh and Salman Masoodapril, The New York Times, 22 April 2014.\\"Pakistan‚Äôs most popular Geo channels shut down\\", Ahmad Noorani, The News International, 22 May 2014.  Radio  The government-owned Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation (PBC) was formed on 14 August 1947, the day of Pakistani independence. It was a direct descendant of the Indian Broadcasting Company, which later became All India Radio. At independence, Pakistan had radio stations in Dhaka, Lahore, and Peshawar. A major programme of expansion saw new stations open at Karachi and Rawalpindi in 1948, and a new broadcasting house at Karachi in 1950. This was followed by new radio stations at Hyderabad (1951), Quetta (1956), a second station at Rawalpindi (1960), and a receiving centre at Peshawar (1960). During the 1980s and 1990s the corporation expanded its network to many cities and towns of Pakistan to provide greater service to the local people. In October 1998, Radio Pakistan started its first FM transmission.PERMA Annual Report 2009, Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority, 22 December 2009. Today, there are over a hundred public and private radio stations due to more liberal media regulations. FM broadcast licenses are awarded to parties that commit to open FM broadcasting stations in at least one rural city along with the major city of their choice.  Cinema  The indigenous movie industry, based in Lahore and known as \\"Lollywood\\", produces roughly forty feature-length films a year. In 2008 the Pakistani government partially lifted its 42-year ban on screening Indian movies in Pakistan.\\"The India-Pakistan Thaw Continues\\", Simon Robinson, Time, 10 March 2008. On 27 April 2016 Maalik became the first Pakistani film to be banned by the Federal Government after being cleared with Universal rating by all three Censor Boards and running in Cinemas for 18 days. The film has been banned under section 9 of the Motion Pictures Ordinance of 1979, a legislation which is redundant after the 18th Constitutional Amendment, where Censorship of films is no longer a Federal subject. Maalik (Urdu ŸÖÿßŸÑ⁄©) is a 2016 Pakistani Political, thriller film made by Ashir Azeem. The film was released on 8 April 2016 in cinemas across Pakistan.

Maalik is the desire of a common Pakistani for freedom, democracy and justice in a country that has been hijacked by the feudal elites after the departure of the British from the subcontinent and who continues to rule and mismanage an impoverished nation, while amassing huge personal fortunes for themselves. The film was banned in Pakistan by the Federal Government on 27 April 2016 for endangering democracy. Newspapers, news channels, and magazines In 1947, only four major Muslim- owned newspapers existed in the area now called Pakistan: Pakistan Times, Zamindar, Nawa-i-Waqt, and Civil-Military Gazette. A number of Muslim papers and their publishers moved to Pakistan, including Dawn, which began publishing daily in Karachi in 1947, the Morning News, and the Urdu-language dailies Jang and Anjam. By the early 2000s, 1,500 newspapers and journals existed in Pakistan.Press Reference: Pakistan, Advamag, Inc. Retrieved 19 June 2011. In the early 21st century, as in the rest of the world, the number of print outlets in Pakistan declined precipitously, but total circulation numbers increased. From 1994 to 1997, the total number of daily, monthly, and other publications increased from 3,242 to 4,455, but had dropped to just 945 by 2003 with most of the decline occurring in the Punjab Province. However, from 1994 to 2003 total print circulation increased substantially, particularly for dailies (3 million to 6.2 million). And after the low point in 2003 the number of publications grew to 1279 in 2004, to 1997 in 2005, 1467 in 2006, 1820 in 2007, and 1199 in 2008.Newspapers and periodicals by language and province 1999 to 2008 , Provincial Public Relation Departments, Federal Bureau of Statistics, Government of Pakistan, 27 April 2009. Since the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War there has also been a presence of jihadi material in the print media : Muhammad Amir Rana estimates that \\"until 1989, the number of jihad publications in Pakistan had reached 150\\", while in 1990 \\"around 100 jihad monthlies and 12 weeklies were being published in Peshawar, Quetta and Islamabad\\", in many languages, as \\"25 were in Urdu, 50 in Pashtu and Persian, 12 in Arabic and 10 in English\\", with Kashmiri militant groups alone publishing some 22 periodicals in 1994.Muhammad Amir Rana, \\"Jihadi Print Media in Pakistan: An Overview\\" in Conflict and Peace Studies, vol. 1, no. 1 (Oct- Dec 2008), p. 2 Newspapers and magazines are published in 11 languages; most in Urdu and Sindhi, but English-language publications are numerous. Most print media are privately owned, but the government controls the Associated Press of Pakistan, one of the major news agencies. From 1964 into the early 1990s, the National Press Trust acted as the government's front to control the press. The state, however, no longer publishes daily newspapers; the former Press Trust sold or liquidated its newspapers and magazines in the early 1990s. Web News Channels also appeared from mostly after 2010. Press Council and newspaper regulation Prior to 2002, News Agencies in Pakistan were completely unregulated. Established under the Press Council of Pakistan Ordinance in October 2002, the body operates on a semi-autonomous nature along with an Ethical Code of Practice signed by President Musharraf. It is mandated with multi-faceted tasks that range from protection of press freedom to regulatory mechanisms and review of complaints from the public. However, the Press Council never came into operation due to the reservations of the media organisations. In protest over its establishment, the professional journalists organisations refrained from nominating their four members to the council. Nevertheless, the chairman was appointed, offices now exist and general administration work continues. This has led the government to review the entire Press Council mechanism. The Press Council Ordinance has a direct link to the Press, Newspapers, News Agencies and Books Registration Ordinance (PNNABRO) of 2002. This legislation deals with procedures for registration of publications of criteria of media ownerships. Among the documents required for the permit or 'Declaration' for publishing a newspaper is a guarantee from the editor to abide by the Ethical Code of Practice contained in the Schedule to the Press Council of Pakistan Ordinance. Though the Press Council procedure has made silenced or paralysed, these forms of interlinking laws could provide the government with additional means for imposing restrictions and take draconian actions against newspapers. The PNNABRO, among many other requirements demands that a publisher provides his bank details. It also has strict controls and regulations for the registering procedure. It not only demands logistical details, but also requires detailed information on editors and content providers. Ownership of publications (mainly newspapers and news agencies) is restricted to Pakistani nationals if special government permission is not given. In partnerships, foreign involvement cannot exceed 25 percent. The law does not permit foreigners to obtain a 'Declaration' to run a news agency or any media station.

It is notable for being an open-ocean hunter that resembles a fish in body plan and locomotion, an example of convergent evolution.  Distribution  * P. atlantica occurs in the (sub) tropical waters of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. * P. bucephalum is known from the Mediterranean.  Ecology  Juveniles of P. bucephalum are found exclusively feeding on the bell of the hydromedusa Zanclea costata (this junior synonym was given precedence over Mnestra parasites). At first the nudibranch is attached to the inside of the bell of the meduse with its very small foot. It sucks tissue from the ring, radial canals and manubrium of the meduse and grows from 1.6 mm to 11 mm in just ten days, while the meduse shrinks. When the slug is as big as the meduse, it starts to swim, eating the remaining parts, including the tentacles. In adulthood its diet is no longer restricted to Zanclea, although observations of feeding behaviour are sparse. Phylliroe uses its rhinophores (long horns) to prey on jellies, and the nearly vestigial remnant of its foot to adhere to the jelly prey. Phylliroe has been seen approaching a swarm of the larvacean Oikopleura albicans from below, grabbing a specimen with its paired denticulate jaws and swallowing it in half a minute. Adults have also been observed to prey on the meduse Aequoria. Branches of the digestive tract may contain symbiontic zooxanthellae, but this relationship has not yet been studied. It is unclear if all specimens of P. bucephalum harbor these symbionts. It is possible they are obtained from their prey. P. bucephalum sometimes suffers from parasitic trematodes, both attached to its skin and inside its body.

She was directly responsible for what became the largest class-action lawsuit in Canadian history, representing an estimated 79,000 survivors; the Canadian government settled the lawsuit in 2005 for upwards of 5 billion dollars.Halifax Daily News article on Bernard in 2006 Archived at Arnold Pizzo McKiggan In 1945, when Bernard was 9 years old, her mother was told that if she did not sign the consent forms to send her children to a residential school, the child welfare system would take her children into \\"protective custody\\"; as a result, Bernard attended the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School for five years. In 1955, she married a non-native man, and consequently lost her legal status under the Indian Act; the relevant section of the Indian Act was repealed in 1985, but this did not automatically lead to reinstatement as a band member, and it was not until March 2007 that she was voted back into the Millbrook First Nation. In 1995, Bernard began an organization to represent survivors of the Shubenacadie school; she subsequently convinced Halifax lawyer John McKiggan to represent the Shubenacadie survivors in a class-action suit. After the Shubenacadie suit became public knowledge, many other survivors' associations across Canada filed similar suits; these were eventually amalgamated into one national lawsuit. In McKiggan's words, \\"(...) if it wasn't for Nora's efforts, and other survivors like her across Canada, this national settlement never would have happened. (...) After we filed our lawsuit, a number of other students from other schools filed similar class actions.\\" In 2005, she testified before the House of Commons of Canada about the abuse children suffered in residential schools: On December 27, 2007, Bernard was found dead in her home in Truro, Nova Scotia; although she was originally thought to have died of natural causes, on December 31, police arrested her grandson James Douglas Gloade and charged him with her murder. She had been stabbed to death. On January 23, 2009, Gloade was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to 15 years in prison. In 2008 Bernard was posthumously awarded the Order of Nova Scotia.

The hall is surrounded by a moat, making an island 66 m by 74 m. Alterations were made to the hall in the 16th and 17th centuries, and it was enlarged in the 18th century. The building has Georgian and Tudor sections which form the remaining western wing of a once larger complex. The hall is reached across the moat over a listed stone bridge, thought to be dated around the late 17th Century. History The oldest section of the remaining wing of Clayton Hall was built in the 15th century on the site of a 12th-century house built for the Clayton family. When Cecilia Clayton married Robert de Byron in 1194 it passed to the Byron family, of which poet Lord Byron was a later member. The Byrons lived there for more than 400 years until they sold it for ¬£4,700 in 1620 to London merchants, George and Humphrey Chetham, who originated from Manchester. George Chetham died in 1625, leaving his share to his brother Humphrey Chetham, who later died at the Hall in 1653. Ownership then passed to his nephew, George Chetham, son of his brother James and part of Humphrey's legacy was used by his family to found Chethams School and Library in the centre of Manchester, close to the Cathedral. This had long been a dream of Humphrey's, as depicted in one of artist, Ford Madox Brown's, Manchester Murals which are held in the Great Hall of Manchester Town Hall. George Chetham was High Sheriff in 1660 and died in 1664. In 1666 James Chetham had 18 hearths liable for hearth tax, making it the largest house in the area. Clayton Hall then passed to Edward Chetham, and from him to his sister Alice, who had married Adam Bland. Their daughter Mary married Mordecai Greene, a Spanish merchant and their only son James was MP for Arundel in 1796 and died in 1814. Clayton Hall then passed with Turton Tower, the other Chetham, seat to one of James' five daughters Arabella Penelope Eliza Greene, who had married banker Peter Richard Hoare. From 1863 to 1897 the Hall was the rented to Lomax (1863‚Äì1867), W. H. Burns (1872‚Äì1890) and John White (1890‚Äì1897), clergy of St Cross Church. In 1897 the Hall was sold by Charles A. R. Hoare to Manchester City Corporation and it was restored in 1900. The 16th-century part of the Hall was rented to tenants. The 18th-century part contained the dining room, kitchen, larder, scullery and pantry. The oldest structure on the site is the sandstone bridge crossing the now empty moat. Dating from the late medieval era, it was built to replace the original wooden drawbridge. During the Civil War, Parliamentary cavalry were stationed there, before the attack on Manchester. Afterwards, according to legend, Oliver Cromwell was said to have spent three nights there. Current Use The left-hand section of the Hall was converted into a hands-on Living History Museum by five members of the Friends of Clayton Park volunteer group, in 2009. They eventually created six rooms, dressed in late Victorian style, to depict the latest historical period in which the Hall was privately owned. There is also a Textiles Room devoted to vintage garments and sewing techniques, with several antique hand- and treadle-operated sewing machines. A Memories Room houses a large collection of local and British history materials. The museum is currently open to the public, with free admission, on the first and third Saturday of months February though November. This includes free History talks about the Hall and her owners at 12noon and 2pm. School and group visits can be arranged, and family events take place several times a year. There is usually a small charge on these occasions, to cover costs, although some activities are free of charge. The profits from the group's activities are used to help to preserve the Hall for the future, and to enhance the visitor offer. The work of the Friends group is supported by Manchester City Council (MCC), who still own the Hall and grounds, and have granted a License for Use to the group and continue to be responsible for the fabric of the building, with some financial input from the Charitable Trust and its generous donors. The co-founders of the museum formed The Clayton Hall Living History Museum Charitable Incorporated Organisation and gained registered charity status in 2014 - Registered Charity Number 1155379 The older, 15th Century section was incorporated into the museum in 2017 and includes a first-floor room which is dedicated to the memory of Humphrey Chetham, as was originally stipulated when the Hall was sold to Manchester Corporation, and a Clayton Hall History Room. There is an attractive ground- floor Tudor Tea Room, also run by the Friends group, which is open on open days and other occasions throughout the year. The upper floor is reached by a spiral staircase which is housed in the belltower. Architecture Clayton Hall was rebuilt in the 15th century with either a quadrangular plan or one with three wings. It was mostly demolished when a new house was built in the 17th century. Additions were made in the 18th century and the hall was restored in 1900. The grade II* listed hall is constructed in red brick with some timber framing and stone slate roofs. The older single-depth portion has two bays on the ground floor and a front corridor, a plain doorway and two- light casement window. Its first floor has square-panelled timber-framing which may originally have been jettied over the ground floor which is now rebuilt in brick. The upper storey has three wooden mullion windows with leaded glazing. Over the central window is a jettied gable with a king post and raked struts and on the ridge is a bellcote. The wing has a gabled stair- turret and there is a large sandstone chimney stack with a brick top on the gable wall. The newer double-depth portion is constructed of hand-made bricks set in English garden wall bond with stone quoins. It has a doorway with a segmental quoin stone surround and either side are pairs of diamond-paned casement windows. There are three similar windows of different sizes on the first floor. The rainwater heads are dated 1900. Moated site The scheduled monument is the rectangular island measuring about 66 metres by 74 metres forming the moated site of the original hall. The monument includes the site of a late-14th/early-15th century chapel in the north-west corner that was demolished in the early 18th century. The island is accessed by a stone twin- arched bridge that replaced an earlier wooden structure. The hall and its associated buildings and infrastructure, fences and gateposts on the north- east of the island are not scheduled, nor is the moat which has been lined with concrete.

Tetraloops are a type of four-base hairpin loop motifs in RNA secondary structure that cap many double helices. There are many variants of the tetraloop. The published ones include ANYA, CUYG, GNRA, UNAC and UNCG. Three types of tetraloops are common in ribosomal RNA: GNRA, UNCG and CUUG, in which the N could be either uracil, adenine, cytosine, or guanine, and the R is either guanine or adenine. These three sequences form stable and conserved tetraloops that play an important role in structural stability and biological function of 16S rRNA. * GNRA  The GNRA tetraloop has a guanine-adenine base-pair where the guanine is 5' to the helix and the adenine is 3' to the helix. Tetraloops with the sequence UMAC have essentially the same backbone fold as the GNRA tetraloop, but may be less likely to form tetraloop-receptor interactions. They may therefore be a better choice for closing stems when designing artificial RNAs.  The presence of the GNRA tetraloop provides an exceptional stability to RNA structure. GNRA occurs 50% more than other tetranucleotides due to their ability to withstand temperatures 4¬∞ C higher than other RNA hairpins. This allows them to act as nucleation sites for proper folding of RNA. The rare hydrogen bonds between the first guanine and fourth adenine nucleotide, extensive stacking of nucleotide bases and hydrogen bonds between 2' OH of a ribose sugar and nitrogenous bases makes the tetraloop thermodynamically stable. * UNCG  In the UNCG is favorable thermodynamically and structurally due to hydrogen bonding, van der Waals interactions, coulombic interactions and the interactions between the RNA and the solvent. The UNCG tetraloops are more stable than DNA loops with the same sequence. The UUCG tetraloop is the most stable tetraloop. UUCG and GNRA tetraloops make up 70% of all tetraloops in 16S-rRNA . * CUUG  The CUUG tetraloop has the highest likelihood of conformational changes due to its structural flexibility. Out of the three tetraloops mentioned, this tetraloop is the most flexible since the second uracil is comparatively unrestricted. It is also very thermodynamically stable.

They were designed by Baldwin and built by Werkspoor (Utrecht) between 1951 and 1953. The electrical equipment was built by N.V. Heemaf (Hengelo) to a design by Westinghouse. Some parts (the bogies, and the electrical installation) were made in the United States as part of the Marshall Plan. Originally 75 locomotives were ordered, but the order was reduced to 25 locomotives and more locomotives of the French Class 1100 locomotives were ordered instead. History =Nederlandse Spoorwegen= The 1200 class was retired by the NS in 1998. Locomotives 1201, 1202 and 1211 were obtained for preservation by the Stichting Klassieke Locomotieven group (1201) and the Dutch Railway Museum (1202 and 1211). A further five locomotives, numbers 1214, 1215, 1218, 1221 and 1225, were bought by the Dutch freight operator ACTS Nederland BV in 1999 and were renumbered to 1251‚Äì1255. =ACTS Nederland BV, EETC= ACTS Nederland BV continued to use its five 1200 class locomotives in freight and charter service until 2010. Locomotive 1253 was taken out of service in 2003 and was used as a parts donor, while locomotive 1252 was taken out of service in 2007. The remaining three locomotives were withdrawn in 2009-10 by ACTS and all except parts donor 1253 were sold to Euro-Express-Treincharter BV (EETC). As of January 2011 engines 1251 and 1252 had been returned to working order by EETC whilst engine 1254 was being overhauled. The two operational locomotives were being used to haul the empty Citynightline train from Munich and Zurich and Euronight Jan Kiepura train from Moscow, Minsk, Warsaw, Prague and Copenhagen between Amsterdam Centraal railway station and Watergraafsmeer. They are also used on charter trains and transporting carriages to and from the EETC workshop in Rotterdam. =Sixty years of the 1200 class= The eight surviving 1200s in Amersfoort, November 2011. On 12 November 2011, all eight existing engines were brought together in Amersfoort for a railway enthusiast event to celebrate 60 years since the 1200 class entered service. The display was organized by the NVBS (Nederlandse Vereniging van Belangstellenden in het Spoor- en tramwegwezen), the Dutch national railway enthusiasts' body which was celebrating its 80th anniversary. M√§rklin-Edition In 2014 locomotive 1252 was repainted to celebrate 175 years of railways in the Netherlands. As part of this, the locomotive was decorated with a promotional slogan by M√§rklin \\"The original must be M√§rklin - M√§rklin congratulates the Netherlands on 175 years of railways\\" in Dutch on one side of the locomotive body and German on the other. The locomotive was offered as a one-time series HO scale model by M√§rklin as item No. 37128 in 2014. Fairtrains Since 2017 all engines were decommissioned by their respective owners, but the Fairtrains foundation made number 1251 operational again in 2018 for being hired by the Railexperts company. The objective of Fairtrains is to have museum equipment restored and preserved from the revenues of their use. In case of sufficient interest, some more machines of this class are kept behind for refurbishment.

He was Professor of Anthropology and of Social Sciences at the University of Chicago. Trouillot was best known for his books Open the Social Science (1990), Silencing the Past: Power and the Production of History (1995), and Global Transformations (2003), which explored the origins and application of social science in academia and its implications in the world. Trouillot has been one of the most influential thinkers of Afro-Caribbean diaspora, because he developed wide- ranging academic work centered on Caribbean issues. Alyssa Goldstein Sepinwall holds that ‚ÄúTrouillot was one of the most original and thoughtful voices in academia. His writings influenced scholars worldwide in many fields, from anthropology to history to Caribbean studies‚Äù. Biography = Early life = Trouillot was born on November 26, 1949, in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. Trouillot's family included intellectuals, academics, and at least one judge. His father, Ernest Trouillot, a lawyer and professor at a prestigious lycee, hosted a television show about Haitian history as part of his academic contributions. His uncle, Henock Trouillot, was the director of the National Archives of Haiti, besides being a prolific writer and public historian. His family was also politically minded; Trouillot's stepmother, Ertha Pascal- Trouillot, a well-known lawyer and judge, was named interim president in 1990 as the country stabilized and prepared for the democratic elections. Trouillot's life was marked by the personal experience of immigration and exile. Before beginning scholarly study, he was a songwriter and activist involved in political protest against the Duvalier dynasty in Haiti and against the American government's treatment of undocumented Haitian immigrants. In 1968, Trouillot left Haiti as part of the large wave of student activists fleeing the repression of the Duvalier dictatorship. In 1971, Trouillot found refuge with his impoverished aunt in Brooklyn, New York. Trouillot's family lived in a basement and slept on the floor. Trouillot started rehearsals for a Haitian exile theater company, Tanbou Lib√®te (Drum of Freedom), in his basement. Trouillot was convinced that theater could be used to instigate social change and alter the course of politics. In 1978, he joined his aunt in Park Slope, Brooklyn, and completed a bachelor's degree in Caribbean history and culture at Brooklyn College, while working as a taxi driver and participating in the political and cultural activism of the Haitian diaspora. In 1978, Trouillot left Brooklyn to enroll in the anthropology program at Johns Hopkins University, where he completed his Ph.D, and began his career as an anthropologist. = Academic life = Trouillot joined the University of Chicago faculty in 1998 after serving as the Krieger/Eisenhower Distinguished Professor of Anthropology and director of the Institute for Global Studies in Culture, Power and History at Johns Hopkins University. Trouillot was one of the most original, disciplinary, innovative and thoughtful voices in academia because his theoretical frameworks expanded social science knowledge in Caribbean studies; his writings influenced scholars in many fields, from anthropology, sociology, to history to Caribbean studies. Trouillot's academic legacy explores sub-fields of the anthropology with regards to social sciences knowledge. As he explains in Global Transformations (2003), he viewed academic work as more than a simple search for facts: ‚ÄúWhat I want to know in this case is never merely an empirical fact, let alone what I could learn from someone else‚Äîfrom a book, for instance. It is the knowledge that I want to produce. It is what I want to say about this topic, this site, these people‚Äîthe ‚Äòburning questions‚Äô I want to share even with myself as interlocutor.‚Äù =Death= In the last days of his academic life, he had retired by chronic illness. Trouillot passed away in his home in Chicago in 2012, after a decade-long struggle to recover from a brain aneurism. He was 62 years old.  Publications  Trouillot was the author and co-author of a number of books. Trouillot published the first nonfiction book in Haitian Creole as an activist and undergraduate, Ti dif√© boul√© sou istwa Ayiti (1977) (A Small Fire Burning on Haitian History), which attempts to shed knowledge and ignite new interpretations of Haitian history. His dissertation, which later became his second book, Peasants and Capital: Dominica in the World Economy (1988), focused on how peasants in Dominica dealt with the transformations of the global banana industry. He published Les racines historiques de l‚Äô√©tat duvali√©rien, which later appeared in English as Haiti: State Against Nation. The Origins and Legacies of Duvalierism (1990), which was an important book with regards to repression and legacy in Afro-Caribbean studies. Additionally, Trouillot published Silencing the Past: Power and the Production of History (1995), which has become a foundational text for both Haitian studies and history. Also, Trouillot was part of a distinguished international group of scholars to publish Open the Social Sciences (1996), which traces the history of the social sciences, describes the recent debates surrounding them, and discusses in what ways they can be intelligently restructured. Finally, Global Transformations: Anthropology and the Modern World (2003), examines anthropology's historical underpinnings‚Äîits epistemic groundings and political consequences.  Honors  The Caribbean Philosophical Association awarded him the 2011 Frantz Fanon Lifetime Achievement Award for \\"the originality of his interrogations in the human sciences, especially anthropology and history, and his articulation of the importance and challenges of Haiti in contemporary discussions of freedom and reclamations of the past\\".

The majority were very small, like rodents. This was a group that lasted a long time, from the Paleocene to the last of the Miocene. Interatheriidae is one of the mammal groups that best represent the fauna from the Santa Cruz Formation.

They have released four albums since 2004. History My Teenage Stride (or \\"MTS\\") started in 2003 as \\"the bedroom/hallway/basement recording project of Jedediah Smith,\\" providing a band identity for Smith's multi-instrumental solo recordings. Over the years, the group has consisted of Jedediah Smith and a shifting cast of band members. Smith grew up in the rural Western Massachusetts town of Colrain, learning piano, guitar, bass and drums as a teenager. As Smith described it, \\"My grandmother was a stride piano player, Jelly Roll Morton-style... She almost went professional, but because she was a woman in the '20s I don't think she felt she'd be able to go all the way with it. My mom started singing jazz after she turned 40, and my dad had an incredible record collection.\\" The first My Teenage Stride album, A Sad Cloud, was released on the Banazan label in 2004, followed the following year by Major Major on Becalmed Records. Smith recruited Michael Hollitscher on bass, Brett Whitmoyer on drums, Tris McCall on synthesizer, and Dakkan Abbe on guitar; this line-up recorded part of the third album, 2007's Ears Like Golden Bats, though much of the album consisted of Smith still playing every instrument. Ears Like Golden Bats was described by eMusic.com as \\"one of the year's most thrilling surprises, an album that wraps wry gallows humor in glistening guitars and whistling synths.\\" The review continued: > Lyrically, Smith is a gleeful malcontent. The first words on the record are > \\"God bless the criminal,\\" and its remainder is filled with tales of sad > sacks and pessimists who never built a bridge they wouldn't burn. > \\"Reversal,\\" a canny re-write of the Chills '\\"Pink Frost,\\" is one long > festival of denial, Smith grimly intoning: \\"When you feel alright/ > reversal!/ when you sail alright/ reversal!\\" In 2008, the group self-released an EP called Lesser Demons, and in December 2008, recorded a festive tune for the Christmas compilation 'An Indiecater Christmas' released by Indiecater Records. My Teenage Stride undertook to release a single each month in 2009, with releases on eMusic.com that included some b-sides and two EPs. As of 2010, My Teenage Stride was a trio with Smith, Edd Chitenden, and John Grewell. They released a set of five songs, recorded earlier in 2010 by Smith alone, on WFMU's Free Music Archive. In early 2010, the group solicited funding on Kickstarter for a new album, citing a plan to work with producer/musician Marc Kramer (of Butthole Surfers, Galaxie 500, and Bongwater).

Due to the recent explosion of epigenome datasets, computational methods play an increasing role in all areas of epigenetic research. Definition Research in computational epigenetics comprises the development and application of bioinformatics methods for solving epigenetic questions, as well as computational data analysis and theoretical modeling in the context of epigenetics. This includes modelling of the effects of histone and DNA CpG island methylation. Current research areas =Epigenetic data processing and analysis= ChIP-on-chip technique Various experimental techniques have been developed for genome-wide mapping of epigenetic information, the most widely used being ChIP-on-chip, ChIP-seq and bisulfite sequencing. All of these methods generate large amounts of data and require efficient ways of data processing and quality control by bioinformatic methods. =Epigenome prediction= A substantial amount of bioinformatic research has been devoted to the prediction of epigenetic information from characteristics of the genome sequence. Such predictions serve a dual purpose. First, accurate epigenome predictions can substitute for experimental data, to some degree, which is particularly relevant for newly discovered epigenetic mechanisms and for species other than human and mouse. Second, prediction algorithms build statistical models of epigenetic information from training data and can therefore act as a first step toward quantitative modeling of an epigenetic mechanism. Successful computational prediction of DNA and lysine methylation and acetylation has been achieved by combinations of various features. =Applications in cancer epigenetics= The important role of epigenetic defects for cancer opens up new opportunities for improved diagnosis and therapy. These active areas of research give rise to two questions that are particularly amenable to bioinformatic analysis. First, given a list of genomic regions exhibiting epigenetic differences between tumor cells and controls (or between different disease subtypes), can we detect common patterns or find evidence of a functional relationship of these regions to cancer? Second, can we use bioinformatic methods in order to improve diagnosis and therapy by detecting and classifying important disease subtypes? Emerging topics The first wave of research in the field of computational epigenetics was driven by rapid progress of experimental methods for data generation, which required adequate computational methods for data processing and quality control, prompted epigenome prediction studies as a means of understanding the genomic distribution of epigenetic information, and provided the foundation for initial projects on cancer epigenetics. While these topics will continue to be major areas of research and the mere quantity of epigenetic data arising from epigenome projects poses a significant bioinformatic challenge, several additional topics are currently emerging. * Epigenetic regulatory circuitry: Reverse engineering the regulatory networks that read, write and execute epigenetic codes. * Population epigenetics: Distilling regulatory mechanisms from the integration of epigenome data with gene expression profiles and haplotype maps for a large sample from a heterogeneous population.'' * Evolutionary epigenetics: Learning about epigenome regulation in human (and its medical consequences) by cross-species comparisons. * Theoretical modeling: Testing our mechanistic and quantitative understanding of epigenetic mechanisms by in silico simulation. * Genome browsers: Developing a new blend of web services that enable biologists to perform sophisticated genome and epigenome analysis within an easy-to-use genome browser environment. * Medical epigenetics: Searching for epigenetic mechanisms that play a role in diseases other than cancer, as there is strong circumstantial evidence for epigenetic regulation being involved in mental disorders, autoimmune diseases and other complex diseases.

It consists of a physical three-dimensional model onto which a computer image is projected to create a realistic looking object. Importantly, the physical model is the same geometric shape as the object that the PA model depicts. Uniting physical and virtual objects Spatially augmented reality (SAR) renders virtual objects directly within or on the user's physical space. A key benefit of SAR is that the user does not need to wear a head-mounted display. Instead, with the use of spatial displays, wide field of view and possibly high-resolution images of virtual objects can be integrated directly into the environment. For example, the virtual objects can be realized by using digital light projectors to paint 2D/3D imagery onto real surfaces, or by using built-in flat panel displays. Real objects can be physically handled and naturally manipulated to be viewed from any direction, which is essential for ergonomic evaluation and provides a strong sense of palpability.Ishii & Ullmer, 1997. Although simulated haptic feedback devices enable some aspects of computer-generated objects to be touched, they can not match this level of functionality.Evans, Wallace, Cheshire & Sener, 2005; Baradaran & Stuerzlinger, 2005; Khoudja, Hafez & Kheddar, 2004 It is, therefore, unsurprising that physical objects are still used for many applications, such as product design.Dutson & Wood, 2005. However, computer- generated objects have a key advantage; they provide a level of flexibility that cannot be matched by physical objects. Therefore, a display is needed that somehow joins the real physical world and computer-generated objects together, thus enabling them to be experienced simultaneously.Gibson, Gao & Campbell, 2004; Ishii & Ullmer, 1997. Tangible user interfaces (TUI) and augmented reality both aim to address this issue. TUI systems use real physical objects to both represent and also interact with computer-generated information (Figure 1). However, while TUIs create a physical link between real and computer-generated objects, they do not create the illusion that the computer-generated objects are actually in a user's real environment. That is the aim of augmented reality. Image:Adapted milgrams VR-AR continuum.png Figure 1 Continuum of advanced computer interfaces, based on Milgram and Kishino (1994). Unlike virtual reality (VR), which immerses a user in a computer-generated environment, augmented reality (AR) joins together physical and virtual spaces by creating the illusion that computer-generated objects are actually real objects in a user's environmentAzuma et al., 2001 (Figure 1). Furthermore, head-mounted-display based AR and VR systems can directly incorporate physical objects. Thus, as a user reaches out to a computer- generated object that they can see, they touch an equivalent physical model that is placed at the same spatial location.Whitton, Lok, Insko & Brooks, 2005; Billingshurst, Grasset & Looser, 2005; Borst & Volz, 2005; Lee, Chen, Kim, Han & Pan, 2004; Hoffman, Garcia-Palacios, Carlin, Furness & Botella- Arbona, 2003. Such systems enable the computer-generated visual appearance of the object to be dynamically altered, while the physical model provides haptic feedback for the object's underlying form. However, head-mounted-display based systems require users to wear equipment, which limits the number of people who can simultaneously use the display. A variant of the AR paradigm that does not suffer from these limitations is spatially augmented reality (Figure 1).Raskar, Welch, Fuchs, 1998. Spatially augmented reality displays project computer-generated information directly into the user's environment.Bimber & Raskar, 2005. Although there are several possible display configurations, the most natural type is the projection augmented model. Projection augmented models Image:Projection Augmented model 1.jpg Figure 2 The Projection Augmented model concept A projection augmented model (PA model) consists of a physical three-dimensional model, onto which a computer image is projected to create a realistic looking object (Figure 2). Importantly, the physical model is the same geometric shape as the object that the PA model depicts. For example, the image projected onto the objects shown in Figure 3 provides colour and visual texture, which makes them appear to be made from different materials. Image:Projection Augmented model 2.jpg Figure 3 An example of a Projection Augmented model (inset - with the projection off). PA models use a unique combination of physical objects and computer-generated information, and hence they inherit advantages from both. ‚ÄúThe human interface to a physical model is the essence of ‚Äòintuitive‚Äô. There are no widgets to manipulate, no sliders to move, and no displays to look through (or wear). Instead, we walk around objects, moving in and out to zoom, gazing and focusing on interesting components, all at very high visual, spatial, and temporal fidelity‚Äù.Raskar, Welch, Low & Bandyopadhyay, 2001, p.89 PA models combine the high level of intuitiveness of physical models with the flexibility and functionality of computer graphics, such as the ability to be quickly altered, animated, saved and updated (Jacucci, Oulasvirta, Psik, Salovaara & Wagner, 2005). Thus, a PA model essentially gives a physical form to a computer-generated object, which a user can touch and grasp with their bare hands. It is therefore unsurprising that user studies, which compared PA models to other Virtual and Augmented Reality displays, found PA models to be a natural and intuitive type of display (Nam & Lee, 2003; Stevens et al., 2002). However, the PA model concept is not new. In fact, one of the first PA model type displays was created over twenty years ago when Naimark built the ‚ÄòDisplacements‚Äô art installation (Naimark, 1984) and more recently in the ‚ÄúHaunted Mansion‚Äù attraction in Disney World (Liljegren & Foster, 1990). At the time technology did not exist for a PA model to be much more than an artistic statement. However, given the technology available today and a little ‚Äúunfettered imagination‚Äù, exploring novel projection displays is now ‚Äúpotentially boundless‚Äù.Naimark, 2005, p.605 The growth in PA model technology has been marked by the recent recreation of Naimark's ‚ÄòDisplacements‚Äô installation at SIGGRAPH (Displacements, 2005). Specifically, new technology has been developed that semi-automates the process of both creating and aligning the physical model and projected image. This supports multiple projectors, which enables a PA model to be illuminated from every direction. Furthermore, powerful projectors (2000-3000 lumens) can be used to allow a PA model to be located in a well-lit room (Nam, 2005; Umemoro, Keller & Stappers, 2003). However, whilst this technology enables a PA model to be a viable and useful type of display, it does not address its main aim. A PA model aims to create the illusion of actually being the object that it depicts. For example, when used for a product design application, it is important that a PA model provides a convincing perceptual impression of actually being the final product (Nam, 2006; Saakes, 2006; Verlinden, Horv√°th & Edelenbos, 2006; Keller & Stappers, 2001). Similarly, when used for a museum display application to create a replica of an artefact, a PA model aims to create the illusion of being the real artefact (Hirooka & Satio, 2006; Senckenberg Museum, 2006; Bimber, Gatesy, Witmer, Raskar & Encarnacao, 2002; Museum of London, 1999). However, no previous research has specifically considered this illusion. Therefore, this thesis defines the ‚ÄòProjection Augmented model illusion‚Äô as the situation in which a PA model is perceived to actually be the object that it depicts. For example, this illusion occurs when a user perceives the PA model in Figure 3 to be real bricks, flower pots, and pieces of wood, as opposed to white models with an image projected onto them. However, the essence of this illusion does not involve deceiving the user. A user can perceive a PA model to be the object that it depicts, whilst knowing that it is actually a white model and a projected image. Technology has been developed to enhance this illusion by increasing the physical similarity between the PA model and the object that it depicts, or in other words, increasing the fidelity of the PA model. For example, the way in which the specular highlights on an object move as the viewer changes position can be dynamically simulated. This enables a PA model to appear to be made from a wide range of materials. For example, a dull clay vase can appear to be made from a shiny plastic material. However, whether or not the PA model illusion occurs is entirely dependent on a user's subjective perceptual impression. Therefore, increasing the fidelity of different aspects of a PA model may each have a different effect on the strength of the illusion. This is essentially the same as the way in which increasing the fidelity of different aspects of a computer-generated photorealistic image, may each have a different effect on the degree to which the image is perceived to be a real photograph (Longhurst, Ledda & Chalmers, 2003; Rademacher, Lengyel, Cutrell, & Whitted, 2001). For example, increasing the fidelity of the textures in the image may typically be more important than increasing the fidelity of the shadows. It cannot therefore be assumed that increasing the fidelity of any aspect of a PA model will automatically strengthen the PA model illusion, and similarly it cannot be assumed that decreasing the fidelity of any aspect will automatically weaken it. Therefore, given that no previous research has investigated this illusion, it is difficult to determine the success of the technology that aims to enhance it, and difficult to make informed decisions when developing new technology. The capabilities of the human perceptual system should guide the development of any advanced interface (Stanney et al., 2004), hence this issue needs to be addressed.

Since November 2018 the station has been owned-and-operated by Immaculate Heart Media, Inc, whose Catholic programing is known as Relevant Radio. History WVNJ began operation on AM 1160 as a CP in 1987 and signed on in 1992. The station initially offered an oldies format featuring mostly R&B; music from 1955 to 1974. The format did not do well and in January 1996 WVNJ flipped to an adult standards format known as \\"The Station Of The Stars\\" featuring the music of Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, The Mills Brothers, Peggy Lee, Tommy Dorsey, Ray Charles, Nat King Cole, Johnny Mathis, Bing Crosby, McGuire Sisters, Bobby Darin, Perry Como, Glenn Miller, Sammy Davis Jr., and many others. The station stayed away from baby boomer pop with the exception of quazi-rock and roll artists like Ray Charles. The station also added former 1130 WNEW air personalities such as Ted Brown, Jim Lowe, Jim Harlan, Mike Prelee, Mike Myers & Bobby Ryan. Bill Gaghan was the Program director during Ted Brown's tenure. Throughout 1996, 1997, and 1998 the station was somewhat profitable but ratings were modest at best. Advertising on the station gradually faded in 1998. With WQEW leaving the format after Christmas 1998, it was hoped that WVNJ would pick up some of their advertisers and ratings. However, by 1999 Adult Standards had become a tough format to sell and WVNJ was losing sponsors. As a result, the station began automating evenings and overnights. In 2002, WVNJ began selling blocks of evening time as well as blocks of weekend time to specialty programmers as well as for infomercials. By 2003, WVNJ added more infomercials to middays during the week as well in order to turn a profit. By 2006, WVNJ was down to only a few hours of music per week. =WVNJ \\"The Voice\\"= Starting in late 2006, WVNJ became \\" The Voice\\". When the format first began, the station remained playing music, more talk shows and infomercials were added as 2007 rolled in. WVNJ began to lose the standards music and added more talk and infomercials. Later on in 2007 WVNJ added its first morning talk show called \\"The Voice In The Morning\\" with Gary O'Neill and Kathleen Maloney. The show was canceled in early November 2007 and replaced in January 2008 by another local morning show. The replacement was a talk show hosted by Sam GreenfieldSam Greenfield (formerly of WEVD and WWRL) and long time WVNJ announcer Pete Buckey.

Montgomery was a two-term president of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). Montgomery was the author of numerous books on auditing and taxation including Auditing Theory and Practice, a bestseller originally published in 1912 which is still in print today. He was successful in three professions despite his lack of formal education, having not even completed high school.  Life and work  Montgomery quit school at the age of 14 and went to work in order to help out his family. In 1889 he got a job as an office boy at an accounting firm in Philadelphia. There he learned accounting and was made partner after seven years. Two years later in 1898, Montgomery and three of his colleagues, William M. Lybrand, Adam A. Ross Jr., and his brother T. Edward Ross, formed Lybrand, Ross Brothers & Montgomery. Two years later the firm opened an office in New York City under Montgomery's management. In his spare time Montgomery learned law. He was admitted to the New York Bar in 1904. Montgomery established his own law firm, Robert H. Montgomery, Attorney at Law, and worked on many difficult tax cases for clients. In 1905 Montgomery led a reorganization of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). He created the Journal of Accountancy (then called the American Journal of Accounting). The first issue contained his Professional Standards. He was president of the AICPA for two two-year terms, first in 1912 and again in 1935. Next, Montgomery also got into the field of education by developing a curriculum in accounting for Columbia University. He was hired as Columbia's first accounting professor in 1910 and stayed there until 1939. Montgomery saw the need for a book on auditing. In 1912 he wrote Auditing: Theory and Practice. This was the first American book on auditing. For the seventh editions two other authors joined him and the book was retitled Montgomery's Auditing. After Montgomery's death the eighth edition was published in 1957 by two other authors. It is still in print and is now in its 12th edition. Commissioned as a Lieutenant Colonel (1918) during World War I, he was generally referred to thereafter as Colonel Montgomery. He received the AICPA's Gold Medal Award in 1949. In 1950, he was inducted into the Accounting Hall of Fame, in the first year of that award. Montgomery was a highly respected leader of the profession of accountancy for over 60 years. His influence is still felt in the areas of auditing theory and practice, federal income taxation, professional accounting organizations, and accounting education. =Personal life= Montgomery lived in Greenwich, Connecticut, and commuted to work in New York City. He established a winter home in north Florida in 1927. He sold it and moved to the suburbs of Miami, Florida in 1930 to be in a more tropic area. Here he decided to collect palm trees. He built an estate which he called the Coconut Grove Palmetum on Old Cutler Drive about seven miles south of Coconut Grove. His love of tropical plants led him to establish a public garden. With the help of others he led the effort to establish Fairchild Tropical Garden in 1937, which opened to the public on March 23, 1938. Legacy In 1957 Cooper Brothers & Co (UK), McDonald, Currie and Co (Canada), and Lybrand, Ross Brothers & Montgomery (US) merged to form Coopers & Lybrand. For the rest of the century Coopers & Lybrand was known as one of the \\"Big Eight\\". On 1 July 1998 the worldwide merger of Price Waterhouse and Coopers & Lybrand created the current PricewaterhouseCoopers. PricewaterhouseCoopers is the world's largest professional services firm measured by revenues and one of the \\"Big Four\\" accountancy firms. Montgomery established a collection of pine trees at his home in Greenwich, CT. In 1953 he donated his estate to the town and it is now a 102-acre park in the center of Greenwich. In commemoration of his donation a cultivar of the Colorado spruce was named Picea pungens 'Montgomery' in his honor. Montgomery collected manuscript account books and documents which illustrate and document the history of accounting and business procedures from the 14th century into the 20th century. He donated his collection to Columbia University in 1926. These books constitute the Montgomery Collection at the Rare Book and Manuscript Library in the Butler Library at Columbia University. The materials from his collection were featured in a 1987 Rare Book and Manuscript exhibit at Columbia entitled \\"The Origins of a Great Profession.\\" The Montgomery Botanical Center was established in 1959 by Nell Montgomery Jennings in memory of her husband, Colonel Robert H. Montgomery, and his love of palms and cycads. Located on 120 acres in Coral Gables it includes the largest and finest private collections of palms and cycads in the world.

They are part of Ubisoft's My Coach series, and were released for the Nintendo DS on November 6, 2007 in North America, for the Wii on November 23, 2007 in Europe, and My Spanish Coach was released for the PlayStation Portable on October 7, 2008, and iOS on June 6, 2009. For their releases in Europe and Australia, the games were renamed My French Coach Level 1: Beginners and My Spanish Coach Level 1: Beginners. French and Spanish language teachers assisted with development of the gameplay for both games, which concentrates on teaching French or Spanish using lessons and minigames. As the player progresses the lessons, the gameplay uses increasingly complex words and phrases. The games received praise and criticism from various video game publications; they praised the games' effectiveness in teaching the language, but lamented their repetitive nature. The next installments in the series, titled My French Coach Level 2: Intermediate and My Spanish Coach Level 2: Intermediate, also developed and published by Ubisoft, were released in Europe on November 23, 2007 alongside their Level 1 counterparts. Gameplay The player going through the vocabulary given during the 44th lesson in My Spanish Coach; the player can listen to the pronunciation of the words in this sequence. The gameplay of My French Coach and My Spanish Coach consists of the player completing lessons that introduce new vocabulary and then focus on mastering the words through several puzzles. As the player progresses through the game, the words increase in difficulty. When first starting the game, the player takes an introductory test that gauges their initial comprehension level of the French or Spanish language. The player is then placed into a level reflective of the score they received on the test. A player who scores highly will be able to skip many of the initial levels and more basic concepts. When starting a lesson, the player is shown ten new words, which include nouns, verbs, adjectives, or adverbs, as well as their meanings and proper enunciation. Following this, the player is offered a choice of eight minigames to test their knowledge of the words given in the lesson. These minigames are Multiple Choice, Hit-A-Word, Word Find, Flash Cards, Fill in the Blank, Memory, Bridge Builder, and Spelltastic. In Multiple Choice, the player must select the correct French or Spanish translation of an English word from four choices in a limited time frame. Hit-A-Word is a Whac- A-Mole game in which the player must hit the most moles with the correct translation of an English word within the allotted time. Word Find is a word search in which the player must find the French or Spanish translations of a set of English words or phrases. In Flash Cards, the player is given a French or Spanish word and must choose the card with the proper English translation. In Memory, the player must select from a set of face-down cards a French or Spanish word and its English translation. Bridge Builder tests sentence structure; the player has to construct a proper sentence from a set of given words. In Spelltastic, the player listens to a French or Spanish word and spells it using a keyboard within the allotted time. For Fill-in-the-Blank, the player selects the proper conjugation of a French or Spanish verb within a sentence. Whenever a player correctly answers a question or solves a puzzle in a minigame, they gain \\"mastery points\\" on the word they successfully answered. The minigames can be increased in difficulty; on higher difficulty levels, players will acquire more mastery points when successfully completing a minigame. For instance, in Multiple Choice, the player has 50 seconds to select an answer for a question on the \\"Easy\\" difficulty, and will receive two mastery points for each correct answer. On the \\"Medium\\" difficulty, the player has 40 seconds to select an answer and receives three mastery points for each correct answer. The process continues until the player scores fifteen mastery points for every word, allowing the player to proceed to the next lesson. Following the completion of all fifty lessons, the player can continue to learn new words through \\"open lessons\\" that contain ten new vocabulary words apiece; the dictionaries of both games each hold nearly 10,000 words. The player can freely access the reference section, which contains a dictionary and phrasebook, at any time. Both the dictionary and phrasebook hold all of the words and phrases in each game, as well as meanings and audio files for both; the player can look through different categories of words and phrases, use a search function, and bookmark chosen phrases. Development My French Coach and My Spanish Coach are two of the first three games Ubisoft released for the My Coach series; the other game is My Word Coach. During the course of their development by Sensory Sweep Studios, the lessons and minigames were created with the help of French and Spanish language teachers. Ubisoft announced the creation of a new division to create the My Coach series on May 21, 2007, and that Pauline Jacquey, the producer of the Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon and Rayman series, would lead the division. When commenting on the direction of the My Coach series, Jacquey said that she was \\"developing projects that make people feel that playing games is worth their while, allowing them to spend quality time with family and friends, learn a new skill, or improve their daily lives\\". Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot commented that, \\"The timing is right for us to leverage our creativity and to open up the video games market to new consumers who will be attracted by content that can help them learn, grow and feel better in an entertaining way\\". All three games were released on November 6, 2007 in North America. Ubisoft followed with a PlayStation Portable version of My Spanish Coach, releasing it in North America on October 7, 2008; Wii versions of My French Coach and My Spanish Coach were released in Europe on November 30, 2007. The European releases for My French Coach, titled My French Coach Level 1: Beginners, and My Spanish Coach, renamed My Spanish Coach Level 1: Beginners, were accompanied by My French Coach Level 2: Intermediate and My Spanish Coach Level 2: Intermediate, the next games in the series. Reception My French Coach and My Spanish Coach have received generally favorable reviews from several video game publications. On Metacritic, a website that compiles scores from various video game reviews, My Spanish Coach received a 73/100, based on seven reviews. In a review of the DS versions of both games, IGN called them a \\"great learning experience\\" and a more entertaining alternative to traditional methods of learning French and Spanish such as \\"[h]ours of boring exercises and outdated videos\\". Eurogamer claimed the games were not substitutes for proper language lessons, but admitted that \\"as tools for improving your language skills, whether you're starting from scratch or have some basic knowledge, they're great\\". In a review of the DS version of My French Coach, Nintendo World Report called the game \\"not be the hottest game to ever sit in your DS, but it is an unusually polished product that achieves the edutainment holy grail ‚Äì it makes learning easy and fun\\". During the 2007 Christmas holiday season, video game retailer GameStop recommended My Spanish Coach for \\"The Academic Gamer\\". My Spanish Coach led all Nintendo DS games in sales during the week of August 15, 2008 to August 21, 2008. The gameplay received mixed reviews from critics. In a review of the PSP version of My Spanish Coach, IGN noted that acquiring mastery points in the minigames lead to \\"quite a bit of grinding\\" due to the game's repetitive structure. Nevertheless, IGN accepted that the repetition was an effective way to learn the vocabulary, and noted that \\"[p]icking up on things like gender and age, emphasis and the breakdowns of the actual language itself and proper/casual ways of conversing are made fairly clear and reinforced regularly\\". IGN's review of the DS versions of both games commented that neither game taught the future or past tense, calling it one of the \\"most disappointing\\" aspects of the game, but praised the effective incorporation of the DS stylus into the minigames. Eurogamer noted that the minigames were \\"only really good for practicing reading\\" due to a lack of games for practicing proper speaking, but GameZone disagreed, noting that the player was able to hear their attempt to speak the French or Spanish words alongside the correct pronunciation during lessons, and praised this aspect as the \\"most interesting and intriguing feature of [My French Coach and My Spanish Coach]\\". In a review of the DS version of My Spanish Coach, Nintendo World Report lamented that many of the minigames \\"exhibit the same type of unimaginative boringness\\" and that \\"it takes ages to unlock new lessons and mini-games\\"; however, it noted that the minigames were \\"extremely effective\\" and \\"constructed extremely well\\" in terms of teaching the language. Nintendo World Report's review of the DS version of My French Coach called the game's reference section \\"a very handy travel dictionary\\", noting that having a dictionary list and a phrasebook with audio files that could bookmark chosen phrases was \\"an absurd value\\". The games' graphics and audio also received praise and criticism from reviewers. IGN's review of the PSP version of My Spanish Coach noted that the fact that the game appeared on multiple platforms contributed to its \\"sparse look and feel\\" because the games' graphics and audio were made for the Nintendo DS. Eurogamer praised the games' \\"clean, crisp visuals\\" and \\"jolly accordion music and jolly fiesta music\\". In contrast, IGN's review of the DS versions of both games called the music \\"catchy but repetitive\\" and the graphics \\"cute but nothing to write home about\\". GameZone noted that \\"[t]he visual concept was obviously not a front runner in [the games'] conception\\", and that the audio of neither game \\"[does] anything remotely special\\". Nintendo World Report made note of the games' narrator during the lessons, praising its \\"clear and coherent glory\\" in terms of pronouncing the words correctly.

By the time Germany declared war on the United States in 1941 he had joined the newly created Office of Strategic Services as an analyst, but quickly changed to the Psychological Warfare Branch of the Office of War Information. He followed U.S. troops to Tunisia and Italy monitoring German radio and interrogating prisoners of war. By the beginning of 1945 he was attached to the Psychological Warfare Division of General Eisenhower's Supreme Headquarters. Inside Germany In April 1945 he seized the chance of leading an investigative team into Germany searching for head of Nazi party publishing Max Amann. On this assignment he also came to Marburg, where he realized his true calling would be to revive the German university system. He let himself be transferred to the Education and Religious Affairs Section of OMGUS (Office of Military Government, U.S. for Germany), usually simply called the Military Government. At first, he joined Major General Morrison C. Stayer on an inspection tour of medical schools in July 1945. These medical schools turned out to be the loophole for the conservation of German universities as a whole which according to standing orders should have been completely closed down. Soon Hartshorne was recognized to be the most knowledgeable specialist on higher education in Germany. He was directly in charge of Heidelberg and Marburg. Using these two universities as test cases Hartshorne developed the standard operating procedure for the denazification and reopening of all seven universities in the U.S. zone, i.e. he had to select the ones capable of opening ‚Äì Giessen was closed down in the process ‚Äì and planned and supervised the process of opening. Moreover, he was also involved in shaping university policy in general. Before the local planning committees began to function he had to drive around the country never staying for more than four days at any one place. After the Land Greater Hesse had been proclaimed Hartshorne became in charge of higher education there (universities at Frankfurt, Giessen, and Marburg) in October. He also succeeded in convincing his wife to come to Germany. She arrived with their three children in June 1946. Early death In the spring of 1946 reports had appeared of incomplete denazification of Bavarian universities in the U.S. press. General Lucius Clay sent Hartshorne to investigate. On this assignment he was shot in the evening of August 28 while driving north on the Autobahn to Nuremberg. Hartshorne never regained consciousness until he died two days later. In just fifteen months he had denazified and reopened the three German universities of Heidelberg, Marburg, and Frankfurt and had prepared the opening of all the other universities in the American zone but one.

Although he thought there were no tickets left, Mrs. Post has managed to get special seats on the stage. McKann is dressed inappropriately for a night out. He gets bored throughout the concert, and the singer Kitty Ayrshire notices his yawns and glares. Later that night on his way to a train to New York City, he accepts a request to drive the singer to the station, as her car has stopped working. She only finds out it is him when they get to the railway station in East Liberty, as she couldn't see his face properly before that. Once on the train, she decides to join him and to ask him why he didn't like her performance. He says he is a serious businessman and he despises artists. She later tells her maid Celine she doesn't think he is very smart. The next day he realises she has dropped one of her golden slippers, and decides to tuck it into his suitcase. At his hotel he bins it, but the cleaning-lady puts it back in his closet, thinking it must have been a mistake. He decides to keep it, and stashes it in a box for no one else to see. Years later, he has become 'morbid', or depressed. Kitty, on the contrary, has forgotten all about it. Characters *Marshall McKann. He is a Presbyterian and supports the Republican Party.

Yao Shu (ÂßöÁíπ) (632‚Äì705), courtesy name Lingzhang (‰ª§Áíã), formally Count Cheng of Wuxing (Âê≥ËààÊàê‰ºØ), was an official of the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty and Wu Zetian's Zhou Dynasty, serving twice as chancellor during Wu Zetian's reign.  Background  Yao Shu was born in 632, during the reign of Emperor Taizong. His grandfather was the historian Yao Silian, the lead author of the Book of Liang and Book of Chen, the official histories of Liang Dynasty and Chen Dynasty. His father Yao Chuping (ÂßöËôïÂπ≥)Chuping apparently was a courtesy name that Yao Shu's father generally used in lieu of his formal name, but his formal name, while rendered in the table of chancellors' family trees in the New Book of Tang, is not in Unicode and therefore not available online. See New Book of Tang, vol. 74, part 2. served as a military census officer and died early. Yao Shu raised his brothers and sisters and was said to be kind to them. He was also said to be well-studied and good at rhetoric.  During Emperor Gaozong's reign  During the middle part of the Yonghui era of Emperor Taizong's son and successor Emperor Gaozong (650-656), Yao Shu passed the imperial examination and was made a secretary at the mansion of Emperor Gaozong's crown prince Li Hong. While serving there, he participated in a compilation work commissioned by Li Hong, the Yaoshan Yucai (Áë§Â±±ÁéâÂΩ©), and after the work was completed, he was made Mishu Lang (ÁßòÊõ∏ÈÉé), a secretary at the Palace Library. During Emperor Gaozong's Tiaolu era (679-680), he was promoted to be Zhongshu Sheren (‰∏≠Êõ∏Ëàç‰∫∫), a mid-level official at the legislative bureau of government (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng) and created the Viscount of Wuxing.  During Emperor Zhongzong's and Emperor Ruizong's first reigns  Emperor Gaozong died in 683 and was succeeded by his son Li Zhe the Crown Prince (as Emperor Zhongzong) (Li Hong's brother, as Li Hong had predeceased Emperor Gaozong), but actual power was in the hands of Emperor Gaozong's powerful wife Empress Wu (later known as Wu Zetian), as empress dowager and regent. In 684, when Emperor Zhongzong displayed signs of independence, she deposed him and replaced him with his brother Li Dan the Prince of Yu (as Emperor Ruizong), but thereafter wielded power even more firmly. Later that year, Li Jingye the Duke of YIng started a rebellion against her with the articulated goal of restoring Emperor Zhongzong, but the rebellion was quickly defeated. As Yao Shu's cousin Yao Jingjie (ÂßöÊï¨ÁØÄ) participated in Li Jingye's rebellion, Yao Shu was demoted to be the secretary general for the commandant at Gui Prefecture (Ê°ÇÂ∑û, roughly modern Guilin, Guangxi). Once Yao Shu got to Gui Prefecture, he, knowing that Empress Dowager Wu favored signs of good fortune, visited the mountains and forests of the area, and collected a number of items containing the character \\"Wu.\\" He then submitted them as signs of fortune, and this pleased her greatly. She recalled him to serve as the deputy minister of civil service affairs (Â§©ÂÆò‰æçÈÉé, Tianguan Shilang). He was said to be good at selecting people to serve as officials and was praised for this ability.  During Wu Zetian's reign  In 690, Empress Dowager Wu had Emperor Ruizong yield the throne to her, and she took the throne as \\"emperor,\\" establishing Zhou and interrupting Tang. In 692, she made Yao Shu Wenchang Zuo Cheng (ÊñáÊòåÂ∑¶‰∏û), one of the secretaries general at the executive bureau (ÊñáÊòåËá∫, Wenchang Tai), and gave him the designation of Tong Fengge Luantai Pingzhangshi (ÂêåÈ≥≥Èñ£È∏ûËá∫Âπ≥Á´†‰∫ã), making him a chancellor de facto. At that time, the customs called for officials in charge of recording imperial history to record the acts of the emperors and chancellors, but as Wu Zetian's meetings with the chancellors rarely included those official historians, the meetings were not being recorded. Yao believed that given the importance of the meetings, they should be recorded, and therefore advocated that, by rotation, one of the chancellors be required to record the meetings. Wu Zetian agreed, and this became a custom thereafter followed. Later in 692, however, he was accused of improprieties not recorded in historical accounts, and he was made the minister of vassal affairs (Âè∏Ë≥ìÂçø, Sibin Qing), no longer a chancellor.The Zizhi Tongjian dated his removal from chancellor position as in 693, but this conflicts with his biography in the Old Book of Tang and the table of chancellors in the New Book of Tang. Compare Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 205, with Old Book of Tang, vol. 89 and New Book of Tang, vol. 61. In 694, Wu Zetian made Yao Shu Nayan (Á¥çË®Ä), the head of the examination bureau (È∏ûËá∫, Luantai) and a post considered one for a chancellor. Around that time, there was an incident where his fellow chancellor Doulu Qinwang, without informing the other officials what the contents of his petition was, ordered the other officials to sign a petition‚Äîwhich, without their knowledge, contained an offer for all officials to give up two months of salary in order to aid in the war effort against Eastern Tujue. When Doulu's subordinate Wang Qiuli (ÁéãÊ±ÇÁ¶Æ) objected, on the account that the low level officials would not be able to support themselves if they gave up two months of salary, and reported this objection in person to Wu Zetian, Yao initially tried to rebuke Wang, stating, \\"Wang Qiuli, you do not know what is important.\\" Wang responded, \\"Do you, Yao Shu, really know what is important?\\" Thereafter, however, apparently by Wu Zetian's directive, the matter of having the officials give up two months of salary was no longer mentioned. Later that year, when Wu Zetian's nephew Wu Sansi proposed that a pillar made of copper and iron be built to commemorate Wu Zetian's reign and to deprecate Tang, Wu Zetian put Yao in charge of the project, and it was said that the project required so much metal that he ordered farmers to give up their farming equipment to be melted down for the material. After the completion of the pillar, Wu Zetian was set to give him a greater title, when he requested that instead posthumous honors be granted on his father Yao Chuping. Wu Zetian agreed, and posthumously honored Yao Chuping as a prefect. In 695, Wu Zetian's lover Huaiyi, because she had another lover, Shen Nanqiu (Ê≤àÂçóÁíÜ), was jealous, and set the imperial meeting hall (ÊòéÂ†Ç, Ming Tang) on fire‚Äîan event that Wu Zetian hid the truth of and indicated was an accidental fire, but she considered stopping an imperial feast she was holding at the time to show humility in light of what might be divine disapproval. Yao opposed, however, stating: Wu Zetian agreed, continued to feast, and further ordered that the meeting hall be rebuilt, with Yao in charge. After it was rebuilt, she gave him the honorific title Yinqing Guanglu Daifu (ÈäÄÈùíÂÖâÁ•øÂ§ßÂ§´). In 696, the Umayyad Caliphate offered to give Wu Zetian a lion as a gift. Yao opposed accepting the gift, stating: Wu Zetian agreed and declined the lion. Also at Yao's suggestion, she stopped a proposal to coat with gold nine ding that she had built as symbols of her governance. Later in 696, when Khitan's khan Li Jinzhong attacked, she commissioned Wu Sansi to serve as the commander of an army to defend against Khitan attacks and had Yao serve as Wu Sansi's assistant. During the campaign, Eastern Tujue's khan Ashina Mochuo indicated that he was willing to be aligned with Zhou against Khitan and made a number of requests for return of Tujue people who had surrendered to Zhou, various treasures, and food supplies, which, after Yao and fellow chancellor Yang Zaisi argued were necessary to maintain an alliance with Eastern Tujue, Wu Zetian agreed to give Ashina Mochuo, allowing him to become even stronger than before. After the end of the campaign against Khitan in 697, there was accusations against Yao, and she demoted him to be the secretary general at Yi Prefecture (ÁõäÂ∑û, roughly modern Chengdu, Sichuan). At the time that Yao went to Yi Prefecture, it was said that the low level officials of the region were largely corrupt and violent. Yao made thorough examinations and removed many of them. Wu Zetian appreciated his efforts and wrote him a letter to thank him, and further commented, \\"It is easy for a superior official to be clean himself, but it is difficult for him to make his subordinates clean. Yao Shu is able to do both.\\" Around that same time, however, there was an incident where Zhu Daipi (Êú±ÂæÖËæü), the secretary general of Xindu County (Êñ∞ÈÉΩ, in modern Chengdu), part of Yao's responsible area, was accused of corruption and sentenced to death. Zhu was friendly with a large number of Buddhist monks in the area, and it was said that Zhu secretly organized them to prepare to rebel, kill Yao, and occupy the region. This plot was reported to Yao, and Yao investigated and killed thousands of people. Wu Zetian further sent the secret police officials Song Yuanshuang (ÂÆãÂÖÉÁàΩ) and Huo Xianke (ÈúçÁçªÂèØ) to investigate, and several hundred more people were arrested and tortured. A large number of people were executed or exiled, and there was much mourning for the excessive killing. The imperial censor Yuan Shuji, believing that the investigations were improper, submitted articles of impeachment against Yao, and Wu Zetian initially ordered that Yuan and Yao debate with each other, but soon cancelled the debate. She promoted Yao to be the minister of treasury (Âú∞ÂÆòÂ∞öÊõ∏, Diguan Shangshu), and then instead made him the minister of public works (ÂÜ¨ÂÆòÂ∞öÊõ∏, Dongguan Shangshu). She also put him in charge of the western capital Chang'an. During the middle of her Chang'an era (701-705), he requested retirement, which she approved, and promoted his title to be that of a count.  During Emperor Zhongzong's second reign  In 705, Wu Zetian was overthrown in a coup, and Emperor Zhongzong was restored. He made Yao Shu the minister of public works again, now with the restored Tang name of Gongbu Shangshu (Â∑•ÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏). Yao died later that year and, by his will, was buried without much ceremony.

None of his poetic work survives. Jean de Nostredame listed one Luco ou Lucas de Grymaud, natif de Grymauld en Provence as a Proven√ßal troubadour, and speculated that his birthplace may also have been Gennes. However, it is more probable that he was of the Grimaldi family of Genoa. He was once identified with a Luchetto Grimaldi from the same period, but a medieval document, Liber Jurium Januae, mentions both a Luca and a Luchetto de Grimaldo. The first mention of a Luca Grimaldi is in a document formalising the alliance between Genoa and Milan against the Emperor Frederick II in 1240. There was a Luca, son of Grimaldo de Grimaldi, who was the brother of Bovarello, the Genoese ambassador to Charles I of Provence in 1252. This was probably the troubadour, not to be confused with another Luca Grimaldi, son of one Ugo and first cousin of the poet, who was podest√† of Florence in 1257. In 1255, a certain Luca Grimaldi married his daughter Alasina to Pasqualino Usodimare, who promised not to consummate the marriage until she was twelve. It is not known if this was the troubadour or his cousin. In 1242 Luca Grimaldi appears as podest√† of Milan. By 1253 he had returned to Genoa, where he appears in several acts of the podest√† along with Alberto Fieschi. In that year he purchased a precious throne from the cash-strapped Conrad IV; he re- sold it to Manfred a few years later. In 1258 he was sent as an ambassador of Genoa to the court of Pope Alexander IV and in 1262 he was elected, along with fellow troubadour Jacme Grils and other citizens, as rector of the city. Luca Grimaldi was also familiar with the troubadours Simon Doria and Luchetto Gattilusio, beside both of whom he appears in a document of 1267. In 1269 Luca and his brother Bovarello were charged by Charles of Provence, now King of Naples, with receiving the ambassadors of the \\"Sultan of Babylonia\\", actually the Abbasid caliph then in Cairo, Al-Hakim I, in Genoa. Luca Grimaldi was ever a Guelph at heart. In 1271 he was elected podest√† in Ventimiglia and he spent his term there working for the Guelph cause. The Ghibellines in Genoa, however, rebelled, and, on 28 October 1271, in a major battle, the Guelphs were defeated and many were captured, including Luca Grimaldi, who was imprisoned for twenty three years. He had died by 18 April 1275, when a Genoese document refers to him and his brother Bovarello as dead. Nostradamus dated his death to 1308, but this is certainly wrong.

Seeing police ahead while the traffic had stopped, Nicolas' father becomes nervous and conceals all loose items within the car in the trunk ‚Äì and we see that Nicolas' travel bag is next to several matching briefcases. Nicolas subsequently forgets his bag in his father's car, increasing his awkwardness. He is befriended by Hodkann, another pupil. One of Nicolas main fears is wetting his bed, and the situation gets worse when he gets a bed just above Hodkann. At night Nicolas tries to stay awake but falls asleep, waking up from a wet dream but believing he has wet his pants. He leaves his bed to clean his clothes and while returning he discovers it snowing outside. Nicolas goes outside into the freezing cold and ends up locked out, and in desperation curls up inside the car of his ski instructor, Patrick. Before he drifts off to sleep he sees a van driving away. He is found in the morning by Patrick and is taken in to a study with a fever. Later that day he goes to a caf√© while the other boys are skiing. While in the caf√©, police come looking for Ren√©, a young boy who is missing. That night while sleeping he has a nightmare. He dreams that he is at a theme park with Hodkann and Patrick and that he goes on a giant caterpillar while his little brother is looked after by another seemingly friendly man. Once he is on the caterpillar he sees his brother being walked to a white van by the stranger. Later he is found outside the park after having one of his organs taken. The dream is poignant because Nicolas, months before, had not been allowed to go on a similar ride because it would have meant leaving one of the brothers with a stranger. After declining the stranger's offer to watch the brother, Nicolas' father warns against stranger danger, claiming this includes a risk of organ theft. At the end of the story Nicolas finds that his father was not in an accident as he had day dreamed, but rather that his father was a \\"monster\\" and possibly abused children. (Although it is never explained why the father has been arrested). The movie ends with Nicolas being driven to his mother's home by Patrick, with the fate of his father and the friendship between Nicolas and Hodkann left to the viewers imagination.

Hopi Clan Mothers  The Hopi (in what is now the Hopi Reservation in northeastern Arizona), according to Alice Schlegel, had as its \\"gender ideology ... one of female superiority, and it operated within a social actuality of sexual equality.\\"Schlegel, Alice, Hopi Gender Ideology of Female Superiority, in Quarterly Journal of Ideology: \\"A Critique of the Conventional Wisdom\\", vol. VIII, no. 4, 1984, p. 44 and see pp. 44‚Äì52 (essay based partly on \\"seventeen years of fieldwork among the Hopi\\", per p. 44 n. 1) (author of Dep't of Anthropology, Univ. of Ariz., Tucson). According to Diana LeBow (based on Schlegel's work), in the Hopi, \\"gender roles ... are egalitarian .... [and] [n]either sex is inferior.\\"LeBow, Diana, Rethinking Matriliny Among the Hopi, op. cit., p. [8]. LeBow concluded that Hopi women \\"participate fully in ... political decision-making.\\"LeBow, Diana, Rethinking Matriliny Among the Hopi, op. cit., p. 18. According to Schlegel, \\"the Hopi no longer live as they are described here\\"Schlegel, Alice, Hopi Gender Ideology of Female Superiority, op. cit., p. 44 n. 1. and \\"the attitude of female superiority is fading\\". Schlegel said the Hopi \\"were and still are matrilinial\\"Schlegel, Alice, Hopi Gender Ideology of Female Superiority, op. cit., p. 45. and \\"the household ... was matrilocal\\". Schlegel explains why there was female superiority as that the Hopi believed in \\"life as the highest good ... [with] the female principle ... activated in women and in Mother Earth ... as its source\\" and that the Hopi \\"were not in a stf continual war with equally matched neighbors\\"Schlegel, Alice, Hopi Gender Ideology of Female Superiority, op. cit., p. 49. and \\"had no standing army\\" so that \\"the Hopi lacked the spur to masculine superiority\\" and, within that, as that women were central to institutions of clan and household and predominated \\"within the economic and social systems (in contrast to male predominance within the political and ceremonial systems)\\", the Clan Mother, for example, being empowered to overturn land distribution by men if she felt it was unfair,Schlegel, Alice, Hopi Gender Ideology of Female Superiority, op. cit., p. 50. since there was no \\"countervailing ... strongly centralized, male- centered political structure\\".  Iroquois Clan Mothers  The Iroquois clan mother is responsible for the welfare of the clan. She names all the people of the clan and holds a position in nominating, installing and removing the male chief, the Hoyaneh (\\"Caretaker of the Peace\\"). They are considered the life givers. Each clan mother has a Faithkeeper who is responsible for ceremonial preparations, weddings, funerals, and other rituals.http://www.rain.org/campinternet/american-history/iroquois-role-of- clan-mother.html The clan mother's position is hereditary; her title rests within the clan and is usually passed on to her female relatives, looking first at her eldest sisters, other sisters, then her eldest daughter and other daughters.Loretta Kemsley, MATRIARCH: An Iroquois Celebration of Womanhood The Kanien'k√©ha word for clan mother, Oi√°:ner, translates to English as \\"righteous\\" or \\"she is good\\". The Iroquois had 9 clans divided into three elements. The land element was represented by the wolf, deer and bear clans; the air element by the heron, snipe and hawk clans; and the water element by the beaver, eel and turtle clans.Rodriguez, Jennifer A Clan Mother's Call: Reconstructing Haudenosaunee Cultural Memory Albany: SUNY Press, 2017 page 38. The basic unit of the traditional Haudenosaunee society was the clan forming \\"firesides\\" of a husband, wife and their children; a typical clan in a village would number between 50-200 people. Every clan was divided into two groups called moieties which carried out various rituals. Every clan was headed by a clan mother. Some of the most famous Haudenosaunee leaders have been clan mothers, most notably the half-French Madam Montour and her daughter French Margaret and her granddaughter Queen Esther. The Haudenosaunee League was founded according to their legends by a prophet known as the Great Peacemaker who brought the Five Nations together sometime in the 12th century, and since his first convert was a woman named Jigonhsasee and generally his first followers were women, the institution of the clan mothers was a tribute to this aspect of the story.Rodriguez, Jennifer A Clan Mother's Call: Reconstructing Haudenosaunee Cultural Memory Albany: SUNY Press, 2017 pages 41-42. In Haudenosaunee legend, before the Great Peacemaker, what became the Five Nations were dominated by a brutal struggle between an all-male, cannibal cult called the \\"Hunters\\" vs. the all-female society of farmers called the \\"Cultivators\\". In the story, not all the men joined the cannibal cult, and instead stand by their women, revering the \\"corn mothers\\" (another term for clan mother) who knew how to farm, and defeat the cannibal cult. In tribute to Jigonhasee's work and his other female followers, the Great Peacemaker had decreed that men and women were to be equal and the clan mothers were to choose the leaders of the League.Rodriguez, Jennifer A Clan Mother's Call: Reconstructing Haudenosaunee Cultural Memory Albany: SUNY Press, 2017 page 42. For the Haudenosaunee, the universe was divided into two halves that needed each other to co-exist as for them, the concept of east was meaningless without the west and the concept of the west was meaningless without the east. In this way of understanding the universe, male and female were different aspects of the world that needed each other to co-exist in order for the world to continue, and as such, women were seen as the equals of men. The councils of the clan mothers, whose powers were equal to the councils of the chiefs, were a way of balancing out the male and female to achieve social harmony. One Iroquois told the American author Jeanette Rodriguez: \\"Within our society, we maintain a balance between the responsibilities of the women, the responsibilities of men, of the chiefs and of the faithkeepers. All of our men in between have to keep this balance so that at no time and no place does anyone have more power than the rest; for our leadership to function, all must have equal power. They must speak to one another\\". In Haudenosaunee mythology, it was the Sky Woman who came from the Sky world inhabited by the supernatural beings who fell from the Sky world down to what became the earth, and who is the mother of all life in this world, thus making women more worthy of respect. For the Haudenosaunee, it was the Sky woman who created all life on the earth, and women as the bearers of life, are seen as her heirs, being seen as spiritually part of the \\"mother earth\\" that nurtures all life. The Sky woman was considered to be the First Clan Mother, and her daughter, the Lynx Woman, the Second Clan Mother. Since Turtle Island (i.e. North America) was created for the Sky Woman when she fell to the earth, the Haudenosaunee traditionally gave ownership of the land to women. Reflecting this identification of \\"mother earth\\" with the feminine, for the Haudenosaunee farming was strictly women's work, and the staple crops of corn, squash and beans were known as the \\"Three Sisters\\". One of the laws credited to the Great Peacemaker declared that: > The lineal descent of the People of the Five Nations shall run in the female > line. Women shall be considered proprietors of the nation. They shall own > the land and the soil. Men and women shall the status of the mother. However, the Haudenosaunee were by no means anti-male; in the Sky Woman story, the spirit of the North Wind seeks to seduce her teenage daughter, the Lynx Woman, by taking the forms of various animals until finally the North Spirit spirit takes a form she cannot resist, that of a handsome young man, and thereby fathers two twins. The 19th century American feminist Matilda Joslyn Gage was greatly influenced by seeing the power of the clan mothers, which she deemed \\"mother rule\\" or a \\"matriarchate\\", and by their Haudenosaunee creation story, where it is a goddess who lives in harmony with nature rather than a patriarchal God who created all life in the world. Finally, the clan mothers conduct the cross-over ceremony which marks the end of childhood and the beginning of adolescence.Rodriguez, Jennifer A Clan Mother's Call: Reconstructing Haudenosaunee Cultural Memory Albany: SUNY Press, 2017 page 50. The cross-over ceremonies consists of much fasting, teaching, a period of seclusion and finally a ceremony involving singing and dancing that marks the symbolic beginning of adolescence.Rodriguez, Jennifer A Clan Mother's Call: Reconstructing Haudenosaunee Cultural Memory Albany: SUNY Press, 2017 page 51. The Haudenosaunee view life as consisting of several stages starting with conception itself with sex regarded as a sacred act that symbolically united the dual male and female aspects of the universe in order to create new life.Rodriguez, Jennifer A Clan Mother's Call: Reconstructing Haudenosaunee Cultural Memory Albany: SUNY Press, 2017 page 52. Sex is often described by the Haudenosaunnee as the sacred \\"Rite of Conception\\" that begins new life, and for the Haudenosaunee the Christian concept of Jesus's virgin birth is bizarre. Birth is viewed as the second stage of life, with the clan mothers formally welcoming the newly born child into the world.Rodriguez, Jennifer A Clan Mother's Call: Reconstructing Haudenosaunee Cultural Memory Albany: SUNY Press, 2017 page 53. The end of \\"toothlessness\\" when toddlers grow their teeth is seen as the end of infancy and the beginning of childhood, which is the third stage of life. The crossover ceremonies marking the end of childhood and the beginning of first adolescence and then the end of adolescence and the beginning of adulthood are seen as the fourth and fifth states of life. The cross-over ceremonies involved much fasting over a 20-day period, and clan mothers generally provide advice and encouragement to the young people undergoing the fast. During the fasting phrase of the cross-over ceremonies, clan mothers often provide advice and encouragement to the fasting young people. Historically, the clan mothers selected the 50 sachems who ran the Haudenosaunee League that comprised the Five Nations of the Cayuga, Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, and Seneca, and who became the Six Nations when the Tuscarora joined the League in 1722.Paxton, James Joseph Brant and His World: 18th Century Mohawk Warrior and Statesman, Toronto: James Lorimer, 2008 page 8. The clan mothers would consult other senior women in her clan before naming a chief. The clans formed the local government in the League, and most importantly, the clans cut across the differences between the Five Nations as each of the Five Nations were divided into the 9 clans. The clan mothers also had the power to dismiss any chief or sachem who was felt to be falling in his duties, though the clan mother had to give three warnings first.Rodriguez, Jennifer A Clan Mother's Call: Reconstructing Haudenosaunee Cultural Memory Albany: SUNY Press, 2017 page 95. The power of the clan mothers to name and dismiss chiefs ensured that a female perspective was always maintained on political decisions. Anyone seeking to be adopted into an Haudenosaunee family had to approved by the clan mothers. When the Tuscarora joined the League, they had petition the clan mothers of the Five Mothers for permission to join, starting in 1711, and it was not until 11 years in 1722 that permission was finally granted. The Iroquois call themselves the Haudenosaunee (\\"the people of the longhouse\\") and reject the name Iroquois, which was the derogatory name given to them by the Algonquins meaning the \\"killer people\\". As the French were in contact with the Algonquins before they met the Haudenosaunee, the French adopted the Algonquin name for them, much to the chagrin of the Haudenosaunee, who consider the name Iroquois to be offensive. The clan mothers were in charge of the various clans that made up the Iroquois League and as the Iroquois were a matrilateral society this meant that children were born into their mother's clan (i.e. if a woman belonged to the bear clan, then all her children belonged to the bear clan).Paxton, James Joseph Brant and His World: 18th Century Mohawk Warrior and Statesman, Toronto: James Lorimer, 2008 page 7. It was considered to be incest by the Iroquois to marry within one's own matrilineal clan so traditionally marriages were between clans.Charlton, Thomas \\"On Iroquois Incest\\" pages 29-43 from Anthropologica, Volume 10, Issue 1, 1968 pages 30-34 Marrying someone from the same patrilineal clan was considered acceptable.Charlton, Thomas \\"On Iroquois Incest\\" pages 29-43 from Anthropologica, Volume 10, Issue 1, 1968 pages 30-34 The importance of the clan mothers was often missed by Europeans in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, who coming from patriarchal societies, tended to assume that the chiefs and sachems had the same powers as European kings, which was not the case.MacLeod, D. Peter The Canadian Iroquois and the Seven Years' War, Toronto: Dundurn Press, 2012 page xiv. The scholar Barbara Mann has charged that the impression that the councils of the clan mothers was \\"secondary\\" to the councils of the chiefs is a misunderstanding caused by Europeans who could not understand the gender equality in Iroquois society, and in fact the councils were equal. The councils of the clan mothers met the councils of the chiefs at least every month under a full moon, but meetings could be held more frequently if there was an emergency. The American scholar Elisabeth Tooker denied the popular claim that the Haudenosaunee League inspired the U.S. constitution of 1787, noting the U.S. constitution did not allow women to vote or hold office until 1920, and even today there is no guaranteed female representation in the executive, legislative or judicial arms of the U.S. government; in short, there is no counterpart to the clan mothers within the American system of governance. The clan mothers traditionally launched the \\"mourning wars\\" to take captives who would become Haudenosaunee by being adopted by a family to replace a family member who had died or alternatively be tortured to death, by announcing that a family was grieving because of a death of a family member and accused the young men in their villages of being cowards.Richter, Daniel \\"War and Culture: The Iroquois Experience\\" pages 528-559 from The William and Mary Quarterly, Volume 40, No. 4, October 1983 page 532 At which point, the young men could either go on the war path by taking part in a \\"mourning war\\" or be branded cowards, which would make then unmarriageable. Usually in order to prove their courage, the young men would take up the challenge issued by the clan mothers by going on a \\"mourning war\\". A sign of the power of the clan mothers occurred in 1713 when a delegation representing the Palatines of 6 men had to ask a meeting of the council of clan mothers for permission to settle in Kanienkeh (\\"the land of the flint\\"-the Iroquois name for their homeland in what is now upstate New York), as only the clan mothers had that power.Paxton, James Joseph Brant and his world, Toronto: James Lorimer & Company, 2008 page 12 The Palatine delegates and their interpreter had been expecting to meet the sachems, and were surprised to be meeting the clan mothers instead. The Canadian historian D. Peter MacLeod writing about the relationship between the Canadian Iroquois and the French in the time of the Seven Years' War wrote: \\"Most critically, the importance of clan mothers, who possessed considerable economic and political power within Canadian Iroquois communities, was blithely overlooked by patriarchal European scribes. Those references that do exist, show clan mothers meeting in council with their male counterparts to take decisions regarding war and peace and joining in delegations to confront the Onontio [the Iroquois term for the French governor-general] and the French leadership in Montreal, but only hint at the real influence wielded by these women\\". Significantly, the famous Mohawk chief Joseph Brant did not acquire political power despite his successes as a Loyalist commander in the American Revolutionary War until he married his third wife, Adonwentishon (also known as Catherine Croghan), who was a clan mother in 1780.Paxton, James Joseph Brant and His World: 18th Century Mohawk Warrior and Statesman, Toronto: James Lorimer, 2008 pages 45-46. It was only after Brant's marriage to the clan mother Adonwentishon that Brant become politically powerful within the Iroquois League, and his power rested on the fact that his wife was the clan mother of the turtle clan.Paxton, James Joseph Brant and His World: 18th Century Mohawk Warrior and Statesman, Toronto: James Lorimer, 2008 page 46. Before then, the political power in the Brant family had been Joseph Brant's sister, Molly Brant, who was a clan mother of the wolf clan.Paxton, James Joseph Brant and His World: 18th Century Mohawk Warrior and Statesman, Toronto: James Lorimer, 2008 page 43. Brant was the second common-in-law wife of Sir William Johnson, the superintendent of northern Indian affairs with the first being a Palatine named Catherine Weisenberg. Brant had been in a relationship with Johnson from her teenage years on, and after Weisenberg died in 1759, promptly moved into Johnson's house to become the lady of the house.Paxton, James Joseph Brant and His World: 18th Century Mohawk Warrior and Statesman, Toronto: James Lorimer, 2008 page 24. Unlike Weisenberg, Brant featured prominently in Johnson's letters as his strong-willed and much younger wife, who managed both Johnson Hall and assisted his work.Paxton, James Joseph Brant and His World: 18th Century Mohawk Warrior and Statesman, Toronto: James Lorimer, 2008 page 25. In common with clan mothers, Brant was never deferential to her husband and insisted on attending political meetings with British leaders as befitting her status, where she was outspoken in defense of her people's best interests. Molly Brant like her brother was a Loyalist, and was considered by the British to be one of their most powerful allies within the Iroquois League, able because of her position as a clan mother to rally the Iroquois warriors to fight for the Crown against the Americans despite the wishes of many Iroquois to be neutral in the war. Daniel Claus, an agent for the Indian Department wrote that \\"one word from her is more taken notice of by the Five Nations than a thousand from any white man without exception\\". Regarding the role of women in Iroquois society, Doug George-Kanentiio (2000) writes: > In our society, women are the center of all things. Nature, we believe, has > given women the ability to create; therefore it is only natural that women > be in positions of power to protect this function. ... We traced our clans > through women; a child born into the world assumed the clan membership of > its mother. Our young women were expected to be physically strong. ...

The 3rd Tank Army was created in 1942 and fought in the southern areas of the Soviet Union and Poland, then in Germany and Czechoslovakia until the defeat of Germany in 1945. Postwar, the army served as occupation troops in East Germany, went through several name changes, and was finally deactivated in 1969. History =Second World War= First Formation Tanks of the army in Germany, 1945 The 3rd Tank Army was formed as part of the Reserve of the Supreme High Command (RVGK, Stavka reserve) on the basis of the 58th Army in the Moscow Military District in May 1942. It was placed under the command of Lieutenant General Prokofy Romanenko. Its initial composition was 12th and 15th Tank Corps, one motor rifle division, and two rifle divisions. As part of the Soviet Western Front, the 3rd Tank Army successfully counter-attacked the German Second Panzer Army in August 1942. Soon afterwards, in September 1942, Romanenko handed over to Colonel General Pavel Rybalko, who held command of the Army for the remainder of the war. Committed to the fighting for Kharkov in March 1943 as part of the Voronezh Front, the 3rd Tank Army was subsequently encircled and virtually destroyed by German forces. The Army's remnants were reorganised as the 57th Army. Second Formation The army was reformed as the 3rd Guards Tank Army in May 1943, including the 9th Mechanised Corps & 12th & 15th Tank Corps. In 1943, the army took part in the Orel offensive and, assigned to the Voronezh and First Ukrainian Fronts, played a leading role in the liberation of Left Bank Ukraine. During the Orel offensive the 12th and 15th Tank Corps became the 6th and 7th Guards Tank Corps, respectively. The army was among the first Soviet troops to reach the Dnieper River in October 1943. In 1944, it fought in the Proskurov-Chernovits and Lvov-Sandomierz offensive operations. The army subsequently fought in southern Poland, Silesia, and in the Battle of Berlin. It overran the OKH command post at Zossen, headquarters for German Eastern Front operations, on April 21, 1945. Finally, the army drove on Prague, entering that city on May 9. =Cold War= Soon after the end of the war, the 6th and 7th Guards Tank Corps were converted into tank divisions with the same numbers, and the 9th Mechanized Corps into the 9th Mechanized Division. By 1946, the army had been re-designated as the 3rd Guards Mechanized Army and was headquartered in Luckenwalde, East Germany, as part of the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany. The 3rd Guards Mechanized Army was one of several Soviet armies used in the suppression of the 1953 uprising in East Germany, moving the 6th Guards Tank Division into Dessau and Wittenberg as well as the 9th Mechanized Division into L√ºbben, Cottbus, and Spremberg. On 29 April 1957, the 3rd Guards Mechanized Army became the 18th Guards Army. At the same time the 14th Guards Mechanized Division became the 14th Guards Motor Rifle Division. In 1958, the 82nd Motor Rifle Division, the former 9th Mechanized Corps, was withdrawn to Slavuta in the Carpathian Military District, where it disbanded. Up to 1964 it had preserved two formations which had served with it during World War II: the 6th and 7th Guards Tank Divisions (former similarly numbered Tank Corps). In August 1964, the headquarters of the 18th Guards Army was relocated to Alma-Ata, where it became the operational group of the Turkestan Military District. The 6th and 7th Guards Tank Divisions and the 14th Guards Motor Rifle Division were transferred to other units within the GSFG. The operational group was converted back into the 18th Army (without the Guards designation) on 4 March 1969, but was used to activate the headquarters of the Central Asian Military District on 24 June.  Commanders  The 3rd Tank Army was commanded by the following officers: * Lieutenant General Prokofy Romanenko (25 May‚Äì24 September 1942) * Major General (promoted to Lieutenant General 19 January 1943) Pavel Rybalko (25 September 1942‚Äì26 April 1943) The 3rd Guards Tank Army, 3rd Guards Mechanized Army, and 18th Guards Army were commanded by the following officers: * Lieutenant General (promoted to Colonel General 30 December 1943 and Marshal of Tank Troops 1 June 1945) Pavel Rybalko (14 May 1943‚ÄìFebruary 1947) * Lieutenant General Vasily Mitrofanov (February 1947‚ÄìMay 1950) * Lieutenant General Vasily Butkov (May 1950‚Äì30 September 1953) * Lieutenant General (promoted to Colonel General 8 August 1955) Viktor Obukhov (30 September 1953‚Äì15 April 1958) * Major General (promoted to Lieutenant General 25 May 1959) Sergey Sokolov (15 April 1958‚Äì21 January 1960) * Major General (promoted to Lieutenant General 7 May 1960) Georgy Anishchik (22 January 1960‚Äì28 August 1964) Notes References * *Bonn, Keith E.

He served for a period as the royal governor of the Province of Georgia from 1754‚Äì1757. At the end of a long life of service, he became admiral shortly before his death. Early life Born about 1713, he entered the Navy in 1728 as a \\"volunteer per order\\" with Captain John Gascoigne on board the frigate , in which he served for six years. He passed his examination on 31 July 1734, being then, according to his certificate, 21 years old. He was promoted to the rank of lieutenant on 14 October 1736. War of the Austrian Succession In 1739‚Äì40 Reynolds was serving in HMS Argyll on the home station. The War of the Austrian Succession broke out; and in June 1741 he was appointed to the fireship , then in the West Indies. She was paid off in November 1742, and Reynolds went on half-pay. In 1743 he was first lieutenant of , and from her, in February 1743‚Äì44, was moved to , which he left before she sailed for the Tagus River in July 1744 on what was to be her last voyage (see Sir John Balchen). On 23 April 1745 Reynolds was promoted to be commander of the fireship on the home station. In the following December he was placed on half- pay. In August 1746 he was temporarily appointed to at Plymouth; and similarly, in September, to at Portsmouth, from which on 30 October he was posted to HMS Arundel. He was, however, not relieved from Centurion till 22 November. During 1747 Arundel was employed in the English Channel, cruising with some success against the enemy's trade, and afterwards in convoy service in the North Sea. Mission against pirates In May 1748 Reynolds, still in Arundel, was sent out to Charles Town, from which he went to Jamaica. In December he received orders to return to Charles Town, and patrol South Carolina, Georgia, and the Bahamas, an area then a resort of pirates. He continued on this station for over two years, returning to England in 1751. Governor of Georgia Reynolds returned to England in 1751 in search of a new command. As did most appointed officials of the British Empire in the eighteenth century, Reynolds obtained his various commands through patronage. His sponsor, Philip Yorke, 1st Earl of Hardwicke and Lord Chancellor of England, encouraged Lord George Halifax, President of the Board of Trade, to appoint Reynolds as the new governor of royal Georgia in 1754. Reynolds arrived at Savannah on 29 October 1754. Local residents met him with celebrations of bells and bonfires to express their hopes that he heralded a new era for the colony, in contrast to the Trustees' administration, which had ended in June 1752. Georgians desired a more dependable government, territorial expansion, border protection, and a profitable economy. Reynolds, however, saw primarily a poor colony in which the high cost of living would drain, rather than supplement, his salary of ¬£600 a year. Following instructions from the Board of Trade, Reynolds established a structure of royal government, including courts, a council, and the Commons House of Assembly. Reynolds then directed the council to move into a new building when the original structure collapsed during his first meeting with that body. He acted decisively when the assembly faced a challenge from Augusta legislator Edmund Gray (or Grey), an immigrant from Virginia. Gray excited fears among the people about the extent of royal authority and tried to maneuver elections and assembly support to control a significant voting bloc within the Georgia legislature. Reynolds refused to be intimidated, and his forceful leadership encouraged the assembly to expel the Gray faction in January 1755. Reynolds's military efforts, however, proved less than successful. His arrival in Georgia coincided with the first rumblings of the Seven Years' War (1756‚Äì1763). His overall defense plans relied so heavily upon the British government to supply increasing numbers of troops, artillery, and forts that his London superiors refused to comply. Moreover, in November 1755 Reynolds abruptly returned to Savannah after waiting ten days for Creek chiefs to arrive at Augusta. He had called the meeting to renew friendly relations but left the negotiations and a contingency of disappointed Creek Indians in the hands of an associate, William Little. Georgians might have forgiven Reynolds this indiscretion if the governor had demonstrated tact and diplomacy in the rest of his administrative efforts. But Reynolds acted as if he held a naval command instead of a civil office. He expected instant responses to his directives and resisted any challenge to his authority. In addition, Reynolds publicly proclaimed his intentions to leave Georgia whenever a more profitable appointment came his way. Reynolds's style of command quickly angered the council. He refused to share his official instructions, which outlined the new royal government in Georgia, and communicated tidbits of that document only when he deemed necessary. Reynolds failed to realize that council members sought to understand their role in the new royal government and to ensure that the governor did not overstep his constitutional powers. In the absence of such information, council members took their authority to advise and give consent to the governor literally. They questioned and debated his every move. The council targeted the bulk of its displeasure against Little, a former naval surgeon and shipmate of Reynolds who served as the governor's secretary. The governor bestowed six additional offices upon Little, including clerk of the Commons House of Assembly and commissioner of Indian affairs. By September 1755 the council complained that Little interfered in governmental affairs, showed disrespect to the council, and exhibited dishonesty in office. Reynolds insisted that he possessed the power to interpret the rights and duties of provincial officials. To demonstrate his authority, he removed councilman Clement Martin from office and eliminated only two of Little's titles. Throughout his term in office Reynolds continued to quarrel with notable councilors, including James Habersham and Noble W. Jones. While Reynolds did guide the house to enact several bills that helped to administer the colony, by early 1756 members of the House of Assembly joined the growing dissatisfaction with the governor. Reynolds dissolved the legislature in February 1756, when it appeared that members might challenge his authority. To counter opposition, Reynolds relied heavily upon Little to use his office as clerk of the house, and then as its elected Speaker, to create a pro-Reynolds faction during the fall of 1756. Little's efforts ironically included men who had supported Edmund Gray the year before. As opposition grew against his administration, Reynolds took steps to control Georgia's General Court as well. By that time a letter from Jonathan Bryan, one of the province's largest landholders, and a scathing memorial concerning Reynolds and Little‚Äîhand- carried by the provost marshall, Alexander Kellet‚Äîhad made their way to the Board of Trade. That body voted to recall Reynolds and ordered the governor back to England to give testimony about his actions. The board sent a lieutenant governor, Henry Ellis, as a replacement. Reynolds relinquished the government to Ellis on February 16, 1757, and delayed his return to England for several weeks to collect information for his defense. Once Reynolds left Georgia, he endured a brief capture by the French. When the board finally heard Reynolds's case in the spring of 1758, he received no punishment, except orders to resign as governor. Reynolds's administration created great distress for Georgians, initiated a loss of revenue, and gave the colony a negative image for potential immigrants. Yet provincial leaders gained important lessons about methods of cooperation with the royal executive and their own ability to challenge an administration with which they disagreed. They used such knowledge to create a stronger reciprocal relationship with subsequent royal officials, which generally lasted until the Revolutionary War (1775‚Äì83). Seven Years' War In May 1759 he was directed to , of 60 guns, with which, in June, he joined the fleet off Brest under the command of Sir Edward Hawke. Hawke detached him as commodore of the squadron off Quiberon Bay. On this post he was afterwards relieved by Robert Duff, but was still detached from the fleet on 17 November, when, off the Isle Groix, he had news of the French fleet being at sea. He sent this off at once to the Admiralty, while he himself stood to the westward in the hope of meeting Hawke. This he did not succeed in doing, and he did not join the admiral till some days after the Battle of Quiberon Bay on 20 November. The following February he was moved into , from which in March he was superseded. He afterwards commanded the frigate , till the peace of 1763. Later life During the following years he lived at Newington Butts, and from 1766 to 1768 commanded , guardship at Plymouth. He then returned to Newington Butts, and in October 1768 sent to the Admiralty a proposal of a method of giving ships way through the water in a calm. In 1769 Reynolds commanded , guardship at Plymouth; and from 1770 to 1773 , in which in 1770 he took out troops to Gibraltar. In 1773 he commanded for some months, and in November was appointed to at Plymouth, from which he was relieved in the end of 1774. Reynolds was promoted to rear admiral on 31 March 1775, and to vice admiral on 29 January 1778. He then suffered from a paralytic stroke. He attained the rank of admiral on 24 September 1787, and died in London on 3 February 1788. Family Reynolds was married twice, but his first wife was his younger sister. In 1761 he married Maria Catharina Langin from a Swabian Protestant family who had emigrated to Georgia. Their daughter Maria Catharina Reynolds later married James Sowerby. Reynolds had a son George out of wedlock; he was also a naval officer, surviving the wreck of , and father of the engraver Alfred Reynolds.

Mike Ulanski who was playing in a local gutter punk band called The Proles became the original lead guitarist. When auditioning bass players, Ulanski suggested that Sam Duff, who was playing bass in The Proles, audition and he soon became a permanent member of Look Afraid. When Mike's time restraints with the Proles became too much for the band, the five of them agreed that Mike would step down and Cole Walsh-Davis, formerly of the Culling Song, was asked to join the group. The now finalized lineup entered the studio with producer Brian Whitten to record their debut EP, Zombie Dance Party, in June 2007. The EP, along with nonstop playing, garnered Look Afraid a number of dedicated fans, who the band took to calling \\"Fraidy Cats\\", who would help the band tremendously as they won an international talent competition hosted by Famecast in December 2007.FAMECAST - Contest Stage The band took home $10,000 and much press attention after beating hundreds of bands from around the world. Aaron Burgess of Spin Magazine was at their performance in Austin, Texas and called them \\"A Badass Rock Band\\" FAMECAST - Show The World Your Talent And Win (can be seen in print beneath the live performance video). Look Afraid also collaborated with legendary poster artist Jeff Gaither, who has designed images for the Misfits, Van Halen and Guns N' Roses, on two poster designs for a series of Halloween shows, one of which was featured on the cover of Miami University's Amusement Magazine. The band rode this surge of attention back into the studio in January 2008, again with Whitten at the helm, to produce the Rock N' Roll Glory Hole EP. A much darker and more rock oriented disc than their first, the EP showed a maturity in the more seasoned band, and their live shows continued to garner attention. The band recorded their third Whitten-produced EP, entitled Drive, which included the track \\"Hell City,\\" the official theme song of the Hell City tattoo convention, which was held in Columbus, Ohio on May 29‚Äì31, 2009.

Paradise and Hell is the left and right panels of a minor diptych by a follower of Hieronymus Bosch based on The Haywain Triptych. The image is oil on panel and is 135 x 45 cm. It was painted c. 1510 and is now in the Museo del Prado, Madrid. Paradise is depicted darker than in the Haywain, which possibly represents the darkness of original sin. Description The left panel depicts Creation and the Garden of Eden. It is loosely divided into sections, beginning at the top and ending at the bottom, while the right panel does not appear to follow any sequence of events. The left panel most likely corresponds with the Book of Genesis, and follows from the top, moving downward, and the right panel possibly corresponds with the Book of Revelation. At the top of the left panel, God sits enthroned in Heaven while the world is created. Angels toss the fallen angels out of the Heaven. While the fallen angels are thrown out of Heaven, they turn to insects. Moving downward, in the next 'section', a scene is shown where God has created Eve and is introducing her to Adam. In the third 'section', the serpent offers Adam and Eve a fruit from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, and Adam is reaching out to take it. At the bottom of the panel, an angel expels Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden, thus marking the Fall of Man, and the two become ashamed of their nakedness. The right panel depicts the consequences of Adam and Eve's choice, in which a vision of hell is shown. A burning building can be seen in the background, and in the foreground, there appear to be several demons constructing a fortress or castle. To the lower left, a man is being directed towards a castle by two mutated animals. Just in front of the portcullis is a man riding a cow, being pierced by a sword or spear. At the bottom right, a man is running while being attacked by demonic creatures, while to the lower left a man is being devoured by a large human-legged fish.

The Seychelles butterflyfish is found in areas of rich coral growth on seaward reefs, at 10‚Äì40 m depth. (2008): Chaetodon madagaskariensis. Version of 2008-JAN-14. Retrieved 2008-SEP-01. It grows to a maximum of 13 cm (more than 5 in) long. The body color is silver at the head, becoming white towards the tail, with a triangular orange patch covering the posterior and the caudal peduncle. There are a series of dark grey chevron lines on the sides of the body, partly broken into spots. Between the eyes and the start of the dorsal fin there is a black patch rimmed with white. The base of the caudal fin is white, followed by an orange patch and a white rim. Systematics C. madagaskariensis is one of the \\"crowned\\" butterflyfishes. These form a group of largely allopatric species sharing the overall color pattern of dark forward-pointing chevrons on silvery hues, (usually) a black-and-white crown spot and yellow to red hindparts to a stunning degree; they differ in the exact combination of hues and some small pattern details. Other members of this lineage are the closely related Eritrean (C. paucifasciatus) and atoll butterflyfishes (C. mertensii), and the more distant pearlscale butterflyfish (C. xanthurus).

Raffles Bulletin of Zoology Supplement 14: 77-86. PDF fulltext The \\"crowned\\" Chaetodon are a clearly recognizable clade, but their further relationships are otherwise less clear. They were often placed in the subgenus Exornator, or considered a distinct subgenus Rhombochaetodon. According to various DNA sequence studies, some older and more singular lineages. These include species such as the Asian butterflyfish (C. argentatus), the blue-striped butterflyfish (C. fremblii) and Burgess' butterflyfish (C. burgessi). C. burgessi is in fact so peculiar that it was placed in a monotypic subgenus Roaops. But recognition of this would probably result in several other small or monotypic subgenera becoming justified, and the older Rhombochaetodon would be the more conveniently apply to the entire radiation. But the expanded group is of unclear relationships to species like the speckled butterflyfish (C. citrinellus) and the four-spotted butterflyfish (C. quadrimaculatus). These might be members of the subgenus Exornator - the lineages around the spot-banded butterflyfish (C. punctatofasciatus) - and C. citrinellus certainly looks somewhat similar to these. Yet phylogenetically, their position towards Rhombochaetodon is unresolved, and ultimately it might be better to merge both Rhombochaetodon and Roaops in Exornator. If the genus Chaetodon is split up, Exornator might become a subgenus of Lepidochaetodon or a separate genus.

Its antecedents were the very short-lived Advisory Board on Historical Work to the Army War College's Historical Section in 1928-1930 and, more directly, a group of three civilians and three officers, who met from May 1943 to 1946 to draft plans for the Army's history of the Second World War that led to the creation of what would become the United States Army Center of Military History. The Secretary of the Army appoints members, which includes civilian scholars as well as those who represent the United States Military Academy, the Army War College, the Command and General Staff College, and the Training and Doctrine Command.

After he graduated from the √âcole de Commerce Solvay, he joined the National Bank of Belgium in 1935. Before the outbreak of World War II, he accompanied the evacuation of the NBB‚Äôs last consignment of assets to England, thereby safeguarding the assets of the NBB from the Nazis. In 1941 Hubert Ansiaux left for the United States of America, and in the same year he was appointed as director in London, where he was to succeed Camille Gutt. In London, he was in charge of the practical management of the Bank in London, together with Adolphe Baudewyns. After the war, he was in charge of the NBB's Foreign Affairs department and he was closely involved in the post-war currency reform (Operation Gutt). Hubert Ansiaux supported the European integration, and from 1947 up to 1955 he was president of the Intra-European Payments Committee which had been created within the Organisation for European Economic Cooperation and served on the board of directors of the European Payments Union from 1950 up to 1955. From 1944 to 1954 he worked as deputy administrator at the Bank for International Settlements, and in 1946 he became administrator of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Hubert Ansiaux was involved in setting up the International Monetary Fund where he would later advocate the creation of the special drawing rights. Ansiaux was appointed as vice-governor of the NBB in 1954, and as its governor in 1957. He held the position of central banker during the sixties, until the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in 1971. As governor of the NBB Ansiaux continued to play a leading role in European monetary cooperation. In 1967 he was appointed as president of the Committee of Governors of the Central Banks of the Member States of the EEC. In 1970 he contributed to the Werner Report with the first plans for Economic and Monetary Union. Ansiaux resigned, after a conflict with the government, as governor of the NBB in 1971.

Library of Congress. Publ. 1897, c1898. Accessed April 2020. It was one of the three companies which merged to become the Pere Marquette Railway. Early history The F&PM; was chartered on January 22, 1857 as the Flint and Pere Marquette Railway for the purpose of constructing an east-west railway line on a route, for which a federal land grant was offered, from Flint, Michigan to Lake Michigan at Pere Marquette (now Ludington, Michigan). The early promoters of the road were George M. Dewey and E.H. Hazelton of Flint, with Dewey serving as the first president of the F&PM.;Michigan Pioneer and Historical Collections XXI (1894), p. 414. Construction started in 1859 in East Saginaw. A more energetic management took charge in 1860 when Captain Eber Brock Ward of Detroit, a prominent lumberman, vessel owner, and steel manufacturer, was elected to the presidency of the F&PM.;Michigan Pioneer and Historical Collections XXI (1894), p. 341.Michigan Pioneer and Historical Collections, XXII (1894), p. 289. Service began on January 20, 1862, on the section from East Saginaw south to Mount Morris. In December 1864 the F&PM; gained access to Detroit via trackage rights over the Flint and Holly Railroad and the Detroit and Milwaukee Railroad. Construction westward from Saginaw commenced in 1866 with the first section of , to Midland, opened December 1, 1867. In the Annual Report to the Stockholders of December 31, 1867, the secretary of the F&PM;, Henry C. Potter, called for the continued building of the line toward Lake Michigan: \\"The importance and magnitude of the lumber traffic on the Muskegon and Manistee Rivers urge this company to speedy construction on its road west.\\" On September 2, 1868, the F&PM; was consolidated with the Flint and Holly Railroad. Besides adding a key segment of trackage to the growing F&PM; system, the merger brought into the F&PM; the Crapo family - Henry H. Crapo, Governor of Michigan in 1865-69, and his son, William W. Crapo, later president of the F&PM.; An extension of from Midland to Averill was completed on October 25, 1868, giving the F&PM; of route west from Flint and entitling the company to in land grants; since 1862 the company had received a total of . Slowly the railroad snaked its way through the forests of central Michigan. It was completed to Clare, west of Averill, in November 1870; another was finished in March 1871. With the completion of to Reed City in December 1871, the F&PM; made a connection with the north-south main line of the Grand Rapids and Indiana Railway. The line was now from its goal of Ludington. On June 4, 1872, the F&PM; was consolidated with the Holly, Wayne and Monroe Railroad (opened for service the same day); the Bay City and East Saginaw Railroad (a feeder line leased since 1867); the Flint River Railroad (Flint to Otter Lake); and the Cass River Railroad (East Saginaw to Vassar). The Ludington terminal In 1868 President Ward of the F&PM; opened negotiations with James Ludington for a terminal site at his namesake town with frontage of Pere Marquette Lake. James Ludington was the owner of the only mill then at Ludington. He attempted to spin out the talks; though he favored completion of the F&PM;, Ludington knew Ward intended to build mills to tap the timber along the Pere Marquette River. Fearing this would make Ward too big, Ludington refused to sell a terminal site or mill sites at any price, hoping to squeeze Ward into selling some of his of timber at a bargain price. Ludington found that Ward would not sell and, more importantly, that Ward was not a man to be trifled with. Ward learned early in 1869 that Ludington's logging crews had, accidentally or otherwise, cut pine from part of his land. He kept quiet until Ludington went to Detroit on business, then had him arrested and lodged in the Wayne County Jail on charges of trespassing and timber theft. He secured a court judgment of $650,000 against Ludington, who was ruined; he suffered a stroke and was forced to quit business. His successor in business, the Pere Marquette Lumber Company, reached an amicable agreement with Ward in August 1869 for both the railway terminal and the mill sites. \\"In November 1874,\\" recalled editor Charles G. Wing of the Ludington Daily News in 1920, \\"when the F&PM; railroad was nearly completed to Ludington, Governor John J. Bagley came over the line on a tour of inspection ... [and] received the most distinguished mark of attention Ludington could show. He rode to and from his railroad car in the only covered carriage up to that time ever owned within the borders of Mason County.\\" The road was completed to Ludington on December 1, 1874, giving the F&PM; of main line. By 1877 the company had received of federal land grants, of which over half - - had been sold, contributing $2,369,729.21 to the railroad's revenues. Ward died suddenly while walking in Detroit on January 2, 1875. Elected to succeed him as president of the F&PM; was Jesse Hoyt of New York, who had extensive lumber and salt interests in East Saginaw. Cross-lake steamship service between Ludington and Sheboygan, Wisconsin was inaugurated May 31, 1875, with a leased steamer, the sidewheeler SS John Sherman, with John W. Stewart as its captain. At Sheboygan the line interchanged freight with the Sheboygan and Fond du Lac Railway. Quickly outgrowing both the SS John Sherman and the terminal at Sheboygan, the line was shifted to Milwaukee in 1876. The Goodrich Transportation Company provided service under contract to the railroad from 1876 to 1883. Ships assigned to the route by Goodrich included the De Pere, Corona, Oconto, Alpena and, best-known of all, the City of Ludington. The F&PM; terminated its contract with Goodrich on April 1, 1883. A grain elevator was built in 1877 on the Ludington waterfront by a group of investors associated with the railroad. In 1879 a freight warehouse was built just south of the grain elevator. Receivership Preferred stock of the Flint and Pere Marquette Railroad Company, issued 1. July 1882 On July 1, 1879, the F&PM; went into receivership, owing $1,200,000 in unpaid interest on bonds with bonded interest accumulating at a rate of $385,000 a year. Gross revenues had declined every year since the Panic of 1873, a situation exacerbated by the crash of the lumber market in July 1877. The company remained in receivership until September 30, 1880, when it was reorganized as the Flint and Pere Marquette Railroad. Under the reorganization plan the F&PM; issued $6,500,000 in preferred stock. No common stock was to be issued to holders of certificates of old common stock until five consecutive dividends of 7 per cent had been paid on preferred stock. In the event, this never occurred, as there were only two consecutive years (1883 and 1884) in which a 7 per cent dividend was declared on preferred stock. While in receivership the company built two new lines in 1879: a narrow gauge branch from Cole to Mount Pleasant, , as the Saginaw and Mount Pleasant Railroad (converted to in 1884), and a standard gauge branch from Clare to Harrison, , as the Saginaw and Clare County Railroad. The Manistee Railroad For some years, Manistee had boasted of being the largest American city not served by a railroad. This changed after the incorporation on June 19, 1880, of an F&PM; subsidiary, the Manistee Railroad, to build a branch line from Manistee Junction (today Walhalla), east of Ludington, to Manistee. The villages of Bachelor, Fountain and Free Soil quickly sprang up on this line. Upon its opening on December 5, 1881, the branch gave the F&PM; access to Manistee lumbering and salt manufacturing resources. The Black Boats In September 1882 the F&PM; began operating their own propeller steamers between Ludington and Milwaukee. The first two were the F&PM; No. 1 and F&PM; No. 2, wooden propellers of 553 and 537 gross tons respectively. Built at Detroit in 1882, they were outfitted to carry passengers, package freight and bulk grain. At a time when most Lake Michigan passenger steamers were painted white, they quickly became known as the \\"Black Boats\\" for their black hulls. Each was lengthened in 1883, and steamship service was extended to Manistee in 1884. As business grew, two similar but larger propellers were built at Detroit, the 924-ton F&PM; No. 3 in 1887 and the 941-ton F&PM; No. 4 in 1888. The 1,723-ton F&PM; No. 5, built at West Bay City in 1890, differed in originally being configured as a straight package freighter with no passenger accommodations. Sailings between Ludington and Manitowoc, Wisconsin, were inaugurated in 1890 by the F&PM; No. 1. Decline of lumbering Since Jesse Hoyt lived in New York City and did not visit Michigan after 1877, he was represented on the F&PM; board by his attorney, William L. Webber of East Saginaw, who also served as the company's general counsel and land commissioner. Upon the death of Hoyt on August 14, 1882, William W. Crapo of New Bedford, Massachusetts, a director since 1868, was elected president of the F&PM.; Under his presidency the F&PM; was run very much like a New England railroad rather than a Western logging line, as heretofore. After 1887 the transportation of logs by the F&PM; began to fall off rapidly. This was offset somewhat by the growing freight traffic of the company's steamship line. In 1888 the decline in logs transported amounted to 193,790 tons ($153,308 in gross earnings), while earning of the Black Boats totaled $40,556 and rapidly increased as the F&PM; attracted movements of wood products, flour, and grain. On January 31, 1889, the F&PM; was consolidated with the East Saginaw and St. Clair Railroad, the Saginaw and Clare County Railroad, the Saginaw and Mount Pleasant Railroad, and the Manistee Railroad. The F&PM; bought the Port Huron and Northwestern Railway on April 1, 1889, converted it to standard gauge, and constructed a new line east from Yale to Port Huron. It also converted to standard gauge its existing branch line between East Saginaw and Yale. This gave the F&PM; a standard gauge line across the breadth of Michigan, from Lake Michigan to Lake Huron. The F&PM; was a part-owner of the Fort Street Union Depot Company in association with the Wabash Railway, Canadian Pacific Railway, and Detroit, Lansing and Northern Railroad. Construction of this Detroit station commenced in 1890 and it was opened for service on January 22, 1893. Until 1897 the F&PM; reached the important railroad center of Toledo, Ohio, over the rails of the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway. An extension of the F&PM;, from Monroe to Alexis (an unincorporated place just across the state line in Ohio and just outside the city limits of Toledo), was constructed by the Monroe and Toledo Railway. Soon after the line's completion, the M&T; was purchased outright by the F&PM; on August 27, 1897. Entry into Toledo from Alexis, , was secured in 1897 through a 99-year lease of trackage from the Ann Arbor Railroad. Movements of grain in bulk had become so important to the economics of the railroad that when the elevator at Ludington was destroyed by fire on July 7, 1899, it was immediately rebuilt. The new, larger grain elevator was ready for operation by November 20, 1899.Ludington Record, November 23, 1899. Car ferry service In 1895 the F&PM; reached an agreement with the Wisconsin Central Railway to establish a cross-lake railway car ferry line between Ludington and Manitowoc. A steel car ferry designed by Robert Logan of 2,443 tons, the Pere Marquette, was built at West Bay City, where she was launched on December 30, 1896. With Joseph Russell as master, the Pere Marquette arrived at Manitowoc on her maiden voyage from Ludington on the morning of February 17, 1897, interchanging freight with both the Wisconsin Central and the Chicago and North Western Railway. The car ferry operation was so successful that it soon became obvious that service would have to be expanded; in 1900 the Pere Marquette transported 27,000 railroad cars across Lake Michigan. Consolidation As early as 1886 the Chicago and West Michigan Railway shared common directors with the Detroit, Lansing and Northern Railroad, which was reorganized a decade later, in 1896, as the Detroit, Grand Rapids and Western Railroad. On December 27, 1897, the DGR&W; inaugurated car ferry service between Muskegon and Milwaukee with the wooden car ferry Muskegon (later renamed Pere Marquette 16). By January 1, 1899, the F&PM; had sold of the granted the company by the federal government. Sales amounted to $4,847,007 - an average of $10.34 an acres. An agreement was reached in 1899 for the consolidation of the F&PM; with the Chicago and West Michigan and the Detroit, Grand Rapids and Western with securities of the newly organized exchanged for those of the constituent companies. The F&PM; declared a special 2% dividend out of assets as part of the consolidation plan. The Pere Marquette Railroad was incorporated November 1, 1899, and took over the properties on January 1, 1900. Charles M. Heald of the C&WM; and DGR&W; was president of the Pere Marquette with William W. Crapo of the F&PM; as chairman of the board of directors. On February 1, 1900, the new company acquired the Saginaw, Tuscola and Huron Railroad, which had been built in 1881-86 by investors associated with the F&PM.; Presidents of the F&PM; *George M.

N011 The first Bars series radar was the N011, which was originally an X band Pulse-Doppler radar developed for the Su-27. In this original N011 form, it deployed a mechanically scanned planar array with 960 mm diameter, ¬±85 degrees scan sector. The peak output power reached 8 kW with an average of 2 kW. The N011 features a low noise UHF input amplifier, and fully digitized signal processing unit using reprogrammable digital computers. The original requirement to simultaneously track 20 targets and engage 8 of the 20 tracked proved impossible to achieve at the time due to the available Soviet technology, but the N011 is still able to simultaneously track 13 targets and engage 4. This was subsequently upgraded to tracking 15 targets and engaging 6 of the 15 tracked. The maximum air-to-air detection range is over 400 km when used in an airborne early warning role, and when used for intercepting role, the range against a typical fighter sized target is 140 km head-on, and 65 km tail-on. For air-to-surface mode, the N011 has five air-to- ground modes and four maritime modes, including ground mapping, terrain- following radar and terrain-avoidance modes. The maximum air-to-surface mode is over 200 km against an aircraft carrier type of target. N011M The second member of the Bars radar family is the N011M, a radar that uses an electronically scanned (phased array) slotted planar antenna but with the experience gained from the development of the N007 Zaslon. In an effort to improve performance the antenna design was changed to a multi-channel passive electronically scanned array (PESA). The design of the N011M Bars antenna like the earlier N007 antenna consists of two separate electronically controlled arrays, an X band radar and an L band IFF transponder with a total weight of 100 kg and a diameter of 960 mm. The radar has a peak power output of 4-5 kW and is capable of positioning beams in 400 microseconds, a huge advantage over mechanically scanned radar. The Bars radar can be fixed in position to give a scanning sector of ¬±70 degrees in azimuth and ¬±45 degrees in elevation. To improve scan coverage, the radar can also be mounted on electromechanical drives, and in this case, the scanning sector is expanded to ¬±90 degrees. The 28 MHz Ts200 programmable signal processor used in N011M incorporates Fourier transforms of \\"butterfly\\" type capable of 75 Million operations per second. The N011M supports digital signal processing using 3 processors with 16 MB of both static and flash memory. The peak output is 4 to 5 kW with an average output of 1.2 kW, and the total radar system weighs around 650 kg. N011M is used on Su-30MKI Su-30MKM, and the contract for the N011M radar has three stages. The initial MK1 software was tested in 2002 and supplied with the first Su-30MKI deliveries. India was supposed to build both programmable signal processors and data processors under project \\"Vetrivale\\" to replace the original Russian components, but failed to do so within the required time frame, so MK2 still used the Russian equipment. In 2004, India delivered Vetrivale radar computer based in the i960 architecture. It's worth noting that N011M is not simply a PESA, but instead, it's a transition between PESA and AESA in that it adopts technologies from both: each transceiver on the antenna array of N011M has its own receiver amplifier, which is the same as AESA, and with noise level of 3dB, which is also in the same class of AESA arrays. However, for transmitting, N011M uses PESA technology in that a single Chelnok traveling-wave tube is used for EGSP-6A transmitter. There are three receiving channels for N011M. N011M has a search range of 400 km and a tracking range of 200 km, with 60 km in the rear in the air-to-air mode.

Up to 15 air targets can be tracked at once in track while scan mode with 4 of these engaged at once.Jane's Radar And Electronic Walfare Systems, pp.2089 The N011M can use a number of short range and speed search modes and is capable of identifying the type and number of multiple targets. The Bars radar is compatible with R-77 and R-27 radar guided missiles providing both illumination and data-link guidance as well as the R-73 IR guided missile. In the air-to-surface mode the radar is capable of detecting ground and naval based moving targets, determining their location and maintaining a track on two surface targets at once. The N011 is capable of detecting the group of tanks target to a maximum range of 40‚Äì50 km and a destroyer sized target to a range of 80‚Äì120 km. Bars also features a mapping mode using either real beam, doppler beam sharpening or Synthetic aperture radar with a maximum resolution of 10 meters. The Kh-31 anti-radiation missile is also compatible with the radar. N035 N035 Irbis-E (Snow Leopard) radar is the most powerful radar of Bars radar family, and it is a direct descendant of N011M, and it adopts many components of N011M to save cost and shorten the developmental time. The difference between N035 and its predecessor N011M is that the receiving channel is increased to 4 in N035 from the original 3 in N011M. A new transmitter EGSP-27 incorporated an upgraded version of Chelnok traveling wave tube that is capable of delivering 10 kW peak power output, resulting in the peak output of N035 increased to 20 kW, with an average output peak of 5 kW and continuous wave illumination of 2 kW. A new 5010-35.01 digital processor and a new 5010-35.02 info processor are used, and N035 has twice the bandwidth of N011M. The noise level is increased to 3.5 dB from the 3 dB of N011M, and against typical aerial target with 3 square meters, the effective range is in excess of 400 km (head-on). Against stealth target with 0.01 square meters, the head-on effective range is in excess of 90 km. N035 radar can simultaneously tracking 30 targets and engage 2 of the 30 with semi- active radar homing air-to-air missiles, and when using active radar homing missiles, the number of targets it can simultaneously engage is increased to 8. Bars-29 The Tikhomirov Scientific Research Institute of Instrument Design has displayed a modified N011M radar for the MiG-29 designated the Bars-29. The Bars-29 shares up to 90% of its software and hardware with the original Bars radar while being small enough to be installed within the nose of the MiG-29 fighter. The Bars-29 has a detection range of 120 km against a target with an RCS of 5 m2, 15 targets can be tracked at once when using track while scan mode, with 4 engaged at any one time. The radar has an average power output of 1 kW.

There used to be three types of National Qualification - Standard Grades, National Courses and National Units. For the most up-to-date information about Scottish qualifications, please visit the pages of the Scottish Qualification Authority. Standard Grades Standard Grades are a now discontinued qualification. They were mainly studied over two years during the third and fourth years of secondary schooling. There were three level in Standard Grade‚ÄîCredit, General and Foundation‚Äîwith Credit passes normally being expected for pupils to have a reasonable prospect at success studying that subject at Higher level the following year. National Courses and Units National Courses were first introduced in the 2013/2014 examination diet. They include Nationals 1-5, (New) Higher and (New) Advanced Higher. National 4 replaced Standard Grade General and National 5 replaced Standard Grade Credit. For more the most up-to-date information on Scottish qualifications, please visit the SQA website. They were originally introduced as the step following on from Standard Grade and were offered at Higher level, but also at lower levels than Higher to allow further opportunities for pupils to progress. Immediately below Higher level was Intermediate 2 which was broadly the level of Credit at Standard Grade; below that Intermediate 1 which was broadly the level of General at Standard Grade. Access 3 was broadly the level of Foundation at Standard Grade, and below that Access 2 and Access 1 for those pupils who required additional learning support. Above Higher level is Advanced Higher which would normally be studied by pupils who have passed a group of Highers but have decided to study at Secondary school for a sixth year before going on to University. To pass a National Course (such as for example, Higher Mathematics), students had to pass a number of National Units that were internally assessed, as well as pass a final externally assessed examination. Unit assessments are unseen and should a student fail an assessment opportunity, only one re-sit opportunity is provided using a fresh unseen assessment. (A second re-sit opportunity is only allowed in exceptional circumstances.) Failure to pass a National Unit at Higher level would mean that a student would be unable to pass the National Course at Higher level that year, though they may successfully complete a number of National Units.

Biography Peralta was born in Ca√±ada de G√≥mez, Santa Fe Province. His parents, N√©lida Cremona and Hugo Peralta, relocated to Santa Cruz Province and both became prominent Peronist figures there. Their son became a bank teller, and joined the Bank Employees' Union in 1973. He was named secretary general of the Bank Employees' Union of Santa Cruz in 1983, and later head of the provincial chapter of the CGT. Peralta was appointed Minister of Social Policy by Governor Ricardo del Val in 1988. He returned to the private sector in 1991 as manager of the Punta Arenas, Chile, branch of the then state-owned Bank of Santa Cruz, and in 1995 became manager of its central branch in R√≠o Gallegos. Peralta led the transitional committee during the bank's 1996 privatization.Diario Perfil Governor N√©stor Kirchner, who had been a prot√©g√© of Peralta's parents, appointed him Secretary of Labor in 1999, and in 2003, he was elected to the Provincial Legislature on the Justicialist Party ticket. Kirchner, who became President of Argentina, appointed Peralta director of the state coal concern, Yacimientos Carbon√≠feros Fiscales (YCF), in 2004. Taking a leave of absence from the party's regional congress, Peralta accepted the post following a mine accident which killed 14. Upon incumbent governor Carlos Sancho's announcement of his resignation on May 11, 2007, in which he cited poor health (Sancho had himself taken office when the previous governor resigned amid scandal and fights with Kirchner), Peralta returned to his post as Provincial Deputy and was elected 1st Vice President of the House of Deputies, effectively making him the legislature's senior member. This allowed him to be named acting governor upon Sancho's resignation.Clar√≠n In the general elections in October 2007, Peralta was officially elected Governor, beating UCR candidate Eduardo Costa by almost 20 points on the Kirchnerist Front for Victory slate;Diario Perfil he was sworn into office in December 2007. Peralta took office as Governor of Santa Cruz at a troubled time for the Province, amid strikes, sporadic riots, and allegations of police brutality; amid high levels of federal spending on local infrastructure projects the situation in the province later stabilized. Inheriting a growing pension system deficit, the governor ordered withholding rates increased and benefited trimmed for early retirees.Clar√≠n Governor Peralta continued to enjoy the support of President Cristina Kirchner, the successor and widow of N√©stor Kirchner. She defended the governor against calls from the opposition for impeachment following his refusal to reinstate Eduardo Sosa, a prosecutor who had been dismissed by then-Governor Kirchner in 1995, and who won a federal court ruling to that effect.Buenos Aires Herald Peralta presided over a federally and provincially funded public works boom in Santa Cruz. Much as his predecessors did, however, Peralta faced restive labor unions in the province, and contended with a series of general strikes in the educational and petroleum sectors during 2011; strikes in the latter industry reportedly cost the province US$50 million in lost revenues, as well as over US$200 million in federal revenue. Elections in 2011 returned both Governor Peralta and President Fern√°ndez de Kirchner to their respective offices. Their alliance was strained in 2012, however, by allegations the governor had the president spied upon during at least one of her frequent visits to her El Calafate family residence. Peralta concluded that the president was behind the Provincial Legislature's opposition to his budget proposal (which included a US$200 million deficit), and by September had broken with President Fern√°ndez de Kirchner outright.

It is an univallate hillfort, or defended enclosure and is now permanent pasture, but patches of gorse, bramble and thorn scrub obscure the defenses in several places. Three sides of the defensive bank and ditch are visible today but the ditches have been used as a dumping ground and are partly filled in. It is thought that a fourth side of the fort, has been lost to coastal erosion. The defenses are unimpressive, but are severely damaged. They were constructed by piling soil and flint extracted from the ditch. The interior of the fort is almost perfectly flat from ploughing in the past, leading to erosion of the inner rampart faces.

It has a population of 288 (2004). The name is of Slavic and topographic origins and literally means a small meadow.  History  It lies in the historical region of Cieszyn Silesia. It could have been first mentioned in the letter issued by Wenceslaus I, Duke of Cieszyn on 12 March 1434 in which he bestowed a place called Lochni/Locheny (≈ÅƒÖczka?) adjacent to Kiesselaw (Kisiel√≥w) upon Ticzko von Logau (who would be therefore its noble owner). It was later mentioned in 1466 (od Luczkey hranicy), 1573 (w Lucze) and so on. Politically it belonged then to the Duchy of Teschen, a fee of the Kingdom of Bohemia, which after 1526 became a part of the Habsburg Monarchy. After the Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire a modern municipal division was introduced in the re-established Austrian Silesia. The village as a municipality was subscribed to the political district of Bielsko and the legal district of Skocz√≥w. According to the censuses conducted in 1880, 1890, 1900 and 1910 the population of the municipality grew from 135 in 1880 to 143 in 1910, all of them were native Polish-speakers mostly Roman Catholics (56% in 1910), followed by Protestants (44% in 1910). The village was also traditionally inhabited by Cieszyn Vlachs, speaking Cieszyn Silesian dialect. After World War I, the fall of Austria-Hungary, the Polish‚ÄìCzechoslovak War and the division of Cieszyn Silesia in 1920, it became a part of Poland. It was then annexed by Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II. After the war it was restored to Poland.

Early life Born in Reims, France, du Coudray entered the French military and trained as an artillery specialist. Well connected to the French court (he once tutored the future Charles X on military affairs), du Coudray was a leading proponent of the Gribeauval system of artillery in the Seven Years' War. American Revolution When Great Britain and its North American colonies began the American Revolutionary War in 1775, du Coudray had risen to the rank of chef de brigade, with a posting as an adjutant general. He was a leading figure in the French artillery, having written treatises on subjects such as gunpowder and metallurgy as it applied to the artillery. In 1776 the American diplomat Silas Deane came to France to recruit skilled military talent, particularly engineers, for the colonial cause.Walker, p. 6 Impressed by du Coudray, whom he described as the \\"first engineer\\" of the French military establishment, Deane agreed to hire du Coudray into the Continental Army with the rank of major general and command of the Continental Army's artillery and engineering corps.Walker, p. 8 Du Coudray was to recruit engineers in France, and deliver 200 French cannons to the American forces. The methods by which du Coudray went about recruiting alarmed the French court, which wanted to maintain secrecy in its dealings with the Americans, and du Coudray was ordered to stay in France. He ignored the order, and slipped out of France, arriving in North America in May 1777. Deane in fact exceeded his authority in extending the offer to du Coudray, but the Continental Congress felt obliged to honor it, and he was commissioned with the offered rank. A number of American generals were outraged that high ranks were awarded to foreigners, and the Continental Army's artillery chief, Henry Knox, was particularly incensed that du Coudray would outrank him. To placate Knox (who threatened to resign over the matter), and to resolve conflicts of command and personality issues between du Coudray and another French engineer, Louis Leb√®gue Duportail, du Coudray was not assigned to a command position, and was instead appointed as \\"Inspector General of Ordnance and Military Manufactories\\" in August 1777. Du Coudray was somewhat unpopular because of the circumstances surrounding his commissioning, although they were not directly of his making, but his superior attitude and aristocratic demeanor did nothing to improve relations with others. He was at first assigned to survey the defences around Philadelphia and recommend improvements. His initial report on the matter suggested developing Red Bank (the site of Fort Mercer), and recommended significant changes to Fort Billingsport, while completely dismissing Fort Mifflin. General George Washington took an active role in the distribution of the defences, and chose Fort Mifflin as the primary point of defence in opposition to du Coudray's suggestion. Du Coudray in a politically astute maneuver backed down from his assessment, and was given the assignment of working at Fort Mifflin. He continued to lobby Congress on the matter, however, with the result that improvements to all of the forts was slow. Death On September 11, 1777, he was riding across a pontoon bridge across the Schuylkill River when his horse suddenly became alarmed, leaping into the river. Du Coudray, caught in spurs and entanglements, drowned. His funeral, held at St. Mary's Church in Philadelphia, was attended by many Congressional representatives. He was buried in the church yard, but the exact grave location is unknown. Notes *Alder, Ken. Engineering the Revolution: Arms and Enlightenment in France, 1763-1815.

History  The village lies the historical region of Cieszyn Silesia. It was first mentioned in a document of Bishop of Wroc≈Çaw issued on 23 May 1223 for Norbertine Sisters in Rybnik among villages paying them a tithe, as Ogrozona. Politically it belonged then to the Duchy of Opole and Racib√≥rz and the Castellany of Cieszyn, which was in 1290 formed in the process of feudal fragmentation of Poland into the Duchy of Teschen, ruled by a local branch of Silesian Piast dynasty. In 1327 the duchy became a fee of the Kingdom of Bohemia, which after 1526 became a part of the Habsburg Monarchy. The village became a seat of a Catholic parish, and was mentioned in the register of Peter's Pence payment from 1447 among the 50 parishes of Teschen deanery as Ogrodzona.

It grows to a maximum of 12.5 cm (5 in) long. Body color is white with 5-7 chevron-shaped dark grey bands on the sides. The posterior portion of the trunk, the adjacent dorsal and anal fins, and the posterior portion of the caudal fin are orange or yellow. A vertical black bar runs across the eye and over the nape without a break; in the similar species there is a separate nape spot and eyestripe.FishBase (2008) The atoll butterflyfish is found in deep lagoons and seaward reefs at 10‚Äì120 m depth. It feeds on algae and small benthic invertebrates.  Distribution  Chaetodon mertensii is found in the Pacific Ocean from the Ryukyu Islands to the Philippines and extending to Lord Howe Island, Rapa Iti and the Tuamotus. It was first recorded from the Kermadec Islands Marine Reserve north of New Zealand in 2015, after researchers examined hundreds of hours of unused documentary film footage. Systematics Chaetodon mertensii is one of the \\"crowned\\" butterflyfishes. These form a group of largely allopatric species sharing the overall color pattern of dark forward-pointing chevrons on silvery hues, a (usually) black- and-white crown spot and yellow to red hindparts to a stunning degree; they differ in the exact combination of hues and some small pattern details. Other members of this lineage are the closely related Eritrean (C. paucifasciatus) and Seychelles Butterflyfishes (C. madagaskariensis), and the more distant Pearlscale Butterflyfish (C. xanthurus).Fessler & Westneat (2007), Hsu et al. (2007) Seychelles butterflyfish (C. madagaskariensis). The atoll butterflyfish looks almost identical, save for yellower hindparts and a continuous head band. The \\"crowned\\" Chaetodon are a clearly recognizable clade, but their further relationships are otherwise less clear. They were often placed in the subgenus Exornator, or considered a distinct subgenus Rhombochaetodon with the atoll butterflyfish as type species. According to various DNA sequence studies, some older and more singular lineages. These include species such as the Asian butterflyfish (C. argentatus), the blue-striped butterflyfish (C. fremblii) and Burgess' butterflyfish (C. burgessi). C. burgessi is in fact so peculiar that it was placed in a monotypic subgenus Roaops. But recognition of this would probably result in several other small or monotypic subgenera becoming justified, and the older Rhombochaetodon would be the more conveniently apply to the entire radiation. But the expanded group is of unclear relationships to species like the speckled butterflyfish (C. citrinellus) and the four-spotted butterflyfish (C. quadrimaculatus). These might be members of the subgenus Exornator - the lineages around the spot- banded butterflyfish (C. punctatofasciatus) - and C. citrinellus certainly looks somewhat similar to these. Yet phylogenetically, their position towards Rhombochaetodon is unresolved, and ultimately it might be better to merge both Rhombochaetodon and Roaops in Exornator. If the genus Chaetodon is split up, Exornator might become a subgenus of Lepidochaetodon or a separate genus.

It was again mentioned in a Latin document of Diocese of Wroc≈Çaw called Liber fundationis episcopatus Vratislaviensis from around 1305 as item in Semoraz debent esse XX mansi, de quibus ad ecclesiam ibidem pertinent V) mansi ab antiquo. It meant that the village was supposed to pay a tithe from 20 greater lans, while 5(6?) where reserved for a local church since a yore. The village belonged initially to the Duchy of Opole and Racib√≥rz and the Castellany of Cieszyn, which was in the process of feudal fragmentation of Poland in 1290 formed into the Duchy of Teschen and was ruled by a local branch of Silesian Piast dynasty. In 1327 the duchy became a fee of the Kingdom of Bohemia, which after 1526 became a part of the Habsburg Monarchy. Until the 16th century Simoradz was owned directly by Cieszyn dukes, then it belonged to noble families. Local Catholic parish, undoubtedly one of the oldest in the region, was again attested in an incomplete register of Peter's Pence payment from 1335 as Zimoracz. It was again mentioned in the register of Peter's Pence payment from 1447 among 50 parishes of the Teschen deanery as Schimoradz. The current Saint James church was built in the 15th century. During the Protestant Reformation many of the local citizens changed their denomination to Lutheranism and took over the local church. It was returned to Catholics in 1654. The first school in Simoradz was established in 1763, and waited to 1793 for a dedicated building next to the church. After the Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire (which led to abolition of feudalism) a modern municipal division was introduced in the re-established Austrian Silesia. The village as a municipality was subscribed to the political district of Bielsko and the legal district of Skocz√≥w. It was ruled by an elected vogt (Polish: w√≥jt), the first being Pawe≈Ç Ciema≈Ça. In 1873 the new vogt was Ludwik Ru≈ºiczka, a merchant from Wien, who changed the official language of the gemeinde to German. Ru≈ºiczka was replaced by Jerzy Raszka in 1888, who made back Polish language official in municipality. He also wrote down a memoir of the municipality. A new school was built in 1903. According to the censuses conducted in 1880, 1890, 1900 and 1910 the population of the municipality grew from 508 in 1880 to 569 in 1910 with a majority being native Polish-speakers (98.8‚Äì100%) and at most 6 or 1.2% German-speaking in 1880, in terms of religion the majority were Protestants (62.6% in 1910), followed by Roman Catholics (36.4% in 1910) and Jews (6 or 1% in 1910).Ludwig Patryn (ed): Die Ergebnisse der Volksz√§hlung vom 31. Dezember 1910 in Schlesien, Troppau 1912. The village was also traditionally inhabited by Cieszyn Vlachs, speaking Cieszyn Silesian dialect. After World War I, the fall of Austria-Hungary, Polish‚ÄìCzechoslovak War erupted. In 28 to 30 January 1919 the battle between Polish and Czechoslovak troops took place here. After the division of Cieszyn Silesia in 1920, the village became a part of Poland. In the years 1926-1928 local Lutherans built a cemetery chapel, since 1995 a Holy Spirit Church. It was then annexed by Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II. After the war it was restored to Poland.

The airport is from downtown Spartanburg which makes it popular for private and corporate aircraft. History South Carolina's first commercial airport was opened in 1927. Famed aviator Charles Lindbergh participated in the grand opening of the airport only months following his historic flight across the Atlantic. Passenger air service commenced that same year but ended in 1962 with the opening of the Greenville-Spartanburg Jetport, later renamed Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport. In April 1957 Eastern scheduled six weekday departures, Southern had four and Delta had three. During World War II the airport was a training facility for the United States Army Air Corps and a refueling stop for naval aviators. An FAA operated air traffic control tower was operational at the airport but closed in 1981 during the PATCO controllers strike. Runways and other facilities The airport once had three intersecting runways with a parallel taxiway system connecting them to the aircraft parking apron. Runway 4/22 was long by wide, Runway 17/35 was long by wide, and runway 11/29 was long by wide. Today only runway 4/22 remains but was redesignated as runway 5/23 several years ago. Prevailing winds in the area generally favor the use of this runway. Only remnants of the other runways are visible today. An instrument landing system (ILS) is available for use on runway 5. WAAS approaches are available to runway 5 and runway 23. Runway 5 also has high intensity runway edge lighting (HIRL), visual approach slope indicator lights (VASI), and a medium intensity approach lighting system (MALSR). Other navigational aids nearby are the Spartanburg Vortac (VOR) (7.2 miles northeast) and the Fairmont Non-directional beacon (NDB) (1.6 miles west). The airport's 1936 terminal building, extensively renovated and expanded in 2011, houses a fixed-base operator (FBO) operated by the City of Spartanburg. The airport also houses two flight schools, Pivotal Aviation and Aero II. Adjacent to the terminal building are several aircraft hangars. The airport is home to the Spartanburg Composite Squadron of the Civil Air Patrol and to the Spartanburg Pilot's Association =Runway expansion and children's playground= A 25-million dollar extension of runway 5/23 began in late 2016 and was completed in 2018. The extension project lengthened the runway to 5,852 feet and added safety areas to both runway ends. The project included resurfacing the runway and upgrading airport navigation and lighting systems. Another projects completed in 2018 was an aviation-themed playground at the airport. The playground includes a viewing platform and a pavilion with restrooms. Economic Impact The Spartanburg Downtown Memorial Airport contributes $15.4 million to the local economy. It is the 3rd busiest general aviation airport in South Carolina with almost 69,000 operations yearly. The airport creates 190 aviation-related jobs in the area, with a payroll of more than $5.2 million.

History The park was formed from land first acquired by the Park Commission in 1888. Genesee Valley Park is among the many parks in New York state designed by Frederick Law Olmsted. Within Rochester, other Frederick Law Olmsted parks include Highland Park, Maplewood Park, and Seneca Park, which is now a zoo. Olmsted had originally designed the east and west sides of the park to have different purposes. The east side was intended to provide the feeling of a large pasture while the west side was for more recreational activities. At Olmsted's suggestion, a flock of 80 sheep was introduced into the park in 1893, which added to the pastoral sense of the park and also helped to keep the grass trimmed. In 1917, the golf course was expanded from 9 to 18 holes. The Barge (Erie) Canal was merged with Genesee River within the park on May 10, 1918. With the opening of Genesee Expressway (now part of Interstate 390), the park was bisected straining the original pastoral atmosphere.

It was built by the Highland Railway as a tactical measure to exclude a rival railway company and to move the locals from Fortrose onwards to other destinations. It opened in 1894, making a junction with the Far North Railway Line at Muir of Ord. Serving an agricultural and coastal area, it was never commercially successful and in 1951 the passenger service was withdrawn. A goods train service continued, but it too closed in 1960. There is now no railway use of the former line. History The Fortrose branchThe Highland Railway was established in 1865 and became dominant in the area of Scotland between Perth, Inverness and north and west of there. The relatively thin population density in its area of influence meant that great profitability was not available to the company, and it fought strenuously to retain dominance in the area that it considered belonged to it alone. It operated the Far North Railway Line from Inverness to Wick and Thurso, but the difficult geography meant that the line formed a wide sweep round the western end of the Black Isle, to avoid crossing the Beauly Firth and the Cromarty Firth. The Highland Railway was surprised when in 1889 the Great North of Scotland Railway (GNoSR) proposed the construction of a railway to Fortrose, a town on the Black Isle located on the coast of the Moray Firth opposite Fort George. The GNoSR operated a network from Aberdeen and the nearest place to Inverness served by it was at Elgin, some distance away. The branch would have been detached from the owning railway, but running through the Black Isle it would have made a junction with the Highland Railway at Muir of Ord. A ferry operation from Fortrose to Ardersier, on the south side of the Moray, was included in the plans. Ardersier was then known as Campbelltown, and a railway branch to it was included. Two other schemes striking into Highland territory were proposed at the same time, elevating Highland Railway discomfort about its competitive position. The two companies had been adversaries for some time, and in 1883 and the following years there had been a state of continual warfare over junctions, frontiers and running powers. The Highland saw at once that if this branch were built, it would be easy for the GNoSR to demand running powers into Inverness to reach its branch, and in that way the rival company would have gained access to the Highland's stronghold. The Highland Railway began preparing its opposition to the GNoSR when the latter wrote proposing a \\"solution\\" to the \\"problem\\": that the GNoS should simply be given running powers for its Aberdeen trains into Inverness. This startlingly bold proposition confirmed the Highland Railway's fears, and the Highland Railway decided to respond to the tactical attack with its own tactical response: it wrote back proposing that the two companies should consider merging, and that meanwhile the proposed new lines, and any running powers, should be held off until the merger was negotiated. The GNoSR was not to be deterred by this obvious stalling tactic and it went ahead with its Parliamentary Bill. The Highland Railway immediately presented its own Bill for a Fortrose branch from Muir of Ord and extending a short distance beyond Fortrose to Rosemarkie, and also a branch to Ardersier, south of Beauly Firth. It was the Highland Railway's Bill that was approved in Parliament, gaining the Royal Assent on 4 July 1890, and the GNoSR withdrew its Bill. The Highland Railway wasted no time in starting construction, which it did on 19 November 1890. The extension to Rosemarkie was omitted, and the branch was to be 13 miles long. Construction was not swift, and finally it opened for traffic on 1 February 1894, with four intermediate stations. The construction had cost ¬£57,560. The line was worked on the \\"one engine in steam\\" principle, and there were seven trains each way daily, of which four were mixed. Two of the mixed trains were eliminated in 1897. None of the trains on the branch ran through beyond the Muir of Ord junction station; and the journey took 45 to 50 minutes. A second railway on the Black Isle was authorised as the Cromarty Railway under a Light Railway Order of 1 August 1902. It was to run from Conon, on the Inverness to Dingwall main line, to Cromarty. There were serious difficulties in obtaining possession of the land at the Conon end, and money was desperately short, so that construction was delayed. Six miles of track had been laid by the outbreak of war in 1914, but the outbreak of hostilities and the demand for track materials in the war zone resulted in the track being removes, and the project was never completed, and the proposed line was abandoned. A private station was opened at Rosehaugh, serving the residence of James Douglas Fletcher, a director of the Highland Railway. The halt was open by 1905. The quiet branch line continued with little change in the twentieth century, while the Highland Railway was made a constituent of the new London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) in the \\"grouping\\" of the railways in 1923, following the Railways Act 1921. The difficult terrain of the Black Isle made it especially susceptible to competition from road transport for both passenger and goods traffic. The line continue into the British Railways era after nationalisation in 1948 but passenger traffic was closed from 1 October 1951. A particular issue for passenger traffic was that access from the branch to the county town of Dingwall always involved a change of train at Dingwall. Goods trains continued running for the time being, but they too were unable to compete with the greater flexibility and lower operating cost of road transport, and the goods service closed on 13 June 1960. The line closed completely and the track was subsequently removed.

The film made its Japanese debut on August 22, 2009 in Tokyo and Osaka. Cencoroll made its debut in the United States at the New York Anime Festival on September 25, 2009. A sequel, Cencoroll 2, was released on June 29, 2019, in a dual-screening featuring the first film as Cencoroll Connect. Another sequel titled Cencoroll 3 has been green-lit for production. Plot In Cencoroll, large, mostly white amorphous creatures have been appearing in a town modeled after Sapporo, Hokkaid≈ç, Japan. (Hiro Shimono) is a male high school student who keeps one such shapeshifting creature named , which he can control via telepathy, though wants to keep it a secret. An inquisitive girl named (Kana Hanazawa) chances upon Cenco at school when it is transformed into a bicycle. After Tetsu arrives to retrieve the bicycle, Yuki inadvertently causes Cenco to transform back into its normally large form by poking it in the eye. Yuki is much more interested in Cenco than Tetsu and accompanies them into town. There, a boy named (Ry≈çhei Kimura), who controls two of the creatures, confronts Tetsu in order to obtain Cenco. Tetsu manages to fend off Sh≈´'s attacks while also protecting Yuki, and they leave while Sh≈´'s creature is incapacitated. Sh≈´ confronts Yuki later that day and gets her to tell Tetsu to meet and fight Sh≈´ again. The following day, Sh≈´ takes Yuki hostage to force Tetsu to come, and places her on a ledge of a tall building. After Tetsu arrives, Sh≈´ attacks from afar and manages to cut off one of Cenco's arms. To repair the arm, Cenco removes one of Tetsu's arms, which incapacitates him momentarily. Sh≈´ arrives with a much larger creature and Cenco takes Yuki within its body where Tetsu already is. Yuki gets Cenco to change control of it from Tetsu to herself, and after Sh≈´'s larger creature eats Cenco along with Yuki, she manages to take control of the larger creature as well. They are subsequently attacked by the military with tanks and missiles, but are protected for the time being when Yuki changes the creature's shape to that of a massive walnut. Tetsu and Yuki are separated and Sh≈´ attempts to take control back from Yuki, but he cannot control the creature anymore and severs the link, effectively killing it. Tetsu makes it back with Cenco to where Yuki and Sh≈´ are, and Yuki knocks Sh≈´ out with Cenco transformed into a baseball bat. Afterwards, Yuki transforms Cenco into Tetsu's lost arm, which gives him back control of his limb. Sh≈´ is later shown having been rescued by his other creature. Production Cencoroll is based on a one-shot manga entitled Amon Game written and illustrated by Atsuya Uki. The manga won the Grand Prix Award in Kodansha's Afternoon Shiki manga competition in 2005. In 2006, Anime Innovation Tokyo began an initiative to sponsor anime produced by independent animators and small studios and chose Cencoroll as their first sponsored project. In 2007, Uki created a Cencoroll short film and distributed it over the Internet; due to the praise it received, Uki decided to nearly singlehandedly write, design, direct, and animate a 30-minute Cencoroll film. Cencoroll marked the first time the production company Aniplex had agreed to back a project that was animated almost entirely by one person. Originally, the film was given the tentative title Untitle. Ryo of Supercell produced the film's music. The film's theme song is \\"Love & Roll\\" by Supercell, and was released on August 12, 2009 on Supercell's debut single along with an instrumental track featured in the trailer for Cencoroll called \\"Theme of 'Cencoroll'\\". Release and reception Cencoroll had its world premiere at Canada's Fantasia International Film Festival on July 28, 2009 and was subtitled in English. The film was released to a small number of theaters in Tokyo and Osaka, Japan on August 22, 2009. Cencoroll made its debut in the United States at the New York Anime Festival on September 25, 2009 and was subtitled in English. A 90-second trailer was available at Tokyo International Anime Fair in March 2009, and three television commercials were released between July and August 2009. A DVD of the film in limited and regular editions was released by Aniplex on October 28, 2009.

He was famous in mid-16th-century Italy for his madrigals, approximately 200 of which were printed in Venice, some in multiple printings due to their considerable popularity. As evidence of his widespread fame, he is listed by Rabelais in Gargantua and Pantagruel as one of the most famous musicians of the time, and the printed music for one of his madrigals appears in a painting by Caravaggio (The Lute Player). Life The Lute Player by Caravaggio (1596). One of the musical scores shown in this painting is a secular composition by Jacquet de Berchem. Berchem was born around 1505 in Berchem (now part of Antwerp), in the southern Netherlands (modern-day Belgium).Nugent, Grove online No archival records have yet been found covering his early life; the first mention of him dates from 1539, by which time he had come to Venice, as did so many of his musical compatriots from the Low Countries. By 1538 or 1539Lewis, p. 71 his madrigals were being published in Venice, largely by Antonio Gardano. Between then and 1546 he lived in Venice, steadily increasing in reputation, and in 1546 he published his first book of madrigals; previously his works had been in collections consisting mostly of music by others (for example, Jacques Arcadelt, whose first book of madrigals for four voices, published in 1539, included some music by Berchem). He most likely was a student of fellow Netherlander Adrian Willaert, the founder of the Venetian School and one of the most famous musicians of the time, and through Willaert met other musicians and nobility; to some of these aristocrats, including a future Doge of Venice (Marcantonio Trevisan, Doge in 1553‚Äì54, and also a patron of the arts), he dedicated some of his music.Lewis, p. 73 Between 1546 and 1550 Berchem served as maestro di cappella at Verona Cathedral. Some of his music written during this time and the early 1550s is dedicated to Alfonso II d'Este; he may have been looking for employment with the Este court in Ferrara, but no evidence of his employment there has turned up. Around 1550 Berchem left Verona, and began seeking employment elsewhere in Italy. His exact activities in the early 1550s are not known, but he made the acquaintance of patrons in Rome and Monopoli, and through one of these patrons met his future wife, Giustina de Simeonibus, to whom he was married in 1553. He seems to have lived the remainder of his life in Monopoli, a town near Bari on the heel of the Italian \\"boot\\", where he lived in relative affluence, since both the governor and bishop of Monopoli were his patrons, and his wife was from an aristocratic family. His exact date of death is not known, but he is mentioned as being alive by Guicciardini in his Descrittione (pub. 1567, but likely written around 1565), and had died by March 2, 1567.Morgante (1986)Morgante (1986), Nugent, Grove online Works While Berchem wrote a few sacred works ‚Äì two masses and nine motets have been securely attributed to him ‚Äì it is on his more than 200 secular works that his reputation rests. Most of his secular works are Italian madrigals, with the rest being chansons in French. The sacred works are relatively conservative in style, using cantus firmus techniques, canon, and other devices common a generation earlier. In his secular music, his style varied throughout his career, with his earlier madrigals, such as in the 1546 collection, tending towards polyphonic textures as was the common practice of the Franco-Flemish school, and the later madrigals, such as those in the 1561 collection, being more homophonic and syllabic, often with quick text declamation. His preferred subject matter was love, typically unrequited, and he set texts by Petrarch, Ariosto, Luigi Tansillo, Luigi Cassola, and others. One of his most ambitious projects was a setting of 91 stanzas of Ariosto's Orlando furioso, entitled Capriccio (this is the earliest known use of \\"Capriccio\\" as a musical title). This work first appeared in his 1561 madrigal collection, published by Antonio Gardano, and was dedicated to Alfonso II d'Este.Lewis, p. 74 His Alla dolc'ombra, published in 1544, may be the earliest attempt to create a madrigal cycle, preceding similar groups of madrigals by Jan Nasco and Vincenzo Ruffo, madrigalists also active in northern Italy at the same time. Madrigal cycles were one of several precursors to opera. Influence Verona Cathedral: view from the Cathedral cloister with Sanmicheli's bell tower. Berchem was maestro di cappella here from 1546 until 1550. Berchem's madrigals were widely printed and distributed. Many of them were subsequently printed in instrumental versions, for example lute intabulations; it is one of these scores which appears in Caravaggio's painting The Lute Player, which was painted approximately fifty years after the music's first publication. Music by Berchem continued to appear in collections well into the 17th century. Confusion of his name with other composers named \\"Jacquet\\" or \\"Jacques\\" (for example Jacquet of Mantua, Jacques Buus, and Jacquet Brumel, organist at Ferrara and son of Antoine Brumel) was as common then as now, and may have been one of the reasons he sought to have his madrigals printed in editions containing only his own works. In the preface to his 1546 publication of madrigals for five voices he specifically mentions \\"crows who dress up in swan's feathers\\" and implies that plagiarists and those who misattribute his compositions will be corrected.Atlas, p. 467 Fran√ßois Rabelais mentions Berchem in the prologue to the Fourth Book of Gargantua and Pantagruel (probably written in 1546), putting Berchem last on the list of the most distinguished musicians of the time, a list which begins with Josquin des Prez and Johannes Ockeghem. These distinguished musicians sing, in the story, and in the context of a long tale by Priapus in which he boasts of his extraordinary male endowment, a ribald song involving the use of a mallet to deflower a new bride.Rabelais, Gargantua and Pantagruel, p. 445 References * Domenico Morgante, La Cappella musicale del Duomo di Monopoli nel Rinascimento: l‚ÄôAntifonario del 1532, la prassi esecutiva, i documenti inediti su Jachet de Berchem, in \\"Monumenta Apuliae ac Japygiae\\", I (1981) * Domenico Morgante, Jachet de Berchem, in ‚ÄúDizionario Enciclopedico Universale della Musica e dei Musicisti‚Äù, Le Biografie, vol.

On May 22, 1863, Renninger was one of 150 Union soldiers who volunteered to lead an assault on the Confederate heights at the Battle of Vicksburg, Mississippi. The plan was for the volunteer storming party to build a bridge across a moat and plant scaling ladders against the enemy embankment in advance of the main attack. The volunteers knew the odds were against survival and the mission was called a \\"forlorn hope\\" in nineteenth century vernacular. Only single men were accepted as volunteers and even then, twice as many men as needed came forward and were turned away. The assault began in the early morning following a naval bombardment and it was a failure. The Union soldiers came under enemy fire immediately and were pinned down in the ditch they were to cross. Despite repeated attacks by the main Union body under the command of General Grant, the men of the forlorn hope were unable to retreat until nightfall. Of the 150 men in the storming party, two-thirds were killed. Corporal Louis Renninger of Company H, 37th Ohio Volunteer Infantry was one of the survivors and for his gallantry, he was awarded the Medal of Honor in 1894. As a result of his injuries, he was transferred to the Veteran Reserve Corps, and discharged in October 1864.

Accessed November 13, 2008. She led the founding of Connecticut Hospice, the first hospice program in the United States. Late in life, Wald became interested in the provision of hospice care within prisons. In 1998, Wald was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame.National Women's Hall of Fame, Florence Wald Biography =Early life= Wald was born as Florence Sophie Schorske in New York City on April 19, 1917. Due to a chronic respiratory ailment, she spent several months as a child in a hospital. This hospitalization experience led her to pursue a career in nursing.Sullivan, Patricia. \\"Florence S. Wald, 91; U.S. Hospice Pioneer\\", The Washington Post, November 13, 2008. Accessed November 13, 2008. Wald received a B.A. from Mount Holyoke College in 1938 and an M.N. from Yale School of Nursing in 1941. After World War II, she became a staff nurse with the Visiting Nurse Service of New York, a research assistant at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, and was an instructor at the Rutgers University school of nursing. She received a second master's degree from Yale University in mental health nursing in 1956 and became an instructor at the school's nursing program. She became Dean of Yale School of Nursing in 1959, after being named to the position on an acting basis the previous year.Florence Wald, Yale School of Nursing. Accessed November 13, 2008. A short time later, she reconnected with Henry Wald, whom she met initially while she was conducting a study with the United States Army Signal Corps. The couple married later that year. =Hospice movement= Wald's interest in the care of the terminally ill was piqued in 1963 when she attended a lecture at Yale University presented by the English physician Cicely Saunders, an innovator in the field who later created St. Christopher's Hospice, the world's first purpose-built hospice. Dr. Saunders spoke that day about her methods of using palliative care for terminally ill cancer patients, with the intention of allowing those in the latest stages of their disease to focus on their personal relationships and prepare themselves for death. An \\"indelible impression\\" was made by Dr. Saunders, with Wald noting that \\"until then I had thought nurses were the only people troubled by how a terminal illness was treated\\". Following the Saunders lecture, Wald worked to update the nursing school's curriculum to encourage students to focus on the patient and their family, and to keep all of them involved in the patient's care. She left her position as dean in 1966, with plans to develop a hospice in the United States similar to the one Saunders was developing in England. Though she stepped down as dean, Wald retained a faculty position as a research associate and as a member of the clinical nursing faculty, and was promoted to a full professor there in 1980. Despite the financial impact on their family, she continued her goal of building a program and visited England twice with her husband to visit Dr. Saunders. St. Christopher's Hospice opened in 1967; Wald worked there for a month in 1969. Her husband left his engineering firm and enrolled at Columbia University in 1971 with a major in hospital planning. It was his master's degree thesis that provided the framework for the Connecticut Hospice. Wald conducted a two-year research program studying how terminally ill patients fared at home or in a healthcare facility, and tracked how patients and their families felt throughout the process. After returning to the United States, she organized a team of doctors, clergy and nurses to investigate the needs of dying patients. In 1974, she, along with two pediatricians and a Yale medical center chaplain, founded the first hospice in the United States at the Connecticut Hospice, located in Branford, Connecticut. Initially the program provided home care, and had its first inpatient location in 1980, a 44-bed facility in Branford. Disagreements had been brewing within the board about her vision for the hospice program, and she was forced to resign shortly after its opening. Other hospice programs were created building on Wald's innovation at Branford. By 1980, Medicaid began to pay for care provided at a hospice, which led to a sharp rise in such facilities. By the time of her death in 2008, there were more than 3,000 hospice programs in the United States, serving some 900,000 patients annually. =Later life= Well into her 80s, Wald traveled to prisons in Connecticut performing a research project on behalf of the National Prison Hospice Association, an organization founded in 1991 and based in Boulder, Colorado. Wald served on the organization's board of directors. Wald worked on considering ways to make hospice care available to those incarcerated in the prison system, including training inmates to become hospice volunteers for dying inmates or arranging for outside hospice care for inmates granted compassionate leave given their medical condition. Wald noted that training prisoners to provide such care would assist the terminally ill and help rehabilitate the volunteers at almost no cost to the prisons.Rierden, Andi. \\"A Calling for Care Of the Terminally Ill\\", The New York Times, April 19, 1998. Accessed November 13, 2008. She was awarded an honorary doctorate in 1996 from Yale University, Wald was introduced as \\"the mother of the American hospice movement\\". Speaking of her interest in prison hospice care in 1998, Wald said, \\"People on the outside don‚Äôt understand this world at all. Most people in prison have had a rough time in life and haven‚Äôt had any kind of education in how to take care of their health. There is the shame factor, the feeling that dying in prison is the ultimate failure.\\" Florence Wald died at age 91 on November 8, 2008 at her home in Branford, Connecticut.

It opened in 1902, having been heavily subsidised by the fourth Duke of Sutherland. It was worked by the Highland Railway. Although it provided a useful link, the journey to Inverness was circuitous, and the development of road services for goods and passengers led to a steep decline, and it closed in 1960. Conception The Sutherland Railway opened its line to Golspie in 1868, part of a route that eventually connected Inverness to Thurso and Wick, operated as the Far North Line. The Dornoch Firth presented a considerable natural barrier to the direct route of the line, although a crossing at Meikle Ferry would have been possible, putting Dornoch (population 2,861 in 1861) on the main line. However the Duke of Sutherland desired that the railway should come through Ardgay, and as he funded a considerable part of the cost of the line his wishes were complied with. The line made a wide westward sweep through Invershin and Lairg, and left Dornoch some considerable distance ‚Äì ‚Äì from the nearest station at The Mound.The name refers to the Thomas Telford road embankment. Passengers made their way to the main line in an ancient mail coach. The passing of the Light Railways Act 1896 encouraged many local communities to consider whether they could provide a railway connection for themselves. The Act implied that less formal, low-cost operational and engineering arrangements would be possible, although this was never made specific. The Dornoch Light Railway Company was formed in early 1897 to build a branch line. The fourth Duke of Sutherland was its chairman, and contributed ¬£5,000, and gave much of the land free; he had a seat on the Highland Railway board. A prospectus was issued in November 1898, quoting the cost of the line at ¬£30,000; individual subscriptions reached ¬£9,501. Sutherland County Council offered to contribute ¬£1,000; Dornoch Borough Council put in ¬£500. The Treasury was asked for ¬£9,000. The Highland Railway (HR; successor to the Sutherland Railway) worked the line. This was not to be taken for granted. The HR wanted to be paid ¬£1,000 for installing the junction at The Mound, although it relinquished the charge later. The Treasury grant was conditional on the Highland Railway guaranteeing to work the line for 99 years, which the HR declined to agree to, unless the directors of the Dornoch Light Railway gave personal guarantees, which they refused to do. The guarantee period was later reduced to 50 years. The Duke guaranteed the first 15 years and the HR softened its stance and agreed to guarantee the second 15 years. The HR was to be paid the actual cost of working the line. Construction Chisholm and Company of Dingwall contracted to build the line, for ¬£11,573. The first sod of the railway was cut on Achinehanter farm, just north of Dornoch, on 15 May 1900 by Miss Florence Chaplin, acting on behalf of the Duchess of Sutherland who was unable to attend on account of the illness of the Marquis of Stafford. In November 1900 Chisholm's company went bankrupt and work was suspended, and after some delay, a new contractor, Roderick Fraser, took over in July 1901. It ran north-west from Dornoch to the station at The Mound, and it opened on 2 June 1902. It was the first light railway in the Highlands, and it cost ¬£28,000 () to construct. There were stations at Cambusavie (actually having the status only of a \\"platform\\"), Skelbo, Embo and Dornoch. A dedicated platform was provided at The Mound for branch trains. The line was inspected by Major E Druitt of the Board of Trade on 29 May 1902 and declared fit for public service. =Gradients= Leaving The Mound the line fell sharply at 1 in 45 for , but after that the line was generally level with minor undulations as far as the third milepost. There followed a sharper sawtooth profile, with 1 in 45 once again for short lengths. Embo station was placed on a minor summit, and after a drop there was a second summit before a final steep descent to Dornoch station. =Dornoch Railway Hotel= On 17 October 1901 the Highland Railway announced its intention to build a large hotel in Dornoch, the first purely resort hotel built by the Highland Railway; it had 65 rooms and opened at the end of June 1904. Opening There was an opening ceremony on 2 June 1902: a special train hauled by the Duke of Sutherland's private locomotive \\"Dunrobin\\", ran from the Mound conveying invited guests. After a formal opening ceremony at Dornoch led by Mr D Maclean, Deputy Chairman of the Highland Railway, there was a luncheon. Among the speakers was Andrew Carnegie, \\"the American steel king and multi-millionaire, who resides at Skibo [Castle], in the neighbourhood of Dornoch\\". In a speech warmly praising the attractions of Dornoch, he said he \\"had come there to try to arrange that Dornoch would be placed in the programme for a through saloon, and he was assured that it would come direct\\". (He meant a through carriage from Inverness.) The Railway Magazine reported that: > A special six-wheel coupled, tank locomotive, \\"Dornoch\\". has been > constructed at the Inverness Works of the Highland Railway from the designs > of Mr. Peter Drummond for working the traffic on the line... Its chief > dimensions are six-coupled wheels 3ft 8in. diameter, wheel base 12ft. > (equally divided); total length over buffers 25ft. 3in., centre of boiler > above rail level 5ft. 4¬Ω in., top of chimney above rails 11ft. 6in. An illustration in the Railway Magazine article shows it to have been no. 56; in fact this was Lochgorm Tank 0-6-0T no. 56, which had been built in 1869 and rebuilt in 1896. It was specially renamed Dornoch for the branch, having previously been named Balnain. It was used on the branch until at least Summer 1919. Dornoch had a wooden engine shed, and the line was operated on the one engine in steam principle. The passenger train service at the beginning was three trains each way with an additional return journey on Tuesdays; Cambusnavie Platform was a request stop; the first train from Dornoch was at 6:10 am, no doubt to connect onwards to Inverness. The journey time on the branch was between 20 and 27 minutes; there was no Sunday service. A through carriage from Inverness was conveyed on the 12:58 pm train in 1905, and a through Pullman sleeper was run from Glasgow to Dornoch every Friday night in June. However, with the opening of the hotel in 1906 the HR laid on a dedicated train, the \\"Further North Express\\", which ran from Inverness to Dornoch on Fridays only during the months of July to September, non-stop from Inverness to the Mound. After October 1906 and the Further North Express became a Wick train, and Dornoch passengers had to change at the Mound unless an entire carriage had been reserved from Inverness. In 1922 the train service was simply three return journeys daily; the first train left Dornoch at 10:55 am and the last arrived there at 7:15 pm; the foreshortened working day was no doubt a result of the working hours limitation that had been introduced. The line was greatly appreciated by local people, although the journey to Inverness was very roundabout, at compared with a straight line distance of . Locomotives Locomotives used on the Dornoch branch needed to have a light axle loading, and they operated both passenger trains and pick-up freight. They were based at Helmsdale, where the running maintenance was carried out; there was a small shed at Dornoch for overnight stabling. After nationalisation two Highland Railway 0-4-4 Highland Railway W Class tank locomotives were retained for service on the branch: no. 55051 and 55053, formerly no. 25 and 45. 55051 was withdrawn in the summer of 1956, but 55053 was overhauled and continued in service. However early in 1957 its leading axle broke while it was hauling a mixed train on the branch. No-one was injured but this was the end of 55053, and an 0-6-0 pannier tank locomotive, no. 1646, was drafted in from the Western Region to take over. A second engine of the 1600 Class, no. 1649, was sent to Helmsdale in July 1958. A British Railways standard tender engine no. 78052 saw occasional work on the line between February 1957 and September 1958. Finances The DLR made a modest profit until 1921, when earnings of ¬£4,868 were overtaken by costs of ¬£5,612. It was then necessary to draw on the company's reserves of ¬£800, and it was obvious that the situation would further deteriorate. (The Highland Railway was working the line, so the Dornoch Light Railway company was simply a financial shell.) In that year the Railways Act 1921 was passed, signalling that the railways of Great Britain were to be \\"grouped\\", and this took effect in 1923. The Highland Railway was a constituent of the new London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS), and the LMS absorbed the Dornoch company. The LMS paid ¬£75 for every ¬£100 of Dornoch ¬£100 debenture stock, totalling ¬£1,652, and ¬£15 per ¬£100 of ordinary stock (¬£13,072). Closure In common with many branch lines serving areas with a low population density, the traffic on the line was hit hard by the advent of reliable road services, both for goods and passengers, and use of the line declined steeply. The line was first proposed for closure by in 1949 but following protests by Dornoch Town Council the Railway Executive relented and line was saved. It was eventually closed on 13 June 1960, having retained \\"a meagre passenger service, despite its geographical handicap\\". The line was then left and by 1962 & the track on the DLR had be lifted.

Jean Godeaux studied both law and economics, and started his career in 1947 at the NBB in the Foreign Affairs department. From 1949 until 1955, he was a member of the Belgian delegation to the International Monetary Fund. When he returned to Brussels in 1955, he was appointed as a director of the Banque Lambert, where he subsequently became co-administrator, and later chairman of the board of the bank. He was involved in the preparations for the merger with the Banque de Bruxelles, which would lead to the creation of the Banque Bruxelles Lambert. Godeaux resigned in 1974, before the finalisation of the merger, in order to become the president of the Banking Commission of Belgium, and in 1979 he joined the European Commission's Banking Advisory Committee. When he was appointed as governor of the NBB in 1982, he was immediately faced with the devaluation of the Belgian franc. Due to this devaluation the relations with Luxembourg had been seriously disrupted and he had the task to normalize the relations. In 1988, Godeaux became president of the Committee of Governors of the Central Banks of the Member States of the EEC, and of the European Monetary Cooperation Fund. In 1989 he contributed to the preparation of the Delors Report. He left the NBB in 1990, after which he joined the board of the Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale de Belgique, where he stayed until 1996. He was succeeded by Alfons Verplaetse as governor of the NBB. Godeaux had a passion for poetry. The poet Arthur Rimbaud was, by far, one of his favorites. Godeaux made a conference on him at the Midis de la Po√©sie in 1992. Godeaux died 27 April 2009 at the age of 86.

In 1835 he was appointed to a parish in Giessen, and to the chair of moral theology in the local theological faculty. His transfer to the professorship in Church history followed in 1837. The publication of the first volume of his Church history in 1841 aroused a storm of indignation among Protestants, to whom his unflattering account of the Protestant Reformation was distasteful. The Hessian Government hastened to retire him (19 Nov., 1842). This measure caused intense indignation among the diocesan Catholic clergy, who denounced the Protestant atmosphere of the university. Riffel retired to Mainz, where in 1851 Bishop von Ketteler appointed him professor of Church history in his newly organized ecclesiastical seminary.

It was first edited in 1928.Michel Andrieu and Paul Collomp Fragments sur papyrus de l'anaphore de Saint Marc, in Revue des sciences religieuses, pag 500-501, 1928 The Strasbourg papyrus contains an ancient Christian prayer, probably an Anaphora, similar to the first part of the Alexandrine Anaphora of Saint Mark (later known also as Anaphora of Saint Cyril). The Papyrus was probably written in the fourth or fifth century, but it may present an older text, resulting to be one of the older Eucharistic Prayer known. Since the 1970s many scholars started to think that this prayer is in itself a complete anaphora,Walter D. Ray The Strasbourg Papyrus in ed. Paul F.

Cuming Prayers of the Eucharist: Early and reformed, (1987), pag 52 even if this assumption has been challenged after the publication of the Barcelona Papyrus. The structure of such a prayer is very different from the thanksgiving over the wine and bread as found in chapter 9 and 10 of the Didache. Actually there is not even a mention of any food; nor does it present the Sanctus, nor an anamnesis nor an epiclesis and not even the Words of Institution. This text is anyway considered to include the base structure that we can find later in many other famous anaphoras. Content The Strasbourg Papyrus starts with a praise the Father for the creation of heaven and earth, the sea and all that is in them, quoting as usual in the Alexandrine anaphoras. It continues with a reference to Jesus Christ the Saviour, followed by we offer the reasonable (ŒªŒøŒ≥ŒπŒ∫·Ω¥ŒΩ) sacrifice and this bloodless worship (ref. ) and by the quotation of . The second part starts with the simple sentence Sacrifice of incense and offering., and it is followed by an intercession prayer for many different subjects, as the Church, the army, the princes, the souls of those who have fallen asleep, the orthodox fathers and the bishops.

She is best known as the dam of English Triple Crown winner Nijinsky. She was elected to the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame in 1980. Background Flaming Page was a bay mare bred in Canada by E. P. Taylor. She was sired by Bull Page, the 1951 Canadian Horse of the Year and a Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame inductee. Bull Page, who was also the sire of Canadian Hall of Famer New Providence, was an important early acquisition in Taylor's breeding enterprise. Despite his racing ability, Bull Page had soundness issues related to conformation defects that he passed on in varying degrees to his offspring. Flaming Page was out of Flaring Top, a daughter of the 1937 American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt Menow. Flaring Top produced several other stakes winners and stakes producers including two-time American champion filly Doubledogdare. Flaming Page grew into a large mare with a deep shoulder and a rangy build. She was sickle- hocked, a trait inherited from Bull Page. She raced under the colours of Taylor's Windfield Farm and was trained by Horatio Luro. Racing career As a two-year-old, Flaming Page had only two wins from seven starts, but one of those was the Shady Well Stakes at Woodbine and the other was an allowance race at Aqueduct in the United States. She also finished second in the Princess Elizabeth Stakes and third in the prestigious Coronation Futurity against colts. On the Canadian Free Handicap for two-year-olds, she was rated at 115 pounds, which tied her for first among fillies. In 1962, Flaming Page started her three-year-old campaign in the United Stakes, where the highlight was a second-place finish in the Kentucky Oaks to future U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee Cicada. On returning to Canada, she won the Canadian Oaks (now known as the Woodbine Oaks), Canada's most prestigious race for three-year-old fillies. One week later, she faced the colts in the Queen's Plate, where she and stablemate Choperion ran one-two as the even money favorites. Flaming Page became the first filly to complete the Oaks-Plate double. After the Queen's Plate, Flaming Page returned to the United Stakes where she suffered a career- ending injury in the Coaching Club American Oaks. Canada's leading money- earner in 1962 with $88,075, she was named the Canadian Champion three-year- old filly. Breeding record Flaming Page produced only three foals but even so would have a profound impact on the racing and breeding industry. Her first foal, born in 1964, was the filly Fleur, sired by Victoria Park. Fleur was a stakes-placed filly who became an outstanding producer. She is most famous for producing The Minstrel (by Northern Dancer), winner of the Epsom and Irish Derbies and 1977 Horse of the Year in England. Fleur also produced stakes winners Far North and Pilgrim, and stakes producer Dance Flower. Flaming Page was the first mare mated with Northern Dancer when he retired to stud in 1965. She was so tall compared to him that a trench needed to be dug so he could complete the mating. That first colt was stillborn. Flaming Page's next live foal, born in 1967, was the great Nijinsky, sired by Northern Dancer. Nijinsky, who physically resembled his dam, was England's first Triple Crown winner in 35 years and was named 1970 Horse of the Year in England. Nijinsky then became a Leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland and Leading broodmare sire in North America. Nijinsky was inducted into the Canadian Racing Hall of Fame in 1976. Her final foal was Minsky, also sired by Northern Dancer, who became Ireland's champion 2-year-old colt in 1970. In 1969, Flaming Page suffered difficulties foaling another Northern Dancer colt, which subsequently died. Flaming Page was unable to conceive again and was retired in 1975. She died in 1984. In 1980, Flaming Page was inducted into the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame.

History Although the southern coast of the Black Isle had been served since 1894 by the Highland Railway's Fortrose Branch, the northern portion was left \\"somewhat off the beaten track.\\"Vallance, pp. 58-9 A light railway running from Cromarty to Dingwall was proposed in 1897, as part of a wider programme to expand the Highland's network, to remedy this situation.Vallance, pp. 55, 59 The original scheme crossed the River Conon via \\"a bridge of considerable size\\" at Alcaig. However, a \\"fierce discussion\\" arose over whether the line should instead join the Highland Railway at Conon, avoiding the cost of the bridge. The dispute was resolved in favour of the Conon option when the Light Railway Commission \\"refused all assistance\\" if the Alcaig bridge were adopted.Vallance, p. 59 A Light Railway Order was obtained on 1 August 1902. However, further delays had arisen while the line's promoters negotiated with the Highland Railway to enable trains to continue over its tracks from Conon Bridge to Dingwall, and this situation was not resolved until after the order was issued. Construction eventually began from the Cromarty end, rather than from the junction, due to \\"considerable difficulty in the acquisition of certain lands.\\" Moreover, progress was slow, and Extension of Time Orders were obtained in 1907 and 1910.Vallance, p. 59 By 1914, about six miles of track had been constructed at the Cromarty end, and works, including a \\"substantial bridge\\" at Cullicudden Farm, were well advanced on an additional two miles, although work had not commenced on the remaining 11 miles. Work was suspended at the outbreak of World War I and the track lifted \\"about a year later\\" for use elsewhere. No further action was taken to complete the line.Vallance, p. 59 Stations were planned at Cromarty, Newhall, Drumcudden, Culbokie and Alcaig.Jowett, Plate 14 Connections to other lines * Inverness and Ross-shire Railway at Conon See also *RAILSCOT on Cromarty and Dingwall Light Railway  Notes  References  Category:Pre-grouping British railway companies Category:Early Scottish railway companies Category:Standard gauge railways in Scotland Category:Light railways Category:Black Isle Category:Railways authorised but not built in the United Kingdom ","title":"Cromarty and Dingwall Light Railway"},{"id":"14939892","text":"Gordon Edmondson Burniston (born 1885) was a professional footballer, who played for Huddersfield Town, & Merthyr Town.

It is found in the Indian Ocean, from eastern Africa south to 27¬∞S and east to Indonesia. [2008]: Chaetodon falcula. Retrieved 2008-SEP-01. It grows to a maximum of 20 cm (nearly 8 in) long. Its shape is reminiscent of longsnout butterflyfish, though the snout is not as extremely prolonged and the pattern is very different. The body is white with a series of narrow vertical dark grey lines and bright yellow and orange over the back, dorsal fin, anal fin and caudal fin. There are two well-defined black saddles on the back, and as usual the characteristic black eye-band of Chaetodon is present. The blackwedged butterflyfish is found on the reef edge and upper slope. It prefers current- prone habitats 1‚Äì20 m deep. It mainly feeds on invertebrates. It belongs to the large subgenus Rabdophorus which might warrant recognition as a distinct genus. In this group, the closest relative of this peculiar species is the similar-looking Pacific double-saddle butterflyfish or \\"false falcula\\", C. ulietensis. Other fairly close relatives are the quite differently-shaped but similarly colored lined (C. lineolatus) and spot-naped butterflyfishes (C. oxycephalus), while the blue-cheeked butterflyfish (C. semilarvatus) seems to be a far more basal lineage relative to all of these. The bluish vertical lines are present in all of these, while a white body with yellow behind and black on back and caudal peduncle are only shared among the four less ancient species.

For fourteen years he taught economics, finance, statistics, entrepreneurship, and forecasting as a tenured faculty member in the college of business at Rochester Institute of Technology. In 1979 Thomas Greco became a private consultant and community activist, working with local Rochester, New York peace and justice groups. From 1981 to 1990 he served as trustee and then president of the School of Living which promotes \\"self-governing communities that are democratic, humane, globally conscious and ecologically sound\\". A frequent contributor to the decentralist publication Fourth World Review, Greco organized of the Fourth World Assembly and New Economics Symposium held in San Francisco in 1987. From 1989‚Äì1991 he co-edited Green Revolution, a journal dedicated to right education, right living and personal responsibility. After moving to Arizona, Greco assisted in the development of LETSonora (a Local Exchange Trading System) and helped organize Tucson Traders, both now defunct, and in 1991 organized the Community Information Resource Center (CIRC) as a project of NEST, Inc., which promoted transformative approaches to community building. Greco has authored four books on monetary theory and how practical monetary alternatives can empower communities by generating credit under local control. He has written for a wide range of journals, including the Internet Journal of Community Research, Alternate, Common Dreams, Transformation, Global Research, Reality Sandwich, Whole Earth Review, World Business Academy Perspectives, At Work, Earth Island Journal, the Catholic Worker, The Permaculture Activist, Yes! Magazine, Green Revolution, and others. Since 2019, he has hosted Beyond Money Podcast. Approach to alternative currencies The essence of Greco's philosophy about money and the exchange of value might be summarized as the following: 1\\\\. The essence of money is credit. 2\\\\. Money has only one purpose: to enable the reciprocal exchange of value (payment) in the markets. 3\\\\. The other functions that money is said to serve (measure of value and store of value) are in reality served by other instruments, not money. 4\\\\. The interest/usury that is built into the global system of money creation causes a debt-growth imperative that is the driver of artificial economic growth, which in turn causes misdistribution of wealth, environmental despoliation and a tendency toward despotic government. 5\\\\. Economic equity demands the abandonment of interest- bearing debt as a general means of finance, and the use shared equity or shared revenue models instead. 6\\\\. The \\"credit commons\\" in every country needs to be reclaimed. Greco advocates for reclaiming the credit commons from private banking interests by (1) the cooperative issuance of private community currencies that are spent into circulation by trusted producers, and (2) the organization of producers and sellers into relatively small, local credit clearing exchanges that can be networked together to expand the scale and scope of moneyless trading opportunities. Greco writes: > The primary lever of power in today's world is the overly centralized, > monopolistic control over money, banking, and finance. Money constitutes the > greatest and most acute current problem, while being at once the structural > domain that is most ready for a transformational shift. It is clear that the > best and most promising approaches to liberating economic exchange are in > the realm of private, voluntary, free-market initiatives. In a review of Greco's Money: Understanding and Creating Alternatives to Legal Tender, Brian Leslie writes: > Greco is more concerned with the details of current and potential > alternative currencies, devoting much of his book to descriptions of current > examples and a selection of past ones, their strengths and weaknesses, and > theoretical possibilities and recommendations for future systems, several of > which are his own proposals. He notes that alternative currencies start and > are most successful at times (and in places) when the failings of official > money are having the greatest impact, and mostly discontinue when conditions > improve.Brian Leslie, Participatory democracy is good for you, review of > Thomas H. Greco, Jr. and Bernard Lietaer books on money. Journalist Jon Rutter described Greco's goal as \\"junking the dominant monetary system\\". He notes Greco's opinion that a centralized banking and investment system concentrates wealth, causing misery for average families. Rather than reform, Greco advocates \\"an entirely new system of money and exchange\\" which \\"democratizes credit and emphasizes local control.\\" Instrumental in the development of Greco's thinking on money are the writings of E.C. Riegel, who \\"conceived of money as simply number accountancy among private traders... There might be numerous trading circles, each with its own accountant but its [own value unit would be] indistinguishable from those of other trading circles. The accountant assigns each member of his circle a credit limit based on experience with that member‚Äôs type of business, charging a small fee to cover bookkeeping and insurance against default. Thus might different accounting firms form competitive trading circles, charging less or more for their insurance depending how lenient or strict the credit limits they allow.\\" Greco has consulted with various business barter exchanges which since the 1970s have been applying the credit clearing process that he has been advocating. Greco was the keynote speaker at the 2006 annual convention of IRTA (the International Reciprocal Trade Association), a global trade association for local business barter exchange networks. Many community and business groups have been consulted by Greco on how they can create home-grown means of payment (liquidity) that can save small business and put people back to work by shifting control back to local communities and compensating for the shortage of official currency credit that banks are supposed to provide. He has advised such groups as Current Innovations, Alliance for Human Empowerment, Community Forge, Sonoma GoLocal, Sardex, Banglapesa, and others.

Life and career Duban won the Prix de Rome in 1823, the most prestigious award of the √âcole des Beaux-Arts. He was much influenced by his five-year stay in Italy, particularly his sense of color, influenced by the polychrome paintings of ancient Pompeii, newly uncovered Etruscan tombs, and the tradition of the great decorations painted in the Renaissance.

The main building, the Palace of Studies, was designed with integral paintings and interior sculpture for artists' education. His redesign and alignment of the entire campus frames the main building from the entrance on Rue Bonaparte. With other expansions towards the Seine, this work was completed around 1861.

Life and career Nathan Huntley Edgerton was born on a farm, the eleventh out of thirteen children of Joseph Jesse Edgerton (1797‚Äì1865) and Charity Doudna (1799‚Äì1855). Joseph and Charity were both Quakers who had moved north from Wayne County, NC and into the Ohio farmlands in the Ohio valley when they were teenagers. The farm they built was in Barnesville, OH at the western edge of Belmont County which is opposite Wheeling, WV on the Ohio River, approximately 70 miles southwest of Pittsburgh. Edgerton's family were members of the Ohio Yearly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers). In Barnesville, he was a contemporary of Elisha Gray (1835‚Äì1901) the electrical engineer and co-founder of Western Electric and Isaac Charles Parker (1838‚Äì1896) the politician and jurist. Also, Barnesville was notable during his childhood as the hometown of the governor, Wilson Shannon (1802-1877). Of Charity Doudna Edgerton's thirteen children, Nathan Edgerton (she was 39 hen he was born) was one of eight that survived to adulthood. At 17, on 2 December, 1855, Edgerton lost his mother. By 1858, his father had remarried to Anna Mikkel Stratton (1817-1897) by whom Nathan gained a half- brother and two half-sisters, all of whom survived to adulthood. Upon completion of his education, he became a schoolteacher and was listed in the 1860 census as a teacher on the faculty of the Westtown School in West Chester, PA. It was while he was teaching here that he met Esther Lundy Mendenhall (1844-1914), a young, local Quaker woman. In the antebellum years, the Society of Friends, were noted for their commitment to abolition and equality for the African-Americans. However, having been born and raised as a Quaker, Edgerton did not join the war until 1863, when the Army of Northern Virginia invaded Pennsylvania. In so doing, he and his then fiancee, Miss Mendenhall, broke covenant with the Society of Friends. He joined the Pennsylvania militia, and served until the end of the Gettysburg Campaign. A few months later, he was commissioned a first lieutenant in the 6th United States Colored Infantry Regiment. By 1864, Lt. Edgerton had become the adjutant of the 6th USCT. In the early morning of September 29, 1864, his regiment advanced against the Confederate line at the Battle of New Market Heights in Virginia. The enemy held their fire until the Black soldiers were within 150 yards then unleashed a deadly volley of lead. One Union flag bearer was shot down, then another, then a third. Lt. Edgerton, despite being wounded himself, lifted up the flag and advanced it with his regiment until the Confederates retreated. Two senior non-commissioned officers of the regiment, both African-Americans, advanced the regimental colors with Lt. Edgerton. They were Sergeant Major Thomas R. Hawkins and First Sergeant Alexander Kelly. The three men, Edgerton, Hawkins, and Kelly are depicted in a painting, Three Medals of Honor by artist Don Troiani. The painting was unveiled June 24, 2013 at the Union League of Philadelphia. Almost two months later, on 16 November 1864, he married his fiancee, Esther Lu, at Christ Church, Philadelphia. After the wedding he returned to his regiment at the new year. Edgerton was promoted to captain while serving with the 6th USCT before the end of the war. Capt Nathaniel Edgerton was discharged from active duty 20 September 1865 less than a week after the birth of his first son, Arthur Duncan Edgerton(1865‚Äì1944). Upon his return to Philadelphia, he and his family moved to Schuylkill Township where they bought a home, and he found employment as a General Supervisor of Personnel for the Pennsylvania Railroad. In the ensuing years, Esther Lu and Nathaniel welcomed Edward Guy Carleton Edgerton(1872‚Äì1956), Ethelwynne Maude Edgerton(1874‚Äì1955), and Ralph Malcolm Edgerton (1876-c1950). By 1880, the family had relocated to 63 Wayne St, in North Philadelphia, near Wayne Junction where he worked as an agent for the electric light company. The gradual publication of the official war records from the end of the conflict through 1900 led to reviews of acts of valor by the US Army and Navy which led to nominations for the Medal of Honor in the latter half of the nineteenth century.For his conspicuous act of bravery, Nathan Huntley Edgerton was awarded the Medal of Honor. He received his medal on March 30, 1898. By 1900, Edgerton, his wife were renting a farm in Lower Providence Township with their youngest son, Ralph, as Nathaniel worked as an electrician. Some time before 1910, Edgerton and his wife moved to a farm in Agness, Oregon that they purchased with their son Ralph. Edgerton found work as an electrical engineer in Oregon while his son, Ralph ran the farm. In 1914, he lost his wife Esther Lu after almost fifty years of marriage. He soon retired from electrical work and labeled himself a farmer in business with his son in the 1920 and 1930 census. On 27 October 1932, the Medal of Honor recipient passed on at the age of 93. Despite initial plans for his burial at Arlington National Cemetery, his family instead chose to bury him on the farm beside Esther Lu. Having outlived his wife, all his siblings, and all his half-siblings, he was survived by his four children, two daughters-in-law, nine grandchildren, and twelve great-grandchildren.

Soon after the grand jury was convened, five other Laramie women made history becoming the first women in the world to serve on a trial jury. The women on the grand jury and the trial jury were selected less than six months after Wyoming's first territorial legislature granted women equal political rights.Larson, T. A.

Stewart took on the role of raising her seven younger siblings.Boyd Papers, Wyoming State Archives, Cheyenne Despite the hardships involved in this endeavor, she continued to attend school‚Äîand excel.

In the late winter of 1868, she moved West, arriving in Laramie, Wyoming on Dec. 16, 1868, just as the town was about to open its first public school. When it was learned she was a veteran teacher, she was hired‚Äîthe first teacher in the Laramie public schools. First classes began in February 1869.WPA File #584, Wyoming State Archives, Cheyenne In August, 1869, the Rev. F. L. Arnold came to Laramie to organize the Presbyterian Church. Eliza Stewart was one of the charter members. Shortly after that, she met Stephen Boyd, a machinist in the Union Pacific car repair shops who had come to Laramie before the first train arrived in 1868. Boyd, born in Canada, came to the United States and settled along the South Platte River near Denver before hiring on to the Union Pacific. Before her marriage Stewart received the call to serve on the grand jury. Stewart's unique position as the first woman selected gained some local fame. After jury service ended, Stewart returned to teaching. Marriage and later Stephen Boyd and Eliza were married July 21, 1870, in Cheyenne.Stephen Boyd obituary, ‚Äò‚ÄôLaramie Republican‚Äô‚Äô, Oct. 16, 1917 Two months after her marriage, Eliza was named to the organizing committee for the Wyoming Literary and Library Association.

She also continued to write poetry.Boyd Papers, Wyoming State Archives, Cheyenne In August 1873, Eliza became the first woman in Wyoming to be nominated to run for the Territorial legislature. For unknown reasons, she declined nomination, withdrawing her name from the ballot. (Some 37 years later, Laramie resident Mary Bellamy became the first woman elected to the Wyoming legislature, none having served in that body during the territorial period).

Over the years, Mr. Shahbazi embraced the American dream and work ethics, and made it a reality in his life, coming to own and operate a few gas station franchises in California. After having become convinced over the years, especially after the debacle that followed hurricane Katrina, that the major oil companies were in effect conspiring to gouge consumers and artificially raise prices at the pumps, Mr. Shahbazi began a controversial, and ultimately fatal, public protest of the oil majors from his Shell Oil franchise. His method included the prominent posting of signs on his station's grounds that openly declared his views and directed interested customers to \\"see the cashier\\" for further information, which included 2 page fliers detailing his views, complaints, and ultimately his concern both for the consumer, and the societal order (which he felt would not withstand the $5 per gallon price that he insisted was the predetermined price set for gas by the majors). His protest consequently resulted in legal battles with the Shell Oil Company (US), and ultimately his death, at the age of 65, due to the liver failure that apparently resulted from his 4 month liquid fast. He had previously lost his home, and started fasting during the later stages of his battles in the courtroom before losing his business.

Through a joint venture with Taylor Fresh Foods Inc., GSF is one of the biggest and longest-serving suppliers to McDonald's restaurants, including liquid products, and it's McDonald's third largest beef supplier in the U.S. market. History The company was founded in 1947 by Bill (William) Moore, and Frank Streeter and began as a small meat company to supply products to Los Angeles area restaurants and hotels. It is a 100% management owned and operated company. In the 1950s it became a primary supplier to McDonald's Corporation to provide the fast food restaurant chain with ingredients. On June 12, 1984; an employee Samuel Vasquez, then 22 years old was ground to death by a meat grinder in Golden State Foods' City of Industry, California facility when his coworker turned on the machine while he was inside. The machine was able to turn on due to the failure of Golden State Foods to practice Lockout‚Äìtagout procedures mandated by safety regulations. Their practice was to clean with the machine running as it was slightly easier. California OSHA and the Los Angeles County District Attorney filed a criminal charge against the company over this matter. Golden State Foods pleaded no contest to the criminal charge. In 1998, GSF was acquired by Wetterau Associates, a St. Louis based investment group led by the CEO Mark Wetterau and The Yucaipa Companies with the latter as the majority stakeholder. Chef Gold was launched in 2000 to produce liquid products, such as ketchup and mustard, and cooked meat products for a variety of customers. In the same year, GSF formed a self-serving subsidiary called Centralized Leasing Company (CLC) to provide GSF with leasing services. In 2002 Signature Services was launched to offer customized services such as store painting, lot striping, power washing and landscaping. In partnership with The Arthur Wells Group in St. Louis; GSF formed CFM Logistics to help clients with their freight distribution needs. By 2017, the company services approx. 25,000 restaurants. Prior to 2000, the entirety of GSF's revenue came from McDonald's. With expansion of customer base, by 2006, it's dependency on McDonald's was reduced to 80%. The vice president of distribution said in 2006 that they choose their new customers in such a way to avoid upsetting McDonald's. In 2004, Golden State Foods became a 100% management owned and operated company with the acquisition of 50.3% of company that was owned by The Yucaipa. In 2006, Quality Custom Distribution was formed as a subsidiary of GSF and serves over 7,500 Starbucks locations. It also deliver supplies to customers such as Chipotle Mexican Grill and Chick-fil-A. In May 2012, a 60 foot truck operated by a GSF / Quality Custom Distrubtion (QCD) employee Dawayne Eacret ran over and killed a bicyclist while making a right turn in downtown Portland, Oregon. In the lawsuit, the family argued the driver and the assistant Josiah Reed were negligent and sought $1.8 million in damages. The attorneys representing the deceased obtained an identical truck and demonstrated and video recorded that the driver and his passenger could have seen the bicyclist which resulted in GSF and the victim's parents settling for $700,000. In March 2019, GSF opened a 165.000-square-foot meat processing plant in Opelika, Alabama. In late 2019, GSF's QCD moved its headquarters to Frisco, Texas and acquired four warehouses in Midwest and Northeast regions in February 2020, becoming the Starbucks' top supplier In July 2020, the GSF's City of Industry, California facility was ordered shut down by the health department and remained shut for several days after failing to report an outbreak of 43 cases of COVID-19 to the health department as required. Operations GSF entered the baked goods business by forming a joint venture with Bryan, Texas-based Mid South Bakery. The baked products are distributed to customers in the Southeastern United States. The company reports it exports products to more than 40 countries.https://goldenstatefoods.com/about-us/global-presence/ GSF's Australian group, supplies produce to KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut. The company also owns a food processing and distribution center in Egypt, through which it provides processing and distribution services in the Middle East. = 2020 protest incident = On the night of June 1st, 2020 during a protest against police brutality in Portland, Maine a tractor trailer driver driving for GSF's Quality Custom Distribution drove into a crowd of protesters following a delivery. A chaos erupted after the driver drove into a crowd of protesters following a delivery. The driver was arrested on a felony charge of reckless conduct with a dangerous weapon.

They were usually small trawlers, fitted for the purpose of laying dans. A dan is a marker buoy which consists of a long pole moored to the seabed and fitted to float vertically, usually with a coded flag at the top. Dan laying was an important part of minesweeping, and boats were fitted specifically for this purpose. The task of a danlayer was to follow the minesweepers as they worked an area, and lay the dans which defined the area swept and made it obvious where the clear channels were. This would also help the minesweepers cover areas accurately without gaps and unnecessary overlaps.McDougall RJ, New Zealand Naval Vessels, p. 55. Wellington, NZ: Government Printing Office, 1989. A danlayer worked with a minesweeper flotilla when large areas of sea were to be clear-swept. List of danlayers =Germany= Since Germany had been an exponent of mine warfare since the 1920s, it was natural that the Kriegsmarine used a number of danlayers during World War II. Danlayers of the Kriegsmarine included the following vessels: *The 800-ton, 176-foot B 206 - This vessel was ceded to France in 1946 and outfitted as the surveying vessel Ingenieur-Hydrographe Nicolas *The 120-ton, 82-foot B 253, B 254, B 261, B 262, B 264, B 273 and B 275 - These were ceded to France in 1946 and renamed Rachgoun, Treberon, Tourteau, Cassidaign, Les Madeleines, Habibas and Crabe, respectively. Tourteau and Crabe became surveying tenders, while the others were employed as small harbor transports for naval personnel. *The 600-ton, 180-foot B 281 (formerly the patrol trawler V 204, originally named Zieten) - This vessel was ceded to France in 1946 and renamed Astrolabe as a surveying tender. *The 500-ton, 137-foot B 282 and B 284 (formerly the whalers Treff. 6 and Traff. 2), respectively) - Both were ceded to France in 1946 and renamed Estafette and Sentinelle as surveying tenders. =Britain= Danlayers employed by the Royal Navy during the extensive mine clearance operations following World War II included the following s. * Hellisay (T391) * Hermetray (T392) * Imersay (J422) * Orsay (J450) * Ronay (J429) * Sandray (J424) * Scaravay (J425) * Sheppey (T292) * Shillay (J426) * Sursay (J427) * Tahay (J452) * Tocogay (J451) * Trodday (J431) * Vaceasay (J432) * Vallay (J434) * Wiay (J441) Two s, Sir Lanceleot (T228) and were converted from minesweepers to danlayers prior to the Normandy landings. In 1944, prior to the Allied invasion of Normandy, the Admiralty-type Motor Mine Sweepers Nos. 141, 142, 238, 239, 240, and 241 were converted to danlayers and redesignated as follows: HMS Burfin, HMS Cottel, HMS Fichot, HMS Jude, HMS Quirpon, HMS St. Barbe, respectively. All were twin-screw, wooden, 105-foot, coastal- minesweeping sloops that were financed by Steers Ltd. of St. John‚Äôs, Newfoundland, and built by Henry Stone in his shipyard at Monroe, Trinity Bay, Newfoundland, Canada between 1941 and 1943. =New Zealand= Danlayers employed by the Royal New Zealand Navy during World War II * HMNZS Coastguard (T12) * HMNZS Kaiwaka (T14) * HMNZS Nora Niven (T23) * HMNZS Phyllis T22 Notes References *Francis E.

After releasing singles credited to the individual members, they began recording as The Meditations in late 1976, shortly after which they released their biggest hit, \\"Woman Is Like a Shadow\\", which sold over 45,000 copies in its first month of release.Germa, Romain & Maslowski, Nicolas (2007) Guidance sleeve notes from the Makasound release They recorded in the mid-1970s for producers such as Dobby Dobson, Joseph Hoo Kim, and Lee \\"Scratch\\" Perry, their righteously Rastafarian style gaining comparisons with The Mighty Diamonds. Their first album, Message From The Meditations, was released in 1977. Robert Christgau called it \\"a nice one\\" in Christgau's Record Guide (1981), highlighting the \\"island chauvinism\\" of songs like \\"Running from Jamaica\\", which \\"gets on those who emigrate to Canada, Britain, the States, and Africa\\". The Meditations sang backing vocals on a number of Bob Marley songs, including \\"Blackman Redemption\\", \\"Punky Reggae Party\\", and \\"Rastaman Live Up\\", as well as providing backing for Gregory Isaacs, Jimmy Cliff and The Congos (on their Heart of the Congos album).E A S Y S T A R * R E C O R D S They appeared at the One Love Peace Concert in April 1978, officially a commemoration of the 12th anniversary of Haile Selassie's state visit to Jamaica, but more famous for the handshake between Michael Manley and Edward Seaga when they joined Bob Marley on stage.

Cridland left the group, leaving Clarke and Watson to record 1988's For The Good of Man without him, but they were reunited for 1993's Return of The Meditations. All three members by this time were based in the US - Clarke in Phoenix, Arizona, Watson in Seattle, Washington, and Cridland in New York City. They have subsequently toured the United States and Europe.

During his tenure as governor of the NBB, the management of the Bank remained resolute in the face of ever-increasing calls for a devaluation of the belgian franc to resolve the crisis which hit Belgium in the 1970s. As an alternative, Cecil de Strycker emphasised the need for an effective recovery policy and wage moderation. He played an important role on the Committee of Governors of the Central Banks of the Member States of the European Economic Community and in the European Monetary Cooperation Fund, and in 1978 he became the president of both these institutions. In 1979, the European Monetary System was launched, which based on the ECU. On 19 February 1982 the Belgian government of Martens V, informed him that a devaluation of the Belgian franc was imminent.

The festival, organized by brothers Eduardo and Alfonso Lopez Negrete's company Promotora Go, McCann Erickson executive and sports promoter Justino Compean and Telesistema Mexicano producer Luis de Llano Macedo, took place at the height of La Onda and celebrated life, youth, ecology, music, peace and free love, has been compared to the American Woodstock festival for its psychedelic music, counterculture imagery and artwork, and open drug use. A milestone in the history of Mexican rock music, the festival has drawn anywhere from an estimated 100,000 to 500,000 concertgoers. The festival originally scheduled 12 bands booked by music impresarios Waldo Tena and Armando Molina Solis' agency, but a total of 18 acts performed outdoors during the first, sometimes rainy weekend, before a massive crowd. The event was captured in film by, among others, Cinematogr√°fica Marco Polo, Telesistema Mexicano, Cablevision and Peliculas Candiani. Audio was captured by Polydor Records and a live radio broadcast was sponsored by The Coca-Cola Company. Images of the festival were captured by photographers like Graciela Iturbide, Pedro Meyer and others. The Super 8 short films Av√°ndaro produced by Guti√©rrez y Prieto of Cablevision and directed by Alfredo Gurrola and Tinta Blanca en Av√°ndaro produced by Raul Candiani of Peliculas Candiani and directed by Humberto Rubalcaba were the only films exclusively about the first festival. They were exhibited at international film festivals and theaters in 1972. Other movies, which partially used footage of the festival, were the Cinematogr√°fica Marco Polo film \\"La verdadera vocaci√≥n de Magdalena\\" produced by Anuar Badin and directed by Jaime Humberto Hermosillo and the Super 8 films \\"The year of the rat\\" by Enrique Escalona and \\"La segunda primera matriz\\" by Alfredo Gurrola. An accompanying soundtrack with a selection of the live recordings produced by Luis de Llano's company LUDELL/BAKITA Records and named Avandaro, por fin... 32 a√±os despu√©s (Avandaro, at last ... 32 years later), was finally released in 2003. Before Avandaro: Massive events, student repression and La Onda By 1971 Mexico, ruled by the PRI, had organized two of the most important sporting events in the world: the 1970 FIFA World Cup and the 1968 Summer Olympics, gaining a fresh and modern image its government wanted to show to the outside world. At the same time, its government had violently repressed political youth movements known as the Tlatelolco massacre and the Halconazo, which in turn gave way to the so-called Mexican Dirty War of the early 1970s. The Mexican hippies, called \\"jipitecas\\" by Catholic priest and scholar Enrique Marroquin, created a multidisciplinary movement called La Onda (The wave). In accordance to their hippie values, La Onda did not advocate a violent overthrow of the PRI, but it did advocate change. By 1969 the government had already banned the musical Hair after a unique performance of it in Acapulco, censuring the rock band Los Shakes (which included stars Pixie Hopkin, Mayita Campos and Nono Zaldivar), investigating impresario Alfredo Elias Calles (grandson of late president Plutarco Elias Calles) and deporting foreign actors and producers like Michael Butler, Gerome Ragni and James Rado. Such actions were heavily covered by local and American media like The New York Times and Time. Writer Carlos Monsivais, who witnessed the event, wrote an extensive article about the incident in his book Dias de guardar. Also in 1969, the band Pop Music Team had suffered censorship due to their hit \\"Tlatelolco\\" (which only had two weeks of radio airplay) and in February 1971 in Monterrey, a collective band called Sierra Madre, led by Teja Cunningham, and a state-of-the-art lights spectacle named \\"Music and light show\\" had faced repression after a failed attempt to hold a three-day concert, called Concierto Blanco (white concert) inside the State government palace in Monterrey's main square. The violent incidents after the White concert, which were extensively covered by the media, seriously damaged then Nuevo Leon governor Eduardo Elizondo's political career. News from Cuba (Varadero '70), Colombia (Festival de Ancon), Argentina (Festival Buenos Aires Rock), Chile (Festival de los Dominicos \\"Piedra Roja\\"), England (Isle of Wight) and films from American festivals like \\"Monterey Pop\\" and \\"Woodstock\\" fueled the desire for the jipitecas to host their own major counterculture event. The opportunity arrived in the spring of 1971. History Trying to resurrect their popular auto racing spot, Circuito Av√°ndaro, after being cancelled in 1969 as a result of the fatal accident of racing driver Mois√©s Solana, Promotora Go owners brothers Eduardo and Alfonso L√≥pez Negrete in partnership with McCann vice-president Justino Compe√°n decided to organize a massive auto race with live rock music acts and consulted then Telesistema Mexicano promoter Luis de Llano Macedo to video-record the motoring event and to hire Javier B√°tiz and La Revoluci√≥n de Emiliano Zapata, two of the most popular Mexican rock acts of the time. Luis de Llano was at the time producing a section named La onda de Woodstock in the Jacobo Zabludovsky's program Hoy Domingo (Today Sunday). De Llano assembled a team of around 330 individuals to organize the music part of the festival, among them reporter/musicologist Jaime Almeida, screenwriter Armando Molina, publicist Carlos Alazraki, and MCs Roberto Naranjo and Eduardo Davis. Molina, himself an impresario and musician from La Maquina del Sonido fame, was appointed Music Coordinator. The music coordination was in the hands of the company ArTe, owned by Molina and Waldo Tena (of Los rebeldes del Rock fame). After many negotiations and declining invitations Molina proceeded to book 12 bands. Designer Joe Vera was hired to design the official poster and tickets were sold at AUTOMEX-Chrysler agencies across the country for MX$25. Jacobo Zabludovsky heavily supported and promoted the festival in his daily news program \\"24hrs\\" and he was one of the few mainstream broadcasters to defend it in its aftermath. The venue =Expectations= As was reported in the Corpus Christi Caller-Times, a maximum of 25,000 attendees, 122 pilots with their staff (with their number expected to reduce after the technical inspections) and 12 Mexican bands with a possible last-minute inclusion of American bands to bolster the event was expected. The bands were going to play from Saturday 7 pm to Sunday 7 am, making way for the auto race to start in public roads around the lake. 2 weeks before the event, the 5 hotels in town were already booked. In the TV Azteca documentary \\"Historias Engarzadas: Alex Lora\\" Alex Lora explained that this possible \\"inclusion of American bands\\" was going to be a surprise visit by Santana. =Live Radio Broadcasting= Sports promoter Justino Compean and Radio Juventud General Manager Ramiro Garza made a deal with then Coca-Cola Company Marketing Director, Vicente Fox Quezada, to sponsor the live broadcasting. =Lighting and sound systems= H√©ctor Yaber from Telesistema Mexicano was in charge of the lighting system and Gustavo Cota from the company Audiorama S.A. of the PA system. All equipments were transported by the company Mudanzas Galv√°n of Jos√© C. Galv√°n Castro. =Security= The security was going to be in charge of the State of Mexico's Judicial Police chief Cuauht√©moc Cardenas (not the politician of the same name), who was going to receive support from 200 state troopers, 120 army troops and 50 Special Agents from the Secretariat of the Interior as well as Valle de Bravo's Fire Department. Nevertheless, reports of the total amount of security agents were mixed. Variety reported a total of 700 law-enforcement agents. =Terms between the organizers and mayor Montes de Oca= The festival president Eduardo Lopez Negrete and Valle de Bravo's then-mayor Juan Montes de Oca Loza agreed that no liquor was going to be sold. Beer would be sold only with a meal. In an in-depth radio/video interview with radio host Rafael Catana, Armando Molina stated that mayor Montes de Oca suggested to Valle de Bravo's inhabitants to be polite with the hippie crowd as they felt being overwhelmed by the excessive numbers of them. In the end, not a single Valle de Bravo inhabitant complained about the hippies. Cancellation of the auto race Early Saturday morning it was decided, as stated by Alfonso Lopez Negrete, in an on-site interview made by a Telesistema Mexicano, to cancel the auto race due to the quantity of festival attendees which surpassed all expectations. The Circuito Avandaro auto-race was going to be suspended for decades to come since authorities tied the sport with massive crowds. The music =Pre- festival= As stated by Armando Nava, Alex Lora and De Llano in the \\"Memorias de un cierto dia: Avandaro\\" documentary, tens of thousands of jipitecas were already on-site so activities started September 9 (Thursday) with special shows and even some brief concerts some bands like El Amor, Dug Dug's and Three Souls in my Mind offered while at the same time doing their sound-check for Saturday. By Saturday 11 at 6AM, hundreds of thousands of attendees were already on-site so Molina and De Llano decided to formally start the festival with a \\"Pre-festival\\". The acts which performed were: *Carlos Baca (Yoga session and ecology lecture) *Eduardo Ruiz Savi√±√≥n and UNAM's experimental theater troupe with Carlos Steward. (Performed The Who's \\"Tommy\\" rock opera) *La Ley de Herodes (band of the famous Arau family.) *Zafiro *La Sociedad Anonima *Los Soul Masters *La Fachada de Piedra with Larry Sanchez (39.4) =Festival= La Fachada de Piedra concluded their act at approx. 5pm. After a brief pause the festival resumed as follows: *Los Dug Dug's *El Epilogo *La Divisi√≥n del Norte *Tequila *Peace & Love *El Ritual *Bandido *Los Yaki with Mayita Campos *Tinta Blanca *El Amor *Three Souls in my Mind At around Sunday 9am, Three Souls in my Mind finished their act and the massive exodus started. Festival development As stated by Armando Molina in the official soundtrack (narration part) and by his then assistant Jaime Almeida, the whole festival was held in peace with the only problem being that the attendees destroyed the barricade and invaded reserved areas of the light towers and even the stage. In the official soundtrack desperate calls for order from Molina's assistant Roberto Naranjo and band members from Dug Dug's, El Epilogo, and Peace and Love can be heard. At one point, an attendee fainted and Tequila's world-class Mexican-American singer, Maricela Durazo, ordered the crowd to take good care and protect her. As many thousands of jipitecas were on-site since Friday 10, co-organizer Luis de Llano stated the famous phrase: \\"They survived for three days sharing rain and mud; that was in attempt to have an identity.\\" Francisco Martinez Gallardo, chief of the medical team and voluntaries of the improvised in-site hospital stated: \\"There was one case of acute appendicitis, 20 intoxicated with pills, 50 with marijuana, 5 with alcoholic congestion, 5 cases of gastroenteritis and some with wounded heads, ankle fractures and burns.\\" Exodus President Luis Echeverria agreed to send 300 buses to pick up some of the attendees. The news were cheered with a rarely seen approval for a Mexican president from his country's youth. As one of the organizers yelled, with heavy use of slangs, through the audio system: \\"Lets cheer up Luis Echeverria, who is gonna send 300 buses of 50 seats each so we can go back...is a good guy that fella\\" (un aplauso para Luis Echeverr√≠a que nos va a mandar 300 camiones de 50 pasajeros para el regreso ... a todo dar el chavo ese). As can be seen in the Gurrola film, thousands upon thousands of hippies were walking from the site and many of them were overwhelming the buses. Aftermath: Avandarazo and controversies As can be heard in the soundtrack, the band Peace and Love performed the songs \\"Marihuana\\" and \\"We got the power,\\" that were considered controversial to Mexican society. At the same time, Peace and Love front-man Ricardo Ochoa used some foul language in order to cheer up the crowd, echoing what Country Joe McDonald did at Woodstock. Since the festival was being broadcast live through Radio Juventud and relay stations all over the country, some segments of society took this as a direct threat to the establishment (\\"Marihuana\\" for advocating open drug-use and \\"We got the power\\" for wrongly associating it with a possible popular uprising). The possible association of jipitecas with subversive and radical political movements is what caused the so-called Avandarazo. In the aftermath of the post-festival turmoil, several interviewed Avandaro attendees declared that the whole festival was held in peace and not a single major accident happened but Moya Palencia, then Secretary of the Interior, accused the organizers of acting with intent and Carlos Hank Gonz√°lez, then governor of the State of Mexico, condemned the festival's organizers and in his own defense stated that \\"They were given permission to perform a sporting event, but instead presented a rock festival\\" but, as stated by Armando Fuentes Aguirre Caton, his political opponents took this as an opportunity to destroy his presidential aspirations. Opinions from the world of politics, religion and academia were deeply divided. While influential university professors and La Onda writers such as Parm√©nides Garc√≠a and Jos√© Agust√≠n, mostly gave the festival a positive review, and some intellectuals like Paco Ignacio Taibo I, Elena Poniatowska (herself an attendee), Octavio Paz and Jos√© Emilio Pacheco gave a fairly positive evaluation too, others criticized it negatively like Roberto Blanco Moheno and Eduardo \\"Rius\\" del Rio. Writer and political activist Carlos Monsiv√°is initially gave the festival a negative review but changed his mind soon afterwards. As Guadalajara Cardinal Jos√© Garibi y Rivera condemned it, popular liberal priest and festival attendee Enrique Marroquin praised it, publishing in Piedra Rodante a controversial article in its defense called \\"God wants the rain so we can unite.\\" There was also a notable incident at La Profesa, when during mass in homage to Mexico's Independence figure Agustin de Iturbide, a group of about 250 individuals belonging to a conservative civil movement left the building in protest as mass was being served by Monsignor Rafael Vazquez Corona, a strong supporter of the festival. Monsignor Vazquez Corona was then heavily criticized by then rector of the University of Guadalajara, Dr. Garibay Guti√©rrez, in his 1972 book about the festival \\"El gran desafio: Volver a pensar\\". Union leader Fidel Velazquez simply called the festival \\"a Bacchanalia\\", Attorney General Ojeda Paullada labelled it as a \\"witches' Sabbath\\" and President of the Senate, Enrique Olivares Santana, yelled in a press conference: \\"Let there be no more Avandaros in the republic!\\". Finally and under pressure, president Luis Echeverr√≠a made a strong statement against the festival, saying: \\"While we regret and condemn the phenomenon of Av√°ndaro, it also encourages us in our belief that only a small part of our youth are in favor of such acts and entertainment.\\" President Echeverria then proceeded to crack down La Onda. Some early 1970s hit-songs like \\"Avandaro\\" from Rosario, \\"Seguir al sol\\" by Pajaro Alberto and others which commemorated the event, were banned from radio air play, Radio Juventud DJs F√©lix Ruano Mendez, Jaime Marin and Agust√≠n Meza de la Pe√±a were temporarily suspended but, contrary to popular belief, they were not terminated. On the other hand, the influential Piedra Rodante magazine was indeed terminated in early 1972 and festival co- organizer Justino Compean left the country for a while. The band Tinta Blanca and other rock musicians tried unsuccessfully to hold a meeting with president Echeverria with a famous protest outside Los Pinos. After a short time the protest was peacefully dissolved. Films and TV =Short films= *Avandaro. A 1971 Super 8 short film of approximately 20 minutes of footage with live soundtrack, produced by Luis Guti√©rrez y Prieto and directed/edited by Alfredo Gurrola. Photographers were awarded-filmmakers H√©ctor Abadie, David Celestinos and Sergio Garcia Michel. Facing government pressure in the aftermath of the festival, the film was briefly screened in selected theaters, cultural centers and international Super 8 film festivals only. By the end of the 1970s, the film was acquired by Cablevision thanks to the efforts of Guti√©rrez y Prieto. As stated in Garcia Michel essay Toward a fourth cinema: \\"Apart from the technical achievements, Luis always sympathized with this Movement, sponsoring films such as Av√°ndaro, Pasiones [Passions] and La lucha [The Struggle]; the first two were transferred from super-8 to videotape and belong to Cablevisi√≥n.\\" In 2006, the company Video Grupo Empresarial included it as a DVD-extra in the release of the 1983 Sergio Garcia film Three Souls in my mind: Una larga experiencia. *Tinta Blanca en Av√°ndaro. 16mm short film produced by Raul Candiani and directed by the band's manager, Humberto Rubalcaba Zuleta, about the band's participation in the festival.

Curiosities =La encuerada de Avandaro= In spite the spirit of the age and that many people were completely naked swimming in the lake, walking in the middle of the crowd or even on stage without a problem as can be seen in the film, one woman, as the band La Division del Norte was playing, performed a striptease and caught the attention of the cameras. Her strip-tease was captured in the Gurrola film and shots of her appeared in many other media. When the footage and pictures were shown, the public baptized the woman as La encuerada(the naked woman). The woman was interviewed on-site by Elena Poniatowska; however, another interview, thought to have been real for decades, was published in the rock magazine Piedra Rodante in late 1971. In 2001, a bitter dispute between the owner of the magazine Manuel Aceves and then collaborator and music critic Oscar Sarquiz about the veracity of the interview took place in La Jornada newspaper. Finally, it was confirmed by Federico Rubli and further explained in the TV Azteca documentary that the interview was completely bogus. A few years after the festival the band Three Souls in my Mind composed a song called La encuerada de Avandaro which would become a hit in the underground movement. =The lost Telesistema Mexicano videotapes= Shot by Telesistema Mexicano cameramen under direction of Carlos Alazraki, those tapes were destined to become part of the planned TV special but were confiscated by their own company as soon as Luis de Llano showed up for work. Some footage of these tapes has been released since 1971 in movies and documentaries. In a 2001 interview, Luis de Llano recalled this situation and stated that may he find the tapes he will produce a movie with them though it is widely believed that they were sent to a storage in Tijuana, and that years later the whole place burnt out. He also made clear that, contrary to popular belief, the Secretariat of the Interior did not confiscate the tapes. An independent investigation, as shown in the Las glorias de Avandaro documentary, made as a request through the Federal Institute of access to information (IFAI) produced the official document proving that, indeed, the government did not confiscate the tapes. =Booked acts who failed to show up= *Love Army - As stated by the former band singer Pajaro Alberto in the Glorias de Avandaro documentary, the band suffered a minor car accident while on the road from Mexico City to Avandaro. *La Tribu - As stated by Armando Molina in the live soundtrack, La Tribu cancelled at the very last minute but their record company, Polydor, sent La Division del Norte in their place. =Acts who declined to participate= *La Revolucion de Emiliano Zapata: As stated by member Javier Martin del Campo in the fair use trailer for Bajo el sol y frente a Dios documentary, the band was already booked for September 11 to appear in Monterrey. As the band was heading north, they saw thousands of fans going south for the festival. *Javier Batiz: As stated on the fair use TV Azteca documentary La historia detras del mito: Avandaro, he considered Molina's payment offer too low. Later, he regretted his decision and tried, together with his sister singer Baby Batiz some members of Los Locos and his girlfriend, to get to the festival but were stranded in the traffic jam and his girlfriend at the time got ill while on the road. Legacy and Official Recognition in 2019 The festival remains a controversial issue in Mexican society. After the festival, Mexican rock music was almost banned and was segregated to the so-called Hoyos Funkies, illegal gatherings in abandoned warehouses and supported mostly by the proletariat. A few years after the festival the hippie movement around the world collapsed and Mexico's La Onda was no exception, giving way to the ascension of other music genres of the mid-1970s such as Disco, Urban rock, Punk, Romantic Ballads, Heavy Metal, Progressive rock and, exclusively in the Mexican scene, the Rupestre movement championed by Rockdrigo Gonzalez. The world-class quality of the bands that participated is generally praised by critics and public alike and the festival was little by little being acknowledged by official publications from respected institutions such as INEGI and COLMEX and in November 2019, right after the death of Armando Molina, Senator Marti Batres via Twitter gave his sympathies to Molina's family members and made the announcement about the official recognition that the Senate would do to the Festival. On November 25, 2019 the Mexican Senate gave a formal recognition to different musicians who took part on the festival as well as a tribute to Molina, effectively putting an end to 48 years of Government censorship to Avandaro. The festival is often regarded as a milestone in the history of rock music, the hippie movement and post-WWII Mexican society in general. Picture gallery Photographer Pedro Meyer, himself an Avandaro attendee, produced a collection named Avandaro 1971, available online. In 2016, the Museo Universitario del Chopo in Mexico City, exhibited a collection of Avandaro photographs taken by Graciela Iturbide.

It was the only product of the Davis-Douglas Company, and was designed to make the first non-stop flight coast-to-coast across the United States. Development The Davis-Douglas Company was formed in July 1920 to enable Donald Douglas to design and build an aircraft capable of non-stop flight coast-to-coast across the United States. David R. Davis provided the financing for the company. The resulting aircraft was the Cloudster, a single-bay equal-span biplane of wooden construction. It was fabric-covered except for the forward fuselage, which was covered with sheet metal. The aircraft was powered by a 400 hp (298 kW) Liberty V-12 piston engine. The Cloudster first flew on 24 February 1921 and attempted the coast-to-coast journey in June that year. The aircraft failed to make a non-stop journey due to engine failure. In 1923, the Cloudster was sold and modified for sightseeing flights, with two additional open cockpits and seats for five passengers replacing one of the fuel tanks. In 1925 it was again sold to T. Claude Ryan, who had it modified further by adding an enclosed cabin with ten seats.Taylor 1989, p.773 It was subsequently used by a number of operators before it made a forced landing in shallow water off the coast of Ensenada, Baja California in December 1926. It was damaged beyond repair by the tide before it could be recovered. Following the failure of the coast-to-coast flight, Davis lost interest and Douglas went on to form the Douglas Company (later the Douglas Aircraft Company) in July 1921. 1945 Cloudster II Douglas Aircraft would revive the name in 1945 for a proposed general aviation aircraft with a pusher propellor, similar to the XB-42, as the Cloudster II. \\"5 Passenger Pusher\\" , March 1947, Popular Science article with rare photosCloudster II at Aerofile.com bottom of page \\"Tail Pusher Plane Cruises 200 mph\\" , March 1947, Popular Mechanics The company's last effort in general aviation, it was not a success.

Early life and career MacCarthy was born in Macroom, County Cork, Ireland to Ted MacCarthy (died 1998) and Betty MacCarthy (died 2009). He has 11 siblings. The family had a business distributing newspapers and magazines all over Munster. However the family soon lost their business from a combination of bad health and bad luck. Despite this Ted and Betty made sure that things would still be good for their children. MacCarthy left school at 15 where he was unhappy, without an Inter Cert and became a stable boy at Vincent O'Brien's place in Ballydoyle, but after five years between Tipperary and Newmarket, Jimmy returned home to help his father whose bad heart had led to the end of the business. He then made a living out of singing at pubs, and was later busking in the streets of London and doing occasional concerts, opening for other singers' gigs in Ireland. In 1995, MacCarthy bought a house in Wicklow, which was destroyed by a recent blaze along with other recording studios (outhouses) set up by MacCarthy. MacCarthy now resides in Kilkenny in a house he bought in 2006. Between 2003 and 2008 MacCarthy took an extended hiatus from performing. Upon his return to the live scene MacCarthy played with a band consisting of Eleanor Healy (bass and vocals) and Martin Leahy (percussion and drums) to great acclaim. More recently he has performed solo at venues throughout Ireland. Since he returned to the live scene MacCarthy has been performing new songs along with all the classics. In summer 2009 he made his first nationwide tour, doing gigs at big venues such as the National Concert Hall, the Cork Opera House and Galway Town Hall. In addition MacCarthy has played smaller venues in locations of note, including Kenmare, County Kerry, the town known as \\"Neid√≠n\\", in Irish, after which he named his classic hit \\"As I Leave Behind Neid√≠n\\". Manager of the Carnegie Arts Centre, Deryn O'Callaghan has said that after remembering the town in one of his songs, Jimmy MacCarthy would have a warm welcome when playing the venue. Since 2013 MacCarthy continued to play gigs throughout the country, including small arts centres and larger venues such as the National Concert Hall in Dublin and Cork Opera House once again. Songwriting MacCarthy is best known as a songwriter. Composing since the late 1970s, his songs have been recorded by many Irish artists including Christy Moore, Mary Black, Finbar Wright, Maura O'Connell, the Corrs and Westlife. \\"Ride On\\", recorded by Christy Moore, is one of his best-known compositions. Moore also recorded MacCarthy's songs \\"Missing You\\", \\"Bright Blue Rose\\" and \\"Mystic Lipstick\\". Mary Black, Maura O'Connell and The Corrs have recorded MacCarthy's \\"No Frontiers\\", while Black has also recorded his songs \\"Katie\\", \\"Adam at the Window\\", \\"Diamond Days\\", \\"As I Leave Behind Neid√≠n\\", \\"Shuffle of the Buckled\\" and \\"Another Day.\\"*{http://www.folkworld.de/24/e/maccarthy.html} MacCarthy also co-wrote Westlife's \\"Angel's Wings.\\" This track was meant to be a Christmas single for Westlife during that year but the band chose a different song. MacCarthy believes that if Westlife had released \\"Angel's Wings\\" as a single the chances were that it could have become a number one hit and that it would have been nice to have a song at the top of the UK charts. More recently MacCarthy's songs have been recorded by newer artists such as the Celtic Tenors, Michelle Lally, Marc Roberts, and Tommy O'Sullivan. Music According to a discography site MacCarthy's music has been described as folky power-pop, but it can also be classed as folk-rock. Prior to embarking on a lengthy career as a singer/songwriter in Ireland, MacCarthy released his first single \\"Miles of Eyes\\" in 1981 under Mulligan Records. The same year a second single was put out through the same label, which was titled \\"Like in the Movies\\". This was after being in a band called \\"Southpaw\\" with Declan Sinnott in the late 1970s. A longtime fan of the Beatles, in October 1999 MacCarthy played at the National Concert Hall, Dublin as a special guest with the \\"fifth Beatle\\" George Martin. He performed a cover of the Beatles' song \\"She's Leaving Home\\". In his career MacCarthy has toured with De Dannan and worked with producers such as Donal Lunny and many more. Up to 2010, MacCarthy released four albums of his own. The Song of the Singing Horseman (1991), The Dreamer (1994), The Moment (2002) and Hey Ho Believe (2010). His debut album, The Song of the Singing Horseman has been described as having a \\"masterly blend of pop melodies, trad fiddles, Spanish guitars, country-and-western rhythms and chamber-music strings.\\"Jimmy MacCarthy's History MacCarthy's third album, The Moment, features co-writers on five of its tracks, including a song written with Graham Lyle (the songwriter of Tina Turner's \\"What's Love Got to Do with It?\\"). More firmly a pop-rock album than his first two recordings, the music on The Moment is predominantly guitar and keyboard based. MacCarthy's fourth album Hey Ho Believe, released on 25 October 2010 included other musicians such as Eoin O'Neill, Anto Drennan and Graham Henderson. =Tribute Albums= As of 2017 there have been two tribute albums released celebrating the work of Jimmy MacCarthy, the first was a collection by popular artists that have recorded his songs and the second was by his long time friend Mary Black. Warmer for the Spark In 1998 MacCarthy released an album together with Tommy Fleming, Frances Black, Mary Black, Christy Moore, Maura O Connell and Mary Coughlan which they named Warmer for the Spark; the songs of Jimmy MacCarthy Volume One. MacCarthy wrote every song on this album and sang two of his own. Mary Black Sings Jimmy MacCarthy In 2017 Mary Black released an album celebrating MacCarthy's work. This album includes the songs by MacCarthy Mary Black is known for such as 'No Frontiers', 'Katie' and 'Adam At The Window', classics never recorded by Black like 'Mystic Lipstick', a new song 'Love's Last Chance', and a live recording of Black and MacCarthy both singing 'As I Leave Behind Neidin'.

The new album Hey-Ho Believe was released on 25 October 2010 and featured a new producer Donal Lunny.

During the years between World War I and II, he participated as an expert in several conferences concerning the problems of the German reparations and the general economic situation. In 1938 he was appointed as president of the Belgian Banking Commission, where he succeeded Georges Janssen. Shortly after the outbreak of World War II, he became administrator at the Banque d'√âmission √† Bruxelles, but in 1942 he resigned from that post. At the end of the war, he was appointed governor of the National Bank of Belgium. Immediately after his appointment he had to deal with the massive currency reform, known as the Operation Gutt, which reduced the money supply in Belgium by almost two-thirds in order to stabilise the currency. The Belgian law of 28 July 1948 made provision for reinforcing the public character of the Bank, while guaranteeing its autonomy. He was involved in the organisation of the new international monetary system, following the Bretton Woods agreements. In 1946, he became chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) in Basel (Switzerland). He remained president of the BIS until 1958 after which he remained a member of the Board of Directors. In 1950, together with Hubert Ansiaux, he was involved in setting up the European Payments Union with the aim of replacing bilateral payments with a system of multilateral trade and payments.

Yerba Buena was the original name of the settlement that later became San Francisco, California. Located near the northeastern end of the San Francisco Peninsula, between the Presidio of San Francisco and the Mission San Francisco de As√≠s, it was originally intended as a trading post for ships visiting San Francisco Bay. The settlement was arranged in the Spanish style around a plaza that remains as the present day Portsmouth Square. Name The name of the town was taken from the yerba buena (Clinopodium douglasii) plant, a native herb of the West Coast of North America and abundant in the region surrounding San Francisco Bay. Franciscan missionary Pedro Font, accompanying the Juan Bautista de Anza expedition of 1775‚Äì76, applied the Spanish name to the common native herb he found abundant in the landscape. The plant's common name, yerba buena, the same in English and Spanish, is an alternate form of the Spanish hierba buena (meaning \\"good herb\\"). The earliest report of the use of Yerba Buena as a place name comes from the log of George Vancouver, who in 1792 sailed his ship into San Francisco Bay and anchored \\"about a league below the Presidio in a place they called Yerba Buena\\". History Presidio of San Francisco in Alta California, in 1817. =18th century= The Spanish Portol√° expedition, led by Don Gaspar de Portol√° arrived overland from Mexico on November 2, 1769. It was the first documented European visit by land to the San Francisco Bay Area, claiming it for Spain as part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain. A second group of soldiers, this time accompanied by settlers, arrived in June 1776, led by the Spanish explorer Juan Bautista De Anza. One of De Anza's officers, Jos√© Joaqu√≠n Moraga, was given the task of building a Spanish mission, Mission San Francisco de As√≠s (Mission Dolores) and a military fort, the Presidio of San Francisco. Moraga chose a location approximately halfway between the two sites to build housing for the workers, which became known as Yerba Buena. A supply ship arrived about two months later and the settlers began building. =19th century= In 1804 Las Californias province was split into Alta California province (upper) and Baja California province (lower), both still within the Spanish Viceroyalty of New Spain. Upon independence from Spain in 1821, the territory of Alta California became part of Mexico, but the faraway Mexican government paid little attention to Yerba Buena. Over the years the area between the port facilities at Yerba Buena Cove and the housing area of Yerba Buena filled in. The old plaza is today's Portsmouth Square. In 1835, William A. Richardson, a naturalized Mexican citizen of English birth, erected a homestead near the boat anchorage of Yerba Buena Cove. Together with Alcalde Francisco de Haro, he laid out a street plan for the expanded settlement, which retained the name Yerba Buena. In early 1841 James Douglas of the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC), operating on the Pacific coast from Fort Vancouver, went to Yerba Buena to establish an HBC trading post. A large building on the water's edge was purchased. The HBC post had several purposes. It operated as a wholesale store, selling goods exported from Fort Vancouver such as salmon, lumber, and British manufactures in exchange for hides and tallow. The post improved diplomatic relations between the British HBC and the Mexican government of California, making the HBC's fur trapping expeditions into California's Central Valley politically acceptable. Despite the mercantile potential of the HBC store in Yerba Buena, in 1842 it was ordered to be closed by George Simpson as part of Simpson's general reorganization of the HBC's Columbia District. The HBC store in Yerba Buena was sold in 1846, two years before the California Gold Rush transformed Yerba Buena into the major city on the North American west coast. On July 7, 1846, US Navy Commodore John D. Sloat, in the Battle of Yerba Buena, claimed Alta California for the United States during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, and US Navy Captain John Berrien Montgomery and US Marine Second Lieutenant Henry Bulls Watson of the arrived to claim Yerba Buena two days later by raising the American flag over the town plaza, which is now Portsmouth Square in honor of the ship. Henry Bulls Watson was placed in command of the garrison there. On July 31, 1846, Yerba Buena doubled in population when about 240 Mormon migrants from the East coast arrived on the ship Brooklyn, led by Sam Brannan. In August 1846, Lt. Washington Allon Bartlett was named alcalde of Yerba Buena. On January 30, 1847, Lt. Bartlett's proclamation changing the name Yerba Buena to San Francisco took effect. The city and the rest of Alta California officially became a United States military territory in 1848 by the terms of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which ended the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. California was admitted for statehood to the United States on September 9, 1850. The State soon chartered San Francisco as both a City and a County.

Natural Resources Police Officers patrol state-owned lands and enforce conservation and boating laws as well as Maryland's Criminal Law and Transportation Article. NRP is also the primary law enforcement agency on the waterways of Maryland and is the primary response agency for all homeland security threats on Maryland waterways. Natural Resources Police officers are the only police officers to have statewide jurisdiction, including Baltimore City. (The Maryland State Police (MSP), which is the state police and highway patrol, also has statewide jurisdiction, but have limited authority within Baltimore City). As of March 30, 2016 the force had an authorized strength of 262 sworn personnel and 78 civilian employees. Training/authority The NRP have statewide authority to enforce all laws, including the Natural Resources Article, the Criminal Law Article, and the Transportation Article. The Maryland Natural Resources Police Training Academy, the agency police academy, is located in Sykesville, Maryland at Maryland Police and Correctional Training Commission.Training Facility List, Governor's Office of Crime Control & Prevention. The Academy officially opened on March 25, 1963 as the Maryland State Marine Police Academy, with a class of eight officers. History The NRP is Maryland's oldest state law enforcement agency and fourth oldest state conservation law enforcement agency in the United States. The NRP traces its lineage to an act of the Maryland General Assembly in 1868 creating the State Oyster Police Force in order to enforce 1830 and 1865 laws regulating oyster-harvesting and conservation. This forces' responsibility was limited to enforcing the oyster laws on the Chesapeake Bay. Hunter Davidson, a former Confederate States Navy officer and U.S. Naval Academy graduate, was unanimously chosen as the first commander of the State Oyster Police Force by the State Board of Commissioners. Davidson acquired a 12-pounder Dahlgren howitzer for the force's first steamer, Leila, for use in the gun battles between the Oyster Police and the illegal dredgers. Engagement in the oyster war on the Chesapeake, 1886. During the early years the force, nicknamed the Oyster Navy, was engaged in suppressing oyster poaching by out of state boats and locals descrubed as \\"oyster pirates.\\" During thse Oyster Wars the force had a fleet, largely of schooners such as Julia Hamilton but included armed steamers. The first steamer, Leila, was replaced by two built for the purpose, Governor R. M. McLane and Governor P. F. Thomas. Governor R. M. McLane is known to have had a 12-pounder Dahlgren howitzer. Lt. Gregory Bartles of the Maryland Natural Resources Police believes that gun to have been transferred from Leila. The gun was acquired for eventual museum display by Maryland with funds from a donor matched by funds from the Department of Natural Resources Secretary. In 1874, the state created a Commission of Fisheries to study and report on the status of Maryland fisheries; the State Oyster Police Force was renamed the State Fishery Force and placed under the jurisdiction of the Commission. In 1890, the state enacted its first uniform natural resources conservation law for the protection of game birds and animals. In 1896, the General Assembly established the Office of the State Game Warden, headed by a state game warden appointed by the governor for a two-year term; Governor Lloyd Lowndes, Jr. appointed Robert H. Gilbert to the post. In 1916, the Conservation Commission was created by combining the State Fisheries Force and the Office of the State Game Warden; the General Assembly provided that the Commission could appoint the state game warden. The Commission selected as its first appointment E. Lee LeCompte of Dorchester County, who served until 1945. Shortly after the nation's entry into World War I the Navy proposed that the State Fishery Force boats and personnel be used to maintain constant local patrols. The state legislature agreed that the boats and men of the state force would become part of the U.S. Naval Reserve providing they patrol the same districts for fisheries enforcement as well as federal interests with the benefit that patrol time would be increased and the expense for all be paid by the federal government. The vessels, some in commissioned status, served into 1918 in that dual role. In 1918, the first statewide hunting license law was enacted, and in 1927, the first resident and nonresident angler's license law was enacted. In 2005, the Maryland DNR consolidated the law enforcement function of the Maryland Park Service's state park rangers (known as Maryland Rangers) into the Natural Resources Police, and many of the Maryland Rangers become NRP officers. The NRP's mission expanded to include law enforcement duties for the state's parks, forests, and other lands managed by the DNR. Maryland Park Service managers who had law enforcement responsibilities before the merger retained their law enforcement commissions and continued to be called Maryland Rangers. The park service hired non-law enforcement personnel, also to be referred to as rangers, to take over the non-law enforcement duties previously performed by the Maryland Rangers. Organization The current superintendent (chief of police) is Colonel G. Adrian Baker The DNR is divided into four regions: *Western (includes: Garrett, Allegany, Washington, and Frederick counties) *Central (includes: Montgomery, Howard, Carroll, Harford, Cecil counties, and Baltimore County and Baltimore City) *Southern (includes: Anne Arundel, Prince George's, Calvert, Charles, and St. Mary's counties) *Eastern (includes: Kent, Queen Anne's, Caroline, Talbot, Dorchester, Somerset, Wicomico, and Worcester counties) The NRP has its headquarters in the state capital, Annapolis.

Origins  Following the outbreak of World War II, German U-boats began targeting merchant and passenger vessels in 1939, prompting the U.S. Navy to review its readiness to counter this threat. At the behest of the Navy, the National Academy of Sciences established a subcommittee on submarine detection which ultimately concluded that the Navy's \\"methods had hardly progressed since 1918\\" and recommended that the Navy create programs tasked development of instruments capable of detecting and measuring underwater occurrences. In 1940, the National Defense Research Committee, by request of the Navy, established two laboratories, with one on the Atlantic coast of the U.S. and the other on the Pacific coast. The latter was established at the U.S. Naval Radio and Sound Laboratory (NRSL), located at Naval Base Point Loma, San Diego. There, the University of California Division of War Research (UCWDR) was established with the University of California (UC) as the contract agency. The creation of UCDWR marked the first collaboration between the Navy and UC on wartime research. The Navy also informally referred to UCDWR as the San Diego Laboratory. > ‚ÄúSome $12 million in research funds were granted to Scripps during the war > to undertake research in submarine acoustics.‚Äù ... ‚ÄúThe Navy also provided > funding for a series of important Scripps expeditions to the Pacific, > including several linked to Pacific atomic tests.‚Äù (Benson 530)Benson, Keith > Rodney (ed.), Philip F. Rehbock (ed.). Oceanographic History: The Pacific > and Beyond. Seattle:University of Washington Press. 2002.  Personnel  Dr. Vern Knudsen, an acoustical physicist, came from UCLA to become the first leader of UCDWR. UCDWR recruited most of its staff from universities and colleges, as well as industrial and technical groups. Because of the initial general lack of knowledge of the context in which the staff would be applying their skills to, a large portion of the beginning was spent training them. Additionally, several people involved with the film industry were recruited from Hollywood, given that they were among the few who were familiar with electrical recording and projecting of sound; some of these people would be involved in the development of sonar.  Research  From 1942-1943, UCDWR was mainly focused on researching methods of detecting submerged submarines acoustically in order to rectify the Navy's inability to effectively employ its sonar equipment. While the Navy did have sonar schools, it was limited to teaching seamen how to operate and maintain their sonar equipment. Knowledge of marine factors affecting the underwater transmission of sound was not deeply explored. Together with NRSL, UCDWR conducted research and experiments exploring how currents, organisms, water temperature, salinity, depth, and the sea floor affected noise. The joint efforts of NRSL and UCDWR created an oceanographic scientific field that added to the Navy's ability to accurately detect sounds underwater, as well as measure listening ranges.  Technology Development  = Sound Beacons = Besides making gains in a research capacity, UCDWR was also responsible for developing devices for the submariners. The more successful projects involved the development of various sound beacons, which were used by submarine crews to prevent enemy anti-submarine vessels from tracking them. The NAC,NAG, NAH, and NAD (which were improvements from their respective predecessors) were designed to be released by submarines and remain stationary in the water while transmitting a signal at the same frequency of the enemy vessel, effectively jamming its sonar. Then followed a series of devices which were true decoys rather than jammers. The NAD-3 was one such device; instead of floating at a preset depth, it would be driven by a propeller and could follow a preset series of turns to simulate a submarine acoustically. = Sonar = In 1944, UCDWR completed a working sonar system called QLA, which was an evolution of an earlier project called Ethoscope. QLA was the first sonar to visually plot multiple contacts on a screen. This capability was used to great effect in offensive operations late in the war when Navy submarines safely navigated the minefields guarding the Kuriles and the Strait of Tsushima by plotting the locations of the mines; the submarines infiltrated Japanese shipping lanes and sank 100,000 tons in June 1945 alone.  Postwar  After World War II ended in 1945, UCDWR came under the Naval Electronics Laboratory's authority. In June 1946, UCDWR formally became the Marine Physical Laboratory and was subsequently absorbed into the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in April 1948.

It was discovered on 26 November 1975, by astronomers at the Purple Mountain Observatory in Nanking, China. The dark D-type asteroid is one of the 50 largest Jupiter trojans and has a rotation period of 8.18 hours. It was named after Neoptolemus from Greek mythology.  Orbit and classification  Neoptolemus is a dark Jovian asteroid orbiting in the leading Greek camp at Jupiter's Lagrangian point, 60¬∞ ahead of its orbit in a 1:1 resonance (see Trojans in astronomy). It is also a non-family asteroid in the Jovian background population. This asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 5.0‚Äì5.4 AU once every 11 years and 10 months (4,326 days; semi-major axis of 5.2 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.04 and an inclination of 18¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with its first observation as ' at McDonald Observatory in December 1951, almost 24 years prior to its official discovery observation at Nanking.  Physical characteristics  In the SDSS-based taxonomy, Neoptolemus is a dark D-type asteroid. It has also been characterized as a D-type by the survey conducted by Pan-STARRS, while in the Tholen classification the body's spectral type is ambiguous, closest to a D-type and somewhat similar to a T-type asteroid, with a spectrum flagged as unusual and moderately noisy (DTU:). = Rotation period = In August 1995, and in March 2002, two rotational lightcurves of Neoptolemus were obtained from photometric observations by Italian astronomer Stefano Mottola using the Bochum 0.61-metre Telescope at La Silla Observatory, Chile, and the 1.52-meter Loiano Telescope at the Observatory of Bologna, Italy, respectively. Lightcurve analysis gave a well-defined rotation period of 8.180 hours and a brightness variation of 0.20 and 0.32 magnitude, respectively (). Follow-up observation by Robert Stephens at the Center for Solar System Studies in 2015, and 2016, gave a concurring period of 8.18 and 8.199 hours with a corresponding amplitude of 0.14 and 0.03 magnitude (). = Diameter and albedo = According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Neoptolemus measures between 71.65 and 81.28 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.051 and 0.0650. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link adopts the results obtained by IRAS, that is, an albedo of 0.0650 and a diameter of 71.65 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 9.31.  Naming  This minor planet was named from Greek mythology after the Greek warrior Neoptolemus, son of Achilles and Deidameia, who was brought to Troy by Odysseus in the last year of the Trojan War. Neoptolemus was one of the Greeks who were hiding in the wooden Trojan Horse. He brutally killed King Priam and several other princes during the destruction of the city of Troy.

The castle is a twin palace of Qasr al-Hayr al-Sharqi, built by the Umayyad caliph Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik in 727 CE. It was built in the Byzantine architectural style. Description Ruins of Qasr al-Hayr al-Gharbi (1950s) Qasr al-Hayr al-Gharbi is one of a number of desert castles in the Syrian/Jordanian region. The site originally consisted of a palace complex, a bath house, industrial buildings for the production of olive oil, an irrigated garden and another building which scholars suggest may have been a caravanserai. Over the entrance is an inscription which declares that the it was built by Hisham in the year 727, a claim that is borne out by the architectural style.Fowden, G., Qusayr 'Amra: Art and the Umayyad Elite in Late Antique Syria, University of California Press, 2004 p. 157 It was used as an eye of the king during the Umayyad era, to control the movement of the desert tribes and to act as a barrier against marauding tribes, as well as serving a hunting lodge. It is one of the most luxurious examples of a desert palace.Petersen, A., Dictionary of Islamic Architecture, Routledge, 2002 , p. 238 Later it was utilized by the Ayyubids and the Mamelukes but was abandoned permanently after the Mongol invasions. The castle is quadrangular in outline with 70-meter sides. The central doorway to the castle is very attractive, and has been moved to the National Museum of Damascus to be used as the entrance. Its semi-cylindrical towers on the sides of the doorway, columns, and the geometric shapes mirrored a blend of Persian, Byzantine and Arab architecture.Brend, B., Islamic Art, Harvard University Press, 1991, pp 24-26 Little of the original castle remains; however the reservoir to collect water from Harbaka dam, a bath and a khan are still visible.

Background A week after the very bloody Battle of Albuera, Marshal Nicolas Soult sent Latour-Maubourg's cavalry to discover the position of Marshal William Carr Beresford's Allied army. On 25 May, the French cavalry came upon a line of Portuguese cavalry vedettes on a ridge behind the village of Usagre. Lumley posted the bulk of his forces behind the ridge, out of sight. Forces Lumley force included Colonel George de Grey's brigade (3rd Prince of Wales Dragoon Guards, 4th Queen's Own Dragoons), the 13th Light Dragoons under Lieutenant-Colonel Joseph Muter, Portuguese cavalry under Colonel Loftus William Otway (1st and 7th Dragoons, plus elements of the 5th and 8th) and some Spanish cavalry led by Penne Villemur. There were 980 British, 1,000 Portuguese and 300 Spanish troopers present, plus Lefebvre's Troop, Royal Horse Artillery.Oman, p. 107 Latour-Maubourg led two dragoon brigades under Brigadier-General Bron (4th, 20th and 26th Dragoons) and Brigadier-General Bouvier des √âclaz (14th, 17th and 27th Dragoons). He sent four regiments of light cavalry under Brigadier-General Briche on a wide flanking manoeuvre. The French had about 3,500 horsemen. Confident in his numerical superiority, Latour-Maubourg pressed ahead. Battle Lumley ignored the French flanking force because he knew that they would not arrive in time. He let the 4th and 20th Dragoons of Bron's brigade pass through Usagre, cross the bridge and form up on the other side. As the 26th Dragoons began crossing the span, Lumley attacked. He brought up his cavalry and sent six British squadrons, supported by six Portuguese squadrons on their right, against the two deployed French regiments. The French horsemen were defeated and thrown back on the 26th Dragoons, who were still jammed on the bridge. With the British cavalry all around them and their retreat blocked, the French dragoons were cut to pieces. Latour-Maubourg's only recourse was to dismount the first regiment of Bouvier des Eclat's brigade and use the dragoons to hold the houses near the bridge. At last, the remnants of Bron's regiments fought their way back, covered by carbine fire from the village. Results The French lost 250 killed or wounded, plus 78 captured, mostly from the 4th and 20th Dragoons. The British only lost 20 troopers killed or wounded.Smith, p 364 References * ; * Glover, Michael. The Peninsular War 1807‚Äì1814. London: Penguin, 2001. * Oman, Charles.

He also made 3 appearances for Munster A. =Suntory Sungoliath= Following the conclusion of the 2019 NRL season, Chambers was honoured at the club's annual awards night as one of the departing players, confirming rumours that he would be leaving the NRL. Chambers would later be unveiled by Suntory Sungoliath, who also had former Queensland Reds Sam Talakai, Hendrik Tui & Samu Kerevi on their roster. Return to rugby league He re-joined the Melbourne Storm in 2012, and played his first game on 25 March 2012 against the Sydney Roosters, in which he scored a try. A successful return was exclaimed by scoring a hat- trick against The Warriors. By being part of the 2012 NRL Grand Final winning team, Chambers joined Peter Ryan, Brad Thorn and Sonny Bill Williams in winning both NRL and Super Rugby titles (though he did not play in the Super Rugby final). Chambers won his in consecutive years after winning with the Queensland Reds in 2011. In 2013, he played in Melbourne's World Club Challenge victory over Leeds. Chambers was called into the Queensland team for the 2014 State of Origin series as 18th man for the first two games. However, with Brent Tate being injured in game two, it left vacant the wing position for Chambers to make his Origin debut at Suncorp Stadium in Game Three. In the 2015 pre season, Chambers captained the Melbourne Storm at the NRL Auckland Nines. He was also selected for the Indigenous All Stars in the 2015 All Stars match at the. Gold Coast. After a great start to the 2015 NRL season, Chambers became the 800th Australian Kangaroo. He made his test debut in the centres against New Zealand Kiwis in the 2015 Anzac Test at Suncorp Stadium. In the 2016 NRL season, Chambers was part of the Melbourne side which won the Minor Premiership and reached the grand final against Cronulla-Sutherland but were defeated 14-12 at ANZ Stadium with Chambers scoring a try in the second half of the match. In the 2017 NRL season, Melbourne again won the Minor Premiership and reached the grand final against North Queensland where they won the match 34-6 at ANZ Stadium. In the 2018 NRL season, Melbourne finished second on the table and reached the 2018 NRL Grand Final against the Sydney Roosters. Melbourne were defeated 21-6 in the final and Chambers was involved in an incident with Roosters player Latrell Mitchell during the match where Chambers was tackled into touch and then pushed into the advertising board by Mitchell. This was a culmination of a rivalry between the two players which had started earlier in the year during the 2018 State of Origin series. In the 2019 NRL season, Melbourne won the Minor Premiership after a dominant season but were defeated by the Sydney Roosters at the Sydney Cricket Ground. This would be Chambers final game for Melbourne.

It was discovered on 14 April 1980, by American astronomer Edward Bowell at the Anderson Mesa Station near Flagstaff, Arizona, in the United States, and later named after Idomeneus from Greek mythology. The D-type asteroid from the Jovian background population belongs to the 80 largest Jupiter trojans. It is a suspected binary system and potentially a slow rotator with a rotation period of 479 hours.  Orbit and classification  Idomeneus is a dark Jovian asteroid orbiting in the leading Greek camp at Jupiter's Lagrangian point, 60¬∞ ahead of the Gas Giant's orbit in a 1:1 resonance . It is also a non-family asteroid in the Jovian background population. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 4.8‚Äì5.5 AU once every 11 years and 10 months (4,313 days; semi-major axis of 5.19 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.07 and an inclination of 22¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with a precovery taken at Palomar Observatory in April 1954, or 26 years prior to its official discovery observation at Anderson Mesa.  Physical characteristics  In the SDSS-based taxonomy, Idomeneus is a D-type asteroid. Pan-STARRS' survey has also characterized it as a dark D-type, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link (CALL) assumes it to be a C-type. Its V‚ÄìI color index of 0.91, however, is typical for most larger D-type Jupiter trojans. = Rotation period = In May 1991, a rotational lightcurve of Idomeneus was obtained from photometric observations by Stefano Mottola using the now decommissioned ESO 1-metre telescope at La Silla Observatory in Chile, with follow-up observation made in June 1992 and in November 2010. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period between 32.38 and 32.4 hours with a brightness amplitude between 0.22 and 0.27 magnitude (). = Suspected binary and slow rotator = In June 2016, observation by Brian Warner at the Palmer Divide Station at the Center for Solar System Studies in California, gave an exceptionally long period hours and an amplitude of magnitude (), which makes it a slow rotator. The observations also indicated that Idomeneus is a binary asteroid with a minor- planet moon in its orbit. The satellite's orbital period is hours, or alternatively, hours with a brightness variation of 0.14 magnitude. However, the results are tentative and have not been published in any journal as of 2018. = Diameter and albedo = According to the surveys carried out by the Japanese Akari satellite, the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Idomeneus measures between 52.55 and 61.01 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.0571 and 0.078. CALL derives an albedo of 0.0521 and a diameter of 60.95 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 9.9.  Naming  This minor planet was named after the Greek hero Idomeneus, who led the Cretan armies to the Trojan War and where he slew many Trojans.

Biography Born on May 9, 1825, in England, he went to the U.S. in 1832 with his parents, who settled in Pennsylvania. He graduated at the Central High School in Philadelphia in 1845, standing first in his class. While a student, he had shown interest in scientific work, and had assisted Alexander D. Bache in his observations of the magnetic elements at Girard College. Upon his graduation in 1845, he began his career as clerk to Bache who was superindentent of the United States Coast Survey. From 1846 to 1850, Davidson was occupied in geodetic field work, and in astronomy, serving in the different states on the east coast of the United States. In 1850, he went to California under the auspices of the Coast Survey, and was for several years engaged in the determination of the latitude and longitude of prominent capes, bays, etc., and of the magnetic elements of the Pacific Coast, reporting also upon the proper locations for lighthouses. His work included a survey of Washington and Puget sounds, and he had charge of the main triangulation of the coast in the region of San Francisco. In 1853, he named a number of mountains in the Olympic Mountains: he named Mount Ellinor for Ellinor Fauntleroy, who later became his wife, Mount Constance for Ellinor's older sister and The Brothers for her two brothers. From 1861 until 1867, he was again on the Atlantic seaboard, principally engaged in engineering work on coast and river defences. At one time, he was in command of the Coast Survey steamer ‚ÄúVixen,‚Äù and later performed astronomical work along the eastern coast. In 1866, he became chief engineer of an expedition for the survey of a ship canal across the Isthmus of Darien. In 1867, he was appointed to make a special examination and report upon the geography and resources of Alaska, pending its purchase; his published report and conferences with congressional committees influenced the passage of the bill. He was placed in charge, during 1867, of the work of the Coast Survey on the Pacific, planned work for the land parties from 1868 until 1875, and inspected all the fields of work. He traveled extensively in Egypt, China, India and Europe, for purposes of scientific study. From 1876 to 1886, he had charge of the main triangulation and astronomical work on the west coast; the records of the computing division showed that the results of his observations stood higher than any ever executed in America, Europe, or India, and they were characterized as ‚Äúunique in the history of geodesy.‚Äù In 1881, Davidson twice measured the Yolo base line, one of the geodesic base lines that formed the foundation of triangulating distances in California. At that time, it was the longest base line yet attempted in trigonometrical operations, and the system of triangulation directly connected therewith was called in his honor the ‚ÄúDavidson quadrilaterals.‚Äù He also measured the Los Angeles base line three times in 1888-1889. He retired from the Coast Survey in 1895, after 50 years of service. He founded the Davidson Observatory in San Francisco, which was the first astronomical observatory on the Pacific coast of North America, and in 1869 brought the Pacific geodetic of the coast survey in telegraphic longitude connection with Greenwich. His astronomical work includes the observation of the total solar eclipse under the 60th parallel, in 1869; determination of the 120th meridian, in 1873; charge of the U. S. transit of Venus expedition, in 1874; recovery of the transit of Venus station of 1709 in Lower California occupied by Auteroche de la Chappe; observation of the total solar eclipse of January 7, 1880; and in 1882 charge of the party to observe the transit of Venus in New Mexico. Portrait of George Davidson by Carleton Watkins Other positions held by Davidson include president of the California Academy of Sciences from 1871 to 1887, Honorary Professor of Geodesy and Astronomy, and Regent of the University of California from 1877 to 1885. After his retirement from the Coast Survey, he became the first professor of geography at the University of California, Berkeley, and chaired that department from 1898 until his retirement in 1905, and remained an emeritus professor until his death.Geography at Berkeley: Department History , University of California, Berkeley Davidson was one of 182 charter members of the Sierra Club in 1892 and served as a member of its board of directors from 1894 to 1910.

It includes species from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and all U.S. territories. The birds of the continental United States most closely resemble those of Eurasia, which was connected to the continent as part of the supercontinent Laurasia until around 60 million years ago. Many groups occur throughout the Northern Hemisphere and worldwide. However some groups unique to the New World have also arisen; those represented in this list are the hummingbirds, the New World vultures, the New World quail, the tyrant flycatchers, the vireos, the mimids, the New World warblers, the tanagers, the cardinals, and the icterids. Several common birds in the United States, such as the house sparrow, the rock pigeon, the European starling, and the mute swan are introduced species, meaning that they are not native to this continent but were brought here by humans. Introduced species are marked on this list as (I). In addition, many non-native species which have individual escapees or small feral populations in North America are not on this list. This is especially true of birds that are commonly held as pets, such as parrots and finches. The status of one bird on this list, the ivory- billed woodpecker, is controversial. Until 2005 this bird was widely considered to be extinct. In April of that year it was reported that at least one adult male bird had been sighted in the Cache River National Wildlife Refuge in Arkansas. This report, however, has not been universally accepted and the American Birding Association still lists the ivory-billed woodpecker as extinct.

F., T. S. Schulenberg, M. J. Iliff, S. M. Billerman, T. A. Fredericks, B. L. Sullivan, and C. L. Wood. 2019. The eBird/Clements Checklist of Birds of the World: v2019. Downloaded from http://www.birds.cornell.edu/clementschecklist/download/ Retrieved August 15, 2019 Unless otherwise noted, the species listed here are considered to occur regularly in the United States as permanent residents, summer or winter residents or visitors, or annual migrants. The following tags are used to designate some species: *(A) Accidental - occurrence based on one or two (rarely more) records and unlikely to occur regularly *(C) Casual - occurrence based on two or a few records, with subsequent records not improbable *(E) Extinct - a species which no long exists *(Ex) Extirpated - a species which no longer occurs in the United States, but other populations still exist elsewhere *(I) Introduced - a species established solely as result of direct or indirect human intervention; synonymous with non-native and non-indigenous *(EH) Endemic to Hawaii - a native species found only in Hawaii *(EG) Endemic to Guam - a native species found only in Guam *(ENM) Endemic to the Northern Mariana Islands - a native species found only in the Northern Mariana Islands *(EP) Endemic to Puerto Rico - a native species found only in Puerto Rico *(EU) Endemic to the U.S. Minor Outlying Islands - a native species found only in the U.S. Minor Outlying Islands *(EM) Endemic to the mainland - a native species found only in the 48 contiguous states and their adjacent islands (There are no birds endemic to Alaska) The (A) and (C) tags correspond to the codes 5 and 4 respectively of the American Birding Association.The ABA Checklist Version 8.0.1 (11/23/17) http://listing.aba.org/aba-checklist/ retrieved 28 November 2017 The (E), (Ex), and (I) tags describe species' status according to the AOS. The (EH) tags follow the AOS list and the (EM) tags are based on the Clements taxonomy. Population status symbols are those of the Red List published by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Version 2019-3 . Accessed 9 December 2019 The symbols apply to the species' worldwide status, not their status solely in the United States except for endemic species. The symbols and their meanings, in increasing order of peril, are: = least concern = near threatened = vulnerable = endangered = critically endangered = extinct in the wild = extinct By the numbers This list contains 1120 species found in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Of these 1120 species, 152 are tagged as accidental, 101 as casual, and 54 as introduced. Thirty-three are known to be extinct and one, the thick-billed parrot, has been extirpated though a population remains in Mexico. Thirty-three living species are endemic to Hawaii; an additional 28 former Hawaiian endemics are known to be extinct and a few others are thought to be. Fifteen species are endemic to the 48 contiguous states. There are an additional 150 species whose presence in the United States is only within one or more U.S. territories; some of those species have become extinct. The total number of bird species on this list is 1271 (i.e. the 1121 bird species found in the 50 states and District of Columbia, plus the 150 species found only in the U.S. territories). Some of the species found in the 50 states and District of Columbia are also found in the U.S. territories. Ducks, geese, and waterfowl Trumpeter swan Wood duck pair Falcated duck Common eider Order: AnseriformesFamily: Anatidae Anatidae includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl, such as geese and swans.

The most typical family members occupy dense vegetation in damp environments near lakes, swamps, or rivers. In general they are shy and secretive birds, making them difficult to observe. Most species have strong legs and long toes which are well adapted to soft uneven surfaces. They tend to have short, rounded wings and to be weak fliers. *Paint-billed crake, Neocrex erythrops (A) *Spotted rail, Pardirallus maculatus (A) *Rufous-necked wood-rail, Aramides axillaris (A) *Ridgway's rail, Rallus obsoletus *Clapper rail, Rallus crepitans *King rail, Rallus elegans *Virginia rail, Rallus limicola *Corn crake, Crex crex (C) *Sora, Porzana carolina *Common gallinule, Gallinula galeata *Eurasian moorhen, Gallinula chloropus (Guam, Northern Mariana Islands) *Eurasian coot, Fulica atra (A) *Hawaiian coot, Fulica alai (EH) *American coot, Fulica americana *Purple gallinule, Porphyrio martinicus *Purple swamphen, Porphyrio porphyrio (I) *Black-backed swamphen, Porphyrio indicus (American Samoa) (No IUCN status) *Australasian swamphen, Porphyrio melanotus (American Samoa) (IUCN status unknown) *White-browed crake, Amaurornis cinerea (Extirpated from Guam) *Yellow rail, Coturnicops noveboracensis *Yellow-breasted crake, Hapalocrex flaviventer (Puerto Rico) *Black rail, Laterallus jamaicensis *Buff-banded rail, Gallirallus philippensis (American Samoa) *Guam rail, Gallirallus owstoni (Guam, Northern Mariana Islands) (EG / ENM) *Wake Island rail, Gallirallus wakensis (U.S. Minor Outlying Islands ‚Äî Wake Island) (EU) (E) *Laysan rail, Zapornia palmeri (EH) (E) *Hawaiian rail, Zapornia sandwichensis (EH) (E) *Spotless crake, Zapornia tabuensis (American Samoa) Finfoots Order: GruiformesFamily: Heliornithidae Finfoots resemble rails; they have long necks, slender bodies, broad tails, and sharp, pointed bills. Their legs and feet are brightly colored. The family has three species and only the sungrebe is found in the New World. *Sungrebe, Heliornis fulica (A) Limpkin Limpkin Order: GruiformesFamily: Aramidae The limpkin is an odd bird that looks like a large rail, but is skeletally closer to the cranes. It is found in marshes with some trees or scrub in the Caribbean, South America, and southern Florida. *Limpkin, Aramus guarauna Cranes Sandhill cranes Order: GruiformesFamily: Gruidae Cranes are large, long-legged, and long-necked birds.

The majority of these species eat small invertebrates picked out of the mud or soil. Different lengths of legs and bills enable multiple species to feed in the same habitat, particularly on the coast, without direct competition for food. *Upland sandpiper, Bartramia longicauda *Bristle-thighed curlew, Numenius tahitiensis *Whimbrel, Numenius phaeopus *Little curlew, Numenius minutus (A) *Eskimo curlew, Numenius borealis (Possibly extinct) *Long-billed curlew, Numenius americanus *Far Eastern curlew, Numenius madagascariensis (C) *Slender-billed curlew, Numenius tenuirostris (A) *Eurasian curlew, Numenius arquata (C) *Bar-tailed godwit, Limosa lapponica *Black-tailed godwit, Limosa limosa *Hudsonian godwit, Limosa haemastica *Marbled godwit, Limosa fedoa *Ruddy turnstone, Arenaria interpres *Black turnstone, Arenaria melanocephala *Great knot, Calidris tenuirostris (C) *Red knot, Calidris canutus *Surfbird, Calidris virgata *Ruff, Calidris pugnax *Broad-billed sandpiper, Limicola falcinellus (C) *Sharp-tailed sandpiper, Calidris acuminata *Stilt sandpiper, Calidris himantopus *Curlew sandpiper, Calidris ferruginea *Temminck's stint, Calidris temminckii (A) *Long-toed stint, Calidris subminuta *Spoon-billed sandpiper, Calidris pygmaea (C) *Red-necked stint, Calidris ruficollis *Sanderling, Calidris alba *Dunlin, Calidris alpina *Rock sandpiper, Calidris ptilocnemis *Purple sandpiper, Calidris maritima *Baird's sandpiper, Calidris bairdii *Little stint, Calidris minuta (C) *Least sandpiper, Calidris minutilla *White-rumped sandpiper, Calidris fuscicollis *Buff-breasted sandpiper, Calidris subruficollis *Pectoral sandpiper, Calidris melanotos *Semipalmated sandpiper, Calidris pusilla *Western sandpiper, Calidris mauri *Short-billed dowitcher, Limnodromus griseus *Long-billed dowitcher, Limnodromus scolopaceus *Jack snipe, Lymnocryptes minimus (C) *Eurasian woodcock, Scolopax rusticola (A) *American woodcock, Scolopax minor *Latham‚Äôs snipe, Gallinago hardwickii (Guam) (A) *Solitary snipe, Gallinago solitaria (A) *Pin-tailed snipe, Gallinago stenura (A) *Common snipe, Gallinago gallinago *Wilson's snipe, Gallinago delicata *Swinhoe's snipe, Gallinago megala (Guam, Northern Mariana Islands) *Terek sandpiper, Xenus cinereus *Common sandpiper, Actitis hypoleucos *Spotted sandpiper, Actitis macularius *Green sandpiper, Tringa ochropus (C) *Solitary sandpiper, Tringa solitaria *Gray-tailed tattler, Tringa brevipes *Wandering tattler, Tringa incana *Lesser yellowlegs, Tringa flavipes *Willet, Tringa semipalmata *Spotted redshank, Tringa erythropus (C) *Common greenshank, Tringa nebularia *Greater yellowlegs, Tringa melanoleuca *Common redshank, Tringa totanus (A) *Wood sandpiper, Tringa glareola *Marsh sandpiper, Tringa stagnatilis (A) *Wilson's phalarope, Phalaropus tricolor *Red-necked phalarope, Phalaropus lobatus *Red phalarope, Phalaropus fulicarius Pratincoles and coursers Order: CharadriiformesFamily: Glareolidae The pratincoles have short legs, very long pointed wings, and long forked tails. Their most unusual feature for birds classed as waders is that they typically hunt their insect prey on the wing like swallows, although they can also feed on the ground. Their short bills are an adaptation to aerial feeding. Their flight is fast and graceful like that of a swallow or a tern, with many twists and turns to pursue their prey. *Oriental pratincole, Glareola maldivarum (A) Skuas and jaegers Long-tailed jaeger Order: CharadriiformesFamily: Stercorariidae Skuas are in general medium to large birds, typically with gray or brown plumage, often with white markings on the wings. They have longish bills with hooked tips and webbed feet with sharp claws. They look like large dark gulls, but have a fleshy cere above the upper mandible.

Gulls are typically gray or white, often with black markings on the head or wings. They have stout, longish bills and webbed feet. Terns are a group of generally medium to large seabirds typically with grey or white plumage, often with black markings on the head. Most terns hunt fish by diving but some pick insects off the surface of fresh water. Terns are generally long-lived birds, with several species known to live in excess of 30 years. Skimmers are a small family of tropical tern-like birds. They have an elongated lower mandible which they use to feed by flying low over the water surface and skimming the water for small fish. *Swallow-tailed gull, Creagrus furcatus (A) *Black- legged kittiwake, Rissa tridactyla *Red-legged kittiwake, Rissa brevirostris *Ivory gull, Pagophila eburnea *Sabine's gull, Xema sabini *Bonaparte's gull, Chroicocephalus philadelphia *Silver gull, Chroicocephalus novaehollandiae (U.S. Minor Outlying Islands) (A) *Gray-hooded gull, Chroicocephalus cirrocephalus (A) *Black-headed gull, Chroicocephalus ridibundus *Little gull, Hydrocoloeus minutus *Ross's gull, Rhodostethia rosea *Laughing gull, Leucophaeus atricilla *Franklin's gull, Leucophaeus pipixcan *Belcher's gull, Larus belcheri (A) *Black-tailed gull, Larus crassirostris (C) *Heermann's gull, Larus heermanni *Mew gull, Larus canus *Ring-billed gull, Larus delawarensis *Western gull, Larus occidentalis *Yellow-footed gull, Larus livens *California gull, Larus californicus *Herring gull, Larus argentatus *Yellow-legged gull, Larus cachinnans (C) *Iceland gull, Larus glaucoides *Lesser black-backed gull, Larus fuscus *Slaty-backed gull, Larus schistisagus *Glaucous-winged gull, Larus glaucescens *Glaucous gull, Larus hyperboreus *Great black-backed gull, Larus marinus *Kelp gull, Larus dominicanus (C) *Brown noddy, Anous stolidus *Black noddy, Anous minutus *Blue-gray noddy, Anous ceruleus *White tern, Gygis alba *Sooty tern, Onychoprion fuscatus *Gray-backed tern, Onychoprion lunatus (American Samoa, Northern Mariana Islands, U.S. Minor Outlying Islands) *Bridled tern, Onychoprion anaethetus *Aleutian tern, Onychoprion aleuticus *Little tern, Sternula albifrons (C) *Least tern, Sternula antillarum *Large-billed tern, Phaetusa simplex (A) *Gull-billed tern, Gelochelidon nilotica *Caspian tern, Hydroprogne caspia *Black tern, Chlidonias niger *White-winged tern, Chlidonias leucopterus (C) *Whiskered tern, Chlidonias hybrida (A) *Roseate tern, Sterna dougallii *Black-naped tern, Sterna sumatrana (American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands) (A) *Common tern, Sterna hirundo *Arctic tern, Sterna paradisaea *Forster's tern, Sterna forsteri *Royal tern, Thalasseus maximus *Great crested tern, Thalasseus bergii (A) *Sandwich tern, Sterna sandvicensis (A) *Elegant tern, Thalasseus elegans (A) *Black skimmer, Rynchops niger (A) Tropicbirds Red-tailed tropicbird Order: PhaethontiformesFamily: Phaethontidae Tropicbirds are slender white birds of tropical oceans, with exceptionally long central tail feathers.

Corvids are above average in size among the Passeriformes, and some of the larger species show high levels of intelligence. Since about 2012, nesting fish crows have increasingly been documented in Canada along the northwest shore of Lake Ontario, so the species will probably soon no longer be considered endemic to the lower 48 U.S. states. *Canada jay, Perisoreus canadensis *Brown jay, Psilorhinus morio (C) *Green jay, Cyanocorax yncas *Pinyon jay, Gymnorhinus cyanocephalus *Steller's jay, Cyanocitta stelleri *Blue jay, Cyanocitta cristata *Florida scrub-jay, Aphelocoma coerulescens (EM) *Island scrub-jay, Aphelocoma insularis (EM) *California scrub-jay, Aphelocoma californica (Not yet assessed by the IUCN) *Woodhouse's scrub-jay, Aphelocoma woodhouseii (Not yet assessed by the IUCN) *Mexican jay, Aphelocoma wollweberi *Clark's nutcracker, Nucifraga columbiana *Black-billed magpie, Pica hudsonia *Yellow-billed magpie, Pica nuttalli (EM) *Eurasian jackdaw, Corvus monedula (C) *Mariana crow, Corvus kubaryi (Guam, Northern Mariana Islands) *American crow, Corvus brachyrhynchos *White-necked crow, Corvus leucognaphalus (U.S. Minor Outlying Islands) *Tamaulipas crow, Corvus imparatus *Fish crow, Corvus ossifragus (EM) *Hawaiian crow, Corvus hawaiiensis (EH) *Chihuahuan raven, Corvus cryptoleucus (A) *Common raven, Corvus corax Monarch flycatchers Hawaii elepaio Order: PasseriformesFamily: Monarchidae The Monarchinae are a relatively recent grouping of a number of seemingly very different birds, mostly from the Southern Hemisphere, which are more closely related than they at first appear. Many of the approximately 140 species making up the family were previously assigned to other groups, largely on the basis of general morphology or behavior. With the new insights generated by the DNA-DNA hybridisation studies of Sibley and his co-workers toward the end of the 20th century, however, it became clear that these apparently unrelated birds were all descended from a common ancestor. The Monarchinae are small to medium-sized insectivorous passerines, many of which hunt by flycatching. Five of the species listed below (three species endemic to Hawaii, one species found in American Samoa, and one species endemic to the Northern Mariana Islands) represent the group in the United States. One species, the Guam flycatcher, is extinct because of the introduced brown tree snake on Guam. *Kauai elepaio, Chasiempis sclateri (EH) *Oahu elepaio, Chasiempis ibidis (EH) *Hawaii elepaio, Chasiempis sandwichensis (EH) *Fiji shrikebill, Clytorhynchus vitiensi (American Samoa) *Tinian monarch, Monarcha takatsukasae (Northern Mariana Islands) (ENM) *Guam flycatcher, Myiagra freycineti (Guam) (EG) (E) Larks Horned lark Order: PasseriformesFamily: Alaudidae Larks are small terrestrial birds with often extravagant songs and display flights.

They mainly occur as breeding species, as the common name implies, in Europe, Asia, and to a lesser extent Africa. Most are of generally undistinguished appearance, but many have distinctive songs. *Lesser whitethroat, Sylvia curruca (A) *Wrentit, Chamaea fasciata White-eyes, yuhinas, and allies Order: PasseriformesFamily: Zosteropidae Golden white-eye The white-eyes are small passerine birds native to tropical and sub-tropical Africa, southern Asia, and Australasia. The birds of this group are mostly of undistinguished appearance, their plumage above being generally some dull color like greenish- olive, but some species have a white or bright yellow throat, breast, or lower parts, and several have buff flanks. But as indicated by their scientific name, derived from the Ancient Greek for girdle-eye, there is a conspicuous ring around the eyes of many species. They have rounded wings and strong legs. The size ranges up to 15 cm (6 inches) in length. All the species of white- eyes are sociable, forming large flocks which only separate on the approach of the breeding season. Though mainly insectivorous, they eat nectar and fruits of various kinds. *Golden white-eye, Cleptornis marchei (Northern Mariana Islands) (ENM) *Warbling white-eye, Zosterops japonicus (I) *Bridled white- eye, Zosterops conspicullatus (Northern Mariana Islands; Extirpated from Guam) (ENM) *Rota white-eye, Zosterops rotensis (Northern Mariana Islands) (ENM) Laughingthrushes Order: PasseriformesFamily: Leiothrichidae The laughingthrushes are a large family of Old World passerine birds.

In the Bohemian and cedar waxwings, these tips look like sealing wax and give the group its name. These are arboreal birds of northern forests. They live on insects in summer and berries in winter. *Bohemian waxwing, Bombycilla garrulus *Cedar waxwing, Bombycilla cedrorum Hawaiian honeyeaters The extinct Kauai oo Order: PasseriformesFamily: Mohoidae Hawaiian honeyeaters prefer to flit quickly from perch to perch in the outer foliage, stretching up or sideways or hanging upside down at need. They have a highly developed brush-tipped tongue, which is frayed and fringed with bristles which soak up liquids readily. The tongue is flicked rapidly and repeatedly into a flower, the upper mandible then compressing any liquid out when the bill is closed. All species of honeyeaters below were endemic to Hawaii, but are now extinct. The Kauai oo was the last species to survive, and was last seen in 1987. *Kauai oo, Moho braccatus (EH) *Oahu oo, Moho apicalus (EH) *Bishop's oo, Moho bishopi (EH) *Hawaii oo, Moho nobilis (EH) *Kioea, Chaetoptila angustipluma (EH) Silky-flycatchers Phainopepla Order: PasseriformesFamily: Ptiliogonatidae The silky-flycatchers are a small family of passerine birds which occur mainly in Central America.

It was discovered by American astronomer Edward Bowell at the Anderson Mesa station of the Lowell Observatory on 3 May 1981. The dark D-type asteroid has a rotation period of 10.22 hours and belongs to the 30 largest Jupiter trojans. It was named after the ancient Greek hero Automedon, the charioteer of Achilles.  Orbit and classification  Automedon is a dark Jovian asteroid orbiting in the leading Greek camp at Jupiter's Lagrangian point, 60¬∞ ahead of its orbit in a 1:1 resonance (see Trojans in astronomy). It is a non-family asteroid in the Jovian background population. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 5.0‚Äì5.2 AU once every 11 years and 6 months (4,217 days; semi-major axis of 5.11 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.03 and an inclination of 21¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with its official discovery observation at Anderson Mesa.  Physical characteristics  In the SMASS classification, Automedon is a dark D-type asteroid (first SMASS survey, Xu 1995). It is also a generically assumed C-type asteroid. = Rotation period = Three rotational lightcurves of Automedon have been obtained from photometric observations, that are all in good agreement. In June 1994, observations by Stefano Mottola using the now decommissioned Bochum 0.61-metre Telescope at ESO's La Silla Observatory in Chile gave a rotation period of 10.220 hours with a brightness variation of 0.12 magnitude (). A second lightcurve gave a period of 10.212 hours with an amplitude of 0.17 magnitude. It was measured in July 2007, by astronomers using telescopes at the Calvin College Observatory in Michigan and the Calvin- Rehoboth Robotic Observatory in New Mexico (). In June 2017, another observation by Brian Warner and Robert Stephens at the Center for Solar System Studies in California gave a period of 10.223 hours with an amplitude of 0.11 magnitude (). = Diameter and albedo = According to the surveys carried out by the Japanese Akari satellite, the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Automedon measures between 88.57 and 113.11 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.042 and 0.068. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link adopts the results obtained by IRAS, that is, an albedo of 0.0433 and a diameter of 111.01 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 8.8.  Naming  This minor planet was named after the Greek mythology hero Automedon, Greek mythology. He was the son of Dior√™s and the charioteer of Greek hero Achilles during the Trojan War. Automedon took revenge for the death of Patroclus by killing the Trojan Aretus. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 17 February 1984 ().

The club traces its roots back to 22 November 1893 establishment of Berliner Fussball Club vom Jahre 1893. BFC 93 became one of the founding clubs of the DFB (Deutscher Fussball Bund, en:German Football Association) at Leipzig in 1900. They played top flight city football in the M√§rkischer Fussball Bund from 1904‚Äì07 before slipping to lower-tier competition. History In 1918, the club merged with Berliner Normannia 08 to form Berliner Sportvereinigung Normannia vom Jahre 1893. The union was brief, however, and was undone the following year. In 1933, BFC 93 found a new partner in Berliner Sport Club Eintracht-Borussia 01 which was itself the product of a 1911 merger between Berliner Sport Club Borussia 02 and Berliner Sport Club Eintracht 01. The team then played as BSC Eintract-Borussia vom Jahre 1893 Berlin until the end of World War II when, like most other organizations in the country including sports and football clubs, it was dissolved by occupying Allied authorities. New clubs were formed soon after the war and the former membership of SC became part of Sportgruppe Nordring in 1945. SGN joined East German competition and took part in just a single season of top flight postwar play. The team briefly resumed its postwar identity in 1948 before being re-organized as Sportgemeinschaft Nordring the following year. They enjoyed some minor success over the years at the local level. The first and second teams won division titles in 1958, and the first team made appearances in two district cup finals. The club narrowly missed promotion in 1984 on goal difference and then went through a difficult period as it struggled financially. Following German reunification in 1990 the club was known as SG Nordring 1949. The team currently plays in Berlin's Kreisliga B (X). References *Gr√ºne, Hardy (2001). Vereinslexikon.

It was the eighth film produced by Pixar, and was written and directed by Brad Bird, who took over from Jan Pinkava in 2005, and produced by Brad Lewis, from an original idea from Bird, Pinkava and Jim Capobianco. The title refers to the French dish ratatouille, which is served at the end of the film and also references the animal type of the main character, a rat. The plot follows a rat named Remy, who dreams of becoming a chef and tries to achieve his goal by forming an alliance with a Parisian restaurant's garbage boy. The film stars the voices of Patton Oswalt as Remy, an anthropomorphic rat who is interested in cooking; Lou Romano as Alfredo Linguini, a young garbage boy who befriends Remy; Ian Holm as Skinner, the head chef of Auguste Gusteau's restaurant; Janeane Garofalo as Colette Tatou, a r√¥tisseur at Gusteau's restaurant and the staff's only female chef; Peter O'Toole as Anton Ego, a restaurant critic; Brian Dennehy as Django, Remy's father and leader of his clan; Peter Sohn as Emile, Remy's older brother; and Brad Garrett as Auguste Gusteau, a recently deceased chef. The development of Ratatouille began in 2000 when Pinkava wrote the original concepts of the film. In 2005, following Pinkava's departure from Pixar, Bird was approached to direct the film and revise the story. Bird and some of the film's crew members also visited Paris for inspiration. To create the food animation used in the film, the crew consulted chefs from both France and the United States. Lewis interned at Thomas Keller's The French Laundry restaurant, where Keller developed the confit byaldi, a dish used in the film. Michael Giacchino composed the Paris-inspired music for the film. Ratatouille premiered on June 22, 2007, at the Kodak Theatre in Los Angeles, California, with its general release June 29, 2007, in the United States. The film grossed $620.7 million and was a box office success. It received widespread critical acclaim for the voice acting, writing, direction, animation and Michael Giacchino's score. The film won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature and was nominated for four more, including Best Original Screenplay. It was later voted one of the 100 greatest motion pictures of the 21st century by a 2016 poll of international critics conducted by the BBC. Plot Remy is a highly intelligent and idealistic young rat with unusually acute senses of taste and smell, who dreams of becoming a chef like his idol, Auguste Gusteau. However, the rest of his colony, including his brother Emile and his father Django, are interested in food only for sustenance. One day, Remy and Emile go to retrieve seasoning for some of Remy's food only to have an encounter with the homeowner. The elderly homeowner accidentally damages her home's ceiling whilst trying to kill Remy and Emile with a shotgun, which forces the entire colony to flee to the river. Remy is separated from the clan down a split path of violent waters and eventually finds himself above the kitchen of Gusteau's restaurant in Paris. When Remy observes a young garbage boy named Alfredo Linguini attempt to fix a soup he has spilled, he recognizes that Linguini is unintentionally ruining it and fixes his mistakes. Linguini catches him in the act, but does not reveal him to Skinner, Gusteau's former sous-chef and new owner of the restaurant. Skinner confronts Linguini for tampering with the soup, but when it is served to a critic and proves to be a success, Colette Tatou, the staff's only female cook, convinces Skinner not to fire Linguini. Skinner spots Remy trying to escape, and orders Linguini to kill him, but Linguini, upon finding out Remy can understand him, decides to keep him instead. When Linguini is ordered to replicate the soup, he is helped by Remy. Skinner, having tried the soup, decides to retain Linguini. Back in Linguini's apartment the two learn to communicate and devise a plan: Remy hides under Linguini's toque at the restaurant and guides his movements like a marionette by pulling on his hair. Skinner orders Colette to teach Linguini to be a cook. Linguini starts to become successful as a cook; as his dishes guided by Remy prove to be enormously successful at the restaurant. Skinner becomes suspicious when he sees Linguini interacting with Remy in split-second encounters. He attempts to get Linguini drunk so he can reveal how Remy is connected to him, but Linguini does not reveal any information about him. Remy uncovers Skinner's discovery that Linguini is Gusteau's illegitimate son and the true owner of the restaurant, and gives the evidence to Linguini, who forces Skinner out. The restaurant thrives as Remy's recipes become popular, though as Linguini and Colette develop a relationship, Remy begins to feel left out. He reunites with Emile and the clan, but is rejected by Django over his admiration for humans. The world-renowned food critic Anton Ego, whose scathing review of the restaurant had indirectly led to Gusteau's death, announces he will give the restaurant another chance after hearing of its popularity. After a heated argument with Linguini, Remy leads his clan to raid the restaurant's pantries in retaliation, but backfires as Linguini drives them out and revokes his friendship with him. Remy is captured by Skinner, who intends to use his talents to create a line of frozen food products, but is promptly freed by Django and Emile. Linguini apologizes to Remy, having been unable to cook without him, and reveals the truth to his staff, but they all quit, feeling betrayed. Colette returns after recalling Gusteau's famous motto, \\"Anyone can cook.\\" Impressed by Remy's determination, Django and the clan offer to help, and cook under Remy's direction while Linguini waits tables. Skinner is bound, gagged, and locked in the food storage. Remy creates a variation on ratatouille and serves it to Ego, who, upon eating it, is reminded of his mother's cooking. Humbled and delighted by the dish, Ego asks to meet the chef, and Linguini and Colette wait until the other diners have left before introducing him to Remy. Ego is stunned and writes a glowing review, saying that he now finally understands Gusteau's motto, and indirectly crowning Remy as \\"nothing less than the finest chef in France.\\" The next day, the restaurant is shut down due to the presence of the rats, causing Ego to lose his job and credibility as a critic. However, taking on a new job as an investor, he now funds and frequents a popular new bistro, La Ratatouille, run by Remy, Linguini, and Colette, as the rat colony settles into their new home in the bistro's attic. Voice cast *Patton Oswalt as Remy, a rat with heightened senses of taste and smell, enabling a talent and desire for cooking. Director Brad Bird chose Oswalt after hearing his food-related comedy routine. *Lou Romano as Alfredo Linguini, the son of Auguste Gusteau and Renata Linguini, and a hapless garbage boy who befriends Remy. He is named after Alfredo Ferrari, the son of Italian automaker Enzo Ferrari. *Ian Holm as Chef Skinner, a diminutive chef and the owner of Auguste Gusteau's restaurant. Since Gusteau's death, Skinner has used the Gusteau name to market a line of cheap microwaveable meals.

His appearance was modeled after Louis Jouvet. *Brad Garrett as Auguste Gusteau, France's most famous chef, who died of a broken heart following a negative review by Anton Ego. Many reviewers believe that Gusteau is inspired by real-life chef Bernard Loiseau, who committed suicide after media speculation that his flagship restaurant, La C√¥te d'Or, was going to be downgraded from three Michelin stars to two. La C√¥te d'Or was one of the restaurants visited by Brad Bird and others in France. *Janeane Garofalo as Colette Tatou, Gusteau's r√¥tisseur. She is inspired by French chef H√©l√®ne Darroze. *Will Arnett as Horst Kerr, Skinner's German sous chef. *Julius Callahan as Lalo, Gusteau's saucier and poissonnier. Callahan also voices Fran√ßois, the advertising executive handling the marketing of Gusteau's microwaveable products. *James Remar as Larousse, Gusteau's garde manger. *John Ratzenberger as Mustafa, Gusteau's chef de salle. *Teddy Newton as Talon Labarthe, Skinner's lawyer. *Tony Fucile as Pompidou, Gusteau's patissier.

In other-language versions, this role is also voiced by a chef. *Jamie Oliver as The Health Inspector (UK version) https://pixarplanet.com/blog/naked-chef-in-uk-ratatouille/ The character Bomb Voyage from The Incredibles makes a minor cameo appearance during the second act as a street mime performing behind Linguini and Colette as they are roller skating by Notre Dame Cathedral; his name additionally appearing on a newspaper that Colette is reading. Production Jan Pinkava came up with the concept in 2000, creating the original design, sets and characters and core storyline, but he was never formally named the director of the film. By 2004, Pixar added Bob Peterson as a co-director and was given exclusive control of the story. Lacking confidence in the story development, The Incredibles director Brad Bird was approached by Pixar management to direct the film, taking over Pinkava's role in 2005 while Peterson left the film to work on Up. Bird was attracted to the film because of the outlandishness of the concept and the conflict that drove it: that rats feared kitchens, yet a rat wanted to work in one. Bird was also delighted that the film could be made a highly physical comedy, with the character of Linguini providing endless fun for the animators. Bird rewrote the story, with a change in emphasis. He killed off Gusteau, gave larger roles to Skinner and Colette, and also changed the appearance of the rats to be less anthropomorphic. Because Ratatouille is intended to be a romantic, lush vision of Paris, giving it an identity distinct from previous Pixar films, director Brad Bird, producer Brad Lewis and some of the crew spent a week in the city to properly understand its environment, taking a motorcycle tour and eating at five top restaurants. Ian Holm was cast as the character since Bird saw him on The Lord of the Rings trilogy. There are also many water-based sequences in the film, one of which is set in the sewers and is more complex than the blue whale scene in Finding Nemo. One scene has Linguini wet after jumping into the Seine to fetch Remy. A Pixar employee (Shade/Paint department coordinator Kesten Migdal) jumped into Pixar's swimming pool wearing a chef's uniform and apron to see which parts of the suit stuck to his body and which became translucent from water absorption. The film's take on the traditional ratatouille dish was designed by gourmet chef Thomas Keller and later came to be known as confit byaldi. A challenge for the filmmakers was creating computer-generated images of food that would appear delicious. Gourmet chefs in both the U.S. and France were consulted, and animators attended cooking classes at San Francisco-area culinary schools to understand the workings of a commercial kitchen. Sets/Layout department manager Michael Warch, a culinary-academy-trained professional chef before working at Pixar, helped teach and consult animators as they worked. He also prepared dishes used by the Art, Shade/Paint, Effects and Sets Modeling departments. Renowned chef Thomas Keller allowed producer Brad Lewis to intern in his French Laundry kitchen. For the film's climax, Keller designed a fancy, layered version of the title dish for the rat characters to cook, which he called \\"confit byaldi\\" in honor of the original Turkish name. The same sub- surface light scattering technique that was used on the skin in The Incredibles was used on fruits and vegetables, while new programs gave an organic texture and movement to the food. Completing the illusion were music, dialogue, and abstract imagery representing the characters' mental sensations while appreciating food. The visual flavor metaphors were created by animator Michel Gagn√© inspired by the work of Oscar Fischinger and Norman McLaren. To create a realistic compost pile, the Art Department photographed fifteen different kinds of produce, such as apples, berries, bananas, mushrooms, oranges, broccoli, and lettuce, in the process of rotting. The cast members strove to make their French accents authentic yet understandable. John Ratzenberger notes that he often segued into an Italian accent. According to Pixar designer Jason Deamer, \\"Most of the characters were designed while Jan [Pinkava] was still directing‚Ä¶ He has a real eye for sculpture.\\" According to Pinkava, the critic Anton Ego was designed to resemble a vulture. To save time, human characters were designed and animated without toes. Rat expert Debbie Ducommun (a.k.a. the \\"Rat Lady\\") was consulted on rat habits and characteristics. Along with Ducommun's insight a vivarium containing pet rats sat in a hallway for more than a year so animators could study the movement of the animals' fur, noses, ears, paws, and tails as they ran. Promotional material for Intel credits their platform for a 30 percent performance improvement in rendering software. They used Remy in some of their marketing materials. Soundtrack Ratatouille is the second Pixar film to be scored by Michael Giacchino after The Incredibles. It was also the second Pixar film not to be scored by Randy Newman or Thomas Newman. Giacchino had written two themes for Remy, one about his self with the rat colony and the other about his hopes and dreams. He also wrote a buddy theme for both Remy and Linguini that plays when they're together. In addition to the score, Giacchino wrote the main theme song, \\"Le Festin\\", about Remy and his wishes to be a chef. French artist Camille was hired to perform \\"Le Festin\\" after Giacchino listened to her music and realized she was perfect for the song; as a result, the song is sung in French in all versions of the film. The music for Ratatouille gave Giacchino his first Academy Award nomination for Best Original Score as well as his first Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack Album. Giacchino returned to Pixar to score their 2009 blockbuster Up. Release Ratatouille was originally going to be released in 2006; however, in December 2004, the date was changed to 2007. This happened because Disney/Pixar changed the release date of Cars, from November 2005 to June 2006, thus pushing Ratatouille to 2007. Ratatouilles world premiere was on June 22, 2007, at Los Angeles' Kodak Theater. The commercial release was one week later, with the short film Lifted preceding Ratatouille in theaters. Earlier in the year, it had received an Academy Award nomination. A test screening of the film was shown at the Harkins Cine Capri Theater in Scottsdale, Arizona on June 16, 2007, at which a Pixar representative was present to collect viewer feedback. Disney CEO Bob Iger announced an upcoming theatrical re-release of the film in 3D at the Disney shareholders meeting in March 2014. =Marketing= The trailer for Ratatouille debuted with the release of its immediate predecessor, Cars. It depicts an original scene where Remy is caught on the cheese trolley in the restaurant's dining area, sampling the cheese and barely escaping the establishment, intercut with separate scenes of the rat explaining directly to the audience why he is taking such risks. Similar to most of Pixar's teaser trailers, the scene was not present in the final film release. A second trailer was released on March 23, 2007. The Ratatouille Big Cheese Tour began on May 11, 2007, with cooking demonstrations and a film preview. Voice actor Lou Romano attended the San Francisco leg of the tour for autograph signings. The front label of the planned Ratatouille wine to have been promoted by Disney, Pixar, and Costco, and subsequently pulled for its use of a cartoon character Disney and Pixar were working to bring a French-produced Ratatouille-branded wine to Costco stores in August 2007, but abandoned plans because of complaints from the California Wine Institute, citing standards in labelling that restrict the use of cartoon characters to avoid attracting under-age drinkers. In the United Kingdom, in place of releasing a theatrical trailer, a commercial featuring Remy and Emile was released in cinemas before its release to discourage obtaining unlicensed copies of films. Also, in the United Kingdom, the main characters were used for a commercial for the Nissan Note, with Remy and Emile watching an original commercial for it made for the \\"Surprisingly Spacious\\" ad campaign and also parodying it, respectively. Disney/Pixar was concerned that audiences, particularly children, would not be familiar with the word \\"ratatouille\\" and its pronunciation. The title was, therefore, also spelled phonetically within trailers and on posters. For similar reasons, in the American release of the film, on-screen text in French was printed in English, such as the title of Gusteau's cookbook and the sign telling kitchen staff to wash their hands, though, in the British English release, these are rendered in French. In Canada, the film was released theatrically with text in English, but on DVD, the majority of the text (including Gusteau's will) was in French. =Home media= Disney released Ratatouille on high-definition Blu-ray Disc and DVD in North America on November 6, 2007. A new animated short film featuring Remy and Emile entitled Your Friend the Rat was included as a special feature, in which the two rats attempt to entreat the viewer, a human, to welcome rats as their friends, demonstrating the benefits and misconceptions of rats towards humanity through several historical examples. The eleven-minute short uses 3D animation, 2D animation, live action and even stop-motion animation, a first for Pixar. The disc also includes a CG short entitled Lifted, which screened before the film during its theatrical run. It depicts an adolescent extraterrestrial attempting to abduct a sleeping human. Throughout the sequence, he is graded by an adult extraterrestrial in a manner reminiscent of a driver's licensing exam road test. The entire short contains no dialogue, which is typical of Pixar Shorts not based on existing properties. Also included among the special features are deleted scenes, a featurette featuring Brad Bird discussing filmmaking and chef Thomas Keller discussing culinary creativity entitled \\"Fine Food and Film\\", and four easter eggs. Although the Region A Blu-ray edition has a French audio track, the Region 1 DVD does not, except for some copies sold in Canada. It was released on DVD on November 6, 2007, and earned 4,919,574 units (equivalent to ) on its first week (November 6‚Äì11, 2007) during which it topped the DVD charts. In total it sold 12,531,266 units () becoming the second-best-selling animated DVD of 2007, both in units sold and sales revenue, behind Happy Feet. Ratatouille was released on 4K Blu-ray on September 10, 2019. =Plagiarized film= If magazine described Ratatoing, a 2007 Brazilian computer graphics cartoon by V√≠deo Brinquedo, as a \\"ripoff\\" of Ratatouille.\\"Clip of the Week: RATATOING ‚Äì BRAZIL RIPOFF OF RATATOUILLE\\", If Marco Aur√©lio Can√¥nico of the Brazilian newspaper, Folha de S.Paulo described Ratatoing as a derivative of Ratatouille. Can√¥nico discussed whether Ratatoing was similar enough to Ratatouille to warrant a lawsuit for copyright violation. The Brazilian Ministry of Culture posted Marco Aur√©lio Can√¥nico's article on its website. To date no sources have been found to indicate that Pixar took legal action. Reception =Critical response= The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 96% approval rating with an average rating of 8.47/10 based on 249 reviews. The site's consensus reads: \\"Fast-paced and stunningly animated, Ratatouille adds another delightfully entertaining entry‚Äîand a rather unlikely hero‚Äîto the Pixar canon.\\" Metacritic, another review aggregator website which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 top reviews from mainstream critics, calculated a score of 96 out of 100 based on 37 reviews, the highest of any Pixar film and the twenty-first highest film rating on the site. A. O. Scott of The New York Times called Ratatouille \\"a nearly flawless piece of popular art, as well as one of the most persuasive portraits of an artist ever committed to film\\"; echoing the character Anton Ego in the film, he ended his review with a simple \\"thank you\\" to the creators of the film. Wally Hammond of Time Out gave the film five out of five stars, saying \\"A test for tiny tots, a mite nostalgic and as male-dominated as a modern kitchen it may be, but these are mere quibbles about this delightful addition to the Pixar pantheon.\\" Andrea Gronvall of the Chicago Reader gave the film a positive review, saying \\"Brad Bird's second collaboration with Pixar is more ambitious and meditative than his Oscar-winning The Incredibles.\\" Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B, saying \\"Ratatouille has the Pixar technical magic without, somehow, the full Pixar flavor. It's Brad Bird's genial dessert, not so much incredible as merely sweetly edible.\\" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film three- and-a-half stars out of four, saying \\"What makes Ratatouille such a hilarious and heartfelt wonder is the way Bird contrives to let it sneak up on you. And get a load of that score from Michael Giacchino, a perfect complement to a delicious meal.\\" James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film three out of four stars, saying \\"For parents looking to spend time in a theater with their kids or adults who want something lighter and less testosterone-oriented than the usual summer fare, Ratatouille offers a savory main course.\\" Christy Lemire of the Associated Press gave the film a positive review, saying \\"Ratatouille is free of the kind of gratuitous pop-culture references that plague so many movies of the genre; it tells a story, it's very much of our world but it never goes for the cheap, easy gag.\\" Justin Chang of Variety gave the film a positive review, saying \\"The master chefs at Pixar have blended all the right ingredients‚Äîabundant verbal and visual wit, genius slapstick timing, a soupcon of Gallic sophistication‚Äîto produce a warm and irresistible concoction.\\" Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune gave the film four out of four stars, saying \\"The film may be animated, and largely taken up with rats, but its pulse is gratifyingly human. And you have never seen a computer- animated feature with this sort of visual panache and detail.\\" Rafer Guzman of Newsday gave the film three out of four stars, saying \\"So many computer- animated movies are brash, loud and popping with pop-culture comedy, but Ratatouille has the warm glow of a favorite book. The characters are more than the sum of their gigabyte-consuming parts ‚Äì they feel handcrafted.\\" Roger Moore of the Orlando Sentinel gave the film three out of five stars, saying \\"Has Pixar lost its magic recipe? Ratatouille is filled with fairly generic animated imagery, a few modest chases, a couple of good gags, not a lot of laughs.\\" Scott Foundas of LA Weekly gave the film a positive review, saying \\"Bird has taken the raw ingredients of an anthropomorphic-animal kiddie matinee and whipped them into a heady brew about nothing less than the principles of artistic creation.\\" Colin Covert of the Star Tribune gave the film four out of four stars, saying \\"It's not just the computer animation that is vibrantly three-dimensional. It's also the well-rounded characters‚Ä¶ I defy you to name another animated film so overflowing with superfluous beauty.\\" Steven Rea of The Philadelphia Inquirer gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, saying \\"With Ratatouille, Bird once again delivers not just a great, witty story, but dazzling visuals as well.\\" Bill Muller of The Arizona Republic gave the film four-and-a-half stars out of five, saying \\"Like the burbling soup that plays a key part in Ratatouille, the movie is a delectable blend of ingredients that tickles the palette and leaves you hungry for more.\\" Brad Bird with his second Academy Award for Best Animated Feature Rene Rodriguez of the Miami Herald gave the film three out of four stars, saying \\"Ratatouille is the most straightforward and formulaic picture to date from Pixar Animation Studios, but it is also among the most enchanting and touching.\\" Jack Mathews of the New York Daily News gave the film four out of four stars, saying \\"The Pixar magic continues with Brad Bird's Ratatouille, a gorgeous, wonderfully inventive computer-animated comedy.\\" Stephen Whitty of the Newark Star-Ledger gave the film three out of four stars, saying \\"Fresh family fun. Although there are those slightly noxious images of rodents scampering around a kitchen, the movie doesn't stoop to kid-pandering jokes based on backtalk and bodily gases.\\" David Ansen of Newsweek gave the film a positive review, saying \\"A film as rich as a sauce b√©arnaise, as refreshing as a raspberry sorbet, and a lot less predictable than the damn food metaphors and adjectives all us critics will churn out to describe it. OK, one more and then I'll be done: it's yummy.\\" Peter Hartlaub of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film four out of four stars, saying \\"Ratatouille never overwhelms, even though it's stocked with action, romance, historical content, family drama and serious statements about the creation of art.\\" Richard Corliss of Time gave the film a positive review, saying \\"From the moment Remy enters, crashing, to the final happy fadeout, Ratatouille parades the brio and depth that set Pixar apart from and above other animation studios.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four out of four stars, saying \\"A lot of animated movies have inspired sequels, notably Shrek, but Brad Bird's Ratatouille is the first one that made me positively desire one.\\" Peter Howell of the Toronto Star gave the film four out of four stars, saying \\"Had Bird gone the safe route, he would have robbed us of a great new cartoon figure in Remy, who like the rest of the film is rendered with animation that is at once fanciful and life-like. It's also my pick for Pixar's best.\\" Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal gave the film a positive review, saying \\"The characters are irresistible, the animation is astonishing and the film, a fantasy version of a foodie rhapsody, sustains a level of joyous invention that hasn't been seen in family entertainment since The Incredibles.\\" Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times gave the film four-and-a-half stars out of five, saying \\"Brad Bird's Ratatouille is so audacious you have to fall in love with its unlikely hero.\\" Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film three-and-a- half stars out of four, saying \\"Ratatouille is delicious fun sure to be savored by audiences of all ages for its sumptuous visuals, clever wit and irresistibly inspiring tale.\\" Miriam Di Nunzio of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, saying \\"Ratatouille will make you wonder why animation needs to hide behind the mantle of 'it's for children, but grownups will like it, too.' This one's for Mom and Dad, and yep, the kids will like it, too.\\" Michael Booth of The Denver Post gave the film three-and- a-half stars out of four, saying \\"Writer and director Brad Bird keeps Ratatouille moving without resorting to the cute animal jokes or pop-culture wisecracking that ruined so many other recent animated films.\\" Tom Long of The Detroit News gave the film an A, saying \\"Ratatouille has the technical genius, emotional core and storytelling audacity to lift it into the ranks of [the best] Pixar films, the cr√®me de la cr√®me of modern animation.\\" Liam Lacey of The Globe and Mail gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, saying \\"No sketchy backgrounds here‚ÄîRatatouilles scenes feel like deep-focus camera shots. The textures, from the gleam of copper pans to the cobblestone streets, are almost palpable.\\" Desson Thomson of The Washington Post gave the film a positive review, saying \\"Ratatouille doesn't center on the over-familiar surfaces of contemporary life. It harks back to Disney's older era when cartoons seemed part of a more elegant world with less edgy characters.\\" =Box office= In its opening weekend in North America, Ratatouille opened in 3,940 theaters and debuted at number one with $47 million, the lowest Pixar opening since A Bug's Life. However, in France, where the film is set, the film broke the record for the biggest debut for an animated film and dethroned Titanic for the most consecutive weeks at the top of the box office. In the United Kingdom, the film debuted at number one with sales over ¬£4 million. The film has grossed $206.4 million in the United States and Canada and a total of $620.7 million worldwide, making it the seventh-highest-grossing Pixar film. =Accolades= Ratatouille won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature at the 80th Academy Awards and was nominated for four others: Best Original Score, Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing, Best Original Screenplay, losing to Atonement, The Bourne Ultimatum (for both Best Sound Editing and Best Sound Mixing), and Juno, respectively. At the time, the film held the record for the greatest number of Oscar nominations for a computer animated feature film, breaking the previous record held by Monsters, Inc., Finding Nemo, and The Incredibles at four nominations, but tied with Aladdin for any animated film. In 2008, WALL-E surpassed that record with six nominations. As of 2013, Ratatouille is tied with Up and Toy Story 3 for an animated film with the second-greatest number of Oscar nominations. Beauty and the Beast still holds the record for most Oscar nominations (also 6) for an animated feature film. Furthermore, Ratatouille was nominated for 13 Annie Awards including twice in the Best Animated Effects, where it lost to Surf's Up, and three times in the Best Voice Acting in an Animated Feature Production for Janeane Garofalo, Ian Holm, and Patton Oswalt, where Ian Holm won the award. It won the Best Animated Feature Award from multiple associations including the Chicago Film Critics, the National Board of Review, the Annie Awards, the Broadcast Film Critics, the British Academy of Film and Television (BAFTA), and the Golden Globes. Video game The primary video game adaptation of the film, titled Ratatouille, was released for all major consoles and handhelds in 2007. A Nintendo DS exclusive game, titled Ratatouille: Food Frenzy, was released in October 2007. Ratatouille is also among the films represented in Kinect Rush: A Disney-Pixar Adventure, released in March 2012 for Xbox 360. The video game based on the movie was released in 2007 for Xbox 360, Wii, PlayStation 2, GameCube, Xbox, Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS, PlayStation Portable, Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, Java ME, and mobile phones. A PlayStation 3 version was released on October 23, 2007. The other versions, however were all released on June 26, 2007. Remy is featured in the video game Kingdom Hearts III. He appears as the head chef for Scrooge McDuck's bistro and participates with Sora in cooking minigames. He is addressed only as \\"Little Chef\\" in the game. Theme park attraction A Disney theme park attraction based on the film has been constructed in Walt Disney Studios Park, Disneyland Paris. Ratatouille: L'Aventure Totalement Toqu√©e de R√©my is based upon scenes from the film and uses trackless ride technology. In the attraction, riders \\"shrink down to the size of a rat\\". At the 2017 D23 Expo, Disney announced a similar, Ratatouille- based attraction would be built at the France Pavilion in Epcot's World Showcase by 2020.

Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd edition (1989) Recipes and cooking times differ widely, but common ingredients include tomato, garlic, onion, courgette (zucchini), aubergine (eggplant), capsicum (bell pepper), and some combination of leafy green herbs common to the region. Origins The word ratatouille derives from the Occitan ratatolha¬´ ratatouio ¬ª, Lou tresor dou Felibrige, Fr√©d√©ric Mistral and is related to the French ratouiller and tatouiller, expressive forms of the verb touiller, meaning \\"to stir up\\". From the late 18th century, in French, it merely indicated a coarse stew. The modern ratatouille ‚Äì tomatoes as a foundation for saut√©ed garlic, onion, zucchini, aubergine (eggplant), bell pepper, marjoram, fennel and basil, or bay leaf and thyme, or a mix of green herbs like herbes de Provence ‚Äì does not appear in print until c. 1930.Scotto, E., and Marianne Comolli. \\"Vegetables: A Garden of Eden.\\" France, the Beautiful Cookbook: Authentic Recipes from the Regions of France.

The Larousse Gastronomique claims \\"according to the purists, the different vegetables should be cooked separately, then combined and cooked slowly together until they attain a smooth, creamy consistency\\", so that (according to the chair of the Larousse's committee Jo√´l Robuchon) \\"each [vegetable] will taste truly of itself.\\" File:Ratatouille-Dish.jpgRatatouille ni√ßoise File:20170329_ratatouille-debut-cuisson.jpgMixing of ratatouille ingredients in a bowl File:20170329 ratatouille-fin-cuisson.jpgCooked ratatouille in a pot  In popular culture  The dish is referenced in the 2007 film Ratatouille.

D'Ascanio designed the first production helicopter, for Agusta, and designed the first motor scooter for Ferdinando Innocenti. After the two fell out, D'Ascanio helped Enrico Piaggio produce the original Vespa. Biography D'Ascanio had an early passion for flight and design: by the age of fifteen, after studying flying techniques and the ratio between weight and wingspan of some birds, he built an experimental glider which he would launch from the hills near his home town. =World War I= After graduating in 1914 in mechanical engineering at the Politecnico di Torino, he enlisted in the voluntary division of the Italian Army entitled \\"weapon of Engineers, Division Battalion Aviatori\\" in Piedmont, where he was assigned the testing of airplane engines. Appointed sub-lieutenant on March 21, 1915, D'Ascanio was sent to France to choose a rotary engine to be produced in Italy for the Corpo Aeronautico Militare, returning with an agreement to produce the Gnome et Rh√¥ne designed Le Rh√¥ne. After a brief pilot training course in Corsica on a Farman MF.7, he returned to engineering, designing a patented forward-facing monitoring device to improve maintenance monitoring within flight squadrons (estimated to have saved fifty lives), and took part in the trials of the first radio equipment installed in Italian aircraft.Bio - Corradino D'Ascanio In 1916 D'Ascanio was assigned to join Fabbrica Aeroplani Ing. O. Pomilio, engaged in the manufacture of equipment SP2, Type C, D Type and others. Following the end of World War I, the Pomilio brothers sold the company and moved in 1918 with key staff, including D'Ascanio, to Indianapolis in the United States to form the Pomilio Brothers Corporation. =Between the wars= D'AT3 On his return to Italy after a year in 1919, D'Ascanio again settled in Popoli, focused on the control mechanisms for helicopters, through which he derived a number of patents. In 1925 he founded a company with Baron Pietro Trojani, which commissioned by the Ministry dell'Aeronautica produced in 1930 its third prototype, the coaxial D'AT3. This relatively large machine had two double-bladed, counter-rotating rotors, with control achieved by using auxiliary wings or servo-tabs on the trailing edges of the blades,(Spenser 1998) a concept that was later adopted by other helicopter designers, initially by the French Breguet-Dorand Gyroplane Laboratoire in 1935, and still later by designs from both Bleeker and Kaman. Three small propellers mounted on the airframe were used for additional control of pitch, roll, and yaw. Piloted by Marinello Nelli in October 1930 at Ciampino Airport, this machine held modest F√©d√©ration A√©ronautique Internationale speed and altitude records for the time, including altitude (18 m), duration (8 minutes 45 seconds) and distance flown (1,078 m).\\"FAI Record ID #13086 - Straight distance. Class E former G (Helicopters), piston \\" F√©d√©ration A√©ronautique Internationale (FAI). Retrieved: 21 September 2014. D'Ascanio's altitude record would be \\"unofficially\\" shattered by the Soviet-built, Yuriev- Cheremukhin TsAGI-1EA single-lift rotor helicopter in mid-August 1932, with a 605 meters (1,985 ft) altitude achievement, and also possessed fore-and-aft tubular fuselage structures for similar \\"anti-torque\\" stabilization rotors.Savine, Alexandre. \\"TsAGI 1-EA.\\" ctrl-c.liu.se, 24 March 1997. Retrieved 12 December 2010. However, during the Depression, in which the fascist government of Benito Mussolini concentrated on \\"standard\\" production items, the company collapsed in 1932, and D'Ascanio went to work for Enrico Piaggio at his fathers company, designing numerous successful high-speed adjustable pitch propellors for Piaggio Aero.AltaVista - Babel Fish Translation His work was considered so important during World War II, he was promoted to General in the Regia Aeronautica, and restarted helicopter development under instruction from President of Piaggio S. p. A. Enrico Piaggio from 1942. =After the war= Like many Italians, D'Ascanio found himself unemployed - the Piaggio factory was destroyed through Allied bombing. Worse still, Italy was under an agreement not to research or produce military or aerospace technology for a ten-year period, and so he was unemployable in Italy. Approached by pre-war tubing manufacturer Ferdinando Innocenti, who saw the future of cheap private transport and decided to produce a motor scooter ‚Äì competing on cost and weather protection against the ubiquitous motorcycle. =The Vespa= The main stimulus for the design style of the proposed Lambretta dated back to Pre-WWII Cushman scooters made in Nebraska, USA. These olive green scooters were in Italy in large numbers, ordered originally by the US Government as field transport for the Paratroops and Marines. The US military had used them to get around Nazi defence tactics, destroying roads and bridges during the Battle of Monte Cassino and in the Dolomites and the Austrian border areas. The motor scooter Ferdinando Innocenti gave D'Ascanio the job of designing a simple, robust and affordable vehicle. The vehicle had to be easy to ride for both men and women, be able to carry a passenger, and not get its driver's clothes dirty. D'Ascanio, who hated motorcycles, designed a revolutionary vehicle. It was built on a spar-frame with a handlebar gear change, and the engine mounted directly on to the rear wheel. The front protection \\"shield\\" kept the rider dry and clean in comparison to the open front end on motorcycles. The pass-through leg area design was geared towards all user groups, including women, whose skirts made riding a motorcycle a challenge. The front fork, like an aircraft's landing gear, allowed for easy wheel changing. The internal mesh transmission eliminated the standard motorcycle chain, a source of oil, dirt, and aesthetic misery. This basic design allowed a series of features to be deployed on the frame, which would later allow quick development of new models. However, D'Ascanio fell out with Innocenti, who wanted to produce his frame from rolled tubing, rather than a stamped spar frame, thereby allowing him to revive both parts of his pre-war company. General D'Ascanio dissociated himself from Innocenti, and took his design directly to Enrico Piaggio, who produced the spar-framed Vespa from 1946.Vespa - A Story of Success Innocenti, faced by design problems and production issues surrounding his tube frame, produced the Lambretta from 1947. In the decades of its history, the Vespa scooter has become one of the most famous brand designs worldwide, with 16 million units produced in 130 different models as of 2005. =After Vespa= In 1948 D'Ascanio attended an international congress for the helicopter in Philadelphia, where he was hailed as a true pioneer. He continued to work for Piaggio, tweaking designs for the Piaggio PD 3, and in 1952 the Piaggio PD4. However, restricted legally through neutrality agreements and financially through reconstruction, Piaggio had by now fallen behind the developments of the American Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation, and few of D'Ascanio helicopter designs or aeronautical developments made it beyond the drawing board. In 1964 D'Ascanio left Piaggio to join the Agusta Group of Cascina Costa, by then the largest Italian manufacturer of helicopters. In 1969 D'Ascanio designed a small training helicopter, the Agusta ADA, which could be modified for agricultural use - but it was not developed, due to Agusta's commitment to re- equipping the Italian military. Author of numerous scientific publications, published between 1954 and 1980, he was professor of design of machines and projects at the University of Pisa between 1937 (when he was an employee of Piaggio) and 1961. D'Ascanio, for his services to Italy and aeronautical development, was decorated with the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic by the President of the Italian Republic. Always disappointed by the fact that, publicly, he was recognised more for his association with the Vespa motor scooter than for his inventions and patents in the world of aviation, D'Ascanio died in Pisa on 6 August 1981.

The team was most notable for its relationship with Ford Motor Company as well as its sole driver, Rick Crawford. Beginnings Although Mitchell's team has found its home in NASCAR, the team originated in 1978 with Circle Bar sponsoring Chet Fillip in late models. The team officially started out as Circle Bar Auto Racing Inc., with Fillip as their driver. The team qualified for the 1982 Indianapolis 500, finishing 24th in a Gurney Eagle with a Cosworth power plant. Fillip also qualified for the 1983 Indianapolis 500 before DNQ-ing for the 1985 Indy 500 with a Lola chassis. The next week at Milwaukee, the team finished 10th with Fillip and sold their equipment to Al Unser Jr., who would take the championship. CBR made its NASCAR debut with Fillip in 1985, in the No. 31 Circle Bar Truck Corral Ford at Atlanta Motor Speedway. Fillip ran sixteen races for Mitchell in 1986, and had a best finish of twelfth in the No. 81. At the end of the year, Mitchell sold his equipment to Fillip. Afterwards, Circle Bar sponsored the late model efforts of John Kelly in 1989, with the shop based in San Antonio, Texas. Moving to Ozona, the team picked up the championship in 1990. The next year, CBR moved to the All-Pro Series with Kelly, but Alabama native Rick Crawford took his place in 1992. Together, they attempted the 1993 Coca-Cola 600, but failed to qualify. Using Circle Bar's equipment, Crawford had great success in the All-Pro Series, beginning a partnership between Mitchell and Crawford to race in the series until 1996. Camping World Truck Series =No. 10 Truck History= Circle Bar Racing fielded a second truck for the first time in 1997, when Tammy Jo Kirk drove the No. 74 at Fontana, as a start-and-park \\"field filler\\"; she finished 35th, parking after ten laps. The next attempt came in 2004, when Greg Biffle drove the No. 44 Ford Racing truck to an eighth-place finish at the Ford 200. CBR added on the No. 10 Truck in 2007, with David Starr behind the wheel. Picking up both Navistar International sponsorship and the owners points of ppc Racing's old Truck Series team, the team had a moderately successful year, finishing 10th in points in their first year. Starr left at the end of the season to return to Red Horse Racing. Brendan Gaughan took over the No. 10 truck in 2008, leaving his defunct family owned team South Point Racing. Gaughan earned two top fives and five top tens and finished 15th in points. At the end of the season, Gaughan departed the team, and rookie driver James Buescher was signed to the 10 truck full-time in 2009 with Jamie Jones as his crew chief. Buescher had three top-tens and a fourteenth-place points finish but departed the team as well at the end of the year. The team was eventually sold to Jennifer Jo Cobb. =No. 14 Truck History= In 1997, CBR focused its operations towards NASCAR, specifically its all-new Craftsman Truck Series. Continuing his partnership with Crawford and Ford, Mitchell debuted the No. 14 Ford at the Chevy Trucks Challenge in 1997 with Circle Bar sponsoring. Crawford made every race and finished 12th in points, runner up to Kenny Irwin Jr. for Rookie of the Year. 1998 brought the team's first win at Homestead Miami Speedway, but inconsistency put them at 18th in points. Crawford would not win for the next four years, but had two top ten points finishes in between, including a runner-up points finish to Mike Bliss in 2002. Crawford would take his second, and arguably biggest win at the season opening Florida Dodge Dealers 250, with a last lap pass on Travis Kvapil. The win propelled him to a seventh-place points finish. Rick would win again in 2004 at Martinsville, but dropped to twelfth in points. The 2005 season was a mixed bag, as the team won again at Loudon, but Crawford was forced to miss the first race of his career due to a crash during qualifying at Kentucky Speedway. Road racer Boris Said took his place, but was taken out in an early wreck. Rick won again at ORP in 2006 and finished ninth in points. Although the 2007 season was a winless one for the No. 14 team, they added on a second truck with David Starr who brought along sponsorship from Navistar International for both trucks. The added equipment resulted in a near win at Mansfield Motorsports Park and a fifth-place points finish for Crawford. Crawford slipped to seventh in points in 2008, and tenth in 2009 with twenty top-tens in between both seasons. Longtime crew chief Kevin \\"Cowboy\\" Starland left Circle Bar after 2009 for Panhandle Motorsports and International departed both the No. 10 and the No. 14 for Randy Moss Motorsports. Despite the lack of sponsorship, Circle Bar gained a new crew chief in Blake Bainbridge and ran the first four races of the season before having to release Crawford before Kansas and having to wait on additional sponsorship to continue running the season. The team has not been heard from since. Team owner Tom Mitchell died in August 2014 at age 83.

Established in September 2005, this international community includes representatives from a range of major sequencing and bioinformatics centres (including NCBI, EMBL, DDBJ, JCVI, JGI, EBI, Sanger, FIG) and research institutions. The goal of the GSC is to promote mechanisms for standardizing the description of (meta)genomes, including the exchange and integration of (meta)genomic data. The number and pace of genomic and metagenomic sequencing projects will only increase as the use of ultra-high-throughput methods becomes common place and standards are vital to scientific progress and data sharing. Mission Community-driven standards have the best chance of success if developed within the auspices of international working groups. Participants in the GSC include biologists, computer scientists, those building genomic databases and conducting large-scale comparative genomic analyses, and those with experience of building community-based standards. The mission of the GSC is to work with the wider community towards: * the implementation of a new genomic standards * methods of capturing and exchanging metadata * harmonization of metadata collection and analysis efforts across the wider genomics community MIGS/MIMS/MIMARKS and other projects The GSC has published a ‚ÄúMinimum Information about a (Meta)Genome Sequence‚Äù specification and has now completed a \\"Minimum Information about an ENvironmental Sequence\\" specification. MIGS/MIMS/MIMARKS provides an extension of the minimum information already captured by the primary nucleotide sequence archives (INSDC or DDBJ/ENA/GenBank). The development of any checklist must be an open and iterative process that involves a balanced group of participants. Further, this development process must be supported by providing mechanisms for achieving compliance if a checklist is to be adopted as a tool for the standardization of a particular area of knowledge. Work towards this goal has spawned a set of interlocking projects that are described in more detail here: GSC projects. These include The Genomic Contextual Data Markup Language (GCDML), Genomic Rosetta Stone (GRS), Habitat-Lite. Newer projects include the M5 project.

Proposed by activist Russell Means, the suggested territory would be enclaved by the borders of the United States, covering thousands of square miles in North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Wyoming, and Montana. These proposed borders are those of the 1851 Treaty of Fort Laramie between the United States government and the Lakota. These lands are now occupied by Indian reservations and non-Native settlements. None of the existing Lakota tribal governments support the proposed republic, and they were not consulted about the proposal.Lakota Sioux Have NOT Withdrawn From the US; in The Daily Kos; December 23, 2007; accessed March 28, 2016 In a paper published in February 2020, Hiroshi Fukurai, a Professor of Legal Studies and Sociology, wrote that \\"the declaration of independence by the Republic of Lakotah in 2007 has been largely ignored by the US, as well as by the UN and its Member States.\\" Background Four activists, calling themselves the Lakota Freedom Delegation, traveled to Washington, D.C., on December 17, 2007, and delivered a statement declaring that they were, \\"withdrawing from the treaties their ancestors signed with the U.S.\\" and \\"setting up their own independent nation.\\" Reasons cited included that \\"the federal government has failed to abide by 33 treaties that promised land, health care, education and other services.\\" Their leader was Russell Means, one of the prominent members of the American Indian Movement in the late 1960s and 1970s. The Lakota Freedom Delegation stated that they did not recognize tribal governments or presidents as recognized by the United States Bureau of Indian Affairs, sometimes referring to these groups as \\"stay-by-the- fort Indians\\". Nor did any tribal governments, elected by the tribal people themselves, recognize the Republic of Lakotah. Territory, demographics, and economics The proposed boundaries of Lakotah would be the Yellowstone River to the north, the North Platte River to the south, the Missouri River to the east and an irregular line marking the west. These borders coincide with those set by the 1851 Treaty of Fort Laramie: Activities On January 1, 2008, the republic announced that it would file liens on all U.S. government-held lands within their claimed borders; however, the first round of liens, in an unnamed county in South Dakota, were rejected. Following this the group chose to concentrate on the Black Hills. In July 2008, Means announced that the Republic of Lakotah would be founding an all-Lakota \\"grand jury\\" to investigate corruption by U.S. government officials on the seven reservations in the republic's claimed territory. Means unsuccessfully ran for the presidency of the Oglala Lakota several times; in the 2008 election he lost 1,918 to 2,277. Politics and government Citizenship in the proposed republic would be open to people of all races and to any resident of the land Lakotah claims. The group said they planned to issue their own passports and driving licenses in the name of the proposed nation. The group proposed that the nation be organized as a confederation that would respect the libertarian principles of posse comitatus and caveat emptor, would offer \\"individual liberty through community rule,\\" and would collect no nationwide taxes. However, individual communities within the proposed nation would be allowed to levy taxes with the consent of the taxed. Russell Means suggested that the proposed nation should not use fiat currency but instead adopt a gold standard.Russell Means interview from December 26, 2007 on Free Talk Live Means stated that this system of government is derived from the traditional Lakota government system, saying, \\"we are going to implement how we lived prior to the Invasion. Each community will be a mini-state unto itself ... They will form the federation known as Lakotah.\\" As of 2008, Russell Means identified himself as \\"Chief Facilitator\\" of a provisional government of the Republic of Lakotah. Means died in 2012. The four signatories of the Lakota Freedom Delegation's letter to the United States Department of State that announced withdrawal from the U.S. identified themselves by the title of \\"Itacan of Lakota\\" in a press release. Leaders of communities would be informally chosen by elders of the community. =Government= The following people identified themselves as members of the provisional government of Lakotah: * Russell Means, chief facilitator (died 2012) * Tegheya Kte, also called Garry Rowland (fully, Clarence Gary Anthony Rowland), facilitator * Phyllis Young, provisional government member The capital of Lakotah was not announced. The Republic of Lakotah gave its provisional capital as Porcupine, South Dakota with hopes in the long run to move administration to near Rapid City, South Dakota. Assertion of independence The Lakota Freedom Delegation traveled to Washington, D.C. and contacted the State Department, announcing that the Lakota were unilaterally withdrawing from the several treaties with the United States government. The delegation presented a letter, dated December 17, 2007 and signed by longtime Indian activists Russell Means, Garry Rowland, Duane \\"Canupa Gluha Mani\\" Martin Sr., and Phyllis Young, which declared the Lakota to be \\"predecessor sovereign of Dakota Territory\\" and cited gross violations of the treaties between the Lakota and the United States as the immediate cause for withdrawal. The letter also invited the United States government to enter into negotiations with the newly declared entity, there identified only as \\"Lakotah\\". It threatened that if good-faith negotiations were not begun then \\"Lakotah will begin to administer liens against real estate transactions within the five state area of Lakotah.\\" The group also has pursued international recognition for Lakotah at the embassies of Venezuela, Bolivia, Chile, and South Africa. Russell Means has made reference to Finland and Iceland as well. =Legal basis for independence= Traditional range of the Siouan peoples (dark green) and the current reservations (orange). Supporters of Lakotah argue that their assertion of sovereignty is entirely legal under \\"Natural, International and United States law\\". The group emphasizes that the Republic's establishment comes from a \\"withdrawal\\" from the United States, not a secession. The group claims the right to withdraw, on behalf of the Lakota people, from the Treaties of Fort Laramie as a consequence of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties and the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Members argue that the decision in the case of Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock, 187 U.S. 553 (1903) shows that the United States Government does not adequately protect Indian rights. Means cites the Enabling Act of 1889, stating that clauses protecting Indian sovereignty on the lands comprising the states where the Lakota historically reside have been ignored. In a 15 January 2008 news release, the Republic of Lakotah proposed that independence from the United States might follow a Compact of Free Association and suggested that the independence process could resemble that of the Philippines, Palau, the Federated States of Micronesia or the Marshall Islands. Russell Means stated that he intended to treat the result of the 2008 Pine Ridge Reservation Presidential election, in which he was a candidate, as a \\"plebiscite/referendum\\" on Lakota independence. He lost that election 1,918 to 2,277. =Motivations for independence= Lakotah's founders cite the Oglala 1974 Declaration of Continuing Independence: The groups cite several reasons for its assertion of sovereignty, all connected to what they refer to as the \\"colonial apartheid\\" of the reservation system in the United States. The group claims that control by the United States has led to massive unemployment, poverty and disease among the Lakota people and also alleges that 150 years of U.S. administration is responsible for the statistical poverty of Lakota lands. The group claims that withdrawal from the United States will reverse these problems, and help reestablish the Lakota language and culture. The group also claims persistent violations by the United States of their treaties with the Lakota. Inyan Kara, in the Black Hills is a sacred mountain to the Lakota. Another longstanding point of contention between the Lakota and the United States is the status of the Black Hills of South Dakota, which were part of Sioux reservation lands until they were taken without compensation by the US government and opened for gold mining following the collapse of the Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868). In 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court decision United States v. Sioux Nation of Indians awarded $105 million to eight tribes of Sioux Indians as compensation ($17.1 million for the market value of the land in 1877 and $88 million in 5% per annum simple interest between 1877 and 1980), but the court did not award land. The tribal governments of the Lakota have refused the settlement. Reactions None of the existing Lakota tribal governments support the proposed republic, and they were not consulted about the proposal. Russell Means and Canupa Gluha Mani have claimed that some 13,000 Lakota, including 77% of the population of Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, have shown support for the Republic of Lakotah, and that the eight-member delegation which traveled to Washington, D.C. was only a portion of some 77 tribal elders and activists taking part in the movement. However, Rapid City Journal reporter Bill Harlan reported on his blog that \\"most folks I talk to hadn't heard about the declaration. The ones who had heard the news, to a person, did not want to talk about it on the record.\\" The Journal has also noted that \\"there were no tribal presidents in the group which made the announcement, no one from the top ranks of any of the Lakota Sioux tribes.\\" Nanwica Kciji, an Oglala Lakota and first president of the Native American Journalists Association, has also discredited the December 2007 developments, arguing that the Lakotah Freedom Delegation \\"never considered that treaties are made between nations and not individuals.\\" = American responses = Recognized Native-American governments Rodney Bordeaux, chairman of the Rosebud Sioux, said that Rosebud Indian Reservation has no interest in joining the Republic of Lakotah and said that the Lakota Freedom Delegation never presented their plan to the tribal council. Bordeaux stated that the group does not represent the Lakota people nor the support of the elected tribal governments. However, he did say that Russell Means \\"made some good points\\". Joseph Brings Plenty, chairman of the Cheyenne River Lakota, agreed that the Lakota Freedom Delegation \\"are not representative of the nation I represent\\" but would not say whether he agreed or disagreed with their goals and message, noting some value in the group's actions in raising awareness for the history of the Lakota people. Federal government The United States Department of State referred queries on the subject of Lakotah to the United States Department of the Interior, which oversees the Bureau of Indian Affairs.\\"For your query, we will refer you to the Department of the Interior. This is not a State Department issue.\\" Kirsten Petree, Director, Office of Media Affairs, U.S. Department of State, private communication with Wikinews (December 21, 2007) Gary Garrison of the BIA said that the group's withdrawal \\"doesn't mean anything\\". \\"These are not legitimate tribal governments elected by the people ... when they begin the process of violating other people's rights, breaking the law, they're going to end up like all the other groups that have declared themselves independent ‚Äî usually getting arrested and being put in jail.\\" Regarding the government response, or lack thereof, Russell Means stated that, \\"I don't expect the federal government to do anything. I don't believe they even know what to do.\\"  Other American movements  The Alaskan Independence Party, in an announcement dated December 21, 2007, \\"applauded\\" the independent Lakota nation and granted it \\"full recognition\\". The secessionist movement Second Vermont Republic has also announced its support, and encouraged other American Indian groups to similarly declare independence from the United States. =International responses= Internationally, according to Russell Means, Venezuela's ambassador to the United States has stated to the group that his country cannot recognize Lakotah's independence based on Venezuela's interpretation of what the Lakotah Freedom Delegation is doing. In February 2008, the Lakotah Freedom Delegation (including Means) handed over a formal petition, asking for recognition of the Republic of Lakotah, to the embassies of Russia, Serbia, Bolivia, Venezuela, the Republic of South Africa, Ireland, France, Nicaragua, East Timor, Chile, Turkey, India, Finland, Iceland and Uruguay. The text of the petition is available online.

The gang dominated the city's drug market throughout most of the 1990s, until in 1998 six gang members were jailed after being caught with more than a ¬£1 million worth of crack cocaine. The power vacuum that this created was quickly filled by Yardie gangs such as the Hype Crew and Mountain View Posse. Upon their release from prison the Aggi crew quickly set on reclaiming their old territory. Carrying guns and wearing balaclavas, the gangsters went around local bars such as the Black Swan and the Malcolm X Centre and announced the yardies would now have to pay a daily tax of ¬£50 per yardie and ¬£100 per business being run. The yardies did not agree with this however and stormed a cafe run by the Aggis, which doubled as a front for an illegal gambling operation. Thus was started a small-scale turf war which included a number of shootings, during the course of which the two Aggi crew members robbed the notorious Black and White Caf√©, a known local drugs haunt, and later shot fireworks at the building in an attempt to provoke the yardies into a full-on gunfight. The escalating violence prompted armed police patrols in the St Paul's area. However the patrols were soon withdrawn, as the Aggi crew members were arrested again for violating their parole and the turf war ended.

In 1833 obtained his medical doctorate from the University of G√∂ttingen, later serving as an assistant to Karl Gustav Himly (1772‚Äì1837).Pagel: Biographical Dictionary excellent doctors of the nineteenth century (biography) In 1841 he became an associate professor at G√∂ttingen, receiving the title of \\"full professor\\" in 1847. Afterwards he was a professor of ophthalmology at the University of Leipzig from 1852 to 1867. Christian Ruete was a pioneer of German ophthalmology, and made several significant contributions in this field. In 1845 he designed the first ophthalmotrope, a device that serves as a mechanical model of the eye and its muscles, and is used to clarify movements of the eye. In 1857 he constructed an improved version of his earlier prototype. He made modifications to Hermann von Helmholtz's ophthalmoscope by implementing a concave focusing mirror, and thereby introduced \\"indirect ophthalmoscopy\\" to allow for a stereoscopic and wider view of the fundus of the eye. Ruete also conducted extensive research of ophthalmic disorders that included strabismus and hypermetropia. On the anomalies of accommodation and refraction of the Eye by Franciscus Cornelis Donders and William Daniel Moore Ruete's ophthalmotrope, second model (1857)  Written works  In 1845 Ruete published \\"Lehrbuch der Ophthalmologie f√ºr Aerzte und Studirende\\", a book that contained the first depiction of a visual migraine aura in European medical literature. In the book, he pictorially explained the phenomenon in three successive stages. With mathematician Johann Benedict Listing (1808‚Äì1882), he published a treatise on entoptic phenomena and cataract.

The professional practice of behavior analysis is the delivery of interventions to consumers that are guided by the principles of radical behaviorism and the research of both the experimental analysis of behavior and applied behavior analysis. Professional practice seeks maximum precision to change behavior most effectively in specific instances. Behavior analysts are mental health professionals and, in some states, may hold a license, certificate or registration as a behavior analyst. In other states, there are no laws governing their practice and, as such, the practice may be prohibited as falling under the practice definition of other mental health professionals. This is rapidly changing as Behavior Analysts are becoming more and more common. The professional practice of behavior analysis is a hybrid discipline with specific influences coming from counseling, psychology, education, special education, communication disorders, physical therapy and criminal justice. As a discipline it has its own conferences, organizations, certification processes and awards. Defining the scope of practice The Behavior Analysis Certification Board (BACB) defines behavior analysis as:BACB As the above suggests, behavior analysis is based on the principles of operant and respondent conditioning. Applied behavior analysis (ABA) include the use of behavior management, behavioral engineering and behavior therapy. Behavior analysis is an active, environmental-based approach. Currently in the U.S. some behavior analysts at the masters level are licensed; others work with an international certification where licenses are unavailable, although this may not be allowed in some states or jurisdictions. At the doctoral level many are licensed as psychologists with Diplomate status in behavioral psychology or licensed as licensed behavior analysts. Diplomate status alone, however, does not allow one to practice in every state and each state's regulatory statute must be reviewed for the appropriateness and legality of practice. =Certification= The Behavior Analyst Certification Board (BACB) offers a technical certificate in behavior analysis. The American Psychological Association offers a diplomate (post PhD and licensed certification) in behavioral psychology. =The meaning of certification= BACB is a private non-profit organization without governmental powers to regulate behavior analytic practice. However it does wield the power to suspend or revoke certification from those certified if they violate the strict ethical guidelines of practice. As many states are without a licensure act, this has been sufficient to deter violators as it removes their ability to vendor with the state, schools, and insurance companies under that certification. While the BACB certification means that candidates have satisfied entry-level requirements in behavior analytic training, certificants are able to practice independently within the scope of their practice and training. Thus, a BCBA (such as those who go into marketing, engineering, or other approved fields in which BCBAs work) who has never trained to work nor worked with children diagnosed with autism should not attempt to do so independently. Most health insurance companies also recognize the BCBA credential as one conferring the capability and the right to practice independently in many states (including California with the recent passage of SB 946 into law). Some states still require certificants to be licensed by their respective jurisdictions for independent practice when treating behavioral health or medical problems, and a number of states including Arizona and Nevada have created a specific BCBA licensing program (for a full list please refer to the BACB website). Licensed certificants must operate within the scope of their license and within their areas of expertise. Where the government regulates behavior analytic services, unlicensed certificants may be supervised by a licensed professional and operate within the scope of their supervisor's license when treating disorders if that jurisdiction allows such supervision. Unlicensed certificants who provide behavior analytic training for educational or optimal performance purposes do not require licensed supervision, unless the law or precedent prohibits such practice. Where the government does not regulate the treatment of medical or psychological disorders certificants should practice in accord with the laws of their state, province, or country. All certificants must practice within their personal areas of expertise. =Licensure= The model licensing act for behavior analysts has been revised several times to reflect best practices and policy. Previous versions included provisions that would have made it in practice more difficult then to obtain the necessary experiential hours for license and independent practice as a clinical psychologist.Introduction to the BACB¬Æ Model Act for Licensing Behavior Analysts. Behavior Analyst Certification Board, Inc. February 2009 Once the person is licensed public protection is still monitored by the licensing board as well as the BACB, both of which make sure that the person receives sufficient ongoing education, and the BACB and licensing board investigate ethical complaints. In February 2008, Indiana, Arizona, Massachusetts, Vermont, Oklahoma and other states now have legislation pending to create licensure for behavior analysts. Pennsylvania was the first state in 2008 to license behavior specialists to cover behavior analysts. Arizona, less than three weeks later, became the first state to license behavior analysts. Other states such as Nevada and Wisconsin have also passed behavior analytic licensure. In California, after the defeat of a bill to create a license for BCBAs in 2011, the state government instead passed SB 946 which mandates that all non-governmental insurance agencies reimburse for BCBA for behavior therapy in treating autism, starting in 2012. Unlike many weaker bills mandating that autism be covered by insurance, SB 946 does not currently impose an arbitrary cap on services by age or funding amount ‚Äì in this it is similar to other treatments such as those for heart attacks or other chronic conditions.The full text of SB 946 can be found here: () Service delivery models =Definitions= Behavior analytic services can be and often are delivered through various treatment modalities. These include: * Consultation ‚Äì an indirect model in which the consultant works with the consultee to change the behavior of the client. * Therapy ‚Äì (individual, group, or family) in which the therapist works directly with a person with some form of pathology to lessen the pathology. * Counseling ‚Äì where the counselor works directly with a person who has problems but no pathology. * Coaching ‚Äì in which the coach works with a person to achieve a life goal. =Primary methods= The two primary methods for delivering behavior analytic services are consultation and/or direct therapy; the former involves three parties: consultant, consultee and a client whose behavior is changed (who may or may not be present for all meetings). Consultation can involve working with the consultee (i.e., a parent or teacher) to build a plan around the behavior of a client (i.e., a child or student), or training the consultees themselves to modify the behavior of the client. Within the domain of parent‚Äìchild consultation, standard intervention includes teaching parents skills such as basic reinforcement, time-out and how to manipulate different factors to modify behavior. Direct therapy involves the relationship of behavior analyst and client, usually one-on-one, in which the analyst is responsible for directly modifying the behavior of their client. Direct therapy is also used in schools but can also be found in group homes, in a behavior modification facility and in behavior therapy (where the focus may be on tasks such as quitting smoking, modifying behaviors for sex offenders or other types of offenders, modifying behaviors related to mood disorders) or to encourage job seeking behavior in psychiatric patients. =History of behavior models= Two older and less used models still exist for the delivery of behavior analytic services. These models worked mostly with normal or typically developing populations. These two models are the Behavioral Coaching and the Behavioral Counseling model. Both were very popular in the 1960s‚Äì1980s but have recently seen a decline in popularity, in spite of their success, as proponents argued the merits of holding strictly to learning theory. The Association for Behavior Analysis International still retains a special interest group in behavioral counseling and coaching. =History of behavioral counseling= Behavioral counseling was very popular throughout the 1970s and at least into the early 1980s.Hosford, R. & de Visser, L. (1974) Behavioral approaches to counseling: An introduction. Washington, DC: American Personnel and Guidance Association Press. Behavioral counseling is an active action‚Äìoriented approach that works with the typically developing population but also assists people with specific/discrete problems such as career decision making, drinking, smoking or rehabilitation after injury. =Life coaching= The behavioral coaching model is sometimes referred to as life coaching. However, like counselors and psychologists, life coaches can have varied orientations/change theories (see behavioral change theories). Behavioral life coaches operate mainly from a behavior analytic orientation. Unlike therapy this model is applied to people who desire to achieve a specific goalSimek, T.C. & O'Brien, R.M. (1981). Total golf: A behavioral approach to lowering your score and getting more out of your game. New York, NY: Doubleday. such as increasing their assertiveness with others. This model is educational and is usually presented as an alternative to therapy. Coaches use behavioral techniques such as objective setting, goal setting, self-control training and behavioral activation to help clients achieve specific life goals. Behavioral coaching was sometimes used to teach job skills to people having mental retardation or head injury. In this area the model made extensive use of task analysis, direct instruction, role play, reinforcement and error correction. Often this approach employs techniques of direct instruction. =Goal of increasing reinforcement= Behavioral counseling was largely seen as a growth model that tried to increase the individuals sense of \\"freedom\\" by helping the client reduce punishment or coercion in their lives, build skills, and increase access to reinforcement.Krumboltz, J.D. & Thoreson, C.E. (Eds.). (1969). Behavioral counseling: Cases and techniques. New York: Holt, Rinehart, & Winston. B.F. Skinner created a video discussing the processes involved and the importance of reinforcement to increase the sense of \\"freedom\\". Behavioral counseling attempts to use in-session reinforcement to improve decision- making, functional assessment of the clients problem, and behavioral interventions to reduce problem behaviors. =Social learning in behavioral counseling= Some behavioral counselors approach therapy from a social learning perspective but many held a position based on the use of behavioral psychology with a focus on the use of operant, respondent conditioning procedures. Some who did adopt a position on modeling held closer to the behavioral view of modeling as generalized imitation developed through learning processes. =Weight loss= The behavioral counseling approach became very popular in weight reductionStuart, R.B. (Ed.). (1977). Behavioral self management: Strategies, techniques, and outcomes. New York: Brunner/MazelStuart, R.B. & Davis, B. (1978). Slim Chance in a Fat World: Behavioral Control on Obesity. and is on the American Psychological Association's list of evidence-based practices for weight loss. Behavioral counseling for weight loss by Richard B. Stuart led to the commercial program called Weight Watchers.WeightWatchers.com: About Us Recently, efforts have been made to resurrect interest in behavioral counseling as a method to effectively deliver services to normal problemed populations. Treatment of autism Among the available approaches to treating autism, early intensive behavioral interventions (EIBIs) have demonstrated efficacy in promoting social and language development and in reducing behaviors that interfere with learning and cognitive functioning. In addition, such therapies have led to increased intellectual skills and increased adaptive functioning. Even with past successes, behavior therapists continue to develop models of social skills. =Therapy qualifications= These are generally treatments based on applied behavior analysis (ABA) and involve intensive training of the therapists, extensive time spent in ABA therapy (20‚Äì40 hours per week) and weekly supervision by experienced clinical supervisors‚Äîknown as board certified behavior analysts. ABA therapy often employs principles of overlearning to help acquire mastery and fluency of skills. =Children with autism= The ABA approach teaches many skills such as appropriate play (a precursor to social interaction and engagement with the world and others), social, motor and verbal behaviors as well as reasoning skills and the ability to self-regulate appropriately. ABA therapy is used to teach behaviors to individuals with autism who may not otherwise observe these behaviors spontaneously through imitation. In recent years the ABA approach has been criticized by members of the autistic community. Many have reported suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of being forced to comply with training procedures. =Imitation= Imitation can also be directly trained. ABA therapies teach these skills through use of behavioral observation and reinforcement or prompting to teach each step of a behavior. =Research and treatments= Extensive research exists to show that behavior analysis is an effective treatment for autism with literally hundreds of studies showing its effectiveness with persons of all ages in enhancing functioning, building skills and independence as well as improving life quality. What remains controversial are claims of behavior analysis \\"curing autism\\". This controversy exists because behavior analysis is used to alter rates of behavior, and not the condition of \\"autism.\\" Nonetheless, behavior analysis is used to treat the behaviors of many in the autistic population. While several small studies exist showing that behavior analysis holds promise in this area, the number of well-controlled studies do not rise to the level required by the American Psychological Association to hold the treatment as empirically supported in this area. =Misconceptions of treatment= An increasing amount of research in the field of applied behavior analysis is concerned with autism; and it is a common misconception that behavior analysts work almost exclusively with individuals with autism and that ABA is synonymous with discrete trials teaching. ABA principles can also be used with a range of typical or atypical individuals whose issues vary from developmental delays, significant behavioral problems or undesirable habits. Curriculum development in behavior analytic programs for children with autism is important. Curriculum should carefully task analyze the skill needed to be learned and then ensure that proper tool skills have been taught before the skill itself is attempted to be taught. Applied behavior analysis is often confused as a table-only therapy. Properly performed, applied behavior analysis should be done in both table and natural environments depending on the student's progress and needs. Once a student has mastered a skill at the table the team should move the student into a natural environment for further training and generalization of the skill. Frequently standardized assessments such as the Assessment of Basic Language and Learning Skills (ABLLS) is used to create a baseline of the learner's functional skill set. The ABLLS breaks down the learner's strengths and weaknesses to best tailor the applied behavior analysis curriculum to them. By focusing on the exact skills that need help the teacher does not teach a skill the student knows. This can also prevent student frustration at attempting a skill for which they are not ready. Many families have fought school districts for such programs. Donald Baer, a behavior analyst who often testified as an expert witness, provided several letters to lawyers before he died. Ohio State has archived those letters. =Discrete trials= Discrete trials were originally used by people studying classical conditioning to demonstrate stimulus‚Äìstimulus pairing. Discrete trials are often contrasted with free operant procedures, like ones used by B.F. Skinner in learning experiments with rats and pigeons, to show how learning was influenced by rates of reinforcement. The discrete trials method was adapted as a therapy for developmentally delayed children and individuals with autism. For example, Ole Ivar Lovaas used discrete trials to teach autistic children skills including making eye contact, following simple instructions, advanced language and social skills. These discrete trials involved breaking a behavior into its most basic functional unit and presenting the units in a series. A discrete trial usually consists of the following: the antecedent, the behavior of the student and a consequence. If the student's behavior matches what is desired the consequence is something positive: food, candy, a game, praise, etc. If the behavior was not correct the teacher offers the correct answer then repeats the trial possibly with more prompting, if needed. There is usually an inter-trial interval that allows for a few seconds to separate each trial to allow the student to process the information, teach the student to wait and make the onset of the next trial more discrete. Discrete trials can be used to develop most skills which includes cognitive, verbal communication, play, social and self-help skills. There is a carefully laid out procedure for error correction and a problem solving model to use if the program gets stuck. Discrete trial is sometimes referred to as the Lovaas technique. Discrete trials have been helpful in the treatment of pediatric feeding problems as well as in the prevention of feeding problems. =Free operant procedures= In language training, many free operant procedures emerged in the late 1960s and early 1970s. These procedures did not try to train discrimination first, and then passively wait for generalization, but instead worked from the start on actively promoting generalization. Initially the model was referred to as incidental teaching but later was called milieu language teaching and finally natural language teaching. Peterson (2007) completed a comprehensive review of 57 studies on these training procedures. This review found that 84% of the studies of the natural language procedures looked at maintenance and 94% looked at generalization and were able to provide direct support of its occurrence as part of the training. Other applications of applied behavior analysis =Clinical behavior analysis= Dougher's edited volume titled Clinical Behavior Analysis on Context Press highlights the application of behavior analysis to adult outpatients. He identifies four comprehensive behavior analytic programs: Stephen Hayes et al. acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), Jacobson et al. behavioral activation (BA), Kohlenberg & Tsai's functional analytic psychotherapy, exposure therapies (i.e., Systematic desensitization), and the community reinforcement approach for treating addictions. In addition, the book highlights several recent areas of functional analysis research for common clinical problems. Many of these areas are specified in the section on behavior therapy. =Community reinforcement approach and family training= The study of behavioral factors related to addictions has a long history. Thus it is no surprise many behavioral treatments would be found to be efficacious. One efficacious approach is the community reinforcement approach. The community reinforcement approach has considerable research supporting it as efficacious. Started in the 1970s by Nathan H. Azrin and his graduate student Hunt, the community reinforcement approach is a comprehensive operant program built on a functional assessment of a client's drinking behavior and the use of positive reinforcement and contingency management for nondrinking. When combined with disulfiram (an aversive procedure) community reinforcement showed remarkable effects. One component of the program that appears to be particularly strong is the non- drinking club. Applications of community reinforcement to public policy has become the recent focus of this approach. An offshoot of the community reinforcement approach is the community reinforcement approach and family training. This program is designed to help family members of substance abusers feel empowered to engage in treatment. The rates of success have varied somewhat by study but seem to cluster around 70%. The program uses a variety of interventions based on functional assessment including a module to prevent domestic violence. Partners are trained to use positive reinforcement, various communication skills and natural consequences. =Children with disruptive disorders and parenting= With children, applied behavior analysis provides the core of the positive behavior support movement and creates the basis of Teaching-Family Model homes. Teaching-Family homes have been found to reduce recidivism for delinquent youths both while they are in the homes and after they leave. Operant procedures form the basis of behavioral parent training developed from social learning theorists. The etiological models for antisocial behavior show considerable correlation with negative reinforcement and response matching. Behavioral parent training or Parent Management Training has been very successful in the treatment of conduct disorders in children and adolescents with recent research focusing on making it more culturally sensitive. In addition, behavioral parent training has been shown to reduce corporal or abusive child discipline tactics. Behavior analysts typically adhere to a behavioral model of child development in their practice (see child development). =Recidivism= Recent studies showing that behavior analysis can reduce recidivism have led to a resurgence in behavior therapy facilities. Of particular interest has been the growing research on the Teaching-Family Model which was developed by Montrose Wolf and clearly reduces recidivism rates. In addition, behaviorally-based early intervention programs have shown effectiveness. =Exposure therapy= Methods of counter- conditioning and respondent extinction, called exposure therapy, are often employed by many behavior therapists in the treatment of phobias, anxiety disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and addictions (cue exposure). Prolonged exposure therapy has been particularly helpful with PTSD. Several procedures to block respondent conditioning such as blocking and overshadowing are sometimes used in behavioral medicine to prevent conditioned taste aversion for patients with chemotherapy treatments. Exposure with Response Prevention (ERP) is a respondent extinction procedure often used to treat obsessive‚Äìcompulsive behavior. Escape response blocking is critical for this procedure. For PTSDs exposure therapy is one of the few evidence-based techniques. Recent research suggests exposure therapy is an excellent means of alleviating both the anxiety and cognitive symptoms specific to PTSD with no additive effect for additional cognitive components. Several authors have argued that exposure by itself is necessary and sufficient to produce behavior change in reducing fear in social phobics and helping them engage more effectively with others. The Washington Post ran a story that only exposure therapy is proven for PTSD and that cognitive therapy or even drug therapy are not shown at this time to be effective. =Operant-based EEG biofeedback= Kamiya (1968) demonstrated that the alpha rhythm in humans could be operantly conditioned. He published an influential article in Psychology Today that summarized research showing subjects learn to discriminate when alpha was present or absent, and that they could use feedback to shift the dominant alpha frequency about 1 Hz. Almost half of his subjects reported experiencing a pleasant \\"alpha state\\" characterized as an \\"alert calmness\\". These reports may have contributed to the perception of alpha biofeedback as a shortcut to a meditative state. He also studied the electroencephalography (EEG) correlates of meditative states.Kamiya, J. (1969). Operant control of the EEG alpha rhythm. In C. Tart (Ed.), Altered states of consciousness. NY: Wiley. Operant conditioning of EEG has had considerable support in many areas including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and even seizure disorders. Early studies of the procedure included the treatment of seizure disorders. Luber and colleagues (1981) conducted a double blind crossover study showing that seizure activity decreased by 50% in the contingent conditioning of inhibiting brain waves as opposed to the non-contingent use. Sterman (2000) reviewed 18 studies of a total of 174 clients and found 82% of the participants had significant seizure reduction (30% less weekly seizures). =Organizational= Behavior analysis with organizations is sometimes combined with systems theory in an approach called organizational behavior management. This approach has shown success particularly in the area of behavior-based safety. Behavior safety research has lately become focused on factors that lead programs to being retained in institutions long after the designer leaves. =Educational= Direct instruction and Direct Instruction: the former representing the process and the latter a specific curriculum that highlights that process remain both current and controversial in behavior analysis. The essential features are a carefully structured fast-paced program based on teacher-directed small group instruction. One controversy that remains is that teacher creativity is admonished in the program.Aukerman, R.C. (1984). Approaches to reading. New York: Wiley. Even with such issues to be worked out positive gains in reading for the approach have been reported in the literature since 1968. An example of the positive gains reported by Meyer (1984) found that 34% of children in the DISTAR group were accepted to college as compared to only 17% of the control school. Current research is focused on peer delivery of the program. School-wide positive behavior support is based on the use of behavior analytic procedures delivered in an organizational behavior management approach. School-wide behavioral support has been increasingly accepted by administrators, lawmakers and teachers as a way to improve safety in classrooms.Sugai, G. & Horner, R.H. Schoolwide positive behaviour supports: Achieving and sustaining effective learning environments for all students. In W.L. Hewards, T.E. Heron, N.A. Neef et al. (2005) Focus on behavior analysis in education: Achievements, challenges, and opportunities. Pearson: Merill Precentice Hall. Curriculum-based measurement and curriculum matching is another active area of application. Curriculum- based measurement uses rate and reading performance as the primary variable in determining reading levels. The goal is to better match children to the appropriate curriculum level to remove frustration as well as to track reading performance over time to see if it is improving with intervention. This model also serves as the basis for response to intervention models. Functional behavioral assessment was mandated in the United States for children who meet criteria under the individuals with disabilities education act. This approach has precluded many procedures for modifying and maintaining children in not just the school system, but in many cases in the regular education setting. Even children with severe behavior problems appear to be helped. Teaching children to recruit attention has become a very important area in education. In many cases one function of children's disruptive behavior is to get attention. =Hospital settings= One area of interest in hospitals is the blocking effect‚Äîespecially for conditioned taste aversion. This area of interest is considered important in the prevention of weigh loss during chemotherapy for cancer patients. Another area of growing interest in the hospital setting is the use of operant-based biofeedback with those suffering from cerebral palsy or minor spinal injuries. Brucker's group at the University of Miami has had some success with specific operant conditioning- based biofeedback procedures to enhance functioning.Brucker B. (1980): Biofeedback and rehabilitation. In L.P. Ince (Ed.). Behavioral Psychology in Rehabilitation Medicine: Clinical Applications. Baltimore: Williams and Wilkins, 188‚Äì217.Miller N. & Brucker B. (1981): A learned visceral response apparently independent of skeletal ones in patients paralyzed by spinal lesions. In D. Shapiro, J. Stoyva, J. Kamiya, T.X. Barber, N.E. Miller & G.E. Schwartz (Eds.). Biofeedback and behavioral medicine. Hawthorne, NY: Aldine, 355‚Äì372 While such methods are not a cure, and gains tend to be in the moderate range, they do show ability to help remaining central nervous system cells to regain some control over lost areas of functioning. =Residential treatment= Behavioral interventions have been very helpful in reducing problem behaviors in residential treatment centers. The type of residential versus mental retardation does not appear to be a factor. Behavioral interventions have been found to be successful even when medication interventions fail. =Space program= Probably one of the most interesting applications of behavior analysis in the 1960s was its contribution to the space program. Research in this area is used to train astronauts including the chimpanzees sent into space. Continued work in this area focuses on ensuring that astronauts who live in confined areas and space do not develop behavioral health problems. Most of this work was led by pioneer behaviorist Joseph V. Brady. Consumer and professional relationships Open communication and a supportive relationship between educational systems and families allow the student to receive a beneficial education. This pertains to typical learners as well as to individuals who need additional services. It was not until the 1960s that researchers began exploring behavior analysis as a method to educate those children who fall somewhere along the autism spectrum. Behavior analysts agree that consistency in and out of the school classroom is key in order for children with autism to maintain proper standing in school and continue to develop to their greatest potential. Applied behavior analysts sometimes work with a team to address a person's educational or behavioral needs. Other professionals such as speech therapists, physicians and the primary caregivers are treated as key to the implementation of successful therapy in the applied behavior analysis (ABA) model. The ABA method relies on behavior principles to develop treatments appropriate for the individual. Regular meetings with professionals to discuss programming are one way to establish a successful working relationship between a family and their school. It is beneficial when a caregiver can conduct generalization procedures outside of school. In the ABA framework, developing and maintaining a structured working relationship between parents or guardians and professionals is essential to ensure consistent treatment. Intervention goals When working directly with clients, behavior analysts engage in a process of collaborative goal setting. Goal setting ensures that the client is already under stimulus control of the goal and is thus more likely to engage in behavior to achieve it.Martin, G. & Paer, J. (2007). Behavior Modification: What it is and how to do it. 7th Ed. Behavior analytic programs are ultimately skill building, they enhance functioning, lead to higher quality of life, and build self-control.Alberto, P. & Troutman (2005). Applied Behavior Analysis for Teachers (7th Eds) One of the most distinguishing features of behavior analysis has been its core belief that all individuals have a right to the most effective treatment for their condition. and a right to the most effective educational strategy available.http://www.abainternational.org/ABA/statements/education.asp History Applied behavior analysis is the applied side of the experimental analysis of behavior. It is based on the principles of operant and respondent conditioning and represents a major approach to behavior therapies. Its origin can be traced back to Teodoro Ayllon and Jack Michael's 1959 article \\"The psychiatric nurse as a behavioral engineer\\" as well as to initial efforts to implement teaching machines. The research basis of ABA can be found in the theoretical work of behaviorism and radical behaviorism originating with the work of B.F. Skinner. In 1968 Baer, Wolf and Risley wrote an article that was the source of contemporary applied behavior analysis providing the criteria to judge the adequacy of research and practice in applied behavior analysis. It became the core and centerpiece behavioral engineering. Work in respondent conditioning (what some would term classical conditioning) began with the work of Joseph Wolpe in the 1960s. It was improved by the work of Edna B Foa who did extensive research on exposure and response prevention for obsessive‚Äìcompulsive disorder (OCD). In addition, she worked on exposure therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder. Over the years most behavior analysts have existed and conducted research in many areas and University departments: behavior analysis, psychology, special education, regular education, speech‚Äìlanguage pathology, communication disorders, school psychology, criminal justice and family life. They have belonged to many organizations including the American Psychological Association (APA) and have most often found a core intellectual home in the Association for Behavior Analysis International. =Current research= Behavior analysis remains one of the most active research areas in all of psychology, developmental disability, mental health and other studies of human behavior. Current research in behavior analysis focuses on expanding the tradition by looking at setting events, behavioral activation, the Matching law, relational frame theory, stimulus equivalences and covert conditioning as exemplified in Skinner's model of rule-governed behavior Verbal Behavior. =Experimental psychopathology= Experimental psychopathology is a behavior therapy area in which animal models are developed to simulate human pathology. For example, Wolpe studied cats to build his theory of human anxiety. This work continues today in the study of both pathology and treatment. Historical controversies Initially, applied behavior analysis used punishment such as shouting and slaps to reduce unwanted behaviors. Ethical opposition to such aversive practices caused them to fall out of favor and has stimulated development of less aversive methods. In general, aversion therapy and punishment are now less frequently used as ABA treatments due to legal restrictions. However, procedures such as odor aversion, covert sensitization and other covert conditioning procedures, based on punishment or aversion strategies, are still used effectively in the treatment of pedophiles. In addition, with some populations such as conduct disorder in children there is considerable evidence that has developed to show that all positive programs can produce change but that children will not enter into the normal range without punishment procedures.Patterson, G.R.; Reid, J. & Eddy, J.M. (2002). A brief history of the Oregon Model. In J.B. Reid, G.R. Patterson & J. Snyder. Antisocial behavior in children and adolescents: A developmental analysis and model for intervention. APA Press. Page 6. Walker, H.M.; Colvin, G. & Ramsey, E. (1995). Antisocial behavior in schools: Strategies and best practices. Brookes These programs have shifted to using child time-out and response‚Äìcost procedures to ensure that clients rights to effective interventions are met. =Homosexuality= In 1973 the APA removed homosexuality from its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual yet it kept \\"ego dystonic\\" homosexuality as a condition until the DSM III-R (1987). In 1974 Ole Ivar Lovaas, pioneer of the use of discrete trial teaching (DTT) to treat autism, was the second author on a journal article describing the use of ABA to reduce \\"feminine\\" behaviors and increase \\"masculine\\" behaviors of a male child in an effort to prevent adult transsexualism. Treatments designed to uphold traditional sex-role behaviors were opposed by some behavior analysts who argued that the intervention was not justified. In the late 1960s Wolpe refused to treat homosexual behavior arguing that it was easier and more productive to treat the religious guilt than the homosexuality. He instead provided assertiveness training to a homosexual client. Most behavior analysts and behavior therapists have not worked in sexual re‚Äìorientation therapy since Gerald Davison argued that the issue was not one of effectiveness but of ethics. When he wrote the paper presenting this position, Davison was president of the Association for the Advancement of Behavior Therapy, now the Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies, and thus his views carried much weight. Davison argued that homosexuality is not pathological and is only a problem if it is regarded as one by society and the therapist. Ethical practice =Punishment and aversion therapies= The use of punishment and aversion therapy procedures are a constant ethical challenge for behavior analysts. One of the original reasons for the development of the Behavior Analyst Certification Board were cases of abuse from behaviorists.Bailey, J.S. & Burch, M.R. (2005). Ethics for behavior analysts. LEA Both continue to draw proponents and opposition, however, in some of the more controversial cases some middle ground has been found through legislation (see Judge Rotenberg Educational Center). =Sex offenders and recidivism= A study in 1991 showed that behavior modification was effective in sex offender treatment and covert sensitization, and it has been shown to have some effects on reducing recidivism. However Gene Able, who has done extensive research in this area, suggests that it is not as effective outside of the package which contains odor aversion, satiation therapy (masturbatory reconditioning), and various social skills training programs including empathy training. Current behavior analysis programs offer this type of comprehensive treatment approach. In addition they use a combination of functional assessment, behavior chain analysis and risk assessment to create relapse prevention strategies and to help the offender to develop better self- control. With sex offenders who have retardation, comprehensive behavioral programming has been effective at least in the short run. This treatment included formal academic and vocational training, sex education, a unit token economy, and individual behavior therapy including sexual reconditioning. In addition it included supported competitive employment, fading of program structure, and increased community participation. Journals There are multiple journals which produce articles on the clinical applications of applied behavior analysis. The most popular, and widely used, of these journals is the Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis. There are many other journals dedicated to this field. Some of these include The Behavior Analyst Today, the International Journal of Behavioral Consultation and Therapy and three new journals scheduled for release in 2008: Behavior Analysis in Sports, Health, Fitness and Behavioral Medicine, the Journal of Behavior Analysis in Crime and Victim: Treatment and Prevention as well as the Association for Behavior Analysis International's Behavior Analysis in Practice. Professional organizations The Association for Behavior Analysis International has a special interest group for practitioner issues, behavioral counseling, and clinical behavior analysis. The Association for Behavior Analysis International has larger special interest groups for autism and behavioral medicine. The Association for Behavior Analysis International serves as the core intellectual home for behavior analysts. The Association for Behavior Analysis International sponsors multiple conferences/year, including the annual conference, annual autism conference, biannual international conference, and other conferences on specific issues such as behavioral theory and sustainability. The Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies (ABCT) also has an interest group in behavior analysis, which focuses on clinical behavior analysis. In addition, the Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies has a special interest group on addictions. Doctoral level behavior analysts who are psychologists belong to the American Psychological Association's division 25: Behavior analysis. APA offers a diplomate in behavioral psychology.

Prior to the consolidation of Wallachia, waves of nomadic peoples ‚Äì the last of them being the Cumans and the Mongols ‚Äì rode across the territory.Pop 1999, p. 30. The territory became a frontier area between the Golden Horde (the westernmost part of the Mongol Empire) and the Kingdom of Hungary after 1242.V√°s√°ry 2005, pp. 144, 148. The Romanians in Muntenia, east of the Olt River, had to pay tribute to the Mongols; and west of the river, in Oltenia, they were oppressed by the Bans of Severin, appointed by the Kings of Hungary.V√°s√°ry 2005, p. 148. The Golden Horde's domination decreased in the region at the end of the 13th century, and at that time the Kingdom of Hungary also underwent a strong political crisis.SƒÉlƒÉgean 2006, p. 193. These events enabled the incipient states of the territory to consolidate their autonomy. One Romanian tradition records that Wallachia was founded when a certain Radu Negru (‚ÄòRadu the Black‚Äô) arrived from the FƒÉgƒÉra»ô region in the 1290s after crossing the Transylvanian Alps with \\"a great many following him\\".Sedlar 1994, p. 24.RƒÉdvan 2009, p. 48. Jean W. Sedlar wrote that \\"more credible\\" is the report that some Romanian lords in the Olt and Arge»ô valleys chose as leader one of their number, a certain Basarab. It was Voivode Basarab I (c. 1310‚Äì1352) who broke off with the Kingdom of Hungary and refused to accept the king's suzerainty. Basarab I received international support and the recognition of the autonomy of Wallachia due to his great military victory over King Charles I of Hungary (1301‚Äì1342) at Posada on November 12, 1330.Engel 2001, p. 434. The Metropolitan See of Wallachia, directly subordinated to the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, was set up during the reign of Basarab I's son, Nicolae Alexandru (1352‚Äì1364).Pop 1999, p. 46.Georgescu 1991, p. 33. The first silver and bronze coins were minted in Wallachia in 1365.Georgescu 1991, p. 27. Last centuries of the Early Middle Ages Among the oldest attestations of the countries of the Vlachs (early Romanians) on the left side of the Danube, there is a quotation of a passage from an Armenian book of geography.Spinei 2009, p. 50. The passage represents an interpolation, probably from the first centuries of the second millennium, which refers to an \\"unknown country called Balak\\", situated in the neighborhood of the \\"Sarmatians‚Äô country\\" and of \\"Zagura\\" (Bulgaria).Spinei 2009, pp. 50‚Äì51. Another 11th-century reference to the Vlachs‚Äô country appears to be the section of the ancient Turkic chronicle Oghuzname ('Oghuz Khan's Tale'), preserved in a 17th-century text, which narrates the battles of the Cumans against several peoples, including the Vlachs (Ulak).Spinei 2009, p. 81.Curta 2006, p. 306. The Cumans, a Turkic tribe approached the Danube Delta shortly after 1064‚Äì1065, and from 1068 the entire territory between the Aral Sea and the lower Danube were controlled by them.Spinei 2009, pp. 114., 116‚Äì117. But this vast territory was never politically united by a strong central power.V√°s√°ry 2005, p. 7. The different Cuman groups were under independent rulers or khans who meddled in the political life of the surrounding areas, such as the Rus‚Äô principalities and the Byzantine Empire. In attacking the Byzantine Empire, the Cumans were also assisted by the Vlachs living in the Balkan Mountains (now in Bulgaria) who showed them the mountain paths where no imperial guard was set up.V√°s√°ry 2005, p. 21. In 1185, the Balkan Vlachs, together with the Bulgarians, rose up in arms against the Byzantine Empire.Pop 1999, p. 40. They created, with the help of the Cumans and the Vlachs living on the left bank of the Danube, a new state, the Second Bulgarian Empire between the Balkan Mountains and the Danube (to the south of the future Wallachia). The new state was called \\"Bulgaria and Vlachia\\" in Western sources.V√°s√°ry 2005, pp. 29‚Äì30. For example, in 1204 the pope elevated the head of the Bulgarian church to the rank of \\"primas\\" (primate) \\"of all Bulgaria and Vlachia\\".Dimitrov 2007, p. 52. Vlachia as an exonym for northern Bulgaria only disappeared from the sources after the middle of the 13th century.V√°s√°ry 2005, p. 31. In 1211, King Andrew II of Hungary (1205‚Äì1235) settled the Teutonic Knights in the region of Bra»ôov in order to put an end to the frequent incursions of the Cumans into Transylvania.Engel 2001, pp. 90., 431.Spinei 2009, p. 146. The knights were given all the territory they could conquer beyond the Carpathian Mountains as a fief to be held from the king of Hungary.Engel 2001, p. 90. According to a royal charter of 1222, the knights‚Äô military power stretched across the Carpathians all the way to the Danube.Spinei 2005, p. 417. That the Teutonic Knights won several victories \\"beyond the snowy mountains\\" (ultra montes nivium), that is to the south and to the east of the Carpathians, is also confirmed by papal letters. However, the Teutonic Knights were forced out of the territory in 1225 by King Andrew II, who claimed that they had ignored his authority.Spinei 2005, p. 418. The Mongols entered Europe in 1223 when they defeated a joint Rus‚Äô-Cuman army at the river Kalka (now in Ukraine).Korobeinikov 2005, p. 388. Some Cuman groups, after their defeat of the Mongols, become willing to adopt Christianity.Engel 2001, p. 95.Spinei 2005, p. 427. As early as 1227, one of the Cuman chieftains, Boricius subjected himself and his people to the future King B√©la IV of Hungary, converted to Christianity and agreed to pay an annual tax and the tithe.Spinei 2005, p. 423. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Cumania, located in northeastern Wallachia and southwestern Moldavia, was established in 1228.Spinei 2005, pp. 426., 436 A significant presence of the Vlachs within the newly established bishopric is documented in the correspondence between the Hungarian crown prince and Pope Gregory IX (1227‚Äì1241), as the pope complained about Orthodox prelates active among the local Vlachs.Curta 2006, p. 352. Mongol warrior on horseback, preparing a mounted archery shot. The Diocese of Cumania was de jure a part of the Kingdom of Hungary, and King Andrew II adopted the title of \\"king of Cumania\\" in 1233.Spinei 2005, p. 432. There can be no doubt that the king also placed garrisons at key points on the southern slopes of the Carpathian Mountains in northeastern Wallachia.V√°s√°ry 2005, p. 138. But the military outposts in the region of the bishopric are only first mentioned in relation to the Mongol invasion of 1241 by Roger of Torre Maggiore. In parallel with the emergence of the Second Bulgarian Empire, the Kingdom of Hungary also persuaded an active expansionist policy in the Balkan Peninsula from the end of the 12th century.V√°s√°ry 2005, p. 136. To that end, Oltenia was put under the control of a Hungarian governor, who received the title of ban.Spinei 2005, p. 421.V√°s√°ry 2005, p. 146. The centre of the new province (the Banate of Severin) was Fort Severin (now Drobeta-Turnu Severin, Romania), on the Danube, in the vicinity of the Iron Gates. Its first ban, Luke, was mentioned in 1233. In 1236 a large Mongol army was collected under the supreme leadership of Batu Khan and set forth to the west, in one of the greatest invasions in world's history.Korobeinikov 2005, p. 390.Spinei 2009, p. 166. The Mongols‚Äô most devastating attacks against the western territories of the Desht-i Quipchaq (‚Äòthe steppe of the Cumans‚Äô) took place in 1237‚Äì1238.Spinei 2009, p. 38. The development of the battles was not recorded in the sources, but the Cuman's subsequent migration to Hungary, Bulgaria and other neighboring territories is eloquent enough.Spinei 2009, p. 167. Although some Cuman groups survived the Mongol invasion, the Cuman aristocracy was slain.Korobeinikov 2005, p. 406. The steppes of eastern Europe were conquered by Batu Khan's army and became parts of the Golden Horde. But the Mongols left no garrisons or military detachments in the lower Danube region and did not take direct political control of it.Curta 2006, p. 413. Although theoretically part of the Golden Horde, the steppe corridor between the Dnieper River and the lower Danube was only a \\"region of hegemony\\", not of direct control. Earliest voivodates in medieval documents After the Mongol invasion, a great many (if not most) of the Cuman population left the Wallachian Plain, but the Vlach (Romanian) population remained there under the leadership of their local chiefs, called knezes and voivodes.V√°s√°ry 2005, p. 144. In 1247, King B√©la IV tried to bring the Knights Hospitallers to the region and granted to them a number of territories in the \\"land of Severin\\".Pop 1999, p. 44.Curta 2006, p. 407. The knights‚Äô mission, however, proved to be a total failure (there is even no report whether they occupied their posts), but the royal charter for the knights, dated June 2, 1247, lists four autonomous territorial-administrative units (kenezates) in Oltenia and western Muntenia.V√°s√°ry 2005, p. 147. Two of them, the kenezates of Johannes and Farca≈ü were given to the Knights Hospitallers. But the kenezates under Litovoi and Seneslau were exempted from the grant, and the royal charter expressly stipulated that they were to be left \\"to the Vlachs as they had owned it until now\\". On the other hand, the royal charter also describes that Voivode Litovoi's rule had extended on the northern side of the Transylvanian Alps into the Hunedoara region, but the king removed this territory from Litovoi's authority in 1247; thenceforward Litovoi's kenezate was restricted to the Oltenian part of the Jiu valley.Curta 2006, pp. 407‚Äì408. Voivode Seneslau held the territories of central and southern Muntenia on the banks of the rivers Arge»ô and D√¢mbovi»õa.Georgescu 1991, p. 16. After the failure and disappearance of the Hospitallers, the history of the region is shrouded in obscurity for decades. But the trend toward the unification of the Romanian polities seems to begin with Voivode Litovoi. He (or his namesake son) was at war with the Hungarians and killed in battle sometime between 1270 and 1280. In the battle, his brother, BƒÉrbat was captured. BƒÉrbat was forced not only to pay ransom but also to recognize Hungarian rule. 'Dismounting' by Radu Negru Romanian chronicles written in the 17th century narrate that a her»õeg or duke of FƒÉgƒÉra»ô and Alma»ô, named Radu Negru (‚ÄòRadu the Black‚Äô) or Negru VodƒÉ (‚ÄòThe Black Voivode‚Äô) was the first voivode of Wallachia.BrƒÉtianu 1980, p. 87. These texts state that Radu Negru, together with some colonists (\\"Romanians, Catholics and Saxons\\") arrived from the region of FƒÉgƒÉra≈ü in Transylvania.BrƒÉtianu 1980, pp. 93., 102. The first documentary evidence for a terra Blacorum (‚Äòland of the Vlachs‚Äô) on the territory later called FƒÉgƒÉra»ô is an early 13th-century property register which mentions the order of King Andrew II of Hungary that estates previously in Vlach hands be transferred to the Cistercian abbey at C√¢r»õa.Curta 2006, p. 354.Engel 2001, p. 119. Radu Negru and his followers crossed the Carpathians to Muntenia and founded Wallachia with its capitals in C√¢mpulung and Curtea de Arge»ô. The chronicles narrate these events under the year 1290 or 1292. The Romanian term for the \\"founding\\" (descƒÉlecat, literally ‚Äòdismounting‚Äô) refers to this alleged settling in Wallachia.BrƒÉtianu 1980, p. 93. But the word's exact meaning is debated, since there had been Romanians living in Wallachia before Radu Negru's arrival; thus the term likely refers simply to the unification of the lands under one ruler. Moreover, this account of Radu Negru's ‚Äòdismounting‚Äô may merely be a legend subsequently invented to parallel the circumstances by which Moldavia, the other Romanian principality was founded according to the earliest chronicles.Treptow, Popa 1996, p. 135. The origin of Oltenia is given by some of the chronicles differently: according to these chronicles Oltenia was colonized by Romanians from Turnu Severin, who founded two other capitals, at Strehaia and Craiova.BrƒÉtianu 1980, pp. 102‚Äì103. After the arrival of Radu Negru and his descƒÉlecat, these Romanians swore allegiance to him. Radu Negru's personality is surrounded by legend; no details about him can be proved by other historical sources.BrƒÉtianu 1980, p. 90. Some chronicles identify him with the founder of various churches, such as the monastery at Curtea de Arge»ô, but they mistake him for later voivodes of Wallachia, such as Radu I (c. 1377‚Äìc. 1383) and Neagoe Basarab (1512‚Äì1521).Treptow, Popa 1996, pp. xvii‚Äìxviii. Due to lack of any actual contemporary evidence, the Roman historian Nicolae Iorga doubted the existence of such a voivode, considering that 'Negru VodƒÉ' is simply a nickname that could have been given to Basarab I, the real founder of Wallachia. Other view is represented by Neagu Djuvara who identifies Negru VodƒÉ with Thocomerius, Basarab's father, explaining his nickname by his alleged Cuman descent: he appeared to have a dark skin color for the Romanians.Djuvara 2007 In an interview, historian Ioan-Aurel Pop stated, Djuvara \\"is not a specialist in the field of medieval history\\" and his \\"Cumanian theory\\" is questionable. The legendary traditions may also be in connection with the establishment of a trans-Carpathian frontier mark by the Hungarian monarchy, with its capital at C√¢mpulung, probably in the last decade of the 13th century. A tomb stone belonging to one of the leaders of this formation, Count Lawrence of C√¢mpulung (comes Laurentius de Longo Campo), dating from the year 1300, may provide a solid chronological reference point. On the other hand, comes Laurentius may have been a one-time leader of the Saxon community in C√¢mpulung.RƒÉdvan 2009, p. 50. FƒÉgƒÉra»ô Castle (, ) The Princely Church in Curtea de Arge≈ü Basarab I the Founder The Battle of Posada in the Chronicon Pictum Basarab was the son of Thocomerius whose status cannot be specified. There is no direct clue in the sources to the date when Basarab took the office of voivode.V√°s√°ry 2005, p. 149. But Ioannes Kantakouzenos in his History narrates that in 1323 Basarab's armies joined in the fighting between Bulgaria and Byzantium and supported Tzar Michael ≈†i≈°man of Bulgaria (1323‚Äì1330) against the Byzantines.V√°s√°ry 2005, p. 150. In a diploma, dated July 26, 1324, King Charles I of Hungary refers to Basarab as \\"our voivode of Wallachia\\" (woiuodam nostrum Transalpinum) which indicates that at that time Basarab was a vassal of the king of Hungary. In short time, however, Basarab refused to accept the suzerainty of the king, for neither Basarab's growing power nor the active foreign policy he was conducting on his own account to the south could be acceptable in Hungary. In a new diploma, dated June 18, 1325, King Charles I mentions him as \\"Basarab of Wallachia, unfaithful to the king's Holy Crown\\" (Bazarab Transalpinum regie corone infidelem). Hoping to punish Basarab, King Charles I mounted a military campaign against him in 1330. The king marched to Severin and took it from Basarab.V√°s√°ry 2005, p. 154. The voivode asked for a truce, offering to refund 7,000 silver marks for the costs of the army, and showed himself ready to continue paying tribute to the king and send his son as a hostage to the royal court. But the king refused and advanced with his host into Wallachia where everything seemed to have been laid waste. Unable to subdue Basarab, the king ordered the retreat through the mountains. But in a long and narrow valley, the Hungarian army was attacked by the Romanians, who had taken up positions on the heights. The battle, called the Battle of Posada, lasted for four days (November 9‚Äì12, 1330) and was a disaster for the Hungarians whose defeat was devastating. The king was only able to escape with his life by exchanging his royal coat of arms with one of his retainers. The Battle of Posada was a turning point in Hungarian-Wallachian relations: though in the course of the 14th century, the kings of Hungary still tried to regulate the voivodes of Wallachia more than one time, but they could only succeed temporarily. Thus Basarab's victory irretrievably opened the way to independence for the Principality of Wallachia. Aftermath of the Battle of Posada The international prestige of Wallachia increased considerably after Basarab's victory over King Charles I. Only a few months after his great victory, in February 1331, Basarab contributed to the establishment of his son-in-law, Ivan Alexander (1331‚Äì1371) on the throne of the tzars of Bulgaria in Tarnovo.SƒÉlƒÉgean 2006, p. 195. Basarab royal dynasty. As a way of solemnizing his secession from the Kingdom of Hungary, Basarab's son, Nicolae Alexandru also sought Byzantine approval for the creation of an Orthodox see for his territories.Angold 2006, p. 26. In 1359 Byzantium acceded to his request that the displaced metropolitan of Vicina, Hyakinthos ‚Äì whom Nicolae Alexander had been hosting at his court for some time ‚Äì should become the \\"legitimate pastor of all Oungrovlachia for the blessing and spiritual direction of himself, his children and all his lordship\\". At the same time, Byzantium also agreed to the creation of a metropolitan see, after Hyakinthos‚Äô death, for \\"all Oungrovlachia\\". The new state was denoted as Oungrovlachia () in Byzantine sources which reflects that it bordered on the Kingdom of Hungary.V√°s√°ry 2005, p. 142. This name is first encountered in a Greek diploma issued by the synod of the Patriarchate of Constantinople in 1370. In the diploma, the ruler of Wallachia, Nicolae Alexandru is styled \\"great voivode and master of all Oungrovlachia\\". Latin documents used the term Wallachia or Wallachia maior (‚ÄòGreater Wallachia‚Äô) for Muntenia (which first appeared in 1373), and Wallachia minor (‚ÄòLesser Wallachia‚Äô) for Oltenia (first recorded in 1377). The new country was identified as terra transalpina (‚Äòland beyond the mountains‚Äô) or partes transalpinae (‚Äòparts beyond the mountains‚Äô) in documents issued by the Royal Chancellery of Hungary in the entire 14th century.RƒÉdvan 2009, p. 47.V√°s√°ry 2005, p. 143. The terminology of the Hungarian chancellery was also used in the Latin documents of the Wallachian voivodes. The Romanian rulers chose the Byzantine model of government, and Wallachia was from the start an absolute monarchy.Georgescu 1991, pp. 33‚Äì34. The princes' absolute power was held to be divinely ordained.Georgescu 1991, p. 34. Their correspondence and records used the expression \\"By the Grace of God\\" from the 14th century. Wallachian sovereigns were host commanders and supreme judges, they patronized the church and made decisions that became laws.Pop 1999, p. 51. In theory, the voivodes were considered proprietors of all the lands in the country, but in fact they were devoid of extensive personal land holdings.Sedlar 1994, p. 260. The monarchy was also dynastic: the princes were to be elected by boyars from among the members of the ruling family, the Basarabs. The boyars were the members of the privileged landed aristocracy.Treptow, Popa 1996, p. 46. However, the origin of the Romanian boyar class is problematic: it may have evolved naturally from the heads of the Vlach villages and communities, but it is also possible that the princes created it by granting privileges to certain favored persons.Sedlar 1994, p. 59. Multiple vassalage became an important aspect of Romanian diplomacy after the Christian Balkan states (Bulgaria, Serbia) one by one fell to the Ottoman Empire in the course the second half of the 14th century.Georgescu 1991, p. 47. For example, Mircea the Elder (1386‚Äì1418) accepted the suzerainty of Poland in 1387 and that of Hungary in 1395, and Wallachia was paying tribute to the Ottoman Empire from 1417.Georgescu 1991, p. 48. When accepting Hungarian suzerainty, the princes of Wallachia usually also received the district of FƒÉgƒÉra≈ü in Transylvania from the Hungarian monarchs, for example in 1366 King Louis I of Hungary (1342‚Äì1382) granted the region to Prince Vladislav I of Wallachia (1364‚Äì1377), with the title of duke, and Prince Mircea the Elder received it from King Sigismund (1387‚Äì1437).Treptow, Popa 1996, p. xvii.Engel 2001, pp. 165, 232., 442. During the reign of Mircea the Elder, Dobruja also became part of Wallachia before it was annexed to the Ottoman Empire.Treptow, Popa 1996, p. 89.

The castle suffered many fights and damages, and finally surrendered to Saladdin in 1188, namely to his son Alzaher Alghazi in 1194. It was later restored by Baibars in 1269, then it was controlled by Sunqur al- Ashqar in 1280, before it was retaken by Qalawun in 1285. The castle was hit by a strong earthquake in 1408, in which it was considerably damaged and abandoned. The castle is damaged totally and is being restored now. The outer walls are surrounding the bulk massive of the castle; there are cisterns, underground rooms and remnants of premises in the middle, plus are visible some arches and towers.

Opened in 1969, it operated for only four years. The name and theme of the park came from nearby Lincoln City. A popular restaurant there was named Pixie Kitchen, which opened in 1930 and had the slogan \\"Heavenly Food on the Oregon Coast\\". Jerry Parks and his wife Lu Parks ran Pixie Kitchen and announced in 1967 the vision of Pixieland as a \\"Fairytale Story of Oregon.\\" The park opened on June 28, 1969 with a dedication from Governor Tom McCall to the \\"families of Oregon\\". More than $800,000 was invested, including two public stock offerings. Pixieland hired two former Disneyland employees: the director of music and director of special promotions. Rides included a narrow gaugeLagoon is Fun - Merriweather train called Little Toot (later renamed Little Pixie) and a log flume. Entertainment was found at the Blue Bell Opera House where melodramas were performed. Other buildings and attractions included the Main Street Arcade, the Print Shop, The Shootout, and the Darigold Cheese Barn. Eating places included Fisher Scones and Franz Bread Rest Hut. A 1975 headline in the Oregon Journal declared \\"Pixieland Dream Goes 'Poof!': Dreams of a multimillion dollar fantasy world shattered into a fiscal nightmare.\\" After the park closed, the rides were sold and the buildings demolished. The Little Pixie (renamed Merriweather) and log flume rides were sold to Lagoon amusement park where they still operate today. For several decades, the Pixieland site was an RV park which transitioned into a trailer home park. Today, a tide-gate house with a pink painted roof is the only trace of Pixieland. Since the early 1980s, Siuslaw National Forest has been under mandate to restore the Salmon River estuary conditions which development of Pixieland partially disrupted with creek diversions and dikes. The site is now being transformed back into its original wetland state.

The men of the Peoria Party were among the first pioneers to blaze the Oregon Trail.  Overview  The fall before the Peoria Party began the long journey to Oregon, Rev. Jason Lee had visited Peoria on a national speaking tour about the Oregon country and moving westward. He recruited sixteen men at the start, but would pick up three more volunteers on the trail - bringing their largest number to nineteen. They organized themselves in military fashion, adopting the name \\"Oregon Dragoons\\" and elected Thomas J. Farnham as their captain. They carried with them a large flag, a gift from Mrs. Farnham, emblazoned with their motto, \\"Oregon or the grave.\\" The expedition ran into many obstacles and hardships. Rain fell continuously and the going was very rough over unforgiving land. Food rationing became necessary and each man was limited to a daily food allotment of one-quarter cup of flour, mixed with water, and fried in bacon fat. Some members of the group quit and headed back to Peoria. The men began to argue and bicker over leadership, which culminated in a near fatal accident a month later causing the eventual dissolution of the Peoria Party. Sidney Smith, a member of the party, was also accidentally shot and severely wounded during another heated argument. On July 5, 1839, the remaining members of the Peoria Party reached Bent's Fort, a trading post on the South Fork of the Platte River. Farnham was deposed as leader and the group split up officially. Nine of the original nineteen eventually made it to Oregon - the rest of the group either returned to Peoria or headed in other directions. Members of the Oregon Dragoons *Thomas Jefferson Farnham, age 35. A Peoria lawyer who organized and was elected captain of the Peoria Party. He was deposed as leader during the trip and arrived in Oregon in the fall of 1839. He stayed only a few weeks and returned to the United States with a petition signed by sixty Oregonians asking the U.S. Government to take possession of the territory. His account of the adventure, \\"Travels in the Great Western Prairies\\", was published in both the U.S. and Britain and did much to create interest in immigration to Oregon. Farnham was born in Vermont in 1804 and died in San Francisco September 13, 1848. *Amos Cook, age 23. After the group dissolved he wintered at Brown's Hole with his friends and companions Francis Fletcher, Joseph Holman, and Ralph Kilbourne all of whom completed the journey together. They arrived at Fort Vancouver on June 1, 1840, thirteen months after leaving Peoria. Cook took a Donation Land Claim in Yamhill County and voted to form a provisional government at Champoeg on May 2, 1843. Cook was born January 8, 1816 in Maine. He was the last surviving member of the Peoria Party when he died at his home near Dayton, Oregon on February 3, 1895. *Francis Fletcher, age 25. He arrived at Fort Vancouver accompanied by Amos Cook, Joseph Holman, and Ralph Kilbourne. He took a Donation Land Claim in Yamhill County next to his lifelong friend Amos Cook.

Fletcher was born in Yorkshire, England on March 1, 1814 and died at his home near Dayton on October 7, 1871. *Joseph Holman, age 24. He was a cooper by trade and made saddles and gunstocks while wintering at Brown's Hole, which he traded for a horse and supplies. His constant companions on the journey were Amos Cook, Francis Fletcher, and Ralph Kilbourne. Holman settled in Marion County and voted for the Provisional Government at Champoeg. He was an original trustee of Willamette University. Holman was born August 20, 1815 in Devonshire, England and died at his home near Salem, Oregon on June 25, 1880. *Ralph L. Kilbourne, age 29. He was a Peoria restaurant keeper who made the entire journey with Amos Cook, Francis Fletcher, and Joseph Holman. In Oregon he helped build the clipper ship Star of Oregon with which he sailed to California in 1841 and settled. Kilbourne was born in Pennsylvania in June 1810 and died in Rutherford, California September 25, 1879. *Robert Shortess, age 42. A former schoolteacher who joined the Peoria Party in Independence, Missouri. He replaced Farnham as captain but chose to go it alone rather than spend the winter at Brown's Hole with his remaining men. He arrived in Oregon in 1840 and became radically anti-British. He voted for the Provisional Government at Champoeg. He finally settled in Clatsop County where he was elected judge and held several other political posts. Born in Pennsylvania in 1797, Shortess died at his home in Astoria, Oregon May 4, 1878. *Sidney Smith, age 30. Although Smith was severely wounded by an accidental gunshot he was the first member of the Peoria Party to make it to Oregon, arriving on September 3, 1839. He became a wealthy rancher and made $3,000 in the California gold fields. He voted for the Provisional Government at Champoeg. Smith was born in Amsterdam, New York on October 2, 1809. He died on September 18, 1880 at his home in Lafayette, Oregon. *Robert Moore, age 58.

Born in Kentucky, Blair made it through to Oregon in 1839 but later moved to California. *Chauncey Wood. Originally from New York, he was elected lieutenant of the Oregon Dragoons in Independence. He left the party at Bent's Fort after it was split between Farnham and Shortess. He headed for New Mexico accompanied by John Pritchel. *John Pritchel, age about 35. A tailor originally from England, Pritchel headed for New Mexico with Chauncey Wood. *Obadiah A. Oakley, age 32. He was voted out of the group along with Farnham and Smith. He joined Paul Richardson's company of trappers and traders at Brown's Hole. Oakley was born June 15, 1807 in New York and died May 31, 1850 in California. *Joseph Wood. A native of England, Wood also joined Richardson's company at Brown's Hole. *Quinn Jordan. Also an Englishman by birth, he too joined Richardson's company. *Charles Yates, age about 30.

It is a compilation of three separate short horror films written and directed by Keita Amemiya, Takuji Suzuki, and Keisuke Toyoshima respectively. Segments  Kanako returns home after an evening with her fianc√©, Akira, a divorcee. Their car accidentally hits a vase in a sidewalk, though they do not notice. Nearing Kanako's apartment, Akira repeatedly gets phone calls from his ex-wife, which he shuts off. Kanako is walking home by foot when an earring suddenly falls on her, followed by something heavy that knocks her out. Waking up, Kanako sees a little girl who quickly disappears afterwards. In her apartment, Kanako is calling her friend, Miyuki, while she is treating her head wound when suddenly a strange voice startles her. Akira calls Kanako, telling her that he met his ex-wife who held a knife, but she quickly ran away when he approached her. As Kanako investigates steam coming from her bathroom, she confronts a woman in red dress holding a knife. Kanako knocks the woman with a vase, but the woman gets up and chases Kanako throughout the complex. Kanako escapes to the street, seeing inanimate people circling a dead body, and meets the little girl again, who points to the broken vase on the sidewalk. Kanako remembers an insane woman who was always looking at the memorial vase of her dead daughter (the little girl), who fell from the apartment. As the woman in red continues the chase, Kanako climbs up the apartment and meets several inanimate people again. She arrives at the home of the insane woman, seemingly the lair of the woman in red. The woman catches up and starts to contort, and as Kanako tries to escape, she falls out of a window. It is revealed that the thing that knocked out Kanako before is a person who committed suicide and since then, Kanako had been in a coma because of the operation to remove the person's hands, which had been fused to Kanako, meaning that the previous night's events were apparently her imagination. She also learns that Akira's ex-wife is not the presumed woman in red, but instead had been trying to tell Akira that she will remarry. Kanako visits the apartment in front of the girl's memorial where a neighbor tells her that the insane woman had committed suicide a year before by hanging. The insane woman and her daughter appear and try to reveal something before they abruptly disappear. The set suddenly turns to night as the woman in red appears and tries to push Kanako off the balcony. Kanako realizes that the one who fell on her is herself when she sees another self of her walking on the road, meaning that the entire events had been a loop. The woman in red reveals herself as a monster before throwing Kanako to her death.  Mikio Sekiguchi is a teenager working at a workshop owned by Tetsu Takahashi. He is offered by Tetsu a date with his sister, Hagane. When he arrives at the Takahashi residence, Mikio sees Hagane operating a sewing machine with a burlap sack covering her upper body. She goes to change her clothes, but when she comes out, she wears a skirt and heels with the sack still covering her body. Throughout the date, Hagane does not speak, only letting out strange noises and growls. She also acts strangely, running around the street wildly. At one point, Mikio notices a grasshopper coming out of Hagane's sack. After Hagane throws herself to the river and dragging Mikio when he tries to catch her, Mikio returns home with Hagane to change his clothes. When he attempts to lend Hagane his clothes, she kicks him to the window until Mikio pushes her to his bed. Hagane draws the word \\"more\\" using Mikio's blood and moves her feet around Mikio, who then asks her permission to open the sack so he could have sex with her, which she seems to agree with. However, halfway through opening, Mikio sees what appears to be open flesh under the sack, and Hagane trashes Mikio's bedroom before going away. Tetsu leaves a voice mail informing Mikio that Hagane is pleased with the date and hopes that he will someday date with her again, but finds that Mikio already resigned from his job. As Mikio walks through the street, he is targeted by wooden nails shot by Hagane, but he manages to retaliate and beats her up, although he backs down when his arm is stabbed by spikes protruding from Hagane's sack. Escaping from the scene, Mikio avoids a following Tetsu and takes a walk outside his house that night. He sees Hagane walking limply until she collapses; he uses this opportunity to throw her off a cliff. However, she appears unharmed and chases him to a warehouse, which Mikio locks up. Using her newly opened hands, Hagane opens the door and cries as Mikio hugs her. She then opens up her sack and allows Mikio to see her inside until a chomping sound is heard. Mikio manages to break free, terrified with his face covered in bite marks as Hagane approaches him. She proceeds to slowly eat him up in a way reminiscent of an intercouse. Tetsu eventually discovers her and burns Mikio's belongings. The next day, Hagane continues her sewing activity and walks through a forest happily.  Saeko Hishikawa returns to her childhood home with her son, Michio, to take care of her elderly mother. However, Saeko's mother still resents Saeko for divorcing her husband and breaking up the family, and she tells her that she should return to Tokyo. At night, Michio glimpses a young boy whom he eventually learns to be his uncle, Masahiko, who had disappeared when the latter was still a child. When he tells his mother about it, Saeko dismisses it. The next day, Saeko goes inside the shed behind her house and finds a wooden chest with a scroll inside, which she proceeds to look into. She begins to act strangely, now smoking and acting offensively towards Michio, at one point attempting to strangle him. During one night, Michio sneaks to the shed to find Saeko combing her hair while singing a lullaby, but he escapes when she notices him. Meanwhile, Saeko's mother attempts to call someone to take Michio away, but Saeko closes the call and says that Michio will not go anywhere. As the situation worsens, Saeko eventually locks Michio inside the shed while she burns planks of wood, proceeding to then throw the scroll from earlier into the fire while screaming in agony. Michio discovers Masahiko's skull inside a box and sees visions of his young grandmother being the one who kidnapped and killed Masahiko because of the curse of the scroll, and that Saeko is now cursed with the scroll and will kill him. Michio is freed by his grandmother who urges him to leave, but he decides to look for his mother in the house. He is pursued by the possessed Saeko, until she apparently apologizes and the two embrace. The next day, Saeko's childhood friend, Kajibo arrives to find Saeko's mother babbling, while Saeko is in the shed, singing a lullaby while holding Michio's dead body in the same way her mother once did to Masahiko.

It is 300 km west of capital city Kathamandu and 21 km east of Lumbini the birthplace of Lord Buddha. The climate at NWRP is subtropical. The recorded maximum temperature in summer is 44.6¬∞C and minimum temperature in winter is 4.8¬∞C. The average annual rain fall is 1700 mm, with maximum and minimum mean temperature of June and January is 30.8 0C and 14.7 0C respectively. NWRP station has a total of 35 hectares of land area out of which 25 hectares are utilized for wheat research and production activities and rest 10 hectares are occupied by farm roads drainage, office and residence facilities. Wheat is the third largest cereal crop in Nepal after rice and maize. Before the introduction of Mexican semi-dwarf wheat varieties, wheat cultivation in Nepal was limited to mid and far-western hills only and it was considered as a minor cereal in the country. After the introduction of semi-dwarf varieties from Mexico, the area and production of wheat in Nepal has been increased dramatically and now it has significant contribution to the national food supply. In 1965/66, wheat area in the country was 100,000 ha and the production was 112,000 metric tons. In 2006/07, its area and production have increased to 702664 ha and 1515139 metric tons respectively. The present national average wheat productivity is 2156 kg/ha. Wheat is cultivated in 20 percent of the total cultivated land area and contributes 18.8 percent to the total national cereal production. Per capita wheat consumption has increased from 17.4 kg in 1972 at the time of NWRP establishment to 60 kg in 2007. In Terai, as irrigation facility is steadily increasing there is still ample opportunity to expand the wheat area where the lands remain fallow after rice harvesting. National Wheat Research Program located at Bhairahawa  National Oilseed Research Program  National Oilseed Development Program was established on April 14, 1976 (Baishakh 02, 2033 BS) for the research and development of the oilseeds in the country. After the inception of Nepal Agricultural Research Council in 1990 (2048 BS) it was renamed as National Oilseed Research Program (NORP). This program is situated in Nawalpur in Sarlahi District. Oilseed research in Nepal was started systematically with the establishment this program. NORP is located at Netragunj Village Development Committee in ward no. 6, Nawalpur. It is located on east west national highway. It lies at 27¬∞ 3' 86\\" north latitude and 85¬∞ 35' 52\\" east longitude and at an elevation of 144 masl.  National Agricultural Research and Development Fund  In general, National Agricultural Research and Development Fund (NARDF) is Responsible to carry out the applied researches. It was established in December 2001 under the Working Fund Act, 1986. it has targeted to support the Government, non-government, educational, private sector, civil society, cooperatives and community-based organizations to conduct agricultural research and development works. NARDF has been supporting crop improvement projects in addition to other agricultural research projects.  International Collaboration  CIMMYT international and the IRRI has been collaborating actively with NARC and IAAS in wheat and rice improvement programs.

Dell led England in 51 international futsal matches, including the 2006 UEFA Futsal Championship and the 2008 FIFA Futsal World Cup, before he stepped down on 25 March 2008.  Early life and education  Dell was born in Chalfont St Giles, Buckinghamshire, on 8 April 1964. He was educated at The Chalfonts County Secondary School.  Career  At the age of 21 years and 4 months he was, and remains, the youngest coach to be awarded the FA full coaching licence. Since that time, his reputation has grown as both a football and more latterly a futsal coach. More recently he has been heading up the FA's futsal coach education programme to develop a new breed of coach capable of developing futsal specific players and bringing the game to the wider football community in England. He is widely credited with establishing futsal in England. In 2011, Dell was invited to become a FIFA coaching instructor by the world's governing body of football, one of an elite group worldwide. This significant role combines delivering FIFA coach education courses around the world and assisting FIFA's member associations, whilst acting as an ambassador for the game. In 2014, Dell was further recognized by FIFA as he led his fellow instructors alongside legendary the world champion coach Javier Lozano Cid (Spain) in Madrid, whilst receiving a global mandate from FIFA as its first futsal development consultant, endorsed by Lozano.https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/footballdevelopment/technicalsupport/futsal/news/newsid=2335707/ On 26 October 2017 The FA confirmed his appointment to the FA Council under new governance reforms of the national games governing body. http://www.thefa.com/news/2017/nov/04/fa-council-meeting-update- october-2017-041117/ His coaching experience across all levels of the game followed a short playing spell at Watford F.C. as a youngster and then with non-league teams. He has held the post of youth, reserve and first team coach at Wycombe Wanderers F.C. as well as chief 1st X1 scout and Centre of Excellence director at Queens Park Rangers F.C. under the guidance of Don Howe. He has coached abroad on various assignments for several national federations. In the early 1990s, Dell worked as a regional coach for the FA as part of its Centres of Excellence programme, where he was involved in the player review and selection process for each year's intake of the FA National School at Lilleshall, eventually becoming part of technical director Keith Blunt's final assessment staff. Amongst the coaches he has worked are Sir Bobby Robson, Roy Hodgson, Don Howe, Les Reed and England's most successful youth team coach to date, Ted Powell. In 2001, he was selected by the British Olympic Association as its representative at the National Olympic Academy in Olympia, Greece. He has coached the British Universities Sports Association (BUSA) national football team at eight FISU World University Games (Universiade) in 1995, 1997, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005, 2007 and 2009, most recently losing in the semi-finals to Ukraine on penalty kicks, yet finishing in 4th place, Great Britain's highest position since 1993 at that level. Dell also headed three GB delegations at FISU World University Futsal Championships in 2004, 2006 and 2008 showing progress in all three encounters and winning the FIFA Fair Play Award on three consecutive occasions. In 2007, he was awarded an honorary life membership of the BUSA for over 20 years' contribution to student sport. In January 2013, Dell was appointed deputy chef de mission for the England team which participated at the XX Commonwealth Games in Glasgow 2014. http://www.insidethegames.biz/commonwealth- games/2014/1015971-jan-paterson-announced-as-team-england-chef-de-mission-for- glasgow-2014 In his role as head of England's games time operations he is widely but quietly credited as a chief architect behind Team England's success in Glasgow where they topped the medal table with a 28 year high of 174 medals, outstripping their nearest rivals, Australia, by 37 medals.https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/commonwealth-games/2014/medals/countries England's largest ever Commonwealth Games team of more than 650 benefitted from a widely acclaimed performance centre (the Lion's Den) which Dell is credited with, whilst establishing the performance environment for the team. He also established a ground-breaking anti-doping education concept across Team England and, in collaboration with UK Anti Doping, require every one of the 650+ team members to undergo compulsory anti-doping education, setting a new standard for athletes and support personnel at major games before the 2015 world anti-doping code (WADC) changes.http://www.cecileparkconferences.com/tackling-doping- sport-2014/speakers On 22 December 2015 it is recorded at Companies House in London that Dell became a main board Director (Trustee) of the Sports Council Trust Company, the charitable arm of Sport England. The Trust has a number of defined objectives including the ownership, management and governance of delivery activities of the National Sports Centres at Bisham Abbey, Lilleshall and Plas y Brenin as well as the Redgrave & Pinsent rowing lake at Caversham in Berkshire. Dell is also a businessman, and in 2005 he was awarded an honorary Fellowship of the Royal Society for Manufactures and Arts (RSA) and is a business mentor for the Princes Trust. Also in that year, one of his businesses was awarded the Queen's Award for Enterprise. Recent searches at Companies House show Dell as a non-executive director of several businesses, including @Futsal Limited, a new start up company making a multimillion-pound investment into futsal facilities and educational programmes within the UK.

It is considered a \\"primary\\" mass estimation technique, i.e., the mass is measured directly from the motion that its gravitational force induces in the nearby gas. Newton's law of gravity defines a direct relation between the mass of a central object and the speed of a smaller object in orbit around the central mass. Thus, for matter orbiting a black hole, the black-hole mass M_\\\\bullet is related by the formula : GM_\\\\bullet = f \\\\, R_\\\\text{BLR} \\\\, (\\\\Delta V)^2 to the RMS velocity ŒîV of gas moving near the black hole in the broad emission-line region, measured from the Doppler broadening of the gaseous emission lines. In this formula, RBLR is the radius of the broad-line region; G is the constant of gravitation; and f is a poorly known \\"form factor\\" that depends on the shape of the BLR. While ŒîV can be measured directly using spectroscopy, the necessary determination of RBLR is much less straightforward. This is where reverberation mapping comes into play.B. M. Peterson, K. Horne, Reverberation Mapping of Active Galactic Nuclei (2004). It utilizes the fact that the emission-line fluxes vary strongly in response to changes in the continuum, i.e., the light from the accretion disk near the black hole. Put simply, if the brightness of the accretion disk varies, the emission lines, which are excited in response to the accretion disk's light, will \\"reverberate\\", that is, vary in response. But it will take some time for light from the accretion disk to reach the broad-line region. Thus, the emission-line response is delayed with respect to changes in the continuum. Assuming that this delay is solely due to light travel times, the distance traveled by the light, corresponding to the radius of the broad emission-line region, can be measured. Only a small handful (less than 40) of active galactic nuclei have been accurately \\"mapped\\" in this way. An alternative approach is to use an empirical correlation between RBLR and the continuum luminosity. Another uncertainty is the value of f. In principle, the response of the BLR to variations in the continuum could be used to map out the three- dimensional structure of the BLR. In practice, the amount and quality of data required to carry out such a deconvolution is prohibitive. Until about 2004, f was estimated ab initio based on simple models for the structure of the BLR. More recently, the value of f has been determined so as to bring the M‚Äìsigma relation for active galaxies into the best possible agreement with the M‚Äìsigma relation for quiescent galaxies. When f is determined in this way, reverberation mapping becomes a \\"secondary\\", rather than \\"primary\\", mass estimation technique.
