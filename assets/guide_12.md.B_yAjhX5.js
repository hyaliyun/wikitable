The game was released for Microsoft Windows, Linux, OS X, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and iOS. A sequel, Rogue Legacy 2, is currently in development and was released in early access on August 18, 2020.  Gameplay  The goal of Rogue Legacy is to explore a randomly generated dungeon, defeat four bosses in each of the four unique environments of the dungeon, and then defeat the final boss. Characters have the default ability to jump and slash with their sword, along with secondary abilities, such as magic attacks, which use mana. players can also use their sword to slash platforms to make them extend. Whenever a character dies as a result of losing all of their Hit Points (HP), control will transfer over to one of three randomly generated heirs which the player may choose between, though this number may be increased to six with a later upgrade. Each descendant carries their unique characteristics and abilities, including such genetic peculiarities as color-blindness (in which the game is presented in black and white), ADHD (in which the player moves faster) and dwarfism (in which the character is short and can fit into small gaps). Gold found while exploring the castle can be used to improve the character's equipment and abilities, which are passed on to that character's heirs. Gold can be found by smashing pieces of furniture, opening chests, or defeating enemies. There are also various fairy chests hidden in special rooms throughout the castle, most of which require the player to complete an objective, such as taking no damage in the room, in order to be opened. Spending gold on the manor, which appears after a new heir is chosen, can increase stats, such as health and mana, and unlock and upgrade new classes that may be carried by one of the heirs. These include mages, which can use more advanced spells, warriors, who have higher strength, and assassins, who can use various stealth techniques and have an increased likelihood of having a critical hit. Gold can unlock the blacksmith, the enchantress and the architect, who each provide their own services. The blacksmith can use blueprints found in the castle to create new armor and equipment for the player, improving their stats. Similarly, the enchantress can use runes found in fairy chests to give the player enhancements, unlocking additional abilities such as double jumping and dashing. Finally, the architect can lock down the design of a previously encountered castle (so that a new one isn't randomly generated) in exchange for a percentage of any gold found. Any unspent gold must be paid to Charon in order to enter the castle, though upgrades can reduce the amount required to pay. = Additional content = The game features a progressing \\"New Game +\\" feature, in which every completion of the game along a specific line of descendants increases the difficulty while also increasing the rewards offered by enemies and chests. After the second completion, the format for the name is \\"New Game +n\\" where n is the number of playthroughs since the first (Begins at +2, then +3, etc.). Notably, while enemies increase in difficulty theoretically forever, bosses do not get any harder across playthroughs. Furthermore, the player cannot normally increase in power beyond a certain point, though small increases to various stats beyond this soft-cap are possible through the \\"Fairy Chests\\" system. A number of secret bosses exist, all of which are remixed versions of each of the ordinary bosses. Upon defeating all of the secret ordinary bosses, one may challenge the secret version of the final boss in order to unlock the secret \\"Traitor\\" class, based on the first form of the final boss.  Development  The game was developed by Cellar Door Games, a Toronto-based developer consisting of brothers Kenny and Teddy Lee. This was the brothers' biggest project to date and took 18 months to develop. The game was inspired by such titles as Demon's Souls and Dark Souls. Teddy compares the design to games like Spelunky and The Binding of Isaac, noting that their goal was to make the game relatively forgiving and accessible, while also allowing permanent progression. Due to the need to streamline the game, several prominent features were cut during development, including an experience system. Kenny added that the revenue from the game will allow them to focus on larger future projects. The game cost the team about $15,000 of their own money to develop, all of which was earned back within an hour of release. Rogue Legacy went on to sell more than 100,000 copies within the first week. Most versions of the game were done in-house. However, the Xbox One version was ported by Abstraction Games.  Release  In December 2014, Cellar Door Games teamed up with IndieBox, a monthly subscription box service, to produce an exclusive physical release of Rogue Legacy. This limited, individually- numbered collector's edition included a flash-drive with a DRM-free game file, the official soundtrack, an instruction manual and Steam key, as well as several custom-designed collectible items. The Nintendo Switch version of Rogue Legacy was released on November 6, 2018.  Reception and legacy  Metacritic gives the game a \\"generally favorable\\" score of 85/100 based on 43 reviews. Mitchell Saltzman of GameFront describes the game as \\"insanely hard for the unprepared\\". Philip Kollar of Polygon and Mike Splechta of GameZone mentioned the short life spans of their characters, and Scott Nichols of Digital Spy expressed frustration when first starting out. Other reviewers remarked that the game actually encourages these short runs while rewarding the player via the broader progression system. Ryan Stevens of GameTrailers described the game as \\"[riding] the line of frustration and fun\\". Saltzman concludes that \\"difficulty may be a turnoff to those who get frustrated easily\\". Cellar Doors announced a sequel Rogue Legacy 2 was in development in April 2020. It was released in early access on August 18, 2020.

Capitol Ave. in Pierre, South Dakota. The hotel was built in 1911 by Charles Hyde, a prominent Pierre businessman. Hyde had helped establish Pierre's business district; he was later convicted of mail fraud and pardoned by President William Howard Taft. South Dakota Governor Robert S. Vessey hosted the hotel's grand opening, a portent of the hotel's role in South Dakota politics. All members of both houses of the South Dakota Legislature stayed in the hotel while in Pierre, and the legislators often discussed and debated bills in the building. In addition, several governors stayed in the hotel until the South Dakota governor's mansion was built in the 1940s. The hotel has also hosted prominent guests such as President Calvin Coolidge, Dale Carnegie, Bob Hope, and Clark Gable. The hotel was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 7, 1980.

He is the founder, teaching pastor and CEO of Living on the Edge, an international teaching and discipleship ministry. A pastor for over 30 years, Chip is the author of many books, including Culture Shock, The Real Heaven, The Real God, The Invisible War, and Love, Sex, and Lasting Relationships.  Early life  Originally from Columbus, Ohio, Ingram grew up in what he called \\"a negative religious environment\\". In his book, Living on the Edge: Dare to Experience True Spirituality, Ingram recounts growing up in a church that did not believe in the Bible or in having a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. \\"We read our prayers, we said the right things, we fulfilled our religious duty, and then we went home. There was absolutely no expectation that what we did on Sunday would have any impact on how we lived the rest of the week.‚Äùhttp://www.christianbook.com/living-edge- dare-experience-true-spirituality/chip- ingram/9781439190524/pd/190524?mt={matchtype}&dv;={device}&p;=1179517&event;=PLA As a result, by the time Ingram was a teenager, he was disengaged from church and God. He recalls, \\"I wanted to believe, but the older I got, the less interested I became in going through the religious motions and pretending and saying things that no one lived or believed.\\" = The intersection of faith and basketball = Ingram went on to graduate from West Liberty State College in 1976. Afterwards, he received an invitation from Sports Ambassadors to travel overseas with other college basketball players from around the nation using basketball as a vehicle for evangelism. During the next two summers he would go onto ball out on \\"dem folks\\", dunking on people then spreading the Gospel to them, Ingram toured the Caribbean, South America, and Asia with three international basketball teams, a trip that he said to be the turning point of his life. While he was on tour, he caught a vision that God could use an ordinary person like him to accomplish extraordinary things. Ingram started to believe that God was not calling him to coach athletes, but to ‚Äúcoach‚Äù people for Jesus Christ and become a pastor.  Ministry  In 1982, Ingram began his pastoral ministry at a small, rural church near Dallas, Texas. While he was there, it grew from 30 to 500 people. In 1990, he became the senior pastor for Santa Cruz Bible Church in Santa Cruz, California where he led a church congregation of 1,000 that grew to over 4,000. In 1995, he founded Living on the Edge as a nationally syndicated radio ministry, which has since grown into an international Christian discipleship ministry. In 2003 Ingram moved to Atlanta, Georgia to become president and chief executive officer of Walk Thru the Bible Ministries, succeeding Bruce Wilkinson. In 2009, Ingram became the Senior Pastor for Venture Christian Church in Los Gatos, California, where he served until 2018.https://www.prnewswire.com/news- releases/venture-installs-new-senior-pastor-tim-lundy-300721454.html Today, Ingram serves as CEO and teaching pastor of Living on the Edge. He is the author of 15 books and several small group ministry studies.  Education  Ingram completed his undergraduate work at West Liberty State College and went on to earn a Master of Education from West Virginia University and a Master of Theology from Dallas Theological Seminary.

It contains recordings written, played and produced by Rodgers and Bernard Edwards for various artists including Sister Sledge, Diana Ross, Sheila & B. Devotion, Deborah Harry, Norma Jean Wright, Carly Simon, Johnny Mathis and their own group Chic. In its original form, the album included every UK Top 40 hit single produced by Chic, excepting remixes. The Johnny Mathis track was widely publicised as being previously unreleased, though it had in fact appeared on Mathis' own Ultimate Collection CD in 2011. The album was released in the UK and Europe at a time when interest in Rodgers and CHIC was high for various reasons: the publication of Rodgers' autobiography in 2011, the appearance of BBC television and radio documentaries about him, the popularity of his collaboration with Daft Punk, \\"Get Lucky\\" (which is referenced in the compilation's title and sleeve art), and a series of acclaimed live performances including one televised from the Glastonbury Festival on the weekend before the album's release. Most of the tracks featured are 12\\" versions and are mastered to match the pitch and tempo of the original vinyl releases; this resulted in some tracks having slightly shorter running times than on other CD issues.

He showed that growth of a toxic unicellular phytoflagellate‚ÄîPrymnesium parvum and the synthesis of their toxins have different optimal requirements. The toxin turned out to be a proteo-lipid containing 15 amino acids, fatty acid and phosphates. This is one of the first toxins to be isolated in Algea and its toxic effects studied . The combination of basic research on the regulation and action of the Prymnesium toxins, together with the development of field tests and the appropriate treatment of fishponds by ammonia and copper, eliminated this problem in aquaculture in Israel. Another set of landmark studies was initiated at the Solar Lake on the edge of the Red Sea, a small unique hypersaline body of water 20 km south of Eilat. The Solar Lake was established as a model for microbial interactions in extreme environments. The major studies included the discovery of anoxygenic photosynthesis in cyanobacteria as a major evolutionary stage in the evolution of photosynthesis, and the diurnal shift between oxygenic and anoxygenic photosynthesis . In addition, the studies revealed a Microbial mat‚Äîthese stratified benthic microbial communities, dominated by cyanobacteria, develop over the bottom of the Solar Lake. Such microbial mats are modern analogs to stromatolites: Precambrian laminated sedimentary rocks, which are the oldest known microfossils (dated to be 3.5 billion years old). During the last decade of his life, Shilo‚Äôs work focused on benthic cyanobacteria. Production of a hydrophobic external surface allows these organisms to adhere to submerged surfaces. Spreading through a planktonic phase occurs by formation of special cells that have a hydrophilic surface and detach from the mother cells, or transient secretion of substances that mask the hydrophobic surface . These studies have pioneered the current trend in microbiology that focuses on mixed bacterial communities and the dynamic formation and dissociation of biofilms. Shilo's contributions to science in Israel included some significant contributions to Israel's scientific infrastructure. His major contribution in this field was the establishment of the Department of Microbial Molecular Ecology‚Äîin the Faculty of Science at Hebrew University of Jerusalem, the base of his research and teaching. He was pro-rector of the Hebrew University in the 70s. He also founded, in 1949, the laboratory for the study of fish disease in Kibutz Nir David, in close collaboration with his lifelong friend and colleague Shmuel Sarig. In 1964 he chaired a national committee recommending the establishment of a Marine Research Laboratory in Eilat, Israel. This also led to the establishment of \\"The Israel Oceanographic and Limnological Research Corporation\\" in 1966. Moshe Shilo was born in Moscow, and immigrated to Israel in 1933, after spending a decade in Zopot (near Danzig), which was at that time under German jurisdiction. He was an undergraduate at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He carried out his M.Sc. studies with Manfred Ashner on the ecology of marine luminescent bacteria, and his Ph.D. (1947) with Aryeh Leo Olitzki on heat labile antigens of Shigella. During the 1948 Arab-Israeli war he served in the siege of Jerusalem in the Intelligence unit of the Jewish paramilitary organization Haganah, and in the Science corps. He did post doctoral studies with Sir Hans Krebs at Oxford, and Roger Stanier at UC Berkeley (1954‚Äì1956). During his entire scientific career he was a faculty member of the Hebrew University, Jerusalem, and published over 100 articles in leading scientific journals. Throughout his career he maintained close personal and professional relations with his childhood friend Alexander Keynan, who was also a professor at the Hebrew University. Moshe Shilo married Miriam Goldzweig in 1948, and they subsequently worked together for over two decades on the analysis of Prymnesium toxin. They have two daughters and a son.

Because many people in Brandenburg have Slavonic roots, the cuisine is very much influenced by their habits and customs, such as is the case in Mecklenburg and Pomerania. Beelitzer Spargel (asparagus from Beelitz) Fish Due to the numerous greater and smaller inland lakes in Brandenburg its cuisine features much fish. Particularly pike, zander, eel and carp are very popular and are ingredients in many dishes. A very typical fashion of preparation is the combination with Spreewaldsauce. Teltower R√ºbchen Vegetables Potato is an essential ingredient in the cuisine of Brandenburg since Frederick the Great encouraged its breakthrough through a royal decree. It is so important that some tourist activities are built around the potato and its importance for the population in Brandenburg, for example the tourist association of Fl√§ming offers a \\"culinary potato tour\\" where the participants are guided to several inns which have innovative recipes containing potato on their menu. Very famous and almost internationally known is the asparagus grown in the surroundings of Beelitz. Most of the yieldings are sold in the area and especially to Berlin where during the asparagus season many restaurants offer Beelitzer Spargel mit Kartoffeln und Sauce Hollandaise (asparagus with potatoes and hollandaise sauce). Game and mushrooms In the forested areas of Brandenburg such as the Schorfheide, and in the regions of Niederlausitz Fl√§ming many dishes are featuring game and mushrooms. In well-yielding years an abundance of chanterelles, chestnuts and boletus can be found in Brandenburgs forests and therefore also on the menus of inns, guesthouses and restaurants. Regional specialities A famous speciality food from the Spreewald region are the Spreewald gherkins, which are protected by the EU as a Protected Geographical Indication (PGI). A very typical speciality of the region Niederlausitz are Plinsen which is a kind of pancake. Also in this region the famous linseed oil is extracted and used as an ingredient very frequently. For example one of the most famous dishes is potato with Quark, shallots and linseed oil. Another well-known dish which is also considered \\"national dish\\" of the region of Priegnitz is Knieperkohl, a kind of pickled cabbage similar to Sauerkraut but containing not only white cabbage but also collard greens (or leaves of red cabbage), kale and grape leaves and cherry leaves. Beverages There are several breweries located in Brandenburg. The Klosterbrauerei Neuzelle produces a coloured black beer which was many years disputed about since the government of Brandenburg wanted to prosecute the brewery for selling and advertising it as black beer. A blossoming metropole of beer production was Bernau but the famous \\"Bernauer Bier\\" was last produced in Friedrichshagen, a district belonging to Berlin. In the surroundings of the town Werder (Havel) many fruits are grown and processed to fruit vines. There are also several distilleries manufacturing fruit brandies.

This species lived approximately 86 to 84 million years ago during the latter part of the Cretaceous Period in what is now Patagonia (in southern Argentina). Overosaurus paradasorum was relatively small compared to other sauropods from Patagonia, like the saltasaurids and other aeolosaurines. It was a ground-dwelling herbivore, relatively small for a sauropod, with a length estimated as approximately long.  Description  Overosaurus was described and named by Rodolfo A. Coria, Leonardo S. Filippi, Luis M. Chiappe, Rodolfo Garc√≠a and Andrea B. Arcucci in 2013. This species is known solely from the holotype MAU-Pv-CO-439 which consists of a fully articulated vertebral series from the 10th cervical to the 20th caudal vertebra, the ribs of the last three cervical vertebrae, six right dorsal ribs (articulated with their respective dorsal vertebrae 2,3,4,5,8,9), five left dorsal ribs (articulated with their respective dorsal vertebrae 2,3,4,5,8), the proximal portions of dorsal ribs of both sides of dorsal vertebrae 9 and 10, a complete right ilium and a fragmented left ilium. Specifically the vertebral series includes the last four cervical vertebrae, ten dorsal vertebrae, six sacral vertebrae, and twenty caudal vertebrae. Its sacrum consists of six fused sacral vertebrae.  Classification  Overosaurus was differentiated from other titanosaur taxa using a unique combination of characters present in the illium and in the cervical, dorsal and caudal vertebrae. A phylogenetic analysis of Lithostrotia placed Overosaurus within the Aeolosaurini, as the sister taxon of a monophyletic group formed by Gondwanatitan faustoi, Pitekunsaurus macayai, Aeolosaurus rionegrinus, and Aeolosaurus maximus.  Paleoecology  = Provenance and occurrence = The only known specimen of Overosaurus paradasorum was recovered at the Cerro Overo locality in Patagonia, Argentina. The specimen was collected in 2002 by researchers from the Museo Carmen Funes, the Museo Argentino Urquiza, and the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, in terrestrial sediments deposited during the Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous period, approximately 84 to 78 million years ago. This specimen is housed in the collection of the Museo Argentino Urquiza in Neuqu√©n, Argentina. The specimen was found by Carlos Parada and family, who provided logistic support to museum staff as well as assistance during fieldwork. The Cerro Overo locality was originally reported as within the Anacleto Formation of the Neuqu√©n Group, but is now attributed to the Bajo de la Carpa Formation.

John White Life The son of Peter White, vicar of St. Neots, Huntingdonshire, and of the neighbouring parish of Eaton Socon in Bedfordshire, he was born at Eaton Socon; Francis White was his brother. White was educated at St. Neots grammar school. He was admitted a sizar of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, on 15 February 1586, was scholar from Lady-day 1588 to Michaelmas 1592, and graduated B.A. in 1590, M.A. in 1593, and D.D. in 1612. White was appointed vicar of Leyland, then of Eccles, Lancashire, and fellow of the Collegiate Church, Manchester, in 1606. He resigned these offices in 1609 on being presented by Sir John Crofts to the rectory of Barsham in Suffolk. In 1614 or 1615 he was made chaplain in ordinary to James I. White died at the age of 45, in 1615, in Lombard Street, London. He was buried on 28 May 1615 at the church of St Mary Woolnoth. He left seven children. The eldest, John, entered Gonville and Caius College in 1611, aged 16, and became vicar of Eaton Socon; another son is mentioned by Thomas Fuller as a druggist in Lombard Street. Works White wrote The Way to the True Church: wherein the principal Motives perswading to Romanisme are familiarly disputed and driven to their Issues, London, 1608. It was directed against the Treatise of Faith of the Jesuit John Percy. which was then being circulated in manuscript. The work set off a controversy, and further editions of this defence of Reformed theology came out in 1610, 1612, and 1616. Anthony Wotton also attacked Percy's work, and in so doing in A Trial of the Romish Clergies Title to the Church (1608) invoked Antichrist against the Catholic Church. The Way to the True Church was answered by Percy (known as A. D. or Fisher) in A Reply Made unto Mr. Anthony Wotton and Mr. John White (1612). White rejoined for his part in A Defence of the Way to the True Church against A.D. his Reply, 1614. White's Defence then occasioned A Discovery of certain notorious Shifts, Evasions, and Untruths uttered by M. J. White ‚Ä¶ By W. G., London, 1619, and written by William Wright; White's original work evoked Thomas Worthington's Whyte dyed Black, or a Discovery of many most Foule Blemishes, Impostures and Deceipts which D. Whyte hath practysed in his Book, 1615. A reply to Worthington was published after White's death, in 1617, by his brother Francis White. A third reply to White's original book was A Treatise of the Church, in which it is proved Mr. J. W. his Way to the True Church to be indeed no Way at all to any Church, 1616. This work was also by Wright, who turned to translations from Leonard Lessius to dispute the possibility of salvation outside the Catholic church. The Way to the True Church also contains examples gathered by White in his time at Eccles, of folkways and what he considered superstitious belief. He attributed these in part to the continuing influence of Catholic priests, on what remained a largely Catholic local congregation. John White also published: * English Paradise, discovered in a Latine Prospect of Jacobs Blessing, a Sermon on Gen. xxvii. 27, London, 1612. * Two Sermons: the Former at Pauls Crosse on 1 Tim. ii. 1, upon the Anniversary Commemoration of the Kings most happy Succession to the Crowne of England; the Latter at the Spittle on 1 Tim. vi. 17, London, 1615.

Unlike many other paranormal television shows, Sp√∏gelsesj√¶gerne does not focus exclusively on the groups' paranormal investigations but also covers the group members' private lives. Premise The show follows two groups of paranormal investigators - namely, the Jutland-based group Ghosthunting.dk and the Zealand-based groups Dansk Parapsykologisk Aspekt (DPA). As is typical of paranormal reality TV, Sp√∏gelsesj√¶gerne covers the groups' paranormal investigations and draws on the aesthetics of the genre, such as night camera green and documentary style cutting. However, the show also covers aspects of the day-to-day operations of the two groups. For instance, the first episode covers an entrance examination for two potential new members of Ghosthunting.dk in the form of a mock ghost hunt (with only one of the two candidates passing),http://nutv.dk/video?video=4953 and episode two covers both groups' selection processes when they decide which locations to investigate.http://nutv.dk/video?video=5001 Episode 5 infamously covers a team building exercise in which a sexologist therapist coaches DPA in an unconventional manner (the sexologist controversially crashes an investigation in a private home in episode 6), and also depicts the on-camera dismissal of Ghosthunting.dk's researcher from the group.http://nutv.dk/video?video=5030 Episode 6 covers documents Ghosthunting.dk experimenting with \\"√•nden i glasset\\" (a Danish variant of ouija), while a new member is inducted into DPA and put through a trial of fire.http://nutv.dk/video?video=5030 Moreover, the show covers aspects of the members' private lives, with episode 4 showing one of DPA's members dropping off his Thai girlfriend at the airport, and episode 3 depicting Ghosthunting.dk's researcher's dating activities.http://nutv.dk/video?video=5016 Episode 6 depicts an emotional clairvoyance session in which some of Ghosthunting.dk's members make contact with the spirits of dead family members, while episode 2 shows DPA's Chief Investigator in his day job as a mechanic in the local fire department, and episode 5 follows Ghosthunting.dk's leader's trip to the local supermarket. The romantic relationship between Ghosthunting.dk's leader and his long-term partner, who is also a member of the group, is a recurring theme. Criticism Sp√∏gelsesj√¶gerne has received criticism for not focusing enough on the two groups' paranormal investigations and too much on their private lives, and their eating habits, and several viewers have complained on Kanal 5's Facebook page.https://www.facebook.com/sbs.kanal5 Followers of the two groups have complained, not only that there is not enough ghost hunting, but also that the show deliberately ridicules the two groups and deliberately depicts them as amateurs.https://www.facebook.com/groups/255744144033/https://www.facebook.com/Ghosthunting.dk The show has also received criticism from the two ghost hunting groups themselves. Ghosthunting.dk's leader has expressed dissatisfaction with the way that Blu has edited episode 5, arguing that the episode was edited such that it gives the impression that he fires the group's researcher on-screen, when in reality she chose to leave the group and the two had been discussing it for a long time before her exit from the group.http://www.ghosthunting.dk/kunena/afsnittene/1739-5-afsnit.html#2046 DPA's Chief Investigator posted a response to a comment on the group's Facebook page, stating that he felt that his group was being ridiculed in the way that it was depicted in Sp√∏gelsesj√¶gerne. Paranormalt Institut, the Danish branch of The Atlantic Paranormal Society, were also invited by Blu to be part of Sp√∏gelsesj√¶gerne, but chose to reject the invitation because they found that the show seemed unserious and uninteresting and that the concept behind the show was too poppy.http://www.paranormalt.dk/print.php?type=N&item;_id=5 In fact one or two other groups claims to have been contacted, and invited to be part of \\"Sp√∏gelsesj√¶gerne\\", but the fact is that no other group was invited. Ghosthunting and DPA was the first choice for BLU, and since both agreed, there was no reason to invite other groups. Since no one knew the concept of the show beforehand, no one could decline using the concept as an excuse. Viewer interaction Both DPA and Ghosthunting.dk openly communicate with the show's viewers. Both groups participate in the show's official chat channel,http://sp√∏gelsesj√¶gerne.dk/chat-info/ and Ghosthunting.dk have an additional channel on their own website, and also do live online broadcasts in which the group's members answer questions and respond to comments from the show's viewers.http://www.ghosthunting.dk/sp%C3%B8gelsesj%C3%A6gerne/live- event.html Both groups also interact with viewers via Facebook, DPA using a Facebook-group and Ghosthunting.dk using a Facebook-page.

Clemence's hagiography of Saint Catherine of Alexandria is widely regarded as, what would be considered today, a feminist text.  Life in Barking Abbey  Clemence was a nun of Barking Abbey during the 12th century. Barking Abbey was a royal monastery located in the Essex Borough of Barking and Dagenham, Essex, England. Dedicated to the Virgin Mary, the abbey was established in the seventh century around 666 AD and followed the Rule of Saint Benedict. It is very likely that Barking Abbey was one of the first monasteries founded in Britain, and it retained close ties to the British monarchy throughout its existence. Mary, the sister of Thomas Becket, was appointed as abbess by Henry II during Clemence's time at the abbey of Barking. Many of the abbesses at Barking Abbey were familially related to the British royal house, and likely often selected by the monarch until the early thirteenth century. The nuns of Barking Abbey were granted with a level of social, political, and economic independence that was generally only seen in religious houses that were directly associated with social and political elites, such as the British monarchy. Because Barking Abbey was one of the most wealthy monasteries in Britain at the time, the nuns at Barking were allowed more freedom to pursue cultural and literary interests. The nuns of Barking Abbey were also granted a great deal of theological independence. The nuns often set their own liturgy, and contributed to the ecclesiastical and liturgical expansion of their religious community through letters to other monasteries. As a nun of Barking Abbey, Clemence was part of an elite religious community under the protection of British monarchy. In addition to her work, many other texts have been associated with the abbey of Barking, including Guernes de Pont-Sainte- Maxence's Life of Thomas Becket, and Adgar's Gracial. Under the Rule of St. Benedict, daily reading in both private and communal settings was both required and necessary to properly celebrate the Bible. The presence of Barking Abbey's library suggests that reading and literature were significant components of daily life. The nuns contributed texts at the monasteries; however, very few medieval monastery manuscripts remain, making it difficult to discern how much writing nuns were contributing at the time. It is likely that Barking's nuns were creating texts to be shared with each other, with royalty, and other outside visitors. Following the Cluniac Reforms of the eleventh and twelfth centuries, the production of books was encouraged, and women were contributing more writing as a result. There is very limited information about Clemence outside of her writings and association with Barking Abbey, as she lived a relatively anonymous life. Her monastery and its historical and political connections may reveal the most about Clemence. The only identifiable traces of Clemence's life are in her translation of the Life of Saint Catherine, in which she leaves the signature, \\"I who have translated [St. Catherine's] life, by name am called Clemence. I am a nun of Barking. For the love of her I undertook this work.\\" It is believed that Clemence also translated an anonymous Anglo-Norman version of Aelred of Rievaulx's Latin Life of St. Edward the Confessor, which was composed at Barking Abbey between 1163 and 1170. Nonetheless, there is not enough evidence to determine who translated the Life of St. Edward, as anonymous writing was common in Middle English literature, and even more common among women writers.  Life of Saint Catherine of Alexandria  Clemence of Barking Abbey is primarily known for her translation of the Life of Saint Catherine. Her translation of the text from Latin to vernacular French has been the subject of extensive analysis by literary scholars, with particular regard to the politics of the translation. Although there is little evidence indicating whether Clemence's translation had any influence and impact on her successors, current interest in her translation has significantly increased, and the text is widely revisited today as a source for feminist analysis. Clemence's account of Saint Catherine is based on an eleventh-century rendition of the Latin Vulgate, which was written during the monastic revival in Normandy. Despite the lack of remaining copies of Clemence's translation, it is believed to have been relatively popular at the time of its release. Clemence's version of the account is regarded as being one of the earliest vernacular lives of the saints, and one of the only accounts written by a woman, which reveals Clemence's significance as a translator situated in the middle of England's early medieval literary development. A prominent point of scholarly analysis is the differences of attitude towards gender between Clemence's translation and the Vulgate rendition. Many scholars suggest that Clemence's translation is a gender positive re-interpretation of the Vulgate rendition, and is perhaps meant to partially act as social commentary on women's role in society at the time. In the opening lines of Clemence's text, Clemence declares her intention to \\"translator la vie,./De Latin respundre en rumanz/Pur √ßo que plus plaise as oianz\\" (to translate the life, expounding it from Latin into the vernacular, in order to please more those who hear it). Scholars argue that in this portion of the translation, Clemence employed self-authorization. Because the act of writing was already quite subversive for twelfth-century women in Europe, Clemence's strategy of self-authorization is regarded as a bold move. Scholars also suggest that Clemence's reclamation of authority was a strategy for taking hold of patriarchal depictions of women in literature in order to reinterpret them as a woman for women. Scholar, Gina J. Froese writes that Clemence's work \\"hints at an authorial anxiety that suggests a send of unease with the process of subverting and reclaiming. Though she follows and sometimes mimics the structure, form, and style her male predecessors also apply, we clearly find indications of protest against misogynistic views and corrections of such interpretations that place her at odds with the authority of her predecessors.\\"  Works  * The life of St. Catherine, Ed.

Surguchev (1928‚Äî1991) was a prominent petroleum scientist in the USSR. He was widely recognized in Russia and internationally as an expert in reservoir engineering, oil field development, waterflooding, enhancing and improving oil recovery (EOR and IOR) methods. Education Surguchev studied at Ishimbai Petroleum Engineering High School, and Kuibyshev Industrial Institute (University). Career After graduating from the University, Mikhail Surguchev obtained his Doctorate at the State Research Institute Giprovostokneft in Samara, where he developed a blocked inter-contour system for oilfield development by waterflooding. This system was implemented in a number of major oil fields, particularly those in the Volga-Ural and Western Siberia Regions. In 1966, Dr. Surguchev was invited to join the All-Union Oil and Gas Scientific Research Institute (VNIIneft) in Moscow, the main research institute of the petroleum industry in the country. In 1971 he was appointed Head of the Department of Enhanced Oil Recovery at the VNIIneft Institute; subsequently becoming the Deputy Director, and ultimately the Director. In his years at this Institute, he guided and took part in a range of theoretical and experimental investigations of EOR processes. He was also the project manager for the development of the giant Samotlor oil field in Western Siberia, and was responsible for initiating a number of improved oil recovery projects in reservoirs situated in the Volga-Urals, Western Siberia, and other parts of the country. In 1986, Dr. Surguchev became the Director General of the Inter- branch Scientific Technological Complex ‚ÄúOil Recovery‚Äù in Moscow, a position that he held until his untimely death in 1991. Under his leadership, the complex prospered, and has given considerable support to the industry in improving the technology of oil recovery. Dr. Surguchev‚Äôs contribution to the science and technology of oil recovery included more than 200 scientific papers, 18 monographs and 30 patented inventions. A large number of his technical innovations were implemented by the petroleum industry. Dr. Surguchev was elected a member of the USSR Academy of Sciences. He was a Laureate of the Lenin Prize for Scientific and Technical Achievements (1966) and an Honored Scientist of the Russian Federation (1989). He has been awarded the USSR Order of the Red Banner of Labour. Dr. Surguchev was widely known and respected throughout the petroleum industry as a strong advocate for international cooperation and the dissemination of information between scientists and engineers. He was the Vice Chairman of the Executive Board of the World Petroleum Congress, and a very active member of the Steering committee for the European Symposia on Improved Oil Recovery.

Even if it is very similar to the French B√©chamel sauce, it is said that its recipe does not derive from the Hugenots but is of a much older and regional source. To prepare the sauce fish fond and bright roux are mixed and the emerging sauce is refined with butter, cream, parsley and dill. There are some variations and depending on the recipe one could also use flour mixed with cream instead of roux, add some bright beer or thickened with egg yolk. History The famous German poet Theodor Fontane wrote about the Spreewaldsauce: ‚ÄûDas w√§re kein Spreewaldsmahl, wenn kein Hecht auf dem Tisch st√§nde, und das w√§re kein Hecht, wenn ihn nicht die ber√ºhmte Spreewaldsauce begleitete, die mir wichtig genug erscheint, um hier das Rezept in seinen √§u√üersten Umrissen folgen zu lassen.

Life George was born in the town ton Kromnenon, located near Amastris in Paphlagonia, to a local noble family, around the middle of the 8th century... As a young man, he began a career in the church administration, but left it to become a hermit on Mt. Agrioserike. Still later, he joined a cenobitic monastic community at a place called Bonyssa. When the see of Amastris fell vacant in , the Patriarch of Constantinople Tarasios appointed George to fill it, despite the emperor favouring a different person for the post. George was consecrated as bishop in Constantinople. During his time as bishop of Amastris, George presided over the return of the remains of John of Gothia to the latter's native city of Parthenia, Crimea. George died early in the reign of Emperor Nikephoros I, of whom George was a notable supporter. He is recognized as a saint in the Orthodox liturgy, and his feast-day is 21 February. Hagiography George is the subject of a hagiography preserved in a single manuscript dating to the 10th century. In it, the saint is credited with several miracles, including saving the city from a raid by the hitherto-unknown Rus', who intended to despoil the saint's tomb. The accuracy of this information is open to question, and depends on the dating of its composition: Vasily Vasilievsky and Ihor ≈†evƒçenko have attributed it to George's near-contemporary Ignatios the Deacon, with a date of composition sometime before 842, whereas Germaine da Costa-Louillet and Wanda Wolska-Conus considered it a later, 10th-century work. Athanasios Markopoulos further suggested that while the bulk of the work is to be attributed to Ignatios, the Russian episode was a later addition, under the influence of Patriarch Photios. The significance of the episode's authenticity lies in its being possibly the first recorded attack by the Rus' against Byzantium. Despite his close ties to Empress Irene of Athens and Nikephoros I, the hagiography is noteworthy for its \\"lack of anti-Iconoclastic invective\\". As a result, and because of some similarities in the treatment of Emperor Nikephoros I to Nikephoros II Phokas () Alexander Kazhdan suggested a date of composition towards the end of the 10th century. =Editions= * V.

After consuming a special pill, he gets entangled in a different kind of dream. Lucia was the first Kannada film to be crowdfunded by the people which created a trend. The film's soundtrack was composed by Poornachandra Tejaswi and cinematography was handled by Siddhartha Nuni. Lucia premiered at the London Indian Film Festival on 20 July 2013. It won the Best Film Audience Choice award at the festival. It was also among the films shortlisted by the FFI to become India's submission for Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film for the year 2013. The film was also remade in Tamil as Enakkul Oruvan in 2015. The movie was credited for inspiring a new wave in the Kannada film industry.https://www.filmcompanion.in/features/kannada-features/best-kannada- movies-thriller-on-amazon-prime-video-youtube-zee5-mx-player-dr-rajkumar- lucia-accident-kavaludaari/amp/ Plot The plot is non-linear, and the end scene of the film shows the real beginning of the story. There are two main roles, one that is played out in the dream, and the other one in reality, called respectively Nikhil and Nikki. The plot starts with the protagonist being in a state of coma and continuing only on life support. The film, from the beginning, tells two stories of the same person, one in colour and the other in black and white. Sanjay, a detective from the Mumbai police Crime Branch starts investigating the incident that caused the protagonist's (Sathish Ninasam) current state. While Sanjay is going through the protagonist's belongings he stumbles upon some scribbled notes and a mysterious pill. Meanwhile, the police capture two suspects and interrogate them. The story starts with Nikki in a village near Mandya, working as an usher/\\"torch-shiner\\" in a Bengaluru movie theatre owned by Shankranna (Achyuth Kumar). Nikki has insomnia and yearns for a companion. On one of his sleepless nights Nikki is contacted by a drug dealer who gives him Lucia pills as a solution to his sleeping problems. This drug is said to have the capacity to help one dream the life they want, but has the side-effect that upon discontinuation the same dreams turn into nightmares. With the help of the Lucia pills, Nikki starts seeing himself as being a successful actor called Nikhil surrounded by people he knows in the real world. Film actor Nikhil's life is depicted in black-and-white. Shankranna, the owner of the theater where Nikki works, had starred in a film in his youth funded by the leader of some goons who now want Shankranna to sign off his theatre for his debt. More events from the dream are followed by similar events in reality as Nikki falls in love with Shwetha (Sruthi Hariharan) who is a model in the dream and a waitress in reality. In the dream, Nikhil and Shwetha hit it off easily at the beginning but later friction arises when Nikhil expresses his discontent about Shwetha working in the film industry. Meanwhile, in reality, Nikki struggles to win Shwetha's heart, who rejects him first due to his low salary but later falls for his humble character. Shwetha's attempts to get Nikki educated and lead him to find a better paying job turns out to be futile and also result in the death of Shankranna in the hands of goons. Frustrated, Nikki chooses to leave Shwetha and continue to work in the theatre, despite the threats. Nikki redecorates the theatre and releases Shankranna's film to the audience. He later reconciles with Shwetha, who agrees to marry him. In the dream, Shankranna is kidnapped, and Nikhil rescues him with the help of the police. In the process, all of the goons are either arrested or killed except for the contract killer. Nikhil feels Shankranna is not safe with him and decides to fire him. Nikhil breaks up with Shwetha and sends off all his servants so as to be alone. Later, a visibly disturbed Nikhil finds himself in a thrashed room. Nikhil gets hold of a torch and through its light sees his life as a \\"torch-shiner\\" projected on the walls of the room. Shwetha is now distraught with being in the limelight and understands what Nikhil had tried to tell her. Nikhil, the actor, meets Shwetha and tells her that he cannot decide if the present moment is a dream or reality but he is ultimately happy. Asking Shwetha to close her eyes, Nikhil jumps off the roof to the confusion of everyone present, including the contract killer waiting to kill him. At present, Sanjay with the help of the suspects, performs a sting operation on the drug dealer and learns more about the Lucia pills. Meanwhile, Shwetha is caught in an attempt to kill Nikhil by pulling him off life support. During her interrogation, the whole investigating team along with Shwetha watches a re-run of an interview of the film star Nikhil. In the interview, Nikhil expresses his dissatisfaction of the stardom and reveals that he is actually color blind from an accident in his childhood. He tells the interviewer that he dreams of being a normal person and in fact in one of his dreams he is a \\"torch-shiner\\" who gets no attention from people and is happily in love with the dream of his life.It also revealed that Nikhil and Nikki both had insomnia and both consumed the Lucia pill. Sanjay is now convinced that Nikhil is living in his own version of reality and chose to live in that dream rather than in the real world by attempting suicide. Sanjay gets Shwetha to act and behave like she was in Nikhil's dream, and acts himself as if he was a contract killer and shoots the comatose Nikhil in the head with an empty gun. Simultaneously, Nikhil, aware and alive in his dream world finds everything disappearing around him and is killed by a shot to the head. Nikhi wakes up from his coma to see the astonished doctors and Shwetha's relieved face.thus,revealing that the character Nikki was a illusion whereas Nikhil was reality. At the end we can see Nikhil, Swetha and Shankaranna (who was dead in Nikhil's dream) enjoying pizza (Swetha worked as pizza waitress in Nikhil's dream) while they operate the projector of an old theater. Thus revealing that it was film star Nikhil's dream to be a commoner like Nikki, and he achieved it through Lucid dreams.

She is most well known for the work she did early in her career, along with then-husband Lowell Hokin, in the study of stimulated phosphoinositide turnover in secretory tissues, a key component of transmembrane signaling and many other cell regulatory processes which became known as the 'PI Effect'.  Early life  Mabel Ruth Neaverson was born to working-class parents in the Heeley district of Sheffield, England in early 1924. She had two younger sisters, Mary and Dorothy. Mabel took to academic pursuits at an early age, excelling in elementary and grammar school as well as at bible scholarship. She spent 1942 to 1943 working in the Women's Land Army, where, among other things, she helped administer a refugee camp for Czech Jews. (Mabel converted to Judaism ten years later.) She also became interested in costume design and theater, where she met her first husband, actor and playwright Dennis Davison. Mabel worked as a technician in the Medical Research Council Unit for Research in Cell Metabolism under Hans Krebs at the University of Sheffield from 1943 to 1946, and enrolled as a student in 1946, continuing to work for Krebs. Krebs recognized Mabel's scientific mind and talent in the laboratory, and urged her to pursue doctoral work, which she began in 1949 after receiving her Bachelor of Science Honors degree in Physiology. She did her graduate research under Quentin Gibson in the Physiology department. In a short time, Mabel met Krebs' graduate student Lowell Hokin, and the two began a romantic as well as professional relationship. Mabel received her Ph.D. in 1952.  Scientific career  Mabel and Lowell Hokin conducted research in fundamental biochemistry together from their doctoral research days in Sheffield, to their work at McGill University in the 1950s, up to the mid-1960s at the University of Wisconsin. From the mid-1960s, Mabel worked in her own areas of research with a particular focus on neurochemistry after she received a primary appointment in the Department of Psychiatry along with a joint appointment in the Department of Physiological Chemistry in the University of Wisconsin Medical School. Mabel and Lowell's most significant work came very early in their careers, and was first published in their seminal 1953 paper in the Journal of Biological Chemistry. In it, Mabel and Lowell described experiments in which they stimulated enzyme secretion in slices of pigeon pancreas in the presence of media containing the radioisotope P32. They found that the phospholipid fraction from the stimulated slices, formerly thought to contain fairly inert structural components of cell membranes, contained up to 9 times as much P32 as it did in the non-stimulated control samples. In a 1955 paper Lowell and Mabel showed that the bulk of the P32 went into phosphatidate and 'a phosphoinositide' that was later identified as phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns). They then showed that this metabolic response, which became known as the 'PI effect', occurred in a variety of stimulated tissues, such as pigeon pancreas (1958), suggesting that it plays a widespread role in cell regulation. Mabel and Lowell summarized their cell membrane biochemistry research in a 1965 article in Scientific American. In 1974, Mabel provided some of the first experimental evidence that launched the modern phase of work in this area (she published as M. Hokin-Neaverson after her 1971 divorce from Lowell). In the 1970s, Mabel became interested in the biochemistry of the brain, or neurochemistry, and, as a full professor, led the Laboratory for Neurochemistry Research in the Department of Psychiatry in the University of Wisconsin Medical School, which was conveniently located in the same building as the physiological chemistry, pharmacology, and anatomy departments, where her colleagues worked and from which she drew graduate students. She delved into undergraduate teaching at one point, teaching a course on drugs and the mind in the early 1970s, but her primary teaching activity was guiding graduate students and teaching graduate biochemistry courses. Unlike her earlier research, which exclusively employed animal tissues, Mabel also studied blood samples from humans, including mentally ill patients, and contributed to the understanding of the biochemical basis of mental illness, showing the first biochemical marker for one of the major psychoses. Mabel's assistant, Ken Sadeghian, worked with her from the 1960s until her retirement. Interest in the PI effect waned in the 1960s and 1970s, but experienced a resurgence in the 1980s due to advances in technology and understanding of cell membrane biochemistry. Mabel and Lowell became regarded as founders of an important and still growing field of biochemistry and cell biology ‚Äî the many roles of inositol phospholipids in cell function ‚Äî for which they were honored at a 1996 symposium at the University of Wisconsin that gathered their colleagues from around the world. Their early work was highlighted in a 20th anniversary review of the discovery of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate as a second messenger, and their 1953 and 1958 JBC articles were celebrated as \\"JBC Classics\\" in 2005.  Personal life  Most of Mabel's life was spent under a shadow cast by autoimmune illness. At the age of 16 she was diagnosed with lupus and given a dire prognosis for longevity. It turned out, however, to be a nonfatal autoimmune connective tissue disease with which Mabel struggled for the rest of her life. In the mid-1960s, treatment with steroids became established, and Mabel's steroid treatment led to degradation of her hip joints. She was an early recipient of artificial hips at Mayo Clinic in 1972. Mabel and Lowell had hoped to move to the United States after finishing their doctoral work in Sheffield, but Mabel's earlier activities as chair of the Sheffield University Socialist Society and member, along with then-husband Dennis Davison, of the Communist Party of Great Britain, led to her being blacklisted from entry into the United States during the McCarthy Era. Instead, Mabel and Lowell obtained positions at the Montreal General Hospital Research Institute at McGill University in 1953. While conducting research at McGill they petitioned the United States government to allow Mabel entry into the U.S., but it was not until 1957 that they were able to move to their new jobs in Wisconsin. From their arrival in Montreal in 1953 to their departure in 1957, Mabel was unable to attend any research conferences in the United States. Wisconsin was chosen for several reasons: Lowell received a junior faculty appointment in the Department of Physiological Chemistry, Mabel obtained a position in the department that allowed her to continue her research with Lowell, and Lowell's parents lived close by in Peoria, Illinois. Mabel had three children. In 1966 the family moved to a home on Lake Mendota, where Mabel lived for the rest of her life. Mabel and Lowell were divorced in 1971. In 1986, Mabel and Bernard Biales, who had worked in her lab at one time, began a relationship that lasted until her death. They married in hospice on July 22, 2003. Mabel Hokin died in Madison on August 17, 2003.

They claim lineage from migrants to Bengal from the ancient city of Kannauj who came at the request of Sena Dynasty kings in the 10th century. According to Tej Ram Sharma, an Indian historian, the office of Kayastha in Bengal was instituted before the Gupta period ( to 550 CE), although there is no reference to Kayastha as a caste at that time. He says some scholars have noted that, \\"originally the professions of Kayastha (scribe) and Vaidya (physician) were not restricted and could be followed by people from different varnas including the brahmanas. So there is every probability that a number of brahmana families were mixed up with members of other varnas in forming the present Kayastha and Vaidya communities of Bengal.\\" Historians P. C. Choudhuri, K. R. Medhi and K. L. Barua state that \\"the Brahmins noted in the Nidhanpur and Dubi inscriptions of king Bhaskaravarman\\" bore surnames \\"which are at present used by Kayasthas of Bengal and Nagara Brahmins of Gujarat,\\" and \\"were either of the Alpine origin or pre-Vedic Aryans.\\" Similarly, the Kayasthas and Kalitas of Assam \\"are also supposed to be descendants of extra-Vedic Aryans\\". According to Andr√© Wink, another historian, the caste is first referred to around the 5th‚Äì6th century CE, and may well have become so identified during the period of the Sena dynasty. Between that time and the 11th‚Äì12th century, this category of officials or scribes was composed of \\"putative\\" Kshatriyas and, \\"for the larger majority\\", Brahmins, who retained their caste identity or became Buddhists. As in South India, Bengal had lacked a clearly defined Kshatriya caste. The Pala, Sena, Chandra, and Varman dynasties and their descendants, who claimed the status of Kshatriya, \\"almost imperceptibly merged\\" with the Kayastha caste and became \\"the region's surrogate Kshatriya or warrior class\\". Sekhar Bandyopadhyay also places their emergence as a caste after the Gupta period. Referring to the linkages between class and caste in Bengal, he mentions that the Kayasthas along with the Brahmins and Baidyas, refrained from physical labour but controlled land, and as such represented \\"the three traditional higher castes of Bengal\\". Eaton mentions that the Kayasthas continued as the \\"dominant landholding caste\\" even after the Muslim conquests on the Indian subcontinent, and absorbed the descendants of the region's old Hindu rulers. Professor Julius J. Lipner mentions that the caste status of the Bengali Kayasthas is disputed, and says that while some authorities consider that they \\"do not belong to the twice-born orders, being placed high up among the Shudras; for other authorities they are on a level with Kshatriyas, and are accorded twice-born status.\\" In Bengal, between 1500 and 1850 CE, the Kayasthas were regarded as one of the highest Hindu castes in the region. Subcastes =Kulin Kayastha and Maulika Kayastha= According to Ronald Inden, an anthropologist, \\"many of the higher castes of India have historically been organised into ranked clans or lineages\\". The Bengali Kayastha was organised into smaller sub-castes and even smaller ranked grades of clans (kulas) around 1500 CE. The four major subcastes were Daksina-radhi, Vangaja, Uttara-radhi and Varendra. The Daksina-radhi and Vangaja subcastes were further divided into Kulina or Kulin (\\"high clan rank\\") and Maulika or Maulik, the lower clan rank. The Maulika had four further \\"ranked grades\\". The Uttara-radhi and Varendra used the terms \\"Siddha\\", \\"Sadhya\\", \\"Kasta\\" and \\"Amulaja\\" to designate the grades in their subcastes. =Origin myths= Kulin Kayasthas have an associated myth of origin stating that five Kayasthas accompanied the Brahmins from Kannauj who had been invited to Bengal by the mythological king Adisur. Multiple versions of this legend exist, all considered by historians to be myth or folklore lacking historical authenticity. According to Swarupa Gupta this legend was According to this legend, the five original Kayastha clans are Bose/Basu, Ghosh, Mitra, Guha, and Datta, the first four of whom became Kulin Kayasthas.

Sir George Chetwynd, 4th Baronet of Brocton Hall (31 May 1849 ‚Äì 10 March 1917) was the heir to the Chetwynd baronetcy upon the death of his father in 1869. Life Lady Florence Paget by Camille Silvy Chetwynd was born in Mayfair, London in 1849, the son of the 3rd Baronet and Lady Charlotte Augusta Hill, the daughter of the 3rd Marquess of Downshire. In 1870 he married Lady Florence Cecilia Paget, daughter of the 2nd Marquess of Anglesy and the widow of the 4th Marquess of Hastings. She was a great beauty, known as the \\"Pocket Venus\\". Their son George Guy Chetwynd, who became the 5th Baronet, was born in 1874. Sir George Chetwynd, 4th Baronet, was the High Sheriff of Warwickshire in 1875 and owned about 6700 acres in 1907. He was an owner of racing horses and a gambler.Sir George Chetwynd, 4th Bart. His first horses were purchased on his behalf by James Octavius Machell and kept at Bedford Cottage stables, Newmarket. At this time, Sir George was under age and his horses ran under the name of Mr Mortimer. When he came of age in 1870 he moved his horses to Hednesford to be near his residence of Grendon Hall in Warwickshire. Some of his notable successes include: winning of the 1877 Ascot Stakes by Chypre, winning of the 1883 Stewards' Cup at Goodwood by the 6-year old Hornpipe. and winning of the 1888 City and Suburban Handicap by the 5-year old Fullerton ridden by J. Woodburn. Sir George once declared that he made ¬£6,000 per year from racing. Charles Wood was Sir George's principal jockey. In 1887, Lord Durham gave a speech at the Gimcrack Club intimating wrongdoings with the running of the horses at Chetwynd's stable. Chetwynd's initial reaction was to challenge Durham to a duel. However, Durham called this cheap valour and allowed the matter to be settled by the Jockey Club. Chetwynd was only partly vindicated by the arbitration, awarded just a farthing in damages and had to pay his own costs. In consequence, he resigned from the Jockey Club. In 1885 Chetwynd was involved with a bout of fisticuffs in Hyde Park with Lord Lonsdale over the favours of Lillie Langtry. She had been out riding along Rotten Row with Lonsdale when she stopped to talk to Chetwynd. Remarks were passed between the two gentlemen before they came to blows and had to be parted. One evening in 1892 Chetwynd invited George Alexander Baird to dine with him at his London House, 36 Curzon Street. Baird expressed his admiration for the house and Chetwynd sold it to him on the spot with all fixtures and fitting. Baird woke next morning in the master bedroom, the new owner, confused and hung over.

In 2013, Eric Joyce, Member of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom for Falkirk, resigned from the Labour Party and announced he would not seek re-election. The process of nominating a replacement candidate for the 2015 General Election led to a dispute between the party and its major financial backer Unite the Union, causing the suspension of two local party members, the resignation of Tom Watson MP as Labour's 2015 election strategist, and the forwarding of an internal report into the situation to Police Scotland. Background Eric Joyce, the outgoing member. Eric Stuart Joyce was selected as the Labour Party candidate and subsequently voted in as Member of Parliament for Falkirk at the 2010 general election. After a series of alcohol-related incidents, including a drink- driving conviction and two fights in a House of Commons bar, Joyce resigned from the Labour Party, saying that he intended to complete his term as an MP but not seek re-election. Selection process The selection process for a new Labour prospective parliamentary candidate (PPC) for Falkirk began in late 2012. Until Joyce had resigned his membership of the Labour Party in February 2012, the membership of Falkirk West Constituency Labour Party (CLP), which makes-up 70% of the total electoral constituency, stood at fewer than 100 members. Soon after Joyce's resignation, Stephen Deans - a local shop steward who had risen to become chairman for Unite in Scotland - became chair of the Falkirk West CLP. In line with the then Unite policy, and also within the Labour Party rules in force at the time, Deans began recruiting Unite members, mainly from the local Ineos Grangemouth Refinery, where Unite had been involved in a pensions dispute in 2008, as new members of the Falkirk West CLP, and paying their membership fees. By January 2013, membership of the Falkirk West CLP stood at over 200 members, all of whom were entitled to vote in the process to select a new parliamentary candidate. Although he was now no longer a member of the Labour Party, Joyce, whose own actions had been at the root of the need to select a new candidate, blogged about allegations arising from unnamed persons, supposedly, he claimed, to \\"flood\\" the CLP with Unite members. Joyce was threatened with legal action via a solicitor's letter from Unite. It became clear that the recruitment efforts of Unite were in support of a particular potential candidate, Karie Murphy. A leaked Unite document from December 2012 detailed its activity in Falkirk as \\"exemplary\\" for the way in which \\"we have recruited well over 100 Unite members to the party in a constituency with less than 200 members. 57 came from responses to a text message alone, (followed up face to face). A collective effort locally, but led and inspired by the potential candidate\\". The constituency decided to adopt the process provided by the national Labour Party for an all-women's shortlist, with the CLP Executive Committee agreeing, by consensus, to consult on this question, but two of the other prospective candidates, Linda Gow, a former leader of Falkirk Council, and Gregor Poynton, UK political director at communications firm Blue State, publicly wrote to all constituency members asking for an open contest. In February 2013, the selection process for the new PPC was deferred to the Labour Party's National Executive Committee (NEC). In March, the NEC proposed that the process be scrutinised by the Labour Party organisation sub-committee, and that an internal NEC report on allegations be completed, covering the perceived promoting of Karie Murphy (a former Chair of the Scottish Labour Party, and Unite's preferred candidate), as PPC, and the mass recruitment of Unite members to the constituency, with their membership fees being paid en bloc by the union. Joyce commented after the National Executive Committee (NEC) report was handed to the police that - As a result of the NEC investigation, Murphy withdrew her name from the selection process. Stephen Deans, who was still the chair of both Unite Scotland and the Falkirk West CLP, said the suspension of the PPC selection process by the NEC was an attack on the union by a \\"Blairite rump\\", and that \\"the decision taken is purely an attack on the work Unite has been doing in the constituency to recruit its members into the Labour Party\\". Both Murphy and Deans were later briefly suspended by the Labour Party in light of the contents of an NEC internal report in June 2013. Investigation In May 2013 whilst speaking at the annual Progress conference, former MP and business secretary Lord Mandelson claimed that a cabal at the top of the NEC were trying to exert influence, and warned Labour Party leader Ed Miliband that he \\"was storing up danger for himself and for a future Labour government over parliamentary selections\\". On 25 June 2013, in the light of allegations claimed to be contained within the completed NEC internal report, Labour Party Central Office in London implemented \\"special measures\\" under the Labour Party constitution, and took direct control of candidate selection in Falkirk. A spokesperson commented: The NEC later concluded that anyone who had joined the Labour Party in Falkirk after 12 March 2012, when Eric Joyce announced he was stepping down, would not be allowed to take part in the selection process. The NEC then suspended provisional candidate Karie Murphy and Falkirk party chairman Stephen Deans, a decision which Unite the Union criticised. On 27 June, Unite General Secretary Len McCluskey wrote to his members with regards to the NEC special measures process: On 2 July former Labour Home Secretary David Blunkett MP speaking on BBC Two's Daily Politics said the party had \\"taken the right step by having an investigation\\" and said he hoped the NEC would \\"deal with it decisively\\". Blunkett went on to say he thought the party should publish the internal report, adding that Labour \\"should be as transparent as possible\\". However, a Labour Party spokesperson later said that it was standard practice not to publish the NEC's internal reports. On 4 July, Tom Watson MP resigned as Labour's 2015 general election campaign co- ordinator, though he remained in place as Deputy Chair of the Labour Party. Watson confirmed that provisional Falkirk candidate Karie Murphy had been his office manager prior to her selection. After the NEC had been briefed by the party solicitor on 4 July, on 5 July Ed Miliband announced that the party was to refer the NEC internal report into allegations of irregularities in the selection of a PPC in Falkirk to Police Scotland, after confirming that the NEC internal inquiry had shown irregularities in the Falkirk Labour Party's candidate selection process. The Conservative member of parliament Henry Smith then wrote to the Chief Constable of Scotland, Sir Stephen House, asking for an investigation, suggesting that Unite might have committed fraud. On 25 July Police Scotland concluded that there were insufficient grounds to support an investigation. A spokesman for Police Scotland told the BBC: \\"Following a comprehensive review of all material submitted, Police Scotland has concluded there are insufficient grounds to support a criminal investigation at this time. However, should further information come to light this will be looked into.\\" Consequences Karen Whitefield was later chosen as the Labour candidate for Falkirk. Murphy and Deans were suspended by the Labour Party in the light of submission of the NEC internal report in June 2013. Murphy had withdrawn her candidature for the PPC position and was later reinstated as a party member after having her name cleared of any wrongdoing. The Labour Party immediately changed its rules, to prevent affiliated unions from paying the Labour Party membership fees for their members to be individual members of constituency Labour parties. The Guardian reported in July 2013 that the row had also led to a former cabinet minister and other \\"senior party figures\\" calling for the Labour Party to break its formal links with the trade union movement. A re-selection was held on 8 December 2013. Karen Whitefield, who had not been involved in the controversy, was chosen as the prospective candidate for Falkirk. At the general election of May 2015, Labour's share of the vote in the Falkirk constituency fell by 20.6%, with the Scottish National Party gaining the seat on a 24.1% swing, which was typical of the swing from Labour to the SNP in Scotland.

The plot is explained in the second tale, which is as follows: King Chitra Singh of Chitravati married a damsel of Indra's kingdom. She gave birth to a son, Hanuvant Singh. The damsel deserted the king when he grew old. He ordered all of his employees to find her, but instead found another similar looking girl named Chitramati. Chitramati was the daughter of the ruler of Orissa. To marry her, he had a fight with her father, the ruler of Orissa. Chitramati was about the age of the son of Chitra Singh, Hanuvant Singh. She grew heavily attracted to him and tried to seduce him into a sexual relationship, but Hanuvant Singh was religious in thought and did not go for incest. She in turn created a drama and accused Hanuvant Singh of raping her. King Chitra Singh believed her blindly, without knowing the side of his son, and sentenced him to death. Mantri, the wise adviser of the King, knew that the King's second wife, Chitramati, was not of a pious character and was falsely blaming Hanuvant Singh. In order to prevent the wrongful execution of Hanuvant Singh, the adviser shared various accounts of stories depicting different situations, with the intention of making the King realize his folly and improve his decision-making skill.Charitar 2, Charitropakhyan, Dasam Granth List of Tales Following is the list of tales present in Dasam Granth: Summary of Tales The following are the summaries of several tales, translated from the work of Dr Rattan Singh Jaggi steek of Dasam Granth = 98. Tale Of Heer Ranjha = Applicable Age: 14+ Years to 100 Ranjha was an avatar of Indra and Heer was avatar of Apsara Meneka who was given abhi-shaap (curse) by Rishi Kapil to get born on Matlok. Rishi kapil was visiting inderlok when he got opportunity to saw Menaka for first time in king Inder darbar and his \\"Biraj\\" fell on seeing her. This led to rishi kapil cursing Menaka in anger! \\" you will take birth in Matlok. Ranjha was born near river chenab at house of chitar devi. As years went by a great famine came and only those people survived who were rich. Ranjha mother during famine in order to survive, sold him to a Jat family and he became an attractive young man whosoever girl saw him, fell for him saying \\"Ranjha Ranjha\\" the famous couplet popular in today times. Similarly Heer ended up being born into Choochak Clan. As the epic moves forward they fell in love and heer was married to Khera family as her father doesn't agree with Ranjha. Now Ranjha becomes a beggar and joins the Doli (Marriage) party of heer during her marriage. When ranjha gets a chance with heer alone they both suicide together and leave for Swarga back into their positions of Indra and Meneka. The authors today sing this Plot(Charitar).

Tale of Clever Woman = Applicable Age: 14+ Years to 100 In Raghu- kul an king named Roopeswar was a famous and respected in Nagar of Ropar(Today Punjab). He had a queen named \\"Chittar Kumari\\" and she was very beautiful and no other woman was equally beautiful to her. A Danav(Demon) came over from Lanka to Ropar. He was enticed by the Rani and Danav mind got fixed on her. The king called his bishops for consulting to get rid of Danav. And they sent a powerful (Mullah)Muslim general to fight him off and mullah challenged Danav with his power. Danav responded by lifting the castle around him in one hand and Mullah in other and he placed castle on his head as if he is the pillar supporting him and the castle fell on him and this is how he sent the mullah to Jampur (City of Death). Then, the king sent his second Muslim general, who Danav lifted from legs and banged him on earth and killed him. Then came another one who he picked and threw in the river. Then came a women in front of Danav, and she started praising the dana and this pacified the Danav. She enticed the Danav. She fed the Danav with various kind of Food and Wines, which made Danav Happy. She started doing this every day for him and he started trusting her more and more. One day she sat sad in front of her and Danav asked her, you take good care of me and you ask nothing for return. Tell me what you want, why are you sad and I will fulfill your wish. He asked 2 or 3 times and she responded by saying. I am bothered by an Asur (Demon) and I don't think you can do anything about it. Hearing this the Danav wrote a Jantar for her and told her take this and whosoever sees it once will be burned to ashes. She smartly took it from him and opened it and showed him immediately. The Danav saw it himself and burned himself to ashes. Learning: Thus, the Danav who could not have been even won over by powerful \\"kings of kings\\" Indra ended up being deceived (Charitar) by a simple woman. = 101.

He is the founding member, main songwriter and mastermind behind the AOR all star projects Shining Line and Charming Grace. Musician career Monti founded his first band (called Sovversivo) in 1999, leaving it in 2004 to pursue a personal career in Melodic Rock and AOR music. In 2008 he founded, with his longtime friend Amos Monti, an AOR all-star project called Shining Line, that was officially released in 2010 by German label Avenue Of Allies Music, receiving acclaim from fans and critics. In 2011 he founded, with Italian singer/songwriter Stefano Lionetti and Italian progressive rock mastermind Alessandro Del Vecchio, a new AOR project called Lionville, released the same year by Avenue Of Allies Music. He took part in the recording sessions playing drums and providing lyrics for all the tracks of the album, except for the cover songs \\"Thunder In Your Heart\\" (originally recorded and performed by John Farnham) and \\"World Without Your Love\\" (originally written by Richard Marx and Bruce Gaitsch). In the same year he started to work together with his bandmate in Shining Line Amos Monti on a new AOR project called Charming Grace, involving in it their label mate Davide Barbieri (of Wheels Of Fire fame) as third official main member. In 2012 he appeared as guest musician playing drums on two melodic rock releases: AOR \\"L.A. Temptation\\" (released by AOR Heaven) and Chasing Violets \\"Outside Heaven\\" (released by Perris Records). In the same year he also provided his songwriting contribution composing lyrics for two more official releases: Wheels Of Fire \\"Up For Anything\\" (Avenue Of Allies Music) and Lionville \\"II\\" (Avenue Of Allies Music), and wrote and performed (together with producer Alessandro Del Vecchio) a new song called \\"Melody Rocks\\", which became the official anthem for the world-renowned site Melodicrock.com (the song is available into the official compilation of the website, MRCD9 \\"15 Years Later\\" released the same year). In 2013, Charming Grace was finally released by Avenue Of Allies Music. Monti appears in it once again as drummer and main songwriter, and for the first time in the role of co-producer, supporting the work of Davide Barbieri. The album received critical acclaim across the world, including highly positive reviews just like \\"Hot Album\\" (by Ant Heeks) and \\"Spot On Album\\" (Melodic Round-Up column by Dave Ling) in the UK issues of the renowned printed magazines Fireworks and Classic Rock. In November 2013, due to the very good feedbacks received from the melodic rock community, Charming Grace was signed by Japanese-based label Rubicon Music for a release in Japan (official release date: 18 December 2013). The Japanese version contains an exclusive bonus track called \\"Start All Over Again\\", which is not included in the standard cd format of the album. Year 2014 sees the official announcement of a brand new melodic rock project called Room Experience (led by Italian songwriter Gianluca Firmo and fronted by Pink Cream 69 / Voodoo Circle's singer David Readman ), with Monti involved in the roles of co-producer and drummer. On the songwriting side, he provided his contribution to the come- back of ex-Vanilla Ninja Lenna Kuurmaa under the moniker \\"Moonland\\", penning the song \\"Over Me\\" in collaboration with Davide Barbieri and Alessandro Del Vecchio. In 2015 Room Experience is scheduled for release on May 22 via MelodicRock Records. The album is launched in two different formats: a standard edition with eleven tracks, and a strictly limited edition with 3 bonus tracks (and alternate cover artwork) available only for the pre-orders submitted on the official label's website. In the second half of the year, Monti recruited all together members from various Italian melodic rock bands and projects under the name of \\"I.F.O.R\\" (a.k.a. \\"Italian Forces Of Rock\\"). The result of this collaboration is the single \\"We Still Rock\\" (co-written and co-produced by Monti itself), launched to the audience with a YouTube video on the official Melodicrock.it YouTube Channel, and scheduled for the digital release via Tanzan Music on 14 December 2015. Year 2016 sees Monti founding (together with Davide Barbieri) Raintimes, a brand new melodic rock project which marks the come-back of Von Groove's frontman Michael Shotton as lead vocalist on a full-length studio album after more than 10 years. The debut, which is scheduled for release in early 2017 via Frontiers Music SRL, is going to cover stylistically the classic AOR/Melodic Rock sound of 90's act The Storm. In the meanwhile the brand new co-operation with Frontiers Music SRL is established with the release of the second musical chapter of First Signal (one of the label's own studio projects, feat. Harry Hess on Vocals), with Monti appearing in the songwriting credits thanks to the song \\"Love Gets Through\\" (written in collaboration with Davide Barbieri and Dave Zublena), launched as first single on YouTube in a lyric-video format. In the same year the single \\"We Still Rock\\" has been included in a s/t compilation released by Italian label Tanzan Music, which sees the involvement, in the final tracklist, of some of the most known melodic rock and AOR acts coming from Italy. Monti appears involved in further tracks inside the compilation, included the brand new song \\"Gotta Get Away\\" from Charming Grace, a tune created appositely as official soundtrack of \\"Hold On! - Tomorrow\\", fourth chapter of the #1 Amazon sci-fi saga \\"Hold On!\\" by English independent novelist Peter Darley.. Again in 2016 Monti signed a deal with Street Symphonies Records for the official reissue of Shining Line's debut album, which includes in this new edition an exclusive bonus track called \\"This Is Our Life\\" previously unreleased.. In 2018 Italian independent label Burning Minds Music Group announced Monti as new official A&R; Director, establishing a partnership born in 2016 after the release of the official Shining Line's reissue. In the same year Monti was announced as official producer for the new studio album of three different artists: Italian hard-rockers Alchemy, international melodic rock project Room Experience, and melodic rock project Streetlore.

At that point Ramakrishna does not feel anything for relationship, as he is wealthy and he has his mother by his side for uninterrupted love. Suddenly, Charanya gets ill and dies. Ramakrishna who has seen nothing except for his mother's love and money, feels for someone to care about him for the first time. He searches for his long lost relatives in a village, mentioned by his mother earlier. He wants to feel true love, so he disguises himself as a poor man and joins as a servant in Vijayakumar‚Äôs house, who is the Village's head. Later he finds out that Vijaykumar is his father, and feels happy about it. Vijay Kumar also feels happy for getting his son back. While he was planning to tell the village folks that Ramakrishna is his son, he dies of a heart attack. Now, Ramakrishna is left without support for the second time in his life.

It is revealed in the final story arc that Hidenori's girlfriend has been missing for years, and that Hidenori has been texting himself and saving all of her texts from before her disappearance in order to keep his sanity. Haiji uses this against him by tying him up and deleting all of his girlfriend's texts, so that he could drive Hidenori mad and force him to kill him. =Mineral Miracle Muse / Flamenco Girls= ; : : One of the members of the female idol group , who serves as the composer and lyricist.

Mari has a fetish for men in uniform, as she begins to blush whenever she sees Hidenori wearing his police uniform and tries to get him to dress up for her. After being kidnapped and tortured by King Torture, Mari develops a distant, angry personality and a hatred for superheroes, living and hiding at Hidenori's apartment. She later explains to her companions that she went into hiding out of shame and feelings of inferiority towards Moe, reconciling with her friends and taking up the Flamenco Diamond identity once more.

After finding Mari in hiding, she learns that Mari ran away because of feelings of inferiority towards her. The two reconcile with a kiss and the Flamenco Girls become heroes again. Like Mizuki, she was also poisoned by Haiji. =Samurai Sentai Flamenger= ; : : Recruited by Joji to be one of the Flamengers, he joins the team as , number V, and acts as the team's weapons specialist. In his spare time he farms with and cares for his sickly grandfather, who is attacked by Haiji later on to agitate Masayoshi. He is 24 years old. ; : : The only female member of the Flamengers, she joins the team as , number III, acting as the team's public relations official. She enjoys knitting despite considering it an overly feminine hobby and joined the team because of her crush on her \\"darling\\" Joji Kaname, which causes constant friction with Kaname's wife. She hails from a rich family, but was disowned because of her obsession with Kaname. They accept her again after the world-threatening danger is over. Momoi is incredibly proud of her long hair, and is traumatized when Haiji Sawada cuts it. ; : : Soichi is a longtime friend of Joji who joins the Flamengers as , number II, acting as the team's second-in-command and strongest fighter. He originally rejected Masayoshi's position as the leader, wanting to be Flamen Red himself due to his friendship and dedication to Joji, but eventually grows to respect Masayoshi. Despite looking very young, he is the oldest member of the team at 28 years old. He has been friends with Joji for about ten years and eventually works with him, acting in superhero shows as the hero \\"Neo Axe.\\" Haiji later used Soichi's connections with Joji as a premise to trash his apartment and destroy any Red Axe memorabilia in order to agitate Masayoshi. ; : : The stoic member of the \\"Flamengers\\" who becomes , number IV, the team's strategist and tactical analyst. He is 22 years old, having a sister and young niece in town. When he later goes to graduate school after the defeat of Alien Flamenco, he acquires a number of female fans, who cause him constant annoyance. Midorikawa is passionate about learning and cares deeply for his young niece, weaknesses that Haiji Sawada exploits along with shredding and destroying his favorite book. =Antagonists= ; : :King Torture is a criminal who loves torturing his victims. All of the monsters he sends to Japan are hypnotized by him and commit crimes that slowly become more ridiculous and pointless in order to appear harmless and draw attention away from King Torture's ultimate plan to unite all of humanity into a single hive- minded monster to create true \\"evil\\" peace. He was a boy who was taken with superheroism just like Masayoshi, only in his case he was taken with the evil side instead of the just, as he claims superheroism is a pointless, thankless job which never leads to the peace that heroes promise. He claims that the monsters he sent all agreed to the transformation procedure and willingly put their lives on the line for their shared dream, and as such immortalizes them in a shrine containing their caskets. King Torture is so fanatically devoted to being a villain, he willingly amputates his own arm to attach a chainsaw to defeat Masayoshi and turn him into his latest cyborg comrade. King Torture is killed when he is impaled on the sharp severed limb of one of his life size figures and activates the missile that will kickstart the transformation of humanity before dying of his wounds. Hidenori manages to destroy the missile with a motorcycle at the last second, ending Torture's plans. Upon death, King Torture's monsters will shout \\"Viva Torture.\\" ; :From Beyond is an alien organization that provided Torture with the power to make monsters. From Beyond often uses stylish promotional videos to introduce the next monster that it sends to the Earth. The organization is broken up into smaller groups which are confronted by the Flamengers one by one. Upon death, From Beyond's monsters recite the oath \\"From Beyond to Heaven.\\" The closest thing the group has to a leader is \\"Beyond Flamenco\\", a mysterious being that looks identical to Masayoshi and claims to be his brother, but who is actually a version of Masayoshi brought to this universe by Alien Flamenco who, in his crusade to destroy evil, abandoned his ideals. Beyond Flamenco commits suicide with Masayoshi's gun and the entire remaining membership of From Beyond vanishes. ; : :Prime Minister of Japan. He spearheads an anti-vigilante campaign in order to raise his approval rating to 100%. He possesses a special suit of armor that grows stronger the higher his approval rating. The \\"F\\" in his name stands for \\"Flamenco,\\" a quirk that makes Masayoshi realize that the word appears everywhere. He was later ousted after unknowingly telling the public (thanks to Konno's streaming of the battle between Masayoshi & Goto and the Prime Minister) that he spearheaded the anti-vigilante campaign to boost his approval rating and not even caring about the citizens. In actuality, he was attempting to raise his approval ratings so that the suit would be powerful enough to defeat Alien Flamenco. ; : :A grey-haired kid in a group of middle- school delinquents who were advised to return home instead of staying out at night, in episode 1. He later appears after the defeat of Alien Flamenco, setting off an explosive that destroys Masayoshi's apartment and revealing that he had been repeating the word \\"flamenco\\" to himself over and over ever since their first meeting as well as being the person responsible for uploading the video of Masayoshi's initial campaign as Samurai Flamenco. He admits to being obsessed with Samurai Flamenco, and to wanting to look special in Masayoshi's eyes, going so far as to turn evil \\"for him\\" by attacking Masayoshi's loved ones. Officially he died of illness one year ago, a ruse perpetrated by his parents, a fact known and told by Konno, who had tracked them. Sawada is an expert at staying under the radar, causing Masayoshi to initially suspect that the boy only exists in his mind. However, near the end, Kaname (who heard Haiji with his Axe Ears moments before being run over) and Hidenori (who encountered him during his capture by the boy) also saw and know of his existence. His goal for agitating Masayoshi and his targeting of his loved ones is to turn Masayoshi into \\"Samurai Flamenco Darkness\\", an anti- hero, something he planned to fulfill by having Hidenori kill him in order to \\"scar\\" Masayoshi and give him the tragic backstory required of an anti-hero. That ultimately failed when Masayoshi refused to put on the suit and decides to accept Haiji's \\"love\\" and eventually, he was beaten up by Mari (as Flamenco Diamond) for poisoning her friends. For his crimes, he was placed into either a juvenile facility or a mental ward for his crimes and though he vowed that he will go after Masayoshi again, the latter welcomed it, provided he doesn't target his friends again, putting Haiji somewhat at ease =Other characters= ; : : An action actor who was the star of the hero TV show called , he now likes to travel all around the world visiting his fans. He once claimed that he was Samurai Flamenco, but later becomes Masayoshi's combat trainer after he claims to the media that Samurai Flamenco is his pupil, inspired by Masayoshi's strong sense of justice. Joji is rarely around to train Masayoshi, however, due to his travels. After the fall of King Torture, Joji reveals that he is a member of a secret organization and recruits Masayoshi and four other youngsters to become the \\"Flamengers,\\" explaining his frequent absences and flighty nature. He also eventually reveals that he actually is Red Axe, and has been really fighting monsters alongside other tokusatsu heroes like \\"Harakiri Sunshine\\" in secret for years. He is 43 years old. His wife is also a tokusatsu hero, \\"Lady Axe.\\" He is critically injured when hit by a truck in an event orchestrated by Haiji Sawada. He eventually recovers and later becomes the director of a museum dedicated to heroes. ; : : A middle-aged man who works in the development department for the stationery company, Monsters Stationery, who provides Masayoshi with \\"legal\\" weapons disguised as stationery to assist in his crime- fighting work, even though his inventions were once confiscated by the government right after Masayoshi join the Flamengers. He is 48 years old. Harazuka habitually wears a protective garment of his own design under his clothing in the event of an assassination attempt, something that helped him escape grave injuries after being pushed down the stairs by Haiji. ; : : A competent, strict manager for the entertainment production company Caesar Pro. She is Masayoshi's employer and despite suspecting that he is Samurai Flamenco, she works hard to protect his identity until he reveals it to the public. She is 28 years old and dislikes Konno's attentions towards her. After being saved by Samurai Flamenco, she becomes nicer. She suspects that Got≈ç and Masayoshi are dating, and encourages Masayoshi to talk to Got≈ç whenever he has problems. She eventually reveals to Masayoshi that she had known he was Samurai Flamenco long before he publicly outed himself. ; : : Manager of the website High Rollers Hi!, a news website, he takes an interest in Samurai Flamenco and schemes to discover his true identity. He is 31 years old and has an interest in Ishihara despite her rejecting his advances - he asks her to marry him when he's in the midst of being tortured. After being tortured by King Torture, he leaves the country to recuperate. He films the video of challenge that Mari sends to King Torture, and also films the battle of the Prime Minister versus Samurai Flamenco. ; : : First name unknown. Got≈ç's co- worker at the police box, and the section chief. He prefers to keep his mind on work. He knows that Got≈ç cares for Masayoshi. He was watching them when Masayoshi first returned Got≈ç's shirt from dry-cleaning to the police box, and has been present many times when Got≈ç was researching Samurai Flamenco on his laptop.

The genre is RPG. Reception The series' early episodes have been notorious for its take on the lead character facing criminals without supernatural abilities and the episodes focused on the introducing the cast which have often been found likeable. Although Carl Kimlinger from Anime News Network found the early episodes underwhelming, he noted the show became more entertaining the more episodes he watched. Otaku USAs Joseph Luster compared these episodes with the films Kick-Ass and James Gunn's Super noting that Samurai Flamenco employed similar elements in its own fashion. David Cabrera from the same site listed it as his favorite series from 2013 due to its transitions that allow for several events to happen across the series. Cabrera notes that starting in episode 7, Samurai Flamenco goes through a genre shift that surprised reviewers. Kimlinger commented that the new story arc \\"would qualify as a baffling train wreck, if only the arc wasn't so... good\\" highly praising the execution of its episodes based on the mixture between the character's actions and the sci-fi elements. Luster had a similar reaction, commenting how this transition allowed further character development to Masayoshi and his friends as they had to deal with the new threat. Despite enjoying these episodes, Andy Hanley from UK Anime Network feared the story might take itself too seriously resulting in unappealing episodes. Kimlinger addressed the second half of the series by stating that \\"at first each new twist and bizarre addition is greeted with shock and bafflement. But as with any magic trick, the novelty eventually wears off, and the conspicuous lack of a real narrative payoff begins to weigh heavily on us, dulling our reaction to a kind of half-bored curiosity at what will come out next\\" criticizing the delivery of certain story arcs and describing some plot twists as nonsensical, while still giving praise to its sense of humor and lack of stagnation. The series has also been criticized for its poor animation with Hanley finding episode 11 to be one of the most badly animated ones.

Early years Fran√ßois-Marie-Joseph Malcor Deydier de Pierrefeu was born on 3 March 1891 in Aix-en-Provence, Bouches-du-Rh√¥ne. His parents were Louis-Marie-Victor-Henri Malcor Deydier de Pierrefeu, who had independent means, and Th√©r√®se de Villeneuve-Escaplon. He was a brilliant secondary student and won the first prize for Philosophy. He was admitted to the √âcole Polytechnique in 1911. During World War I (1914-1918) he served in Naval Aviation. He was made a knight of the Legion of Honour in 1918. Career After leaving the navy de Pierrefeu devoted himself in part to applied science and technology, in particular to urban planning, and in part to intellectual speculation inspired by the symbolism of numbers and forms. In August 1924 he married Fanita d'Onthcorn. As an engineer, de Pierrefeu was prime contractor for the Oued-Beth Dam in the region of Meknes, Morocco. He then became director of the company Grands travaux hydrauliques de Marseille (Great Hydraulic Works of Marseille). In January 1931 Philippe Lamour founded Plans with a group of syndicalists that included Dr. Pierre Winter, Fran√ßois de Pierrefeu, Herbert Lagardelle and Le Corbusier. Plans was an avant-garde journal that covered urban planning. The magazine moved leftward in the spring of 1932, and ceased publication in the fall of 1932. In the fall of 1933 Le Corbusier founded its successor, Pr√©lude with Winter, de Pierrefeu. and Lagardelle, who acted as co-editors. De Pierrefeu also contributed to journals such as L'Homme r√©el and Voici la France de ce mois. Le Corbusier invited de Pierrefeu to purchase an apartment in the block at 24 Rue Nungesser et Coli in Paris which Le Corbusier and Pierre Jeanneret had built in 1931-1934. He was in the original list of occupants of 14 April 1934, as was Winter. Before the Vichy government took power, de Pierrefeu worked with Le Corbusier and the playwright Jean Giraudoux on a government study commission on housing. Using the results of this study, in 1942 de Pierrefeu and Le Corbusier published La Maison des hommes, which they had co-authored. On 27 May 1941 Le Corbusier, de Pierrefeu and Andr√© Boll were assigned by the Vichy government to a commission to study developing a national construction policy. They were to make inquiries wherever they thought would be useful in France, the empire and other countries. However, on 14 July 1941 the government cancelled the project. Fran√ßois de Pierrefeu's second wife was Maria de Hantoin, a widow with a passion for spiritualism and catharism. In the aftermath of the Second World War, de Pierrefeu took up residence at the Ritz, where he maintained relations and correspondence with mathematicians and philosophers of his time including Ren√© Gu√©non, Raymond Abellio and F. Vassilenko of the Coll√®ge de France. Fran√ßois de Pierrefeu died in 1959 at the chateau of Gairoird in Cuers, Var.

Trefusis was still Adjutant at Sandhurst when World War I broke out in August 1914. The Irish Guards went to France immediately as part of the British Expeditionary Force, and Trefusis joined them as a reinforcement on 18 September, following the battalion's heavy losses at Villers-Cott√©r√™ts during the Retreat from Mons and at the First Battle of the Aisne. He resumed his former position as Adjutant, replacing a wounded officer.Kipling, pp. 34‚Äì7, 39‚Äì44, 45.Edmonds, 1914, Vol I, pp. 260‚Äì2 & 320‚Äì3.Caffrey, pp. 153‚Äì6, 191‚Äì2. =Commanding 1st Irish Guards= The Irish Guards were involved in bitter fighting during the First Battle of Ypres,Edmonds, 1914, Vol II, pp. 156, 200, 237, 272, 294, 356‚Äì7, 394‚Äì5.Kipling, pp. 52‚Äì65.Caffrey, pp. 256‚Äì66. especially at Nonne Boschen, by the end of which the battalion had been reduced to two companies under a handful of officers, and Trefusis (a Major since September) was acting Commanding Officer.Edmonds, 1914, Vol II, pp. 407, 414, 437.Kipling, p. 65. He was later confirmed in the position and promoted to Temporary Lieutenant-Colonel.Kipling, p. 291. He was awarded a DSO on 16 February 1915 and was also Mentioned in Dispatches.Kipling p. 296. Trefusis proved a popular and effective Commanding Officer,Kipling, p. 109. who led the battalion through the battles of Neuve Chapelle and Festubert (where the Irish Guards again lost heavily), and during the trench and mine warfare around Ypres and Cuinchy.Kipling, pp. 86‚Äì108. In August, 'the C.O., Colonel Trefusis, was telephoned word that he was to command the 20th Brigade and was pathetically grieved at his promotion. He hated leaving the Battalion which, after eleven months of better or worse, he had come to look upon as his own' (Kipling). =Commanding 20th Brigade= Trefusis took over as commander of 20th Brigade in 7th Division on 16 August 1915.Becke, p. 82. This made him at the time the youngest brigadier in the Army. Although not formally designated a Guards brigade, his command had contained two Guards battalions, but these just had been withdrawn to join a new Guards Division and replaced by two 'Kitchener's Army' battalions (8th and 9th) of the Devonshire Regiment fresh from England. He also had two Regular battalions (2nd Border Regiment and 2nd Gordon Highlanders) and one Territorial Force battalion (6th Gordon Highlanders) in a very mixed command.Becke, p. 84. Less than six weeks after his arrival, Trefusis commanded 20th Bde in the Battle of Loos. On the opening day of the British attack (25 September 1915), as the right-hand brigade in 7th Division, 20th Bde's first objective was Breslau Trench, then the successive German lines of Gun Trench and Cit√© Trench.Edmonds, 1915, Vol II, p. 229. When Trefusis examined the German wire in front of his brigade on the evening before the attack, he found that it was largely uncut by the artillery bombardment and sent forward parties after dark to cut it by hand.Atkinson, p. 204. The brigade attacked at 06.00 in a gas cloud ‚Äì the first British use of chemical warfare ‚Äì but this was relatively ineffective, and hindered the attacking infantry. However, the artillery had done a good job in front of 2nd Gordons, and within 10 minutes the leading waves of were in the German front trench, although at a heavy cost. In front of 8th Devons, the guns had done less damage and the battalion suffered over 600 casualties. Nevertheless, the two battalions took Breslau Trench and captured some German guns. They advanced to the Lens road, where they were joined by the second wave (6th Gordons and 2nd Border). 2nd Border then took Gun Trench and settled down to defend their gains. Trefusis now sent forward his reserve battalion, 9th Devons, to push on to Cit√© Trench, but they suffered severely from artillery fire crossing the captured ground, as did the division's reserve brigade.Cherry, pp. 89‚Äì97.Edmonds, 1915, Vol II, pp. 228‚Äì34. At 01.00 the following morning, a strong German counter-attack pushed the brigade's advanced posts back to Gun Trench, which had been put into a state of defence. After fierce hand-to-hand fighting, the leading Germans were thrown out of Gun Trench, which became the British front line.Cherry, p. 171.Edmonds, 1915, p. 301. Trefusis's brigade had suffered severely on the first day, but on 26 September it maintained its position and its bombers supported a renewed attack by neighbouring British troops on a position known as The Quarries.Cherry, pp. 226‚Äì7. When the Guards Division moved up in support on 27 September, 1st Irish Guards found itself behind positioned 20th Brigade, which 'was in no shape for further fighting, but was hanging on in expectation of relief, if possible, from the mixed duties of trying to establish a line and sending out parties to assist in repelling the nearest counter-attack. Fighting continued everywhere, ... and heavy rain added to the general misery' (Kipling). The Irish Guards' historian recorded that Trefusis 'slips, or wades, through rain and mud to lunch with his old Battalion a few hundred yards away ... Then he goes on with the remnants of his shattered Brigade, to take over fresh work on a quieter part of the line, and en route to \\"get his hair cut\\".'Kipling, pp. 116‚Äì7. =Death= On 24 October 1915, Trefusis was arranging for his brigade to be relieved in the line by another brigade of the division. While taking the other Brigadier round the trenches, 'Jack Tre' was shot through the forehead by a sniper. He died of his wound almost immediately.20th Brigade War Diary October 1915, The National Archives, Kew, file WO 95/1652.Atkinson, p. 235. He was buried the following day in the Guards' Cemetery at Windy Corner, Cuinchy, where his body still lies.CWGC record. He was unmarried. Notes References * C.T.

Brady considered himself part of the former Long faction of the Louisiana Democratic Party and claimed to focus his political interest on the needy, elderly, and underprivileged. Brady served during the administrations of Governors Edwin Edwards and David C. Treen. Background Brady was born in Urania, Louisiana, to Floyd Lee Brady, a native of Fort Towson in Choctaw County, Oklahoma, and the former Lucille McCarrol. He played football at La Salle High School in Olla, from which he graduated in 1956. From an early age, he had serious health problems involving fevers, weak muscle coordination, and neurological ailments. He procured a football scholarship to Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge but soon withdrew to attend Northwestern State University in Natchitoches. In 1962, he received a bachelor's degree in government from NSU. He worked at area radio stations as a disc jockey and announcer in Natchitoches, Farmerville in Union Parish, Winnfield, and Alexandria. Political career In 1965, Brady joined the staff in Washington, D.C., of U.S. Representative Speedy O. Long of Louisiana's 8th congressional district, since disbanded. He worked for Long until 1971; after a failed gubernatorial campaign, Long left Congress in 1973 and became the LaSalle Parish district attorney. At the age of thirty-seven, Brady was elected in 1975 to the Louisiana House in the first ever nonpartisan blanket primary system held in Louisiana. From 1984 to 1987, he was the vice chair of the House Administration of Criminal Justice. He was also a member of the House Education Committee. In 1983, Brady survived a heated challenge from Democratic former Representative W. L. Rambo of Georgetown and sitting House member Richard S. Thompson of Colfax, both in Grant Parish. Brady led the primary field with 6,424 votes (36 percent); Rambo trailed with 5,185 ballots (29.1 percent). Thompson garnered 4,960 votes (27.8 percent), and the remaining 1,276 votes went to Darrel Glen Thaxton of Jena, another Democrat. Brady prevailed by 207 votes in the runoff election, 7,301 (50.7 percent) to 7,094 (49.3 percent) for Rambo. Without his strong support in La Salle Parish, Brady would have been defeated. In 1986, Brady challenged the incumbent, fellow Democrat Jerry Huckaby of Bienville Parish, for Louisiana's 5th congressional district seat, which Huckaby had held for a decade. Huckaby prevailed with 96,200 votes (68.5 percent) to Brady's 32,284 ballots (23 percent), and 11,966 votes (8.5 percent) for the Monroe businessman Fred W. Huenefeld. Brady won only in La Salle Parish and only by 154 votes. In 1987, in his bid for a fourth term in reconfigured House District 22 (Grant, La Salle, and Rapides parishes), Brady led in the primary against six other Democrats but was forced into a runoff election against A. Dale Smith, who trailed by about 1,500 votes. Smith prevailed in the second balloting, 8,111 (54.1 percent) to 6,893 (45.9 percent). Brady won only narrowly in his own LaSalle Parish and lost Grant and Rapides parishes. Personal life While serving in the legislature, Brady began working in the real estate appraisal business. After his House service, he relocated to Alexandria, where he opened Bud Brady Appraisals. He also had a passion for writing gospel and country music and played the dobro, an instrument given to him by former Governor Jimmie Davis. For a time, he went to Nashville, Tennessee, to pursue a musical career; there, he met Reba McEntire, but none of his songs were placed on an album. In 1960, Brady married Cullyne Roy Scott (born c. 1940), whom he had met at NSU. A former schoolteacher, she resides in San Diego, California. Their son, Roderick Edward Brady (1963-1980), was killed in an accident while still a teenager. The Bradys had two daughters, Cecelia H. Brady (born 1967), the Miss Louisiana USA in the 1986 pageant and subsequently a resident of San Diego, and Charlane R. Brady (born 1972) of Reykjav√≠k, Iceland and San Francisco, California. He had two grandchildren. Brady was also survived by his brother, Gerald Brady of Lafayette, Louisiana, and a sister, Shirley B. Talley of Houston, Texas. Brady was a Southern Baptist while living in LaSalle Parish, but after he relocated to Alexandria, he became a Pentecostal. He died in Alexandria at the age of seventy-two. Services were held on April 8, 2011 at Forest Lawn Funeral Home in Ball, with interment at Forest Lawn Memorial Park north of Pineville. After Brady's death, the Louisiana State Senate approved a concurrent resolution, authored by Joe McPherson of Alexandria and Gerald Long of Natchitoches, to honor him for his public service. Oddly, another \\"Thomas Brady\\", from Terrebonne Parish in South Louisiana, preceded Bud Brady in the Louisiana House. Elward Thomas Brady, Jr., a businessman from Houma, served during the term from 1972 to 1976 but left the house to run unsuccessfully for the Louisiana State Senate at the same time that Budy Brady was first elected.

Historical and political background The earliest Chinese engagement in Africa may date back to as early as the tenth century, but modern diplomatic relations between China and Africa began in the mid 1900s.Chinese land-based interventions in Senegal. Development and Change, 44(2), 429-450. While much of China's growing interest in African countries is linked to natural resource extraction to feed its growing economy, this is not the case for involvement in Senegal, given the country's relatively limited supply of natural resources. China is also looking to accrue international influence by investing and creating infrastructure and markets in Africa, rather than simply giving aid, as Western powers have largely done in the past. For China, Senegal therefore presents an economically strategic location, and an opportunity to establish diplomatic relations in a country that has historically been a force of political stability in the West African region. For Senegal, establishing relations with China has legitimized its role in international affairs, and provided new trade and investment opportunities. The history of China‚ÄìSenegal relations has consisted of an alternating Senegalese recognition between the governments of mainland China (PRC) and Taiwan (formerly the ROC). This has largely been a result of Beijing's ‚ÄúOne China policy,‚Äù in which the PRC required foreign governments to break ties with Taiwan before proceeding in diplomatic relations with the PRC.One Policy for China. Harvard International Review. pp. 20-23. This trend of alternating recognition was common among many African countries and China during the second half of the twentieth century. Senegal gained independence in 1960 after formerly existing as a French colony, and in September of the same year, L√©opold S√©dar Senghor became Senegal's first president. Soon after, Senegal established relations with Taipei, the capital city of Taiwan. In 1961, Senegal recognized the People's Republic of China (PRC), but the PRC was unwilling to maintain this relationship while Senegal still retained ties with Taiwan. President Senghor stated in 1964 that he did not wish to maintain economic ties with Beijing, but oppositionist groups, including the Senegal African Independence Party, a communist party, were in support of retaining a relationship with Beijing at the time. In 1971, Senegal voted in favor of the PRC joining the United Nations, a motion which passed. Two years later, in 1973, the PRC and Senegal established trade and economic agreements. These relations lasted until 1996, when Senegal resumed relations with Taipei and the PRC in turn suspended relations with Senegal. The PRC maintained this suspension until 2005 when the relationship was restored. In August 2016, current Senegalese President Macky Sall attended the G20 summit in Hangzhou as the leader of a guest country, where he met with Xi Jinping and said he wanted to push for more independent development in Africa (FOCAC). China has an embassy located in the Senegal's capital, Dakar, and Zhang Xun is the Chinese ambassador to Senegal (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the PRC). Senegal also has an embassy located in Beijing, and Papa Khalilou Fall is the Senegalese ambassador to the PRC. In 2000, the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation was established to provide a platform through which Chinese officials could meet with officials of several African states.Reordering International Affairs: The Forum On China-Africa Cooperation. Austral: Brazilian Journal of Strategy & International Relations, 1(1), 51-74. Economic relations Since the re- establishment of diplomacy between China and Senegal, economic relations between the two countries have rapidly grown. This is part of a widespread Chinese effort to invest in the continent of Africa. China has pledged to no longer passively enter into trade agreements and give aid, but rather be an active investor in the future of Africa. In December 2015, Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged $60 billion towards African development projects over the next three years. The amount of aid that China has pledged has more than doubled since 2006.China's Xi Jinping pledges $60 billion to help Africa solve its problems its own way.

Chinese involvement in Senegal is strategic given the growth prospects of the country. Senegal is the second fastest growing economy in West Africa and the fourth fastest in Sub- Saharan Africa as a whole. This growth has been propelled by Senegalese government's involvement in specific sectors such as groundnuts, rice and horticultural goods. Additionally, the Port of Dakar is an intersection between Europe, North America, South America and the rest of Africa, and as a result, is the one of the largest and most efficient deep-water seaports along the West African coast.African Development Report. (2010). Port Development in Africa. African Bank. The government sentiment and prime location of Senegal make the country an optimal economic partner for a newly minted world power like China which is looking to expand its military, political and economic power across the world in conjunction with other world powers like the European Union and the United States. =Land resources= Aside from natural phosphates and a prominent fishing economy, Senegal is not home to many natural resources. However, their reliance on a developed agricultural industry, which employed 75% of the Senegalese working population as of 2013, is crucial. The current program in place involving joint Chinese and Senegalese agricultural research was initially a partnership established between Senegal and Taiwan but then went under Chinese control with the reestablishment of diplomatic relations in 2005. Agricultural and biological research is funded primarily by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce. China's increasing presence on the African continent due to agricultural ventures has been the source of worldwide attraction, especially due to corporate-driven land deals by Chinese businesses, known as ‚Äúland grabs.‚Äù Chinese involvement in Senegal, in particular, was due to an inability to bring in any collaboration efforts from the West according to Former President Abdoulaye Wade. Since the Senegalese government sought to prioritize the development of the country's agricultural industry, and therefore food security for its citizens, international involvement was welcomed by President Wade and his administration. In the beginning, there were many difficulties in the early stages of the project for those participating in the collaboration, due to communication issues, flaws in project designs and overall distrust on both Chinese and Senegalese sides, as crops were not yielding as quickly as predicted leading to frustration on both sides. It seemed that there had not been as much consideration for any socio-cultural education by either party A Chinese farm in Africa.

Chinese agriculturalists have also returned to China to implement techniques learned in Senegal to the country's farms and agricultural land. Since land in Senegal, and the continent of Africa overall, is considered mineral-rich and unexploited, in the view of China, Chinese agricultural techniques should be implemented to not only feed China but increase the global supply of food as a whole. Even with this international cooperation, the Senegalese government still prioritized natives over Chinese foreigners when selling and providing land. =Trade= China is now Senegal's second largest trading partner, second only to the European Union as of 2015.European Union, Trade in goods with Senegal. European Union. Trade flows between the two countries are unbalanced. Senegal's imports averaged $349 million annually from China, while China imported $26B as Senegalese exports to China tripled between 2000 and 2005. China's top imports from Senegal include raw materials such as ground nuts and their byproducts, and titanium ore.

Retrieved April 29, 2017, from http://atlas.media.mit.edu/: http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/visualize/tree_map/hs92/export/chn/sen/show/2015/ The composition of trading goods is a leading indicator of the state of economic relations between the two countries: China as a world economic powerhouse using its resources to invest in Senegal as an up and comer in a rising Africa. The Chinese presence is prominent in trade as Senegal Peche, the largest commercial fishing and shipping enterprise, is now a subsidiary of the China National Fisheries Association, a state-owned multi-national fishing corporation to large infrastructure projects that include building a new international airport in a newly developed urban center to Diamniadio. =Senegalese sentiment= The economic exchange between the two countries has been largely welcomed by Senegalese citizens and government. In recently conducted surveys, 65 percent Senegalese citizens responded to the question, ‚ÄúIs China‚Äôs economic and political influence positive or negative?‚Äù with ‚Äúsomewhat positive‚Äù or ‚Äúvery positive‚Äù. Additionally, when asked about the usefulness of Chinese economic activities in their countries, 54 percent of Senegalese citizens responded Chinese developmental assistance as being ‚Äúsomewhat/very good job‚Äù China's Growing Presence in Africa Wins Largely Positive Popular Views. The government favors Chinese presence due to the availability to credit. While there is little official information available about the amount and nature of Chinese investment in Senegal. Through interviews from Senegalese government officials, the Chinese government offers short and long-term loans with the highest interest rates being at two percent, relatively low compared to other funding sources. The option of these loans have improved infrastructure among other projects in Senegal.Reopening Ties China Ties a Masterstroke for Senegal. In CajNewsAfrica. Retrieved from http://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/portrait-chinese-traders-dakar-senegal =Long-term investments= The majority of China's private business is concentrated in Senegal's capital of Dakar, which has grown so rapidly that Senegal is building a new city funded by China and its CGC Overseas Construction Group. The new infrastructure project is a response to increasing prices which have pushed out the middle class. The new city has a new highway connecting the new city of Diamniadio and the capital of Dakar and plans for a new international airport. Diamniadio currently has a population of 30,000, but it is expected to expand tenfold by 2019 as a result of this project.Senegal Plans New City to Ease Gridlock, Woo China Investors. In Bloomberg.

As Chinese construction companies have sprung up in the country, training schools have risen alongside building the skills capacity in the country. Like many Chinese economic phenomena, this is not unique to Senegal. At the 2017 African Development Week, executive secretary of the African Capacity Building Foundation, Emmanuel Nnadoize, noted the importance of Chinese-led skills training on the continent. Chinese military involvement in Senegal In 2006, former President Abdoulaye Wade went to Beijing and, later in the year, attended the FOCAC (The Forum on China-Africa Cooperation) summit where senior Chinese military officials began to discuss a track for military cooperation with Senegal. These discussions occurred just one year after Senegal re- established diplomatic relations with China. Since then, Senegal has partnered with Chinese forces in multiple areas, including training exercises and material and equipment acquisition. In 2007, China also provided ambulances and trucks, as well as communication and mining equipment. At the time, the Chinese ambassador to Senegal added that the cooperation between the two nations gave way for assisting Senegal in their peacekeeping missions, most notably in Darfur, Sudan, the Ivory Coast and the Democratic Republic of Congo. These partnerships have helped the Senegalese armed forces to gain higher levels of experience, professionalism, responsibility and respect towards and for the country's population, regardless of its extent compared to military collaborations between the United States or France. The most recent showcasing of equipment was a large delivery of armored vehicles to Senegal. Going with China's involvement in Africa to develop an international presence, providing aid to the Senegalese military mutually benefits both parties: Senegal can better and increase their military power while China has yet another foothold in the region. China is also able to portray itself both as a military power and humanitarian within the parameters of African politics. Social and race relations Though diplomatic and economic relations between China and Senegal were first established in 1971, Chinese migrants did not begin arriving in Senegal until the 1980s. Many of these migrants came as workers under Henan Construction Company, which was one of the main multinational companies involved in the Chinese-funded infrastructure development projects in Senegal. Once their contracts ended in the late 1990s, workers who stayed behind began to take advantage of other business opportunities available to them, namely in trade. While residing in Senegal, many Henan workers noticed that Senegalese traders in Dakar's markets were selling cheaper Chinese-made products. With their connections back home, they realized that they could do the same by importing at an even lower cost and subsequently, gain higher profits than those being earned by Senegalese traders.Far From Altruistic: China‚Äôs Presence in Senegal. In KAS International Reports. Retrieved from http://www.kas.de/wf/doc/kas_29405-544-2-30.pdf?111114144406 Therefore, these first Chinese traders rented out store space in the Centenaire area of Dakar, where the devaluation of the CFA francs (the primary currency used in Senegal) in the 90s forced many Centenaire residents to rent out their properties for an extra stream of income. To this day, Chinese retail businesses remain primarily situated around the Centenaire's Papa Gueye Fall Avenue and Boulevard General De Gaulle. The continuing migration of Chinese citizens into the area has led to the development of a Chinatown within Dakar, which, as of 2009, had around 200 Chinese shops, restaurants, and other Chinese-owned businesses. =Demographics of Chinese nationals in Senegal= In 2004, there was an estimated 300 Chinese in Senegal. Following the 2005 renewal of diplomatic relations, Chinese migration into Senegal increased, facilitated by expedited visas courtesy of unofficial networks between Senegalese brokers, the Senegalese Ministry of the Interior, and the Senegalese embassy in Beijing. Furthermore, passports in China, though previously extremely limited and dependent upon administrative rank, are now more readily available since China started simplifying passport regulations starting in the 1980s. This process included a 1985 law that allowed ordinary citizens to apply for passports, provided they could show evidence of sponsorship from abroad. Following international standards as set by the World Trade Organization, in 2005 China allowed any citizen to apply for a passport by providing identification and residence documents.Emigration from China: A Sending Country Perspective. International Migration, 41(3), 21-48. The first Chinese migrants to Senegal began arriving in the mid 1990s.,‚ÄòSmall and medium-sized Chinese business in Mali and Senegal.‚Äô African And Asian Studies, 9252-268 when the government made changes in the necessary procedures for getting a Chinese passport to travel to Africa. This expanded to the groups for whom it was possible to obtain such a passport, making it available for people other than just scholars and people with family already settled there. By 2008, the estimate of Chinese nationals in Senegal increased to around 1,000 in Dakar alone, with more continuing to enter the country in pursuit of business opportunities. The majority of these migrants are traders and entrepreneurs who are looking to tap into Senegalese demand for cheaper Chinese goods. Due to the fact that many Chinese migrants come for only short periods of time and then either return to China or pursue ventures in other African countries, the constant inflow and outflow makes it very difficult to keep track of the long- term population level of Chinese in Senegal Demystifying Chinese business strength in urban Senegal and Ghana: structural of change and the performativity of rumours. Payne, R., & Veney, C. (1998). China's Post-Cold War African Policy. Asian Survey, 38(9), 867-879. Estimates of the current population vary widely, from the Chinese embassy's count of approximately 2000 to UNACOIS's (National Union of Senegalese Retailers and Industrialists) estimate of more than 5000 From Isolation to Integration? A Study of Chinese Retailers in Dakar. Report no. 57. China in Africa Project, SAIIA. 2010. Currently, the largest portion of Chinese traders in Senegal originate from Henan province, comprising approximately 60% of the Chinese traders‚Äô community. Other provinces that Chinese nationals residing in Senegal originate from include Sichuan, Fujian, and Zhejiang. Most of these migrants are from rural areas with low socioeconomic status, limited educational backgrounds, and little work experience. Of this population, single men in their late 20s to early 30s are the predominant demographic, followed by slightly older married men who often bring their wives and families with them. Some traders who came in the early 2000s have expanded into other fields such as catering and agriculture, but most remain as shopkeepers who work under the 1st wave of Chinese shop owners from the late 1990s that helped bring them into the country in the first place. =Race relations= Race relations between Chinese residents and Senegalese locals vary, largely on the basis of the environment in which they interact. To the Senegalese residents who rent out garages and living spaces to Chinese migrants at inflated prices, the Chinese presence is a reassurance of economic security in the face of personal debts generated by the depreciation of the CFA francs in the 1990s. In addition to the stream of income they provide in the form of rent, the generally reserved and discreet attitudes of Chinese residents make them appealing tenants to Senegalese proprietors.Configuring Chinese presence in Senegal . Report no. 4. Footbridges. Vol. 11. 2010. For Senegalese consumers, the arrival of Chinese merchants and resulting influx of cheap consumer goods has driven down prices and increased their purchasing power. Though these goods are typically of lower-quality, their affordability continues to attract Senegalese consumers and generally keep them happy or indifferent to the presence of Chinese traders. On the other hand, Senegalese merchants in direct competition with Chinese traders have understandably become increasingly suspicious and hostile towards Chinese residents. Competition remains fierce and Chinese merchants have driven many of their Senegalese counterparts out of business with their ‚Äúdumping strategy‚Äù of cheaper prices and higher volumes of consumer goods. Aware of the often unregulated means through which Chinese merchants bring their products into Senegal, protests against Chinese traders rose and culminated in a major strike in 2004 against Chinese products led by UNACOIS. Many Senegalese-run shops were closed and some Chinese shops were attacked in protest against Chinese retailers and their products. Since the strike, tensions have remained high as the Senegalese government has taken little to no action to tighten entry requirements against Chinese migrants and verify the validity of Chinese business contracts within Senegal. During the 2012 Senegalese presidential elections, these political frustrations reflected in the burning of three Chinese stores. Amongst Senegalese business owners and traders, current perception of Chinese traders in Senegal is generally based on strong anti-Chinese sentiments. Due to the high visibility of Chinese business owners, especially in urban districts where customers are the most readily available, this sentiment has been able to develop. Furthermore, the Chinese community, much like in other African countries where the Chinese presence has increased, has reflected an insular nature that has delayed the integration of the community into Senegalese society. =Media portrayal= Through media sources such as China Radio International, Chinese journalists have already made a presence in Senegal. With the continued development of the Sino-African relationship, Chinese leadership have attempted to create a more positive image of China in Africa. Western media has largely portrayed China's involvements in Africa as exploitative in nature; Chinese media is trying to shift views towards one of an economic ally. As a result, within Chinese-run media, Senegalese locals are often seen or portrayed by the media as ignorant, furthering the role of China as one of a socio-economic developer. The emphasis is placed on how the Chinese presence in Senegal has brought technology, know-how, and other management strategies. Senegalese media's portrayal of Chinese is reflective of overall portrayal of Chinese migrants in African media. Despite the growing development of Chinese and African economic relations, there is still very little written about the daily interactions between Chinese and African people in Africa. Present-day media depictions of Chinese residents in Africa has often been increasingly negative due to the economic competition they bring against local businessmen. In general, opposition political parties and civil society organizations representing the interest of local traders have pushed anti-Chinese rhetoric in media and Chinese in Africa are becoming targets of increasingly anti-Chinese sentiments amongst local merchants. Specifically, many Senegalese media sources often exaggerate the number of Chinese residents in Senegal to stir up fear of Chinese competition and thus anti-Chinese sentiment. Lack of cultural knowledge and personal interactions with the closed-off Chinese community has perpetuated the Senegalese media's vague portrayal.Reporting China in Africa: media discourses on shifting geopolitics. London: Routledge, 2015. Recently, however, the Chinese and Senegalese governments have made joint efforts to try and increase dialogue between the two cultures through endeavors such as the 2014 creation of the China Cultural Center in Dakar.China to open cultural center in Senegal.

Arthur played an early version of the song Man of Constant Sorrow in 1928.Emry in 1929 Childhood and youth Emry Arthur was born around the turn of the century in the Elk Spring Valley in Wayne County, Kentucky. His father collected old traditional songs from Kentucky and the entire family was known for their music in the area. Young Arthur and learned to play instruments like his brothers Henry and Sam, but after a hunting accident he was restricted to playing harmonica and strumming simply on the guitar. As a singer he built up a repertoire from different eras: the archaic local tradition; nineteenth century popular song and more contemporary gospel. One influence was probably the Wayne County singer and musician Dick Burnett, who claimed to have taught young Emry I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow. Arthur was unable to earn a living from music, and work in general was hard to find, so in the mid 1920s he migrated to Indianapolis.Russell, Tony (2007), Country Music Originals, The Legends and the Lost, Oxford University Press pp 96-98. Recording career After a few years in Indianapolis, Arthur auditioned successfully for Vocalion Records. For his first sessions he summoned his brother Henry from Kentucky. With unidentified guitarists and with Henry on banjo, the brothers recorded vocal duets and solos by Emry, on some playing harmonica. One of Emry's solos was the first recording of \\"I Am A Man Of Constant Sorrow\\". Vocalion was impressed by good sales, particularly of the religious sides, and by the fact that Emry was Southern singer living conveniently in the North, so he was invited back to record frequently through 1928 and 1929. As with his first sessions, he recorded a mixture of solo songs and vocal duets, employing first Frank Owens then William Rexroat in place of Henry Arthur. In addition, he recorded with a succession of choirs led by Arthur and one led by Rexroat, as well as with a group singing in a non- Southern idiom led by Floyd Thomson.Russell (2007)Russell, Tony (2004), Country Music record, a Discography, 1921-1945, Oxford University Press . In 1929, Emry's marriage broke up. Abandoning everything, he moved to Wisconsin, where he secured contacts with Paramount Records as a singer, and with their parent Wisconsin Chair Company as a factory hand. As before, he recorded a mixture of solos (including a second version of I Am A Man Of Constant Sorrow) and vocal duets. But now his singing partner was Della Hatfield, who became his second wife. They continued to record for Paramount until the near collapse of the recording industry in 1931.Russell (2007) Also in 1929, Arthur was involved with William Myers, a songwriter in Richlands, Virginia. Previously, Myers had posted his songs to singers he admired, including Mississippi John Hurt and Dock Boggs. Now he decided to start a record label, named Lonesome Ace. This folded after three recordings: one by Arthur and two by Boggs with Arthur accompanying.Russell (2007) In 1935, the recording industry had recovered somewhat, and Emry recorded a final session with Decca Records. At some point, Emry and Della moved back to Indianapolis, where they lived for the rest of their lives, about which nothing is known. Emry Arthur died in 1967, survived by Della for almost four decades.Russell (2007) Old Homestead Records collected some of Arthur's recordings on I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow in 1987.

The only comprehensive source of information on Eckstein's life and political views comes from an eight-page interview between Kay Tobin, Barbara Gittings, and Eckstein in this issue of the magazine. Ernestine Eckstein (April 23, 1941 ‚Äì July 15, 1992) was an African-American woman who helped steer the United States Lesbian and Gay rights movement during the 1960s. She was a leader in the New York chapter of Daughters of Bilitis (DOB). Her influence helped the DOB move away from negotiating with medical professionals and towards tactics of public demonstrations. Her understanding of, and work in, the Civil Rights Movement lent valuable experience on public protest to the lesbian and gay movement. Eckstein worked among activists such as Phyllis Lyon and Del Martin, Barbara Gittings, Franklin Kameny, and Randy Wicker. In the 1970s she became involved in the black feminist movement, in particular the organization Black Women Organized for Action (BWOA).  Early life  Eckstein was born in Indiana in 1941., Indiana University: Singing Hoosiers, 2006 Her given name was Ernestine Delois Eppenger, though all her lesbian and gay activist work was done under the name Eckstein to protect herself from being outed in circles where it was not safe to be open.During the 1960s it was common for Gay and Lesbian activists to work under pseudonyms to protect knowledge about their sexual orientation from reaching those who would use it against them (to fire them from their jobs or disown them from their families). On pg 9 of her June 1966 interview in The Ladder, Eckstein herself said, ‚Äú I will get in a picket line, but in a different city,‚Äù implying that she understands the danger of being publicly associated with homosexual identity, and therefore would not label herself homosexual in public in her own city. She graduated from Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana in 1963.http://static.getsnworks.com/ids/arbutus/1963/ Her undergraduate degree was in Magazine Journalism with a minor in Government and Russian.Interview in The Ladder: A Lesbian Review, June 1966, pg. 4 She moved to New York City soon after graduation in 1963 at the age of twenty-two. Upon moving she came into a lesbian identity and her activism as a lesbian began.Marcia Gallo, Different Daughters, pg. 122 and Interview in The Ladder: A Lesbian Review, June 1966, pg. 4 Eckstein says of her sexual orientation: :::‚ÄúThis was a kind of blank that had never been filled by anything- until after I came to New York‚Ä¶I didn‚Äôt know the term gay! And he [a gay male friend from Indiana who was living in New York] explained it to me. Then all of a sudden things began to click ‚Ä¶ the next thing on the agenda was to find a way of being in the homosexual movement.\\"  Political organizing in the LGBT community  Eckstein in a demonstration at the White House in October 1965. Her sign reads, \\"Denial of Equality of Opportunity is Immoral,\\" a slogan that summarizes her Black Feminist and Lesbian and Gay political philosophy. Eckstein began attending meetings of the New York Mattachine Society soon after she arrived in New York City, which led her to its sister organization DOB.Interview in The Ladder: A Lesbian Review, June 1966, pg. 5 In 1965, debates around the direction of the homophile movement were heating up. That same year Eckstein marched in Philadelphia at the first Annual Reminder Day and in front of the White House as the only person of color demonstrating. The original Mattachine Society's ‚Äúold guard‚Äù leaders (versus the independent Mattachine Society of Washington who initiated the 1965 protests) wanted to continue pursuing homosexual rights via negotiations with doctors and psychologists while the younger activist wing desired to take the issue of equal civil rights for homosexuals to the people through lobbying government officials and demonstrating. Psychologists considered homosexuality to be a mental illness until 1973, when it was removed from the Diagnostic and Statistics Manual in the third edition; until that point, homosexuality was perceived as a mental illness and therefore something to ‚Äòfix‚Äô. Group for the Advancement of Psychiatry (GAP) This debate was equally strong within the DOB; Eckstein's appointment as DOB New York chapter Vice President indicated a strategic push by the activist wing. Marcia M. Gallo writes, ‚ÄúHer [Eckstein‚Äôs] plan was to reach out to women who saw the gay struggle as linked to other civil rights issues and hope that during her time as vice president of the local chapter she would help build a more social action oriented group\\".Marcia Gallo, Different Daughters, pg. 122 During the time that Eckstein was involved in DOB, until 1968, the ‚Äúold guard‚Äù was still controlling the organization.Marcia Gallo, Different Daughters, pg. 149 In June 1965, DOB actually pulled out of the East Coast Homophile Organization (ECHO) because the coalition was increasing its involvement in protests for lesbian and gay rights.John D‚ÄôEmilio, Sexual Politics, Sexual Communities, pg. 172. On page 161 D‚ÄôEmilio notes that, ‚ÄúECHO played a critical role in solidifying a militant wing of the movement overall toward direct action strategies.‚Äù ECHO marks a shift of the lesbian and gay Eckstein was an important lesbian representative of the activist wing. She understood that she was living through a huge tactical shift for lesbian and gay activists and that it was an uphill battle. She said, ‚ÄúI think our movement is not ready for any forms of civil disobedience. I think this would solidify resistance to our cause. This situation will change eventually. But not now\\".Interview in The Ladder: A Lesbian Review June 1966, pg. 9 Eckstein believed that there should be a concentration on, ‚Äúthe discrimination by the government in employment and military service, the laws used against homosexuals,‚Äù and, ‚Äúthe rejection by the churches\\".Marcia Gallo, Different Daughters, pg. 124 Eckstein, like the founder of the Black Panther Party, Huey Newton, saw the connection between black American's struggle for equality during the Civil Rights Movement and the lesbian and gay struggle for equality and fostered the connection. In his historic speech on ‚ÄúThe Women‚Äôs Liberation and Gay Liberation Movement‚Äù in August of 1970 Newton said, ‚ÄúWhatever your personal opinions and your insecurities about ‚Ä¶the various liberation movements among homosexuals and women (and I speak of the homosexuals and women as oppressed groups), we should try to unite with them in a revolutionary fashion.‚Äù This is very similar to Eckstein‚Äôs statement that, ‚ÄúNegroes need white people, and ‚Ä¶homosexuals need heterosexuals.‚Äù To this day, many groups still do not acknowledge the connection between gay rights and rights for people of color. It was not until 2012 that Ben Jealous, President and CEO of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) declared, \\"Civil marriage is a civil right and a matter of civil law,\\" confirming that LGBT rights are now acknowledged as civil rights struggles by the NAACP.Eugene Robinson, , \\"Truthout\\", May 22, 2012  Eckstein‚Äôs correspondence with Frank Kameny  Frank Kameny was one of the most significant figures in the American gay rights movement, co-founding the Mattachine Society of Washington (MSW), and, inspired by Stokely Carmichael's creation of the phrase Black is beautiful, created the slogan ‚ÄúGay is Good‚Äù for the gay civil rights movement. In late 1965 and early 1966, Ernestine Ecsktein and Frank Kameny corresponded by letters about Eckstein's wish to bring Kameny to speak on April 17, 1966 at DOB headquarters in New York City. Eckstein wanted Kameny's help to reinforce to DOB officers and members the need for activism and activist strategies and tactics in moving forward the lesbian and gay movement. Ecsktein, writing to Kameny on February 12, 1966 said, ‚ÄúI want you to be free enough to say whatever you want, so to speak ‚Äì about any aspect of the movement. Keep in mind my particular aim: to get these people to realize there is such a thing as the homophile movement and possibly begin to develop a fuller concept of themselves as part of it.‚Äù However, in a letter dated February 17, 1966, Eckstein informs Kameny that the DOB organization had decided to disinvite Kameny to speak at DOB.Kameny Papers After three years in New York with the DOB Eckstein moved to Northern California to ‚Äúfocus on social justice issues‚Ä¶[she] joined Black Women Organized for Action‚Ä¶in the early 1970s\\".Marcia Gallo, Different Daughters, pgs. 149, 258 Much less is known about Eckstein after she left New York. Interviews with previous DOB members revealed, ‚ÄúEckstein had gotten tired of all the political wrangling and disagreements within DOB over strategies and tactics‚Äù and wanted ‚Äúmore political organization.‚Äù She left the movement on the East Coast for other political work advocating for women of color in California.Interview in The Ladder: A Lesbian Review, June 1966, pg. 6  Political organizing in the Black feminist community  Eckstein's involvement with political activism started in the Civil Rights Movement at Indiana State, as a NAACP chapter officer.Interview in The Ladder: A Lesbian Review, June 1966, pg. 6, 7 But Eckstein understood organizations like NAACP as, ‚Äústructured with the white liberals in mind‚Äù and joined more progressive organizations like Congress on Racial Equality (CORE) once she moved to New York. BWOA was founded on January 10, 1973, when they assembled in San Francisco to challenge the Mayor‚Äôs Committee on the Status of Women. \\"The Interstitial Politics of Black Feminist Organizations\\" by Kimberly Springer, pg. 172. Upon moving to the west coast, Eckstein joined the radical, activist group Black Women Organized for Action (BWOA). BWOA was a San Francisco organization collectively co-founded in 1973 by fifteen women including Aileen Hernandez, Patsy Fulcher, and Eleanor Spikes.‚ÄúThe Interstitial Politics of Black Feminist Organizations‚Äù by Kimberly Springer, pg. 171 The organization, ‚Äúformed in the San Francisco Bay Area in response to the lack of representation of Black women in local women's organizing\\". The group emerged from Black Women Organized for Political Action (BWOPA). BWOPA, which functioned in an auxiliary fundraising role for men of color running for office, and had many members who wanted to shift to a space explicitly defined by Black women's concerns. ‚ÄúThough members had strong roots in the Civil Rights Movement ‚Ä¶ more so than any of the other organizations, BWOA exhibits a clear link to the Women's Movement\\".Living for the Revolution. Kimberly Springer, pg. 75 BWOA was among the first Black feminist organizations in the United States. This picture is striking because Ernestine Eckstein appears to be the only woman in this long picket line. Eckstein in a demonstration at the White House in October, 1965. The fact that Eckstein chose to join BWOA reflects her radical political beliefs. The organization had a truly progressive model of collective responsibility and political philosophy. ‚ÄúThe organization was structured so that leadership, work, and community involvement were shared among members willing to participate, and ‚Äúa system of, three coordinators for a three-month tenure‚Äù was utilized.Living for the Revolution. Kimberly Springer, pg. 63 This created an emphasis on fostering Black women as leaders while simultaneously avoiding a hierarchy among Black female activists. This was a rare structure in comparison to sister organizations.‚ÄúThe Interstitial Politics of Black Feminist Organizations‚Äù by Kimberly Springer, pg. 183 The three-month terms were a part of the organization's larger political perspective that did not mandate that its members hold specific stances on political issues. Historian Kimberly Springer writes, ‚ÄúMembers were free to choose the activities in which they participated and they were not obligated to subscribe to an organizationally- dictated political perspective. ‚Ä¶The survival of Black communities ‚Ä¶ did not depend on one solution but on the conscious, consistent political awareness of the communities' members\\".Membership Brochure from BWOA, Living for the Revolution, Kimberly Springer, pg. 187 The BWOA Statement of Purpose reads: ::BLACK We are Black and therefore imbedded in our consciousness is commitment to the struggle of Black people for identity and involvement in decisions that affect our lives and the lives of other generations of Black people who will follow. ::WOMEN We are Women, and therefore aware of the sometimes blatant, waste of the talents and energies of Black women because this society has decreed a place for us. ::ORGANIZED we are Organized, because we recognize that only together, only by pooling our talents and resources, can we make major change in the institutions which have limited our opportunities and stifled our growth as human beings. ::ACTION We are for Action, because we believe that the time for rhetoric is past; that the skills of Black women can best be put to use in a variety of ways to change the society; that, in the political work in which we live, involvement for Black women must go beyond the traditional fundraising and into the full gamut of activities that make up the political process which affects our lives in so many ways.Living for the Revolution, Kimberly Springer, pgs. 79, 80 The organization's careful use of terms such as ‚Äúfeminist‚Äù and ‚ÄúBlack‚Äù that could potentially alienate or divide their membership encouraged the non-hierarchical atmosphere. Springer writes: ‚ÄúThe BWOA subverted discrimination within Black communities based on color, physical appearance, or class by welcoming all Black women into the organization. The organization focused on activism, rather than social constructions of beauty or social class. ... BWOA‚Äôs avoidance of the label ‚Äòfeminism‚Äô while practicing feminism was indicative of future developments in Black feminist organizing\\".‚ÄúThe Interstitial Politics of Black Feminist Organizations‚Äù by Kimberly Springer, pg. 187 The BWOA lasted from 1973 to 1980 with a 400-person membership at its height.Living for the Revolution, Kimberly Springer, pg. 130 There was no one factor that caused the group to stop meeting actively, but the rise in conservatism with the election of Ronald Reagan as President in 1980 caused members to ‚Äúdetermine that 1960s strategies would not be effective\\". One unusual factor in Eckstein's involvement in BWOA is that it ‚Äúdid not interrogate heterosexism as an oppressive force in Black women‚Äôs lives\\".Interview in The Ladder: A Lesbian Review, June 1966, pg. 11  Political views  Eckstein was one of the most progressive thinkers of her time in the gay and lesbian political movement as well as in the Black Feminist movement. Her understanding of the successes of the Civil Rights Movement influenced her beliefs about political organizing. She saw demonstrations as, ‚Äúone of the very first steps towards changing society\\".Interview in The Ladder: A Lesbian Review, June 1966, pg. 8 In 1966, three years before the Stonewall Rebellion in 1969 that sparked annual Gay Pride marches beginning in 1970, while many white gay and lesbian activists were still struggling with direct action as a feasible tactic Eckstein said, ‚ÄúPicketing I regard as almost a conservative act now. The homosexual has to call attention to the fact that he‚Äôs been unjustly acted upon. This is what the Negro did\\".Interview in The Ladder: A Lesbian Review, June 1966, pg. 10 At a time when much of the activism regarding lesbian and gay rights was done for, by, and about white people, Eckstein was leading an extremely active, majority white, DOB chapter and advocating for coalition-based politics. She understood that her views were coming from what might be described as a more inclusive analysis than many White gay or lesbian activists who often only did work around gay or lesbian issues. She said, ‚ÄúI think if we meet on the common ground of our unjust position in society, then we can go from there. This is a new frame of reference, a new way of thinking almost, for some\\".Interview in The Ladder: A Lesbian Review, June 1966, pg. 7 Eckstein's beliefs toward political coalition work and organizing differed than that of many other separatist leaning gay and lesbian people in the 1960s. Eckstein said: *‚ÄúI think Negroes need white people, and I think homosexuals need heterosexuals. If you foster cooperation right from the start, then everyone is involved and it‚Äôs not a movement over there\\". *‚ÄúI would like to see in the homophile movement more people who can think. And I don‚Äôt believe we ought to look at their titles or at their sexual orientation. Movements should be intended, I feel, to erase labels, whether ‚Äòblack‚Äô or ‚Äòwhite‚Äô or ‚Äòhomosexual‚Äô or ‚Äòheterosexual\\". *‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to find a way of getting all classes of homosexuals involved together in the movement‚Äù.  June 1966 interview in The Ladder  Much of what is known about Eckstein's beliefs and life is taken from an interview in The Ladder in June 1966. Eckstein was one of two women of color to be featured on the cover of this landmark lesbian political publication. The importance of Eckstein's issue of The Ladder should not be underestimated: ‚ÄúHer image on the cover, and her ideas throughout the pages of The Ladder, helped greatly to complicate notions of the kinds of women who were involved in DOB and expanded definitions of lesbian identity\\".[womhist.alexanderstreet.com/mgallo/intro.htm ] Her coverage in The Ladder is the only known published piece that substantially features Eckstein.  Later life  At this time virtually nothing is known of Eckstein's life after she became a part of BWOA. According to the Social Security Death Index, Ernestine Eckstein (Ernestine D. Eppenger) died in San Pablo, California in 1992.Social Security Death Index Other Season 4 episode 9 of the podcast ‚ÄúMaking Gay History‚Äù is about Eckstein.

These are specified, under section 59 of the Financial Services and Markets Act which still stands as the reference after the FSA split into the FCA and the PRA. The FCA is solely responsible for all applications for approval for FCA Designated Controlled Functions for all FCA solo regulated firms.  Controlled functions applicable for UK and overseas firms  = Significant influence functions =  CF 1 Director function  If a firm is a body corporate (other than a limited liability partnership), the Director Function is the function of acting in the capacity of a director (other than non- executive director) of that firm.http://fshandbook.info/FS/html/handbook/SUP/10A/6#DES122 (1) If a firm is a body corporate (other than a limited liability partnership), the director function is also the function of acting in the capacity of a person: (a) who is a director, partner, officer, member (if the parent undertaking or holding company is a limited liability partnership), senior manager, or employee of a parent undertaking or holding company of the firm; and (b) whose decisions or actions are regularly taken into account by the governing body of the firm. (2) (1) does not apply if that parent undertaking or holding company has a Part 4A permission or is regulated by an EEA regulator. (3) (1) does not apply to the function falling into SUP 10A.6.13 R (non-executive director of the parent undertaking or holding company).  CF 2 Non-executive director function  If a firm is a body corporate, the non-executive director function is the function of acting in the capacity of a non-executive director of that firm. (1) If a firm is a body corporate, the non-executive director function is also the function of acting in the capacity of a person: (a) who is a non-executive director of a parent undertaking or holding company; and (b) whose decisions or actions are regularly taken into account by the governing body of the firm. (2) However, (1) does not apply if that parent undertaking or holding company has a Part 4A permission or is regulated by an EEA regulator.  CF 3 Chief executive function  The chief executive function is the function of acting in the capacity of a chief executive of a firm. This function is having the responsibility, alone or jointly with one or more others, under the immediate authority of the governing body: (1) for the conduct of the whole of the business (or relevant activities); or (2) in the case of a branch in the United Kingdom of an overseas firm, for the conduct of all of the activities subject to the UK regulatory system. For a branch in the United Kingdom of an overseas firm, the FCA would not normally expect the overseas chief executive of the firm as a whole to be FCA-approved for this function where there is a senior manager under him with specific responsibility for those activities of the branch which are subject to the UK regulatory system. In some circumstances, the person within the firm responsible for UK operations may, if the function is likely to enable him to exercise significant influence over the branch, also perform the chief executive function (see SUP 10A.7.4 G). A person performing the chief executive function may be a member of the governing body but need not be. If the chairman of the governing body is also the chief executive, he will be discharging this function. If the responsibility is divided between more than one person but not shared, there is no person exercising the chief executive function. But if that responsibility is discharged jointly by more than one person, each of those persons will be performing the chief executive function. Note that a body corporate may be a chief executive. If so, it will need to be approved (if the firm in question is an FCA-authorised person) to perform the chief executive function. The chief executive function does not apply in relation to a PRA-authorised person. PRA approval is required instead.  CF 4 Partner function  (1) If a firm is a partnership, the partner function is the function of acting in the capacity of a partner in that firm. (2) If the principal purpose of the firm is to carry on one or more regulated activities, each partner performs the partner function. (3) If the principal purpose of the firm is other than to carry on regulated activities: (a) a partner performs the partner function to the extent only that he has responsibility for a regulated activity; and (b) a partner in a firm will be taken to have responsibility for each regulated activity except where the partnership has apportioned responsibility to another partner or group of partners. Any apportionment referred to in SUP 10A.6.23R (3)(b) will have taken place under SYSC 2.1.1 R https://fshandbook.info/FS/html/handbook/SYSC/2/1 or SYSC 4.3.1 R http://fshandbook.info/FS/html/handbook/SYSC/4/3 and SYSC 4.4.3 R. The FCA may ask to see details of the apportionment but will not require, as a matter of course, a copy of the material which records this (see SYSC 2.2 https://fshandbook.info/FS/html/handbook/SYSC/2/2). The effect of SUP 10A.1.17 R is that regulated activity in SUP 10A.6.23 R (and elsewhere) is to be taken as not including an activity that is a non-mainstream regulated activity. Therefore, a partner whose only regulated activities are incidental to his professional services, in a partnership whose principal purpose is to carry on other than regulated activities, need not be an FCA-approved person. What amounts to the principal purpose of the firm is a matter of fact in each case having regard to all the circumstances, including the activities of the firm as a whole. Any regulated activities which such a partner carries on are not within the description of the partner function. If a firm is a limited liability partnership, the partner function extends to the firm as if the firm were a partnership and a member of the firm were a partner. If a partnership is registered under the Limited Partnership Act 1907, the partner function does not extend to any function performed by a limited partner. The partner function does not apply in relation to a PRA-authorised person. PRA approval is required instead.  CF 5 Directors of an unincorporated association  If a firm is an unincorporated association, the director of unincorporated association function is the function of acting in the capacity of a director of the unincorporated association. The director of unincorporated association function does not apply in relation to a PRA-authorised person. PRA approval is required instead.  CF 6 Small friendly society function  (1) If a firm is a non-directive friendly society, the small friendly society function is the function of directing its affairs, either alone or jointly with others. (2) If the principal purpose of the firm is to carry on regulated activities, each person with responsibility for directing its affairs performs the FCA controlled function. (3) If the principal purpose of the firm is other than to carry on regulated activities, a person performs the small friendly society function only to the extent that he has responsibility for a regulated activity. (1) Each person on the non-directive friendly society's governing body will be taken to have responsibility for its regulated activities, unless the firm has apportioned this responsibility to one particular individual to whom it is reasonable to give this responsibility. (2) The individual need not be a member of the governing body. Typically a non-directive friendly Society will appoint a \\"committee of management\\" to direct its affairs. However, the governing arrangements may be informal and flexible. If this is the case, the FCA would expect the society to resolve to give responsibility for the carrying on of regulated activities to one individual who is appropriate in all the circumstances. That individual may, for example, have the title of chief executive or similar. The individual would have to be an FCA-approved person under SUP 10A.6.31 R.http://fshandbook.info/FS/html/handbook/SUP/10A/6#DES138 In practice, the FCA expects that most non-directive friendly societies will be PRA-authorised persons. Where that is the case, the small friendly society function will not apply. PRA approval is required instead.  CF10 Compliance oversight function  The CF10 control function is the simplifying code name given by the Financial Conduct Authority to the compliance oversight function within the Financial services industry in the United Kingdom. The compliance oversight function is the function of acting in the capacity of a director or senior manager who is allocated by the Financial Services Authority the function of reporting to the governing body to ensure compliance with the rules set out in Conduct of Business, Collective Investment Schemes and Client Assets related operations.http://fshandbook.info/FS/html/handbook/SYSC/3/2#D33 Often, the CF10 function is held by the Chief Compliance Officer, whose role is to ensure that an organization is compliant with both internal and external policies and regulations. The chief compliance officer oversees the development and implementation of procedures that facilitate compliance and works with other executives to ensure compliance throughout all departments within an organization. He or she may also be responsible for ensuring that the organization has the necessary resources to research and track external laws, regulations, and industry standards. The 2007-8 Financial Crisis has had a serious impact on the compliance field, highlighting the need for radical reforms to ensure the solvency and transparency of firms in times of economic fluctuations as the implementation of globally agreed principles and standards remains highly challenging, given there are no legal powers to enforce or settle disputes between jurisdictions at the global level. The financial crisis in that respect created an opportunity for financial professionals to provide much needed context and clarity to investors.

His first work after arriving in the US in 1910 was The Wigglemuch (published by the New York Herald), a comic strip that has become his most famous piece. It was also the only collection of comic strip cartoons that he would ever publish.

The New York Times, in an article about the exhibit, remarked, regarding the comparison that \\"what resemblances may exist between the two artists is strongest in the spiritual quality of their attitude toward their art and a kind of personal symbolism not very clear to the uninitiated.\\" He married Neighborhood Playhouse founder Alice Lewisohn in 1924, and the two of them became part of the Carl Jung inner circle in Z√ºrich. Crowley was one of the first set designers for the Neighborhood Playhouse, designing sets for The Kairn of Koridwen in 1917. The New York Times mentioned the wedding, held in London in a small item on an obituaries page, identifying Crowley only as \\"an English artist.\\" The item went on to mention that \\"...

He went to the Middle East and he frequently visited India. Crowley eventually established himself in Z√ºrich, Switzerland, where he would spend the rest of his life. He died unexpectedly on 11 December 1937 in Ascona. Nowadays, some of his relatives still reside in Z√ºrich, conserving his personal collection of sketches, paintings, writings and personal items.

History The Diocese of DornakalK. J. G. Sundaram (1931): A Deccan Village in India, Journal of Geography, 30:2, 49-57 was formed on December 1912. Vedanayagam Samuel Azariah was the first Indian Anglican Bishop of Dornakal and was the most successful leader of grassroots movements of conversion to Christianity in South Asia during the early twentieth century. He was the first and only native Indian bishop of an Anglican diocese from 1912 until his death in 1945Harper, S. B., In the Shadow of the Mahatma: Bishop V. S. Azariah and the Travails of Christianity in British India. William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, Grand Rapids, Michigan, 2000. The Diocese of Dornakal began its life on 29 December 1912, when Vedanayagam Samuel Azariah was consecrated its first bishop in St. Paul's Cathedral, Calcutta. John Mott, the well-known missionary authority, who was present on the occasion, has stated that it was one of the most impressive ceremonies he ever witnessed. There were no fewer than eleven bishops of the Province of India taking part in the act of Consecration. Indians from all parts, and especially from the new bishop's own country of Tinnevelly, were present in large numbers to do honour to their distinguished brother. The real significance of the ceremony lay in the fact that Azariah was the first Indian to be consecrated a bishop in the Anglican CommunionChatterton, Eyre. The Diocese of Dornakal, 1912. A Diocese of Mass Movements. _IN,_ : _Project Canterbury: A History of the Church of England in India since the early days of the East India Company_ , London, SPCK, 1924 When the Diocese of Dornakal was first formed in 1912, it was quite a small diocese in the south-east corner of the Nizam's dominions. A few years later it was enlarged by the addition of the District of Dummagudem, in which the Church Missionary Society was working. Then came a Resolution of the Episcopal Synod in the year 1920, which transformed this comparatively small diocese into a diocese which has now probably as large, if not a larger number of Anglican Indian Christians than any other in India. By this resolution all the Mission Districts of both the Church Missionary Society and the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in the Telugu country, were placed under the Episcopal jurisdiction of the Bishop of Dornakal. The present Diocese of Dornakal includes a large portion of the Kistna district, together with the part of the Godavery district named Dummagudem; parts of the Kurnool and Cuddapah districts to the south occupied by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel; also the areas in the Hyderabad State occupied by the Indian Missionary Society of Tinnevelly, the Singareni Mission, the Khammamett Mission (formerly under the Church Missionary Society), and the recently formed Dornakal Diocesan Mission, which has started work in the area in the Mulag Taluq that has not been evangelised.

Life The son of Christopher Winter of Oxfordshire, he was born at Temple Balsall in Warwickshire. He early received religious impressions from the preaching of Slader, a puritan divine for whom his father had obtained the neighbouring chapel of Knowle. His father sent him in 1617 to King Henry VIII's school, Coventry, where William Dugdale was his contemporary under James Cranford. He went on to Emmanuel College and Queens' College, Cambridge, his tutor being John Preston. After graduating M.A., Winter placed himself under John Cotton, vicar of Boston, Lincolnshire, with a view to preparation for the ministry. Cotton found him a rich wife, and led him to the Independent position in religion. Recovering from illness, he became perpetual curate of Woodborough in Nottinghamshire, and developed his preaching. He obtained a lectureship at York, but after the outbreak of the First English Civil War, left it in 1642 for the vicarage of Cottingham in the East Riding of Yorkshire. Here he organised a church on the congregational model. Winter went to Ireland as chaplain to the four parliamentary commissioners. He went about the country with them, preaching. By 3 September 1651 the commissioners appointed him Provost of Trinity College Dublin, in succession to Anthony Martin who had died of the plague in 1650. On 18 November 1651 he performed the acts for B.D. On 3 June 1652 his appointment as Provost was confirmed by Oliver Cromwell. The degree of D.D. was conferred upon him by special grace on 17 August 1654; Henry Jones being vice- chancellor. Winter took trouble over the college estates; he secured the appointment (24 November 1656) of a lecturer in Hebrew, John Sterne; he made Greek and Hebrew compulsory subjects (14 June 1659) for the B.A. degree, and he imported men of learning from England as fellows. He kept up his preaching engagements, adding a lecture every three weeks at Maynooth. John Bridges induced him in 1655 to take the lead in forming a clerical association in which independents, presbyterians, and episcopalians could all meet. The Third Protectorate Parliament summoned Winter to London (13 August 1659). He was retained as Provost, and elected (28 November) divinity lecturer. But on 29 March 1660 he was called on to produce the charter of the college, and a copy of the statutory oath to be taken by provosts. This oath Winter had not taken, the pretext was used as a means of setting him aside. Money he had advanced to the college was never fully repaid. The government of the college was given (6 November) to Thomas Seele, a senior fellow, who was admitted Provost on 19 January 1661. The independent church which he had formed at the Church of St. Nicholas Within was ministered to by Samuel Mather, and lasted into the 19th century. From this point on Winter spent his time with friends at Chester and Coventry, and with his wife's relatives in Hertfordshire and Rutland. He fell ill in October 1666 in Rutland, preached privately the next Sunday, and then took to his bed, dying on 24 December 1666. He was buried at North Luffenham, Rutland. Works Winter published The Summe of Diverse Sermons preached in Dublin, Dublin, 1656 (in favour of infant baptism). He was one of several joint authors of the life (1657) of John Murcot. Family Winter left a good estate, thanks to the management of his second wife. His first wife was Anne Beeston (or Bestoe), by whom he had five sons. Three years after her death at Cottingham he married (before 1650) Elizabeth, daughter of Christopher Weaver, a woman of property, and with strong Baptist leanings.

Background He was the second son of Cosmo Gordon, 3rd Duke of Gordon (1720‚Äì1752) and his wife Lady Catherine Gordon (1718 - 10 December 1779), daughter of William Gordon, 2nd Earl of Aberdeen. His elder brother was Alexander Gordon, 4th Duke of Gordon (1743-1827). His younger brother was the controversial Lord George Gordon, notorious for the anti-Catholic riots named after him. He also had a sister, Lady Susan Gordon. Affair and elopement In the mid-1760s, Lord William had an affair with a married woman, Lady Sarah Bunbury, who had once been courted by King George III. In 1768, he fathered a child upon Lady Sarah, a daughter who was not immediately disclaimed by Sir Charles Bunbury, and received the name Louisa Bunbury. Nevertheless, Lady Sarah and Lord William eloped shortly afterwards, taking the infant with them. Lord William soon tired of his lover's incessant demands for attention, gifts and ceaseless entertainments and abandoned her. Her husband refused to take her back, and Lady Sarah returned to her brother's house with her child, while her husband, Sir Charles, moved Parliament for a divorce on grounds of adultery, citing her elopement, not the birth of Louisa. It was not until 1776 that the decree of divorce was issued. The affair with Lady Sarah ruined both hers and William's social reputation, and also his military and political career.

It was raided and destroyed on June 5, 1781, by Col. John Graves Simcoe of the Queen's Rangers. It was rebuilt and used for the manufacture and repair of arms and supplied material to combat the Whiskey Rebellion and to aid the Battle of Fallen Timbers. and Accompanying five photos The arsenal remained in service until 1801, when it was abandoned in favor of a more centralized arsenal at Richmond, the Virginia Manufactory of Arms. Today Point of Fork is a historic archaeological site. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1969. History The arsenal was located at Point of Fork, a point where the Fluvanna River (the name of the James River west of the Point of Fork) and Rivanna River meet. Stationed at Point of Fork were elements of the 5th Virginia (Gaskins' Battalion)wscottsmith.com Virginia Campaign - Gaskins War as well as elements of the local Fluvanna County militia. In May 1781, Baron von Steuben relocated to the arsenal. Von Steuben complained of the status of the militia found at Point of Fork, stating that there were few men and fewer provisions. Immediately, von Steuben set about refitting the 5th Virginia for deployment south with General Greene in South Carolina, this despite some controversy with the Virginia General Assembly after von Steuben's plan to reinforce the American armies in South Carolina was rejected for fear of leaving Virginia's rivers undefended. =Raid and destruction= Arsenal site, seen from across the James River By May 1781, General Cornwallis was determined to break the back of the Virginians and sent Lt. Col. Simcoe and a detachment of rangers to capture Point of Fork. Alongside this effort was a force under Col. Tarleton's cavalry, seeking to sack the Virginia General Assembly, capture Governor Thomas Jefferson, and burn out any warehouses or potential stores for the Marquis de Lafayette and his army to use in pursuit of Cornwallis. When Simcoe reached the arsenal, he expected to surprise the American forces and seize the stores. Von Steuben, believing that Simcoe's detachment was a sign that the entire British army under Cornwallis was nearby, abandoned Point of Fork Arsenal, leaving it to the British detachment as they made their way towards Charlottesville and Governor Jefferson. Tarleton, after failing in his mission of capturing Jefferson and the Virginia General Assembly, \\"destroying one thousand new muskets, four hundred barrels of powder, several hogsheads of tobacco, and a quantity of soldier's clothing\\"http://freepages.history.rootsweb.com/~wcarr1/Lossing1/Chap45.html returned to Point of Fork to Elk's Hill, a plantation owned by Jefferson, thoroughly destroying the stores and wares, even to the point of slitting the throats of the horses on the plantation. Von Steuben carried the large part of the blame for the abandonment of Point of Fork arsenal, to the point Virginia's General Assembly ordered an investigation into von Steuben's conduct. Von Steuben was adamant that the provisions and men were not as stated by the legislature, and given both the condition of his hurried preparations, the sudden arrival of Cornwallis, and his belief that the entire British army was nearby, von Steuben exasperation was summarized; \\"Every farmer is a general ‚Ä¶ but nobody wishes to be a soldier.\\" Further rising to the defense of von Steuben is the notable action of the 5th Virginia Regiment during the 1781 Virginia Campaign, despite the notable lack of clothing, muskets, bayonets, and other equipment. Despite this, the 5th Virginia pushed to within 350 yards of the British lines at Yorktown before Cornwallis surrendered on October 19, 1781.Fluvanna County, Virginia Order Book, 1779-1782 References Category:Archaeological sites on the National Register of Historic Places in Virginia Category:National Register of Historic Places in Fluvanna County, Virginia Category:Virginia in the American Revolution Category:American Revolution on the National Register of Historic Places ","title":"Point of Fork Arsenal"},{"id":"39870146","text":"Philip Clissett by Maxwell Balfour, 1898 Philip Clissett (born 8 January 1817, Birtsmorton, Worcestershire, England; died 17 January 1913, Bosbury, Herefordshire) was a Victorian country chairmaker who influenced and inspired the English Arts and Crafts Movement through various architects and designers. His chance meeting with James MacLaren has been described as \\"undoubtedly a seminal point in the subsequent development of the Arts and Crafts Movement\\", and led to the furnishing of the meeting room of the Art Workers Guild with a large number of his chairs which can still be seen today. These chairs have been \\"highly influential\\", having been \\"seen by almost everyone involved in art and design from the late 1880s\\". They particularly influenced Ernest Gimson who, in 1890, spent six weeks with Clissett learning to make ladderback chairs. Clissett's chairs were popular with the Arts and Crafts cognoscenti, and were used by Charles Rennie Mackintosh in early commissions, and by the architectural team of Richard Barry Parker and Raymond Unwin. They were also used as part of the original furnishing of the Passmore Edwards Settlement at Mary Ward House, 5 Tavistock Place, London by the architects A. Dunbar Smith and C. Cecil Brewer. Clissett made chairs in the West Midlands tradition, turning the parts from fresh, unseasoned ash (Fraxinus excelsior) with a pole lathe. Other parts were sawn and shaped with a drawknife while held in a shave horse. Seats were generally made from an elm board, or from woven rush. While rush-seated ladderback chairs are his most well-known output, he also made spindleback chairs which are often stamped with his initials. Clissett is often referred to as a bodger but this is incorrect as he made entire chairs rather than just turned parts. Clissett's chairs are now widely collected, and can be found in various museums, including: *Victoria and Albert Museum, London *Geffrye Museum, London *New Walk Museum, Leicester *Cheltenham Art Gallery & Museum, Cheltenham, Gloucestershire *Worcestershire County Museum, Hartlebury Castle, Hartlebury, *Worcestershire *Hereford Museum and Art Gallery, Hereford *Butchers Row House Museum, Ledbury, Herefordshire *Los Angeles County Museum of Art, USA  References   External links  * Philip Clissett Research Website - much more detail and images Category:British furniture makers Category:19th-century English people Category:People from Herefordshire Category:1817 births Category:1913 deaths Category:Arts and Crafts movement ","title":"Philip Clissett"},{"id":"39870148","text":"The Woxna mine is one of the largest graphite mines in Sweden and in the world.

Name  The name Fuwwah is derived from the Arabic word for saffron, fuwwa. History Fuwwah is identified with the ancient Metelis (; ), the capital of the Metelite nome (the 7th nome of Lower Egypt). Medieval Fuwwah grew to become one of the most important cities in al-Dimashqi's time, when he compared its size to that of Cairo. Fuwwah's prosperity owed largely to the decline of Rosetta at that time. Fuwwah was the capital of a province variously called Fuwwah or Al-Muzahamiyatayn. Fuwwah's Christian bishopric remained active through the late thirteenth century, indicating the presence of a large Christian population at the time. Its location on the Rosetta branch of the Nile meant that residents could easily travel by boat, the main mode of transport in the Nile Delta at the time - overland travel was potentially dangerous, as evidenced by the inability of Yusab, the bishop of Fuwwah, to travel to the Synod of 1250 due to Bedouin raids. One of the most important monuments in Fuwwah is the Fez factory established in 1824 by an order from Muhammed Ali Pasha. The 1885 Census of Egypt recorded Fuwwah as a nahiyah under the district of Desouk in Gharbia Governorate; at that time, the population of the town was 9,902 (4,805 men and 5,097 women).

Development began in April 2012 as a game jam entry and continued with developer and popular support, existing as an Early Access game. The game was released on 15 October 2015 for Microsoft Windows and OS X, and a Linux port followed two days later. A PlayStation 4 version was released on 1 March 2016 and a Nintendo Switch port was released on 6 September 2018.  Gameplay  Animation of a miniboss fight, displaying gameplay and the game's destructible environment The player-character is a bro, a hypermasculine action hero-style commando, who fights terrorists and rescues his bro teammates and prisoners of war from captivity. The game's destructible environments wear away with the player's gunfire. The levels end when the player defeats a devil boss, hoists an American flag, and leaves via helicopter while the scenery explodes. The Broforce initially includes several characters, and the player earns more as they rescue a certain number of prisoners of war. These Broforce characters, under direction of \\"Nelson Brodela\\", are parodies of fictional action heroes, including John Rambo, Die Hard John McClane, Chuck Norris, Mr. T, Alien Ellen Ripley, and Terminator T-800; they are often named by adding the word \\"bro\\" to the original name in some manner (e.g., Rambro, the Brominator). The player does not have control on which Broforce character they will start the level with, and each time that character dies or a prisoner of war is rescued, they will be switched to a different Broforce character. Each character has unique attacks and moves based on the fictional hero; for example, Ripley's character has a flamethrower special ability, while the Indiana Jones-based character primarily uses a whip.  Development  Free Lives submitted Rambros as an entry in the April 2012 Ludum Dare 23 game jam. It won first prize for \\"fun\\" and received enough positive feedback to continue as a team project. The developers thought to add a cooperative mode with another character, Brommando, which then became the core game concept of collecting \\"bros\\" with a \\"violent action movie feel\\". The game's interest in \\"bros\\" stems from game director Evan Greenwood's love for action films from the 1980s and 1990s, which led to the game's aesthetics, themes, and gameplay, like traveling to outer space, fighting a dinosaur, and racing sharks. The bros share a kinship in each other's self-defense and when fighting terrorism together. Greenwood has called Broforce a \\"loving portrayal of action heroes\\". The developers debated the addition of female heroes and their place alongside the game's existing tropes. They chose not to add a \\"token female\\" or to create a rival female Broforce for plot or romance purposes, and instead made the female characters part of the existing team so as not to distinguish by gender. The game was designed to be a lighthearted hyperbole of the 1980s action film genre. Greenwood noted the difficulties of translating the genre's trope of remorseless violence into the 2013 climate surrounding foreign relations and human casualties of battle, particularly the stories of individual heroes waging unilateral war on a region. The team balanced what it saw as a modern perspective on war with their cultural heritage from the 1980s films, and hoped that their game would challenge \\"bro culture\\" stereotypes of irresponsibility and drunkenness with a sense of righteousness and a positive manliness. In July 2013, Greenwood commented that the team wanted to build a space opera with roguelike elements, Contra-style aliens, themes of Satan in big business, betrayal, and bro identity, explosions that create weightlessness, and a story where the Broforce themselves are rescued. He discussed a cyborg bro who questions his bro and human status for not having feelings before realizing that the other bros do not feel either. leftA free Broforce game demo called \\"Brototype\\" was released from the developer's website, which sampled the gameplay but not the game's narrative. The game was approved on Steam Greenlight on 24 July 2013 and open for Steam Early Access on 7 April 2014 with a planned full release in Q2 2014 for Microsoft Windows and consoles. The final game is expected to include online multiplayer, deathmatch arenas with leaderboards, a level editor, and better graphics. In August 2014, a standalone expansion based on The Expendables 3 called The Expendabros was released. Later, The Expendabros expansion became free to play in order to promote The Expendables 3 film and remained so until 31 December of that year. In February 2015, the game was expanded with the adding of Alien Infestation. On 15 October 2015, the game was fully released and again expanded, with the ability to fight Satan. The full game, without The Expendabros expansion, was ported to PlayStation 4 and released on 1 March 2016. A Nintendo Switch port was announced in July 2018.  Reception  Eurogamers Jeffrey Matulef described the game demo as an \\"instantly addictive throwback to retrogaming\\" and noted the uniqueness of its destructible environment. Several reporters compared the game to Terraria. IGN awarded it a score of 8.8 out of 10, saying \\"Beneath Broforce's bad puns and bulging biceps lies a brilliant ode to action cinema and retro gaming.\\" PC Gamer awarded it 78%, saying \\"Brash, solid, run ‚Äòn‚Äô gun goofiness that's a tad too underwrought to be truly brilliant.\\" The Escapist awarded it four and a half stars out of five, saying \\"Broforce is a silly, but sincere love letter to iconic action movies, refined to perfection with rich environments and wonderfully-crafted enemies.\\"  See also  * Dudebro II, another indie action video game that draws inspiration from bro culture  References   External links  * Category:2015 video games Category:Devolver Digital games Category:Early access video games Category:Indie video games Category:Linux games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:MacOS games Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:PlayStation Network games Category:Cancelled PlayStation Vita games Category:Run and gun games Category:Shooter video games Category:Steam Greenlight games Category:Steam Workshop games Category:Unity (game engine) games Category:Windows games Category:Video games about terrorism Category:Video games developed in South Africa Category:Ludum Dare video games ","title":"Broforce"},{"id":"39870197","text":"The Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party ‚Äì Egypt Region ( Hizb Al-Ba'ath Al-Arabi Al- Ishtiraki ‚Äì Misr) is an Egyptian Neo-Ba'athist political party.

History and functions  The origin of the office is disputed: the department is first attested in the reign of Emperor Theophilos (r. 829‚Äì842), but some scholars (e.g. Rodolphe Guilland) derive the etymology of the eidikon department from the word idikos, \\"private\\", indicating a continuation of the Late Roman office of comes rerum privatarum.. This view is rejected by others, notably J. B. Bury, who see it as a wholly separate institution, juxtaposing the \\"special\\" department of the eidikon with the \\"general\\" department or genikon, and consider it as originating in the military departments of the Late Roman praetorian prefectures.. Ernst Stein, on the other hand, connected it to the word eidos (meaning \\"ware\\"), and regarded the eidikon as the treasury for revenue paid in kind rather than coin.. The eidikon fulfilled the dual function of imperial treasury and storehouse. As a treasury, it stored various precious materials such as silk or gold, and was responsible for the payment of the annual salaries (rogai) of officials of senatorial rank. As a storehouse, the eidikon controlled the state factories producing military equipment (the Late Roman fabricae) and was responsible for supplying the necessary mat√©riel for expeditions, ranging from weapons to \\"sails, ropes, hides, axes, wax, tin, lead, casks\\" for the fleet or even Arab clothing for imperial spies.. For expeditions in which the emperor himself took part, the eidikos accompanied the army at the head of his own baggage train of 46 pack-horses carrying everything \\"from shoes to candlesticks\\", as well as large sums of gold and silver coinage for the emperor's use.. The department is still attested as late as 1081, but was probably abolished some time after; Rodolphe Guilland suggested that the logothesion of the oikeiakoi (\\"household men\\") took over its functions (cf. logothetes ton oikeiakon)..  Staff  As with all Byzantine department heads, the eidikos had a number of subordinate officials: * The basilikoi notarioi (Œ≤Œ±œÉŒπŒªŒπŒ∫ŒøŒØ ŒΩŒøœÑŒ¨œÅŒπŒøŒπ, \\"imperial notaries\\"), as in all fiscal departments, usually of spatharios rank or lower; a protonotarios (\\"first notary\\") is attested in the Komnenian period (1081‚Äì1185)... * The archontes t≈çn ergodosi≈çn (, \\"masters of the factories\\") and meizoteroi t≈çn ergodosi≈çn (, \\"overseers/foremen of the factories\\"). As their name indicates, they supervised individual state factories for silk, jewelry, weapons, etc. They are well attested in seals from the 7th century on, and from the 9th century on they are frequently called kouratores... * The hebdomadarioi tou eidikou (), palace servants. The seat of the eidikon was in a special building within the Great Palace of Constantinople, which tradition ascribed to Constantine the Great (r. 306‚Äì337). It was situated between the great halls of the Triconchos and the Lausiakos, near the imperial audience hall of the Chrysotriklinos.

But if all these things were more elegant, I do not really think the films would be more enjoyable: the badness is part of the funniness.\\"\\"In praise of Carrying on\\", The Observer, 9 August 1964, p. 23 Filmography { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\\" style=\\"margin-right: 0;\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Title ! scope=\\"col\\"  Year ! scope=\\"col\\"  Screenplay ! scope=\\"col\\"  Music ! scope=\\"col\\"  Distributor ! scope=\\"col\\"  Production costs ! scope=\\"col\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"  Notes - ! scope=\\"row\\" Carry On Sergeant 1958   Anglo Amalgamated Film DistributorsOn Sergeant (1958), British Film Institute, accessed 16 March 2012  ¬£74,000Snelgrove (2003), p. 46 Carry On Sergeant was based on the novel The Bull Boys by R.

Origins Military wristwatches are believed to have received their name from a German military request for a soldier in a watch house, otherwise known as a guard tower. One story tells that the military wristwatches came into use when a German naval officer needed to know the time but could not pull out a pocket watch since both his hands were busy operating the machine. Another story is that Wilhelm I placed an order at a Berlin trade show. These new wrist watches saw their first action in the Boer War.http://www.stevelundin.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/military-watch.pdf Later seen in World War I, rudimentary wrist watches were small sized pocket watches with metal lugs soldered on so that a fabric strap could hold the watch to a wrist. Some had no cover over the watch crystal, while others had a metal cover, some of these had pieces of the cover cut, so that the watch could be seen without opening the cover. General watches =US Army specification 55-1B= This watch was known for its luminous hands and markers, had a seven jewel movement, an olive drab cotton strap, and a stainless steel case. It has been described as \\"reasonably shock resistant and waterproof\\". They are accurate to 30 seconds per day, and are produced by Movado, Waltham, Elgin, and Hamilton. =MIL-W-3818A= Revision A of specification MIL-W-3818 was released on March 12, 1956 to include the following: A. Reduce the variety of grades and types of watches. B. Assure consistent quality of items. C. Eliminate testing requirements of one year and substitute in lieu thereof a guarantee provision. D. Incorporate a new case design. MIL-W-3818B * October 17, 1962http://milspectime.com/?p=18 The B revision was meant to provide a single standard for a 17 jewel watch with a life of at least two years. It required the 1.40‚Ä≥ metal case and all metal pieces be protected by a finish or preservative with the exception of parts which would be adversely effected if so treated. A black, non-ferrous metal dial with numerals and graduations in white, a triangular hour indice at 12 was required to be luminescent yellow and the other hour markers were green in color. Hands made of cartridge brass, painted white, filled with green luminescent paint, the tip of the second hand was luminescent orange with tritium (hydrogen 3) as the luminescent. It required a 17 jewel bearings, stem wound and set, a power reserve of 36 hours and a 30-second daily accuracy rate. It is straight-knurled and includes the \\"dimple\\" typical of similar period Benrus U.S. military watches (e.g. Benrus Type I / II and the MIL-W-46374). The acrylic crystal is referred to as \\"copolymer plastic\\". Drawing C 8636227 was to be used for the band, but was amended on January 12, 1966, to now follow the newly published MIL-S-46383 Type II strap ‚Äì color black. Benrus Watch Co., Longines-Wittnauer Watch Co., Mathey-Tissot Watch Co. (Frankfort Arsenal documents refer to the company as *Matbey*.) and Clinton Watch Co. of Chicago submitted samples in bid for the specification with only the Benrus meeting it. On September 16, 1963, Benrus was notified that its product was now on the Qualified Products List for Specification MIL-W-3818B. On February 2, 1964, the Marine Corps submitted a Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request to purchase 10,849 MIL-W-3818B watches, a request for proposal was issued to Benrus on February 7, 1964. Benrus quoted a unit price of $28.28. Bulova alleged that Benrus merely imported cases and sold watch movements from foreign sources. Benrus‚Äô documents were submitted and showed that it imported the movement and dial setting, dial stem and springbars and that the case, crown, attachments, packaging material, and jewel bearings were all domestically produced. The costs of the domestic components were in excess of 50 percent of the costs, meeting the requirement. =MIL-W-46374= *46374C 1983http://www.antiquevintagewatches.com/military-watches.html#wwii Navigation watches =A-11= 1943 US Army Air Force - A-11 Navigation watch with 15 jewels, a black or white dial, a dull stainless steel case, and an olive drab or black cotton band. *British designation 6B/234http://forums.watchuseek.com/f7/wristwatch-won-world-war-ii-11-american- watch-icon-207560.html *British Bulova Mark VIII, with an A.

As the US military gained experience with amphibious landings they developed new strategies, one of them was the Navy's formation of combat demolition units. In the summer of 1943, in Fort Pierce Florida, training for these units began, one emphasis of their training was swimming and amphibious landings.http://milspectime.com/?p=909#more-909 In Operation Overlord during the D-Day landings, the Navy's CDU teams on Utah Beach were able to clear 1,600 yards of beach of steel and concrete obstacles, paving the way for the liberation of France, and the end of World War II.http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/static-legacy/ngm/0206/feature1/ =18W8 (INT) wristwatch (watertight) \\"buship\\" \\"canteen\\" dive watch= An iconic post military watch and a result of the Navy's FSX-797, colloquially known as the US Navy's Bureau of Ships \\"canteen watch\\", started out with Jacques Depollier & Sons's waterproof and dustproof strap watch. The first known example of the now common \\"screw down crown\\", unlike later examples of the canteen watch, this one lacked the emblematic chain anchoring the crown to the watch. One unusual feature of this watch was the heat disk on the back of the case to prevent the heat from the wearer's wrist from causing the oil in the watch to drip out of the jewel holes. Depollier ads claim that the US Army Signal Corps used the case to protect watch movement stores in long-term storage. The gasketed and spring-loaded screw-down crown is kept on the case by two flanges on the crown held against two grooves on the case.http://milspectime.com/?p=825 US Navy Bureau of Ships specification 18W8, published in December 1944. A matte black metal dial, two vertical luminous dots over 12, along with one for every other hour, the hour and minute hand, as well as the tip of the second hand covered in radium lume. With war shortages, the case was made of chromed base metal. A koroseal gasket is used inside the crown. The crystal is tempered glass with a metal rim soldered to the case creating a watertight seal. The 17-jewel sweep-second movement is covered by another koroseal gasket under the caseback. Later, better-known dive watches would come from Elgin and Hamilton. =22717A= With the advent of SCUBA diving, the canteen watches, limited to 49 feet, needed to be replaced. The military needed watches, issued in 1961 for special forces, that could be submerged up to 400 ft and were nonmagnetic. A new spec needed to be included to accommodate this; spec 22717A, which superseded several previous specs. With SCUBA's commercial and public use, as well as the natural evolution of watches, the military started buying the commercial dive watches that were entering the market. Popular examples included the Benrus 7951 and 7952, the Blancpain 50 Fathoms, the Doxa 300T, the Rolex Oyster Perpetual, and Submariner, the Tudor Submariner and Prince, the Seiko DEO-95, and the Zodiac Sea Wolf. The first watch made for 22717A was made by Allen Tornek in the Rayville Factory, a representative of Blancpain, it was the Tornek-Rayville TR900. =Mil-W-50717= References Category:Watches Category:Watch models Category:Military personal equipment ","title":"US military watches"},{"id":"39870339","text":"This is a list of companies based in Idaho.

Every TSR includes at least three components: 1) a point of delivery (POD), where the power is injected into the utility's transmission network; 2) a point of receipt (POR), where the power is withdrawn from the utility's transmission network; 3) the amount of power, or capacity, in megawatts to be reserved. In order to receive TSR, a transmission customer (TC) must complete a transmission service request and go through a system impact study to determine if the existing transmission facilities can reliably accommodate the physical transfer of the electric power. If the capacity is not available, the transmission customer may decide to pay to upgrade the transmission network.  Background  Open access to transmission facilities arose from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Order 888, issued April 24, 1996. This order required each utility which transmitted electric energy in interstate commerce to file an Open Access Transmission Tariff (OATT) to stipulate the process for non-discriminatory access to its transmission facilities. This access includes generation interconnection and transmission service. Generation interconnection allows for a power generator to connect to the transmission system while transmission service allows for the delivery of electricity through the transmission system. The goal of open access to electric power transmission facilities is to reduce electricity prices by promoting wholesale competition. In exchange for transmission service, transmitting utilities are allowed to charge the customer costs associated with the access to their transmission network. The cost for TSR is determined by a formula contained in the OATT and is often in the units of dollars per megawatt per year. TSRs are often renewed on an annual basis.  Uses of transmission service rights  Transmission service rights can be used for multiple purposes. Often, the TSR is used to facilitate two parties to arrange a power purchase agreement by transferring power from a generator to a load through the utility's transmission facilities. A few of the many potential scenarios where TSRs would be necessary: # Commercial and Industrial (C&I;) load desires to purchase power from a generator using a utility's transmission network. # C&I; load is connected to one utility but desires to purchase bulk electric power from another utility. # A generator is connected to one utility but desires to sell power to another utility. # Two utilities desire to transfer power through another utility's network. TSR is often pursued when it is either the lowest cost option or is necessary to meet a renewable portfolio standard.

The origin of its name comes from the town's founder James Cropper, a blacksmith and store keeper who was the first person to build a house there sometime in the 1790s. He also was the town's first postmaster. The majority of Cropper's original citizens were members of the Low Dutch colony who were in the area as early as 1786. In 1807, a new group of settlers from Virginia increased the town's population. In 1855, the Louisville and Nashville Railroad (L and N) along with a depot opened on the east end of town. A hotel soon opened afterwards. This railroad line was closed in the early 1970s. Another occurrence, in 1855, was the founding of Union Grove Church. This church had three different denominations that included Christian, Methodist and Baptist. The only cemetery in Cropper is on the church grounds. In June 1900, the Baptist separated from the Union Church, and by 1903 it had its own building. In 1967, the Union Grove Church was renamed Cropper Christian Church. In 1905, a bank was opened by Ben Allen Thomas, but it was closed in 1921. An 1882 map shows the first school in Cropper which was a large two-story building with grades one through twelve. It burned in 1951 and was replaced with a one-story elementary school. The team mascot was the Yellow Jackets. References 1\\"History of Shelby County, Kentucky\\" By George L.

Mount Nelson showed great promise as a two-year-old in 2006 when he won the Crit√©rium International less than a month after his racecourse debut. Hopes that he would become a classic contender in 2007 ended when he sustained a serious foot injury early in the year. He returned as a four-year- old to win the Eclipse and ran well in defeat in several other major races. He was then retired to stud and sired several good winners both on the flat and over jumps. Background Mount Nelson was a bay horse with a white star and stripe bred by the Cliveden Park Stud in Buckinghamshire. Mount Nelson was from the first crop of foals sired by Rock of Gibraltar who won seven Group 1 races in a row, including the 2000 Guineas. He has gone on to sire a number of other top racehorses, including Society Rock, Eagle Mountain, Varenar (Prix de la For√™t) and Samitar (Irish 1000 Guineas). Mount Nelson's dam, Independence, was a high-class racemare who won four races including the Matron Stakes and the Sun Chariot Stakes in 2001. She was descended from Home on the Range, the dam of the Epsom Derby winner Reference Point. Apart from Mount Nelson, Independence's best performer has been Monitor Closely, who won the Great Voltigeur Stakes and finished third in the St Leger Stakes. As a yearling, the colt was consigned from the New England Stud to the Tattersalls sales at Newmarket. On 5 October he was bought for 330,000 guineas by the bloodstock agent Dermot \\"Demi\\" O'Byrne, acting on behalf of John Magnier's Coolmore organisation. Like many Coolmore horses, the details of Mount Nelson's ownership varied from race to race: he was sometimes listed as being owned by Derrick Smith, while in other races he was listed as the property of a partnership of Smith, Susan Magnier and Michael Tabor. The colt was trained throughout his racing career by Aidan O'Brien at Ballydoyle. Racing career =2006: two-year-old season= Mount Nelson did not compete in a race until late autumn, but then ran three times in a little over three weeks. On 6 October he started at odds of 5/2 in a seven furlong maiden race at Gowran Park, County Kilkenny and finished second of the fourteen runners behind the Dermot Weld-trained Treasure Map. In a similar event at the Curragh Racecourse sixteen days later, the colt started 2/1 favourite against twenty-eight opponents. Ridden by Seamie Heffernan, Mount Nelson established a clear lead approaching the final quarter mile and drew away from the field in the closing stages to win impressively by six lengths. Eight days after his win in the Curragh maiden race, the colt was moved up abruptly in class when he was sent to France to contest the Group One Crit√©rium International over 1600 metres at Saint-Cloud Racecourse. He was coupled in the betting with his stable companion Yellowstone and went off at odds of 10.9/1, with the locally trained Spirit One being made the 3/5 favourite. Heffernan restrained Mount Nelson in the early stages before moving up to challenge the leaders in the straight. He took the lead approaching the last 200 metres and held off a sustained challenge of Spirit One to win by a short-head in a photo-finish, with Yellowstone in third. Despite the soft ground, the winning time of 1:41.3 was a new course record. Commenting on the performance, O'Brien said \\"Our decision to run Mount Nelson twice in the period of a week was justified, but it was a big risk. He's a lovely horse who will be even better next year when he should stay further.\\" The trainer went on to mention the 2000 Guineas and the Poule d'Essai des Poulains as future targets, whilst bookmakers introduced him into the betting for the 2007 Epsom Derby at odds of 20/1. =2007: three-year-old season= Mount Nelson was being prepared for his three-year-old campaign when he sustained a serious injury to his left front foot. According to O'Brien the colt \\"tore off a shoe... and took half of his foot off with it\\". Both the hoof and bone were damaged, necessitating surgery and a long period of recuperation. He made his one and only appearance of the season at Newmarket Racecourse in October when he ran in the Champion Stakes. He started a 16/1 outsider and finished eleventh of the twelve runners, forty lengths behind the winner Literato. =2008: four-year-old season= On his return to racing as a four-year-old, Mount Nelson started odd-on favourite for the Mooresbridge Stakes at the Curragh in May, but was never in contention and finished sixth of the eight runners. A month later he showed improved form to finish third in the Prix du Chemin de Fer du Nord at Chantilly despite having difficulty obtaining a clear run in the straight. On 17 June, Mount Nelson returned to Group One level for the Queen Anne Stakes over one mile at Royal Ascot. Racing against leading milers he started at odds of 33/1 and finished fifth of the ten runners behind Haradasun, Darjina, Finsceal Beo and Cesare, beaten just over a length by the winner. For the second race in succession he encountered trouble in running, being \\"squeezed out\\" approaching the final furlong. On 5 July, Mount Nelson started the 7/2 second favourite in for the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown Park Racecourse. The field for the weight-for-age event appeared to be well below the usual standard: none of Mount Nelson's seven opponents had won at Group One level. Ridden by Johnny Murtagh, the colt was held up in the early stages before making progress in the straight. Despite hanging to the right a furlong from the finish he caught the leader Phoenix Tower in the last stride and won by a short-head. Commenting on the colt's victory, O'Brien said that \\"the whole team did a great job to get him back, and they need to take all the credit. He is an amazing horse to come back, and we didn‚Äôt think he would make it.\\" After a break of two months, Mount Nelson was sent to the United States to contest the Arlington Million over one and a quarter miles at Arlington Park. Murtagh positioned the colt in second place for most of the race, but he could make no progress in the straight and finished third behind Spirit One and Archipenko. Assessment In the 2008 edition of the World Thoroughbred Racehorse Rankings, Mount Nelson was given a rating of 119, making him the fifty-second best racehorse in the world. Stud record Mount Nelson was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion at Newsells Park Stud in Hertfordshire, where he stood at a fee of ¬£6,000 along with Nathaniel and the leading sprinter Equiano. The best of his first crop of foals was the filly Purr Along, which won the Prix du Calvados at Deauville Racecourse in August 2012. At Royal Ascot in June 2013, Berkshire, a colt from Mount Nelson's second crop won the Listed Chesham Stakes by two and a half lengths. The most successful of his subsequent offspring was the sprinter Librisa Breeze (British Champions Sprint Stakes). He later moved to the Boardsmill Stud in County Meath where he stood as a National Hunt stallion, siring the Stayers' Hurdle winner Penhill. After a \\"prolonged battle with lymphangitis\\" he died in 2019 at the age of fifteen. Pedigree Note: b. = Bay, ch. = Chestnut * Mount Nelson is inbred 4x4 to Northern Dancer.

It is known from fragmentary jaws and isolated teeth from a site in the early Barstovian, around 15‚Äì16 million years ago, of Nevada. Together with other species from scattered localities in the United States, Japan, and Europe, Apeomyoides is classified in the subfamily Apeomyinae of the extinct rodent family Eomyidae. Apeomyines are a rare but widespread group that may have been adapted to a relatively dry habitat. As is characteristic of apeomyines, Apeomyoides was a large eomyid with high-crowned cheekteeth and a large gap between the incisors and cheekteeth. Furthermore, the cheekteeth‚Äîpremolars and molars‚Äîapproach a bilophodont pattern, with two distinct lobes. Other features distinguish Apeomyoides from other apeomyines, including the rectangular shape of the cheekteeth. The fourth lower premolar (p4) is larger than the molars behind it and has two roots, while the lower molars have three.  Taxonomy  Apeomyoides is a member of the Eomyidae, a diverse rodent family that is now extinct. Eomyids first appeared in the Middle Eocene (~47 million years ago, mya) in North America, where they existed until the end of the Miocene (~5 mya). In Europe, they survived a little longer, until the end of the Pliocene (~2‚Äì3 mya). Apeomyoides is further part of a distinctive subgroup of eomyids known as the Apeomyinae. The first apeomyine to be discovered was Apeomys tuerkheimae, named in 1968 based on fossils from the Early Miocene of Germany, and later discoveries have expanded the range of Apeomys and similar taxa. In 1998, Old≈ôich Fejfar and colleagues reviewed Apeomys and identified a second, related genus Megapeomys, from the Early Miocene of Germany, the Czech Republic, and Japan. These scientists also named a new eomyid subfamily, Apeomyinae, to house Apeomys and Megapeomys. The Japanese Megapeomys was named as a separate species, Megapeomys repenningi, in 2011. Further apeomyines have been identified in North America: Megapeomys bobwilsoni from the Hemingfordian of Nevada, Apeomyoides savagei from the Barstovian of Nevada, Zophoapeomys indicum from the Late Oligocene of South Dakota, and a possible second species of Zophoapeomys from the Late Oligocene of Nebraska. Another North American eomyid, Arikareeomys skinneri, from the Arikareean of Nebraska, has also been reidentified as an apeomyine. In general, apeomyines are a widespread but generally rare group of dentally distinctive eomyids with a tendency towards large size. Fejfar and colleagues suggested that apeomyines were ecologically distinct from other eomyids and probably preferred a drier habitat. Although other scientists recognized Apeomyinae as a subfamily, in a 2008 summary of North American eomyids, Lawrence Flynn placed the group as a tribe, Apeomyini, within the subfamily Eomyinae. Flynn described Apeomyoides as the most derived apeomyine. Apeomyoides savagei was described as a new genus and species by Kent Smith, Richard Cifelli, and Nicholas Czaplewski in 2006. The generic name, Apeomyoides, adds the Greek suffix -ides, indicating similarity, to the name of the related genus Apeomys, while the specific name, savagei, honors Donald E. Savage for his work on fossil mammals and for assistance to Smith. In the same paper, these scientists argued in favor of apeomyine affinities for Arikareeomys.  Description  Apeomyoides savagei is a large eomyid, though not as large as Megapeomys lindsayi and M. bobwilsoni. Megapeomys repenningi from Japan is similar in size, but its cheekteeth are not as high- crowned. A. savagei shows a series of traits that are characteristic for the apeomyines: high-crowned cheekteeth with thick enamel that are bilophodont (divided into two lobes) in form and a very long diastema (gap) between the lower incisor and cheekteeth. However, the cheekteeth are higher-crowned than those of other apeomyines, including Apeomys, Megapeomys, and Arikareeomys, and they are rectangular in shape, while other apeomyines have barrel-shaped teeth. Similarly, the oldest apeomyine, Zophoapeomys, is smaller and has lower-crowned cheekteeth. The known material of Apeomyoides consists of a number of fragmentary mandibles (lower jaws) and isolated cheekteeth. The length of the first and second lower molars (m1 and m2) ranges from 1.74 to 2.58 mm, the width from 2.08 to 2.33 mm. The fourth upper premolar (P4) has not been recorded, but there is a specimen of its deciduous precursor (DP4). This tooth is characterized by four major cusps (protocone, paracone, hypocone, and metacone) and lophs or crests (protoloph, mesoloph, metaloph, and posteroloph), separated by synclines or valleys. The first and second upper molar (M1 and M2) are almost square and similar in size and structure to the DP4. An additional loph on M1 and M2, the entoloph, is incomplete in Apeomyoides, but more prominent in both Megapeomys bobwilsoni and Arikareeomys. The four lower cheekteeth‚Äîthe fourth lower premolar (p4) and first through third lower molars (m1‚Äìm3)‚Äîare high-crowned teeth. Like the upper teeth, they bear four cusps (metaconid, protoconid, entoconid, and hypoconid), four lophs (metalophid, mesolophid, hypolophid, and posterolophid) and three valleys. Each of the lower cheekteeth lacks an additional loph, the ectolophid, which is present in Arikareeomys. The p4 is larger than any of the molars and longer than it is wide. Among the molars, m1 and m2 do not differ appreciably from each other and are a little wider than they are long, while m3 is a little smaller and its back side is more rounded and narrower. Syncline IV, which is located at the back of the tooth, between the hypolophid and posterolophid, is closed at the margins; this valley is open in Megapeomys bobwilsoni. Syncline IV also opens into the centrally located syncline III; this opening is absent in Arikareeomys. There are two roots under p4 and three under each of the molars, fewer than in Megapeomys bobwilsoni, which shows three under p4 and four under the molars. On the mandible, the diastema is very large and the incisor is procumbent (projecting forward), which distinguishes Apeomyoides from most eomyids apart from Megapeomys. There is a masseteric scar (associated with the jaw muscles) from below the m1 forward to a point in front of p4, below the mental foramen, an opening in the jawbone. In Apeomys and Megapeomys this scar only reaches to the level of the front root of p4. The mental foramen is very small and opens in the diastema, near the ventral shelf of the scar; in Apeomys and Megapeomys it is located near the dorsal shelf. Further foramina are present on the lingual (inner) surface of the bone, below the cheekteeth. Cheekteeth of Apeomyoides savagei seen in occlusal view (looking at the chewing surface), with electron micrographs in stereopairs and explanatory drawings. A, right P4 through M3 of the holotype. B, left DP4. C, left M1 or M2.  Distribution and ecology  Apeomyoides savagei is from the Eastgate local fauna in the Monarch Mill Formation of Churchill County, Nevada. This fauna dates to the early Barstovian land mammal age, around 15‚Äì16 mya. This makes Apeomyoides the youngest known apeomyine, and its occurrence helps close a gap in the known geographic range of North American apeomyines between Megapeomys bobwilsoni elsewhere in Nevada and Arikareeomys in Nebraska.

Eduardo Mezzacapo (1832‚Äì1898) was an Italian mandolinist, recognized as a virtuoso. He was also a composer, and a performer, organizing and playing in a mandolin quartet in France. Although he died before recording technology, his quartet did get recorded between 1905 and 1910. He was also the founder of l'Ecole de mandoline fran√ßaise (The French Mandolin School).Fred Gouin, on Jimdo, \\"La famille Mezzacapo\\" Advertisement for music publisher J. Rowies (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) for mandolin sheet music. Artists include Silvio Ranieri and other mandolinists of his day, including Carlo Munier, Enrico Marucelli, Edgar Bara, and Salvador Leonardi. Taken from the book The guitar and mandolin, Biographies of celebrated players and composers for these instruments by Philip J. Bone, published by Schott and Company, London, 1914. At the time that he was teaching in France and at the school, the mandolin was regaining popularity. There had been a decline since the early 19th century, but around the beginning of the 20th century from the 1880s to the 1920s there was a mandolin \\"craze\\" in which the instrument enjoyed new popularity.Kalamazoo Mandolin and Guitar Orchestra, History, About Mandolin OrchestrasSalvador L√©onardi, M√©thode pour Banjoline ou Mandoline-Banjo, Paris, 1921 The movement in France was enough to found a movement of French mandolin artists, including Gabriel Leone, Giovanni Fouchetti and Gervasio.

He performed with his family there, and their success was such that they performed Verdi's Othello in the Op√©ra Garnier. He also directed the Casino of Cannes orchestra, in the lounge of the Grand Duke of Mecklenburg. His work led him to be given credit for adding to the mandolin's successful rise as an orchestral instrument. He was also given the honor of having an orchestral work dedicated to him, the Enrico Marucelli work Valtzer Fantastico.Gezupftes, Enrico Marucelli ‚Äì Valtzer Fantastico und andere Kompositionen f√ºr Mandoline & Gitarre und Zupfquartett Discrepancy There is some confusion as to when Eduardo Mezzacapo died.

He served as the military commander (spahbed) of northern Iran. He later came in conflict with the Iranian nobility, \\"dividing the resources of the country\\".SASANIAN DYNASTY, A. Shapur Shahbazi, Encyclopaedia Iranica, (20 July 2005). He was later killed by Siyavakhsh in a palace plot on the orders of Azarmidokht after he proposed to her in an attempt to usurp the Sasanian throne. He had two children, Rostam Farrokhzad and Farrukhzad. Background Farrukh Hormizd was a member of the Ispahbudhan family, one of the seven Parthian clans. He was the son of Vinduyih, a descendant of Bawi, whose sister was the wife of Kavadh I and mother of Khosrau I. Farrukh's father and uncle, Vistahm, played an important role in defeating the Mihranid Bahram Chobin and restoring Khosrau II to the throne. Khosrau, however, had Vinduyih executed, which made Vistahm revolt against him. The rebellion of Vistahm lasted from 590/1‚Äì596 or 594/5‚Äì600, until he was betrayed by one of his own generals. After the death of Vistahm, Farrukh succeeded him as the spahbed of the north. Career During the late Byzantine‚ÄìSasanian War of 602‚Äì628, Farrukh Hormizd, and his son Rostam Farrokhzad, rebelled against Khosrau II, allowing the Byzantine emperor Heraclius to invade Atropatene, where he sacked several cities, including the Adur Gushnasp temple.Pourshariati (2008), pp. 152-153 In 628, the feudal families of Iran secretly mutinied against Khosrau and joined Shahrbaraz. Kavadh was then released by the feudal families of the Sasanian Empire, which included: The House of Ispahbudhan represented by Farrukh Hormizd himself, and his two sons Rostam Farrokhzad, and Farrukhzad. Shahrbaraz, who represented the Mihran family. The Armenian faction represented by Varaztirots II Bagratuni and finally the Kanarang.Pourshariati (2008), p. 173 On 25 February, Sheroe, along with his commander Aspad Gushnasp, captured Ctesiphon and imprisoned Khosrow II. He then proclaimed himself as shah of the Sasanian Empire and assumed the dynastic name of Kavad II. He proceeded to have all his brothers and half-brothers executed, including the heir Mardanshah, who was Khosrow's favourite son. The murder of all his brothers, \\"all well-educated, valiant, and chivalrous men\\", strapped the Sasanian dynasty of a future competent ruler, and has been described as a \\"mad rampage\\" and \\"reckless\\". Three days later he ordered Mihr Hormozd to execute his father. However, after the regicide of his father, Kavad also proceeded to have Mihr Hormozd killed. With the agreement of the Iranian nobles, he then made peace with the victorious emperor Heraclius, which allowed the Byzantines to (re)gain all their lost territories, their captured soldiers, a war indemnity, along with the True Cross and other relics that were lost in Jerusalem in 614. The fall of Khosrow II culminated in a civil war lasting four years, with the most powerful members of the nobility gaining full autonomy and starting to create their own government. The hostilities between the Persian (Parsig) and Parthian (Pahlav) noble-families were also resumed, which split up the wealth of the nation. A few months later, a devastating plague swept through the western Sasanian provinces, killing half of its population including Kavad II. He was succeeded by his eight year old son Ardashir III, who was killed two years later by the distinguished Iranian general Shahrbaraz, who was in turn murdered forty days later in a coup by Farrukh Hormizd, who helped Boran ascend the throne. When Boran ascended the throne, she appointed Farrukh Hormizd as the chief minister (wuzurg framadar) of the empire. She then attempted to bring stability to Iran by the implementation of justice, reconstruction of the infrastructure, lowering of taxes, and minting coins. Her rule was accepted by the nobility and clergy, which is apparent by her coin mints in the provinces of Pars, Khuzestan, Media, and Abarshahr. No opposition was voiced towards her gender. However, after some time she was deposed in 630, and Shapur-i Shahrvaraz, the son of Shahrbaraz and a sister of Khosrow II, was made shah of Iran. However, he was not recognized by the Parsig faction of the powerful general Piruz Khosrow. Shapur-i Shahrvaraz was thus deposed in favor of Azarmidokht, the sister of Boran.  Usurpation and death  Farrukh Hormizd, in order to strengthen his authority and create a modus vivendi between the Pahlav and Parsig, asked Azarmidokht (who was a Parsig nominee) to marry him. Azarmidokht, however, declined. After having his proposal declined, Farrukh Hormizd \\"no longer shied away from the throne itself\\", declaring \\"Today I am the leader of the people and the pillar of the country of Iran.\\" He started minting coins in the same fashion as a monarch, notably in Istakhr in Pars and Nahavand in Media. In order to deal with Farrukh Hormizd, Azarmidokht supposedly allied herself with Mihranid dynast Siyavakhsh, who was the grandson of Bahram Chobin, the famous military commander (spahbed) and briefly shah of Iran. With Siyavakhsh's aid, Azarmidokht had Farrukh Hormizd killed. Rostam Farrokhzad, who was at that time stationed in Khorasan, succeeded him as the leader of the Pahlav. In order to avenge his father, he left for Ctesiphon, \\"defeating every army of Azarmidokht that he met\\". He then defeated Siyavakhsh's forces at Ctesiphon and captured the city. Azarmidokht was shortly afterwards blinded and killed by Rostam, who restored Boran to the throne.

The son of Stan and Jan Berenstain, he continues the Berenstain Bears series of picture books that his parents inaugurated in 1962. Berenstain was born in Philadelphia. He studied at Philadelphia College of Art and the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. His earliest work in the U.S. Library of Congress catalog was published in 1976: K'tonton on an Island in the Sea by Sadie Rose Weilerstein, which he illustrated as Michael Berenstain (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America). The third K'tonton book, it features \\"Adventures of a thumb-sized Jewish boy who must fend for himself when stranded on an island.\\" During the next three years he wrote and illustrated four instructive picture books published by David McKay, The Castle Book and sequels on ships, armor, and lighthouses. He first collaborated with his parents by illustrating two picture books, The Day of the Dinosaur and After the Dinosaurs (Random House, 1987 and 1988), after which he did several dinosaur books (known as the I Love Dinosaurs book series) himself (including King of the Dinosaurs, The Biggest Dinosaurs, The Spike Tailed Dinosaur, The Horned Dinosaur, and Flying Dinosaurs). These five books are the five sequels to The Day of the Dinosaur (Mike Berenstain's parents's picture book). He is credited as a creator of his family's bear family beginning in 1995 as illustrator of the Bear Scouts subseries. Mike continued the Berenstain Bears with his mother following Stan's death in 2005, and took over sole authorship of the series after Jan's death in 2012. His older brother, Leo Berenstain is involved in management of the franchise. Berenstain's father was a secular Jew, and his mother was an Episcopalian.

Fine Jr. (born 1939) is an American historian and author. He is professor of Balkan and Byzantine history at the University of Michigan and has written several books on the subject. Early life and education He was born in 1939 and grew up in Princeton, New Jersey. His father, John Van Antwerp Fine Sr. (1903‚Äì87), was Professor of Greek History in the Classics Department of Princeton University. His mother, Elizabeth Bunting Fine, was also a classicist and taught Latin and Greek at Miss Fine‚Äôs School. Fine Jr.'s undergraduate and graduate training was at Harvard University, where he studied Byzantium, the Balkans, and medieval Russia. He earned his Ph.D. from Harvard in 1968 and began teaching at the University of Michigan in 1969. Career and academic interests Medievalist Paul Stephenson, lead professor at the School of History and Heritage, University of Lincoln, and a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society, expressed high regard for Fine's work and compared him with the likes of Paul M. Barford, Simon Franklin, Jonathan Shepard. His academic interests range from theology and the history of Christianity to Byzantium and the medieval and modern Balkans. His publications have become standard in the field, notably his surveys of the Medieval Balkans (1983 and 1987). He has also revolutionized the way scholars understand the Bosnian Church (first published in 1975; republished in England in 2006), showing that it was not heretical. In 2006, Fine published a study of notions of ethnicity in Croatia from the medieval period to the nineteenth century titled When Ethnicity Did Not Matter in the Balkans. In 2008, Emily Greble Baliƒá, gave positive review stating that \\"(o)ne of the book's great strengths is Fine's analysis of premodern \\"ethnic\\" identity\\". In 2009, John K. Cox of North Dakota State University reviewed it largely positively, noting some points of criticism. James P. Krokar review from 2009 was also positive, stating that the book is \\"extremely important\\" addition to \\"South Slavic history, and to the debate on the modernity of the nation.\\" The same year, Neven Budak of the University of Zagreb gave a negative review, stating that \\"Fine's book cannot in any way merit a positive review. It clearly shows how ideological prejudices affect history and science, burdened with prejudices and preconceived conclusions. Unfortunately, the book also diminishes the consequences of approaching a topic for which the author did not prepare methodologically, nor did he become acquainted with the relevant works of non- Croatian authors, of whom there are few. As a consequence, Fine's approach to the topic - contrary to stated intentions - is traditionalist in its method, superficial and unreliable. It would be commendable if the author, alert to all these shortcomings, especially his attitude towards Croats and his inappropriate methodology, found the strength to publicly restrain himself from this book.\\" =Studies on Bosnian history= Fine has also contributed to understanding of Bosnian history, working to correct popular misconceptions, especially during the Balkan wars of the 1990s. He co-authored Bosnia and Hercegovina: A Tradition Betrayed with former student Robert J. Donia (1994), a work published in England, the US, and in Bosnian translation in war-time Sarajevo (1995). He traveled to and lectured in the besieged cities of Sarajevo and Mostar during the war.

Daley to his first full-term. Daley had previously been elected to serve the remainder of Harold Washington's unexpired term in a special election held following Washington's death in office. Daley won by a landslide 44 point margin. His most significant opponent in general election was Harold Washington Party nominee R. Eugene Pincham. Other candidates were Republican candidate George Gottlieb and Socialist Workers Party nominee James Warren, both of whom performed poorly in the vote count.http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=6437 Nominations =Democratic primary= Daley handily won the Democratic nomination, fending off challenges from then-Cook County Commissioner Danny K. Davis and former mayor Jane M. Byrne. Daley announced on December 10, 1990 that he would seek reelection.https://www.lib.niu.edu/1991/ii910617.html The following day Daley held a fundraiser at the Hyatt Regency Chicago which raised more than a million dollars for his campaign. This, when added to his existing campaign funds, meant that by the third day of his candidacy he already had 2 million dollars in funding. Neither of his competitors could come anywhere remotely near him in fundraising. Daley, who won a special election in 1989, was the strong frontrunner for the Democratic nomination. A poll conducted by the Chicago Sun-Times in November 1990 showed that 58% of Chicagoan's had positive views of his performance as mayor. A Southtown Economist poll conducted after his campaign announcement showed him with a 61% approval rating, and also showed him to be polling at a 2 to 1 margin over his closest challenger, Danny Davis. Daley benefited from a variety of factors, including solid voting blocs supporting his candidacy, his strong managerial style as mayor, and lack of public interest in local politics amid the Gulf War, which assisted Daley's hopes to have a low-profile campaign.https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/28/us/daley-breaks-his-father-s- record-in-winning-primary-in-chicago.html Davis and Byrne hoped they would be able to debate Daley. Daley, however, declined to attend any debates. Davis had been selected as the \\"consensus\\" black candidate at a closed-door meeting held November 19, 1990 at the Hyde Park Hilton between 126 of Chicago's African-American leaders. They voted 66-60 to support Davis over Eugene Sawyer. While Davis had planned to campaign in all areas of the city, his funds were too limited to support a citywide campaign. Late in the primary, Tyrone Crider, the national executive director of Operation PUSH, characterized the Davis campaign as a \\"slow movement\\" because it had \\"failed to take the time necessary to meet and consult with the [black] religious and business community.\\" Both Crider and PUSH founder Jesse Jackson were upset with Davis having called a number of black ministers that had supported Daley, \\"Uncle Toms\\". Byrne's campaign was hampered by her inability to raise funds. Her campaign was considered to be rather weak, and received no support from any significant community or business leaders. Byrne declared that Chicago's, \\"deserved better leadership in City Hall\\". She attempted to provoke Daley into combatting with her, but he did not take her bait. In 1991, Byrne was regarded to be most comfortable when campaigning in the African-American community. Chicago Sun-Times writer Steve Neal referred to her as the Norma Desmond of Chicago politics, meaning that she was delusional in her belief that she could stage a comeback. Candidate Sheila A. Jones had also run in the previous two elections' Democratic primaries. She was a supporter of the LaRouche movement.https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1980&dat;=19910227&id;=Q2kiAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=EaoFAAAAIBAJ&pg;=1465,5337208 Black turnout was lower than it had been in the 1989 primary. Daley's share among black voters was higher than analysts had anticipated, with double-digit support. Due to the contest being overshadowed by the Gulf War, and due to voter apathy towards the election as a result of Daley's overwhelming lead in the polls, turnout was considered low, at under 48%.https://www.csmonitor.com/1991/0228/afil28.html This was believed to have been among the lowest turnouts in fifty years for a mayoral primary in Chicago. Daley set a new record for the largest margin of victory in a Democratic primary, surpassing the previous record (set by his father in 1975). Daley's performance in the primary was perceived as placing him an unbeatable position to win the general election, with Chicago being an overwhelmingly Democratic city, and the Democratic nomination being widely considered as tantamount to election. Even though he was likely to face a third-party African-American opponent, this was not seen as enough to prevent his victory (especially considering that, as a candidate, Davis had not been able to pose much of a challenge to Daley in the primary).

Totals  4,942  48.4%  2,961  29.0%  2,301  22.5%  10,204 } =Harold Washington Party primary= The Harold Washington Party held a primary. However its winner, James R. Hutchinson, withdrew, stepping aside for R. Eugene Pincham to assume the nomination. Hutchison was the vice- chairman of the Harold Washington Party. Danny K. Davis, selected last November by black leaders as a consensus African-American candidate to challenge Daley for mayor in the Democratic primary, was backed by the Harold Washington Party during the primary campaign. Hutchinson ran for mayor on the Harold Washington Party ticket as a write-in candidate to ensure the Harold Washington Party's place on the ballot in the general election. His strategy was to win enough write-in votes to secure the party nomination, but not enough votes to hurt Davis\` chances against Daley. Hutchinson stated before the Democratic primary that if Davis did not beat Daley, Hutchison would immediately withdraw from the Washington Party ticket to allow a stronger candidate to run in the general election with assurances from Davis that he would support such a candidate. After Davis lost to Daley, Hutchison kept his promise, stepped aside, and allowed Pincham to be the Harold Washington Party candidate for mayor.http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct- xpm-1991-03-04-9101200425-story.html Pincham was a former appellate judge who had left the Democratic Party after losing its 1990 nomination for Cook County Board President to Richard Phelan. =Socialist Workers nomination= The Socialist Workers Party nominated 1988 presidential candidate James Warren. General election Having no significant general election opponents, Daley's campaign activity was relatively minimal. He utilized strong field operations in the city's wards and distributed issue briefing papers. Daley declined to participate in any debates. =Results= Daley won by a large margin. Daley received roughly 25% of the African-American vote. Daley won a majority in 31 of the city's wards, with Pincham winning a majority in the remaining 19 wards. ;Results by ward { class=\\"wikitable collapsible collapsed sortable\\" - ! rowspan=2Ward !! colspan=2Richard M.

It was a former seat of the Earls of Shrewsbury. It is now a major theme park in the United Kingdom. The area around Alton Towers has been occupied for more than a thousand years. Beginning in the Middle Ages, the site has been redeveloped several times from fortified encampment to castle and then country house.  Early history  An Iron Age fort was built on Bunbury Hill (c. 1st century BC) which is now occupied by the Alton Towers estate. In about 700 AD, the Saxon king Ceolred of Mercia built a fortress on the hill. King Ine of Wessex besieged the site in 716 AD. The ensuing battle, which ended in stalemate, caused such a loss of life the place was called Slain Hollow (which later became the estate's oriental water garden). In the 11th century, Alton Castle was built soon after the Norman Conquest above the Churnet Valley, in the village of Alton, Staffordshire. It is about from the present-day Alton Towers. By the 12th century, the large manorial estate had been given to knight Bertram II de Verdun (died 1129/30), as a reward for his work in the Crusades. In 1318, the estate passed by marriage to Thomas de Furnival when he married Joan de Verdun. Furnival later died crusading in the Holy Land in 1348. In 1406, Sir John Talbot acquired the estate when he married Maud, the eldest daughter of Thomas de Furnivall, 3rd Baron Furnivall. Talbot became the second created Earl of Shrewsbury in 1442 after the title was forfeited by the third earl of the first creation in 1102. The Norman castle was destroyed during the English Civil War. In the 17th century, the former castle was redeveloped as a hunting lodge known as Alerton (or Alverton), which is the ancient name for Alton. The three-storey structure reused one of the castle's former towers, which remains part of the present- day building. The lodge was split into two properties, one of which was rented by a tenant. The other half was used by the Talbots as a summer residence, their main residence being at Heythrop Park in Oxfordshire. Stately home and gardens neo-gothic tower in the west wing of the house. Part of the restored water gardens at Alton Towers. In 1801, Charles Talbot, the 15th Earl of Shrewsbury, decided that Alton Castle was beyond repair so he decided to have work started on a Gothic-style stately home on his estate on the northside of the Churnet valley. Over the next ten years, architects such as Thomas Allason, William Hollins, and Thomas Hopper contributed to the building. Work included the addition of a drawing room, dining room, chapel, library, long gallery, banqueting hall, conservatory, and entrance hall. As a result, the building was doubled in size. It also included the laying of the foundations for the Flag Tower. The house was renamed Alton Abbey, despite having no particular religious connection. In 1814, Charles and his wife moved permanently into their new house at Alton. Work then began on turning the farmland around the house into one of the largest formal gardens in Britain. Several gardens were planted, including a Dutch garden and a rock garden. More than 13,000 trees were also planted in the landscaped parkland. The gardens in the valley leading down to the River Churnet hosted a variety of features. These included a Pagoda fountain which was fed by water from a spring at Ramshorn that passed through various lakes and pools, cast iron Garden Conservatories designed by Robert Abrahams, a \\"Swiss Cottage\\" that hosted a Welsh harpist and a copy of Lysicrates' Choragic Monument from Athens. After the 15th Earl of Shrewsbury died in 1827, he was succeeded by his nephew John Talbot, 16th Earl of Shrewsbury, who completed the gardens and house started by his uncle. In 1831, the Talbots' principal residence in Heythrop burned down. The 16th earl then came to live at Alton permanently, bringing everything that could be saved from Heythrop. Noted architect Augustus Pugin designed a new entrance hall, banqueting hall and various other rooms, extending the house further. The property was renamed Alton Towers. From 1839, the grounds were opened to the public at various times of the year. In 1852, following the death of the 16th Earl, Alton Towers was briefly inherited by his cousin, Bertram. But when he died four years later at the young age of 24, all work on the house ceased (no further alterations would again be made to the property). As there was no direct heir to the estate, Bertram left the earldom and Alton Towers to a younger son of the Duke of Norfolk. But this was contested by Henry Chetwynd-Talbot of Ingestre Hall, a distant cousin of the late earl, who filed a legal writ to determine lawful ownership of Alton Towers. As the contents of the house were not contested, everything within the house was auctioned off in a 29-day sale of 4,000 lots. In 1857, Henry Chetwynd-Talbot became the 18th Earl of Shrewsbury, and two years later he acquired the Alton Towers estate. In celebration, the earl held a procession through Staffordshire on 13 April 1860. Beginning in Uttoxeter, it stretched over a mile with up to 40,000 people in the grounds of Alton Towers at the end. The Chetwynd-Talbots main home was Ingestre Hall and they only lived at Alton Towers while Ingestre was being rebuilt following a fire. The 19th Earl opened the grounds to the public at certain times of the year to help raise money to refurbish parts of the house. During the 1890s, the 20th earl, Charles Talbot started the tradition of summer fetes at Alton. As well as the gardens, people were attracted with fireworks displays, balloon festivals, clowns, and exhibitions of instruments of torture. In 1896, the earl and countess separated. The earl went to live at Ingestre and the countess stayed at Alton. The house began to decay and the grounds became neglected because the earl did not pay for upkeep. The 20th earl was a very active businessman who is now best known for founding the manufacturer of Talbot cars in 1902. In November 1918, the earl decided to sell off the majority of the estate by auction. The countess continued to live on the estate for another two years after the earl died in 1921. =Public ownership= In 1924, the remaining part of the estate and house was sold to a group of local businessmen, who formed Alton Towers Limited. Although the contents of the house were sold off, the grounds were restored and remained open to the public. Parts of the house were converted into caf√©s and toilets for public use. During World War II, Alton Towers was requisitioned by the War Office as an officer training unit. The gardens remained closed to the public until 1951. It is a common misconception that military occupation of the towers caused a lot of damage to the building. However, this is not the case, as much of the building was already boarded up and unused. It is now commonly understood that the decay was caused in the inter-war period by the Bagshaw family ‚Äì the majority shareholders ‚Äì who sold the wood and plaster fixtures from the house's interiors as well as the lead roofing, allowing water to rot the building's remaining fittings. The house was left a denuded shell. Theme park Alton Towers is now a major part of the theme park. In the 1950s, parts of the grounds were partially reopened to the public by the Alton Towers Limited company. A 2 foot gauge miniature railway was opened in the grounds (closed 1997). Four years later, an indoor model railway, which had taken nearly three years to build, was opened in the chapel entrance. Up to of track encompassed a circuit covering more than ; the model also used about 100 gallons of water for its river and lake features. Visitors were required to pay a separate admission charge to view the attraction. The railway had 35 locomotives which hauled more than 200 items of rolling stock. During its history, the layout featured various trains representing examples from British railways, Italian electric trains with pantographs and Canadian Pacific Railways. Marketing literature often claimed the model layout was \\"the largest of its kind in the world\\". In 1993, the chapel was restored and the railway was removed and sold at auction. During the 1960s and 1970s, the grounds were redeveloped as a visitor attraction. There was a boating lake, a chairlift, and a small fair behind the ruins of the main house. Concrete floors were installed in Alton Towers house so that it could be opened to the public. The building was listed as Grade II. After millionaire property developer John Broome married the daughter of majority shareholder Denis Bagshaw in 1973, he bought out the controlling stake in Alton Towers. Over the next few years, he laid the foundation for the modern theme park by installing various permanent rides and developing areas of the grounds in progressive stages. In 1978, the newly restored sunken gardens featured in a series of 30-second TV commercials for Accurist starring John Cleese.Accurist Adverts on Youtube Alton Towers began its evolution into a major theme park in 1980 with the installation of The Corkscrew rollercoaster, the Pirate Ship, and the Alpine Bob sled ride. In 1981, Talbot Street, the park's first permanent themed area, was opened on the site of the old fairground behind the Towers, as well as the Log Flume constructed near to the boating lake. In 1984, the park's second roller- coaster, The Black Hole, arrived. Throughout the next decade, more attractions, areas and rides were added to Alton Towers. In 1990, the park was purchased by The Tussauds Group. The change of ownership heralded an era of intense development, with a range of large attractions and new areas being built at the park, including the dark rides The Haunted House (1992) and Toyland Tours (1994), thrill rides such as Nemesis (1994), a hotel complex in 1996, Oblivion (1998), and Air (now known as Galactica) (2002). In 2005, Alton Towers was acquired by the investment group Dubai International Capital (DIC) when it purchased Tussauds for ¬£800 million. The Tussauds Group was bought by Merlin Entertainments in March 2007 for over ¬£1 billion from DIC, placing Alton Towers under their control. In July 2007, the resort and park was sold to Nick Leslau and his investment firm Prestbury, who now lease the park back to Merlin Entertainments to operate on a 35-year lease.

Population: .  History  2001 census The oldest traces of human existence in the Onufriivka Raion date back to the Neolithic era. Onufriivka was founded at the beginning of the 17th century by the Zaporozhian retired Cossack Onufriyenko, on whose behalf the settlement name came. During the liberation war of the Ukrainian people in 1648-1654, there was a large settlement already here, the inhabitants of which took part in the Bohdan Khmelnytsky campaigns. The population of Onufriivka grew at the expense of peasants - refugees from Volhynia, Galicia, Bessarabia, who were attracted by large tracts of virgin steppe, forests, rivers and magnificent meadows. The locals were mainly engaged in animal husbandry, farming was less developed. Every autumn, large fairs were held here, which were attended by Kremenchuk and Kyiv merchants. In 1752, with the establishment of military settlements, Onufriivka became part of New Serbia and became the property of Jovan Horvat-Otkurtich, and in the 1770s the descendants of Horvat-Otkurtych sold Onufriivka to Mikhail Kamburley, who was an adviser, senator, and civilian governor of Volhynia. In the winter of 1805, the landowner Ivan Kamburley relocated part of the serf peasants from his estates in the Orel and Tambov governorates. He later won ten families in cards from a landowner from Kurtina, and exchanged other serfs with a prince for a purebred dog. He placed these settlers on his lands, founding the villages of Kamburliivka (in honor of his surname) and Zybkove. Until now, these villages, inhabited by Russian descendants, are mostly Russian-speaking. The village of Vyshnivtsi (formerly Ivanivka) was founded in 1777. Landlord M. Kamburley in the winter house of the Zaporozhian sergeant Kholodiy, bought captured Tatar Petro Sagaidysh for 30 silver rubles, baptized him, married with a Ukrainian woman and settled on the farm. In 1792, several families from Poland settled near the farm on the Kamburley orders. This is how the village arose, which the landowner named Ivanivka in honor of his father. From 1821, after the Mikhail Kamburley's death, all his property passed into the possesion of Count Mikhail Tolstoy, who was married to Kamburley's daughter Ekaterina. Count Tolstoy inherited the villages of Onufriivka, Kamburliivka, Lozuvatka, and Ivanivka, that is, 13,000 acres of land. The Count Tolstoy family is rich and ancient, as evidenced by the coat of arms of the family with the With Devotion and Diligence motto. As of 1886, the town, the center of Onufrievka Volost of Aleksandriysky Uyezd of Kherson Governorate, had 1414 people, 254 farmsteads, an Orthodox church, a school, 5 shops, and 3 fairs a year: Seredopisny, Mykilsky on 9 May and Pokrovsky. Mikhail Tolstoy was a large landowner and introduced advanced methods of management on their lands, used a perfect machinery at that time, iron plows, horse threshers and fans. There was even a Fordzon tractor. Horses of the Orden breed were bred on farms, which were in demand in Russia and abroad. Rambouillet sheep (8,000 heads), gray-Ukrainian cows (600 heads), and sheep wool were sent to Bia≈Çystok and ≈Å√≥dz cloth factories. Own brick factory was operating at full capacity, all the buildings on the estate were built of own bricks, which were of high quality, in particular in 1911 a school was built at the expense of Counts Tolstoy (M. Tolstoy and his mother O. Tolstaya), in which children still study, and the premises of which are marked by an attractive appearance and internal thoughtfulness and beauty. A hospital and a school were also built in the village of Pavlysh. Parish administration, veterinary hospital, priest's house, zemstvo administration were built in Onufriivka. Well-known Ukrainian teacher Vasyl Sukhomlynsky after graduating from September 1939 to June 1941 worked as a teacher of Ukrainian language and literature at Onufriivka Secondary School. In 1968, Onufriivka received an urban-type settlement status.

Onufriivka Dendropark, September 2015  Sights  = Dendropark = The Onufriivka Dendropark foundation is connected with the family of Count Tolstoy. One of the students of the famous Russian scientist Dokuchaev supervised the works on the park foundation. All work was performed by the hands of ordinary serfs of Count Tolstoy. The old park dates back to the 1820s, and the new one, south of the Omelnychok River, was planted half a century later. The area of the park is 84 hectares, of which 22 hectares are occupied by water mirror ponds. On its territory there were more than 100 species of trees and shrubs, original gazebos, bridges, small architectural forms, a bulk island with a gazebo and a swimming pool, near the house there were two pools with fountains, a rosary. The alleys of the park were placed according to the classic English model. Peasants were strictly forbidden to enter the lord's park. Only workers cleared the alleys, tended the trees and numerous flower beds, and swans in the park ponds. Later, the peasants were allowed to take water for their needs from one of the ponds. He still kept his name - Peasant pond. The whole park was surrounded by a two-meter brick fence with a decorative lattice. In 1960, the Council of Ministers of the Ukrainian SSR adopted a resolution according to which the Onufriivka Dendropark was recognized as the 19th century landscape architecture monument.

The counts owned 13,000 acres of land and surrounding villages. All of them were engaged in charitable activities and patronage, introduced advanced technologies in agriculture. The foundation of the Onufriivka Dendropark is associated with the name of Mykhail Tolstoy. Mikhail (senior) developed the estate. Mikhail Mykhailovych (junior) built a school in Onufriivka and Pavlysh, a hospital in Pavlysh, a veterinary hospital in Onufriivka, and other social facilities at his own expense; completed the construction of the Onufriivka Dendropark. Counts Tolstoy were prominent philanthropists and patrons of his time. An ambulance station was built in Odesa at the expense of Mykhailo Mykhailovych. Each of the counts was the schools for children from poor families trustees. The counts made a huge contribution to the development of agriculture and viticulture in southern Russia. After the October Revolution, the life of the last Count Tolstoy was tragic. Deprived of all his property, the seriously ill Mikhail Tolstoy and his mother, Elena, left for Geneva. That's where his life ended (30 August 1927). With his death, one of the branches of the glorious Tolstoy family broke off.

It was Cutler's fifth studio album but his first released by R&S; Records in 2012. The album was recorded between October 2010 and November 2011, and was his first album he made where he found himself making music as a profession opposed to as a hobby. The album's sound is a move away from the more house music oriented sounds of his previous albums and towards a sound more influenced by early 1990s rave music. The album was the first of Lone's to feature guest vocalists. Galaxy Garden was released on 1 May 2012. A single \\"Crystal Caverns 1991\\" was released to promote the album. It received favourable reviews on its release with the BBC, Mixmag and Pitchfork referring to the album as Lone's strongest release. Production Galaxy Garden was recorded between October 2010 and November 2011 in Manchester. It was his third full-length studio album. Galaxy Garden was first album that was not done as a side-hobby for Cutler, but as a full-time career as a musician which made it difficult for him to get motivated. Cutler stated that he was \\"making lots of house-y, kind of 4/4 tunes, and I just got really bored of doing that, but at the same time I didn't have a clue what I was going to do next. I was a few months into this weird spell, and I started to worry\\". Cutler began working on a track that would become \\"New Colour\\" and became inspired by it to take the album in that direction. Cutler spent the rest of the year making new songs with \\"New Colour\\" being the jumping point. The album features vocals from Machinedrum and Anneka. This was the first album of Lone's to use original recorded vocals rather than sampled vocal pieces. Composition Galaxy Garden follows a style different from his 2011 EP Echolations (2011), which was house oriented. Unlike previous albums which contained musical references to house and hip hop music, Galaxy Garden was meant to be \\"reference free\\" with Cutler stating he was \\"influenced by nothing\\". The album's sound has been compared to rave music, Dummy described the sounds of the album as a \\"personal interpretation of these familiar [rave] sounds, colours and symbols in a more modern and allusive way.\\" Release Galaxy Garden was released on vinyl and compact disc by R&S; Records on 1 May 2012. The first single from the album was \\"Crystal Caverns 1991\\". Cutler has stated that the songs that didn't make it onto the album were not going to be included on future releases. Reception Initial critical response to Galaxy Garden was positive. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 77, based on 15 reviews. BBC Music deemed Galaxy Garden to be Lone's best album, adding that it \\"stands proudly beside sets from Slugabed, Actress and John Talabot as one of \\"dance\\"-in-2012's very best albums.\\" Mixmag referred to the album as \\"easily his most defining moment to date\\" and wrote that \\"it's the smart weaves in and out of expectation ‚Äì the jolts, the swerves ‚Äì that make it an instant classic.\\" Online music zine Pitchfork shared these views as well, referring to it as \\"his most complete statement yet\\". Drowned in Sound opined that Lone was \\"delivering the music he always promised\\" and felt that the \\"only snag with Galaxy Gardens flow is it can feel too fidgety, with literally everything thrown into the mix\\". Fact wrote that it was \\"certainly dividing existing Lone fans\\" as compared to previous albums, noting that \\"there are only fleeting moments of reference to Lone's previous preoccupations in classic house and hip-hop\\".

Location El Kansera is the oldest irrigation storage dam in Morocco. It is northwest of Meknes and about south of Sidi Slimane, upstream from Dar bel Amri. The dam impounds the Oued Beht (or Beth), the last major tributary of the Sebou River before its mouth. The watershed that supplies the dam has an area of . The climate is temperate, and average annual rainfall is . The site of the dam was a deep, narrow gorge that the Beth had cut through the limestone bordering on the lowlands. Winter floods of the Beth had created large merdjas on the Sebou's left bank, which would be ideal for cultivation once irrigation water was available. Construction At first the colonial agriculture and public works administrations opposed construction of this and other dams, but the main settlers, led by Gaston Lebault, pushed the project forward. When governor- general Th√©odore Steeg arrived in 1925, known as the \\"water governor\\", the pace accelerated. El Kansera was built between 1927 and 1935. In 1928 Steeg's administration created a new colonization zone (\\"perimeter\\") located between Petitjean and Sidi Slimane. The land was taken from the Cherardas, who were moved to less productive areas. The new perimeter was sited where water from the dam could be used in irrigation. The main construction work was undertaken between 1931 and 1934. The dam was built by Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale d'Enterprises, a French company. Fran√ßois de Pierrefeu was the prime contractor. Henri Prost (1874-1959) was the architect for the power station, which was completed in 1934. The dam was high, with a storage capacity of . It would control flooding of the Beht and irrigate of fertile land in the Rharb plain. The hydroelectric plant at the base would generate 13 million KWh annually. The concrete structure was built on calcareous marl, which caused great difficulty in construction. Later development The government did not plan ahead for the way the irrigation water would be used. World War II (1939-1945) caused further delays in development. As of 1953 only of land was in fact being irrigated since the distribution system was still incomplete. This lack of planning is a serious problem in a region where silting imposes a finite lifespan on any storage dam. The irrigated region was almost entirely in the hands of the colonists. By 1969 were being irrigated. The dam was raised by in 1968, which increased the volume of the reservoir to . This compensated for silting, improved flood control, increased the irrigated area by and allowed for an increase in electricity production to 33 million kWh annually. The job was complicated by the difficulty of conducting deep excavation near the foundation and problems with making the new concrete bond to the old. The design included addition of 77 steel cables under a tension of 240 tonnes each. Soon after completion, in February 1969 it withstood a major flood and a simultaneous earthquake.

Background Four physicians who provided abortion services in Illinois filed a class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois to challenge a 1979 amendment to the Illinois Abortion Law of 1975 which required doctors to provide a \\"parental consultation\\" before performing an abortion. This regulation added to the Illinois Abortion Parental Consent Act of 1977, which required written consent from both parents or the guardian of an unmarried minor before obtaining an abortion and imposed a 48-hour waiting period. If parental consent could not be obtained or was refused, the minor could seek court-authorized consent upon showing that \\"the pregnant minor fully understands the consequences of an abortion to her and her unborn child.\\" Notice of the hearing was required to be sent to the parents by registered or certified mail.

The first campaign was in response to Minyue's invasion of Eastern Ou in 138 BC. In 135 BC, a second campaign was sent to intervene in a war between Minyue and Nanyue. After the campaign, Minyue was partitioned into Minyue, ruled by a Han proxy king, and Dongyue. Dongyue was defeated in a third military campaign in 111 BC and the former Minyue territory was annexed by the Han Empire. Background The Han dynasty in 87 BC. The Qin dynasty's military incursions in the south of what is now China began a period of expansion that continued under the next dynasty, the Han. After the fall of the Qin, Minyue was established in 202 BC, and Eastern Ou in 192 BC, with the support of the Han. They were rewarded with greater autonomy in return for their contributions to the revolt against the Qin. The local rulers of the Minyue region had also sided with Liu Bang's Han instead of Xiang Yu's Chu during the Chu‚ÄìHan Contention, a civil war that ensued during the collapse of the Qin. Minyue was created by carving out the former Qin province of Minzhong, with Dongye as the capital, into a new kingdom ruled by Zou Wuzhu. A decade later, Zou Yao was granted control over Donghai, popularly referred to as Eastern Ou after the name of the kingdom's capital. The title was bestowed with a declaration by the Han emperor that \\"Zou Yan, the chief of Min, achieved great merit and his people supported the Han cause\\". The Han historian Sima Qian claims both rulers were descendants of Goujian, the 5th century BC ruler of Yue. The family had lost their status as rulers during the Qin's wars of unification, when they were demoted to local chieftains. Han‚ÄìMinyue wars =Initial military intervention= Eastern Han dynasty (25-220 AD), located in Zhengzhou, Henan province, China In 138 BC, Minyue invaded the Eastern Ou, prompting Eastern Ou to request the intervention of Han forces. The Han court was divided over offering military support. The campaign was opposed by the Han commander-in-chief Tian Fen, who argued that warfare between the Yue tribes occurred frequently and the affairs of Yue were not the responsibility of the Han government. The concept of Chinese centrality among nations persuaded the court to dispatch an army. In accordance with Chinese political philosophy, the ruler or Son of Heaven held a mandate that obligated the emperor to help smaller countries in need. Otherwise, as the Han official Zhuang Zhu phrased it, \\"how could we treat the myriad kingdoms as our children?\\" A Han naval force led by Zhuang Zhu departed from Shaoxing in northern Zhejiang towards Minyue. The Minyue surrendered before the arrival of the Han troops, and withdrew from Eastern Ou. There were plans to move the residents of Eastern Ou to the area between the Huai River and Yangtze River, following a request by the king of Eastern Ou. =Second intervention= Emperor Wu of the Han went to war with the Minyue. In 135 BC, war broke out when Minyue invaded Nanyue. Zhao Mo, the king of Nanyue, asked for and received the military assistance of the Han. In 180 BC, Zhao had offered to submit as a vassal and the Han agreed, a decision that was partly based on Zhao's ancestral roots in northern China. An army led by the generals Wang Hui and Han Anguo was ordered to invade Minyue. The campaign was cut short by palace infighting in the Minyue court. Panicked at news of an invasion, the younger brother of the Minyue king Zou Ying, Zou Yushan, conspired with the royal court to depose Ying. Yushan killed his brother with a spear, decapitated the corpse, and sent the head to Wang. The Han forces withdrew soon after. Zhao Mo was grateful for the speed of the intervention against Minyue. The Han official Zhuang Zhu was dispatched to meet with the Nanyue emperor, who expressed his gratitude. Zhao sent his son, the prince Zhao Yingqi, to the Han capital at Chang'an, where he was to work for the Emperor. In the aftermath of the campaign, Minyue had split into a dual monarchy, Minyue and Dongyue. Minyue was controlled by the Han through a proxy ruler, while Dongyue was independently ruled by Zou Yushan, the brother who deposed the former king during the invasion. Zou Chou was selected to fill the role of Han proxy ruler because he was the only member of the Minyue royal family who refused to take part in the war against Nanyue. However, his efforts to exert control over the people of Minyue were not successful. The subjects of the kingdom pledged their loyalty to Zou Yushan instead. Yushan declared himself king of Minyue without the consent of the Emperor Wu, the Han ruler. The emperor was informed of Yushan's actions, and recognized him as king of Dongyue instead of ordering a second invasion. Emperor Wu considered it a reward to Yushan for killing Zou Ying and ending the war. The assassination had prevented the Han from wasting any more resources on the conflict. Dongyue had an uneasy relationship with the Han. In 112 BC, Han officials were killed in a military engagement with Dongyue. =Third campaign and conquest= Western-Han miniature pottery infantry (foreground) and cavalry (background); in 1990, when the tomb complex of Emperor Jing of Han (r. 157 ‚Äì 141 BC) and his wife Empress Wang Zhi (d. 126 BC) was excavated north of Yangling, over 40,000 miniature pottery figures were unearthed. All of them were one-third life size, smaller than the 8,000-some fully life size soldiers of the Terracotta Army buried alongside the First Emperor of Qin. Smaller miniature figurines, on average 60 centimeters (24 in) in height, have also been found in various royal Han tombs where they were placed to guard the deceased tomb occupants in their afterlife.Paludan, Ann. (1998). Chronicle of the Chinese Emperors: the Reign-by-Reign Record of the Rulers of Imperial China. London: Thames & Hudson Ltd., pp 34-36, . As Han troops returned from the Han‚ÄìNanyue War in 111 BC, the Han government debated annexing Dongyue. Dongyue, under King Zou Yushan, had agreed to assist the Han campaign against Nanyue, but the Dongyue army never reached Nanyue. Yushan blamed the delay on the weather. The proposal to annex Dongyue was suggested by General Yang Pu, but was dismissed by Emperor Wu. The naval force arrived home without having attacked Dongyue. Zou caught wind of Yang's request, and responded by revolting against the Han. Han forces were led by General Han Yue, General Yang Pu, commander Wang Wenshu, and two marquises of Yue ancestry. The army crushed the rebellion and captured Dongyue in the last months of 111 BC, placing the former Minyue territory under Han rule. Historical records report that Minyue and Dongyue were emptied of people, and that its residents were deported to the territories between the Huai River and the Yangtze River. The alleged population transfer was a resumption of a policy that had been planned since 138 BC. The Han government considered the mountainous region difficult to control and was wary of trusting its residents. Modern historians doubt the event happened. The deportation of an entire kingdom is implausible, and nothing has been found to verify a migration of Han settlers to the Minyue region around the year 1, something that would have occurred had the area been abandoned while under Han control. There was only one town of Han settlers, Dongyue, in Minyue. Dongyue was built where the Min River meets the sea, around the time of Emperor Wu's reign. It is more likely that the assimilation of Minyue into Han Chinese culture through Han conquest happened later in the dynasty. Historical significance From one settlement in year 1, the Han Dynasty's involvement in the Minyue region grew into several counties. There were many Chinese counties in the area by the 4th century AD. The Minyue had been culturally assimilated by the time the Han Dynasty collapsed, and Chinese civilization was undergoing a transition to the Three Kingdoms period of Cao Wei, Shu Han, and Eastern Wu. Political upheaval in the north, such as Wang Mang's usurpation, had caused Han migrants to resettle in the south. The Han Dynasty's military expansion widened its commercial ties in addition acquiring large amounts of new territories. The empire's conquest of Minyue and Nanyue spoke of its vast size that it bordered the ancient kingdoms of Southeast Asia. Economic ties with the Han and subsequent dynasties affected the trajectory of maritime trade of Southeast Asia, where goods have been excavated made in styles resembling that of the ancient Han Chinese. Maritime trade and the Silk Road also linked China with Ancient Rome, India, and the Near East.

The network is headquartered in San Diego, California, and operates news bureaus in Washington, D.C. and New York City. Its prime time political talk shows have a conservative perspective, and the channel has described itself as one of the \\"greatest supporters\\" of President Donald Trump. Trump himself has promoted the network. The channel is prominent for promoting falsehoods and conspiracy theories.  History  OANN was announced on March 14, 2013, by Herring Networks, Inc., a family-owned national video programming company, which also owns sister channel AWE. The OAN channel originally debuted in partnership with The Washington Times, which had drawn criticism for racist content, including commentary and conspiracy theories about former U.S. President Barack Obama, supporting neo-Confederate historical revisionism, and promoting Islamophobia. On television, the network predominantly uses the acronym \\"OAN\\", whereas on Twitter it is more frequently known as \\"OANN\\". The network's web URL domain is at \\"OANN.com\\", but the site banner reads \\"OAN\\". OAN President Charles Herring told the Conservative Political Action Conference that \\"Fox News has done a great job serving the center-right and independent audiences\\", but that the audience's alternative news sources lacked. Herring also emphasized the network's separation of news from opinion content. He said that straight news would be reported throughout the day, with limited opinion and commentary on evening talk shows, including The Daily Ledger, hosted by Graham Ledger, and The Tipping Point, hosted by Liz Wheeler. In July 2014, OAN relocated its news and production studios, moving from The Washington Times building to a new location at 101 Constitution Avenue NW, near the United States Capitol. This marked the end of OAN's relationship with The Washington Times, which had provided news and analysis. In June 2019, OANN said that it reached 35 million homes. Its website lists availability via DIRECTV, Verizon Fios, AT&T; U-verse, Prism TV, and other distributors. At the time, OAN had approximately 150 staff. At the beginning of 2020, it was reported that Trump allies were looking into purchasing OANN.  Programming  In August 2014, OAN launched the show On Point with Tomi Lahren. Many clips from the program went viral, and by 2015, Lahren had gained widespread attention for her commentaries. On August 19, 2015, Lahren aired her final show at OAN. On the week of August 24, former Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin guest hosted a program on the network. In 2019, the channel aired the Canadian television film Claws of the Red Dragon, which had signed Steve Bannon as its American distributor.  Content  OAN is known for its pro-Trump content, promotion of conspiracy theories, and criticisms of the mainstream media. OANN has described itself as one of the \\"greatest supporters\\" of Trump. = Pro- Trump content = OAN is pro-Trump. The father of Charles Herring, Robert Herring Sr., founder and CEO of the network, has ordered producers to promote pro-Trump stories, anti-Clinton stories, and anti-abortion stories, and to minimize stories about Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Herring prohibited the network from running stories about polls which did not show Trump in the lead during the 2016 election. During the 2016 presidential campaign, the channel ran a special titled Betrayal at Benghazi: The Cost of Hillary Clinton‚Äôs Dereliction and Greed. Herring, the owner of the channel, sent his producers a report that falsely claimed that Hillary Clinton had a brain tumor, and asked them to check up on it. He also shared a report with producers claiming that Planned Parenthood had promoted abortion, and ordered them to minimize coverage of Pope Francis's US visit, due to the Pope's calls for action on global warming (see Laudato si'). Herring also repeatedly ordered his producers not to cover stories pertaining to Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. According to former and current employees at the channel, as well as internal e-mails, by July 2017 the executives of the channel had directed the channel to \\"scuttle stories about police shootings, encourage antiabortion stories, minimize coverage of Russian aggression, and steer away from the new president‚Äôs troubles.\\" In October 2017, the channel claimed without evidence that a \\"report\\" had been published which showed \\"U.K. Crime Rises 13% Annually Amid Spread of Radical Islamic Terror\\". President Trump later repeated this falsehood, suggesting that he learned of it from OAN. In June 2017, OAN was granted a permanent seat in the White House's James Brady briefing room. The network's Chief White House Correspondent, Trey Yingst, was one of the top five most called-upon reporters covering the Trump administration. President Trump has been repeatedly called for questions from OAN during press conferences, including in February 2017 when Yingst asked the President about his campaign's contacts with the Russian government. Also in February 2017, OAN was invited to a network lunch with President Trump. In August 2017, President Trump praised OAN, saying: \\"It's a great network\\". In response, OAN CEO Robert Herring said that OAN considers itself a tough but fair presence in the White House press corps. OAN supported the Trump administration's revoking of CNN reporter Jim Acosta's press credentials; most major media outlets, including the conservative Fox News, opposed this decision. In a statement, Robert Herring attacked Fox News, saying he \\"can't believe Fox is on the other side.\\" On January 12, 2020, an OANN broadcast promoted debunked conspiracy theories alleging illegal wiretapping of Donald Trump. OAN broadcasts uninterrupted every speech delivered by President Trump. In August 2020, OANN tweeted a promotion for a television segment entitled \\"America Under Siege: The Attempt to Overthrow President Trump.‚Äù The tweet asserted that ongoing demonstrations in the aftermath of the George Floyd killing constituted a \\"coup attempt\\" that was \\"led by a well funded network of anarchists trying to take down the President.\\" Trump retweeted the message. = Murder of Seth Rich conspiracy theories = OANN promoted conspiracy theories about the murder of Seth Rich. = Roy Moore sexual misconduct report controversy = After The Washington Post reported allegations that Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore had made unwanted sexual advances toward teenagers when he was in his thirties, OAN \\"became a source of both positive coverage and stories that could cast doubt on his accusers.\\" In November 2017, OAN aired a segment citing a false rumor by an anonymous Twitter account that The Washington Post had offered $1,000 to Roy Moore's accusers. OAN described the tweet as a \\"report\\" and described the tweeter as a \\"former Secret Service agent and Navy veteran\\". The Twitter source had a history of tweeting falsehoods and conspiracy theories; the Twitter account had also made repeated and inconsistent lies about its identity, including appropriating the identity of a Navy serviceman who died in 2007. After it was revealed that the story was a hoax, OAN did not retract its report. During his Senate campaign, Roy Moore cited OAN when he defended himself against the accusations, including an OAN story that alleged his \\"Accusers Have Ties to Drug Dealers & Washington Post\\". During the night of the Alabama Senate election, OANN announced Moore had swept the election \\"by a large margin\\" when, in actuality, Moore had lost the race. In its announcement, the network cited \\"unofficial polling\\", and the news anchor extended OAN CEO Robert Herring's congratulations to Moore on having run a \\"fine campaign.\\" OAN's website also published an erroneous article claiming Moore had won \\"despite attacks from Democrats about unverified allegations.\\" During election night, OAN also reported \\"a number of people have been caught trying to sneak into voting booths and vote illegally\\"; however, Alabama Secretary of State's office said it had no credible reports of voter fraud. = Conspiracy theory about David Hogg = In February 2018, one of the hosts on OAN tweeted a conspiracy theory that a 17-year-old survivor in the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, David Hogg, had been coached to speak against Trump by, and was \\"running cover\\" for, his retired FBI agent father. Donald Trump Jr. \\"liked\\" the OAN host's tweet. The younger Hogg responded, describing the conspiracy theory to Buzzfeed News as \\"immature, rude, and inhuman.\\" = Syria chemical attack = In April 2018, while on an al-Assad regime-led tour of the area of the Douma chemical attack, an OAN correspondent claimed there was no evidence that a chemical attack had occurred. The correspondent said, \\"Not one of the people that I spoke to in that neighborhood said that they had seen anything or heard anything about a chemical attack on that day\\" and that residents \\"loved Bashar al-Assad.\\" In May 2019, OAN published a report claiming the White Helmets had admitted to staging fake chemical weapons attacks, which were intended to put blame on the Assad regime. OAN referred to the humanitarian organization, which is partly funded by the US State Department, as \\"terrorist-linked\\". The Daily Beast characterized this story as a \\"smear\\" that could be traced directly as Russian disinformation. = Conspiracy theorist reporter Jack Posobiec = Since 2018, far-right conspiracy theorist Jack Posobiec has been employed by OANN as a political correspondent. Posobiec was a prominent proponent of the Pizzagate conspiracy theory and of the murder of Seth Rich conspiracy theory. In 2020, during the George Floyd protests in Buffalo, New York, Posobiec falsely reported and promoted another unsubstantiated conspiracy theory regarding pipe bombs. = False story about Bible ban = In April 2018, OAN ran a segment falsely claiming that a California bill would ban the sale of Bibles. Within 24 hours, the OAN video was viewed 2.4 million times on Facebook. Snopes determined that this claim was a misrepresentation; the bill actually targeted gay conversion therapy. = Unsubstantiated claims about Ammar Campa-Najjar = During the mid-term campaign for the November 2018 U.S. elections, OAN ran a segment claiming that Democratic congressional candidate Ammar Campa-Najjar's \\"father praised the deaths of the Israelis, saying they deserved to die.\\" The Washington Post fact-checker noted that there is no attribution to this statement in the OAN segment. An OANN commentator also claimed that groups connected to the Muslim Brotherhood donated to Campa-Najjar's campaign and that the FEC website showed this.The Washington Post fact-checker said it \\"couldn‚Äôt find evidence of this after searching Campa-Najjar‚Äôs filings with the Federal Election Commission.\\" Nevertheless, the OAN segment was used in attack ads by Campa-Najjar's Republican opponent Duncan Hunter to support the false suggestion that Campa-Najjar was tied to terrorism. = Interview subject with a fake name = In July 2019, the network interviewed pro-Trump activist Logan Cook, known online as Carpe Donktum, about allegations of anti- conservative bias on Reddit. OANN identified the man as Dennis F. Charles and said he was a \\"a conservative social media analyst.\\" OANN did not disclose that Cook was using a pseudonym. = Russia = OAN is known for downplaying threats posed to the United States by Russia. According to a former OAN producer, on his first day at OAN he was told, \\"Yeah, we like Russia here.\\" One of OAN's reporters, Kristian Brunovich Rouz, simultaneously works for the Russian propaganda outlet and news agency Sputnik, which is state-owned; when Rouz runs favorable segments on OAN that relate to Russia, OAN does not disclose that he also works for Sputnik. In September 2019, OAN parent Herring Networks filed suit in federal court in San Diego, California, against MSNBC host Rachel Maddow for $10 million after Maddow said the network \\"literally [is] paid Russian propaganda\\" on her July 22, 2019 program. Maddow had referenced a Daily Beast story identifying Rouz as also working for Sputnik. Also named in the suit were Comcast, MSNBC and NBCUniversal Media. A hearing on a motion to strike brought by Maddow was originally scheduled for March 2020, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the arguments were moved to May 2020 by Judge Cynthia Bashant. The judge dismissed the lawsuit, finding the claim was not defamation, but that a \\"reasonable viewer\\" would recognize it as a reasonable summation of the article published by The Daily Beast. OAN responded by saying it would appeal the decision. = George Soros false claims = OANN has run stories falsely claiming that George Soros, a Jewish- Hungarian philanthropist, collaborated with the Nazis when he was a 14-year- old. The network has also accused Soros of funding migrant caravans to the United States. During a report from Ukraine with Rudy Giuliani, in December 2019, OANN correspondent Chanel Rion claimed without evidence that Soros had shown up at the Kyiv airport with \\"human Dobermans in little black Mercedes\\" to find them. The claim was ridiculed in Ukrainian and American media. Soros was not known to have visited Ukraine since 2016. Giuliani has promoted conspiracy theories related to the Trump‚ÄìUkraine scandal on OANN. = Coronavirus outbreak conspiracy theories = In March 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the OANN chief White House correspondent Chanel Rion promoted a conspiracy theory that the virus originated in a North Carolina lab, citing information from a \\"citizen investigator and a monitored source amongst a certain set of the DC intelligence community\\" who was actually a Twitter conspiracy theorist. As she described this individual during a televised report from the White House grounds, an image was displayed of actor Keir Dullea in the film 2001: A Space Odyssey. She also asserted that Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading expert on infectious diseases, had funded the creation of the coronavirus. Rion later claimed without evidence that other mainstream media outlets were parroting Communist Party of China propaganda. During a press conference with Trump, she asked him whether it was \\"racist\\" to use the term \\"Chinese food\\" and continued: Rion previously worked as a political cartoonist, and had among other things promoted murder of Seth Rich conspiracy theories and written an anti-feminist children's book. She without evidence claimed that former FBI lawyer Lisa Page and former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe were involved in an affair. OANN later retracted the story. In April 2020, Rion was expelled from the White House Correspondents Association and her formal seat was removed for flagrantly violating newly implemented social distancing rules in the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room. Despite this, Rion has boasted she was personally invited to attend by press secretary Stephanie Grisham a day after the ban. During May 2020, Kristian Rouz created a package for OAN in which he claimed the existence of ‚Äúmounting evidence of a globalist conspiracy‚Äù involving the Clintons, Soros, Bill Gates, Dr. Anthony Fauci, and the Chinese government. No evidence exists for any of this. (He also compiled the wholly fabricated story OANN ran in 2017 alleging that Hillary Clinton's political action committee secretly gave $800,000 to Antifa.) = Killing of George Floyd protests = In June 2020, during protests against racism and police brutality in the wake of the killing of George Floyd, OANN reporter Jack Posobiec falsely claimed that there were pipe bombs planted at the Korean War Memorial in Washington D.C., and that \\"federal assets [were] in pursuit\\". There were no pipe bombs, nor is there any evidence that any \\"federal assets\\" pursued it. Buffalo police shoving incident In June 2020, OANN claimed, without evidence, that an elderly protester who had been seriously injured by police \\"was attempting to capture the radio communications signature of Buffalo police officers.\\" The OANN, again without evidence, linked the man to the Antifa movement. President Trump later posted a tweet alleging that the protester \\"could be an ANTIFA provocateur\\", referencing OANN's unfounded conspiracy theory. OANN journalist Kristian Rouz did not provide evidence, referring only to right-wing blog The Conservative Treehouse, which describes itself as a \\"Rag Tag Bunch of Conservative Misfits\\". After the incident, OANN founder Robert Herring tweeted to Trump, \\"we won't let you down as your source for credible news!\\"  Reception  In March 2015, University of Southern California media professor Marty Kaplan praised the network for its focus on what he viewed as impartial news reporting, writing in The Huffington Post, \\"Ten minutes of OAN tells me eight stories; 10 minutes of Fox or MSNBC tells me one story, to make me mad,\\" while commenting that OAN's opinion segments were \\"as delusional and incendiary as anything on conservative talk radio or Fox.\\" Don Kaplan of the New York Daily News echoed similar sentiments, writing in December 2016 that, \\"it's by far one of the most fair news outlets around, serving up a daily diet of ad-free, non-ideological, nonstop news‚Äîwithout smirking, snarky anchors or much fanfare\\" while stating that its opinion segments \\"skew hard to the right.\\" In July 2017, Marc Fisher wrote in The Washington Post that the network was \\"a reliably sympathetic voice of the [Trump] administration‚Äôs goals and actions\\". In July 2018, Media Matters for America criticized OAN host Liz Wheeler for advancing conspiracy theories relating to the Planned Parenthood 2015 undercover videos controversy and other abortion topics and tying tangentially related news stories to the \\"so-called liberal hypocrisy on abortion.\\" The Wikipedia community deprecated OAN as a source on the English Wikipedia in late 2019 for publishing \\"falsehoods, conspiracy theories, and intentionally misleading stories\\". In April 2020, John Oliver ran a segment of Last Week Tonight criticizing OAN's far-right bias and promotion of unfounded conspiracy theories, stating: \\"it is more important than ever to be on the lookout for OAN's bullshit and to make sure no one that you know is falling for it either.\\"  Ratings  OAN does not subscribe to Nielsen ratings, citing the rating companies' high price. In March 2019, OAN cited Comscore set-top-box viewership data to claim it was the \\"fourth-rated cable news network\\" that month.

One of the most accomplished junior heavyweight tag teams in New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) history, the team held the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship four times and successfully defended it during their second reign record-setting seven times. While members of Apollo 55, Devitt and Taguchi also accomplished several singles achievements with Devitt holding the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship three times, while both he and Taguchi managed to win the annual Best of the Super Juniors tournament. After four years of teaming together, the team disbanded in April 2013. History =Formation (2009)= Ryusuke Taguchi On January 4, 2009, at New Japan Pro-Wrestling's (NJPW) Wrestle Kingdom III in Tokyo Dome, The Motor City Machine Guns (Alex Shelley and Chris Sabin), representatives of American promotion Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), defeated No Limit (Tetsuya Naito and Yujiro) for the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship. Following the event, several teams emerged as candidates to bring the title back to NJPW. After two of these teams, No Limit and Unione (Milano Collection A.T. and Taichi), wrestled to a draw on January 30, former IWGP Junior Heavyweight Champion Ryusuke Taguchi entered the ring alongside Irish wrestler Prince Devitt to announce that the two were also entering the race for a shot at the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship. Devitt's longtime tag team partner Minoru had recently left NJPW, leading to the promotion putting him and Taguchi together because of their similarities in both age and size, despite the fact that neither of them could speak the other's language. On February 15, Devitt and Taguchi failed to earn a shot at the title, when they were defeated in a four-way number one contender's match by No Limit. After No Limit failed to regain the title from The Motor City Machine Guns, NJPW announced that Devitt and Taguchi were next in line for a shot at the title. On April 1, Devitt and Taguchi held a public training session, during which they announced that in the future their tag team would be known as \\"Apollo 55\\" (pronounced \\"Apollo Go Go\\"), while also presenting their first two double-team finishing maneuvers. Devitt has stated that he came up with the team name, combining his love of sci-fi and space with Taguchi's nickname \\"Funky Weapon a Go Go\\" (\\"Go\\" also being Japanese for the number five). Apollo 55 received their title shot on April 5, but were defeated by The Motor City Machine Guns. =Junior heavyweight tag team domination (2009‚Äì2012)= On June 20, 2009, at Dominion 6.20, Apollo 55 defeated Unione to earn another shot at the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship and, on July 5, they defeated The Motor City Machine Guns in a rematch to win the title, bringing it back to NJPW. Apollo 55 made their first successful title defense just fifteen days later against Unione. On September 13, Apollo 55 defeated The Motor City Machine Guns in a rubber match for their second successful title defense. On October 17, Apollo 55 entered the 2009 G1 Tag League, where they made it all the way to the finals on November 1, before losing to the heavyweight tag team of Giant Bernard and Karl Anderson. Before the end of the year, Apollo 55 made another successful defense of the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship, when they defeated Koji Kanemoto and Nobuo Yoshihashi on December 4. The team started off 2010 with their fourth successful defense, defeating the Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) tag team of Averno and √öltimo Guerrero on January 4 at Wrestle Kingdom IV in Tokyo Dome. On February 14, Apollo 55 made their fifth successful defense against Dick Togo and Gedo. Afterwards, Devitt was sidelined with an injury, which resulted in Taguchi vacating the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship on April 21. Devitt was, however, able to make his return for the Super J Tag Tournament 1st, a one-night, eight-team tournament used to determine the new champions. In the tournament, Apollo 55 made it all the way to the finals, before being defeated by El Samurai and Koji Kanemoto. Following the tournament, Devitt began breaking out as a singles wrestler, first winning the 2010 Best of the Super Juniors tournament on June 13 and then defeating Naomichi Marufuji for the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship on June 19 at Dominion 6.19. On June 30, Devitt, Taguchi and Hirooki Goto, billed together as \\"Apollo 555\\", won the three-night J Sports Crown Openweight 6 Man Tag Tournament. On July 19, Devitt and Taguchi defeated El Samurai and Koji Kanemoto to regain the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship. However, after only one successful defense, they lost the title to DDT Pro-Wrestling representatives, Golden‚òÜLovers (Kenny Omega and Kota Ibushi), on October 11 at Destruction '10. Apollo 55 received a rematch for the title on November 14 at a DDT event, but were again defeated by the Golden‚òÜLovers. Prince Devitt After Devitt successfully defended the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship against Ibushi on January 4, 2011, at Wrestle Kingdom V in Tokyo Dome, he and Taguchi were granted another shot at the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship and, on January 23 during the Fantastica Mania 2011 weekend, defeated the Golden‚òÜLovers to win the title for the third time. During the next nine months, Apollo 55 successfully defended the title seven times, setting a new NJPW record. During the reign they also made successful defenses in the Kaientai Dojo promotion against Little‚òÜGalaxy (Makoto Oishi and Shiori Asahi) and in the United States, during NJPW's Invasion Tour, against the Strong Style Thugz (Homicide and Low Ki). On June 23, Apollo 555 also won the second J Sports Crown Openweight 6 Man Tag Tournament. After a reign of 260 days, Apollo 55 lost the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship to the No Remorse Corps (Davey Richards and Rocky Romero) in their eighth title defense on October 10, 2011, at Destruction '11. In December, Devitt made successful defenses of the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship against both Richards and Romero, which resulted in another IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship match on January 4, 2012, at Wrestle Kingdom VI in Tokyo Dome, where Apollo 55 defeated the No Remorse Corps to win the title for the fourth time, meaning that they now shared the record for most reigns as a team with Jado & Gedo (a record which has since been broken by The Young Bucks). However, just a month later on February 12 at The New Beginning, Apollo 55 lost the title back to the No Remorse Corps in their first defense. Devitt and Taguchi continued teaming together throughout 2012, though both were also involved in the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship picture with Taguchi most notably winning the 2012 Best of the Super Juniors. On November 2, Apollo 55 made it to the finals of the 2012 Super Jr. Tag Tournament, before losing to the Time Splitters (Alex Shelley and Kushida). =Dissolution and aftermath (2013‚Äì2014)= Prince Devitt and Ryusuke Taguchi during their final match against each other at Invasion Attack 2014 On January 4, 2013, at Wrestle Kingdom 7 in Tokyo Dome, after Devitt had successfully defended the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship in a three-way match against Low Ki and Kota Ibushi, Taguchi entered the ring to formally challenge his tag team partner to a future title match, which Devitt accepted. The title match between the two Apollo 55 members took place on February 10 at The New Beginning and saw Devitt retain his title. Shortly afterwards, after losing a high-profile non- title main event against IWGP Heavyweight Champion Hiroshi Tanahashi on March 3, Devitt began portraying a more cocky and villainous persona, regularly disrespecting both partners and opponents, with the exception of Taguchi, whom he tried to get to go along with his new attitude. On April 7 at Invasion Attack, Apollo 55 unsuccessfully challenged the Time Splitters for the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship. Post-match, Devitt attacked Taguchi with help from Bad Luck Fale, signaling the end of one of the most accomplished junior heavyweight tag teams in NJPW history. Following the dissolution of Apollo 55, Prince Devitt formed the villainous Bullet Club stable with Fale, Karl Anderson and Tama Tonga, while also beginning to move out of the junior heavyweight division and even challenging for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship. Despite this transition, Devitt kept holding the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship, though the title was largely pushed aside and forgotten. He ended up holding the title until January 2014, when he lost it to Kota Ibushi. Meanwhile, Taguchi suffered a hip injury shortly after the breakup of Apollo 55, but returned in February 2014, restarting his rivalry with Devitt. On April 6 at Invasion Attack 2014, one year after the dissolution of Apollo 55, Taguchi defeated Devitt in a grudge match between the two, after which they shook hands with each other. The following day, NJPW announced Devitt's resignation from the promotion.

The spectrum auction and subesequent reallocations were authorized by Title VI (The Spectrum Act) of the payroll tax cut extension passed by the United States Congress on February 17, 2012. Background The 2008 United States wireless spectrum auction, dealing with allocations for UHF television in the 700 MHz band, generated $19.6 billion from companies such as AT&T; and Verizon Communications. This auction re-allocated the UHF space formerly occupied by channels 52‚Äì69, after the completion of the primary digital television transition in the United States from NTSC to ATSC in 2009. In effect, the digital transition had eliminated 25% of the space allocated for UHF television in the United States. Wireless broadband internet access interests had expressed desire for more broadcast spectrum for their use, and in March 2009, Massachusetts Senator John Kerry introduced a bill requiring a study of efficient use of the spectrum. The lobbying group CTIA pressed for 800 MHz of additional spectrum. David Donovan of The Association for Maximum Service Television, seeing that further cuts of broadcast television UHF frequencies was being eyed, stated that the 2 GHz S band, allocated for mobile satellite service, was not being used ten years after its allocation, and would be an appropriate allocation tartget rather than demanding even more space in UHF broadcast ranges. The National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) and the AMST commented to the FCC that the government should make maximum use of the newly available 700 MHz UHF spectrum and other spectrum already allocated for wireless before asking for more, while companies that would benefit asked the government to look everywhere possible. Many broadcasters objected to further encroachment on the UHF broadcast spectrum. A Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) study claimed that $62 billion worth of spectrum could become $1 trillion for wireless, and one proposal would require all TV stations, including LPTV, to give up all spectrum, with subsidized multichannel services replacing over-the-air TV, even after viewers spent a great deal of money on the DTV transition. Broadcasters responded, \\"In the broadcasting context, the 'total value' is not a strict financial measure, but rather is one that encompasses the broader public policy objectives such as universal service, local journalism and public safety.\\" Broadcasters pointed out that the government, viewers and the related industries spent $1.5 billion making sure that a minority of the audience would be ready for the DTV transition. Any change could mean the loss of free TV to people in rural areas, broadcasters said, particularly \\"local journalism, universal service, availability of educational programming, and timely and reliable provision of emergency information.\\" Meredith Attwell Baker, a Republican FCC commissioner, agreed that properly using the existing spectrum was important, and part of doing this was using the latest technology. The wireless industry needed more spectrum, both licensed and unlicensed. FCC broadband advisor Blair Levin wanted a plan by February 2010 (later extended to March 2010). Another proposal was \\"geo-filtered WiMAX\\", which would allow HDTV but only in a particular market, with the remainder of the spectrum sold for $60 billion. WiMax would replace the existing services but would make MVPD services cheaper, while still allowing broadcasters to make more money. The additional spectrum made available could then be sold to pay the industry's debt. Bob Powers, vice president of government relations for the National Religious Broadcasters, pointed out that the Levin proposal did not provide for religious broadcasters. In 2009, venture capitalist Tom Wheeler called broadcaster opposition a \\"jihad\\", but he went on to say broadcast TV was \\"without a doubt ... the most efficient means of delivering common content to a large audience.\\" Wheeler was nominated for FCC chairman in 2013. Broadcaster resistance Regarding the CEA study's findings, Donovan said to Broadcasting & Cable magazine: > Wireless companies are asking the government to participate in the biggest > consumer bait-and-switch in American history. For the last few years, the > government told consumers that digital television would bring them free > over-the-air HDTV and more channels. Now, after purchasing billions of > dollars in new digital equipment and antennas, wireless advocates are asking > the government to renege on its promise. High-definition programming and > more digital channels would become the sole and exclusive province of pay > services. The American public simply will not stand for this. PBS and its stations also opposed the plan, saying they had spent a lot of money on the digital upgrade which they need to earn back, and viewers had contributed expecting the digital broadcasting to continue. They claimed PBS was \\"efficient and productive, and abundantly serves the public interest.\\" Noncommercial broadcasters said they needed broadcast spectrum for superior educational and children's programming. PBS said 85 percent of its stations used HDTV and 82 percent had two or more standard channels. Ohio State University said it had \\"no excess\\" spectrum. An FCC workshop on November 23, 2009 produced several ideas. Virginia Tech professor Charles Bostian said sharing should be done, but not in the white spaces; WiFi spectrum should be used instead. Vint Cerf of Google said cable companies could share some spectrum, which the companies would like to do except they have \\"must-carry\\" rules that will not allow this. BBN Technologies chief engineer Chip Elliott called for government-funded broadband to be shared by researchers. Collaboration was the key to advancing the technology, and the word \\"collaboratories\\" referred to broadband as \\"not only the goal of the research, but the vehicle as well.\\" Wi-Fi testing using white spaces took place in Virginia in Fall 2009 and in Wilmington, North Carolina in 2010. The National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) opposed ending broadcast TV because the industry spent $15 billion, in addition to giving up spectrum already. On December 14, 2009 at a hearing before the Communications Subcommittee of the House Energy & Commerce Committee, NAB president Gordon H. Smith said the government and individuals had spent too much money on the DTV transition and for HDTV for further changes to make their efforts worthless, and that broadband and broadcasting could co-exist. He pointed out that in the 1970s, broadcasting used 60 percent of the spectrum that it does now to deliver a much higher quality product, and that existing regulations required more efficient use of the spectrum than would be the case for new devices. On the subject of what could be done instead, Smith recommended using white space in rural areas with fixed devices rather than mobile devices, and new types of broadband service such as those developed by Sezmi. CTIA president Steve Largent said that the industry needed spectrum, \\"wherever it comes from.\\" He said government spectrum probably was not efficiently used and would \\"likely\\" be \\"repurposed\\", while other broadcast and satellite spectrum \\"may\\" be used better for wireless. Largent also said without more spectrum, companies might merge to better use what they had. Consultant Dave Hatfield, former FCC engineering and technology chief, said making maximum use of existing spectrum through compression and modulation would help, but it would not be enough. Oregon Republican House member Greg Walden criticized the FCC for hiring Distinguished Scholar in Residence Stuart Benjamin, whose essay recommending replacing broadcast spectrum entirely Walden called an \\"abomination\\". Plan announcement and preparations On March 16, 2010, at the FCC's monthly meeting, Connecting America: The National Broadband Plan was revealed, with a combination of mandatory and voluntary efforts expected to increase spectrum by 300 MHz; 120 MHz of that was expected to come from broadcasters, and 90 MHz from mobile satellite service. By 2015, broadcasters would have to leave channels 46 through 51, allowing another 36 MHz to be used for wireless Internet access by \\"repacking\\", or relocating channels now on those frequencies. A total of 120 MHz needed to be reclaimed from broadcasters, the rest voluntarily. The FCC Chairman's Senior Counselor Colin Crowell explained that the spectrum crunch wasn't an imminent crisis, but rather \\"it‚Äôs a crisis in five or six years.\\" Failure to act could make Internet access more expensive and leave the United States less able to compete with other countries, the FCC report said. House Communications Subcommittee chairman Rick Boucher, a Virginia Democrat, said it would take four years from the time a bill passed to determine where the new spectrum would come from. The FCC had 50 MHz of spectrum available for wireless broadband, but this was expected to increase to between 500 MHz and 800 MHz over 10 years. 300 MHz would be made available by 2015. The National Association of Broadcasters opposed the plan, issuing this statement: > We are concerned by reports today that suggest many aspects of the plan may > in fact not be as voluntary as originally promised. Moreover, as the > nation's only communications service that is free, local and ubiquitous, we > would oppose any attempt to impose onerous new spectrum fees on > broadcasters. Mark Wigfield, broadband spokesman for the FCC, pointed out that even in the unlikely event all broadcasters in a market gave up their spectrum, the FCC would have to guarantee that some over-the-air service remained. In April 2011, FCC chairman Julius Genachowski said \\"realigning\\" would be necessary if broadcasters did not volunteer, while Intel's Peter Pitsch told Congress \\"the repacking process should not be made voluntary.\\" The NAB's Smith worried that the process could cause numerous problems for broadcasters and viewers. The spectrum auctions were authorized by Title VI (The Spectrum Act) of the payroll tax cut extension passed by Congress on February 17, 2012. A reverse auction would let broadcasters determine how much they were willing to take for giving up spectrum, while the sale of licenses to broadband providers would take place through a forward auction, in which proceeds would have to cover payments to broadcasters, costs of the auction, and costs of relocation. On April 27, 2012, the FCC approved letting stations share spectrum using DTV subchannels, with all stations that had \\"full channels\\" keeping rights such as must-carry. At the first \\"reverse incentive auction\\" workshop on October 26, FCC Media Bureau chief Bill Lake said stations would not be able to decide their channel but could apply to change it. At a September 30, 2013 workshop, broadcasters and equipment makers were asked what the changes would cost. The result was that answers would only be possible after the FCC said who would be moving and how. The Spectrum Act provided $1.75 billion for the reasonable expenses of relocating stations, and the money would have to be paid in three years without further action by Congress. Among the expenses would be meeting new tower standards for dealing with wind and ice, interim facilities so some stations would not be temporarily forced off the air, and translators in areas that needed them, mostly in the West. The FCC asked for comments to be received by November 4, 2013, with spectrum auctions coming later. Providers of wireless services recommended that broadcasters give up two channels, or 15 MHz, of Broadcast auxiliary service, which is used for relaying breaking news, but the NAB said this spectrum could be shared with the United States Department of Defense. In March 2014, KLCS and KJLA conducted a channel sharing trial in partnership with CTIA and the Association of Public Television Stations, which tested the viability of broadcasting two sets of television services within the same 6 MHz channel band, including varying combinations of high and standard definition feeds. The experiment was deemed successful, although certain scenarios (particularly two HD feeds on both channels) were found to affect video quality on more complex content. Later in September 2014, KLCS announced that it would enter into a channel sharing arrangement with fellow public station KCET and participate in the 2015 auction. In March 2014, the FCC voted to ban joint sales agreements‚Äîarrangements in which a station brokers the sale of its advertising to another station in the market, by making them count the same as outright ownership if the senior partner sells 15% or more of the brokering station's advertising, and give two years for station owners to unwind joint sales agreements that are in violation of the new rules. It was speculated that the move to ban JSAs was an attempt to devalue television stations (particularly, the smaller outlets that were commonly operated under JSA's and similar agreements), and in turn, push their owners to participate in the incentive auction. FCC Media Bureau Chief Bill Lake denied that the push to ban JSAs was connected to the spectrum auction. Broadcast incentive auction The reverse and forward auctions to repack TV stations and free up spectrum for wireless communications would be implemented in several phases, with targets for how much spectrum would be reallocated, and a balance of payments needed to pay for the reverse auction plus transition costs with proceeds from the forward auction. On April 18, 2014, the FCC announced guidelines for the auction. All stations would keep their coverage area as of February 22, 2012, if possible. Channel 37 would become a \\"guard band\\" between broadcasting and wireless services. Each station would be given a deadline to make its upgrades, with all stations expected to complete the transition after 39 months. Wheeler later said if stations could not meet the deadline, they would not necessarily have to go off the air. The FCC approved the framework 3-2, with the NAB claiming the commission had not met its obligation to compensate broadcasters and guarantee service for viewers. In a July 2, 2015 filing, the Expanding Opportunities for Broadcasters Coalition (EOBC), representing over a hundred TV stations planning to participate in the incentive auction, said that population data was too important and could cause an $8.3 billion drop in opening prices without \\"relatively minor\\" changes. Because the incentive auction was a reverse auction, even these prices were the highest possible. On July 16, the FCC planned to make final the rules of the auction, including requiring stations to move to their new channels 39 months after the auction, and no reserved channel for noncommercial broadcasters. The procedures vote was moved to August 6 but the auction was set for March 29, 2016. After the vote, FCC commissioner Ajit Pai said the plan \\"permits too many broadcasters to be placed in the wireless band\\", which would result in interference between TV stations and others using the band. Dennis Wharton, NAB executive vice president of communications, said that the vote minimized what stations would receive for giving up broadcasting, guaranteed numerous interference problems and gave \\"a handout of free spectrum with no public interest obligations to multibillion dollar companies\\" while hurting local television news and especially LPTV stations and translators. The LPTV Spectrum Coalition and CTIA objected to the vote, while the EOBC said no one would be happy but the compromise would be enough. The NAB filed petitions asking for the FCC not to penalize stations that did not participate in the auction, and asking that stations not be moved to the duplex gap. On October 15, the Applications Procedure Public Notice set the filing window as noon December 1 through 6 pm December 18 (this was later changed to December 8 through January 12). After that time, no more stations could join, but bids from those who did would not be final until March 29, 2016. The FCC released opening bid prices on October 16. These included three categories: stations giving up or sharing channels (which would mean the offering the full price), stations moving from UHF to high VHF (less than full price), and stations moving from high VHF to low VHF (lower than full price but not the lowest). Other factors were the number of people served and interference. The FCC designated the auction as Auction 1001, with the purpose being to make 144 MHz available for resale to wireless companies. If that target was met, broadcasters would have been repacked into channels up to 26. If the minimum target of 42 MHz was met, channels up to 44 would have been used. The \\"clearing target\\" might not be met, in which case a lower target would have been set, with the process continuing until a target was reached. In each market where vacant channels remain, the FCC intends for one of those channels to be used for unlicensed devices. The FCC announced the clearing target would be 126 MHz. This meant fewer channels for relocation of LPTV stations, which would not be protected after the auction. It was believed thousands of LPTV stations would have to be relocated. LPTV stations argued that because they were not allowed to participate in the process, they could lose spectrum. On May 5, Scott Caulkins of Caulkins & Bruce PC, representing one of the owners of LPTV stations, argued before the DC Circuit Court that the Spectrum Act and FCC authority gave LPTV stations \\"essentially the same [spectrum] rights\\" as full-power stations. He said they could only be considered secondary if they caused interference, but that the result of repacking would be more interference. FCC attorney Jacob Lewis said LPTV stations would be secondary and that considering their rights would mean too many stations to relocate. Each bidder in the forward auction was required to bid on 95 percent of census blocks in which an interest was shown. As of August, Comcast, AT&T;, T-Mobile, Verizon and others had submitted bids for 100 MHz of spectrum in the forward auction totaling over $11 billion, with the goal $88.4 billion. Only $22.45 billion had been raised when the FCC ended stage one of the forward auction after two weeks. After the second stage of the reverse auction, the target for stage two of the forward auction was 114 MHz, with the desired goal $54.6 billion, enough for two channels per market. With less spectrum to be purchased, lower demand could mean lower costs for wireless providers. Failure of stage two could reduce the target further, to 108 MHz, or one channel per market. If stage three also fails, the target could even be 84 MHz, an additional four channels per market. The lower the target, the lower the amount paid to stations, but the fewer the number of public stations that could participate. And public stations that are not \\"repacked\\" must pay for their own equipment upgrades. Stage two of the forward auction ended October 19 with $21.5 billion in total bids, $33.1 billion less than expected. The reverse auction's third stage began November 1 with a 108 MHz target. The number of paired blocks per market started at 10, reduced to 9 in stage two, and 8 in stage three. Four impaired blocks, with interference in less than 15 percent of an area, protected Mexican channels below 37. Two markets had interference in 15 to 50 percent of an area. Stage three of the forward auction began December 5 after total bids for stage three were $40.3 billion for 108 MHz. Stage four of the reverse auction ended January 13, 2017 with $10.05 billion paid for 84 MHz, or seven licenses in each market. 70 MHz of that goes to the wireless companies, with 14 MHz for unlicensed use. With less spectrum cleared, fewer stations will move and none will be in the buffer or wireless bands. Bidding ended March 30, and on April 12, the FCC announced the completion of the incentive auction. The auction raised $19.8 billion and made more spectrum available for faster 5G service. Nearly $10.1 billion goes to 175 TV stations, $7.3 billion to the United States Treasury, and $1.8 billion to assist with the repacking process. Lawrence Chu, an advisor to the FCC during the bidding process, considered the auction a success while admitting that \\"there will be some people disappointed on the broadcaster side.\\" T-Mobile paid almost $8 billion for 1,525 licenses representing 45 percent of low-band spectrum, giving the company coverage of the entire country and about four times the spectrum it had, while Dish Network spent $6.2 billion on 486 licenses and Comcast received 73 licenses for its $1.7 billion bid. AT&T; bid $910 million 23 licenses and U.S. Cellular bid $328.6 million on 188 licenses. Repacking The collective moves of UHF and VHF television stations to accommodate the elimination of the 600 MHz band came to be known as repacking. With the advent of virtual channels after the transition to digital television in 2009, it was possible for any given broadcast channel to change frequencies while still retaining their long- standing channel numbers for identification and branding purposes. The issue arose that if a television viewer's station changes its frequency, their television will not be aware of the shift (even if the virtual channel remains the same), unless they perform a rescan: forcing their television to scan all ATSC digital channels for signals. The estimated number of channels moving is still over 1,000. Although moving channels by region was considered, which would work better for the companies doing the work, channels would instead move according to which moves are related. 710 stations were part of \\"a sort of interference daisy-chain\\", meaning the stations had to work with each other, and that it was unlikely stations could meet the deadline or complete the process using the funds allocated. Some stations would be required to go off the air or have temporary facilities or temporary channel sharing (thought the FCC was reluctant to ask viewers to rescan twice, and the Cable Act did not allow \\"must carry\\" requirements for stations that used temporary facilities). So-called \\"bottleneck stations\\", if they did share, would allow the spectrum to be used by wireless services sooner without interrupting broadcast service. Weather delays and important rating events would also need to be considered. Companies doing the work might also have their own reasons for how they schedule work. The NAB filed comments October 28, 2016 asking that the 39-month deadline for moving be changed, or allow waivers. The repack would take place in ten phases, and Michael Dell's OTA Broadcasting asked the FCC to provide information on bottleneck stations so that they could be given incentives to give up licenses or move to temporary channels. The Transition Scheduling Plan from the Media Bureau and the Incentive Auction Task Force divided stations into ten phases. Each phase had a testing period. Until this time, stations could not use their new channel. After the completion period, stations could no longer use their old channel. Stations needing to move to new channels would have 90 days to file for construction permits. Stations giving up their licenses would have 90 days to leave their pre-auction channels after receiving auction proceeds. Stations entering channel-sharing agreements would have 6 months to finish the process after receiving auction proceeds. Priority would be given to clearing the 600 MHz for wireless use. With less spectrum cleared than expected, fewer stations were moving, and the $1.75 billion cost of relocating was expected to be enough. Also, a February 23, 2017 vote to approve voluntary adoption of ATSC 3.0 meant broadcasters could upgrade to the new standard and to 4K and interactive capability at the same time as repacking. The FCC did not need for 400 of the 2,200 eligible stations to participate, and the total number who did may not be known for two years. Only 175 of the remaining 1,800 needed to be paid. Out of those, twelve did not indicate they would continue broadcasting. 133 stations planned to share, 29 were moving from UHF to VHF, and one was moving from high-VHF to low-VHF. The FCC released the list of new channel assignments, and the 39-month moving process was set to begin April 13, 2017. The first moves would take place by November 30, 2018. The final phase of moves had a scheduled completion of July 3, 2020. Rep. Frank Pallone introduced a bill on July 20, 2017 allowing another billion dollars if necessary for repacking. Pallone said one use for the money would be moving FM stations located on the same towers as TV stations. LPTV stations and translators could also be helped by the bill, and T-Mobile said it would also help those stations with their costs. Pallone had introduced a discussion draft in January 2016 in case the estimates of costs were wrong. Emphasizing the importance of local news, Pallone said at that time, \\"[I]t is critical that we make this transition as seamless as possible for consumers without interruptions in their service.\\" Senator Jerry Moran introduced the Viewer and Listener Protection Act July 26. The Ray Baum Act that passed the House of Representatives provided for additional funding once it became clear $1.75 billion would not be enough, and for radio stations, LPTV stations and translators. It also provided $50 million to explain the changes to viewers. 12 TV stations faced an October 25, 2017 deadline to give up their licenses. 13 other stations had planned to share but instead went off the air. 120 other stations that announced they would share channels had a January 23, 2018 deadline, which could be extended six months. $10 billion was paid to 175 stations; 30 of which were moving from UHF to VHF, or high VHF to low VHF. LPTV stations were not protected and many would have to apply for new channels. It was expected that more than one station in an area would want the same channel, leading to auctions. Making government spectrum available With the incentive auction completed, FCC Commissioner Michael O'Rielly proposed incentives for the federal government to give up some of its spectrum for use by companies. Without the profit incentive found in the private sector, federal agencies had little reason for efficient use of their spectrum. O'Rielly's proposal could give budget relief to agencies giving up spectrum. \\"Spectrum speculators\\" Beginning in 2010, a large number of television station acquisitions began to occur among a group of companies referred to as \\"spectrum speculators\\". Backed by private equity groups, these companies have primarily purchased smaller, low-rated stations within or in close proximity to major markets, with an intent to possibly sell the stations and their licenses during the incentive auction, and no interest in their future operation as a television station. Among these \\"speculators\\" have included the Blackstone Group-owned LocusPoint Networks, the Fortress Investment Group-backed NRJ TV LLC, and Michael Dell's OTA Broadcasting. Spectrum speculators do not typically identify themselves as being broadcasting companies, but as part of the wireless industry, and often affiliate with low-demand or 'leftover' networks such as Retro Television Network, Youtoo America and AMGTV to maintain some kind of broadcast service. Public concerns surrounding spectrum speculators surfaced in 2013 with the announcement that Atlantic City's NBC affiliate WMGM-TV would be sold to LocusPoint Networks, and a belief by local residents that the fate of WMGM was in jeopardy because of their position as a speculator. In response to the concerns (which also included viewers establishing a Save NBC 40 website), LocusPoint co-founder Bill deKay stated that they planned to continue operating the station as an NBC affiliate, and allowed Access.1 to continue operating the station on its behalf through December 31, 2014. At the same time, however, NBC declined to renew the station's affiliation past December 31, 2014. On January 1, 2015, the station began carrying Soul of the South programming instead, but the station's fate following the spectrum auction remained unclear. Access.1 retained most of the station's staff to form a new news operation, which eventually moved to a new low-VHF station, WACP. Following the auction, Univision Communications filed to acquire the station.

Cool-Aid in Victoria was started by the Victoria Youth Council in 1968 to meet the needs of the young transients who flock to British Columbia in the summer.  History  During April and May 1968, members of the Victoria Youth Council researched the extent and quality of helping facilities available to youth in the Greater Victoria area. For housing, the picture was ‚Äúdismal‚Äù with the Salvation Army housing only men, and the YMCA housing women but charging $2.50 - $3.50 per night. For counseling, the outlook was even worse. This led to the idea of a hostel and an emergency-oriented, crisis intervention service, run by youth. Having obtained permission from a Vancouver group to use the name ‚ÄúCool Aid,‚Äù the group began operations with a phone number and a single shelter. Between 1970 and 1976 Cool Aid evolved into a more serious and adult run organization operating a shelter and medical clinic. In 1976 the organization was formally incorporated as the Victoria Cool Aid Society. Over the following years and decades Cool Aid has expanded its shelter facilities and increased the range of services to include medical and dental, counseling, employment and a community center which promotes healthy living.

History Main nave. The history of the church goes back to a picture sent by Henry the Navigator. He said that he thought the picture holy and he named it as Santa Maria in Africa. The first hard evidence of the church date from 1676 when it is mentioned in building work and then again in 1697. Under Bishop Don Martin de Barcia the church was internally decorated with paintings and both bells and the altarpiece were installed. We know that Barcia was still Bishop when the church was consecrated on 5 August 1752. The altarpiece is decorated with a large sculpture of Mary with Christ which is traditionally carved from a single piece of wood. Legend (while King John I of Portugal was canvassing for governors after capturing ceuta in 1415, a young Pedro de Menezes, 1st Count of Vila Real was nearby, distractedly playing choca (a kind of Medieval hockey) with a stick of zambujeiro or Aleo (wild olive tree) from Alcoutim. Hearing all the high nobles making excuses to avoid the job, the young Pedro de Menezes stepped forward and approached the king with his gaming stick (aleo) in hand and told him that, with only that stick, he could defend Ceuta from all the power of Morocco.\\"Eu s√≥ com este p√°u, sou capaz de defender Ceuta, de todo o poder dos mouros\\", as reported in Portugal antigo e moderno, 1878, p.495. Another recitation of the legend places it a little later, c. 1418, when Pedro de Menezes was visiting Lisbon. He was playing truque (a type of shuffleboard) in the king's court, when a messenger arrived with the news that the Marinids were assembling an army to retake Ceuta. The king ordered Pedro de Menezes (who was already governor of Ceuta) to return immediately to Ceuta, and promised that he (the king) would do what he could to dispatch reinforcements. D. Pedro de Menezes held up his shuffleboard stick and told the king not to hurry the reinforcements, that he could fend off the might of Morocco with that stick alone. See Z.N. Gon√ßalves Brand√£o, 1883, Monumentos e lendas de Santarem , p.514 As a result of this story, all future Portuguese governors of Ceuta would be presented with a zambujeiro staff as a symbol of their office upon their investiture.) The aleo that was used by Pedro is kept in the Church, the statue af Mary holds the aleo. Santar√©m. Pedro de Menezes was originally buried in the cathedral of Ceuta (a converted mosque), but his remains were later translated by his daughter to the Augustinian monastery church of Igreja da Gra√ßa in Santar√©m, Portugal. His remains are still found there, in an effigy tomb alongside his third wife, Brites Coutinho. The Menezes tomb is decorated with carved wild olive tree branches, and repeatedly embossed with the word aleo, a reference to the gaming stick which Pedro de Menezes made famous. The same motif and slogan, \\"aleu\\", is found in the coat of arms of the town of Vila Real, the seat of Pedro de Menezes's fief, it is also found on the coat of arms of the town of Alcoutim, where Pedro's descendants were later made Count's of Alcoutim.

In 1644, by way of reparation for her losses, King Charles I created Alice Dudley a duchess in her own right \\"for her natural life\\", the dukedom thus created not being heritable. Background and marriage Robert Dudley, the Duchess of Dudley's husband Alice Leigh was a daughter of Sir Thomas Leigh, 1st Baronet (died 1625), of Stoneleigh Abbey, Warwickshire, who was created a baronet in 1611, by his marriage to Catherine, a daughter of Sir John Spencer of Wormleighton. Her father was the third son of Sir Thomas Leigh, Lord Mayor of London for 1558, and in 1643 her nephew Thomas (1595‚Äì1672) was created the first Baron Leigh.John Burke, Sir Bernard Burke, A Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Extinct and Dormant Baronetcies of England, Ireland and Scotland (London: John Russell Smith, 1844), p. 307 On 11 September 1596, at Ashow, Warwickshire, Alice Leigh married Sir Robert Dudley, the natural son of Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester, Queen Elizabeth I's favourite, by Lady Sheffield. A daughter of this marriage, who was to be the first of seven, was baptised on 25 September 1597. Five of their daughters reached adulthood: Alice (who married Sir Ferdinando Sutton), Douglas (who married William Dansey), Katherine (who married Sir Richard Leveson), Frances (who married Sir Gilbert Kniveton), and Anne (who married Sir Robert Holborne).George Adlard, Amye Robsart and the Earl of Leycester with Memoirs and Correspondence of Sir Robert Dudley and A History of Kenilworth Castle (reprinted by Echo Library, 2007, ), p. 323 In 1605, Robert Dudley left England and fled to Florence, accompanied by his first cousin once removed, Elizabeth Southwell. That winter, he and Southwell announced their conversion to Roman Catholicism and intention to marry. To repudiate his existing marriage, Robert claimed that in 1591 he had entered into a marriage contract with Frances Vavasour, one of Queen Elizabeth's maids of honour. His third marriage was never recognised in England.Simon Adams, 'Alice Dudley (1579‚Äì1669)' and 'Dudley, Sir Robert (1574‚Äì1649), mariner and landowner' in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford University Press, 2007) Robert Dudley owned estates which included Kenilworth Castle which were valued at ¬£50,000.

In 1622 Charles obtained a special Act of Parliament to enable Alice Dudley \\"to alien her estate from her children as a feme sole\\", so that she could then sell her interest in the properties for ¬£4,000, plus further payments to be made in later years.John Burke, A general and heraldic dictionary of the peerages of England, Ireland, and Scotland, extinct, dormant, and in abeyance: England (1831), p. 183  Duchess of Dudley  By letters patent of 23 May 1644, King Charles I created Dudley a duchess for her own life. This creation was plainly stated to be prompted by the King's having considered the Star Chamber case of 1605, in which Dudley's husband had claimed to be his father's legitimate son, and Charles believing the verdict which had denied the legitimacy of the claim, to be incorrect; and by way of an apology for the failure of the King's deceased brother Henry to pay Dudley the true value of his estates and the Crown's failure to make further payments promised to Dudley herself; and also by way of a reward to two of Dudley's sons-in-law who were notable royalists, Sir Robert Holborne, attorney-general to the Prince of Wales, and Sir Richard Leveson, a member for Newcastle-under- Lyme in the Long Parliament.

It was built beginning about 1853 for Armistead Lewis Burwell (1809-1883) and his family, who inherited it (or received it as a dowry) from the parents of his wife, Mary Hix (1811-1895). Descended from the First Families of Virginia, Armistead L. Burwell operated a tobacco and grain plantation of about 350 improved acres using enslaved labor, and also had a chewing tobacco factory, gristmill and sawmill by 1860 (probably also operated by some of his 37 slaves per that year's federal census). His son William A. Burwell (1836-1882) ran the factory and bought the plantation from his father in 1864, and sold it in 1868 to his younger brother John Spotswood Burwell (1846-1926, a Confederate drummer during the war) who operated a dairy farm until after the turn of the century. and Accompanying photo The two-story frame house has a central passage plan, and reflects the Greek Revival style.

The only tungsten producing mine in Spain, it has been in continuous production since its commissioning in 2008. Los Santos 1t concentrate bags History The Los Santos scheelite deposit in western Spain was originally investigated by Billiton in the 1970s. Ownership passed into the hands of Siemcal S.A. (SIEMCALSA), a publicly owned company of mining and geological consultants based in Valladolid, Spain. In 2007 the deposit was purchased by Daytal, which at the time was 100% owned by Heemskirk Consolidated Limited (Heemskirk). The mine started production in 2008, managed by Daytal. The mine has continued operation since. Daytal was acquired by Almonty Industries in September 2011.http://bmcms1.com/staging/almonty.com/_resources/news/2011-09-28.pdf. The production mining operations currently employ 30 people ‚Äì all contractors. All of the other 68 employees on site work directly for Daytal. Ownership Los Santos Mine - General geology Los Santos - Local Geology Daytal Resources Spain S.L. (‚ÄúDaytal‚Äù) is a wholly owned Spanish subsidiary of Almonty Industries Inc (Almonty), a corporation governed by the Canada Business Corporations Act (the ‚ÄúCBCA‚Äù). Almonty trades on the TSX Venture Exchange (TSX-V) under the symbol ‚ÄúAII‚Äù. The Los Santos mine is 100% owned by Daytal. Adjacent to Los Santos mine concession, Daytal owns also two exploration permits that are named ‚ÄúQuien Sabe Donde‚Äùand ‚ÄúPor si Acaso‚Äù, both located in the continuity of the mining rights and in the border of Avila granite. Location Los Santos is located in the western part of the Iberian Peninsula, in the southern part of the province of Salamanca, within the municipalities of Los Santos, Fuenterroble de Salvatierra and Valdelacasa at longitude 5o 46‚Äô west and latitude 40o 32‚Äô north. It is 180 km west of Madrid, 50 km south of the city of Salamanca and 1 km east of the town of Los Santos. Coming from Guijuelo, the access is done by a road right at the entrance of Los Santos village. The average altitude of the sector where the deposit is located is 1.000 m above sea level, being located in the South slope of a hill, that extends 3 km from West to East, with a maximum altitude of 1.108 m, descending towards the South to 900 m. The climate is warm Mediterranean, with cold winters and an annual average rainfall of 900 mm, mainly between November and March, with minimums in June, July and August. The average annual temperature is between 11¬∞C and 14¬∞C, with a maximum registered value of 38¬∞C and a minimum of -14¬∞C. The values for real evapotranspiration is between 40 and 80% of precipitation. The solar evaporation is in the order of 1500 mm/year. Geology and Mineralization Los Santos Los Santos Sup pit Los Santos mine explosive charging Los Santos lies within Lower Palaeozoic sediments in the Central Iberian Tectonic Zone, which forms part of a Europe- wide, Variscan age orogenic belt. The stratigraphy comprises a thick sequence of clastic metasediments, ortho- and para-gneisses, with volcanic and carbonate formations. This stratigraphy was intruded by Hercynian (274 Ma old) granitoids in a series of plutons, with numerous, crosscutting granite and aplite dykes, sills and irregular pods intruding the metasediments up to 0.5km from the regional granite contact. In particular areas sulphide-rich skarns also occur. They are up to 5m thick and several metres in strike length, and comprise massive or semi-massive sulphide horizons with scheelite mineralisation. Sulphides comprise pyrite, arsenopyrite (lollingite), pyrrhotite and chalcopyrite as principal minerals. The four main rock types present at Los Santos are skarn, granite, calc-silicates and corneanas, a word applied to mean all other metamorphic rocks (mostly hornfels) at the site. Mining methods The open pit operations are conventional drill and blast operations, using mining contractors. Mining operations are based on mining 10m benches in waste, and 5m benches in ore, with 0.5m of sub-drilling. The blastholes are 3.5 in. in diameter, and drilled on a 3m x 2.5m pattern in Los Santos Sur, and a 3m x 2.5m pattern in the other pits. Pre-split lines are drilled along the edges of final walls. These pre-split holes are 3 in. in diameter, and are 0.8m apart. When water is present, water-resistant emulsion explosives (Riogel) are used. The night following every blasting containing ore, a team of geologists checks with ultraviolet (UV) lighting the real position of the ore after blasting displacement, in order to reduce dilution to the minimum. They also pass the UV lamp by the waste dumps and stockpiles, to check for any kind of error on ore/waste selection. During all ore mucking operations, a grade control geologist is always present, to check for any other variations that can be seen in the pit with the blasted skarn material. Mineral Processing Los Santos Run of mine stockpile The plant is primarily based on gravimetric separation, aimed at recovering scheelite, so as to provide a concentrate containing greater than 65% WO3. Current overall plant recovery of scheelite is approximately 60%. The plant is located immediately to the south of the Los Santos Sur pit, near the existing underground portal, in an area close to existing mine workings, the main waste dump and other infrastructure. With improvements in mill recovery, this has meant that specific areas where tailings have historically been deposited still contain economic WO3 grades. These tailing areas comprise two different kinds of tailings: a) Coarse rejects from the thickening cyclones and dewatering screens (Arenas). b) Fine rejects from the filter press (Tortas). Environment Los Santos tailings stockpile The mining method is open pit mining by transference in which the excavated pit volumes can be subsequently used for waste dumping purposes. With respect to water management, underground water is intercepted in some of the open pit workings. This water is currently used for dust suppression on the haul roads. Some of this water is also used to augment the water used in the processing plant. Ahead of reusing the water from the pits, the water used in the plant is sourced from the local municipal water supply. The plant design has been modified to recycle as much water as possible. There is no tailings discharge from the process and no tailings dam: all plant waste is dewatered and transported back to the mine waste dumps for disposal. These tailings will be reprocessed in a later phase of the project and used to restore the last pit shell. At the beginning of pits exploitation, topsoil is saved and used in the environmental restoration of filled pits and benches of waste dumps. The environmental restoration is a process that follows the exploitation of the mine.

Along with Sartor Resartus and The French Revolution it was one of the books that made his name. Its subject matter ranges from literary criticism (especially of German literature) to biography, history and social commentary. These essays have been described as \\"Intriguing in their own right as specimens of graphic and original nonfiction prose‚Ä¶indispensable for understanding the development of Carlyle's mind and literary career\\", and the scholar Angus Ross has noted that the review-form displays in the highest degree Carlyle's \\"discursiveness, allusiveness, argumentativeness, and his sense of playing the prophet's part.\\"  Publication  Carlyle earned his living during the late 1820s and early 1830s as a reviewer and essayist, contributing to the Edinburgh Review, the Foreign Review, Fraser's Magazine, and other journals. As early as 1830 he thought about collecting these pieces in book form, but it was not until 1837 that he seriously prepared for such an edition, when with the help of his friends Ralph Waldo Emerson, Harriet Martineau and others, he entered into negotiations with the Boston publisher James Munroe. The Critical and Miscellaneous Essays were duly published by him in four volumes, the first two being issued on 14 July 1838, with a preface by Emerson, and the last two on 1 July 1839. 250 copies of the Munroe edition were sent to the London publisher James Fraser, who first sold them under his own imprint and then, in 1840, produced a second edition. A third edition followed in 1847, and a fourth in 1857, each published by the firm of Chapman & Hall, and each incorporating additions from Carlyle's continuing journalistic output.

It was aired on October 6, 2011. The episode was written by David Ehrman and it was directed by Dave Barrett. Plot The Circle is trying to discover what happened to Heather Barnes, the woman Zachary mentioned in the previous episode and what he meant. While searching about her, they find out where his brother, Wade (Ben Cotton), lives and Cassie (Britt Robertson) and Adam (Thomas Dekker) go there to ask him about her. When they get there, they discover that Heather (Camille Sullivan) is in a catatonic state since the night of the fire on the boat, sixteen years ago. Wade tells them that she hadn't moved at all since then and the moment he says that, Heather grabs Cassie's arm. While being there, they see a witchcraft mark on Heather's arm. Cassie doesn't know what is going on and she can't understand why her mother would do something like that to her friend. Feeling guilty for what her mother did, she wants to help Heather by undoing the spell. Adam agrees to help her, after Cassie is telling him that she found her mom's Book of Shadows and there is a spell they can use. Adam calls Diana (Shelley Hennig) and informs her what they want to do. When Diana gets there, she is telling them that it's not a good idea to undo the spell, since they don't know why Amelia did it in the first place and because they also don't know how to do it. She stops them and Adam is leaving with her. Faye (Phoebe Tonkin) is getting there later, finding Cassie alone. When Cassie tells her what's going on and what she wants to do, Faye offers to help her. They go together back to Wade's house and they undo the spell, but nothing seems to happen. They leave the house but when Wade is back, Heather wakes up, knocks him down and leaves. She is getting to Cassie's house, looking for Amelia to help her but she only finds Cassie. Heather tries to explain her about demons but while she is doing it, demons take control of her and she is attacking Cassie and later Faye who's upstairs. Meanwhile, Diana is showing Adam what she found in her Book of Shadows about Heather's mark and that it's connected with demons and black magic. They try to call Cassie to let her know so she won't attempt to undo the spell but it's too late. Nick (Louis Hunter) and Melissa (Jessica Parker Kennedy), who are at Nick's room, see from the window that Cassie and Faye are in danger and they get there to help them. Nick manages to fights back the possessed Heather. Heather is running into the street and gets hit by a car. All these leave the members of the Circle with more questions of what happened sixteen years ago on that boat and how their parents died and an unleashed demon that (in the form of a black snake) gets out of Heather's dead body and gets into Melissa's at the end of the episode.

It is situated in the Sorbonne building. It is a medieval institution of the Sorbonne, which evolved over the centuries as part of the University of Paris. It is a common library of Panth√©on-Sorbonne University, Sorbonne-Nouvelle University, Sorbonne University, Paris Descartes University, and Paris Diderot University. It is administered by Panth√©on-Sorbonne University as per a governing agreement signed among these universities in 2000. The Sorbonne Library is located at 47, rue des √âcoles in the Latin Quarter in the 5th arrondissement. The library of the , located at 191 rue Saint-Jacques, is attached. History Robert de Sorbon ;Library of the Ancient College de Sorbonne, (1289-1795) The college of theology, Maison de Sorbonne, was established at the Coll√®ge de Sorbonne in 1257 by Robert de Sorbon. Its library, the Library of the Coll√®ge de Sorbonne was founded in 1289. In the 1700s, the Jesuits, before leaving the Sorbonne, gave away their buildings and books to the University of Paris. In 1791, during the French Revolution, the library disbanded, and the books (of which there were 25,000 volumes on the eve of the Revolution) were distributed to other libraries. After the Revolution, the Sorbonne was rebuilt at the location of the medieval buildings. In the late 1800s, after the Napoleonic era, the library of the university started functioning from the Biblioth√®que de la Sorbonne. ;Library of the University of Paris (1770-present) In 1770, almost five centuries after the Library of the Coll√®ge de Sorbonne was founded, the Library of the University of Paris was established. At the time, it was situated on the campus of the Lyc√©e Louis-le-Grand. The initial fonds were acquired from the library of the rector and Cartesian philosophy professor, Jean-Gabriel Petit de Montempuis, collections of the college library, and others from 28 Parisian colleges, supplemented by purchases. The Lyc√©e Louis-le-Grand closed in 1793 and the library materials were moved to a d√©p√¥t litt√©raire named \\"Louis la Culture\\" at the Saint-Paul-Saint-Louis Church. Some manuscripts were taken to the Biblioth√®que nationale de France, but the d√©p√¥t was enriched with other materials, including those confiscated from the Princes of Cond√©, the House of Roug√©, and House of Montmorency. In 1796, it was decided to move the books from the \\"Louis la Culture.\\" With the creation of schools in 1802, the library was renamed the \\"Paris School Library\\" In 1808, it was renamed the \\"Library of the University of France\\". During the period of 1816-21, the faculties of theology, sciences and literature merged, adding their libraries to the Sorbonne Library. In 1823, the library moved across the rue Saint-Jacques to settle in the current building, constructed in the seventeenth century. Philippe Le Bas was head librarian from 1844 until 1860. He was noted for significant acquisitions, reorganization of collections, and the creation of five divisions. The library was deeded to the city of Paris in 1857, and five years later, the library used the name \\"University Library of France.\\" Leon Renier, who succeeded Le Bas as head librarian (1860‚Äì85), continued with Le Bas' policies. Henri Paul N√©not designed the \\"new Sorbonne\\" which was built from 1885 to 1901, though its collections moved there in 1897; it provided seating for 300. By a decree of 28 June 1910, the Sorbonne Library became attached to the \\"Library of the University of Paris.\\" From 1930 to 1970, the Sorbonne Library served as the head library of the University of Paris, and had a head librarian. In 1970, its modern scientific collections (since about 1945) were transferred to Saint-Victor (renamed Jussieu Campus), which formed the Interuniversity Scientific Library Jussieu (Biblioth√®que interuniversitaire scientifique de Jussieu). In 1972, the Sorbonne Library merged with the Library of art and archeology, the Biblioth√®que Sainte-Genevi√®ve, and the Library for sick students. But six years later, it separated, returning to the name, Sorbonne Library. Additions were the Library of the Institute of Geography and the Victor Cousin Library. In September 2010, restoration work began at the Sorbonne, estimated to last until October or November 2013. Funded by the City of Paris, owner of the premises, the aim was to redevelop the library premises and improve security. This included the creation of a single storey hall with Richelieu and Sorbon galleries, as well as new reading rooms. The project forced the relocation of collections and the reopening of the library at the Biblioth√®que Sainte-Barbe from May 2010 to May 2013 when the library collections were moving back to the Sorbonne building site. The Biblioth√®que de la Sorbonne reopened on November 2013. The Library is normally open six days a week : Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday 09.00 - 20.00 / Thursday 12.00 - 20.00 / Saturday 10.00 - 19.00 From July to September 15 : Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday : 10.00 - 19.00 / Thursday : 12.00 - 19.00 Architecture and fittings The library is situated at the Sorbonne building. It overlooks the courtyard, opposite the main entrance. The reading room is on the first floor of the main building. With a length of , it features five cross sections overlooking the courtyard. In the center are the librarians' offices and courtyard. There are 264 seats in the reading room. The library of Victor Cousin is on the second floor. Collections The library consists of five sections: *The Letters Section and Sciences Section are at the Sorbonne. *The Medicine Section, located at the Faculty of Medicine, will be the new Interuniversity Library of Medicine. *The Pharmacy Section, located at the Faculty of Pharmacy, will be in the new Interuniversity Library of Pharmacy. *The Law Section, located within the Paris Law Faculty, is in the Cujas Library. Within the general humanities and social sciences, the Sorbonne Library has however developed some areas of excellence: history (excluding contemporary history), geography, philosophy and French literature. In these areas, it has acquisitions in French and foreign languages. The library also acquired documents in religious sciences, and English language and literature, German, Spanish and Italian. It contains about three million volumes, with more than 18,000 printed theses and 15,000 on microfiche, 17,750 paper periodicals titles of which 4,370 still exist (among them a large majority in foreign languages), as well as a broad selection of electronic journals. Sorbon left his volumes to the college collections. By 1289, there were over 1000 volumes, by the late 15th century, there were over 2,500 volumes, and in 1789, there were nearly 25,000 printed volumes plus over 2,000 manuscripts. Of its ancient or precious fonds, the library owns more than 2,500 manuscripts, as well as the archives of the former University of Paris, with more than 5,000 prints and more than 400,000 ancient books. The Victor Cousin Library includes nearly 500 manuscripts and 30,000 printed works. The Richelieu Collection includes the archives of the family of Richelieu, including Armand de Vignerot du Plessis, Duc de Richelieu and Armand-Emmanuel de Vignerot du Plessis, Duc de Richelieu. By 1990, the library had almost a million volumes covering all departments of the university. By 2005, the number of books had increased to 2.5 million under 17,750 headings with 3,500 manuscripts. It has 7,100 graphics and pictures; every year an additional 1,000 to 12,000 volumes are added. The collection occupies 40 km of shelf space.

Tidal Wave is a Shoot-the-Chutes water ride at Six Flags Magic Mountain in Valencia, California. The ride is located in the Metropolis portion of the park. The ride's theme is related to a tropical environment featuring several palms and trees. The entrance to the ride is next to The Riddler's Revenge which is near to JB's Smokehouse BBQ. The ride is open from the spring season to late September. The ride temporarily closes in early October for Magic Mountain's annual Fright Fest event; the ride's line is used for a maze. During the winter months, the ride is closed to drain the water and clean the ride along with the splash area. The entrance to the Flash Pass is located at the right side exit of the ride. The ride has two large boats which seat a maximum of 20 riders. Both of the boats are typically used every day. History Tidal Wave opened in 1989 after there was demand for another water ride in the north section of the park. The park's first log flume, the Log Jammer, opened in 1971 near the entrance of the park. One year later, Jet Stream, a water flume ride featuring a drop opened near Goldrusher's entrance. While Six Flags Magic Mountain already had two flume rides, the park was missing a shoot-the-chutes ride. Construction began after the tracks of Granny Gran Prix were removed in order to make room for the new water ride. When Tidal Wave opened in 1989, it drew a lot of crowds into the Movie District area. Ever since the ride opened in 1989, the ride has undergone no changes.In 1990, the ride made an appearance in the Kidsongs episode Ride the Roller Coaster. In 2017, Tidal Wave closed for maintenance so a new entrance could be added. The ride reopened along with Justice League: Battle for Metropolis on June 12, 2017. Ride Tidal Wave features one drop which ends in a large body of water which creates a large splash. The 20-seat boat is dispatched from the station and it proceeds by going up a conveyor belt. As the boat ascends up, many riders enjoy seeing the right side of Tidal Wave to see the overall track of Green Lantern: First Flight. Once at the top of the lift hill, the boat begins turning left 180 degrees. During this stage, the boat gains some speed in order to prepare for the drop. Once the boat is at this point, it begins dropping down the drop. One of the unique features of Tidal Wave's drop is that it is not completely straight down. The drop features a small bump which gives the boat more speed and creates more thrill to the riders. Once the boat approaches the large body of water, the boat produces of wave water over . The boat then proceeds moving slowly along the flume and turns 180 degrees to the left to enter the station. Height requirements In order for guests to ride Tidal Wave, riders must be at least .

His first professional tournament was in May 1940 as a wrestler for the former incarnation of Tokitsukaze stable, which was a leftover from the days of Osaka sumo. The stable soon closed however, and he transferred to Tatsunami stable. He tried out a number of ring names before settling on Tokitsuyama to honor the defunct stable he originally debuted for. Celebrating his tournament win in May 1953 He was a weak wrestler at first, and he was not able to actually be listed on the sumo ranking sheet known as the banzuke until the January tournament of 1943. He did not really bloom as a strong competitor until after returning as a soldier from World War II. In the 1946 tournament (the only one held that year) he achieved a 7‚Äì0 perfect record and also took the championship in the makushita division. Expectations surrounding him began to rise after this. He was promoted to the salaried ranks of j≈´ry≈ç in the following summer tournament of 1947. He was promoted to the top division makuuchi in May 1949, but received a losing record and fell back to j≈´ry≈ç. He was soon back in makuuchi though, and in September 1950 at maegashira 21 he achieved a 12‚Äì3 record and the Fighting Spirit Prize. He was a top division regular from then on. Almost three years later, in May 1953 he achieved his one and only top division championship with a perfect 15‚Äì0 record. However, as he was only ranked at maegashira 6, the highest ranked opponent he faced that tournament was a komusubi and the two ≈çzeki at the time Yoshibayama and Tochinishiki, who also had winning streaks in that tournament, never had a chance to face him to even the odds. In the January 1955 tournament he was in a similar situation at maegashira 9. He was in position to win the championship on the final day of the tournament, but this time had to face yokozuna Chiyonoyama in a playoff, which he lost. He was a consistent makuuchi wrestler for many years after this, but began to decline after 1960. Retirement from sumo Tokisuyama retired before the 1961 March tournament rather than face demotion to j≈´ry≈ç. He remained in the sumo world after his retirement as an elder of the Japan Sumo Association under the name of Oshiogawa, but died of liver cancer at age 43 in November 1968. Fighting style During his career, Tokitsuyama was known for using a variety of techniques such as lifting and inner-thigh throws, and would often twist and turn even the strongest opponents all over the dohy≈ç. This reliance on such techniques also led to inconsistency, and though he was a formidable opponent, he never had more than 12 wins in any tournament besides his championship tournament and was never promoted above sekiwake. Regardless, he was part of a group of well-known top division wrestlers from his same Tatsunami stable at this time, namely Wakahaguro, Annenyama and Kitanonada who were popularly known then as the Four Heavenly Kings, a Buddhist reference.

A well-educated and capable man, he advanced rapidly in the imperial hierarchy from imperial secretary (grammatikos) to the influential post of kanikleios, keeper of the imperial inkstand. In he engineered the downfall of John Hagiotheodorites, and succeeded him as mesazon, the de facto chief minister of the Empire. He long enjoyed the favour and trust of Manuel, who even wed him with his niece Eudokia. However, in 1158/59, Styppeiotes abruptly fell from power and was imprisoned and blinded. The sources provide different reasons, from Styppeiotes conspiring to deprive the Emperor of power to the machinations of his rival, John Kamateros, and scholars still dispute the true background of this event. Life The origin and early life of Theodore Styppeiotes are unknown. From references in the poems of Theodore Prodromos, he was possibly born in , and likely descended from a relatively wealthy family. His relation to the earlier Sty[p]peiotai of the 10th and 11th centuries is unclear, but he may be related‚Äîpossibly a grandson, according to Konstantinos Varzos‚Äîto the military commander Michael Stypeiotes, who served under Alexios I Komnenos (). In his youth, Styppeiotes received an extensive education, with the court poet Theodore Prodromos among his teachers. The relationship between Styppeiotes and Prodromos was close; in a poem written after his pupil's spectacular rise to power, Prodromos lauds him as \\"the best of grammarians and students and friends\\", and for his trustworthiness as a scribe in guarding secrets. =Rise to power= Following the completion of his education, at a relatively young age, he was given a posting as the Emperor's grammatikos or secretary in the imperial chancery, a position that required highly educated and skilled men, who were responsible, among other duties, for the elaborate preface (prooimion) attached to imperial edicts and charters. Styppeiotes rapidly rose in the imperial court, becoming the assistant of the then chief minister (mesazon), John Hagiotheodorites. He then exploited a quarrel between two aristocrats, Michael Palaiologos and Joseph Balsamon, the brother-in-law of Hagiotheodorites, to dispose of the latter. At Styppeiotes' instigation, Hagiotheodorites was appointed as the civil governor (praetor) of the joint theme of Hellas and the Peloponnese and sent to deal with the quarrel. With his superior removed, Styppeiotes continued his ascent, reaching the position of kanikleios, guardian of the imperial inkstand, in 1150/51. This position, due to the close proximity to the emperor it afforded, made Styppeiotes extremely influential. Styppeiotes amassed other lofty titles and offices: in the protocols of a synod in May 1157 he is listed as a protonotarios, and in November 1158 as a dikaiodotes. Standing high in Manuel's favour, Styppeiotes became the effective mesazon, head of the civil administration. According to the near-contemporary official and historian, Niketas Choniates, thenceforth Styppeiotes \\"administered public affairs as he wished, profoundly wise, prudent, pleasant in manner, and soaring in political judgment. He agreed to whatever the emperor commanded and commanded whatever the emperor wished.\\" So powerful was his position, that he could \\"move all things by merely pointing his finger and nodding\\", and his every wish became reality. His power is eloquently evoked in the poems addressed to him by Prodromos, and in a flattering letter sent in 1155 by the Metropolitan of Ephesus, George Tornikes, seeking his support. In , Emperor Manuel gave his trusted minister the hand of his niece Eudokia (born ), who had been left an orphan some time previously. The couple had a number of children, but only the name of one of them, Manuel‚Äîprobably the firstborn‚Äîis known from a series of poems and dedications to his \\"miraculous\\" survival from a fall during infancy. =Downfall= In 1158/59, however, while on campaign in Cilicia, Manuel ordered Styppeiotes to be arrested and blinded. The reasons for this act are unclear, with different reasons being given by contemporary authors. According to John Kinnamos he publicly announced some kind of prophecy according to which Manuel would die soon, and that \\"the Roman senate should no longer grant power to a strapping young man, but to a man of properly advanced years, in order that under him, ruling by the letter [or by learning] the affairs of state might be managed as in a democracy\\". The German chronicler Rahewin, on the other hand, reports that the kanikleios had hired three men to assassinate Manuel, but that the empress discovered the plot and informed the emperor. Choniates gives a rather different account, which according to the historian Paul Magdalino may represent the \\"unofficial\\" version of the affair, but the details of which were proven to be mostly fictitious by the Byzantinist Otto Kresten. According to Choniates, Styppeiotes' downfall was the result of his rivalry with John Kamateros, the logothetes tou dromou, who became frustrated with the special relationship between Styppeiotes and the emperor; Styppeiotes's goals were being fulfilled through his constant ties to Manuel while Kamateros's limited access to the emperor resulted in his demands never being met. Kamateros therefore forged a correspondence between Styppeiotes and the Norman king of Sicily, William II (), which he hid so that it could be discovered easily. Styppeiotes was ultimately charged with treason by Kamateros, resulting in Emperor Manuel having Styppeiotes blinded and his tongue severed. Styppeiotes' downfall coincided with the blinding of Michael Glykas and the escape of the emperor's cousin and future emperor Andronikos I Komnenos (), and although the Byzantine sources make no explicit connection, it is very likely connected to both events. As a result it may indicate, according to Magdalino, both the existence of a faction at court which desired a return to a more consensus-based mode of ruling, with the emperor consulting with the Senate as was the practice before the rise of the Komnenoi, as well as of a pro-Sicilian faction opposed to Manuel's pro-German stance, manifested in his alliance with the Hohenstaufen and reinforced by his empress, Bertha of Sulzbach. The fate of Styppeiotes after his dismissal, as those of his wife and children, are unknown.

They were appointed under a 1662 Act of the Parliament of England (14 Car. 2 c. 2) which expired in 1679. The Commissioners' office was attached to that of the Surveyor of the King's Works in Scotland Yard. The 1662 Act empowered the king to appoint up to 21 commissioners, who were authorised to: * Determine encroachments by buildings onto the highway * Manage the repair and paving of specific streets, including Pall Mall * Enlarge various other specific streets, including St Martins Lane, and to demolish existing buildings where necessary and compensate the owners * Levy charges on each householder to fund repair, paving and enlargement work * License, tax and set maximum fares for hackney carriages * Charge duty on hay and straw sold in city streets To combat an apparent problem with people throwing coal ashes into the street, the act also required every person in London, Westminster, Southwark and surrounding suburbs to sweep the area in front of their house \\"... every Wednesday and every Saturday in the Weeke\\". The act also prohibited the hooping of barrels and sawing of stones or rough timber in the streets. Rakers and scavengers were to use \\"... a Bell Horne Clapper or otherwise [and] shall make distinct and loud noise and give notice to the Inhabitants of theire coming ...\\" so \\"... that all persons concerned may bring forth theire respective Ashes Dust Dirt Filth and Soil to the respective Carts or Carriages\\". These scavengers were to be elected according to existing customs, and within 20 days rubbish collection rates (to be paid quarterly) were to be set by churchwardens and other leaders of the parish. Under the act, \\"... from Michaelmas until our Lady day ...\\" (29 September - 25 March) from dusk to 9 p.m. every householder was required to place a candle or lantern outside \\"... his house next the street to enlighten the same for Passengers ...\\". The act also ratified a decision by sewer commissioners on 8 August 1661 to construct two new sewers to drain the area near the Palace of Whitehall. After the Great Fire of London in 1666, several Acts to promote rebuilding vested the power of paving and sewer maintenance within the city solely in its Corporation.18&19 Ch.II. c.8 section 18; 22&23 Ch.II c.17 section 2. This restricted the Scotland Yard Commissioners to areas outside the city.

Instead, powers of enforcing compliance were given to the justices of the peace. Sewerage in Westminster was transferred to the existing Westminster and Middlesex Commission of Sewers. Members and officers As well as the 21 commissioners appointed by the king, the act provided that the Lord Mayor, Recorder, and Aldermen of the City of London; and the Dean, High Steward, Deputy Steward and the two High Burgesses of the City of Westminster should become joint commissioners with the same powers. Charles Sackville, 6th Earl of Dorset was one of the initial Commissioners, as was the diarist John Evelyn, who described his fellows as \\"divers gentlemen of quality\\". Some MPs were commissioners, including John Ashburnham, Anthony Ashley-Cooper, Charles Berkeley, later Viscount Fitzhardinge, John Denham, William Glascock, Ranald Grahme, Robert Howard, Thomas Ingram, Daniel O'Neill, Richard Onslow, and Edmund Waller.

Originally published in 1799, two further editions were released in Schleiermacher's lifetime in 1806 and 1831. Schleiermacher wrote On Religion while teaching and preaching in Berlin. The Enlightenment had invigorated scientific and historical research, overshadowing theology in the university. In this work, Schleiermacher defends religion against the skepticism of a modern audience.  Composition  Since the early age of 15, Schleiermacher had been personally grappling with the most significant issues of Christology, particularly his own doubt in regard to the problem of atonement. He entered a Moravian seminary in Barby, Saxony in 1785, only to lead to his eventual expulsion for engaging in heretical philosophic discourse. He left for the University of Halle and completed his first theological examination some five years later. Following his graduation, Schleiermacher took up a teaching post in Berlin in 1793 and joined the Charity Hospital in 1796 as a regular preacher.Mackintosh, pp. 32‚Äì33 = Intellectual climate of Berlin = Schleiermacher was writing around the time the Enlightenment was in full swing and arguably when the first major transition into modernity was simultaneously occurring. With the fall of the late Middle Ages and a vigorous discourse taking hold of Western European intellectuals, the fields of art and natural philosophy were flourishing. However, the discourse of theologians, arguably the primary and only discourse of intellectuals for centuries, had taken to its own now minor corner in the universities. This backdrop is evident in the first line of Schleiermacher's text, \\"It may be an unexpected and even a marvelous undertaking, that any one should still venture to demand from the very class that have raised themselves above the vulgar, and are saturated with the wisdom of the centuries, attention for a subject so entirely neglected by them. ... Now especially the life of cultivated people is far from anything that might have even a resemblance to religion.\\"Schleiermacher p. 1Schleiermacher, pp. vii‚Äìxx  Contents  On Religion is divided into five major sections: the Defense (Apologie), the Nature of Religion (√úber das Wesen der Religion), the Cultivation of Religion (√úber die Bildung zur Religion), Association in Religion (√úber das Gesellige in der Religion, oder √ºber Kirche und Priesterthum), and the Religions (√úber die Religionen). = Defense (Apologie) = The Defense (Apologie) characterizes the four following speeches by Schleiermacher laying out of his anthropology of religion. He states, \\"[T]here are two points of view from which everything taking place in man or proceeding from him may be regarded. Considered from the centre outwards, that is according to its inner quality, it is an expression of human nature, based in one of its necessary modes of acting or impulses ... [R]egarded from the outside, according to the definite attitude and form it assumes in particular cases, it is a product of time and history.\\"Schleiermacher, p. 13  Legacy  Schleiermacher is perhaps best known outside of Germany for being the \\"father of modern Protestant theology\\", focusing his attention not on the institutional values of Christianity but on the nature of religious experience from the perspective of the individual and human nature itself, a product most of the prevalence of German Romanticism. The phrase \\"cultured despisers\\" has also seen reuse in scholarship since the authorship of On Religion in the late nineteenth century.

It is considered to be one of the most impressive college museums in the country. The museum is best known for its compilation of American and European art of the 19th and 20th centuries, including works by Edgar Degas, Jean- Baptiste-Camille Corot, Gustave Courbet, Paul C√©zanne, Claude Monet, Georges Seurat, Albert Bierstadt, John Singer Sargent and others. First established in 1879, the collection has expanded to include nearly 25,000 works of art, including a diverse collection of non-Western art. It is also a member of the Museums10 collective, a consortium of art, science, and history museums in Western Massachusetts. The SCMA serves as an important cultural and educational resource for the communities of Smith College, the Five College Consortium, and the town of Northampton. Building history The Brown Fine Arts Center, which opened in 2003 after a two-year, $35 million building renovation, now houses the art library, Art Department, and the Smith College Museum of Art. Designed by the New York City-based Polshek Partnership Architects (now known as Ennead Architects, the 164,000-gross-square-foot (15,236m¬≤) building metaphorically and physically links the college with its neighboring community. Collections The SCMA has an extensive collection including paintings, sculptures, works on paper (prints, drawings, photographs and books), antiquities, decorative arts, and Asian, African and Islamic art. The museum contains four floors of galleries that house the permanent collection, the Cunningham Center for the Study of Prints, Drawings and Photographs, and rotating exhibitions. The center houses more than 1,600 drawings, over 5,700 photographs spanning the history of the museum, and an extensive collection of more than 8,000 prints by artists from Albrecht D√ºrer to contemporary printmakers. In addition, the museum also features two bathrooms designed by artists Ellen Driscoll and Sandy Skoglund to represent functional art. Reflective of Smith's diverse student body and campaign to raise awareness of underrepresented groups of women, the museum has been actively procuring artworks by female artists and female artists of color. Notable figures represented in the collection include Betye Saar, Marja Vallila, Susan Rothenberg, Carmen Lomas Garza, and Nursa Latif Qureshi. The current director and chief curator is Jessica Nicoll. Department of Art History The History of Art degree at Smith College, initiated by President Seelye in the 1870s, has evolved to become one of the most respected programs in American undergraduate education today. Notable professors and art historical \\"greats\\" that have taught here include Henry-Russel Hitchcock, Adolph Katzenellenbogen, Oliver Larkin, Rensselaer Wright Lee, Phyllis Williams Lehmann, Charles Rufus Morey, Edgar Wind and alumna Harriet Boyd Hawes. In the 10th International Congress of Art Historians, which took place in Rome in 1912, Smith was one of the only 68 American institutions of higher learning with a professorship in art history, out of a total of approximately 400 colleges and universities surveyed. The museum is often utilized as a learning space for Smith students, especially for those who enroll in art and art history classes.

The platform used a proprietary algorithm to analyze user profiles and provide suggestions for potential band members and industry professional connections. Turkish entrepreneur and musician Emir Turan founded Giggem in 2012. History Turan released a beta version of Giggem in 2012 with $150,000 in seed funding. The service was officially launched in 2013. A TechCrunch article from June 2013 stated that investment by founder Emir Turan had reached $600,000. In September 2013 Giggem introduced venue and promoter profiles, opening up the service to users such as \\"bars, nightclubs, concert halls, arenas, event organizers and promoters.\\" Also in September 2013, Giggem won the JCI Turkey Chapter's Creative Young Entrepreneur Award. Following the award, the company's founder will attend an award ceremony in Copenhagen to compete to be the world winner. In September 2015 Giggem announced that it was closing down. Services Giggem's social networking service is designed to automatically match musicians with other musicians, bands and industry professionals based on the info on their profiles. Giggem allows users to create comprehensive r√©sum√© like profiles for themselves. Information is extracted from the profiles by Giggem's algorithm, resulting in relevant connection suggestions. The service is available to solo musicians, bands, managers, record labels, songwriters, promoters and venues as of September 2013. Giggem offers three primary features: opportunity notifications of matching users, seeking feeds and profile view analytics. User profiles can link to relevant media content like SoundCloud files or YouTube videos and include information such as a who the musician or band is looking for, their experience level, dedication, age, and instruments. A July 2013 article in Guitar World noted that Giggem is \\"the industry's first comprehensive and cohesive platform dedicated to helping musicians find one another, be discovered by managers and labels, as well as promote their music, videos and career highlights.\\" Auditions In July 2013 Giggem launched an Audition feature for bands. The feature allows bands to evaluate potential band members based on an online audition. Bands initiate auditions by selecting a desired band position and then specifying location and genre. The auditions can be public or private (invite-only). Once started, an audition is published on the site and relevant musicians get notified about the audition for applying to participate in it. An Audition goes through two periods: an Application Period and a Reply Period. During the Application Period, bands can invite musicians to audition, and musicians can apply to participate. During the Reply Period, all approved musicians are presented with a specific musical task to record a video of themselves performing that particular task and add it on the Audition platform before the deadline given by the band. After all the replies are gathered, the band has the option to select one of the participants to be their new member or open another audition. Algorithm and search functionality The firm's algorithm analyzes the information contained within user profiles and suggests potential connections between musicians, bands and industry professionals. After a user has created his profile, the system sends a message to relevant users notifying them that someone matching their interests and needs is available. Users can also conduct a custom search of Giggem profiles to identify potential band members and collaborations. Giggem's georeferencing tools utilize a user's IP address to suggest connections that are geographically close to the user.

It arose as a result of the death of the sitting member, Richard Power of the Irish Parliamentary Party. Background The by-election arose in a period when the Irish Parliamentary Party was still suffering the effects of the split that arose after a majority of its MPs objected to the continued leadership of Charles Stewart Parnell. The anti-Parnellite group had won a series of by-elections against Parnellite candidates, and even though Parnell himself had died the bitter feelings that had arisen meant no reunion of the factions was in prospect. Richard Power had been one of the supporters of Parnell, and when John Redmond, the leading member of the Parnellite group, failed to win the leader's former seat in Cork City, having resigned his own North Wexford seat to do run in the resulting by-election, the Waterford City constituency was a natural choice for a return to Parliament. In municipal elections held the previous month in the city, Parnellites won all four contested seats.The Times, 27 November 1891 The campaign After Redmond announced that he would stand as Parnellite candidateThe Times, 5 December 1891 there were signs that he would be unopposed. Michael Davitt, a prominent member of the Anti-Parnellite group, wrote to the newspapers suggesting there be no opposition 'to make the occasion one of reconciliation and unity' since there would be a general election in the following year, and Archbishop Walsh of Dublin recommended postponing the contest until after the Christmas period.The Times, 8 December 1891 The Parnellites, however, conscious of their strong standing in the constituency, pressed on with their campaign.The Times, 11 December 1891 Responding to Davitt's letter a week later, Redmond stated that 'he had hoped that there was something sincere in the suggestion,' but that 'it had been discarded and a contest was forced on the constituency'. A Mr Keane, a wine merchant, was being proposed as the Anti-Parnellite candidate. It was reported that Davitt had been asked to stand, but had refused.The Times, 12 December 1891 Events took a dramatic turn a few days later, when a large anti-Parnellite meeting was held in the town. When a group of supporters crossed the city's toll bridge they came under attack from Parnellite supporters. \\"A general fight ensued\\", the Times reported, \\"and the factions beat each other in a violent and sometimes brutal manner\\". Michael Davitt was struck violently, and blood had to be wiped from his face with handkerchiefs. Hundreds of police had been drafted in, in anticipation of trouble, and had to intervene, \\"and batoned each party indiscriminately\\". When Davitt addressed the meeting, he insisted that he had come \\"to use what little influence he possessed on the side of quietness, peacefulness and good temper\\" but that in response to the day's events he had decided to agree to be the Anti-Parnellite candidate. It was reported that Redmond, on hearing of the assault on Davitt, called at his hotel to express regret at the incident.The Times 14 December 1891 A key element of the electorate were the working class voters in the city. Redmond, addressing the workers in local bacon-curing factories, told them not to be deceived into thinking Davitt was the candidate of the working man, because he was \\"prepared to accept anything that Gladstone and the Liberal Party choose to give\\". William O'Brien, addressing a closed meeting of Anti-Parnellite supporters, told them Davitt was \\"the candidate of the people's hearts\\" and that Redmond and his allies were \\"absolutely dependent on the Tories\\".The Times 15 December 1891 The next day, when Davitt wanted to address workers in the city's pork cellars, they closed the gates and refused to meet him. Nevertheless, he announced that the promises of support he had received led him to believe he would be returned with a large majority. It was reported that the police had reduced their presence as they did not expect a repeat of the earlier violence.The Times 16 December 1891. There were accounts that Davitt and his supporters were having difficulty getting rooms in which to have meetings, and that trade union premises and working men's clubs were closed to him. It was difficult to get local men to work on his campaign, and had to depend on clerical support.The Times 17 December 1891. The voting On the eve of polling, Davitt told the press he expected a majority of up to 100 votes; Redmond announced that he was expecting a majority of around 500, \\"and allows for 800 broken promises\\".The Times 23 December 1891 The Times predicted a Redmond victory, though with a smaller majority, and observed that \\"it was not unusual during the progress of this election campaign to find the people hiss the priests as they conducted a canvass\\".The Times 24 December 1891 Redmond's estimates turned out to be accurate: when the votes were counted, he had won 1,775 votes and Davitt had 1,229, a Parnellite majority of 546.The New House of Commons, July 1892: With Biographical Notices of its Members (Macmillan, 1892) page 266.The Constitutional Year Book, 1904, published by Conservative Central Office, page 194 (218 in web page) The result was significant: for the first time since the split, a Parnellite candidate won a by-election. All previous contests had been won with large majorities for the Anti-Parnellite camp. The Anti- Parnellites continued to win a large part of the Irish vote, but Redmond would eventually be the first leader of the reunited party, in the 1900 general election.

Her husband, David Knotek, was also convicted of the murder of her 19-year-old nephew Shane Watson, who lived with the Knoteks. Michelle is also suspected of possible involvement in the death of James McClintock, an 81-year-old whose assets she inherited after he died of head trauma incurred while Knotek was employed as his caregiver on February 9, 2002. Michelle Knotek was sentenced to 22 years in prison, which she is serving at the Washington Corrections Center for Women in Gig Harbor, under Department of Corrections ID: 865733. Her husband David Knotek, after serving a would-be 15-year prison sentence at the Monroe Correctional Complex, was paroled in 2018 after serving 15 years. The Knoteks' crimes made national headlines due to allegations of abuse and torture.  Victims  = Kathy Loreno, 36 = Kathy Loreno was a hairdresser working in South Bend, Washington, when she met Michelle Knotek, and the two became friends. In 1991 after an argument between Loreno and her family, Loreno moved out of their home and into the home of Michelle and David Knotek. During her stay at the Knoteks' home, it was alleged that Loreno suffered physical abuse. In 1994, Loreno was reported missing by family members. When interviewed by authorities, the Knoteks stated that Loreno had run away with a truck driver and moved to Hawaii. Michelle Knotek maintained that she and Loreno were in regular contact. However, a private investigator hired by Loreno's brother concluded that she had probably been murdered by Michelle Knotek. David Knotek claimed that Loreno died by asphyxiating on her own vomit, but he did not take her to a hospital or report her death to police because of the physical injuries to Loreno's body. = Shane Watson, 19 = Shane Watson, born in 1975 in Tacoma, was Michelle Knotek's nephew. Watson moved in with the Knoteks around 1988. Shortly after Loreno's disappearance in 1994, Watson seemingly vanished too. The Knoteks initially claimed that Watson had run away to Alaska to work on a fishing vessel. David Knotek later claimed that he had shot Watson with a .22 caliber rifle. Investigators alleged that David Knotek killed Watson because Michelle was enraged that Watson took pictures documenting the abuse of Loreno. David Knotek also stated that he burned the bodies of Shane Watson and Kathy Loreno and scattered their ashes at the beach. = Ronald Woodworth, 57 = Ronald Woodworth was a local man who went to live with the Knoteks around 2001. Like Kathy Loreno, Woodworth was also subject to severe physical abuse. Witnesses described seeing Woodworth being forced to do chores outside wearing only his underwear, and to jump from the second story roof onto gravel, wearing nothing on his feet causing broken bones and severe lacerations. They also claimed that Michelle Knotek would burn Woodworth's injured feet with boiling water and pure bleach. Woodworth went missing in 2003. David Knotek later admitted to burying Woodworth's body on their property after Michelle told him that Woodworth had committed suicide. An autopsy performed by the King County medical examiner proved that Woodworth's death was murder.  Prison  The Pacific County Deputy Prosecutor stated that Michelle Knotek showed \\"extreme indifference to human life\\". Michelle was charged with two counts of first-degree murder in the deaths of Kathy Loreno and Ronald Woodworth. David Knotek was charged with first-degree murder in the death of Shane Watson. He was also charged with rendering criminal assistance and unlawful disposal of human remains. Through plea negotiations, both Knoteks pleaded guilty to lesser charges in 2004. Michelle Knotek entered an Alford plea, in which she did not admit responsibility but acknowledged the prosecutor's case against her. She pleaded guilty to one count of second-degree murder and one count of manslaughter. While an initial agreement with prosecutors would have sent her to prison for 17 years, Judge Mark McCauley sentenced her to 22 years in prison. David Knotek was sentenced to 15 years in prison for the second-degree murder of Shane Watson. He was released from prison in 2016 and works at a seafood processing plant on the Washington Coast. The daughters, with the exception of Nikki, occasionally communicate with him, but not with their mother, because they believe any contact with her would endanger them and their families. Michelle Knotek later tried to have her convictions overturned, but her appeal was denied by the Washington Court of Appeals.  In the media  The Knotek cases have been featured on several television programs, including Wicked Attraction, Sins and Secrets and Snapped. A book by true crime author Gregg Olsen, If You Tell: A True Story of Murder, Family Secrets, and the Unbreakable Bond of Sisterhood, was published in 2019.

She was a member and director of the Panamanian Academy of Language, and President of the Linguistic Club of Panama.

Contributions to language studies Ricord was an authority and a reference point in the Spanish language studies. During her time in the Panamanian Language Academy, she was a linguistic mediator and made recommendations about certain words and Spanish idiomatic expressions. She was in favour of the word ‚Äúenantes‚Äù, widely used in the Panamanian everyday lexicon, but rejected by a large number of people because it is consider an archaism. Her argument was that the word ‚Äúenantes‚Äù has never fallen into disuse in Panama, whereby, this term should not be censure, nor considered an archaism. Likewise, she submitted her opposition to the elimination of the letters ch and ll from the Spanish alphabet, and defended her posture in the XI Language Congress in San Jos√©, Costa Rica and in Madrid in 1994.

Early life Ostyn was born in Nieuwekerke, in the province of West Flanders, Belgium, the second of four children born to Maurice Joseph Ostyn (died 1940) and Madeleine Vanden Weeghe (died 25 March 1968). Maurice Ostyn died during the Battle of Dunquerq at age 42 on 29 May 1940 in Veurne, apparently by friendly fire after going upstairs and leaving his family behind in the basement where they were seeking shelter. His mother then with her four sons fled West-Flanders and settled in Leuven in the Belgian province of Brabant. It is there that Michel later would attend the Catholic University of Leuven. Academic career Michel 'Mic' Ostyn studied medicine at the Catholic University of Leuven from which he graduated in 1951. Following his studies in medicine, Ostyn also successfully completed a Master's ('Licentiate') Degree in Occupational Medicine at the University's Hoger Institute van de Arbeid in 1955.Ostyn, Michel. Huidige stand der BAL- Therapie. Thesis M.Sc. in Occupational Medicine. Louvain, Belgium: University of Louvain, Faculty of Medicine & HIVA (Higher Institute for Occupational Medicine). 1956, pp. 1-43. [in Dutch] After graduating he quit running though. His talent as an athlete and physician and his outspoken interests in physiology and sports medicine caught the eye of physiologist Pierre-Paul De Nayer, the Founding Dean of the university's Institute for Physical Education (ILO). De Nayer convinced Ostyn to stay at the university and build out a career in sports medicine.Delheye Pascal, Ameye Thomas, Vangrunderbeek, Hans. In I.L.O. tempore. Verbeeld verleden van de Faculteit Bewegings- en Revalidatiewetenschappen aan de Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, 1937-2007. Leuven: UPL in Context. 2008, 240 p. [in Dutch] In 1955 Ostyn became a laureate of the Belgian Academy of Medicine after a study about the physiology of exercise.Ostyn, Michel. Studie over de lichamelijke inspanning in het kader van het Algemeen Adaptatiesyndroom van Selye [Study about physical exercise in the context of Selye‚Äôs General Adaptation Syndrome]. Brussels: Paleis der Academi√´n, Royal Flemish Academy of Medicine of Belgium, Monographs 1955; 17: 640-689. [in Dutch]. In 1982 the International Council of Sport Science and Physical Education (ICSSPE) awarded Ostyn the Philip Noel Baker Award for his contributions to sports medicine. Ostyn's energetic and charismatic personality made him into a leading international personality in sports medicine. He combined his job as an academic educator and scholar with several other functions. Since 1955 he would be treasurer of the International University Sports Federation (FISU). He was also president and founding member of the Belgian Society for Sports Medicine & Sports Science, and chaired the first Belgian Anti-doping Committee. He was a founder of the Institute of Physical Education's scholarly periodical 'Hermes' in which he regularly authored articles himself. He also founded the sports medical clinic at the Institute of Physical Education, in which he would provide advice and support to both students and top athletes. After P-P. De Nayer's retirement, Ostyn became Chair (Dean) of the Institute of Physical Education, which he remained until 1986. During that time he was an adviser to numerous research students in kinesiology and in physical therapy. His research interests included sports injuries, metabolic and endocrine responses to exercise, cardiopulmonary physiology, and regulation of carbohydrate and fat metabolism. The death of his wife, Emma Van Molle at age 57 on November 14, 1984, due to ovarian cancer, greatly affected him. In turn, Ostyn sharply cut his academic and scholarly activities. He had also been saddened by the sudden death five years later (1989) of his close friend and colleague, the famed track and field coach Mon Vanden Eynde, after the latter sustained a fatal heart attack. Ostyn became an emeritus professor in 1989,Ghesquiere, Joseph, Tolleneer, Jan, eds. Wetenschap in beweging. Liber amicorum Prof. dr. M. Ostyn Science [Science in movement: liber amicorum Prof. dr. M.

Post-academic career Following Ostyn's retirement the University of Leuven in honor of his important contributions to the university and the world of sports medicine in general, established a yearly lecture series for which a leading international scholar is invited. Shortly after concluding his final roles as a dissertation adviser, he ceased all scholarly activity, and after incurring a cerebral hemorrhage he had been living in a retirement home in Leuven, where he died on 5 June 2013, aged 88. He was interred in the family grave at De Jacht cemetery in Heverlee, a military cemetery where mostly fallen British World War II soldiers and Belgian war veterans are buried. Sporting Competitions Highlights As a student, Ostyn became an enthusiastic track and field runner specializing in middle-long distances establishing several university records during between 1947-50, although he considered himself primarily an 800m runner.

It was aired on October 13, 2011. The episode was written by Dana Baratta and it was directed by Liz Friedlander. Plot Melissa (Jessica Parker Kennedy), after the demon got inside her body, is acting weird and no one can understand why while Cassie (Britt Robertson) is trying to keep the truth about her knowing being a witch from her grandmother, Jane (Ashley Crow). After Heather's death, Jane is suspicious and she it trying to make Cassie talk to her but Cassie is acting like everything is OK. Possessed Melissa is tricking Nick (Louis Hunter) to help her dig up a suitcase from the woods by telling him that her family's Book of Shadows is in it. They take the suitcase to their shelter and Faye (Phoebe Tonkin) is getting there few minutes later and then Cassie. Melissa says that her mother spelled the suitcase and to open it, all six of them have to be there. While trying to call Adam (Thomas Dekker) and Diana (Shelley Hennig) to come, the three of them see the demon crawling under Melissa's skin and they realize that it's not her who wants to open the suitcase. The moment Adam and Diana get there, Nick hits Melissa and they tie her up. Meanwhile, Dawn (Natasha Henstridge) and Charles (Gale Harold) are meeting at Charles' boat to perform a spell. They use the crystal they already have in their possession to locate the other five. They need six crystals so they'll be able to get their power back. The crystal though is not powerful enough and they can't complete the spell. Dawn blames Charles for that and she leaves saying that she shouldn't have trusted him. Back in the shelter, the members of the circle realize that they don't know what to do with Melissa and Cassie leaves to call for help. She is going back home and tells Jane that she knows she is a witch and that they need her help. Jane goes with her and she manages to control the demon with her crystal so they can have time to prepare the spell to kill it. The moment Jane is ready to take the demon out of Melissa and kill it, she realizes that it's not in her anymore. She uses the crystal to find out that the demon got into Nick. Nick runs away and Jane with the rest of the Circle's members kill the demons that are in the suitcase. Possessed Nick, after leaving the shelter, goes to the Boathouse and meets Dawn. He tells her that he is not Nick but the demon she summoned sixteen years ago, Abaddon, and he wants what he came for back then, the Circle and its power. Dawn manages to call Charles from her cell phone for help while she is getting Abaddon away from the Boathouse. Charles manages to knock Abaddon down and Dawn convinces Charles that the only way to kill him is by drŒøwning him. Charles, in his attempt to drown the demon, he kills Nick too, something that devastates him.

He has published more than 50 books of stories and poetry. He wrote in Nepali, Nepal Bhasa and English. Early life Kesar Lall was born in Kathmandu to father Jagat Lal and mother Bal Kumari Shrestha. His father ran a school at his home in MƒÅsan Galli (‡§Æ‡§æ‡§∏‡§Ç ‡§ó‡§≤‡•ç‡§≤‡§ø), and was popularly known as Jagat Lal Master. This was one of the few places that provided a modern education in Nepal in those days as the Rana government discouraged the establishment of schools. Kesar Lall received no formal schooling. He learnt English from his father and taught himself to write composition by studying varied text books. Writing career Kesar Lall began his writing career in 1945 by writing articles in English for Indian magazines. In 1953, he published his first story entitled Bhutucha (\\"Short girl\\") in Nepal Bhasa in Nepal magazine. He published his first book of folk tales entitled Lore and Legend of Nepal in English in 1961. Kesar Lall is best known as a storyteller who exposed Nepal's folklore to the world by collecting, translating and publishing tales told in various Nepalese communities. He traveled across the country, listening to stories and taking down notes in longhand later at home because he said people were shy speaking in front of a tape recorder.

He was born on 17 March 1647 in Stuttgart and died on 20 April 1720 in T√ºbingen.  Life and Works  At the age of 16 Johann Wolfgang J√§ger readily began university studies in philology, philosophy, and Protestant theology in T√ºbingen. He became a tutor for the eldest Prince Carl Maximilian, and also for his brother Georg Friedrich in 1676, the son of Duke Eberhard III of W√ºrttemberg. In 1680, he received the associate professorship of geography and Latin, and in 1681 the full professorship of Greek in T√ºbingen. In 1684, he became an instructor of practical philosophy and overseer of the T√ºbinger Stift. In 1702 he was appointed chancellor of the University of T√ºbingen. There he was a professor of Protestant theology and provost of the collegiate church, until 1709 when he became abbot of the Adelberg Abbey and General Superintendent of the state of W√ºrttemberg. J√§ger earned his achievements in the academic world primarily in his fight against mystical Chiliastic teachers such as Jakob B√∂hme, Gottfried Arnold, and Johann Wilhelm Petersen. J√§ger relied on the rationalist system of natural law of Hugo Grotius. Because of this, he helped to bring new ideas to the University of T√ºbingen. Though he had personal respect for Philipp Spener, he believed that pietism and separatism were dangers to theological doctrine, and he ardently fought against them. His work \\"Compendium Theologiae...pro scholis in Ducatu Wirtembergico\\" was introduced to W√ºrttemberg in 1702 and it replaced older textbooks of theologians such as Matthias Hafenreffer. This work solidified orthodox doctrine by adopting Federalism and connecting closely with Biblical theology. This helped to usher in a new spirit to the faculty of the University of T√ºbingen.

His father‚Äôs name was Muraridutt. He received his education in Varanasi and became a Bhasyacharya (Sanskrit: instructor in the rules of language) of Sanskrit language Vyakaran Shastra (grammar). Later on he became a famous teacher of the Panini Vyakaran (rules of grammar established by Panini) based in Churu, Rajasthan.Sarasvat, Parmanand (1984) Sahityasrashta Shri Vidyadhar Shastri, Ganu Prakashan, Bikaner p2 The Sanskrit school he established in Churu was known as the Pandit Harnamdutt Sanskrit Paatshala. Prominent names amongst his students include Giridhar Sharma Chaturvedi, Vidyavachspati Balchandraji, Pandit Ramanandji Maharaj, Pandit Jaidevji Mishra and Pandit Vilasrayaji. The Sanskrit mahakavya (epic poem), Haranamamritam is a poetic biography written by Vidyavachaspati Vidyadhar Shastri. Haranamamritam This mahakavya depicts the life story of the poet‚Äôs grandfather Harnamdutt Shastri. It is not a glorification of his family but strives to enlighten readers about the humble and calm qualities of scholars. The poet also wishes to encourage the writing of new Sanskrit poetry. The mahakavya is divided into sixteen cantos. In the first canto the poet invokes and bows before the Supreme Being, the current work is then stated to be an effort to propagate culture. In the second canto the protagonist‚Äôs father Muraridutt receives advice and instructions regarding continuation of the family traditions. In the third canto the protagonist is born in Jagadhri (in present day Haryana), soon afterwards his mother dies and he is raised by an aunt. The young boy is disinterested in studies and enjoys wrestling, his father attempts to direct the boy towards setting up his own household. In the fourth canto the young boy wins a wrestling match but is severely berated by his father. In a fit of anger he leaves his home and heads to Delhi. He loses a wrestling match in Delhi and inspired by an elderly persons‚Äô advice, heads to Varanasi. The fifth canto begins with a description of the spiritual aspect of Varanasi. As the chapter continues, the young man creates a favorable impression on the teachers; he interacts with fellow students who go on to become famed scholars. After completing his studies Harnamdutt continues in Varanasi as a teacher. Word of his fame as a teacher reaches his father and Muraridutt travels to Varanasi bringing along Harnamdutt‚Äôs wife. Upon seeing his son established as a respected teacher, the father is greatly pleased and returns home after a brief stay. In the sixth canto the protagonist establishes his household in Varanasi. Soon a son is born; however, the happiness is cut short by the sudden death of the infant. On recovering from the tragedy, he devotes himself to prayer and studies. In the seventh canto Seth Bhagwandas Bagala of Churu visits the protagonist and implores him to establish a Sanskrit Paatshala (school) in Churu. Although hesitant at first, Harnamdutt is won over by the entreaties of the visitor and acquiesces. The chapter contains an excellent description of the desert environment‚Äôs beauty. The eighth canto covers the grand welcome to the protagonist by the residents of Churu; the Sanskrit Paatshala‚Äôs attracting students from afar and the spreading fame of Churu (Rajasthan) as a new Varanasi. The canto also describes the ideal perfection of a resident student‚Äôs life. The ninth canto describes the misery caused by the famine of 1889, a prayer to Lord Shiva is organized and an unprecedented rainfall results. In the tenth canto the protagonist is accompanied by his sons and pupils on a pilgrimage. The poet describes both the hardships and blissful interludes which occur during travel through the desert. The travelers are waylaid by a band of brigands and the protagonist addresses them in a fearless manner. He advises the dacoits to become righteous warriors (kshatriyas). The eleventh canto is the heart and soul of the mahakavya. In it the protagonist instructs his sons to observe the requirements of nurturing a household (grihasta). The protagonist then proceeds to Haridwar and starts living as a hermit (vanprastha) in the siddhashrama (hermitage). The twelfth canto describes the life of resident students at Gurukul Kangri, it also includes a listing of the protagonist's prominent students and collaborators. Next is a description of Kurukshetra where the protagonist proceeds to attend a conference of Brahmins. In the thirteenth canto the protagonist addresses the conference as the chairman, in his address he outlines the duties of a brahmin and enjoins the brahmins to carry out these obligations. The canto ends with a wish for world prosperity. In the fourteenth canto the protagonist opines that animal sacrifice has no place in a yajna (ritual offering) . In the fifteenth canto the protagonist attends a Sanskrit conference on the occasion of the Kumbha parva, the canto ends with an invocation for the propagation of Sanskrit. In the sixteenth canto we learn that the protagonist is in a sickly state and is being devotedly attended to by his pupils. The canto lists the disciples who followed in the footsteps of their guru by encouraging the growth of Indian culture. The mahakavya ends with a wish for Indian culture and traditions to be preserved eternally.Sarasvat p28-33 References External links *Sahityasrashta Shri Vidyadhar Shastri at Library of Congress *Haranamamritam at Library of Congress Category:Indian Sanskrit scholars Category:People from Yamunanagar district Category:1843 births Category:1915 deaths Category:People of British India ","title":"Harnamdutt Shastri"},{"id":"39873632","text":"Carlos Alberto Debrot (c. 1922 ‚Äì 16 December 1999), better known by his stage name Jorge Tuero, was a Venezuelan television actor and comedian recognized for his characters in the television programs Chever√≠simo and Radio Rochela.

She later served as the President of the North Dakota State Board of Higher Education, which creates policy for the North Dakota University System, during the 1980s.

WrestleMania Mystery is a 2014 direct-to-DVD animated comedy mystery film, and the twenty-second film in the direct-to-video series of Scooby-Doo films. It is a co-production between Warner Bros. Animation and WWE Studios. The film features Scooby and the gang solving a mystery at WrestleMania. It was released on March 24, 2014 in the United Kingdom and on March 25, 2014 in the United States by Warner Home Video. Plot Scooby-Doo and Shaggy win an all-expenses-paid stay at WWE City to watch WrestleMania after beating the hardest level of the organization's latest video game. At the insistence of the duo, Fred, Daphne, and Velma agree to join them on the trip to WWE City. Upon their arrival, the Mystery Machine crashes on a ditch after Fred narrowly avoids a crossing raccoon. The gang meets John Cena, his trainer Cookie, and Cookie's nephew Ruben before Cena lifts the Mystery Machine back on the road. They also encounter Bayard, a hunter who despises WWE for building their city in his forest. Cena gives the gang VIP tickets to the next event to make up for their altercation with Bayard. At the show, Mr. McMahon unveils the WWE Championship belt, which has been held vacant since Kane's last match was overturned. The title is up for grabs over the weekend at WrestleMania. The gang is then offered a tour of WWE's training camp before arriving at their cabins. Later that night, Daphne and Velma overhear Ruben arguing with Cookie over not becoming a WWE wrestler because of Cookie's leg injury. Meanwhile, Scooby has a dream about wrestling giant food monsters when Shaggy wakes him up and they both encounter a monster called the Ghost Bear before running for their lives. The WWE wrestlers intervene during the chase, but Triple H and Brodus Clay are overpowered by the monster, which disappears after throwing Sin Cara's hot rod toward a water tower. The next morning, the gang is briefed by WWE executive Ms. Richards that the city has been terrorized by bear attacks over the past few weeks. Mr. McMahon asks the gang to solve the Ghost Bear mystery to ensure the security of the WWE belt. Cena and Sin Cara explain to the gang that the legend of the Ghost Bear started over 100 years ago with a wrestling bear named Vicious, who was defeated by Sin Cara's great-great-great grandfather Sin Cara Grande at the grounds that would be WWE City. Furious over its loss, Vicious vented its frustration on the town until Sin Cara Grande warded it off to a cave at the cost of a career-ending leg injury. It is believed by Sin Cara that the spirit of the bear has been stirred by WrestleMania. Next morning, the gang is notified by Ms. Richards that the WWE belt has been stolen, and Scooby is arrested after being caught with it around his waist, with security footage showing him caught in the act. Velma, however, proves Scooby's innocence by showing that he was in a deep state of hypnosis when he stole the belt. Ruben then deduces that the WWE video game contains light flashes that implanted post-hypnotic suggestions to Scooby's brain. Mr. McMahon offers Scooby and Shaggy a chance at freedom if they defeat Kane at WrestleMania. The duo receive a crash course training from Cookie and AJ Lee. That night, the gang and Cena wander along the forest until they reach the bear cave. Inside, they discover a room with books on hypnotism, schematics of an EMP device, and a calendar indicating that the culprit plans to target WrestleMania. Suddenly, the Ghost Bear appears and chases the gang through a storm drain. They escape after Cena slams the Ghost Bear away from them before realizing that the storm drain is directly underneath WWE City. After the gang gives Ms. Richards details on their encounter with the Ghost Bear, Cookie advises that WrestleMania should be cancelled, much to Ms. Richards' disapproval. Fred suggests that the gang uses WrestleMania to nab the Ghost Bear. During the main event, Velma deduces that the WWE belt is the EMP device. After the gang discovers that the belt is a fake and the EMP device is set to go off in 30 seconds, Cena tries to get rid of it, but it activates and shuts off the underground power generator. When the Ghost Bear appears and wreaks havoc all over the arena, the WWE wrestlers ignite green pyrotechnics to light up the stage while Scooby uses his dance moves to throw Kane off guard. The Ghost Bear arrives at ringside, but is confronted by Ruben in his wrestling attire before both combatants are launched into the ring by a floor catapult. The ring is then enclosed inside a steel cage before Cena, Sin Cara, Kane, and Ruben pin down the monster for Scooby to land a belly bomb off the top rope, leveling the ring in the process. The Ghost Bear is revealed to be Cookie, who resented WWE due to his injury ending his career too soon and plotted the perfect crime to steal the title belt using Scooby as a pawn and tarnish the organization's reputation. As Cookie is taken away by the police and Ms. Richards (who is now displeased that she was wrong about Scooby stealing the belt), Mr. McMahon offers Ruben a spot on the WWE roster before awarding the WWE belt to Scooby and Shaggy.

Production On August 14, 2012, Warner Bros. and WWE Studios announced that they would co- produce a Scooby-Doo animated feature that will find Scooby and the gang solving a mystery at WrestleMania. =Soundtrack= The original music score was composed by Ryan Shore. The film also features the WWE entrance music themes of The Miz, Mr. McMahon, John Cena, Kane, and AJ Lee. Critical reception Matt Fowler of IGN gave the film a \\"Mediocre\\" score of 5.0 out of 10, citing that \\"Scooby-Doo! WrestleMania Mystery will most definitely delight your children, whether they're fans of one, or both, properties. It's well- meaning, snappily animated, and it's fun to hear the [wrestlers] do their own voices.\\" Television retitling In its television premiere on Cartoon Network's Flicks on Saturday, July 26, 2014, the movie was retitled Scooby- Doo! The WWE Mystery and the event the gang are in WWE City to witness was renamed \\"SuperStar-Mania\\". No reason was given by the network for the changes in the film dialogue or title. This movie is the first of the animated films to get a TV-PG rating for \\"violence\\" due to the plot of the film involving wrestling. All previous Scooby-Doo animated movies received a TV-Y7-FV rating. Sequel On September 15, 2014, WWE and Warner Bros. announced a direct sequel to WrestleMania Mystery to be released in 2016 by the name of Scooby- Doo! and WWE: Curse of the Speed Demon. Hulk Hogan was billed to be prominently featured. However, on July 23, 2015, WWE terminated their contract with Hogan due to racist comments, leaving speculation as to his appearance in the film. In the UK, the film was released on August 8, 2016. Follow-up film Scooby-Doo! Frankencreepy was released on August 19, 2014.

He was editor-in-chief of Al-Ahram Weekly between 1991 and 2005 and later founder and until February 2011 editor-in-chief of Ahram Online, both part of the state-run Al-Ahram Foundation. He was also the Executive Director of the Heikal Foundation for Arab Journalism.  Early life and career  Shukrallah was born in Cairo, Egypt in 1950, and was raised in the city to a Coptic Christian family. Throughout the 1970s, he was a student activist during the presidency of Anwar Sadat. He described himself as a \\"Marxist,\\" but antagonistic of the \\"dogmatic leftist thinking\\" that he said marked many of the socialist and communist countries during that period. He became an advocate of the human rights movement in Egypt during this period and together with Saad Eddin Ibrahim co- founded the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) in April 1985, during the presidency of Hosni Mubarak. Shukrallah attests that the EOHR was largely ignored by the government, opposition parties and factions‚Äîincluding Islamists‚Äîand the intellectual elite of Egypt and the organization struggled in documenting human rights violations and ensuring the accuracy of victims' testimonies.  Journalism career  In 1991 Shukrallah was appointed managing editor and later editor-in-chief of the state-owned newspaper Al-Ahram Weekly. Starting in 1995, he had his own column, called \\"Reflections,\\" in the newspaper. He was dismissed as chief editor in July 2005. During that year in particular, Shukrallah had written numerous articles criticizing Egyptian politics and demanding that the Mubarak government make clearer how it would allow for more political liberalization, being skeptical of the promised reforms. He continued to work for the state-run Al-Ahram Foundation which publishes the Al-Ahram Weekly, becoming a consultant to the Al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies think tank that year, a job he held until late 2008. In 2009 he served as the co-chief editor of the Al-Shorouk daily, a paper he helped establish. In 2010 Shukrallah launched Ahram Online, an English-language news site published by the Al-Ahram Foundation, and served as its editor-in-chief. Throughout his career in journalism, Shukrallah also wrote articles in the London-based Al-Hayat and The Guardian, the Indian magazine Outlook and the Journal of Palestine Studies. The main topics Shukrallah concentrated on were the Egyptian government, domestic politics, political Islam, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the United States-led Iraq War and \\"War on Terror.\\" Following the 2011 Egyptian revolution, Shukrallah joined the Social Democratic Party, but later left the party. He became a critic of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, which took power after Mubarak's ouster in February 2011 and claimed they had intended \\"to stop the revolution at every juncture.\\" He was also critical of the Muslim Brotherhood and supported the ouster of Mohamed Morsi from power, writing that mass protests against Morsi on 30 June \\"put[ting] somewhere between 30-40 percent of the nation‚Äôs adult population on the streets in a single day.\\"  References   Bibliography   Category:1950 births Category:2019 deaths Category:Egyptian political journalists Category:Egyptian Marxists Category:People from Cairo Category:Egyptian newspaper editors Category:Egyptian columnists Category:20th-century Egyptian writers Category:21st-century Egyptian writers Category:20th-century journalists Category:21st-century journalists Category:Egyptian male writers Category:Egyptian newspaper founders ","title":"Hani Shukrallah"},{"id":"39873976","text":"In political geography, an enclave is a piece of land entirely surrounded by the territory of another equivalent-level entity (and only that entity). An exclave is a piece of land that is politically connected to a larger piece but not physically conterminous with it because the territory of other equivalent- level entity or entities entirely surround it. Many entities are both enclaves and exclaves. In Pennsylvania, every county in the state, other than the counties of Fulton, Philadelphia, Pike and Union, contains at least one municipality surrounded completely by another municipality. While Pennsylvania's urban counties contain few enclaves due to municipal fragmentation, rural areas feature numerous enclaved municipalities. Many resulted from small town centers separating from their rural surrounding areas. There are at least 338 enclaves (that are not exclaves) in Pennsylvania comprising incorporated places and census-designated places (CDP) within other county subdivisions. Of these, 260 are boroughs (out of 957 in the state), 75 are CDPs (out of 749), two are townships (out of 1547) and one is a city (out of 57). Although each CDP is technically a part of the township(s) in which it is located, these two types of subdivision are considered to be distinct entities. Usually, the enclave (that is not an exclave) takes the form of a borough that is surrounded by the township of which it was originally a part, but other scenarios are possible, e.g., :*the borough of Mount Oliver is an enclave of the city of Pittsburgh; :*Pitcairn borough, of the municipality of Monroeville; :*Dale borough, of the city of Johnstown; :*Export borough, of the borough of Murrysville; :*both New Galilee and Homewood boroughs, of the borough of Big Beaver; :*the Lackawanna County township of Elmhurst, of Roaring Brook Township; :*the Tioga County township of Putnam, of Covington Township.

Unlike enclaves and exclaves, they are not entirely surrounded by outside territory. Hence, they are enclaves or exclaves for practical purposes, without meeting the strict definition. * In Lehigh County, the westernmost section of the city of Allentown is a pene-en(ex)clave connected at a quadripoint with South Whitehall Township, which surrounds it. *In Cambria County, Portage consists of two sections that are connected at a single point (a quadripoint).

In the early years of the 20th century, Zimmerman served as the Prosecuting Attorney for Hampshire County and as a Democratic member of the West Virginia House of Delegates. Zimmerman was born in La Plata to Reverend George Henry Zimmerman, a Methodist pastor and church administrator. He began his post-secondary education at Roanoke College and received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Randolph‚ÄìMacon College in 1892. He worked as a clerk in the United States Census Office in Washington, D.C., and earned a Bachelor of Laws degree in 1896 from Columbian University Law School. Following his graduation, Zimmerman opened a law office in Romney, West Virginia, in July 1896 and engaged in the practice of law there. He provided legal services to a number of companies and organizations including Capon Valley Bank, Hampshire County's Legal Advisory Board, the Hampshire County Food Administration, and Hampshire County orchard owners. Zimmerman was the secretary for the Winchester and Western Railroad. While serving in the West Virginia House of Delegates, Zimmerman was appointed by West Virginia Governor John Jacob Cornwell to serve on a West Virginia Legislature select committee charged with drafting a road transportation bill known as the West Virginia State Road Law. He was again appointed by Governor Cornwell to serve on a similar select committee following the ratification of the \\"Good Roads Amendment\\" of the Constitution of West Virginia in 1920. In addition to serving in the West Virginia House of Delegates, Zimmerman was the chairman of the Hampshire County Democratic Party Committee and a member of the Second District Congressional Committee; he also participated in judicial, senatorial, and state conventions. Zimmerman played an active role in the commercial apple orchard industry of Hampshire County, and he operated at least three commercial orchards there.  Early life and family  Joshua Soule Zimmerman was born on January 16, 1874, near La Plata in Charles County, Maryland, at the ancestral home of his mother, Henrietta A. Rowe Zimmerman. His father was Reverend George Henry Zimmerman, a Methodist pastor and church administrator whose family originated from an estate in Baltimore County near Baltimore, Maryland. Zimmerman's father presided over the Moorefield district of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South (1894‚Äì1898). Zimmerman had two brothers: Edgar Rowe Zimmerman of Ruxton, Maryland, and George Henry Zimmerman of Whitesburg, Kentucky. The pastoral profession of Zimmerman's father caused his family to relocate to a number of towns throughout Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia. Zimmerman spent the majority of his youth in Woodstock and Salem, Virginia, before his father transferred to Romney, West Virginia, to preside over the Moorefield district of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South.  Education  Zimmerman attended Roanoke College in Salem, Virginia, from 1885 to 1886, and in 1888 he began attending Randolph‚ÄìMacon College in Ashland, Virginia, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1892. Following his graduation, Zimmerman worked briefly as a tutor on a plantation near Shelby, Mississippi. In 1893, Zimmerman accepted the position of a clerk in the United States Census Office in Washington, D.C., during the second administration of President Grover Cleveland. During his three years serving in the United States Census Office, Zimmerman completed night courses in jurisprudence at Columbian University Law School, and he graduated from the institution with a Bachelor of Laws degree in 1896. While attending Columbian University, Zimmerman also served as editor of the 1896 Class Book and resided at 915 I Street, Northwest near Mount Vernon Square. Zimmerman was a member of the Phi Delta Theta social fraternity and of the Phi Delta Phi legal honor society. He was later made a Golden Legionnaire of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity.  Law career  Following his graduation from Columbian University Law School, Zimmerman opened his law office in Romney, West Virginia, in July 1896 and began engaging in the practice of law there. His first legal case argued before the Hampshire County Circuit Court was West Virginia v. Smith, in which his client was charged with \\"breaking and entering with intent to commit larceny\\". Zimmerman lost this case. In Hu Maxwell and Howard Llewellyn Swisher's History of Hampshire County, West Virginia: From Its Earliest Settlement to the Present (1897), Zimmerman was described as \\"a young man\\" who had \\"made his success at the bar of Hampshire\\". Zimmerman's law practice expanded, and he began arguing cases in adjoining West Virginia county courts and in both the West Virginia state and United States federal courts. Only seven years after starting his law practice, Zimmerman was appointed to fill the unexpired term of Prosecuting Attorney for Hampshire County, William B. Cornwell, who had resigned from the position. Zimmerman was subsequently reelected twice to the position, and he served as Hampshire County's prosecuting attorney from 1900 until 1910 (a total of nine years and three months). Zimmerman also served as one of three chancery commissioners for Hampshire County, during which he served with Christian Streit White, Robert White, and James Sloan Kuykendall. He was a member of the West Virginia Bar Association. Zimmerman was the lawyer for the Capon Valley Bank, headquartered in Wardensville, West Virginia, and provided his legal services to secure the bank's incorporation. During World War I, Zimmerman served as a member of Hampshire County's Legal Advisory Board and was the lawyer for the County Food Administration. Following the outbreak of World War I, Zimmerman registered for the draft during the registration for men aged 18 through 45 under the Selective Service Act of 1917. After the Winchester and Western Railroad Company received its charter on August 31, 1916, to build and operate a rail line connecting Wardensville and the Lost River valley of West Virginia to the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and the Cumberland Valley Railroad at Winchester, Virginia, Zimmerman served as the company's secretary.  Political career  Portrait of Joshua Soule Zimmerman as a young lawyer, prior to 1897 Zimmerman became a prominent leader within the Democratic Party in Hampshire County, which was the dominant political party in the county. At various times, Zimmerman served as the chairman of the Hampshire County Democratic Party Committee, a member of the Second District Congressional Committee, and attended judicial, senatorial, and state conventions. = West Virginia House of Delegates = Zimmerman was nominated as the Democratic Party candidate for a seat representing Hampshire County in the West Virginia House of Delegates in 1920. Zimmerman won the seat against Republican Party candidate C. W. Rogers in the November 1920 general election and subsequently served as a member of the West Virginia House of Delegates from 1921 to 1924. Following his election, Zimmerman was made the Democratic Party's floor leader in the West Virginia House of Delegates. Zimmerman was appointed by West Virginia Governor John Jacob Cornwell to serve on a West Virginia Legislature select committee charged with drafting a road transportation bill under West Virginia Senate Joint Resolution No. 21 of May 21, 1919, known as the West Virginia State Road Law. The new West Virginia State Road Law became necessary following the authorization of a 50 million USD bond issue during the 1920 general election. Zimmerman was again appointed by Governor Cornwell to serve on a similar select committee following the ratification of the \\"Good Roads Amendment\\" of the Constitution of West Virginia in 1920. During the 1921 legislative session, Zimmerman was assigned to the Judiciary, Roads, and Game and Fish committees. Also during the 1921 legislative session, he sponsored the following bills: * H.B. 274 (Ch. 158), which gave county courts the authority to impose a \\"special building levy\\" not to exceed 30 cents for the purpose of completing the construction or repair of county courthouses. * H.B. 392 (Ch. 49), which provided for the establishment of a county high school for Hampshire County and authorized the Hampshire County Board of Education to impose a levy not to exceed 30 cents for three years to construct and maintain the high school. Throughout his tenure in the West Virginia House of Delegates, Zimmerman supported legislation that strictly enforced prohibition.  Agricultural pursuits  Zimmerman played an active role in the commercial apple orchard industry of Hampshire County, in which he was responsible for the promotion of several of the county's orchard companies, served as an officer and legal advisor to orchard companies, and owned of his own commercial apple orchards. In November 1906, Zimmerman, Henry Bell Gilkeson, R. W. Dailey, Jr., and P. J. Ruckman were incorporators of the Mill Mountain Orchard Company, which operated orchards along the top of Mill Creek Mountain west of Romney. According to the 1919 Census of the Commercial Apple Orchards in West Virginia published by the West Virginia Department of Agriculture, Zimmerman was engaged in the management of three commercial apple orchards near Romney, West Virginia: Fairfax Orchard Company, which produced Stark Delicious apples; Gilkeson, Hart & Zimmerman Orchard, which produced York Imperial, Pennsylvania Winesap, Ben Davis, Stayman Winesap, Jonathan, Grimes Golden, and Rome Beauty apples; and the Mill Mountain Orchard Company, which produced York Imperial, Stayman Winesap, Pennsylvania Winesap, Rambo, Northern Spy, Canada Red, Ben Davis, Grimes Golden, Jonathan, Rome Beauty, Yellow Transparent, and Stark apples.  Marriage and children  Gravestone at the interment site of Joshua Soule Zimmerman at Indian Mound Cemetery in Romney, West Virginia Zimmerman married Kitty Campbell Vance on October 10, 1900, near Romney, West Virginia. Kitty Campbell Vance was the daughter of John T. and Mary Elizabeth Inskeep Vance of Romney. Zimmerman and his wife Kitty had four children: * Mary Elizabeth Zimmerman Kump (March 21, 1903 ‚Äì 1994), married Garnett Kerr Kump in 1940 in Hampshire County, West Virginia * George Henry Zimmerman (February 20, 1905 ‚Äì 1987) * Kitty Campbell Zimmerman McCracken, married James Paris McCracken of Cisco, Texas at the Romney Presbyterian Church in Romney, West Virginia on August 20, 1946 * Vance Zimmerman (August 5, 1910 ‚Äì September 27, 1976), married Mildred Sites in 1937 in Hampshire County, West Virginia Zimmerman was an active layperson in the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, and served as a steward of the Romney Methodist Episcopal Church, South congregations. He also served for a number of years as the superintendent of the congregation's Sunday school program. Zimmerman represented the church in the Moorefield district and at annual conferences of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South. Despite his involvement in the Southern Methodist church, his wife Kitty and several of his children were Presbyterian.  Later life and death  Zimmerman's wife Kitty predeceased him in 1937. He died in Williamsport, Maryland, on September 2, 1962. Zimmerman is interred with his wife Kitty at Indian Mound Cemetery in Romney, West Virginia. He had practiced law in Romney, West Virginia, for 66 years.

Cheek, M. & M. Jebb (2013). Nepenthes ultra (Nepenthaceae), a new species from Luzon, Philippines. Blumea, published online on October 24, 2013. These species are united by a number of morphological characters, including winged petioles, lids with basal ridges on the lower surface (often elaborated into appendages), and upper pitchers that are usually broadest near the base. The specific epithet ramos honours Philippine botanical collector Maximo Ramos, who collected the type material with J. Pascasio. Plants matching the description of N. ramos have been observed in the Mindanao provinces of Bukidnon, Davao Oriental, and Surigao, and on an \\"isolated mountain\\" on an undisclosed island around 120 km from the type locality.Gronemeyer, T.

These discoveries suggest that N. ramos might be the most common member of the \\"N. alata group\\" on the island of Mindanao. Nepenthes kurata Botanical illustration of N. kurata from Cheek and Jebb's type description. This taxon was subsequently synonymised with N. ramos. Nepenthes kurata was described in 2013 as a species known only from Mount Malindang in Misamis Occidental Province, Mindanao, where it was recorded at 1400 m altitude. This would make it one of the most westerly known Nepenthes species in Mindanao. (In 1995 N. mirabilis was found near Polanco, further to the west.) This taxon was previously described as a variety of N. alata‚ÄîN. alata var. ecristata‚Äîin John Muirhead Macfarlane's 1908 monograph, \\"Nepenthaceae\\". The specific epithet kurata honours botanist Shigeo Kurata, best known for his 1976 book, Nepenthes of Mount Kinabalu. Nepenthes kurata was formally synonymised with N. ramos in 2016.

He has been convicted of over 60 crimes. In 1991, he was identified as one of 34 convicts in custody in Canadian prisons who had been diagnosed with an AIDS infection. In 1991 guards, calling upon the terms of their union's contract, argued that Ratte should be kept in isolation, because his infection posed a risk to their health. Ratte argued that this segregation violated his rights. In 2000, Ratte was convicted of attacking guards, and trying to infect them. CBC News reported that Ratte requested a longer sentence so he would be held in Federal custody, not Provincial custody. According to an article in the Canadian HIV/AIDS Policy and Law Review, he requested the longer sentence because he considered himself too dangerous to be held in Provincial custody. Ratte was escorted to court by four guards wearing body armour, gloves and protective eye-guards. Each guard was holding a leash attached to a collar. In 2010, Ratte and two associates were convicted of a home invasion. Ratte agreed to testify against Tracy L. Caron, a Kingston area woman, who was charged with trying to hire someone to hurt Clifford Richards. Richards was murdered on 26 October 2010, at which time Ratte was already in custody, but he testified she discussed hiring someone to hurt Richards before his apprehension. In June 2013, Ratte attacked Omar Khadr shortly after Khadr had been transferred to a prison in Edmonton. Ratte received conditional release in March 2018. He was released under a peace bond that imposed an 11pm to 6am curfew upon him. After Ratte stayed out one night he asked a friend to phone his wife, and tell her he missed the curfew because he had been kidnapped by bikers. His wife took this story seriously, and informed police, and filed a missing person report. However, her daughter found him later that day, in their neighbourhood, smoking crystal meth. Ratte spent the next five months in jail.

The name Umple is a portmanteau of \\"UML\\", \\"ample\\" and \\"Simple\\", indicating that it is designed to provide ample features to extend programming languages with UML capabilities. History and philosophy The design of Umple started in 2008 at the University of Ottawa. Umple was open-sourced and its development was moved to Google Code in early 2011 and to GitHub in 2015. Umple was developed, in part, to address certain problems observed in the modelling community. Most specifically, it was designed to bring modelling and programming into alignment, It was intended to help overcome inhibitions against modelling common in the programmer community. It was also intended to reduce some of the difficulties of model- driven development that arise from the need to use large, expensive or incomplete tools. One design objective is to enable programmers to model in a way they see as natural, by adding modelling constructs to programming languages.  Features and capabilities  Umple can be used to represent in a textual manner many UML modelling entities found in class diagrams and state diagrams. Umple can generate code for these in various programming languages. Currently Umple fully supports Java, C++ and PHP as target programming languages and has functional, but somewhat incomplete support for Ruby. Umple also incorporates various features not related to UML, such as the Singleton pattern, keys, immutability, mixins and aspect-oriented code injection. The class diagram notations Umple supports includes classes, interfaces, attributes, associations, generalizations and operations. The code Umple generates for attributes include code in the constructor, 'get' methods and 'set' methods. The generated code differs considerably depending on whether the attribute has properties such as immutability, has a default value, or is part of a key. Umple generates many methods for manipulating, querying and navigating associations. It supports all combinations of UML multiplicity and enforces referential integrity. Umple supports the vast majority of UML state machine notation, including arbitrarily deep nested states, concurrent regions, actions on entry, exit and transition, plus long-lasting activities while in a state. A state machine is treated as an enumerated attribute where the value is controlled by events. Events encoded in the state machine can be methods written by the user, or else generated by the Umple compiler. Events are triggered by calling the method. An event can trigger transitions (subject to guards) in several different state machines. Since a program can be entirely written around one or more state machines, Umple enables automata- based programming. The bodies of methods are written in one of the target programming languages. The same is true for other imperative code such as state machine actions and guards, and code to be injected in an aspect- oriented manner. Such code can be injected before many of the methods in the code Umple generates, for example before or after setting or getting attributes and associations. The Umple notation for UML constructs can be embedded in any of its supported target programming languages. When this is done, Umple can be seen as a pre-processor: The Umple compiler expands the UML constructs into code of the target language. Code in a target language can be passed to the Umple compiler directly; if no Umple-specific notation is found, then the target-language code is emitted unchanged by the Umple compiler. Umple, combined with one of its target languages for imperative code, can be seen and used as a complete programming language. Umple plus Java can therefore be seen as an extension of Java. Alternatively, if imperative code and Umple-specific concepts are left out, Umple can be seen as a way of expressing a large subset of UML in a purely textual manner. Code in one of the supported programming languages can be added in the same manner as UML envisions adding action language code. License Umple is licensed under an MIT-style license.  Examples Here is the classic Hello world program written in Umple (extending Java): class HelloWorld { public static void main(String [ ] args) { System.out.println(\\"Hello World\\"); } } This example looks just like Java, because Umple extends other programming languages. With the program saved in a file named \`HelloWorld.ump\`, it can be compiled from the command line: $ java -jar umple.jar HelloWorld.ump To run it: $ java HelloWorld The following is a fully executable example showing embedded Java methods and declaration of an association. class Person { name; // Attribute, string by default String toString () { return(getName()); } } class Student { isA Person; } class Mentor { isA Person; } association { 0..1 Mentor -- * Student; } class Person { public static void main(String [ ] args) { Mentor m = new Mentor(\\"Nick The Mentor\\"); Student s = new Student(\\"Tom The Student\\"); s.setMentor(m); System.out.println(\\"The mentor of \\" + s + \\" is \\" + s.getMentor()); System.out.println(\\"The students of \\" + m + \\" are \\" + m.getStudents()); } } The following example describes a state machine called status, with states Open, Closing, Closed, Opening and HalfOpen, and with various events that cause transitions from one state to another. class GarageDoor { status { Open { buttonOrObstacle -> Closing; } Closing { buttonOrObstacle -> Opening; reachBottom -> Closed; } Closed { buttonOrObstacle -> Opening; } Opening { buttonOrObstacle -> HalfOpen; reachTop -> Open; } HalfOpen { buttonOrObstacle -> Opening; } } } Umple use in practice The first version of the Umple compiler was written in Java, Antlr and Jet (Java Emitter Templates), but in a bootstrapping process, the Java code was converted to Umple following a technique called Umplification. The Antlr and Jet were also later converted to native Umple. Umple is therefore now written entirely in itself, in other words it is self-hosted and serves as its own largest test case. Umple and UmpleOnline have been used in the classroom by several instructors to teach UML and modelling. In one study it was found to help speed up the process of teaching UML, and was also found to improve the grades of students.  Tools  Umple is available as a Jar file so it can be run from the command line, and as an Eclipse plugin. There is also an online tool for Umple called UmpleOnline , which allows a developer to create an Umple system by drawing a UML class diagram, editing Umple code or both. Umple models created with UmpleOnline are stored in the cloud. Currently UmpleOnline only supports Umple programs consisting of a single input file. In addition to code, Umple's tools can generate a variety of other types of output, including user interfaces based on the Umple model.

Its average elevation is around above sea level. The region stretches across Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk and Chernivtsi Oblasts and Suceava County. Description The region represents a portion of a large foredeep (Carpathian Foredeep) that formed during the Miocene epoch in front of the folding Carpathian Mountains. The outer zone of the foredeep has as its foundation the Podolian Platform; the inner zone consists of severely dislocated flysch deposits. The foredeep itself is filled with thick Miocene deposits of clays, argillites, calcareous clays, and sandstones covered by diluvial and alluvial deposits. At the end of the Pliocene epoch the region was an accumulative-denudational peneplain covered by fluvial deposits of sand, silt, and clay originating from the Carpathians. As a result of an uplift at the end of the Pliocene and the beginning of the Pleistocene epoch the rivers intensified their erosion and sculpted into the surface a number of wide valleys, lowlands, and intervening ridges. The uplift of Eastern Carpathian Foothills was not uniform, however, and the relief features are partly of tectonic origin. In the Dnieper glacial phase the northeastern part of Eastern Carpathian Foothills was occupied by a lobe of the European continental glacier, and the meltwaters temporarily ponded. By the end of the Pleistocene epoch the region was covered by deposits of loess. At present the rivers from the Carpathian Mountains, most notably the Stryi River, carry silt and sand on to Eastern Carpathian Foothills and deposit them in their floodplains.

Nielsen. In the Ascendance Series, an orphan named Sage is kidnapped and trained to impersonate Prince Jaron, the missing Prince of Carthya. After Sage ascends the throne, he has to lead Carthya through a destructive war with multiple neighboring nations. The first book in the series, The False Prince, was first released on April 1, 2012 through Scholastic Press. The book sold well and its paperback reprint placed The False Prince on The New York Times Best Seller list in May 2013. The second book, The Runaway King, was released on March 1, 2013, and the third book, The Shadow Throne, was released on February 25, 2014. In December 2019, Nielsen announced that a fourth book in the series would be published in October 2020, titled The Captive Kingdom, and also confirmed that she would be writing a fifth book in the series. Reception for the first book was mostly positive, but decreased to mixed for the second and third books. While Paramount Pictures licensed the movie rights for the series in 2012, they did not renew the contract for the series in 2017. Stories =The False Prince= Sage is a fourteen-year-old orphan who steals a roast from a local butcher, but is saved from his wrath by a nobleman named Bevin Conner. Conner is visiting different orphanages, and buying teenage boys who resemble the missing Prince Jaron, heir to the throne of the Kingdom of Carthya. Conner buys four boys, but a particularly weak one is soon killed as an example, showing that Conner means business. Conner then takes the boys to his estate, Farthenwood. They learn that Conner is a minor regent of the circle that surrounds the King. King Eckbert, his wife Erin and his oldest son, crown prince Darius, have been murdered in secret. Conner is a patriot who wants to see the Kingdom of Carthya preserved, rather than fall into civil war at the hands of Prime Regent Veldergrath. He therefore concocts the plan to place a fraud on the throne to avert the coming war. One of the three boys will be chosen as the imposter, and the other two executed. The chosen boy will impersonate Prince Jaron, the younger son of King Eckbert, who has been missing for years after the ship he was aboard was raided and destroyed by pirates from Avenia, a nation that borders Carthya. Sage's argumentative, independent behavior continually lands him in trouble over the next two weeks, as he and the other two boys, Roden and Tobias, compete against each other to become Conner's choice for the impostor. On one occasion, he steals back a rock that Connor took from him, which Connor claims is imitators gold and Sage insists is real gold. Because of this, Connor orders him to be whipped in an attempt to bend Sage to his will. During his stay at Farthewood, he also meets a kitchen maid named Imogen. As the two weeks draw to a close, Tobias cuts Sage with a knife one night in an answer to Sage's challenge to ‚Äúprove himself,‚Äù but the attempt quickly backfires as Sage pulls out another knife and blackmails him into staying out of the race to impersonate Prince Jaron. By the end of the two weeks, Roden is chosen, but at the last minute, Connor notices Sage rolling a coin over his knuckles, and chooses Sage because of this, as this was a special trick which Prince Jaron was known for. In a flashback, Sage reveals to the readers that he is Prince Jaron himself. Many years ago, he had been sent to a boarding school in the country of Bymar by his parents, which he considered a disgrace. As a result, he deserted the ship before it even left the port, and thus spent the years since then going under the pseudonym of Sage, pretending to be an orphan. When they arrive at the royal castle in the city of Drylliad, they are refused entrance inside, so Jaron takes them inside by way of the castle sewer. At this point, Roden, angry over not being chosen to impersonate Prince Jaron, challenges Jaron to a sword fight. Jaron accepts and ultimately wins, but chooses to show mercy to Roden by allowing him to live. Roden decides to leave Jaron, and Jaron continues on to the castle. Jaron reveals himself to the crowd at the castle as Prince Jaron, stunning everyone, including Connor and his late father's advisor Lord Kerywn. He then reveals that Connor is the one who killed the royal family by poisoning them and that Connor was the one who hired the pirates to kill him. Connor is arrested at once, and Jaron assumes the throne. =The Runaway King= When King Jaron is walking in the castle garden, he is attacked by Roden, who is still angry over losing the throne to Jaron. Roden tells Jaron that he has joined the Avenian pirates, and that the pirates are seeking to kill Jaron, because they failed to accomplish this the first time. Before leaving, Roden allows Jaron to live for the present, but tells him that the pirates are giving Jaron ten days to surrender, or else they will attack Carthya. Jaron realizes that the pirates are in alliance with Avenia to kill him and destroy Carthya. During the encounter, Roden threatened to kill a person dear to Jaron if Jaron refuses to cooperate, and Jaron realizes that this person is none other than Imogen, so he decides to send her away to keep her safe. At the same time, he wants her to leave without looking back, so he lies to her and says he has used her to reclaim the throne, and they are not friends. Imogen leaves the castle in anger. Jaron also visits Connor in prison that day, accompanied by Gregor, the captain of his guard. Connor tells him that the poison he used to kill Jaron's family came from the pirate king Devlin. When the regents of the kingdom find out about the assassination attempt on Jaron, they propose that Jaron go into hiding for safety and appoint a steward to rule for him until he is of age. Jaron believes that they need to defend themselves, but the regents are all for following King Eckbert's footsteps in avoiding war through negotiation. Jaron reluctantly agrees to leave the castle, opting to return to Farthenwood with Tobias. Jaron spends a night at Rulon Harlowe's estate, and Harlowe treats him very kindly and urges him to stay, but Jaron departs for Avenia and arrives the next day. He is taken by Erick, leader of the Avenian thieves, and convinces Erick to take him to the pirates, telling Erick that wants the pirates help to steal a vast amount of hidden Carthyan treasure. To his surprise, Jaron discovers that Imogen is working for the pirates as a kitchen maid. Imogen tells him that she and Amarinda, a foreign princess betrothed to the Carthyan throne, figured out that Jaron would come to the pirates, and Imogen decided to come as a last effort to discourage Jaron from his fool's errand. Devlin makes Jaron a pirate, and several days pass. Jaron gets Imogen to escape from the pirates on horseback with Fink, a young boy who came with Erick and Jaron from the thieves, but Gregor, on his way to the pirates, comes upon them and brings them back. Jaron realizes that Gregor was a traitor. Gregor exposes Jaron's true identity to Devlin, but Jaron challenges his position as pirate king, and Devlin is obliged to answer as part of the pirate's code. Jaron wins, but surrenders to Devlin in exchange for Imogen's release. Roden returns from sea early just as Jaron is about to be whipped, and becomes angry because he had been promised that he could deal with Jaron as he pleased. He kills Devlin and becomes the new pirate king. Considering his victory over Carthya as good as secure, Roden locks Jaron in a secure room with Erick and Fink and breaks Jaron's leg to ensure that no escape is possible. But with aid from Erick and Fink, Jaron climbs through a window onto a cliff, and from there scales the cliff and challenges Roden as pirate king. As they spar, Jaron expresses his desire for Roden to come to his side and return to Carthya as the captain of his guard. Jaron almost wins, but a pirate kicks Jaron's broken leg, and Jaron collapses. But Roden, having been won over by Jaron and recognizing Jaron's commitment to Carthya, surrenders and agrees to return with Jaron. Jaron goes back to Drylliad and finds that Tobias has convinced the regents not to replace Jaron with a steward. Jaron also makes Harlowe his new prime regent and mends his relationship with Amarinda, which was previously on the rocks. In the epilogue, Jaron is informed that Avenia has invaded Carthya and captured Imogen. =The Shadow Throne= Avenia, Gelyn, and Mendenwal are waging war against Carthya. Roden and Jaron have staged a public argument in hopes that his enemies will believe Carthya's armies are disorganized and quarrelsome, while providing a cover for Roden to march out to defend the borders. Jaron receives word that Imogen has been captured by Avenia, but Mott insists on rescuing Imogen in Jaron's stead, because the mission is too risky for Jaron. Jaron sends Amarinda, Tobias, and Fink to Amarinda's home country of Bymar for their safety and to ask for Bymar's aid. When Jaron discovers that Avenia captured Imogen not to lure Jaron, but Mott, Jaron's most trusted man, hoping to use Mott's duty to Imogen as leverage to force information from Mott, he changes plans and breaks into the Avenian camp to rescue them. Mott escapes, but Imogen is shot with an arrow and Jaron is captured. After some time, Tobias joins him in his prison cell and is shocked to realize that Jaron is alive, as he and Amarinda overheard Avenian soldiers claiming that Jaron was dead. Upon hearing this, Amarinda decided to return to Drylliad to encourage and lead the people while Fink went on to request Bymar's aid, but Amarinda and Tobias were separated on the way back and Tobias was captured. They are held as prisoners for a time until Mott and Harlowe rescues them from the camp. Before they leave Avenia, Jaron pays a visit to the Avenian pirates to request for their aid, but the pirates respond with unwillingness and anger. Erik assures Jaron that, whether or not the rest of the pirates come to Carthya's aid, he will aid Jaron. On their way to Drylliad, they meet Amarinda. Jaron rejoins Roden in a battle at Drylliad, reinforced by Bymarian cavalry. A Bymarian soldier informs them that Fink refused to believe Jaron was dead, and tried to prove it by going to the Avenian camp to search for Jaron after he had succeeded in his mission of requesting Bymar's aid. Although the battle at Drylliad is eventually won, Jaron realizes that most of the soldiers were not Avenian, meaning this battle is just a distraction as the bulk of Avenian soldiers await a different mission. Jaron goes out to meet the enemy at a dry lake. Jaron contrives a plot to lure the soldiers that are already there into the lake before bursting the lake's dam and drowning them, and tricking those that remain into surrendering. But even as the enemy surrenders, the bulk of Avenia's armies arrive, vastly outnumbering the Carthyans. Jaron and his troops are trapped in the battle against Avenia and Mendenwal and are forced to retreat to the woods. During this time, Fink is able to rejoin Jaron. Jaron surrenders to the Avenians to get a medical help for his soldiers. The Avenians take Jaron to Farthenwood; there, he meets Roden, who was captured, and Imogen, who did not die when she got shot and was able to recover. The next day, King Vargan of Avenia tells Jaron that since Tobias offered to trade his life for Jaron's, and they have two gallows built, Jaron can choose which two of the three of them will be hanged; Jaron says that he and Roden will go to the gallows. At the gallows, Conner, who appears to have sided with the Avenians, subtly gives Jaron a knife, allowing Jaron to cut his and Roden's ropes. The Avenian pirates and the remaining Carthya soldiers fight with the soldiers of Gelyn, Mendenwal, and Avenia. While trying to escape, Jaron is cornered by Vargan and about to be killed, but Conner intervenes, causing Vargan to kill Connor instead. Vargan makes another attempt to kill Jaron, but is stabbed by the hand of his own commander, who has come to respect Jaron and believes enough blood has been shed already and wished to surrender. Jaron makes peace with Mendenwal, Avenia, and Gelyn. Harlowe is revealed to be Roden's birth father, and the two are reunited. In the end, Jaron weds Imogen and Tobias weds Princess Amarinda, as the two have grown to love each other.  Inspiration  Nielsen had considered writing a book where someone was forced to impersonate royalty ‚Äì the underlying premise for The False Prince ‚Äì for some time. However, she had not yet conceived of a main character strong enough to carry the plot. At the time, Nielsen was working at a program for troubled youth and was struck by one boy who people doubted would succeed, but ended up being one of the first to achieve program milestones. He was the inspiration for Sage and helped pull the book together for Nielsen. Reception Critical reception for the first book in the series was mostly positive. The False Prince was named one of the New York Times' Notable Children's Books of 2012. Praise for the first entry in the trilogy centered upon the book's appeal to a wide age group, as well as for the book's plotting and characters. Publishers Weekly gave it a starred review, calling it \\"highly enjoyable.\\" However, the reviewer from The New York Times, describing the novel as a \\"grim story that takes an occasional, though only very occasional, mordant turn\\", concluded that it \\"makes the effort of reading worth the getting to the end\\" but that the \\"absence of a fully furnished world keeps this particular page turner from lingering very long after the book is closed\\". Popular reception for the first book was also positive. The paperback reprint of The False Prince placed it on The New York Times Best Seller list in May 2013. It also won the 2015 Intermediate Sequoyah Book Award, which is voted upon by students in Oklahoma. Nielsen has been grateful for the response to the series from reluctant readers and their families. Reception for the second entry was more mixed, with Publishers Weekly calling it a \\"solid sequel\\" but commenting that the book's villains were \\"perhaps too easily manipulated by the young king\\". Common Sense Media also gave a mixed review, criticizing Jaron's arrogance and saying that \\"the reasoning behind his reckless schemes is often unclear, so he seems to constantly put himself into needless danger\\". The Buffalo News, in a brief review, was more positive, stating that \\"Nielsen offers memorable characters, a complex world ... and a vivid political backdrop\\" and that the book raises good questions about war and personal sacrifice. Reception for the third book was also mixed. Praise for the book came from how it provided a satisfying ending to the series and was \\"gripping,\\" while the book was criticized for how the plot seemed unrealistic and the action was over-summarized. Film adaptation In late 2012, Nielsen announced that film rights for the series had been purchased by Paramount Pictures with the intent to create a film series. Bryan Cogman was hired to adapt the first book in the series into a movie screenplay and Deborah Forte was announced as the film's producer. In March 2017, Nielsen announced that Paramount would not be renewing the contract for the series.

It was closed in June 2011.http://www.wsaz.com/newswestvirginia/headlines/Mingo_Schools_Holding_Graduation_for_Last_Time_123162748.html History In 1916, under the leadership of Lee District board members James A. Farley, Bill Maynard, John Pinson, District Supervisor Lacy Chapman, and Superintendent of Schools Sam Curry, the plan for a new high school was started. In the fall of 1918, Frank Totten and Claude Dove, principals of the Rock House and Upper Elk schools respectively, were brought to Mingo County to organize the new school. These two principals organized a third-class high school in 1919 at Rock House. In the fall of that year, they moved the new Rock House High School to Upper Elk with Claude Dove as principal. After moving, Rock House High School was promoted to a second-class high school. In the fall of 1921, Rock House High School moved back to Rock House as a first- class high school and the school's name was changed to Burch High School. The first graduating class, in 1922, comprised twenty-one students. Of this 1922 class, two became attorneys, five went on to become doctors, and twelve became teachers.

In June 1987, Burch High School and Burch Junior High School separated. Burch Junior High remained in the same building while Burch High School moved to a new facility adjacent to the existing Mingo County Vocational School in Airport Bottom, approximately 3 miles south on Route 52. The BHS class of 1987 was the last class to graduate from the old school while the class of 1988 was the first to graduate from the new Burch High School, after starting off the year at the old building. In June 2011, Burch High School closed its doors for the last time. The 90-year-old school was consolidated with Gilbert, Matewan, and Williamson high schools to form Mingo Central High School, which opened in August 2011. The new school sits at an elevation of 1,940 feet on a 90 acre site along the King Coal Highway in Delbarton, WV (approx. 7 miles southeast of Delbarton). =Principals= * Claude Dove * O. C.
